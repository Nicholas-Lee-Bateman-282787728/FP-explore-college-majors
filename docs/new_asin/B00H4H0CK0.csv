8629862,5,B00H4H0CK0,"This is an excellent slice of life documentary focusing on American atheists. Famous leaders in the movement such as Hemant Mehta and Greg Epstein are interviewed as well as regular people about topics ranging from how to be good without god to dealing with marriage, death, and child-rearing as an atheist. For the atheist who wants to know more about their national community to the religious person who wants to know more about atheists, this film is highly recommended.",1389052800,,473,5.0
8629863,5,B00H4H0CK0,"This movie does an excellent job shining a spotlight on the humanist side of the atheism movement.  The focus is on atheists as people and how they live their lives.

Too many theists vilify atheists without even realizing it.  They have heard the myth that no one can be good without God so many times that they no longer even think to question the myth.  Theists also often seem to not understand that for some people belief requires evidence; it's not a lifestyle choice.  These misunderstandings lead to a lot of unnecessary conflict, such as atheist organizations being turned away from volunteering opportunities and charitable donations from atheists groups being refused.

This movie attempts to dispel myths about atheists by showing them as ordinary people living their lives.  Atheists have friends, families, spouses, and children, just like everyone else. They deal with pain and suffering, they celebrate Christmas, and they have marriages and funerals. By showing atheists as ordinary human beings this movie attempts to destroy the caricature many theists hold of atheists as immoral, egocentric, hedonists.",1389052800,,1123,5.3107344632768365
8629864,5,B00H4H0CK0,This is a wonderful view of ordinary people who just happen to be Atheists. Living life like any other human being. Facing the same struggles as all human beings do. And loving life as well. Three cheers to Sylvia for all of her work on this project.,1388966400,,250,4.340425531914893
8629865,5,B00H4H0CK0,"I helped fund this before I was an atheist and I received my copy after I had become one.  It shows atheists that there are lots of different, regular people out there just like them, but it also educates non-atheists on how atheists are just regular folks like everybody else.  I believed in this project and I am very pleased with the result.  I watched this with my husband and he was impressed too.",1388966400,,402,4.405405405405405
8629866,5,B00H4H0CK0,"...and this film does a great job of making that clear.  ""Hug an Atheist"" does a great job of showing that atheists are normal people, just like everyone else.",1388966400,2,159,4.482758620689655
8629867,5,B00H4H0CK0,"I saw this film at its premiere and had to have it.  Sylvia, who I was privileged to meet, has brought us a wonderful look into the challenging world of people examining their beliefs and finding the religions they were raised in wanting.  The film covers many different faiths and backgrounds and does it by allowing the interviewees to be themselves without the interference of the film maker, something I appreciated.

MOST DEFINITELY a film worth buying.  Show it to friends. Discuss it.",1388102400,,491,4.879518072289157
8629868,5,B00H4H0CK0,"Sylvia Broeckx's heartfelt documentary shows the human side of American atheists, focusing not on the freethought movement itself or the politics surrounding non-belief, but on individuals and how they find meaning, joy, and connections with others in their own lives.  It's full of laughter and tears, poignancy and exultation - but mostly, it's a portrait of humanity, showing that one doesn't need superstition and fairy tales to live a life rich in personal satisfaction, strong morals and compassion, and great happiness and community.

Superbly well-done with a beautiful soundtrack - let's hope Ms. Broeckx does us a favour and makes more films.",1386547200,2,652,5.382352941176471
8629869,5,B00H4H0CK0,"This was a bit of an eye opener for me in the sense that in parts of the USA, atheists do not get the same respect that people of religious backgrounds get. I have it pretty easy in the Northeast and I'm quite an introvert too, so I have never faced discrimination. This film was made to dispel any notion that we are evil baby eating devil worshipers. In true documentary style, the filmmaker doesn't say a word on camera and lets real people and academics talk about what their life is like, being without deities or a singular God. There is no religion bashing and I'm glad about that. Religion clearly works for many people. It looks like all the people interviewed used to be religious and their skepticism led them away. Some talk about how losing their faith was a great loss for them.  This was also informative to me because even though I was brought up in a Catholic family, I never truly believed in what 16 years of Catholic education was telling me. In fact, it was the nuns teaching me the scientific method that gave me the tools to question the religious education.
The film emphasizes that you can be good without God. Empathy is natural in psychologically healthy people. We don't need the fear of eternal damnation to be nice to other people. The parents that were interviewed talked about teaching their kids that they are ""good for goodness sake"". They give their kids critical thinking skills and will let them investigate religion if they decide to.
There's not a heck of a lot of religion in Christmas these days and atheists have no problem celebrating the holidays with the tree and decorations. For some of the people in the film, doing the whole Santa thing is fun and it also gives the kids their first experience in debunking a myth all by themselves. In a funny reversal, one woman's son was actually terrified that a guy would come into their house at night while they were sleeping even if he was dropping off gifts. She had to level with him and also about the tooth fairy.
There is a marriage ceremony documented in the film which is a mix of a traditional looking religious wedding without the God stuff and some funny moments included in their vows. It was very nice. There's a section titled Sickness and Health and an interview with a late teens early twenty something woman named Ellen with cerebral palsy. She is absolutely adorable and her outlook on life is fantastic. She is at total peace with her situation and she declared that she gives her own life meaning. Her strength and lighthearted view of her time here on Earth is very empowering.
When it comes to death, atheists have no fear of what will happen after they die but that doesn't make death and dieing any less sad in their lives. They spend their time memorializing the life of the deceased and don't go on about how they will see their loved one in the next life or that they are in a better place. For them, there is only one life and one place and it is all the more special. They feel the need to take care and appreciate what they have here on Earth, including the environment. There's no second chances and they want to make this one count.
They talked about how churches have a built-in social network and sense of community. They find that losing that can be rough but as more and more people come out of the atheist closet, community groups and support are growing too. The bottom line of the film is that atheist are people too, with all the needs and wants of any other human being.",1386374400,4,3500,4.4858934169279
8629870,5,B00H4H0CK0,"This film does a wonderful job of presenting the very real and very compassionate perspective of ""common folk"" atheists in dealing with the aspects of life where religions provide solace and guidance such as morality, raising a family, and coping with tragedy. It's not trying to de-convert anyone; It's a rebuttal to the portrayals of atheists in the media and some churches as wicked, amoral anarchists. We're human. We have families. We love life. And we're compelled by emotion as much as any religious person. If I were to create a ""starter kit"" for newly declared atheists, I would definitely include this film.",1386288000,8,617,5.0
8629871,5,B00H4H0CK0,"This kind of emotional, personal look at religious disbelief is rare and wonderful. Brilliant quality and depth from start to finish.",1386288000,6,133,5.380952380952381
