8721027,1,B00ZVSGYDI,"This great idea was, for me, a disappointment.  The sound mixing and general audio presentation was the worst I have heard in a long time.  There's a trend of dressing up old - and in this case new but poor quality - work in Blu Ray and DTS Master Audio packages and offering them as higher quality work.  I guess one must now be more mistrustful and / or careful about the Blu Ray offerings.",1512172800,,392,4.2
8721028,5,B00ZVSGYDI,"This DVD is perhaps my favorite album, and which I have given to friends across the years. Marcus Roberts, blind pianist from New Orleans, does a breathtaking performance playing Gershwin' s Rapsody in Blue. The setting of the amphitheater conveys an inspirational ambience and as always Seiji Ozawa with his winsome personality and masterful skill as Conductor Eli ting the best from the great Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra makes for a memorable and uplifting experience.",1479513600,,472,5.391891891891892
