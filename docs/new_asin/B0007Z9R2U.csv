2254267,5,B0007Z9R2U,"A story of a girl getting too caught up with celebrities and forgetting her friends, who prove to be true friends in the end.  All girls are very stylish and cute, good plot and really catchy songs.  And there's also a story with a celebrity boy who is only stuck on himself.  Teaches girls that not all boys that are cute and sweet can be nice. One of the side characters is actually Lindsay Lohan, who proves to be a nice girl and a good friend.  Gives an insight on the movie making and acting careers. The disc has a bonus trivia game, a dress up game, and a search game.  Very worth the while, since the kids spend a lot of time watching and playing.  Best from 6 to 11 years old.  Although I like it too, because of all the latest trendy clothes in it.  Highly recommend.",1175990400,,777,4.167785234899329
2254268,5,B0007Z9R2U,"I found My Scene Goes Hollywood really enjoyable.  It had a good storyline that held within it some messages girls should listen to.  Is this movie directed towards the really young?  Prbly not.  Is it directed towards tweens (and adults or collectors) alike-- yup.

The Story follows the group of friends as they find themselves on a movie set as extras for a movie starring Lindsey Lohan.  Through nothing but luck, Madison gets chosen to be more of a principle player and that is where the story takes off.

My favorite parts?  Delancy and the Kraft Service Table.  She is hilarious.  The animation for these movies is something that I have always enjoyed.  It's not a rip off of 'anime' style animation, nor is it truly traditional.  It's very 'my scene', which is fine by me!

Overall, don't dismiss this automatically.  The movie is really quite endearing and enjoyable.",1163376000,,876,4.791946308724833
2254269,5,B0007Z9R2U,"I just ordered this movie, but i have the other two already.  My 8 yr. old daughter and even my 5 yr. old son love them.  They have watched them over and over again.  I think they are very good myself.  I would definately suggest them to anyone.",1156896000,,245,4.041666666666667

 P.S.- Sorry to any girls who like My Scene dolls. It's just my opinion. Please don't be mad.",1152662400,,245,5.075
2254271,4,B0007Z9R2U,okay what is the deal! we are here to talk about myscene NOT Bratz!!!! if you wanna argue go to a chat room!!! so what if there are mistakes NO MOVIE IS PERFECT!!!!!!! this movie is o.k. it is about 4 friends in a movie 1 gets a semi-big part and goes into a miss. Hollywood act.  her friends forgive her everybodys happy the END.[ it is not gross she kissed aguy for a MOVIE people get real!!!] I have never seen the bratz movie cuz' bratz are shallow. but anyway this whole arguement is pointless.,1146960000,2,499,4.197916666666667
2254272,4,B0007Z9R2U,"It may seem like a little kid movie, but it is actualy more for girls who enjoy make-up,fachion, and just real world situations. I hope you enjoy!",1142553600,7,146,4.444444444444445
2254273,1,B0007Z9R2U,"My daughter asked for this movie and I agree with most of the children's reviews. The movie was not entertaining and too mature for its intended audience. And last but certainly not least, why are there no other races represented in the my scence crew?! No wonder your sales of barbie and crew are down. Matel needs to wake up! I am now a faithful BRATZ customer because they make a point to include more than one race in all of their dolls and movies. And the bratz movie is better.",1138406400,2,483,4.318681318681318
2254274,5,B0007Z9R2U,"oh for goodness sakes! i'm 26 and i really have no feeling one way or the other between my scene and bratz but i did enjoy this cartoon movie very much. the character design, colors and animation are very pretty to look at. the storyline is very current and realistic (as much as a cartoon about sneaking into a lindsay lohan movie as an extra and landing a role as a costar and getting to hang out with lindsay can be [...] and lindsay lohan actually did the voice which is pretty cool.

totally reccomended for young girls and people who like movies like clueless, mean girls, orange county or new york minute.",1135468800,8,612,4.415929203539823
2254275,5,B0007Z9R2U,"This movie is great! You 1 star raters should give this movie a chance. This might not be the best movie,but it is a pretty great movie. I just wish other people would see that too.

2254276,5,B0007Z9R2U,"My kids are fans of both Myscene and Bratz... They were begging me to buy this movie when it came out just as they begged me to by the new Bratz movie.

Kids on this site..... It is okay to agree to disagree. And what I mean is- not everyone will like Myscene and not everyone will like Bratz. It doesn't make them weird or different. You cannot force your opinion on anyone. Rememeber that not just in this situation but throughout life as well. I think that you all are very smart kids and respectful kids...Keep it that way.

Peace",1131235200,,534,4.2772277227722775
2254277,4,B0007Z9R2U,"My girls, who are 5 and 7 years old, love it.  Be warned that the girls talk a lot about boys and having boyfriends but I had no problem with it.",1130284800,3,145,3.6774193548387095
2254278,4,B0007Z9R2U,"The loveable MY SCENE girls are extras in Lindsay Lohan's latest movie. When a director heard about the actress Samantha broke her leg, he knew he needed a new actress to replace Samantha. Madison gets the part, but soon she forgets about the people that will be in her life for eternity, her best friends...

MOVIE: The movie had a great meaning ""Don't Forget about the people that love you for you"". I've seen all the My Scene movies and this one shines through the rest. It was shocking when Madison broke away from her best friends in the whole world. The celebrity life made Madison all caught up in the fame and it was hard for her to get out of it because of Ryan Ridley, which he is very selfish.

ANIMATION: Who cares if this movie isn't in 3-D, the My Scene girls have great fashion and they always change everyday. I'm proud that MY SCENE isn't all about the color PINK, because not everyone likes PINK. It had great settings and view of the MY SCENE version of New York.

NEGATIVES: This movie should have been much more longer, because at the end, it felt like something was missing. There were some parts that were dull as a broken pencil.

CONCLUSION: Overall, this movie has lots of cute comedy and the best thing is that, MY SCENE isn't only for ages 6-11, it's also for teenagers...Many teenagers can relate to the basic BEST FRIENDS. MY SCENE shows teens how to be BEST FRIENDS and making commitments and decisions when it come to these relationships.

PERSONAL: MY SCENE should have their own TV SHOW (I know it would be much more better than that kiddish BRATZ show)",1130112000,,1587,4.477508650519031
2254279,4,B0007Z9R2U,My daughter and I watched this movie together and we enjoyed it.  We collect My Scene dolls and movies so this was a must.  I am glad that we purchased it.,1128038400,4,155,3.967741935483871
2254280,3,B0007Z9R2U,hi to start the film has a great meaning friends last forever and stardoom can fade. But I was sad to see so much of the film based on lindsay and ryan. The games are good loved barbies profile to see which girl you match up with. I think a five for friendship last forever theme  and 3 for the overall storyline. They could have just made up actors for the film instead of using real people.but I do like the people they used lindsay sounds like a great girl and the singer's on the c.d are awsome and sound great.,1125705600,,515,4.099009900990099

2254283,5,B0007Z9R2U,"This movie was fabulous!!  My husband just brought home a screener that was sent to him, and my 10-year-old daughter and her friends LOVED it!!!  I would definitely recommend this to any moms out there - it's very entertaining while still teaching girls strong morals (i.e. your friendships with your girlfriends are more important than boys!).  The addition of characters like Lindsay Lohan - and even a cameo by Harvey Weinstein - were entertaining for me, too.  I can't say enough good things about this movie - my daughter already loved My Scene, and this movie just made her love it even more.",1124150400,4,598,4.776699029126213

8054581,5,B0007Z9R2U,This was one of my favorite movies as a little girl. When I didn't have cable this was one of the few movies that I would watch on DVD over and over again. I think I counted myself having had watched it 52 times one summer. But then for some reason I lost it and I didn't know how so when I saw it on Amazon for a decent price I just knew that I had to order it again.,1521504000,,368,3.6125
