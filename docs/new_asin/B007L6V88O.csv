8519290,1,B007L6V88O,"This movies doesn't deserve one star, but this is the lowest option available.
It was absolutely horrible. I rented it because IMDb (Internet Movie Database) had a rating of 7.4, and the plot summary sounded decent.
Being an Amazon Prime customer luckily I was not charged for it. I did try to watch it, but after 15 minutes of watching something that made no sense I turned it off.  I would recommend this movie to someone I do not like.",1436227200,,438,4.475
8519291,1,B007L6V88O,"According to all the customer reviews this is a 5 star movie much like the Godfather and Casablanca. Give me a break! Some of the reviews even bear a strong resemblance to the notes on the back of the DVD.Buyer beware,this movie is amateurish,dull,boring with what I presume are Brian Lupo's friends and family starring in this piece of garbage.",1415491200,,345,4.766666666666667
8519292,5,B007L6V88O,"13 Days is put together really well. The story line is overall creepy and scary, and the anachronical time line builds suspense. Important scenes are placed at the right time to help piece together what is happening and range from strange to creepy to scary. Finally, the ending is perfect fit leaving off with a good amount of eerie.",1373587200,,334,4.677966101694915
8519293,5,B007L6V88O,"I found this movie to be refreshing, something different and enjoyable. Take a Walk in the path of Evil. A great Indy Film...Actor Tim Huston gives a great performance.",1366761600,,168,4.827586206896552
8519294,5,B007L6V88O,"Fun, scary, twisted movie!  I like the way the movie was presented, like putting together pieces of a puzzle.  This movie had a little of everything; slasher scenes, demonic scenes, twisted characters, creepy angles, and more.  Clever way to close the movie too!  Must see!",1363132800,,273,5.0
8519295,5,B007L6V88O,"It's my favorite time of the year! Time to cozy up next to the lady on the couch in front of the fire and watch horror movies. We were glad we came across this film, it was very cool, creepy, and had just the right amount of gore. This film was a lot better than a lot of the horror films you find on the shelves now a days. The main character played a good creepy and at the same time innocent person. Loved the effects and the camera angles.

This is definitely a perfect horror movie for the season. Loved it!

  !!Go check this movie out!!",1351209600,6,543,4.046728971962617
8519296,5,B007L6V88O,This film was really scary and I thought the plot was well done.  The actors did a great job for a low budget film and I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to be frightened and enjoy a good Thriller.,1350518400,5,211,4.023809523809524
8519297,5,B007L6V88O,"I watched M.O.N. from Lone Wolf Films and really liked it, so I thought I would give their other films a try. I love the cinematography in M.O.N. but I like the old-school horror style of 13 Days. It seems their films are unlike any of the main-stream or even other independent films I've seen - very unique.  Scary, gory and filled with good times - worth checking out. Waiting for their next release.",1350432000,2,402,4.4324324324324325
8519298,5,B007L6V88O,Glad I got this one! Big fan of the Brian Lupo movies and I think he nailed it again with this film!,1350432000,,100,3.590909090909091
