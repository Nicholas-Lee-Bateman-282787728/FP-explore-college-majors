8517825,3,B007ISJRU6,"This 6-Disc collection features these two Documentary Series: VIETNAM-AMERICA'S CONFLICT and VIETNAM WAR STORIES. This collection contains more than 28 Hours of documentaries about the Vietnam War. If you are a History buff and you want to add just about any documentaries you can find about the Vietnam war to your collection then go for it, this is a decent DVD set to own. However I only recommend this collection to hardcore Vietnam war buffs, people having a huge interest for this controversial war. Truth is: there's a lot of documentaries that are better than the two series you'll find on this set. This is a nice idea by Mill Creek, but the results could have been a lot better.

-- Documentary 1: VIETNAM-AMERICA'S CONFLICT ( 4 DVD, 23 Hours 26 minutes )
Be an eyewitness to the conflict that divided our nation and changed the very fabric of society. This collection of harrowing and compelling footage traces the evolution of this conflict from a regional military engagement to an ever-expanding war that ultimately spanned three U.S. Presidents. From strategic political move to the immediacy of jungle warfare and the weapons with which the war was waged, Vietnam: America's Conflict captures the sweep of history and the agony of a generation.

-- Documentary 2: VIETNAM WAR STORIES ( 2 DVD, 5 Hours, 12 Episodes )
Witness the Vietnam War, its roots, its battles, its heroes and the price paid in the name of freedom. This stunning, detailed collection shows the war with heartbreaking realism. It looks at troubling questions about America's justification for the conflict, the horrors of jungle warfare and the human calamity of the war. Ultimately, it profiles the courage of the soldiers who put their lives on the line in the name of patriotism. ""Vietnam War Stories"" is a 'grand scope project' covering the war years of 1954 to 1975. The timing for this show is right with renewed interested in the conflict as it draws comparisons to the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition to the outstanding color action footage in the documentary, we have eyewitness interviews ranging from accounts of policy makers in Washington to remembrances of ""Grunts"" who were humping the boonies trying to survive a ""365 and a wake up"" for a trip home on the ""freedom bird"". Since Robert McNamara's confessions won an Oscar, many of the policy makers are willing to speak on the record for the first time.",1349395200,4,2412,4.894865525672372
