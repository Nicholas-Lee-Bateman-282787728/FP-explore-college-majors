Oh and the movie is a must have for any true blue OT and prequel Star Wars fan.  This is the movie that kicks off the clone wars animated series which includes the lost missions blu ray as well.  It takes place between episode 2 and 3.  If you didn't like anakin before I guarantee you will now.",1524182400,,550,4.41
