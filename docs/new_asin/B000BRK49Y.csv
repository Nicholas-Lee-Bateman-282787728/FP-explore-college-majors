8245862,4,B000BRK49Y,"This is a real relic of this great argentinean group from their most bloomy age, back in the midst of the 70's.

They perform the legendary 'Miss Lilly Higgins' and the glorious 'Chacarera de Santiago' - absolutely marvelous to watch!

Great for lovers of oldies and of the good old Les Luthiers back with Acher, right before 'Mastropiero Que Nunca'.",1131062400,3,350,4.816666666666666
