6031476,2,B00FUABIQK,"In the middle of a big college party, a meteor falls onto the ground nearby, causing a strange phenomenon. I hate to reveal too much about the story, so let me just say that this has something to do with ones identity. And perhaps ones own life. Only a few students have noticed this, including David (Rhys Wakefield) and Teddy (Logan Miller).

The story sounds interesting, well, on paper. Theres potential for a thrilling and emotionally involving sci-fi drama, to be sure, but what you actually see is a half-baked result, with long and tedious party scenes and dull characters we do not care much. What will happen in the end? Neither the answer to the question nor the process to the answer is shown in an effective way.

What you get instead is the contrived situation that gets increasingly silly. Sorry for my vague expressions, but in short, Plus One (+1) could have been a thought-provoking thriller, but with this heavy-handed direction it simply is not.",1400630400,,965,4.772455089820359
6031477,4,B00FUABIQK,"+1 (Dennis Iliadis, 2013)

Okay, we'll get the usual criticism of the movie out of the way: if you've seen Repeaters, you've basically seen a small-scale version of +1. No denying this, no way. That said, Bill Gullo (turning in his first feature, based on a story by director Iliadis) asks all the right what if? questions to turn this into a very interesting movie, and sets things up so you think you know some stuff about the characters but... in any case, while the movie does have a few flaws here and there that keep it from becoming the classic it could have been, Iliadis (previously responsible for the Last House on the Left remake) turns in a surprisingly serviceable paranormal thriller that's a great deal of fun to boot.

Plot: Angad (Newlyweeds' Rohan Kymal) is throwing the party of the year, and almost everyone's invited. (His drug dealer, Kyle [Martha Marcy May Marlene's Adam David Thompson], is not, and the two have a very public argument outside the house about it. This becomes important.)  A few days previous, David (The Purge's Rhys Wakefield) fell victim to a misunderstanding and got dumped by longtime girlfriend Jill (About Cherry's Ashley Hinshaw). David's friend Teddy (The Bling Ring's Logan Miller) thinks going to the party and getting boozed up, maybe even finding himself a new squeeze, would be just the thing. As they get there, they're ambushed by childhood friend Allison (played at various times by twin sisters Suzanne and Colleen Dengel, best known for The Devil Wears Prada), an emo-style introvert who ends up tagging along with them. All well and good, save the conjunction of a meteorite crash and some electrical anomalies that have... odd... effects on the partygoers. Soon enough, David, Teddy, and Allison are trying to figure out how to survive the night, but there's a catchJill is also at the party, and David refuses to leave without saving her as well.

While things generally play out just about as you expect them to once you cop to what Iliadis and scriptwriter Bill Gullo, turning in his first feature, are up to, that doesn't mean they don't have another trick up their sleeves every once in a while. All three characters react to the anomaly in different waysone of them reacts normally (i.e., how you most likely believe you would react in the same situations), while his two otherwise-obsessed friends react in totally different, but still believable, ways. (This is not a spoilerall three of them are in some way neurotic.) The rest of the film is enjoyable enough for its basic premise and huge amounts of eye candy (not just the gratuitous nudity, of which there is a great deal, but the sumptuous camerawork and set designaside from acres of bare breasts, there is a great deal of high school fantasy fulfillment in the party itself, not to mention Angad's ability to pay for it all), but it's in their three main characters where Iliadis and Gullo really shine here. The downside of that is that some of the other aspects of the film feel rushed; some minor characters could have been better-developed, the resolution is a little too neat for Iliadis' subtext about disposability, at least if he's against it (as he seems to be)but were I you, I would not let those things put me off watching this movie. Aspiring thriller and horror directors will especially want to take note as Gullo hands you a textbook on how to develop characters who are both well-drawn and unpredictable enough to make a movie pop. *** ",1397174400,,3482,4.796666666666667
6031478,4,B00FUABIQK,"to be perfectly honest, this could have gotten 5 stars from me. The reason it didn't? My fault...honestly the idea of a time paradox or time flux messes with my head. A meteor hits near where a bunch of teens are having a big bash, some kind of electrical discharge comes from the meteor and affects the party...I won't say more because it is pretty interesting and different. The director Dennis Iliadis did a great job keeping things on track.  All the performers are superb! Especially, the 4 leads...I hope to see them a lot more and they are Rhys Wakefield, Logan Miller, Ashley Hinshaw and Natalie Hall. Bravo! Best suggestion....pay very close attention.",1394496000,3,661,4.798245614035087
6031479,2,B00FUABIQK,"A creative storyline of what would your reaction be if through some event (the one used in the movie of a meteor was just cheap hokey) creating duplicates of yourself (sure!) and those around you and in the course of a day your group and the duplicate group move closer in time to being face to face. What would you do? (Or your fears do.)

Unfortunately too much time was spent on the party atmosphere and little in depth thought given to the range of reactions and outcomes. Better physics and time-space issues addressed would have helped.",1392249600,,542,4.587628865979381
6031480,4,B00FUABIQK,"I have long felt that one of my favorite things to do is watch many many small budget films, weed out the junk, find the good ones and recommend them to friends; saving them time and money. Strangely enough, I'm not a fan of most independent films or the independent film explosion we witnessed a few years back. I believe that movement was GREAT, but the way Hollywood dealt with it ruined future generations of movies. Hollywood realized that they didn't have to make great movies to make money, they could make CHEAP movies. What followed was a onslaught of terrible movies from Hollywood and a wave of yawner films from independent producers about NOTHING... absolutely NOTHING. ""We got a camera!! Let's make a movie where everybody sits around talking!!""  ""Yeah!""  It's a great thing that you can make movies on a pitiful budget, but for goodness sakes, have a story to tell. Do something unique and different.

Again though, I love movies so much that I'm willing to pour through the pile of junk and find gems like ""Plus One"". It is something different and unique. Despite the fact that 60-70% of independent films are a waste of all the products used to make and distribute, occasionally something great happens and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE to tell people about it.

""Plus One"" is one of those movies that you don't want to know anything about before viewing. You don't want to read about it and you don't want to know about it. You just want to trust that when people tell you that it's good; believe them. I'm not gonna tell you anything about it either, except to say that it sort of reminded me of the movie ""Project X"" at first.... AT FIRST.

Honestly, I just picked it up because I saw that Ashley Hinshaw was in it.  Otherwise I probably would have avoided it... because I hate independent movies about drugs and or clubbing and that's what it looked like based on the cover of the movie.  Ashley Hinshaw is a good and fearless actress who does a great job in this film as does most of the cast. I do believe that the lead actor was pretty emotionless for most of the movie and that sort of dampened my appreciation of the film a bit. Bottom-line though, this is a thought-provoking and consistently shocking and intense film. ""Plus One"" is one of the good ones.",1391558400,,2270,4.549019607843137

8618623,5,B00FUABIQK,"Every so often a great movie sneaks under the radar. You asks around and no one's ever heard of it. Plus One is that movie. A typical wild college party turns into something weird, supernatural, and really philosophical. The relatively unknown cast delivers some fantastic acting, couple this with an intreging storyline and some phenomenally good low key special effects and you get an amazing surprise movie. Don't miss this one sci Fi fans.",1486166400,,443,5.0
8618624,5,B00FUABIQK,"+1 is hard to peg down, and that alone speaks volumes about how much I love this movie. The acting, script, and plot all get 5 stars. It's funny when it needs to be, serious when it needs to be, and a complete mind screw pretty much non-stop. It fits nicely into both sci-fi and horror, without necessarily being too much of either. If stretching your brain to understand a movie isn't your thing, consider viewing this on Netflix first. But if you love creative and unique films that aren't afraid of exploring the path least traveled, this movie is a cant-miss experience.",1480204800,,574,4.58252427184466

8618629,3,B00FUABIQK,"I typically enjoy watching flicks released by IFC Films. They are rarely masterpieces, but they swerve as a tier or two above the fluff entries that tend to come out from other companies. This one I was pretty excited to see. Every time I would watch the trailer before some other flick, I would get kind of excited so I eventually ordered it. My girlfriend really wanted to see it as well. When we sat down and watch it, I I wouldn't say we were blown away, but we weren't disappointed in it either. It takes some elements from Triangle and Time Crimes but it's got its own flavor to it as well. I'd definitely  casually watch it again,",1406678400,,637,4.352941176470588
