8654164,5,B00JWHF0NE,"The only disappointment was the extra poster received with this, the extra poster was folded very poorly and a bit ripped, and personally I prefer vertical posters, not horizontal. So besides that--

This came in perfect condition. I was worried when I first received the package however, only for a couple reasons:

1) It came in a very trashed and destroyed box that was barely held together by tape. The box itself didn't look like it had been made completely before the sender decided to just tape it together instead. It looked, and partially smelled, as if it had been through the 9 layers of hell and back.

2)There was only bubblewrap inside to protect the package, and even though there was a lot of bubblewrap, I was still worried that there wasn't enough to protect it from these apparent dangerous elements.

But in the end, there wasn't a scratch or dent on it! Came with the TOP poster, the DVD brand new and unscratched, and of course the beautiful big book full of his face. As well as postcards! This was perfect and I thank you!",1407888000,,1046,4.577540106951871
