451341,1,630231464X,"When I saw this movie, I found the acting on Ray Bolgers part to be really overly cheeky and jerky. I'm hoping it was just the script and directing. The tap dancing segments were very strange as well. However, I may be over critical at this. I will try and not compare it to The Wizard Of Oz, until I've seen other movies he's starred in.
I found this Doris Day movie to be pretty boring, compared to others I've seen during this same time period, in the 50's. 'Tea For Two' and 'Moonlight Bay' are far more entertaining.",1419292800,,521,4.2727272727272725

451344,3,630231464X,"but I have to admit, Doris Day looks a little long in the tooth for this part although Ray Bolger is great. Ridiculous plot line and highly unbelievable but the music is fun and the dancing pretty darn good, especially from Bolger.",1388016000,,231,4.523809523809524
451345,4,630231464X,"Released in 1952 by Warner Bros, and directed by David Butler, April In Paris is a charming little musical that is light, airy and fun.  It lacks the splashiness and sophistication  of those grand MGM musicals, but less is sometimes better, and in this case, it works out quite well.

In the film, Doris Day plays a brash but talented chorus girl, Ethel ""Dynamite"" Jackson, who is mistakenly sent an invitation to represent the USA, on a peace talk/cultural exchange conference in Paris.  Ray Bolger plays the bungling, but charming diplomat, who falls for her almost immediately, and is soon forced to choose between Ethel, and his powerful boss's daughter (Eve Miller) with whom he is engaged.

First of all, I have to say that I love Doris Day.  Her voice is so soothing to listen to. She is probably one of the best female vocal stylists to ever appear in movie musicals.  When she sings, ""I Know A Place"", and the title tune, it just leaves me breathless.

Her co-star, Ray Bolger, was a Broadway superstar, and did not make many film appearances.  His pointed features and his tall and lanky build are not, by today's standards, the ideal physical characteristics of a Hollywood leading man, but you have to remember, in the 1940s and 1950s, male dancers did not have to look like Clark Gable or Cary Grant. Although Ray Bolger didn't have a photogenic face, he had more than enough talent to play opposite of Doris Day.

Endearing French character actor, Claude Dauphin (1903-1978), plays a mischievous cabaret performer, Philippe Fouquet, and acts as narrator for the film.  He seems to be like the poor man's version of Maurice Chevalier, but he is no less charming and certainly, no less talented.  He provides several moments of comic relief, and sings a couple of tunes himself; the sexy, ""Give Me Your Lips"", a humorous version of ""April in Paris"", and ""That's What Makes Paris Paree"", with Doris Day in a staged production number.

The most memorable scene is when a party gets started in the kitchen of a French ship.  It begins with Dauphin singing, ""Apres de la Blondes"", followed by Day's show stopping number, ""I'm Gonna Ring the Bell Tonight"", and concludes with Bolger dancing up a storm on a kitchen counter.  Unfortunately, although Day, Bolger and Dauphin turn in fine performances, the film seemed to lose its momentum about halfway through.

Needless to say, April In Paris is not Doris Day's best film, and yet, it is still enjoyable to watch; perfect for passing a couple of hours by on a rainy afternoon.

451348,5,630231464X,"This is one of the most delightful Doris Day musicals she made at Warner Bros.. Althou the pairing of Doris Day and Ray Bolger seems like a really odd couple-it works. The story may be slim, but weren't most plots in a musical slim! I saw this in the theatre when I was in my 20's and liked it then and I like it now. April In Paris became one of my favorite songs after I heard Doris sing it in the movie. And the dancing by Ray Bolger and Doris Day was terrific. Especially in the ""I'm Gonna Ring The Bell Tonight"" number. I actually liked this Paris themed movie better than ""An American In Paris"" classic. I know this film may be obscure to most (even Doris Day fans) but I urge any one who likes light hearted feel good movies to give this one a try.

451424,4,630231464X,"The United States is having a peace conference in Paris and has carefully chosen delegates from several aspects of the culture to represent the country. One such delegate is Ethel ""Dynamite"" Jackson (Doris Day) an ordinary chorus girl who was accidentally sent correspondance meant for Ethel Barrymore. When the slip up reaches the press, the reporters have a field day praising the government for picking a real girl to represent America. S. Winthrop Putnam (Ray Bolger) is responsible for the mistake, so it is up to him to keep Ethel under control and at the same time keep his affections toward her a secret.

If you are a fan of pleasant and breezy musicals, this one is for you. The story is fun and somewhat unusual, although it reverts back to the basic plot of a forbidden romance. It is rather strange seeing Day and Bolger as a couple, especially since their relationship begins so suddenly, but they are a good match musically. The title song is standout and the others are enjoyable. Claude Dauphin provides bookends to the story and the ""French"" perspective.",1215907200,,1072,4.826086956521739

451427,3,630231464X,"This movie was all right for three reasons: The singing, the dancing, and my all time favorite actress:DORIS DAY!!!! Although I do watch this movie alot, it's mainly because Doris Day was in it. I felt she was sort of mis - cast in this film. Although, she was beautiful and they actually made her hair look pretty, the film did drag in some spots, mainly the part where Day and Bolger keep going into eachother's cabin thinking it's their own. Songs like: I never knew my heart could sing, April in Paris, That's what makes Paris Paree, It must be Good, and i'm Gonna Ring the Bell Tonight, really makes this movie. And I think it's kinda funny that Ethel, (Day) really doesn't like Sam (Bolger) and suddenly she's kissing him and they want to get married. It is funny when Ethel and Sam's 'fiance' start fighting over Sam and their purses are wacking everybody upside the head!!! Ray Bolger does a wonderful dance with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln who tap in they're picture frame! Overall, it is a good movie and a must see for Ray Bolger fans!!!",1097280000,,1058,4.544502617801047

So Ray Bolger must fly to New York as quickly as possible to straighten out this mess.  Doris truly believes that as the letter states, the government wants her to represent the American theater at an Arts exposition in Paris, France.  Well, Bolger goes to New York and tells her the foul-up.  Disappointing indeed.  But Wait!  This is a Doris Day movie and something good is bound to happen.  Doris Day movies always have a happy ending.

451430,4,630231464X,"When it was released in 1952, ""April in Paris"" proved to be another box-office winner for star Doris Day. She was the reigning box-office ""Queen"" in the world and this film further solidified her ranking with the public.
The main reason to see this film is Doris Day and in every scene in which she appears you watch her and only her - the true sign of a Star of the first magnitude. In scenes in which she doesn't appear, you eagerly await her return.
Miss Day's co-star is Ray Bolger, hot off a tremendous Broadway success in ""Where's Charley"". The nimble and long-legged dancer had been a favorite for nearly two decades, being especially fondly remembered for his 1939 turn as the Scarecrow in the classic, ""The Wizard of Oz"". Unfortunately, he and Miss Day has virtually no on-screen chemistry and their dancing styles don't especially mesh either. They move nicely together in several numbers but there is none of the on-screen magic that Miss Day and Gene Nelson displayed in their dancing numbers together previously.
Doris Day plays ""Dynamite"" Jackson, a performer who is brassy and a bit loud. It is somewhat reminiscent of Miss Day's debut role as Georgia in ""Romance on The High Seas"". She is a delight, getting full opportunity to display her incredible comic timing and skill which even then was well ahead of any other actress making films. She is also vulnerable and endearing and renders the title tune better than it has ever been rendered, before or since. She looks like a dream in lush technicolor and sings the film's other songs in her inimitable voice. Especially lovely is ""I Know a Place"" and she nearly stops the show with the rollicking ""I'm Gonna Ring the Bell Tonight"" which also lets her have full rein with some zesty dance steps.
Ray Bolger reminds one of Icahbod Crane, with his lanky frame and gawky way of performing. He's enjoyable and gets to show his talents in several scenes but again, the lack of chemistry between him and Miss Day makes some of their scenes together a bit awkward.
The plot line, condensed, is that Miss Day is accidently sent to Paris to represent the USA Theatre. The invite should have gone to Ethel Barrymore. Bolger works for the US Government and must go attempt to clear up the mistake.
The rest of the cast are pleasant and Claude Dauphin lends a ""Chevalier-esque"" touch to the proceedings.
Warner Brothers has dressed up the film with some nice production values that make the time pass tunefully and pleasingly.
One wishes that Miss Day had been able to venture over to the MGM lot around this time, when musicals were still making quite a splash. That pairing in the early 50's might have resulted in a string of additional classics to add to Miss Day and Leo the Lion's long list.
However, there are few moments sweeter than Doris singing the title song, and while possibly not transporting the listener to Paris, she takes us instead to that lovely, peaceful and serene place that only this superstar can take us by the sheer magic of her being.",1062547200,,3018,4.685499058380414
451431,4,630231464X,"By 1952, her fourth year of film-making, Doris Day had become the top female box office draw in the U.S. She was generally better than the films in which she appeared, and APRIL IN PARIS is no exception. If you're not particularly a Doris Day fan, you will probably find the film a light time-passer at best (and certainly won't agree with my four-star rating!). But if, like me, you consider Day one of the most enjoyable of all Hollywood musical stars, you'll be delighted by this movie.
The plot centers around a U.S. diplomat (played by Ray Bolger, the legendary Broadway performer in one of his infrequent film appearences) who is charged with inviting an American actress to a Parisian arts festival. By mistake, he invites not Ethel Barrymore but Ethel ""Dynamite"" Jackson (played by Day), a snappy Broadway chorus girl. Complications ensue, as the two fight, fall in love, and enjoy the pleasures of springtime in Paris.
Of course, in the early 1950s, most American movies were filmed on Hollywood soundstages, so Day and Bolger never actually got anywhere NEAR Paris. But to make up for the lack of authentic French atmosphere, the movie's cast features the fine French actor Claude Dauphin in a supporting role.
APRIL IN PARIS, like the other musicals made by Warner Bros. in the late 1940s and early 1950s, has its plusses and minuses. It is nowhere near as artistically and technically accomplished as the musicals of the same period made by MGM. Its script is somewhat flat and silly (though with a few good lines) and its choreography is nothing special. However, the musical direction and arrangements are excellent. And the costumes and use of Technicolor are quite attractive; appropriately, the film's color scheme features lots of spring-like pastel shades.
The film's score, by Vernon Duke and Sammy Cahn, includes several pleasant numbers, including a lovely ballad, ""I Know a Place,"" and the rousing ""That's What Makes Paris Paree."" The classic title song had actually been written 20 years earlier by Duke and ""Yip"" Harburg for a Broadway revue called WALK A LITTLE FASTER.
What about Doris Day? She is actually somewhat miscast in her role--as written, ""Dynamite"" Jackson is more like the brash, wise-cracking chorus girls played by Betty Grable in her 1940s musicals, whereas Doris' film persona was more gentle and quietly spunky. But Doris still does an excellent job. She dances quite well in a few lively routines with Bolger. She wears her attractive costumes well. And--as always--her singing shows her to be one of the finest popular song stylists ever. Her bittersweet performance of the title tune toward the beginning of the film is a classic performance, and one of her most memorable moments on film. (In addition, Doris also displays the subtle sexiness that has been too-little remarked on by film historians recalling her career. In her opening number, ""It Must Be Good,"" there is a moment where she turns her back to the camera and walks briskly upstage--delightful!)
If you enjoy 1950s musicals, and especially if you are a fan of Doris Day, you'll be pleased with APRIL IN PARIS.",997056000,,3121,4.958015267175573
451432,3,630231464X,"This picture was made when Doris Day was ""Doris Day"", that fresh-faced, delightful blond singer who lit up the silver screen with her beautiful smile and glorious singing voice.
""April in Paris"",  directed by David Butler was a colorful, joyous romp for Doris Day and Ray  Bolger.  Mr. Bolger has been criticized for not being a suitable co-star  for Miss Day, but I felt he did a credible job in the picture.  No, he was  not handsome, like Rock Hudson, but Rock couldn't DANCE like Bolger!
And  dance up a storm, he does!  I enjoyed his acrobatic dance routines in  ""I'm Gonna Ring the Bell Tonight"" and the politically-themed  dance with former Presidents' portraits, coming to life to dance with  Bolger.
Doris Day, as Ethel ""Dynamite"" Jackson, a Broadway  chorus girl, who is mistakenly chosen, instead of Ethel Barrymore, to  represent America at a Paris Festival, is energetic and bouncy and mostly  delightful.  Her rendition of ""April in Paris"" was hauntingly  beautiful and the highlight of the film.  It was also a hit record for Miss  Day.
The nicely staged, ""It Must Be Good"" also showcased Miss  Day's wonderful singing voice and dancing skills as did ""That's What  Makes Paris Paree"".
Claude Dauphin lugubriously reprises the title  tune in a side-walk cafe with the wind blowing bitterly while he sings the  song to Doris.
To my knowledge, this is the only occasion in which Doris  Day engages in an all out fist fight on the screen!  If you can believe it,  she was battling over Ray Bolger with Eve Miller, who also had the illusion  that Bolger was ""Clark Gable"".
In the aforementioned ""I'm  Gonna Ring the Bell Tonight"", Doris Day opens the number with some  rousing singing and later joins Bolger for some fancy footwork.
If you  love Doris Day, you'll like this film. As usual, there was able support by  veteran actors like Paul Harvey, who later played ""Henry Miller"",  proprieter of the Golden Garter Saloon in ""Calamity Jane"".",952905600,,1952,4.806646525679758
