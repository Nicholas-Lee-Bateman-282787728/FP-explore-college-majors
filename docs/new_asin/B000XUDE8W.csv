8325916,5,B000XUDE8W,"Indian classical music is one of the most spiritual forms of culture available today or at any other time.  The combination of formal structure and unbridled improvisation is truly unique.  Ustad Amjad Ali Khan represents the fifth generation of an ancient musical tradition expressed through his family.  While all of this DVD is beautiful and magnificent, the second raga,Desh, in my opinion, is truly transcendent.  If you love Indian music or in fact great music of any kind you'll delight in this DVD.",1364428800,3,506,5.0602409638554215
