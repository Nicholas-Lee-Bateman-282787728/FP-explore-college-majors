1083867,1,6305836620,"I don't know how the release of this film coincided with the Stonewall riots of the same year, but either way I approached it with trepidation. Directed by Bruce Kessler, a veteran of such TV comedies as The Monkees and I Dream of Jeannie, my curiosity was on the level of how offensive could this treatment be to a modern gay person. The setup is that two straight men pretend to be gay to avoid the Vietnam draft, and this pretence extends to them living together as a couple in a pre-decorated ""cottage"" in the ghetto of San Francisco. My reservations were not about how gay the two would pretend to be, but rather what kind of authentic gay men they would be surrounded by. Soon we meet Michael Greer as their landlord who is a walking stereotype - he cooks, he likes opera, he quotes Maria Montez movies, he is effeminate, inconsiderate, vain, over-emotional, mysogynistic, and has poor taste, to boot. The fact that Greer emerged from this enterprise as a ""star"" to appear in Fortune and Men's Eyes and later doing his Bette Davis in The Rose years later, is probably testament to the kinds of roles gay men were stuck with at the time. Kessler belabours jokes about the campy decoration of the cottage eg a pink bedroom, statues of naked men (which Greer has done), having the two deceivers repeatedly receiving guests who demand a tour. There are also noticable pauses after each line, presumably for the laugh and to compensate for TV's ubiquitious laugh-track. However, not surprisingly, the laughs are few, unless you can listen to ""fag"" repeatedly, and the words ""normal"" and ""sick"" are also used unsubtlely. What did give me a laugh was the performance of Sebastian Cole as Greer's ""husband"" because he adopts a ridiculous vampire voice that has to be a put-on. We get a set-piece at a gay bar with the men reacting to a punch-up as if gay men never punch, and a party at Greer's place there is the suggestion of the spectrum of types amongst gays. There is a plot possibilty of one of the two deceivers being latently gay but this is soon dropped, and washed away with the excuse that any man who is promiscuous has problems. Kevin Coughlin probably works better as the ""straight"" man of the two, since he takes the whole thing seriously and doesn't play it for comedy like his buddy, Larry Casey. But then since Casey is the more physically attractive of the two (he spends most of the film with a bare chest), it is easier to accept their behavioural choices. One gets the sense that Casey would have a gay experience just to ""get off"". Kessler provides one amusing edit from a blown kiss to someone wiping their mouth with a napkin, but ends the film with a stupid cheap gag.",973987200,10,2692,4.575569358178054
1083868,4,6305836620,"Sure, it's a low-budget 1969 movie, but the absolutely pristine DVD mastering breathes new life into this underrated gay farce. The sound is a bit low and slightly scratchy, but heads and tails over the previous vhs  video release. It's like discovering a long-lost friend again! Try to  overlook the low-budget origins and some of the dated humor: It's still  very timely, courageous, and above all...FUNNY! For those who enjoy Michael  Greer's over-the-top flaming performance as the landylady Malcolm, check  out his performance as Queenie in ""Fortune And Men's Eyes""...very  different and fierce! Good statements in ""Gay Deceivers""  regarding anti-war sentiments and (believe it or not) gay rights. The two  straight roommates, posing as a gay couple, ultimately even have a greater  acceptance of alternate lifestyles by the film's end. Not to be missed!",963446400,25,859,5.350746268656716

1083997,3,6305836620,"""Gay Deceivers"" is a relic of the 60's. Send in the stereotypes, let hilarity reign. Cringe-worth at times for those who did not actually live through the decade. Mildly amusing for those who found ""The Boys In The Band"" ground-breaking for its time. Think of ""Gay Deceivers"""" as Freddie and Stewart's (""Vicious"") equivalent of a beach party pic. The real reason for the draft sergeant's surveillance is the ultimate plot twist.",1428883200,,428,5.042253521126761

1084000,1,6305836620,Truly dreadful.  It's circa 1969 portrayal of gay people is not surprising in that it's offensive.  I'm just astonished that anyone bothered to make this garbage available for streaming.,1412467200,4,186,5.379310344827586

1084002,3,6305836620,"Yes, it is an EXTREMELY dated movie, so don't even bother watching it if you're offended by the F-word or cringe-worthy stereotypes. However, I recommend people watch it just as a piece of gay history. I'm old enough to remember when this movie first came out. While no one considered a fine work of cinema, people were actually shocked and considered it cutting edge because it dealt with homosexuality in such an open way.

So, if you watch it, as we did recently, and you find your jaw dropping open more than you're laughing, just view it as a sign at how far we've come...and be grateful.",1398124800,10,593,4.542056074766355
1084003,3,6305836620,"Supposedly deceiving the State, potential conscripts formed a gay couple. Also a price was a lose of their jobs, happy end will eventually following and a military official who dismantled their plot would be uncovered for own preferences.

1084068,5,6305836620,The Gay Deceivers is a riot to watch. Made in the 1960's it naturally shows the homophobia that was accepted then. If you have an open mind you will enjoy this. The best actor is Michael Greer.  Luckily I got to see this in the theatre.,1368403200,3,236,4.130434782608695

They have to move in together in a gay Community of apartments, to throw off the ever watching Army induction officer and his staff.

1084073,3,6305836620,"I saw this film first run my freshman year in college. I probably was amused by it, since it is clever. Watching it again is a good lesson on how attitudes can change over time. The movies is 40 years old and tells the story of two straight men who want to avoid the Vietnam draft by acting gay. Michael Greer is the best in the film, he is gay and was able to be 'real' in the part. There is no heavy message here, more of a time capsule piece.",1216166400,8,445,3.901098901098901
1084074,5,6305836620,"This is a really fascinating  look at the gay culture or how it was perceived circa 1969. A lot of the flamboyant clothes, mannerisms, interior decorating and attitudes are a bit exaggerated for fun but like all satires they are based on some facts. It is hard to imagine that this movie was intended for a large commercial audience but it actually was. The Vietnam war by 1969 was as popular as the current US occupation of Iraq is today. But unlike todays quagmire young men were drafted and made to serve regardless if they wanted in or not.  All the characters and the ""types"" they represent get to be the butt of many a joke but the army gets it the worst in the movie although not really until the end. If you know any gay men from this time you will be in on a lot of insider jokes but there are lots a great moments in this movie to make it a pleasure. My favorite scene involves peonies and marigolds.",1208563200,3,910,4.254335260115607
1084075,2,6305836620,"It would be okay to be a little dated if the story and writing had been tighter, more interesting, and if the movie had a better ending. I kept expecting something to happen or some change to occur, but it pretty much just lurches on with a one-joke storyline until it runs out of steam and is mercifully over.

There are a couple good scenes and some interesting moments, but the story wanders all over the place and never finds it's rhythm. It's interesting for its time, but still sub-par.

This isn't really a ""gay movie"" as it's really about two straight men pretending to be gay, even though they are somewhat homophobic.  I guess it would have been too shocking to depict them as accepting, although they seem to make some progress toward the end.

Dated and not very involving or interesting (or funny.)  I'd avoid this one unless you like older movies and feel like tolerating the homophobia.",1116201600,9,901,4.60625
1084076,4,6305836620,I bought this movie trying to find something interesting and didn't expect to love it so much.  I have been on a search to find something as intriguing to me as The Adventures of Sebastian Cole and this was it.  Almost entirely due to the presence of Michael Greer.
