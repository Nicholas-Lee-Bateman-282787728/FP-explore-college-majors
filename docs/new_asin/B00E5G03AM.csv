5891233,5,B00E5G03AM,This combination of NickJr children's shows is perfect for my 3-year old granddaughter who loves Bubble Guppies and Team Umizoomi.  She was so excited with this video that she wanted to watch it several times instead of the holiday cartoons that were playing on television.,1386028800,2,273,5.066666666666666

5891236,4,B00E5G03AM,"This is an adorable DVD with both Bubble Guppies and Team Umizoomi.  I was a little bummed to see there was only three episodes on it but it is still DVD for kids who like those adorable Nickelodeon characters.  The DVD is just about an hour long in total and since its broken down into episodes its easy to watch just one or watch them all.  These are episodes that have been on tv so your child may have already seen them, but that doesn't bother my kids.

Bubble Guppies - Happy Holidays, Mr. Grumpfish!
Team Umizoomi - A Sledding Day
Team Umizoomi - City of Lost Penguins",1383782400,,575,4.296296296296297
5891237,1,B00E5G03AM,The shows are great.  The quality isn't very good and they are episodes that I could've just bought in previous seasons.,1383782400,,120,4.714285714285714
5891238,2,B00E5G03AM,"This half-hearted collection only includes three episodes from the popular Nick shows ""Bubble Guppies"" and ""Team Umizoomi"".  The first two (""Happy Holidays, Mr. Grumpfish"" and ""A Sledding Snow Day"") fit the bill: these chilly adventures are lightly educational and entertaining at times.  ""Team Umizoomi"" is definitely the weaker show, but since that episode follows the winter theme it's at least tolerable.  Unfortunately, the third episode (""City of Lost Penguins"") has very little to do with winter: a group of 50 penguins is scattered from the zoo and the team must rescue them using math, patterns, and all their typical tricks to outsmart The Trouble Makers.  So basically, there are three episodes (60 minutes total) and only about 40 minutes of snow.

In my opinion, only the ""Bubble Guppies"" episode is worth watching more than once, and the $15 price tag for what amounts to 60 minutes of cartoons is pretty much a rip-off.  If that weren't enough, these episodes (like most Nick DVDs) are cropped to ""full screen""...which is silly, because almost everyone has a widescreen TV, monitor or tablet by now (even Grandma!).  Only desperate relatives in need of a cheap stocking stuffer will settle for this collection; otherwise, leave it on the shelf.  There's no shortage of worthwhile holiday DVD/Blu-ray titles that give you much more bang for the buck.",1382745600,5,1364,5.112612612612613
5891239,5,B00E5G03AM,"This DVD contains three Winter Holiday themed episodes from the Bubble Guppies and Team Umizoomi.  Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:

1. Bubble Guppies - Happy Holidays, Mr. Grumpfish! - Mr. Grumpfish doesn't like the holidays, or does he?
2. Team Umizoomi - A Sledding Snow Day - UmiCar become UmiSled for sledding fun.
3. Team Umizoomi - City of Lost Penguins - Baby penguins escape and the team must rescue them.",1378684800,62,503,4.640449438202247

5891241,2,B00E5G03AM,"I'm disappointed. I bought this on Amazon Fire Stick thinking that it was a Bubble Guppies movie. I didn't realize that it is one Christmas themed episode of Bubble Guppies and one episode of Team Umi Zoomi. To make matters worse - it is not even a special edition episode of either one. The Bubble Guppies episode is the holiday episode from season one or two - and if it is from season one, season one is FREE through Prime.
No list of what the episodes are in the Prime description.
I feel ripped off.",1512691200,3,504,4.315789473684211
