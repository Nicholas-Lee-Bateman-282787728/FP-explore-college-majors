4989223,3,B006H5O918,"Seventh Cavalry, 1956 film

Captain Benson returns with his bride to Fort Lincoln. He notices something wrong from a distance. It is too quiet. What happened? A woman accuses him of absence. All those men who rode with Custer are dead, along with her husband Captain James Reynolds. He finds men drunk in the stables. They are ordered to duty. The flag is lowered to half-staff. The surviving troops return. The Sioux had Winchester 73 and lots of ammunition. Why did it happen? One man blames Custer. Captain Benson wasn't from West Point, he had been a river boat gambler. He was recruited by Custer as a scout. Colonel Kellogg will hold a court of inquiry. Should others have been there with Custer? Col. Kellogg with inquire into the disaster. Major Reno explains his orders to save his troops. Captain Benteen explains his actions. Are they trying to blame a dead man who can't defend himself?

Colonel Kellogg speaks to his daughter about Captain Benson. She hopes to marry Tom. Captain Benson testifies about his abstention. The President orders a burial detail. Benson asks for volunteers, some don't know this. They are watched as they move to the battlefield. Benson chases one Indian, they fight. [This provides action.] The troop continues to the battlefield in spite of warnings. Benson has another fight with a trooper. [More action.] Some troopers talk about a murder; it fails. One corporal was a witness to Custer's order to Benson. The troop arrives at the battlefield. Officers are placed in coffins, the others buried in place. [They were later reburied.] Many Indians arrive. ""I come in peace."" He explains their customs and beliefs. There is dissension among the troopers. Will there be another battle? The appearance of Custer's horse is like an omen. The troopers mount and ride off and return to the fort. Colonel praises Captain Benson for his actions.

Custer and two other captains were promoted to Brigadier General (brevet) in June 1863. Custer helped to win the Battle of Gettysburg in July by defeating JEB Stuart's ""Invincibles"". Custer won every battle he was in except his last one. He was considered a hero by Americans. In the 1950s there began a propaganda campaign to discredit him. You can see earlier movies how he was regarded. ""They Died With Their Boots On"" is still the best Hollywood movie. Custer was promoted to General at age 23, a record that stands today. He died at age 36, barely middle-aged. Robert M. Utley's book can educate you; there are others. Was he a ""vainglorious fool"" or a victim of President Grant's Indian policy of taking Indian lands for railroads and homesteaders? It is a political question. Custer and his wife Libby are buried at West Point.

This movie has some educational parts, but is not as good as ""TDWTBO"". It shows the Indians on horses without stirrups, historically correct. Did all the Indians have repeating rifles against the single-shot carbines of the Cavalry? You can learn more by reading a good history book than a Hollywood movie.",1375315200,2,3022,4.896484375

Unfortunately, the only copy available at the time I ordered is of very poor quality, both picture and sound, but I'll have to keep it for the time being. There are still too many Randolph Scott Westerns not available on CD, including some of his best, and this is a shame!
