2909397,3,B000TSJ04A,"Well done, in general.

The first part covers the part of the War of 1812 we seldom hear about: multiple botched American attempt to drive the British from Canada. This part was very interesting and accurate, much of the filming done on location at the actual battle sites.

The last third, however, covers the events relating to the British burning of Washington, the siege of Baltimore, the attack on Fort McHenry, and the Battle of New Orleans. These are the events familiar to most Americans, and the documentary apparently used a single source for this portion: 'The Campaigns of the British Army at Washington and New Orleans 1814-1815' written by G.R. Gleig, a British  Infantry Lieutenant who participated in these three campaigns ([...]).  Gleig's account is fascinating, but many of his facts are VERY wrong. For example, the trenches at New Orleans were NOT dug by slaves under the lash, but by a mixed group of citizens of all races and colors who wanted to prevent the British capture of New Orleans. For this work, Jackson insisted on paying everyone the same daily wage, infuriating some who insisted the Negro workers be paid less. There are many available contemporary sources, and many excellent historians of this war (ie Anthony Pitch) who could have ensured an accurate portrayal.

Personally, the most annoying aspect of the film was their playing an off-key version of 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic' whenever portraying President Madison or other American official.  Geez, guys, that's a Civil War song from 1860. Yankee Doodle --or-- Hail Columbia  --or-- any of a dozens songs would have been appropriate.

The History Channel's documentary of this war is much better.",1360627200,11,1696,5.0321428571428575
2909398,3,B000TSJ04A,"Has a tendency to be long and boring at times, so for me it didn't work. I'd prefer other makers of that part of our history.",1349481600,,125,3.8461538461538463
2909399,4,B000TSJ04A,"The bicentennial of the War of 1812 seems a fitting time to release a nicely balanced documentary covering the war in summary.  At two hours running time it's about the right length for use in classrooms or to learn more about an often confusing and forgotten war.  From experience I know that history teachers dread the War of 1812 as there were many reasons for it occurring, there were many parties involved in the fighting, the fighting was often inconclusive and not decisive, and the result at it's end was pretty much status quo ante bellum.  Perspectives on the war differ greatly amongst the participants as well.  Britons largely have no idea it occurred, focusing more on the larger Napoleonic conflict in Europe.  Americans know of it but not much else.  For Canadians it was the genesis of forming their national identity.  For Native Americans it was desertion by their British allies and the beginning of their decline in fortunes.

What particularly struck me was the inclusiveness of documentary as it included a diversity of voices from Canada, Britain, the United States, and Native Americans.  I was particularly delighted to see A. J. Languuth, one of my favorite authors, included along with other respected scholars which tells me that the research that went into this documentary was quite solid.  All too often documentaries on the subject tend to be a little too American-centric which is not only odd but depressing since much of the war took place on the Canadian front.  Touchy subjects like the burning of York (today's Toronto) are included as are the British allowing escaped slaves to take up arms against America; a topic that isn't well known to most people.  The reasons for the war are laid out quite well in an easy to grasp manner as is the odd give-and-take of the fighting along the Canadian border.  Interwoven are fascinating tales of the involvement of Native Americans on the side of the British, the inadequacy and unpreparedness of America to go to war, and how the war bankrupted America causing it to default on its debts.  The Hartford Convention effort is also addressed and that in particular was quite fascinating as it showed the fissures developing in American society that ultimately led to the Civil War were a long time coming and hardly unexpected.

Some aspects were certainly downplayed which was a bit disappointing, in particularly the campaign against the Creeks in Alabama and the earlier Patriot War in Florida. Most of the Native American commentators are from clans around the Great Lakes and the focus on that aspect of the war tends to be on those clans with no attention paid to the Creek or Cherokees.  The whole conflict in what was then the southwestern part of the United States is pretty much overlooked, which is a bit distressing as the United States was finally able to open up Alabama and Mississippi for settlement which meant the expansion of slavery and setting the stage for the Civil War.  The Patriot War of 1811 and the subsequent first Seminole War following the War of 1812 also chipped away at Britain's desire to hang on to Florida; in fact Britain's possession of Florida seems to be completely glossed over in this documentary for reasons unknown (they held it until 1819).  Yet overall the documentary presents things in an evenhanded manner, even the more horrific aspects of the war such as attacks on civilian population, and the very brutal scorched-earth nature that the prosecution of the war often took.  Overall ""The War of 1812"" is a very sophisticated, well balanced production that helps round out a basic understanding of the war on a most momentous anniversary.",1340928000,5,3668,4.896607431340873
2909400,5,B000TSJ04A,"I took the opportunity to watch this documentary a couple of nights ago.  As a history buff, living here in distant Australia, I knew about the 1812 War and about the Battle of New Orleans as well as the burning down of the White House.  I did not know about the American attempted invasions of Canada nor about the British intention to facilitate the creation of a confederated Native American buffer state.  The British also freed thousands of slaves and many of these joined the British/Canadian forces.

Had the British won that war, which the Americans started due to British naval blockades during the Napoleonic War, I think the history of the Americas and, indeed, the world as we know it would be very different.

I was thoroughly absorbed by the story and how it was told through expert commentary from American, Canadian, African American, British and Native American historians.  I also enjoyed the battle scene re-actments, the diaries of participants and the animations.  I doubt whether this production would be available for free to air television in Australia so I am glad I made the purchase.  For me, the program was an enlightment about a period of American and Canadian history I previously knew little about.",1324425600,46,1230,4.908212560386473
2909401,4,B000TSJ04A,"I didn't want to do a review of this until I watched the History Channel's outlook on this conflict, and after that, I made me feel that this deserves more attention, in terms of American Documentary's are concerned of this war. Some may not like the 'overwhelming' perspective of the war from Canada, or the majority of the people talking have British accents, but it's vital, considering the first two years of the war was fought in the west (at that time it was the west) and Canada (British North America). Some people may lead you to believe that this war was won on the spirit of America's prevail at Baltimore, and after New Orleans. They don't even talk about how the Native Americans were affected by this war, as they really were the true losers. This war gives you a pretty good perspective of how the war truthfully was fought. Those who get offended by the American's portrayal of constant losses are letting their patroitism impact their judgements on the war, and don't consider how the war is usually portayed as some sort of Second War of Independence, when Expansion, Trade, and Impressment were much more significant factors. The U.S.'s early blunders, and the impacts of the Native Americans (Tecumsuh as well) on the early part of the war are mentioned, as well. It also talks of Baltimore and New Orleans in a more objective way compared to that of THC (The History Channel). My only regret that isn't quite long enough, but that's a minor complaint.

This video is here to portray a much wider perspectives that most we Americans have on this war don't have, for whatever reason(s) that may be. And those who don't know much about it, if anything, needs to start here. And also reading does some good as well.",1323129600,15,1732,4.660130718954249
2909402,3,B000TSJ04A,"This latest documentary form PBS about the War of 1812 isn't bad--its just not nearly as good as the other PBS film from 2006' on the same subject called ""The War that made America"". I have both films and watched both twice. The other film just does everything better in my view from narration, to explanation of the causes of the war, to 'reenactors' and voice overs that fill out the film. I'd give this film (at half the length of TWTMA by the way)2.5 stars while the 06' film is a 5+.",1321660800,11,488,4.258064516129032
2909403,5,B000TSJ04A,"This 2 hour DVD presents a complete version of the War of 1812. It has English subtitles and no extras. It does use historians as `talking heads' but their pictured segments are brief enough to not be irritating.

One of the historical views that this film covers extensively is the wide-ranging fighting with Canada that occurred and is usually an afterthought in recounting the War of 1812.
Every aspect of the war is covered, the war at sea, Britain vs. Napoleon, the burning of Washington and the bombardment of Fort McHenry and the Battle of New Orleans; although these parts of the war could have been more detailed, they are well represented.

The conflict with Canada and what Canada remembers as their history and how this really made Canada a nation is all-encompassing in its' scope. The use of the Indian nations and the importance of Tecumseh is well detailed.
This was, as this DVD points out, in many instances a war that is forgotten but had wide ranging effects for the North American continent.  The effect on the Native Americans was tremendous. The good, the bad, the mistakes are all brought up. There are many reenactments and some use of period paintings to show the history of this war.

All of the legends and stories that one has heard seem to be included; Old Ironsides, Dolly Madison, even the Ballad of New Orleans is related and conveyed to help understand this war. This is probably the best all round pictured representation of the War of 1812 I have seen.",1318896000,98,1488,4.711538461538462
2909404,5,B000TSJ04A,"Other reviewers have dinged this video for its Canadian origin and bias.  Since every narrative has a point of view, I look at the Canadian perspective as a pro and not a con.  The War of 1812 is not well taught in schools in the US. The expansionist nature of this war was downplayed in school. I'm kind of a history buff, but I was unable to explain the war to my son, so I checked out this video from the library and started some reading.  This video suggests that the desire to annex Canada was the main purpose for the US in declaring war on England.  It's not that simple, but to the extent that's true, the War of 1812 was certainly not a victory for the US. The real losers of the war were the Native Americans. The First Nations cast their lot with the British, and the British, perhaps by necessity, abandoned them to end the war.  The fact that the tribes actively fought against the Americans meant that there was no sympathy for them when the landgrab to the west began in earnest.",1280534400,13,994,4.294117647058823
2909405,2,B000TSJ04A,"Well first I was very disappointed to find out that this is more of a story telling documentary type production than an entertaining movie based upon historical fact.  This made for a pretty boring product in my opinion.  This looks like a low budget effort as there are only a hand full of characters and you only see them every once in a while.  This is mostly third party narration while we get to look at pictures and artists renditions which are supposed to enhance the story but fail miserably.

Next, I thought the documentary was heavily biased and put all the blame for the conflict on the United States.  Only after watching the first part and seeing the credits did I find out that this documentary was a product of the National Film Board of Canada.  I guess that explains the bias part.

Anyway, in my opinion this isn't worth spending your money on.  There are many other better historical based war films out there.",1272067200,8,930,4.5602409638554215
2909406,5,B000TSJ04A,"Although I've already seen this topic in the THC (The History Channel) version, the part about the war with Canada is neglected there. I'm happy to see this film detailing this aspect.

Since the U.S. are not well prepared for the war, the invasion to Canada is quite embarrassing. Five attemps are all repulsed by the Indian-Canadian(British) alliance. The Michigan Territory is even occupied and is prepared for the Indians. The U.S. learn from failures and improve gradually. Finally, they hold and win some crucial battles and reach the agreement of the negotiation.

The Canadian do an excellent job to defend their land. Their later invasion to the U.S., however, is defeated. Overall, they are still the winner and earn their pride and nationalism. The British humiliate the U.S. by burning down the Washington, but failed in Fort McHenry and then are vastly defeated in New Orleans(truce has been assgined, but not reaching the battlefield yet).

Although the U.S. do win some battles, they are not the winner of this war since many goals are not achieved as planned. They, however, learn the lesson from the war and it contributes much later.

The most unfortunate in this war should be the Indians. They are abandoned by the British in the war and can't make their dream come true. Even today, their contribution to the Canada is not fully recognized.

The strength of this film is the Canadian campaign, which is detailed. For other parts, the THC version gives you more information. In my opinion, it will be a good idea to have a balanced view by seeing both this one and the THC version.",1203811200,24,1601,4.828467153284672

Some people are complaining that there is too much content about the Canadian side of the conflict but I thought it was well balanced.  I'm guessing those reviewers can't wrap their heads around the fact that the USA have not been the victors in every single war since the country was founded or that wars are fought between two sides both of which should be included in any documentary.  The war of 1812 ended in stalemate so neither side really won, but technically there is a 3rd side that lost (a lot unfortunately) but I won't spoil that for you and let you find that out from the documentary.

2909553,5,B000TSJ04A,"The PBS production of the War of 1812 between the U.S. and the British Empire is the superior of the two major ones that have been made. The other production, produced by the History Channel, almost has the same depth as most American primary/secondary school text books. Like those books, the History Channel's production makes no mention of the problems that plagued the American war effort in the north. The PBS version does not shy away from these topics. Based on the slant of the discussion, it is likely that the scripts had been written by Canadians rather than Americans. Having Graham Greene host and narrate the production seems to lend more weight to this assumption. Americans are notorious about glossing over their failures. With the explanation of the American foray into Upper Canada, near the modern city of Toronto, what happened later in Washington, D.C. becomes enlightened. While I, like some of the other reviewers would have liked a longer production, this one is still very comprehensive. For those willing to read more on the topic, I would recommend Union 1812: The Americans Who Fought the Second War of Independence by A.J. Langguth.

Loaded with many unknown facts like the famed Battle of New Orleans that was ACTUALLY fought after the War was over, this film is an eye-opener. Follow the reenactments as they relive this war that we very nearly lost!",1363305600,,353,4.53125

8210683,2,B000TSJ04A,"This was one of the most frustrating dvd's I have ever watched. Well written and produced, accompanied by excellent commentary by notable historians. But the sound, the sound is horrendous.  Whenever the music comes up, the commentary dissolves into mumbling.  The music truly overpowers the spoken word.  It is good music but the balance is completely nonexistent.  It drowns out the spoken word.  At times, during the historian commentary the music mercifully stops. But then, doggone it, it starts right back up again. Just when I was about to turn it off and give it up, halfway through the thing, the sound suddenly comes into much better balance.  Why the heck they didn't go back and correct  the sound balance of the entire production I have no idea.  Such good information but if you show this to a class full of people you will lose them in the first fifteen minutes due to the terrible soundtrack during the first half of the dvd.",1522108800,,941,4.730061349693251

If you buy into that, you'll enjoy this.  If you know your history, you won't.",1517702400,,251,4.391304347826087
8210687,5,B000TSJ04A,"I've only watched the first episode thus far, but I find this to be a fantastic documentary.  Some of the camera work is dated, but they do a great job in both bringing the characters of the war to life, while also presenting a lot of information.  I get the feeling this is why this war was just kind of glazed over in my history classes.",1511827200,,339,4.121212121212121
