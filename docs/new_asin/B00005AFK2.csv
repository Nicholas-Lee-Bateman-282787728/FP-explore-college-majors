3712601,5,B00005AFK2,"I saw Pat Benatar and Neil Giraldo in person this past summer and they were awesome.  Pat Benatar can still sing her hits beautifully.  It was like I was 30 years younger for a short time.  If you like Pat Benatar at all, I don't think there is any thing better to spend a relatively small amount of money on.  Great show.",1475798400,,322,4.145161290322581

3712607,5,B00005AFK2,This concert by Pat Benatar was thoroughly enjoyable. Spider (Neil Geraldo/ Pat's husband) is still great on the lead guitar and Pat's voice and beauty is as great today as it has always been.,1466553600,,192,4.676470588235294

3712620,5,B00005AFK2,"I will begin by saying that I wasn't a huge Pat Benatar fan.  I liked Crimes of Passion and a few songs here and there.  I read some reviews on this album and show and decided to check it out.  WOW!!  Pat can still sing.  I always thought that Neil was underrated as a guitarist and this show proves it.  The band is extremely tight.  You can tell that Pat and Neil are having fun.  The crowd is having fun.  This is just a great show.  Sorry for the spoiler, but one of my favorite parts was when the broke into Ring of Fire by Johnny Cash during the encore.  Great show by a great band.  Count me as a new fan.",1436572800,,612,3.9262295081967213

3712627,5,B00005AFK2,Got to see Pat & Neil in my neighborhood for this Tour...Great familiar songs/hits and after 35 years they still give solid Rock performances!!! Pat IS the bad ass of Rock..she can still sing her tush off which not many can do.....love this collection.,1432684800,,252,4.75
3712628,5,B00005AFK2,"I saw them in concert Friday May 8. at the Capital theater in Port Chester. It was an amazing show and they were on the money in every possible way.
I was able to purchase a hand signed copy of this DVD at the show and it is a perfect rendition of what they performed that evening.
We watched it the next day and relived the experience of having seen them, and it was fantastic. Beautifuly shot, great sounding and a tremendous grouping of wonderful music. If you are considering getting this DVD, don't even hesitate.",1431302400,,518,4.40625
3712629,5,B00005AFK2,"INCREDIBLE show captured on video and cd!  Pat sounds unbelievable.  Having just seen Pat and Neil in concert a few days ago, this DVD is just like being at the show again!  Fans, do not hesitate in buying this.... Better yet, get the 2 CDs-DVD combo like I did!",1430524800,,262,4.3061224489795915

(if u are too, then, yes that's me your always fighting for all the rare awesome stuff at your favorite collectors online retail chain...ha!) But seriously  this show was incredible. A huge live set from Pat and Spyder. There is a couple amazing songs on here for even the big fans they haven't played in quiet some time.

3712632,1,B00005AFK2,"I want my money back!! The disc did not play. I sent it to a relative as a birthday gift and was so embarrassed when they returned it because there was nothing on it. I gave my review 1 star because that was the only way to get to the review area. I paid to ship the disc to New York, and my cousin paid to ship it back to me. I have purchased many items on Amazon and am so disappointed with this experience. How do I get my money back?",1397001600,,437,3.760869565217391
3712633,5,B00005AFK2,"I first encountered the MJQ in about 1960, saw them perform several times in the SF Bay Area -- John Lewis was a wonderful composer and a very subtle pianist, and Milt Jackson simply couldn't play a note that didn't swing.  In one sense this video is boring because they just stood there and played -- no flamboyance whatsoever -- but man could they play!",1389830400,,355,4.461538461538462
3712634,5,B00005AFK2,Never again will there be a jazz quartet with such internal rapport to produce this kind of magic.  They do great solos and great comps for the other soloists.,1370476800,,159,4.482758620689655
3712635,5,B00005AFK2,"I rented this DVD a couple of weeks ago and was so taken by it that I just had to buy it at Amazon.
I think I will never grow tired of watching and hearing this beautifully done video of this concert performed in Germany in 1987.
This DVD includes some of the best works of the MJQ, and to see these four classy, talented and dedicated players, captured forever in time, even though each of them has gone on to join that big band in the sky, produces a blend of both happiness and sadness every time I watch it. Happy to see and hear them again, and so sad that they are no longer with us.
From the bluesy, swinging ""Django"" that was one of John Lewis's early pieces that I have loved forever, to his later day composition ""A Day In Dubrovnik"", a moving dramatc composition with classical overtones. Listen to the last two movements especially of this piece, they are to beautiful to describe.
I feel almost compelled to invite guest in to my den at home to share this video, so they can absorb the wonder of this fantastic performance and music and gain a greater appreciation of this great music enjoyed by so few of us.
Long Live The Music of John Lewis, Milt Jackson, Percy Heath and Connie Kay, the members of the MJQ. The likes of them will never come along together in one group again, but thank God, we still have their beautiful music.
We really miss them.",1271462400,,1365,4.315175097276264
3712636,5,B00005AFK2,"Many of the musician in the dvd are long gone but, the music is a wonderful testament to their musicianship.  If you want to have a real modern experience then this dvd is a must have.",1255305600,,184,4.111111111111111
3712637,5,B00005AFK2,"This is a truly great disc. Wonderful jazz by the legends!
The M.J.Q. really gel at this concert. One number alone,
""Echoes"" is worth the cost of this disc. The rest of the tunes are an added bonus!",1222560000,,198,4.2368421052631575
3712638,5,B00005AFK2,While MJQ's 35th Anniversary Tour DVD features standard jazz in bebop this 40th Anniversary Tour DVD features 5 songs with arrangements reminiscent of Gill Evans'work. This disk compliments the other nicely. Both audio (DTS) and video quality are good and both concerts are well recommended for purchase.,1195862400,,304,5.48936170212766
3712639,5,B00005AFK2,"There is some sadness in watching this wonderful concert DVD of the MJQ recorded in 1987 at a jazz festival in Freiburg, Germany, because they are all gone now. Percy Heath, the elegant bassist, was the last to die, just last year (2005), John Lewis only four years before that. This group grew out of the rhythm section of the 1940s and 50s Dizzy Gillespie band. Their official founding was in 1952 but they had been playing together unofficially for some time before that. The combination of Milt Jackson's bebop vibraphone and John Lewis's classically restrained piano, backed by Heath on bass (was there ever a bassist who was so consistently in tune?) and Connie Kay on drums, was an unforgettable sound. I came to this group from a completely classical background, attracted by its gentle persuasion, and it has been one of my favorite groups for almost fifty years now. John Lewis managed to put classical forms and techniques to use in his numbers, such as 'A Day in Dubrovnik' included in this concert, and that was my 'hook' into this group's distinctive style.

For those of you familiar with the group's repertoire it might be helpful to know what pieces they play here. They are Ellington's 'Rockin' in Rhythm', Jackson's 'Echoes', Lewis's 'Kansas City Breaks' (I particularly like this one because I lived in KC for forty years), 'Django', 'Summertime', 'Bags' Groove' (Milt Jackson's nickname was 'Bags'), and 'A Day in Dubrovnik'. To quote what someone once said about Milt Jackson, but applied by me to the whole group: 'If [they] ever did once play a non-swinging note, it must have been in private.'

The music of four distinguished looking gentlemen in tuxedos calmly playing with all the dignity of a classical string quartet is a way into jazz for anyone reading this review who is unfamiliar with the genre, and I'd advise them to get this DVD and begin enjoying one of the great groups of all time, and at the top of their game. And for those of you who already know the MJQ's work, no recommendation is needed other than to tell you that this is neatly filmed and recorded and is a marvelous example of this great group's work.
