7553624,2,B018KARDI8,"Don't know why cos I love Bollywood movies but this one was just not good; it looked like it should be good, could be good, but it kept turning me off over and over and I'm groaning, ""Oh, India, don't turn into this superficial, flashy money princess blah blah blah stupid humor horrible and 'unbelievable cruel stepmother..., awful acting, so fake. Even the great Shahid Kapoor couldn't shine enough to keep my interest. I like sweet movies, I don't need a fabulous storyline, ... but this was just really not a good movie in my opinion. Lacked class, cultural uniqueness, good acting, believe-ability, I could go on and on. If I hadn't seen so many good, even if medium / ordinary but sweet and great Indian films, even then I couldn't like this; but it was especially disappointing as I see this trend developing of mindless downhill empty fake movies coming out lately, something like Om Shanti Om, where even great stars don't have a chance to shine. But that's just me. Maybe some will like it, who knows. Age group 11-13?",1464912000,2,1028,4.653846153846154

7553628,5,B018KARDI8,"This movie is The BOMB! It will go down in my video collection as The modern day Bollywood version of Animal House, with a twist of Mushrooms! (This is not for kids) it's also not your typical, corny, sappy singing dancing cliche movie. The music in this is fantastic as well! Get your friends together, and watch this!!! BEST COMEDY OUT OF BOLLYWOOD, EVER!",1474156800,3,357,4.59375

7553633,2,B018KARDI8,Very weak script. Funny moments are few and far between. Definitely a lousy soundtrack. You'd think that Shahid Kapoor and Alia Bhatt would be more choosy about the scripts they accept... Not worth watching.,1468972800,,207,5.117647058823529
