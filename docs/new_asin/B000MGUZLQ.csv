8169220,3,B000MGUZLQ,"I might like this video better if the actual video part was there - seriously, I'm listening to the lady talk but the video keeps fluctuating between fuzzy black and white and no video signal at all. The production values seem pretty low when the rare moments of imagery do pop up - I wonder if way back wherever it originated from someone just dubbed it from tape to tape (it seems like it started as an old VHS) and maybe it was partly magnetized by accident?

Other than that the video does seem to dwell a lot on festivals and side-stories that, while, nice, seem to keep it off topic for a bit too long. I think some maps and lists to lead-in and/or summarize would've helped me, but maybe that's just my personal learning style.",1273795200,,734,4.357664233576642
8169221,5,B000MGUZLQ,"I've been searching across the globe for DVD's on wine and winemaking, and thanks to Amazon this briliant work of art has hit the ticket. Fair enough the technology used to produce both DVD,s dosen't do its content justice but the insight, history, and general information about Italian wines and its regions is a must for any wine enthusist. As an amateur wine maker (with an Italian background), the scenes of vingerons unloading their crop straight into the crusher, and seeing the wine pouring into demijohns made me feel like grabbing my passport, jump on a plane and giving them a hand.",1196640000,,592,4.813725490196078
8169222,4,B000MGUZLQ,"Sure, it is a series of TV episodes linked together to form a full length DVD, but Come on! It is only $9! There is a lot of information, pretty scenery, and stops at various wine regions. I know the sound quality is kinda poor, but Come on! It is only $9! COME ON!",1178841600,,265,3.925925925925926
