1919024,2,B0000CEUY8,This was the worst Tai Chi dvd I have ever had the misfortune to experience.  About the only thing this is good for is putting you to sleep!,1080604800,2,140,4.0
1919025,3,B0000CEUY8,"I found the information about the history of Tai Chi offered on this dvd to be very informative. However, I found the dvd cumbersome to navigate, getting to the actual long form part took forever. Also, as a learning tool I was quite disappointed. If you already know the long form and just want a dvd to practice with, this may be for you, but if you are trying to learn it, I suggest you look elsewhere.",1079740800,27,405,4.2727272727272725
1919026,5,B0000CEUY8,"I began practicing T'ai Chi fifteen years ago.  My first teacher was trained from childhood in China, then Taiwan, in the strict classical Yang Long Form.  I began studying with him years later in a major U.S. city -- still Yang Long Form, still classical approach.  That was a magical time, a magical experience that will be a part of me for the rest of my life.
Periodic long-distance moves have since interrupted my study several times, but these have also required me to study with teachers of quite a few T'ai Chi styles and levels of expertise.  Some were more fun, some more ""practical,"" some much more ""martial"" in approach, and some were sadly ""lightweight.""
Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming's video is truly ""the real deal.""  From the first frame of his performance of the entire Form, I was instantly transported back to my first Teacher's class:  not only is the sequence of postures and connecting movements EXACTLY the same as where I began, but the ""spirit"" and ""feel"" of T'ai Chi is also the same as it was then.  With the wide range of styles and emphases in my classes since, I'd nearly forgotten how ""pure"" and powerful the classical Yang form truly is!
Other reviews here have accurately described and appropriately praised the comprehensive contents and unsurpassed structure of this wonderful video that is at once a marvelous teaching tool and a true archival record of this ancient art.
I'll summarize my opinion this way:
If you EVER outgrow this DVD, please produce one of your own, so we can all study with you!
Meanwhile, I'm gonna hang with Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming!!",1065225600,284,1580,4.7655677655677655

1919034,5,B0000CEUY8,It is a very good book. It is the answer to my need in practicing good tai chi.,1428451200,,79,3.4444444444444446
1919035,5,B0000CEUY8,Gave me a good understanding of what Tai Chi is and where it comes from,1424131200,,71,3.8
1919036,3,B0000CEUY8,"While generally I like Yang's explanation of Tai Chi, the camera angles on some of the moves are hard to follow. I had one teacher who filmed from front and back and it was enormously helpful. Some of these are harder to follow. But Yang is a very skilled practictioner and thoughtful teacher.",1421625600,2,293,4.547169811320755
1919037,5,B0000CEUY8,"A classic on its own, the depth of the concepts are explained in a very graphical way. I use it everyday",1418947200,,104,4.0
1919038,5,B0000CEUY8,I need to listen and do this DVD's information more often on my own. It is an interesting subject and this instructor can fill in gaps or add to my instructor's classes.,1418601600,,169,4.3125
1919039,1,B0000CEUY8,Not quite Kosher as far as what I was exposed to years back.  Don't be fooled.,1410739200,,78,3.875
1919040,3,B0000CEUY8,"I will say this, I like a lot of his writing. He is a great resource for Chinese to English texts.

There are two things wrong with this DVD. The first is this is not Tai Chi Chuan as the main stream learns it. In this case this is not a good thing. He has so modified his form that I would really say this is not Tai Chi Chuan anymore. (source: Grandmaster Chen Xiaowang Five Levels of Taijiquan) Why has he done this? I do not know. Recently he was reunited with his teacher and we now know who was the teachers of his teacher. His teacher was at a gathering not too long ago, and was filmed. Many watched with great interest, and to everyone's surprise I am to understand his Taijiquan looked fairly standard with everyone else's. Nothing like the modified form of Dr. Yang. (I have not verified this myself yet)

This is the second point. This ""classical form"" is not in fact from Yang Ban-Hou lineage. There are in fact people still in the lineage of Yang Ban-Hou, and videos around from teachers who's time has past. (source: Erle Montaigue 1949-2011 taijiworld.com) That was the reason for getting this video to compare to the one I have from Erle. The fact is that Dr. Yang is like most of us in the lineage of Yang Cheng-Fu so the title is misleading at best. (It is not even first or second alterations)

For those of you claiming that Dr. Yang ""never claimed he was in Yang Ban-Hou's lineage"" If this was the case Dr. Yang would have clarified this issue long ago. On this DVD one of the narrators says just that, and Dr. Yang never would have allowed his employees to let such a mistake past the editing phase of production. The title would mislead us as well.",1406678400,4,1672,4.335463258785943
1919041,1,B0000CEUY8,"Hard to follow, not clear instructions, and the demonstrator was erratic and hard to watch.
He is so exaggerated you can barely follow the core stances and movements",1398124800,2,165,4.928571428571429
1919042,3,B0000CEUY8,I found it hard to see the movements clearly enough to perform them. I also found the background music harsh. I would have preferred flute music or something more gentle.,1391040000,,170,4.7
1919043,5,B0000CEUY8,"This Tai Chi instructional is unlike others I have seen on the market. In fact I have never seen any martial arts instructional that includes an amazing classroom lecture with a whiteboard. Dr Yang, Jwing Ming is a great lecturer in this respect, and I felt I was back at university. What does he lecture about? Tai Chi theory. Where it comes from, why we have it wrong about Tai Chi Chuan, the relationship between Wu Ji, Qi power, the Mind and the Fist, connecting the dots between Chinese energy theories and everyday Physics and Biochemistry. For me personally, I enjoyed this lecture and it is a great reference I can go back to again and again.

Overall, the viewer will enjoy a great wealth of information with this DVD. The content includes exercises to loosen up and warm up you can easily follow. Taiji Qigong exercises, the complete Yang style long form, Taijiquan 13 Postures and much more are all presented on this great DVD. There is also a lot of reading material in the Additional Content section. Dr Yang does not hold back on information at all, and provides analysis for the movements in terms of their martial applicability. Again, this is something that I would say is rare in a martial arts instructional DVD.

Content is top-notch, production values are high quality, and the volume of information will keep you coming back for more. Highly recommended.",1388448000,,1376,4.7531380753138075
1919044,4,B0000CEUY8,"This DVD needs some editing, but the errors are a learning experience as is the whole presentation, which serves not only to teach the 113 movements of Yang Style Tai Chi Chuan but also to teach Tai Chi Qi Gong, and it provides an introduction to the Chinese language through both pin yin and Chinese characters for names and other relevant terms and through pronunciation, and its menus and segmentation permit adjusting one's approach to one's particular needs.",1384041600,,463,4.948717948717949
1919045,5,B0000CEUY8,"this is a great guide to yang style. has many elements that are ussually missed in guides to martial arts. It is really not for anyone who has had no exposure to martial arts but will be great for someone who has had training and is interested in this style. there are some gaps that previous knowledge will fill.

But with that being said there is so much information covered in this guide that you will want previous experience to prevent info overload.deals with philosophy of the movements, demonstration of the exersizes, combat applications. fajing, and the over philosophy of yang style tai chi",1379548800,,601,4.778846153846154
1919046,5,B0000CEUY8,"This is a grate book for tai chi, it goes over the long form and applications. It is grate for bettering your understanding of tai chi. This is best for someone working with a teacher and actively learning the art there is lots of good information in this book.

1919048,3,B0000CEUY8,"I've taken a couple of Tai Chi classes and I bought this so that I could learn to become a better practitioner of the art. Unfortunately, I can't seem to get into learning from a DVD. I think this DVD is fine even though I don't use it very often. I guess I just learn better in a hands on classroom setting.",1368921600,,308,3.9838709677419355

1919050,5,B0000CEUY8,"Love it but if you are impatient and demand results right away, this book is not for you.  It is a discipline and takes years to learn to do the form properly.  I have been building the foundation to do the forms and my legs are extremely sore.  I was in Karate for many years and this form has the potential to be much more powerful as a martial art then any other art that I have tried.",1362873600,,388,3.948717948717949
1919051,5,B0000CEUY8,"Tai Chi Chuan practice always pays close attention to foundations.  This is a great foundational DVD.  It provides a great warm-up rotine and an analysis and presentation of the postures of the form.  Also, there is a section that analyses the most basic and repeated movements in the form and how they relate to self-defense.  This gives the practioner a sense of what each posture in the form is inteneded to be doing as one practices the form.  It would take a beginner quite a while to become proficient in just this foundational stuff, but by the time one did become proficient at it, one's Tai Chi practice could easily move into more advanced stuff without running into set-backs.",1360713600,,687,4.739495798319328
1919052,5,B0000CEUY8,"I previously bought Dr. Yang's shorter video and it was a great starter. This one will take me a long time to work through as there is so much information. It takes a little while to understand how to find all of the subtle details but the search is worth it. I also have the book that compliments the video.

Dr. Yang has worked with my Sifu and I am looking forward to my Tai Chi workouts even more than before.",1353110400,,413,4.098765432098766
1919053,5,B0000CEUY8,a great master! i was quite embarrassed after watching. i have been practicing a bit of tai chi with other source and this is just amazing material far more superior than anything i've ever seen. thank you. highly recomended,1298332800,2,224,4.769230769230769
1919054,1,B0000CEUY8,"This is not a beginners DVD and the arrangement of chapters is confusing and discouraging to anyone who wants to learn tai chi. There is no real instruction here that is directed toward the viewer. The viewer is treated more like a voyeur than pupil. Spare me the ""You can only truly learn by attending lessons from a qualified instructor"" nonsense. Yes, having an instructor is preferred, but since that isn't possible a DVD should make every effort to explain the movements step by step and this one doesn't do that. There are lots of chapters but it is never said where you should begin or how to use the video. You may say, ""Well, start from the beginning!"" I tried that and I can't tell what is the beginning. The first thing you see is a lecture on tai chi, and wu jin, etc with the teacher at a whiteboard. That may be nice for people seeking the deeper aspects of the art but not a beginner who just wants to be eased into the thing and given some simple direction. I am experienced in martial arts but my wife isn't and knows nothing about tai chi so I used her as a barometer for a true beginner experience. She hated it. FOR $30 IT SHOULD BE A BETTER VIDEO WITH BETTER INSTRUCTION. There are cheaper videos that do a far better job. I have the Terry Dunn video on VHS and it is superior to this if you are a true beginner and not a devotee of taichi and Yang Jwing Ming fan. Even the David Carradine videos are better as an instructional. While this DVD has a lot of content it does very little to clarify what is happening with each movement and where to begin or how to work your way through it. I respect the instructor and his reputation but this was not good. I want to return it and get something I can use.",1297900800,17,1724,4.2272727272727275
1919055,4,B0000CEUY8,"I had a hard time following this DVD, it is not for beginners, and the layout is complicated. It is a great video in regards to the instructer, and contents, but I had no idea how to follow along.",1280188800,2,196,4.051282051282051
1919056,4,B0000CEUY8,This video is very easy to follow if you already know some basic moves.  Has been very helpful in advancing in Tai Chi.,1249257600,3,119,4.173913043478261
1919057,5,B0000CEUY8,This video was everything I was looking for in a Tai Chi video.  The filming was very good with a good view of each move so as to be able to learn and master this form.  Thanks,1228003200,3,176,3.72972972972973
1919058,5,B0000CEUY8,"I initially found this dvd a little confusing to navigate, but once i figured out how to get to the actual set,it is great. These are exactly the moves I learned, but with loads of information about each one. I think I would have been overwhelmed as a beginner, but i have been studying Tai chi for at least 10 years now, and I love the depth this dvd goes into.

1919059,4,B0000CEUY8,"This DVD is great, Dr. Yang seems like a real expert, not some new-age wannabe.

I learned quigong from it successfully, but honestly had trouble following the moves in Taijiquan. I think if you really want to learn it you may need to go to a class.

But for a DVD this seems really great.",1203379200,3,289,4.236363636363636
1919060,3,B0000CEUY8,This DVD will give you an very good understanding of the Yang Style of Tai Ji and includes many Tai Ji Chi Kung exercises to deveolp chi power to use in daily life and in fighting applications.,1173312000,7,193,4.243243243243243
1919061,5,B0000CEUY8,"Having owned the videotape of this offering from Dr. Yang, I was a little apprehensive about spending money to buy the DVD.  I was very satisfied with the information offered on the VHS tape, but having already owned the material, it didn't make sense to purchase a DVD unless there was something added to the material.

Generally, when a company releases a DVD of a previously released VHS tape, there is very little added to the DVD release.  Fortunately, in line with the high quality of YMAA publications, this DVD has approximately two hours of material that was not on the original VHS.

Combine this with the ease of access that a DVD offers and the Taijiquan, Classical Yang Style DVD becomes even more of a bargain.

The video offers material and instruction for the following:

The Taijiquan Thirteen Postures

The Fundamental 8 Stances

Taiji Qigong, with stretching and three sets taught

The Yang Style Taijiquan sequence (The long form)

The video also has an extensive lecture on Taijiquan Theory by Dr. Yang as well as a demonstration of Fa Jing and a list of all the movements of the long form.

The lecture is vital to anyone who wants to learn Taijiquan.  Merely imitating the postures and movements, which sadly is how many people practice Taijiquan, without an understanding of the philosophy from which Taijiquan developed, would severely limit one's experience.

Dr. Yang discusses how Taiji is between Wuji (nothingness) and yin and yang.  This concept is extremely important and vital to the performance and practice of Taijiquan.  When you begin the form, you should stand in a beginning posture which represents Wuji, or nothingness/emptiness, during which you settle the body, relax the breath and bring all the parts of your body and mind into this Wuji state.

Then the thought/intention is born in the mind and the Taiji (which came from the Wuji) splits into the yin and yang.  The dead hands and body, maximum yin, become alive and slowly inflate and expand to a balance between maximum yin and maximum yang, along with the whole body.  Now the form begins.

I see many practitioners walk up, stand still for one second and leap into the form without any understanding of where yin and yang spring from.  The transition from Wuji to Taiji to the interplay of yin and yang is one of the more fulfilling and engaging aspects of Taijiquan.

Dr. Yang points out that Taiji, the theory of which is explained so well in this video, has been around for approximately four thousand years, whereas Taijiquan has been around for perhaps a thousand years.  The use of this theory in Daoism is also explained by Dr. Yang.  The link between Taijiquan and Daoism  through their mutual use of the philosophy of Taiji was one of the initial reasons for my interest in learning Taijiquan.

Dr. Yang goes on to illustrate through the use of scientific formulas the relationship of Taijiquan and the laws of physics.  This lecture is just the preparation to begin to use the other parts of the video.  Too many times tapes are presented by martial artists with little thought for tying it all together and explaining the meaning of what is offered.  This video is extremely well thought out and presents the viewer with a strategic approach that will enable them to go far in their quest to learn Taijiquan.

Throughout the video there are visual clues as to when to inhale and when to exhale while doing the form or the Taijiquan Qigong.  The demonstration of the long form offers detailed instructions when you click on the yin-yang symbol.

I would have to write a ten page review to give justice to all the material presented on this DVD.  A wonderful addition to Dr. Yang's presentations and a worthwhile purchase even if you already own the VHS version of this video.",1157155200,75,3787,4.7784615384615385
1919062,3,B0000CEUY8,"The video starts with some interesting theory and a good demo of the warm ups but the main instruction seems to lack the level of detail that I find in Terry Dunn's videos. Also, at some places, they just have subtitles on the screen with no audio commentary and that makes it difficult to follow the video as you are split between trying to read the subtitles and following the movement of the demonstrator. Would not recommend this if your main interest is in getting instruction on the actual doing of tai chi. Agree with a review that says that this may not be right for beginners.",1144972800,13,585,4.4766355140186915
1919063,5,B0000CEUY8,"This is by far the best instructional dvd I have ever bought or seen, best value for my money, I'm not saying it's cheap, but it has enough information to fill 4 dvd's (which is regretfully what every one else in this industry is doing). It deals with the complete Yang style taijiquan form and chigong, thoroughly (novice to advanced), but then it is so much more. It is great on its own but it is even better with the book by same title (see my review). You can start by watching Dr Yang's lecture which in itself is a great bonus, but essentially the dvd takes you from stretching and qigong excercizes to a detailed breakdown of the complete Yang style taijiquan form. Additionally you'll be able to observe master Yang perform the form at various speeds (there's even an introduction to Fa Jing). There's even more but I don't want to spoil it all for you. Like I said before, this is no substitute to real lessons but instead is the best tool you can find to help you improve faster and with solid reliable background(basic to essential) information.",1142812800,28,1056,4.534031413612565
1919064,5,B0000CEUY8,"This is a great video if you are really interested and are currently looking to expand your already intermediate knowledge of taichi...not really for beginner,s although there are many, many points that would be helpful to a beginner. Good production, not a cheesy house wife version of tai chi...",1141257600,10,297,5.081632653061225
1919065,4,B0000CEUY8,"Very good work. Serious, professional and compreensive.

Many kinds of explainations and forms of presentation of the content. It's a very didactical approach.

Very recomended for beginners.",1140739200,8,191,6.037037037037037
1919066,5,B0000CEUY8,"This video is excellent. The moves of all Tai Chi styles look different of course, even the same style can look different when done by different students. Tai Chi has been taught person-to-person for centuries: of course the moves will be different as each person changes it slightly. Often when you see Tai Chi, you are seeing a form that has been modified repeatedly by many generations of students.

The Tai Chi of Dr Yang is very authentic, and I believe it is very close to its martial arts origin. Each move has a practical martial art application, which is very important, and also quite rare nowadays. Based on Dr Yang's scholarly research in the field, I trust that his Tai Chi is the closest form to how Yang style was originally intended to be.

The DVD navigation is second to none. It says in the credits that the program was originally filmed in Europe, about 10 years ago. The lighting is good, and the program has a nice mood/great music. This is not flashy 'tai chi on the beach'- it is a demonstration in a classroom by a very traditional master. His 'theory seminar' in the beginning is amazing! The DVD is easy to learn from, although with 4 hours of content, it will take years to assimilate it all. Excellent program.",1131667200,16,1239,4.551569506726457
1919067,3,B0000CEUY8,"I own several Tai Chi DVD's, and have taken Tai Chi classes at a couple of different places; having said that, the moves in this video are different than I have seen anywhere else.  Grasp the Sparrow's Tail, for example, looks very strange in this video.  I understand that Dr. Yang is a Shaolin White Crane expert, so perhaps his Taijiquan is influenced by his martial arts background, anyway it is very different to me.  However I will say that the quality of the DVD is very good.  It is well laid out and the production quality is probably the best I have ever seen.  If you are a student of Dr. Yang Jwing Ming this is probably an excellent video to own.",1131580800,11,659,4.32520325203252
1919068,3,B0000CEUY8,"The presentation is not faultless, the picture quality is only slightly above home video. That said all the material is here, the long form, 88 steps broken down into indivdual moves, complete with breathing patterns.

The base movements are also covered leaving a rounded package for all levels but also slight taste of disappointment that the DVD production could have been better.",1129075200,13,383,5.17741935483871
1919069,5,B0000CEUY8,"I find this DVD extrememly useful for learning.  The menus are setup in such as way to get quickly to the information you want.  Every move from the form can be access via the menu.  Also besides showing each move you also have the option to click a button and get nore information about the how and why of each move.

The information on Chi is an extra bargain.  It was easy to understand and there were Chi Kung exercises taught as well.

The quality of the video was excellent and though they did not keep the camera at the same angle, I could follow along with what he was doing.

Minor issues:

I would have preferred the ability to control my viewing angle instead of just the one.

I'm no expert and I don't know the Yang long form, but every book I have looked at and the few videos I have looked at seems to show the form slightly differently.  The movements at the beginning of the 2nd and 3rd sections are different, the number of repetitions for wave hands at clouds, repulse monkey and parting mane are different (wave hands at clouds also seems to be moving in the opposite direction - right instead of left).

Your enjoyment of the instruction will probably be based on whether or not you think the form should match what is normally seen or if you feel the form is open to interpretation (as long as it contains all of the moves).  For me I chose the latter and greatly enjoy this DVD.",1109462400,20,1401,4.305343511450381
1919070,5,B0000CEUY8,"I have been practicing martial arts almost all my life:

Judo for 6 years when I was younger, I left in my teenage years

Shotokan Karate, I joined 3 years ago, I still practice it every week and plan to go on.

KickBoxing, for 6 months, I am lucky because this class is just before my karate class in the same gym and I can take both in 2 hours, but I am going to quit. (Aikido is going to fill this void)

Aikido, 2 months, I like it alot, a different approach of that of Karate/KickBoxing.

I am 30 years old and I mostly like very intense excersise, that's the main reason I joined Kickboxing, lot's of sparring.

Then I bought this DVD for my mother and I got completely in love with Jaijiquan, this DVD is amazingly well done, lots of sections you can directly jump to, the initial lecture (mind opening and interesting), the section on Quigong... This DVD has finally opened the door the Aikido started to show me. A different approach (I knew something similar, Judo, but I was too young too look deeper on it and mainly liked it for the sparring and because it meant a game for me).

The initial lecture also comments something very interesting about internal external martial arts:

-internal (what I am discovering with Aikido and Taijiquan)

-external (what I always have liked and like, Karate and Kickboxing)

the concept of ""calm"", meditation, feeling your body and how both paths (ext/int) can help the other and reach the same ultimate goal. This is something I think I can use in Karate too.

OK, I know this is only a bunch of facts about my life and very little about the DVD itself, but others here have made good review of it. I just want to say that this DVD (and Taijiquan itself) is very good and deserves a try if you are interested in Taijiquan and/or Martial Arts, I think it is very unlikely that it will dissapoint you.

1919072,5,B0000CEUY8,"I bought this DVD based on other Amazon reviews and was entirely satisfied.  Dr. Yang is the real deal.  The production values are high for demonstration/instructional purposes.  Dressed in white, he performs on a big stage against the background of a blue velvet curtain.

This DVD maintains a rigorously high level of training, assuming some previous background on the part of the viewer.  Movements are amply demonstrated, but not  dissected in minute detail.  The scope of warm-up demonstrations, stance training, Taiji Qigong exercises, martial applications, and sequence performances are impressive.  All indexed for DVD navigation.

The companion text (Taijiquan, Classical Yang Style, purchased separately) also has GREAT content.  It contains high points of his Qigong writings, additional new Qigong content, historical background on the evolution of Taijiquan styles, and thorough advice on the first several years of  training.  The printing and binding of the text could have been better, but are serviceable for a workbook or training manual.

As a novice I am studying more basic materials published by Dr. Yang.  However, I refer to the inspiring examples on this DVD.",1101081600,17,1184,5.469613259668508
1919073,5,B0000CEUY8,"For me this DVD has such great value since it has great warming up exercices and an (few) excellent Qigong sequence(s) which one can learn from the DVD. The Tai Chi form one can use as a reference but since there are no multi angles there is no way one could learn that from a DVD. However, it will help you practise at home. Dr. Yang has some other DVDs on White Crane hard and soft Qiging and the Qigong for health. I can recommend both of them.",1095120000,8,447,4.090909090909091
1919074,5,B0000CEUY8,"This incredible DVD is more than worth its price tag. Even experienced practitioners will find much to engage them. You need to spend a little time getting familiar with the navigation on this product, because there are many ways of calling up scenes or cross referencing individual movements and explanations. Every single move, wether part of the form, warm up, jigon, or fajin has its own chapter. It is also listed on a menu so you can for example see a move, then pass quickly back to see its martial application (13 fundemental postures are shown with martial applications) and then return again to the move.

The problem for beginners, is that they are likely to be overwhelmed by the content of this DVD. If you are a begginer you should definitely purchase this DVD. But you need to be very disciplined in its use. And of course it is essential that you find yourself a teacher. Bear in mind that your teacher may work from a different version of the Yang long form.

I suggest you ignore the theory lecture and go straight to the warm up and jigon excercises. When you have worked on these for a long time. Start on the first four movements of the form. Click on the yin yang symbol for each move to see the detailed information and slide show picture of the posture. Then you can click back immediately to see the move again. Find the martial applications where they exist for the moves you are working on. They will help you to understand the form much better even if like me, you are not wanting to use them martially.

Dr Yang really needs to produce a second DVD to accompany this one showing him working with a student on each move giving detailed advice as we watch the individual working. The one drawback of this DVD is the lack of this type of presentaton.

I am returning to the Yang long form after a long absence. For me this DVD is so good it is hard to praise it enough. If you read your reviews Dr Yang, then thank you again and again for what you have done here.",1091491200,43,1989,4.396739130434782
1919075,1,B0000CEUY8,"This is really more an encyclopedia article than a learning video. Note also this video comes from a fighting art viewpoint; no relieve-stress-on-the-beach scenes here. As reference it goes into MUCH detail, but for beginners this is too tedious a place to start. All the moves are shown from about the same angle; new learners usually need more help than that and will find this video frustrating in that respect. If you already know the form, are looking for more historical background or are coming from another martial art you will find a lot of data. So it all depends on your goals - to learn the form look elsewhere, this is way overpriced. But if you already know the form and are looking for details, you may find it interesting. Either way though its a bit pricey for what you get.",1087689600,29,791,4.577464788732394
1919076,5,B0000CEUY8,"I've seen a number of other videos offering instruction in various styles of martial arts and Tai Chi specifically.  This one stands above them all for the quality of the production and the way the DVD is put together.
There is a great wealth of information on this DVD.  There is a short lecture on theory, a number of loosening up and warming up exercises, Taiji Qigong exercises, and of course the full Yang style long form.  Everything has chapter stops and you can skip to the section you want quickly and easily from the DVD menu.
The long form doesn't dwell excessively on any individual movement which allows you to practice along with it, but if you want more detail on how a movement is performed, you can hit 'Enter' on your DVD remote when the yin yang symbol is on the screen to get in depth instruction on the current movement being demonstrated.  In that way it manages to offer the best of both worlds.
The only small criticism I have is the way the camera angle would switch sometimes during the course of a movement.  It was done to provide the best view of the movement I'm sure, but the specific directions each movement travels in are not clear.  A small nit to pick no doubt and probably of no concern to a beginner anyway.  All in all this DVD stands well above any other Tai Chi instructional video I've seen.",1080604800,122,1333,4.438524590163935

I have been practicing Tai Chi for several years now. It is not Dr. Yang's fault that I learned the routine differently in an other part of the world but what is really disturbing is that the camera angle changes all the time. This keeps you from really following the movements.
On the other hand the CD provides a lot of background information which seems to be kind of profound.",1497916800,,430,4.3875
