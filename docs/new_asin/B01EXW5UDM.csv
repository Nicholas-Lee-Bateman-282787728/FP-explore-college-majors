8759756,4,B01EXW5UDM,"I had so much fun watching this with my boyfriend. He had good memories of the show from the 90's, and it completely delivered. It can get a bit gross at timenot quite at the level of Ren & Stimpy, but along the same spectrumbut if you have a strong stomach, it will be fine! The DVDs worked great. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that the box, though very visually appealing, dents easily, and there are no subtitles on the DVDs.",1517788800,,446,4.1976744186046515
8759757,5,B01EXW5UDM,"Dvds are awesome all perfect condition and tin is cool looking only thing that I think customers should know is that there is a little velvet insert inside the tin and then the 6 DVDS are just stacked on top of each other, probably not good for keeping them from getting scratched so just so you know.",1514246400,2,301,4.298245614035087
