Only a handful of people are interviewed during this hour-long video, none of them who really knew Clark Gable well and don't have much to say.  You get the impression that Gable's biographer, giving certain accounts of Gable's life, has about two hours of sleep the night before.  Meanwhile, nearly a quarter of the screen time seems to be given to Gable's white-trash son, who was born after Gable's death and therefore didn't really know his father, and proves it by seeming to talk more about his own life than his father's.  I got the impression that they had to include him in the film just to get access to photographs in the family album.
Poor editing, with virtually no interesting content to boot, makes this a sad documentary indeed.",1022803200,8,857,4.655629139072848
