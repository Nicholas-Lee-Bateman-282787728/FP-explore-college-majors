7857746,5,6303934587,"This film based on a play called Murder Mistaken by Janet Green is directed with pace by Lewis Gilbert, and only reveals it's stage origins at the climax when the cast yell at each other. We begin with Dirk Bogarde as the irresistably named Teddy Bare, married to an older woman, who he kills for the inheritance. The murder occurs offscreen, with the camera moving to a curtain fluttering in front of an open window. Gilbert presents Bogarde as threatening from the opening where his wife (the touching Mona Washbourne) screams and he glowers as they ride the ghost train at an amusement park. Gilbert also uses Wellesian deep focus framing of the couple, for an expressionist effect. However Bogarde's next intended victim, his new wife Margaret Lockwood is a lot more resistant to his charms. It's hard to decide which of Lockwood or Bogarde is the more unlikeable character, so when they court to the strains of a torch singer's Leave Me Alone, you're not sure which one should leave and which should be left.  Things are complicated by Lockwood being the aggressor, but as we see she is no fool, it becomes a game of outwitting. When Kay Walsh enters after Lockwood becomes the new Mrs Bare, and appears to be Lockwood's successor, the stage is set for a venomous triangle. The suggestion that Washbourne remains some sort of accomplice to Bogarde's actions and his confidante, with her symbolic rocking chair prefiguring Mrs Bates in Psycho, doesn' make sense since there was no hint that his wife was in on her own demise, even though we see that Bogarde enshrines her bedroom. Perhaps it is more a device left over from the theatre staging, so that Bogarde can deliver asides, more than a demonstration of his mental state. And the suspicious lawyer breathing down Bogarde's next makes similarly theatrically timed entrances. However Gilbert gives Bogarde a nicely conceived partially shadowed face when he is confronted with his past as motivation, and whilst the end may bear a hole, we're still willing to go along with it. This film was one of the roles Bogarde took on to escape his Doctor at Large typecasting, which explains his working class accent, though his character reading a muscle magazine just before he meets Lockwood is something left unexplained and a subtextual hint not further explored. Lockwood too roughens her Hitchcockian Lady Vanishes image. I liked 2 of Green's lines. At the wedding of Lockwood and Bogarde is told ""You've landed the fish but don't forget who supplied the chips"". And in response to Bogarde's anger at Lockwood invading Washbourne's bedroom, she says ""If he had any more wives, I'd have to sleep in the bathroom"".",984700800,21,2667,4.8744493392070485
