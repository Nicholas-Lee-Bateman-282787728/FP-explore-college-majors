8079466,5,B000ASATSU,"This 4 movie collection from 2 of the most original minds in cinema is a real treat.
Big Lebowski is possibly the best example of the Coen brothers style as it contains elements of drama, mystery and comedy in an intertwining tapestry.
Blood Simple remains one of the best thrillers made since Hitchcock's prime.
Intolerable Cruelty is fun romantic comedy.
And finally the Man Who Wasn't There is fascinating film noir combined with a Lynchian sensibility.
The negative reviews below are silly.  First, these films represent only the Universal films the Coen's have made, thus, it's logical and predictable that this box set contains nothing from the other studios.
Also, one reviewer giving the collection 1 star is a big Spielberg fan, yet, seems to dislike his more adult work. (Furthermore, if you don't even like the Coens' Blood Simple you should definitely stick to E.T.)
A reviewer from Australia gives this collection a single star because she received the wrong country format. (That's a real shame, but a movie review site is a poor place to discuss a customer service issue.)

Hopefully there will be other collections released containing the other Coen brother films from the other studios.",1167868800,6,1203,5.040201005025126
8079467,5,B000ASATSU,"AWESOME SET.

BLOOD SIMPLE AND THE BIG LEBOWSKI ARE AWESOME.  THE OTHER TWO ARE NOT QUITE AS GOOD, BUT ARE GREAT FILMS AS WELL.

BLOOD SIMPLE IS ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER MADE.

THE COEN BROTHERS ARE PERHAPS THE BEST FILM MAKERS AROUND IN THIS DAY AND AGE (TOO BAD THERE AREN'T ANY KUBRICKS LEFT OUT THERE).",1167523200,2,308,4.258620689655173
8079468,1,B000ASATSU,"Atrocious Compilation - it's of some of the worst films the Coens' did (excluding The Big Lebowksi) and does not include their most famous films.  What were they thinking?  It's like if they released a Spielberg Compilation but only included Catch Me If You Can, AI, Minority Report, and War of the Worlds.  WTF!!!!

Plus you can buy each DVD separately and come UNDER the asking price of the entire set.  The BIg Lebowski and The Man Who Wasn't There are about 10 bucks new in most stores.  Blood Simple and Int. Cruelty (which is the most UNCoen film ever) are closer to 5 in many places I've seen.  So don't fall into the ""compilation trap"" because you are not getting a ""bulk"" discount.  Just buy the films you want separately.  Most Coen DVDs are very reasonable price wise.

Any Coen compilation without Fargo, Barton Fink, and Raising Arizona is worthless.

And again, you're better off spending $40 on those DVDs individually.",1156118400,11,934,4.703703703703703
