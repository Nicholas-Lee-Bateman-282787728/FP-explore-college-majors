7929692,4,B000051ZZS,"I Rented this movie from netflix.com and I liked it alot, wanted to add it to my collection of DVD movies.

I went to bestbuy and they didn't have it, went to columbiahouse.com they didn't have it.

Then I tried Amazon.com, should've know they'd have it they got almost everything you'd want, next time I'm just gonna log onto amazon .com and check there first.",1113004800,3,361,4.538461538461538
7929693,5,B000051ZZS,Unlike the previous people that wrote reviews - I follow the path government is taking. Cloning body parts - and selling body parts - is NOW not 2008. This is an EXCELLENT movie for anyone who honestly wants to know what is in store for this country if we do not change the path government is on. Eric Roberts does a superb job of showing a desperate parent - in desperate times - people all over this country are falling on desperate times - no jobs - poor paying jobs - more and more jobs going overseas - medical cost skyrocketing - and there ALREADY are agencies that are taking peoples body parts for profit - to believe someone would deliberately force people into sucide for their body parts is not that far from the mark.  Face it - look around you - people are being hand picked for body parts already! Wake up - this movie is a prediction of the very near future if people don't wake up and stop the corrupt government.,1085875200,6,929,4.308571428571429
7929694,2,B000051ZZS,"Sad. Eric ROberts starred in some good movies, but this one is not one of them. It's definitely one of the worst movies ever produced. Why ? Because it contains only the worst cliches, bad acting. It has a good concept, but badly developed by the producers.",978998400,2,257,4.48936170212766
7929695,2,B000051ZZS,"Elwes and Roberts are definitely going downhill in this production full of bad acting and cliches. The movie is a total failure since the beginning, wasting an interesting premise ( in the future - 2008 -, people would be free to sell their own lives ). Sorry....",976579200,6,263,4.617021276595745
