8040327,4,B00068S3UU,"I have been looking for a DVD like this for years.  A workout that actually teaches you a skill.  Good luck using TaeBo in a fight!  I found this on Netflix and kept it over a month before just buying my own copy.

There is a lot of information contained in the different sections, and it certainly stands up to repeated viewing.  You learn correct technique before moving onto the workout section.  Then every so often you refer back to the technique sections to brush up.  Well made.",1156032000,4,485,4.443181818181818
