5325334,5,B009GGWWMS,"Bought both the video and CD (to play in my car), her music is magic. I was a toddler at the time of her fame, and yet...it's moving and personal, somehow.",1361059200,,155,4.032258064516129
5325335,4,B009GGWWMS,"Judy is still a delight to look at and listen to.  If anything, she has grown more elegant, more beautiful with age.  The Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is a stunning setting for lighting, atmosphere and acoustics.  If we could have just watched and listened to Judy I would have given this 6*.  But the guest stars for the most part detract.  Still worth owning, watching, listening to.  Incidentally, the stereo track has better balance than the 5.1 surround.",1360886400,,481,4.734939759036145
5325336,5,B009GGWWMS,"Judy's voice has become more pure over the years although I liked it when she was in the gut-it-out stage (when she was first recording) as well. In fact, my favorite album of hers is still the Wildflowers because I loved the story songs. Good buy, this. You can't go wrong with Lady Collins.",1359936000,2,292,4.425925925925926
5325337,5,B009GGWWMS,"Judy Collins hasn't lost her ability to capture the mood in the lyrics she sings....This DVD is  one that you'll be watching more than just one or two times.....The tribute to her mother is a song that will arrouse much thought and emotion...sung with her heart ,soul and with love..... You will enjoy this Gem.....",1356998400,,315,4.7272727272727275
5325338,5,B009GGWWMS,"Judy Collins has to be the 8th wonder of the U. S. pop/folk music world. Like fine wine, she appears to just get better with age. On this live DVD recorded  at the Temple off Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art-- a rather classy setting, Ms. Collins is just as classy.  She is at ease with her audience, making just enough  comments to be interesting but not boring. And then there is that voice, so clear and pure after all these years of singing.  I believe Ms. Collins is 73.

There are 16 selections here, some of my favorites. She would have gotten an A+ from me had she sung  ""My Father."" She does include, however, the poignant ""In The Twilight,"" a song she wrote about her mother who had Alzheimer's--""she's a lady""-- and I was glad to see the Ian Tyson song ""Some Day Soon"" that I do not believe she often includes on her ""best of"" albums. She opens her concert with the rousing ""Open The Door,"" another of her own compositions (""Open the door and come on in/I'm so glad to see you, my friend"") and closes with one of her greatest hits ""Send in the Clowns."" She also sings Joan Baez's song about Bob Dylan that she has recorded with Baez ""Diamonds and Rust"" and ""Helplessly Hoping,"" written by Stephen Stills.  We get just a little of ""Suzanne,"" the  Leonard Cohen song she recorded so long ago and the first song I ever heard her sing.  And I have always thought she sings ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" better than Dylan (although I thought a friend of mine would throw me out of his car when I had the temerity to voice that opinion). The others are ""Both Sides Now,"" ""Campo de Encino,"" ""Pure Imagination,"" ""Veteran's Day,"" ""Pastures of Plenty,"" ""Moon Is A Harsh Mistress,"" "" Since You've Asked"" and ""The Blizzard.""

Chris Bailey, Kenny White, Ani Difranco, Jimmy Webb and Shawn Colvin sing with Collins on some of the selections.  The accompanying  musicians, particularly the pianist and cellist, are great as well.

One final comment: I bought this DVD a few nights ago when I heard Ms. Collins perform in Ogunquit, Maine-- where she did sing ""My Father""--and her voice then was just as pure absent all the tricks that can take place in recording studios to make perfect less than perfect voices.",1354147200,26,2206,4.526448362720403

8541229,5,B009GGWWMS,"I highly recommend this DVD of a concert given by Judy Collins and her guest performers at the New York Metropolitan
Museum of Art. The selection of songs is excellent, and Collin's crystal clear voice is still undiminished. In addition, she
had many interesting and relevant recollections about her long career and some of her fellow singer-songwriters.",1401321600,4,354,5.228070175438597
8541230,5,B009GGWWMS,Great venue for Judy and her friends. Super oldies and goodies and Judy's voice continues to be the very clearest of all.,1398729600,,121,4.545454545454546
8541231,5,B009GGWWMS,"This is a really well shot video.
I saw many of these songs preformed in other shows from close up and was very happy with this disc.
This helps me enjoy the unforgettable memory of Judy playing piano by ear just a few feet away from me.
The Blizzard was incredible.
A lot to like if you are a fan of Judy.",1394841600,3,306,3.9516129032258065
8541232,5,B009GGWWMS,"Very well put together, voice of an angel with a message!  Very similar to the awesome concert we just saw, memories of a great night to keep playing over again",1367193600,2,160,4.333333333333333
8541233,5,B009GGWWMS,"Truly an amazing Concert. Judy Collin`s is in top form, her voice, guitar, and piano playing are wonderful. Guest jimmy Webb is marvelous on the piano in ``Moon is a harsh Mistres``. Hopelessy devoted with it`s harmonies almost makes you relive Crosby, Stills and Nash.  Judy`s performance of n the twilight`is better here than on the recording (Bohemian). Even if you don`t like this type of music you will like this concert.",1364169600,4,426,4.916666666666667
