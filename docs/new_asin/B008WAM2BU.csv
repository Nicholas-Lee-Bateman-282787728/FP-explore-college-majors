If you can find it, I recommend getting the now OOP (out-of-print) Columbia/Tri-Star DVD of this film. It's uncut and has the original Mandarin audio.

""The Killer Meteors"" seems to be alright. Anamorphic widescreen, but the pictures suffers from what I can assume is PERMANENT damage to the original film negative. The audio is English dub only. There is allegedly",1520380800,,556,4.78125
8531341,3,B008WAM2BU,"New Fist of Fury is a horribly disjointed mess of a movie that doesn't live up to the Fist of Fury name. The Killer Meteors is a great film with good characterizations, plot twists, snappy dialogue, good fight scenes, and restraint. You will not see the plot twists coming. Everyone should enjoy this film that likes martial films whatsoever. If you don't, why are you reading this review?

8531343,4,B008WAM2BU,"Through their budget price-oriented Timeless Media label, Shout! Factory have begun dipping their toes into the often neglected Golden Harvest lineup of classic Martial Arts films. Below is an overview of this particular release...

The Killer Meteors (1976)
Once again misleadingly advertised on home video as a Jackie Chan film, this is actually a Jimmy Wang Yu vehicle that has Jackie playing the villain in a supporting role. He really only has three scenes in the film, but they're fairly substantial, and the movie doesn't suffer for it, with plenty going on to hold your general interest. Jackie fans may be disappointed, but Jimmy Wang Yu fans (and most Kung Fu fans in general) will be the ones to get the most out of it.

New Fist of Fury (1980)
A direct sequel to the original Fist of Fury and an attempt by director Lo Wei to launch Jackie Chan as a new replacement for Bruce Lee, the film at least deserves credit for not forcing Jackie to outright ACT like Bruce Lee, steering the film clear of being a blatant Bruceploitation film despite its title. This particular version of the film is the 1980 re-release, which cuts several minutes of footage from the 1976 original to better emphasize Jackie's role.

Video:
Both prints have been remastered by licensor Fortune Star, but don't expect anything along the lines of Celestial's Shaw Brothers remasters. Of the two, The Killer Meteors is in the worst shape, with an often unstable image and several instances of yellow stains and splotches littering the frame. New Fist of Fury is in much better condition, with only minimal print damage. And like other Fortune Star remasters, both films have been slightly ""pinkified"", causing reds to push more towards magenta and giving our lead characters the occasional fresh sunburn.

Audio:
Audio on both films is English dub only, which is a disappointment but not a surprise considering that this is a budget release (being a dub fan also helps). Audio for the most part is clean and clear, with only a rare moment of hiss or static, particularly on The Killer Meteors, the rougher of the two prints. New Foley sounds do pop up in both films, but they are rare and not always obvious.

Extras:
Extras include trailers for both films in their original language but without subtitles, a minor annoyance. The back of the DVD case also advertises Stills as an extra, but unless they meant the images on the DVD menus themselves, there were none to speak of.

Overall:
For an early release meant to test the waters, there's definitely room for improvement, but the low price reflects its contents, making it easier to overlook the cut corners. And although New Fist of Fury may be the shortened version, it's the only version Fortune Star bothered to remaster, so its inclusion here shouldn't be held against Shout/Timeless since it was likely all they were offered. And unless you've seen the longer cut, you won't even notice. Fortunately, The Killer Meteors is uncut, with a runtime comparable to all other remastered releases currently available worldwide.

All things considered, at its current budget price, it's an easy recommend.",1402704000,5,3141,4.892857142857143
