7507396,3,B017JQO6BG,"The Assassin,"" set in ninth-century China, centers on Nie Yinniang (Shu Qi), a killer sent to eliminate key figures in the Tang Dynasty, including Tian Jian (Chang Chen), her former lover, who is now governor of Weribo province.

Though the film may sound like yet another action flick, the action isn't non-stop, but comes in short, dramatic bursts. Nie Yinniang is a princess raised by her aunt to become a martial-arts master. In several elaborately choreographed sequences, the black-clad princess dodges and twists with dancer-like gracefulness when attacked, and prevails over the ferocious, better-armed swordsmen.

Director Hou Hsiao-Hsien focuses on the tranquility of nature with the able help of cinematographer Ping Bin Lee. There are lovely compositions throughout  mists rising toward mountain peaks, a forest of silver birches, rustling trees. Indoors, many shots are filmed through sheer materials that billow in the foreground, giving the movie an otherworldly feel.

The Assassin is a very different kind of martial arts movie. Slower-paced and more attentive to exquisite photography than is common with this type of film, it combines a deadly mission of revenge, a first-rate performance by Shu Qi, and a mythological plot. Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include a behind-the-scenes featurette and theatrical trailer. The film is in Mandarin, with English and French subtitles.",1453680000,36,1402,5.506976744186047

If you are into the artsy type films, THIS is for you!! If you are looking for action, stay way from this movie!  Seriously, do not underestimate how slow the story progresses... That's 100 minutes of your life that you can't take back!!!

7507400,2,B017JQO6BG,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Ive enjoyed almost every film Ive reviewed from Well Go USA.  The company seems to have a firm grasp on importing top-notch films from overseas, and they even dabble in a few titles domestically as well.  But todays film, THE ASSASSIN, is the first of their titles Ive had to struggle to get through.  And when I say struggle, I mean itI had to resist the urge to stop watching this film several times throughout its duration.  Not because the film is terrible, but simply because it is boring, with a capital B.  If you're looking for artistic cinema with beautiful landscapes and long (LONG!) dramatic pauses, this is the film for you.  But if you're looking for action or thrills, youll want to skip this one completely.

Prior to watching it, I was all set to love this film.  The title alone was enough to snare my interest, and when I saw the cover, I was certainly hooked.  I am very disappointed to report it falls way short of my expectations.

THE ASSASSIN is shot very well and looks beautiful onscreen.  The cinematography is a nice blend of artistry and function, highlighting stunning landscapes and lustrous sets.  Unfortunately, this is the only positive I can mention.

The acting is very lackluster, with many wooden performances.  A couple of articles I read about the film stated the director wanted this type of acting, as it added more realism to the plot.  I disagree.  The lack of emotion only punctuated the degree of boredom that was playing out in each scene.

And speaking of boring, THE ASSASSIN has pretty much nothing going on through 90% of the film.  There are long drawn out scenes where nothing happens, yet the camera remains stationary and focused on the non-action regardless.  This gives a great view of the scenery, but it made me start nodding off around 35 minutes in.  The few fight scenes we get to see are decent but nothing to write home about.  A couple of complex, intensity-filled battles might have helped save the film, but alas, we are not that lucky.

As a result, THE ASSASSIN falls flat for me, and I cant recommend itunless you are looking for an artistic (albeit bland) foray into history.  If so, the film hits store shelves next week, so make a note.  Otherwise, spend two hours on a more interesting film.",1453075200,10,2338,4.616504854368932
7507401,4,B017JQO6BG,"Indeed the black and white introduction is just as stunning as the color ones.  True, the director has a different color palate than other Chinese action directors - and nearly every frame is a stunning photo masterpiece.  But I did find the story line rather chopped up throughout the film and the tension of the female ""assassin"" ordered to murder her former fiance for political reasons never gripped me.

Many Akira Kurosawa films or those of Zhang Yimou are movies I can revisit many times.  This film is not in that class.",1451260800,14,528,4.706521739130435

A true pleasure to anyone with that cares about the human condition, but it will frustrate the viewer the first time around.

7507404,5,B017JQO6BG,"**UPDATE 1/27/16**: Several reviewers have expressed concerns with a lack of subtitles on the Amazon Instant Video version of the film; I can't speak to that claim, but I do know that the physical version of this film (DVD/Blu-ray) definitely has subtitles. If you're uncertain about the instant video version, I can assure you the physical version has no such issues.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: Let me start by saying I'm not intimately familiar with the work of Hou Hsiao-Hsien, so I came into this film not knowing quite what to expect. I'm not going to outline the story here, because I think reviews should be more about impressions, and because the details of the plot are perhaps the least important aspect of this film. Here are the things I was blown away by:

The framing, colors, and all-around genius of the visual language Hou Hsiao-Hsien creates are all simply magnificent. The camera often lingers on images dozens of seconds longer than most films would dare, whether it be a flower, a field, a meditative character, etc. ""Slow"" is perhaps an understatement, so if that bothers you, I can guarantee you won't enjoy this film. I, for one, appreciated the opportunity to consider the subjects on which the director lingers, and there was one particular moment -- or rather, two -- that really sold this particular style for me. Somewhere around the first third of the film, there is a scene that shows a man sitting alone in a room. He has a lazy, neutral expression on his face that, at first, suggests depression or some kind of sadness. But as the camera lingers, we begin to wonder if there is something else going on beneath the surface. Now, when the scene was over (and rest assured, there was more to the scene than that, but again, I'm not getting into the story here) I forgot about it until close to the end of the film, when we are given a few lingering shots of goats. The camera closes in on the faces of the animals, and I was immediately reminded of the expression on the man's face in the earlier scene. It's extraordinary to see two seemingly disparate scenes at opposite ends of the film come together in this fashion; I have my own ideas about what Hsiao-Hsien is trying to say there, but in any case, my point is that while it may be tempting at times to wonder why the hell you're getting a lingering shot of an inanimate object or an equally inanimate person, such shots are always purposeful. You just need to think.

Additionally, I have to talk about how action violence is treated in the film. This is not traditional wuxia. Really, it cannot be called an ""action"" film at all. When there is violence, it happens quite suddenly and is over quickly (the opening scene, shot in black and white, is a beautiful example of the ephemeral nature of the film's action). I don't remember seeing a drop of blood. There is no flying through the air or leaping like superman. The only touch of the mystical occurs late in the film and is all the more effective for its unexpectedness. None of this is to say the film is boring, of course. The judicious use of action makes every action scene feel important and impactful.

Music is approached similarly. Where it appears, it is absorbing, but you are not saturated with an omnipresent soundtrack (unless, of course, you count the sounds of nature). The ending is a prime example of why this is a good decision. Even if the rest of the film had been utter trash, the combination of the ending's music and visuals would have been enough to sell me on seeing it again. I won't get more specific about that, because I want you to be as surprised as I was.

All in all, I really cannot think of anything this film gets wrong. Obviously, as I mentioned, you won't want to see this if you prefer fast-paced editing, and you will be disappointed if you are looking for a completely novel plot (My intention is not to be pejorative on either of those counts; everyone has their tastes. I am simply expressing mine, and warning those who may not share them). But if you want your eyes and ears to be ravished, and if you appreciate directors who give you time to consider deceptively straightforward images that have multiple layers of symbolic and literal meaning, I can't imagine how you could be disappointed. Enjoy!",1447200000,92,4280,4.596858638743456

What's the meaning of this scene from the previous and how does this moment connect to the next!!!  Whatever good parts are dulled by the torture of the dragged out too freaking long ""wait, wait, wait"" for the next movement, words.  Every scenes is lethargically long (even the one huge dance scene (1:19 hr in) had no life in it), and the fighting scenes are split second flashes, comparatively.

7507417,1,B017JQO6BG,"Slow is an understatement.  But I can appreciate slow movies.  This one was painfully confusing.  New characters appear with no introduction and no context.  People sit in rooms in beautiful flowing robes.  What are these people doing?  I don't know, they don't say.  I don't mean they don't clearly say what they are doing or thinking, they don't say anything, at all.

The camera focuses on a field of grass, very pretty.  Characters walk through, run through, do some fighting, then leave the scene.  The camera is still focused on the grass.  Well, I think, something is going to happen.  These people are going to come back from off stage and the action I have just seen will be illuminated in some way.  Nope.  You just see the grass some more, then on the next scene.

Maybe if I took a course in ancient Chinese political intrigue, then watched this movie again with a notebook, and a pencil sharpener, and a pot of coffee, I could appreciate it.

7507426,2,B017JQO6BG,"Since so many critics have proclaimed this a masterpiece, I run the risk of coming across as shallow by panning it. But pan it I will, because this film simply doesn't work as a film. As many have noted, the cinematography and locations are stunning. But those elements, while important, aren't sufficient to make a film succeed. A movie is supposed to be more than a ""moving picture.""

Here's what bothered me most:

The plot. For all intents and purposes, it forgets to exist. More likely, it was disappeared by the pretty scenery. Let me be clear - it's not that the twists and turns of the story line are ""subtle"" or ""nuanced."" No. Beyond its basic premise, this bad boy is straight impenetrable. I don't need everything spoon-fed and wrapped up in a bright, shiny ribbon. At the same time, I resent movies that presume I'm willing to work pro-bono as their script doctor. Incoherence is a vice, not a virtue. And striking an over-the-top virtuosic pose, as this film does from start to finish, doesn't make that moral less absolute.

The pacing. Its absurd sluggishness renders the narrative itself absurd. Nearly every line of dialogue is preceded and followed by impossibly long stretches of silence in which the characters stare blankly into space, as if possessed of some profound profundity. They could tell you what they're thinking, but then they'd have to kill you. When they do finally speak, the words are all cranked out in the same ponderous, hushed tone. The overall effect defies suspension of disbelief. Humans just don't behave this way in their day-to-day interactions. Not even ancient humans in ancient China. I'd suggest that those who think otherwise are being bamboozled, or are exoticizing, or both.

The Wuxia-ness. This is supposed to be a Wuxia film, but some requisite Wuxia elements are lacking. As others have pointed out, the fighting is scant. I say keep the wu in Wuxia. And where Wuxia elements are present, nothing notably fresh happens to them. The few brief fight scenes fancy themselves for grown-ups (i.e., no flying) but the hero's feats still require as much ""magic"" as any base jumping crouching tiger or hidden dragon. Which reminds me - I don't recall a single character in ""The Assassin"" committing suicide by jumping off a cliff. Again, where's the Wuxia?

Joking aside, I gave this film a 2 instead of a 1 because it's definitely worth watching if you're looking for something moody and purely visual - a kind of old school, provincial Chinese Koyaanisqatsi, without all the hassle of that film's narrative force. Most viewers, however, are bound to find this moving picture disappointing.",1482883200,,2640,4.910313901345291

7507445,2,B017JQO6BG,"When I first started watching this movie on Blu ray, I was a little confused, not with the setting or the plot as that would come later, but with the presentation.  The film opens in black and white.  OK, no problem, but it is also in a squarish 1.37:1 aspect ratio.  Wait.  What?  So I check the info on the case.  Yep this is a 2015 movie, not one from 1950.  So is something wrong with my display or player?  Nope.  So after a start and stop to make sure everything was OK, back to the film.  The black and white section that starts the film is but a preface to set things up.  It quickly changes with the opening credits to color.

A beautiful woman called Yinniang (Qi Shu) is being trained as an assassin by a princess-nun (subtitles always refer to her as the nun) named Jiaxin (Fang-yi Sheu).  Im not quite sure why, but she was shuttled off to the nunnery as a much younger woman who was engaged to her cousin, Tian Jian (Chen Chang).  I think for her protection against the powers that be.  The nun has it out for anyone involved in corruption and other undesirables evidently taking power during the Tang Dynasty.

If you are intent on watching this movie I suggest you be well rested and have plenty of caffeine available.  Director Hsiao-Hsien Hou who also co-wrote the screenplay, is more interested in how things look rather that moving the story along.  Hes intent on long-lasting shots.  Often beautiful shots of the country-side, sometimes with a rolling fog coming off the lakes or clouds coming in between mountains.  But he also has lingering shots of goats chewing their cud.  Did you know that goats always chew with their jaws moving left to right?  Me either but with 45 seconds of looking at goats chewing I figured there must be a reason.

Is there any fighting or action?  Yes in miniscule amounts, usually involving Yinniang who is as good as it gets when it comes to the martial arts, but as the nun tells her, you think like a human.  Well, yeah.  You see Yinniang is reluctant to kill children or other innocents to get to the bad guy.  So does this movie have anything going for it?  Well if you enjoy beautiful landscapes, lovingly displayed, this might be for you.  But when I want to look at art there are numerous museums in the area I can go to.  I did not like this movie!

The Blu ray package looks very good.  It has a video resolution of 1080P and has aspect ratios that vary from 1.37:1 to a brief scene at 1.85:1.  The prevailing ratio is 1.41:1.  I would think that if you are trying to focus on beautiful scenes you might want to go with the wider ratioall the time.  In any case there are no complaints about the color, the hues, the black levels or any other detail.  The movie was shot on 35mm film which give it a nice granular, textured look.  The audio comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track that is also very good.  There isn't much in the way of explosiveness in the film, but the environmental sounds are well presented.  A soft musical score is featured so it really doesnt jar the surrounds or sub(s).  Dialog is very minimal in the film as well, but the Mandarin comes across loud and clear.  Subtitles are available in English, French, and simplified and traditional Mandarin.  Extras include a trailer and 4 brief Behind the Scene featurettes all in 1080i.",1468972800,2,3320,4.428807947019868

7507450,5,B017JQO6BG,"Like Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, cinema has produced masterpieces and they're easy to spot when enough people say they hated it because it was boring.
  If you love Goodfellas or Kill Bill, go fetch a stick while the grown ups talk.
I rank this with L'Avventura, Russian Ark, Barry Lyndon, & Last Year at Marienbad... Which is my shorthand for saying I'm gonna watch The Assassain over 50 times, and get kinda cranky if I wait too long between viewings.
  Maybe some martial arts movie fans will open their eyes to less pedestrian, but more likely, The Assassin will prove to be the wuxia on the shelf between Citizen Kane and Andrei Rublev. What is so amazing about it is how unique it is. The moments are mildly staged, but mostly authentic; the composition has a subtle flavor; the events are like scraps of paper that you piece together to get the implication of beautiful photo-story.
  For example, unlike modern handheld indie films where cuts are made to the same scene (actress looks in mirror cuts to actress brushes teeth in mirror cuts to...), there is mild jolt in The Assassin from where the editor cuts to the exact same composition, so it feels like a microsecond has been censored.
  Some of the key plot exposition comes from a story being told by characters on the other side of a billowing veil- which suddenly blows out of the way.
  For all the work that went into this movie, it goes down very smooth and very balanced. So much of it is intriguing but not immediately- which is to say, no scene is expected, nor does it play out as you would expect, but you're never shocked- yet often mildly puzzled, usually by the reactions of characters, or the camera, or even nature.
  Most US & UK audiences will cross their eyes out of their sugar addiction to story! story! STORY! It's actually a very compelling & well crafted tale: cheat sheets have been posted online if want to map out how the characters are all related. But nothing clutters the simple arc: without subtitles, it's clearly about an assassin assigned to kill someone they know and loved.
  If you do put the effort in finding the structure, the tension comes from the assassin roots in the Tang Empire at a time when its province, Weibo, is poised to assert its independence while untangling the sordid past of its ruling class (pssst...namely, with the Yuans). Most of the characters are from Weibo, some of the key players are dead....
  But the good news is you've the rest of your life to re-watch & re-re-watch The Assassin, and luckily there's no sugar; it's made to be rewatched, because the ambiguity has been couched in subtlety, mood, pacing, and authentic acting (one short cut the director used to accomplish this: no rehearsing.)",1467936000,,2729,4.665970772442589
7507451,4,B017JQO6BG,"If you're expecting a a martial arts action film along the lines of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, House of Flying Daggers, or any of the Ip Man movies, you won't find it here. While it is decidedly Wuxia, by definition of what Wuxia represents, it's anything but an action movie. From the large number of negative ""hate"" reviews I'm left thinking U.S. audience expectations have been tainted for decades, starting with the Hong Kong ""Kung Fu"" exploitation movies with the first Bruce Lee martial arts film, ""The Big Boss"" in 1971, the ensuing Bruce Lee franchise of which spawned the 1972-1975 ""Kung Fu"" TV series starring David Carradine. These Hong Kong martial arts films eventually spawned Hong Kong's Heroic Bloodshed genre made famous by John Woo using ""gun kata"" with bottomless magazines of bullets instead of swordplay, taking the HK action movies to an extreme in not only non-stop action, but violence as well. It's a shame that negative ratings result from a movie not meeting preconceived and misguided expectations of what a Wuxia movie should be about. It's NOT the martial arts action scenes, it's the larger story surrounding the hero(s). I'm also thinking the movie was mis-titled in English, which can lead people to think it's about a martial arts assassin assassinating countless victims. Even the U.S. distribution Blu-ray cover doesn't convey the nature of this movie that well. If its Chinese title is completely translated into English, it becomes: ""The Assassin Ni Ynning"". It's about the assassin herself, not her assassinations or who she assassinates.

Wuxia is a combination of Wu and Xia, translation: Martial Hero. A Wuxia story does not require being peppered throughout by lengthy action fighting scenes. It merely needs to be an heroic tale about one trained and skilled in the martial arts and is as much, if not more, about loyalty, honor and integrity as fighting skill. The main character, Ni Ynning is a highly skilled assassin trained for that purpose for thirteen years from age ten to be used as a vigilante to eliminate dishonest and corrupt administrators in 8th Century AD China. The screenplay is not an original story but loosely based on a legendary one in Chinese culture from the 9th Century AD during the Tang Dynasty, which encompasses its time setting. Knowing the ""back story"" helps considerably in better understanding the film. It was NOT made for Western audiences, it was made for Chinese audiences, who have a better comprehension of the legend and the culture that surrounds it. For all the balletic, highly choreographed action contained within the other Wuxia movies mentioned (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or House of Flying Daggers), their underlying stories and the depth of the relationships between the principal characters are just as important. In reality, as the director put it, martial artists to not fly about like birds on wing. Real martial arts fights are very fast and end very quickly.

This movie strips away nearly all the action to allow uncluttered focus on a story about Ni Ynning, how she comes to terms with her trained profession as an assassin and its conflict with her empathy, high regard for humanity, and the likely consequences if she carries out an assassination. She becomes more than the cold, emotionless assassin she was trained to be, acting solely as an instrument for the nun who trained her. She evolves with a moral center in a world of political corruption, a concubine system, and intrigues to influence or change succession to power and titles. We see at the beginning, in B&W, the nun chastise her for not carrying through with an assassination because of empathetic sentimentality. She is then given her next mission which will take her home to where she was born. To say much more would create spoilers. For those that wonder why the beginning was in B&W, it's not because they ran out of color film stock or used the B&W in error. It was deliberate, to separate the prologue from the main story.

I will readily concede the pace is slow. The director is telling the tale visually with minimal dialog. Expressions and body language are as important as the dialog. In lieu of using quick montages, we experience within some limits, the length of a journey on foot or horseback and take in the spectacular beauty of the countryside such a traveler would see. This is something lost by generations who have only experienced air travel which leaps at high speed between airport city ""islands."" We are allowed to marinate and contemplate the beauty of the countryside and its Tang Dynasty man-made structures. We are also allowed to carefully and completely consider Ni Ynning's journey, transformation and the decisions she makes as a consequence, both cerebrally and emotionally. I've seen complaints about pauses in dialog and actor movement. This is all part of telling the story visually, allowing time for the viewer to digest and consider fully what has happened and its ramifications, cerebrally and emotionally. Those not familiar with Chinese culture, current and historical, would find it worthwhile reading about the original story and perhaps viewing the movie twice to completely absorb the story the film portrays visually.

I give this film four stars and would give it four and a half if possible. Five stars are reserved for the very best of the very best.",1467849600,7,5383,4.997770345596432

Obviously the director or someone was yelling out ""get up, your supposed to stand up and walk off now as they do so about 15 seconds later. No one has obviously edited this thing or bothered to shoot things twice, if lines are forgotten the actor just freezes until prompted what to say or do.

The visuals and sound are absolutely stunning, this is something you can't possibly get in cg, and shouldn't have to.

Very scenic shots, like fog covered lakes, a backdrop of mountains, skeleton trees not in bloom, beautiful architecture and attention to detail including wind, costumes, decorations...exotic sounds, background bird, water, wind...This film was a visual, natural, eye candy which can lend to great inspiration for colors, shapes and background if your into art/drawing or if you love to travel and want to see natural landscapes from a professional perspective.

7507534,5,B017JQO6BG,"Review for the Blu-ray:

I really don't know why this film has not caught on or mentioned more. This is a very unique, slick and very impressive martial arts film. Its very brilliant in choreographing, sets and costumes, Its vibrant and almost like a work of art come to life. This is directed by Hou Hsiao-Hsien. He has been in the business since the 1980s. Directing over 20 feature films. He has a true talent that captures breathtaking realities on screen and The Assassin is one of those films that stand out.

The plot is set in 8th century China. It is the era of the Tang Dynasty. Your main character is Nie Yinniang at the young age of 10 is abducted by a Nun who trains her in the art of martial arts and turns her into the act of an Assassin. She is a killer that hunts down and murders corrupt government persons. Her master is Jiaxin who tells her who to hunt down and kill. Nie at times, shows mercy, which gets her in trouble with her master. Jiaxin decides to punish her by giving her a new assignment, she is to kill a military governor. What makes this so hard is that she was betrothed to marry him. She now is forced to return to her home, confront her parents that she has not seen in many years. There she has to come to terms with her past, the present ordeal, and the emotional feelings of following her masters orders.

Starring the very beautiful Lin Li-hui. She is absolutely gorgeous and is truly a flawless performer. She makes you believe her plight. She adds to her character a reality base feel that transcends off screen into an emotional reality for the viewer. Also starring the very handsome and talented Chang Chen. Both Chen and Li-hui have wonderful chemistry together, and both make you believe their characters as they come to life on screen.

What really needs to be mentioned is the cinematography of this movie. Mark Lee Ping Bin creates a stunning, breathing taking, eye opening orgy of beauty throughout this film. The sets, costumes and places are truly something to be praised. The visuals of this film is mind numbing. Tight direction, flawless acting, dynamic visuals all bring this stunning piece of film together to enjoy, embrace and to watch over and over again. It won best director at the Cannes Film Festival and it rightly deserved it. Its directed beautifully. Also Won Best Film, Director, Cinematography, Makeup and Costume Design, Sound effects at the 2015 Golden Horse Film Awards. Every category deserved it.

Truly a beautiful martial arts drama that showcases a rich story. Brilliant characters. Speechless visuals. The sound effects are pure ear candy. Listening to the wind, or the sword blade, the emotional force of the body, is all detailed in this filmed beauty.

This is brought out on Blu-ray by Well Go USA. Sadly, the special features are limited. For such a great, grand film, I would have expected more in the special features department. It does have four behind the scenes features, known of them are over 4 minutes in length. Also comes with the trailer.

This is a must see, must experience film that I highly Recommend.",1456704000,8,3102,4.649635036496351
7507535,2,B017JQO6BG,"The acting and cinematography were very well done. Story wasn't very complex, but was told in a good way. I really wanted to like this movie. However, it just didn't suck me in. The main issue for me is that is about a 30 minute movie that was extended via ""artsy shots."" By, that I mean there are 30-60 seconds of people just staring off into the distance or a grassy field with the grass swaying in the wind. ""Artsy"" scenes can be used to enhance certain emotions, but this was just scene after scene of nothing. It didn't help enhance any emotion except frustration with having to sit through them.

As for the martial arts.. Well there wasn't really any. Ok a couple of very brief scenes. This is not a martial arts movie.",1456704000,3,726,4.377777777777778

7507548,2,B017JQO6BG,"The Assassin looked interesting and seemed to be getting good reviews from some sources I follow and generally share similar preferences.

I had no problem with the pacing of the moving. The plot though I felt was weak and what action there was was very nice.

What I couldn't get over was the constant back and forth if the aspect ratios. I thought something was wrong with my copy when it started off in 4:3 and black and white before turning to color and 16:9 and back to 4:3 and back to 16:9 and back to 4:3.  There also seemed to be some other aspect ratios and some parts even seemed like it was close to 1:1.

There were also plenty of problems with the the darks. The scenes where it showed the woman playing the guqin (the flat stringed instrument) on her lap was one of the few times the film was actually in 16:9 and the darks were so grainy it they seemed to dance on my screen.

The Assassin is a beautiful movie with some great costume design, sets, nice mood setting music, and nice cinematography splattered throughout but the way it was filmed was very jarring with the constant back and forth of the aspect ratio of couldn't get over those shortcomings with were always jarring and took me out of the film.",1456012800,4,1224,4.3744493392070485

7507553,5,B017JQO6BG,"This is a beautiful film.  But it must be viewed from a certain perspective.  To me, it was like a still life painting which depicts a particular period in the lives of its characters.  It is not about action, but rather about the thoughts and cares of the people in the painting.  The action is implied.  From this one can feel the emotions and things to follow.  Rather like the pointalist picture of the picture of people picnicking by the river.  It is a startling and moving experience, to be transported into the scene one is watching, rather than being spoon-fed excitement which I often enjoy as well.  [ I found that latest James Bond movie, Spectre, to be vastly entertaining, exciting, funny, exotic, etc. and have watched it several times: for pure amusement].

I doubt that this film would be appreciated by most people, and rightly so: many people have no interest in sitting and contemplating a painting for two hours or more.  A movie might be judged by its beauty or by its audience appeal.  If the latter, then this one would not rate high.  Its value as amusement is not high.  But as art it is splendid.

As an important aside, the cinematography and settings are masterpieces.",1455926400,14,1197,4.6380952380952385

7507582,3,B017JQO6BG,"The Assassin is unfortunately titled. If it were named The Generals Daughter, it would more accurately denote a drama about a young woman, rather than raise expectations among viewers that its an action film dominated by martial arts sequences. If you go into this film expecting martial arts action, you will be deeply disappointed. There IS martial arts action, but it accounts for no more than 10 minutes of this 105-minute film from director Hou Hsiao-Hsien (Flight of the Red Balloon, Three Times).

Yinniang (Shu Qi) is a generals daughter who is kidnapped and trained by a nun to be an assassin, with the goal of taking out corrupt leaders and her ultimate target her very own betrothed, Tian Jian (Chang Chen)a cousin who presides over the largest army in northern China.

But The Assassin, as I said, isn't an action film, nor is it a historical drama. Its a lyric drama, and viewers ought to approach it that way. Hsiao-Hsien favors long, pensive shots, whether its a figure poised in thought or a landscape upon which a solitary, faraway figure is seen. Even common reaction shots, which in western cinema would run no more than five seconds on average, can last up to 45 seconds, with the camera focused on an individual with no other movement or variation of facial expressions. This, while a woman, sometimes seen and sometimes not, plays songs on what appears to be a guqin, a classical Chinese form of zither associated with sages and the playing of songs intended to elevate the spirit. The cinematography is outstanding, even breathtaking at times, and Hsiao-Hsiens deliberate (some might say plodding) direction seems intended to unite those visual images with the music, with the plot being of lesser importance, and those scant martial arts scenes approached with the same lyric sensibilities.

However you describe it, The Assassin is a slow-moving film. For some, that will be a dealbreaker. For others, not so much. And you know who you are.",1455321600,3,1965,4.912650602409639

Of course, it is a complete fantasy and it has no resemblance to real life whatsoever. It's a very sophisticated visual narrative of an old (9th Century) Chinese legend.

7507592,3,B017JQO6BG,"'The Assassins' manages to cram 30 minutes worth of story into 105 minutes.  Much of the film is taken up with lengthy static shots, which while breathtaking, do nothing to move the story forward.  Until the very end, it's difficult to figure out where the film is heading (despite reading a plot synopsis).  Action is very poorly connected; the whole thing is close to a series of non-sequiturs.

So why 3 stars instead of 1 or 2?  The cinematography and art direction are both superb.  The black and white sequence at the beginning of the film could have been done by one of the b&w master cinematographers of bygone years.  The selection of films and lens (Kodak and Zeiss, respectively) were not a surprise, although the use of film (instead of direct digital imaging) was.  The overall format of ~1.4:1 is unusual these days and frustrating to someone expecting an action movie, but it makes sense cinematographically, since it allows more of the exquisite scenery to be seen in the frame.

As an action movie it fails utterly.  Anyone who purchases this expecting a wuxia classic will be extremely disappointed.",1454716800,,1117,4.831578947368421
7507593,1,B017JQO6BG,"A ""masterpiece""? Cut me a break. This movie is silly. It's a bad movie. It's a rambling indecipherable script. The acting is flat. There is a silly character arc, although it's more like a gentle curve. There is no tension, there is no drama, there is no intrigue, there is no suspense, there isn't really much of anything human at all. And a few pretty shots of vistas and landscapes do not make a great cinematic experience. Honestly I can find that on YouTube. So, if you find long shots of the profiles of actors staring into space ""thought provoking, or God forbid insightful"" well this should be your cup of tea.

7507603,2,B017JQO6BG,"While there are aspects of this film that I liked, I could not get past the jarring first 10 minutes as I desperately tried on my remote to get this letterbox or ""full screen"" version to an actual widescreen format. The BluRay case said widescreen, so I just assumed I had been shipped the incorrect version. I thought: Who does that old format any more? Then, slightly farther into the film a woman is playing a Chinese instrument and suddenly it went widescreen - but just for this one scene.
Then I read that the narrow screen version is the director's intent. If there had just been a NOTE on the box somewhere that pointed that out, I would have at least not been confused.
On to the movie itself - I have seen many, many Korean and Chinese martial arts films, and this one places an emphasis on the ""arts"" and style... certainly over substance.
Yes, it is virtually bloodless. Yes, you rarely see anyone actually fall and die. And yes, the only actually interesting looking battle sequence between our heroine and an enemy in large numbers is filmed just briefly and so far away obscured by woods that it was essentially pointless. I think: ""Hey, hey! There's a great looking fight going on over there Mr. Director... get your camera in there and .. oh... oh...never mind...  there's a close up of a banyon tree or something you need to show us..."" Oh well.
And by the by... there's little need to worry about subtitles when all the entire dialog in the movie will fill just two pages.
I don't mean to be too critical here because I did enjoy the very well crafted staging of the fights, and the lush tapestry of the interiors appeared authentic and beautifully photographed. As it was.
But to bill this as the ""greatest martial film ever"" or anywhere close is a real stretch of the imagination.
NOTE: When I watched the making of features... I got the impression there were other scenes or more extended parts of fight scenes that actually looked kinda good. Too bad those scenes were not in the film. Or the one major fight scene between her and what looked like about 20 guys wasn't filmed from a mile away for a fleeting few seconds....
Perhaps an ""extended cut"" with actual martial arts fighting is in the works?
I give this a 10 for style and a 1 for substance. Him and Dario Argento should get together and exchange notes sometime.",1454457600,3,2344,4.528301886792453

7507613,5,B017JQO6BG,"I ordered this video for my Chinese wife and stepson. They read, write and speak English very well but I know they prefer their native language. They are from Chongqing, where Mandarin is spoken. I think it's a great movie. I was a little hesitant about ordering this video because the description states that the language is Cantonese, with English subtitles. I haven't explored the menu or the language options but my wife insists that the Chinese language used in this video is Mandarin, not Cantonese. The director is from Taiwan, where the majority of people speak Mandarin. The main actor is from Japan, where, of course, the vast majority of people speak Japanese. The description, again, states that the language is Cantonese. I find this to be very strange. Perhaps the Japanese actor's lines are dubbed. If so, someone did a masterful job of dubbing. Of course, many Japanese people speak Chinese, which is understandable considering that a good part of the Japanese language, including the Japanese characters used in writing, was taken from the Chinese language and Chinese characters.

Some reviewers have complained that the English subtitles are either missing or hard to find. I don't have that problem. The English subtitles are exactly where they are supposed to be and I didn't have to do anything to make them appear. The English subtitles appear throughout the movie without fail.

Some reviewers have complained that the movie is ""too slow"" or ""way too slow"". Well, that's because they don't understand China or the Chinese people, who are more than willing to wait long periods of time for anything. They'll wait decades or centuries to get what they want, knowing that it will eventually come if they wait long enough.

Some reviewers have complained that this movie is not for martial arts fans. Well, if you call martial arts ""flying through the air"", ""jumping twenty feet or more into the air from a standing position"" or ""making numerous deadly blows that don't seem to seriously affect the one receiving such deadly blows"" you know absolutely nothing about martial arts. My younger brother was a second degree black belt in Shotokan Karate and was also my instructor. I can tell you that ""martial arts"" involve the teaching of discipline, patience, respect and courage. It's nothing at all like the pathetic garbage you see in most martial arts movies. The number one thing they teach you in martial arts classes is RESTRAINT. Those schooled in martial arts can be very deadly and even a slight kick or punch can cause some serious damage to your body, damage that you can't really overcome in time to win any match or fight. The vast majority of people who are schooled in martial arts will never use the deadly force they are capable of because they are aware of the ramifications involved. They don't talk about it. They don't display it publicly. They hope they'll never have to use it.",1454198400,23,2919,4.881048387096774
7507614,5,B017JQO6BG,"Oh, how I love martial arts movies! I love the action and the sometimes kitschy manner in which some are made. So when I saw this movie on the movie rack, I immediately picked it for purchase, noticing, but not really giving much credence to, a quote of a movie critic from the Daily Beast. The outside packaging read, A Masterpiece. Just hyperbolic self-promotion, I thought. How wrong I was.

This movie is inventive, innovative, and hypnotic. If this movie is not a masterpiece, it is certainly a masterpiece among martial arts films.

The Assassin has acting, directorial and cinematographic flourishes which set this movie head and shoulders above any other. Yes, there are intrigues, action and fights like any other martial arts movie. While the intrigues, action, sword fights, and other elements are common to all martial arts, there are also other elements unique to this movie. For example, there are sweeping, atmospheric pans of the camera on vast countryside landscapes or characters throughout the movie. The characters dialogue are spoken largely in hushed, muted, voices, and in normal speech, not the manic, exaggerated manner found in far too many martial arts movies. In some places the entire tone of the film is so hypnotic and restrained, that the dominant sound is that of a rusty hinge of an opening door, birds chirping, or the wind blowing against lush bushes. There is a lot less dialogue than one would expect. At times the film is more like a meditation than a story.

The director, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, does not fall into the trap of explaining the plot to the audience. He allows you to figure out the plot yourself. Not that the story is all that complicated. As the product description indicates, the plot involves a kidnaped daughter of a general, trained in the martial arts, who returns to exact revenge, unwittingly, on her fiancee. But the movie isn't necessarily about plot. It is about character, inter-personal relations, and intrigues. Meticulously conscious of detail, it transports the viewer to the time and place of the story.

Hou Hsiao-Hsien practically forces you to pay attention of the movie. The camera will fix itself in one scene or character. The scene did not freeze because of a defective DVD disc, but because there is something important in the scene the director wants the viewer to see. But there is one other feature. The DVD is in a letterbox format. However, unlike other letterbox-formatted movies, indeed, unlike any other movie I have seen, the director formatted the screen to crop borders on the left and right sides of the picture while keeping the letter box format, so that the entire movie appears to play in one, great window in the middle of the screen. This provides a vantage point to train the eyes to the middle of the screen, literally forcing the viewer to watch the movie. Utterly ingenious!

Not much effort is needed to enjoy this film, however. The movie itself is beautifully filmed and a pleasure to watch.",1454198400,3,2990,4.889546351084813

It is strangely not in 4:3 ratio either. 95% of the time the movies is in a strange close-to-1:1 square box ratio. Then all of a sudden for about 5 minutes it changes to 1.85:1. And then it returns back to 1: for the remainder of the movie. I initially thought something was wrong with my Bluray player. But after testing it on multiple devices (PS4 + PS3), it became clear to me that it is how it is for whatever reason (artistic decision maybe??? lol) which I cannot comprehend. The 16:9 aspect ratio on the cover is misleading. Why do I care? Half of my big screen (almost 1/4 on the left-hand side, and 1/4 on the right-hand side) is black, which is really annoying.

As far as the movie itself, I know I know. There are all sorts of evidence that the cinematography is master piece.
How about the story, I think that it has a fairly good story IF you are motivated enough to visit various wiki, blogs, critique sites afterwards to educate yourself to fill in all the gaps that is not at all or barely explained in the movie. For example, the relationships between main characters are barely explained among the already extremely low amount of dialogues. For example <Spoiler Alert> There is a scene where a beard shaman who performs a witch craft trying to kill a person. No obvious explanation of who he is, why he does the witch craft to terrorize another character, and why others are able to link the evidence to him. Then 5 minutes later, BOOM!!! He is killed. I was really puzzled until reading a blog explaining the relationship among these characters. It all make sense now.

8739557,5,B017JQO6BG,"This is a difficult movie for most westerners to get a grip on. It is unapologetically slow (think Blade Runner slow), with a minimum of dialogue. It is technically set as a wuxia film, but has few action scenes with half of them seen from a distance. And of course it is set in a culture and time that most viewers outside of asia have little understanding of.

Two things must be understood up front. One is that the politics of the time, as well as socially acceptable relationships within feudal china play a part in the plot. Two is that it is a wuxia film to the extant that things like supernatural curses are to be accepted as fact.

Now this film is made in Taiwan, so it is Chinese but not made under the communist party's control. I will not be commenting on the story or characters because it is an experience that must unfold naturally in the movie. If you need more context a Mr. John A. Lind's review has more up in the top reviews. What needs to be said has to do with the style of the film. The director intentionally avoids artificial lighting. All scenes are naturally lit and beautifully composed. It is hypnotic just to see rain fall on a tiled roof. The movie is shot naturalistically without the blocking and camera movements typical of modern films, so the audience is more of a voyeur watching the everyday lives of the characters. Entire scenes are shot with just a father playing with his children. Like all asian movies of this type, what is unsaid is as important as what is, and facial expressions and body language tell volumes.

Ultimately this is a quiet, mostly peaceful experience whose focus is the internal world of the protagonist as she comes to grips with her past.

I had to watch this movie twice to understand how it should be viewed, I can only imagine what the experience of an action junkie looking for the next Ip Man, Kill Bill, or Hero would be. Now it is a movie that lingers in my thoughts and is worth meditating on long after viewing. It is an underrated gem that I fear many will overlook or refuse to take the effort to appreciate.",1520985600,,2298,4.438388625592417

If one is not familiar with the time period in the film youll be completely lost.  Best to first watch  Bonus Scenes/Interviews that depict the making of the film to fully know what to expect.  After I did that I watched the movie a second time and it made complete sense.  I loved it second time around!  Best thing about the movie is its cinematic excellence!  Purely magical!",1517529600,,539,4.494845360824742
