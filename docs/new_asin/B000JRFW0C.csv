8152884,1,B000JRFW0C,"This DVD really sux.  What I remember most is how little of the parks they show in this DVD.  They are more interested in showing you 4 actors being sterotypical and annoying.  The actors over act in every scene and sometimes exaggerate facts about the park and the rides.  This DVD does little to help anyone plan for a vacation and is just a poorly made commercial for Walt Disney World and it's surrounding parks.  I do not recommend this to anyone.  Also, this dvd is FREE from Disney website. Do not buy this.",1193270400,,514,4.414893617021277
8152885,5,B000JRFW0C,"I enjoyed this Vacation planning kit. I was lucky enough to go to disney World this past November and see all of the new shows and rides that were introduced this year. This dvd helped me choose what hotel to stay at, what rides to go on with my 3 year old daughter, and informative facts about the parks.",1164499200,3,305,4.186440677966102
