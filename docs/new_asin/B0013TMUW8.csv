3119479,3,B0013TMUW8,"A friend of mine lent me this DVD of ""Indescribable"" by Louie Giglio. I was a bit hesitant to watch because I am very turned off by the Emergent Church movement, and having not heard of Giglio before, was not familiar with his background. After researching him a bit, he is involved in the Passion Movement and I found nothing linking him to the Emergent Church. As always, I watched with discernment. I am suspicious of older pastors dressing like college students.

Giglio is a talented speaker. He doesn't make any profound theological arguments. The subject is one that I am more than interested in- Astronomy. The pictures presented are awe-inspiring. And a few days now after watching the DVD, I am still contemplating the vastness of the universe.

I think this would be a great introduction for someone who knows nothing of Christianity or perhaps a younger crowd. My husband and I felt, due to where we are in our studies, that this was more milk than meat. But one has to start somewhere and this DVD would be a decent beginning.",1282953600,24,1039,4.672131147540983

3119485,5,B0013TMUW8,"This DVD is a recorded talk by Louie Giglio.  I did not know of him or this DVD until I saw it recently with a Bible study group.  It is hard for me to describe how moving it is, but it definitely shows the viewer a much bigger picture of God compared to man.  I just bought my own copy today and am going to show it to both adults and teens in the coming weeks.  It is not hype, and it also is not a teaching that is a Bible sermon where you follow along, so it can be shown or watched at any time without having a Bible in hand.

Having said that, I think it is a terrific talk to show almost anyone teenage and older.  It is not something most people would call preachy, and Mr. Giglio is in casual clothes and the setting feels casual.  The message helps people get a look at the universe, our galaxy, Earth, and how tiny we are compared to the creation and the creator God.  You will definitely see more of the complexity and detail of God's creativity than you have before.  Great for Sunday school classes, youth groups, and other small groups.  Excellent and very highly recommended!

I've been a believer for many years but this presentation opened my eyes to how BIG our Creator God is.  I'd never seen or heard Louis Giglio before but I found him very engaging, humorous, smart, and reverent.  As one reviewer said, I too was crying even before the end of it.  I've always believed He loves all of us and cares so much that He would send His Son to die for my sins.  I don't think I ever fully took that in until I saw this DVD.  ""O the wonder of it all, just to think that God loves me!""  I pray that it changes people's hearts all over the world.",1266969600,6,692,3.9280575539568345
3119489,5,B0013TMUW8,"GOD/JESUS,  creator of everything that we cannot even comprehend it all,  loved us so much that HE died on the cross in our place to pay the penalty of sin for us & rose again & is coming again for us to reign with HIM for eternity.  This dvd is inspiring and shows once again how awesome is our God/Jesus.",1266019200,2,306,4.066666666666666
3119490,5,B0013TMUW8,"After viewing this dvd, I was so impressed that I ordered 20 more to give away at Christmas time to friends and family.  (In fact, our family watched it Christmas eve.)  The quality is very good. Louie's presentation is done in a heartfelt, engaging manner in front of a live audience.  I am someone who is constantly amazed at God's creation and this dvd did not disappoint in that area either.  Louie presented fascinating pictures and information about the cosmos that will blow your mind. His message is one of hope and encouragement.  It is humbling to realize just how physically insignificant we are compared to the size and grandeur of the universe, yet the GOD who created all of it knows and loves us more than we can fully comprehend.  He can be trusted with our fears, our hopes, our pain, our dreams and our tears. God is BIG, He is AWESOME!!  ""Indescribable"" is definitely worth your time and money.  Buy a couple extra as gifts while you are at it!",1264896000,26,963,4.558139534883721
3119491,5,B0013TMUW8,"My Aunt invited my husband and me over along with other people in our family for something that she ""had to show us"". At the time, I had been very busy because of my work schedule and told her that we were going to have to pass this time because I was so slammed with work, but she insisted that we come over and she promised we wouldn't regret it... and of course was she so right!

I am blessed to have a devout Christian family so I assumed the video was going to be something in relation to our faith; but the Chris Tomlin song at the beginning of the DVD kinda gave it away! I personally have always been intrigued by outer space and the stars; even as a child I loved reading stories or looking at images of the glorious heavens that God has made to declare his glory; but this video gives biblical background behind the images. This film is very awe inspiring... I was crying by the end of the film, not because I was sad or upset but because I was so moved by the spirit of God! I was at a loss for words, only to think that this wonderful creator made everything and it is all perfect beyond our comprehension. He gave us these beautiful stars and wonders to look at each day to remind us how great he really is!

Louis does a great job with his presentation and the video! It is a must see for anyone... believer or not! A non-believer might think differently after watching this film; or a great curiosity might occur wanting to know more and to no longer just accept the status quo. This video shows us our incredible universe and I would only hope and pray that anyone who watches this film would have an open heart for the spirit of God to touch them.",1264896000,22,1665,4.183800623052959

3119494,5,B0013TMUW8,I have watched the video so many times and given it as a gift over and over again.  It is a wonderful picture of the indescribable.  Louie Giglio has done an outstanding job of helping the viewer to see outside of our small corner of the universe and appreciate the creator of it all.  You will not be disappointed.  It is great for all ages.,1262044800,40,342,4.2153846153846155
3119495,5,B0013TMUW8,"This is an awesome DVD illustrated sermon/talk.  Louie Giglio has assembled some great ""slides"" of the cosmos and other scientific facts that supports the truth of the Bible.  We have shown it to dozens of small groups in our home and will continue to do so.  We also have purchased through Amazon his talk: How Great Is our God.  Of the two, we enjoyed this the most, but it was a close call and they are both worthwhile additions to your library and to share with friends.

Giglio appeals to a college-age crowd, but we are well beyond that. And both of us are formerly college professors, now retired. And my background is in Television production and my doctorate is in Instructional Systems Technology, so I know good Audio and Video production when I see it.

3353973,5,B0013TMUW8,This video from Louie Giglio is one of the most profound experiences that I have taken into outer-space. To see the wonder of God's creation and to know that He chose us is humbling to say the least. I recommend this video for anyone that you know that is an unbeliever. It will rock their world!!,1284940800,,297,4.321428571428571

3353976,3,B0013TMUW8,"A friend of mine lent me this DVD of ""Indescribable"" by Louie Giglio. I was a bit hesitant to watch because I am very turned off by the Emergent Church movement, and having not heard of Giglio before, was not familiar with his background. After researching him a bit, he is involved in the Passion Movement and I found nothing linking him to the Emergent Church. As always, I watched with discernment. I am suspicious of older pastors dressing like college students.

Giglio is a talented speaker. He doesn't make any profound theological arguments. The subject is one that I am more than interested in- Astronomy. The pictures presented are awe-inspiring. And a few days now after watching the DVD, I am still contemplating the vastness of the universe.

I think this would be a great introduction for someone who knows nothing of Christianity or perhaps a younger crowd. My husband and I felt, due to where we are in our studies, that this was more milk than meat. But one has to start somewhere and this DVD would be a decent beginning.",1282953600,24,1039,4.672131147540983
3353977,4,B0013TMUW8,"Dear Amazon - This ""Indescribable"" DVD was truly a fantastic view of our ""out-there"" and ""beyond"" us that I'd never dreamed existed. I know from a friend who has the hubble on his computer that there are hundreds of views of worlds, stars, galaxies, etc out there. Oh! to have pics of them all. I look forward one day to be able to personally visit all over God's Universe and see more than we can see now; that hubble can only see a small portion. Thank you for allowing me to get in on what we are able to see now. DD",1278806400,3,519,4.098039215686274

3353979,4,B0013TMUW8,"Louie uses his gift, provided by the grace of God, to explain God's unbelievable cosmos.  If you do not believe in God, this is for you. If you do believe in God, the video will show how big God is and how small we are, yet God loves each and every person on this small planet of His.",1276646400,2,284,3.896551724137931
3353980,5,B0013TMUW8,"This video completely changed my outlook on the universe, and all of God's glorious creation. After the video was over, my entire church group was silent and in tears! It's stunning. I walked outside afterwards, and just looked around and thought, Wow. Just, wow! What a glorious, and mighty, and INDESCRIBABLE God we serve! He loves us with such a furious love, we just can't even comprehend it...and if we just look around and think, just think!, you can see Him everywhere!

3353982,5,B0013TMUW8,"This DVD is a recorded talk by Louie Giglio.  I did not know of him or this DVD until I saw it recently with a Bible study group.  It is hard for me to describe how moving it is, but it definitely shows the viewer a much bigger picture of God compared to man.  I just bought my own copy today and am going to show it to both adults and teens in the coming weeks.  It is not hype, and it also is not a teaching that is a Bible sermon where you follow along, so it can be shown or watched at any time without having a Bible in hand.

Having said that, I think it is a terrific talk to show almost anyone teenage and older.  It is not something most people would call preachy, and Mr. Giglio is in casual clothes and the setting feels casual.  The message helps people get a look at the universe, our galaxy, Earth, and how tiny we are compared to the creation and the creator God.  You will definitely see more of the complexity and detail of God's creativity than you have before.  Great for Sunday school classes, youth groups, and other small groups.  Excellent and very highly recommended!

45 minutes running time.  Watching it during Lent will make it an unforgettable season for you.",1269388800,11,1188,4.231111111111111

3353985,5,B0013TMUW8,"I hope I never forget the impression that seeing this DVD made on me.  It changed my life, and I don't say that as a cliche.  I've been a believer for many years but this presentation opened my eyes to how BIG our Creator God is.  I'd never seen or heard Louis Giglio before but I found him very engaging, humorous, smart, and reverent.  As one reviewer said, I too was crying even before the end of it.  I've always believed He loves all of us and cares so much that He would send His Son to die for my sins.  I don't think I ever fully took that in until I saw this DVD.  ""O the wonder of it all, just to think that God loves me!""  I pray that it changes people's hearts all over the world.",1266969600,6,692,3.9280575539568345
3353986,5,B0013TMUW8,"GOD/JESUS,  creator of everything that we cannot even comprehend it all,  loved us so much that HE died on the cross in our place to pay the penalty of sin for us & rose again & is coming again for us to reign with HIM for eternity.  This dvd is inspiring and shows once again how awesome is our God/Jesus.",1266019200,2,306,4.066666666666666
3353987,5,B0013TMUW8,"After viewing this dvd, I was so impressed that I ordered 20 more to give away at Christmas time to friends and family.  (In fact, our family watched it Christmas eve.)  The quality is very good. Louie's presentation is done in a heartfelt, engaging manner in front of a live audience.  I am someone who is constantly amazed at God's creation and this dvd did not disappoint in that area either.  Louie presented fascinating pictures and information about the cosmos that will blow your mind. His message is one of hope and encouragement.  It is humbling to realize just how physically insignificant we are compared to the size and grandeur of the universe, yet the GOD who created all of it knows and loves us more than we can fully comprehend.  He can be trusted with our fears, our hopes, our pain, our dreams and our tears. God is BIG, He is AWESOME!!  ""Indescribable"" is definitely worth your time and money.

3353988,5,B0013TMUW8,"My Aunt invited my husband and me over along with other people in our family for something that she ""had to show us"". At the time, I had been very busy because of my work schedule and told her that we were going to have to pass this time because I was so slammed with work, but she insisted that we come over and she promised we wouldn't regret it... and of course was she so right!

I am blessed to have a devout Christian family so I assumed the video was going to be something in relation to our faith; but the Chris Tomlin song at the beginning of the DVD kinda gave it away! I personally have always been intrigued by outer space and the stars; even as a child I loved reading stories or looking at images of the glorious heavens that God has made to declare his glory; but this video gives biblical background behind the images. This film is very awe inspiring... I was crying by the end of the film, not because I was sad or upset but because I was so moved by the spirit of God! I was at a loss for words, only to think that this wonderful creator made everything and it is all perfect beyond our comprehension. He gave us these beautiful stars and wonders to look at each day to remind us how great he really is!

Louis does a great job with his presentation and the video! It is a must see for anyone... believer or not! A non-believer might think differently after watching this film; or a great curiosity might occur wanting to know more and to no longer just accept the status quo. This video shows us our incredible universe and I would only hope and pray that anyone who watches this film would have an open heart for the spirit of God to touch them.",1264896000,22,1665,4.183800623052959

Louie Giglio has done an outstanding job of helping the viewer to see outside of our small corner of the universe and appreciate the creator of it all.  You will not be disappointed.  It is great for all ages.,1262044800,40,342,4.2153846153846155
3353992,5,B0013TMUW8,"This is an awesome DVD illustrated sermon/talk.  Louie Giglio has assembled some great ""slides"" of the cosmos and other scientific facts that supports the truth of the Bible.  We have shown it to dozens of small groups in our home and will continue to do so.  We also have purchased through Amazon his talk: How Great Is our God.  Of the two, we enjoyed this the most, but it was a close call and they are both worthwhile additions to your library and to share with friends.

Giglio appeals to a college-age crowd, but we are well beyond that. And both of us are formerly college professors, now retired. And my background is in Television production and my doctorate is in Instructional Systems Technology, so I know good Audio and Video production when I see it.
