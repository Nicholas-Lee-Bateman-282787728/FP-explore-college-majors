8016350,3,B0001US61Y,"I feel like I have watched everything ever made lately, and just can't find anything new that is any good. So I checked out a quick net search of underrated comedies that should be more popular and stumbled upon this.

Watching the trailer it looked like American Pie meets Friday. It looked like it might be so damn right stupid it might be funny? It pretty much was just as expected!

A couple of Latino painters truck breaks down in Beverly Hills in-front of a house going up for auction. They decide to venture in when they notice the realtor uses the empty house to have his way with someone. They figure since the house is not being occupied, why not throw a party? The rest of the movie is what happens during the party. Pretty much the main characters are the typical cheesy young guys who wanna score.

Sure, the plot's been done before a million times. But this low budget flick reminded me a lot of a cheesy 80's flick. It has it's fair share of typical gratuitous nudity, drugs and partying, but also tries to focus on delivering a fair amount of shock value gross humor too... and I'm a sucker for those movies!

There was times in the beginning of the film I almost reached for the remote and was about to stop it and dismiss it is a low budget waste of time. But it does pick up and becomes a Friday meets Animal House party. Pretty much look at it this way, if the trailer makes you think you could watch this film, then go for it, otherwise you will be pretty disappointed if you expect it to be anything more. Yes, it's low budget, yes it's another young people partying movie. But as far as alot of these things go, this one's not that bad. It's not great, it's not going to be a classic, nor is it a must see. However, if you are bored, and like me, feel like you've seen everything and are scraping the bottom of the barrel to find something to entertain yourself with... then this one might itch that scratch. Then again, if you just like toilet humor, donkeys, pregnant women's water breaking and running through peep holes, and semen gags, then you probably will wanna check this one out at least once.

It's not so much a movie you will wanna see again and again, so ignore the jokers asking for 40 bucks or more on here for a new copy.... but the $2 second hand ones shouldn't disappoint. For two bucks, you can watch it, then hand it to a friend and dare them to watch it to see if they can get through it too.",1388102400,,2437,4.27765726681128
8016351,5,B0001US61Y,"How could you not like this movie, you have to rated for what it's worth, it's low budget so don't expect magical scenes. But it has beautiful women in a pool, cholo dialect, Baby Bash with the background music.. I started watching this movie on tv for 5 minutes, then 30 minutes, and before I knew it I had to buy it... Can't go wrong with it.. It's like a low budget ""Friday"" in the suburbs.. Funny, obscene, raw, unwholesome and unapologetic.. Buy it!!",1365120000,,455,4.428571428571429

Later, as they sneak out to leave, Robert realizes he left his keys upstairs.  They get caught by the realtor, but Robert speaks quick and tells him they are painters.  Good thing they really are.

8016355,1,B0001US61Y,"I used to be of the opinion that Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo was in fact The Worst Movie Ever, but after having seen Party Animalz, my opinion has changed.

I would like to say that as of now Party Animalz is the worst movie I have ever seen in the span on my life.

Yes, worse than Troll 2, worse than Gigli, and yes...even more horrible than Pearl Harbor. Watch with caution.",1157846400,3,379,4.25
8016356,3,B0001US61Y,"Two low-income Mexican American males host a party in a vacant Beverly Hills house.  I love that films can be made without big-budget Hollywood backing.  I also love seeing actors and actresses of color, especially novice ones, finding roles.  However, here are three concerns I have.

One.  Most of the movie is just raunchy sex gags.  They include pubic hair, sadomasochism, voyeurism, bestiality, masturbation, amidst alcohol and drug use.  Along with flatulence jokes, this adds to the puerile nature of the film.  I think the target audience may be young males, but I also imagine that many adults won't allow their young sons to see this film.

Two.  This film was just a flow of Mexican Americans imitating white and black films.  One actor draws a picture of his love interest, as in ""Titanic.""  The sexual meaning of ""American Pie"" is applied to tacos in this film.  A muscular, masculine man cries out ""Lola!"" in the way that Marlon Brando cried out ""Stella!"" in ""A Streetcar Named Desire.""  The bestial scene replaces the hamster of ""The Nutty Professor 2"" for a mule.  This film has a Peeping Tom/older male neighbor as in ""House Party.""

Three.  The film can be deemed sexist.  There are numerous male characters with numerous lines and personalities, but there are few female characters.  Of the few female characters, they are either whores or madonnas.  The shallow portrayal of women again underscores the puerile nature of the film, but it may be a disrespectful slam against Mexican-American women and girls.",1152662400,,1527,4.9604743083003955
