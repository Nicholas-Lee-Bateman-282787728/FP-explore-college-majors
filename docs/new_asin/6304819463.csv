950036,4,6304819463,"Perhaps I'm a bit biased here, but this film was my first exposure to Abbott and Costello, and I've loved them every since. My parents bought the VHS tape of this when I was very young and I was instantly mesmerised -- those guys were the funniest team of comedians I'd ever seen. They still are, really.
In retrospect, this may not be one of their greatest films (it's not on par with Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein, for instance), but it's a fun retelling of the classic Jack and the Beanstalk story, casting Lou as Jack and Bud as the crooked butcher who swaps him magic beans for a cow. Transplanting the boys into the fanciful setting works, and although some of the stuntwork and sets seemed pretty threadbare at times the story and the comedy still click well. This is also one of the few films the boys ever made that could be classified as a musical.
For completists who love Abbott and Costello and are still impatiently waiting for the rest of their films to come out on DVD, this is a must-have. Also recommended for folks with kids -- it's a wonderful movie for the young.",1034812800,7,1092,4.465
950037,1,6304819463,"This was a gift. I knew enough to stay away from Madacy products. The quality of the print is just awful with lines, missing frames, terrible contrast, fuzzy focus, washed out color, and the worst sound I 've ever heard on a DVD. I wish I could recommend a good copy of this movie but I don't know where to get one since it's public domain.",1020211200,8,340,4.166666666666667
950038,1,6304819463,"You know the story... the film is a faithful retelling. Costello dreams himself (as Jack) and fellow movie characters into the story. The narrative device recalls Dorothy's dream in The Wizard of OZ; it plausibly lands Lou and Bud in character. Be advised that in addition to annoying film artifacts, my Madacy disc was defective (a series of small depressed circles in a ring concentric with the spindle hole) and in the Passport edition, the video is worse still and then is poorly synched with the audio! Stay away from both if you can find better transfers.",1018742400,7,561,4.793814432989691

950040,4,6304819463,"Abbott & Costello films have always been popular with children, so it is not surprising that the boys made a couple of films geared directly for the small fry.  ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" features Lou as Jack and Bud as Dinklepuss.  The boys are sent by the Cosman Employment Agency to baby-sit an obnoxious kid (David Stollery) and his baby sister.  Jack falls asleep reading ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" and dreams himself and his friends into the fairy tale, ala ""The Wizard of Oz.""  Sergeant Riley (Buddy Bear) becomes The Giant, while Eloise (Shaye Cogan) and Arthur (James Alexander), Donald's older sister and her date, are transformed into the Princess and Prince.  Dinklepuss, of course, becomes the butcher who trades the five magic beans for Jack's cow.  ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" is also the film where Bud Abbott first grew what became his trademark mustache.  This 1952 film, directed by Jean Yarbough, faithfully follows the fairy tale, which meant Abbott & Costello could not do their standard routines.  Lou, who plays to the camera big time, has a great bit with his song ""I Fear Nothing,"" while Bud gets to take a stab at being a comic villain.  The weakest part of the film is that the love interests are not all that interesting.  Not Disney, but not half bad, especially for the kiddies.",994204800,8,1302,4.772321428571429

I have really not seen it since, but always remembered it very clearly as it was obviously burned into my memory. Anyway, I came across this recently as I was schmoozing through the vast Amazon inventory and the fact it was colorized as well as original B&W, I was drawn to it like a moth to a flame, and had to buy it immediately. The colorizing was more than acceptable considering the source material and when I threw it on the big screen, Boom!, I was home, sick, all over again. LOL.

950223,5,6304819463,This is an Abbott & Costello movie.  That should be enough of a review.  It's a real funny movie if you like Abbott & Costello.  But here's the plot.  Abbott & Costello take a job as a baby sitter to a precocious but really bratty kid and his baby sister.  This  leads to Costello reading the story Jack & the Bean Stalk to the older boy.  The book is then acted out with Costello taking the role as Jack and Abbott as Mr. Dinklepuss the town butcher who follows Jack up the bean stalk because of the treasure.  There's also a secondary story about a kidnapped prince and princess.  Also there's a giant.,1445904000,,604,4.274336283185841

950374,3,6304819463,"The tale of Jack and the Beanstalk told through the comedic genius of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. Costello gets a babysitting job and while telling the fable to his charge, falls asleep and dreams that he is Jack. The movie is pretty faithful to the fable. Abbott plays a shady butcher who buys the family cow from Jack for a few magic beans. Costello/Jack plants them and the next day he climbs the beanstalk to retrieve the golden goose from the Giant. Along the way he encounters the Prince and Princess who were imprisoned by the Giant and the cast engages in a number of musical comedy numbers. There are also the typical Abbott and Costello slapstick routines. There is a direct tipoff of The Wizard of Oz: I  the opening and ending sequences in tinted black and white and the middle in color.

People who are familiar with the other Abbott and Costello movies and their television show will find this movie familiar.  It's not one of their best, relying as it does on mostly physical slapstick, which was not their forte. The film still has enough to make it a pleasant time-waster but it's not something that you would go out of your way to watch.",1413676800,,1156,4.521531100478469

The writing is poor, the songs mediocre in lyrics and tune, and almost thrown in so that the movie could ride on the tails of other musicals.  But that isn't their strong suit and so the film appears either amateurish or tired, I can't tell which.  It does have a few laughs here and there but overall merely an 'ok' performance.",1410912000,,430,4.3375
950422,3,6304819463,"First, the Goodtimes print for this film is as described by most of the reviews here. Very excellent quality and I am someone who had never seen this movie before--but it's hard for me to imagine there being a better print out there. So a big thumbs up to Goodtimes for that.

As for the film itself, I'm usually not one for cute and whimsical vehicles turned out by my favorite comedians. ""Snow White and the Three Stooges"" for instance is a prime example of cute and whimsy gone all wrong--but fortunately, this film doesn't reach that low level.

While it's not prime A & C, ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" managed to hold my attention and I didn't find myself staring at my wristwatch waiting for the film to end.

And the performances by all the actors involved were good enough--although by the closing minutes of the film I was left to wonder what happened to the Giant's housekeeper that Costello becomes infatuated with. One minute we see her leaving the Giant's castle with the cow, then she's never seen again--kind of odd.

Overall, while I prefer my A & C a little more edgier & not geared towards kids so much, ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" is not a film that embarrasses the duo--a pleasant little vehicle that should delight the kids and maybe entertain the adults as well.

I guess they were the unofficial baby-sitters of the day! One of the absolute BEST was Jack and the Beanstalk. I can remember kids cheering long and loud when Bud and Lou came on the screen. (We were young, but we recognized mega-talent when we saw it.)

Now, it is so wonderful to actually own a copy this DVD, and even more wonderful to be able to buy extras at this low price and pass them on to kids, so that they can discover Bud and Lou for themselves!

950476,3,6304819463,"This film, while certainly Abbott and Costello, gives one a somewhat different view of the comedy team.  There is a story line with less typical cutting up while still maintaining their persona.  There is more true acting and Lou Costello shows a little more of a serious side.  He also shows his acrobatic abilities and that he really isn't that little fat guy he portrays so well (his tights give that away).  The film will give you a small peek at the real talent of the duo.

On the technical side, the movie doesn't quite measure up and seems amateurish in spots.  Special effects were often poor, even for the time period.  Casting could have been better and the giant isn't even with the Herman Munster shoes.  He seems a little underfed, too.  The color is poor and sometimes blotchy.  While the production obviously did not merit a large budget, it's a pretty fair family film that the youngsters will like.

After all is said though, if you are a fan of the genre or of Abbott and Costello, you must get this one for your collection.",1400025600,,1043,4.524064171122995
950477,3,6304819463,"I'm a fan of Abbott and Costello and was curious about the films not included on their massive box set that covers almost every film they starred in. 'Jack and the Beanstalk' was one of the 5 films not included on that set, but finding a decent print on DVD wasn't going to be easy having been in public domain for many years. I tried a few different releases with some disappointing results, washed out and blurry video and low audio. I happened to come across a release by Goodtimes video and found the print to be very good. The color and picture are clear and despite having some scratches, it is a pleasure to see this film looking this good. The Goodtime release is out of print, but you can find copies of it for under $5.00. If you're a A&B complete-ist, this is is the one you want....at least until a proper special edition is released.

JACK AND THE BEANSTALK (1952) is a fun family musical that has Lou Costello as a babysitter and in a dream sequence, Jack of the kid's fable. Bud Abbott's dual roles are Lou's lazy, manipulative partner and later he's money-grubbing Mr. Dinklepuss.

This was originally issued on part amber tone/part Supercinecolor film. Supercinecolor was always an iffy proposition, similar in quality to pre-1935 Technicolor's 2-strip process. Oh it's color all right, but strange hues abound.

A bit of history:
Late in their UNIVERSAL days, the boys decided to independently produce two color movies. The first was Bud's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ABBOTT-COSTELLO-MEET-CAPTAIN-KIDD/dp/B0001I9BSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET CAPTAIN KIDD</a>, the second being Lou's, this far more charming work. In it, he sings:

I fear nothing when I am in the right!
Who ever pushes me around will find me full of fight!
I fear nothing when I do nothing wrong
And so I toddle on my way and sing a merry song!

I'll be defiant and be obstreperous
If any giant should try and salt-and-pepper us!
And I'll rise up, up to my fullest height
'Cause I fear absolutely nothing when I'm in the right!

A man believes what he believes
And by these principles a man must stand
A time will come for rolled-up sleeves
And it might help to have a fist on hand!

If I believe that I am right
There's only one thing to be done
I don't go looking for a fight
But I have never run away from one!

But only fools will take a dare
And there are things that only fools defy
If I smell trouble in the air
I hold my breath until the breeze blows by!

I'll snort defiance like some rhinoceros
Afraid of giants, now, isn't that preposseros!
I find courage a thing of great delight!
Sing fee-dilly-ay and fee-dilly-aye with steady hand and steely eye!

I fear nothing when I am in the right!",1394236800,2,2133,4.9164345403899725

Like Africa Screams, Jack and the Beanstalk now exists in the public domain. However, finding a decent print of it on DVD is a tough task for collectors wishing to have a complete collection (there were eight, non-Universal films featuring the duo). The GoodTimes Entertainment version is often lauded as the best of the bunch, and it stays true to the original cinematic release. It appears this print was originally a cinema reel, as the markings in the top right hand corner, to indicate when to switch projectors, are included.

The picture quality is just about where you'd expect it to be in a film of this sort. It hasn't been scrubbed clean like the Universal releases, and in comparison it looks quite messy. It is a better print than other company's versions though, and that's why I've given it four stars.

The ""gunpowder-in-the-eggs"" scene is a mess with splices and frames missing. There is severe negative damage, watermarks, etc. The color varies from OK to reddish-green. (Like old Eastmancolor.)

About the story:  Put your digital TV on a softer focus and enjoy it anyway.  It's a cute, short, low budget production to be sure, but not without its charm. Lou is knocked out while babysitting a precocious kid and dreams up the entire story. Of course, he is Jack and Abbott is the butcher who climbs up the beanstalk with him. The songs range from OK to terrible, but Buddy Baer plays a great giant. He's related to Max Baer (Sr.) who played the giant in ""Mama's Little Pirate-Little Rascals"".

All in all for the price I got it at, it wasn't so bad I certainly wouldn't wanted to have paid full price for it.

Basically Abbott & Costello get a job babysitting (for a brat) and Costello falls asleep while reading the classic fairy tale (or rather the kid he's supposed to be watching, reads it to Costello!)

However, it was really dumb. The opening scenes (before the fairytale begins) were kind of funny. I did think some of this movie was humorous, but not enough to redeem it. First of all, there are several really long, boring, stupid songs that people sing in that kind of Disney cartoon style. Second, there's a stupid romance between a prince and princess that I don't recall ever being in any version of Jack and the Beanstalk I've ever read. The prince is a sissified looking fellow who isn't handsome, and both he and the princess are stupid and boring. Third, a whole lot of the movie seems to be trying to copy the earlier (and brilliant) Africa Screams. For instance, Abbot and Costello walk underneath the giant without noticing it (just as they do underneath the Orangatang Gargantua in Africa Screams), as well as Costello's character being bullied by Abbott's character. Also, Jack goes around without seeing the giant standing five feet away from him.
There's other things that seem to be ripped off from Africa Screams, but even more than that is the really long and stupid dance that Jack has with the giant lady.
I haven't been this bored by a movie since I can't remember when. Even though it's only 70 minutes long, it seems like it's about twice as long. So, you've been warned! Africa Screams is way better than this stupid movie.",1310169600,,1448,4.682352941176471

The answer is Turner Classic Movies, which has shown a fairly glistening print, with good sound and even ok ""Cinecolor,"" and with the black-and-white portions in Sepia-tone, just as was originally done with M-G-M's ""The Wizard of Oz,"" which this picture very cheaply but honorably imitates. Some laughs are unintentional, like any number featuring some of the clunkiest dancers in Hollywood -- but Lou does very well by his song ""I Fear Nothing (When I am in the Right)"" and the opening theme music is fine.  This was a Warner Bros. release, so the Warner Bros. shield SHOULD be at the beginning of the film. Also, the names ""Abbott and Costello"" are on the screen in those credits for the longest time I have ever seen stars names held like that.  They deserved it.

'Jack and the Beanstalk' was one of the 5 films not included on that set, but finding a decent print on DVD wasn't going to be easy having been in public domain for many years. I tried a few different releases with some disappointing results, washed out and blurry video and low audio. I happened to come across a release by Goodtimes video and found the print to be very good. The color and picture are clear and despite having some scratches, it is a pleasure to see this film looking this good. The Goodtime release is out of print, but you can find copies of it for under $5.00. If you're a A&B complete-ist, this is is the one you want....at least until a proper special edition is released.

The film itself is fairly enjoyable for the young at heart and A&B fans. It's of course very juvenile, but has its charms. If you grew up watching it, then you will have fond memories of it.

950769,4,6304819463,"The color spectrum in JACK AND THE BEANSTALK (1952) has never appeared quite right, not even when the movie was touring theaters. This is due to an inferior two-strip process known by various names, but here called Supercinecolor. This film wasn't sensitive to purples and pinks, so faces tend to look orange or red. With an emulsion on both sides of a single celluloid strip, the colors that -are- there fade faster and stock is more susceptible to scratch damage and other types of blemishes.

This was the second and final Cinecolor comedy that Bud and Lou produced independent of UNIVERSAL (the first was ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET CAPTAIN KIDD) and despite the presence of Charles Laughton in the other, ""Jack"" is the superior work (probably why as of 3/10, A&C Meets Kidd isn't available on DVD).

Here, the opening and closing ""modern"" stories bookending Jack's fabled climb into the clouds are sepiatoned. In this delighful tale, Costello as the boy cheated out of the family cow by Mr. Dinklepuss (Abbott, who gives him a handful of ""magic"" beans), sings most gloriously:

I fear nothing when I am in the right!
Who ever pushes me around will find me full of fight!
I fear nothing when I do nothing wrong

I'll be defiant and be obstreperous

A man believes what he believes
And by these principles a man must stand
A time will come for rolled-up sleeves
And it might help to have a fist on hand!

If I believe that I am right
There's only one thing to be done
I don't go looking for a fight
But I have never run away from one!

But only fools will take a dare
And there are things that only fools defy

950771,4,6304819463,"JACK AND THE BEANSTALK (1952) is a fun family musical that has Lou Costello as a babysitter and in a dream sequence, Jack of the kid's fable. Bud Abbott's dual roles are Lou's lazy, manipulative partner and later he's money-grubbing Mr. Dinklepuss.

This was originally issued on part amber tone/part Supercinecolor film. Supercinecolor was always an iffy proposition, similar in quality to pre-1935 Technicolor's 2-strip process. Oh it's color all right, but strange hues abound.

A bit of history:
Late in their UNIVERSAL days, the boys decided to independently produce two color movies. The first was Bud's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ABBOTT-COSTELLO-MEET-CAPTAIN-KIDD/dp/B0001I9BSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET CAPTAIN KIDD</a>, the second being Lou's, this far more charming work. In it, he sings:

I fear nothing when I am in the right!
Who ever pushes me around will find me full of fight!
I fear nothing when I do nothing wrong
And so I toddle on my way and sing a merry song!

I'll be defiant and be obstreperous
If any giant should try and salt-and-pepper us!
And I'll rise up, up to my fullest height
'Cause I fear absolutely nothing when I'm in the right!

A man believes what he believes
And by these principles a man must stand
A time will come for rolled-up sleeves
And it might help to have a fist on hand!

If I believe that I am right
There's only one thing to be done
I don't go looking for a fight
But I have never run away from one!

But only fools will take a dare
And there are things that only fools defy
If I smell trouble in the air
I hold my breath until the breeze blows by!

I'll snort defiance like some rhinoceros
Afraid of giants, now, isn't that preposseros!
I find courage a thing of great delight!
Sing fee-dilly-ay and fee-dilly-aye with steady hand and steely eye!

I fear nothing when I am in the right!",1265846400,,1909,4.903726708074534

950845,5,6304819463,"No need for me to review the movie since you're purchasing this as a collector, right?
So heres the details on the Good Times Home Video Version

Filmed in 1951 (release 1952) using the ""Spherical"" Cinematographic Process in the Academy Standard Ratio of 1.37:1, this presentation gives us the Full Frame (1.33:1) which is exactly what the director intended us to see.
The original coloring of the film was as so:
** Modern Story:Black and White  (Sepiatone);
** Fanasy story: Color (Supercinecolor)

This DVD-5, MPEG2 encoded Movie was about 7 Mbps on Average (with the total disc at 7.16 Mbps)

The audio is a little weak, but definitely clear and intelligible. Dolby Digital 2.0 (Dual Mono) at 192 Kbps.

While the film still appears a bit washed out in comparison to modern presentations, it STELLAR!!! for a 1952 public domain film presentation on DVD.  Hence, on a scale of 1-5 (3 being average modern DVD) this would score at 2.85/5) Very good indeed.  (Especially in comparison to the ""Reel Classic Film"" edition of this movie.  Just don't buy that version as long as this one is available.)

Pick it up ... its worth the collection!",1247443200,7,1141,4.81025641025641
950846,2,6304819463,"No need to discuss the movie; if you're looking for this film its because you're a collector looking to add to your library.
This review is ONLY FOR THE RCF (REEL CLASSIC FILM)edition of this film.

Someone destroyed the movie by hard matting the Academy Ratio (1.37:1) presentation, and recording it on the DVD-R! as widescreen.

It thus appears letterboxed on the full frame. (Letterboxed down to 1.98:1 ratio - What did they think they were doing -  Creating a VistaVision presentation? heavens).

Luckily, on my equipment, I'm able to restore the correct aspect ratio for viewing (squeezing it back to 1.33:1), but then the obvious problem is the top and bottom of the film is missing.  (When was the last time you saw the ""Warner Bros"" logo cut off at the bottom so that you can only see about 1/2 of the WB shield?....)

At least they kept the film color presentation in tact. (Modern Story:
Black and White  (Sepiatone); Fanasy story: Color (Supercinecolor))

The result is a very soft, (but clear and clean) presentation of the film on a DVD-R.

Audio....hhhmmmm... I'd like to not bother...but, since I've started:  MPEG-1 dual mono at 224kbps.  Remember when you had that mix-tape that you played so often that it wore thin. So thin that the sound actually started to sound like it was in a tin can -- and squeaked!!!  Yep... no joke.  No audio compression was applied.

Avg video Bit rate 4.88 Mbps, Total Avg Authoring Bitrate 9.0 Mbps

Okay, so maybe RCF isn't at fault here.  Maybe they just presented whatever they had, so let's not lambaste them.  But suffice it to say, if you can't get your hands on a better copy, this version will do quite admirable. (It is clean and clear).

But, if you're looking for something to add to the library...skip this presention RCF has distributed.  Sadly, I don't have any other copy but an old VHS...maybe I'll take that to the local video store and let them convert it... it can't be any worse.

950852,3,6304819463,"Having not seen Abbott and Costello's ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" in several decades, I have to say that is so much more than I remember. It is really just inspired in it's, to borrow a style from the Sherman Brothers, ""Awfulosity"". This film is really a turkey, but a golden one, (or however gold photographs in the miracle of SUPERcineCOLOR?).

Clearly this film was influenced by the MGM film ""The Wizard of Oz"", which incidentally was re-issued for the first time in 1950 or 51. This film was released in 1952. You get the picture. The opening and closing sequences, in the real world, are shot in sepia (though in this print it looks like grainy, contrasty B&W). All the principle characters in the color ""fantasy"" sequence are introduced in the modern day world and telegraph their relationships in the fantasy later on, some going as far as showing the costumes they will be wearing minutes later.

Really, the costumes, the make up (on the cow, Henry), the hair (particularly on Bud and the prince), the songs, the choreography, EVERYthing in this picture is just so wrong it's right. Lou's shtick and acting are really so far beneath him, except in a really funny dance that he and the scullery maid do in which he gets the stuffing smacked out of him. My favorite numbers, however, include the solos with the strange looking, slightly cock-eyed prince and the ""big"" dance numbers with the innane lip-syncing townsfolk and the ""June Terrible Dancers!""

And the ""Giant"", well, you will just have to see him for yourself, but I will say that if I were him, I would have asked for more flattering lighting on my close ups.

It was fun revisiting this film after so many years. If you have seen it. See it again. If you haven't seen it, I know you will enjoy your introduction to this classic comedy........ of errors.",1146614400,,1820,4.660436137071651

  Plot Summary:

 Jack is a farmer boy who is to take his family's last few coins to buy a cow at the local market. Once in town, he is fooled by the slick Butcher Dinkelpuss into buying magic beans instead. He takes the beans home and plants them out in his yard. The next morning, a giant beanstalk stretches into the sky. Knowing that a giant terrorizes the land, Jack decides to climb up the beanstalk to search for his treasures. He is accompanied by the greedy butcher, who also wants to find the giant's treasures. Jack and Dinkelpuss battle the giant and make the land peaceful again.

  ROUTINES & HILARIOUS MOMENTS:

 Trivia (from imdb.com):(1)This is the first of only tow color movies that Abbott and Costello made.

As one of the other reviewers mentioned, this is similar to the ""Wizard of Oz"" in that there is a dream sequence that transports the ""hero"" (Jack) back in time. While it's a fairy tale, there are moral overtones.

The greedy butcher loses everything in trying to hold on to the goose who lays the golden egg. The evil giant is defeated. Jack, who is an unsuspecting hero comes out on top at the end. True romance comes through as the prince and princess discover they love each other for who they are and not the titles they hold.

The original ""Super Cinecolor"" (less expensive and impressive than Technicolor) is generally very good indeed; I noticed a few instances of Costello's green costume shifting to blue-green, probably owing to different surviving film elements. Goodtimes did a fine job restoring this, and this DVD offers excellent value for the budget price.
The movie itself is a pleasant children's story with music. After a ""modern"" prologue in monochrome, Bud and Lou adapt their usual sharpie-and-patsy roles to colorful fairytale settings, and Buddy Baer is an excellent foil as the fearsome giant.

The natural limitations of the time  the obvious sets, costumes, props, and wallpaper backgrounds  all add to the charm of the film.  Bud Abbott is great in his dual roles as the scheming butcher, Mr. Dinglepuss, in the fairy-tale and the manipulative agent in the real world, and Lou Costello is charming and hilarious in his dual roles as the kid/adult Jack and as the baby-sitter.  They both give great performances and great laughs in their roles.
The next best performances are Buddy Baer  effectively mean and grumpy as the bullying police chief and giant  and the incomparably beautiful and lovely, Dorothy Ford, who is ravishing both as the secretary and as Polly.  Buddy Baer makes an effective lumbering, deep-throated, and growling giant, sharing some hilarious scenes with Costello; and Dorothy Ford just lights up the screen with her beauty, grace, and charm.  She has a memorable dance-duet with Costello that is both hilarious and sweet.
My only wish is that they, the filmmaker and writer, would have chosen to have her character, Polly, ending up with Jack as his sweet-heart at the end of the fairy-story.  (The last we see of her in the entire film is her riding upon Henry the cow, escaping the giants castle  what a missed opportunity and waste!) The ending in both worlds is good, but it would have been another very nice touch to have Costello standing up to the big bully policeman (Baer) and winning the secretary (Dorothy).  Why cant he (Costello) get the girl (Dorothy) in both worlds?
Besides this, the only weakness in the film is its two leading lovers, James Alexander, as the prince and, Shaye Cogan, as the princess  my goodness: they are as boring and lackluster now as they were when I was child!  Their singing scene together in the garden is WAY TOO LONG. Their dialogue scenes are bearable  their singing scenes (especially the princes loud volume) much less so.  Thank God for fast-forwarding!
Thankfully, the singing and the songs of the townspeople, the giant (Baer), and Jack (Costello) and Mr. Dinglepuss (Abbott) is MUCH MORE enjoyable and memorable, being teasingly cheesy and witty and funny.
The fairy-tale based film is a classic, and though its not their best film, its still one of my favorites of theirs and definitely worth owning if you're an Abbott and Costello fan (and love the Jack and the Beanstalk story).

One day, someone who had a superior print all along will pop up with it and all of these copies will be in the trash. For now, this copy is among the best.
