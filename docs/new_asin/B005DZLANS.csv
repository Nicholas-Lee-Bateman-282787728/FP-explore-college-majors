8467792,4,B005DZLANS,"I'm sorry that Mr. Banducci didn't feel that I, as a filmmaker, or my project on Rome has any merit; but then I see that he awarded 5 stars to ""Girls Just Want To Have Fun,"" so that helped explain a few things. It seems that Scott Emery - another reviewer of ROMA - was able to grasp a few more of the intended subtleties of the project, although I feel his award of 5 stars was too great.

Either way, I am proud of the work that I did on this project. It is a personal observation of one of the great cities of the world, presented in a style that is a departure from the standard. It may not be for everyone, but to dismiss it as ""idiocy"" says more about the reviewer than the creator.",1397865600,,688,3.9855072463768115

Run-of-the mill views of Rome accompanied by irritating musical compositions by what appear to be the producer's friends. No narrative, although a list of the sites seen periodically appears. What does appear repeatedly, and irritatingly, is a list of credits of Mr. DeLorenzo and the other perpetrators of this idiocy.

Mr. DeLorenzo seems to think that he has artistic talent. He does not.",1369612800,,393,5.140625
8467794,5,B005DZLANS,"Through elegant, respectful and creatively constructed visuals and a haunting and serenely moving musical score, filmmaker DeLorenzo entices us to examine Rome not solely as a destination within the romance of an Italian sojourn, but rather as a still-enriching and inspiring manifestation of the most significant of western civilizations.  This film, in 47 short minutes of artistically rendered and affectionate portraits of ancient structures from both the pagan and Christian eras, requests a humble respect from the viewer, but also engenders an intrigued yearning for greater understanding of Roman influence.  After viewing this arresting film, one will desire to see Rome more completely, the appreciation displayed here prompting renewed desire to delve more deeply into this singular culture whether in person, via published works, or both.

DeLorenzo's first two sections, titled the Eternal City and Sopra, are a carefully collected and leisurely paced series of images that ask us to immerse ourselves into the daunting implausibility of the Roman experience:  its vast size, duration, impact, might, and yet, fallibility - and to again consider that this human social creation began over 2,000 years ago.  Here he makes no secret of his desire for us to see the ancient structure in a natural setting, birds traversing the frame, the stark white and blue of clouds and sky and the rustling of trees allowing us to believe ever so slightly that some portion of what humans render might truly be as timeless as nature itself.  DeLorenzo is not afraid to linger with his visuals, all well-considered compositions that typically juxtapose shadow and light and make excellent use of visual reflection - particularly in the panoramic night shots - and expose the intricate craft, careful geometry and empathetic humanism of the Roman architectural mind. His patient pacing allows us, with the assistance of the enchanting score, to contemplate the realm of human capability and motivation in the classical Roman experience even two thousand years hence.  One is consistently asked to look closely, particularly upward, and ponder what captured the thoughts of the ones who envisioned and engineered all of this, wonder at how this came to be commissioned, appreciate its enduring beauty, and yes, imagine the hardship of those enlisted to construct it.

DeLorenzo devotes the third section of his homage to an exploration of the Christian aspect of the later Roman Empire through a dazzling visual and musically reverential exposition of several churches in Rome and its surroundings.  He captures the exquisitely detailed and refined nature of the art within these temples of piety, permitting us to be in awe of man's devotion, allowing us to feel the inspiration that must have captured those who created these incredible works of beauty and still inspire the devout today.  The time and expenditure embodied in these magnificent constructs demands us to respect the reverence of those involved, even if we do not share the full conviction of that faith.  Touchingly, DeLorenzo dedicates this section, titled Visitor, to the memory of his father.

All sites filmed in these first three sections are carefully listed within those sections, permitting the viewer to note the artifacts for future research and offering quiet tribute to the creators.

In the final section, Images of Rome, the filmmaker loosens his hand in a technical sense, using various film stocks, drawn portraits, expressionistic  overlays, variations on film speed and exposure and interesting image dissolves to allow us to view Rome through a modernistic gaze.  There are no spoken words - there are none in the entire film, for that matter - but these techniques allow one to sense a bit of the frenzy of today's Rome, reminding us that it is also an important modern metropolis and moreover, to also realize that Rome was likely never a place for the faint of heart.  As ""Roma"" rightly dignifies the grandeur of Rome, asking us to think deeply about its meaning, there is another historical truth: Rome in its lengthy prime probably always bustled and shook; that the Republic and Empire, for several centuries the apex of intellect and politics, of architecture and art, and of course of the Christian faith, was a constantly vibrant and robust place.

Danny DeLorenzo has done a great service to those who hope to understand the enduring place of Rome.  This gracefully artistic tribute has opened an intriguingly fresh door into the most influential civilization in western history - perhaps of all history.  This short but rich film inspires with a carefully balanced and appropriate synthesis of sight and sound, rejuvenating our exploratory senses and renewing our wonder for the timeless mystery of Rome.",1326672000,,4796,5.229465449804433
