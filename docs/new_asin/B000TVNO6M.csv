They do move right along so if you are new to Yoga or maybe a little rusty in the joints, it may be a little much. I have been practicing for a while so I find their posses effective and also a good cardio workout. Its only 30mins and there is a modified version to follow demonstrated by one of the practioners. (at least 3 other people practice with Rodney and Mariel, so don't be intimidated. The Core muscles are worked but in Yoga form. So No jumping up and down.  This is a Yoga DvD.",1381708800,7,629,4.147540983606557

8211191,5,B000TVNO6M,"I love this video, great instruction 2 people take turns explaining poses. I don't have time for full hour yoga so this 30 min was perfect. I plan to buy more of this series if there are more.  Yoga can be kind of sleepy, but I think this video is a great workout.",1471478400,,264,3.981132075471698
8211192,4,B000TVNO6M,"This video is a good workout for yoga with only 30 minutes of run time. The stretches are easy to do but you still get a good sweat going for the workout.  I really enjoy it as there aren't many good yoga programs out there that are only 30 minutes long.

The one downfall, and the reason I didn't give it 5 starts, is that there is just continuous talking throughout the video.  It would be better if they did some talking but then had some breaks while you were doing the stretching.  I had to keep looking up to see if I was missing something during my stretches.  I would recommend this.",1465776000,,591,4.1946902654867255
8211193,5,B000TVNO6M,Love this workout and would highly recommend!  It's great that there are modified poses for people like me.,1440374400,,107,4.944444444444445
8211194,3,B000TVNO6M,"Decent workout, but some silly ""exercises"" detract from focus and intensity of the workout.",1414368000,,91,5.571428571428571

8211196,5,B000TVNO6M,"This DVD offers a really good core workout. At first it seems easy, but by the end, you have really worked all of your core muscles.",1393891200,3,132,4.115384615384615
8211197,5,B000TVNO6M,"This video is a great workout for the entire body.  This is how I build my strength, flexibility and stamina before moving onto the 50-minute workout.  Most people do not consider yoga to be a workout, but this program gets your heart rate elevated, muscles toned, and leaves you feeling great.",1393718400,5,294,4.745098039215686
8211198,3,B000TVNO6M,"I give this 3 stars because I was shopping for a yoga video but this workout is really 60/40 cardio/yoga. That being said, I really liked the video as they do work a lot of muscle groups. I'd say its for beginners-intermediate.",1388534400,3,227,4.428571428571429
