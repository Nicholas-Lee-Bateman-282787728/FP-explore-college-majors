8672107,5,B004APXXQ4,"A great movie and award winner of Viewers Choice: Best Snowboard Video 2010 at the acclaimed NYC Snow Film Fest for good reason. This movie gets you on the edge of your seat and you don't relax till the title bout has ended and a new champion has been awarded. Standout parts from Patrick McCarthy, Austen Sweetin, Nick Ennen, Manuel Diaz, and more. Spoiler alert: One of the gnarliest pros ever Scotty Wittlake even makes a guest appearance in this one.",1291420800,,454,4.617283950617284
