8208069,1,B000T8DRCG,"Nothing but scenes of water - no words - only sounds of water - actually looked like Malibu lagoon - no proof that this was anywhere near Hawaii! I kept watching hoping that I would learn something about Maui....nothing, nada, zilch!!!!

This purchase was a total waste of money.",1257811200,,279,4.6938775510204085
8208070,1,B000T8DRCG,"This is the worst DVD I have ever purchased. I could make a better video using my cell phone. Close up shot's of waves or plant life and even a dog does not show the true beauty of Maui.
Do not waste your money on the video!",1231200000,3,224,3.7872340425531914
8208071,1,B000T8DRCG,"All this is, is a glorified home movie. No talking, no way to know what part of Maui your looking at, and very poor videography and shot setups. Please don't pick this if you are wanting to know anything about Maui. I wasted my money, don't waste yours.",1230940800,,253,4.291666666666667
