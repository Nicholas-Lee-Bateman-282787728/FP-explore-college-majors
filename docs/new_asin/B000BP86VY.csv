8090420,3,B000BP86VY,"This is not a movie, it is a film of a theater production. Fewer characters, less scenery, less movement. It is sort of a farce with mistaken identity etc. but it is also 2 love stories. I like the theater, but I like it in a theater. If I had realized what this was I would have passed on it.",1499731200,,293,3.9
8090421,2,B000BP86VY,"There aren't many recorded productions of Sheridan's 1775 farce, The Rivals. This one features wonderful sets and costumes and well chosen  music . The video work is high quality.

The humor in Sheridan's farces is conveyed in words. This is the play that gave us Mrs. Malaprop, and later, the word malapropism. Unfortunately, this staging  obscures Sheridan's  words with way too rapid fire delivery,  exaggerated cut-glass trills, and ill-timed squawks. The actors make faces and say, or worse still, yell their lines at each other instead of  talking to each other and the audience. Clownish stage business usually adds nothing to a farce. In this production, the clownish stage business annoys and distracts.

I sat through this because I've never seen staging of The Rivals and wanted to see it through to its end. Much of the performance was painful to watch.",1486252800,,865,5.049295774647887
8090422,5,B000BP86VY,"This is a taping of a stage performance before an audience, so it's a genuine theater
experience. The cast is adept, the production is faithful to the period, and the text is
authentic, with no emendations. I don't like the stingy scene cuts--each act of the
original gets a new jump, so you may have to watch for thirty minutes before you
get a new scene selection.  Still, this really is Sheridan's The Rivals, on stage,
very well conveyed. So how can you go wrong?",1386633600,3,467,4.4941176470588236
8090423,5,B000BP86VY,"While this is known as a Restoration comedy, the producer points out that it was written well after that period. Nevertheless, it has all the trappings of such: comedy of manners, the screen scenes, mistaken identities, love tangles. It is more a satire, not so much on life then but on Sheridan's own young life and the gossip surrounding it. What shows that it is post-Restoration is that there is in the play a psychological layer, which the producer milks maybe a bit much. I found Faulkland's angst tiring at times, and the bustly mannerisms of Julia a bit overdone. The father/son scenes are Absolutely excellent, and Mrs. Malaprop nicely delivered. The whole cast in fact does the play justice, with finesse and intelligence. It was filmed for TV onstage at the Bristol Old Vic before a live audience, and as so many productions are now done in mock-up studios and on location where conversations are heard sotto-voce, it was odd to hear stage voices projecting during close-ups - a strange mix of studio intimacy and the remoteness of the live stage. Also, after seeing so much theater now filmed on location, I found the fixed Zen stage setting somewhat claustrophobic despite the clever scene changes. But this is all my subjective viewpoint. All in all the play moves at a brisk pace with wit and humour - Sheridan's genius - and I shall watch it again.",1239494400,9,1364,4.7594936708860756
8090424,5,B000BP86VY,"I saw a live version of the play recently and missed a lot of the dialogue because of the English accents and unfamiliarity of the script. So, I rented the dvd and totally enjoyed it. You might need to rewind here and there so that you can get a chance to understand the dialogue but it was very well done and fun. I highly recommend it.",1207785600,10,337,4.121212121212121
8090425,5,B000BP86VY,"Although I am hardly an authority on the theater, it does not take a genius to see that this production is something special.  The acting is wonderful, the camera work is excellent (especially compared to most recordings of stage events) and the play itself is amazing.  The performance was done in period costumes, just as it was when it was in 1775, and the language of the 1775 text is retained just as Sheridan wrote it.  I have noticed nothing in this performance that detracts from Sheridan's original vision.

I can guarantee you will have a great time watching this; it is completely worth the money to have this gem.",1138147200,25,625,4.654545454545454
