8273871,5,B0019F8EA8,It's a pity that Bruce Lee didn't have more interview footage of his extraordinary career and life.(Darth Vader voice)My Lee collection is now complete.,1388275200,,152,5.375
8273872,5,B0019F8EA8,Well for anyone that is looking for this dvd I would reconsider this one because it looks like a boot leg dvd and i'm not joking I have to turn the volume way up above normal granted it is an old interview but I seen better on the internet that looked remastered on youtube not trying to bring anyone down but when you buy something you want to get the bang for your buck you know what i'm saying.,1379030400,,397,4.037974683544304
8273873,3,B0019F8EA8,The video was a bit blurry but it was ok because it is a replacement for my library. unfortunately for someone whom maybe viewing this video for the first time it may seem like it was recorded in a back room. It would be great if the video could be up dated by colorizing and enhancing the audio. But if you are a BRUCE LEE fan it is a must to have by all means.,1347926400,,362,3.84
