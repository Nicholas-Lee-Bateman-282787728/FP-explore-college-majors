8677110,5,B00NB1XN8G,"What can I say about Sgtr. Rory Miller that hasn't already been said?  Ok, here's a stab at it...this may sound like a bro-mance review of his work, but there really isn't anything I can say that I don't like about his resources, either book or DVD.

As a veteran, martial artist and correctional officer, he's got a broad resume of both formal training and street situations with the worst of the worst in our society.  As an example, he tells of how prisoners would fight one another for the slightest offense and yet catch the head of their victim so they wouldn't get a skull fracture when they hit the concrete floor making for a more serious offense.  The nuances of the violent mind are peeled back so we can gain from his experience without having to experience it firsthand.

All in all, this is a must-have set of resources for anyone interested in martial arts, protective services, law enforcement, etc.

Well done...Sgt. Miller!",1533168000,,941,4.672727272727273
