8642039,5,B00IGRO3YS,I live in United States and have enjoyed watching Michael Portillo travels on trains (Continental and simply in Britain). I have watched the series on our local PBS channels. I wanted to order DVD for my collection but warned that format does not fit USA. I also have Amazon video Prime and does not stream this series.  Will this change soon?,1491264000,,343,4.622950819672131
8642040,5,B00IGRO3YS,This is one of the better travel shows that I've watched.  I'm glad that Michael Portillo makes the point that the British and the Germans got along very well before the First World War.  The Second World War destroyed this good relationship.  It's sad that we've come to the point where Brexit and the Refugee Crisis are threatening to put the nail in the coffin.  It makes you wish for the happier time that Bradshaw's describes.,1475366400,2,431,4.631578947368421
