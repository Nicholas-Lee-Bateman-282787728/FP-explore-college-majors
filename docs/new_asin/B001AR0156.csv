8278862,4,B001AR0156,"If you are paying what I paid for it (around $5) then it's worth an evening of your time.  It highlights the major areas of the parks, shares some insider info, and appeals to rock climbers and tourists as well.  Some of the shots are a little blurry or shaky, but overall it's a decent presentation.  Don't expect BBC or Discover Channel.  But again, you aren't paying those premium prices.  It also has some nice bonus video of other national parks and monuments with interesting info.  More than anything, I enjoyed seeing more of the park as most documentaries focus on animals for some reason.  While animals are certainly an important part of any ecosystem, it seems most documentaries overplay the same bits about baby bear cubs playing, or wolves chasing prey.  This shows more of the scenery and areas you may hike in, which I appreciate.",1426032000,,847,4.714285714285714

8278864,4,B001AR0156,"First off I would like to say that I own a Samsung Blu-ray player and a 19"" Samsung TV. I only can view this in 720p. I am very impressed with the video quality that I have seen on this DVD. I know that a lot of people try to compare these kind of videos to the BBC videos like Planet Earth. That is a whole other level of documentary making. There are some scenes that seem to appear that they were not shot in high-definition.

This DVD consists of two videos, Yosemite National Park and Wild National Park. Both videos run for 50 minutes. Yosemite consists of beautiful video footage of the park from all different locations. They show a variety of footage from scenery, animals, lodging, hiking, rock climbing, etc. You get different views of the park along with a small brief history of the park. The history is not as detailed as Ken Burns' National Park DVD series. They talk a little bit about John Muir and Ansel Adams. They also show the 212 mile John Muir trail and the mountain named after Ansel Adams.

This is a great video to watch if your interested in going to Yosemite and have never been there. I would love to go sometime. I did learn that you can climb Half-Dome and it is a 17-hour hiking trip. You see some video footage of this. They also take you to different areas in the high country as well as the valley. Hiking trails like the Bridal Falls, etc. You see Hetch Hetchy and how they are looking at restoring the valley. El Captian is shown a lot and shows people climbing the rock face. The video also informs you about rock climbing instructors that help you climb in Yosemite.

They do show a hotel that is there and it is beautiful. The video also takes you to different campsites that you can stay at. They also share with you how to get away from crowds. There is a good part spent on bear safety and shows how much damage bears can do to your automobiles if you leave food in it. I believe there is a bear tour you can take.

The Wild National Park is all about animals in a variety of National Parks around the country. Everglades, Yosemite, Yellowstone, Grand Tetons, etc. You have bears salmon fishing, people taking care of animals, rattlesnakes and the danger they possess. It is all nature and no except for the guides and experts that talk about the animals. This is a quick look at some but not all the different animals that roam our National Parks.

Overall I gave it a 4-star rating. I would have liked to have given it a 4.5-star rating. Some of the video quality is not great but overall it looked good to me at 720p. I own this DVD and the Yellowstone one as well. Highly recommended for viewing pleasure.",1261699200,5,2652,4.349494949494949
8278865,2,B001AR0156,"A little bit disappointed. The scenes were specticular; however, the filming quality was not so good. Made me feel like watching DVD. If you ever watched ""OVER ALASKA"", you would understand the difference.

Overall, I do not think it is worth the money for a blu-ray title.",1230076800,9,273,4.808510638297872
8278866,3,B001AR0156,Just like the Grand Canyon video. Quality could have been better. Needs a lesson from the OVER series of Videos.,1225670400,9,112,4.65
