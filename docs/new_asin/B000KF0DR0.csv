8155952,1,B000KF0DR0,I only watched three minutes and I knew this was a lame excuse for a movie. Don't waste your time!,1455580800,,98,3.95
8155953,3,B000KF0DR0,"The story line in this film actually has some promise, not a bad premise for a film, the trouble begins with the filming, acting and directing - it's really bad. I'm talking about really, really bad acting, really, really bad audio, really, really bad camera work and horrible editing. Even though you only see the microphone in one shot, it's just not good,
In a nutshell, a coven of witches lead by the decendent of a witch who was killed 300 years ago, successfully manages to summon the spirit of the ancestorial witch. Now I don't claim to be a history guru, but one thing is sure, breast implants and teeth veneers on a three hundred year old spirit are just downright silly. This particular coven that went through the trouble of summoning the ancestor witch appears to purchase their accessories from Party City, The large plastic dagger necklaces they wear with their emo clothing identify them as coven members on their college campus and that's a good thing: as a power symbol it allows them to disrupt class and gain an apology from the professor after the disruption.
This film is not good. The story itself has promise, but it's just not a good film. The actors are inexperienced, the filming is unprofessional and there is no continunity in the audio, it's as if they had to borrow recording equipment from different friends from different friends during the filming.
I'm not sure if this film was a class project or a group of friends joining together for a bit of fun. I do think that some films should be kept between the people that go about creating the project, this is one of those films.",1455235200,,1610,4.6328671328671325

8155955,4,B000KF0DR0,"Yep, this is the first time I watched one of these Sterling Pictures (found it in one of those 50 Movie packs that were so popular over the last decade) and it was my first exposure to actor Randal Malone, stylish, smooth and menacing; he is channeling Vincent Price in this one and brings a little class to the proceedings; ancient vampire creature seeking resurrection plot, yes, stupid people dying for being stupid, yes, and shot on digital, yes. I had a good time with this and if low-bugeters are your thing, give it a shot.",1349481600,,530,4.53125
