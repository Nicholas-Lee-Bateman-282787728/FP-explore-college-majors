8624560,5,B00GME4PYA,"In 2003, when the United States was preparing to invade Iraq, sessions were conducted at the United Nations. The French Foreign Minister, Dominique de Villepin, delivered, in the best spirit of the Enlightenment, an impassioned, reasoned, speech to the Security Council, against the invasion. This movie from Bertrand Tavernier, is a fictionalized account of the events leading up to, and the person who delivered, that speech. He delivers perhaps one of the wittiest and most engaging political satires in recent memory.

Villepin is the inspiration of the Alexandre Taillard de Worms, the French Foreign Minister, played to the tee by Tierry Lhermitte. Tavernier displays cue cards intermittently on the screen featuring quotations from the Greek philosopher Heraclitus. This choice was entirely appropriate. Heraclitus was the philosopher who believed that the essential quality of the world is fire, and de Worms is fire, pure fire. Lhermittes character is energetic, bombastic, and demanding. When issuing his directives he sometimes contradicts himself. He is possessed of a large ego but is not an egomaniac. Lhermitte at times has the character descend into a miniature Inspector Clouseau, but largely the Foreign Minister is tastefully played with all the privilege and panache one could imagine to find in an aristocratic, upper-level government official.

He rules over a clutch of loyal, but exhausted, support staff, one of whom readily admits their brains have been fried in meeting de Worms constant demands.

Into this hornets nest the main protagonist, Arthur Vlaminick, played by Raphael Personnaz, is haplessly thrown to assist the others in writing de Worms speeches, his immanent speech to the UN being one of them, and to assist in the constant barrage of international crises which occur on a seemingly hourly basis.

de Worms speech at the UN, as is de Villepins actual speech, is a model for cautious, rational and deliberate diplomatic action on international affairs. The great irony of this film is that this enlightened speech is the product of an environment that is anything but rational. The portions of de Worms speech at the UN captures the spirit, if not the letter, of de Villepins actual speech.

There is one word that best describes this fine film: Formidable!",1458950400,,2299,5.270491803278689
8624561,5,B00GME4PYA,"The French Minister (a ravishing Thierry  Lhermitte's performance) and his bureaucratic train, show us a crude glance around the backstage of how the speeches are prepared; of course the cinicism and smart humor are not for all tastes. But as soon you engage into the mechanism of the relentless plot whose in and outs will make you laughing.

Bertrand Tavernier is a sacred monster of the French Cinema. That's why you shouldn't surprise yourself of being before such original and caustic film. The script is agile and magnificently written. The cast is another main ingredient.

In sum, one of these brilliant French gems you shouldn't leave it aside.

Absolutely recommended.",1434758400,,678,5.136363636363637
8624562,4,B00GME4PYA,"This movie is enjoyable if you like an intellectual kind of humor.  The movie must be a caricature of the French Foreign Ministry, because I don't believe that France's position on the Iraq war could have been formulated under the chaotic conditions depicted.  It is interesting, however, to see how the French poke fun at themselves and their patterns of thought.",1430092800,2,364,4.950819672131147
