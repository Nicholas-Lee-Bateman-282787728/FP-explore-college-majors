8364309,3,B002CMR33Q,"You get a view of the rails through the front window on this DVD, as the Canadian Pacific train makes it's way through the Canadian Rockies.  There is some spectacular scenery and unique tunnels on the journey too.

The film has some narration, but there are times when you are just looking at the rails and hearing the train's various noises - no talking, no music, etc...  The DVD wraps up with some clips of other Canadian trains including some steam engines from the 1950s.  It's a DVD worth seeing.",1421193600,,503,4.555555555555555
