5669647,5,B00BRKZ0EI,This video was done so professionally...no distortion of the sound and great video of Alanis singing her heart out (as always).,1370131200,,127,5.095238095238095
5669648,3,B00BRKZ0EI,"It's good, but none of her recent work compares to Jagged Little Pill, which for me at least was her best work.",1370131200,,111,4.090909090909091
5669649,5,B00BRKZ0EI,"absolutly love it, Alanis has been one of my all time fav artist for just about 20 years, always blows me away. This blueray has a nice setlist of songs as well some classics that i haven't herd her perform in a long time.",1369612800,,222,4.068181818181818
5669650,3,B00BRKZ0EI,"I'll preface by saying that I'm an Alanis Fan, and by that I mean I keep up with her getting each new release. I mean Beyond ""Jagged Little Pill"". There have been Low points (So called chaos) and High points (Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, Flavors of Entanglement) And then there is the current era, Out on tour for her first album in 4 years ""Havoc and bright Lights"" which, has on almost all accounts been a middle of the road, mid-tempo experience. Alanis usually commands attention, but this time around it's astounding how easily she can just fade into the background, This DVD/blu-ray is not an exception.
 Alanis knows that ""Jagged Little Pill"" is her bread and butter, and instead of wanting to be broken free from the past, she seems to cater to it, with much of the track list being composed off of JLP hits, the non-JLP tracks we get I'm grateful for. What's left of the set-list(a little more than half) is a mix from all her other studio albums with the exception of 2004's ""So called Chaos"", which despite being her weakest album ""Eight easy Steps"" would have been nice. A few more tracks from ""Havoc and Bright Lights"" would have been nice too...but oh wait...didn't I just imply that the album was boring? Well...in a way, It certainly has it's highlights. ""Woman Down"" and ""Numb"" are two that make it on this release, but it would have been nice to hear other amazing cuts from that album, ""celebrity"", ""Lens"", and ""Edge of Evolution"" are severly missed.
 Morissette fell ill with laryngitis shortly after this release, and she may have been getting ill here as her voice isn't at it's strongest, albeit much of that could be blamed on the poor sound mixing at the venue, which while very clear, somehow sounds mis-matched. Alanis notices this two and motions for them to turn her voice up or down, you would think she could get a decent crew who would know what to do what when but that's just not the case. Overall I enjoyed it, I'm just saying I've seen better from her.",1368230400,4,1995,4.5854341736694675
5669651,5,B00BRKZ0EI,"The master wordsmith at work! Alanis wows, as always! A nice mix of tunes from the new cd and favorite oldies.",1368230400,,110,4.285714285714286

5669654,5,B00BRKZ0EI,"Alanis is at her very best in this concert DVD.  Her voice is better than ever, and she is backed by a great band.  If you are already an Alanis fan, this concert is a must have.  If you are on the fence, watch this DVD, or listen to the CD. You will know why she has such ardent fans. 5 stars.",1366675200,16,294,3.7096774193548385

5669659,4,B00BRKZ0EI,I always have been a fan of Alanis and this is a very fine item to watch. A couple of the tunes aren't what I really like but who puts on perfect concerts. She is very talented and it shoes here.,1394150400,,195,3.7804878048780486
5669660,3,B00BRKZ0EI,"I felt that the camera never just stayed in one place for more than 5 sec.  I wanted to watch Alanis perform, not the crowd and the lights and weird angled shots.  Otherwise the music is fantastic and Alanis is wonderful as always.",1391644800,2,231,4.348837209302325

5669664,5,B00BRKZ0EI,"I like Alanis Morissette and this concert was the greatest I ever saw .
I recommend this show very much",1381795200,,103,4.2
5669665,5,B00BRKZ0EI,"Great show.  Loved every bit of it.  A true one-of-a kind talent in full flight!  Well worth every penny and more,",1376265600,,114,4.333333333333333
5669666,4,B00BRKZ0EI,"This is a very good Alanis concert with excellent video and audio quality. The set list is heavy on JLP songs. I would have liked to hear some more songs like ""Everything"" from her other albums. Having seen her live twice, this is a great way to document her live show.",1373673600,2,269,4.294117647058823
5669667,4,B00BRKZ0EI,"Great picture, good sound quality, its like being at a concert. I would recommend if you like Alanis to buy this",1373328000,,112,4.380952380952381
5669668,4,B00BRKZ0EI,"If you have ever had the chance of enjoying an Alanis Morissette concert, then you know how powerful and energetic she is, once she gets on stage; how she can fill the entire stage with her voice and her music, and how incredibly generous she is with her audience.

Those are some of the things that this recording captured through a well picked setlist with very good quality. The highlights for me are the haunting opening act ""I remain"", ""Flinch"", ""All I Really Want"", ""Versions of Violence"", ""Woman Down"" and ""Hand in my Pocket"".

There is one thing I really disliked: No extras. It would've been nice to have some backstage or interviews or a soundcheck or... anything!

All in all, for fans and good music lovers, this is a must.",1372204800,,735,4.595419847328245
5669669,3,B00BRKZ0EI,"As a huge Alanis fan dating back to her first album (saw her three time on her first tour), I was naturally looking forward to the chance to see a show on Blu-Ray. What I received was a bit of a disappointment.
The performance itself was outstanding. Alanis remains one of the most intense and personable artists in music. Which is exactly why this DVD failed, in my estimation.
Given the fact that the DVD is titled ""Alanis Morissette Live In Montreaux,"" I am baffled as to why Alanis receives so little camera time. The sequence is usually five (or less) seconds of Alanis, then multiple shots of her backing band, ending with a wide angle of everyone.
Don't know if this is intentional, but there are a lot more closeup of the band members than there is of Alanis herself. Which is obviously wonderful for the family and friends of the band members. But not so good for those of us who bought a DVD of Alanis Morissette. Perhaps Alanis herself is so self conscious that she wants to limit her camera time. If that is the case, they should title it ""The Alanis Morissette Band Live In Montreaux.""
Of there, there are the camera angle switches every few seconds that ruin so many modern concert videos, but that is almost a given in the modern era.
If you are a huge fan of the musicians who back star performers on tour, this will appeal to you. I will continue to wait for an Alanis concert DVD that actually features Alanis.",1371081600,9,1428,4.4541984732824424
5669670,5,B00BRKZ0EI,THIS WAS A PERFECT ADDITION TO MY COLLECTION OF CONCERTS AND MOVIES AT MY HOME. NICE WAY TO ENJOY AN EVENING HOME ALONE,1370995200,,119,4.217391304347826
5669671,5,B00BRKZ0EI,"Excellent product, the concert is very good, great video and audio quality.  There is also an adequate resolution since it is a blueray disc.",1370822400,,141,4.875
5669672,5,B00BRKZ0EI,I Love her and her music and am glad to see this live.  Worth the purchase and waiting until her new album,1370649600,,106,3.8181818181818183
5669673,5,B00BRKZ0EI,"Firstly, I own several Montreux blu-rays now & all have excellent video & audio quality. Kudos to the folks who put them together.
I've never had the opportunity to see Alanis sing live, except for her appearance at the 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremonies, where she sang 'Wunderkind'(a song I would have really liked to see here). Her setlist could have included that song & some other favorites of mine that were missing but who am I to tell her what to sing? That's just my personal taste & you can't please everybody all the time. That said, I enjoyed most every song anyway, & despite being a crusty old graybeard, I actually got shivers up my spine on at least 3 occasions. She is a truly talented lady, & it's great to see her presented in such a high quality setting.",1370563200,,779,4.492957746478873

8573133,5,B00BRKZ0EI,"Fantastic film. The sound is near perfect even on the crappiest of speakers, and the video is everything you'd want. The director didn't jump from shot to shot every second like so many other concert videos these days, leaving those of us without ADHD placated. I also adore Alanis, and her (and her bands') performance doesn't disappoint.",1419897600,,339,4.964912280701754
