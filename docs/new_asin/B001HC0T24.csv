3628831,5,B001HC0T24,"This is the second exercise DVD that I've purchased by Mirabai Holland and I really like and almost enjoy having her lead me through all the moves. Being in the healthcare profession myself I'm well aware of how important it is to stay fit, especially after one turns 50. Mirabai's credentials are fantastic and I enjoy her quiet, relaxed manner. No frantic workouts that leave you wondering if this exercise program was only meant for those in their twenties, and no mindless and ""entertaining"" chatter with program participants. Instead Mirabai leads you through the program she has designed with clear directions and explanations, with pleasant music and in a beautiful setting. The first part of the DVD explains how and why this program will work for you.",1240704000,171,760,4.9921259842519685

3628842,5,B001HC0T24,Great low impact exercise. Really love doing it. Does not feel like a daily chore. I have noticed a difference in a short period of time.,1402185600,,137,4.3076923076923075
3628843,5,B001HC0T24,Great workout for a senior. Just the right amount of challenge. I can see myself alternating between all three of her tapes on a daily basis for the rest of my life. I'm a young 65.,1398038400,2,181,4.055555555555555
3628844,5,B001HC0T24,"enjoyed her attitude and mellowness. this is a results guaranteed workout. It is my favorite. If you are out of shape like me, take the time and effort, it is worth it.",1390953600,,168,4.28125
3628845,1,B001HC0T24,"I am amazed that this DVD should be classified as suitable for someone over 50. I was careful when researching this DVD & read the many good reviews, & based my purchase solely on the many outstanding reviews & her area of expertise.  I used this DVD once in its entirety & had leg soreness & shakiness FOR two weeks.  This lady performed stretches that I used to do in dance class in high school.  You could get Carpal Tunnel Syndrome if you are not careful to hold your weights properly.  Please do not buy this DVD if you are of advanced age or approaching advanced age & are not presently in top form.  There are many more suitable DVD's out there for boomers.",1389052800,9,664,4.32258064516129
3628846,2,B001HC0T24,"I have many exercise tapes.  Some incorporate stretching with ab work; some are yoga tapes.  This tape does a very quick dash over the warm up, another dash over weights (very short and the whole reason I got the tape).  ditito the abs and the balance (which with my back injury I kind of hurt myself even attempting--my bad).  Compared to my other tapes, this woman was not precise at all as to body placement for various movements, and I think this factor is all-important in body awareness and doing the exercise correctly.  She said, ""Nice"" and ""Good"" over and over, but failed to put in some vital information.  That's what I thought, anyway.  I will be giving this away shortly to Goodwill.  Maybe it will be okay for someone, but it does not at all fill the small vacuum in my exercise tape library, and this woman just does not give me a good vibe for some reason.  She's kind of gung-ho-ish.",1387324800,8,900,4.47239263803681
3628847,4,B001HC0T24,A lttle more difficult than I expected.  Too much floor work.  Have already recommended it to a friend.  I don't have anything else to say.,1381449600,,139,4.48
3628848,5,B001HC0T24,"I received this program and forgot to write the review.
When I first began to use the video, I had difficulty getting up off of the floor by myself. After two or three weeks of doing the exercises 3 times a week, I am able to get up just as I could 20 years ago!
Thank you Mirabai :-)",1378512000,2,284,3.830508474576271
3628849,4,B001HC0T24,"this was extraordinary in that Mirabai explained everything about the exercises to be done - there are three parts available:  general info, info about the exercises to be done and then you can just opt for doing the exercises.  I worked up a slight 'glow' since I haven't exercised in a long time.",1376438400,,298,4.60377358490566
3628850,4,B001HC0T24,This workout seems like something that I can actually do. It won't be too difficult for me. I think I will enjoy it.,1372809600,,116,4.086956521739131
3628851,5,B001HC0T24,I love the  video and it makes my body feel good.  I use it every morning.  I would like a shorter one for evening.,1371945600,,115,3.7083333333333335
3628852,2,B001HC0T24,Not enough exercises to really make a difference.  Not worth the money to me.  Wanted more extensive exercises to really strength my arms and legs.,1370822400,,147,4.84
3628853,3,B001HC0T24,"This video offeres a total body workout, but one not quite as strenuous or long as I was looking for. I think it would be great for people with back, knee problems, or for beginners-but it's a little light for those looking for an at home workout on snowbound days.",1368144000,,265,4.32
3628854,5,B001HC0T24,"I like this one. She explains every move. This is a great overall workout. She's not moving at some crazy pace that you can't and don't want to keep up with. She is soothing and motivating, makes you feel like, hey, I can do that,  too. Great beginners work out,",1363737600,,262,4.24
3628855,5,B001HC0T24,"I have had a history of lower back problems for years, including having to have spinal fusion on my L4, L5 vertebrae.  I was apprehensive about trying this video, but knew I had to do something.  I am 62 years old and still have some mobility problems, including sciatica.  I would strongly recommend Moving Free to anyone who has a similar medical history.  There are no bouncing moves and no strenuous aerobics (other than moving from side to side or back to front).  This is an excellent tape to start working out with again.",1362441600,16,528,4.574468085106383
3628856,5,B001HC0T24,"I am new to strength training and this video was just what I needed to get started.  Easy to follow, lots of encouragement and suggestion to ""go at your own pace"".  I started with no weights and am already advancing after two weeks!  And the beach is pretty nice to look at whiile you are working out.",1360281600,,301,4.245614035087719
3628857,5,B001HC0T24,"I bought this video because I wanted something to exercise with that's specifically for the over-50 set like me.  I'm not much over 50 and am in reasonably good shape - have been doing pilates for several years - and wanted something new to add into my exercise routine, since every kind of exercise works the muscles differently and I need something to keep things fresh.  I am very pleased with this video!  It goes about 40 minutes from warmup to finish, divided into several sections of workout.  I find each section interesting enough that I never look at the clock and wish the workout was over.  Mirabai does a great job of easing you through it, she offers alternatives for beginners or if you have limitations, and she's very encouraging.  I'm a big believer in the ""No pain - no pain!"" theory of exercise, I see no reason to be in agony after a workout.  Her workout works your body quite thoroughly without ending up with major muscle soreness afterward.  I like her section on balance, too, since that is an issue as we grow older.  I highly recommend this video!",1359849600,6,1075,4.557291666666667
3628858,4,B001HC0T24,"Nice DVD that provides good strength training easy enough for even mature women.  DVD has a nice warm up, good explanation of exercises.  Training helpful to aid in prevention of osteoporosis.",1359590400,,192,5.161290322580645
3628859,5,B001HC0T24,I used it every other night as I lost 30 pounds and regained balance that was severely impacted through the years.,1359072000,3,114,4.476190476190476
3628860,4,B001HC0T24,It's a very good tape but I am obviously really out of shape and find it more difficult than I thought it would be. I will continue to use it and hope to be able to finish it someday. Would definitely recommend it to anyone trying to get into better shape.,1358726400,,256,4.03921568627451
3628861,5,B001HC0T24,"My wife very much appreciates and is easy-to-follow.  It is helpful, it has improved her mobility and well-worth the expense.  Nively done.",1357948800,,139,5.2727272727272725
3628862,5,B001HC0T24,This DVD was just perfect for me. I am 54 years young and had a sedentary job so I was nervous about starting anything that had the word exercise in it. It was great to not have one of those bounce around wear yourself out programs. This is slow but VERY effective movements that are helping to build my strength and helping my weight loss efforts. I trust that I won't get hurt if I listen to my body as Ms Holland reminds you. It was just what I was looking for!,1357776000,,464,4.054347826086956
3628863,4,B001HC0T24,"Am satisfied with what I have watched thus far.  I viewed the overview, but have not had time on a regular basis to go further.  I plan to do that as the holiday busyness settles down.",1354233600,,184,4.083333333333333
3628864,2,B001HC0T24,I am an active over 50 -  so thought this would be good.  But this video is for absolute beginners only.  The moves are slow - slow - slow. The instruction boring. I bought two of these videos thinking they would be good for in home exercise - but gave them both away.,1348185600,13,268,4.018867924528302
3628865,5,B001HC0T24,"I am fast approaching 65 and have never been one to exercise so when I decided I would have to do something - or else -, I looked for a DVD that would help, not cripple, me.  The primary focus of this one is to strengthen core muscle groups and balance.  I would highly recommend it for anyone who needs to gently work into exercise.",1342396800,5,333,4.107692307692307
3628866,3,B001HC0T24,"This requires you to have a chair with a sturdy back to hold on to while doing some of the exercises. Most of the them are done standing with a few lying on your back. Many of them also involve doing a ballet plie' that involves bending the knees outward to the sides with your feet together as you partially squat down a little. She seems to like that one a lot. I'm unable to do that movement because of the intense pain it causes to my knees. You will also need an exercise band (6 ft long is fine) and two sets of hand held weights (1 pound, 2 pound, 3 pound or 5 pound, depending on your preference.) Other than the knee bending, I found these exercises fairly easy to do, though I couldn't do as many of each one as she did. She is pleasant to listen to and the ocean in the background provides a nice atmosphere. For out of shape and/or older people who can stand up for 20 - 30 minutes to exercise and don't have bad knees, this is a good video. People who are used to exercising and are already fairly fit will probably find this routine way too easy.",1337644800,54,1060,4.100961538461538
3628867,5,B001HC0T24,"Having just turned 65, I was looking for something to help me maintain my strength and mobility which I know will slip away if I do not put some conscience effort into it.  This DVD is perfect.  I feel confident that her instructions and movements are safe as well as productive.  Mirabai is pleasant and easy to follow.  I especially like the rhythm, which for me makes it easier to keep going. It is not difficult to do the workout, yet I feel really good afterwards and I have already noticed an improvement in my posture.  I have purchased some ankle weights and when I am able to do the enire leg routine with the weights on, I will move on to her strength training level 2.  Thank you Mirabai.",1333065600,8,699,4.338461538461538
3628868,5,B001HC0T24,"I am 62 and did a lot of aerobics and jazzercise sorts of activities in my youth.  After a bout with breast cancer and other life events I became rather sedentary.  I was looking for something that would get me back into exercise on a regular basis.  I was particularly interested in upper body, weight bearing routines since I am small in stature and need to worry about osteoporosis.

This video is just the thing.  Mirabai Holland has just the right touch.  She is straightforward in her instructions...and adds just enough commentary to be a bit entertaining, yet not ""over the top.""  The routines move along quite quickly and I can do 15 minutes and feel like I can see benefits in that short a time period.  I am still working into the lower body exercises and I hope to continue and then work up to harder strength levels.

3628871,5,B001HC0T24,"I bought this video when I was 49 years old. Mirabai is about 8-9 years older than I am. I love her style because she takes things nice and slow and I don't pull muscles or hurt myself. I have experienced noticeable improvement in my strength since I started working out to her DVDs. I was exercising 3 times a week for a while, but now I'm doing it twice a week. I can tell I'm doing well because I can carry two gallons of milk in one hand, and I used to only be able to carry one. She does a ""whole body"" workout... including weight bearing exercises that increase bone density... something important for my age group.

If you want flash, pizazz and polished perfection, she might not be the instructor for you. She's more like a friend. She gives lots of encouragement and positive feedback.",1264377600,93,795,4.371621621621622
3628872,5,B001HC0T24,This was a wonderful exercise DVD for seniors that need exercise.  Very well done and works lots of muscles.  I didn't experience ANY muscle aches the following day.  It incorporates strength training with aerobics for a wonderful workout.,1242604800,65,239,5.2368421052631575

8308591,5,B001HC0T24,"A very smooth workout that is easy to follow yet addresses many concerns of older exercisers.
