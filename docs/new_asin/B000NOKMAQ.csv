8180318,5,B000NOKMAQ,"Very nice quality for a game from 1992.  Duke won its second title in 2 years in a great game against Michigan's Fab Five.  The game was close until about the middle of the second half when Duke pulled away to win by 20.  It did not have the drama of the East Region final win against Kentucky, but it was an interesting contrast in styles with Michigan's five freshmen facing Duke's tournament tested team.",1427414400,,407,4.4
8180319,2,B000NOKMAQ,"I thought this was a more in-depth showing of the meet. But, it was exactly what was shown on CBS. So, if you happen to be buying this in hopes of seeing yourself or someone you know, forget it. That is unless, you know FOR SURE, you were on the original showing of the meet.",1203638400,,275,4.0181818181818185
