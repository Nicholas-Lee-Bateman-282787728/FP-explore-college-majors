950523,2,6304983808,"SEASON OF THE WITCH (aka JACK'S WIFE aka HUNGRY WIVES) is a story of a bored housewife who finds fascination in the occult. All the while, she has been suffering from strange nightmares that would ultimately result in tragedy.
SEASON OF THE WITCH is a rather interesting, yet inconsistent film by George Romero. While the idea of a bored housewife exploring the unknown is a quite novel one, the rest of the film is hampered by a low budget, amateurish acting, slow pacing, & very little shocks. I think Romero is trying to be personal in this film, but fails in some areas. His most personal film is MARTIN, but that's another review. Slow, ponderous, & sometimes comical, SEASON OF THE WITCH is an odd film in the George ROmero filmography. Even die-hard Romero fans would have trouble liking this film.",1073865600,4,805,4.716312056737588
950524,1,6304983808,"I didn't know horror was a bunch of people talking for 90 minutes.  Because this is exactly what this movie is.  If you think that this movie will be a terrifying gore-fest like Romero's other movies, YOU'RE WRONG!!!  What you get is a movie with all dialog and a few stupid, no scary ""dream scenes"".  The only thing I liked about this movie is when they showed downtown Pittsburgh for about 5 seconds.  The best part of this movie is when the screen reads ""THE END"" !  Save yourself some time and money and DONT SEE THIS MOVIE!",1049500800,5,528,4.336734693877551
950525,5,6304983808,"Well I think George Romero is a genius (If you don't think so thats good for you). This was romeros 3rd movie,and it seemed to have the same fate as the movie romero made before it and after it. reason #1: Georges' second movie shot in 1969 was first titled ""Theres Always Vanilla"", it was then re-released as  ""The Affair"", and then once more re-named ""At play with the Angels"", then, it unfortunatly fell off the face of the earth without a trace. Then in 1972 Romero shot ""Jacks wife"" the movie bombed at the box office (mainly because people didn't get it or didn't want to try) The production house that financed the film (unknown to Romero)actually usually financed x-rated films. So the film was re-released under its new name ""Hungry Wives"" and was trying to be sold as ""soft porn"", poor George was so wizzed (and embarassed) that he called it a loss. The film remained forgotten until 1979 right after ""Dawn of the Dead"" was released. The new distribution company who bought the rights to it cut about a half hour out of it and re-released it as ""Season of the  Witch"". Hoping that the movie would ride on the coatails of ""Dawn"". Then Romeros' next film ""The Crazies"" was originally released as ""Code Name:Trixie"" in 1973.
As for ""Season of the Witch"", its really a great movie. Its just that most people just don't want to have to try to figure things out, if the entire plot, all of the questions and answers in it aren't presented to people right under their noses, they ""don't understand it"" or ""get bored"" with it because they have the attention span of 3rd graders. The plot is very original, the acting isn't bad it reflects the charaters emotional states (Romeros' charecters never act mellow dramatic just very natural)Once again probably the most overlooked stong points of the movie is romeros cinematography and editing, romero has honed a style of camera work and editing that is very prominent in all of his work, its genius but unappreciated. And for all those who whine about the movies ""low budget"". Ok, the movie was shot in 1972 on 16mm film, yes thats right 16mm film. ""NOTLD"" was shot on 35mm B&W, ""Season of the Witch"" was shot on 16mm color, So WHat?? I personally like seeing movies that were shot on 16mm. Just because a film wasn't shot on ""state of the art"" equipment does that make it a bad movie?? I would of liked it even if it was shot on super 8!",993081600,25,2387,4.523148148148148
950526,4,6304983808,"George A. Romero's film,although filled with wooden acting, possesses some pretty interesting ideas. Romero's always been the master, in my book, of sneaking in a pretty neat little sub-text. In the zombie films, i suppose it had something to do with anxiety of the respective time periods in which  each film was made and in this film it's obviously Feminism. The film doesn't come off as too exploitative (although it was originally marketed as an adult film) and the bored suburban housewife schtick is milked with some pretty warped and even hilarious results. Although it's not always in the foreground, there is a fascinating little commentary on medical experiments and the shift in medical research in the sixties ( I'm thinking of the scene where that near-senior citizen gets "" turned on"" to pot) Pretty clever stuff.",990403200,4,827,5.036496350364963
950527,1,6304983808,"The only reason I bought Season of the Witch is because of the name George A. Romero. He is one of my all time favorite horror directors and I have seen almost all of his films. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is my favorite horror movie. Sadly Season of the Witch is not his greatest effort and is frankly one of my least favorite films. The story movies very slowly and the subject matter is unappealing. The characters are one dimensional (unlike Romero's other features) and are unsympathetic. I can't find, no matter how hard I try, to find one aspect of this film I like. If your a Romero fan, like me, don't expect a whole lot out of this cheap effort, it doesn't even begin to tread the same grounds as Romero's other films. I also was disapppointed in the picture quality. Usually Anchor Bay horror films are crystal clear and amazing. Season of the Witch, even though the box says Digitally Remastered, still has a muddy look. Also the box says the title Season of the Witch but he film itself says Jack's Wife. Is it really that big of a problem to put the actual name of the movie one the box? When I first started watching it I though I got jipped and given the wrong movie, until I learned that Jack's Wife is an alternate title for Season of the Witch.",989884800,5,1261,4.324894514767933
950528,5,6304983808,"Alright, so the acting is often amateurish and it isn't approved by Wiccans and the lot. They can go play with their chalices and swords -- it's a brilliant little movie. Romero looks at sexual frustration, the sexual revolution (California-style), and the relationship of these things to what would become known as ""New Age spirituality"" with a critical, curious, searching eye, making his most reflective and unusual film. Donovan's song is nicely used, and there are some almost Cassavetes-like moments where the characters push each other into revealing deep-seated frustrations and fears... Also some interesting considerations of the relationship between religious beliefs and sexual needs which, really, just aren't TREATED that often in cinema. The film seems to seriously want to explore everything that Romero thinks might be healthy about witchcraft, without being afraid to also criticize it, as well. I'd almost be willing to call it a feminist film, in that Romero earnestly tries to frame 70's west-coasty let's-pretend/ let's-get-nekkid occultism in the context of VERY REAL female struggles at the time. His cynicism ultimately wins out, however; though the movie remains ultimately a little ambiguous, the last scene seems pretty mocking, to my eyes... In any event -- it is worth watching and thinking about. And yes, Satanism and Wicca are different things, and YES, Romero takes some liberties with his depiction of ""The Craft,"" but Cripes, guys, what, do you just watch THE WICKER MAN over and over and over and over and over and over and over? Lighten up! (And please don't put any curses on me).",972086400,67,1619,5.206896551724138
950529,3,6304983808,"Season of the Witch is one of George A. Romero's films that you would find ironic. Overall the film is pretty good, but some parts are kind of dull.",950572800,2,148,4.137931034482759
950530,5,6304983808,"I love Romero films, and I've been a fan of ""Season of the Witch"" for years. I already had this on VHS but decided to buy the DVD recently...and I wish I had long before now! This is just wonderful. There are at least an additional 15 minutes added on to this film which adds much more depth to the characters.

This is a double sided disk with lots of extras. In addition to the two films, there is a brief interview with Romero about his ""lost films"" (this and ""There's Always Vanilla.""), an hour long feature about the films of Romero...and I was MOST delighted to see an interview with the lovely Jan White (Joan)! I have always wondered what ever happened to this actress, and it was great to see her! Not to mention the trivia about the film itself.

The film quality was not superb, but then I don't think it ever was. Those complaining about this should keep that in mind.

You won't find the commentary version of the movies as I've seen in other Anchor Bay Romero DVDs (""Martin,"" ""The Crazies,"" and ""Knightriders"" for example) but the great extra features more than make up for this fact.

I don't have much to say about ""There's Always Vanilla""... it wasn't too bad, but as in the case of several Romero films, was very interesting from the standpoint of seeing images of Pittsburgh from 30+ years ago. As someone who grew up in that area, it was kind of fun.

As far as ""Season of the Witch""...you either love it or you don't. If you do, and you haven't gotten the DVD yet buy it now!",942969600,6,1496,4.347670250896058
950531,1,6304983808,"This movie was boring, badly produced, the audio was terrible, the acting was amaturish, and the story line was simply ridiculous.  It should have been titled; ""The Season of the Sexually Frustrated, Bored, 70's  Housewife"".  Any ""witchcraft"" in the movie was limited to  about 10 minutes total-- and was so off the mark, it was ludicrous.  Summoning ""the Devil"" to do a Love spell... Puh-leeez.

950532,4,6304983808,"This one goes way back to when he used to direct, write, shoot, and edit the films.  It certainly has its flaws and drags in places, but this is from the time when he was making some of the most original, entertaining  movies around.  It's fairly certain you'll never see another film quite  like this -- although his own MARTIN has much of the same feel.  Rather  introspective.  Be warned, the budget constraints can be felt when  viewing this film.  On the other hand, Romero consistently proved during  this period that large budgets do not make the movie.  Oh yeah... it has a  very effective climax, as well.  SEASON doesn't have the same visceral  shocks of MARTIN, but I'd say go watch the latter film first.  If you like  it, chances are good you'll really enjoy this one as well.",914889600,7,789,4.5285714285714285
950654,5,6304983808,I can't figure out why this movie got so few stars? I really liked it. Had a huge 60s/70s vibe and kind of quirky characters and got deep into the witch thing.

There really is no reason to watch this, other than as white noise. There is no horror, and the witch part doesn't start until an hour into the movie, and then it's Hollywood's usual lame depiction of witchcraft.

950729,4,6304983808,"Not traditional horror, but definitely Romero horror (albeit a bit dated it is still a snapshot of the times). It's not as in your face as Night of the Living Dead, more subtle and carrying a variation of the themes of class, race, and consumerism. This strikes me as being more about the levels of collateral damage of the ""machine"". The father/husbands pursuit of success alienates his wife, which starts the second cycle of damage. The success also alienates the daughter, plenty of material things, but lack of cohesive family structure and another cycle of damage begins.

SEASON OF THE WITCH is about a bored, disillusioned housewife who dabbles in witchcraft. It's also a study of the cataclysmic societal changes in the late 1960s and early 70s. It was a time when the ignorant and puritanical structure of the 1950s was collapsing under the weight of social experimentation and freedom. Jan White's character is willing to accept new -actually very old- ideas and a liberating lifestyle that will drive her stolid, emotionally-absent husband nuts. That is, if he even notices! WITCH explores the sexual revolution, female awakening, and several other topics along the way. Witchcraft is a wonderful metaphor for female power, terrifying  to many who would much rather keep it buried. Too late! The spell is cast...",1391385600,3,859,4.924137931034482

I won't give away the plotline but I will say that in the first fifteen minutes of the movie I thought it was going to be a weird, eerie, creepy and fun ride. The movie starts off very surreal and atmospheric seeming to give ""Rosemary's Baby"" a run for it's money. But just as you're beginning to think, ""this movie's awesome"" it very quickly lapses into a very conventional, melodramatic and not very scary storyline about a typical suburban housewife bored with her humdrum life who decides to spice things up by dabbling in witchcraft. For the remainder of the film you are waiting for it to return to the creepiness it began with and it never does. You end up being very annoyed by the lead actress Jan White and her dull, whiny persona and the stupid recurring dream she has about an intruder with a dumb looking wolfman (I think) mask on breaking into her house and molesting her.

I give the film two stars instead of just one because it was good in the beginning. But if you're looking for an innovative, scary and memorable horror film that lives up to George Romero's name, you won't find it here. A big disappointment.",1390348800,,1397,4.5436507936507935

She has an affair with a younger man who, unfortunately, wears a hat that makes him look like Chuck Barris which was the end of taking him at all seriously (for me). She eventually wanders into becoming a full time witch but her life seems just as pointless as before.  The soundtrack is a misery, the copy of the film I saw was very poor visually, the acting was fair but limited in range, and you know when you are in trouble when the best part is noticing terrible fashions and hairdos (for reasons I'm not quite clear on, the housewife's hair gets taller and taller as the film progresses--is that a witch thing?).  George Romero has made some genuinely thoughtful and scary films. I wouldn't personally count this one among them.

P: A bored housewife takes up with the local neighborhood witch, but fears she may have overstepped her bounds by using spells for reckless purposes.

As commentary on the feminist movement, Season of the Witch works. As a character piece, Season of the Witch also works on that regard, because the film really gets to the heart of the main character- who she is, what she is all about. However, as entertainment, Season of the Witch isn't so successful. Sure, the film does have interesting moments where characters debate over certain ideas & notions. Some of the dream & hallucinogenic sequences are effective, but, overall, the pacing is so slow and so leisurely, that it often feels like the movie is heading nowhere, ten miles per hour at that.

What a shame that is too! Season of the Witch obviously had something to say. It just never finds that balance between being actual entertainment, art and commentary. It has a habit of rambling on and on and on and, in the process, it loses its impact. [R] 89 mins.

Joan (Jan White) reaching 40 gets this itch to stray. She expresses her itch to a witch; will she get the pitch and become a witch bitch. Lets hope there is a lot of running around in birthday suits under the serious moon light. Or will she just look like Ash Wednesday gone astray.

Director George A. Romero you know by Night of the Living Dead (1968) and other related films, seems to want to be the first Blare Witch. I think he succeeded, do you?

This film AKA Hungry Wives or Jacks Wife was remasterd but Anchor Bay could not find the originals so they apologize before the film starts.

950893,5,6304983808,"I found this to be a terrific, positive type of film about a housewife whose husband is both abusive and cares not for her. She discovers Witchcraft and that she has 'talents' with which she uses to plot revenge and to liberate herself.

McWiccans hate films like this because the Witch does not fit their own stereotype of ""hippie/pagan, nature-worshiping, patchouli-wearing oddballs"". Plus there's no mention of any rule of three nor karma so the Witch is left to herself as to how to proceed in dealing with life.

To me, the Witch is empowered and realizes she does not have to take anyone else's crap any longer which is what self-empowerment is all about. So she does a little bad JuJu and has no patron goddess, still the Witch is fun to watch how she resolves conflict with spellwork.

The ending is grand and a surprise to me. Without letting the cat out of the proverbial bag, you discover she wins in this film. Unlike other movies where Witches are portrayed as violent and homicidal maniacs, this one is rational, a thinker & patient which helps her to win.

I rank this film 5 of 5 stars for its entertainment value and positive message to women that you don't have to bullied if you choose not to be.",1382140800,12,1215,4.534246575342466
950963,2,6304983808,"A neglected housewife decides to fill the void in her empty marriage with magic and witchcraft, which leads her down a dark and terrifying road in George A. Romero's third feature, SEASON OF THE WITCH. While Horror fans may find the suspense to be severely lacking, it is important to remember that the film was never intended to be included in the genre until its clever producers decided to bank on NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD's success. Instead, SEASON OF THE WITCH serves as a critical look at marriage and its part in the Women's Liberation Movement of the 1960s and 70s. Romero does little to progress the movement, however, and if anything, he sets it back another decade with this tawdry tale. His failed attempts at the avant-garde give SEASON OF THE WITCH the appearance of a cheap student film, and the stale performances do nothing to help. The camera hangs on dry, meaningless scenes well past their worth. It is only interesting to see just how far Joan is willing to go in order to find some satisfaction in life, but this still leaves for little payoff in the end. There is no real value in SEASON OF THE WITCH outside of the completist's collection.

950965,5,6304983808,"Writer/Director/Editor George A. Romero's 1972 'lost' horror movie ""Season of the Witch"", is a great movie, about a woman (Jan White), who lives in a ordinary, surburban street with her husband Jack. During a party she, and her friend, meet a couple who like to smoke dope and indulge in sexual experimentation.

While she gets bored, she dabbles in witchcraft and, as a result, leaves her 'old life' behind and gets more and more involved in being a witch.

With feminism and women's rights happening in the 1970's, Romero (and his wife Nancy), who produced the movie, succeed in having a film that celebrates wicca and other occult activities, and making a statement about how oppressed women should do other things apart from sitting in their houses bored to death with the day-to-day living....
****

""Season of the Witch"", (filmed as ""Jack's Wife"" and ""Hungry Wives""), offers the viewer a visual treat as dreams (real and/or imagined), and the sense of dread surfaces, as Jack mistreats his wife in several scenes, and ignoring his wife's needs in the process....

""Season of the Witch"" also features the sensational title song by Donovan....

The acting is excellent.

With striking visuals, and lots of scares, it is a low budget masterpiece of terror from a master filmmaker.

Romero has stated that he likes to re-make the movie with a bigger budget.

Time will tell if he does.

I rate the movie 5 stars.

Highly recommended for fans of early George A. Romero's work.",1284163200,3,1477,4.872

950967,5,6304983808,"George Romero is know to many as the father of the dead trilogy, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, and Day of the Dead.  Season of the Witch is not a gore movie but a charmingly dated period piece detailing  a 1970's housewife's frustrations as she becomes less involved in her families lives, (her only child is ready to leave for college and her husband is much less concerned about his marriage as he is about his career) . The 1950's ideal family with the stay at home mom finally faded into American folklore by the early 1970's, replaced by daycare and double income households.  Witch illustrates this cultural shift poeticly through  a bored  housewife who no longer wants to be objectified as a ""general caretaker""  and wishes to change her life through ""magic"".  This story is solid and goes into some strange places.  If the movie was ever to be remade, as so many of Romero's films have, I would hope the setting would remain 1970-72, it truly is what makes this film special.  As a bonus this disc also offers There's Always Vanilla, a lost Romero film, for some, something that should not have been found, for others a unique insight  on the early work  of one of America's Greatest Directors.",1259539200,4,1217,4.587962962962963

There's Always Vanilla is a romantic drama depicting the 70's atmosphere, whereas Season of the Witch is a housewife portrait. Both of them are difficult to watch, but necessary for die hard Romero fans. The quality of the image and the sound is good on There's Always Vanilla, whereas on Season of the Witch, it's not clean at all. By the way, although the title of the movie is Season of the Witch, it seems to be the Hungry Wives cut (the French DVD release contains more witchcraft scenes and less dialogue). The bonus are interesting, the documentary is cool, and the interview of the director is out of the ordinary.
As a conclusion, this DVD is destined to Romero fans only !",1185148800,10,824,4.6506849315068495

  Forget this low-budget film which really makes no sense at all. Notable only for Jan White and Ray Laine.
________________________________
There's Always Vanilla (1971)  -Side B-
  This film stars Raymond Laine and Judith Ridley (Streiner) {Night of the Living Dead 1968}. No, this film is not The Red Balloon.
  Chris is tired of playing his music for other music groups so he decides to head for Pittsburgh, after 3 years away, to see his father.  At the PAAC rail station, he meets Gwen, a model. He helps her get the gig for a tv commercial. A romance begins.  Chris is really a good guy with good nature, patience and a sense of humor.  Gwen has started to become a flake.  Will this romance blossom or will she fizzle out?
  Spoiler: This film is probably the most realistic love story of its time, but the ending left me flat.
  The film is enjoyable due to the natural acting talents of Ray Laine.  By today's standards, he would be a cross between Lou Rossi, George Clooney and Russel Crowe.
  Ray Laine went on to become a schoolteacher.  He did do several more film appearances.  Ray Laine died in 2000 from cancer.
  Also in the cast: Russel Streiner (Night of the Living Dead 1968), Joe Rosso and Richard Ricci.

This movie, though slow to get to the topic, is based on traditional witchcraft (NOT WICCA) but witchcraft as presented in Paul Huson's 70's Book, Mastering Witchcraft.

Like me, you have low expections and are thrilled to find low budget or forgotten gems. As one B-movie fan to another, don't bother with this one.

The first 15 minutes are actually promising, but it goes downhill after that until it hits rock bottom with a 'meh' ending.  Basically this is a movie about a pill-popping, shrink-dependent housewife having a midlife crisis, with a stereotypical daughter (that's an ingrate) and a stereotypical overworked husband in supporting roles. (The 'abusive' husband isn't really the monster other reviewers make him out to be and that one scene isn't indicative that this was an ongoing thing.)

The whiny, self-centered housewife decides to spice up her oh-so-dreary uppermiddleclass life by dabbling in witchcraft (how terrible it must be to have the freedom to do whatever you want in the daytime and also have money to do it).

I cannot recommend this movie.

This one really fit my lock, I thought it was terrific.  It's amazing the disparity of opinion on this one --- Scott Adams, in his book 'Win Bigly', gives a possible explanation:

""The most common opinion that we humans have of ourselves is that we are rational creatures---let's say 90 percent of the time, anyway. But every now and then we get a little emotional and temporarily lose our sense of reason. That's how most people see the world. I did too until I trained to become a hypnotist.

""Hypnotists see the world differently. From our perspective, people are irrational 90 percent of the time but don't know it. We can be rational in trivial situations---such as deciding what time to leave the house to drive to work. But we are almost never rational when it comes to matters of love, family, pets, politics, ego, entertainment, and almost anything else that matters to us emotionally. When our feelings turn on, our sense of reason shuts off. The freaky part is that we don't recognize when it is happening to us. We think we are reasonable and rational most of the time.  But what hypnotists have long known, and scientists have in recent years confirmed, is that our decisions are often made without appeal to the rational parts of our brains. We literally make our decisions first and then create elaborate rationalizations for them after the fact.""",1520812800,2,1515,4.8301158301158305

The execution fails the promise of the horror premise as sold, but I think the main point of the movie is that desperate people will turn to religion to regain a sense of power over their lives, and in this, the movie succeeds. And it also succeeds as an essay on feminism: Director Romero clearly empathized with the plight of women who had sacrificed their lives, careers, and youth for brute husbands, who had found themselves powerless and without value once the kids were grown and who are losing youthful beauty in middle age. The direction is erratic, glacially slow, then fast-paced, with jerky camera movements. The interior sets are a feast of lurid colors and '70s tack factor. Costumes and furniture are amazingly loud with bold prints and were acquired from the now-extinct Gimbels department store.  Overall, film is both schlocky and good.
