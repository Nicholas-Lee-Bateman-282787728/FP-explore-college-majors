8164852,1,B000LXGV0Y,"I was looking for pure devotional service to Krishna, but this film only shows conditional service with God as an order supplier.  Krishna has to fulfill all the material wishes of his devotee to ""fix"" his life.  This is hardly the essence of pure bhakti.

It's rare to find such great souls who understand these things.  They weren't writing and directing this movie.",1182816000,2,522,4.559139784946237
