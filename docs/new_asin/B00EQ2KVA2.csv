5934109,5,B00EQ2KVA2,Great Product.,1426118400,,14,6.5
5934110,5,B00EQ2KVA2,"If you want ZANY comedies concerning crime fighting, THIS IS THE ONE!!!! - Seeing Sly Stallone as a mafia man in OSCAR? - HILARIOUS!!!! - All the others: DISORGANIZED CRIME, ANOTHER STAKEOUT, FATHER HOOD, MAFIA!, TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS, THE CREW, and especially BIG TROUBLE, ARE FABULOUS!!! - I guarantee you, BUY THIS WONDERFUL 8-PACK!!! - You will be laughing for weeks!!!",1413590400,4,375,5.064516129032258
5934111,4,B00EQ2KVA2,"I bought this mainly for Mafia! which came from Jim Abraham who gave us such great comedies as Ghost, Airplane & The Naked Gun. I was not disappointed with this movie, sadly Father Hood doesn't fit with the other movies in this package; it was okay to watch once and The Crew was described as ""side-splitting"", it was anything but. Big Trouble was stupid, but sort of funny along with Taking Care of Business. Oscar, once you get past the opening (I use the fast forward) was great, especially the last 1/3rd. Another Stakeout started out as a action-packed movie until Rosie O'Donnell came onto the scene & the movie went South very fast. Man, that girl can not act & if it wasn't for her co-star, a dog, she would have been a total flop. Disorganized Crime was also very good except for the ending which showed that crime does pay.  Because of Another Stakeout, Father Hood & The Crew, I only gave this four-stars. Mafia! & Oscar, both Mob shows, each rate 5 or more stars in my book.  +JMJ+",1390521600,22,993,4.450549450549451
5934112,4,B00EQ2KVA2,some of the movies were not in the order the dvd menu suggested - you have to select movie a to watch movie b and vice versa but as far as i know it's all there - i watched two films with my external dvd drive through my laptop to my HDTV (dvd's are not in HD) without any playback issues that i recall,1463961600,,302,3.734375
