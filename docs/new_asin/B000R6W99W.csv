8199333,5,B000R6W99W,"You are not going to learn how to ""Kill or Be Killed""... but you will safely and easily learn techniques which I personally have used to escape bad situations/issues.  I am old now, and can't, (and won't), go ""toe to toe"" with a younger stronger attacker.  All the work that Michael Janich has put forth in the last 15 years has been good sound practical advice and teaching for a real world platform that will hopefully keep you from saving yourself without having to do time for a crime that you really were not ready to commit.  Even though Illinois has just been approved for CCW, people are NOT going to be allowed to go running around shooting every bad guy they see.  Sometimes a knife is a better and more valuable alternative to a couple of stray bullets thrown in the bad guy's general direction. I would recommend the complete ""Martial Blade Concepts"" first, but you may as well buy ""Counter Blade Concepts"" right now, because trust me on this, you will eventually.",1377648000,,976,4.591954022988506
8199334,5,B000R6W99W,"As someone who also teaches the knife and sword arts (Tanto-Jutsu and Wakizashi-Jutsu-Bushi Satori Ryu), I have enormous respect for Michael Janich.  His research into knife tactics is nothing short of fantastic.  His system is simple and effective.  In fact, I have also simplified my Combatives Knife System because of his influence and ideas. This great DVD summarizes Mr. Janich's Martial Blade Concepts System.  The video begins with an explanation of the practical use of the knife in self-defense and emphasizes that you must be justified legally before introducing a knife into a self-defense situation.  He continues by reviewing his MBC philosophy and gos on to explain the potential of the knife, knife stopping power and the four basic angles of attack.  One of the things I like about his system is how he broke down the old 12 to 16 knife angles to just a 5 angle system. (Note: My Combatives program teachs a four angle method).  I especially agree with his view that whenever possible attempt to move outside of the attacker's arm for the best advantage in combat.

This DVD has so much information that this short review cannot do it justice.  If you are into knife combat, you will want a copy of this DVD.

 Rating: 5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Knife Handling & Knife Defense for Police Officers official course manual).",1251244800,7,1348,4.889867841409692
8199335,4,B000R6W99W,"Michael Janich's books and videos are some of my favorites for edged weapon work.  This one is no exception.

This video is an introduction to Michael Janichs edge weapons martial art called Martial Blade Concepts.  He explains some of his background in Philipino martial arts that focused on the blade, and how he adapted those to more modern, and practical concepts.

He goes through the basics of his program, and gives you some of his training drills.  He then goes through attacks, defenses and various patterns he teaches.  He also covers some of the legal aspects of using a knife for personal defense, something most knife arts do not teach.

His drills are some of the better ""live"" drills I've seen for weapons work.  The only thing he doesn't do, is pad up and spar with training knives to show his system in action.  However, others have done so and most of his system works well under pressure.

I highly recommend pretty much everything he offers.",1226880000,4,961,4.734939759036145
