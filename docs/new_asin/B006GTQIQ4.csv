4987659,1,B006GTQIQ4,Very disappointed on the content of the DVD.  It did not even cover the most basic patterns of the dance.,1367712000,,105,4.25
4987660,3,B006GTQIQ4,Had a hard time hearing the instruction because of the music. They need to redo that video. Other than that it is OK.,1365292800,,117,4.130434782608695
4987661,5,B006GTQIQ4,"Shawn and Joanna do an excellent job of covering all the basics of the Nightclub 2 Step in their 101 Dvd.  We bought it just after completing a local, 6 week beginners NC2S class.  The Trautmans covered everything we learned in our 6 week class plus a lot of additional tips and drill suggestions.  Their Dvd only cost us the equivalent of one night of private instruction and we now have it to refer to as often as we like.  Either the private class or the Trautman's Dvd alone would have been sufficient for learning the basic NC2S, but in combination they were fantastic.  We have since ordered more of their 101 Dvd's (Cha Cha and Salsa) and are confident that the Dvd's alone will be all we need to get us started with a new step.  (Plus, we will not have to wait until our local instructor offers the particular dance step class we want next.)

Shawn's lead on instruction is very clear and obviously well practiced from teaching experience.  Joanna offers many helpful comments that pertain to what the ladies need to be aware of while executing their partner's leads.  Together, they make a great instructive team.  The Dvd is well organized and permits easy revisiting of the sections you wish to focus on, and I really appreciated that they give you a quick preview of what you will be learning as an introduction to the Dvd, rather than immediately jumping into the mechanics of the steps.  They also did a good job of helping me to understand the rhythm/beat of those tunes where you would use the NC2S.  Excellent video and audio quality.  My wife and I can easily recommend this Dvd to anyone wanting to learn the NC2S.  Well done Shawn and Joanna, and thanks for helping us get started on a wonderful activity together as we begin our retirements.",1326240000,3,1762,4.570063694267516
4987662,5,B006GTQIQ4,"Nightclub Two-Step dance is a great alternative to the slow dance ""belly rub"". Shawn Trautman teaches the leader's part; his wife Joanna teaches the follower's part. Shawn and Joanna teach the steps in an amazingly simplistic way...very easy to follow.  You can practice this DVD today and be out dancing the Nighclub Two-Step tonight!  Such a beautiful slow dance!  Now, thanks for Shawn Trautman DVD, Nighclub Two-Step is one of my favorite dances!",1325721600,5,450,5.136986301369863
8497768,5,B006GTQIQ4,"Wow!  My partner and I were blown away with how quickly we learned.  The very next time we went to our studio's dance party and a Night Club 2-step was announced, away we went enjoying every moment as we did the foot crossing in sync, UNTIL our instructor came over and said not to do it that way, just do the rock step.  We were and are completely baffled.  We suspect that because we hadn't been taught this dance ( in 10 months of weekly private instruction and weekly group lessons), the studio didn't like our doing a step they hadn't taught us.  We wanted to move along so I had bought the cd.  Some how we got into trouble although we saw other couples dancing the step as we had learned it on Shawn's cd.  We have noticed that the studio doesn't listen to what we want.  Why do we continue to go, well, we have improved greatly in the past year (almost) and we have made friends with other couples.  But, thanks Shawn sand Joanna.  We have bought 11 of Shawn's cd's thus far and like them all",1470355200,,1000,4.21578947368421
8497769,4,B006GTQIQ4,Easy to follow instructions.  I bought another of his films to learn more about the two step.  I have not danced since I was a kid.  My wife wants to dance on the Ocean Cruise ships.,1436745600,,182,4.0
8497770,5,B006GTQIQ4,"I came across Shawn Trautman's instructional CD's a few months ago, I can only repeat what all the positive reviewer have said. The teaching is just first rate, at the right pace and such great value. I don't even bother looking for video's from another source anymore, there's no comparison.",1422835200,,292,4.86
8497771,5,B006GTQIQ4,the product is what I expected,1416787200,,30,4.166666666666667
8497772,5,B006GTQIQ4,Very good.,1408406400,,10,4.5
8497773,5,B006GTQIQ4,We had been debating what dance to learn next and heard good things about the Nightclub 2 so we gave it a shot.  Super impressed with Shawns teaching style as always (this is not our first DVD by him).  He and his wife really break it all down in this video including the beat/rythm part which I always am a huge fan of.  It also has greta quality and perfect music for the dance.  Great for beginners and we highly recommend it.,1398902400,2,429,4.195121951219512
8497774,5,B006GTQIQ4,"After promising my girlfriend for years that I would take dance lessons with her, I struggled with the one hour local sessions when we finally started. One to two hours a week for six week sessions was not enough for me to make much progress, and I felt bad about that. We tried to practice mid-week on our own, but I had trouble remembering the lessons, and we also had very little appropriate practice music at home. An internet search for help brought me straight to Shawn and Joanna Trautman's DVD dance instruction series, and I studied the reviews before ordering this video. My local dance teacher is a sweetheart, but she just was not explaining the movement of my size twelve feet in a manner that made sense to me. Shawn explains it clearly, and I finally ""got it""! Once my feet were going the right direction, the turns and ""tricks"" made me a beginner dancer, instead of someone who was always out of place on the dance floor. This video is 56 minutes long, and you can dance in public with what you learn here. Yes, there are more moves out there than are shown in this first series DVD, but you WILL BE A DANCER if you just learn what is here, and don't worry about the other moves for now. The music is loud enough even during the instruction period that we will just practice dance on our own some times, without listening to the instructions. The DVD also fills a need that we had for the right kind of dance music. Nightclub two-step is generally considered to be the easiest partner dancing of all of the types. If you have no formal lessons available in your area, then go ahead and start with this video, to see if the dancing thing is for you! A friend's recent birthday party had a 1950's sock-hop theme with 150 people in costume and a live band, and with our basic, but concise nightclub two-step moves, we were the stars of the event, thanks in part to this video. If you have ever considered learning ballroom dancing, buy this DVD, and you will not be disappointed!",1387497600,4,1992,4.430517711171662
8497775,1,B006GTQIQ4,It's just 30 minutes DVD that learns three simple moves! I expert more moves and also longer dvd. I believe there are more useful free videos on youtube!,1384905600,,153,4.5
8497776,4,B006GTQIQ4,Gave me emphasis on the basics and a few moves that we can master easily.  Polishes what we learned in dance class,1380672000,,114,4.181818181818182
8497777,3,B006GTQIQ4,"Very good instructors, really taught the basics well.  I was really disappointed in the number of different steps (patterns) included in the video - a total of 3 ! ! !  10 - 15 would have been more appropriate for a beginner DVD.

I didn't have any trouble hearing them over the music.",1378512000,,285,4.339622641509434
