8475242,3,1559190639,"This video reminds me of the typical foreign language audiocassette tapes that one purchases.  The video does cover the alphabet very quickly (the video is only 60 minutes).  It then covers common words and phrases by showing the english word/phrase, its phonetic spelling, the arabic script and a picture of whatever the word/phrase is (this last thing is the only difference between this video course and an audiocassette course).  It did not cover any grammar.  It certainly wasn't a bad tool to learn from but I could have done without the pictures and just bought a audiocassette tape that is significantly cheaper (it really wasn't worth the cost of $75) and that has basically the same material.  Perhaps had it had some catchy songs or visual aids or something it might have been worth it, but it was literally as I described as above.",1067126400,7,843,4.826388888888889
