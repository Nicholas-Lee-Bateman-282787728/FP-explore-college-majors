514060,5,6302800854,"There are few words that can accurately describe the magnificent performance of Larry Parks in ""THE JOLSON STORY"".  With Larry's performance, Morris Stoloff's Orchestra, and the great Al Jolson's voice, this movie is easily hands down, the best musical biography ever made.  Along with it's sequel, ""JOLSON SINGS AGAIN"", it stands in a class of it's own.  Sure reviewers of today have deemed it a little hoaky, but that is how wartime Hollywood movies were.  In addition, although the movie is obviously fictionalized, the facts of Jolson's accomplishments are TRUE, and cannot and should not be denied with regard to their historical importance as it relates to the evolution of American Entertainment and the great American Songbook.  Jolson was the KIng of Showbusiness for more than four decades, and his accomplishments are legendary.  For those who have not yet seen this movie, take note of some of Al Jolson's achievements: 1st million selling record; 1st million selling album; 1st to take a Braodway show on the road; 1st to go overseas and entertain the troops in the USO; and the list goes on and on.  Do yourself a favor...watch this movie...see history...discover America's Greatest Entertainer.",1010361600,34,1209,5.1692307692307695
514061,5,6302800854,"There are some movies you must have. This is one of them. It speaks to a time in America when the future was bright and shiny and the music was fun and happy.
We have so little of Jolson on film, but this movie and the followup make up for all of that. Jolson's voice was even better as he got older and the songs in this movie will make a fan out of anyone.
Treat yourself to an evening with the greatest singer who ever lived.",1003536000,4,428,3.9310344827586206
514062,5,6302800854,"THE JOLSON STORY is one of the greatest musicals of all time! Jolson's story (based on fact, but fictionalized), his actual singing and Larry Parks' acting and lip-synching are beyond compare!
I think it's a shame that every junky new movie is put on DVD and we have to wait for a classic like this to come out.
THAT'S WHAT I HAD WRITTEN, BUT ALAS, IT'S ON DVD EFFECTIVE 10/21/03!
Sound is good and picture is good, but not excellent.  There are dirt flicks during the movie, especially when Young Al is in the audience singing to his future manager (William Demarest).  Houw could this have been digitally mastered?  Also, there is NO TRAILER and NO EXTRAS!  The cover looks awful!  But ... it's on DVD!",981331200,2,704,4.555555555555555
514063,5,6302800854,"The young Asa Yoelson (Scotty Beckett) runs away from home to join Steve Martin (William Demarest) in vaudeville against the wishes of his parents. They find him and realising how much he wants to get into show business they reluctantly agree for him to join Martin on tour. As he grows up he changes his name to Al Jolson (now played by Larry Parks) and becomes a big Broadway star. He meets Julie Benson (Evelyn Keyes) and they get married. However, all that Jolson really cares about is to get in front of an audience and sing so his marriage suffers because of it. He stars in one successful Broadway show after another and then is invited to go to Hollywood to take the lead in the first ever talking picture ""The Jazz Singer"". In later years his popularity declines and he finds it harder to get work. He does in fact make a sensational comeback and is in even bigger demand than ever which was portrayed in the sequel ""Jolson Sings Again"".
When I first saw ""The Jolson Story"" I had never heard of its star Larry Parks although I had bought a few Jolson records prior to seeing the film. Parks gave a magnificent portrayal but apart from appearing in ""Jolson Sings Again"" three years later he made very few films after that due to the McCarthy communist ""witch hunt"" which was a shame.
Some favourite lines from the film:
William Demarest: ""Give that boy a spotlight!"".
Tamara Shayne (to Ludwig Donath): ""Papa, Asa isn't Asa any more!"".
Larry Parks (to orchestra leader): ""Oscar, what are you doing with that phone - this is no time to call up women!"".
Parks (to audience in theatre): ""Settle back folks - you ain't heard nothin' yet!"".
Parks (to audience in theatre): ""I'm going into what they call talking pictures - don't know what's going to happen to me - but er, if I come back you'll let me - won't you?"".
""The Jolson Story"" is one of those rare movies that you can enjoy over and over again and has a high place in my Top Ten films of all time. Wonderful acting, superb colour, fascinating story (even though not entirely accurate), and how about those memorable old songs - ""California Here I Come"", ""April Showers"", ""Swanee"", ""Rockabye Your Baby"", ""Robert E. Lee"", ""Mammy"", ""You Made Me Love You"", ""I'm Sitting On Top of the World"", ""About a Quarter to Nine"", etc. This film is worth seeing just to hear the real Al Jolson belting out the songs that made him famous. Jolson was often billed as ""the world's greatest entertainer"" and I'm sure that was a title well deserved.  Clive Roberts.",978048000,67,2505,4.542035398230088

514067,5,6302800854,"This is the type of movie that you hate to see end.  The story, albeit mostly made up of jumbled facts from Jolson's life, takes you on a magical ride and gives you a true taste of what the entertainer must have been  like.  Larry Park's performance, which earned him an academy award  nomination, is incredible.  His lip-syncing to the songs of Jolson is  beyond compare.  The closeups of his face while ""Rockabye-ing"" or  ""Mammy-ing"" show the preciseness with which he took on the role.  The movie also was nominated for best picture of 1946.  I can't wait to see  this (and it's sequel, Jolson Sings Again) on the DVD format.  Don't miss  this classic musical... a real treat!",913507200,10,679,4.605042016806722

I was glad that Jolson's actual singing voice was dubbed in for Larry Parks, and what a voice !! Mr Parks gave the role of his lifetime in this great musical. He may have not looked like Jolson but he captured many of his mannerisms. It was a shame that Larry Parks's career was ruined by the Communist witch hunts of the early 50s, he could have gone on to greater fame, but this film cemented what fame he had. A great film to watch along with The Jazz Singer, the film that ""broke the sound barrier"" as it was aptly called.",1502755200,,612,4.2844827586206895

514114,5,6302800854,"There are no fans of Jolson who haven't watched this movie many times. Jolson recorded these tracks when he was 60 YEARS OLD and had ONE LUNG. When the studio execs came to see Jolson in the hospital to decide whether he was still strong and good enough to do the tracks, Jolson got out of bed and did a 45 minute presentation to them. They left his room satisfied. Shortly after they left, he collapsed from exhaustion. This is not supposed to be a documentary so who cares whether it's anything but entertaining. Jolson's voice is fantastic and Larry Parks' lip synching is just about perfect. Bob Dylan said of Jolson's voice...""somebody whose life I can feel.""",1497225600,,664,4.635593220338983

514240,5,6302800854,"The Jolson Story is one of the first of the bio-pics produced by Hollywood, just after Yankee Doodle Dandy, the story of George M. Cohan.  It covers his growing up the son of a Jewish Cantor in Washington D.C. with an interest in the burlesque theater in the neighborhood up to his return to show business following his marriage to Ruby Keeler (Julie Benson in the film).  She wanted him to quit show business, which he did for many years, but his love for singing and performing came through at the end of the film when he asked to sing at a nightclub.  Great lip singing by Larry Parks to many great Jolson songs.

It wasn't like that, when I watched this movie on TV. Perhaps the DVD studio should have compressed the sound's dynamics, making it appropriate for home viewing. I am not an expert in these matters, but doubt that can do the required compression with my playing equipment. Otherwise, it is a decent movie, a typical feel-good, pseudo-biography of the times. The dialog is wooden occasionally, to the point of being difficult to listen to, especially between Jolson and his wife. The latter is played by an actress, whom I would characterize as below average. If Larry Parks' talking at all times as if addressing theatrical audience was deliberate, him singing with a voice of an old man sounds a little odd. I am not a big fan of Broadway and a brash singing style that Al Jolson espoused, but acknowledge that he was was a remarkable talent and enjoy many of his numbers. There are some touching moments in the film. Would have given it 4 stars, if not for the sound.",1409011200,,1115,4.636363636363637

He loves the voice of Jolson and he tells me he has played it through ten times.  Each time he plays it he says it changes and there are things in it he never heard before.  I think he actually believes that when he's sleeping, someone is tinkering with the disk and putting new stuff in it.  Also, he's asked many times how Larry Parks can be signing but with Jolson's voice.  To me too, it seems magical.  - Tom O'Neill",1407110400,,578,4.1441441441441444

514515,5,6302800854,I loved the music and especially how believable Larry Parks was in the role of Al Jolson.  A must have!,1376092800,,103,4.15
514516,3,6302800854,"Among my earliest musical memories was finding myself enthralled with the musical stylings of the great Al Jolson. By this time the Jolson story and most of his music was available to me only by rerun television shows. Even so I was an Al L Jolson fan before I knew the name of any AM Radio top 40 singers. That said I fully expected the Jolson story to be a slam-dunk five-star no questions asked great movie.

Allowing that this is a fairly standard period film biopic the portrayal of the great Al Jolson is surprisingly complex. We follow the young cantor's son from his preadolescent break with his father -with his father's grudging approval up through a rather abrupt ending which appears to coincide with the ending of his marriage. In between the best news about this movie is that Al Jolson sings while his on-screen actor counterpart, Larry Parks lip-synchs. That Larry Parks speaks without any of the New York accent of Al Jolson is forgivable but painfully apparent every time Mr. Parks bursts out with Al Jolson's signature ""You ain't heard nothing yet!""

As much as I loved all of the singing, all of the choreography was dull. Al Jolson was one of singers who linked tin-pan alley to jazz to Broadway but other than changes in costumes there was a distinct shortage of clues as to what time periods were being portrayed. Full marks should go to the folks in makeup who did a brilliant job in aging many of the supporting actors. The aging of William Demarest (Steve Martin), Ludwig Donath (Cantor Yelson) and Tamara Shayne (Mrs. Yoelson) constituted noteworthy cosmetic effects and the most reliable indicators of the passage of time. Larry Parks of course receives only a light graying at the temple ensuring that even the mature Al Jolson is portrayed as a handsome man perhaps more so than the real Al Jolson.

A final point this movie seriously dragged out. This may have been to provide sufficient storyline to justify so many different musical numbers;  all of them near signature tunes for the many hit wonder Jolson.

One problem watching a 60-year-old movie in the 21st century. Al Jolson built part of his early career as a black faced singer. A typical 1946 audience would have known this and not given it a thought. I found myself very uncomfortable and desperately wishing that this portion of the man's history could quickly be concluded. By the end of th emovie, everytime I heard the word ""Mammy"", I was shuddering.

The real Al Jolson was a lot of things. He was one of the all-time great singing entertainers in the history of America. According to the movie he was a great guy if more than a little of a workaholic. He was also an enormous egotist. He was famous for stopping a show to give a spontaneous concert under the theory that he was the only reason why the audience was there. This is portrayed in the movie but absent any of the friction it tended to cause with performers who also wanted their chance to be seen. The Al Jolson Story of course emphasizes the best of this performer but too many of the details around the edges were sacrificed. You may love the experience of Jolson singing but get fustrated with impatience for this movie to end.",1375228800,3,3191,4.638938053097345

514621,5,6302800854,"I first saw The Jolson Story on Million Dollar Movie, growing up as a kid, perhaps 6 or 7.  I loved this film and used to sing the songs all the time.  My grandmother knew many of these songs and was delighted to hear me sing them.  As a matter of fact, one of my dad's customers gave us a box of old toys, and in there was a costume with striped pants and a long tailed coat.  I used to wear this and pretend I was in blackface singing the score.
Because this movie was televised with commercials, often it was trimmed down, so it was nice to see the entire film restored.  I'm sure there were several scenes I had never seen before.
The color print is amazing.  As a matter of fact, I had remembered this to be a black and white movie; it wasn't, but we only had b&w tv!  The film looks like it was meticulously restored, but the cover doesn't say anything about that.  There was only one early scene, where the young Asa (Scotty Beckett) is singing Ave Maria in a catholic boys choir, that the sound is distorted. Otherwise the picture and sound are clear and crisp.
My only disappointment is that there are no extras on the DVD except for two trailers - which I expected to be for The Jolson Story and Jolson Sings Again, but they were for the original Lost Horizon (just a promo, not even scenes from the film); and for Pal Joey, which has no connection to the Jolson Story.
I would have preferred a commentary track; clips of the real Al Jolson; some documentary material about Jolson and also about Larry Parks and his great success in the role, and subsequent fall from grace through the House Unamerican Activities Committee.

""According to music historian Larry Stempel, ""No one had heard anything quite like it before on Broadway."" Author Stephen Banfield agrees, writing that Jolson's style was ""arguably the single most important factor in defining the modern musical...""

He enjoyed performing in blackface makeup--a theatrical convention since the mid-19th century. With his unique and dynamic style of singing black music, like jazz and blues, he was later credited with single-handedly introducing African-American music to white audiences. As early as 1911 he became known for fighting against anti-black discrimination on Broadway. Jolson's well-known theatrics and his promotion of equality on Broadway helped pave the way for many black performers, playwrights, and songwriters, including Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller, and Ethel Waters.

The Al Jolson Story is an excellent reminder of the music that was sung by African-American singers and musicians that most American paid little attention to until a Jewish man born in Russia (Lithuania)embraced it fully and brought a music style that he loved to all Americans.",1351555200,,1274,5.556701030927835

It may be the greatest job of lip-syncing ever seen on film.  Jolson's voice was never better, and although the story was probably not all that accurate dealing with the facts of
Jolson's life, the movie was highly entertaining.  How sad that Parks was unfairly dragged into the McCarthy Witch Hunt Trials just when his career was taking off.

514717,5,6302800854,"The Jolson Story is a fictionalized account of the life of Al Jolson who was, undoubtedly, the leading entertainer of the early years of the twentieth century. The screenplay makes many significant departures from the truth of his life as we know it. In fact, you could say that it contains one whopper after another. But, hey folks, this is ""show biz"" not history. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and, after more than sixty years, consider it one of the best musicals ever made.
  I was sixteen in 1946 when ""The Jolson Story"" was released. In America we were in the middle of the ""Swing Era"". The Dorsey brothers, Glen Miller, Benny Goodman, and Harry James were all the rage - it was OK but nothing special. Little did I realize that it was better than anything that would come later. The more American popular music evolved, in my opinion, the worse it got; which is the opposite of what I think shoud have happened.
  All during the 1940s Hollywood kept turning out movie after movie depicting the music, entertainers and performers of bygone eras. I came to realize that I liked the music of these bygone eras better than my own. By far, the most influential of these movies was ""The Jolson Story."" Al Jolson began his career at the very beginning of the twentieth century and reached his greatest fame in the ""Roaring Twenties."" He made the first talking motion picture, ""The Jazz Singer"", in 1927. By 1940 he was in retirement and obscurity and I was only vaguely aware of him. Surprisingly, ""The Jolson Story"" was the biggest box office smash hit of 1946 and revitalized Jolson's career. He came out of retirement and was immensely popular until his death in 1950. It also propelled to stardom the thirty-two year old Larry Parks in the title role. Jolson wanted to play the part but the studio decided that at 60 he was too old and chose Parks instead.
  Movie synopsis: In the early scenes Jolson the boy (about 14)is played by child actor Scotty Becket who has been ""discovered"" by a vaudeville entertainer named Steve Martin (played by William Demarest). Martin, who plays requests from the audience on his base fiddle has planted young Jolson in the balcony and, on signal, the young Jolson stands up and sings the requested song. (Actually Becket ""lip synchs"" to Rudy Wissler who does the real singing). This works for a while but at about age 16 Jolson's voice ""cracks."" Disaster is avoided when Jolson improvises whistling instead of singing. This situation lasts about a year or so during which time Scotty Becket ""morphs"" into Larry Parks who plays Jolson for the rest of the movie (but ""lip synchs"" to Jolson who does all the singing parts) Jolson's singing voice eventually comes back and he begins bugging Martin for a chance to sing. Martin keeps putting him off. One day, on returning from lunch, Martin and Jolson encounter Tom Baron (played the Bill Goodwin). Baron does a blackface singing act but he's drunk. Jolson tries to sober him up while Martin gets ready for their own act. However, Baron passes out in his dressing room and Jolson decides to do the act in blackface himself. On his way to the stage Jolson encounters Martin who, too late, realizes that Baron is really Jolson in blackface. There then ensues my favorite scene in the whole movie: after a faltering beginning Jolson collects himself and gives a sensational and jazzy performance of ""Rosie, You Are My Posie."" Lou Dogstader and Oscar Hammerstein are in the audience and they immediately rush backstage to Baron's dressing room (he has miraculously sobered up). Hammerstein, who had never seen Baron perform before, signs him to a contract. Dogstader, who has seen Baron before, is suspicious. When he detects blackface behind Jolson's ear he realizes that Jolson did the real singing and tries to sign him for ""Dogstader's Minstrels"". But Jolson, ever loyal, refuses to leave Steve Martin. However Martin collaborates in a ruse and makes the supreme sacfrifice knowing that Jolson is going on to greater fame. Jolson ends up with Dogstader. However, he is not happy with Dogstader and they eventually part company so Jolson can ""do his own thing"" i.e. sing a new type of song. Out of the blue this struggling, little known performer, receives a telephone call from Tom Baron, who is now that manager of the Winter Garden Theater in New York City. Baron offers him a spot on the bill and tells him he can sing anything he wants. (I nominate this scene for biggest whopper in the movie). Jolson accepts but on opening night management  realizes the show is running too long and decides to cut Jolson's act just as he's about to go on. He rushes on stage. They draw the curtain. He pops through the curtain. The give up and history is made. He sings ""Mammy"" in blackface and on one knee, the crowd goes wild, and he becomes ""Al Jolson, the Greatest Entertainer of Them All."" In 1927, when he is making the first talking motion picture, ""The Jazz Singer,"" he falls in love with ""Julie Benson"" (played by Evelyn Keyes, who was Scarlett O'Hara's little sister in ""Gone With The Wind)and they marry. The marriage is not successful because she wants a simple life on the farm while he has this uncontrollable urge to perform. The movie ends, sadly, in divorce. Which, of course, means there must be a sequel.
  Jolson was married to Ruby Keeler who was a movie star in her own right. She refused to give permission for her name to be used in ""The Jolson Story,"" which suggests that their divorce was less than amicable. Given Jolson's outsize ego, this is not surprising. The studio dreamed up the name ""Julie Benson"" because they could not use the name Ruby Keeler. Some other reviewer wondered who ""Julie Benson"" was. She was a fictional character. Ninety percent of this movie was fictional.
  To say that I enjoyed this movie would be an egregious understatement. I was enthralled, captivated and entranced and began to do my own ""Jolson impressions"" at the family Christmas parties much to the enjoyment of my aunts and uncles. I always thought that Al Jolson had a rather harsh voice (definitely not the golden tones of a Crosby) and that it was his ""style"" that put them over. There was no middle ground as far as Jolson was concerned. You either loved him or hated him. My late wife knew my sister before she knew me and (unbeknownst to me) would play my Al Jolson records when I wasn't around. My sister hated it.
  Both of the actors who played the title role in ""The Jolson Story"" had very tragic endings to their careers.
  In 1948 Scotty Becket appeared in ""A Date With Judy"" with Jane Powell and Elizabeth Taylor. But in that same year he was convicted of drunken driving. In 1955 he was suspected of, and there was much incriminating evidence
to suggest, that he had robbed a motel and pistol-whipped the clerk. The movie roles disappeared as he sank deeper into a life of crime and drugs. In 1968 he checked into the ""Royal Palms Hotel"", a Hollywood nursing home. It appeared that he had suffered a beating in what might have been a drug deal gone wrong. He was discovered dead two days later from a suicidal overdose of barbiturates. He was thirty-nine years old.
  Larry Parks was catapulted to super-stardom as a result of his appearance in ""The Jolson Story"" and its sequel ""Jolson Sings Again"" which came out in 1949. By the 1950s he was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. In 1951 he was summoned before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and tearfully admitted that he had been a member of the Communist Party. As a result he was placed on the ""blacklist"" and never again received a major acting part. Of all the emotions in the human psyche fear is the one that is dealt with most abominably. A large percentage of the human race will cringe in fear at the slightest provocation. These fears are then exploited and manipulated by politicians (usually Republicans) for their own nefarious purposes. Larry Parks was a victim of the McCarthy insanity. He deserved better.",1295568000,3,8002,4.704285714285715

514722,5,6302800854,"Jolson was the greatest entertainer of the first half of the 20th Century, and this movie is still great entertainment after over 60 years.

Ruby Keeler was Catholic, who after marrying Jewish Jolson, obtained a divorce, both scandalous at the time.  Even today, the Catholic church does not recognize divorce, and will only grant anullment -- that is, the marriage never existed.  She had retired from pictures and remarried, and was raising four young children when this movie was being made, so it's really not unexpected  that she would not want her name used in the movie.",1264896000,,577,4.917525773195877
514723,5,6302800854,"This movie started the wave of biopics that began after WWII. Larry Parks doesn't look the least bit like Al Jolson. For that matter, the script doesn't look much like Jolson's life either. However, the film is very entertaining with a few ironies for the classic film buff. When Parks is on stage, you really get a taste of Jolson in his prime. Al Jolson actually tutored Parks in how to move and interact with the audience using his own style, and it comes across well, even if it is obvious that you are hearing Jolson's voice during the performances and that this voice does not match Larry Parks' speaking voice at all.

Jolson's life story has been sanitized here to keep in line with the values of the post-war motion picture production code, right down to extending the life of Jolson's mother an extra forty years - she died when Al was ten. Also, the movie has Jolson playing the career-absorbed bachelor until he meets his wife Julie Benson (code for Ruby Keeler) when he is in his forties. Yes, Al was career-absorbed, but he still went through two marriages and two divorces before he ever got to Ruby Keeler.

Two very interesting points are the insertion of the fictional character Steve Martin that allegedly got Al into show business and also the choice of director. The first interesting point is that fictional character Steve Martin is played by William Demarest, who actually had a bit part in 1927's ""The Jazz Singer"". You'll see him sharing a plate of eggs with Al at Coffee Dan's just minutes before Al bursts into song in ""Toot Toot Tootsie"". Demarest was a bit player over at Warner's during the beginning of his career. He had no real association with Al Jolson that I know of.  The second interesting point is the choice of director - Alfred E. Green. Mr. Green was among that group of directors that ground out the early talkies for Warner Bros during the time that Jolson was a star at that studio. However, he never directed any of the eight motion pictures that Al Jolson starred in for Warners. There were four directors that Jolson worked with over at Warner Brothers that were still alive when this film was made, but for some reason none of them got the job.

At any rate, the movie is very entertaining and well-paced with great renditions of Jolson's acts and songs. For the unvarnished truth about Jolson's life, try to find a copy of the documentary ""The Real Al Jolson Story"" made in 1986 and originally telecast by Bravo, back when they really were dedicated to the performing arts and before they became so concerned with Top Chefs and Flipping Out - you know, the same kind of stuff you can find on 50 other channels.",1257552000,5,2661,4.595789473684211

514782,4,6302800854,"The Jolson Story is the first in what is essentially a two part biopic of the life and times of Al Jolson. Unfortunately, the story has been changed quite a bit from what the reality was for Jolson. However, the convincing acting is incredible and the plot moves along at a very good pace.

We see the movie begin with young Asa Yoelson (who changed his name to Al Jolson) coming very late for his father's synagogue service because he was singing in a burlesque theater. Of course, Asa Yoelson gets quite a punishment from his parents, Cantor Yoelson and Mrs. Yoelson (Ludwig Donath and Tamara Shayne, respectively). Eventually Asa runs away from home to join up with a vaudevillian named Steve Martin (William Demarest) and Asa gets his start in show business and a name change along the way. We also see Jolson constantly moving up the ladder and getting more and more of the spotlight especially after he leaves Steve Martin and joins Lew Dockstader's show. We then see Al move to the Winter Garden Theater where he loves his audience and they love him for living them.

Al eventually hires Steve Martin to be his manager and proceeds to tackle show business with a manic fit that never seems to stop. After every triumph, Al wants more. He falls in love and marries Julie Benson (Evelyn Keyes) although in real life Jolson was never married to anyone named Julie Benson. He was in fact married to four women including Ruby Keeler; and for some reason I can't figure out there is no mention of Ruby Keeler in this movie. There's also some doubt that Al Jolson's father was actually a Cantor in a synagogue.

What will happen after Al marries Julie Benson--a woman who wants to live life at a slower pace in the country? How will Al and his wife reconcile their differences? He wants to entertain and tour in big cities; she wants to the simple, quiet life. No spoilers here--watch the movie to find out the answers to these questions and more!

The DVD offers few extras; but with a film this good, you can overlook the lack of extras and even, to some extent, the discrepancies between Al Jolson's real life and the biopic. I guess Hollywood in 1946 wanted to ""sanitize"" Al Jolson's story especially since he was still living at the time this film was released. However, I'm disappointed in the discrepancies between Jolson's real life and the life story told in this movie. I will give four stars to The Jolson Story on DVD.

Even with its flaws, I still highly recommend this for people who want to know about one of America's greatest entertainers ever. It has been said time and again that Al Jolson was one of the first to be able to reach out to his adoring audiences and make every last person feel that he was truly singing to them and them alone. Al Jolson deserves to be remembered much, much more than he is; and this movie is a great way for us to remember the remarkable talents of this man.",1197763200,2,2909,4.522813688212928

We saw it twice that week. I would do it again today in a heartbeat. The vocals of Al Jolson are infectious and addictive, the songs memorable and Larry Parks needs only to be remembered for this characterization to have a place among Hollywood's fine performances. No one could have equalled his effort and complete command of the Jolson personna.

Parks (oscar nomination) cannot convey the dynamic charisma reported about the live performances of the man he portrays, but then, Jolson himself could not do that on film, either.

514823,4,6302800854,"The Jolson Story is a surprisingly good example of a decent bio-pic. It covers the life of the incomparable Al Jolson, a wonderful performer best known today for his performance in the first talkie ""The Jazz Singer."" It seems that the film goes nowhere that the ordinary bio-pic about a show-biz star doesn't, but it is somehow better. Perhaps that is because the subject was such an amazing performer.

Larry Parks plays Jolson, a seemingly strange choice since the two do not look alike. However, Parks looks quite a bit like an older version of Scotty Beckett who plays the younger Jolson, so the casting works well. Parks does a good job impersonating Jolson's style as a singer even though he is lipsyncing to Jolson's own voice. At first, he seems a bit stiff, but later, the movements become his own and he seems very natural in the part. Jolson was a very complex figure, but he makes the man relatable and enjoyable. It almost doesn't matter if all he does is sing (and over 20 songs too); that is what he did best after all.

Evelyn Keyes plays Julie, a thinly disguised substitute for Ruby Keeler. She does not capture Keeler's natural innocence, but she does make a good match for Jolson. Her part in the story adds more emotional connection to the film. In fact, her role at the end of the film makes it all the better since it ends with a sob instead of a soft sigh.

There are some inaccuracies in this movie. For example, Jolson did not sing ""There's a Rainbow Round My Shoulder"" in The Jazz Singer. Still, these small issues do not ruin the film at all.",1149465600,3,1570,4.5017543859649125

Larry Parks really does a very creditable job of portraying the Great Al Jolsen, whose whole raaison d'etre was to please an audience. He really seemed to be alive only when on stage and the movie conveys this message very clearly. Well worth adding to your collection!",1142640000,2,411,4.802816901408451
514825,5,6302800854,"This comment is for those so offended by blackface that they would like to see it edited out of The Jolson Story. It will never happen, of course. Aside from rewriting history, it would sacrifice half the songs and make nonsense of the plot. Still, there's good reason to feel repelled. Jolson put on blackface and sang Dixie nostalgia at a time when lynching and the Ku Klux Klan were in revival and blacks were fleeing the South for their lives. Yet there is another side to it.

 Imitation is still the sincerest form of flattery. Artists don't copy styles they despise, only those they admire. We can see how that works when it comes to more recent performers. We don't think of Eminem, or white gospel singers, as denigrating African-Americans. Elvis' first record, It's All Right, had such a black sound that many assumed he was black.  Elvis was born and raised in the segregated Mississippi of the 1930's and 40's, yet his imitation of black sound was homage, not mockery.

But blackface was different, right? Or was it?

To understand Jolson, you have to go back to Stephen Foster. America's first great writer of popular songs, born in the 1830's, Foster was a northerner who visited the South, very briefly, only once in his life. Yet he was steeped in minstrel music and would black up as a child to perform it. In his day, black and white songs styles were perceived as different in kind.  If you were trying to sound black, it made sense to try to look black. Foster wrote only two hits in white ""parlor"" style: Jeannie with the Light Brown Hair and Beautiful Dreamer.  But he wrote dozens in black styles ranging from tragic laments to comic ditties.

Jolson's songs abound in allusions to Foster: Weep no more, my lady, Old Black Joe, Old Folks at home, Swannee River.  But what could such songs have meant to an immigrant Jewish youth of the early 20th century?

Like blacks, immigrants were also uprooted. They also knew hard times and relied on humor to survive. Also, by then, Foster had become folk music. Black or white, everyone knew his songs from the cradle. Yet they were still seen as black-style songs, clearly different from white-style ones such as Banks of the Wabash and When You Were Sweet Sixteen. So white entertainers still blacked up to sing them, and anything at all like them.

Irrational? Absurd?  Sure. But in a society so segregated by race, how else could whites hear black-style music? Look at the audiences in The Jolson Story. Entirely white. The entertainers too.

Fortunately, change was coming and a new black music would drive it. With the triumph of blues and jazz, black music became everyone's music. Blacks and whites were freed to sing the same songs. Backface vanished.

Jolson's career coincided with that transition. The Jolson Story captures his life-changing discovery of jazz and his attempt to marry it to the Foster tradition. Let us be grateful that his superb film biographies were made exactly when and how they were, preserving both his amazing voice and one of the weirdest moments in American cultural",1135296000,26,3070,4.757062146892656
514826,4,6302800854,"A musical biopic of Al Jolson which stars Larry Parks. Parks got an Oscar nomination as did William Demarest who plays Jolson's mentor. Parks is excellent as Jolson. He has a real sense of enthusiasm and his eyes are expressive. You can see why he became a legendary entertainer. Jolson was the star of The Jazz Singer, the first ""talkie."" The black face is disturbing, but it was a popular form of entertainment. You hear Jolson's singing of hits like Mammy.

One of the main selling points of the movie is not only Parks performance but the all of the scenes that led to Jolson becoming an entertainer. You see scenes from his youth and his family life. The actor who portrays the young Jolson is very good.",1126483200,3,709,4.5390625
514863,5,6302800854,"What makes this movie so notable is the artful acting of Larry Parks, who made a decent living at portraying the great singers and musicians of the 20's and 30's. But it would have been just a notable movie without the actual voice of the great Al Jolson doing the singing to Park's masterful lip-movements. With that  ingredient added, the movie is great! My personal favorite songs of the movie, and it's difficult to choose only two, were the ""Anniversary Song"" and ""Sweet Sixteen"". These had to be two of Jolson's greatest renditions of the romantic ballad form. Both songs were in the movie and became instant hit songs on radio stations around the country. In addition to his great singing, Jolson's whistling, an art form in itself, is introduced in the movie as a 'save the show' stop-gap when his teen-age tenor voice gives out in mid-tune and he quickly introduces the whistle as though it was part of the score. It became his signature and a few other singers of the 30's - 40's tried various forms of whistling, Der Bingle (Bing Crosby), for one but none, in my opinion, had the volume and range of Jolson.

There was, however, one drawback to the movie which would make it, at the least, a 'concern' today . The movie version shows scenes of Jolson performing in 'blackface', which was in fact a significant part of his stage repertoire, and, in 1946, was not considered ""politically incorrect"". It's unfortunate that Jolson's 'minstrel show' format was included in the movie but in 1946 we, America, still had a long way to go vis-a-vis sensitivity to such portrayals. I have heard that some of the  re-releases via VHS tape edited those portions out but I have not viewed any of these.

If one simply concentrates on the story and the music, and if one really enjoys the vaudeville genre of the 20's and 30's, then this movie is for you. Oh, by the way, be prepared to see Al portrayed as less than sensitive to his wife's and their marriage's need for privacy and his withdrawal from the limelight.",1109289600,8,2014,4.633053221288516
514864,5,6302800854,"Growing up in Canada this DVD, The Jolson Story and Jolson Sings Again were always a favorite  of mine.  When I was young both these films played every New Year's Eve on television, but this stopped about 30 years ago.  Film classics even in their own time, these DVD's do justice to the way they used to make them.

  Even if you are not entertained by all the Hollywood make believe in these films, you will be introduced to one of the greatest voices of the last century.  ""Boy"" could Al Jolson ever belt them out, considering he performed live most of the time without the support of a microphone.  In our times the only other entertainer to reach such vocal highs would have been Roy Orbison.

  So if you want an eveing of pure entertainment with out sex or violence, I recommend you purchase both The Jolson Story and Jolson Sings Again and brace yourself for a splendid time.",1104624000,11,883,4.45625
514865,4,6302800854,"As a music historian in general, and as a performer of many of the pieces that Jolson made famous (piano for my part), and also as the son of an actor from radio and film that worked in Hollywood during Jolson's reign there, and as a collector of ancient recordings from the pre-vinyl era plus sheet music, I have had a lot of exposure to Jolson and his personna outside of these films. The view from inside is a bit sanitized, but not horrid.

Larry Parks is more than adequate for the role. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of the film media from 1946 (lack of widescreen and loss of ambience without surround sound and fx), the true essence of how BIG Jolson was on stage is lost to a degree. Jolson was not the best singer. He was not the best of lyricists. He was not the most humble of people. He had flaws that were both visible and invisible. But... HE WAS A GREAT ENTERTAINER. My Sheet Music Collection, which currently numbers over 7000 pieces, will validate that. Jolson saw his face on more sheet music covers than the bulk of many smaller publishers total output. You don't get there through simple coercion - it was his magnitude as a STAGE (not film) entertainer that got him there and kept him on top for two decades.

To some degree, while there is whitewashing and Hollywood sanitizing (such as the odd omission of Ruby Keeler's name in conjunction with her character), some of the personal flaws of Jolson are most certainly presented on screen. A more personal look from this decade would show a very troubled man with blatant insecurities, yet still quite likable. At the very least, this biopic was certainly better than some of that time, including the nearly totally fictitious Cole Porter mishap (discussed in D'Lovely). Note also that only Jolson and Fanny Brice have had no less than two consecutive biopics made about them. The incidents are otherwise not totally contrived, but some are a bit out of sequence, as is the music. I would guess the use of Rainbow On My Shoulder as a piece from the Jazz Singer (it was actually in The Singing Fool) was to get around Warner copyright issues.

Going back to the Ruby Keeler thing, the character in this movie is called Julie Benson. This is not only historically inaccurate but downright confusing, since there is no Benson in 42nd Street or Dames, which are among her movies prominently mentioned in The Jolson Story. What is more confusing is that Keeler often referred to herself as Mrs. Jolson long after their marriage was over. Maybe it was another copyright issue with Warner, possibly since they may have owned her name at the time. If she objected, in spite of how obvious it was to the public that it was her character on screen, I don't know why.

Other omissions among this and the accompany film (Jolson Sings Again) include two missing wives, the mention that Jazz Singer was originally a vehicle for Georgie Jessel, then later stolen from Eddie Cantor, the making of the Vitaphone - A Plantation Act - a year before The Jazz Singer, the lawsuit over the plagiarism of Avalon, etc. I prefer to think of these as omissions more so than inaccuracies, but they do add a certain bias to the story when these things are known.

For all the good, there are a few flaws. Parks is NOT Jolson, but he manages to overcome that so much that he becomes Jolson part way into the film. They could have minimized his hair a bit more than was done to give a closer appearance, but his synchronization with Jolson's recorded tracks is exemplary. But... the switch between Parks' speaking voice and Jolson's singing voice is jarring at times. Further, the arrangements being played during the ""ragtime era"" are really the swing era arrangements used for his Decca recordings. Anybody who has heard Jolson's work on Columbia or Victor knows that he was in much better voice with a timbre closer to Parks back in the 1910s and 1920s. I suppose now that his voice could be extracted from those recordings and laid over new recorded orchestrations. Stylistically the newer arrangements for older songs don't work, but appealed to the audience of the time (my mother saw the thing four times when it came out!).

The DVD box is misleading. The film is in limited scope 2.0 stereo, not mono (is this an original or redone - knowing Sony it was contrived). There is good separation between the underscore and the center channel voices through most of it, except when Jolson's recorded tracks are used, and those are mostly mono. The color is quite beautiful and not oversaturated. Chroma correction for this restoration is fairly accurate.

Even though the film can't fully capture Jolson (you need some CDs of his early work to even approach that), it helps to explain why the ""mammy factor"" worked so well for him and why he is still discussed a full century after he got his start on the stage. Since the second film, Jolson Sings Again, literally starts within an hour of when the first film ends, you really need the set. It also displays Parks as a talent of his own, albeit one that was sadly taken down during the McCarthy hearings, and whose career never recovered from the association.

In any case, walk a million miles and get some smiles. Buy the films!",1096416000,109,5234,4.644708423326134

He was an accomplished actor from Austria, and a fine person. There is little comparable to the ""Anniversary Song"" as performed later in the film.

514872,5,6302800854,"This movie will always be in my top ten list of favourites. I was five years old when i was first saw it. It was the evening of Sept 22 1947. I went with my mother and aunt to our local cinema which happened to be opposite my grandparents house in Holt,Norfolk. U.K. The movie changed my life from then on i wanted to sing and to this day i still make my living as a vocalist. In the days before TV and only having the Radio to listen to i grew up thinking Larry Parks really was Al Jolson and the shock in later years to find that he really did`nt look like him and the story was pure Hollywood hoakam. It was almost as big as the shock i had learning Bing Crosby wore a toupee.
 After all these years i don`t care its a wonderful movie that still brings a tear to the eye when i think of that small boy going to the movies with his mother and aunt. Larry Parks was brilliant ( can anyone name any other movies he was in ) The great Al was still in top form singing the songs that he made famous sadly leaving us just as part two was released. I urge anyone who hasn't seen this movie to give it a viewing. Hollywood at its best. And please please please a DVD release.
