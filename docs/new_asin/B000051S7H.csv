7929312,4,B000051S7H,"Story is about a small group of home grown terrorist creating chaos in Japan in the early 1970's.  The objective is clear but there is a lot of disloyalty within the group.  I viewed the film on DVD and it is in black & white and partly in color.  There is quite a bit of nudity, part of the story, but a little unusual for a movie produced in that era.  Story was interesting and acting was good.  Koji Wakamatsu interview (translated to English) in Extras was also interesting.",1450396800,,479,4.337078651685394
7929313,5,B000051S7H,"In a rare and most informing interview included on this DVD (for which I give five stars) director Wakamatsu Koji says plainly and with conviction that his movies rewrite film grammar. Soft-spoken with an impish grin, his manner reveals a moxy, an intelligence, an innovator who was drawn to filmmaking in such an unlikely manner that his low-budget and stylish films are to studio pictures like an Outsider painting is to Western Art. There is a profusion of sex and violence, but in the end, they seem more like a rite of passage, a breaking down of barriers, an initiation into his perspective on the world. Ecstasy of the Angels continually surprised me with satire, humor, and a strong, yet understated pathos. And, cinematically, the fistful of unexpected explosions of color, jabbed like punctuation marks into an otherwise black & white film, hooked me good.

Although Wakamatsu has made over 100 films in the last 45 years, several of which he talks about in this DVD interview, they are rarely screened in the U.S. outside film festivals. Working as a construction worker before he began his film career in 1963, he nonetheless made a stir at the 1965 Berlin Film Festival with his Secrets Behind the Wall, which competed for the Golden Bear, no less. A major influence in Japan's pink (soft porn) film movement, his subjects often revolve around politics, murder and sex. In the West he is potentially best known for his role in producing In the Realm of the Senses.

His new film, United Red Army, recently won two prizes at the 2008 Berlin Film Festival, the C.I.C.A.E./Arte Award and the Netpac (Network for the Promotion of Asian Cinema) Award. At present there are less than a handful of his films available, but with these new accolades, perhaps more of Wakamatsu's art will make its way to us. I hope so because discovering the art of Wakamatsu Koji isn't like finding a new flavor of ice cream, it's like stumbling upon a whole new dessert.",1204502400,2,1959,4.792899408284024

I hear that the great Female Convinct Scorpion: Jailhouse 41 was by far the highlight, but if this is even half as good, I want to own it. Directed by Koji Wakamatsu.",979430400,3,276,4.54
