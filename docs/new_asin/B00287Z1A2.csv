3872039,5,B00287Z1A2,"I enjoyed it but I do wish that the ones who are making the smurfs d.v.d.s would put more than 5 cartoons on a disk.  In volume 1 and volume 2 they had at least 15 episodes for each one and now its down to 5.  Other than that, I like them and hope they keep them coming.  The d.v.d. itself was in good condition.",1253664000,5,312,3.769230769230769
3872040,4,B00287Z1A2,"Here's a brand-new DVD starring your favorite blue sprites that live in harmony in a secluded village in the forest.  It's 5 more episodes of the Smurfs on DVD for the first time.  The tiny denizens will encounter new friends, familiar foes, and more new adventures from the second season such as ""The Last Laugh"", ""A-maze-ing Smurfs"" and ""The Good, the Bad, and the Smurfy"".

Like the first DVD ""True Blue Friends"", this DVD has a bonus feature consisting of an interactive Smurf Village with character bios and hidden facts that you probably have never heard about !

So whether it's keeping the peace within and beyond the Smurf village or encountering the wicked wizard Gargamel, these little guys pull through when they work together.  Surely another DVD will be out soon, but it'd be nicer if the next one had, say, more than 5 episodes like 10 on one disc if possible.  But keep your eyes open nonetheless.",1252454400,9,913,4.710691823899371
3872041,5,B00287Z1A2,It's a shame Volume Two sold so poorly it seemed everyone that made volume one sell so well forget to buy the next one. So we are stuck with shorter and cheaper releases. Regardless its great to be getting these hand drawn smurf episodes and this is a good volume for all ages.,1251331200,5,277,4.245283018867925
3872042,3,B00287Z1A2,"The dvd consists of 5 episodes.  I do not understand why it takes months to release 5 episdes, at leasts with volumes I and II, there were 20+ episodes.  I like this dvd better than the previous one- True Blue Friends, because Gargamel is at least one of the villians in 3 or 4 of the episodes.  I would like for the next dvd to be Volume III consisting of 20+ episodes.",1250812800,16,370,4.111111111111111

The happy songs they sing are timeless. Every now and then I hear my 31 year old daughter singing the Smurf songs. It makes life more cheerful and lifts our spirits; makes us smile!

3872058,3,B00287Z1A2,"Warner Bros. is continuing their lazy or should I say greedy streak in releasing The Smurfs to DVD. The could at least finish releasing Season 2, but instead they release a handful of episodes to DVD.

The episodes are The Last Laugh, The A-maze-ing Smurfs, The Lost City of Yore, Johan's Army, and The Good, the Bad, and the Smurfy.

Don't get me wrong, I liked all five episodes, but it annoys  that Warner Bros. won't release more seasons sets.",1347926400,4,447,4.5625
