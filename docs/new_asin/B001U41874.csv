3796623,5,B001U41874,"I got a great price on this boxed set buying it on sale.  I bought it mainly for Office Space, although I have always liked Young Frankenstein.  I had never seen Napoleon Dynamite before purchasing this, and although it is not at the level of the other two movies it isn't bad.  Overall 1 great comedy (Office Space), 1 really good comedy (Young Frankenstein) and one pretty good comedy.",1291680000,,387,4.579710144927536
3796624,5,B001U41874,"My main criteria for buying movies is, ""will I want to watch it again?"".

Office Space is close to if not my favorite movie of all time; Napolean Dynamite is unique & memorable in it's own right; and Young Frankenstein is a classic.

If you liked one of these movies, chances are you'll like all three.  Which is a rarity for these blu-ray collections from what I've seen.

Two thumbs up.",1283817600,3,388,4.422535211267606
3796625,5,B001U41874,"These are my three all-time favorite comedies.  Well, maybe not ""all time,"" but I do love them!  And for the price, you really can't go wrong.  [Insert quote from each movie as witty ending to this review] NOT!!",1268784000,,211,4.5
3796626,3,B001U41874,"Is it me or does regular DVD's actually look better than Blue Ray???  Seems Blue Ray has a lag.  As far as the films good price and great.  Sound qaulity is a zero.  My volume is usually at 29 and for this set it has to be on 75.

3796627,5,B001U41874,"I'm sick of Blu-Ray sets where there is only one or two great movies in them. For Example, The Holiday Favorites Collection has Miracle on 34th Street, Home Alone, and Jingle All the Way. Why would anyone who likes Miracle on 34th Street also want to see the slapstick comedy of the other two movies? I mean, maybe Home Alone, but definitely not Jingle. The Funny Guy Collection, however, has three movies I would actually buy separately for one low price. They need to make more collection sets like this and I would buy more.",1256515200,4,527,4.557894736842106
3796628,5,B001U41874,"I got this collection because it is pretty cheap for three silly flicks and for only $39.49.

All three movies are hilarious and all looked and sounded amazing on Blu-ray. Office Space in particular looked very very good. Napoleon Dynamite also looked decent for a lower budget film. Young Frankenstein looked pretty good too, but the fact that it is in black and white and sort of was intended to be a little fuzzy.

I think FOX did a great job bringing all of these films to Blu-ray.

All in all, it is well worth it if you're like me and pretty much have a great collection of action Blu-rays an need a chuckle.",1247875200,4,614,4.368421052631579
