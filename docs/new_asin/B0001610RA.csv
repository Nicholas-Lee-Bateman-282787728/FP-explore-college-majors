I admit normally this would be frustrating and a problem, however when you start to get it it is so rewarding. This show is so good it creates a desire to have a deeper understanding of the world and does not feel like a chore at all. And trust me, I hate learning new things.
When you can explain the difference between Keiki and Renrin, and why they are names what they are, you are winning!",1357862400,,541,4.161904761904762

As Taiki has received no huge, phenomenal sign from the gods that he's found a ruler of Tai, everyone starts to leave Mt. Ho to go on with their lives - including General Gyosou.  But when he finds that he can't bear to be separated from the man, Taiki runs after him - so distraught that he doesn't even realize that he's finally transformed into his magical form - and impuslively kneels at his feet, reciting the Kirin's oath.  As they prepare for Gyosou's coronation, the poor, guilt-stricken boy expects to be struck down by the gods any second, responsible for the utter destruction of Tai, until he breaks down and confides in Keiki - who true to his word was the first to show up to congratulate Taiki and enlists the help of the King of En and Enki Rokuta to prove to the boy that things aren't as bad as he thinks.  Some great comedy here, as Shouryu goes a little overboard and winds up getting yelled at by Rokuta.  Having been together for over 500 years, the pair has a comfort level that makes their relationship a very interesting counterpoint to the other Ruler/Kirin teams we've seen so far.

After that, we get a tutorial from Enki Rokuta on the status of the current rulers and Kirin of all Twelve Kingdoms.  That is slightly interesting, but unfortunately he then goes on to recap Taiki's story, which is really completely unnecessary since it's only just ended and the arc was only seven episodes long.  It's a shame, because it's always such a pleasure when Rokuta takes center stage and he could have been put to such better use than a recap.

Finally, we check in again with Youko and Rakushun, who both try to keep the other from worrying about how they're doing in spite of the fact that Youko is having trouble with her arrogant, sexist ministers and Rakushun is experiencing prejudice at university in spite of the fact that he's achieved the highest marks in his grade.

Twelve Kingdoms remains a fascinating fantasy world to lose oneself in.",1130630400,,2051,4.594520547945206

The second story arc comes to a conclusion as Taiki has to defend his friend against a powerful spirit and come to grips with choosing a king. The only way to get out of it is to master one of the most powerful beasts in the Kingdom, a beast which no Kirin has ever won over. The problem is, he hasn't even been able to make a rodent submit to his power. The third episode is just a recap episode with some interesting details about other kingdoms and characters we haven't seen. It also deepens the mystery of Taiki and his king's disapperance which seems to bode of a story to come in the future. The last episode of the disk finally gets back to my favorite character, Youka, as she and Rakushun exchange bird mails. Youka is having trouble being taken seriously by her court officials, and Rakushun is entering into an educational academy. Both are troubled by their challenges but perhaps they can find courage through each other.

I have to admit that after I watched this disk Taiki grew on me, and whereas before, I was not interested in his story, now I want to know what is going on in his subplot of disappearances and amnesia. It seems like maybe they've had too many recap episodes already in this series, and the correspondance episode, while original, seemed to me to be a slight cheat on this anime.

This disk features an interview with one of the character designers of the show.",1119225600,,1485,4.476014760147602
