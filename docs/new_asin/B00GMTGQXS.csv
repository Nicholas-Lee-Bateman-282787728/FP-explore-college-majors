6087427,5,B00GMTGQXS,These are 4 of the best films Elvis made after Loving You and Love Me Tender. I was so happy to see them together in a package at a great price. About the packaging: I think the cds should be separated in the case instead of bring stacked on top of one another to protect from scratches.,1396656000,13,287,4.052631578947368

6087444,4,B00GMTGQXS,"I love all four movies, but I can't give it a five. Even though there was a Digital Ultraviolet card for all four movies, I could only download the digital version of two of the movies (Jailhouse Rock and GI Blues), and two could not be downloaded (King Creole and Viva Las Vegas, arguably Elvis' best movie). I tried using different Websites, Flixter and VuDu. Flixter said that King Creole and Viva Las Vegas weren't available for Download. VuDu said all four movies were available, but I could only download Jailhouse Rock and GI Blues.

I had a long flight to Osaka and wanted to watch the four films on my iPad during the trip.  Unfortunately, I could only watch two of them.",1474243200,,680,4.520325203252033

6087482,5,B00GMTGQXS,Three  of my top 10 favorite movies. King Creole is number 2 his acting skills were apparent and it is sad that he could not continue on with more roles such as that....he could do many things. He was viewed as a quick buck and his potential was never appreciated. He could have put an end to it but he did not. Fame and Fortune.....,1445731200,2,333,4.123076923076923

""King Creole,"" ""Jailhouse Rock,"" and ""Viva Las Vegas"" are all among his top 10 best quality movies. Those 3 films are also among his best movie soundtracks. ""G.I. Blues"" is at least mid-level quality so it's not too big a drag on the set, and has a few decent songs in it too. All 4 of these films are from roughly the first half of Elvis's movie career, and most of his better films are from that time. The other Elvis films that are among his best are ""Flaming Star,"" ""Wild in the Country,"" ""Loving You,"" ""Speedway,"" and ""Follow That Dream.""
