2212391,4,B0007GP79G,"The twin cameras mounted on the mast of the Mars rovers are spaced about the same distance as human eyes, and the same height as a person standing on the sandy desert.  In this strange and alien place, you can walk in the wheel tracks of the first mobile explorers ever to venture onto the surface of another planet -- where every photo could contain a fossil or rock layer that holds the secrets of another planet's history.  The engineering and scientific effort to achieve this is one of the greatest feats of our civilization, and surely one of the greatest thrills for anyone who has ever wondered about other worlds.  Both rovers are still exploring, and new photos arrive every day.  Personally, I can think of nothing more pleasant to enjoy with my morning coffee than a survey of the cold, hostile images of Mars -- free for anybody with an internet connection.  Poet or engineer -- don't miss a chance to see your first up-close view of the red planet!  -- Auralgo",1157932800,5,974,4.568965517241379
2212392,1,B0007GP79G,"Whilst writing this in September of 2005, I read reports of spectacular feats by the Mars rovers, climbing to unpresidented mountain heights and beaming back the most awesome panoramic veiws ever seen of Mars. I therefore cannot help thinking, why was this dvd released before the mission is complete, so as to include all this fantastic film from Mars ? Would it not have been more prudent to wait, and have the pick of Mars footage, or will there just be a 'directors cut' later ? I think I'll wait for the missions' conclusion before rushing out to buy a 'Mars rover' dvd.",1125878400,10,575,4.592233009708738

He's just the best narrator out there by far now that David McCullough is getting on in years. Though i think Nova is a little one-sided with the whole rah-rah of the US spending 100x more on a plane we don't need than on stuff like schools or the middle class... well, that's not their job here... and they captured what no indie filmaker could in a documentary--what went on behind the scenes during the Defense dept. contracting and the builds of the planes. Well done and very lovely. Too bad that almost 8 years later the planes are still not quite shipping... perhaps there should be a follow up script to the idea that these were supposed to be the ""cheap"" planes we all thought we needed somehow...",1461024000,,874,4.50314465408805

2212876,4,B0007GP79G,My daughter is 9 and absolutely loves this show. She's and engineering type of learner. However some of the terms need further explanation for her so we stop it every once in a while to explain some of the concepts.,1395446400,,215,4.4

2212881,4,B0007GP79G,"engaging and fun watch for kids and grown-ups. in some ways, there is less ""science"" per se but it makes for an interesting story...",1390953600,,132,4.541666666666667

2212883,5,B0007GP79G,It's always a pleasure to see the true performances of subjects from NOVA. NOVA presents many things in nature that many of us take as unimportant but NOVA bring us the true reality.,1390176000,,182,4.545454545454546

2212886,5,B0007GP79G,"I watched all these episodes on my kindle and I enjoyed them.  The show has high production values and is only a little dated on a few episodes, mainly due to the choice of music used.  Overall I like this show quite a bit because of its scientific approach to explaining things in an entertaining way.",1387670400,,302,4.375
2212887,5,B0007GP79G,Anything NOVA is outstanding. They have some of the best documentaries on T.V. or any other outlet. The separating twins is a must see for anyone the least bit interested in science and sociology.,1386892800,,196,4.794117647058823

2212900,5,B0007GP79G,"Here's the thing, these Nova series by PBS are fantastic. Engaging, entertaining and food for the mind. My shame stems from never once contributing to PBS to help fund these great programs. I changed that last night when I became a subscriber to my local PBS. I would have never given it a second thought if Prime had not given me the chance to binge. Thanks PBS!",1378512000,,363,4.432835820895522
2212901,5,B0007GP79G,I don't always agree with everything they talk about being a Creationist but alot of it is great information.  You can always learn and this is one to open your mind to several subjects,1375574400,,185,4.4411764705882355
2212902,4,B0007GP79G,I am a big fan of PBS programing and in particular NOVA. Shows like this are rare and it is good to see it gets a showcase on a site as big as Amazon.,1370131200,,150,3.4411764705882355
2212903,5,B0007GP79G,This was a great program for both adults and young children in our house (ages 5 and 6).  Everyone learned something and the kids asked for more.,1367193600,,145,4.37037037037037

2212906,4,B0007GP79G,"I watch these in the morning when I'm just having my first coffee & breakfast. It's interesting enough to keep me entertained but not so crazy that it's hard to deal with so early in the morning. I also like to watch it at night as I""m winding down for bed. The topics are always interesting!",1363305600,,292,4.232142857142857
2212907,5,B0007GP79G,I have just watched the first couple of episodes and I am really enjoying it.  I will admit that enjoyment of this show might be limited to the male population as my wife will not watch it with me.,1363219200,,197,4.051282051282051
2212918,5,B0007GP79G,Love Science. I remember the X Plane battle and loved seeing the inside information. Traveling to Mars was an incredible act of man. The twister science is very interesting. There is nothing like a robot doing a job for man as in the robot race.,1362960000,,245,4.466666666666667
2212919,5,B0007GP79G,"I appreciate NOVA's commitment to high quality programming. Not only is the photography of the highest quality, but the credentials of those interviewed lend credibility to their shows as well. I streamed it via my Amazon Prime onto my Kindle Fire HD and the sound and visuals were as good as watching it on a tv, I noticed no difference. I cannot get enough of NOVA.",1362096000,,367,4.575757575757576
2212920,5,B0007GP79G,"Congratulations to Amazon and PBS. These videos are simply amazing including how the content is presented, the animation, etc. They made an extraordinary job explaining such hard subject in a completely understandable way. CONGRATULATIONS!",1337385600,,239,6.0588235294117645
2212921,4,B0007GP79G,"This is as exciting as an unmanned space program can get. Two rovers on Mars, on opposite sides of the planet so that one is in daylight while the other is in darkness. The people in Mission Control in Houston personify these robots to the extent of talking about them being awake and asleep, of being ""out of his mind"" when one goes bad, and treat them like their babies. Which, after all, they are.

This was the mission that found unmistakable evidence that there used to be open water on Mars. The audience follows their fragments of evidence, their decisions to probe in a particular spot, use particular instruments, and so on. And these guys (and gals) are apparently quite accustomed to explaining what they are doing in ways that make sense to non-scientists.

They clearly love their work. They celebrate when things go right with hugs and pizza, and comfort one another when things go wrong. All together, it is a fascinating look into discovery, and convinces any reasonable person that we must plan on sending manned missions to Mars as soon as we can.",1336780800,,1065,4.689839572192513
2212922,5,B0007GP79G,"Great to view back-to-back with Mars: Dead or Alive.

I don't see why PBS charges so much for their Nova dvds-I'm not rich and can't afford their prices.  I got this used like the few other Novas I own...",1322611200,,204,4.205128205128205
2212923,5,B0007GP79G,"I have always held a fascination for Mars, as have many people. This is a great documentary to get your taste buds watered up for the Mars exploration. Despite being a science fiction writer, I am still blown away by the progress of technology and what they were able to do with the Mars rovers.

There were many trials and tribulations with the Mars mission, but they ended up with far more data than they thought that they would get. This documentary is by no means a complete resource but it is great to pop on and watch to peak your interest. If you are interested in more information, you will probably want to explore some other sources.",1271289600,,643,4.4491525423728815
2212924,4,B0007GP79G,"This episode provided a very in-depth look at something that I just recently came to find out about.  Recently a friend showed me a video of the F-35, which I thought was incredible.  Little did I know the struggle and competition that Boeing and Lockheed Martin had for the JSF program.",1267488000,,287,4.607843137254902
2212925,4,B0007GP79G,"NOVA: Welcome To Mars (2005)was a four star film by NOVA and is recommended for all fans of planetary science and NASA.  This film should be watched serially after watching Mars, Dead or Alive as it continues where that film leaves off providing excellent documentation of the mars rover missions once they ""landed"" and started their exploration of the Martian surface.

Welcome to Mars documents ""proof"" of the existance of free standing water on the early surface of Mars.  It also documents how scientists and engineers work together to change a dream into hardware and reality, while providing useful scientific and cost effective data.

My hat is off to this new generation of government workers at NASA and their great efforts to explore Mars and prepare the way for manned expeditions sometime in the future.",1238457600,,815,5.014814814814815
2212926,5,B0007GP79G,"I ordered this DVD for my grandson, who is nine and who is fascinated with space.  He studies the planets like most boys his age study baseball scores, and although he loves baseball, he loves the solar system more.  We had seen ""Roving Mars"" at the Omni Theatre, so when he won third place in his [...]ade science fair, I wanted to reward him with a copy of the ""Roving Mars"" DVD.  But alas, it was not out on DVD, so I had to settle on ""Nova.""  Not a bad settle, though.  This video gives the historical and scientific account of the mission that leads to the finale that is covered in ""Roving Mars.""  Designed for less scientific audiences, it is terrific for all ages.  Not only did we learn new information, but also we both enjoyed it immensely.  He has watched it several times since his first viewing, making it great bargain!

I still am waiting for ""Roving Mars,"" as I want to add that one to his collection as well.  Sure beats the heck out of anything Hollywood puts out!",1179187200,,983,4.351648351648351
2212927,3,B0007GP79G,"I liked the video because it contains real footage of the actual events that transpired when the rovers landed, but it's way too short and in too little depth.  If it had been longer, then maybe it would have been good.

For anyone who has followed the MER mission or watched the webcasts on NASA tv, there is way too little that is new in this DVD.  I recommend instead to read the Steve Squyres book, Roving Mars which is well written and details the MER project and the history leading up to this mission.",1167955200,7,508,4.326315789473684

8047525,1,B0007GP79G,"Hopelessly out of date.  Only useful if you want to know what NOVA was broadcasting 14 years ago, and that's ancient history.  Not only has technology changed - and duhh NOVA is mostly about technology - but since then the US killed binLaden, we are fighting a new enemy,ISIS, and Al Qaeda is moribund, the war the US began in Iraq has changed completely, now we are fighting a proxy war in Syria, Ukraine has split from Russia's sphere of influence and was invaded in an ongoing war etc, etc.  Basic science hasn't changed that much, but far from all NOVA episodes are about basic science.",1492387200,,590,4.547169811320755
