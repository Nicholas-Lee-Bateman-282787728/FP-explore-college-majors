3663796,4,B001K98MF0,"The appeal of this anime lies in the cute character designs and the dialogue. Not very much actually happens here. It's mainly just the characters sitting around and talking to each other. But their conversations and personalities make the show pretty funny. There is a character in this series that is obsessed with the Haruhi Suzumiya anime. I think that's kinda funny since the voice actor was the same as in that series too. There's not really much to tell about Lucky Star, but even if that's true it's still pretty cute and funny. You may like if you give it a shot.",1351728000,,572,4.563106796116505
3663797,5,B001K98MF0,"I liked this DVD, mostly cause of how much airtime Misao has. Lucky Star is sort of like Seinfeld but with teenage girls. Its a simple show about nothing, There's not a lot of plot, its just an enjoyable comedy. I bought this here because it was cheaper than at the store.",1349049600,,272,4.25
3663798,5,B001K98MF0,"When I bought this special edition set, I wasn't really expecting everything I got.  The whole thing came in a rather large box, with two versions of the art printed on either side.  In the box was the DVD case, a CD case, and a printed shirt which I will never wear because I'm heavy-set and a guy and it would only look awkward on me.  The art on the actual DVD case is different, featuring a very cartoon-ish Yui Narumi.

I have yet to actually watch the DVD, but I'm assuming it'll be of similar quality to the other DVDs.  Really, a great product.  There's just SO MUCH HERE.",1322697600,,580,4.2272727272727275
3663799,4,B001K98MF0,"It's really a great product. Very nice box art on all sides of the box (except the inside :P) and of all the CDs in the limited ed. Lucky Star DVD boxes, the one in this one is my favorite. My only problem with all the limited ed. boxes is that you only get printed shirts rather than the actual uniforms. I wouldn't mind if it was some cheap version of the real thing, but just a printed shirt is boring.

But all in all, even if it didn't even include the shirt, i wouldn't think twice about buying it. It is well worth the money as Lucky Star is such a great series :3",1247011200,6,571,3.965217391304348
8314384,5,B001K98MF0,"It's anime Seinfeld. Kagami is much like Jerry, Konata is Kramer, Tsukassa is George, and Miyuki is Elaine. This is one of the funniest and well written slice of life anime that is not afraid take jabs at just about everything otaku centric, even us die-hard Lucky Star fans. This is an anime you should not miss, buy it or else be left out (Seinfeld bass line)",1463356800,,361,4.402985074626866
8314385,5,B001K98MF0,"this is good for what it is it is the dvd and its package (unfortunately the t shirt, art box, and character song do not come with it)
(ive also included a picture of the back of the dvd and the side in my review because they don't have one)",1449360000,,241,3.84
8314386,5,B001K98MF0,i love it the besting it have 4 episode 17 18 19 20 funny (^o^)!!,1421020800,,65,3.4
8314387,5,B001K98MF0,"Great series, as for the format no problems and exactly what you'd expect of a DVD, No complaints = )",1402272000,,101,4.1
8314388,5,B001K98MF0,"I love this series, and I even got a t-shirt that came with it since its limited edition! It's great!",1390953600,,101,4.1
8314389,5,B001K98MF0,"really great series, so nice to be able to grab for a relatively low price (anime wise). you can get several of the dvds in this set for under 10 dollars.",1376179200,,154,4.0
8314390,5,B001K98MF0,"This is a great series over all. I couldn't be happier with this. The shirt that came with it is xl and I use it as a pajama shirt. Plus who could pass us a LE at this price. Now the 6th disk is kinda hard to find and ridiculously over prices on amazon ( $100, 160, and $1000 go look you will drop a brick)
You could just buy the collector box set $300-400 or the anime legend $100-300, but I didn't want to pay that much but forgot to buy the 6th when it was cheap so I had to get it from Y**T**e via f***tw**e.",1367193600,,512,3.75
8314391,5,B001K98MF0,This is one of my favorite sets of episodes. I really believe this show got stronger as it went along. The only reason to get this specific version is for the collectibles. Which you already know if they're worth it to you.,1364860800,,223,4.333333333333333
8314392,5,B001K98MF0,"I love it, the CD to the volumes to the shirt!!! I don't know why everyone is haten the shirts, I think there awesome, there so warm and big so I wear them as PJ. I also love the series because it just low key and cute. Its also a good break from other anime thats full of drama and action (not that I don't like those but if you watch them too much, you get kind of stressed but thats just my opinion) But this anime is really good, and the CD are so cool I love them. I imported them into my iPod so I listen to the all the time. So I would defiantly recommend this to people.",1358899200,2,578,3.7851239669421486
8314393,5,B001K98MF0,i love this and it is so funny and cute this will complete your anime and comedy series of Lucky Star,1358035200,,101,3.857142857142857
