4284467,2,B0047CG94S,While typical of the styles of many movies and TV shows of the 1960s era this series had an all too common theme aimed at intrigue with some extremely poor acting of a poorly written story!  The lead character is far from a James Bond and the actor far from a Sean Connery!  This one should have been lost to the ages where it was no doubt initially lost!,1383177600,,355,4.130434782608695
4284468,5,B0047CG94S,"The morally complex world of McGill is light-years ahead of 99% of its contemporary rivals in the 1960's, most obviously the James Bond films.  As in real life, in our imperfect world, even when you win, the victory is apt to be bittersweet.  McGill always gets his man - sometimes, even his woman - but the satisfaction of professional success is tinged with empathy for those whose secret sorrows are uncovered.
  I remember seeing this series in its original US run in 1968.  I never forgot it.  Richard Bradford was that good an actor; the scripts were that good a storyline.
  The series also provides a historical sense of  people's attitudes duirng the period - that is, the sense of being vulnerable in a nuclear age, of being unable to trust the government and institutions which ought to be trustworthy.",1366761600,2,813,4.75
4284469,4,B0047CG94S,"Responsible for a string hit shows in the mystery, espionage, and mystery genres, like The Avengers, The Saint, and Danger Man, Britain's ITC (Incorporated Television Company) Entertainment also produced Man In a Suitcase (1967-68) a series that lasted for just one season, producing 30 episodes featuring Richard Bradford as an ex-intelligence operative named McGill.  The series had been previously released as an import, but is now available in Region 1 DVD.  This release contains the first 15 episodes, and is accompanied by a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/second-set/dp/B005VB61HO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">second set</a>&nbsp;with the remaining 15 episodes.

In the first episode ""Man From the Dead"", it is learned that McGill (no first name stated) was an American agent who was disgraced about six years previously, and is regarded by some as a traitor.  McGill discovers that his reputation was sacrificed as part of a scheme to plant agents behind the iron curtain.  Rather than endanger those operatives, McGill chooses to remain in disgrace.  He makes his living doing investigative work, and other jobs that usually involve intrigue, and danger.  The title of the series comes from McGill's somewhat nomadic lifestyle, as he frequently travels from place to place carrying his worn tan suitcase.

McGill may travel light, and doesn't always go first class, but he is seldom in dire financial straits.  Even with a tarnished reputation in some circles, McGill seems to have no shortage of employment opportunities, and is sometimes selected to be the fall guy.  McGill is ruggedly handsome, but has some rough edges, and lacks the refinement and sophistication of a Simon Templar.  His prematurely graying hair makes him look older.  Because he has received a raw deal, McGill often has a huge chip on his shoulder, and his headstrongness seems to cloud his judgment at times.  He can be a fierce fighter, but still takes a number of beatings, and is also badly wounded on several occasions.  This may add an element of realism, but fortunately McGill appears to be a fast healer.

Operating as a lone wolf, and only occasionally employing high tech ""Bondlike"" gadgets, McGill is a tough operator who has a tendency to be stubborn, and doesn't always take the sensible course of action.  Similar to Danger Man, the series has as a dark cynical tone, with very little humor.  McGill was apparently originally conceived as more of a light hearted wiseguy, but Bradford preferred taking a more dark, low key approach, and also changed his lines without approval, which apparently didn't endear him to many in the writing and production staff.

The adventures are set in mostly European locations, and feature a lot of variety, from different types of crimes, to political intrigue, to international espionage.  The episodes are generally well written, and pretty lively.  For those acquainted with other ITC series from the era, the subject matter will seem quite familiar, as will many of the guest stars.  And become accustomed to the series' downbeat vibe, and McGill's at times sour attitude, the lack of happy endings won't be as much of an issue.  McGill may never be the most popular guy, but his determination and personal integrity are admirable.

Albert Elm's music and cues for the series, are very reminiscent of Edwin Astley's work on The Saint.  Image quality is quite good for a program over forty years old.  Unlike the import release which contained some substantial extras on each disc, this Acorn Media collection is a bit skimpy on extras.  In this reviewer's opinion, the writing in the series improves as the series progresses, and in general, the stories in the later 15 episodes are a bit stronger overall, than those in this set.  Given a choice, Set 2 would probably be the one for the casual fan to consider first.  For the really hardcore fan, the import release (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-in-a-Suitcase-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000PSP7JQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man in a Suitcase: The Complete Series</a>), with the additional bonus material, would be the one to look for.  Be advised that these episodes are not subtitled, and you will need a region free DVD player that plays DVD's in PAL format.

For those that enjoy ITC Productions' mystery and suspense programs, Man In A Suitcase is a series that is well worth your time.  Similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Baron/dp/B001NH4CEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Baron</a>&nbsp;(1965-66), ITC was hoping that an American in the lead role, would result in commercial success when broadcast in the USA, but unfortunately neither series garnered a substantial audience, and were cancelled.",1341705600,4,4829,5.493910690121786
4284470,4,B0047CG94S,"Highly enjoyable spy/detective series made in 1967/68, featuring Richard Bradford as John McGill, ex-CIA agent forced to resign and now freelances as a pricey, globetrotting private detective.

Another fine series from the ITC Television Network, responsible for shows like ""The Prisoner"" and ""Gideon's Way,"" this is a gritty, realistic and exciting set of episodes well-written with fast-moving plots and never short on action.

Bradford plays McGill with a degree of toughness and a laconic ease so well that he seems to be perfectly cast for the role. Trained at the NY Actor's Studio, Bradford was a Method actor and claimed Brando as his inspiration; in fact, Bradford had a supporting role with the Academy Award winning actor in the controversial film, ""The Chase"" (1966), directed by Arthur Penn. Supporting players, all fine character actors from ITC's stable, like Donald Houston, Angela Browne, and Judy Geeson, raise the bar of this rarely seen, but popular, detective series.

Compared to 'Danger Man's"" John Drake, McGill is the antihero--a man for hire, keen and distrustful of others, with an eye for the ladies, but a man not without scruples. Shot in color, the series is markedly violent and in the fisticuffs McGill often finds himself in, the blood flows freely. But there is more: the stories and assignments McGill takes on are interesting as they are unusual at times. The international locales also add a bit of flair in contrast to the typical ""Mannix"" episode that was limited to that metropolis called Los Angeles.

This is from the original Network DVD set that should be held up as a model of what all DVD sets should aspire to: pristine transfers from the original print (so clean they look as if they were shot yesterday), tons of extras including trailers, foreign titles, bumpers, behind-the-scene stills, a Richard Bradford interview (today, a mere shadow of the lean, handsome actor he was 40 years ago!), a full-color booklet, and more.

 Nonetheless, ""Man in a Suitcase"" is a tight and shut case to hours of viewing enjoyment. And if the incidental music in ""Man in a Suitcase"" seems awfully familiar to that of 'The Prisoner"" it should be--both were composed by Ron Grainer.",1301011200,7,2213,5.032786885245901
4284471,5,B0047CG94S,"Although this series does not quite have the staying power of other great British Spy shows of the 60's such as The Prisoner, The Saint, The Avengers, and my favorite Secret Agent Man, this program comes highly recommended nonetheless.  The outside photography in and around London is very good, and the star Richard Bradford is certainly a different kind of hero.  It is somewhat of a misnomer to say that he is trying to clear his name during the course of the series, because he knows he really can't do that.  Any attempt to clear his name would result in a double agent colleague of his being tortured or killed in the Soviet Union. He really is between a rock and a hardplace, which makes for interesting stories.  Also, he really doesn't live out of his suitcase, but he does carry it around with him from residence to residence.  I can't wait for the secound volume to be released to compelte the entire run of the series.",1299801600,5,930,4.544910179640719
4284472,4,B0047CG94S,"As a kid, I used to enjoy watching the British action series shown on American tv.  ""The Saint"" and ""Secret Agent"" are 2 of my all-time favorites.  I also clearly remember watching this series.  It was a summer-replacement series shown Friday nights on ABC.  Unlike ""The Saint,"" ""Secret Agent"" and ""The Avengers,"" it was only shown once and not brought back again.  I never expected to see this series again.
The series concerns an American secret agent bounced from the CIA for something he did not do.  He now travels around Europe as a roving private-eye.  (The series is sort of a great grandfather to the current ""Burn Notice,"" shown on the USA network.)  The main character with the tough-guy name of McGill is played by an American, Richard Bradford (who 21 years later would become more famous for his rough fight scene with Sean Connery in ""The Untouchables.)
Bradford, who seems to have been influenced by the Brando school of method acting and walks with the kind of ""I don't give a crap"" gait that Vic Morrow had on ""Combat,"" seems to smoke a cigarette in every scene, most of which he smokes down to the butt.
The thing I remember about this series is the cool theme music, which I have never forgotten and which I looked forward to hearing again.
The plots are, for the most part, interesting although many of the episodes end rather abruptly.  The show is in color and like the color of most 1960's tv series far nicer and preferable to me than the color today.  The disc quality is good.
As stated, I never expected to see this series again as it was not particularly successful and did not run long.  However I am happy that it has been released and have enjoyed making McGill's acquaintance again.",1297468800,16,1715,4.590163934426229
4284473,4,B0047CG94S,"Nobody gets stabbed, shot, beaten, tortured, garroted, kicked, punched, and double-crossed more times than McGill, the hero of ""Man in a Suitcase.""  An ex-CIA agent with a dirty past, McGill is kicked out of the CIA.  He ends up in England and Europe, out of work and in need of money.

McGill will take any job, no matter how dirty it is, as long as he gets paid.  This guy ain't Simon Pure.  Money is his motivation.  Wherever McGill goes he is a pariah.  Nobody wants him around.  Even his clients don't want him around.  They just want him to do his job and get lost.  He gets double-crossed by everyone, including his clients, and is punched senseless more times than he is able to smoke a cigarette.  In fact, in one scene he trades punches in a brutal fistfight while he is smoking a cigarette.  Somehow he manages to keep the cigarette in his mouth throughout the entire fight.

My favorite episode is the one called ""Mariocki.""  A lot of the episodes are forgettable.  Several of them are cut-and-dried.  Some very good actors appeared in this series, including Donald Sutherland.  American actor Richard Bradford is good as the sullen and explosive McGill, the man with a past.  He's a sixties TV antihero who seems much more contemporary than other TV spies of the sixties such as the heroes Napoleon Solo and Ilya Kuryakin in ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.""

""Man in a Suitcase"" isn't as good as ""Secret Agent Man,"" Patrick McGoohan's TV spy series in the sixties, but it's close.  Even the theme song of ""Man in a Suitcase"" is catchy.  And that old beat-up leather suitcase McGill carries with him wherever he goes.  Who can forget that?  It's a shame the series lasted only one season.

4284474,4,B0047CG94S,"A USA spy is sacrificed and labeled treasonous. He can't return to the states, thus sets himself up as a private eye in London. Clients are not friends, he has few. Constantly McGill is trapped into survival mode. His is a quick temper. McGill (Richard Bradford, ""The Untouchables"" police chief) is a character who suffers betrayal, mistrust and deceit. McGill's chases, or while being pursued, takes him all over London and Europe, but never allowed back home. Interestingly, the lead actor is American, intentionally cast to attract American TV, successfully through ABC. This DVD provides the first half of 30 episodes of this 1967-68 spy series. Each episode is a new confrontation, new guest stars, Bradford the only regular, in perhaps his first truly significant role, although he played alongside M.Brando in ""The Chase""-1966
...Many guest stars, including a look at Donald Sutherland BEFORE Hawkeye in MASH; ORDINARY PEOPLE; AND PRIDE & PREJUDICE-2005.
...Begin viewing with ep#7, Man from the Dead, as it explains the series plot. Ep#1, not as good, is lots of brainwashing, mental torture, and drugs to force a false confession. Overplayed?
...No subtitles, bonus is a photo gallery.

NOW, review 2: 5 STARS for late 1960's period spy suspense & drama. It's perfection because it was made as a contemporary-times story in the late 60's. If it were made today, as it is, today's standards would laugh at it. And I did too. It's like a National Lampoon Spoof version of espionage at times. The acting, sets, costumes, props, brought LOL fun. London was like America in 1967-68. Green naugahyde, 2-tone mauve dial phones, mini skirts, copper kitchenware, female hair-dos, Twist dancing, vehicles... historic perfection of the Cold War/Vietnam days.
...1960's TV period brought us Batman TV, Beverly Hillbillies, Gomer Pyle USMC, Dragnet, Mannix, Mission Impossible, and The Pink Panther film in '63. Like most of those shows, let's also include ""Get Smart""-65-67 and ""I Spy"", by today's suspense/action standards, the characters look comedic. Gestures are overplayed. A fist fight, ep#6, was not synchronized action to sound and the actor was actually dialogued ""wham, wham, wham!"" I laughed, expecting to see a colorful full-screen starburst with POW! inside, like on Batman. I remember the late 60s with university scholars jamming dorm lounges to see that show.
...So this show, like the others, was entertainment, a diversion from the daily posted news death count from the `war', injured protesters, assassinations, and drug abuse. Maybe it was intentionally made a bit unrealistic looking, compared to today's blood-gore in-your-face atrocity blockbuster filming.
Which was better?  :- ) or :- (  ?

So choose your review, 4 or 5 stars. Do you like modern action/adventure/suspense/intrigue; or would you care for a bit of a nostalgic view of what action/suspense was 40+ years ago? If you choose the latter then BUY, view, and expect some laughs along with the suspense. Expect typewriters, not computers. Expect obvious ketchup for blood. Enjoy entertainment-not thriller fright.

I hope this duel review will help you decide yea or nay on this nostalgic resurfacing of a British produced, ABC run, spy thriller-belly tickler. It's good for some, over-acted for others. Your choice.",1292198400,9,3298,5.262357414448669
