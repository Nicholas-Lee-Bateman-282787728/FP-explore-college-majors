1792407,5,B00006SFJM,"I finally saw this film after much waiting, and gladly, knowing almost nothing about what to expect.
Director Larry Fessenden will hopefully have many more films ahead of him. With Wendigo he has created the antithesis of the Hollywood film. By this, I don't mean nihilistic, amateurish, abstract, or any of the other qualities that, good or bad, are usually suggested by that concept. Well acted, beautifully photographed, with solid dialogue and even stronger visuals, Fessden has put his trust in the audience to take the lead and enter the path that he has pointed out to us.
He manages to maintain a very low key, deliberately paced atmosphere of discomfort. This is all the more distubing when broken by his startlingly visual bursts. He never cinches once and for all whether the supernatural elements are real or just images brought on by paranoia and fear (or even just symbolism on the part of the filmmaker). Because of this, any ""flaws"" in the creature effects are rendered moot. The ""realism"" of the effects simply don't come into play. They serve their purpose splendidly. Just enough to get the point across without having to serve a whole garnished platter repleat with apple-mouthed pig.
All of the performances seem almost underplayed. As a result, particularly with the family, we get a sense of reality in their relationships and situation. Very fly on the wall. There are many scenes that are almost mundane in their content, having little or nothing to do with the plot, but everything with giving us a feeling that we are watching real people.
The parents, played wonderfully by Patricia Clarkson and Jake Weber, are often seen in a manner that you would never see in Hollywood. Casually cursing in front of their child, having minor squables, revealing their everyperson flaws, in other words, behaving like real world parents. There is no sense that these people need to be role models or have any fear of being admonished by the audience. The completely divergent ways that they, in one scene, try to calm their son's (Erik Per Sullivan -- revealing intelligence well beyond his so convincingly vapid Dewey on Malcom in the Middle) sudden wave of sad feelings are so true to life. Dad's ""Boys against the girls"" comment rings with such truth of life. Marvelous stuff!
See this film. It is so unlike anything you will see come out of Hollywood and for all the right reasons. Larry Fessenden deserves a round of applause, not for making a perfect film (it isn't), but taking a chance to make a film the isn't way it supposedly ""has"" to be made, but instead is the way it NEEDS to be made.",1040083200,3,2612,4.793791574279379
1792408,2,B00006SFJM,"I want to start off by saying that I enjoy almost every horror/suspense/thriller movie ever made.  As soon as I heard about Wendigo, I was instantly pulled in.  I waited a year and a half for this DVD to come out, so I could finally see what all of the praise and commotion was about.  Well, the story line is somewhat simple.  Kim (Clarkson), George (Weber) and their eight-year old son, Miles (Sullivan), are city folk taking a weekend away at a friend's country farmhouse.  On the way to the country farmhouse, they hit a buck that jumps out in front of them. Well, it just so happens that a creepy hunter named Otis and his 2 friends were following/hunting this buck.  Otis clearly comes off as a psycho.  Otis is quick to blame Geroge for hitting the buck and cracking its antler, like Gerorge had any other choice.  Otis puts the buck out of its misery and continues to hassle Goerge on why he hit it. George explains that it was an accident that couldn't be avoided, but that's not a good enough reason as to what happened for Otis.  Otis soon becomes extremely annoying before returning to his creepy state.

This incident supposedly awakens the spirit of the Wendigo, which is an evil, flesh-eating, spirit that is half man and half animal. Then the movie begins to drag.  In fact the first hour doesn't really go anywhere.  There is no building of tension, or answers given to what's going on.  Onle a couple of creepy things happen in the first hour.  One is Otis peeking in on Miles parents having sex in the living room, and two, the visions that Miles has throughout the first hour.
Miles finds relief from all of the traumatic events that have taken place in the form of a chimerical monster he invents, based on the legend that the Indian spirit told him. The Wendigo is an elemental spirit that appears in various forms, taking the shape of wind, trees, or a hungry deer-man with sharp antlers that roams the wilderness. All we are told is that it can fly at you suddenly without warning.
The last half hour of the movie is where everything comes full circle, and the movie begins to pick up pace.  I don't want to give the ending away, but you do get to see the Wendigo or at least a couple forms of it.  I also want to say that the movie relied a lot on shaking.  Like in House on Haunted Hill(1999) when you see the doctor and he shakes violently.  The father does this, and the Wendigo is mostly about this.  In fact, most of the forest shots are jolted like this.
The best thing Fessenden pulls off in Wendigo is the amazing performance by Erik Per Sullivan (the youngest brother on Malcolm in the Middle).  Sullivan's face conveys so much while seeming to do so little.  You can see the fear in his eyes and even begin to understand where his character is coming from.  There is a lot of promise in this young actor.
Although this movie takes a different pace from others, it lacks something that is needed to pull the audience in and keep their attention.  Several people watching the movie got up and walked away because it was dragging so badly.  When they came back 30 minutes later, it was like they never left.  The story hadn't moved anywhere.  Wendigo reminds me of the Blair Witch because the first hour is just beating around the bush, except the Blair Witch is building tension with the characters finding clues and realizing that they are lost and being hunted.  In Wendigo, Miles is just seeing images.  Also, the conversations between the adults become very repetative.  I do have to say that for a low budget film, it was pretty good and that's why I gave it 2 stars.  Mainly just for the last half hour.  Though, Fessenden did his best with what he had to work with.
The ending leaves a lot to the imagination of the audience.  If that is what you are looking for, then this is your kind of movie. There are some big suprises in the ending, well, one in particular that I didn't see coming.  I would highly recommend watching Session 9 if you really want a dark, genuinely scary movie.  Session 9 really has that creepy, hide your face, I can't believe that just happened kind of mood.  It has to be one of the best horror movies of 2001 and I highly recommend the DVD.
As for the Wendigo DVD itself, it gets 4 stars in my book.  Well, the cover is interesting to say the least.  Special features on this disk include: 16:9 Widescreen Presentation, 5.1 Dolby Digital, 2.0 Dolby Surround, Searching for the Wendigo - Behind the Scenes Featurette, Director Commentary, Art Gallery, Trailer, Director and Cast Filmographies, Interview with Director Larry Fessenden, Subtitles: English and Spanish, Scene Selection, Digitally Mastered, and Interactive Menus.  The feature running time is approx. 92 minutes.  Rated R for a stong sex scene, language, and violent images.",1040083200,4,4804,4.5418604651162795
1792447,5,B00006SFJM,"This is one of the best films i have seen.
I always have believed in spirits, which are as diverse as humans are, and this tale shows us a glimpse into the otherworld/spirit world. The Wendigo, an angry, insatiable shapeshifter that is wonderfully portrayed here, is recognized by Miles, and ignored by the adults who are blinded by materialism, money and everday stress. We see the native elder's spirit here as well, giving warning about the angry spirit. ( I don't want to spoil the movie).

Anyways, it is a true gem. I could sense the spirit(s) throughout the film. Very well made, definitely get it.

I also recommend a film called The Last Winter. It is similar, and more about how we should respect the Earth. Try to get both films.

Two thumbs up!",1496880000,,756,4.5851851851851855
1792448,5,B00006SFJM,I really enjoyed this movie. It's dark and foreboding and mysterious. There is also an interesting dichotomy of the misunderstandings between people of different backgrounds.,1473465600,,174,6.0

1792450,4,B00006SFJM,"Before it unravels in an anticlimactic final act, Wendigo is a unique little folky chiller that is genuinely eerie and suspenseful, poetic and dreamy. The cast is strong and all do a fine job, the cinematography and score both haunting. The woods have served many a horror movie as a means of isolating its victims-to-be for easy disposal. But seldom has it been used so evocatively. And unlike many a low-budget indie, the main characters are fleshed out and believable, and by the time bad things start happening to them, we feel invested in them (therefore upping the tension quota). Some of it, in fact, is genuinely heartbreaking.

If the film cannot top it's first half in its second, and the fabled Wendigo is not nearly as frightening as its own legend, and the closing shot is an unintentionally comic misfire (the audience broke into laughter when I saw it in a theater), these hardly bring the average down so low that Wendigo is still not highly enjoyable and effective for most of the ride. I'd still strongly recommended it to anyone who likes eerie films of the ""campfire story"" ilk.

Anyway, I'd far rather watch an interesting film that is flawed, than a slick one with no poetry, no art, and no heart.",1446595200,2,1219,4.691588785046729

Patricia Clarkson and Jake Weber both give solid perfomances. The tension builds slowly and steadily. It's actually some really beautifully crafted film making. AND THEN...there comes a point when the whole thing just falls apart. I won't ruin it by saying when or how, but trust me, you'll know when it happens. It's almost as if it was filmed chronologically and the director suffered a brain injury partway through production. Amazing stuff!",1375142400,3,584,5.030927835051546
1792456,1,B00006SFJM,"I am a huge fan of the Wendigo myth and half way through it became obvious that this movie is nothing like the actual Wendigo in any way. I was disappointed but not enough to stop watching it. I should have however because absolutely nothing of memorable use came out of this experience except for how bad it was. It had terrible camera work, inexcusably bad effects and half assed dialogue throughout the entire thing.

I understand that the director wanted the fear to be like a child's perspective on life. The whole underlining tone being that we use myths to understand what we cannot comprehend. it's a good thought but when you make a movie about it you need to decide if you're going to have it be just a myth or creature not constantly switching back and forth with no explanation.

The movie is about a family going to the woods where (big surprise) backwoods hilljacks are who stalk them and shoot at their house and generally harass them. At one point a Wendigo is hinted at in a small shop by an Indian that only the young boy can see. His dad gets shot while sledding and goes to the hospital and the boy meanders for about 45 minutes.

I will not even Goodwill this movie because it would not be right to have someone else pay for it. I took it out of the machine and threw it in the trash. I bought this movie for 50 cents and I feel ripped off.",1358812800,,1361,4.287937743190661
1792487,5,B00006SFJM,"""Wendigo"" (2001) is a story about a couple from New York City who take a weekend trip to the Catskills in the middle of winter. A local hunter takes a disliking to the husband (Jake Weber) while the couple's son becomes increasingly concerned about their environment and a Native American legend -- the Wendigo, an angry spirit that can manifest as man, beast, tree or wind.

""Wendigo"" is not a conventional creature feature so if you're looking for a typical monster flick look elsewhere. The movie has a slow build-up filled with mundane drama, which some have criticized. Yet this is reminiscent of films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Birds-Collector-s-Edition/dp/0783240236/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Birds (Collector's Edition)</a>,"" where the main characters and a sense of realism are well established before things get going.

""Wendigo"" is a mood piece more than anything else. The mysteriousness of the lonely Catskill woods is evoked along with a sense of wonder and fear of the unknown. It's a vibe more akin to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mothman-Prophecies/dp/B0000648X0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mothman Prophecies</a>"" than ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ogre-Unrated/dp/B001L2ZSG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ogre (Unrated)</a>.""

Like ""The Mothman Prophecies"" ""Wendigo"" is somehow a pleasure just to watch (as long as you're not psyched-up for a monster-slasher flick). There's a quiet style and expertise to the filmmaking that smacks of professionalism.

Patricia Clarkson is effective as the wife/mother and little Erik Per Sullivan is excellent as the son, Miles.

Interestingly, none of the special effects were done with CGI, but rather cinematic techniques, costumes, make-up and creative editing. It works for me.

The film leaves the viewer somewhat scratching his/her head with its ambiguity. What conjured up the Wendigo? What's its purpose? How exactly does it ""devour"" people with its unquenchable hunger? Etc. Obviously if you like everything spelled out for you and don't like banging your head this is not the film for you.

The film was shot in the Catskills, NY, and runs 91 minutes.

GRADE: B+ or A-

POSSIBLE EXPLANATION (SPOILER - don't read further if you haven't seen the film)

Children are more sensitive to the spiritual realm because they haven't yet built up years of intellectual blockades along with social conditioning. It's clear that Miles senses malevolent creatures or spirits around him, which is why he and his mother check the closet and underneath the bed before he goes to sleep.

The Wendigo is a spirit and can only manifest in the physical realm through an agent who releases the spirit through BELIEF. The Wendigo souvenir plays a role in the Wendigo's manifestation because it was created by someone who BELIEVED in the Wendigo; it's in essence an article of worship and, in a sense, an idol. Hence, the Wendigo is attracted to the figure, which can inspire BELIEF in certain individuals, like Miles.

The ghostly Native American in the souvenir shop is obviously the Wendigo in human form. He's attracted to Miles because he senses belief and therefore guides the boy to the Wendigo figure and explains the ""legend."" He says, ""No one believes in spirits anymore,"" but after sharing the story of the Wendigo he asks the boy if he believes, to which Miles responds, ""I guess so."" This wasn't much, but it was all the Wendigo needed. The boy gets his mother to purchase the statue and thus the Wendigo is released into the physical realm to devour human prey.

The Wendigo is an evil spirit and therefore a liar. In Indian form he claims that such spirits are not ""bad"" just ""angry."" In other words, he makes excuses for his malevolent actions. Our prisons are full of people who do the same thing.

Once released, the Wendigo immediately inspires Otis to shoot the husband and, later, kill the cop. The Wendigo then goes after the very person he used, Otis, which shows that evil spirits will readily use you if you're willing and then lose you. Why didn't the Wendigo provoke someone else? Because evil spirits can only utilize those who are ALREADY given over to the dark side of their natures. The film shows that Otis was already an arrogant SOB and potential psycho. He doesn't go ""over the edge"" until AFTER the Wendigo is released.

If you're wondering why the Wendigo required belief to manifest in the physical realm, just think about it: It's the same way with God. The bible says that ""without faith it is impossible to please God."" Faith is the key that activates God on our behalf, answers prayer, heals and moves mountains. Why would we think it's any different with spirit beings who aren't benign? The difference is that when they are released through belief they cause havoc and destruction rather than blessing.",1352246400,13,4939,5.338481338481339
1792488,1,B00006SFJM,"With all due respect this movie is terrible. I just bought it yesterday for $7 at a nearby store. I bought this movie because it is about the myth of ""The Wendigo;"" an Algonquian (Native-American/Indigenous) myth that is somewhat similar to the european myth of the ""Vampire.""

Why are the myths similar?

To answer this we would first have to answer:
what is exactly a ""Wendigo""?

Wendigo is a myth about ""a malevolent cannibalistic creature into which humans can transform"" or which can also possess humans. Supposedly or according to myth, once a man tastes human flesh he will become a Wendigo; he will gain incredible power and strength and won't be able to stop his craving. It is a similar myth to that European myth of the Vampire. Vampires hunt for human blood to survive. It's practically another form of cannibalism.

So why do I feel the story of this movie is so terrible?

To answer this let's talk, a little, about the plot:

The movie starts with a family that goes into the countryside for a few days off. While driving on the road, they run over a deer and end up with their car stuck on the snow. They find some deer hunters and ask them for help. One of them hunters (Otis) is quite strange and scares the family a little.

It's not until 40 minutes later, into the movie, that you see the first reference of ""The Wendigo."" This happens as the family enters a store, in town, and the little kid in the family (Miles) becomes interested in a very small statue. An Algonquian man at the store tells Miles that the statue is about the Wendigo and tells the kid that Wendigo is a spirit that should be feared and whose hunger for flesh is never satisfied. 'Miles' and his mom 'Kim' both get interested in the little statue and buy it.

The words of the Algonquian man are repeated over and over again for about 3 times during the movie. With some bad eerie music on the background. Then, about 20 minutes later, at some point in the movie, George (the family man) and Miles (the kid) go sledding in the snow. George falls of the sled because of an unknown bullet that hits him. The family immediately suspects that it was Otis that shot George. And so they tell the sheriff of their suspicion.

The Sheriff visits Otis for questioning and things go wrong. It is not until near the end of the movie that you finally get an image of the Wendigo spirit. However the image you get is quite blurry.

What are the reasons for which I give it one star?
1. Because you have to wait 40 minutes to hear anything about a Wendigo.
2. Because the story of the movie could have been so much better.
3. Because there is no excuse for making blurry images; if the image was filmed in the year 2001.

If you're interested in Native-american horror myths like this one. Look elsewhere...

There was another movie I saw about this myth of ""the Wendigo."" The movie was titled: ""Ravenous,"" starring Guy Pearce. I think that movie was so much better...",1296864000,2,2946,4.455390334572491
1792489,2,B00006SFJM,"Larry Fesseden deserves credit for trying to be innovative, and for trying to utilize atmosphere over violence and special effects. But the key word is ""try,"" and my praise stops there.
Wendigo lacks tension and a sense of cohesion, key elements for achieving atmosphere, and making attempts at artistry vs. entertainment or shock work.
Visually, some shots are interesting, but the landscape really could have served the film better with more stationary or slow pan shots, rather than the jumpy style, which sadly seems to be the way of movies these days.

The acting is pretty decent, though there isn't much depth to the characters. The dialogue is predictable or heavy-handed, though the actors do a good job of making it sound natural despite these limitations. The whole crazy country boy thing is a bit tired now, and the whole spiel by the Native American ghost (or whatever) was laughable and ridiculous. That's where the film really starts to fall apart. Kim and George discuss displacement but laugh about it. The Wendigo is said to be an ""angry spirit,"" so it seems to be seeking vengeance....And yet that message seems to be lost/distorted in the portrayal of the embittered, violent hick and the totally caricatured use of Native American myth and imagery.

The myth of the Wendigo is a great concept for a film...but this does a poor job of utilizing it. Like Fesseden's ""The Last Winter,"" there is some ambiguity as to the reality of what the characters see. But like that film, a promising concept here falls short, and any sense of mystery is killed by the totally fake-looking (even by horror movie standards) manifestation of the Wendigo. Even if we are to see the Wendigo as simply in the minds of Miles and Otis, more subtlety in the visuals would have served this better. But even that would not have redeemed the already too-flawed movie.

I learned of this through a write-up in Fangoria a while back, and I was excited by the descriptions of both this and ""The Last Winter."" As I said, I see some promise in both these movies, which makes my disappointment all the stronger. I give him credit for trying to establish his own style and not relying on the typical violence/fx trend of post-90s horror, and hope that he goes on to make better movies. But for me, the highpoint of the movie was the sex scene, with Clarkson and Weber seeming to have some real chemistry. But for that to be the best part of the movie is telling.",1284163200,,2450,4.706293706293707
1792490,3,B00006SFJM,"Certain things can happen on perfectly-normal, ordinary days. You can be driving down the street, minding your own business, and hit a deer; you can go on a vacation and find yourself with a troublesome neighbor; and you can go sledding and find yourself in the most hellish situation of your life. It's a concept all-too-real, but all-too-frightening as well.

For George, his wife Kim, and their son Miles, life becomes all too real when they go up to the family cabin for a weekend outing.

WENDIGO, released in 2001 to moderately-uneven reviews, is a movie that focuses heavily on characterization and story. Thought not a bad thing, viewers shouldn't go into this movie expecting a whole lot in regards to the horor element. The film plays out more as an edge-of-your-seat thriller than an actual horror movie. As a reviewer, I see it as a dramatic thriller with some horror elements, not a horror film.

PROS:

- The actors. Each and every actor that played in this movie portrayed their characters extraordinarily well. Throughout the film, I had no complaints in regards to any of the characters. Their actions were realistic, their portrayals were accurate, and their motives were pure, if only due to human necessity. As a viewer, I like to connect with characters that seem like more than actors. WENDIGO is extremely character-driven, and because of that, it's important to have actors that feel like more than just people playing a character. You don't feel like you're seeing someone playing a character in this movie; you see someone LIVING this movie.

- The story. Though not as concentrated on the horror as the film makes itself out to be, the film presents itself as a well-thought-out family drama. The husband, avid photographer and troubled workaholic who doesn't know how to interact with his son; the wife, psychologist and worrysome mother; and the boy, curious, but not to the point where it might get him in trouble. These three characters save the film from being a total letdown. As its high point, the story does well with its portrayal of a family wanting to get away from life, but it also does well as a dramatic thriller in the latter half of the movie.

The biggest and only con (that doesn't contribute the need to be sectioned into a list) is the absence of the real wonder of the movie--the Wendigo. A creature of Native American legend that `eats as it gets hungry' and `is an angry spirit,' it's only briefly shown near the end, when the man who ultimately tears the family's life apart is murdered in an act of vengence. This brief encapsulation of this highly-interesting creature is the biggest letdown of the entire movie, thus is the reason why I, as a reviewer, can only give it three stars. Had I wanted to go into a complete family drama, I would have picked something from the drama department. I picked WENDIGO because I wanted to see a horror movie. I didn't get that, which really disappointed me as someone who wanted to see a movie that looked to be more than it really is.

As a film about a family ending up in a hellish situation, WENDIGO is the perfect film. As a horror film, it falls terribly short. The movie is only saved from being completely horrible due to its cast and incredible storytelling.

In the end, WENDIGO is worth a watch, if only for the story alone. Diehard horror fans should probably avoid this film, if only to spare themselves the disappointment of not seeing the creature they're most likely going in to see.",1265155200,,3492,4.703764320785598

It has nothing to do with the Algonquin legend of a cannibalistic were-creature. Funnier still is the depiction of the actual creature (see the special feature section). It was so bad, the movie has become a running joke between my wife and I:  ""Honey, they're making a sequel of your favorite movie...Wendigo.""  ""That X-men 3 really sucked we should had rented Wendigo again!"" ""Jeeper Creepers II wasn't near as scary as Wendigo."" You get my drift.

There are many small details that fill out the story. There is a scene at night when the boy is scared to pass by steps leading down to a dark place, and he jumps past them to minimize his exposure to whatever evils may be lurking down there...details like this remind me of the fear a child feels. He is a believable little boy, never seems like we are watching ""acting"". The parents are believable also. There are many moody shots of the forrest...that get a bit redundant and don't really lead anywhere. The ending is abrupt...and unsatisfying. When a story draws you in, you have a investment of time and concern for it. When the ending doesn't fill the emotional space it has created in your mind...it leaves you feeling frustrated and like you have been ripped off. The film is well shot and put togeather, I would just like to see a little more time on the script, concerning the ending, and also exploring/expanding the indian/spirit angle.",1223078400,3,1113,4.683673469387755

However.....I would not really class it as conventional ""horror"" but rather a tale of supernatural legend/lore if that makes any sense? A dear friend who is a production designer/artist was a guest at a special
screening of Phantasm in NY a couple years ago & Fessenden attended as he was screening a new film as well. My friend remarked to him that he & I really enjoyed Wendigo & how difficult it is to find new & innovative stuff, but we were a little put off by some of the creature shots that he chose to use in the film while there were shots in the special features that looked much better ,but other than that the film was pretty tight. Needless to say this did not go over well with the somewhat jaded director & he refused to reply? This is why I try to be a little careful because this comment closed the door on getting other interesting aspects regarding the film. All in all, the atmospere was great, shot entirely on location in rural upstate NY in the dead of winter & even without the  snow you feel the cold dark woods & trust me, the mood throughout the entire film is unsettling & creepy. It very effectively conveys gloom & despair, plus.... the acting is first rate & the Native American score is quite haunting so to me, this is a very well put together film that I would highly recomend to anybody thats into errie local legends & lore or just spooky stories in general.",1194825600,8,1850,4.486646884272997
1792495,3,B00006SFJM,"This creepy indie film has a family heading out to upstate New York to a friend's cabin to get a bit of a vacation.  On their way they hit a deer and earn the ire of a local named Otis.  Otis and friend had been tracking the deer for hours.  An antler was cracked by the accident making it worth much less.  Eventually they manage to leave the hunters behind and make it to the house.  The next day they go into town for some supplies and the boy meets a strange Native American who teaches him about the legend of the Wendigo.  While not scared at first by the legend, the fear generated by the incident with the hunters begins to plague the boy.

Later, the father is injured while sledding with the boy.  The boy gets scared and believes he is chased by the Wendigo.  He is found hours later by his mother.  Together they set out to find the father.  They find him and the boy has another run in with the Wendigo.  The action then moves to the hospital where the father receives treatment.  The boy sees the Indian again and the film ends.  Just stops.  That's it.

According to an interview with the writer/director there is no monster in the film.  He is trying to show how myths come about to help explain the world.  But that doesn't explain the mysterious Indian that no one else seems to see.  Most of the acting was pretty good although some of the hospital personnel were poorly portrayed (I especially didn't like the casual and cavalier way one staff member delivered some news and sauntered away).  When the film ended I felt a little gypped.  There were plot threads I wanted to know more about.  We have a main character who may be wounded or dead and we never find out either way.  There is so much more to the story and it is just not there.

Some of the special effects were quite good despite the small budget.  Some were really quite eerie and creepy.  I might have enjoyed the result a little better if I had not seen the interview but I would have still felt it just stopped instead of ending properly.  Some good points and some bad.  More like a promising first draft than a final.  Unfortunately there will be no final coming.  This is it.  My feelings are mixed about this one so you will have to make up your own mind as to the importance of the flaws.",1166054400,3,2280,4.28169014084507
1792516,5,B00006SFJM,This movie is a decent movie that focuses much more on suspense than just having people get killed every 2-3 minutes. The characters are well-developed so that viewers actually care about what happens to them as opposed to generic horror movies.,1157241600,5,245,5.0
1792517,4,B00006SFJM,"It's true that Wendigo is not exactly a horror movie. I'm not too sure wheter this was the intention or not but the movie delivered to me very much what I was wishing for when I did the rental. Basically, it's a sweet little family drama piece in which a couple and their kid is being confronted by a uncomfortable conflict with some locals. The family is a typical city sorta family that doesn't really behave better then the locals they meet right at the beginning of the film. Later they reach a friend's house they had rented for the weekend.

The plot early on focuses on the family conflict while the pictures give you the idea that there's something special about the deers in the forest. The excellent music and the well shot pictures give you an eerie feeling about them. Maybe not in a dangerous but rather mysterious way.

It's subtle for sure, definetly boring to some, but I was entertained by the believably performed family dynamics. The supernatural stuff is extremly rare and somewhere in the background most of the time. It pulled me in from the beginning to the end. The special effects are so-so but solid. They could have done without any at all to still support the subtle and comfortably haunting feeling of ""there's something out there"".

If you like a bit of family drama, good actors having interesting dialogues, a bit of indian mystery breeze, it's a recommondation.",1154476800,4,1394,4.681632653061224

1792521,3,B00006SFJM,"A dark psychological thriller which accesses more of an atmospheric sense of terror, rather than blatant displays of gore - very subtle, leaving the mind to 'fill in' some of the plot ideas - one derives a sense of 'something' haunting the woods, being itself part of the woods, the trees, the grass, the wind, the animals, the night itself. The wendigo is the spirit of vengeance in native american culture, invoked to address a wrong committed by the rotten, to set the natural balances straight.

A family travels through the backwoods when they become entrapped within a snowy ditch after having striuck a deer on the highway, and the only people around are a gaggle of hunting drunken rednecks who complain that the deer's antlers are broken, thus minimizing its prize value. The family eventually make it to their destination, but not after the presumptuous interference of the hicks, especially ""Otis"" now and again, who also happens to be a peeping Tom. The new house seems haunted, with its bloody memories appearing to the perceptive son, in somewhat of a ""sixth sense"" manner.

They take a quick trip into town to survey the local neighborhood, and come across a store selling rather odd little items, when the boy is confronted by a native american stranger who relates to him the legend of 'the wendigo', and bestows him a veritable talisman resembling a deer-like 'Pan' figure - the stranger disappears as mysteriously as he appeared, like the wind, yet the story of the wendigo haunts the boy, who begins sensing its presence throughout the environment, which begins increasing exponentially as the nights go on - a feeling of impending doom looms heavy in the air.

So he and pop go sledding, but things go horribly awry, as dad is knocked off therefrom and lays in a bloody heap in the snow. After a few hours of unconsciousness, he is taken to the hospital, and much is revealed in the climax of the film, as the wendigo lurks in the darkness of the forest, taking an anthropomorphic form as well, and justice is served in a delightfully ironic twist at the end.

This is probably not a film for those with a short attention span, accustomed to exaggerrated stuntman exploits, profuse gore, or fight movies, as again, the plot is subtle, and many wonderful effects are used to accentuate the pleasant eeriness felt here. To truly appreciate the film, one must immerse oneself completely within it. An understanding of metaphor and poetic justice is elemental. Afterward viewing this film, take a brisk walk out into the night - it certainly makes one's Nocturnal Consitutional that much more intriguing...",1121385600,2,2623,4.861297539149888

1792523,1,B00006SFJM,"For the first 10 minutes of the film, I thought, this is going to be cool- grainy, no big budget CGI to ruin a nice story line, little kids (always make for a creepy time unless your the one gloved wonder), incoherent redneck, city folk in the country, etc.
20 minutes later, I thought, ok, this is an indie, so it's going for the depth and camera work that will probably make sense soon then it's going for the jugular.
35 minutes later, I had to go to the bathroom.
40 minues later, I was beginning to think that maybe this wasn't a horror film but a bad sequel to Deliverance or Redneckville's gift to cinema: Bambi vs NASCAR.
An hour later, I got scared. I realized I was wasting my time and I would never get it back- still I had invested too much time to just stop watching it.
When it was all said and done, there was a hood ornament chasing a redneck while a kid lay on a bed holding what was NOT a Transformer, but more than meets the eye, that was given to him by a Native American that was more than likely a Poltergeist- those prankster ghosts always trying to get some to shoplift (Next time you're caught trying to walk out with something say- 'My native American brethern gave it to me' and see if they give you a bargain)! All the while, in the background auditions, were being held for Patient 874 in an upcomming episode of ER. Let us not forget about the poor cop in dire need of Rid who was left outside a trailer like a poor Watchtower pusher on Christmas eve. Then there's the boots. I don't want to spoil the ending- but, oh those scary Nancy Sinatras weren't made for walking, were they?
I love horror movies. I love indie horror movies the best because they are character driven and rely more on 'what you can't see' to creep you out. This movie is about as incoherent and dumb as my review. There's nothing scary about this film and the plot is shotty at best. I will say the acting is a bit better than Matress Mac selling Gallery Furniture or Bitsy selling a 4x4 in Dixie Country. Also, it does a decent job of providing about 1 minute worth of creepiness. This is mainly achieved through ticking clocks and blood dripping from this hanging string-- I know, I know- BOO!
However, the camera angles (that have received much praise in
several reviews) are silly: Family Scene- then cut to snow, trees, branches- family scene- cut to a totem pole and a dead deer- back to snow back to braches- now throw glitter into the wind! My favorite of the worst was when tree branches were tied to a camera and someone ran with it through the woods. WOW! Ohh. Creepy. Branches brushing up against branches. Yeah, whatever! This sort of stuff kind of worked in The Blair Witch, but is done so poorly on this film that it's funny.
The angles and camera work is not thought out at all- there is no artistic value in them. It's like someone said, ""quick, we've got 25 minutes of film we have to use, record different parts of the woods!"" Then, they used those parts to put into the movie to make arthouse wannabees think they were watching something with depth and value when in actuallity they were probably added to make this movie a Full Length Feature instead of a Short Film.
This could have been a decent to good film if it was done differently, say with some supernatural spooks. You want something creepy and artistic and GOOD???- watch The Devil's Backbone- superb film!
I give Wendigo 1.25 stars and I am being kind. I would have given it 1, but I thought the make out scene was kind of sexy.",1112832000,3,3513,4.3567073170731705

We find out all sorts of things about the family dynamic of the characters, but then in the end, what difference does it make? I was expecting some big confrontation with the Wendigo, but it appears that it was mostly in the little boy's head and the real evil were those stereotyped rednecks. (Surprise, surprise!) It's hard for me to get excited about a movie that has about five things happen in the whole of it, and then ends so unsatisfyingly.

Through most of the movie, I thought it looked like a student film which showed off a lot of new tricks the director learned (the fast, jerky motions; the 360-degree spin-around; the superimposed images that I assume are supposed to be creepy) but when it comes down to content, the movie just doesn't deliver.

I typically loathe digital editing effects - I still prefer to use Avid - but I was rather impressed with Fessenden's use of this technology.

He's a father who loves his son, and cares for his wife. He obviously pays more attention to the son, distractingly played by Malcom in the Middle's Erik Per Sullivan. The mother/wife, Patricia Clarkson, doesn't play a huge role in the movie, rather boring.

1792534,1,B00006SFJM,"First off, Wendigo has to be one of the most terrible movies I have ever seen. In a way, Wendigo is a scary movie, but only because it is frightening that such an awful movie could ever find its way to a producer. Oh God, there are just so many things wrong with this movie...
Now, I can tolerate a cheesy movie if the directing is good. And sometimes I can tolerate a bad storyline too, given the directing is good. However, Wendigo has a lame storyline and even worse direction. The director of Windego tries some interesting effects, but they just seem so out of place and confusing, that instead of thinking ""Wow, that was nice"", you are left with a gaping mouth wondering what just happened. The director doesn't seem to have any apparent ""style"" in this movie, that is, unless chaos and utter confusion is considered a style.
The ""monster"" in Wendigo, when first shown (not until the last 20 minutes) was deer-shaped monster made of sticks. The second time it appeared, it was a half-man half-deer monster which was nothing more than a bodybuilder with a deer outfit on and wearing alien-hand gloves. I have seen movies made in the 60's with more believable beasts. In fact, the monster looks so terrible, that it is only shown in brief clips, moving VERY quickly and jittery so you can't tell how bad it looks.... too bad even this effect doesn't work.
Where do I go from here? Bad storyline. Mediocre acting. A disgrace to the legend of Wendigo. Tie all this in with one of the worst endings I have ever seen and the question you are left asking is.... why watch this movie? It's not even good enough for a rental to laugh at.

The story borrows a little too heavily from King's ""The Shining"".  The boy(Erik Per Sullivan, in a very good performance) encounters people who don't exist in the material world and has premonitions of the horrors to come.
When we finally do see the Wendigo, the f/x are disappointingly primitive.  I know this film didn't have the biggest budget, but I've seen school plays with more convincing special effects.
I gave this film 3 stars.  The acting was slightly above average and the plot had a ton of potential.  As it stands, ""Wendigo"" is watchable and better than a lot of the junk horror movie of late.  But it could have(and should have) been a real gem.",1081123200,2,874,4.717105263157895

As many other reviewers have pointed out, the atmosphere was really eerie.  I thought the director (Larry Fessenden) did a great job in setting the mood and directing his cast.  Other reviewers seem to disagree, but I though it was well acted.  Problem is though, it was almost as if Fessenden knew that the special FX were going to be lousy.  It seems to me like he tried to cover this up by dragging out the opening sequences and limiting the ammount of time that the Wendigo is on the screen to the bare minimum.
This really ended up hurting his final product.  I wound up feeling like the movie turned out to be no better then a ""pretty good"" X-Files episode.  Simply put, it took too long to get started and then ended too quickly.
Bottom line is, if you can catch it on cable or rent it at a reasonable rate, it's not at all a waste of your time.  However, I honestly just couldn't justify spending the money to buy a copy",1076716800,6,1095,4.205741626794258

Whether this be true or not is entirely dependant upon the individual viewer, but mark my words: this is not just simply a failed monster movie.  that much is NOT dependant upon the individual viewer, but rather upon the individual viewers reasoning capabilities and maturity level.",1074470400,3,1082,4.6878306878306875
1792553,2,B00006SFJM,"The director of "" Wendigo,"" Larry Fessenden, claims in a short interview on the DVD that he first learned of this supernatural monster from a teacher during his days in elementary school. Intrigued by the idea, and apparently inspired by it as well, Fessenden decided to direct a film utilizing the eerie idea of a half man, half beast creature roaming through the snow covered forests of the Catskills. The director is seemingly unaware that the Wendigo was arguably one of Algernon Blackwood's most effective spook stories. This British author set his tale in the wilds of Canada towards the end of the nineteenth century where a hunting expedition undergoes a horrific encounter with the bloodthirsty Indian legend. The yarn is creepy to the nth degree, one of the best horror stories I have ever read. Sadly, Fessenden's take on the Wendigo legend fails to live up to the high standards set by author Blackwood. What a shame, too, because a movie incorporating even a tenth of the atmosphere found in the written version would have been a worthy endeavor indeed. Oh well, cinematic adaptations of H.P. Lovecraft stories rarely entertain either. Perhaps someday someone will do justice to the Wendigo legend--oh, I forgot! Someone did accomplish just such a feat. Its called ""Ravenous.""
""Wendigo,"" Fessenden's version anyway, introduces us to Kim, George, and their son Miles. This is a family with problems, but we do not learn about them until well into the movie. We first see this big city trio driving into the Catskills in order to spend some time at the country house of a family friend. Both parents have stressful jobs: Kim is a psychiatrist and George is some sort of graphic artist. The son has his own problems, mainly a tentative relationship with his ""too busy to spend time with him"" father. The trip, therefore, will provide a chance for the family to reconnect. Problems emerge almost immediately when the car hits a deer on the road a few miles away from their destination. It soon becomes apparent that some local hunters were tracking the animal up until the time George mashed it to bits. The hunters are understandably upset about this unfortunate incident, especially Otis, one of the more obnoxious members of the group. George and Otis get into it over the dead animal, as does Kim when she screams and shouts about these guys having guns so close to her precious little son. Despite the hard feelings, the locals help pull George's car, which went into the ditch due to the deer, up onto the road.
The weirdness continues once the three reach the house. Otis cruises by on the road near the house, glancing ominously up at the building before roaring off. An even more sinister incident happens when George and Kim notice someone fired a bullet through the window. It is clear Otis has a problem with these outsiders, a problem soon exacerbated by the bickering between Kim and George about their son and the father's inability to step back from his career. Still, the movie soldiers onward. A trip into town results in a peculiar encounter between Miles and a local Indian who tells the boy about the Wendigo legend and then gives him a figurine of the beast. Funny thing is, nobody knows anything about an old Indian in town. It seems that Miles experienced a supernatural incident. Meanwhile, more bullet holes in the house have just about worked Kim's last nerve to a frazzle. The police arrive on the scene too late to prevent a genuine tragedy from taking place. The movie concludes with a weeping Kim and a shocked Miles wondering just went wrong. Not surprisingly, the look on my face probably resembled Miles's visage to some extent, as I too wondered what had just taken place.
Deviating significantly from Algernon Blackwood's story constitutes the gravest error of Fessenden's ""Wendigo."" I would have preferred a shot by shot version of the story than yet another movie about a family in crisis expressed against the backdrop of a supernatural event. So what if Kim and George have numerous problems? What else is new? Everybody has difficulties within the family. The emphasis on a dysfunctional family might have been enough to save the movie if the characters were interesting. They are not: Kim is shrill and nagging, Miles distant and uncommunicative, and the problems I had with George are too numerous to list here. Suffice it to say he is a massive jerk with a bad haircut. When he and his wife started in on the hunters, my sympathies went to the locals. Here's an abrasive pair of big city know it alls trying to tell people what to do. They should have left them in the ditch. The good points of the film, namely the beautiful Clarkson, the occasionally oppressive mood, an interesting soundtrack, and a bit of violence are not enough to make this a film worthwhile. In fact, ""Wendigo"" reminded me of another indie clunker I saw recently called ""Kaaterskill Falls."" This is not a good thing.
The Wendigo does make an appearance towards the end of the film, but it is a slightly cheesy effect tricked up with fast camera cuts to hide the inherent flaws of the monster. Extras on the DVD include an interview with Fessenden, a commentary, a behind the scenes feature, and storyboards. The movie's picture quality is excellent, for what that is worth, but since the movie tanks I think you would be better off spending your hard earned coin on something else. Art snobs might love a movie like this; heck, even I like cerebral pictures like this one on occasion, but not on this outing.",1074384000,10,5535,4.784743991640544
1792554,1,B00006SFJM,"As I journey through the sea of cheesy yet humorous B movies I'm always in search of that one movie that will stick out from all the rest and will thus have the honor of being labeled as the worst movie known to man.  Though movies such as Back From Hell, Werewolf, and Zombie Lake have all come close to claiming this prestegious title, I would have to say that Wendigo not only surpasses them all, but also has the capabilites of forming a newer, more boring class of B movies known as C Movies as well.
The hue of the film and the way in which camera angles are used in this movie borrows heavily from the theatrical blunder - The Blair Witch Project.  The story centers on a family who just so happen to be moving to an isolated cabin in upper NY or Connecticut and not only run into a conflict with hunters after hitting a deer, (which surprisingly leaves absolutely no damage to the car save a streak of fake blood), but also the mysterious legend of the Wendigo.  In its entirety, the Wendigo is only seen at the very end and its image is so obscured that you'd think the film was damaged.  The other 89 minutes of the movie mainly focus on the child's mental struggle with the surreal and the natural, as is depicted ONLY by: swirling camera visions of a somber forest, sullen shots of the boy's face, and an unforgettable array of melodramatic music.  The movie is hardly worth anyone's time as I found myself falling asleep about 30 minutes before its ""climactic ending"".
There is a wide array of errors that attribute to this movie's putridity, but if I were to pick out one particular element that made the movie horrible, I'd have to say it'd be the sound.  In nearly every word spoken by any actor save the indian, the sound of their voices come out muffled.  I suppose had I been able to actually hear what the people were saying throughout this movie I would've been able to excuse a few of its flaws, however it just goes to show what you'll normally get when you watch low-budget films.  Yet another shocking fact that disgusted me was finding out the movie was made in 2001.  It looks as if it were made in 1981 which is something I personally find highly inexcusable in a film.  Add to that the movie's dullness and lack of practically anything save a few random shots of schizophrenic hunters and of the child's sullen countenance, and you've got Wendigo.
All in all, this movie is probably the worst piece of trash that I've ever seen.  The movie had no plot whatsoever as the elements failed to tie together, sound that had me thinking my audio adjustments were off, about 75 minutes of pointless events, and the worst acting I've ever seen in ANY movie.  If for any reason you want to watch this, I highly recommend that you watch it on Cinemax or Showtime because you will hate yourself for spending the $5 at Blockbuster and even more so for the ridiculous price that Amazon.com offers.",1074124800,8,2912,4.442776735459662
1792555,5,B00006SFJM,"Indie auteur Larry Fessenden's horror film WENDIGO is an intelligent and bone-chilling psychological sojourn to a nebular domain where Native American myth and reality converge.  It tells the story of an urban couple and their son Miles who, during a winter getaway to rural upstate New York, inadvertently provoke a prolonged fracas with an unbalanced local resident.  In the midst of the feuding, young Miles learns to cope with his ensuing anxieties and fears by placing his faith in The Wendigo, a wrathful spirit he has learned about from a mysterious Native American shaman.  But is the ancient spirit real, or is the boy's faith naively misplaced?

Though produced on a meager budget, WENDIGO offers top-notch writing and direction from Fessenden; excellent cinematography, despite the 16mm-to-35mm blow-up technique used; outstanding acting, especially from the three principals; and simple but very effective special FX that should put more than a few big-budget Hollywood productions to shame.  The beautiful musical score, by composer Michelle Dibucci (1982's CREEPSHOW), is just this side of New Age stylistically, yet it is flavored with enough Native American elements that it cleverly echoes the film's dichotomous cultural subtext, while at the same time being ethereal enough to complement the spooky and otherworldly atmosphere required by the basic plot.

WENDIGO serves up a subtle and tasteful nerve-tingling horror that is a refreshing alternative to the gore-laden horror movies that Hollywood often cranks out these days.  And like a lot of great art, this film requires that the observer exercise the ol' gray matter a little.  The younger crowd, therefore, will probably feel WENDIGO is too slow and lacking in blood-and-guts FX, but an audience with more mature tastes will really enjoy it.

The DVD offers an crisp, clean digital transfer with good sound, as well as some interesting extras such as a behind-the-scenes featurette and a feature commentary from WENDIGO's creative and somewhat eccentric director.  Well worth the reasonable cost of admission!",1074038400,4,2085,5.407407407407407
1792566,4,B00006SFJM,"Wendigo (Larry Fessenden, 2001)
Larry Fessenden gave the world his first entry into the hip, not-scary horror genre a few years back with Habit, an utterly engrossing vampire flick that's not as much about vampires as it is about its main character's slow descent into alcoholic madness. Well, Fessenden is back with his second foray into the genre, Wendigo, and we get the same treatment here we got in Habit. In other words, if you hated that one, don't bother with this one.
Wendigo isn't a horror movie as such. It's more a family drama (not as in ""appropriate for the whole family,"" mind you). George (American Gothic's Jake Weber) and his wife Kim (the highly underrated Patricia Clarkson, recently in The Station Agent) have borrowed a country house for the weekend from a business associate, and headed up with their son, Miles (Erik Per Sullivan, Malcolm in the Middle's Dewey). What at first seems to be a regular weekend family trip opens up into the beginnings of an attempt at a journey to heal an unspecified fracture in George and Kim's relationship; we learn this, but we're never sure what the specific event was. We find out why; George is self-obsessed and stubborn, Kim is distant and unable to understand why her nagging George about his self-obsession and stubbornness won't change him. But the two have been married a while, and they have that dynamic about them. (Which is good, because any chance to see Patricia Clarkson unclothed should be eagerly snatched by the oversexed male film viewer.)
The weekend is marred by an event on the way to the cabin, given to us in the opening scenes of the movie; George loses control of the car and hits a deer which is being pursued by a number of hunters, led by Otis (John Speredakos, recently in Rules of Engagement). Otis is not a nice guy, not at all. He seems perennially hopped up on something, is twitchy, nervous, and a little too fond of his rifle. Adding Otis into the equation makes things that much harder on the family. After all, once Otis is part of the equation, he's going all the way through to the solution.
(The Wendigo itself, though it does play a part in the film, is a minor character at best, and is, perhaps, only a mass hallucination.)
Again, as with Habit, what you see is not necessarily what you get. Those expecting a horror film are going to be disappointed; those expecting a heartfelt tear-jerker are unlikely to get that, either. It moves too slowly to be a thriller (which is probably the closest established genre to what Wendigo really is), but too quickly to be a slice-of-life film. In other words, it's uncategorizable.
And perhaps that is why Wendigo is one of those films that will stay with you long after you've finished watching it. Everyone in the film portrays their characters wonderfully, and all the tension between the family members is believable. Otis is very much the backwoods dangerous redneck, and unlike most rednecks of recent years, something about him seems uncompromisingly dirty; the kind of detail one only expects to find in Lucio Fulci films, but that Fessenden never fails to do well (even in front of the camera, a la Session 9). Otis may be one of the most disturbing characters in modern film, on a visceral level; there's nothing that makes you sit up and say ""whoa!,"" just a vague feeling of unease whenever he's onscreen.
Wonderful stuff. Not for everyone, but the few will adore it. ****",1074038400,4,3428,4.715
1792567,1,B00006SFJM,"Apart from a really good child actor who walks circles around the rest of the cast, it is very dull apart from the opening ten minutes and after that just goes downhill in a very amateur way. Normally horror film makers on low-budgets do wonders but Wendigo is really very boring and nothing much happens in it at all. The acting is quite realistic though and that is why it gets one star but the movie itself is poorly constructed and very confusing at the best of times.
The story is about a family that move to a cabin only to be stalked by a hunter who has a grudge against them. There is a supernatural subplot that does not really show up until the final few minutes. In fact it is not really a horror movie at all and this is why it fails. The trailer and DVD box do little for it in that respect. If these guys are out to make a horror film then MAKE a horror film and not something that pretends to be a horror film and is in fact a boring ""drama"" about a family where nothing happens. If the DVD cover had a family sitting around an open fire in a log cabin with some guy standing outside with a gun.. well that would be more apt.. but lets face it - it would not sell that way and so they have boxed it up as a screaming horror film instead. In short, the distributors are cheating everyone here. Wendigo is a very bad marketing gimmick that wasted people's money. The film makers should be shammed.

1792568,3,B00006SFJM,"Eric Per Sullivan as the young Miles is a wonderful performance for a child actor.  He portrays a young boy who finds himself enthralled by the legend of the Wendigo, an Indian folk legend that becomes horrifying real for him and his dysfunctional parents.  Larry Fessenden's film is a slow moving one and even when it picks up it's almost in slow motion.  There are, however, some truly eerie and ghostly scenes that merit it as a ""horror"" film, but as some reviewers noted, this is not a true representation of this film.  There is much mysticism and there is a dense portrayal of a family in hurt trying to heal the wounds.  Jake Weber and Patricia Clarkson are very effective as Miles' parents, but John Speradakos as the soon to be demented Otis is excellent in conveying evil in a soft, frightening manner.  The locale is beautiful in its winter isolation; some of the cinematography is also brilliant.  A disturbing film that leaves much to the viewer's interpretation, but definitely a different movie, well done on a shoestring budget.",1071878400,,1044,4.766666666666667
1792569,4,B00006SFJM,"'Wendigo' really is the sort of movie that you'll either love or hate. Wrongly classed by most as a horror movie, I had to watch it twice in order to fully appreciate it (I'm very glad I did), and, after reading this review, I hope you'll have a better understanding of why it's such a misunderstood film.
A brief synopsis of the plot: Kim, George and their son Miles are taking a vacation in the Catskills, at the holiday home of a friend. Before they ever reach their destination, a collison with a deer and a nasty exchange between some hunters spoils their vacation, and things go from bad to worse as they are plagued by an angry local and the spirit of a Native American God, the Wendigo.
Firstly, and most importantly, this is not a horror movie in the strictest sense of the word. It does have a supernatural baddie, but the real tension and atmosphere of 'Wendigo' comes from the beautifully-executed scenes of human conflict. John Speredakos is outstanding as the malevolent Otis, and turns in a performance as realistic as it is genuinely unnerving. The direction, too, is superior, with the hitherto relatively-unknown Larry Fessenden making excellent use of shocking rural North American-imagery and enigmatic Native American folklore to create a sense of the supernatural.
'Wendigo' is a strange cross between psychological and supernatural horrors - picture 'The Silence of the Lambs' crossed with 'Anaconda' and you'll get the general idea. Although the titular 'Wendigo' does appear in the movie, he's merely secondary to the brilliantly realised tension between Otis and George. It's odd that such a contrast exists, the movie wouldn't actually make sense without a Demon, even though the human scenes are far superior. I don't know why, but it just works. The special effects for the demon are shoddy, but this is remedied greatly by Fessenden's heavy-handed use of unstructured camera work. A special mention, too, must go to Erik Per Sullivan as Miles - an excellent child actor playing his part with endearing realism.
All in all, 'Wendigo' should be watched without any preconcieved ideas as to what a horror movie ought to be. It's a rewarding, surprisingly good offering and if you can put your previous experiences of horror aside, it's one of the best offerings of recent years.",1070409600,7,2305,4.943298969072165

But things turn messy when their car hits a deer & is run off the road. Looking for help they come across a couple of nasty rednecks out a-huntin' in the woods; and they're none too happy that a dad-burn city slicker done run over their dinner!
As if this isn't bad enough the impact of the crash has left the deer with a busted antler- never mind that the animal is DEAD already. One of the rednecks, Otis; doesn't like this either. Nosiree Bob. He can't have the stag's head hanging over his mantle with one antler when his buddies come round to his shack for moonshine & a rousing game of long- distance tobaccer juice spittin'! Ptooey!
So the MacLaren family aren't exactly in these folks good books, so their relaxing getaway hasn't got off on the right foot: and it doesn't help that they're holidaying in a scungy one horse hick town (the NZ equivalents would be either Dargaville or Pounawea- the alimentary canal of Godzone).
However later while out shopping with his mother, Miles discovers a gift shop where an unusual item takes his fancy- a statue of a Wendigo, a shape shifting Indian spirit. An elderly Indian man in the shop gives it to Miles as a gift, but when he takes it up to the counter, he discovers that he has to pay for it. The old man has mysteriously disappeared, & the clerk at the counter has never seen nor heard of him (Twilight Zone music).
But of course this is no ordinary statue. Obviously when you're dealing a Native American guy who talks the usual spiritual mumbo-jumbo littered with similies & no apostrophes, you know these people are in for bad luck.

Written and Directed by Larry Fossenden, WENDIGO is above average of its type & most of the horror in the film is wisely implied until near the end. When you actually get to see the ""Wendigo"" itself, it looks so cheesy that it was actually a very wise decision on the film maker's part to leave its appearance to the viewers imagination.

1792576,4,B00006SFJM,"I thoroughly enjoyed this original and intelligently made film, but I think that in order to do so, you really have to leave your pre-conceptions at the video shop door. If you pick a film wanting it to be something, then you're gonna be annoyed when it's not. My advice on Wendigo is just to watch it. Don't expect it to be anything, no matter what anyone says. Not deliverance, not a monster movie, not the blair witch, not Halloween. Give yourself some credit - you can watch something new and unique can't you? The story follows a young couple and their son on a weekend away up in the snow covered countryside. They have a run in with some local hunters on their way to the house, and as the weekend unfolds the young boy becomes aware of the Wendigo - a powerful spirit of Indian legend. Gradually the young family, the hunters, and the legend all become entangled as the film reaches it's conclusion. The performances are great, and the script is full of realism, purpose and pace. The dream sequences and visuals are extremely creepy, and atmospheric. The fact that a lot of people seem to think that this is a monster movie about a Deer-man is absolutely hysterical!! The Wendigo is an ancient spirit, one that takes on many forms (which incidently it does in the film). Just think about why it takes on the forms that it does, and then maybe you will draw your conclusions as to the spirit's intentions. And this for me was the real driving force and mystery behind the film. The Wendigo's purpose depends entirely on you. Maybe it is the unseen force that guards and provides the purpose in life. Maybe it's the keeper of the balance amongst all living things. Maybe it's just a big old tree that scares little kids. What you bring to this movie will ultimately determine what you'll take from it. Just don't dismiss it, open your mind and enjoy it.",1053043200,8,1860,4.5222551928783385
1792577,1,B00006SFJM,"You're in the video store, looking for a decent, spooky, atmospheric DVD---and you see Wendigo, and hey, it has all the right elements:
*A young and vulnerable family isolated in a country farmhouse in the Connecticut woods.
*Whiskey drinking, rifle-toting yokels lurking about, with rapine and revenge on their minds.
*An impressionable boy who speaks with an old Indian shaman about the terrible legend of the Wendigo, a fearsome creature that inhabits the primal woods around town, can take any shape, and ""as he eats gets bigger, and the bigger he gets, the hungrier he gets.""
Sounds like a perfect horror flick, you think, right?  Dead wrong. Wendigo is an excremental monster mash of cinematic mediocrity and a boring disappointment.  Part ""Blair Witch Project"", a slice of  ""The Shining"", and a sprinkle
of ""Deliverance"", the film shamelessly rips off all of these films and delivers as much excitement as your relatives' home movies.
What is most disappointing about ""Wendigo"" is that it had so much potential, and for the first 30 minutes I was hooked.  The setting, supposedly in upstate Connecticut, is both tranquil and foreboding, and the cinematography, competently rendered, adds to the initial feeling of isolation.  The acting is also good throughout, from the yokels (who range from surly and uncommunicative to murderous) to the family.  Patricia Clarkson, who starred alongside Kevin Costner as Elliot Ness's wife in the Untouchables, carries out her part with humor, reserve, and quiet conviction.  Father Geoge (Jake Weber), a troubled commercial photographer, is also solid and convincing in what could have been a cut-out role.  And Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey from Fox's ""Malcolm in the Middle""), a cute and mopey
little boy, does a competent job playing---surprise!---a cute and mopey little boy.
Indeed, some of the scenes are rich in atmosphere, hinting at
nastiness to come.  The initial confrontation with the town yokels is handled superbly, and the sense of isolation and palpable menace sets the groundwork for something malevolent and engrossing.
And then nothing happens. For about sixty minutes, ""Wendigo"" meanders lamely and turgidly along; oh yes, we have the legend of the Wendigo as told by a spooky Indian shaman, but even that loses its power after about the 40th voice-over.  A little jerky and overly clever camera work, some bad CGI, but that's it. The climactic scene where the Wendigo reveals itself to its hapless victim is so atrociously done, and the 'special effects' so bad,
How to think of ""Wendigo""? Imagine ""Deliverance"" without Ned Beatty squealing like a pig, a ""The Shining"" where Jack actually gets into writing his book, or ""Blair Witch"" without the witch, and you get a small sense of how exceedingly dismal ""Wendigo"" is.
The only thing I can imagine someone might get out of watching this film is in thinking what might have been.  In the hands of a competent, capable director, the solid acting, creepy premise, and excellent locations might have been made into a fine film.  But then, what's the point? Save 90 minutes of your life and rent a decent horror movie.",1052870400,4,3124,5.080078125

Chock full of needless character over-development, a purely gratuitous sex scene and a useless ""Matrix""-like pan and scan, this was two hours of my life I would like back.  To make this worse, the director's commentary, which is usually enjoyable on any film, was nothing more than the director stating it was my fault as a brainwashed audience member if I didn't enjoy the movie as I obviously was lacking in imagination and an open mind. No horror or suspense combined with poorly used ideas make this movie a must miss feature.",1050624000,,664,4.666666666666667
1792581,4,B00006SFJM,"On a chilly typically English night I desided after a visit to my local video store to hire out two movies which both stated from a review on the front cover that they both contained the power to scare. The ...movie Wendigo. ...in hand WENDIGO, this movie was never boring, the acting was all round excelent ... especially from the young boy Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey in Malcolm in the Middle) the script is well above average for a horror movie especially in this day and age were CGI seems to dominate the content and push along a very weak and mirrored narrative. Wendigo does not contain any of todays teen horror / slasher flick genre trademarks. ...But here for me was a little treasure that I came to ponder about for several weeks after. Not a great masterpiece mind you, such as the final 20 minutes of the movie could have been handled a little more restraintly but that doesn't put you off the movie as a whole. I know now from watching this movie that I will be looking out for Larry Fessenden the director in the future for I am sure he will go onto greater things. As it stands, give Wendigo a chance ... at least it dared to be slightly different and contained, for me, the most important ingredient of any horror movie, ATMOSPHERE!
And remember when independent horror flicks do come our way they will never appeal to the vast majority of audiences tastes simply because they were never meant too, if Windigo had then Larry Fessenden wouldn't have gone out and made it he would have made something like I Know What you Did Last Summer or Final Destination 2.
Lastly, if anybody is too blame for the slasher / gore generation being misguided to hire this flick out, it should be the those PR reps at promising themes that the film may not contain. So rent it and see a good little indie horror / thriller that delivers an icy atmosphere of thrills.

1792582,2,B00006SFJM,"""The Shining meets Deliverence when a family, stranded in the middle of nowhere, comes face to face with a terrifying legend.""
This is on the back of the DVD.  When I read this I immediatley wanted to see it.  Now I know that the quote above has absolutely nothing to do with the movie.  The family is not stranded in anyway, they have a car and even use it to make trips into town, and as for coming face to face with a terrifying legend?  Well, the only time anyone of the family members sees the wendigo is the little boy and thats for a second. The mother and father have no idea that anything strange is going on.  And as for Terrifying, well, simply put, NO!
The actual description of the movie states: ""But what seems to be a mere occurence of misfortune marks the beginning of a terrifying journey, where myth becomes reality and an evil spirit, half man and half animal, haunts a small town.""
The town had nothing to do with the movie!  Its never haunted by the wendigo and the towns people know nothing about this thing.  The movie revolves primarily around 4 people.  The two statements on the back of the box both contradict themselves.  And they are both flat out misrepresentations of the movie.  I was extremely excited about this movie when I first heard about it about 6 months ago and now I know I waited for nothing.",1048464000,3,1335,4.390243902439025
1792583,1,B00006SFJM,"I have to agree with most of the other reviewers here in concluding that this film is huge waste of time.
Fortunately, my exposure to it only came from renting it at my local [rental store] so I take comfort in the fact that I'm only out of [$$$] or so as opposed to the [$$$] to [$$$] I would have lost had I purchased the video or DVD.  Nevertheless, after watching this film last night I still felt cheated.
""Wendigo"" was released by Artisan, the same company that gave the world ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and I'm sure the creative minds behind this film would love for it to be lumped into the same psychological horror genre as that film.  This wouldn't be a bad thing if the script were serviceable.  But while the film does a good job of using it's isolated rural setting to build an atmosphere of dread, it doesn't use these elements to push the film to a satisfying conclusion.  Ultimately, ""Wendigo"" gives its storyline and its actors nowhere to go and nothing do.
The only actor in the film most folks are likely to have heard of is Eric Per Sullivan, who plays youngest brother, Dewey on Fox TV's ""Malcolm In The Middle"".  With his moon eyes and pensive glances he gives one of the best performances by a child actor in a suspense film since Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense.""
But his performance can't save the rest of the film which nearly bored me to tears.  While I'm not one of those half-wits that craves a bloodletting every 15 minutes as in any other routine slasher film, I do like to see something happen periodically to sustain my interest.
The hard truth is that there's so little going on in ""Wendigo"" that you'll be hard pressed to stay awake even if you watch it at 1 p.m. instead of 1 a.m.  This film may be worth catching on cable light at night when there's absolutely nothing else on.  Otherwise, consider it a must... to avoid.",1048377600,3,1865,4.401162790697675
1792584,1,B00006SFJM,"I was fooled by the cover of this flat liner of a movie. And when I say flat liner I'am not talking about a  scare your self to death type of movie, something more like bore yourself to death fits the part way better. This movie was full of nothing but bad acting and blair witch like camera work making it even more appualing...Not to mention the low grade made in the basement of the early hours like speical effects, and costume design....I'll hand it this it did start out sort of interesting and I was expecting like most good horror movies for it to pick up once the very fake looking deer was run over in the beggining....But once I saw the cheap thrills of this movie I was skepitcal in thinking it was just a flaw and it would pick up once they showed this so called ""WENDIGO."" But it wasn't too long before I found the movie half over and not much had happened, at that same time I found my self wanting Jason Voorhee's, Michael Myer's, Freddy Krueger,anything or anyone that would make this flaw of a flim more interesting...At least in those movies the killing started with in the first thirty minutes....And they were good and suspenseful none the less....
  So finally when the ever so needed and long awaited Wendigo decieced to show his face it was too late to save this sleeper of a  movie, sorry guy just a tad bit too late on the scary effect...
 So if you like such movies like the Blair Witch or Deliverence I guess this one would be sort of the film for you, but if you are looking for a good slasher like film filled with blood, guts,and gore, you might want to steer clear of this one...",1048291200,,1611,4.303630363036303

It scared me that any self-respecting actor would waste their time and effort on this movie.  The corny sound track and hokey special effects did coax some chuckles out of me but no screams.  This movie was so bad I feel a little guilty for actually wasting my time to write this review.

I had read the back cover of the dvd case several times before I bought the movie.  It indeed looked like a movie that perhaps would be scary and dark.  It was anything but. It is obvious that more money was spent casting the film then than writing, making, and producing.  I am sorely dissapointed that ARTISAN even picked it up.  The opening scenes make the movie look as if it could be entertaing.  The first sixty minutes are buildng the story line and characters.  The only problem that the movie does little else afterward.  In the last twenty minutes you introduced to everything that you bought the movie for.  This includes the actual Wendigo, the climax, and the end (if that is what it can be called.) And to be completely sarcastic, the Wendigo is the scariest creature I have ever seen. Thank the lord this monster  only occupies the screen for two minutes.

I don't think I've ever seen a more uneventful movie in my life.  There is no suspense hardly, it's just like watching a faimly hang out in a cabin and being afraid of the strange hunters down the street that don't do anything very threatening. The acting is the only thing that made this movie barable. And yes the monster is stupid looking and unesassary.  They could have gotten rid of him all together and just made this movie about the scary things the boys sees and hears in his head and made this movie better.  But the deer monster is a joke.

The type of things that come to mind when looking for spooky, tangable tension in film could be; being chased by Jack Nicolson with axe in hand through a wintery maze or exploring the haunted interior of a large abandoned insane asylum via sweeping, drawn out camera pans accompanied by erie music.  What 'Wendigo' gives the viewer is a truckload of atmosphere, but little else.  The movie starts off in the right vein.  The first 30 minutes are pretty good and I was thinking this could be a great horror flick.  The rest was junk, and it keeps getting worse until the end of the movie when you don't know what just happened and why and what exactly was the point.  Director Larry Fessenden Knows how to create a mood but doesn't know where to take it, leaving the plot flat and the characters boring.

1792612,3,B00006SFJM,"This movie starts off in a manner typical for the horror genre --a family from the city is driving out to their new house in the country, where sinister supernatural forces await. The trouble for this family (the parents are played by Jake Weber and Patricia Clarkson, their son by Erik per Sullivan) starts before they even reach the house. Their Volvo station wagon hits a deer that three local hunters had been stalking. The ensuing confrontation is an interesting study in culture shock. The hunters are your typical movie rednecks; one has a particularly large chip on his shoulder and is furious that the deers' antlers were damaged in the accident. The city folks are quintessential yuppies who look upon locals who hunt the way a 19th Century English explorer might have looked at tribesmen deep in the Amazon jungle. Naturally, it turns out that these locals are going to be their neighbors. Much of the film's supernatural content revolves around the son, who is given a strange figure by a mysterious American Indian who only he can see. The figure, he is told, represents the ferocious Wendigo, a powerful and perpetually hungry spirit. The film does not fall into the predictable pattern of the Wendigo stalking the house and its inhabitants. Instead, we see more of the family's often tense interactions and further conflicts with the angry neighbor. Most of the thrills are very understated and we are often uncertain what is really happening and what is in the boy's imagination. Some of the scenes invite obvious comparison to The Blair Witch Project, as both use the natural eeriness of the woods as a primary device. While Wendigo has some compelling scenes and the performances are all good, the various elements don't exactly mesh. We are never told why or how this Wendigo manifests; it is all quite vague. The ending is dark and ambiguous, forcing the audience to speculate about the meaning. This was appropriate for The Blair Witch Project, but seemed like cheating with the more conventional set-up of Wendigo.",1040774400,4,2036,4.921511627906977
