511233,5,630279482X,"When I first saw this movie in the theatre as a child in 1975, I was captivated by its magic.  Who wouldn't want to be a kid with the ability to fly, unlock doors, levitate things, and teach bullies a lesson?  Now,  having recently revisited Witch Mountain on video, the movie still brings  back pleasant, familiar emotions -- and as an adult, I find new dimensions  to this Disney classic.  While kids will appreciate the fantasy/mystery  aspect, it also teaches practical values: honesty, integrity, and being  true to oneself (among others).  This is a perfect family film, and  features remarkable performances by Eddie Albert as a grumpy old man whose  icy heart is melted by the two young orphans, and Ray Milland who, as  always, is a perfectly charming (if scary) villain.  It's a shame, though,  that the two young stars (Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards) pretty much  disappeared after this film and its sequel; their careers apparently never  much got off the ground (although Eisenmann did make a cameo appearance in  ""Star Trek: Wrath of Khan""), which is a shame because they are  both quite talented actors.",940809600,10,1119,4.861702127659575

511354,5,630279482X,"This film mesmerized me as a young child, and I remember insisting on seeing it twice (though my poor father had to sit through this and another Disney film, back when Disney did double features!). I refuse to see any of the remakes because, to me, Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann ARE Tony and Tia, though I know the new ones must have better special effects. This film is pre Star Wars and so the special effects may seem primitive compared to today's CGI, but the story is so good you forget how awkward and embarrassingly fake the effects are. The music is great also, back when even Disney films had memorable, catchy soundtracks. A great film to watch with your kids on a rainy day.",1496102400,,686,4.4523809523809526

511460,5,630279482X,"One of my favorite movies of all time. When I saw it as a kid, I did not want to leave the theater.... I cried during this movie and it spoke to my inner self. Before this movie came out even, I used to fantasize that my real people would come to Earth in a spaceship and I would ascend and not be alone any more. What makes this so much worse is that I love life deeply. I love people in all their folly. I did not like going to school because of the mindless cruelty I saw, and because I could not be myself there. So you can imagine the impact of this on me. An awesome story of people who are different in miraculous ways but also burdened by that difference and so alone. It spoke to my early perception of the danger of ignorance and the emotions that can fool people into doing what they think is right but may not be. At all. I used to see this as a clear and present danger when I was 6 years old. I could not put words to it at the time, but I WAS that boy and girl cast adrift in the universe. I loved the wise grandpa figure who saved them too. Reminded me of sort of my faith in God and hope for mankind incarnate. In some ways we all are alone to a greater or lesser degree. I think it is a movie anyone would like and can relate to because of that. It would make you think, and look at things in new ways - so it is valuable for that too.",1456617600,10,1353,3.835714285714286

511516,3,630279482X,"I had the kids see the new version Race to Witch Mountain (2009), which they enjoyed so I screened the original for the boy last night.

Sure, a minor Disney, but still holds up as well as it did then, even if the blue screen work is kinda lame.

The director, also of Hell House, does a good job.

I read the novel so long ago that I cannot recall how faithful it is, but I thought the most interesting aspect is a Dawn of the Dead situation in which the kids are tempted by material possessions and are able to leave them, in spite of being initially tempted by them and after having enjoyed them for a little while:

""If we have everything, then we have nothing left to wish for...""

How many of the new Disney films and TV shows could benefit from this attitude?

I wish I could remember if this attitude is also reflected in the novel.

It is also a blast seen the actors all grown up and recalling their experiences during and post the filming.

The kids also wanna see the sequel, which should be interesting seeing that Davis and Lee are in it, though I don't remember it being much good.",1448236800,,1096,4.235576923076923

I bought the 2009 rerelease of Alexander Key's novel of the same name, and liked that almost as much as ""The Forgotten Door"", also by Key.

Amazon had this edition of the DVD out at a cheap price so I got a copy and watched it.
Good, clear image & sound, subtitled and closed captioned- the second of 3 ""English"" subtitling selections seems to be cast/crew commentary, the 3rd brings up the ""fun facts"" pop ups. The story is as close an adaptation of the book to movie as any I think I've seen. Scene selection shows ""closing credits"" which are usually an extended version of ""opening credits""- but the DVD cuts off at ""The End"".
Towards the end when Uncle Bene tells Jason O'Day there are other children out there, and Jason says he'll look for them... I think the studio was thinking of a sequel even then.

I would expect most kids to enjoy watching it, most of the FX even hold up well (the flying Winnebago was weakest)- I didn't expect that to be the case.

511731,5,630279482X,"Escape to Witch Mountain is a heroic tale about two young kids going on a journey to find out who they really are. This movie tells the story of two kids who have special powers beyond belief, but no one understands that they are kids who just want to be loved by their family. They meet some peculiar and high-powered people who want to use the kids for their own advantages. But maybe, just maybe, they'll find a special someone who can look out for them and keep them safe, for now.

The main characters are Tia and Tony played by Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann. These two siblings have no memory of their past but the people they meet in their future could bring back some valuable memories. My favorite part is when Tony plays his harmonica and moves little marionette puppets with his mind. Everything is so happy, cheerful, and colorful. These kids have extraordinary powers that help them get through rough parts of their lives, like when they are being held captive in the villain's mansion.

I really like the scenery. It slowly changes from a small city to a private island near the sea. You can see the differences and hear the change as well. I was impressed with the special effects in this film, especially since it was made in the 70s. Looking at this movie, I realize that films from back then aren't too much different from the movies that come out today. Effects have improved over the years, but the basic idea of people and objects flying is the same.

I think the message of this movie is to never give up, no matter how dangerous or insane it might get. Tia and Tony never give up looking for their family.

I recommend this movie to ages 8 and up, because it's a little hard to understand but once you get a sense of the story, you can enjoy it in so many different ways.  I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars.  Maybe anyone could have thought of this idea, but no one would expect it to turn out the way it doe! Review by Canela R, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

511784,4,630279482X,"At the time of its original 1975 theatrical release this film was like a breath of fresh air and it happily remains so today.  Based on a book by Alexander Key, ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN is a tensely-plotted adventure thriller, filled with great performances and a positive message of empowerment for children.

Orphaned after the deaths of their foster parents, Tony and Tia Malone (Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards) go to live in a state orphanage, however the two kids are anything but normal.  Blessed with powers of telepathy and telekinesis, they have the ability to read each other's thoughts and predict when danger is approaching.  Such powers will only stay under wraps for so long without being noticed by the wrong sort of people, and pretty soon, Tia and Tony have much bigger problems to deal with than the resident orphanage bully, Truck (Dermott Downs).

Aristotle Bolt (Ray Milland) is a man with too much money and a desire to dabble in powers beyond his reach.  When his assistant Deranian (Donald Pleasence) encounters the gifted children and witnesses their talents first-hand, he passes himself off as their long-lost uncle and takes them to Bolt's isolated mansion.  Realising the dangers ahead, Tony and Tia soon take flight in a terrifying escape.  With their only clue a map hidden inside Tia's star-case, the kids set forth on a perilous journey to the mystical area known as Witch Mountain...

ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN was directed with great economy and flair by John Hough, a British director known for his skill with psychological thrillers.  Wanting to make a film with more ""grit"" than the regular Disney fare of the period, Disney execs approached Hough after seeing his disturbing ""Legend of Hell House"".

ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN is light-years away from the charming, benign comedies Disney was specialising in at the time (""The Apple Dumpling Gang"", ""Freaky Friday"", ""Herbie Rides Again"" etc.); and has an ominously dark centre at the heart of the story.  Yet within this, there's a sweetness which is never overly-sugary and performances so endearing but never cloying.  Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards are both very impressive and importantly bear a realistic familial bond - so convincing in fact that some fans actually believed they were brother and sister in real life!  At the time, Kim was the bigger star having just come out of the high-rating TV sitcom ""Nanny and the Professor""; whereas Ike was still really at the very beginning of what turned out to be a very solid career both in front of and behind the camera.

If there's one shortcoming, one wishes that perhaps Ray Milland's Aristotle Bolt wasn't quite as remote.  As the story's villain he is strangely detached from most of the story and it's really Pleasence's Deranian who takes the larger role of the two.  Eddie Albert plays Jason O'Day, a lonely widower on a cross-country Winnebago holiday who winds up as the childrens' biggest salvation.

Special features on the DVD include ""Making the Escape"", is a 2003 retrospective featurette which catches up with stars Eisenmann, Richards, Dermott Downs, and director John Hough. It throws up a few fun stories, including Hough almost casting a young Jodie Foster as Tia!  ""Conversations with John Hough"" gives us a few more insights into the British director's career before, during and after WITCH MOUNTAIN.  ""Disney Effects: Something Special"" is a fascinating glimpse into Disney's unparalleled special effects unit; wheras ""Disney Sci-Fi"" is a quick series of clips from some of Disney's science-fiction themed features and shorts.

ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN remains one of the most masterful, unusual films from the Disney studios.  A sci-fi psychological thriller, during a time when the studio was cranking out a series of charming but very innocuous comedies.  This DVD gives the film the justice it deserves with a wide array of quality extras.  Recommended.",1355097600,2,3920,5.060653188180404

It quickly becomes apparent that they have powers not shared by their fellows: they can levitate (though Tony needs help from his harmonica to do any kind of fine work), Tony can ""visualize"" places they've been or are going to go, and Tia can speak to him mentally and talk any animal into doing her will.  They also have some precognitive ability, and when they save Lucas Deranian (Donald Pleasance) from being crushed when a wrecker smashes into the side of his limo, they attract the attention of his employer, the very wealthy Aristotle Bolt (Ray Milland), who not only believes in things psychic but wants to control some to increase his riches.  Tricked into going to live at his mansion, the kids soon realize they're pawns and make their escape, stowing away in an RV driven by crusty Jason O'Day (Eddie Albert) as they try to follow a sketchy map Tia has found under the cover of her ""star case.""

511789,5,630279482X,"I first saw this movie when I was ten, and had a crush on Kim Richards because of it.  Heck, I wanted to be a child actor for Disney because of it.

  This movie was made when Hollywood knew how to make movies well, relying on good acting, excellent writing, and innovative special effects, instead of the lazy computer-driven special effects and lackluster writing and performances so prevelent in movies today.

The commentary by Richards and Eisenmann are entertaining and insightful, particularly when they both said they were a little afraid of Bolt (Milland) in real life (he probably did that on purpose to get a better performance out of the kids.)

  At the time, I really dug the kids' powers, and I remember trying to move things with my mind and trying to get my friends at school to hear my thoughts.

  This movie is truely a classic, standing alone out of all the other live Disney films.  It was a mistake for them to attempt a remake, when everyone's comparing it to the original.  Even Return From Witch Mountain was a disappointment, when compared to the original.  You don't even attempt a remake or even a sequal, unless you have something to say that will blow away the original, or at least build on it.

 As you will see, Tony and Tia have special mental and physical powers to help them out of dangerous situations.
  A spiteful man, Mr. Bolt (Ray Milland) wants the children as his own and tells his henchman (Donald Pleasence) to acquire the children.
  Once at the mansion, the children have a strong feeling they should not be trusting Mr. Bolt as he is only interested in their powers.
  They must escape. With the use of Tia's Star Case and the special help of the black cat, Winkie, they all make a getaway. They enlist the help of a man, Jason O'Day (Eddie Albert) to help them get to Witch Mountain.

-------------
This movie is among one of Disney's best presentations. One advantage is that it was made before somebody tried to be politically correct or force some politically correct idea down our throats.

As with many of the earlier movies one nicety is that the credits appear before the film so that you can anticipate the actors and the music that you are about to hear.

Because now day's people have larger television, screens it is a little easier to see the wires that hold up items that are supposed to be floating. Nevertheless, this does not interfere with the entertainment.

One advantage of this DVD and DVDs at this time is the added voice overview, ""Conversations with John Hough"", which gives insight to what they were trying to produce as they made this movie. Listen to the overview and then watch the movie again and you will gain more insight and still not lose any of the entertainment value.

Escape to witch Mountain may be superseded by a new version but it will never be duplicated or exceeded for pure entertainment.

511819,4,630279482X,"Based upon the book by Alexander Key, ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN follows two orphan children, Tia and Tony Malone (Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann), as they move into a new orphanage. Tia and Tony have a very strong and close relationship with each other. Tia and Tony are very polite and respectful and adults adore them. However, even though they get along with the other children at the orphanage, most everyone thinks they are strange and the siblings tend to stick to themselves. They have a very specific reason for doing this: Tia and Tony have supernatural powers. Tia can speak to Tony telepathically, is able to levitate objects, can speak to animals, and is able to see future events. Tony can levitate objects, too, but he has to play a harmonica to be able to do it. Tia is definitely the more powerful of the siblings. Neither Tony or Tia remember anything from their early childhood, but Tia begins to slowly remember a sequence of past events a little bit at a time during throughout the movie.

On a fieldtrip into town, Tia has an image of a man being severely injured in a car accident. They speak to the man and warn him to not get into his car and then get back on the school bus. The man decides to not enter the car and minutes later a truck smashes into his car. The man, Lucas Deranian (Donald Pleasence) is impressed by what he witnesses and reports to his boss, Aristotle Bolt (Ray Milland), that he believes he's found what they've been looking for. Bolt intends to use the children to assist him in his money-making schemes and sends Deranian to the orphanage posing as their long lost uncle so that he can ""adopt"" them. Upon arriving at Bolt's lavish estate, the children are swept over by emotions of happiness and joy. Everything they have ever desired is within their command. But when they learn how Bolt intends to use them as psychic slaves for his personal gain, they escape. They end up hiding in the Winnebago of a grumpy, childless widower named Jason O'Day (Eddie Albert). At first he is against helping them, but quickly comes around and decides to help the children escape from Bolt and deliver them safely to the destination they are ultimately directed: Witch Mountain.

ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUTAIN is a fairly entertaining movie that is most notable for its strong cast and entertaining and fairly believable story-line. STAR WARS was still a few years away, but in 1975 sci-fi was beginning to morph from being a bizarre and foolish past time into a legitimate genre of literature and film. ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN is a great movie that illustrates that. Set in what was then the present-day, the movie provides a realistic setting and tone that is stripped of most of the fantastical elements common in much sci-fi of the time. The movie has a delightful cast of actors that do a wonderful job in making their characters believable. Some of the special effects look rather cheesy by today's standards. However, considering there was no CGI and all of the effects were done by traditional methods, most of the effects shots are rather impressive.

The only major drawback about the film that I have is the dialogue. I'm not sure if it was because Tia and Tony were aliens, but they way they speak to each other is not the way kids usually speak with one another. The word choice and pacing are completely off and instead of seeming unusual, much of their dialogue is just plain cheesy. This usually isn't such a big deal in movies, but in all other aspects ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN is an excellent sci-fi movie, but the dialogue really weighs it down at points.

I enjoyed ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN. I recommend it for anyone who saw the movie in the past, people who enjoy good & realistic based sci-fi, anyone who has read the book, and children in general.

The special edition DVD includes several extras including an audio commentary with director John Hughes and stars Richards and Eisenmann, pop-up fan facts feature during the movie, a conversation with director John Hughes, a featurette entitled ""Making the Escape"", a Disney sci-fi movie montage entitled ""Disney Sci-Fi"", a featurette about effects at Walt Disney entitled ""Disney Effects, Something Special"", the 1975 Disney Studio Album, and a short cartoon featuring Pluto and Mickey entitled ""Pluto's Dream House"".

Out of all the special features I most enjoyed ""Making the Escape"", ""Disney Effects, Something Special"", and ""Pluto's Dream House."" ""Making the Escape"" is basically a usual making-of featurette, however because of the personalities of the main players interviewed I actually found it kind of riveting. ""Disney Effects, Something Special"" was really interesting because not only did it describe how some of the effects were done in ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN, but it gave some history about special effects at Disney. Disney was known for their animation and nature films by most people, but the studio also had an incredibly special effects department that pulled off some amazing effects and stunts that other studios would never attempt to do or not do well. ""Pluto's Dream House"" was a short I saw a few times as a kid. Mickey is building a new dog house for Pluto when he uncovers a magic lamp that begins helping build the house. Of course, any time that Mickey gets involved with Magic you know it's trouble.",1238284800,,5333,4.7724810400866735

511821,5,630279482X,"To coincide with the new Witch Mountain film being released to theaters, Disney is re-releasing ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" (1975) as a special edition loaded with well-done extras.

The story is about Tony (Ike Eisenmann) and his younger sister, Tia (Kim Richards), two orphans who have recently lost their foster parents as well. While getting used to their new home, an orphanage (run by Disney favorite Reta Shaw), the children draw the attention of an attorney, Lucas Deranian (Donald Pleasence), whose life is saved because of the children's esp powers. Deranian's boss, Aristotle Bolt (Ray Milland) is an evil (and wealthy man) fascinated with paranormal powers. He pretends to be the children's uncle so that he can take custody of them and use them for his own gain. Meanwhile, Tia's star case (a metal purse) reveals a map to Witch Mountain, providing clues to their origins. Once Tony & Tia discover Bolt's plot to exploit them, they escape his mansion and with the help of a crusty (only on the outside!) widower, Jason O'Day (Eddie Albert), they try to find their way home to Witch Mountain. Bolt and the greedy townspeople (hungry for Bolt's financial reward) chase after the children. Will they make it home?

Sure, the special effects will not be quite as dazzling to current generations used to digital, but the story and its universal themes more than make up for the film's 1970's appearance. What child couldn't relate to having a hard time fitting in with others, feeling lost and just wanting to find the comfort and warmth of home? Richards and Eisenmann have excellent chemistry, and are ably supported by veteran actors Ray Milland, Eddie Albert, and Donald Pleasance (who is extremely menacing in his understated performance). The scenery is also fantastic, as much of the film is shot on location in Carmel and Palo Alto. And as for style...the opening credits still pack a wallop--WAY COOL!

The extras are fantastic, giving a very complete look at how the film was made.

Very enjoyable to listen to, filled with fun behind the scenes info, such as Tia's star case currently residing in the Disney archives, and learning that Kim's younger sister played Tia in the flashbacks. What is fantastic is that both Kim & Ike have excellent recall of what occurred during filming.

""Making the Escape"" (26:41): What a fantastic making-of featurette. Interviews with Richards, Eisenmann (who now goes by the name Iake Eissinmann), red-headed bully orphan Dermott Downs, and director John Hough. Hough tells how Disney wanted a grittier and darker feel to ""Witch Mountain,"" which is why he got the job (thanks to previous films, including ""Legend of Hell House""). Kim & Ike share very warm memories of making the movie (Ike is even moved to tears when discussing the themes of the movie and people's reaction). Kim remembers Disney as the best studio and most loyal, with a family feeling; obviously, these were special times for these two actors who also enjoyed being part of the special effects used in the film. Interestingly enough, Jodie Foster was considered for Kim's part until Foster took another project instead.

""Conversations with John Hough"" (6:52): Interview with the director, who discusses his philosophy on filmmaking. ""Get passionate about a subject, and don't give up."" He attributes his long career to making a variety of movies and gambling on risky projects. He aptly feels that good directors must be part psychologists, to understand the actors and crew.

""Disney Sci Fi"" (2:45): A montage of clips from films such as ""Escape to Witch Mountain,"" ""The Rocketeer,"" ""Tron,"" ""The Cat from Outer Space,"" and ""The Navigator.""

""Disney Effects--Something Special"" (11:03): Harrison Ellenshaw, a visual effects designer who also happens to be the son of famous Disney matte artist Peter, discusses the history of visual effects at the Disney studio. ""20K Leagues Under the Sea"" (1954) was the first visual effects film shot on the Disney lot. Ub Iwerks was the genius who accomplished many of the dazzling effects at Disney, and the man behind the the process lab. ""Mary Poppins"" and other films show how rich and artistic matte paintings could look on film, giving a special perfection not possible with location filming. ""Dick Tracy"" (1990) was pretty much the last Disney film to use the traditional photochemical processes & matte paintings. Today, most of these effects are handled digitally. A clip from ""The Rookie"" is shown, illustrating how a grip is digitally removed from the film. ""Fix it in post"" has become the standard line after a mistake is made.

""Disney Studio Album 1975"": Shows clips from what was going on at the Disney Studio during that year: ""Escape to Witch Mountain,"" ""The Apple Dumpling Gang,"" ""Strongest Man in the World,"" ""One of our Dinosaurs is Missing,"" Debut of America On Parade (Disneyland),  Mission to Mars (Disneyland), ""No Deposit No Return"" in production, ""Crazy With the Heat"" (reissue), ""Pluto's Christmas Tree"" (reissue), ""Pluto's Housewarming"" (reissue), ""The Sky's The Limit"" (TV), ""The Boy Who Talked to Badgers"" (TV), ""The Secret of the Pond"" (TV), and Welcome to the World--Space Mountain Opens at WDW.

""Pluto's Dream House"" (1940): Mickey wants to build Pluto a new doghouse, and with the aid of an unseen Genie in a lamp, accomplishes his goal. Although enjoyable, it is extremely curious that Disney puts this on the DVD with no background or explanation, especially with its politically incorrect depiction of the genie (who sounds like he wandered off the set of Amos & Andy) and Pluto being painted in blackface and getting dubbed ""Mammy."" And yet, ""Song of the South"" remains in the vaults.

Sneak Peeks:
Featuring previews of Bolt, Disney XD, Tinkerbell & The Lost Treasure, Morning Light (inspiring true story of Roy Disney putting together a team of 15 inexperience sailors for a trip from LA to Honolulu), Snow White (on Blu-ray), and Bedtime Stories (Adam Sandler).

511822,5,630279482X,"The classic Walt Disney sci-fi film ""ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"" (1975) is released on DVD to help celebrate the theatrical release of ""RACE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"" (the third `WITCH MOUNTAIN' film which can be considered a new storyline or a re-imagining of the first film).

""ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"" would be a family sci-fi film to utilize the latest special effects at that time and bring popular British director John Hough (""THE AVENGERS"", ""THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE""), known for his work on television episodes and horror films to direct a family film.

Based on the original novel by Alexander Key, ""ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"" focuses on two children Tony (played by Ike Eisenman) and Tia Malone (played by Kim Richards) who have supernatural powers.

Tia can communicate with Tony via telepathy and has the ability to work things in her mind and sense the future, while Tony has the ability to create or levitate things while playing the harmonica.

Both Tony and Tia (with their black cat named ""Winkle"") move to an orphanage and try to watch each other's back but with a bully at the orphanage always challenging both brother and sister, Tia tends to use her power to help Tony in the public eye.  Such as helping him levitate many feet high to catch a ball during a baseball game or during a fight with a bully, levitating a baseball glove and while it's in the air, using it to hit the bully.  Of course, it doesn't help that the kids of the orphanage see this and thus, they tend to look at the two as strange people.

Throughout the course of the film, Tia has images in her mind of their childhood.  Not being able to understand what is happening, these fragments of memories are all she has of their past.  Something that both really can't remember.

While on a school trip, Tia gets one of her premonitions about a guy who will be hurt in his car.  Both Tony and Tia try to find the guy named Lucas Deranian (played by Donald Pleasence) and hopefully prevent him from getting into his car.  Tina pleads with the guy that she senses things and he should listen to her and not get in the car.  He listens to her and next thing you know, a tow truck rams into the car.

Deranian is surprised by the children's power and he tells his boss, multi-millionaire Aristotle Bolt (played by Ray Milland) about the children.  Bolt who likes to use psychics to help him make more money is now interested in the two children and thus he and Deranian concoct a scheme with faked paperwork to say that Deranian is the kid's long lost uncle.

At first the kids are happy to have a new home, especially in a mansion and having all they can ever want.  But Tina starts to sense the future and learns that Bolt is an evil man that will try to exploit them for their powers and possibly hurt them.

She is so afraid that she tells Tony that both of them must leave the mansion.  At first Tony feels that maybe Tia is just feeling weird because they have everything that they want but he knows better not to question his sister's premonitions and thus decides to help her escape from the mansion.

Thus Bolt has all his men looking for the children and bring them back to the mansion but the kids manage to use their powers to help them out of the private property and hide in a camper by a disgruntled old man named Jason O'Day.  O'Day is asked by Deranian if he has seen the children but O'Day has not and doesn't want to be bothered.

O'Day just wants to travel and be left alone and as he parks near the beach, he finds a cat (which belongs to the children) and when he goes to feed it, he finds out that the children are hiding in his camper. At first, O'Day wants nothing to do with them but being an older man who never had any children of his own, he is surprised by the children's power and tries to help them escape from Aristotle Bolt and the police who are looking for them.

And thus the film becomes a cat versus mouse storyline of O'Day and the children trying to escape and go to witch mountain before they are caught.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"" is a 35-year-old film that is featured in widescreen 1:75:1 and enhanced for 169 televisions.  The film looks well-preserved for its age but of course, special effects from that time do look quite cheesy in today's standards, but one could imagine how in 1975, the special effects featured were top of the line.  Also, the film benefits from being shot outdoors, so the picture quality is colorful.

As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound with a secondary French language track.  I didn't recall hearing many special effects utilized in the rear channel but dialogue and effects were quite clear coming from the front channels.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"" includes several special features.  Many which were included in the 2003 DVD release but there is one special feature that is exclusive to the 2009 DVD release.  Included are:

  * ALL NEW Pop-Up Fun Facts - For those who want to watch the film with fun facts popping up on the bottom of the screen.
  * Making the Escape - A pretty lengthy featurette with interviews with director John Hough, Ike Eisenmann, Kim Richards and more.  Hough talks about working with Disney, while Eisenmann and Richards talk about working with the talent, the animals and their overall experiences.
  * Conversations with John Hough - A short featurette about Hough's past experience in television and film and working on a Disney film.
  * Disney Sci-Fi - A short music video of various clips of Disney Sci-Fi
  * ""PLUTO'S DREAM HOUSE"" - An animated short featuring Mickey Mouse and Pluto. Mickey Mouse finds a magic lamp and has the lamp build a dog house for Pluto.
  * Disney Effects - Something Special - A very intriguing featurette about special effects in Disney films, especially the utilization of painting backgrounds on glass to how special effects were done in ""Parent Trap"" and other films.
  * 1975 Disney Studio Album - A short musical featurette featuring stills from all films that were shown in 1975.
  * Audio Commentary - Commentary by John Hough, Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards.  It appears that Hough's commentary was recorded separately from Eisenmann and Richards.  But the three talk about their experiences and some tidbidts of certain scenes from the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"" is indeed a classic Disney sci-fi film.

As a film such as ""MARY POPPINS"" was instrumental in wowing audiences for its musical and its special effects back in 1964.  ""ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"" was a Disney film that would be a family film but utilize quite a bit of special effects to make the supernatural abilities look natural on film.  With the use of wires and the use of editing tricks available in 1975, children were mesmerized by it.

And since it was a Disney film, it made it that much special for children and families, to have a film that would attract people of all ages.  Something that Walt Disney has always wanted for his films...animated or live.

Of course, the special effects used in 1975 looks dated compared to what we have seen Disney do these days but considering how films were at that time, it's how things were.

But for many children, like Elliott and E.T. were for children in the 80's, Tony and Tina were popular characters for children in the mid-70's.  The fact that these two had special powers was quite exciting at the time and the film became a big hit.

It resonated well with adults and children and It was quite interesting for me because I was a young child when this film first came out and I had the opportunity to watch the film on DVD together with my six-year-old.  He absolutely loved the film and asked if we could watch the second film afterwards.

Now, for those who own the 2003 DVD release, you may not need this DVD because there really is no major addition in terms of special features but for those who are looking forward to watching Dwayne Johnson in ""RACE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"" in 2009 and have never watched the original films or its been too long since you have last seen it, then definitely pick up both classic Witch Mountain films.

As for ""RACE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"", both ""ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"" and ""RETURN FROM WITCH MOUNTAIN"" both come with a free ticket coupon (attached to the slipcase cover) to download a certificate (ticket) in order to watch the latest film at a participating theater for free.

Overall, ""ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN"" is a fun and enjoyable film and despite being nearly 35 years old, it's a film that families can watch with their children now and still be entertained.

Definitely a Disney classic worth having in your DVD library.",1236470400,13,8702,4.5811247575953455
511843,3,630279482X,"Tony and Tia Malone (Ike Eisenmann and Kim Richards) have just been placed in an orphanage.  Their adoptive parents have just been killed.  But the kids wonder about their birth parents, especially since they have special powers.  Among other things, Tony can move things with his mind (as long as he is playing a harmonica) and Tia can communicate with animals.

Just as they discover a weird map in the star case that Tia always carries around, they catch the interest of Aristotle Bolt (Ray Milland).  Mr. Bolt is rich, but he's always looking for ways to become richer.  He thinks the kids ability to see the future would help him with his goal.  But they aren't convinced the fancy place he has built for them isn't a trap, so they escape.  With Bolt and his henchmen, lead by Deranian (Donald Pleasance), after them, the kids find an ally in Jason O'Day (Eddie Albert), a loaner traveling around in his motor home.  Will that be enough to help them escape?  What about the strange memories the kids are having?  And where does the map lead?

I finally got a chance to watch this 70's Disney classic recently, and I was underwhelmed.  The plot took quite a while to get going, so the first half was rather slow.  Once we reached the second half, things did pick up, but I still wasn't as caught up in the story as I expected to be.  There are a couple of plot points that are completely glossed over in the course of the movie.  This left me scratching my head.  The adults were fine with their acting, but the kids were a little too earnest, making it seem over the top.  While some of the special effects, especially around the climax, are rather dated, most of them actually hold up pretty well today.

This movie will certainly entertain young kids.  But the adults in the audience probably won't be nearly as thrilled with it.",1232496000,,1836,4.506060606060606
511844,5,630279482X,"I remember the first time I saw this movie when I was only 8 years old.  I was in the 3rd grade when it first came to the movie theatres.  It was re-released at the theatres in 1978 when Return From Witch Mountain (the sequel) came out as well.  I really was a kid who wasn't that much into mainstream movies, but I was a Disney Movie fan though.  I remember how much the story of Tony and Tia really paralleled my own life and coming to understanding about why I didn't fit in and trust me I will reveal why later in the review.  I was shy and withdrawn and didn't have many friends and I usually kept to myself.  Watching the movie made me open up my feelings about things and it instantly became one of my most prized ""obsessions"" in my entire school years growing up from elementary up to almost high school.  I was also teased as ""the kid from Witch Mountain"" because I could actually act every scene from the movie word for word and to this day, I still remember the movie almost word for word.  I'm now a 40 year old guy living in Los Angeles and this movie still will remain special in my heart.  This is a great movie for all families to share, especially families with children with special needs.  I dedicate this movie to all people with autism and Asperger's Disorder (like myself) because of how it ""magically* can open our hearts to reach out to those who have difficulty reaching us.  Being an adult with autism is almost like how Tony and Tia felt as outcasts, freaks, weirdos (in the words of Dermott Downs).  I wish more people would look beyond the Disney part of the movie and really see the emotional part that Tony and Tia feel and what it's like to walk in their shoes.  It's good to know that there are special people like *Jason O' Day* who are patient and understanding to search for the answers.  I call them special education teachers, general education teachers, parents, and people who are willing to work with people like us.  Thank you Disney for opening our eyes and reaching us who would have never been reached without the magic of this magnificent production.

511845,5,630279482X,"This classic 1975 adventure is hilarious in parts (granted some laughs are also from the old very dated special effects) of the storyline and edge of your seat thrilling in others.  This movie is based on the book of the same name by Alexander Key which was a lot different to this movie wand is a little bit less complicated character wise for the child actors and I guess Disney made it a bit more family friendly as well. Alexander Key was the Steven King for junior fiction back in the 70's and 80's and it's a shame most of his novels are out of print now, but at least the movies or his books are being re-released again.  What is also good is that back in this era of film kids films could be a bit more realistic and include things like adults chasing kids with guns (I'm glad they didn't do what ET did and replace the guns with flashlights or something ridiculous), and a bully getting his comeuppance with baseball equipment, stuff like this are all classic scenes and unfortunately in this politically correct cotton wool kid generation world of today have disappeared from films.

This is a great film and is the story of two kids named Tony and Tia Malone who as the film begins are being put into an orphanage as their foster parents just died.  Even though they swore to each other not to reveal their powers a bully pushes the wrong buttons and Tony unleashes his powers (with hilarious results).  They save a man's life who shows his gratitude by pretending to be their uncle (with the backing of an evil millionaire) and taking them back to his employers mansion who has plans to exploit the children.  The children have plans of their own to journey to a destination on a map hidden in Tia's starkit but corrupt police, rednecks and everyone will do whatever they can to stop them.  Classic film, region 4 DVD has no extras but it looks like the region Amazon sells has a few.  You can also get this DVD as a double movie package with its sequel with the very imaginative title Return from Witch Mountain. Not just for kids, adults will love this too!",1188604800,,2071,4.445910290237467
511846,5,630279482X,"A Great film for anyone from 5 to 95 if they have any imagination at all. Special effects are somewhat minimal but are good considering when the movie was made. The computer graphics used now were not available at that time. As far as I could see only one reviewer came close to attributing the script to it's 'spiritual' if not it's real source. The entire story could have come directly from Zenna Henderson's 'universe' of the People.

  The film covers a short period in the lives of two children of the ""People"" during which they discover why they are different from others around them and eventualy find a large group of others like themselves. For those not familiar with the ultimate source of the tale, The ""People"" are survivors of a planet of a star which became a nove. One of the escaping starships traveled toward our earth but was damaged on the way. On entering the atmosphere most of those who escaped in lifeboats were widly scatered, usually in small family groups across the Western great plains of the USA. (The ship crashed in the Colorado Rockies). These People were exactly like us in appearence, even to genetic compatibility, but had many mental power powers we do not have.

  To anyone wanting to know more about these People I highly recommend four of Zenna Henderson's books: ""Pilgrimage: The Book of the People"", ""The People, No Different Flesh"", ""The Anything Box"" and ""Holding Wonder"". These were written in the 1950's or early 1960's, so may be difficult to find.

  I have always been disapointed that no other films were made based on these stories.",1157760000,,1585,4.734545454545454
511847,4,630279482X,"I was always amazed when Disney got the formula right after the 1960s.  In 1975, Disney Studios found the magic again with ""Escape to Witch Mountain.""  Soon the special effects of this movie would be eclipsed by the breakthrough movie ""Star Wars,"" but many of the special effects still hold up today, and make this movie a lot of fun to watch.

Tony Malone (Ike Eisenmann, whose acting career has been supplanted by other interests, though he had a memorable role in ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"") and Tia Malone (who was a real cutie then and now, but whose acting career mostly stopped in 1985) are two children who appear to be orphaned.  But there is something strange about Tony and Tia.  They can do magic!  Well, maybe not magic, but they are telekinetic, telepaths, and Tia seems to be able to foretell the future.

We meet Tony and Tia as they are entering a children's home.  After Tony handles a bully using his mental powers we realize that Tony and Tia are not average orphans.  When we overhear Tony and Tia talking to each other using telepathy, we realize Tony and Tia are really out of place.

Unfortunately, Tony and Tia are also incredibly nice kids.  Tia tells Lucas Deranian (played by the late Donald Pleasence, a workaholic who appeared in more than 100 movies and television shows in the last 20 years of his life) not to get into his car.  Moments later, a tow truck demolishes Deranian's car, and Deranian suspects that Tia may be a very special child.

Deranian tells his employer, Aristotle Bolt (Ray Milland, another veteran actor, who was struggling to find better roles after his ill-fated appearance in the critter-fest ""Frogs"" in 1972) that Tony and Tia may have powers.  Mr. Bolt has an open mind about these things, and has been seeking supernatural guidance for some time.  Mr. Bolt, wealthy multi-millionaire that he is, fabricates all sorts of documentation to be able to adopt the children for his own nefarious purposes.

Tony and Tia are quick to figure out that Mr. Bolt is sleazy, and they quickly make a break for freedom with Mr. Bolt sending all the forces in his power to find them.

Tony and Tia are fortunate in that they encounter kindly Jason O'Day (Eddie Albert, yet another veteran actor) and his camper.  Though Jason appears gruff and bluff, he is actually a nice man and he decides to help the children.

As these events have been unfolding, we catch glimpses of visions that Tia is having.  These visions seem to indicate that the children were involved in some kind of disaster at sea.  Tia's star case and the visions seem to indicate that the children should go to Witch Mountain, and that's where Mr. O'Day is hoping to take them, with Mr. Bolt hot on their trail.

This DVD includes a sprinkling of extras.  There is a making of feature, a cartoon, a featurette and more.  Those fans who enjoy extras will find most of these extras interesting.

This Disney movie is sprinkled with enjoyable special effects.  Things fly and instruments play themselves.  Animals are controlled by telepathy and help the children to escape.  All but the most jaded viewer should gain some enjoyment from this film.  I think those who remember this film from its original release and children not yet warped by excessive computer graphics and special effects will find the most charm in this fun movie.  This movie is worth watching over and over again.  Enjoy!",1151971200,,3409,4.688552188552189
511848,4,630279482X,"""Escape to Witch Mountain"" is an entertaining adventure with a dash of mystery and sci-fi mixed in for good measure, starring two of Disney's most talented kid actors, Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann.  The story involves Kim and Ike as brother and sister, Tony and Tia, who are orphans that happen to have special powers.  They know something is leading them to discover their true origins, but are unsure just what to do about it.  While on a school outing, Tony and Tia use their special powers to stop an accident from occurring.  Two evil men see these kids have special abilities and phone their boss, who is a power greedy criminal mastermind , played by Ray Milland.  After discovering that the children are orphans, Milland decides to pose as their long lost uncle and adopt them.  After the kids are adopted, they're taken to Milland's private estate, which is more of a fortress.  The children discover two things at this point in the picture, (1) the discovery of a map, which gives direction to a place called Witch Mountain, is discovered under the front panel of Tia's star case purse. (2) that they are being used for evil purposes by the man that claims to be their uncle.  Tony and Tia decide to escape to Witch Mountain and so begins their jouney into adventure.  I remember seeing this movie for the first time on television's Wonderful World of Disney.  The special effects were very impressive at that time, however, it was the young actors, Kim and Ike, that made the film special with their abilities to relate to the movies younger audience.  The special edition dvd has a clean transfer and the sound is great.  I enjoyed the interviews with Kim and Ike, as well as the ""making of"" feature with insights from the film's director.  I highly recommend ""Escape to Witch Mountain,"" as well as its' sequel, ""Return from Witch Mountain,"" with Kim and Ike reprising their roles.  Disney produced several highly entertaining films during the late 70's and this is one of their best.  Thanks Kim and Ike, you'll always be remembered for these very enjoyable roles that all of us `70's kids still remember with fondness.

**UPDATE!** ""Escape To Witch Mountain"" and ""Return From Witch Mountain"" are now available both on one DVD disc, and sadly missing ALL of the movie trailers, commentaries, and extras that were part of the 2003 individual single disc ""Special Edition"" releases. If your only interested in the movies themselves (which are a lot of fun!) then this ""2 Movie Collection"" version is the way to go.

511860,4,630279482X,"I first watched this movie when I was around 10.  I absolutely adored it, as did my two sisters who were about 5 and 6 years old.  It is a story about 2 orphans, Tony and Tia who after losing not only their parents, but also their wonderful foster parents, go to live in an orphanage.  They are known as freaks there because of their strange powers to do some things like read each others thoughts and pick up objects without using their bodies.  An evil man named Mr. Deranean (sp?) witnesses their powers first hand and tells his evil boss Mr. Bolt about them.  The boss tells  Mr. Deranean to claim to be the kids' uncle so that he can adopt them and then bring them to Bolt's mansion to help Bolt out financially ( as if he needed it!).  Of course the kids eventually escape with the help of a sweet (although a bit grumpy) old man named Jason.  He helps them find their real family that live on Witch Mountain.  My favorite scene as a kid was when Jason and the children are in the woods happily drinking hot chocolate and Jason tells them about his past and the children comfort him and then Jason learns to love the kids as if they were his own.  I also love the scene when the kids do an amazing puppet show without using their hands.  All they use is Tony's magic harmonica.

This movie is definitely outdated and if I hadn't seen it as a kid, I would probably think it was the dorkiest thing I ever saw.  However, I still like watching it today.  This movie is safe for kids.  Even though it has to do with ESP, it isn't really spooky and I don't think parents need to worry their kids will start getting into weird philosophies or experimenting with ""the other side"".

I of course enjoyed the cartoons but also enjoyed the many live action Dinsey movies such as THE SHAGGY DOG, THE SHAGGY D.A., POLLYANNA, THE WHIZ KIDS movies and of course the WITCH MOUNTAIN movies.  I remember looking forward to ESCAPE TO WITCH MOUNTAIN and would make it a point to never miss this movie when it aired.

The story is about a brother and sister, Tony & Tia, who along with their alien family tried to migrate to Earth but crashed upon arriving.  Tony and Tia then try to locate their family with the assistance of a widower while trying to avoid a rich villan who wants to use the kids Extra Sensory Powers (ESP) to further his greedy goals. As a child I actually found this movie to be very scary.  I actually feared for Tony and Tia.  Now as an adult it has lost the scary aspect.  That comes with age I guess.  It is still a good watch though.

I have wanted to purchase this film for years so my children could watch it.  Now that they are pre-teens and begining to lose their childhood innocence I was finally able to purchase this new DVD.  As I suspected they were reluctant to watch this movie and the sequel RETURN FROM WITCH MOUNTAIN.  I finally got them to watch the films and they did enjoy the them but obviously it did not have the same effect on them as it did me.  However younger children, especially those who have not been spoiled by CGI special effects will no doubt still enjoy the films.  I tried to explain to my children that as a grade schooler I had a huge crush on Kim Richards (Tia).  I got teased for that and of course when I teased my boy about his attraction to Hillary Duff that was a different matter.  Go figure.

After saving the life of a man, he comes and claims to be thier uncle-they are forced to live with him. It turns out that his employer is none other than Mr. Bolt(Ray Miland)who wants to use them for his own ends. Tia smells rotten fish (Try Rotten eggs)-she senses very strongly-that Mr Bolt is not a very nice man and she senses danger if they stay at Mr. Bolt's Mansion.
Then, when they dine with Mr. Bolt(I never did say he wasn't a gentleman-just not a very nice one)Mr Bolt tells them that he knows about thier powers and tells them how to make it profitable. After going to another room, Tia & Tony overhear a coversation that MR. Bolt is planning to have them locked away on a deserted island. Tia & Tony then make plans of esacpe.
They do escape and are chased till the end of the film. Helping them is a crusty old man Jason O'Day(Well played by Eddie Albert)Who has a winnebego.
I must say that the Chemistry between Eisenmann & Richards worked so well, people think they are brother & Sister in real life. They are not related in real life. I think it's the acting talents of these two is what made it work so well. Dirctor John Hough(The legend of hell house)did a remarkable job on this film.
The special effects were great for it's time. Some of them were cheezy, but in those days(The 70's)they didn't have computors. But in my opinion, the powers these kids have is not the real story. The real story is that two childern are searching for home, and discovering who they really are. This is the story.
The DVD has some special features on it and an audio commentary by Kim & Ike and John Hough. It provides a lot of insight on how the film was made.",1066003200,10,2216,4.381067961165049
511864,5,630279482X,"I like Escape To Witch Mountain better than any other Disney film. It's probably in the top 5 best kid-movies ever made for that matter. I'm now 36, but was 7 when I first saw it. I probably had a crush on Kim Richards back then but I clearly remember seeing the movie at the theater and loving it.
Looking at the dvd now.. the direction by John Hough is crisp and the effects, though not digital, have loads of SOUL, creativity and charm. When a car full of bad guys wrecks.. the fact that they show the 4 occupants safely getting out of the car is a nice touch (after all kids are watching this).. and that (and lots of other things in this movie) speak to the innocence that still actually existed for those of us lucky to be kids in the 1970s... there was still a common-respect in large parts of society.. kids could be kids .. and all the in-your-face junk that permeates much of the world of kids today was years away...
Back on the subject at hand...I watched the DVD (which is nicely loaded with extras) and was surprised by a couple of moments in the film that clearly ...we'll say INFLUENCED.. a certain Mr. Spielberg years later. One involves a menacing object being shown in a rear-view mirror (like Jurassic Park!). The 2nd is when the Winnebago eludes its chasers (I won't say exactly how!).... looking rather similar (shot for shot!) to a scene in E.T. involving a chase and bicycles. (This film is HUGELY suprior to E.T. by the way!)
But I don't want to get too bogged down in how other movies clearly ripped this great one off!
This film is amazing with it's memorable musical score, acting by Albert and the kids, mystery-unfolding storyline and warm, nicely-done conclusion. The open credit sequence is really good too. Perhaps most of all... it has something that gobs of movies today certainly DO NOT - a great story.
I plan to show it to my 5 year old neice this weekend!
Enjoy it!",1063756800,21,1904,4.442857142857143

511866,5,630279482X,"I just bought my DVD of it today and I love it a lot. I really love the fact that Disney has started to put their old classics on DVD. I had a copy of it on VHS that I bought in 1983 when it was first put out but my VHS has pretty well worn out. This movie is really funny and it is a great movie for all ages.
Here Is A Brief Description.
Tony And Tia are sent to an orphanage after their Foster Parents Die. There they are discovered by Criminal Mastermind Aristotle Bolt. Who draws up fake documents saying that he is their Uncle so he can munipulate their powers for his own financial gain. Well the kids find out and they escape his highly guarded Mid 1800's Los Angeles Manchion. When they are escaping they meet a freindly Camper (Eddie Albert. Who helps them be returned to their Uncle Benie (Denver Pyle). This movie ends with a classic Disney car-chase.
Great Movie 5 Star Rating.",1062460800,10,890,4.2105263157894735
511867,5,630279482X,"My first exposure to the siblings from Witch Mountain was years ago, in watching the sequel Return from Witch Mountain. I loved the film, and was thrilled to discover an earlier film shortly after, Escape to Witch Mountain, which introduces us to Tony and Tia as young children.
I haven't read the book on which this film is based, nor am I likely to, so my review is completely unbiased.
Tony and Tia are two young children whose foster parents have just died. The film begins with their arrival at an orphanage, and it isn't long before we're shown just how different these two children are.
A run-in with the district bully quickly earns them a reputation for 'being a couple of weirdos', but it is in saving the life of a man who would otherwise have been possibly killed in a car accident that their adventures really start.
Claimed as niece and nephew by the very man they saved, they are taken to live in the fortress home of mega-rich Aristotle Bolt, who has been told of the children's gifts and typically wants to exploit them for his own gain.
It doesn't take Tony and Tia long to figure out Bolt's agenda and, after hearing plans to have them locked away in an island tower, they run away with the help of a rogue stallion that no one else was able to tame.
From there, the children soon come across grumpy nomad Jason O'Day, who reluctantly takes them in after they beg him for help.
The rest of the film is probably fairly predictable, given your average Disney plots, but still enjoyable nonetheless. Of course there's going to be a 'happily ever after' (at least until the next movie) but the fun is in seeing how they get there. There are still a few surprises in store before the finish, including an escapee bear, a sheriff who learns the tango the hard way, and a chopper pilot who gets a flying lesson like never before.
Escape to Witch Mountain is thoroughly enjoyable, as is its sequel, and are even better for having Ike Eisemann and Kim Richards play the main characters of Tony and Tia in both films.
On another, distantly related note, Disney did produce another Witch Mountain vignette style show some time later, called Beyond Witch Mountain. The story involved Tony and Tia leaving the Witch Mountain community to find their Uncle Bene's long lost grandson. Bolt and O'Day were both along for the ride, but this was not a patch on the two proper movies, and really shouldn't have been made. Especially since it was meant to be just recently after Tony and Tia found their way to Witch Mountain in the first place, and it portrayed Uncle Bene as dying. (Anyone who has seen Return from Witch Mountain knows full well that Uncle Bene was alive and well in that film, and Tony and Tia were bordering on teenhood, by then)
At the end of this particular episode, Tony and Tia also decide to stay away from Witch Mountain, and go with O'Day to continue searching for survivors. As anyone who has watched the two movies would know, their 'holiday' in the second film was supposed to be their first trip away from the mountain community since their original rescue from the clutches of Aristotle Bolt.
I'm aware that some people have been searching for this particular installment. My advice is, don't bother. It does not fit in with the sequence of films, and does not even have the benefit of the original child actors.
Stick with the excellent and unsurpassed Escape to Witch Mountain, and Return from Witch Mountain. These are fantastic films, and worth every cent.",1058227200,4,3491,4.60513643659711

511901,4,630279482X,"I have seen this movie a lot ever since about 1985 on the Disney Channel and I have caught a recent airing of Escape to Witch Mountain and still not got tired of it. I just love this movie, about two psychic alien kids, Tony and Tia, brother and sister who need to find a way to get back home. They were held prisoner by a creep, they escape and then tagged along by a cranky old guy who reluctantly helped them get back home. At the time I first saw it, I just loved the idea of psychic kids who are able to move things by blowing on a harmonica or Tia's ability to predict the future. I am particularly fond of the scene where the RV floated so they could escape being chased by bad guys, and eventually they trick another bad guy in the helicopter to fly upside down, so in the end, he had to land the chopper on top of its rotors (which is physically impossible to do in real life). When I found out this movie was being remade in the 1990s, I had my biggest fears that they would embarass themselves big time with that remake (after all, with too many remakes, they have to make it ""hip"" for the 1990s by adding rap or alternative rock music to the score and have kids wear baggy pants, but not with this film). Surprisingly that version was well done too and didn't fall in to that trap that I criticize many '90s remakes of 20+ year old films, it was not a copycat of the original with new actors, and a more modern twist, but actually with a different concept (where many different people of different ages were actually aliens). I think what I really like of the 1975 original is the innocence found in the kids that I feel is so sorely missing these days. And that 1978 sequel Return to Witch Mountain was also quite a worthy sequel. If you were a kid who grew up in the 1970s, or you fancy the idea of a movie with psychic kids meant for the whole family, try this, it's one of those few family films that I actually find very watchable and fun.",1015113600,10,1956,4.15
