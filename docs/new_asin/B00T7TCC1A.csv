8700864,2,B00T7TCC1A,"Plot: ""Your nation is corrupt; you have fled from the path that god has set for us all. He will punish all those who live in rebellion."" And with those words, Los Angeles is blown up by religious extremists. This brings about the kind of response you'd expect: liberties (almost all of them) are sacrificed for security. The US becomes a bit like the police state in Half-Life 2, complete with Combine-looking dudes.
So, what is Rz-9? As it turns out, Rz-9 is a dude, not a thing.

PROs
 Great for an evening of cracking some beers with gamer friends and attempting your own Mystery Science Theater 3000. The obvious intent of bringing a mishmash of FPS video games to life on film was humorous.
 When's the last time you sat thru an honest So Bad It Is Good flick? If it's been a while, try Rz-9.
 Although Rz-9 comes across as homemade, its major characters are played by actual actors who've been in other productions (albeit shorts, TV episodes, or videos, with roles such as ""Guard #3"" or ""Bella's Date"").
 20 yo Morgan Obenreder will keep teenage boys attentive (that said, Rz-9 is G-rated in terms of sexuality: if it were rated by the MPAA, it would probably be PG-13 due to tons of violence).
 Some of the effects were decent considering what must have been a meager budget.
 Truth be told, I liked the following Z-list actors: Ethan McDowell, Morgan Obenreder, Charlie Gillette, and Gowrie Hayden. Charlie Gillette reminds me a bit of Rob McElhenney (Mac) from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-Always-Sunny-in-Philadelphia/dp/B000W0DSKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a>.
 Sure to be a cult classic.

CONs
Oh, where to begin. I'm pretty sure the script was written by artificial intelligence (AI). Why so? Because it seems like every single line uttered by the actors is verbatim yanked from some other random production that has a similar scene; unless you've never watched television, it all seems maddeningly familiar. Like the dialogue, the music is so generic that it seems also put together by AI (complete with piano music during the tender brother sister moments). The result? You suffer from bouts of dj vu about every half-second. Even a couple of the actors give you dj vu (but rest assured, you've never seen them in anything before).

Speaking of actors, there's one who director Iain Carson has worked with previously. This actor's bio on IMDb states, ""...after watching movies he would quote lines and reenact scenes in front of his friends and family."" Hmm, well it seems he's still quoting lines and reenacting scenes from movies, this time in Rz-9.

Who was the protagonist? I have no idea! Who was the target audience? I have no idea! Was Rz-9 intended to be a parody? Again, I have no idea. For the sake of all involved, let's hope it was intended to be a parody.

Due to religious imagery, survivalist-type characters, a persecution complex built into the psychology of the script, mention of ""God,"" praying, and churchgoing in conversation, and not a trace of sexuality, I was starting to think Rz-9 was produced by the Christian right... but this may have just been a coincidence.

What of the character Rz-9's fate? By the end, you won't care.",1437782400,,3255,4.99445471349353
