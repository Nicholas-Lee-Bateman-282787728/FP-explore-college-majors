3905453,5,B002C8YSD8,"Princess directed by Anders Morgenthaler is a film that must be made as an animation to protect it young protagonist.  The girl Mia is a 5 year orphan, adopted by her uncle, August. After her porn star mother died.  The little girl doesn't experience the world of the porn star or prostitution during the duration of the film but the aftermath of such things is evident through out.

In one scene early on in the film it is shown that she has been hit, bruises cover her body.  Then a normal moment when the uncle tells the girl to take a bath the girl refuses after we find why she refuses.

The films filled with shocking moments, moments when children pretend to be adults and moments when adults don't act like adults but build rage machines.  August was once a priest sworn to the cloth but now he's trying to start a normal life with his niece, though the rage from his sister's death makes him loose it, and eventually start to systematically kill off the people involved in killing his sister.

This is done with mixing real life super 8 footage of him and his sister shot by August when they were younger.  Starting with the death of their parents to the last days after Mia has been born.  The mix of Super 8 and Animation leaves me with a feeling that the footage is true, and the animation is the fantasy of the artist after the death of his sister.  Making my insides creep and crawl.

This film isn't a comfortable ride, it makes the viewer uncomfortable as often as possible and this isn't done as a shock effect but as a way of showing the damage done to the girl Mia.  In the end its violence and perverted sexuality is inflicting damage to a 5 year old's existence and what that will bring up when the safety of the children around us are forgotten for petty selfishness.

I recommend this film to others, but they must understand with film deals with extreme situations, including language, violence, and sex all involving a child.",1283817600,4,1950,4.459154929577465
3905454,4,B002C8YSD8,"I had been meaning to see this film since it was shown in Istanbul Film Festival few years ago. I had tickets but unfortunately I missed it. Although this film is an animation trust me it is not for children. the story is a straight forward revenge story. The end was very suprising I wasn't expecting the final twist.

I Highly recommend this film to people who are interested in independent films. don't expect mainstream revenge stories to have any parallel to the brutality of this film.",1275177600,3,491,4.64367816091954

8363669,5,B002C8YSD8,"I first saw this film on Netflix and was transfixed by it's use of multimedia, the delightful and ominous animation, and most of all, the complex, terrifying and disturbing narrative. I had several friends watch it. They all had very different reactions. Well, it's time on Netflix expired, and I was bereft. Then I discovered I could buy it on Amazon. Amazing film, like it or hate it, still amazing.",1412467200,2,401,4.742857142857143
8363670,4,B002C8YSD8,"A friend of mine told me to watch this movie a few years ago, then I found it on netflix so I watched it. I wish I had bought it then, this movie is so twisted and disturbing its awesome.

The animation is rough, but it compliments the subject. Do not watch this movie if you don't like to watch anything relating to the subject of porn, that is almost entirely what this movie is about, plus some good old fashioned revenge :)",1392422400,,427,4.144578313253012

8363673,5,B002C8YSD8,"This Danish-German import is a morbid tale of a child of a porn star crack head who picks up mommy's tricks.
I viewed it once and flushed it. It should have an X rating, although the sex isn't as graphic as a pederast would
like, it's suggestively pretty sordid. And certainly not an up-lfting experience.",1308614400,3,305,4.5636363636363635
8363674,4,B002C8YSD8,"August must leave the clergy to find his orphaned niece after his ex-porn star sister dies of an overdose. When realizes that Mia has been repeatedly abused, his mind snaps and he sets out on a murderous rampage against the men that ruined his family's lives. Director Anders Morgenthaler presents this award-winning animated feature out of Denmark, an incredibly violent revenge thriller that is strictly aimed at an adult audience. Morgenthaler's stylized design integrates classical hand-drawn animation with computerized imaging and superimposed film footage to create a truly unique viewing experience. PRINCESS is unrelenting when it comes to shocks and suspense, with tawdry, sexually-explicit material that would have been unfilmable using live actors. In many ways, it resembles an animated version of the Swedish Exploitation classic THRILLER: A CRUEL PICTURE, boasting just as much action and obscenity as Vibenius' notorious film. What makes these vulgar displays acceptable are Morgenthaler's carefully crafted-characters and intricately-laid plot that lead up to August's spiteful vengeance in the end. PRINCESS will not be suitable for all audiences, but it is worth seeking out for fringe film fans.
