8299665,4,B001EWINRU,"Two very nice examples of Film Noir.
Both films have a common theme,
perhaps the most common in the genre:
Beware the allure of the faithless
self-centered beautiful woman
or you may meet your doom.
Same theme, yes, but presented in
completely different ways.

The video quality is also very nice
which is not something that one
takes for granted with these type
of films.

""Quicksand"" is more ""noirish"" in
plot and appearance.
It also features actors
Mickey Rooney and Peter Lorre,
who is in fine mysterious sleazy
form.
Good stuff,
but a disappointing, weak ending.

""Impact"" is also quite good and
will satisfy the Noir fan.
In this case, our afflicted man
is an innocent victim of all but
very bad choice of wife, opposed
to the character portrayed by
Mickey Rooney, whom is foolishly
and easily led to a series of
progressively worse crimes
inspired by his desire for
a woman with virtue issues.

I enjoyed this double feature
a lot.

These films are probably available
on other compilations, but perhaps
not looking as good.",1248652800,8,1030,4.796610169491525
