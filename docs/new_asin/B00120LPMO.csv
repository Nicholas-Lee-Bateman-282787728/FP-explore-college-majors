3071032,3,B00120LPMO,"1)WWE Tag Team Championships: The Miz/John Morrison(c) d. Finlay/Hornswaggle - This match was a decent opener. Miz/Morrison showed some great teamwork as usual. Definately can't believe The Miz had to sell some of the moves he did for Hornswaggle, LOL. Isn't there anybody else tired of the whole Hornswaggle thing. He should of been out the window a long time ago. Morrison gets the pin on Hornswaggle. 5.5/10

2)United States Championship: Matt Hardy(c) d. Chavo Guerrero - This match starts out kind of slow. Guerrero works on Hardy's leg most of the match, but of course Hardy eventually gets the win and retains. 5/10

3)ECW Championship: Mark Henry d. Kane(c) and Big Show - This one was a lot more entertaining than seeing it on paper. Kane goes down early and stays on the outside w/ an injury for most of the match. Some nice spots w/ a body slam on Mark Henry by the Big Show, and also a Superplex to Big Show by Kane...where after Mark Henry hits his splash on Kane to take home the ECW Championship. Bet nobody saw that coming...I'm sure, like me, everybody would of put there money on Big Show going in. 6/10

4)World Tag Team Championships: Ted Dibiase Jr. and ??? d. Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes(c) - Dibiase comes out to the ring and says his partner hasn't arrived yet, but that they can go ahead and start the match cause he will be there. They ring the bell, Holly turns around into a DDT by Cody Rhodes! So obviously, Rhodes turns heel and joins Dibiase. Dibiase gets the three count on Holly. Very interested to see where they go w/ this one. A very short match, but they did what they set out to accomplish. New World Tag Team Champions are Ted Dibiase Jr. and Cody Rhodes!! 5.5/10

5)Intercontinental Championship: Kofi Kingston d. Chris Jericho(c) - It is to be noted that nobody knew Jericho's advisary going in. Kingston comes out and they have an alright contest at best. Would of expected more from these two due to the in-ring talent between them. Surprisingly, HBK comes through the crowd, gives Lance Cade who is in Jericho's corner the Sweet Chin Music. Which, distracts Jericho giving Kingston a roll-up for the victory. 6/10

6)WWE Women's Championship: Mickie James(c) d. Katie Lea Burchill - I was very happy w/ this one. It's nice to see that there really hasn't been a bad women's match on any PPV this year. This one stays in line w/ the rest. I do think they need to ditch Paul Burcill though, It's pretty bad when your manager/sister has better in-ring presence than you, haha. Katie Lea was impressive, didn't expect much from her. Mickie James, in the end, gets the victory. 7/10

7)World Heavyweight Championship: Edge(c) d. Batista - This contest could of went either way. They had plenty of spots near the end where you weren't sure who would win. Probably my favorite between these two. Edge gets the win in a Screwjob fashion. 8/10

8) WWE Championship: Triple H(c) d. John Cena - Triple H definately needed this win more than Cena. These two worked very well together, and put on an entertaining match. Some good submission and Pedigree/FU spots. I though it was just as good as Wrestlemania 22's Main Event, especially since Cena jobs in this one. The only thing WWE did wrong on this one was over-hyping the match. It didn't compare to the Austin/Rock moments or the HBK/Bret Hart moments that were shown in the video package before the match, and WWE should of known that. But w/ that aside, great match and very solid. 8.5/10

Overall Night of Champions was better than my expectations going in. The thing that was great about it was the fact that nobody expected both Edge and Triple H pulling off the victories here. Which, left Raw without a championship, but not for long...",1215216000,3,3733,4.6454545454545455

WWE Tag Team championship
The Mizz and Morrison vs. Finlay and Hornswaggle

This match was better than expected. The crowd was into this match also. Hornswaggle played his part in this match also. I couldn't really tell who was going to win and that's what I like about matches. There was a miss up but it all worked out. Good. Overall  7.5/10

WWE United States championship
Matt Hardy vs. Chavo Gueurruo

This was a disappointment to me. I expected this to be a sort of a high flying match but instead I got a sort of technical match. I don't mind that but these two had no chemistry. Chavo works on Matt's legs pretty good though and nice reversals.
Overall 5.5/10

Triple Threat match for the ECW championship
Kane vs. The Big Show vs. Mark Henry

Pretty much a very slow match. It got even worse that Kane legitly got hurt during the match. I liked spots when Henry got body slammed and the superplex from Kane. I also liked the end of the match. Nice splash. Overall 6/10

Tag Team championship
Cody Rhodes and Hardcore Holly vs. Ted Dibiase and ???????

Heres exactly what happen. Cody tags Holly only to ddt him. Then Ted tells us that Cody is his partner. Ted performs what looks like a million dollar dream slam to win the belts. Horrible choice in choosing partners Teddy. Overall 3/10
( For Dibiase winning the belts like he said)

Intercontinental championship
Chris  Jericho vs. ??????

Chris starts off by saying he takes back what he ever said about saving us. Then we are shown that his secret opponent is the newest superstar to the raw roster: Kofi Kingston. This match was not good but also not bad. I did here some boring chants that started to get real loud. I thought Jericho was not that good here. He felt sort of sluggish. Kofi was really entertaining here. Overall 6/10

WWE Womens championship
Mickie James vs. Katie Lee

This match was also better than expected. Katie worked on Mickies arm through the match. I thought Paul was going to get into the match but he let them do there thing. I also liked the reversal Katie did to Mickie with the arm bar. Good Overall 7/10

World Heavyweight championship
Batista vs. Edge

This match had excitement and suspense. This is my favorite match between these two. It really got good between the end of the match. It really looked like it could happen both ways. Batista really carried his own here. Good match. Overall 8/10

WWE championship
John Cena vs. Triple H

This was a lot better than there match at Wrestlemania 22. This had good reversal. Out of nowhere submission. Finishers after finishers. It was also strange to hear both Cena nad H to get a mixed crowd. Good. 8/10

Eventhough my match ratings are low and I have a four star rating. It is because simply there was more title changes than last year. And also it was more exciting. An improvement.",1214697600,2,2914,4.5585412667946255

(Note-Each DVD I review has a ""Match of the DVD"" award somewhere in it.)

WWE Night of Champions 2008
Night of Champions is a wonderful concept. The entire card has nothing but championship matches. This means no matter how bad a match may be the outcome of it has your interests. This edition of Night of Champions happened six days after the draft; so many superstars have just changed brands. The extras are an interview with Triple H and J.R.'s Farewell Address from the following Raw. This does not include CM Punk winning the World Title though.

WWE Tag Team Championships (Match of the DVD)
John Morrison & The Miz(c) VS Finlay & Hornswoggle
Morrison and Miz are one of my favorite tag teams. They are comedic and put on great athletic contests. Finlay and Hornswoggle are a very fun tag team as well. Finlay is a good wrestling. Hornswoggle is a comic mini-wrestler. Miz and Morrison bully Hornswoggle for most of the match. Hornswoggle hits some impressive offense along the way though. The crowd is definitely into this one.
RATING- 8.5/10

United States Championship
Matt Hardy(c) VS Chavo Guerrero w/Bam Neely
This is a much slower match in comparison to the fantastic opener. Luckily, Neely does not get involved in this match. Chavo works on Hardy's leg for a while before a very good finish. The match is not that exciting though considering who the participants are.
RATING- 6.5/10

ECW Championship
Kane(c) VS Big Show VS Mark Henry
Three giant, slow men in one ring. This match was not very good, as one should expect. Kane is hurt early in the match, which leave Show and Henry to fight it out. Henry and Show move very slow and do not put on a good show. Once Kane returns to the action, the match gets a bit better. The ending is quick and surprising. The winner looks extremely happy. While I do not like him, I am happy for him.
5/10

World Tag Team Championships
Hardcore Holly & Cody Rhodes(c) VS Ted DiBiase & ?
This is not a match. This short segment would turn Rhodes into a much bigger star. The ""match"" is only two moves long. It is surprising, but not worth a rating.
RATING- No Rating

WWE Intercontinental Championship
Chris Jericho(c) VS Kofi Kingston
Kofi just moved from ECW to Raw and was a surprise opponent for Jericho. Both men work hard in this match. Kofi brings a new style to Jericho, and it works well for both men. This is one of the better matches on the card.
RATING- 8/10

WWE Women's Championship
Mickie James(c) VS Katie Lea Burchill
This is just an above average Women's match. The match is slow. Burchill controls most of the match. There are better Women matches out there though.
RATING- 6/10

World Heavyweight Championship
Edge(c) VS Batista
Batista had just moved to Raw. If he won, he would take the title with him. This created some excitement. This is another slow match the never really picks up. The match is decent until the ending. The match turns into more of a segment than a match in the finish.
RATING- 7/10

WWE Championship
Triple H(c) VS John Cena
Overhyped matches rarely ever deliver in quality. This match had been hyped up as a match that would ""transcend time."" Considering the low quality of their Wrestlemania 22 match, I was not expecting much. This match is much better than that match though. They play off the evenness of Triple H and Cena in strength. Triple H works on Cena's back while Cena works on Triple H's leg. The match really picks up in the closing moments.

WWE Tag Team Championship:
John Morrison & The Miz (Champions) V. Finlay & Hornswoggle
This match really didn't get pick up until near the end. It was watchable and all, but the first part of this match really dragged. The champs retain. **/12

WWE United States Championship:
Matt Hardy (Champion) V. Chavo Guerrero
This effort just wasn't here in this one. They really didn't look like they wanted to have a good match. Just nothing noteworthly here with Hardy retaining. **

Triple Threat Match for the ECW Championship:
Kane (Champion) V. Big Show V. Mark Henry
Actually not bad. I was surprised. Kane & Show took Henry out and had a good match and even when Henry was in there is wasn't that bad either which is scary. Henry wins the title because of what happened at WrestleMania weekend. ***

World Tag Team Championship:
Hardcore Holly & Cody Rhodes (Champions) V. Ted DiBiase & ???
Interesting booking. DiBiase's partner is...CODY RHODES??? ok. Rhodes turns on Holly and DiBiase gets the pin and wins the titles. DUD Watch out of Ted DiBiase Jr folks...give him two or three years and we are talking WORLD CHAMPION!!!!! You'll see.

WWE Intercontinental Championship:
Chris Jericho (Champion) V. Kofi Kingston
good match here with good moves by Kofi. Michaels interferes and Kofi hits his finisher and wins the title! ***1/4

WWE Women's Championship:
Mickie James (Champion) V. Katie Lea Burchill
WOW...very good women's match with nice...moves and all. I would give my left foot to be with Mickie....oh sorry. Anyways...it was a fine women's wrestling match. One of the best in a while. Mickie retains. ***1/4

World Heavyweight Championship:
Edge (Champion) V. Batista
Very, very good match here. I wasn't expecting much because their matches last year sucked, but this one was a surprise. The beginning and middle, all though nothing special happened, had enough to keep me watching and the ending was just great. Edge retains ***3/4

WWE Championship:
Triple H (Champion) V. John Cena
NOT AS GOOD AS WRESTLIEMANIA 22!!!!!! In my opinion of course. This match started at the same way 22 did but then turned into a spotfest. Yet there was drama and all, but the storytelling just wasn't there like in 22 and the predictable Triple H win didn't help either. ****

overall, I agree with that the first half of this show wasn't good to a point. The ECW Championship was better than expected and DiBiase's partner was surprising. The second half was much better with two great World Title matches. A much better event than last year's for sure.",1220227200,,2630,4.918735891647856

8243274,3,B00120LPMO,"Before I review this DVD, I'd like to give some personal background first.

Since October 2007, I think WWE has been on a very strong roll.  Rivalries were built steadily, and delivered come PPV time.  We were getting a good dose of comedy, violence, and technical wrestling.  But then the WWE Draft happened...not only were the roster changes shocking (and not in a good way), but they put a strange spin on the NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS PPV.  To add insult to injury, Vince McMahon decided to get incapacitated for the 2nd consecutive Draft.  His ""injury"" was not only a sick anniversary joke, but it was a premonition: The consistent cycle of good WWE product was about to end.

NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS 2008, while successful in some areas, is the PPV marker of when things have gone sour.

1) WWE Tag Team Championships
John Morrison & The Miz (champions) v. Finlay & Hornswoggle
---If you're expecting a tag classic when one of the competitors is a dwarf, you're missing the point.  From the opening bell, the match maintained a good pace, with some midget spots, smart teamwork, and crowd-pleasing maneuvers.  Is it a great match?  Certainly not.  But I was entertained from start to finish.
""6.5 / 10""
---------------------------------------

2) United States Championship
Chavo Guerrero v. Matt Hardy (champion)
---This was a tough one to call.  I love both of these guys, and I admired this particular match because both men look like they were  always trying to win.  There were no unnecessary high-risk spots or flashy counters.  The two engaged in a smart contest with quick pinfall attempts and submission holds.  What held it back for me was a ton of little things.  The occasional weak clothesline, or those few punches that didn't connect, or that predictable counter...you know, just small stuff that added up after a while.  Worth a watch, but kinda sloppy considering the talent involved.
""6.5 / 10""
---------------------------------------

3) ECW Championship
Mark Henry v. Big Show v. Kane (champion)
---Boy, this turned out way worse that I thought it would.  While I don't usually like ""big man"" matches, I understand they appeal to some.  But frankly, judging by the Dallas crowd, it's gotta be a small demographic.  The whole affair was a slow, plodding affair that had very little excitement.  Kane's not even in most of the match!  Maybe he was legitimately hurt, but you wouldn't know it after he got involved in those pseudo-exciting last few minutes.  If you're still pining for the old ECW, you better move on quick.
""3.5 / 10""

4) World Tag Team Championships
Hardcore Holly & Cody Rhodes (champions) v. Ted Dibiase & ???
---Even if I paid the $40 fee to watch this, I'd still think it was worth my time.  The whole scenario was so well-executed.  Dibiase's music, entrance, and delay tactics were perfect.  The ""match"" was quick, as wrestling double-crosses should be.  Yes, I'm disappointed that there was no actual match.  But Dibiase needed this moment to get on the map.  The new World Tag Team champs are better off because of this PPV moment.
""No Score""

***Right about here, JBL cut a promo from his luxury skybox in the arena.  Interestingly enough, I found this to be one of the PPV's highlights.  I'm not a fan of JBL's in-ring skills, but on the microphone, few are his equal.  He berated Todd Grisham and the fans for not being considered a champion.  Throw in a spectacular camera angle where JBL towered over the background arena, and I think WWE deserves a few bonus points.***

5) Intercontinental Championship
Chris Jericho (champion) v. Kofi Kingston
---After our cocky IC champ cuts a promo to further his Shawn Michaels feud, ""The Jamaican Sensation"" reveals himself to be the mystery opponent.  Sadly, I can't believe this match wasn't better than it turned out to be.  Jericho is one of the all-time greats in professional wrestling, and Kingston is so unorthodox in the ring - I was really looking forward to this one.  Like the U.S. Title bout, there are so many moments where things were just off.  Again, little things missed strikes or unimpressive high-risk moves.  There was even a ""BORING"" chant in the middle somewhere.  The last couple minutes were exciting with nice counters and close pinfalls.  Plus, the aftermath involving HBK was intriguing if a bit weird.  All in all, this one looked better on paper.
""6.5 / 10""

6) Women's Championship
Mickie James (champion) v. Katie Lea Burchill
---At this point, NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS has reached it's hour-and-a-half mark.  Thankfully, for the next 70 minutes, the event will be worth your time.  I've been really into the resurging women's division for months now, and if this one doesn't impress you, nothing will.  I don't know much about Katie Lea, but after this impressive showing, I'm gonna do some research.  Mickie James is one of the most reliable Divas, both in character and in-ring performance.  The match includes some nice counter-wrestling, and very good submission-storytelling.  Good wrestling, good length, good pace, good match.
""7.0 / 10""
---------------------------------------

7) World Heavyweight Championship
Edge (champion) v. Batista
---Yes, these two had an almost identical scenario at last year's NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS.  However, that also means Edge and Batista had one of the evening's best matches.  Edge is so gifted that I will never get tired of him being involved with the championship.  Batista has come a long way over the past year or so, and Edge complements him as well as anyone (even Undertaker).  The best part about this contest is that it never slowed down too much, meaning both men got a good amount of time to control the pace.  The match did feel a little short, and I'm not 100% satisfied with the screwy finish.  But rest of the match featured a nice slow build-up, and some new tricks that these hadn't shown me before.  Overall, a very good showing.  I'd love to these two go at it again.
""7.5 / 10""

8) WWE Championship
John Cena v. Triple H (champion)
---As most have probably said, this main event was similar to the WRESTLEMANIA 22 showdown.  The contest was very slow-paced and methodical.  The focus was on the reversals and psychology, and not so much on the physical action.  If that's not your cup of tea, then pass the DVD up.  As for myself, I sat back and went for the ride.  There are a couple of reasons why this match works, where other similar angles fall flat.  Triple H, like him or not, is one of the most prolific WWE superstars; this 12th run as champion is arguably his most successful.  John Cena has been criticized for his ""lack of talent.""  I disagree there, because Cena is an amateur wrestling champion, which he demonstrated during his first few months on WWE TV.  Instead, Cena loses me when he overplays his underdog character.  But on this NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS showdown, the fight is more evenly-matched.  Both men made each other look good, and even though Cena still didn't use a lot of moves, he kept the match going.  What's most remarkable is that this rematch makes the WM 22 encounter better.  I don't think I understood the Chicago storytelling at the time (partly because it wasn't the ""true"" main event).  But now, like a good sequel, I can appreciate the original.  To my astonishment, my favorite match of the PPV.

OVERALL
---NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS 2008 might be worth a peek for some fans.  It's full of surprises that still work, and has a good overall feel to it.  The Dallas crowd was reacting to the matches, the production crew used some good camera angles, and the last three matches delivered.  But fans who are into physical wrestling more than the ""E"" in WWE better look elsewhere.",1219190400,8,7931,4.963525835866261
8243275,3,B00120LPMO,"Night Of Champions is the one night of the year where WWE is suppost to put focus on all the championships they have...however, last years event turned out to be a complete waste (and that's not even including the Benoit situation) but WWE learned their lesson & put together a better card this year & delivered better quality.

WWE Tag Team Champions John Morrison & The Miz vs. Finlay & Hornswoggle - This was one of those matches that you have to look at it for what it was to enjoy it.  Hornswoggle's purpose was to have some comedic moments & put over Morrison & Miz as bully-type heels which was acomplished in the end.  It was an entertaining opener that did it's job in getting the crowd into it.

United States Champion Matt Hardy vs. Chavo Guerrero - Chavo focused on Hardy's leg & even pulling out Lance Storm's old ""rollover into a half crab"" move but in the end, this was just an average match.

ECW Champion Kane vs. Big Show vs. Mark Henry - Before I get started, if you look closely at the banners of championships they have held up...you'll notice that the ECW Title banner is just the old Cruserweight Title banner with ECW logo on the belt.  TALK ABOUT LOW BUDGET!!!
Anyways, the match got off to a bad start with Kane hurting his leg in the beginning leaving Henry & Show to go at it for a while with a highlight happening in Big Show scoop slamming Mark Henry.  In the end, Mark Henry capitalized on Kane & Show's superplex to gain the ECW Title.  Not bad for a guy who got Mae Young pregnant.

World Tag Team Champions Hardcore Holly & Cody Rhodes vs. Ted Dibiase & ? - This was more of a segment than a match as Rhodes turned on Holly to win the tag team titles.

Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho vs. Kofi Kingston - This was a good athletic match between the two that went back & forth which saw Kofi get the upset with help from a cameo appearence from Shawn Michaels.

Womens Champion Mickie James vs. Katie Lee Burchill - very similar to the previous chavo/hardy match in that it was just average at best with katie working on mickie's arm thoughout the bout.

World Champion Edge vs. Batista - No, it's not deja vu...you are seeing the exact same match they did last year...with the only difference being that this years was better.  This was another match that went back & forth between each one with Batista putting forth a strong effort with his power offense while Edge does what he does best in the ring.  If you can get past the crap ending, good encounter from these two.

WWE Champion Triple H vs. John Cena - As it was hyped up for leading up to the PPV, the rematch from WrestleMania 22 with the roles reversed as Triple H walks in as the champion.  The match itself wasn't fast paced but solid as each man throughout the match tried to establish dominance & psych each other out with the story of Triple H's bad knee coming into play midway & the crowd getting more into it as the match went on, this was I felt was better than their WrestleMania 22 match however all that was missing was that rabid crowd they had back in Chicago.

DVD extras include J.R.'s farewell address to RAW (which for some reason didn't include everything that happened afterwards) & a great Triple H interview that puts Cena over even in defeat.

In the end, this wasn't on the same level of quality as all the events from WrestleMania to One Night Stand but it was surely the best effort for this PPV (formely Vengeance) I've seen since 2005 so I would recommend.",1218067200,3,3487,4.396578538102644
