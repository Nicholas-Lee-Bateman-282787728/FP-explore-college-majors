4290018,4,B0049GYXE0,"Our baby has been watching animated nursery rhymes since 3 months and I purchased baby Einstein while she was close to 5 months. By that time we had shown her hooplakidz and kids camp and giggle bellies, which she had become acustumed to and showing this DVD in particular was almost a let down for her after showing those more upbeat musical videos. Also the real life pictures of babies and toys don't really keep her interest as much as the animation does. So I give the product a thumbs up, just not for every infant.",1360886400,,521,4.4375
4290019,5,B0049GYXE0,Good price for a 3 part product. My great-granddaughter loves the sheep puppet in the baby Einstein DVDS.  I was a bit disappointed in the size of the book.,1360454400,,156,4.379310344827586
4290020,4,B0049GYXE0,"This was a fine and entertaining video. I wish the DVD was widescreen for my portable DVD player and HDTV. The CD is a great addition and can be used in the car for long trips. Keep in mind the CD is not very long so the music gets pretty repetitive. It would have been nice if the CD was just the audio track from the video, it is a selection of songs in individual tracks.",1356307200,,374,3.9342105263157894
4290021,3,B0049GYXE0,The item was shipped and received on time with no damage.  My grandaught watches it but im not sure she likes it all that much. she is four months,1353715200,,146,4.0344827586206895
4290022,5,B0049GYXE0,"This is a great value. It comes with a DVD that my baby loves, along with a cd (that we haven't had much use for yet), and a cute little book. The DVD keeps my 3-month old's attention and helps her fall asleep. I like that when the DVD is over, the music keeps playing until you turn it off. That helps my baby stay asleep as well.",1351814400,2,331,3.8823529411764706
4290023,5,B0049GYXE0,"All the Baby Einstein videos are amazing! Ever since our little one was born we have put these on in the mornings to get his little senses going and he is one of the most happiest babies I've ever known (not partial or anything :). He smiles at the skits in the shows and laughs at the funny parts and just watches so intently on the rest of the show like a little sponge absorbing it all.  He can't get enough!! Now at 1 year old he is extremely alert, understands so many words and is one of the best babies his daycare has.  He actually has an attention span where as many 1yr olds don't.  He can sit and play with a toy for a good 15 minutes and then find another one.  He is independent and is clearly expressive (not a tantrum thrower)about what he wants and understands interactions between himself and adults as well as other children.  He likes other videos and children's shows but Baby Einstein is the only one he watches like its going out of style.  I'd recomend just about any of the dvd's!!!",1346198400,3,1006,4.268421052631579
4290024,5,B0049GYXE0,"I had always just used the music CD that comes with this to calm my 8 month old down at nap/bed time because I don't really like for him to watch TV.  He always liked it, but it wasn't anything extraordinary.  One day, however, I accidentally put in the DVD (we use a TV/DVD combination to play CDs in his room because we don't have a separate CD player), and my son was immediately entranced.  He absolutely loves watching the pictures on the screen, and it has yet to fail to put him to sleep (without any crying or fussing at all).  Now, I'm just trying to use it sparingly so the he doesn't get addicted!",1328572800,5,608,4.2155172413793105
4290025,3,B0049GYXE0,Is very good for an infant but not for me. I haven't been able to see it til the end yet i get easily distracted.,1322179200,,113,3.56

8419060,3,B0049GYXE0,I played this for my two month old a couple times and she seemed interested for 10 minutes each time. Then a nurse told me that babies shouldn't watch tv for at least one year and preferably 2 years. I haven't played it for her since. I removed stars from the rating bc I was not able to find an age recommendation anywhere on the package.,1393718400,,339,4.151515151515151
8419061,4,B0049GYXE0,Our 4 month old loves it to go to sleep to.  The images on the video are strangeley put but it seems to garner the attention needed.  I expected a higher quality production of video but you can't complain when it captivates your child.,1384473600,,235,4.318181818181818
8419062,2,B0049GYXE0,"My baby is 5 months old and on the first try watching this DVD he got very bored about halfway through. It's just very slow moving and he didn't seem to care for it at all. The DVD not having a repeat function is also a problem.
He loves the other Baby Einstein DVDs that we have (Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven) and I highly recommend those for young babies, but this one, not so much.",1384214400,,386,4.092105263157895

NICE THE DVD IS GOOD PICTURES, MUSIC, SONGS, AND GOOD COLORS",1383609600,,103,3.6818181818181817
8419064,5,B0049GYXE0,My grandbaby loves it just like all the other Baby Einstein products.  He sits and watches and sometimes dances to the music.  He is fascinated.,1373241600,,144,4.72
8419065,4,B0049GYXE0,This is nice and relaxing if you're trying to get your child/children to settle down a little for the night time wind down routine. The kids love the little board book that comes with this set and the music CD is nice to have as a backup in the car if you need some music for them to listen to.,1370995200,,294,3.9166666666666665
8419066,5,B0049GYXE0,"My daughter loves to watch this at bedtime to relax and settle in for the night. It really helps. The music is fantastic and the images are too cute, including sleeping babies, kittens and puppies.",1364169600,,197,4.6571428571428575
