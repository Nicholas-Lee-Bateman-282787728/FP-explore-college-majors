8115181,5,B000EWOO3I,"This is a six-episode dramatic series on the early Roman Emperors roughly from the succession of Tiberius to the succession of Claudius. Its British, Its from 1968. Its in Black and White with not that great a quality. But if you like this sort of thing (I Claudius & the like), its really exceptional and special. Its also sometimes a different take on the material that what was done by Robert Graves in ""I Claudius"". Often its in far more shades of grey than is usually the case. Its also more traditional in terms of a focus on high politics than most things covering these subjects made in more
recent times.

The take on Germanicus is rather original. There is an entire episode devoted to him and his relationship with Tiberius. The focus is on Tiberius treating him seriously as a potential successor and trying to educate him through experiences. Trying to grow him from thinking like a soldier to thinking like an emperor. Its excellent in showing the many weaknesses of someone like Germanicus that go along with the strengths. Tiberius comes across as a much more human character in the series than the usual portrayal. There is also a good portrayal of the good and bad sides of Augustus. The do a good job in showing how he combined a easygoing personality in public with utter ruthlessness as the situation required.

Caligula is more serious and more menacing than John Hurt's very over the top performance in ""I Claudius"".

Claudius is also treated as a more serious character in the series than is usual as well.

Both the writing and the acting in the series are very good. Its very much ""classic"" TV, but for anyone who ever wanted more stories from this time period, this is really something to seek out.",1503964800,2,1725,4.6644736842105265
