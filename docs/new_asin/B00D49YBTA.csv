5773802,5,B00D49YBTA,Wetted my desire to see the series. DCI Banks is very emotional for a police officer... The Yorkshire countryside can look like scences from Midsomer Murders.,1379116800,9,158,5.115384615384615
5773803,4,B00D49YBTA,"Unlike my fellow Amazon Top 100 reviewer, K Harris (whose reviews I admire) , I was unfamiliar with the character of Chief Inspector DC Banks before seeing this film. Research after watching this DVD (I'm not a fan of ""spoilers""  and trusted the BBC label to give me a good detective story) I learned that this was a two-part ""pilot"" for a series that ran two seasons. (It was edited into one 90 minute ""film"" - I did notice a brief ""pause"" in the middle).  So, if you are new to the character, I can only recommend that - like any good mystery - you go in knowing as little as possible before watching it.

There is a murder (in fact a few) and they are bloody (no spoiler here) and the story is told using flashback at points (in a creative way). The only thing that made me drop a star in my rating is that the action takes time out for a ""romantic interlude"" which detracts from the flow. (At least for me.)

The film is based on a novel (which I guess gets expanded in the subsequent ""series"", which I pan to look into watching; the main character did interest me.).

The DVD has no special features - just scene index and subtitle option (in case the accents are too thick for you.).

This is one of those crime series that the British do so well. Actually it was created by the commercial ITV Network but aired on cable on the BBC America channel and now released on the BBC Home Entertainment imprint.

If you want to know more about the plot I'll refer you to K's review. He covered it very well (though be prepared for ""spoilers"").

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5773857,5,B00D49YBTA,"For ,those of us who are Peter Robinson fans of his books festuring DCI Alan Banks, we were overjoyed to see him come to life in the ITV series. DCI Banks is the head of detectives in the Yorkshire area, and all if the cases take place in these surroundings. We see the city, the country and everything in between.

Alan Banks look like a morose character with not much personality. Stephen Tompkinsin plays Banks. Ah, no, not true., he gas a rich life sometimes. Once married, he has a grown daughter, and in some episodes she is very much present. He lives in a lovely house, and his lives arecwine and music. You may find him at night in his study with wine listening to his favorite music. His other life is his job, and he is good at it. You may be surprise to hear he with his team solves every case.

Andrea Lowe, the beautiful blonde, impetuous at times, plays DS Annie Cabot. She flits in and out if Banks life as his sometime lover. An excellent detective, but makes hasty decisions. DI Morton, played by Carolyn Catz, a lovely brunette, wears a severe haircut. Does not allow emotion into much of her life. She is often brusque with people, needs to learn social skills, and I wonder if she In on the Autism spectrum. She is brilliant and most often correct. I like her best. The Team investigates their crimes, digs up all of the facts and solves every crime. A lot of murder and mayhem, abound.

5773953,5,B00D49YBTA,"This is the forerunner to the season one.....I loved it.  Very gritty and scary, but a must watch.  You won't be disappointed.  Excellent British television....down to earth.",1408579200,,174,5.37037037037037
5773974,5,B00D49YBTA,A good story line,1408320000,,17,3.5
5773975,2,B00D49YBTA,"This is the pilot of the DCI Banks series, and it's not included in the U.S. DVD set of the first season -- perhaps Aftermath is considered Season Zero. In any case, I found the story quite uninteresting despite its sensational subject matter: Five girls are missing, and by chance police break in on what they think is a domestic violence case but is actually the home of the killer and rapist, for in fact four of the five girls are in the basement, and the perpetrator's wife lies beaten upstairs. During the resulting confrontation, one of the discovering policemen is killed.

It's a brutal but promising start to a grim drama, but in the end the main plot thread is pretty simple, and in fact the police sort out almost everything rather early, except for the whereabouts of the presumed fifth victim, a mystery which is solved through brute force rather than deductive skill. In the meanwhile, there are side plots involving a concerned father who's also a sleazeball, a neighbor who is more involved than we initially suspect, and police politics.

At the end of the day, as I said, the plot is actually rather simple and not that interesting, and the side-plots don't had a whole lot, either. The characters are complex, but frankly that of Annie is rather repulsive, and Banks himself doesn't come off well, either. She's ambitious and amoral, while he is too impulsive. My wife has read some of the novels on which these television dramas are based, and according to her, in many instances some significant changes have been made. Be  that as it may, although I thought the Season One set was good, this pilot stinks just a bit, to my taste.",1408147200,4,1652,4.670103092783505
5773976,5,B00D49YBTA,"Have not watched it yet, but the story sounded so good I had to buy it to see if I liked it.",1406332800,,92,3.227272727272727
5773977,5,B00D49YBTA,very good introduction to the DCI Banks series.  ordered series one because of this.,1405036800,,84,5.0
5773978,5,B00D49YBTA,Love the series and the actors.  Wish American TV would produce more series like this one.,1404691200,,90,4.625
5773979,5,B00D49YBTA,"The pilot of the DCI Banks series. Sick and twisted, some nudity, wonderful plot. All in all a very intense watch.",1403827200,,114,4.476190476190476
5773980,4,B00D49YBTA,"As the first episode in the DCI Banks series, this introduces you to the characters around a fairly grisly plot.  Young women have gone missing in a Yorkshire town.  A neighbor hears a scream, reports domestic violence and a bad scene unfolds.  The character of DCI Banks (Stephen Tompkinson) is fairly likable and goes from compassionate to brooding in 60 seconds.  Probably a dark personal backstory you think.  You feel the character of DCI Banks will grow on you, but it's a slow build.  That's okay - there are more episodes to get to know him better.  This series is based upon the mystery novels of Peter Robinson.  Films based upon novels always seem deeper and richer in detail.  Although this episode contains more gore and than I usually like, will watch more in the series.  For anglophiles + mystery lovers, you may want to sample this somewhat dark series.",1403740800,,870,4.74
5773981,5,B00D49YBTA,This is the first in this series and we found it to be extremely compelling. Would recommend highly if you love detective crime dramas. 2 more volumes soon to be released.,1400976000,,171,4.548387096774194

5774014,5,B00D49YBTA,"I've read ALL of the DCI Banks books, they are very dark and complex stories with dozen's of local characters and plenty of Red Herrings just like PD James, although the TV series had to cut a lot of the plot to make it fit into a 90 minute show they kept the heart of the story very well.
Are the books better ? of course (the audiobooks are great too, really good narrators) but this is a fine job of adaptation, great acting, scenery and local flavor.",1393804800,11,454,4.170454545454546

5774019,5,B00D49YBTA,I love British Crime Dramas because they rely on acting and writing as opposed to special effects or just blood and gore violence.  There seems to be better and more real detective work going on.  I am a bit biased as I just love English mysteries.,1392076800,3,248,4.369565217391305
5774020,1,B00D49YBTA,"I have read all of the DCI Banks books (some twice).  I feel like the characters are old friends and I have definite images of what they should look like.  I was pleased that Banks was coming to life on the screen, but very disappointed when I watched Aftermath.  I like the actor chosen to play Banks, but NOT in this role.  From the descriptions, I see Banks as being more suave and looks kind of like Hugh Laurie or Hugh Grant - Michael Renney from the old films would be perfect.  So, although I like the actor in everything else, he isn't Alan Banks for me and I felt that the story line was flat.  It might be considered good if you don't already feel a kinship to the characters.",1389830400,,686,4.198473282442748

5774068,2,B00D49YBTA,"I watched a few of the series DCI Banks.  I was very disappointed with it mainly because the character Banks in the show is absolutely nothing like the character in the books.  Banks comes to Yorkshire with his wife from London, for one.  Banks in the novels is short;  the TV banks is tall.  I could go on.  I just have to say that this series is a disgrace to the novels and its author.",1383177600,,388,4.1066666666666665
5774069,4,B00D49YBTA,"I have not come across the writings of  Peter Robinson nor previously seen any of the adaptations made for British TV. However good (or poor) the books may be,  these adaptations meet the Brits high standard of production displayed in their better mystery-detective series. These are sober, serious approaches to law enforcement and the consequences of crime for the public, the criminal, and the police officers involved. As one will never confuse Morse with Frost, one will not confuse DCI Banks with any other of the elite fictional-amateur or professional-televised crime-fighters. His character, as it appears in this stand-alone, two episode story (90 minutes), is distinctive. As with some of the others, the central foci of the professional and the private person, are often at war with each other; he is anything but a robotic instrument of justice. That makes him interesting. The lead is admirably played by a performer who makes his character apppear as a seasoned professional who is still very much human. There are some other quite adept actors/actresses, providing support, but  I will have to go to Season 1 (which Amazon writes is in pre-sale now) to know just who has made the grade to be permanent.
I don't know about the forthcoming series, but feel confident that regular viewers of the more serious British Imports will find this one worthy of an audience over here in the U.S.",1382400000,3,1400,5.0
5774070,4,B00D49YBTA,"and this series can really grow on  you.  Aftermath was the pilot of this episode and it's a chilling introduction to Alan Banks. Stephen Tompkinson plays a decent man besieged on all sides struggling to solve a horrifying series of murders.  From the family of one of the victims, to the criminals and his own colleagues, all are trying to manipulate him.

I give this only four stars simply because it's not the best of British crime fiction, especially when compared to series like Foyle's War, or Sherlock but compared to American crime drama, this is  very superior show.",1382054400,16,576,4.777777777777778
