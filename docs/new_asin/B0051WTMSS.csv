8453335,4,B0051WTMSS,I saw this movie when I was only 7 or 8 years old and always wanted to see it again.  It is a fun movie and reminds me of the vintage professional wrestling era.,1444262400,,161,3.735294117647059

8453337,3,B0051WTMSS,"Not a blockbuster but a rare film from the early B-Studios.  Jack Carson, always funny is a support to the first film appearance of television's Dr. Ben Casey (Vince Edwards). The ""Mr. Universe"" contest was an early glimpse into what bodybuilding guru, Joe Weider would take it.",1380672000,,278,4.914893617021277
8453338,4,B0051WTMSS,"I doubt that this was a favorite film for Mr. Carson. He apparently did not like his prat fall, dopey comedic parts. But it was great fun for me as he played off a very young Vince Edwards and wonderful actor Bert Lahr. My favorite scene was when Edwards' s character,Mr. Universe, thinks he is helping Carson stay awake by manually forcing Carson to exercise. Film quality is not good, but then it was low budget and made in 1951. I love Jack Carson and was not disappointed. He was an amazing actor who died way too young from stomach cancer.

And, yet, Mr. Carson's catalogue of films is quite extensive and impressive.",1375574400,,622,4.504424778761062
8453339,5,B0051WTMSS,"The quality of this DVD isn't what I would call full restored but it has been impossible for me to find a copy so just finding it on Amazon was a major discovery. The movie was a low budget film and it shows but the pacing is fast and there are lots of funny bits along the way plus the Cowardly Lion - Bert Lahr and a sullen Vince Edwards. This movie told it like it really was about ""professional"" wrestling not that it has changed much.",1362096000,4,439,4.057471264367816
8453340,4,B0051WTMSS,"I picked this up because I like Jack Carson movies, which is why I gave it 4 stars.
(There's really nothing to comment on about the plot/synopsis, since it's on the product page.)
It's a light ""confection"" of a movie - a nice Saturday morning ""no-brainer"" of a film.
In other words, don't go looking for any Oscar-winning performances, writing or direction.

The big thing, and the reason why I'm even bothering to post a review here, is to provide something of a ""heads-up"" to those of you who might be wondering (as I did) about the print/transfer.
Prior to this purchase I had no movies in my library by Synergy, the company that has made this film available. Now I know why. The quality of the print/transfer is really poor.
To give you an idea of how bad it it is, the film looks a copy of one that's been in the public domain that was then recorded off of a local station (without the commercials, of course) and then transferred to dvd.
Assuming that this is the quality of whatever they Synergy has in their library of films, I will probably look to avoid other films (if there are any) on the label.

Film: 4 stars
Print/Transfer: 1 star",1320192000,6,1146,4.42654028436019
