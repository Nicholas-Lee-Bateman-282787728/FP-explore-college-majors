8446358,2,B003GM2NJ0,"Man-su's a poor fishmonger who only wants the best for his son. He borrows a large sum of money from the local mob to move to a nice apartment in Gangnam to give his son the best chance of getting into SNU. Little did he know, his new apartment was directly opposite the apartment of four hapless gangsters. Before long it becomes a tug of war between Man-su and the gang-leader Kang-du of who will die first, who should move out and who's the better parent?
All-in-all it's the most basic story ever told and in the forst 30 minutes has some of the worst slapstick ever seen in a film outside Hollywood's 'Not another...' franchise. Luckily they ditched the slapstick pretty early on and kept the pratfalls and fights a bit more realistic.
It was quite a shock to find that Jo Jae-hyeon (who played Man-su) is a regular in Kim Ki-duk's films, seeing as this film was such a poorly written, predictable film.
This aside, there was enough story and genuinely very funny moments to keep me from getting bored, so I won't talk it down too much. Just don't expect any interesting plot development or well written scenarios, they clearly had to keep to a time limit.

On another note, the image of the DVD cover on here (the brown one with the horse) I have no idea what the hell this is. It's for the right film but I don't understand the horse or anything else on the cover.",1357257600,,1371,4.4189723320158105
