2665443,5,B000J10KN2,"I love doing this dvd workout.  Jillian is no nonsense and this will give you results if you stick to it and do it three, maybe four times a week.
There are circuits here that go from cardio to toning.  This really is for beginners because she explains to you (in easy to understand way) why you do a particular movement and exactly how to do it.  It makes you feel like you are in the gym with her.  You need an x-ertube and weights; anything else is optional.  So this makes this easy to do.  You don't need heaps of space, but to make it easier still, probably best to alternate these (unless it's a weekend day where you may have lots of time to put them together - that would be a fantastic workout).  One thing that experienced home workout exercisers will notice big time, is that there is no music.  I can see how that's beneficial for the beginner, but for someone who knows what they are doing, likes to have some music going on to keep them going.  I do like this, and while I'm more experienced than this is aimed for, I saw my friend do this and for a beginner like them, it was perfect.",1181865600,91,1100,4.1753554502369665
2665444,5,B000J10KN2,"I have tried several different work out videos and nothing compares to this one. I am not a very cordinated person, I am one who has little or no rhythem. Most workout videos are fast pace and I cannot do fast areobics or jazzersize movements so when I tried this I was amazed how easy I could do it. I have never really done cicuit workouts before even though I knew what they were. And since I am so out of shape this is a great work out for beginners. It works everything at a low impact pace. You will be sore but not the sore like working out to hard in a gym. You can do these dvds forever because it shows you different ways of doing the exercises for when you become more advanced. You get your cardio and weights or stregnth training all in one easy work out. I would reccomend this to anyone beginner or advanced needing a good full body work out with cardio too.",1179100800,19,873,4.141176470588236
2665445,4,B000J10KN2,"Since I am a personal trainer, I am always looking for new ideas.  I thought this dvd was one that gets the job done for beginners.  A good interval to get the heart rate up followed by a strength exercise.  The weakest part of the video was the abs section.  This dvd has more instruction than her other dvds so it will be helpful for inexperienced exercisers.",1178409600,20,361,4.343283582089552
2665446,5,B000J10KN2,This DVD set is just what I was looking for.  I was searching for a complete body workout and this is it.  Frontside can be done one day and Backside can be done another day (approximatley 45 minutes each).  I actually do both all in one day -- approximately a 2-hour workout.  Some of the exercises are unique -- ie. King sqauts -- boy do you feel the burn.  You will not be sorry.,1177804800,16,382,4.108108108108108
2665447,5,B000J10KN2,"I LOVE this workout!  Jillian is MUCH more encouraging in this workout than in her previous ones.  I also love the clean white set - no clutter to distract me from a good, solid workout.  The exercises on both workouts are circuit style, incorporating both strength training and aerobic movements, and both workouts give you a nice full body workout - but the exercises in each workout are different:  FRONTSIDE targets the muscles in the chest & shoulders (also works abs and triceps); BACKSIDE focuses on strengthening your back and firming your butt (it also hits the biceps!)  The instruction is excellent; this one's a keeper!",1171065600,148,631,4.915094339622642
2665448,4,B000J10KN2,"I really enjoy Jillian's other workout videos so I was excited to try this one.  This video is not like her other ones.  It's just her and a person from Biggest Loser tv show performing the exercises.

No fancy set, no music and much slower paced.  I really thought it was going to be too slow for a circuit training workout but I was wrong.  Not only do I burn (according to my heart rate monitor) between 500 - 600 calories from each session, but I've been really sore the next two days after each workout - and I have been working out with weights for almost a year now.

As you are doing the execises, she is constantly reminding you about your form and why it needs to be done a certain way. I have even learned some new weight lifting exercises from this video.

I do wish she had some of the more popular contestants from the Biggest Loser show.  Pete is one of the exercisers and I really like him but I do not know the other two.  One is from the Austrailian Biggest Loser and the other one is from the Couples Biggest Loser.  That's why I gave it 4 stars.

Overall, I am really impressed by the video.  It has definitely worked for me.",1170201600,44,1145,4.178082191780822
2665449,2,B000J10KN2,Save your money it's not worth it. The video has a all white back ground with just jillian and one of three people from biggest loser and a chair and a mat. The people don't seem to know what to do there behind her doing moves that she's decribing but there doing them wrong. Better off getting Shaping up for dummies it's the same thing but the instructor does all the moves her self.,1169769600,13,385,4.216216216216216
2665470,5,B000J10KN2,"This is a really great workout. I was in shape but have fallen off the exercise wagon hardcore because I am so busy. The exercises seem easy at first but I was sweating like crazy by the end. I've done them twice and am already feeling stronger, I did take a few days off between and used slightly more mellow workouts. I like getting my heart rate up because it makes me mentally feel so much better. If you are a beginner or getting back into it, I would give this a try. Oh and she uses: dumbbells, exercise band, a chair, and a small step (I used my footstool).",1451779200,3,565,4.1454545454545455

2665512,2,B000J10KN2,"I was hoping for something a little more fun along with the exercises like another of her videos. But wow, this is boring! Some of the exercises are not well explained or you don't get to see it well on TV the position you're supposed to be, and you're not informed of what types of things you may need to do the exercises like weights, chair, etc. All of sudden, they just add weights and tell you to follow. Also, the part she shows the exercise using a stretch band around a chair where she is sitting on it and the other person is doing the exercise... Hmmm, if I get this tape to do it at home, it's possible that I don't have another person to do with me, and I can't wrap that just anywhere. Not all chairs are adequate and not all sofas accommodate either.
Overall, I just found it not one of her best exercise videos.",1416787200,2,826,4.16875
2665513,5,B000J10KN2,I like this work out because the sets have little breaks in-between.  I am overweight and it is hard for me to jump up and down trying to get into position for different work outs.  With Jillian's it is much easier for me to keep up :),1414281600,3,235,3.978723404255319

2665518,4,B000J10KN2,"Overall, I really like this workout DVD. It contains two different workouts, both of which contain 6 circuits each. It has enough variety to be interesting and moves quickly. The only complaint I have is that I would like to explain the moves in more detail. Often you'll be 80% done with the exercise when she'll tell you when you should be breathing in versus out. That would be more helpful to know when you start the exercise. Also, be advised that you will need some items to complete the workouts, like a chair or other flat surface, a step, and weights.",1409788800,,560,4.5

2665526,5,B000J10KN2,"Okay, let me preface this with the fact I am completely and utterly out of shape, and that's an understatement. I'm also 50lbs overweight and 44 yrs old. That said, you know where I'm coming from with this review.

I was skeptical about a video, I can't stand cheerleader type annoying women who are overly perky on the videos. That was certainly not the case. While Jillian is a bit masculine in her mannerisms/approach, it seemed to suit me well, I like that she reminds you its okay to modify an exercise or take a break if needed. She also reminds you that the people doing the workout on the video started with these exercises and if they can so you can you. That approach seems to work, especially when I feel like quitting. She seems to space those comments out perfectly as well.

BEFORE I started this video workout I had worked my way up from being able to only do 10 total squats to 3 sets of 10 without dying and hurting so badly afterward that I couldn't move for a week. I would say if you can't do 3 sets of 10 squats without being ridiculously sore, work up to that BEFORE you start this series. It only took me roughly 4 workouts to work up to that, I wasn't even sore at all after I reached my 3rd workout. - which was surprising to see how quickly our bodies adapt.

THIS VIDEO - So far I have only done the ""frontside"" workout. The first try at it, it was rough. I got through the 1st 6 circuits but couldn't do the last one. Mind you, I am doing modified versions of push-ups by using the couch.  I was skeptical about the amount of squats on this video, but they work different muscles so oddly enough they were hard, but doable. The 2nd time I went through the workout I made it all the way to the last circuit and did 2 rounds of it, but couldn't finish the 3rd round. So, you see how quickly I was able to get further along in the video on only my 2nd try. This gave me hope that I would actually be able to see improvement with each workout. I needed to see improvement to continue, and boy did I ever. I'm able to do the entire thing now, and its a fairly intense workout for me, but I can get through it now and it gets easier each time. I am not bored with it.

I will say to have your remote handy. After your 2nd go round with this she kind of slows you down telling you how to do stuff and I find I just work ahead, then at the end of the circuit I press the next button on my remote to go ahead and start with my next circuit so I don't have to listen to her talking about something I'm finished with.

I plan on doing the Shred or Weights video after I master all the moves on this video with ease. Good luck to each of you ladies and men who are on a path to better health!",1406160000,9,2708,4.042910447761194

2665531,2,B000J10KN2,"I really don't know what I was expecting, but this was not it.

Maybe its because I have tried the 30 day Shred, NMTZ, and a few other programs of hers. I was expecting 30 Day Shred made simpler, but with the same... I don't know.... the same unggghhh... due to surgery I needed to get back into exercising, but slowly and carefully. So I figured I would try her For Beginners, I wasn't expecting much, I just expected something a less intense than the others.

What I got was a watered down waste of money. This was unimaginative, I became bored just previewing, realized that I will probably never use it. Maybe if the setting was better, nope, even tropical landscapes cant help this. It looks as though this was filmed in someones garage or basement in front of white wall. Its Jillian in front of..... you know what.... let me make it simple. Save your time, save your money, buy 30 Day Shred or another program and do the modified version and take your time.

2665534,5,B000J10KN2,I'm usually skeptical about workout dvds but Jillian Michaels is absolutely amazing! I am already seeing results with this dvd and a good diet. She stays at a great pace without wanting to pass out and you really work up a sweat. I never write reviews but I highly recommend this!!!!,1398643200,,283,4.568627450980392
2665535,5,B000J10KN2,"I read a lot of these reviews and as it does say for beginners; the heavier the weight the more intense
the workout you get. I consider myself an intermediate exerciser and I feel it is a very good workout. I
am sweating, but the main point is that you do 3 sets of each strength exercises which you would more then
likely do at the gym. It is recommended that for each exercise you do, you do 3 sets. If I was at the gym
working the shoulders that day, I would do after a warm up, 3 sets of shoulder presses, 3 sets of lateral raises and
3 sets of front raises. The idea she puts in a short burst of cardio is great for keeping your heart rate up.
Circuit training is the way to go as it does keep your heart rate up, but the downside is sometimes you
can't work with as heavy a weight. I find it very hard to find a good strength training workout in video form.
Her 30 day shred is a good cardio workout and even though she uses weights (3lbs) it is not really a
strength training workout. My goal is to get strong and defined and shredded and you only get those results
if you shed the fat and gain muscle mass. To gain muscle mass you have to lift a heavy weight that is challenging
for you. Once you hit 12 reps and don't feel the strain you need to up the weight. You are not going to get buff
or shredded using 3 or even 5lbs. You can burn more calories doing a circuit training workout, but at times you
just need to slow it all down and do one set after another using the heaviest weight as possible and resting maybe
30 seconds to one minute between sets. I think this video comes the closest to working out in the gym and building muscles.

All in all this is a good workout video for those who wants to build muscle and workout with weights. I feel the
workout is more intermediate and the only reason it says beginner is because of her instructional tutorial and
the slower pace. As I said before if you are using a heavy weight you go from it being beginner workout to intermediate. I mean
I don't know any beginner exerciser who can do regular military push ups and 3 sets of those. Most beginner exercisers
probably would find the modified push ups challenging. When they do the one arm dumbbell row the woman is using 5lbs
I use 20lbs. When the guy does shoulder presses he uses 8lbs, I use 12lbs. All of them use a much too light weight to
gain muscle tone, but at home use a weight that challenges you.

I alternate using this video with her 30 day shred which I think is more of a good cardio workout more then a
strength training workout. I also uses Leslie Sansone Just Walk, Walk it off in 30 days video.

If you want a good strength training workout this is the one. I don't believe it is a beginner workout unless you are
using 3 or 5lbs weights. The exercises are similar to an average day at a gym depending on what body part you
are working that day. They say to build any kind of strength and to reshape your body you need to challenge yourself.
Use a heavy weight but a weight that keeps you in good form. After using this video I spend another 30minutes just
doing weight lifting. For the frontside I will do more shoulder and tricep lifting. For the backside I do more bicep lifting.
I like to average about 15-20 sets per body part especially for the upper body.",1397952000,7,3295,4.1453125
2665536,5,B000J10KN2,The step-by-step way of teaching is very good. The user can gradually increase their fitness using this video. I would recommend this.,1396828800,,134,5.136363636363637

2665539,5,B000J10KN2,"About 2 years prior to making this purchase, I bought 4 other Jillian DVDs. I completed level 1 on 1 DVD, got about half way through the first workout on another DVD and shut it off, and the other 2 never even came out of the wrappers. For someone who is very much a beginner at any type of physical activity, Jillian Michaels can be very intimidating and it was easy to accept defeat when I felt like I could not keep up and could not properly complete any of her circuits. I'm so glad that I decided to give it another go and invest in Jillian Michaels for Beginners. This workout is presented differently from her others.  The first difference I like is that instead of using the ridiculously buff and toned women to demonstrate the workout, she is assisted by contestants from the Biggest Loser. They are easier to relate to and come across more as ""real people.""  I like that she explains what group of muscles are being worked in each exercise, explains what the proper form for each exercise is, and where you will feel strain if you do not have the correct form. This DVD does not have different levels like her others, however, she offers variations of each move to either make it achievable for a beginner, or add complexity to make it more advanced.  With all of her variations, it really does not feel like you are doing the same workout over and over again. I actually think this is something that I will be able to stick with and get me to a point where I can tackle her other workout videos without giving up.",1395619200,7,1524,4.3780918727915195
2665540,4,B000J10KN2,This video is excellent for beginners.  It also shows ways to intensify the program as you build up.  It divides the exercises into frontside and backside segments.  The video is 97 minutes long.  There is no direction as to how much you should do each day and if you should do front one day and back the other or some of each every day.  More directions would have been better.  But I love Jillian Michaels and she uses others to help demo so she can impart info during the exercises which is very helpful.,1395100800,,507,4.340425531914893
2665541,2,B000J10KN2,this workout was not at all what I thought it was. I do like that she has some people who were from the biggest loser on there and she does go at a slower pace but it was way to slow and boring and she only shows a few moves so doesn't feel like your getting a full workout,1394755200,,273,3.6440677966101696
2665542,5,B000J10KN2,I have been using this dvd for over 3 weeks now. I cannot say enough good things about it.

It is more of a warm up then a workout but it's always good to warm up before working out anyways so if you want something to warm up with before going to a gym or one of her hardcore DVDs then this is it.

2665553,4,B000J10KN2,"I bought this video along with two more because i wanted my bro in law to work out, He is on the heavy side, but he started using p90 and the exercises  were too much stress on his ankles and knees.  I told him when he started that, that kind of work out will get him hurting and that he needs to start slow, Once he looses weight a bit and increases muscle mass he can do p 90, which in my opinion should not be done by overweight people sure there are those success stories, but they don't always turn out good.  It's always best to start slow and learn how to exercise once you do that then you can try harder things, Oh and if your still gaining weight then, you have to start counting calories I know is a hassle to do, but if your working out and not loosing weight, that can only mean your eating (possibly) more due to your increase activity, this is one thing that people over look the most, the fact that when you work out  your body well get hungry, this is where the calorie counting will help reduce the amount of food you eat,  Most people after working out feel is ok to eat because they have work out but the problem is that you end up eating more after work out then you would with out them, so in essence your sabotaging yourself.",1389916800,3,1248,4.098360655737705
2665554,5,B000J10KN2,"Totally great workout. I'm a beginner, so this is a great start for me. There are three levels of workouts on this disc, each one gets more challenging. And, within each workout, Jillian shows you an easier and more challenging way to use her workout moves, so it's almost like getting 6 workouts in one disc. Thanks Jillian, my thighs are killing me!!!",1389571200,2,353,4.619047619047619
2665555,2,B000J10KN2,"This video is really hard to watch. Unlike the 30 day shred which I thought was great, this video is really choppy and there is a lot more time spent watching Jillian talk than showing the actual exercises. It's not a terrible video but I just copied some of the exercises and ditched the video, it's more instructional than anything.",1388016000,,334,4.583333333333333
2665556,3,B000J10KN2,"I just picked up this workout again after having it for quite a while. I find it a little hard and felt a little sick at some points in the workout and after. She has you do cardio and then immediately go into mostly lower body exercises combined with upper body moves. Usually two or three moves are put together with cardio. I was a little frustrated that she put in things like jumping jacks, a weird version of  a lunge off a chair, chair dips and pushups for a beginner workout. There are three sets of each exercises which makes it a little hard for beginners who usually only need one or two sets of an exercise. It is a good workout and hard but still a little hard for someone who is very overweight. I am not sure why Jillian Michaels has a problem making a good workout for very obese beginners when she works with people on the biggest loser all the time. Also, the up and down to the floor throughout kind of hurt my knees, not that bad but I noticed a little twinge.",1384819200,5,980,4.185185185185185

2665558,4,B000J10KN2,"This workout is relatively fun, and it changes up a lot so you don't get bored. You'll wake up sore and feel like you've done something, which is the best part of working out! If this is Jillian's beginner track - I can't imagine advanced!",1381881600,,239,4.333333333333333
2665559,5,B000J10KN2,It is a really good workout. I was sore for days especially on the tops of my legs. It explains each excercise well. It is about 40 minutes long for each side. It is not an extremely hard workout but it is good. After doing the first circuit I thought it might be to easy but if you do it all the way through you will be sweating. Good workout I liked it,1381881600,,354,3.863013698630137

Over the past 3 years I have dieted and exercised almost daily - but after losing 90 lbs I hit a plateau that has resisted all of my efforts to break through. How I wish I had discovered this video long ago. It is intense and more importantly brings results as quickly as promised - even if you can't do every move perfectly. Jillian is so encouraging and motivating, and as you move quickly from one move to the next there is not a second to get bored. Did I say I love this workout?

2665567,1,B000J10KN2,"I wasn't crazy about Jillian Michaels prior to purchasing this DVD, and my experience with this workout didn't change my opinion. First of all, I was expecting this workout to be beginner friendly. It's a workout designed w the idea of circuits...here's the thing, if you are a true beginner, this workout is not for you. It is too advanced and intimidating for someone just starting to get in shape. Second, I really didn't like the format. Jillian Michaels cashes in on her Biggest Loser fame and takes former people who were on the television show and makes them do all the exercises in each circuit. Meanwhile, Jillian Michaels just stands there and talks, saying annoying motivational stuff, calling everyone ""baby"" and ruffling their hair. Really annoying. I did not find her to be motivational or engaging at ALL. Overall: this DVD is an epic fail.",1376265600,6,855,4.863013698630137

I am so glad that I purchased For Beginners.  The DVD is divided into two parts--Frontside and Backside.  Michaels has invited three participants of the Biggest Loser, who are much fitter but are in realistic shape.  They show various levels of difficulty without music blaring in the background.  Michaels and the three BL participants are encouraging to the viewer because they have been there.  I have used the video three complete times and I feel the difference in my muscles already.  I like that Michaels explains why each exercise is necessary.  I recommend this DVD for those who want to begin an exercise regimen but are turned off by hopelessly fit model who barely perspire.

I thought it would be training similar from the biggest loser show.  But this DVD was really boring to me.  I tried to work through the first workout, but the music was terrible and I hated the background.  In this DVD Jillian leads a person through a series of exercises and it's set up like a circuit.  I'm sure the exercises are effective, and I know she is an excellent trainer, but the DVD was just too boring for me.  I haven't tried the other 2 DVD's.",1373760000,,600,4.201754385964913

You should have some weights (day 1 I used soup cans because I didn't have any). Today, I used 3 lb. Could go higher.

Oh, and after you learn the sets you don't need to watch the DVD. I do my sets while watching my favorite show on DVR when the baby is playing on the floor. And he thinks I'm doing it all for his entertainment. :)

Jillian talks you through each move, gives thorough instruction re. each movement, explains the purpose for each move, and encourages you along the way. Her four on-camera participants are Biggest Loser cast members, all of whom have gone through her workouts and have lost weight, so that's encouraging. Also, the feeling is upbeat, the exercises ranging from low to medium impact, and at the end of each workout five people get together and congratulate each other and you for a job well done....and close by saying, ""see you tomorrow.""
The tape is divided into two separate sets of circuits, which are meant to be alternated throughout the week.
It's encouraging, a great way to start your day, and truly provides you with a set of skills (using every day items) to teach you how to safely and correctly workout, push yourself, and get stronger.

This video is great. Workouts are pretty simple, move quick and really get your heart rate up. You get basic workouts, and Jillian has her helpers also demonstrate more advanced techniques to add on to your exercises as you advance. This gets 4 stars because there are a couple of moves that should be broken down and demonstrated more clearly but aren't. Some of the camera angles could be better to show you how to position your body. Other than that, this is a great place to start to get in shape.

I'm up to about 3 circuits a night before my muscles are weak and i'm covered in sweat. It really targets your muscles to where you are sore the next day, but trust me, this feeling of sore is the best. It makes you feel like you are on the beginning track to something great.

Just that ONE section had my thighs aching for the rest of the weekend.
I JUST did the entire 6 circuits today, and BOY- it is something!
The descriptions of the exercises and the variations she suggests are very helpful.
It is HARD- but not impossible.  You can make it harder too, which makes it a long term investment.
The only thing left to figure out is how this will figure into your overall routine, so I'm guessing...every other day alternating with cardio?  (If anybody has a suggestion, let me know.)

Not only were they thin but had muscle and looked so healthy.  I have a number of exercise DVDs from the Biggest Loser TV franchise and I now know that these results were gained by cutting edge exercise and diet science. Plus an education clearly communicated.

This circuit training DVD includes two work outs: front side and back side, the warm up is at the beginning of each of the 6 circuits.  Repeat each circuit exercise three times.  Do front side work out one day and then the back side work out the following day.

This DVD is the PREQUEL to ""30 Day Shred"" and other Jillian videos.  An excellent education, attention to form and visualizing the muscles working.  No drive to the gym, you can exercise in a minute from thought to action!  Jillian gives modifications, low impact and advanced ways to do the moves so you can tailor to your situation.

Front Side Work Out:

Circuit One: Warm up with jumping jacks, squats, and push ups. Repeat two more times.

Circuit Two: Warm up with marching in place, bench dips and king squats. Repeat two more times.

Circuit Three: Warm up with jump rope, chest flies chest press and sumo squats. Repeat two more times.

Circuit Four: Warm up with jumping jacks, chair squats with arm raises, and shoulder presses. Repeat two more times.

Circuit Five: Warm up by marching in place, tricep kickbacks, shoulder press. Repeat two times.

Circuit Six (Shoulder): Warm up with jump rope, lateral raises for the shoulders, triceps extensions and plank. Repeat two more times.

Back Side Work Out:

Circuit One: Warm up with butt kicks (jogging with heels hitting gluts), wide grip dumb bell rows and static lunges. Repeat two more times.

Circuit Two: Warm up with step up using alternate legs, one arm medium rows and bridge. Repeat two more times.

Circuit Three: Warm up with speed skaters, stiff leg dead lifts and rear flies. Repeat two more times.

Circuit Four: Warm up with butt kicks (jogging with heels hitting gluts),Dumb bell punches, morning glory and low rows. Repeat two more times.

Circuit Five: Warm up with steps ups (arms can be up over your head), bicep curls, donkey kicks and abs. Repeat two more times.

Circuit Six: Warm up with skaters, concentration curls, superman and bicycles sit ups. Repeat two more times.",1342396800,55,2411,4.742788461538462
2665642,5,B000J10KN2,"The Jillian Michaels: For Beginners (Frontside/Backside Combo) DVD really IS the best way to start a work-out routine! The emphasis is on demonstrating proper form and explaining WHY each of the moves is effective.

As a life-long couch potato who carries 100+ pounds of extra weight, when I made the decision to finally lose the weight and get in shape for the first time in my 35 years, I got a pedometer and started walking since that seems to be the easiest and most low-impact thing to do, right? Yeah, it's also the most boring and I didn't stick with it once the weather turned warm. When I realized I needed to move my work-out indoors if I wanted to stick with it, I started researching work-out DVDs and bought 3 of Jillian Michaels' to try. The 30-Day Shred work-out is great, but I had a very difficult time keeping up with even the Level 1 modified moves; my knees hurt so much even doing the jumping jacks! Rather than get discouraged, I did a little more research and found the Beginners DVD. The first time I tried it, I LOVED it! It really is geared towards beginners with the way the moves are explained and proper form is emphasized to get maximum benefit and to prevent injury. Even with the simpler moves, my heart rate was pumping and my muscles were burning by the end of the first DVD.

If you're like me and just starting out, this is definitely the DVD to try first!",1341878400,16,1392,4.43359375

If you can do the 30 Day Shred or Jillian's Yoga Meltdown, this is not the DVD for you. It is a lot less challenging than those workouts. As someone who is in the middle of Ripped in 30, this workout was far too simple for me.

OK, so I bought the beginner double DVD and got started.  I was such a couch potato I would breath heavy going up a flight of stairs.  I really struggled the first time I did the workout.  I had to stop and I had to do the easier, beginner moves.  Every single time I do these workouts it gets easier.  I do the moves better and longer each time.  I'm doing some of the harder moves too.  I can't believe how much stronger I am after only 4 weeks.  I can now go upstairs and don't breath heavy at all.  I love the results.

If I had started on another DVD I probably would have gotten discouraged and stopped.  This DVD is hard enough to get results but doable so you come back and do it again.  Also, the way it is broken up into 6 circuits with 3 different Biggest Losers doing the exercises it never gets boring and the workout seems shorter than the 45 minutes it takes.

I am so happy with this double DVD and I recommend it to anyone just starting to get back into shape from total couch potato level.

Now that I've completed 4 weeks of beginner, I'm going to try and incorporate some level 1 30 day shred or 30 day ripped, etc.

Buy this and get started.  Starting is the hardest part.  I'm hoping to continue working out to JM long term and hoping to get healthy.",1338508800,17,1498,4.131944444444445

This workout shows Jillian in a different light she's encouraging, she jokes around,  but most of all no yelling!  The workout I found to be intense. You have 6 circuits and you do each circuit 3 times before going to the next. She gives recommendations on how to make the cardio and other exercises easier or harder depending on your fitness level. The people in the video who do the exercises (each circuit is just Jillian and one other person) are ""The Biggest Loser "" contestants from past episodes which helped to motivate me. I would suggest at least having 2 pairs of different weights, a chair,  and a mat for ab work.

I would not recommend this to intermediate or advanced exercisers because the DVD obviously says for beginners.  I was drenched in sweat afterwards.

The only negatives of this workout is there's no warm up and no cool down. So I just used a different DVD for the cool down and stretched like crazy. I still felt it in my muscles the next day.",1337731200,4,1081,4.48469387755102
2665649,4,B000J10KN2,"Over the last several years, work and raising kids got in the way of taking care of me.  I gained 50 pounds and lost my sense of well-being. This year after several false starts, I'm finally on my way to a better and healthier me.  I've been doing Leslie Sansone's walking tapes for a few months and am down 10 pounds but I wanted to try something a little more advanced...but...being in my late 40's and still needing to lose about 40 pounds, I knew it wouldn't be smart to dive into something like P90x (even though the before and after shots sure make it tempting!) or even my long time favorite, Gilad.  I decided to give Jillian a try because frankly I needed a little more ""tough love"" now that I'm on my way and I've seen her get tough on The Biggest Loser.  I was very pleasantly surprised that Jillian uses the right amount of ""no excuses"" mixed with ""you CAN do it.""  My favorite quote in this DVD is ""you get out of life what you put into it.""  It was one of those AHA moments for me because she's RIGHT!  This DVD combines two circuit training routines each lasting about 45 minutes (it goes by VERY quickly!); one is focused on the front muscle groups, the other focused on the back muscles groups.  For the first time in I can't remember when, I actually enjoyed working up a sweat!  I feel empowered not just because I made a healthy choice by exercising but because these circuits challenged me and I did it!!  In each circuit she shows you how to do the exercises as a beginner, once you've built up some strength / stamina, and once you're more advanced so I know it will be a while before I feel like I need more challenge.  The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is that circuit 1 starts with jumping jacks, circuit 2 starts with marching in place and circuit 3 starts with ""jumping rope""  (the motion without the rope).  Since I'm a relative beginner and in my late 40's that was a little tough the first circuit, but, I was fine by the 4th circuit.  I suggest starting with marching in place, then moving to ""jumping rope,"" and then doing jumping jacks for the cardio portion of the first 3 circuits.  Since the cardio portion of each the next circuit is 30 seconds you can easily do that sequence for the right duration but ease into the cardio and allow the joints to warm-up.  I was also surprised that she did not mention in the introduction that if you want to add challenge to any of the circuits, weights are required.  Luckily mine were handy so I didn't need to pause the video to grab them.  Also, I was very surprised that there is not a ""cool down"" or stretch sequence at the end since I definitely worked up a sweat and used muscles I haven't used in while, so, I just stretched on my own to prevent stiffness and sore muscles later today.  All in all, this DVD is a great place for beginners to start taking their workouts to a more advanced level, for those who have ""fallen off the fitness wagon"" to restart, or for those who want to learn about and experience circuit training without the stress of ""boot camp"" type workouts.",1337040000,9,3074,4.32404181184669

If you want to start somewhere, it's here. Work with these workouts for the first month, then pick up the 30 Day Shred and start on level one. You'll have more confidence and endurance!

Jillian is highly instructional and encouraging in this DVD. There is a friendly, helpful atmosphere. She's a regular chatterbox, talking us through each move and giving suggestions and recommendations. The workouts are in sections, each demonstrated by one of the contestants from past episodes of The Biggest Loser. These are not people with 'perfect' model bodies, so it was less intimidating. They were once unable to do these, so there is hope for me. Jillian ""assigns"" several short exercises and then they do them several times, often demonstrating (with a sense of humor) several options viewers can use as they get stronger.

I took advantage of the sections using weights, since I haven't used them for a long time and wanted to start again as a beginner. I don't do jumping jacks or push-ups, but after seeing them demonstrated here in such a non-threatening way, maybe I might try the push-ups one of these days.

I don't watch ""The Biggest Loser"" but Jillians videos seem to be very popular and I needed some good beginner workouts. She goes through the circuits slow enough to follow and the workouts themselves are actually really helpful and not too crazy. Her pacing really helps beginners and she actually explains step by step how to do something, which is nice.

The only thing that annoys me is when she throws in some slang and seems like she is trying to show how cool she is. Jillian is ""down"" with her Biggest Loser pals. Thats annoying to me, I can't explain why.

I still feel some muscle soreness the day after I do them as well as find myself a bit shaky for a few hours that same day.  Here are the pros follwed by the cons I have found since owning it.
Pros:
Two workouts for the price of one.
Focus on front or back side muscles or an all over workout if you go through both in one day.
Jillian is VERY instructive which helps if you are not sure how to perform the move.  She also shows you more difficult ways to perform the moves as you become more advanced.
Each DVD contains 6 circuits so you have control over what you do.
Already I have gotten stronger and go for more reps and more advanced forms of the move.
Can be combined with other workouts to up the calorie burn since it is not overly exhausting in itself.
Here are the cons:
I wear a HRM when I workout and I find that individually you only burn around 350 - 400 calories for each DVD.  Therefore i usually do them together which burns around 600-750 calories but takes 1 and 1/2 hours to complete without stopping.
Once you get used to doing the moves you easily get ahead of the people on the DVD so I find myself finishing a circuit and having to skip forward to the next one.
There is no music.
Overall I would recommend this workout for those who want to start a strength routine and are nto sure how or where to begin.  Advanced people may find it a bit slow, but I like it.",1233014400,5,1553,4.092105263157895

Also, Jillian seems like she's just kind of winging it every time she talks...like there is no script. All of the exercises are disjointed...it would be very hard to just pop this DVD in a get a good workout because of all of the pauses and Jillian's pointless monologues.

I have always been active, I walk and bike a fair bit. I wanted to add some strength training and more cardio. I hired a personal trainer to come every other week and soon got frustrated. It was EXPENSIVE and even though she set me up with a great circuit workout I had trouble remembering what I should do and if I was doing it right.

I loved the fact that I could pop in the DVD and follow along. It was a good workout and Jillian shows you how to modify the exercises to make them harder or easier. I have to say the workouts in these DVD's were almost exactly what I had been paying a trainer for.

To those that say these are a bit boring and slow: These are for BEGINNERS. I eventually put them on mute and listened to my own music. I now enjoy some of Jillian's other more challenging workouts. I have passed these on to a friend that had NEVER been active at all. She loves them as much as I did and is seeing the same great results!!",1231459200,2,1021,3.9950980392156863

I am not new to working out, but have let my body go over the past few years so I'm not in very good shape.  While I don't consider myself a 'beginner', I wanted something that would challenge me without having me jumping all around and feeling discouraged early on in getting back into things.  These videos are really great for pretty much any level of exercise because they are slow-paced and Jillian gives advice on how to make the exercises easier and harder.

If you are a true beginner or if you are very advanced, I would watch these videos all the way through before doing them the first time because Jillian doesn't typically give advice on how to make the exercise easier or harder until the second set in each interval.

Another thing that I like about this video is you don't have to keep your eyes on the video the entire time you're doing an exercise.  Jillian tells you how to do each exercise and you can listen and just look at the TV as a guide.

Other reviewers said that this is like having a personal trainer, but on your TV.  It's kind of like that, but with a personal trainer, they are there to constantly push you and to take you to the next level when you're ready.  With a DVD, you still have to push yourself from within to get to that next level.

For those who are looking for music and dancing around, this is not the video for you.  The cardio is very basic, but does the job at getting your heart rate up.

I also bought the 30-day Shred DVD for those days when I'm time crunched.  That DVD had me sweating as much in 20 minutes as these do in 45 or 50 minutes, but I didn't have the soreness that I have when I do these.  I am also incorporating walking and other cardio at the gym a few days a week to ensure that I'm burning enough calories to lose weight.",1231113600,8,1878,4.194986072423398
2665665,5,B000J10KN2,"I was a little skeptical about this set because it's marketed for beginners. I'm not sure where I fall these days - I've run 3 full marathons, 3 half marathons and a bajillion shorter races. Until 2 1/2 years ago I was fairly diesel . . . but then I started law school and became a sloth. In just under three years I've gained 30 pounds, jumped three clothing sizes and lost a lot of my strength and flexibility. Anyway, I wondered if this Frontside/Backside set would be too basic or low-key for me. Now I have my answer:

Negatory, Ghostrider.

Jillian just kicked my butt, and how! I'm not lying - this is a tough workout. It's appropriate for beginners because it's very adaptable to any level of fitness, but I really worked to get through it all. I also really appreciated her rapport with the former contestants and enjoyed her style. Most fitness DVDs annoy the piss out of me with their phony bubblegum cheer and bad aerobics music. This was all about the workout. Finally, I'm impressed by the level of detail in the explanations. Jillian always explained the theory behind the progression of the workout and emphasized proper form. Even when she was repeating information I was already familiar with, it gave me confidence that she knows her stuff.

I haven't watched The Biggest Loser so I wasn't familiar with her, but I am now a believer.",1231027200,9,1352,4.601659751037344

They are fun and the moves aren't very difficult but you are constantly moving. It's in a circuit format so you start with cardio then do weight and resistance, doing that set 3 times then you go to a next one, six circuits. Each video is about 40mins. I watched the Intro to the first time but after that it gets annoying. I must tell you though, I'm only about 15lbs overweight and its a little difficult for me, I can't imagine how difficult it would be for someone who is very overweight. I've only been doing it two weeks, along with her diet plan, and I'm already noticing a different in my energy, mood, and how my clothes fit.

It has the worst music I have ever heard. I don't even know why they bothered with the music because it absolutely does not work with the exercise. It is not a video I would ever work out too. I think the producers are just capitalizing on the show. Big, big disappointment.

I own 59 exercise videos. I don't care how good Michaels is with The Biggest Loser, I will never buy a product from The Biggest Loser again. I bought two other of her DVDs. They are not good for working out with either. Again, good info if you want to put together your own routine. But absolutely not a DVD you could work out to.",1215388800,3,754,4.2

The set is simple, the equipment is simple, the moves are simple, etc.  This DVD set gets straight to the point.  Jillian has the three from the BL to show you the moves while she explains what they are doing while telling you the benefits of the exercise and showing you the proper form.  The onw draw back is that the DVD moves a bit slow because of all the talk.  I have moved on to going ahead with the circuits while she is still talking.  I know the mvoes and what is required, so I feel confident in doing so.  This DVD set is also very effective.  I have been doing this set for two weeks and have lost a total of 3 inches and 4 pounds already.  I know it does not seem like much, but it is a big deal to me.  I have noticed a huge improvement in my activity level and overall happiness.  If you want to get down to basic moves that work without all the fluff other workout DVDS have (fancy sets, equipment no normal person owns, obnoxious music, etc.) then this one is for you.",1214179200,14,1062,4.033492822966507

The moves here are good and will work if you put effort into them - but the pace is incredibly slow!  Jillian gives good explanations about proper positioning and other tips, but I wish this had been in separate or optional setting - you have to hear everything every time and that takes away from the actual workout time.  Often, the former BL contestants (and Me) finish our counts and then have to wait for her to finish talking.  If you are new to working out, this could be good for its explanations - but if you just want to get down to it and get things done, then this one is not for you.",1211155200,39,723,4.294117647058823

I try to do them with the sound off and lose track of things. This is the first tape I have ever seen with no music in the background.

I have some restrictions on exercises from my doctor and a couple of the things she does is on the restricted list but that is an uncommon situation. The exercises are basic and not advanced and most people could easily do them.

The other thing I like about this tape is that being very overweight, the exercises are such that my weight does not make them too hard to do. Sometimes my belly gets in the way.

What I would advise anyone buying this video is to warm up before doing the exercises. Jillian has cardio with all circuits, but not the beginning 5-minute warm up or the ending 5-minute cool down. So, do the warm up before you start the video.

Program is easy to follow and has variety. Anybody, regardles of weight, can do the exercises.

It's just Jillian and three former contestants from TBL who to me are not inspiring to watch while doing exercise. Jillian in just a plain white set coaching each individual segment with one of the three contestants.

2665717,5,B000J10KN2,"This two-DVD set consists of two circuit training workouts (weight training sets interspersed with cardio intervals to keep the heart rate up) that work the whole body. Jillian divides the weight training exercises by 'front side' (chest, quads, shoulders, etc) and 'back side' (back, glutes, etc). Both workouts have ab segments. Each DVD consists of 6 sets of workouts; 'Frontside' totals 40 minutes, and 'Backside' is about 50 minutes.

Contrary to what one reviewer said, the Biggest Loser participants who demonstrate the exercises usually have good form, though sometimes they seem to rush through the exercises a bit (Jillian does make them slow down occasionally). All three Biggest Loser people seem to have maintained their weight loss since leaving the show, to their credit (and unlike many other show participants). Jillian generally instructs them, and the viewer, about correct form and modifications and only occasionally does the exercises with them.

I had been doing cardio exercises several times a day for a few weeks, but not much weight training - so I wasn't totally out of shape but was pretty weak. I've been doing the DVDs for 3 weeks now, and already have seen and felt results. My legs feel stronger when I'm out walking or doing daily tasks, and my arms feel firmer. I've always had a bad lower back, and was a bit afraid of lifting weights, but the increased strength has actually helped to alleviate my back pain. I've also lost a few pounds (though I also do about 5 cardio sessions/week in addition to 4 Front/Backside sessions.) I have to do a few of the exercises with modifications, but I'm sure I will gradually progress (Jillian says that in 3 months you should be able to do all the exercises at the 'advanced' levels).

Stylistically, Jillian is enthusiastic but not too cutesy, though on 'Frontside' she does get a bit giggly. This doesn't bother me (it shows she has a great relationship with the Biggest Loser people, who clearly love her) but it may bother some people. If you're expecting the Scary Jillian from the show, you won't get that - you get a friendly and enthusiastic trainer. And as others have noted, there's no music and there's just a plain white background. I find this to be quite acceptable since it helps me concentrate on form. I have other DVDs if I want music and scenic backdrops.

The only thing missing from these DVDs are warmup or cooldown/stretching segments, but you can just add your own.",1187395200,47,2464,4.845605700712589

And then I tried this one. Jillian asks you to do things like ""Jumping Jacks"" and ""Squats"". Even clumsy as I am, I thought, ""I can do a jumping jack.""

There is a lot of emphasis on form and teaching your body how to do these moves correctly, also how to adjust for when you are not sure you can do the ""whole"" move. My only complaint (and this is minor) is that at nearly 45 minutes for each workout, I found when I was starting out, I couldn't get through the whole Frontside or Backside workouts. That was pretty discouraging, but each workout is broken down into six circuits, so instead I would just pick which three or four circuits I was going to do in a day and do those.

Recently, I moved onto my first ""Beginner Shred"" DVD and I know I wouldn't be able to get through those workouts if I hadn't started with this one and learned the right ways to do the moves. So, I guess what I would say is this- This is a DVD for complete beginners. It really will teach you how to move properly and then when you're ready, you can move onto something more complex.
