5053454,4,B0073JF2WC,Fun show. We enjoyed it. Subject matter was on target while being sweet and stright to the point. Great out come.,1376006400,,113,4.428571428571429
5053455,4,B0073JF2WC,"I'm enjoying it.  It's very adult orientated without being obscene and it moves along at a good pace to keep you interested.  However, it's Martin Freeman who makes the movie for me and is the reason I bought my own copy after seeing it on cable. Although there's a lot of angst throughout, it ends up being a feel good movie.",1370736000,,326,4.327868852459017
5053456,2,B0073JF2WC,"Swinging With the Finkels is filled with the usual stereotypes and inaccuracies pertaining to married people who seek relationships with other couples, and turned into Hollywood's overblown and far-fetched version of such an idea.  Of course, usually these couples are only pretending or suggesting, but sometimes they really go through with it.  A man and woman decide that since their relationship is really stale and uninteresting, that they should date other people while still remaining a couple.  They lay some rules down so neither one has *too* much fun with their new partner.

The problem?  The storyline -while certainly promising if the movie had better writing- was a huge letdown for me.  Almost nothing of interest happens.  Too much static and generic sitcom-like storytelling that doesn't offer anything in the way of compelling must-see entertainment.

The only segment that's truly honestly funny is the one where the wife (played by Mandy Moore) has a little private adventure with a cucumber after receiving some friendly advice by her friends on how to spice up her sex life since the husband isn't getting the job done.  Of course you and I both know what's going to happen- she turns the music up really loud in her bedroom and thinks she's alone but, of course, she's not.  She's then caught in the act by not only her husband, but her parents which results in a few funny lines admittedly (such as the whole family going to a restaurant the next morning and the father asking if she'd like a cucumber, lol).

Martin Freeman has a few lines that are worth noting, such as when he embarrassingly knows Richard Simmons a little too well, and when he takes his friend to a doctor and his friend mentions being a dentist and inappropriately mentions to the doctor how he can remove the stains off her teeth.  Who'd say such a thing?

These are decent lines, but overall, even though the film barely reaches 80 minutes, it's probably the longest 80 minutes of my life.  Too much relationship-type nonsense that doesn't even come close to being original, much less funny.  Seriously, in this day and age, better writers should be brought in for these type of movies because the whole marriage/cheating concept written from a comical point of view is unbelievably stale by this point.  Please skip it.",1370476800,,2319,4.877551020408164
5053457,5,B0073JF2WC,The movie was the best I ever saw funny cute and sexy good jokes excellent lines to learn from so go buy it watch it with a friends bring all and enjoy Ty,1367712000,,154,3.696969696969697
5053458,2,B0073JF2WC,"I didn't enjoy this film. I love the cast. I love the concept. The trailers were amazing, unfortunately they showed some of the best parts. I didn't laugh once in this film. Instead I found myself bored, and cringing. I don't think I'd ever watch this film again... and I honestly can't even recommend it, which is rare for movies.",1357948800,,331,4.533333333333333
5053459,1,B0073JF2WC,"Quite honestly, I rented this movie purely out of my love for Martin Freeman. It was so stupid and dreadful that I gave up after fifteen minutes. In those fifteen minutes pretty much every stupid cliche of committed heterosexual relationships was invoked and taken for granted. If you're a Freeman fan, try Wild Target with Bill Nighy and Rupert Grint or Nativity! if you haven't seen them yet.",1354665600,2,394,4.8088235294117645
5053460,4,B0073JF2WC,"The subject of swinging or swapping seems to have been covered by a dozen other comedies (unseen by me.)  Mandy Moore is the only reason I watched this and she is terrific as usual.  The supporting cast are adequate and the end is not what you might suppose.  It stays on a mostly tasteful and tactful approach, considering the very adult subject matter.  It would even work as a ""date movie.""",1352073600,,393,4.492957746478873
5053461,4,B0073JF2WC,"Contrary to the title, this movie is not all about swinging. It's about a couple who have reached a dry patch in their marriage and don't know what to do about it. Yes, they try some lewd sexual things to try and find a spark, but what it all boils down to is that marriage is work. It takes effort on the part of both people to keep romance, etc. alive.",1346630400,,354,4.0
5053462,4,B0073JF2WC,"I saw the title of this movie and was kind of thinking I didn't want to watch even though I love Martin Freeman and like Mandy Moore though she does manage to star in duds from time to time. I didn't want to watch yet another raunchy take on a romantic comedy, but I figured neither one of these two actors would get involved in a raunchy movie unless it had something redeeming about it.

I was delighted to see, as the movie progressed, that their is really nothing particularly suggestive or sexual in the film that isn't shown in the trailer. This may disappoint some, but I liked the movie as it was.

It is an exploration of this marriage that has went stale and how the couple tries to revive it through desperate means. It ends up being more serious than funny though it does have its funny moments.

My only nitpick is Mandy Moore. I like her in movies when she isn't supposed to be in  love. I don't really buy her as a romantic actress...I actually think she is more adept in her mean girl parts like The Princess Diaries, Saved, American Dreamz, etc. However, she wasn't enough of a downer to ruin this movie. I ended up kind of liking it...the little outtakes or deleted scenes in the end credits were kind of cute, so keep an eye out for them.",1334275200,5,1257,4.313559322033898
5053463,5,B0073JF2WC,"The Finkels are in a rut. They've been married 9 years and can't seem to find the desire or passion to please one another anymore. Somewhat conservative Ellie comes up with the idea of swinging, to see if the grass is greener on the other side, so Alvin goes along with it. What happens after are hilarious insights on the low points of marriage that are funny only because they're true. The side characters are equally as entertaining, mimicking someone we either know or have known. Many thoughts are thoughts we've all expressed at one point, some issues are serious, others are mundane. Either way, living vicariously through the Finkels should make you think of your own relationship. The ending was predictable but it was okay because the movie itself was hilarious, quirky, insightful and definitely off the beaten path. I was so surprised by Mandy Moore! I've never really liked much of her work, but thought she played this character wonderfully, she was completely endearing in her role, and Martin Freeman was hilarious as well. Totally don't see this couple together in real life, but they were equally strong in their characters enough to get pass that. This is not a main stream comedy, its a dry, very witty and satisfying movie, and many laugh out loud moments. It's not slapstick, or crude, believe it or not and this won't leave you with a bad, uncomfortable feeling at the end (like, for instance<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Break-Up/dp/B000KNJJJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Break-Up</a>], it's actually a very sweet comedy. I was very surprised and very pleased.",1333411200,4,1631,5.252873563218391

I already wasted enough time watching it, and I'm not wasting anymore enumerating the reasons this movie is such a dog..

8509269,3,B0073JF2WC,"I seriously only watched this movie because I love Martin Freeman and Mandy Moore. They generally have decent acting rolls that I enjoy. This movie however is so cliche on all the things that straight couples go through. It's really interesting at times and don't get me wrong I did enjoy it, but only for the fan in me. I do have to say the first part with the grandparents and the cucumber...I loved it.",1389484800,,405,4.413333333333333
8509270,5,B0073JF2WC,"I had a great time watching this movie. The opening music with Freeman walking through the marketplace was snazzy and the movie ended with a lovely song as well. I did find it hard for Mandy Moore to play older than what character she was supposed to be, but everything else was nice. The humor was spot on! Martin Freeman carried this film. Seriously, he MADE this movie! I liked the couple bits during the end credits. I wish my dvd  copy had more things in the special features like a gag reel (because you KNOW there were funny moments during the making of this) and behind the scenes stuff. Oh well, I am glad to have found this little jewel.",1376438400,,647,4.347107438016529
