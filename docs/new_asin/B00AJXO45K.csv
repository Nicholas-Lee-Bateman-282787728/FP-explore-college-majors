8552866,4,B00AJXO45K,"This is a very interesting and enjoyable film.  We had recently seen Cousteau's Ocean Secrets at IMAX in  Galveston in 3D so naturally it was more impressive than this one.  However, if one cannot see 3D, this is definitely a good educational film.",1436140800,,248,4.72093023255814
