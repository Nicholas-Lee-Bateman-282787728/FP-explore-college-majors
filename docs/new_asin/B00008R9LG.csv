7986659,1,B00008R9LG,"College film students have more talent than the director of this debacle. I'm all for campy B-movies but this is more like a D. The director insults your intelligence throughout: from male singing dubbed over (non-)lipsyncing girls, hippies posing as punks?, and a girl shrugging off her rape for show business. i couldn't wait for it to be over. The Banana Splits are more entertaining.",1313712000,,387,4.969230769230769
7986660,1,B00008R9LG,"Unless you're a Vicki Peterson fan like I am and want to see her beating an old woman with a stick, skip this movie for its much funnier sequel, ""Love Dolls Superstar.""",1224460800,,168,4.28125
7986661,3,B00008R9LG,"Don't expect any great production values or too much of a storyline here, as The Love Dolls try to break into the recording industry in So. Cal. in the early 80's.  This is filmed on Super 8 and apparently a bunch of friends just got together and made it, yet it somehow manages to be more professional than a lot of ""earnest"" people that are supposedly creating ""art"" these days using some of the same methods...go figure.  Anyway this has members of Redd Kross, Black Flag, Blood on the Saddle, etc., and it chronicles the rise to fame and fortune of The Love Dolls and then their ultimate downfall, and all in 60 minutes...if only Valley of the Dolls had been that short.  3 out of 5, fun stuff but don't go into this expecting too much.",1175040000,7,740,4.386861313868613

7986663,5,B00008R9LG,I have never seen such an amazing film in all my life! Terrific story with the most quality detail. A must see for every living human. Oh and Dez Cadena is in it.,1112745600,8,162,3.9393939393939394
