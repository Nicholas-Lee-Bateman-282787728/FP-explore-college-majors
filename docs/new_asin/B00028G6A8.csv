8158572,3,B00028G6A8,"Metal Munching Maniacs: Gourmet Damage (2003)it's cheap for DVD around $12.00 why only 3 stars the matches are so fast which is good and bad. It's not the same battle for 15mins. on the flip side I would of like to see some major damage - more smoke, fire. Another plus interviews which I liked. Over all it was a fun DVD.
If you like robot and destruction. Grab a copy",1185840000,,369,4.211267605633803
