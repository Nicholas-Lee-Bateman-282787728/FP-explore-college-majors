4387324,1,B004IOWJNA,"The movie was defective as it skipped and stalled. It was not the video player but from the looks on the disc, it had some flaws. Not worth returning.",1384992000,2,150,4.206896551724138
4387325,5,B004IOWJNA,"The Golden Veil transcends many beliefs and theories; and it delivers truth in a way that proves a lot of things outside of the film's intent. This movie is untainted by Hollywood, which enables it to bring light to those who have the ability to see through the darkness.

As a child in 1979, I had no idea what the US hostage crisis in Iran was all about. I looked at Iranians as a bunch of evil people. The US hostages were released thirty-three minutes after Ronald Reagan was sworn into office and the crisis was soon forgotten. The media continued to do their job over the years and I was convinced that Iran was an evil land full of evil people.

Thirty-three years after the 1979 incident, I watched The Golden Veil. This film has completely changed my outlook on the beautiful people of Iran. Mr. Nassiri has taken a bold approach to deliver this film to the people of the world. He didn't do it for money. He did it for a cause. It is his gift to us. It is a gift that I will cherish for the rest of my life. May God bless Bahman Nassiri for making this movie!",1379548800,9,1069,4.235294117647059
4387326,5,B004IOWJNA,This is one of the best films I have ever seen!  An eye-opening look at the corruption of US politics.  I admire the courage it took to produce this film in a county controlled by criminals.  I have a whole new understanding and compassion for the Iranian people.,1339200000,6,263,4.4375

8431081,1,B004IOWJNA,This film was propaganda. There are more truthful history of the causes and events.,1480982400,,83,5.0

8431084,5,B004IOWJNA,"This is an excellent movie that reveals the TRUTH behind the Islamic Revolution in Iran that began in 79. It gives the true depiction of the unseen forces that, in my opinion, were the catalyst for the majority of issues we now have in the Middle East. If you want the truth, from someone who actually lived it and not the watered down Hollywood BS that Argo had to offer, this is your movie! A MUST SEE!",1447459200,2,404,4.259740259740259
8431085,5,B004IOWJNA,"THIS IS AN AWESOME MOVIE. This film reveals the truth. I like the way the filming is done, to blend in with the late 70's video. I give it 5 out of 5 because I'm going to watch it again, and I've never watched a movie twice.",1447200000,,224,3.7872340425531914
8431086,2,B004IOWJNA,"Another loser.  Audio sucked, video sucked.
The story is not bad... just filmed poorly.
Artsy types might like the way it was filmed... just not for me.
Your mileage may vary.
If the portrayal of the brutality of the aya-toilet's regime is true, ... and sadly it probably is... we should have learned to get the hell out of the Middle
East back then... yet 35+ years later there we are.",1447027200,,386,4.436619718309859
8431087,1,B004IOWJNA,A guy reading from a transcript and some community theater people walking in and out of scenes...this was so terrible and appears to be put together as a  middle school class project.  Do not waste your monies....Five paid folks posted reviews before me...scam.,1447027200,,261,5.046511627906977
8431088,5,B004IOWJNA,I loved it! So much better than watching some big star movie....I would rather watch a good independent movie like this than some kind of Hollywood trash like ARGO.,1446854400,2,164,4.689655172413793
