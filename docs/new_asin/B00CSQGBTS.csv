8585833,5,B00CSQGBTS,All the HoodsWoods videos by Ron and Karen Hood are great.  If you learn what they are teaching you will be able to survive in an emergency.  Ron is very funny and he holds your attention and really knows his stuff.  Had the pleasure to meet him and he was as nice in person as he seems on the videos.  We purchased a set for all for of our children and they are teaching their children these timeless skills.,1375401600,,409,4.139240506329114
