8521191,5,B007R5A1QY,"""The American Dream"" plays much better than those jerky hand held camcorders and there's even a homage to that inserted in the movie. It still manage to retain an edge of professionally done, as I haven't experienced the nauseous seesaw feeling that one get from watching handheld movies. What movie does managed to succeed brilliantly is to haunt me. I kept thinking about long after the movie ended.
First, I want to mention that I am deaf. Though I have a cochlear ear implant, movies are not always understandable to me, no matter how loud it is. The product information does not mention closed captioning (CC) and/or English subtitles. I knew Mr. Walker-Smith was on Twitter and have tweeted him about the possibility of being sent a link to the movie's transcripts, as I've ordered the movie. I and a bunch of other loyal fans continue to follow the careers of the actors from Stargate Universe. Most of the time when I ask about these things, I'd get the standard response of ""I'll look into it"" but Mr. Smith responded right away with a request for my e-mail so that a link could be sent to me. Bethany Clarke who works at little plow films as well as executive producer of the film, was very cordial and generous. The link was provided, I read it, and then settled down to watch the show on my computer. The captioning device is always on. Imagine my complete surprise when the words started to show up! I checked the box and it says all the way on the bottom of the back of the DVD case that it's CC for the hearing impaired. It doesn't states it whatsoever on the Amazon page. From another seller, I've learned that it's Amazon that sets the product description up. Nonetheless, an independent film that's CC? Not common at all and way awesome to know!
I am only familiar with Jamil Walker Smith's talents from Stargate Universe as Ronald Greer. In this movie, I don't see Greer at all. I see only Luis and it's a testimony to Mr. Smith's talents to show that.
The film is essentially about two lifelong friends who have signed up for the Marine and had 36 hours left before they get shipped off. The film does not talk about whether the war is wrong or not. It is one of those war that may not even be remembered, as Luis mentioned to his boyhood friend, Ronald. These two are buddies for life. They've got each other's backs and can put up with each other's idiosyncrasies. The film starts off with Luis showing off his world, where he came from and all of the people that he loves are there too. Both of these boys posture a lot for the camera, and it's absolutely hysterical to watch Grandma Betty knock them down. ""What are you talking like that for?"" she asked her grandson, Luis. ""You're like jive talking."" Her constant demand for others to watch their language is spot on. She proved to be my favorite character. You can see the strength in her and the very obvious strong influence on Luis. There's mention of how Grandma's husband was stationed in Japan during WW2, but there's no mention as to whether he made it back or not. I get the feeling that Luis was pretty much raised by Grandma and also by Ronald's mother, who refers to Luis as her second son. The scene between Luis and his mother was very telling. It came out that his mother is in rehab and the feeling is that it's not her first time, that there's tentative hope, however small, that this time the rehab will take and stay that way. . When she talked about why she called her son The Little Buddha, it's obvious that Luis is very much pained by the memories of those times, but the mother is determined to tell the story regardless. By this, she's trying to convey how her son is her whole world and that Luis is leaving her so to speak. There's a lot of unresolved issues between the two, but the love they have for each other, there's no doubt.
I would like to mention how surprised I was by the race of Luis' mother. It was not an essential critical piece of information of how Luis' childhood was affected, especially since there were a lot of other mixing of the races too. What was the point of that? To me, it conveyed that the war didn't just affect one group of people, but cut across the racial lines. You're killed regardless of your skin color. War makes that very clear, especially when Luis and Ronald's regiment are horrifically affected.
Nonetheless, both Luis and Ronald are being shipped off in 36 hours and they intend to live it up. . They let off pent up anxieties about their impending departures through a series of situations. A telling one was where they are on a jungle trail to a Mayan ruin and Ronald freaked out at the idea of being killed before even seeing action. Both of their reasons for doing this is unfolded as the movie goes along. There's no dragging spot. I was briefly confused when the film jumped ahead, but it quickly cleared up. I am interested in everything that's happening on camera to these boys. I've grown to care deeply about Luis, whose hope of attending a film school was dashed by a coldly polite school letter. His mother is in rehab, his girlfriend have left him for another place, the jobs are probably looking bleak for him. What is his chances of making it out there in the real world? The military branches pay for the school tuition of those who've completed a tour so education is his key out of the environment he's in. . Ronald is seeking a way to help support his pregnant girlfriend. He's trying to man up to this. The impending birth of his child is the only thing that linked him back to ""real life at home"", especially when we see him crack under the pressure of war. Luis' reactions, nay, the expression on Jamil Walker Smith's face is testimony to the man's talents at showing a friend at loss for words as his brother for life fell to pieces in front of him while they try to wait for back up. It's heart-rending and felt so real.
It was also very telling to see the scenes about their military buddies, especially when they went stir crazy and created a show within a show. These guys were like Luis and Ronald. They've also come from dead end places in hope of improving their lots and again, it's shown that war cut across racial lines. Anyone can die and one never really knows who's gonna be next. We've gotten to know these grunts and we are devastated too by their absences. We want these boys to make it back in one piece. We want them to succeed at their American Dream. But war does not care about your dreams or not. It only cares about decimating the enemy, whether it be them or us. Dreams mean diddle squat out there. Luis and Ronald are our brothers, our sons, our uncles, our dads, etc and it's really sad to see that they felt that this was the only solution to get to where they want to be. They thought they knew what a hero was supposed to be, about fighting for freedom, about becoming a man, about sacrifice, even the ultimate sacrifice. Is it worth it? Was it worth it? Do they come back? The answer lies at the end of the movie, the quiet still looks as the relatives' faces stare into the camera. Long after the film have ended, you will find yourself still thinking about the haunting quality of it.
Other SGU trivia- Mr. Smith's character's name  in SGU was RONALD Greer. Three other people who were in SGU are also in this. Louis Ferreira (whose birth name is LUIS), Ming-Na, and Bradley Stryker, who also has a short film, ""A Weekend To Remember"" out that Mr. Ferreira is also in.
I can see why the film won awards. This film is well made, and the intelligence of the audience is never underestimated, never insulted. All of the talented cast are wonderful and every nuances is there. Everything that these guys love, care, and dislike are here. It's through this prism that we see our boys. And they do become our boys very quickly. One thing that I love about this film is the way the acting just felt so natural, like everyone had a reason and a meaning for being there. The lightning quality was great. I can't comment about sound for obvious reasons, but it sounded pretty good (deaf joke there, folks). I cannot wait to see what else Jamil Walker Smith will bring to the table now. Many others have talked to me of what an incredibly warm human being he is at the opening reception of his film. As evidence by his quick response to my question, I can see how they're right. Bravo and well done! The movie is so worth your time and money.",1345334400,4,8433,4.419665809768637
8521192,5,B007R5A1QY,"I have seen this movie 3 times and still want to watch it again. I absolutely love the story and the storytelling. I think every film student should see this movie as part of their filmmaking course and even non-filmmakers will enjoy it.

8521193,3,B007R5A1QY,"In their last 36 hours before embarking upon a different type of battleground, i.e., the war in Afghanistan, two best friends, Luis and Ronald, will capture on video their countdown moments leading up to their enlistment as Marine Corp. Luis (Jamil Walker Smith, Stargate Universe) and Ronald (Malcolm Goodwin, American Gangster) are polar opposites in terms of personalities; however, both share memories of growing up in Los Angeles and will leave behind families that express mixed emotions about their decision to fight in the war.

Luis is the lighthearted prankster and Ronald is the philosophical soon-to-be father. Luis was abandoned by his father at a very young age and then later in life by a girlfriend that moved to Brooklyn, NY. Although Luis dreams of being a filmmaker someday, his low grades didn't secure a scholarship to the University. Ronald, on the other hand, is shown reading a thought-provoking book while on a beach excursion and in another scene, talking to and rubbing his pregnant girlfriend's belly. Ronald wants to travel the world and provide for his family. Luis and Ronald are exploring a path of self-discovery and unmask painful emotional wounds. For both, the Marine Corp appears to be the only way out of the neighborhood based on lures of their military recruiter.
Luis and Ronald will eventually joyride, party, and one night stand with random girls who are looking for a carefree time as well. Other film footage captures close relatives and friends giving goodbyes and farewell speeches that interweave piercing political messages. While in Afghanistan, the filming of their experience resumes as they bond with other young adults, with similar hopes and dreams.

The American Dream is redolent of raw emotion and sorrowful pain which can be expected where the topic is war and serving one's country. Even so, writer and director Jamil Walker Smith aimed for more than a typical war story. When commenting about making the film, these thoughts ensued, `We weren't making a film about war...we were making a film that questions a ""system"" that leaves young people with no better alternative than going to war. A system that appeals to young people's self-interests, and, in turn, puts them in a position of self-sacrifice."" The American Dream won Best Director at the 2011 Urbanworld Film Festival. That same year, The American Dream was the recipient of the New Visions Award at the Cinequest Film Festival. The film's strength is its authentic portrayal of how one may easily get cornered into joining the military. The glaring drawback was the collapse or disconnect between the visual images and the music. There are scenes that drag and/or belabor the point but overall one quickly gets the Director's drift.",1341187200,3,2754,5.1042128603104215
