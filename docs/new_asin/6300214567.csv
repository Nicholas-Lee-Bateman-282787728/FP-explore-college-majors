238150,5,6300214567,"This movie is inmensely entertaining, with a great script and great acting (which earned Harrison Ford his only Oscar Nomination). The film succeeds as a romance, drama and police thriller. The action-packed ending is great  and the forbidden-love relationship between Kelly McGuillis and Harrison  Ford is provocative. Very realistic and entertaining. This is a real  winner!",950400000,3,376,5.678571428571429
238151,4,6300214567,"This film was magical for me, and I've always enjoyed the topic of forbidden love.  For those who haven't seen this movie, other reviewers have spelled out the plot very nicely.
The heart of the story is the  juxtaposition of the hardened, big city detective in the midst of Amish  country, and it centers on his relationship with a young, beautiful Amish  woman and her son.  Exteme opposites that do, indeed, attract.  The sparks  fly between them and keeps the viewer captivated (at least it did for me).  Kelly McGillis played an exceptional role in this film (her first film, I  believe).  I'd rate it as her best performance by a long shot.  It was also  one of Harrison Ford's better roles.  And Lukas Haas was very convincing in  all but one scene.
The cinematography and Jarre's music was lovingly  layered, and displayed throughout the Pennsylvania local.  The barn raising  scene was especially wonderful, and gives the viewer a true yearning for a  simpler, more family-oriented life.
Not everything worked in this  picture, however.  In a couple of places the editing seemed haphazardly  done.  The scene where the cops are on the front porch of Ford's sister and  questioning her is an example (the voice-over didn't work at all).  Also,  the scene at the end when Sommer is leading Ford and McGillis out from the  barn, you could almost sense the director calling ""action"" and the scene  beginning.  Pretty disturbing for this caliber of film.  Another minor  annoyance was when Danny Glover, after being shot, raises the shotgun  toward the ceiling with one hand and pulls the trigger.  There was  absolutely no recoil.  I don't have a clue why this scene wasn't redone.  Anyone who knows anything about firearms will shake their heads.  Finally,  and more importantly, the `bad' cops just weren't convincing as real  people...ala...human flesh and blood.  They seemed to be punched out from  the standard Hollywood cookie-cutter.
That's a lot of stuff not to like  in one of my favorite films (I also have several more minor items that I  didn't mention).  But I forgave these transgressions to my suspension of  disbelief, and ended up really enjoying this film.  I haul it out every so  often just to be transported to another world and watch a great love story  done to perfection (no melodramatic ""smaltz"" here).  Between 1 and 10, I  give ""Witness"" a marginal 8.  A little more care in those areas I mentioned  and this could have been a 10.",947980800,8,2463,4.814457831325301
238152,5,6300214567,While the actors did a WONDERFUL job portraying the characters in the movie - I feel that the underlying brilliance is in the story itself. With the twists and turns of a first rate book - Pam Wallace carefully weaves  her masterpiece into a truly awesome masterpeice. GREAT JOB PAM - Oscar  winning performance,946425600,,311,4.7407407407407405
238153,5,6300214567,"Harrison Ford is excellent as John Book, a detective who protects a young Amish boy who witnessed a murder.  Critics disliked the portrayal of the Amish culture in the story, but this IS a movie after all and an incredibly  entertaining one.  An excellent adult movie, the graphic language and  violent content would make this something to be viewed by adults prior to  deciding whether younger members of the household be allowed to see it.",911520000,,441,4.826666666666667

238383,3,6300214567,"I have watched Ford's movies set in the 80s or 90s and they were really good. I was expecting this movie to be too, but there was very little development, too much time was spent hiding, it felt more like a story about the Amish people and their customs. When the bad guys finally show up Ford seems to do away with them without much effort, and one of them losses their resolve (do you even have guts?). We don't even get to see the female character run after what she wanted, or some sort of indication that the love story would go somewhere. This was very inconclusive. If you want to watch a light action movie or if you are a fan of Ford you might enjoy it.",1491436800,,662,4.1395348837209305

238583,5,6300214567,"This movie stands the test of time. Harrison Ford, at his handsomest, does a great job as a gritty Philly cop falling in love with an Amish woman. Gorgeous images of Amish life interspersed with some tight thriller scenes. I always find the most powerful scene to be the one where Ford punches out a tourist who is harrassing the Amish men. It arouses in me such a conflicting set of emotions - I want to be on the side of their nonviolence, but deep down it makes me realize I also want to see the retribution. Movies that can make us think while also entertaining us -- priceless!",1486252800,3,582,4.348623853211009

239409,4,6300214567,"More like 3 1/2 stars, but Amazon..... Harrison Ford and his handsome hound dog face are at peak ""movie star"" here - but something about Kelly McGillis' performance just didn't hold up for me. Granted, Kelly's subservient Amish mother character doesn't give her much to say or do, but when she starts making googly eyes at big city detective John Book (Ford) almost immediately, it didn't ring true. Someone like Meryl Streep could have run with this role. Kelly's acting mostly consists of widening her blue eyes periodically. Lukas Haas' performance is still mesmerizing. The script is clunky in places (even when I first watched it as a child, I couldn't figure out why Book would hide out in the exact place that the corrupt cops are most likely to look), but at least it ends as it should. The big thing that dates the movie is the overbearing '80s synthesizer score. Some movie scores only become more haunting and thrilling with time (Vertigo, Carrie), others, not so much....",1484438400,,983,4.822485207100592

239975,5,6300214567,"This is Peter Weir's one of the finest work. I was almost about to skip it and was lucky enogh to own it.
 It is a love story between Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis I would want to say and even her name in this movie is Rachel, just like from the other movie Blade Runner. The legendary SF movie,an android woman that Harrison Ford felt in love with.
 Harrison acts as a cop who works for this case that Kelly McGillis' son witnesses the murder case in the public restroom. The thing is the mother and the son live in this deserted German neighborhood which has no car, no telephone and they are almost like ancient people. They walk slow, talk slow, eat what they grow only. wears only black suits.
 It is the first time this boy and the mother came to the city that this incident happened.
 They are under the custody and Harrison promised them that they will protect them for the witness job. But it was not possible when they found out that the killer was Harrison's colleague and his boss.
 Harrisons got shot and he goes to the lady's neighbor to hide. There he fell in love with the mother of a son, the witness.
 The thing is, the mother is so pure and in some way untouched.
 He couldn't resist but to fall in love with her. He acts perfectly as if he fell in love with the android Sean Young from Blad Runner.
 The movie ends with him killing all the bad cops but he leaves the woman and the son.
 I don't know whether he will come back to them but the case is closed and they are safe now.
 The mood becomes romantic because of the Maurice Jarre's beautiful music. It just keeps us from loving each moments.
 Kelly McGillis is very lovable and she was probably in her 30 or little less but looks like she is still untouched holly woman like figure, every men's dream. (Sorry to say this girls.)
 I know the director for his other films like <DEAD POET'S SOCIETY><GREEN CARD><THE TRUMAN SHOW><Master and Commander><The Mosquito Coast> and the most beautiful movie <Picnic at Hanging Rock> They are all great. you should watch them sometime.",1460505600,,2052,4.385224274406332

240071,5,6300214567,"Witness has held up well. I saw it at the time, the mid 1980s, but my wife had not, so we rented it.

The plot revolves around a small Amish boy who witnesses a murder. Without any spoilers, Ford's character, John Book, a policeman, hides the boy and her mother back at their Amish farm. The police part of the story seems incidental to the real story, the clash of two cultures, Philadelphia and Lancaster County Amish.

The movie is slow, luxuriously slow. Things have time to evolve and to develop. Recommended.",1457308800,6,514,4.576086956521739

240162,4,6300214567,"Witness is a very good film.  It was interesting seeing Danny Glover play a villain police officer after all his turns as a good cop in the Lethal Weapon series.  I noticed Alexander Godunov right away, and thought that's the dude from the Die Hard movie as a the henchman Karl and the orchestra leader Max Beissart in The Money Pit.  It is crazy to see Vigo Mortensen so young basically an extra in this movie as well.

To the movie itself the plot is original and interesting.  All the actors are very good in their roles.  Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis both seem to have a lot of chemistry and it is easy to buy their romance in the movie.  The little boy plays his role very well and has a very innocent look to him.  I found it ironic that Harrison Ford actually was a carpenter before he decided to give acting one more shot before all the Star Wars fame.  I thought the movie accurately portrayed the Amish people without being overly preachy or bible thumping the whole time.  Each character in their community seemed to have their own voice and respect for the rules of their society.  Rachel is not really a rebellious person by nature but she comes to genuinely care for John Book and you can see by the end of the movie that she stands by her faith instead of running off into the sunset.  I found the grandfather figure Eli Lapp a very good character.  It seemed very realistic to me that he would warn his daughter that she would be excommunicated if she pursed a romance with John an outsider.  That it would break his heart not to be able to go to church together and spend time with her and his grandson.  Reminded me a lot of the strict Mormon faith.

The movie is more realistic in the way it ends.  Although I am not so sure that the lead villain would have not blasted John on sight at the end of the movie, before all the townsfolk showed up.  Either way Witness is definitely an interesting movie its slow pace might not be for everybody but the story is solid and gets you thinking.  Overall I would rate Witness 4 to 4 1/2 stars.",1453680000,,2057,4.296103896103896

240384,5,6300214567,"Called to investigate a murder in the men's restroom of Philadelphia's Thirtieth Street Station, John Book (Harrison Ford) discovers that the sole witness is a young Amish boy (Samuel Lapp, played by Lukas Haas), who is on a trip from Lancaster, PA to Baltimore with his recently-widowed mother, Rachel Lapp (Kelly McGillis). When Book takes Samuel to the police station, Samuel spots a picture of a fellow cop, whom he fingers as one of the the perpetrators of the murder. Others in the police force are involved in the murder and its coverup, and Book realizes that he is a marked man. Book takes Samuel and Rachel back to their family in rural Lancaster County, where he tries to blend in with the Amish. Much of the rest of the movie is about Book's attempt to live incognito among the Amish as well as a growing mutual attraction between him and Rachel.

The latter part of the movie provides a reasonably accurate portrayal of Old Order Amish life in Lancaster County, down to the detail of all the bearded Amish men having shaved mustaches. The one (admittedly minor) quibble I have is with the unexplained reference to the ""Ordnung,"" which those who are not already somewhat familiar with the Amish will find confusing. (Briefly, ""Ordnung"" refers to the rules set by the leaders of each Amish district.)

Many of the scenes in Witness were filmed on location. Viewers familiar with the area will recognize some of the landmarks in the Thirtieth Street Station in Philadelphia as well as locations in Amish country.

This movie is worth watching and provides the viewer with a great blend of suspense, romance, and a nice portrayal of the day-to-day life of the Old Order Amish.",1434153600,,1685,4.783505154639175

240539,5,6300214567,"WITNESS is a color movie, taking place in the present area, mostly at a rural community of Lancaster, Pennsylvania inhabited by the Amish. Parts of the movie take place in the grittier parts of Philadelphia. (Perhaps this is a tautology, since Philadelphia has been known, for many decades, as a gritty city.) The characters include Harrison Ford, who plays a young detective in the police force, Danny Glover who plays a corrupt policeman who partners with a couple of other on the police force to sell illegal drugs, Kelly McGillis, who is an Amish woman and who plays the love interest, and Lukas Haas who plays the son of single mother Kelly McGillis. Kelly McGillis has acted in about 27 movies, as of this writing, and Lukas Haas, who was about ten years old at the time of filming, has acted in about 54 movies, as of this writing.

CLEVER PLOT DIRECTIONS. This is such a gripping movie, that I hate to give away too much. At any rate, I will disclose only one of the clever aspects of the plot. Early in the movie, Kelly McGillis and her son set forth from their Amish community to a train station in downtown Philadelphia. Their plan is to visit a relative in Baltimore. In the train station, the son witnesses a murder in the men's room. From the partly open door of the toilet stall, he sees Danny Glover and another man murder a man who is busy washing his face in the sink. The boy hides in the toilet stall. Within minutes, the murder victim is found, and Harrison Ford is brought to the scene of the crime, and he is the first to interview the boy. There are a few cute scenes, where the mother and son, both dressed in somber Amish garb, are noticed by typical city folk, and are apparently considered an amusing curiosity. At any rate, Harrison Ford brings the boy to the police station, where he is shown a lineup of about ten suspects, and where he is shown hundreds of photos in a book of suspects. The boy responds that none of these are the murderer. The boy ambles about the busy police office. Some employees are busy booking a petty criminal. Other employees are busy typing. Other employees are busy walking too and fro. The boy is fascinated, and he freely explores the busy office, until he comes to a small museum-type display of baseball statues, police paraphernalia, and newspaper clippings. One of the newspaper clippings shows Danny Glover, winning some sort of award. The photo in the clipping is in black and white, and the photo itself is somewhat fuzzy. But the boy recognizes him immediately, and reports this to Harrison Ford. In my opinion, this is one of the most clever moments every committed to film, and it represents one of the distinct turning points in the entire repertoire of American screenwriting.

CULTURE CLASHES. As it turns out, Harrison Ford needs to live with the Amish for several weeks. (I am not giving away the reason!!!) Amusing culture clashes occur, where Harrison Ford is provided with an Amish man's outfit, which is all black, and comes with a round wide-brimmed hat. The result is almost comedic. Eventually, Harrison Ford becomes accepted into the community, because he proves himself to be a hard worker and, in particular, skilled in carpentry. He repairs a large wooden birdhouse, he uses a plane with great skill for smoothening wood, he uses a manual drill skillfully during the assembly of a large wooden barn, and he does not complain when he is required to wake up at 4:30 in the morning to milk the cows. The love interest develops very gradually, and the viewer will be impressed by Harrison Ford's behavior in refraining from being too forward with Kelly McGillis. He refrains from being too forward because, in his own words, he realizes that Kelly McGillis might be driven out of her community. In fact, her father expressly tells he that she risks being driven out. The father uses the technical term for this, which is being ""shunned."" Another quaint aspect of the Amish, as disclosed in the movie, is the fact that Harrison Ford has a wound in his abdomen, and one of the Amish elders realizes that the wound will likely be infected, and so he ""treats"" the wound with a mixture of milk and linseed oil. The dialogue, at least for the parts of the movie that are filmed on the rural farm, are peppered with German, though it is apparent that all of the Amish are bi-lingual. Another culture class is that between the Amish and the Mennonites, who lived in a nearby community. The issue is that the Mennonites allow themselves to use some modern devices and machinery, while the Amish are circumspect in avoiding these things. Yet another culture class, takes place when the Amish drive into town in their horse'n'buggy devices, and are met with derision by young hoodlums in the town. The hoodlums harass the Amish, complaining that the buggy is blocking traffic, and complaining that the Amish never serve in the military. Harrison Ford responds by calmly climbing out of the buggy, ambling up to one of the hoodlums, and driving his fist directly into the hoodlum's nose, resulting in the hoodlum becoming an unintentional blood donor.

The film also discloses that the Amish are considered to be freaks by out-of-town visitors, who gawk at them and shove cameras into their faces, and this leads up to an amusing moment involving a gentle confrontation between Harrison Ford and an elderly tourist. Please picture Harrison Ford dressed in Amish garb, black pants that are four inches too short, a black jacket, and a round wide-brimmed black hat. The tourist is a wrinkled old lady dressed in a cheap Woolworth blouse. The blouse has a splashy red pattern in the poorest taste. The old lady tries to take Harrison Ford's picture. Harrison Ford warns her, ""If you take my picture I'm gonna rip of your brassiere!""

CHARMING DISCLOSURE OF THE HUMAN CONDITION. This film provides a slice of life disclosure of the human condition. Although the film concerns police corruption, and culture clashes of various kinds, I believe that there are some universal lessons to be learned from the story. Throughout the film, the continual cat-and-mouse activities involving the corrupt employees of the police force and Harrison Ford and his new-found Amish friends, provide more than enough thrilling suspense to those who respond favorably to suspenseful action movies. FIVE STARS.",1429401600,,6358,4.772025431425976
240540,3,6300214567,"I read some of the reviews on the Blu-ray version of this movie. I know it was recorded over 20 years ago, but I was a little disappointed that it wasn't remastered  better (or at all). There was a lot of washed out scenes during the film, which I wouldn't have expected in Blu-ray format. In fact, I compared it to an older DVD that I had in my collection, and except for the aspect ration 'distortion', I'm not sure if the landscape scenes were any clearer. I am referring to landscape scenes, since this movie was filmed in Lancaster, PA (Amish Country) and I expected the Blu-ray disc to show the beauty of the farm lands, but was disappointed after spending $38.00 for this Japanese Import. Everything on the case is in Japanese, and I could barely make out that is was 1080p, but couldn't find the total time of the movie. I gave it three stars because the movie is great, but disappointed with the video quality.

Actually, shortly after providing my review on this Blu-ray, I watched the same video on Amazon Instant Video in HD, and the quality of this streaming experience was slightly better than the Blu-ray disc overall. So I can't figure out that one and I'm even more disappointed now than I was three weeks ago.",1429142400,5,1227,4.497757847533633

240679,4,6300214567,"The sympathetic portrayal of the Amish and their values, set against the corruption of Ford's world, makes this a worthwhile experience. Given the deterioration of character in modern America, it's hard not to wonder whether a reversion to a righteous, rural, low-tech existence might be a positive thing. The film does a good job of posing the question. The Amish views about war, weaponry and physical violence are especially compelling. There are a number of well-staged moments where the viewer thinks, ""maybe this is a better way.""

But the story itself is a mess. The main plot is a tired one--corrupt cops are involved in drug trafficking and Ford has to set things right. The subplot has all the interest, and involves Ford hiding out in an Amish community. All the interesting things in the film steer the action away from the main plot. Ford confronts Amish values, gets involved with an Amish woman, helps raise a barn, and so on. All really good stuff, except that none of it makes any sense, given that he's letting time pass and doing nothing to apprehend the bad cops. Finally a showdown occurs because the cops find him. A protagonist can't be that passive. To add to the problems, Ford blows his stack (and his credibility) by attacking some locals who are making fun of the Amish, and this is what leads the cops to him.

So forget the story and enjoy the culture clash.",1423872000,,1388,4.707818930041152

Rich, full, powerful. Thanks to the composer, conductor and musicians for an enriching and uplifting experience. From a romantic standpoint, the storyl was sad in a way. And yet we know that John Book wouldn't have prospered in the Amish community, and Rachael would've been lost in the world of the ""English"". Very sad because there was enormous mutual attraction there, but one doomed to failure... and they both seemed to know it. Life is like that, sometimes.",1421193600,,632,4.971698113207547

Kelly McGuiness is the person who makes this movie worthwhile for guys to watch.  She is downright S-E-X-Y in this movie.  That is taken into play as she has ""urges"" and Ford is the likely recipient of her love even though she is married.

While there, Book tries to integrate into the community including building a barn.  Music supplied in the film is Maurice Jarre, father of Jean-Michel Jarre.  His barn raising song is widely known.",1407196800,,708,4.653225806451613

The plot takes you on a journey where it contrasts the rural, quiet life on an Amish farm compared to the fast, hard life of a city policeman. The story is written around a crime and its evil doers, but the important real story (to me) is the confrontation between the leading characters fighting to understand how to react in their new found situation and a possible love affair that overshadows everything else.

241348,5,6300214567,"This is an incredible film--and not just because it stars Harrison Ford. We get a sensitve, non-condescending portrayal of one Amish community, combined with a crime thriller and an unusual romance. Also Ford shows some of his real handiwork in carpentry. Little Samuel witnesses his father's funeral, then in a strange urban setting, he witnesses the murder of a police informant. When Ford, wounded by the bad guys, returns Rachel and her child to their home for safety, he witnesses the Amish lifestyle and the community's love of family and one another. Trained policeman that he is, Ford has trouble fitting into the non-violent response of the Amish to abuse by outsiders. He does manage to restrain his attraction to Rachel after he witnesses more of her body than he ought to, but we do see that her religious faith does not kill her womanly desires. Finally, in the closing chase scene, where Ford exercises plenty of violent self-defense, the ultimate victory comes when the whole community stands to witness the actions of both him and his enemy. This is one of my favorite scenes, where a group of ""hayseed"" farmers conquer an armed killer, one who seems to have sold even his conscience. An unusual story, with lots of twists and turns, this film is unexpectedly moving. I highly recommend that everyone witness this story.",1378080000,10,1336,4.915929203539823

241501,5,6300214567,"My bargain-rack movie for last night was ""Witness"" starring Harrison Ford. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. It was a good movie, and quite interesting too. Ford played a Philadelphia narcotics detective who was called in to investigate a train-station murder of a second narcotics officer in a restroom at the station. It turned out that there was a witness, a young (about 5) Amish boy hiding in one of the stalls and not detected by the killer because the boy was standing on the toilet when the killer looked under the doors of the stalls. Ford then took the boy and his mother to the police station and detained them from going on their planned trip to Baltimore. The boy viewed several line-ups and a number of mug-shot photos but could not identify the killer. However, in looking around the Philadelphia police station, the boy spotted a large photo on the wall and said that man was the killer. It was a third narcotics officer. Well, Ford immediately went to his superior with the startling news of the positive identification. That, it turned out, was a bad mistake in that the Superior Officer was also in on the killing plan and now Ford, and his partner, were also in danger of losing their lives as well as the young boy. The whole situation was a corrupt quagmire and Ford, the mother and the boy had to escape and they returned to the family's home in the Amish part of Pennsylvania until the FBI might be able to sort things out. Nobody knew where they were until late in the movie.

Okay, in terms of the crime/murder story, it was a somewhat routine mystery movie and was well done. What really makes the film stand out is that about 3/4 of the movie was shot in Amish country and probably using an abundance of the Amish people as ""supporting actors"" in the movie. Actually most of them weren't acting at all, they were just the local people going about  their daily lives. It was an extremely interesting backdrop. This area is, after all, one of the most unique cultural areas of the United States. The movie was exceptional in this respect and you felt as if you were actually there in Amish country. That, in my opinion takes a four-star movie and lifts it to five stars. Well Done!

Peter Weir directs--and he is known for beautiful film making. I love the wheat fields blowing in the wind. If you don't know the story--without ruining it--a young Amish boy and his recently widowed mother are travelling to visit relatives, but while stopping in Grand Central Station to await their next train the boy witnesses the murder of an undercover cop in the public restroom.

A young 8-year-old Amish boy, Samuel Lapp (Lukas Haas), and his mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis) go to the train station in Philadelphia on their way to visit Rachel's sister. In the station cloakrooms, Samuel witnesses a murder. Although Samuel could not identify the killer from books of suspects, he does identify him from a newspaper photograph of James McFee (Danny Glover). Police officer McFee was previously a suspect when a haul of narcotics went missing from the evidence locker. Detective John Book (Harrison Ford) is put in charge of the case with his partner Sergeant Elton Carter (Brent Jennings). Book presents this only evidence to his superior, Chief Paul Schaeffer (Josef Sommer), but when Book is ambushed by McFee as soon as he gets home he realizes that Schaeffer is corrupt too. Book returns the Lapps to their home but collapses from his injuries. As a result of nursing him, Rachel gradually falls in love with Book but their romance can never flourish.

In Witness we have a seasoned Philadelphia cop seek sanctuary in a Pennsylvania Amish community.  The visual scenes are spectacular and many will take up permanent resident is a happy spot in your brain (just try to forget the ""Don't know much"" scene and the barn-raising).  I have watched this movie at least ten times and find something new to marvel at each time- the last being the waving wheat in the opening scene.  There is a procedural cop story but it stayed in the background for me- I was focused on trying to become a better person from the Amish along with John Book (our hero cop).  Watch it; buy it; give it as a gift to the people you love.  And be careful among those English.

Oh, I realized at the end that I might be reviewing the CD not the DVD.  The music is spectacular.  I play it during yoga sessions.

The fact that the majority of this movie takes place on an Amish farm helps that illusion. This is one of Harrison Ford's better movies and the acting from the supporting cast is good.

Harrison Ford still plays a rough, tough guy, but he shows a vulnerability that wasn't readily available in previous roles.  The look at Pennsylvania Amish society is well-done and fascinating, although I'm sure it's not 100% accurate.  I've got to say that this is my favorite Kelly McGillis role, after being underwhelmed by her in Top Gun, etc.  I wish Danny Glover had more screen time, as he is little more than a bad guy/thug.  Some of the smaller roles are filled by very recognizable faces.  Go watch Die Hard and the Lord of the Rings Trilogy before or after this and you'll see what I mean.

241774,5,6300214567,"""Witness"" (1985 Paramount) starring Harrison Ford is the most important movie ever made set in Lancaster County Pennsylvania old order Amish country telling their story!

It's a thriller movie about a Philadelphia PA police detective (Ford)""on the lam"" in Amish country, and being hidden by old order Amish types on their large Lancaster County PA farm.

We get to see old order Amish life in this movie, and in a sense the movie is a quasi documentary about an interesting but seldom treated subject in USA life.....the old order Amish in Lancaster County PA and how they live and get treated in a world they don't agree with and which doesn't agree with them.

I live in Lancaster County Pennsylvania (Columbia PA near Lancaster City PA), and watch the old order Amish show in my area.....they work at the ""Columbia Market"" which is an enclosed large brick 19th century restored building in the 5,000 person town of Columbia PA USA, located exactly on the Susquehanna River where US Route 30 (the ""Lincoln Highway"") crosses the river on it's way to Oregon on the West Coast.

The Amish show here in Lancaster County PA is quite a show, and food for thought. ""Witness"" (1985 Paramount) is a brilliant telling of the old order Amish story, and a brilliant picturization of those people and their lives, habitat.

It's sort of a documentary done by Hollywood's best technical people....nothing touches it.

It was nominated for Best Picture Academy Award and got beat out by trendy ""Wall Street"" starring Michael Douglas in the Reagan years when Hollywood Democrats fired movies aimed at heartless (probably Republican!) businessmen like Gorden Gekko, played by Michael Douglas.

But ""Witness"" (1985 Paramount), a quieter, simpler, non-big city movie was nominated, too........and deserved to be.

It's a classic all should see, including the old order Amish, who never get to see it due to the rules about no TV's, movies, etc. part of their culture and lives.

Oh, well....nobody's perfect, including them!

Harrison Ford mostly underplays the hunted cop and Kelly McGillis, as the widowed Amish mother of the boy, is absolutely lovely and does a good job  in support of the star. Other performers are also admirable, although the Police Chief is forced into a pretty stereotyped behavior pattern at the end.

241828,3,6300214567,"I saw this movie a long time ago, probably mid-nineties, and today I thought I'd re-watch it. I remembered it being really romantic and beautiful.... I must have remembered wrong.

PROS.
Harrison Ford! He is a great actor. Maybe he has only one character that he plays (the rough-around-the-edges-but-softie-at-heart guy who is good at fighting) but he plays that character well. He's probably the most believable character in the movie.

Forbidden love. I am a sucker for reasonable (not taboo) forbidden/discouraged love. And the setup seems good enough... Amish woman, tough cop.

CONS.
So many inconsistencies! I have never studied Amish customs and yet I know Rachael would never have been allowed to be alone with John or care for him alone. Rachael seems to have nothing vested into her faith or any emotional ties to her diseased husband. Literally days after her husband dies she falls in love with John Book. I guess he was her rebound. I need to go back and see exactly how much dialogue was exchanged between John and Rachael. Seriously, they say NOTHING to each other and the audience is left not sure what to think.

Even though Ford was great, John Book's character AND Rachael's characters are both so lifeless. You don't really get to know much about their motivations or personalities past a certain shallow point. This is the key element of a romance... identifying with a character and seeing real humanness in them.

WAIT. I do know one thing about John Book. He is a serious creeper. He just stands there and watches Rachael bathe herself, shamelessly staring, going on the ASSUMPTION that she digs him, too. Or something. I don't know. But that really creeped me out. I feel like that scene was written to be the artsy-moody-shocking-nudity scene. Except it was none of those. It just perplexed me and felt exceedingly awkward to watch.

Another huge reason the film was terrible: The kid who played Samuel. He was almost as bad as the kid who played Anakin Skywalker.

The music. Oh my word, the music. It was so out of place and so very 80s. I really feel like a classic soundtrack might have been able to help this movie become a little more timeless. But nope, opening credits cue up to what will be the rest of the soundtrack: echo-y, keyboard-y synth that doesn't even try to sound like real instruments.

The innumerable and over-the-top predictable silent gazes. Oh boy, cue another excruciating longing look between the lovestruck pair. In some scenes it was almost comedic. If only they had spent some time having conversations instead of exchanging tortured looks. Maybe then their romance would have been more realistic. Maybe then this movie would have made more sense.

The worst part is the ending. Seriously, WHO DIES BY BEING SHOWERED IN GRAIN?! And why didn't all the Amish folks hear the SHOTGUNS going off? Then the little boy rings the bell (a much quieter sound by far) and THEN they come running. I LOL'd when they started coming over the hill like the cavalry or something...? Oh, and don't forget about grandpa motioning to Samuel to ring the bell in PLAIN VIEW of his kidnapper... But the best part is probably how the big time bad guy just hands over his gun to John! No way. He was desperate and manipulative and smart. Or, he was SUPPOSED to be. Why would he just let go of his gun and then slump over into a doorway like ""oh well. I give up. It's not like I had a gun and the power and am a psychopath or anything.""

This movie leaves me feeling ""meh."" Like... what was the point? I needed a clear conflict and a CLEAR resolution. The conflict was sort of clear... forbidden love, attraction anyway... but the resolution was... John leaves. Okay. Without a scene of conversation or revelation! Sigh.",1314748800,,3752,4.723241590214068
241829,1,6300214567,"This movie is excellent. The low rating is for this version of the film.

It's been a long time since I last saw this movie, and that was an old taped-from-TV version. But I'm certain there was at least one scene that was in the original that was not in this DVD. Why would they do that? Take out scenes from a movie? Makes sense if it's on TV, need to edit it down for space. But why on DVD? There may have been other information taken out.

Additionally, it says on the box that it is widescreen and ""the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen are normal."" Definitely no bars. Definitely no widescreen.",1313971200,4,612,4.177966101694915
241830,1,6300214567,"I can't say I'm a movie connoisseur, but I did not really enjoy this movie. Though I'm a huge fan of Harrison Ford, I don't believe this was one of his best films. The plot might have been original when this movie first debuted, but in 2011 the main plot elements (child witnesses murder, child needs protection from bad guys, witness gets caught in the middle of a good cop/dirty cop war) just aren't that new. What's more, more than half of this movie seems to consist of really slow (though I'm sure interesting to some) events like milking cows, barn-raising (it felt like they showed the entire barn-raising), and sponge bathing. The ""love"" story between Ford's character and the Amish woman felt forced, inauthentic, and certainly unsatisfying at the end. In general, you would be better off watching one of Harrison Ford's other movies such as Air Force One, Clear and Present Danger, or one of the first three Indiana Jones movies. Don't waste your time or money on this movie.",1313798400,2,985,4.732558139534884
241831,5,6300214567,"Witness is a very fine film with only one or two flaws.  Perhaps the only real flaw is the moment when the father (Jan Rubes) gestures to his grandson to get the gun.  This is a betrayal of the whole tenor of the Amish side of things -- it was unnecessary, one of those ""Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" moments characteristic of American film where in spite of the rhetoric, a gun is the ultimate solution.  Some things were a bit hamhanded -- for example, we didn't need every one of the hot glimpses between the lovers in the barn raising.  The last scene of all revealed Harrison Ford's limitations: he just looks, and looks -- the laconic American -- and it gets a little boring.

But the film is lovely and spacious -- I had forgotten the first five minutes, all in Pennsylvania Dutch/German (!).  And of course the barn raising is special:  this is what a real community does.  There is something not quite strong enough about the community witnessing at the end as the final weapon -- it should have been ramped up a bit I feel.  The community should have somehow gotten in the way and made the difference more strikingly.

The best things are Weir's cinematography (especially in the erotic lamplit night scenes), and Jarre's great score (I prefer the barn raising passacaglia with an orchestra myself as opposed to the electronic score, but it really does give you a feeling for why a passacaglia and fugue can be driving and emotional -- for those who think Bach is boring).  Oh yes, and then there's Kelly McGillis half naked.  Why someone doesn't rerelease Reuben, Reuben is a mystery to me.",1300406400,2,1601,4.578947368421052
241832,5,6300214567,"This is an all-round wonderful picture.  The essential interest is the contrast between the cynical world of a Philadelphia homicide detective and the bucolic, spiritual life of the Amish, in Lancaster County, not that far away geographically, but worlds away in lifestyle.  The story portrays the Amish community with great respect and sensitivity, neither romanticizing them or diminishing them.  Well, maybe it does lean a little towards romanticism.

No matter, the life that the film shows the Amish living is a beautiful life.  There is an amazing scene in which the community rallies together to raise a barn in one day for a newlywed couple.

The cast is perfect.  Harrison Ford plays the somewhat jaded but still decent cop.  He looks perfect in a cheap khaki suit.  Kelly McGillis is nothing short of superb as the young Amish widow whose path crosses his, with unexpected consequences.  She plays it just right doing the difficult balance between her respect for her family and tradition and her undeniable feelings for the cop.

There are other wonderful performances.  Alexander Gudenov is wonderfully charming as the cop's competition.  If you look closely, you'll see a young, very cute Viggo Mortensen as Gudenov's brother.
The child who plays the young Amish boy is perfectly cast and totally believable and lovable as the witness.

The romance between the woman and the cop is beautifully shown...the restraint that's built into the situation (he's living in her father's house under the watchful eyes of the whole community) adds enormously to the tension of the romance.  So much is said with glances and McGillis has the eyes to convey what she dares not say with words.

Balancing the gentleness of the almost-romance is the violence of the criminals.  Weir balances it all together masterfully.  It could have been a mess in other hands but in his, it is a small but lovely masterpiece.",1290297600,2,1909,5.025477707006369

(There's one very brief scene of Kelly McGillis in her petticoat skirt with breasts bared, but it doesn't seem to have any real erotic overtones to me.)  Rachel Lapp (McGillis) is a young Amish widow from Lancaster County who is taking her son Samuel (Lukas Haas) to visit her pregnant sister in Baltimore when, waiting for their connection in the Philadelphia railroad station, the boy inadvertantly sees a man murdered in the men's room and gets a good look at one of the killers.  Homicide detective John Book (Harrison Ford) is assigned to the case and is surprised but not, on second thought, overly so when Samuel fingers narco cop McFee (Danny Glover).  His mistake turns out to be telling his superior, Capt. Schaeffer (Josef Sommer), who turns out to be just as dirty as McFee.  Attacked in a parking garage, Book realizes that he has to get the Lapps out of Philadelphia if they're to have any hope of survival.  But the wound he suffers forces him to take refuge in the house of Rachel's father-in-law, Eli (Jan Rubes), where as time goes by he begins to understand that Samuel isn't the only witness in this affair: Book himself is becoming one to the quiet joys and satisfactions of the Amish way of life--and a mutual attraction is growing between him and Rachel.  Meanwhile, time is growing short as Schaeffer discovers where Book and the Lapps are hiding.

This suspenseful thriller is one of the best (and most popular) of Ford's mid-career work, and he does a very good job as a jaded plainclothesman suddenly exposed to beliefs and lifestyles he's never known before.  Though not for families with young kids, it may serve as a talking point for those with teens, and adults who are fans of this type of movie should find it very satisfying.",1283558400,,1948,4.6725146198830405

Officer `BOOK' played by Harrison Ford loses his own personal safety as he struggles through this investigation that can save the little boys life, ... and his own.

You have tremendous suspense, a top-flight popular actor as the hero, a touching romance story, plenty of action, a different kind of setting than normal, people you care about, nice photography, very moral and very immoral people, a little humor.....I mean.....this is how it's done.

I also liked the wholesome female lead Kelly McGillis (although she was the only Amish character out of character, a bit loose than what you would ever find) and who didn't think young Lukas Haas was the cutest kid they ever saw on film?

There are many memorable scenes in this movie, from the young Amish boy ""Samuel"" (Haas) hiding in the bathroom stall as a murder takes place; Ford slugging some goon who was making fun of the Amish; Ford and McGillis dancing in the hayloft to an old rock 'n roll tune; the Amish lifestyles and the raising of the barn; and the suspenseful ending.

PETER WEIR'S FIRST AMERICAN FILM IS ALSO HIS FINEST TO DATE. PART THRILLER, PART ROMANCE, PART ANTHROPOLOGICAL ESSAY, IT CONCERNS THE EVENTS THAT FOLLOW A YOUNG BOY'S WATCHFUL PRESENCE OF A MURDER. THE COP INVESTIGATING THE CASE FINDS OUT THAT THE CULPRITS ARE CORRUPT COLLEAGUES, AND HIS OWN LIFE THREATENED. HE RETURNS TO THE HOME OF THE BOY AND HIS MOTHER TO HIDE AWAY. THUS FAR THE THRILLER. ROMANCE TAKES OVER FOR A WHILE AS HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH THE MOTHER, BUT THE FILM ALSO TURNS INTO A TOUCHING PORTRAIT OF THE ENORMOUS GAP BETWEEN THE COP'S URBAN CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND THAT OF HIS HOSTS, THE AMISH. DESPITE A LACK OF STRUCTURAL UNITY, THE FILM HAS MUCH TO OFFER IN TERMS OF ITS QUIETLY UNDERSTATED PERFORMANCES, ITS LUMINOUS IMAGERY AND ITS DISPASSIONATE VIEWS OF THE TWO WORLDS GEOGRAPHICALLY CLOSE, BUT SPIRITUALLY, WORLDS APART.

On the second viewing, after several decades, the cracks are too obvious.  I just wasn't convinced by the plot.  Harrison Ford recovers too quickly from a bullet wound.  The love affair didn't feel realistic--a hard nosed, city cop and a very innocent Amish woman.  The bad guys find Ford and we don't quite know how.  The nude scene was obviously to show off the Amish girl's physical attributes.  The list of flaws goes on.

The acting is okay; the boy and the female lead are actually very good.  Ford, the star, is a bit stony and is too easily taken with Kelly McGillis.  The barn raising was a cliche for any story involving Amish.  The violent finale was predictable.  The Lancaster County scenery was nice.

But the fatal flaw, from my standpoint, was that the story line just fell far short of being convincing.  After that, the good points can't save this.",1226620800,,1020,4.7102272727272725

I hadn't seen it at the theater so I was impressed when I saw it on TV the first time and sorry I had missed it on the big screen. Eventually she replaced her VHS with DVD and so I never bought a copy since I could borrow hers. I'm not waiting any longer to get my own copy with this edition at such an incredible price. Ford, Haas, McGillis, and the rest the cast are exceptional in this movie. The story, acting, sets, music and directing are above most movies and the majority of people will see that clearly. Imagine a young boy witnessing a murder of a police officer and then being pursued by unknown forces. A detective, played by Ford, assigned to his case finds they have opened a can of worms. There is a distinct smell of police corruption as they are pursued by other officers. The beautiful scenes like the barn raising in the Amish community are great with a real feel of their culture and life. Excellent quality DVD with tons of extras. Excellent replayability. I also recommend getting Amazon Prime if you buy much at Amazon since it will more than pay you back not only in shipping costs but delivery time too. If you enjoyed this catch ""Narrow Margin"", ""The Client"", ""Witness Protection"", and even ""Eraser"" for some Schwarzenegger style witness protection. - C.

242021,4,6300214567,"Witness is a phenominal movie. It is interesting, exciting, and portrays well, for the most part, life within the Amish community. They do a good job of interfacing the simpler lives of the Amish with the insanity that is modern life for most of us. Harrison Ford is always a pleasure to watch; Kelly McGillis is excellent. Lucas Haas in his premier role as the witness is amazing.

One of the most well-worth it scenes is the barn raising. Not only are the visuals excellent, but the music... the music is magical. You can't watch this and not be moved by the truly incredible music.",1213142400,,584,4.561904761904762

242026,5,6300214567,"A young Amish boy (Samuel Lapp played beautifully in his film debut by Lukas Haas) while traveling with his mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis) witnesses a murder.  The Philly detective assigned to the case is John Bock (Harrison Ford), a cynical, hardened, yet very ethical man who is married to his job.  The murder turns out to be an inside job performed by Bock's associates on the police force.  The three of them soon escape to the Amish community to avoid being the next victims and soon... well, that's what you need to find out when you watch this fine film.

This is an excellent film any way you slice it.  Great acting, writing, directing, musical score, etc...  It is my favorite film by director Peter Weir and in my opinion the best performance of Ford's career.  It's a nice change of pace to see Ford actually come down to Earth and play a common man instead of the super-hero he so often portrays. He had quite an amazing run of very successful films in the 80's and 90's but it's very difficult at times to take him too seriously as a dramatic actor despite the money making machines a great many of his films turned out becoming.  Yet he's fantastic as John Book!  He is so much more accessible and unguarded, and it's beautiful to watch.  The man truly can act!  Anyway, it's a shame he hasn't played more parts like this one (see ""The Mosquito Coast"" and ""Frantic"" for two other excellent examples).

I have to be quite honest and finally get this off of my chest - I have never thought Kelly McGillis could act!  This is her best performance, and yet, I don't think she is all that convincing as an Amish woman.  Her performance, for me, is the only real flaw in this film (not enough to dock a star though!) She is so stiff and unimpassioned, and I'm not sure if she was trying to speak with an Amish accent or not, but if she was, heaven help her.  The three or four other films I have seen her in, before she descended into being a B-movie star or Lifetime Television regular, she pretty much played the same wooden, passionless character.  Somebody tell me I am wrong or being too harsh.  I apologize to all of you Kelly McG fans out there!

The film also had some very fine performances in supporting roles.  Lukas Haas as the young Amish boy is excellent and very believable.  You kind of knew that the kid would go on to bigger and better things if he stayed clean.  Danny Glover is solid as always as one of the rogue cops out to get Book and the boy.  Viggo Mortensen also gets his career up and running with a small role as an amish man named Moses and does an excellent job.  As do Patti Lupone, Josef Summer, Brent Jennings, and Jan Rubes.  Rubes in particular is amazing as Eli Lapp, (Samuel's grandfather and Rachel's father-in-law).  I think this man deserved a best-supporting nod, he was that great.

Finally, the story itself is truly terrific.  It's a film that both men and women of any age will enjoy.  It's part love story, part crime drama, part character study, and also part cultural study as well.  Yes, I know, I know, the Amish were pissed off about how they were portrayed in this film.  Yet, I can't figure out why.  To me, they were portrayed to be much more benevolent, kind-hearted, level-headed, and practical than we 'English'.  There were several buddies of mine that wanted to become Amish after seeing this film.  However, me thinks these converts-to-be were enticed more by the beauty of McGillis (especially one scene in particular) than they were by the hard-working, extremely moral, plain folk.  Go figure.

In a relatively weak decade when it came to classic films, I would without a doubt put this one on my top-ten best film list for the 1980's.  You can't go wrong with this one!",1185580800,,3744,4.486686390532545

242078,5,6300214567,"Harrison Ford shines in this lingering over the close-quarter differences between Pennsylvania's Amish people and the 'English' life that by contrast seems so rude in this 1985 screen gem. Yet twenty-two years later, it is the young Kelly McGillis who nearly melts the screen with this early performance as Rachel, the Amish widow who takes in Harrison's 'John Book' and grows into love with a fugitive from 'the city' whose own heart grows entwined with the Amish way.

Although the Amish did not like this film (it *is* a film), it remains as a deeply moving tribute to their chosen, peaceful way. Perhaps it is the finest thing we 'English'--this reviewer grew up in Pennsylvania with the Amish as his neighbors--can offer them.

Not that they were asking for recognition.

Director Peter Weir caught them doing what they do best, going about the business of keeping peace and making the earth grow its greenest things. The occasional caricature that creeps in clumsily elevates the men and women it seeks to honor rather than reducing them to its dimensional poverty.

The Amish are not heroes and do not play that role particularly well on the wide screen (the actors of are course not Amish men and women). They are rather people who have from within community made a stark choice and chosen to celebrate both its limitations and the world it opens up to them.

Weir, Ford, McGinnis et al. did well to freeze-frame that choice as one that saved the life of a self-sufficient Baltimore policemen who stumbled upon corruption that made him a marked man in the city. It is a most moving still.

The film was uncanny in its capacity, in the end, to mark the Amish off in the most authentic way: not by sneering at their simplicity of style and rejection of 'fashion'. Rather, as recent history has provided grim occasion for us to observe, the Amish are distinguished by the grace that they do not kill. And, when bloodied, they say the damndest thing: 'We forgive'.

Witness indeed. And a superb movie.",1180137600,6,2005,4.760806916426513

  I currently live in Indiana, so I am more familiar with the Amish community.  When the picture came out, though, I lived in Arizona, and did not have any knowledge of this culture when I saw the movie.

  This movie does have a clash of the violent world of the police officer, and the peaceful community of the Amish.  It is presented in a way that paints the picture that not everyone is meant to be Amish but that there are characteristics of this lifestyle one can learn from.

  I will say, though, there are scenes that may not reflect true Amish thinking.  This movie earned an R-rating not just for the violence (though that was enough), but for a nude scene, which may not have been realistic in the Amish lifestyle in this situation.  Also, a movie reviewer questioned the ending as well.

242083,4,6300214567,"It all starts off when a beautiful Amish widow takes her little son Samuel from their home in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania to visit her sister in Baltimore and try to get over her grief...

While passing through Philadelphia, and on entering alone a men's restroom in a train station, Samuel glances up to see two men advancing with unmistakable menace toward a young man... He caught sight of the face of one of the two attackers who killed him...

As the plot becomes more intricate, and through a series of interesting events, detective John Book finds himself forced to protect the shy eight-year-old boy and his helpless mother... He disappears for some days in the Amish Country...

Harrison Ford stars as a fugitive cop who is initially unwelcome in a community he knows a little about... He tries to learn the importance of family and community, the philosophy of brotherhood and non-resistance... He becomes involved in a case that will essentially change his human perceptions... And later, he finds himself falling in love with a sensitive young woman...

Kelly McGillis is captivating as Rachel, a woman who feels a shadow of confusion crossing her mind... She stares at the honest cop, realizing the price he's paid in returning them to safety...

In one scene she catches him watching her bath... She hesitates for a moment, but in that precise moment she makes a choice... Slowly she turns to face him, topless, without shame... For a moment she attempts a tender effort to become, for an instant, a woman of his world...

In another scene we see her playing the charade of her life... Bound by duty, but tempted by desire, she leaves her white cap - symbol of her identity - on the table, and surrenders to a passion, that makes her sensual nature say it all...

Lukas Haas is very fine as the cute kid in the black coat and hat... He slowly raises his hand to point at the black and white photograph... This nice boy remains untouched by the violence interposed into his peaceful world...

Jan Rubes is believable as Rachel's father-in-law Eli... He is torn by conflicts between faith, discipline, dedication and humility... He tries his best to protect what's left of his family from the pressures of the outside world... It's pretty clear he doesn't like this Englishman wearing the clothes of his faith... For him his daughter-in-law has brought fear to his house... and now she is dancing to English music!

Alexander Godunov brings a solid performance to the role of Daniel, Rachel's discarded suitor... It's no surprise that he wants the disappearance of the policeman... Book's tempting presence will only weak his chance with Rachel... In one remarkable scene and on a road running parallel to the train track, he urges his horse almost to the gallop as he attempts to keep pace with the train...

It is quite interesting to see Danny Glover as a crooked cop, who's corrupt and evil... But the heart of the movie is a study of the Pennsylvania Amish through the eyes of an outsider suddenly introduced into their life... Peter Weir tries to paint a realistic portrait of the Amish who are best known for their severely 'plain clothing' and their 'non-conformed' way of life... The Amish also avoid telephones and electric lights and drive horses and buggies rather than cars...

Weir delivers a powerful and romantic story, an engaging film of different style, mixing two different cultures, the simplicity of the Amish lifestyle with the urban culture and fashion... The music and cinematography work beautifully to impart all the emotions of the characters...

'Witness' (won Academy Awards for Best Film Editing and Original Screenplay. Nominations for Best Actor (Ford), Art Direction, Cinematography, Director, Score and Best Picture..) is quiet provoking.. thrilling and entertaining.. I highly recommend it..

Detective John Book (Harrison Ford) is assigned to the case. I think you know the rest. As Book pushes it appears to be Police corruption and as he pushes harder, the corruption appears to be higher up. Eventually he's shot. Danny Glover, before his ""Lethal"" days, is the bad cop.

Book goes in deep cover as an Amish man to both recover from his wounds and to protect the young boy, Samuel. And, obviously, he and Rachel begin to fall in love. More on that in a moment.

The insertion of a hard boiled urban warrior into the gentle Pennsylvania countryside is tough on both parties but Book is there to recover from wounds and protect the boy.

The repair of the car and the night time dancing to Sam Cooke was great. Tender, funny, and very well played by McGillis as the confused but happy woman and Ford, whom we are led to believe hasn't been happy for a long, long time.

The subsequent topless scene I felt was unnecessary and for me pandered to the audience. It was apparent that the two loved eachother; equally obvious was the fact that there was more than a racial or cultural or social divide, there was a philosophic difference of mammoth proportions. Nether could live in the other's life. So catching McGillis in the shower I thought was stupid. Nice, but almost cheap.

The film is fantastic on that level, especially thanks to Peter Weir's direction, who brilliantly shows Ford gradually becoming accepted by the Amish men.

There is very little dialogue among the characters, and Rachel (McGillis) talks even less, not because she doesn't have anything to say, but because Amish rules of life don't seem to allow her to. They are presented as a quiet people, so McGillis has the difficult task of making Rachel speak without dialogue, and she does it well, which carries over to Ford (he got an Oscar nomination, she didn't).

It's only at the climax of the film, when the action takes over that the film begins to weaken. The filmmakers seem to have some kind of answer to how the killer's storyline should be resolved, but it's not very good.",1142121600,,949,4.576470588235294

Bad guys who are more like brainless killing machines, good guys who never make mistakes, and stereotypical cultural behavior are all aspects of Hollywood film production these days.  However, movies like Witness have the ability to entertain as well as challenge the Hollywood stereotypes that were so prevelant in the 80's when this film was made.

This is the story of John Book, a Philadelphia police detective who is assigned to investigate a muder in a train station restroom.  The only witness is a young boy named Samuel.  Samuel is quite different from many children his age, as he is Amish.  However, this difference is portrayed with a sense of admiration and respect that serves a purpose.  When Samuel recognizes one of the killers as a police detective, Book attempts to report this to his superiors at the police department.  The attempt to go through proper channels backfires when Book is ambushed, wounded, and nearly killed in a parking garage.

With a bullet wound and concern for the safety of Samuel, his mother (Rachel) and himself, Book flees the city and seeks refuge in the Amish community where Samuel lives.  Gradually, Book is nursed back to health and begins the process of learning the Amish lifestyle.  What develops during the rest of the film is a down to earth look at what happens when two worlds mix together and the good/bad elements of both.  I won't give away all of the plot details, but I will say that there are several scenes that challenge Hollywood stereotypes.

Some people may criticize Kelly McGillis' portrayal of Rachel, saying that a real Amish woman would not act that way.  However, Amish folks are human beings who feel sexual desire, confusion, and pressure from the family and social surroundings just like we do. Rachel does seem to give in to her attraction for Book, but in the end her devotion to the Amish lifestyle prevails; the interaction with Book shows an inner struggle within herself to figure out what she really values in life.

During the movie, the Amish also learn more about Book and realize that he has value as a worker and as a person, and they cannot condemn him simply because he is from modern society.  There are a couple of weak points in this movie.  One of them is the performance by Danny Glover, who has very little screen time and does not get to use his talent as an actor very much.  Even though he is a bad guy in the film, I believe he could have shown some depth if given the opportunity.  The climax scene with the shootout seemed a bit heavy handed and poorly planned for the characters.  I mean if they had law enforcement training, weapons training, and were good at covering up corruption, they could have come up with a better attack plan than barging in and shooting up the farm in broad daylight.

The one redeeming quality is when the surviving attacker has a moment of remorse and humanity at the end.  This proves to be the only depth of character in the movie's villans.  Overall, this is an enjoyable film and has some nice scenery, which was filmed in Lancaster County, PA.  Four stars.",1139702400,,3215,4.689839572192513

The cinematography is not merely the work of a talented genius, but is also informed by a history of western art. Here, caught from time to time throughout the film are works of Rembrandt, Vermeer and others. Pay attention, for example, the view of the elders at the sick bed; how much does this scene owe to the Staalmeesters and the Anatomy School?

This is his best along with (arguably) his performance in Mosquito Coast, his other film with Weir. These guys need to get together again! I have nothing to say about the film that hasn't already been said here so I want to talk about the dvd itself. The documentary is interesting and well-done - I was particularly moved by McGillis' sudden outburst at the end - but I'm afraid that that and a few tv spots are just not enough. 1 deleted scene? Come on! Where are the outtakes? Some more interviews? I've got loads of interviews of Ford and McGillis plugging the film in 1985 that would make great dvd extras. How about them at the Cannes festival? And finally - this DVD TRANSFER IS PATHETIC! The color films in the John Wayne preview looked in better shape than this film which is not that old - so why is the source print in such bad condition? It's very grainy and no better than the previous dvd. What is it with Paramount and these big studios? Some, like Universal, don't even bother to put a menu on some of their movies! Just want to make money, of course.

William Kelly's fresh and powerful story, with it's multiple meaning title, combines a murder mystery and a doomed love story when a world of darkness and evil is dragged into an oasis of peace and love via a detective investigating a killing.

242208,4,6300214567,"After buying another DVD of ""Witness"" (a better transfer with a ""making of"" extra) and forwarding through endless DVD promos, it's a relief to watch Peter Weir tweak this cop thriller. He has injected fear and violence into plain and peaceful Amish farm life, putting a winsome boy (Lukas Haas) in peril and his widowed mother (Kelly McGillis) romantically at risk. Since Harrison Ford is the wounded cop, they aren't complaining. She nurses Ford back to health and he shields them from bad cops who want the boy dead; the kid saw one of them (Danny Glover) kill an undercover agent in a train station rest room.

Ford, stretching as an actor, is oddly vulnerable as a fish out of water. Haas, now a young man, remarks on his work and how Weir coaxed it out of him. In a bit of bravura casting, the late Russian ballet dancer Alexander Goudunov and Viggo Mortensen (in his film debut) register as rugged Amish brothers, and Patti LuPone, the Broadway musical star, plays Ford's sister. ""Witness"" rightly earned some Oscar nods and awards. It was Weir's first Hollywood box office breakthrough after some artistic successes in his native Australia. He has become a master of many genres, as ""Witness"" itself bears witness.",1125619200,,1221,4.814285714285714

The picture has white spots all over the place. THE MOVIE SHOULD LOOK BETTER THAN THIS-It's only 20 years old and they have restoration software now for this exact problem!

242210,4,6300214567,"A thriller set within the almost mythical world of the Amish? What more could you ask for. In maybe Ford's greatest role outside of IndianA Jones or Star Wars, he plays detective John Book who is investigating the death of a police office in a restroom of a Philadelphia train station. The only witness is young Amish boy named Samuel Lapp (lukas Haas) who was travelling with his mother Rachael (Kelly McGillis). Book is shocked when little Samuel identifies another detective as the man who committed the murder and who along with some other dirty cops is now out to eliminate the 'witness'.

When Book is wounded protecting Samuel and his mother, they return back to the Amish village to hideout and recover. The next portion of the film deals with Ford trying to fit into the strange new world of the Amish and learning their ways. Cultures clash often, particularly in regards to Rachael who has no husband and who has become attracted to Book, much to the horror of her father in law Eli (Jan Rubes). Eli is none to happy about this outsider being within their midst and influencing his daughter-in-law and grandson.

Book soon gains acceptance and in typical Amish fashion, helps them with a barn raising. In a memorable scene, several Amish travel into town in carriages only to be harassed by a group of young punks. When Book gets out to defend them he's told by Eli that ""It's not our way"" Book replies, ""No, but it's MY way!"" and proceeds to kick the tar out of the thugs. The bad cops eventually learn where Book is hiding out leading to a rather standard climactic shoot-out.

Alexander Gudonov co-stars as a suitor to Rachael who will only be too happy to see Book leave their community and Danny Glover rounds out the cast as one of the diry cops. Ford Received an Oscar nomination (his only one) for this role and deservedly so. I'm not a huge Ford fan but he shows a depth to his performance in this picture that is often missing from many of his one dimensional roles. The Amish community was very well depicted and made for an interesting change in setting for a movie of this type.

The Collectors edition includes one deleted scene and a 75 minute documetary which is nice, but it's too bad there was no commentary by Ford or the other stars.",1124841600,4,2264,4.555282555282555

To this day, whenever I see the theatrical version vs. the Cable-TV version vs. the Premium Cable version, I get slightly bent-out-of-shape, since the versions are slightly different, but I digress!  First and foremost, this film was an excellent crime/drama offering.  The clashing/melding of cultures proved very interesting and insightful.  The relationship between the newly widowed Ms. Lapp (McGillis) and Mr. Book (Ford)was at once simple and complicated, close, yet distant.  But when the oppurtunity presented itself, they were just a man and a woman that found something in one another.  They shared something that no one could take from them - a deep, true and abiding love.  I wish someone could write a sequel (a good one).  I'd pay money to see that!!  Five stars!!",1124668800,3,832,5.014598540145985
242213,5,6300214567,"Here is an interesting twist.  A crime drama that doesn't primarily focus on the crime.  The murder of a detective is what opens this film.  John Book ( why are all cops and detectives named John?) (Harrison Ford) is assigned to the case which takes him to Amish country to hide out from the killers.  Here's where the story really begins.  A modern 20th century cop amidst people who are living, somewhat, in the 19th century.  The film's focus is on the cultural, social and moral differences between the two worlds.  Harrison's character developes an attraction to the mother of the witness he's trying to protect.  Samuel (Lucas Haas) is a wide eyed innocent little boy that witnesses the murder.  His mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis) is none too pleased that her son is involved in the investigation and  wants nothing to do with that part of the ""outside"" world.

Let's face it, it's a Harrison Ford film so we already know that he's going to get the bad guys.  The excitement comes from how the killers track him down and what they try to do when they find him but more importantly, Ford's relationship with the mother, her father, son and the rest of the Amish community.  Sort of a fish out of the water story so to speak.

This film contains some lovely cinematography.  During the barn raising scene there is a shot of all the men climbing through the rafters of the barn which is set against the blue sky.  The contrast is wonderful.  The editing is a little less impressive.  In one scene where one of the bad guys holds Rachel hostage, John tries to convince her captor to let her go.  Both men have guns and the bad guy is telling John to put his gun down after John has already dropped the gun to the floor and said that the gun was down. (just one of those little things that make movies more interesting) ;)

Here's one interesting little factiod, watch for the scene in the beginning of the film where Harrison's character speaks to a janitor that he thinks is the witness.  The janitor is James Earl Jones father.  I'm not sure how that came about but it's cool.

You'll enjoy this film.",1124409600,3,2105,4.496042216358839
242214,5,6300214567,"Made immediately after ""The Year of Living Dangerously"", ""Witness"" continued a winning streak for Australian director Peter Weir. His first ""American"" movie, ""Witness"" deals with the conflict between two cultures and, in a sense, two centuries as part of a much more conventional police drama about an Amish boy (Lukas Haas) who witnesses the murder of an undercover police officer in the men's room of a train station. His mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis) is traveling with the boy and both are drawn into the police investigation. What Detective Captain John Book (Harrison Ford) who is investigating the case doesn't realize is that someone is out to kill them both. As a result, Book goes undercover himself taking them back to the Amish community they come from and hiding out with them there until he can resolve who is trying to kill them.

Featuring a rich, startling performance from Ford and a powerful turn by Kelly McGillis (who had only appeared on ""One Life to Live"", a TV movie and the marvelous film ""Rueben, Rueben"" at that point in her career) ""Witness"" still manages to amaze with the suspense that Weir generates in the film. His focus on the contrasting cultural values of Book and the Amish community makes the film much more than a conventional ""B"" movie police crime drama adding depth and nuance to the film.

A much needed improvement over the previous edition of ""Witness"", this collector's edition looks sharp with vivid colors, sharp image quality and very few digital artifacts. Blacks are rock solid throughout. The original release was a non-anamorphic widescreen image and, as such, this anamorphic presentation is a huge improvement over the previous edition of the movie. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround mix sounds solid throughout.

The original ""Witness"" was released bare bones so this new edition is a welcome change. There's a 5 part documentary ""Between Two Worlds"" which features new interviews with producer Edward S. Feldman, director Peter Weir, actors Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis. Feldman discusses how the original script was presented to many directors (including director David Cronenberg ""The Fly"") and many turned it down. Feldman and his wife happened to see Weir's ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" and he commented to his wife about how that was ""a movie"" and how perfect he would be to direct the film. McGillis discusses how lucky she was to work with Ford and Weir on one of her first major movies. Ford focuses on how difficult it can be to work with a Foreign director where English isn't their primary language so they can frequently lose the nuance of the performance. As Ford points out Weir had the advantage of their common language plus the added advantage of being an outsider culturally giving added perspective to the film. Weir's comments are, not surprisingly, the most valuable as he discusses the challenges of making a film in the United States vs. his home country. He also focuses on how he made substantial changes to the script shifting the point of view from Rachel (McGillis) to Book (Ford) since Book was the outsider in Amish country much like Weir was with the American crew and actors. His perceptive comments are always valuable it's a pity he's not a believer in doing film commentary tracks. He also points out that the sequence in the grain tower was improvised and created by he and Ford a couple of days before shooting as they wanted their ""High Noon"" like showdown to have something different and unique that might take advantage of the setting.

We get one deleted scene that was added to the network broadcast (it isn't integrated here into the feature either). Like ""The Truman Show"" it's clear why the deleted scene was cut although it wouldn't have damaged the pacing of the film all that much. Still, the point made in the deleted sequence where Book's nephews show the Amish boy his first video game is charming; thematically it's echoed by other far superior sequences throughout the film. There are also the original TV spots and theatrical teaser and trailer for the movie.

""Witness"" was a pivotal film for director Weir as it cemented his reputation as a major film director. It also set the stage for his collaboration with Ford on the underrated ""The Mosquito Coast"" as well as Weir's work with producer Edward Feldman on ""The Truman Show"" another pivotal film in Weir's career. Although he didn't wriwrite ""Witness"", Weir brought his experience as a writer/director to the film and kept the original writers on board to retool the script to fit his unique vision. Typically, the film was honored with an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay but Weir was passed over as director (as he continues to be much like Hitchcock and Welles two other giants of the cinema to which Weir can be compared for his unique personal vision). Paramount has done a great job here improving the transfer as well adding much needed extras to this classic contemporary film. Although 20 years old, ""Witness"" holds up extremely well today (Weir comments that he thought that it was the one film would be least likely to continue to hold up well and has been pleasantly surprised). Definitely worth an upgrade for fans of this terrific movie!",1123977600,127,5232,4.900677200902934

242259,5,6300214567,"This film leaves a tremendous impact on the viewer ... there is a creative story line, complex plot and deep characters. Often  a look and silence conveys more meaning than words ever could ... The camera is used to maximum effect to capture emotions that are too difficult to state in words. The enormous impact of the discovery made by John Book (Harrison Ford), the Philadephia detective who investigates a murder that occured in a public bathroom ... leads him to become a fugitive from the very law enforcement officers with whom he served. He escapes to Pennsylvania Amish country where the primary witness, a young Amish boy and his mother live. By traveling with Samuel (Lukas Haas) and his mother, Rachel Lapp (Kelly McGillis) ... John Book can protect both himself and Samuel until he can plan his next move to fight for justice ...

What leads him to forsake his primary investigation was a discovery that one of the narcotics officers, Lt. James McFee (Danny Glover) is ""unclean"". He made a pact with the devil, sold confiscated drugs on the side from evidence that was never reported ... earned millions of dollars illegally. Not long after John Book reports his suspicions to his superior along with the location of the primary witness to the crime - he learns his superior is on the take and one of the ""bad guys"". This begins his life as a fugitive ... now he is a marked man.

There are numerous outstanding scenes, cinematography and lines within the film. Some of them are ... in the police station when Samuel is reviewing mug shots to identify the murderer, he makes eye contact with a female police detective. While John Book receives a phone call, Samuel wanders around the office to explore his environment ... the female officer offers him a cookie, he declines politely. He walks to a glass enclosed case of trophies and awards ... his face registers recognition which John Book notices. John walks to the glass case as Samuel silently points to the face of Lt. James McFee, Narcotics Investigative ""award-winning"" Officer. Another highly moving scene is when Samuel opens a drawer, discovers John Book's loaded gun and holds it ... John finds him, takes the bullets out and explains how dangerous holding a loaded gun is, it can kill. Eli comes in and leads Samuel out of the room ... Eli sits Samuel on his knee and explains, how guns kill people and the Amish believe only G-d can take a human life. Eli asks Samuel what he thinks  to which Samuel sagely replies, ""the gun also kills bad people"", which flies against the teaching he just received ... At times the camera falls in love with Rachel Lapp (Kelly McGillis) whose huge eyes and beauty are enhanced by the stark simplicity of the dark clothing and white lace cap. In another winning moment, John Book is dressed in the plain clothes of his Amish hosts and rides into town with Eli in a horse and buggy. Several teenagers goad and poke fun at an Amish young man. They mock him by touching an ice cream cone to his forehead, both cheeks, and chin. John can not hold himself back ... despite Eli's warning, ""don't John, it is not our way."" John warns the punk, to stop, who replies, ""why what are you going to do?"" John punches him with full force in the stomach and face ... causing bruises and a bloody nose. A elderly non-Amish bystander shakes his head in disbelief but instead of understanding and supporting John's position, he states, ""this will not be good for tourism"". He reports the incident to a policeman which begins the final phase of the film where the Philadephia crooked police learn of John's exact location and they hunt him down ... The Amish young man who was mocked, sheepishly replies to the surrounding crowd, ""He is my cousin from Ohio, they are different from us."" After a house is built by the community, John Book participates demonstrating his carpentry skills, as the men and women of the Amish community exchange expressive looks and voice their suspicions amongst themselves about his relationship with Rachel. Eli (Rachel's father) suggests she may be ""banned"" by the community for her suspicious behavior. In yet another moving scene, John is in the backyard sitting on a bench ... he stares in the window ... to discover Rachel is undressing and about to take a bath. He does not move ... the camera captures Rachel's bare shoulder, her toes, foot, and length of her thigh ... John walks up to the window and states something to the effect, if I were to make love to you tonight, they would never forgive us. He leaves ... Another effective scene was in the kitchen when Rachel sees Samuel playing with a complex wooden toy made of pulleys, slides, and gears ... it was built by John Book for Samuel.

Overall, this film has a deep story which is enhanced by the contrast of two opposite cultures. It has superb use of cinematography, the highest caliber of actors and actresses who play their roles to perfection, and creative twists in the plot which are expanded by silence at the most extraordinairy times in the film ... creating enormously powerful scenes via artistic use of cinematography. This is a most highly satisfying viewing experience.

242260,5,6300214567,"""Witness"" is a unique movie in many ways.  It is an action-adventure, and yet it is not.  It is a semi-documentary, and yet it is not.  It is a murder-mystery, and yet it is not.  I struggled with what to call this movie, and found it impossible to classify it because it has so many features.  One of the best features is the excellent and reasonably accurate portrayal of the Amish.

Samuel Lapp (Lukas Haas, who in 1988 would have another important role in ""Lady in White"") and his widowed mother Rachel Lapp (Kelly McGillis) are traveling by train to visit her sister in Baltimore.  While waiting for a delayed train, Samuel witnesses the murder of a police officer in the train station rest room, though we do not learn until later that the murdered man was a police officer.

The officer assigned to the murder is Detective John Book, in one of his best roles.  Book takes Samuel and Rachel to the police station to see if Samuel can identify the murderer in one of the mug shot books.  What Samuel identifies instead is a picture of a highly decorated police officer, Detective Lieutenant James McFee (Danny Glover).  Book is immediately afraid because he has no idea who else in the police department might be corrupted.  At first he takes Samuel to his sister's house.  However, when Book realizes that Chief Paul Schaeffer (Josef Sommer) is part of a conspiracy with McFee, he immediately takes Samuel and Rachel back to Eli Lapp's (Jan Rubes) farm, but not before being shot in an encounter with McFee.

Once Book is on Lapp's farm the movie takes on a completely different character.  Book soon realizes that the Amish are very different from the English, as the Amish call outsiders, in very fundamental ways.  In a bit of irony and perhaps inside humor, Book also demonstrates a substantial woodworking skill.  Harrison Ford was once a carpenter before hitting it big in the movies.

Eventually Schaeffer, McFee, and Detective Fergie (Angus MacInnes) trace Book to Lapp's farm, and the stage is set for a show down.  This portion of the movie is relatively short, but intense.  Part of what the director did was to contrast the relatively staid life of the Amish with the action that takes place between these four men, which heightens that action.

This story has much depth.  There is chemistry between Book and Rachel, and at one point Rachel subtly offers herself to Book.  However, Book realizes, perhaps more than Rachel, that he is not Amish, and probably never could be.  The contrast between Book and the Amish is provided in several scenes on Lapp's farm, including one with a gun and one where Book refuses to accept the treatment of the Amish by a local punk.

I thought the end of this movie was powerful, which I will reveal but minimally.  Book's departure from the Lapp farm heralds the separation of the Amish world and the English world once more, with a return to what each culture knew so well.  We want the ending to be different, but it can not be.

Another notable aspect of this movie is the music.  The music in the city is dramatic, and yet eerie when there are moments of realization.  The music on the Lapp farm is generally pastoral and fitting for the relatively simple life the Amish lead.  The more dramatic music during the final battle becomes even more dramatic in contrast to the music that exemplifies the Lapp farm.  The music is very important to the affect the director was trying to achieve.

This movie is excellent.  I would usually classify this type of movie as a character study, but in this case it is more the study of the contrast between the Amish and the world around them.  The Amish are depicted accurately, as I can generally attest by having done business with them regularly here in central Illinois.  They are a devout people who maintain their convictions even though they are faced daily with a life that for some must be highly intriguing.  The director and the actors used this contrast to move viewers, and it worked.",1112486400,4,3993,4.660944206008583
242261,5,6300214567,"A thriller set within the almost mythical world of the Amish?  What more could you ask for.  In maybe Ford's greatest role outside of Indian Jones or Star Wars, he plays detective John Book who is investigating the death of a police office in a restroom of a Philadelphia train station.  The only witness is young Amish boy named Samuel Lapp (lukas Haas) who was travelling with his mother Rachael (Kelly McGillis).  Book is shocked when little Samuel identifies another detective as the man who committed the murder and who along with some other dirty cops is now out to eliminate the 'witness'.

When Book is wounded protecting Samuel and his mother, they return back to the Amish village to hideout and recover.  The next portion of the film deals with Ford trying to fit into the strange new world of the Amish and learning their ways.  Cultures clash often, particularly in regards to Rachael who has no husband and who has become attracted to Book, much to the horror of her father in law Eli (Jan Rubes).  Eli is none to happy about this outsider being within their midst and influencing his daughter-in-law and grandson.

Book soon gains acceptance and in typical Amish fashion, helps them with a barn raising.  In a memorable scene, several Amish travel into town in carriages only to be harassed by a group of young punks.  When Book gets out to defend them he's told by Eli that ""It's not our way""  Book replies, ""No, but it's MY way!"" and proceeds to kick the tar out of the thugs.  The bad cops eventually learn where Book is hiding out leading to a rather standard climactic shoot-out.

Alexander Gudonov co-stars as a suitor to Rachael who will only be too happy to see Book leave their community and Danny Glover rounds out the cast as one of the diry cops.  Ford Received an Oscar nomination (his only one) for this role and deservedly so.  I'm not a huge Ford fan but he shows a depth to his performance in this picture that is often missing from many of his one dimensional roles.  The Amish community was very well depicted and made for an interesting change in setting for a movie of this type.  Highly recommended.",1112227200,3,2136,4.576315789473684
242262,5,6300214567,"This is a terrific film. Peter Weir is one of the most talented directors out there. In Witness, he crafted a well acted, fast moving thriller. The actors all do a fine job and you get a real insight into amish life. The best scene in the film is when local teenagers are teasing the amish and Ford jumps off the carridge and flies off the handle. He can't take it, yet the amish people have to deal with that every day. This is a great film, I recommend it to anyone.",1110240000,,468,4.0978260869565215
242263,5,6300214567,"Witness is a movie that makes you glad you witnessed it. The plot quickly unfolds, within the first 15 minutes, preparing the viewer for what seems to be an intricate thriller of murder and drugs perpetrauted by none other than the men assigned to prevent it, the police. The witness is an unlikely candidate, an amish boy, accompanied by his beautiful widow mother, who lost her husband in the preceding scene, visiting the city for the first time. The events were foreshadowed earlier when he was told he ""would see many things in the city"". The man assigned to the case and the boys guardian is a hard-nosed cynic, who is good at ""whacking"" people. A most unlikely character, played stupendously by Harrison Ford, for whom an amish woman would fall for. At this point the story is all laid out for the viewer, what typically should follow is an edgy, over-the-top duel between good and evil, but herein lies the twist. Ford gets shot 10 minutes after ascertaining the identity of the culprit and is carried into the conservative, gas lanterned, cow milking at sun-up realm of the amish. The metropolitan cop is torn from the corrupt sands of the city and placed into the serene, picturesque wheat fields of the country. The unthinkable romance between an outsider and a widow takes over, in a manner that is subtle and fully perceptive of value and consequence. Ford is taken out of context and lo and behold fits perfectly the puzzle of love and chores. The romance is dominant, lucid and obscure, feared yet uncontrollabe. A love that melts together issues of tradition, righteousness and a desire, understood only by two people. But wait, there remains a murder and 22 million dollars worth of PCP. A linking witness who must perish, a price paid by Ford's partner who wouldn't divulge his whereabouts. The melting pot overflows as both love and death are confronted and resolved in the brilliant final segments of the film. The cinamotography is like eye candy, offering sublime scenery and close-ups revealing every gesture, every angle of facial implication, most befitting of Kelly McGillis' lovely face, which says so much without saying anything at all. The denoument is as expected, except for those sentimentalists who just can't let it be so, with Ford returning to his world and McGillis remaining in hers, but that spirit of poignant love never leaves eithers face, remaining as a remnant of a love that just couldn't be.",1109894400,,2438,4.862980769230769
242264,5,6300214567,"I was but an innocent Amish teen when this was filmed in my native Lancaster County, PA USA. It was shot just a few miles from my home. My friend Jebediah was even an extra in it.

I was busy helping Father build a new buggy and was unable to watch the actual filming. However, when it was released to theaters, me and my friend Jebediah (a different Jebediah than the one I already mentioned) went into town to see the movie.

I was awestruck when I saw it. The story was truly wonderful. Harrison Ford should have worn a beard, but other than that he was great in this role. Also, what can I say about Kelly McGillis? She stirred up amazing feelings within me. The only time I'd felt like that before was the time I caught a quick glimpse of my neighbor Hildegarde's bare ankle during a barn-raising.

Due to a nasty altercation with my friend Jebediah (a different Jebediah than the other two I mentioned) I am no longer Amish. However, this film will always be special to me.

Hollywood needs to make more classy films like this.",1104537600,7,1033,4.364583333333333
242324,4,6300214567,"If you enjoyed ""High Noon"", the western with Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly, then the chances are good that you'll enjoy ""Witness"".  The story line is pretty similar; a law man has three bad guys coming for him and a girl friend who can't stand up for him because of her religious convictions against any form of violence.  In the case of ""Witness"" the law man is a Philidelphia detective (Harrison Ford) and the bad guys are some dirty cops.  A young Amish boy on a rare trip to the city witnesses a murder but is unable to communicate and so he cannot identify the murderer.  However, the fact that the murderer is a cop means that he knows that the Amish boy knows.  The scene necessarily switches to a Pennsylvania Amish community where a wounded Harrison Ford goes to hide and recover.  Being cut off from the outside world provides a cover for all until one day Ford, posing as an Amish man, creates a scene that exposes himself.  And what a scene it is.  It may be the highlight of the movie when Ford decides to show some local rowdies that not everyone with a wide brim hat turns the other cheek.  I won't say more about the plot because I don't want to spoil any of the very real suspense that the movies creates.

There is a love interest in this movie that is somewhat ackward and somewhat believable.  It challenges some of our stereotypes but in a way that makes us all understand that love cries out beyond boundaries.  The protrayal of the Amish seems to be very well done although I don't pass myself off as an expert on the subject.  The clash of cultures in this movies is also handled well.  The director lets us hope but he reminds us that love can sometimes be challenged in the conquering department.

""Witness"" is a quality movie.  It's not in the category of ""High Noon"" which had superior writing, directing and acting.  However, I would rate it a ""4.5"" if that were a choice.  Watch it and ask yourself how would you have handled the end to this movie?",1102982400,2,1976,4.396694214876033
242325,4,6300214567,"'Witness' is probably Harrison Ford's best film, and when it was released it showed him another facet of a gifted actor who until then had been known only to most moviegoers only as Han Solo and Indiana Jones. In 'Witness', Ford is police detective John Book, called to interrogate a terrified little Amish boy named Samuel Lapp, and his young widowed mother. An undercover cop has been killed in the men's room at the railroad station, and Samuel, hiding in a stall, is the only eyewitness. Samuel is unable to identify the perp from the usual log of suspects; but there he is, posted prominently on the precinct bulletin board -- a decorated narcotics agent. When Book relates his findings to the police captain, he ends up getting shot himself -- seems the captain is in on it as well. With the captain, the narcotics agent, and a third dirty cop gunning for him, Book needs a place to hide, and what better place than the Lapp house deep in Amish country?

  The contrast between the gritty urban police precinct and the bucolic Amish farm country is one of the best things about the film. Book dressed in a blue shirt and black trousers several inches too short for him, looking like the proverbial fish out of the water, is a sight to behold. All of a sudden he's back in the nineteenth century -- no electricity, no cars, no TV or computers. He might as well be on another planet. And the Amish are as different from him as space aliens; gentle, quiet pacifists, hardworking and industrious, intent on keeping the outside world as far from them as possible. They are neighborly and cooperative; the barn-raising scene is inspiring to watch. We feel sympathy for these quiet, decent people as the outside world keeps encroaching, and see them trying to navigate a horse and buggy on the Interstate. Book has to try to fit into this world, and he gives it his best shot. He joins in the barn-raising, does odd chores around the farm. But the Amish, while they respect his abilities, hold him at arm's length. For one thing, he's falling in love with the young widow Lapp, whose feeling for him is mutual. For another, his assimilation is only skin-deep; on a trip into town, when a group of local louts start pestering the Amish, Book chips in with a right to the lout's nose that leaves his face a bloody mess. It's going to prove his undoing; back in his precinct, the narcotics agent and the captain have gotten wind of his hideout, and now they come to shut him up once and for all, and silence Samuel as well.

  In contrast to his one-note performances in the 'Star Wars' films and as Indiana Jones, Ford gives a much more nuanced performance in this film; he's the tough city cop on the one hand and the refugee who doesn't fit on on the other. Lukas Haas is very effective as the young boy Samuel, all big eyes and ears; and Kelly McGillis is excellent as his mother, torn between her feelings for Book and her ties to her Amish community; faced with the threat of being shunned for the rest of her life and cut off from everyone she knows if she marries him. There are several notable supporting performances as well, especially the late Alexander Godunov as the widow Lapp's admirer whose innate civility prevents him from expressing the resentment he feels at Books presence, and Danny Glover as the murderous narcotics detective. Peter Weir's sensitive direction plays up the contrast between time and place, sustaining the tension throughout the film. 'Witness' is not an action/adventure blockbuster like the movies that made Ford a household name, but it doesn't need pyrotechnics to stand out. It's a well-crafted, well-acted, eminently satisfying movie.",1090713600,59,3675,4.672333848531685
242326,5,6300214567,"Some of the most powerful romances can spring up when both sides have to be restrained; here, the widowed Amish woman and the cop-in-hiding know that they come from different worlds, know that a relationship between them will not practically work, and so fill the screen with unresolved sexual and romantic tension.
Woven into the more grisly details of murder and police corruption are scenes of humor and beauty.  Dancing in the barn to ""Don't Know Much About History"".  Having to wake up at 4 a.m. to milk the cows.  It's funny to see how the cop, John Book, tries to fit himself into Amish life the best he can.  And it's very moving to see his growing love for the Amish woman who nursed him through a bad gunshot wound and has enchanted him with her character and beauty.  The movie's climax is also riveting; it's not often that one sees gunfighting at an Amish farm.",1090022400,3,874,4.54140127388535
242327,3,6300214567,"As I write my title, it is weird to think this film is nearly 20 years old! How time flies! Anyway...I first saw this film when it first came out and I  remember I really really liked it. I was 23 years old and not a Christian at that time. Now, I am soon to be 42 and have been a Christian for over 18 years. For 10 years of my life, I lived as a Mennonite (like Amish in many ways, but we drove cars, had electricity, etc.) I am no longer a Mennonite, and now I watch films again. I appreciate classic cinema very much, but recently have wanted to watch Witness again, to see if I would like it as much as the first time, and to see if I thought they portrayed the Amish correctly.
So, I watched it last night. It was interesting in that I remembered so much, even some small details about it. So it really did impress me that first time when I was young. This time, I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't say it is a film I would watch over and over again, as I watch some classic films. To see it once more was enough to just satisfy my curiosity about my memories of it.
I did feel they portrayed the Amish quite well, with the clothes and such. What they did wrong about the portrayal was that in no way would it be allowed for an Amish woman to tend to a wounded man who wasn't her husband, by herself in a room alone with him. It just isn't proper, isn't done. In reality, a man would have done that, or an older woman would have done it, with another woman there. I think the movie allowed the Rachel character to have way more ""access"" to a man alone than would be allowed in a real Amish or Mennonite community. I doubt he would have really been allowed to stay in the house. In reality he would have been placed in a home with a family who had a bunch of boys and he would work with them and the father, and not have all that time alone with Rachel.
I don't like violence...I knew that the bad part happened in the train station in the beginning, so we were able to fast forward that part. Also, we were able to fast forward the ending ""shoot out"" stuff. I didn't care for the bad language. The scene with Rachel taking her sponge bath, well when I was young and not a Christian, I found that very romantic. Now, I found it rather silly. A devout Amish girl/woman would not have just calmly turned around and let a man stare at her while unclothed. And later on, when she and he finally ""meet"" for the romantic moment, I found that sort of offensive. Why kiss out in the yard where anyone could see you? Eli could have easily looked out the window (a real Amish father would have kept better tabs on his daughter with a strange man around the place). I felt that scene was very much just an animal passion thing...sort of vulgar. Not at all romantic, truly loving or gentle. It seems people sure knew how to kiss and show romantic love a lot better in the old movies! And right before she went out there, she took her prayer veiling off. Which again, no Amish woman would do. But then she obviously was rebelling. There was that other time too, when she and John Book were in the barn listening to his radio, and she had it off then, and I am not sure why, for no Amish or Mennonite woman will go without it in front of people or outside the house.
The ending left me wondering...would Rachel just go ahead and marry Daniel? Would she really be happy with him? She really would have to repent of her sins with John Book to be truly happy. I also noticed that the film never showed a church service. Also, none of the Amish folks never seemed to care to tell John Book how to be a Christian. But then there are many Amish who are not born- again Christians, but just are ""culturally Amish""...they live the way they do because they have always done so. These must have been that type of Amish. It did seem that Grandfather knew the Bible...he quoted some good verses when talking to the boy about the gun. That was good to see, yet sad that such violence had to even be witnessed by this child.
Oh, of course any film with Amish must have a barn raising scene, and this one did. Also, so many movies with cows mus have the scene where the city person doesn't know how to milk a cow. Of course John Book must learn. He makes a joke about ""teats"" in this scene, and grandfather Eli laughs at it, which again, I doubt a devout Amish man would do.
Well, these are my thoughts. It was interesting to revisit this film again. In closing, I would say it is an okay film for adults but I would not recommend it for children.",1083456000,16,4516,4.137656427758817
242328,4,6300214567,"The movie Witness starring Harrison Ford features one of his best performances.  He received his only Oscar nomination for this film in 1985.  This definitely goes to show what kind of performance you are in for.  This is an extraordinary story; it is a combination of a thriller and a love story.
The movie is about a young Amish boy (Lukas Haas) who witnesses a murder in the men's room of a train station while traveling with his mother, Rachel (Kelly McGillis).  When the young boy identifies the murderer as a fellow detective, the detective John Books (Harrison Ford) who is assigned to the case must protect them.  John gets shot but realizes he must save the young boy and his beautiful widowed mother.  He knows they must go into hiding so he drives them to their farm in the Amish community before he collapses.  While learning the ways of the Amish lifestyle, a romance begins between John and Rachel.  During several twist and turns the action and suspense continues.  The chemistry between Ford and McGillis is remarkable and realistic.  This thriller, love story is very touching and definitely one you don't want to miss.",1082937600,,1136,4.779487179487179
242329,5,6300214567,"If the Star Wars and Indiana Jones trilogies proved Harrison Ford could play cliffhanger-serial style action heroes without breaking a sweat, his performance in 1986's Witness as a Philadelphia detective hiding in an Amish community after discovering some of his fellow cops are on the other side of the law proved that he could play more down-to-Earth, believable and even vulnerable leading man roles.
Ford plays John Book, a dedicated if rather world-weary detective captain in the Philadelphia police department who is called in to investigate the brutal slaying of an undercover officer in a public restroom at the train station.  His only witness: eight-year-old Samuel Lapp (Lukas Haas), an Amish boy who's traveling with his beautiful (and recently widowed) mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis).
At first, Book and Rachel clash when he insists that Samuel's testimony is badly needed to identify the cop killers, but when the investigation leads to the corrupt Lt. James McFee (Danny Glover) and others in the police force, the young and terrified Amish woman must become Book's protector when he is wounded in a parking lot shootout with McFee and some of his accomplices.  Making their way to Lancaster County in Book's car, Rachel, Samuel and the wounded detective find temporary refuge in the rural and definitely back-to-basics Amish community in the Pennsylvania countryside.
Australian director Peter Weir, working from a well-written screenplay by William Kelley and Earl W. Wallace, combines the fish-out-of-water theme of a modern American cop hiding out in a community that shuns his modern, ""English"" ways with a beautiful love story and a taut mystery thriller.  Weir (Gallipoli, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World) balances all these masterfully, never letting one part of the story overwhelm the other.
Ford had tackled the action/romance hybrid genre before, in 1979's forgettable Hanover Street, but his performance in Witness is absolutely wonderful. He is still in an action-hero role of sorts here, but in a more believable setting and definitely more vulnerable than either Han Solo or Indiana Jones.  He's earthy and sometimes profane, yet there is a loneliness and tenderness that comes to the fore when he falls for Rachel...and realizes that his life and hers are universes apart even though they live only a few counties apart.
Witness also has a great supporting cast, including Patti Lupone, Josef Sommer, the late Alexander Godunov, Viggo Mortensen (Lord of the Rings), and Beverly May.
Also worth mentioning is Maurice Jarre's (The Longest Day) simple yet evocative score that reflects the gentle reverence and simplicity of the Amish community, and underscores the budding love between the tough but wounded detective and the beautiful and lonely widow.",1075507200,8,2799,5.297297297297297
242330,4,6300214567,"I love this movie, am deeply moved each time I see it.  You can see the plot from other reviews, so I won't review it here.  I've often wondered whatever happened to Lukas Haas' career - he was outstanding.  This movie is a refreshing change for Harrison Ford, who previously was known only for Star Wars and Indiana Jones.  He shows new depths and range in his acting abilities.
My main gripe is that mentioned by others - the ""out of character"" scene where Kelly McGillis lets Ford gaze at her while bathing.  No Amish woman would ever do that.  That was simply a cheap way to sneak in some modern nudity, into a culture where it would not be tolerated.  Other than that, it's a nearly perfect movie, suspenseful, funny, romantic and interesting.
Has anyone noticed that Viggo Mortensen is in this?  Look for him in the barn-raising scene.

When Ford realizes that it's an inside job involving other officers right up to the Chief of Police, his own life is in danger and he, too goes into hiding - within the Amish community. Then the movie becomes a cat and mouse game, juxtaposing the metropolitan police corruption with the purity of the Amish way of life.

242413,3,6300214567,"Witness is critically acclaimed and everyone likes it, but probably me.  There's something lacking in this film that keeps it from my honor list (four stars or above).  As usual, the acting is fine when Ford is included, but the story line bothers me a bit and I think I know what's missing.
John Book is Ford's character and he takes up a case which includes an Amish boy and his sister, big sis, and the uncovering of crooked cops in his own precinct.  The Amish boy witnesses a murder and Book finds out its a cop behind it, but as he investigates he gets shot and he escapes with the boy and his sis to Amish territory where he seeks assylum.
This movie has some really good points, so let me point them out first.
1. Harrison Ford is outstanding, why he didn't win best actor for this the world will never know, but he did a great job with a city cop who has to change and learn of a new culture far from his own.
2. This film put the Amish and their culture for America to learn about.  I admire their culture and beliefs and their moral duties, which you learn a great deal about.  Again, I am all for movies that teach you things as well as entertain you at the same time.  This film does that, sort of.
3. The plot is original, for its time, although many spins have made off it, films that now make fun or attempt to include the Amish in it have come about as a result to this film's success.
Here's the problem with it.  The film was intended to be a romance/thriller/drama and it failed.  The thrillingness of it is very good, it is successful at keep us glued seeing if the bad cops will find Ford stashed with the Amish.  But the romance and drama are pitiful and unrealistic.
Ford's character, although believable, is kind of lost.  He finds himself at the care of these Amish folks and yet he doesn't know what to do.  He can't return to the city cops, so he just sits there and bides his time.  I never could figure this out.  Why doesn't he go to a different city?  Seek out of state jurisdiction?  Instead he just remains, willingly, among the Amish learning their customs as he checks in with his partner to see how things are.  But this is so stupid and unbelievable.  Damn, if I was him I'd be on the move.  Who cares if your car doesn't work, walk or borrow a carriage of theirs.  Sheesh!
OK, the romance is dumb.  I don't think it works and the reason why I think it doesn't works is because Kelly McGillis' character has to step out of character for it to even happen, which is a total no no.  There is this one scene that makes me puke, it is when McGillis is bathing and she doesn't mind that Book is watching her in the nude.  She even turns to stare at him, showing all like ""Come and get me, big boy.""
This is not a born and bred Amish gal, this is stupid Hollywood being perverted.  It's this incident that takes her out of character for good and it ruins the movie, making viewers uncomfortable like me.  A real Amish girl would never do such a thing.  I almost wonder if the director knew this but did it anyway to make a statement or demonstrate that ""physical pleasure is more important than one's Faith.""  It wouldn't surprise me.
This film would've been better if McGillis's character hadn't turned into a sex symbol, but been a woman who loved her Faith more than her own lust.  That would've been character development and more realistic.  I guess I'm so sick of these lady roles being these easy, bare all sex symbols that have no personality or originality in their character.
The end is also unbelievable.  Three bad cops show up to find Book and kill him, so they go right into the heart of the Amish community and start shooting up the place.  This reminded me of a cheesy western that Clint Eastwood would sport.  Give me a break.
This film has some reality in it, but a whole lot of typical hollywood as well.  I'm sorry, but the out of step character of McGillis and the ending was just unsatisfactory to give this movie more than three stars.",1060819200,9,3990,4.285714285714286
242414,5,6300214567,"Most Harrison Ford movies have a considerable number of things in common. Ford's character is usually street-smart (or something similar), there's always action, and more often than not he and his romantic interest are hesitant to admit their feelings for each other. While Peter Weir's `Witness' fits the mold technically, somehow this movie feels very different from anything else Ford has ever done  (Including the little known, `Mosquito Coast').
 Ford stars as a stubborn Philadelphia cop named John Book, who is in charge of the investigation when an undercover police officer is murdered in a public restroom. Ford identifies one of the murderers with the help of a wide-eyed Amish boy named Samuel (played by the adorable Lukas Haas). However, as soon as he has disclosed this information to a superior who he trusts, the murderer is after him and Samuel.  Kelly McGillis plays the female lead, Rachel - Samuel's mother, and Danny Glover and Patti LuPone (the stage actress who originated the role of Fantine in Les Misrables) also star.
  `Witness' is undoubtedly a good movie, and Ford makes his part seem incredibly human, to the point that you start to forget he's acting and begin to wonder why he almost won an Oscar for such a simple role. `Witness' possesses none of the glitz and glamour of Ford's other blockbusters; however, it is still one of the standout movies of its decade and a completely recommendable film.",1059004800,2,1433,4.97907949790795
242415,3,6300214567,"Time will tell if Ford, known as heroic Han Solo and Indy Jones will return to his heroic status.  It is hard for me to realize that when push came to shove and Ford was asked to support the pro-Sadam leftist in hollywood or our troups he blinked.  He has been known for his financial support for Clinton, and thats fine.  That is the way hollywood is.  But support for proping up sadam?... and then he had his publicist try to explain away his apparent anti-american pro-french quotes...
Anyway, my point is that Harrison Ford is arguably out best actor today.  He plays the hero roles and the human interest roles very well.  If the public stops accepting him as a hero, due to his politics then his excellent work in movies like WITNESS will come to dominate.  I liked this movie, but it is not currently my favorite Ford movie.  Maybe that will change over time.",1057190400,,866,4.471337579617835

It features yet another great child performance: Lukas Haas as the witness Samuel Lapp. It seems that child performances just keep getting better and better with each film I see, and Haas is no expection. My favorite scenes are the ones between Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis. Their romance is truly believable and real. The thriller aspects of the film are merely secondary to the love story with Ford and McGillis.",1056672000,,569,5.129032258064516

242418,5,6300214567,"By the time Harrison Ford made WITNESS, he was midway through a career that most often emphasized dashing derring-do.  As police officer John Book, Ford gets the chance to combine his frequent persona of heroism with the less obvious trait of intense inner turmoil.  Ford slips into his role as detective Book with consummate ease as he interviews a smart Amish boy (Lukas Haas) who has just witnessed a murder.  Book is all police professionalism, until he meets the boy's gorgeous widowed mother, Rachel, played by Kelly McGillis in her first featured role.  The focus of interest is on the seemingly insurmountable gap that exists between Book's world of urban technology and Rachel's world of horse-drawn carriages.  The plot outside of their romance is paper-thin.  The boy has witnessed a rogue cop murder another officer in an act of witnessing that brings out a wide scale eruption of top level police corruption.  Yet the palpable chemistry of Ford and McGillis is so potent that the viewer scarcely notices the holes in logic that would stand out if only that viewer were not so immersed in the rarest of all movie themes: the clashing of cultures that brings out the best of both.  Director Peter Weir is careful not to show the Amish as country bumpkins.  Rather he shows a people that despite some inevitable clannishness are truly noble and brave.  Some of the most effective and moving scenes that I have ever watched on the big screen are here enormously memorable precisely because they underplay the tension of a moment that seems insignificant to gawky tourists but reveal to the audience that when an Amish man suffers the indignity of passive resistance against some redneck city boors, it is he, rather than the more daring John Book, who shows courage and forebearance.  Yet, part of the movie's charm is that no one character labels his world or actions as any better than the other's.  What emerges after the required shoot-em-up ending is a subtext that suggests that witnessing the way of a world that is not one's own does not mean that one must succeed in crossing the chasm to reach the other side in safety.  John Book finds out that it is often enough to reach out his hand to another to find out that both worlds are less different than at first glance.",1047081600,2,2286,4.756962025316455
242419,5,6300214567,"This is a great movie.  It is sensitive, moving, and hard-hitting, all in one flick.  What's not to like?
Police officer John Book (Harrison Ford) finds himself in the midst of a cop-killing.  He learns that the perps are within the Philly PD, which has an inside, corrupt bunch mixed up with the drug trade.  A young Amish boy is the witness, and the key to proving all of this.  This is easier said than done, because the bad guys are after Book/Ford, who is reluctantly taken in by the Amish.  The movie proceeds at Mach One from this point on.  The rest would be telling.
This movie is about the collision between two worlds: the 19th Century Amish, and a thoroughly 20th Century police officer trying to do the right thing.  The culture clash is moving, beautifully done, and mostly avoids the cliche' of being judgmental.  Both worlds are shown sympathetically and with dignity, in a manner that highlights their differences without the expected Hollywood triteness.
This is an example of a movie's musical score acting to enhance and magnify the impact of the film.  This movie has a great score, which many have enjoyed on CD in its own right.
I consider this the best cop flick I've ever seen.  I wish more films were like this.  A truly great experience.",1038096000,3,1264,4.618834080717488

242421,4,6300214567,"Witness features one of Harrison Ford's best performances, and it proved once and for all that he was capable doing more than action movies. Overall, Witness is an entertaining movie and a well-done combination of a love story and a thriller. Additionally, it does an excellent job of making a contrast between the innocence and simplicity of Amish life and the grime and violence of the city. In fact, if anything, the movie's only fault is that it exaggerates the contrast and paints the city too darkly.
In Witness, Samuel (Lukas Haas in a very impressive performance), a young Amish boy, witnesses a murder in the mens' room of a train station on his first trip to Philadelphia. When the boy and his beautiful mother, Rachel (Kelly McGillis), speak to the police about the matter, police chief John Book (Harrison Ford) explains that, because the boy was a material witness to a homicide, the law demands that he stay and help identify the killer. When he does, however, Book realizes they are in danger and, even after being shot badly, drives the boy and his mother all the way to their farm before collapsing. Consequently, he is forced to stay with the Amish, and, while recovering and hiding from the killers, he learns about the Amish lifestyle and falls in love with Rachel.
Anyhow, Witness has a compelling story, is well directed, and also has some very nice shots of the Amish countryside and lifestyle. With a wonderful performance from Harrison Ford (and the rest of the cast, for that matter), this movie is very entertaining - see it soon!",1029024000,4,1557,4.770370370370371
242422,5,6300214567,"Harrison Ford received his only Oscar nomination for this 1985 film in which a young Amish boy (Lukas Haas) witnesses a murder in Philadelphia while traveling with his mother, Rachel (Kelly McGillis).  When it becomes clear the bad guys are gunning for the boy, and that they include people in his own department, John Book (Ford) flees with them back to their home.  There the big city cop has to come to terms with not only the new culture in which he is immersed, but also his feelings for the young widow.
Director Peter Weir captures the beauty and dignity of Amish life.  By the time violence intrudes into this world we are prepared to see it as being a blight upon a peaceful community.  Of course, it intrudes upon the possibility of love between the two main characters, but we knew the odds were against this pair as soon as we saw their worlds collide.  Ford's performance is clearly the best of his career and perhaps touches closest to the actor's dark side.  McGillis is equally restrained as the woman who ends up symbolizing so much to John Book, and the film includes one of the few instances in modern cinema where nudity can truly be said to be romantic.
Most Romantic Line:  (1) ""If we'd made love last night I'd have to stay. Or you'd have to leave.""  (2) ""What you take into your hand, you take into your heart.""

242493,5,6300214567,"Although I suppose ""Bladerunner"" is the movie that showed Harrison Ford could do something outside of ""Star Wars"", I personally think ""Witness"" was one of the most important movies of his career, because it's a complete departure from a science fiction storyline, and therefore paved the way for all the Tom Clancy stuff and other movies that featured him as a romantic hero.

Here he plays John Book, a police detective who has to interrogate a small Amish boy who is the only witness to a brutal murder in a train terminal washroom. When the boy makes an ID that implicates a respected fellow police detective, Book gets wounded, but realizes that he must get the boy and his widowed mother (Kelly McGillis) back to the Amish country and go underground. Thus, much of the movie concerns itself with the fish out of water experience he has, trying to pass as an Amish man, learning about their life and falling in love with the boy's mother. This is dangerous territory for her, as her father-in-law warns her that if she steps out of line, she will be shunned by her community. And then of course, the corrupt police have been looking for Book and the boy, remember. Final showdown is about as you would expect it, and glad to have it so. One interesting note is the pretty good performance by Alexander Godonoff, the defected ballet dancer, as a jealous suitor of Kelly McGillis. Too bad he died so young; he might have branched into a whole new career here.
I hadn't seen this for many years before finding it among the tapes at a bed and breakfast place last summer. I was pleased to find it as enjoyable today as it was years ago, and my friend who had never seen it was enthralled, as you would be, too.",1024617600,35,1710,4.516129032258065
242494,5,6300214567,"Witness is a pretty decent film.  The story begins with a young Hamish boy witnessing a brutal murder on his first visit to a big city.  John Book (Ford) then enters the story, a tough city cop who has to protect his witness.
The film examines the class of two cultures, the Amish and city folk.  Book slowly begins to be influenced by the Amish way of life and begins to fall for an Amish girl.  The idea of a cop going being influenced by foreign values has been done since (Black Rain, Red Heat) but never as well.  At times you feel like you're watching two separate films, one about the Amish and a fairly conventional cop thriller.
Witness is very well written (Raymond Frensham refers to Witness as a template in his book Teach Yourself Screenwriting).  Barely a scene is wasted and all of them work within the story.  The soundtrack and the film in general is very eighties.  Due to the stories simplicity and audience expectations I don't think Witness would get made today.
The DVD contains a short documentarily which is fine.  Witness is not the kind of film you want to analyse but a film that tells a story well.",1024185600,,1126,4.453658536585366

I enjoyed the parts involving the Amish.  It was great getting a glimpse of their lifestyle, which obviously is so different from most of ours.  The Amish characters were overall believable as well.
However, the crime aspect of the movie was pretty lame, especially the end.  It felt like they didn't quite know how to bring the movie to a close so they did the usual Hollywood ending - big gun battle!!  The problem was it was so routine and the actions of the bad guys didn't make sense.  The Kelly McGillis character didn't make sense either -[...]she shows him her all at one point, kisses him passionately at another point, and then in the end...well, I won't spoil it but it didn't quite jibe with her previous behaviour.
On the DVD, the picture was pretty poor - lots of grain, poor resolution in most scenes (especially wide shots);  [...].  Sound was OK - oddly, I thought that the music sounded good, but the dialogue was distorted at times.  As for the music, I thought that the soundtrack was a real problem.  Swelling synthesizers throughout most of the Amish scenes?  Total disconnect for me.
Anyway, it's always good to hear both sides of the story, and my side is that this was not such a good movie.  I can't believe that it was nominated for Best Picture!",1014508800,3,1368,4.542857142857143

It is somewhat slow and obvious, and McGillis's character, Rachel, never behaves believeably as an Amish woman.

The plot is so unique - a young window with a small son, living in the Amish country, harbor an inner-city police officer in order to solve a crime. Add a bit of romance (Kelly McGillis and Harrison Ford have delightful, downplayed chemistry) and you have a movie bound to please everybody. There's a little action, a little drama, a little romance, and a little suspense. Elements that, when put together, make this a truly wonderful film.
What I liked best was the portrayal of the Amish. Instead of painting them as quaint, sheltered people, the movie concentrates on their values and their mindset. The end result leaves the viewer with a strong feeling that maybe they've been living life the right way, and we've somehow gone astray.
The supporting characters (a viscious Danny Glover, small and innocent Samuel, and the old and wise - if a bit stubborn - Eli) are perfect, and lend the movie a almost homey feeling. With the exeption of the villains, most are three dimensional and complex, and play an important role in the story instead of merely being a distraction.
I've never seen two stars more perfectly cast than Harrison and Kelly. She's brilliant as the young widow who's quickly falling in love with the believable and convincing police officer.

242501,5,6300214567,"At the end of a disappointing summer movie season, I've started watching some of my favorites on tape. This movie is near the top of my all-time list; here's why:
ACTORS -- Most of the actors gave career-high performances in this movie. ""Witness"" helped establish Harrison Ford as a serious (i.e., non-Star Wars) action hero, and he demonstrates emotional range in this movie that doesn't show up very often in more recent films. Kelly McGillis is compelling, gradually and believably transforming from a shy widow out of her element to a strong, spirited member of her Amish community. Lukas Haas, who plays her son, offers a level of child acting that has only recently been matched by Haley Joel Osment. As other reviewers have noted, his wordless scene with Ford in the police station is a brilliant piece of acting -- an enormous amount of information and emotion is conveyed in complete silence. And Alexander Godunov brings a gentle grace to his role as the Amish farmer competing with Ford for McGillis' affections. It's sad that he didn't get more opportunities to demonstrate his acting ability before his death a few years later.
CINEMATOGRAPHY/SCORE -- As with most of Peter Weir's films (cf. ""Dead Poet's Society""), ""Witness"" is visually stunning. The shift from the gritty heart of Philadelphia to the rolling hills of Amish country is jarring, and leaves one with a palpable sense of longing. I think the barn-raising scene in the middle of the movie is one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen filmed, both visually and thematically. Underscored (so to speak) with music reminiscent of Copland's ""Appalachian Spring,"" it drives home the value of community and shared endeavor. It's a marvelously uplifting segment.
ROMANCE/EROTICISM -- The relationship between Ford and McGillis is very well done. The attraction that arises between them (driven in no small part, apparently, by Ford's kindness to the young boy) is constantly and realistically tempered by the awareness that they come from fundamentally different cultures. That slows the development of a relationship between them, which provides the movie with a delightful undercurrent of romantic tension. That tension reaches a peak in a powerful scene in which Ford sees McGillis giving herself a sponge bath. There is nudity in this scene (McGillis turns and shows herself, topless, to Ford), but it seems to be precisely the kind of nudity that, as actresses like to say, ""is essential to the story."" Given the way in which the Amish are portrayed in this film, McGillis' character is making a very bold (and risky) offer, and the difficulty of Ford's refusal is evident in his face. There certainly is a lot of gratuitous nudity in film, but ""Witness"" is not in that category.
This movie is aging extremely well, in large part because of the sweep of its vision, the powerful simplicity of its story, and the skill of its execution. It is a terrific movie.",998265600,15,2939,4.987780040733197

242550,5,6300214567,"Why didn't Harrison Ford win an Oscar for this movie? He gives a performance that is still the best of his career, he is surprisingly...emotional. Near the end, anyway. Witness is a story about many different things, and suceeds in nearly all of them. Young Amish boy Samuel Lapp is the witness to a grisly murder, and immediately becomes crucial to the investigation to find the killers, headed by veteran police officer John Book. It doesn't take Book long to figure out that there's a conspiracy in the Philadelphia Police Department, a conspiracy to sell drugs above the law. Book gets into a gunfight, then skips town to save himself, Samuel and his mother, Rachel, a widow. As the story progresses, John and Rachel become attracted to each other, which leads to lots of tension because of the Amish angle. You wonder if one will abandon their life to join the other. This tension is part of what makes the movie great. There's humor, although a little more would not have been out of line, and there's plenty of excitement when the crooked cops return to silence Book once and for all. Sure, the ending is pretty disappointing, and there are some goofs, like some of the other reviewers have mentioned (I honestly didn't notice them until I looked for them), and this movie has a defininte eighties feel, with those wonderful synthesizers that you remember (or are unable to forget, as is my case), but this is the best film of Ford's career, he was nominated for an Oscar, and he should have won it in my opinion.

This is one of Ford's best movies ever, and the subtle humor  and constant frustration that he displays with the ""lost world""  into which he has plunged is amazing to watch.  And as good as the  principal actors/actresses are, Jan Rubes as grandfatherly Eli Lapp  absolutely steals every scene that he is in--he's outstanding!  His  ""gun of the hand"" scene with young Lukas Haas where he tries in  vain to explain to his young grandson just what is wrong with and about the  world that exists outside of their own is a real education into Amish  beliefs, and is beautifully done. And watch for one of the most incredible  scenes ever filmed--Lukas Haas's discovery, in the most unlikely of all  places, of the murderer.  This segment was filmed only to music and the  resulting facial reactions, and the accompanying horror felt by both Haas  and Ford are masterfully done.  Adoringly filmed and beautifully scored,  this is one of those films that needs repeat viewings just to catch all of  the little nuances that populate it from beginning to end.  And talk about  beautiful symbology---the final scenes showing Harrison Ford, the winding  road back to his world curving off into the distance as he stands at the  front door of Kelly McGillis's house and the hallway behind her that leads  back to her world, are spellbinding.

Peter  Weir's direction is practically flawless.  The evil cops are as evil as  evil can be, and the Amish are treated kindly, with respect and admiration.  Quite simply though, the reason this is a great thriller is that it is a  powerful love story.
The passionate love that is felt and built upon, but  not consummated, envelops the audience in anticipation.  What makes this  happen is some real-not contrived-obstacle to the expression of that love,  such as the lovers being from different and warring families, as in ""Romeo  and Juliet,"" or from different cultures, as here in ""Witness.""  She is  Amish, and he is a big city cop who ""whacks"" people.  For their love to  work, a gulf as wide as the Pacific Ocean has to be bridged.

242557,4,6300214567,"One of the more exemplary police thrillers to come out of hollywood in the mid 80's and with a twist too. Other reviewers have outlined the plot more clearly and cleverly than I could either add or detract. This was the film  that brought the Menonite community of Lancaster county,Pennsylvania to the  attention of the world it had tried so hard to turn its back on. The  producers neglect to mention if permission was sought from the Amish to  film within their environment. If so then it must have been to their  everlasting regret. ""Alas poor amish I knew them well"". From what  we hear Lancaster county has been beseiged with tourists and curiosity  seekers even some 14 years after the films release. Enough said.
I can  only add more positive comments to what other reviewers have said to what  is a very suspenseful and original thriller with some superb performances  by Lukas Haas, Danny Glover and Kelly McGillis in particular. Probably the  best scene for me was at the police precinct when the young boy is  exploring his strange surroundings as children do and unexpectedly comes  across the killers picture in the most unexpected place. In the hustle and  bustle of a busy police station only detective Book notices the boys  astonishment and comes across to see the cause. And then the truth suddenly  dawns on both of them... This should have been a stepping stone to a more  successful career but alas McGillis seems to have slipped from our screens  of late. Also of note was the superb photography, especially during the  barn raising scenes and the music by Maurice Jarre which seemed to capture  just the right ambience of this quaint rural community. Also look out for a  small cameo by Viggo Mortensen. No doubt many have viewed  ""Witness"" time and time again with reruns and video releases but  it is always a treat if you can to sit down and watch with a friend who has  not yet ""witnessed"" it.

7805664,5,6300214567,"Time to watch it again. I just added this to my wish list. I saw it when it first came out a couple times and just started thin inking about it today. The barn raising scene to be exact. I started searching around the internet and began reading other peoples thoughts on the movie. They were talking about the little things that may go unnoticed the first time around that on reflection mean so much in later viewings.

I have always liked Ford and him being a few years prior to me at my high school probably adds to that. I know he does enjoy carpentry and often wonder if he may have taken wood shop, perhaps with the same teacher. I do know he was one of the nerdy types in radio club.

It begins with people walking in a field. Horse-drawn buggies travel in 1984 Pennsylvania. A man speaks Pennsylvania Dutch to the assembled people. Then they eat. A man has died. Some of the Amish will travel on a train to a big city. Be careful among the English is their advice. The train to Baltimore is delayed, they wait in the train station, alone. Two men attack and knife another man! They hear a noise and search the stalls. The young boy ducks under a partition to escape. The police arrive and question young Samuel. He is a material witness. [How accurate can a description be of a stranger only seen for short time under stress?] Detective John Book takes them to his home for safekeeping. Can Samuel identify a suspect? Yes. But he sees a newspaper photo of another black man, Lt. McFee. There was a case where a gallon of P2P disappeared after a police raid.

There is a shooting attempt on Detective Book. He borrows a car, takes the mother and son, and goes into hiding. His partner removes the folders on Rachel Lapp and her son. The crooked cops go to search for Book, but he is gone. Book was hit but doesnt want to go to a hospital because the doctors will report any gunshot wound and he would be found. Book will be treated, his automobile is towed to a barn and hidden. There is a problem talking to the Amish. Samuel looks at John Books pistol! Samuel gets a lecture about a weapon. Book is offered Amish clothes to wear. The Mennonites have cars and telephones. [Why does Book have no beard?] His partner tells John to stay away, he would be in danger. Milking time is 4:30 AM. John learns a new skill. Later they hear music from the car radio. He dances with Mrs. Lapp, until an elder arrives. The people gossip, there is talk about shunning.

In Philadelphia Books partner is questioned bout his whereabouts. Books arm is pretty much healed now. There is a communal gathering to build a structure. It is completed by sunset. Book sees Rachel, its raining at night. A bus tour arrives in Amish country. Book learns Sergeant Carter was killed in the line of duty! Book calls his superior office about this. There are rude visitors; they learn a lesson in manners! But this attracts attention. John will leave for his own world tomorrow. In the dawn a big sedan arrives, three men leave with shotguns. They invade the Lapp home, they want Book (who is in the barn). One shoots at Book and misses. A deluge of grain stops Fergie. Book recovers his shotgun and stops McFee. Samuel rings the bell to summon others. Paul is stopped. The local police rollup to handle the situation. Book returns to his automobile and drives away.

In 1915 John Buchan wrote The Thirty-Nine Steps, a story where an innocent man is hunted by the police for murder and the villains because he knows too much. The hero winds in the end. That plot was used in many movies by Hitchcock and others. This ending reminds me of Shane, where the hero leaves to travel on. Since so many movies have been made there must always be similarities in movies. Was this based on the Rampart scandal in the Los Angeles Police Department where drugs and money disappeared from the Evidence Room?",1521763200,,3198,4.527681660899654
