8267147,3,B0017T0Z3K,"I liked the idea of this film - the small island where the potter's field for New York city is. Mass graves are marked, but for a long time no one was allowed to visit. I wanted to learn more after reading the website and watching a video there. This does not have the same drama. The impact was not there for me in the movie, as it was on the website. There are people interviewed who tell their stories. In between the stories, which is a greater part of the film, music is played while shots of the island are shown.  I found the music so distracting and, I have to say, just awful! I just couldn't take it anymore and I had to turn the film off! The pictures of the island are not explained so you don't know what you are looking at. I had a clue because I read the website. I really wanted to like the film. I thought it was going to be partly about how people fought to be able to visit the graves of their relatives, but it is not what I expected.",1422921600,6,954,3.994764397905759
