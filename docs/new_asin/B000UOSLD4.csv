8214192,1,B000UOSLD4,"This DVD is horrible for a beginner. I have taken a real Eskrima class and this is terrible. They go through basics, but with ZERO instruction. All you get is a dubbed over voice that tells you what the move is, not HOW to do it. Imagine how frustrating it is for a beginner who doesn't know what grip to use during a strike, where -exactly- his arms/hands/feet should be. None of that is explained at all. All it is is a man doing the move with a voice over that is in effect only a title to the move. Ridiculous. This was a complete waste of money and the worst purchasing decision I've ever made on Amazon. It's useless. How disappointing.",1288656000,,642,4.270491803278689
8214193,3,B000UOSLD4,"This DVD is tough to get through. It has a lot of basic stuff in it (which is good), but the way it goes over them is poor.
It shows a lot of people striking air, or blocking air. ""Here is attack 1, 2, 3, .. ""... ""Here is block 2, and 3, and 4...etc"" It is
always better to see them in action with a human targeted. It goes this way until around 13 minutes in. Then it starts to show the same attacks, with a human target, and how to block.
You can skip the first 13 minutes.
With a Disk that is only 33 minutes, to waste the first 4 minutes talking about salutes is criminal. Also, the speaker has ZERO energy. If he talked any slower, he'd be talking backwards. ""Let's see...... how..... he blocks.......... the..... 6th Strike....... which...... is also.... .... a thrust.."" Like that. Better then a Tax Software Tutorial, but man...
20Min in it goes back to attacks. The 12 or so types of swing (wheel, slap, pinwheel, thrust, etc), again, with no specific target or reasoning.
28min in it gets useful again with foot work drills.
From 33min onward is Katas, and previews. 39min total.
Tomb Raider 2 had instructions like this. Learn all the possible moves, then do the missions, rather then learning the simple moves, then their application, then adding more moves on top of that as you go. I hate this type of instruction.
$15 or $20 would be a better price. $30+ is way to high for what you get. But... If you study this DVD, then take a real class, you will have a leg up on all the newbs",1251936000,4,1496,4.289752650176679
