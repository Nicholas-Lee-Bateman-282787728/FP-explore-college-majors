8148315,5,B000J10GX6,I think the idea of someone (dressed as Santa) just shows how some people will take advantage of people at that great time of year.  I enjoyed this movie and LOVED the characters.,1483660800,,179,4.424242424242424

8148317,2,B000J10GX6,"Spoiler Alert, the neighbor is ""Santa.""  But for me he mostly comes off as a thoughtless and inconsiderate individual, making you wonder why the film's characters like him.  There's occasional warmer moments, but not enough to make it a happy Christmas film.  Apparently Santa is a costly but effective marketing seasonal employee at the toy factory.  There just didn't seem to be a whole lot of point to telling the story this way.  Whatever Christmas message was intended, it was jumbled up and mostly hard to find.  I like the idea of Santa being unconventional, but he should still be nice.",1451692800,,594,4.8316831683168315
