4011481,5,B002Y3GZD2,Out in the Silence is a great movie. I displays the troubles the lgbt community go through from youth on and it also shows that the community is starting to get some support and recognition,1271721600,5,189,4.428571428571429
4011482,5,B002Y3GZD2,"I grew up in the mountains of western Pennsylvania in a place similar to the setting of this documentary.  In the late 1970's and 1980's it was unheard of for anyone in my school to ""come out.""  I doubt I would have known what that meant.  This documentary beautifully reveals the pain experienced by gays trying to cope with life in small town America.  The pacing is effortless.  The intimate way the camera reveals the main characters lives illustrates the power of documentary to inspire empathy for ""the other.""  The fascinating curveball in Oil City is the local American Family Association chapter, which is unusual but serves as a convenient metaphor for larger forces in the nation. I wish I could have seen a film like this when I was a teenager.  I was most impressed by the gradual shift in the attitude of Evangelical Pastor Mark Micklos.  Though all is not well in small town America, this work shows that progress is possible.  Everyone who lives in rural areas and in small cities should watch this DVD.",1264809600,32,1019,4.679775280898877
4011483,5,B002Y3GZD2,"I was lucky enough to catch an advance preview of this documentary, and sincerely hope it will be seen by as many groups and individuals as possible.  As somebody very familiar with a similar community in Pennsylvania, I found the film an important window into small town America's slowly changing outlook on homosexuality and tolerance.  While the filmmakers are open and upfront about their own point of view, they provide a nuanced, compassionate portrait of the residents of Oil City Pennsylvania.  A very human story that will serve as a useful tool in promoting discussion and understanding among different people.",1262044800,28,620,5.18
4011484,5,B002Y3GZD2,"This powerful film does what the best social-issue films do: it takes a specific local story, and while presenting it in a fully-rounded, deep, and elegant way, it also illuminates a larger issue, provoking questions that will resonate with audiences of all kinds and in all places. This is a well-made film, illuminating the story of gay and lesbian people grappling with the realities of overyday life in their conservative rural community. Its fluid storytelling, high production values, and compelling characters pulled me in from the opening moments, and engaged me to the very end. It's poignant, powerful, acessible, shows both sides of the issue, and is surprisingly humorous.  I highly recommend it.",1260921600,8,708,5.265486725663717
4011485,5,B002Y3GZD2,"This film reminds me of an Agnes Varda documentary:  you start out thinking it's about one thing, but it turns into quite another.

The story begins when the filmmaker runs an announcement of his marriage to another man in his hometown newspaper in the small, conservative town of Oil City, PA.  Not surprisingly there is quite a backlash, especially from the head of a local right-wing fundamentalist group.  But instead of spending the next hour on the pros and cons of same-sex marriage, the filmmaker begins to explore what it's like to be gay or lesbian in a rural community.
'
Soon, the film evolves into a completely different set of interrelated stories about a gay youth who is being tormented at the oil City High School and his brave mom, two women who are trying to build a business, and a fundamentalist preacher who has second thoughts about the consequenceses of his religious pronouncements.  Each character is wonderful in their own way, but I especially liked the mother, Kathy, who is like a lioness fighting for her cubs.

Despite the serious subject matter, the documentary has  plenty of joy and humor.  I was fortunate to watch a preview screening in my home town with a supportive audience, and they were alternately crying, laughing and cheering.

This is the best documentary I've watched in a long time.  The real beauty is that it's not just for the already enlightened.  Nobody with a heart could watch this film and not be deeply moved.",1260489600,87,1466,4.777777777777778
4011486,4,B002Y3GZD2,"Out in the Silence is very well done as a documentary on being out as a gay person in small town America. It deals with religious barriers and discrimination from gay people's adversary, the American Family Association. Bigoted and with no desire to communicate or to try to understand the homosexual condition, they relentlessly thwart all efforts to normalize acceptance of gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender persons. It deals with school and school board issues and one young man's struggle to live with dignity. This is a very worthwhile film to watch!",1401580800,,562,5.119565217391305

4011495,4,B002Y3GZD2,"This documentary explores an attempt to prevent gay and lesbian abuse in a small town.  It primarily follows a young gay high school student as he attempts to cope with his coming out resulting harassment.  With his mothers assistance he seeks help from a gay prior student of the same school who returns to the community with his partner to provide helpful direction.  The documentary proves that persistence against narrow minded religious bigots can ultimately be rewarded through the legal system.

The characters are real and believable.  Much of the action is confrontational and appears to have been recorded live.  This would make an excellent video to be presented in conjunction with a training and discussion group.  If you have a small town background - be prepared to have some buried memories touched.",1379116800,,815,5.082706766917293

4011498,5,B002Y3GZD2,This documentary was very candid and follows the struggle against homophobia in a small town. The film encourages people to stand up and be who they are; visibility is so important in a society which tries to stifle people who are different.,1355616000,,241,4.761904761904762
4011499,5,B002Y3GZD2,"After viewing this movie, I realized I had already seen it in the past.... How great to see that a story such as this can not only catch my interest once, but catch it twice.

4011501,5,B002Y3GZD2,"Although the DVD version is probably fine, I bought the more expensive Blu-Ray version to support the film makers and the efforts they and others are putting in to stop bullying and discrimination caused by ignorance and bigotry.  The movie itself was done well.  It was often tough to see what the main character, the teenager CJ Bills, was going through across the time this was filmed.  As so many millions of us know, his fight for survival and dignity was and unfortunately still is in many places what life is like, despite the great progress that has been made in anti-discriminatory laws and education.

There are also some good people appearing in the movie, some such as Reverend Mark and Diana Micklos, who show what it is like to be Christians limited by human shortcomings that can be trancended by God's love.  It's a good documentary which shows a town struggle with different beliefs.  Many citizens nonetheless succeed in fostering a sense of community and inclusion.  There are some brave people in this movie, starting with CJ and his mom, Kathy Springer, Roxanne Hitchcock and her partner Linda Henderson and others, and I thank them for speaking out to fight crimes and injustices against humanity.  I thank Joe Wilson and husband Dean Hamer for making this movie and am glad to own a copy.",1323388800,3,1311,4.795555555555556
4011502,5,B002Y3GZD2,"When I first read about this movie, I decided it was a 'must have'. At the start of the movie I was a little disappointed, because the boy was given a camera and told to document his life. Being a boy, he started filming goofy stuff with his friends, like jumping on a trampoline etc. Then the doc authors told him to get serious and make a film about homophobia and how he's treated as a gay boy in a small town. Now the film get's down to it and paints a perfect picture of small town America; his family, friends, allies, enemies, the town villains and finally, people who are not so sure about homosexuality, but can listen. Folks this is as real as it gets. I work with queer youth clear across the country in a small town. Everything except the scenery, is almost exactly the same here. The parallels are almost scary. But seeing this doc just reaffirms how much work I have to do and gives me the impetus to continue on. Bravo for all the queer young adults willing to share their stories like this!",1320624000,4,1006,4.3
4011503,3,B002Y3GZD2,Not a huge fan of documentary type films. I was expecting something a little different and a real sucker for love story drama. Although the material I found to be relevant and interesting.,1319500800,,188,4.7272727272727275
4011504,4,B002Y3GZD2,"This short documentary makes great use of it's time. I found it informative and relatable. I found the narration a bit stilted though honest and grounded. From receiving a call for help in a letter, to the outcome of a suit against a town's school system that turned a blind eye, through an expose of a kid who's just a kid, and a salt of the earth lesbian couple working to make a mark to revitalize the town, the doc stays grounded and plain spoken. It's a bit uneven certainly and I found myself wanting to see deeper into the spectrum of homophobia in middle America, but the filmmaker wasn't interested in stereotypes or grandstanding. The antagonist isn't demonized, she's a woman using the voice of civil rights against civil rights, she's calm hatred and urgency, a voice veiled in the language of family and morality. She's the feeding trough of homophobic frenzy in the town where the movie makes its focus. She tells people they will loose something, tells them calmly that the world will become dangerous and insane and the afterlife promises to be painful if they allow something different than what keeps her sane. This keeps the doc's focus minimal but if we look deeply enough we can see how dangerous and powerful she is. But the narrow focus keeps the film restrained from being as universal as it could be. We see her, but hardly a glimpse of those feeding from her and what she means. Still, I personally found the doc profound in it's simplicity and relative lightness. An easy and deeply affecting watch. It's not over folks.",1312848000,2,1547,4.670329670329671
4011505,5,B002Y3GZD2,"At the beginning of this superb Documentary, I bristled at all of the anti-gay rhetoric being spewed by some of the inhabitants of a small ""rust-belt"" town in Pennsylvania. This documentary is initially about the film maker and producer of this movie ""Out in the Silence"" who has returned to his hometown of Oil City, Pennsylvania at the request of a very brave and courageous mother of a super-jock son that has come-out of the closet as a Gay man and is unmercifully being taunted and harassed by members of his community and, most of all, he is being bullied by his high school mates seemingly without any punishment for the inflictors of the abuse or is there seemingly any caring by the adults that were supposed to be looking after the welfare of ALL students.  The mother of this student sought out the film maker Joe Wilson because he had just been the victim of much ridicule and hate from a lot of residence in the aforesaid town because of his announcement, in the local paper, of his marriage to another man.

As indicated above, I negatively reacted to the hate that initially was shown in this film.  However, there is so much more to this movie.  It shows the determination of some very heroic women that happen to be gay and have the town's well-being so much at heart that they take on a very imposing and monumental task that benefits the town's hoped for rebirth even though because of being two gay women they are the recipients of loads of negativity.  This ""other side"" of ""Out in the Silence"" also shows people in all walks of life being able to change their attitudes and being able to have some understanding of those considered different than themselves.  This film touched my soul very deeply mainly because it shows so much hope from all.",1309564800,,1766,4.59047619047619

4011507,4,B002Y3GZD2,"I related to Joe Wilson and the pain and also the joy are not unknown emotions after my similar experience. I thought some of the story and acting was a tad too cartoony, especially some of the conservative portrayals. Perhaps I'm too sensitive to that but I think it harms our cause when we exaggerate those on the other wise. If we want honesty then we should give it. But I do not mean to imply Out of Silence is not honest, it is and is an overall great film with a vital message.",1297468800,2,484,4.159574468085107
4011508,5,B002Y3GZD2,My friends have already requested to borrow the DVD. It's important to know what people really think so we can educate them and help them understand.,1293580800,,149,4.769230769230769
4011509,4,B002Y3GZD2,"This is an interesting if mostly predictable movie. The drama of a gay kid in a redneck high school is the predictable part, although the kid in this case is unusually appealing. That is partly because he has an almost Brando-like look and quiet, macho strength about him, but mainly because he seems so perfectly NORMAL. He has a gentle manner, but there is nothing about him that would flag him as gay. So his decision to come out was perhaps especially brave because he is not the sort everybody would already know is gay. That is how he comes across in the movie, anyway: just a normal teenage kid whose main interests seem to be sports and hot rods, not fashion and Madonna.

But there is nothing new in his story: gay kid gets abused at school; teachers and school board turn a blind eye and a deaf ear, refusing even to address the issue; Mom is loving and supportive but lacks the confidence and resources to fight the system alone - until the ACLU gets involved.... You know the rest.

But what is extraordinary in this movie is a local pastor named Mark Micklos. He is one of the people who wrote to the hometown paper objecting to the Joe Wilson/Dean Hamer wedding announcement that was the catalyst for the whole movie. Wilson begins by interviewing him and his wife, and as he is with most of his interviewees, Wilson starts out pretty defensive. But although they disagree about gay marriage, Micklos refuses to spar with Wilson about the issue. Instead, he insists on keeping a dialog open and on trying to show Wilson the love of Jesus instead of arguing with or attacking him.

What is amazing and deeply gratifying is that it works. Almost against his will, Wilson begins to trust him. They never agree, but they become real friends. By the end of the movie, the greatest change is in Joe Wilson himself. He is less defensive and more tolerant of those who are intolerant of him. If all Christians were like Mark Micklos, the world would be a much better place.",1287705600,11,1979,4.53781512605042
4011510,3,B002Y3GZD2,"This DVD is OK, but the contents was a little disappointing. It is an amateur production that attempts to 'investigate' the reason/s why a cute gay school boy from some hick town in the USA is getting bullied and victimized. It does not succeed. I got the distinct feeling that the boy was trying to cash in on the (possibly) political incorrect actions of the school and school board. It is never clear how exactly he was victimized - except that some kids were being nasty and called him names. This legal action could only succeed in the USA, in every other country he would have failed to prove his case. My feeling was that he got paid to get rid of a problem - even if his claim was mostly unfounded - it was easier just to get rid of it. And in the end he buys a car with the money paid in settlement of his claim. A cute boy that got the all American dream - his own muscle car. I was happy for him in the way that I like all cute boys to be happy and succeed. But be warned, it is an amateurish production with little substance.",1287446400,4,1037,4.113300492610837

I had gone to see the film not really know what I was walking into.  It was a truly moving experience.  In the current historical context, with the recent suicides of several gay students, this is a powerful and must-see film.

4011513,5,B002Y3GZD2,"This movie is excellent. I was born in Oil City & moved outside of Washington DC after I graduated from college. I'm really glad this film was made because no one from outside of this area believes me that places like this still exist today. I graduated high school in 2001 with Diane Gramley's son (in a class of 63 people) and remember how difficult she made everything. I've seen many people get mistreated simply because they are gay, black, Latino, etc. I myself am 1/2 Latina and heard some pretty horrible things. I would recommend this movie to everyone.",1283990400,9,562,4.63
4011514,5,B002Y3GZD2,"Living in a small superstitious town I can relate to this film. Have you ever wondered why corporations and otherwise sane individuals pander to superstition. Because it creates an ""atmosphere"" of belief and gullibility and therefore control. One of the best examples is the superstition of the ""13th floor"" in buildings. Mathematics, science, actuality, even common sense demands that the floor exists and yet the delusion that it does not is imposed upon the most rational of people. The religious intolerance seen in this film is not surprising since the inherent unprovability and irrationality of religion must FORCE conformity. The word ""heretic"" originates from the Greek hairetikos meaning `able to choose'. Whether by laws or violence religion strips you of the freedom to choose in order to subjugate you to it's control. Belief is a powerful force and fear is another form of belief. For example, if you have a fear of snakes then you must believe in the ability of a snake to harm you or you would not fear it. Prejudice and homophobia are just other forms of irrational belief. People murder daily, and parents allow their children to suffer and die unnecessarily, all because of their beliefs. Imagine the power if you could control what people believe. Cons, politicians, religions, and corporations all desire to control your belief, because people will sacrifice everything to have its manifestation, even if it is imposed upon them and against their personal and common good.",1280188800,4,1493,5.122950819672131

8384025,2,B002Y3GZD2,"Great story. Misleading though. C.J. is not really gay. Having a character that is not truly gay in a story like this, takes away from the REAL story being told.

How is the gay rights movement going to have an effect on people, if the examples we place in front of them are people like C.J. who claim to be gay, just to end up with a child and in a relationship with someone of the opposite sex? Using him as an example only emboldens the arguments against gays. By giving substance to the arguments ""it's a choice"" and ""we can change if we want"".

This could have been better....I'm a very disappointed viewer. I don't blame the film maker, I don't believe he could have known C.J. wasn't really gay.

I felt for C.J. the whole time watching, I could totally sympathize with him. Then afterward I discovered that he's not really gay. Kind of a slap in the face.
