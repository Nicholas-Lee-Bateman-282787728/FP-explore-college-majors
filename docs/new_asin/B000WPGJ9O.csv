2988992,1,B000WPGJ9O,"You watch a manipulative man who is clearly emotionally unbalanced hit your sister and you don't greet him at the door with a baseball bat? You trust the word of a guy you barely know over that of your reliable daughter? Knowing a man's record for breezing through women, you run off and marry him the day he is supposed to be getting married to someone else? And as the ""otherwise smarter than everyone else"" (not that that is hard) villain of the piece, you just happen to leave your financial records and a personal letter in the same box as the effects of the woman you just murdered...and give them to the one person pissed off enough to do something with them? And the cops, what was this? Keystone? The sheer stupidity of these mostly insipid characters leaves one wanting to throw things at the screen. The horrendous lack of common sense, the leaps of logic in the plot, you are drawn to Tennant's nasty Brendan just for being interesting and clearly smarter than most of greater London (or at least according to this film), that is until a convenient piece of Plot Induced Stupidity is required.

And the ending, oh for the love of GAWD was it contrived! I'm surprised, given the forensic savvy of today's viewing audience, anyone in the production thought that was even remotely believable.

Brendan is a great part (in a very nasty way) and well acted in an otherwise lousy film. It's easy to see why Tennant chose this role. It's not only the juiciest, it's the best in the piece. Not to mention I don't think he had played anything that evil before (at least not on screen, Barty Crouch Jr. is a cartoon character compared to this Brendan Block), and given what he does with this role, he should play evil more often. Wow! So if you are a die-hard Tennant fan, this will keep you happy. But if you are looking for a good story, forget it.

And if you are a die hard Tennant fan, lobby them to get ""Recovery"" out on DVD. Way better, amazingly better, worlds-away better, script to see the actor in.",1246579200,20,2011,4.4890710382513666
2988993,5,B000WPGJ9O,"I rented this to see David Tennant in something other than Doctor Who and got far more than I expected to see.  For every woman who has ever been interested in a man because he has charm and good looks, this is the argument for taking it slow and careful if ever I saw one.  Brendan is capable of great charm, masking the psychotic beneath.  The show is at its' best when he's turning Miranda's family against her with a carefully-placed conversation or two that makes you wonder if your own loved ones could be fooled so easily.  It twists and turns so many times, but has a satisfying end.  I promptly bought it to watch again.",1242000000,9,629,4.3418803418803416
2988994,5,B000WPGJ9O,"Secret Smile.  Rate *****
A well acted and directed probably made for television as it was presented in 2 parts.  Started rather a bit slow but this Psychological thriller developed very excitingly as the time passes. Suspence prevaled as the minutes passed. I have not read the original novel by the now established Nicci French from which the script was adapted.
I don't like to get inside the mind of this psychopath whose mysteries smile was full of venom, while showing innocence.  I recommend that it. It is more than worth having this DVD in your library.
The quality of the transfer is very good as also the sound track.  It has a very exciting finale after all the jealousy, greed and revenge not to mention the innocent deaths.  Actors David Tennant (Casanova) and Kate Ashfield (Shaun of the Dead) in my opinion were great.  Don't reviel the ending.",1229990400,2,860,4.738255033557047
2988995,5,B000WPGJ9O,"I'd read the book prior to buying the DVD and was already a fan of the story. Watching David Tennant playing so many heroic and comedic roles, it was so exhilarating seeing him play a damaged and manipulative character. I think he carried the piece, where other acting performances dropped (quite heavily in parts), he was there to pick everything back up again.",1229385600,6,362,4.761904761904762
2988996,4,B000WPGJ9O,"I don't tend to watch this kind of film but I found Secret Smile to be well done.  Creepy without being overly gross.  David Tennant was particularly good.  The way ""Brandon Block"" could, with tender and gentle touch and great goodwill in his eyes, deliver an oblique threat or be just flat inappropriate was really creepy at times.  This film is good for it's genre.",1222905600,5,367,4.6

2988998,3,B000WPGJ9O,"For those David Tennant fans out there, this is as un-Doctor-like as it gets. He plays an ideal boyfriend gone wrong, one whose devotion and attachment is flattering at the start but quickly becomes creepy then deadly. The coldness in his eyes is chilling. Yet he is not the lead, and it was the main character that I found lacking. I found Kate Ashfield disappointing, a little strident and a boring as her over-bleached hair, not convincing at all as a woman working in a man's world (I speak from experience here).
Nonetheless, I am delighted that this is available in Region 1 now and happy to be able to see it as a whole film rather than YouTube fragments. It's a must-have for Tennant fans.",1216598400,25,697,4.5396825396825395
2988999,3,B000WPGJ9O,"I ordered a copy of this US version straight away, however the actual copy's disc quality suffers quite much. The menu looks homemade, the image transfer is not satisfactory, and the image is 4:3 instead of the original 16:9, which means quit some bits are cut off from either side of the screen.

Quality aside, the drama is still great!! I also recommend the novel by Nicci French.",1215648000,6,383,4.632352941176471
2989000,5,B000WPGJ9O,"no secret here...David Tennant is an amazing actor.  Equal parts charming and deliciously evil, David pulls this role on like a custom fit suit and strides about with purpose and passion.  Plenty of lovely twists and turns to keep a person from getting too comfortable with the story.  Your unease builds to a real nail biter of a conclusion that moves you forward on the couch a bit.  I was this close to yelling at the screen,'get out of the house you silly girl!'...always a good sign in a movie!",1213920000,32,499,4.511111111111111
2989001,5,B000WPGJ9O,David Tennant is absolutely fantastic in this film - completely believable and utterly psychotic (in a kind of good way).

2989007,1,B000WPGJ9O,Some reviews have been critical of the plot twists as being unbelievable but I think the writers took their cues from crimes that have really happened.

David Tennant was the draw for me but this film was very Lifetime channel  which I never care to watch and wouldn't have if I'd reviewed it first.,1521676800,,368,4.6461538461538465

The other characters are good support, but Tennant's character makes it. Sinister at it's best. This move made me realize how versatile he is.

2989014,3,B000WPGJ9O,"Warning:  Spoiler alert....
It started out annoying that all Mirandas family and friends would believe a stranger over her.  It got thilling but i was confused by the ending.  She gives up her identity including her license for architecture to imprison this man who she had gotten rid of finally when he moved on to next victim.  I guess she was motivated by the deaths of her best friend and brother but that seems a huge sacrifice to make.  Her family also accepts this too easily.  He may have been a psychopath but she ends up a criminal as well.",1520812800,,550,4.45
2989015,4,B000WPGJ9O,"I love David Tennant and have seen just about everything he's done (except his turn as Dr. Who....not a fan) so when I saw this on Amazon Prime, I binged. Well, DT did not disappoint, and the rest of the cast was fine as well. But the review loses a star because of some whopping great weaknesses in the writing.
For one thing, do they not have locksmiths in the UK? How many times does that creep have to walk in to Miranda's apt before she changes the damn locks?? And letting her sister & the psycho move into her flat, especially once she knows what he is...that's just not believable.

It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth a watch, if only because Tennant absolutely nails the creepy psycho control freak role so completely.",1520726400,2,736,4.492537313432836
2989016,3,B000WPGJ9O,"Good drama. David Tenant amazing! The story of a gal who meets s guy and sleeps with him once and he appears in her apartment uninvited and stalks her. He goes after her sister and says very suggestive thing to Amanda behind her sisters back. Im only telling this because I don't see why Amanda never told anyone what he was doing. Everyone in her family thought the sun rose and set on him. But she never disclosed her reasons for finding him creepy.
This is a 2005 BBC show. Can things have changed that much in 13 years? Apparently. Women aren't silent victims anymore.",1520726400,,572,4.457142857142857
2989017,4,B000WPGJ9O,"This series was a let down in ba way, the premise of the series is one we have seen before. However, the acting is good. David Tennant is superb as the sneaky jerk who is a narsacissist, overbearing criminal.

The storyline may hook you right away, Brendan Block played by David Tennant dates Miranda Cotton, played by Kate Ashfield. Brendan becomes obsessed with Miranda, but she sees him for what he is and dumps him.  Brendan becomes a stalker of sorts, and interesting developments occur in the family. Lots of twists and turns in this plot, and even though the storyline may be predictable, we are kept on tenterhooks.

Fine film for a cold or rainy day.

2989018,4,B000WPGJ9O,"A good three-episode story. If you like stories about moral treachery and creepy nut-cases (which i kinda do) this will be worth a try. Especially since the story doesn't outstay its welcome. It's not a mystery, per se. More of a suspense thriller. And it has a satisfying ending. I will say though that our heroine is foolhardy at times, which is kinda par for the course for heroines in thrillers, i guess. A lot of people suffered because of her.",1520726400,,449,4.555555555555555

2989022,5,B000WPGJ9O,"David Rennet has an amazing way of making you fall in love with him. This role shows a darker side to his devilish wit.
The character of Miranda was a breath of fresh air. A strong , intelligent lady who was not dependent on a male liking her to be able to have a life. That of course is the very thing that landed her in hot water.
Appreciate that although there was violence it was not graphic or overdone.
Finding that British made shows are so much better than the dribble in the US.",1520121600,,487,4.136842105263158

Well, this show is one totally unrealistic act after another.  It's absolutely unbelievable.  However, having said that, I'm giving it three stars for David Tennant's performance as a thoroughly repugnant character.

2989035,4,B000WPGJ9O,"A woman is drawn to an attractive man at an ice rink. She leaves her date behind and takes off with him for a big one night stand. Over a very short time, he becomes creepy, possessive and intrusive. She breaks up with him and all hell breaks loose. It is the man who is the draw in this tv show, who is none other than David Tennant. He  plays a potential psycho boyfriend to perfection. He has every nuance of such a creep down pat. The rest of the cast, especially the lead woman, is less ideal. The heroine could have been better cast. For one, her appearance is jarring with the trashy overly peroxided straw like hair. When she is seen as a supposed architect out in the field, you don't believe it. You also don't believe  she is such a red hot draw for men. Whereas Tennant has every brushstroke of his performance down to formidable detail and nuance, she can only keep to the broad outline of such a woman. But it is well worth watching for Tennant.

The first half is thoroughly convincing and no doubt about it, David Tennant is superb in the chilling role as Brendan. There's a good build up as psychopath Brendan is firstly given the heave-ho by Miranda and then ends up dating her sister. He slowly ingratiates himself into the family, isolating Miranda and you instinctivly know that dire grief is forthcoming.

The second half is not quite so convincing with the screenplay weakening in some parts. And, at one point the viewer is deliberately mislead. But heck, it still makes for great viewing. I recommend it.",1366502400,,787,4.64748201438849

I ordered this back in November and just got around to watching it today. I took the plastic wrap off and put it in the DVD player.  The movie was fine until the second episode, when the disc began to malfunction. I took it out and checked to see if there was a scratch or something. Nothing, no scratches, no dust. I put it back in and it continued to skip around and freeze and renders roughly 20 mins unwatchable. (I might add that these are 20 mins of extremely important plot points!!)

So I figure no big deal, I'll just return it and get a new one. Log in to Amazon and of course the return window has already expired. Missed it by 9 days. Great.

Lesson learned, when buying DVDs on Amazon, make sure to watch them BEFORE the return window expires.",1360368000,,882,4.201183431952662

Tennant was coldly terrifying, and I'm such a wuss that I couldn't look my screensaver in the eye for the next few days. He was demonic and menacing--all smiles and empty eyes--which were brown, ""but there was nobody at home,"" only an in-dwelling spirit of total malice. I do agree with other commentators about the weakness of the plot--why would everybody in a tightly knit family suddenly lose their good judgment over a complete stranger who has moved into--literally and figuratively--their lives? It's a long slide into hell for the heroine and a real nail biter all the way. Scary, but as I viewed it, I also had the queer feeling I was submitting to a kind of emotional abuse which I'd willingly taken on by continuing to watch.

But I was not ready for the shocking performance he gives here. He will blow you away and really truly make you hate him. You don't think Dr. Who when you see him. He's an utterly different person.

But Kate Ashfield was equally wonderful. Amazing work from both of them. I will seek her work out in the future.

It's a familiar story which we've seen before in lots of bad movies. The performances are what elevate this. I do want to complain about the presentation. I know its not a Blu-Ray, but the colors on this disc are faded and washed out. It looks like a very old TV show from 20 years ago whose prints haven't been taken care of. Also, the DVD menu is amateurish. So, I am subtracting a star for the presentation, but not the performance.",1328659200,2,896,4.3273809523809526
2989047,5,B000WPGJ9O,"Warning to those who only know David Tennant as the Doctor- be prepared to watch a couple of episodes of Doctor Who afterwards.  That's how good he is at playing Brendan Block, this superficially charming psychopath.  It got to the point that I was ready to find the nearest blunt object and beat his brains in every time I saw him. Also, Miranda Cotton, Kate Ashfield's character, breaks a Smart Girl cardinal rule- never, EVER take a strange man home with you and have sex with him, no matter how attractive or charming he may seem, and pays for it in spades.

You trust the word of a guy you barely know over that of your reliable daughter? Knowing a man's record for breezing through women, you run off and marry him the day he is supposed to be getting married to someone else? And as the ""otherwise smarter than everyone else"" (not that that is hard) villain of the piece, you just happen to leave your financial records and a personal letter in the same box as the effects of the woman you just murdered...and give them to the one person pissed off enough to do something with them? And the cops, what was this? Keystone? The sheer stupidity of these mostly insipid characters leaves one wanting to throw things at the screen. The horrendous lack of common sense, the leaps of logic in the plot, you are drawn to Tennant's nasty Brendan just for being interesting and clearly smarter than most of greater London (or at least according to this film), that is until a convenient piece of Plot Induced Stupidity is required.

And the ending, oh for the love of GAWD was it contrived! I'm surprised, given the forensic savvy of today's viewing audience, anyone in the production thought that was even remotely believable.

Brendan is a great part (in a very nasty way) and well acted in an otherwise lousy film. It's easy to see why Tennant chose this role. It's not only the juiciest, it's the best in the piece. Not to mention I don't think he had played anything that evil before (at least not on screen, Barty Crouch Jr. is a cartoon character compared to this Brendan Block), and given what he does with this role, he should play evil more often. Wow! So if you are a die-hard Tennant fan, this will keep you happy. But if you are looking for a good story, forget it.

A well acted and directed probably made for television as it was presented in 2 parts.  Started rather a bit slow but this Psychological thriller developed very excitingly as the time passes. Suspence prevaled as the minutes passed. I have not read the original novel by the now established Nicci French from which the script was adapted.
I don't like to get inside the mind of this psychopath whose mysteries smile was full of venom, while showing innocence.  I recommend that it. It is more than worth having this DVD in your library.
The quality of the transfer is very good as also the sound track.  It has a very exciting finale after all the jealousy, greed and revenge not to mention the innocent deaths.  Actors David Tennant (Casanova) and Kate Ashfield (Shaun of the Dead) in my opinion were great.  Don't reviel the ending.",1229990400,2,860,4.738255033557047

For one thing, do they not have locksmiths in the UK? How many times does that creep have to walk in to Miranda's apt before she changes the damn locks?? And letting her sister & the psycho move into her flat, especially once she knows what he is...that's just not believable.

Brendan becomes obsessed with Miranda, but she sees him for what he is and dumps him.  Brendan becomes a stalker of sorts, and interesting developments occur in the family.

He slowly ingratiates himself into the family, isolating Miranda and you instinctivly know that dire grief is forthcoming.

I put it back in and it continued to skip around and freeze and renders roughly 20 mins unwatchable. (I might add that these are 20 mins of extremely important plot points!!)

He was demonic and menacing--all smiles and empty eyes--which were brown, ""but there was nobody at home,"" only an in-dwelling spirit of total malice. I do agree with other commentators about the weakness of the plot--why would everybody in a tightly knit family suddenly lose their good judgment over a complete stranger who has moved into--literally and figuratively--their lives? It's a long slide into hell for the heroine and a real nail biter all the way. Scary, but as I viewed it, I also had the queer feeling I was submitting to a kind of emotional abuse which I'd willingly taken on by continuing to watch. Can't actually say I enjoyed the experience.",1340928000,4,884,4.6369426751592355
3223543,4,B000WPGJ9O,"I am a big fan of Tennant as Doctor Who. I've also enjoyed his work in Fright Night, Hamlet, Harry Potter, and his amazing performance as Casanova. But I was not ready for the shocking performance he gives here. He will blow you away and really truly make you hate him. You don't think Dr. Who when you see him. He's an utterly different person.

But Kate Ashfield was equally wonderful. Amazing work from both of them. I will seek her work out in the future.

It's a familiar story which we've seen before in lots of bad movies. The performances are what elevate this. I do want to complain about the presentation. I know its not a Blu-Ray, but the colors on this disc are faded and washed out. It looks like a very old TV show from 20 years ago whose prints haven't been taken care of. Also, the DVD menu is amateurish. So, I am subtracting a star for the presentation, but not the performance.",1328659200,2,896,4.3273809523809526
3223544,5,B000WPGJ9O,"Warning to those who only know David Tennant as the Doctor- be prepared to watch a couple of episodes of Doctor Who afterwards.  That's how good he is at playing Brendan Block, this superficially charming psychopath.  It got to the point that I was ready to find the nearest blunt object and beat his brains in every time I saw him. Also, Miranda Cotton, Kate Ashfield's character, breaks a Smart Girl cardinal rule- never, EVER take a strange man home with you and have sex with him, no matter how attractive or charming he may seem, and pays for it in spades.  She got a little obsessive in her mission to take Brendan down, but I wouldn't blame her.  He cost her a brother, a friend, her sanity and sense of safety.  I wouldn't be too surprised if he had something to do with his family's death as well.  In any event, if you like British television/movies, and especially if you're a Whovian that wants to see one of the Doctors in another light, check this out.",1319328000,14,966,4.429378531073446

3223546,3,B000WPGJ9O,"I like the movie, it's a great drama.  The quality of the picture and sound though, is as if someone was watching it on TV and had a video recorder pointed at the TV.  Really crappy quality on the picture and sound.  Tennant was thrilling and chilling.  The storyline is great.  Reminds me of alot of those lifetime movies where a romance goes really wrong.

Even for a made for TV movie (which this was) it's crap quality on the picture.  I was really disappointed.",1297209600,4,466,4.411764705882353
3223547,1,B000WPGJ9O,"Whatever merits the actors may or may not have, this movie is a great example of how the  screenwriter/director/whomever can take the content of a great book and shift it so as to make it a different story. And then call it by the name of the book to get that audience. Artistic license, phooey! Shooting necessity, phooey! It's like saying 'Oh, I have (a desk) just like that; except, it's smaller, it's not wood but metal, and the drawers are on the right, not the left.'",1287187200,3,473,4.436781609195402

A friend had a foreign player, though so we were able to watch it that way. The story is a little weak. You spend a lot of time thinking that people are simply not dim or gullible enough to believe a complete stranger over someone they've known for years. Very similar to Lifetime movies. If you're looking for something good with David Tennant I recommend Blackpool, but you'll need a special player for that one too, if you're in the States.",1286150400,,611,4.415929203539823

8224834,4,B000WPGJ9O,"I am a big fan of British TV and movies, and this one is a good psychological/revenge,creepy thriller, with excellent acting, and very recognizable, and familiar British actors. If you are looking for something along the lines of a Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Miranda Richardson, Imelda Staunton, Helen Mirren or Sally Richardson performance, this is not the series for you. If you are looking for a Happy Valley type of series,you will be disappointed. BUT if you are a David Tennant fan, and enjoy escaping into something that is not too deep but very entertaining, it may well be worth your time to have some fun and suspend logic for a minute. Kate Ashfield (an award winning actress) does a good job in the lead role.",1524528000,,720,4.722222222222222

Thus he's emboldened to spitefully wreck everyone you care about while you perfect a befuddled expression and wait waaaay too long to tell people what they need to know to protect themselves. It really irks me when women are portrayed as such idiots. If you want to spend some time yelling at the screen, this is your show.",1524355200,3,522,4.391752577319588
