7960709,5,B0000648XR,"I first came across this on the performance channel and was totally blow away with the fresh conceptions of Dizzy's old classics, it groooves! Ed Cherry takes a stunningly simplistic 12 bar blues solo, Michael Howell slaps and walks on Night in tunisia, Dizzy sings the blues and squeezes em out of his horn with the confident aplomb that's intrinsic to his nature as a master. My only complaint is that it is cut, as there is no drum solo. Apart from that, if you like latin, funk, soul and blues all rolled into one, this is the baaadass bag!",1086048000,4,544,4.45
