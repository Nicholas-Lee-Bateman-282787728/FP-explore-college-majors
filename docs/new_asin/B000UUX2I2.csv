2925250,1,B000UUX2I2,"I purchased this video for my class and after the movie was on for ten min. only 3 out of 27 students were still awake.  It is the most boring thing I have ever seen.  I have a student teacher and even he fell asleep during this movie.  They claim it is a must have for every classroom but if you waste your money on this video you are just plain stupid.  I wish someone had warned me about this prior to my purchase.  When the movie was over, the only thing that any student could remember was the fact that there was a duck clip that was shown 4 times.  Please do not spend your money on this video.  This is not a joke!",1205452800,17,622,3.928
2925251,2,B000UUX2I2,"I purchased this video for use in my Grade 9 Social Studies class. It had everything I needed in terms of the content, but the production value was bare-bone minimal. It sort of looks like a high school av club made it for their final project, though they would have received an A+ for their efforts. However, my 14 year-old students failed to see the value in a video that didn't contain the flash that they had become accustomed to.
I would recommend this video for a Grade 12 class or an introductory university history course, as younger children simply did not appreciate it.",1048550400,31,580,4.586538461538462

8214888,1,B000UUX2I2,What a crock.  How do you sleep at night.  I ordered it Sunday and did the two day shipping.  And the extra charge got me a Friday delivery.  Thanks a lot I guess my students really learned a lot about the subject matter on Thursday the day before it arrived.,1389484800,,259,4.12
8214889,4,B000UUX2I2,Basic DVD that covers the Industrial Revolution.  Good because you can fit it in during a period.  Content is fairly basic.,1355875200,,123,4.809523809523809

8214891,1,B000UUX2I2,"I recently previewed the Industrial Revolution video in hopes of showing it to my students.  When I started the video, I realized it was produced by the ""Just the Facts"" people, and that we had several videos from this series in our school library already.

Without exception, these videos are dry, dull, and of questionable production value.  If I showed this to my students, they would either fall asleep, hate me, or both.  I will never, ever purchase another title from this series again.  It is truly awful.",1297036800,,512,4.7727272727272725
8214892,1,B000UUX2I2,"Sound and video quality is very poor.  This video consists primarily of two professors sitting in their offices talking to an interviewer, and it looks like the video was edited and spliced with iMovie.  I was falling asleep after 5 minutes, and turned it off after 10.  There is no way that high school students would sit through it.

It's a shame, because I haven't found a better option for introducing the Industrial Revolution in Europe, but you would be much better off not subjecting your students to this one.",1259107200,2,517,4.711111111111111
8214893,1,B000UUX2I2,"I have a personal collection of over seventy historical documentaries, and I have to say this one was the absolute WORST one I had ever owned. I hated it so much I gave it away to a fellow student in one of my college history courses for FREE. The production value is so low that it was probably produced for less than one-hundred dollars, and only features a few historians none of whom are notable. The timeline in the documentary is also disjointed and may be confusing for individuals who are unsophisticated in the history of the industrial revolution. This documentary was so bad that I decided after watching it that the 'Just for Facts' series must have absolutely no professional standards for their documentaries and have vowed never to buy one again from this particular series of documentaries. Even my worst history channel documentary in my collection is exponentially better than this piece of crap. It should be noted that the few historians that are included do not even have a very efficient grasp on the industrial revolution, and are intellectually mediocre in their analysis of the various events they detail.",1256601600,6,1130,4.890625

I show this documentary every semester in my cultural geography class at a local community college and I find it is an excellent overview of the many economic and geographic factors behind the Industrial Revolution occurring in England.  It summarizes many points that I cover in my class and brings many concepts together regarding economic geography.  I highly recommend this product as an informative teaching tool.  Although it is classified in my public library as being for teens, I would suggest that its academic level is higher, and perhaps why another reviewer has rated it as uninteresting for his students who maybe were not yet ready for all that it had to offer.",1223942400,23,874,6.147540983606557
