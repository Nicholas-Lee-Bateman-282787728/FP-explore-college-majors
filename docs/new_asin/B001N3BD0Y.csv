Many valuable life lessons here! With an upbeat and intriguing story line, Dive Olly Dive is sure to keep the contented attention of children as young as 2 years old. The animation is amazing in and of itself, and the musical accompaniment just makes it all that more captivating. A Win-Win for all, indeed!",1240444800,5,485,4.586206896551724

This is a program I really love to watch with my children.  The DVD is really fun and entertaining, and I like that the episodes teach children important life lessons like sharing, telling the truth, etc.  Bonus-- the underlying message here is about taking care of the oceans.  Love that!
