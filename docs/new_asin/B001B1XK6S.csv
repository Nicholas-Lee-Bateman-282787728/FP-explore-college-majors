3479795,3,B001B1XK6S,"I bought this DVD after reading the reviews and not finding any thing else like this.  I also bought a body opponent bag (BOB) XL, so at $419 with shipping the $30 for this DVD wasn't so bad.  Bottom line, it's good, legitimate production, thank you Sammy for making a serious effort to cover many of these non-traditional techniques and training methods.  Specifically, the intro animations and special effects were a little long but most of the video editing work was smooth and helped to set the stage, they were just too long, and some were old and a little cheeky.  It felt like forever before the actual video would start, but once it did, the only other distraction was the audio which was poor at times, but not always.  Obviously wear a mic or use a directional mic when you are on camera and talking to the camera.  The dub-overs were good, and the comments salient to the action, lots of action, good stuff.  I liked the music, growing up with 80's metal helps, very suiting to this stuff, but in combination with the grim-reaper artwork, it's almost satanic... hey wait a minute.  The 'Razing' technique was merely an introduction and really just a plug for other DVD's, plus it was shown at slightly faster than real time, which heightens the effect, lessons the training value.  This isn't a 16 workouts video, this is a video of several training and technique ideas, several can be used in a repetitious manner or incorporated into a workout.  Ok, close enough, and after looking at your web-site and promotional stuff, I get it, you are out to make a living.  This material is just useful enough, and the fact that there are so few products like this I'm giving 3 stars and would recommend anyone with a BOB to buy it, how's that for a totally honest and unsolicited endorsement?",1239926400,37,1795,4.613207547169812
3479796,5,B001B1XK6S,"This DVD is great. Mr. Franco has come up with many unique and innovative workouts for this piece of equipment. He even shows you how fill, adjust, and move the bag. These workouts will enhance the skills of any martial artist or someone interested in REALITY BASED SELF DEFENSE.",1234569600,4,279,4.714285714285714
3479797,5,B001B1XK6S,"If you own a Body Opponent Bag, this DVD is going to make your investment in both the BOB bag and the DVD worth while.

As advertised on the cover, this DVD says, ""16 great workouts."" It should read: ""16, highly diverse, awesome workouts."" Each workout uses the bag in a way I would have never thought of to help simulate an actual opponent. Sammy Franco is highly innovative with his approach (I own several of his other DVDs) and this product continues to demonstrate that.

In addition to the workouts, the DVD walks you through filling, adjusting and moving the bag which I felt was a consideration to the viewer. Basic striking mechanics are also covered, but for the most part, Franco assumes you know how to punch. Very little ""filler"" here.

Another reviewer complained about production qualities. Mr. Franco clearly produced this video on his own dime with his own students to deliver a product at a better price. Frankly, I'm much more interested in the quality of the content than on professional audio. Anyone that is interested in learning will not be hindered by the video quality.

100% satisfied.",1234483200,14,1112,4.776041666666667
3479798,2,B001B1XK6S,"I would rate this DVD higher except for two things:
1.  Very low quality video and audio.  They are in a room and echo's aren't dealt with so it sounds like a video filmed by a kid in their garage.

2.  They felt the need to include vulgar cussing in the simulated fight scenarios.  Sure, that's the way it would likely sound but its not something I want to watch more than once.  Its just low class and unprofessional.  They could have taught the moves without the constant cussing.

The content of the video seems better than some other's I've seen but I threw it away after watching it one time.",1232928000,11,598,4.324324324324325
3479799,5,B001B1XK6S,If you own a body openant bag or are just insterested in purchasing one and you are not sure then get this DVD. I learned a lot of fighting techniques off of this video as well and feel I have benefited from the instruction provided.,1225411200,3,233,4.2
3479800,5,B001B1XK6S,Useful.  It helped me alternate my workouts between cardio and Self Defense training.  If you train then this will be a good addition to your workout.  Fast delivery and excellent transaction overall.,1451260800,,200,5.1875
3479801,4,B001B1XK6S,Enjoy all of Mr. Franco's products I have purchased.,1448582400,,52,4.888888888888889
3479802,1,B001B1XK6S,Not worth the money. Filled with generic moves and little discussion. Also DVD came scratched and skipped during play.,1446076800,2,118,5.2631578947368425
3479803,4,B001B1XK6S,"Very helpful and useful in training with my BOBXL

3479804,2,B001B1XK6S,"Not Much to it, more of an advertising for other videos from Franco",1432944000,6,67,4.230769230769231
3479805,2,B001B1XK6S,"The production is very amateurish and the sound is bad. All of the ""workouts"" are combined together on the DVD rather than being separated so you can jump to a particular one. Additionally, I found most of the techniques very basic. You could probably find something as good on YouTube for free. Definitely not worth $25.",1431820800,4,321,4.75
3479806,2,B001B1XK6S,Okay not what I expected,1428624000,2,24,4.0
3479807,5,B001B1XK6S,"Fast shipping, exactly as advertised.",1428105600,,37,6.6
3479808,5,B001B1XK6S,"As usual, Sammy Franco delivers the goods.  Good info on using BOB for power and when you don't have a training partner.  There were a few ideas that I did not think of and they will help.  For the street, this is a needed video to improve your training.  Glad I got it.",1415318400,,270,4.037735849056604
3479809,5,B001B1XK6S,"I never knew you could do so much with a Body Opponent Bag! Honestly, I was just expecting a video that showed basic care and maintenance, and how to strike the BOB. This DVD goes way beyond that. You learn how to use it to train with a knife, stick, striking, chokes, just about everything you can think of. The ""bystander intervention"" drills are especially brilliant. If you want your BOB to sit in the basement collecting dust, don't bother purchasing this. However, if you want to learn unique ways to train with it on a regular basis, buy this DVD!",1415232000,5,554,4.4950495049504955
3479810,5,B001B1XK6S,Sammy franco is a very good instructor. Easy to follow. Always buy for my partner who is a security guard and he raves about it. He wants the whole series!!! He found this particular DVD a really good workout as well,1415145600,,216,4.2926829268292686
3479811,4,B001B1XK6S,"Since my BOB is in my bedroom, next to the mook jong, I like using some of the routines when I wake up to get going in the morning. And there are plenty of routines fro having a good high cardio workout later in the day. As anyone who uses ""fast hands"" in their martial arts, this DVD may one day become a standard for their library.",1400198400,3,333,3.985074626865672
3479812,5,B001B1XK6S,"The Instruction manual for using BOB. Like an owner's manual that the manufacturer doesn't include. Essentially, How to get the most out of the BOB training tool. Efficient, Practical, and outside the box thinking on training and equipment usage. ESSENTIAL for owning the BOB!!!!",1399939200,2,279,5.363636363636363
3479813,2,B001B1XK6S,"wasn't too bad, just no scene selection and plays like a movie, more on technique than a proper workout I thought",1390953600,4,113,4.428571428571429
3479814,2,B001B1XK6S,Purchased this with the BOB for my 13 year old son who is an American Kenpo student. The language in it was pretty offensive in some parts. I could no longer let him use it. There probably needs to be a notice on this product so people would know. The content itself was not too bad.,1365984000,9,283,4.071428571428571
3479815,1,B001B1XK6S,"I don't know what they guy who gave this a good review were smoking but this is terrible!
The biggest negative is all the unecessary cursing that fills this dvd. I wanted a workout dvd not a wanna be gangster movie.
If I could give it zero stars I would. A regretable purchase for sure...",1363737600,11,288,4.254545454545455
3479816,5,B001B1XK6S,"I highly recommend Contemporary Fighting Arts as a place to order from if not from the website itself.[...] or at least through the amazon marketplace to order from, as Sammy Franco is one of the most skillful and talented Martial Artist on American soil. Highly proficient in his drills and well-respected by his peers and students. He is definitely top-notch when it comes to realistic fighting scenario's and his approach is phenomenal with this here video on the Body Opponent Bag training DVD. I have seen several videos on this subject, and the only other Combative's expert that comes even close to Sammy's dynamic approach is Lee Morrison's ""Impact Mannequin Training Drills"" which is a work of wonder by itself, found on his urbancombatives website [...] but don't count out Sammy Franco's highly recommended dvd. I've been working with the training dummy for several years now and I learned a boat load of info, drills, and workout regimens with what I thought I knew it all. Very highly regarded and this DVD has my personal favorite written all over it as far as heavy bag/training dummy workouts are concerned. Get this DVD if you have a training dummy or are thinking about buying one. It will change the way you think about solo training in a myriad of ways. On a scale from 1-10 (10 being ""The Best"") I rate this an 11 !! Get it, you won't regret it.",1358812800,7,1366,4.695833333333334
3479817,4,B001B1XK6S,"if you have a bob and your not a professional fighter this is a good dvd...it wasn't the kind of workout video i was expecting but it does give a few different ways to workout with the bob that i never really thought about...the audio isn't perfect but its not all that bad,..some of the scenes are pretty long but after watching it once i knew where to use the remote and fast forward to what i wanted.. all in all im happy with it",1354233600,,432,4.094117647058823
3479818,3,B001B1XK6S,"It's a ""think out side the box"" dvd. More of a set up for his other dvd's. You're not going to be a pro fighter after this, but all in all a good tool to add to your toolbox",1303344000,,173,3.4615384615384617
3479819,3,B001B1XK6S,this dvd is somewhat informative but seems to be more of a commercial for the other dvds in the series,1292284800,2,102,4.15

8281421,5,B001B1XK6S,"This training video by Sammy Franco is pretty good. It complements the book on the same topic and other materials produced by the same author. What I like about bout it most, that it gives you ideas of using BOB for situation scenarios. You start slow and work your way to speed reaction.
