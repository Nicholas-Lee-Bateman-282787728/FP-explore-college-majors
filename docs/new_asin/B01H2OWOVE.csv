7775777,2,B01H2OWOVE,"The film opens showing us a haunted house, Ouija Board, and a killing. It then shift to moody Sara going camping with her boyfriend. She hasn't forgiven her dad as she believes ""mistake define who we are."" She applies that belief to the Ouija ghost/killer (Denise Hernandez) who attaches herself to Sara (Tara Shayne). This irks the ""thin skin"" spirit who forces Sara to kill or else.

The movie uses whispers, shadows and dreams to create terror. People die, but we are spared seeing any horrific killings, i.e. no need for special effects, just get actors who can play dead. This is a ""me-too"" low budget Ouija Board film. Listed as ""You Will Kill"" at IMDB. Tara Shayne's character as a snippy teen was not well developed.

7775781,1,B01H2OWOVE,"What a mess.  Was there a point to that?

Random girl is randomly haunted by a random ghost because someone used a ouija board? Throw in some pointless, random deaths and random jump scares.  There you have it.

Life is short.  You'll never get this time back.  Skip it.",1505260800,,270,4.408163265306122

7775783,2,B01H2OWOVE,"Oh god, there only scary thing in this movie is how badly the main actress is at acting.  The movie does an okay-ish job at a few scares, but parts of the script/acting are just laughably bad.  If I had to listen to her whine one more time about regrets or be inexplicably angry at people, I'd have done something *I* would regret.  I swear to god by the end of the movie I was rooting for the evil spirit to just end her quickly.  And it never stops hitting you over the head with the stupid moral about forgiving people's mistakes.

Maybe the director was preemptively asking forgiveness for making this movie.",1499299200,,612,4.380530973451328
7775784,4,B01H2OWOVE,"I did like the movie. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either.  I don't understand the reviews that say the acting is bad. I thought most of the acting was awesome (especially for a 'horror' movie!) .  About that:  I'm not sure it should be classified a horror movie. It has aspects of horror, sure, but it's more like a scary drama than a horror flick.",1497225600,,360,4.343283582089552

7775790,5,B01H2OWOVE,okay so i don't really give it that but sooooooooo many people are call this much worse that it is.  It gets a little slow at times but is still good.  I don't scare easily at all and i jumped a few times.  I watch horror day in and day out.  It has good quality photography.  Great acting I would watch any other movie by any of them.  MY guess is the negative review are because of the twist at the end and was actually what i was hoping would happen.  In conclusion would really give it about 3 and a half to 4 stars.  It's better then alot of the prime available i watch the entire thing.  I can't say as much for may others,1488326400,,628,3.9206349206349205
7775801,1,B01H2OWOVE,"Might as well be called ""Hey Folks, Kids are Stupid!""

The whole premise begins with three kids going out on a campout who makes a random house stop because the third wheel had to take a piss. They end up walking into a house covered in crime tape (REALLY?) not to mention, the main girl touches the door and all, yeah that'll go over well with CSI. Then their dopey third wheel friend finds a Ouija board. I didn't bother watching the rest. I kind of skipped ahead and it falls into the whole ""My house is haunted now, let's call in an exorcist"" trope. The camera shots aren't bad but the acting is atrocious.",1488153600,,610,4.304347826086956

I have seen 3 different Ouija movies now and they all have the same story line: Young adults use a Ouija board-a spirit comes out-and starts killing them 1 by 1. What happened in this Ouija movie was completely different-not the typical Ouija movie story line-which I found really refreshing. You have to be a little patient in the beginning, the suspense is slow to start. But if you can get past the first 20 min. the movie is great!

7775953,5,B01H2OWOVE,"While one reviewer asked where WAS the connection between the two families, they obviously weren't paying attention. The best friend grabbed the Ouija board from the first family's home and brought it with him on the camping trip, the same board later used by the main character's during the camping trip, there's your link. The performances were well acted, the suspense, twists, and paranormal haunting was believable (after all, it's a movie), and I thought it deserved a great rating. I will definitely be watching this one again.",1477267200,7,534,5.079545454545454

7775963,5,B01H2OWOVE,"Compared to some other movies on Amazon lately with all the fake reviews I believe this deserves better ratings (5 stars to boost the total). The acting wasn't horrible or cheesy, and the effects were actually pretty spooky in my opinion...Nana was flipping awesome. Even though it was a little ""been there done that"" plot-wise, that's most horror flicks these days. It's hard to watch a horror flick and actually expect to be scared anymore (I feel like I've seen em all).  I think because of this, it's really hard to figure out what's worth it on Amazon. This one was NOT a waste of time-in my opinion. It was a little dark on the tablet visually, and that was the worst of it. Bravo",1476144000,5,686,4.488
