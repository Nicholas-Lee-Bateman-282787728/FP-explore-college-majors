2555476,5,B000F9SO0O,"One of my favorite family comedy-dramas. I like being able to watch it on my Kindle thought I also have the DVD. Tyler Perry addresses serious issues of domestic and child abuse, foster care, elder care and drug addiction while keeping the pace going and the mood light.  Some people may think that wealthy suburban families don't have problems but they do!

In my opinion it fails to be any of these precisely because it tries to be so many of these.  A mixture of good and bad acting, awful continuity, and stilted plot made this unenjoyable.  Mr. Perry's moral message,  however, reflects a genuinely good heart, and I commend him for his stance on such matters.",1463875200,,457,4.457831325301205

Madea and Joe take in a white family to provide them a safe haven from the mafia.  Madea has to use her charm on the obnoxious ungrateful teen daughter but she doesn't get physical with this brat, she uses her smarts.  Warning!  Eat before you watch this movie because when Madea makes breakfast your mouth will be watering!  Tyler Perry is a genius at using a lovable coarse strong woman to teach others that God is in charge, and to never give up, be strong.  Thank God for Mr. Perry and thank Mr. Perry for using his God given talent!
The outtakes at the end of the movie are hilarious so don't quit watching!",1419897600,,694,4.267175572519084

2555868,5,B000F9SO0O,"My third attempt at trying to like a Tyler Perry film. Although Madea goes to Jail was my first and Diary of a Mad Black Woman was my second, this had a better plot than both. I expected Madea to be more violent in this but there was no need for it (she did become a little violent); Madea's threats were strong enough. I felt the moral was unconditional love and respect. Madea turns around Nikki, a troubled teen due to foster care. Madea's nieces, Lisa and Vanessa are both having trouble with love, with candid confrontations with their mother (and a little advice from Madea), they are able to move on. There is a moving speech given by Myrtle (Cicely Tyson) near the end.",1391644800,,677,4.424

2555915,4,B000F9SO0O,"Tyler Perry is very interesting to me. I don't hate him or anything, but seems like every one of his movies, including Madea has to have random sub-plot drama. This one is probably one of my favorites because abusive relationships intrigue me, and Perry has captured it very well.  Lisa is engaged to the very abusive and controlling Carlos, while her half sister Vanessa is dating a guy who wants to love her but she keeps pushing him away because of her traumatic childhood. Meanwhile, Madea is getting ready for her big family reunion and must deal with a troubled disrespectful teen named Nikki.

2555946,5,B000F9SO0O,"FIRST, to the good stuff...
Tyler Perry really wrote a great one here! This is a sequel to Madea's Diary of a Mad Black Woman, but strangely--like the movie before it--can stand on its own. It picks up sometime after the first one(maybe a few months, maybe a few years). Madea[Tyler Perry in drag] is forced by Judge Mablean(TV divorce judge) to be foster mom to this troubled young girl(Keke Palmer) who simply has no one to look up to. Madea is your ideal old school black mother of the world--which means she is the best thing for you as long as you don't cross her! She lives with her brother, wisecracking Grandpa Joe(who gets on everyone's nerves; is a selfish malcontent; and is just plain nasty). She quickly gets the girl in line with her own infectious brand of tough love along with having to keep Joe in line, too(Joe would really take some effort if not for Madea's SPECIAL tactics). If you watched the first one, then you know that there's at least one other family member to which all other family members are satellites to. This movie has Madea and 2 stepsisters in Madea's family with everyone else revolving around them somehow. Now, Madea's home is once again a home for family ""runaways"" so to speak. This time, it's the rejected 1 of the 2 grown sisters--staying with her. The older sister[mother of 2] catches the eye of Boris Kodjoe[(city bus driver)(father of 1)]. She plays hard to get at first--maybe indicating that she doesn't trust men. She eventually warms to his overtures, as he's funny and they have a lot in common. Now, the other sister is ""Cinderella"" to her mother(Lynn Whitfield). She has pampered this sister her whole life and now--that's she grown--she's still at it! Whitfield[Victoria] and her daughter's fiancee(Blair Underwood) have this typical ambivalent relationship. She wants her to follow in her footsteps--marry rich. Like Whitfield's own marriage before(alluded to and not shown), the man is a serious problem for the woman! Blair Underwood(Carlos) is abusive and controlling to a weak minded woman who has always had the red carpet laid out for her. Her older stepsister(both have the same mother--Victoria) is much stronger bc she wasn't special(her daddy wasn't valued as much--not rich). Whitfield even sacrificed the older daughter to the rich husband in order to keep him(child molester)!

Enough drama so far. So far, Joe and Madea clash and Madea and Palmer clash and the older sister and mother clash and the younger sister and her fiancee clash and sexual abuse(not shown) and Joe cracks on or is nasty with everyone that he comes across! Phew! There's still the wedding day, family reunion, and the younger sister transmutes into the older stronger sister--with some help from Madea and the family. These three events take you to the end. I can't say any more without spoiling it and I've left some important parts out(as they aren't needed to tell the story), so I'll bid you adieu!

 Let me get to the problems which make it 4.5 star rating: Drag queen(absolutely can't stand it if they are dating a dude--which did not happen in this movie). Fart scene with Papa Joe, Madea, and Kodjoe: When someone ""CUTS CHEESE"" and it stinks really bad, It gets on you. He's going out on a date; can you say problem?! She came out and didn't smell anything in the house or on him either. The part where she gets really IRATE about Kodjoe taking her kids out while she was sleeping; she's supposed to be mad; she was NOT supposed to make an excuse for him in the end(I'm not saying it isn't something that they couldn't get passed, but so soon; your children are more precious than anything besides a spouse on this earth; her problem mother Victoria let him off the hook with only a scolding; she should have stuck firm and kept to her point that he made a mistake; for all she knew, he could have been a child molester like her stepfather. This kind of thing really takes time and he should understand that--if he loved her). There is also a part before the wedding that is just not common sense, bc if there's no blinding or ""worse""(there is almost always retribution--won't spoil it) These things are minor for the most part.",1368057600,,4181,4.7168262653898765

with trying to prepare the next generation to what and how important family structure
is, it also defines what and how important a family is, and how they always need to
remember to be there for each other, through the good times as well as the bad; I hear
that the new generation coming up now is referred to as the disconnected generation
but that does not have to be as long as they are willing to put forth the effort to connect
but the bible tells us that there arose another another generation that knew not God, but
this generation still has a chance to change the outcome of their situation., and their circumstance.",1355270400,,711,4.476923076923077

If they don't, all they will accomplish is ruining relationships with their children.  This way, they will feel severely isolated and miserable.  Madea's scenes made me laugh hysterically!  If you are a Madea fan, this film is a ""must have"" to add to your ""Tyler Perry"" collections.  I also loved Maya Angelou's role in this film.  When people are about to get married, it is important for people to ask the bride and groom to be if they are ready to make that life time commitment.  The film teaches that too.

2555994,4,B000F9SO0O,"Some of the negative reviews complain about the paradox and seemingly incoherent messages in the film - after all, abuse is seen coming from both the heroes (eg. Madea) and villains (eg. Carlos) in this movie.  I can understand how one might get the impression that abuse is being condoned in certain contexts, although I'm not sure that Tyler Perry means to condone it so much as just share what he knows, to show what goes on in real life, and try to balance it with enough comedy that we can bear to hear about the tragic aspects of it.  I think Tyler does well to shed light on it all.  While his subsequent films show more subtlety as a writer and director, I can't help but love his earlier, raw, ""unrefined"" work just as much as his more recent, ""polished"" gems like ""The Family that Preys"".

Some great quotes from the making of ""Madea's Family Reunion"" featurette on the DVD:

""A world that most people hide.  The abuses, the childhood horrors that a lot of us have.  The molestations.  He's putting it all out, and I honor him for that.""
--Jennifer Lewis who plays Milay, the wedding planner in the film

""Everybody has dysfunction in their family.  We are the family that created dysfunction.  We put the ""dis"" and the ""funk"" in dysfunction.""
--Tyler Perry as Madea

And that about sums it up in a nutshell why I appreciate this film.  Oh, and Maya Angelou and Cicely Tyson, they will both completely blow you out of the water.",1330473600,3,1438,4.505791505791506

The acting is good, the characters are believable (well, apart from Boris Kodjoe- I mean please- who would turn that down!)and the story-lines are great. I especially enjoy the way the mother-daughter interractions between the main characters play out in the film. I watch this when I need something funny but at the same time deep and uplifting. This movie covers quite a lot and at the center of it is Madea who is funny as hell. After awhile you forget it's Tyler Perry in drag- the character is so good. It takes on a whole life of its own-funny and outrageous, yet real and down to earth somehow- with a lot of wisdom to offer. Some serious themes are touched upon and at the heart of it is a great moral (for everyone). The only problem with this movie is that I want to reach into the television screen and knock Blair Underwood's character out. LOL. Oh, and Lyn Whitfield's too.

Instead of going to jail, Madea takes in a young girl with an attitude towards everyone, but you find out later that the girl has been in and out of foster homes, due to a doped up mother who is in prison and a dead father, and no one believed in her.  With Madea's good discipline tactics and a good heart, the girl makes a complete turn around.  Meanwhile, an engaged woman gets abused by her fiance, but she can't get out of it because her money hungry mother still believes she's going her daughter some good.  How wrong is she!

The new Blu Ray transfers are HORRIBLE.  I have over 400 Blu Rays at this point and other than Madea's Big Happy Family (which looks great on Blu) all the other ones released are probably the worst transfers that I have yet to see.
Diary of a Mad Black Woman, Madea's Family Reunion and Madea Goes To Jail all look like the DVD but worse.  The DVDs were artifact free but somehow the Blu Ray versions look like they are 30 years old!  No fine detail, the colors are soft and muted (almost blurry) and there's noise all over the place.  Seriously the DVDs look better.
Unless these are below $5 each I would not suggest anyone upgrade.

Good messages thru out on how we should love and treat each other respectfully and not get caught up in material things and money, because having money and power doesnt make you a human being. Judging people only on the surface and not for the inside will only reap bad benefits. I love the message Tyler portrayed that no matter what negative and sad things that may have happened to us, ex.(Vanessa and foster childs) situation, we can still overcome and have hope and true love in the future. The key is to never give up on life, and good, positive, people that love and operate from the heart. The music is great and fits what a family should be about. Highly recommend this movie. Again, Love Madea. Shes teaching when faced with adversity, stand up and fight for yourself and not allow yourself to be controlled and beaten down like a rag doll.

2556011,5,B000F9SO0O,"I had rented these movies and loved them so much I purchased them for my DVD library.  Perry's movies portray life as it is, the harsh reality of life, the need for a family who loves and supports you, and most importantly the need to forgive, not for the sake of the one who needs to be forgiven, but for the well-being and subsequent freedom one receives by forgiving.  The Madea character provides comic relief; she's irreverent, but she also has a heart of love for those in need.

2556013,3,B000F9SO0O,"No comments below are for racist purposes, only honest observation.

I'm comparing this to his other work Diary of a Mad Black Woman and Madea Goes To Jail.

This movie has the same formula as the other movies:

1. Black people = majority. White people never serve a major role in this guy's movie, the best they can be is the background actors. This is NOT a racist comment, this is the truthful observation, anyone that watches Tyler's movies, especially those listed above, should have seen it a mile away. I'd go into more details, but meh....I know this movie is situated in Atlanta and the majority are black, however, in his movies you can clearly see white people in the background so you can't possibly justify his racially VERY unbalance group of actors.

2. Has Madea (only in this movie, she appears a lot less often and has weaker lines and actions).

3. The teaching of moral value, he likes making movies that speak out to the black community, but should appeal partially as well to everyone else.

4. Usually has relationship or domestic issues like being abused or whatnot.

5. Fairytale ending or good ending. Sorry, but because he's using real life situations, he should not fool people into thinking that everything works out great in the end with everyone singing and smiling and the world is working itself out. Tell that to my life. Real life situations do NOT always end great and does not always end up with you being with some sort of hottie/stud that is perfect in every way. Also, many of the people in this movie, especially the lead actors, are unrealistically good looking. I just don't understand why someone so concentrated with real life situation portray real life in such a fabcriated and exaggerated manner. This goes for most of his movies.

Sorry to say, but this movie is nowhere NEAR as good as the two movies I listed above. Madea, as said, appears less often. The humor isn't as fun, even the drama is not as well built because you really start to notice that he's starting to use the same formula, it is almost a mimic. He's starting to lose his credibility as a writer in my personal opinion. I felt this way about this movie because it's the third one I've watched after the other two. It works in this formula:

FORMULA:
1. Girl has problem with guy.
2. Then comes the perfect black man that not only looks perfect, but acts perfect (how unrealistic? So what...you have to look good in order to be good to a woman? A perfect gentleman does NOT have to look like a stud...that's one negative to Tyler Perry's movies, he hits in a realistic mark but his characters and the way they're fabricated is unrealistic to the majority of the population)
3. Then she tries to work it out and in the end you get a moral teaching of some sort and everything works out like some sort of fairytale.

In this movie, it's a bit different from that formula, but watch those two other movies first than watch this one. You'll see that I mean. He lost a lot of credibility in my book.

Tyler Perry, if you're reading this... (LMAO Yeah right...), your movies are great! They're so good I actually made my mom watch it and she loved it, which is rare. But please change your formula and the way you write your movies. You do not have to stick with the same stuff over and over.

Maybe make a movie where the guy is the one that is abused first or the person that rescues her is not some stud. If it takes a stud to rescue a woman, then 99.9% of the women out there are doomed. Ethnicity balance is bad in his movies, please don't even try to justify this. Also, include Madea more. She lightens up the movie and makes it much more enjoyable to watch.

As always, acting in this movie is fantastic. The script just feels a bit uninspired and not as strong this time around.",1258243200,,3798,4.463203463203463

My favorite part of the movie is the first part when she asks the girl to stop popping her chewing gum.  Outrageously funny.  I wished I had a Madea in my life.

The movie itself is good too, and everything works out in the end.  The characters, with the exception of Lisa, aren't as fleshed out or genuine as the rest of Mr. Perry's characters, but then he makes the big bucks and I am writing this review for free.

The good:

1:""Madea"" is HILARIOUS and steals every scene ""she"" is in...(other than the one where she beats the foster kid with the belt)

2:Boris Kadjoe is one tall drink of water, nuff said.

The not-so-good:
1: The scalding grits/frying pan ""payback"" scene felt really weird and wrong. (and did anybody pick up on the use of the Al Green song right at that moment? Wasn't Al Green actually involved in a horrible scalding grits incident in real life?) Just weird.

2:Why are there no gay characters, don't most families have gay members? It's really shameful that with his huge following and power that Tyler can't go there and at least throw in a few supporting gay characters and maybe educate a few people.(inasmuch as this kind of film can) And isn't Tyler gay to begin with?

3:Unbelievably melodramatic. The ""drama"" part of the movie was like one big overdone episode of Young and the Restless. I know 1000 people that love it but I just think it's way overdone.

4: The ""angels"" hanging above during the wedding scene. Enough said. (kind of goes with # 3 really)

Yes I know people are passionate about any and every thing Tyler, and hey good for ya'll keep on keepin on. I think if they would up the Madea quotient and lower the cheezy drama, it would be a lot better. Peace.",1237680000,,1463,4.473684210526316

2556042,3,B000F9SO0O,"I have seen all of Tyler Perry's films, not including ""Meet the Browns"", and I have to say this is possibly my least favorite. I simply did not think much of it; it wasn't exciting, there was too little of Madea, the storyline of the mother letting her new husband rape her child with a different man was fairly impossible to believe (though I admit not completely impossible) as was the mother's personality (I find it hard to believe someone is THAT evil-hearted). I like Tyler Perry and I like his films. This one was not a bad film as I do not regret the time I spent watching it, in other words, it was entertaining enough. Just the sweet bus driver who is ""really a good man"" and the evil husband/fiancee was done already in ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"". I guess while there is quite a bit to enjoy about this film (mostly Madea and Uncle Jim), it just doesn't feel fresh enough. But perhaps what I really expected was a pure comedy from Tyler Perry, and what I got was yet another morality play.

Nonetheless, Perry fans will enjoy this film. Like all of Perry's films, the music was superb. And like other reviewers have mentioned the ""Grits and Al Green"" scene was so perfect! If your interested in any other Perry film, I have reviewed/discussed them all except ""Daddy's Little Girls"" (which happens to be my favorite), just click on my ""Real Name"" and look for the films.

I merely thought it would  give me a few laughs, as I needed them at the time.  Well, dear ones, hold on to your hat, hearts and kleenex as this film and this MAN are so much more!  Madea's Family Reunion is ""dramady"" (drama/comedy) and both styles are perfectly joined together in this film! The acting, comedy and drama are first rate! Not to mention the varied and important lessons it imparts to everyone! The closing scenes of the family reunion are powerful and poignant with the brilliant Cicely Tyson teaching the family of today, what they've seemed to have lost unless the new generation of family doesn't learn to have more respect and love for each other.

2556067,4,B000F9SO0O,"Friends had been telling me about *Madea's Family Reunion.  I guess from the previews, it just didn't seem interesting to me.  However, I came across and thought, why not.  It is pretty funny despite the fact that the movie focused more on Madea's troubled nieces and their love lives rather than on Madea.

To avoid jail time for removing an electronic ankle monitoring device, Madea is ordered to foster a young runaway girl.  Madea and this young girl are hilarious.  The girl has an awful attitude which is really a wall surrounding her fears.  However, Madea is having none of it and she isn't afraid to use the belt.

Madea's two nieces are having love troubles.  One of them has 2 young children and basically has been scarred from ever falling in love again.  However, the driver on the public bus that she rides frequently finds her attractive and wants to ask her out.  The other niece is engaged to one of the city's most eligible bachelor (Underwood).  The problem is that this bachelor is physically abusive.  She wants to leave the relationship but her conniving mother pressures her to stay and suffer.  Meanwhile, both nieces have emotional issues with their mother.

While the movie is hilarious, there's a serious side as well...dealing with domestic violence, accountability, marriage.  At the family reunions, the elders (Angelou & Tyson) address the family to wake up and start caring for one another.

I thought that *Madea's Family Reunion* had some good laughs.  There were a couple of dry spells, making you wish that the movie would hurry up.  However, there's enough drama to maintain your attention span.",1186876800,3,1632,4.890510948905109
2556068,5,B000F9SO0O,"When I rented ""Madea"" I expected something along the lines of Big Mama's house. There were definitely comedic moments with that type of humor, but I was pleasantly surprised at the more serious moments in this movie. It deals with one of Madea's nieces being abused by her fiance, a foster child in need of guidance and discipline, and a commentary on the degradation of black society.

The part I enjoyed the most was at the end of the family reunion, where Maya Angelo criticized all the young people for acting like the portrayal of ""cool black culture"" (gambling, sexually explicit, bad language, lack of education, etc etc).

I ended up laughing quite a bit because I saw some of my family members personal flavor in this. The ""old style"" of discipline and child rearing included a few smacks and stern lectures. Oh Madea, I feel like you were at my family reunions.... There was some gross humor (fart jokes) which I never have liked and doubt I ever will; but they weren't so prominent that  it detracted from the movie a lot.

2556075,1,B000F9SO0O,"A friend selected this movie to watch last night, and - I must say - I'm blown away.  I have absolutely never seen a worse movie in my life.  Glancing over some of the comments below, I see that a lot of Amazon reviewers apparently enjoyed this film.  This truly baffles me.  Could we really have watched the same movie?

To begin with, MADEA'S FAMILY REUNION has a lipid, melodramatic script, and most of the cast can be faulted with serious over-acting.  Unfortunately, these are the least of this film's problems.

I would say that MADEA'S FAMILY REUNION's major fault is that it doesn't know what kind of movie it wants to be.  Scenes with Madea (a violent, sharp-tongued old lady, played by actor Tyler Perry),  seem to strive for comedy (although I would emphasize the word ""strive""), while scenes involving a pair of sisters - one emotionally scarred from years of sexual abuse and the other dealing with a physically abusive fianc - strike an infinitely more serious note.  Is this movie another Black-man-in-a-dress comedy, or is it a Hallmark special?

There are also instances of more specific internal confusion.  For example, moments after the film asks us to have sympathy for the sister who is hit by her fianc, it asks us to laugh as Madea beats up on her new foster child.  Since when is beating a young girl into submission funny?  Another example: just after the other sister reveals that her stepfather repeatedly raped her as a child, we find ourselves at the big ""family reunion,"" where a table full of lecherous old men drool over the rear-end of one of their teenage relatives.  I guess I don't get it.  Does this movie think that incest is tragic or hilarious?

On top of these major failings, the movie was clearly very carelessly made.  Here are just 2 examples: watch the scene between the sexually abused sister and her bus driver-boyfriend, just after he takes their children out for ice cream.  It cuts back and forth between closeups of her face and his.  When we are looking at his face, he's got his hand along the side of her face.  When we look at her face, his hand is under her chin ... bad editing!  Here's another example of the movie's lack of thought: just before the wedding at the end of the film, the physically abused sister has big curly hair.  Moments later, when the ceremony actually begins, her hair has miraculously been straightened and styled.  I'm not a beautician, but I do know that straightening curly hair is no easy process.  Although these details are really insignificant, I think they're indicative of the lack of care or forethought that was put into this mess of a film.

While I would love to see more movies that are dominated by an African American cast, I think there is something to be said for quality.  I found MADEA'S FAMILY REUNION to be *offensively* bad.  If you don't agree with me, I really have to wonder if you've ever actually seen a good movie or know how to recognize one.  If you're looking for a film with a predominantly Black cast, watch a Spike Lee movie - I recommend DO THE RIGHT THING.  Do you want a great comedy?  Try LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE.  Do you want to see men in dresses?  Watch SOME LIKE IT HOT.  You've got to trust me: it gets so much better than this.",1169596800,21,3252,4.55

2556101,3,B000F9SO0O,"I think it was at least 10 minutes in to this movie before it started to feel at all like a comedy.  Other reviewers described it well; it jerks between intense drama and low-brow comedy.  For example, I think there there was an abrubt transition from a scene where Carlos threatens & slaps Lisa to a scene featuring fart jokes; it had the emotional effect of trivializing the abuse or making the humor seem cold-hearted or both, not what I would think Perry wanted to achieve.  Things like this just gave the whole movie a somewhat ""B-movie"" feel.

Still & all, there was a surprisingly strong connection for me, largely because it wrestles with a lot of psychological archetypes and issues that are common in black culture, and probably in low income communities in general.  The psychological scars of abuse & drugs; the dilemna of staying or leaving an abusive relationship when you have no income; ambivalence about success & money; absentee parents; school bullies; disrepectful & delinquent teens; fear of intimacy; tough old survivors with jaundiced attitudes or spiritual strength or both.  Perry plays out these very serious themes, but includes enough comedy so that, at the end, you come away not weighed down, but with optimism and faith that, in spite of all the difficulties, the human spirit will find a way to bloom.

Overall, a movie with definite, obvious flaws that still works because of 1) great performances, and 2) compelling themes that strongly resonate with its target audience of black Americans.",1166313600,2,1524,4.952941176470588

Who promotes this as being funny? That is a sad situation which unfortunately happens to lots of kids, and as a teacher and former camp counselor, I have unfortunately had direct contact with many children who have been abused in a similar way.

2556123,3,B000F9SO0O,"Last year Tyler Perry found himself thrust into the limelight with ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman."" I was curious (who wasn't), but the thrashing it took at the hands of the critics kept me away. This year he's back delivering more box office gold with ""Madea's Family Reunion,"" and this one I couldn't resist. It just seemed too unique. This film, formerly a play, written by our most successful black playwright, involves the writer/director dressing in drag and taking the crazed black woman stereotype to the mountain top. For the most part the film does fairly well for itself. It examines class and violence in our society, just not terribly well. But a great comic performance by Perry as Madea nearly saves the film.

The story involves two sisters. One is in a great relationship that is only tempered by the fact that he is a bus driver. The other is on the verge of marrying a rich, handsome man with a real knack for smacking her around (and not in the good way). Meanwhile, their out to lunch aunt Madea spends her time trading insults with her husband and raising a foster child. Like far too many films aimed at black audiences these days (""Something New,"" ""Trois"") there is a heavy emphasis on wealth. Lisa is told to suck up the beatings, presumably because her husband to be is rich. Madea cheerleads her foster child when she tells her that she wants to be a lawyer, and we all know the only sexy thing about law is the cash it can make you. Ultimately, the film comes down against the gold diggers, but still enjoys swimming in materialism. A ridiculously lavish wedding fills the screen for the last ten minutes of the film, but since it's for the non-greedy characters Perry thinks he can have his wedding cake and eat it too. The ending is what sunk ""Madea's Family Reunion"" for me. Its portrayal of extreme happiness and shameless showiness had me gagging.

The other main problem I had was with its muddled philosophy on violence. The entire film is a collision course between Madea's ""good"" violence and Carlos' ""bad"" violence. The problem lies in an early scene where Madea beats her foster child for not going to school. By having the hero engage in the behavior without any repercussions (other than the scene of ""Good Times"" in the background which shows the negative side of parental violence) means that the film is endorsing it. Of course there is such a thing as good violence as seen when the wife beater gets his comeuppance. But the fact that the film fails to distinguish between hitting a little girl and hitting a wife beater is to its detriment. There are some very good things happening here though. The humor comes class free and you'll laugh because of it. Uncle Joe gets some darn funny lines in that contribute to a very funny script. Also, the fact that Perry has a past in theater shows. His scenes are given time to develop and he has no use for CGI or stunts. I wasn't riveted, but I was entertained. If you can get past the philosophical hypocrisy and lack of character development then you'll love this film, unfortunately I could not. **3/4",1157500800,4,3090,4.606170598911071

2556125,3,B000F9SO0O,"By the trailers, you'd think that this movie is more like ""Big Mamma's House"" than a drama about black families identities and love. There are some great actors (Cicily Tyson for one) but the dialog felt forced at some points. Although one character gets abused by another; Medea makes no bones about whoopin' peoples BEHINDS throughout the movie. It's about respect of women (as shown in one storyline) and then at the reunion, men sit around and make a girl grab a beer from the bottom of a barrel to show her butt better. Mixed messages, you bet.

The movie is much more about love and is definately a ""Chick Flick"" in one way...but with a lot of fart jokes thrown in.

Maybe this works much better as a stage play. I'm not sure.",1156550400,13,732,4.455223880597015
2556126,3,B000F9SO0O,"It would've been a way better movie if there was more Madea, her name is in the title of the movie and after the meat of the story was dropped, out of nowhere the family reunion comes up at the end. No where in the movie did you see her get it together and she only talked about it once or twice. And some of the actors were unutilized and had the wrong roles. Let me start with Jennifer Lewis; the character was too much for a role that small and if she had the role of the mother than the movie could've been more enjoyable. Not to say Ms. Lynn Whitfield didn't do it justice but it was a bit weak here and there. Some of Madea's jokes were below what I expected and the whole grit performance between the pretty girl and Blair Underwood didn't compare to what Kim Elise did to her husband in the last movie. It looked more like a parody and less entertaining than say the limousine scene in ""What's love got to do with it"".

The movie was okay, could've been more heavier than the last movie and the performances were alright but the scenes were too brief to grasp. So the girl got beaten but it was very brief, Lisa Arrindell was pretty good but it was less than I expected. There was not enough fire in the movie or enough passion.

However, I found it disturbing when Madea started beating the girl with a belt. There is no situation when a child should be beat. Also the hot grits in the face was more disturbing than funny.

2556166,2,B000F9SO0O,"Ok. I am a fan of Diary of a Mad Black Woman- it is one of my favorite movies. Maybe that's why I am so dissapointed by Family Reunion. It is done very poorly, there is no connectivity between the scenes, jumping from an attempted murder scene *Carlos informs his fiance that if he can't have her no one will and tries to launch her off the apartment patio* to a light-hearted scene. This movie does not flow. Tyler Perry seems to have tried to tackle a movie that includes too many stories that don't really come together.

This movie does make it clear beating a woman isn't right, but by throwing hot grits in the perpertrators face a beating him with a frying pan is ok gives the wrong message, as does Madea beating her foster daughter for lying. It says abuse is ok in certain situations- he should have stuck with one or the other- by doing both he sends a unsettling message.

Also, the acting and dialouge was terrible. Really. The few good lines were butchered because of the added dramatics. I know the message was for black men to own up and be responsible and for black women to treat themselves with more respect- which is fine... but it also could be construed as all young black men and women are lacking in morals by portraying them as gamblers and stripper-esk dancers. I think this scene could have been done in a far more tasteful manner.

The message is good but the acting and script are too over the top for me to even think about taking this movie seriously. Save your time and money and just stick with Diary of a Mad Black Woman.",1153612800,6,1555,4.373702422145329

The story this time around is about a woman in a bad relationship.  She is being abused by her husband and although it is VERY hard to watch at times, as they say, revenge is sweet.  The acting is not bad, the cast is likable for the most part, and the story seems solid.

2556183,4,B000F9SO0O,"Tyler Perry covers all the bases in this film that deals with various topics that are serious,but there is always the humor spin. Tyler Perry is the Baddest Black Film-Maker going today. nobody is doing the things that he is doing. you will be cracking up, nodding your head about the Belt&the directness in this film. this film will take you back with certain things that go down.",1151798400,,381,4.617647058823529

2556185,5,B000F9SO0O,"Like ""Madea's"" other work, this movie is a welcome voice about issues and people who are not always heard from. It has everything from pun to drama, from slapstick to pathos.

The psychological study found in the characters provides a look at a lot of real and varied people, all the while having great fun with stereotypes, and offering a wonderful reminder that no group of people, and no person, is simple and monolithic. The depth and detail of the people and their stories make for a heartwarming movie. Some bits of language and innuendo may be a problem for children, but since these references are often heard in the children's schools, at least older children my even benefit from hearing them in a different and higher context.",1151712000,3,737,4.7578125
2556186,5,B000F9SO0O,"I read a couple of the reviews and laughed when the one guy said he sat in the DARK...'NUFF SAID' This is comedy which is if anyone really understands true comedy , is based on reality. Of course this is over the top but this is how the plays were as well, if you bothered to watch them. In any event I thought the story telling in this movie surpassed Diary of a Mad Black Woman, I go to the movies to laugh and be entertained when it's comedy, and that is what this movie did!!! As for your million dollar movie idea about the ""BLACK EXPERIENCE"" When you turn into a black man then you can share it with me, Until then NO THANKS!",1151539200,18,631,4.056
