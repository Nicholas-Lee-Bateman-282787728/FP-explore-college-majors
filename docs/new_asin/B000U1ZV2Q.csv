3715022,1,B000U1ZV2Q,"The cover art of this DVD totally mislead this reviewer.  The girl on the cover is not in this movie. Then, on the back of the cover it states ambiguously that a New York City high price call girl and model makes her movie debut and it makes one think it's the girl on the cover (She's even on the cover art on the disc itself!). Finally,  the film itself is a grade-B semi-erotic thriller about an ill-fated mnage  trois set in a ski cabin and the viewer will be waiting for that girl on the cover to show up and it never happens. Overall, a waste of time.",1207267200,12,557,4.091743119266055

8325758,1,B000U1ZV2Q,"I kept wondering what this film had to do with the DVD cover and apparently nothing. Franklin (Chris Ferry) and Bridget (Natalia McLennan) decide to get away for the weekend. Their car gets stuck in the snow, something that takes days to get out for some reason. A French caretaker (Marc Forget) shows up as Franklin cleans his clock. As it turns out Bridgette not only prefers French cuisine to American, but has no trouble eating it in front of her husband, something he later on apologizes for ""over reacting.""

I was like WTF the whole film. Nothing too hard to figure out.

He or his cinematographer must seen' Tryst' in order to get some of story line and detail on how to shot his film The' Antichrist'. Because' Tryst' is somewhat similar except for Religious symbol and high quality of film work..",1385424000,,293,4.764705882352941
