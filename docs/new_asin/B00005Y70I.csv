8168342,4,B00005Y70I,"Fueled by a pumping soundtrack ususally reserved for a bigger budget flick this quirky sci-fi/horror/comedy shot using several styles is worth a look for its pure entertainment value. The more I watch it, the more I begin picking up lines that stick with me and my friends. The plot begins innocently enough but mid-way in you really want to see where it's going and where it does go you'd never expect. It's also great how the characters are actually developed so that you actually care what happens to them. Also the accompanying behind the scenes mocumentary is totally worth the price of the DVD itself. A must have not only for cult fans, but anyone up for good gory action and fun. When's the sequel??",1027123200,3,707,4.664
