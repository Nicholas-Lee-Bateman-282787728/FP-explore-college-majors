4216207,5,B003XDJEKS,"Ultimately it's a film about God's provision despite human limitations.  The cast is surprising in their diversity and the story is very well written.  No, it's not an evangelistic film.  Yes, it presents a positive message that would be easily enjoyed by both Christian and secular audiences.  My entire family enjoyed the film.",1341964800,3,329,5.150943396226415
4216208,3,B003XDJEKS,"James White (David A.R. White) works for a mega church in California under the rock-star preacher Johnny Kingman (Ray Wise). After making a few mistakes, James and his family is sent to an impoverished church in Atlanta that doesn't take to the mega-church way of preaching and wants something more personal. Logan White plays the wife, Lily White (ouch). Louisiana born Disney star Anna Margaret (not Brittany) plays the daughter Emma. The over grown Victoria Jackson has a small role as her career skids along the rocks.

The all black church (there I said it) in Atlanta has financial problem as the bank manager (Rif Hutton with pointy ears) dressed in the evil colors of red and black will foreclose on the church to make room to build government subsidized housing, which is considered worse than building a liquor store. In order to save the church, White must pull out all the stops and reach out to people shunned by the community, to put together a benefit concert to save the church. Okay, not the most original plot out there. Delsey (NRaca) plays the secretary with a soft squeaky voice that was funny in ""Police Academy."" Senyo Amoaku plays EZ-8 the local street hustler with a secret. The always likeable Reginald VelJohnson is the church deacon.

The film ends as expected. The Christian theme is light, that God sometimes speaks to us in whispers. The film feels like it is a mega-church production, the same thing that it is being critical about.

Family Friendly.",1339891200,6,1482,4.826771653543307

4216210,2,B003XDJEKS,"Having seen many of David White's movies and enjoyed them, I wanted to support Pure Flix in their attempt to get edifying, clean movies into Wal Mart.  So I bought this movie and was glad I reviewed it before sitting my family in front of it.  If you're a shallow Christian, it's fine, shallow entertainment.  But the portrayal of the evangelist is one of a prosperity-theology evangelist, which is an issue unto itself.  The associate pastor - White - as his understudy actually aspires to his worldly - totally gospel repelling lifestyle and brings that influence to a church that is genuinely needy.  He brings them good works and a nice moralism with no anchor.  Meaning - in the entire movie, you don't see anyone helped by Jesus or the gospel or Biblical truth, but rather it's all about being your best self and what you think of yourself, etc., etc, ad nauseum.  Waste of a hard earned ten dollars and I'm really sad to see this being touted as Christian when all it is is what the world provides anyway with a more family-friendly rating. It made a mockery out of Christianity. There is no LIFE in this movie. You walk away with NOTHING. Were I not already a Christian, I would not want to be after viewing this movie.  Hard words but needing to be said.",1337817600,43,1263,4.508771929824562
4216212,1,B003XDJEKS,I bought this movie for my husbands birthday. We were disappointed on how the church is being protrayed. We were hopping the guy would realize that the church he was going should not be glamourous and own nice vehicles and actually show a true walk with God. Plus it just wasn't that great a movie.,1493683200,,298,4.4363636363636365

4216216,2,B003XDJEKS,"It just was not what we expect in a Christian movie.  Too worldly.  When a Pastor's wife entices a Christian woman to dress more like the world to be noticed by the men in the church, that is not Christlike behavior.",1484697600,3,216,4.2439024390243905

4216249,4,B003XDJEKS,"We have enjoyed Brother White.  The humor begins when Brother White's wife is named Lily.  So LilyWhite accompanied her husband to pastor an all-black church.  Lots of humor, but ending with Brother White showing what a true pastor is by his kindness and attention to the people in need, even those not within his church group.  We have watched it several times for a relaxing, entertaining and challenging evening.",1438041600,3,415,4.971014492753623
4216250,3,B003XDJEKS,"I'm writing this to give people something to think about. I've read a few reviews about this movie here on amazon, slamming this movie. Some say it doesn't have scripture in it, others that it doesn't talk about Christ and his redemption. Are these things true? Yes and no. But the movie is more than just the feel-good false-witness prosperity gospel they make it out to be. In fact it portrays the Mega-Church, and the members at the church in a very pejorative light, very much so. When the Pastor gets up doing the ""Holy-Spirit"" act, its painting t.v. and charismatics in a very pejorative light, just after he's mimicking the Mega-Church. Its does so subtly and in the fore-front with multiple follow ups, first being a woman in the congregation say God help us, another person gets up and leaves, then later the the deacon afterwards says to him in brotherly advice, stop speaking at them, but with them, meaning he has no love of Christ, nor love for others, directing rebuking the Mega-Church and Charismatics.

Some other points, the wife's father buys the children gifts when they go over to his house, with disapproval of both parents, and which to me may have a subtle indication he doesn't spend time with them, but wins their heart, while the children don't have a good relationship with the father, because he doesn't spend time, showing a stark contrast between love(agape), and love(eros)/lust or emotional love, and how true love can't be bought, yet greedy people, and self-indulgent people give money, so they don't have to give themselves, no self-sacrifice. The Mega-Church preaches the glory and epitome of the ""self"" as everything, giving you the image of him being a motivational speaker and swindler, rather than a man of God, after he just talked about how much wealth he has, this is confirmed later with other statements by people, and the deacon, and ultimately the premise of the movie; the pastor moves into a poor neighborhood, treats people fairly, and through fighting for what's right on accident, ends up learning what's right, on the purpose of God. Pastor White is wanting more and more material wealth and power, but his wife says, Christ doesn't care what car you drive, but what's on your heart, also just right after the Mega-Church pastor's Ferrari drives away. The previous pastor takes a bribe from the bank to move to Hawaii, but when offered the same bribe, Pastor White turns it down, and replies with, ""What the price for man's soul these days?"" He invites a criminal over for dinner, treating him the same as everyone else, James 2. He makes a comment that wherever Christ asks him to go, he goes, no matter where, what, how, anything, he just obeys. He treats the mission he personally wants, of the needs of his family, and most of his daughter, and his wife rebukes him, as does his daughter by finally wanting to run away after he constantly won't listen to her. The Mega-Church pastor multiple times comments on the ""zeal"" pastor white has, but for what? At the end a child is singing about the love of Christ while the criminal is listening in another room, later when she sings Christ is watching over me, he comes out singing the same, implying he's turned his life over to Christ. At the end he and his family is going to return to L.A. after the assistant to the Mega-Church reveals he only made Pastor White move to the church to get him out of their hair, showing how shallow, insincere, unloving, the church really is at which point he says to his family and church they're moving back to L.A. The Deacon comes up, and tells a story about poor fisherman, and a rich business man -Google it if you don't know it-, combine that with the fullness, happiness, and love of Christ, and you'll get the picture. He then recognizes the place God has filled him to be, and the voice of God speaking to him through the people around him -not at the Mega-Church-, and the child who sang the night before, saying she spoke by the holy spirit, talking about E-zee that converted, and realizes he wants to stay, confirming the original premise set by the contrast of his life, and the life of the Mega-Church, and how devoid of God and Christ they are, and its this subtlety the movie is based on.

Is it a Christian movie, yes and no. If a self-reflective person watched this, as I have, the hints, and the subtlety would not be lost on that person. If a non-self-reflective person watched this, would they be completely lost, and miss everything, yes, absolutely as the other reviews show. Did the producers, directors, and writers miss that aspect to this movie, yes. Did they miss a chance to speak the grace and truth of Jesus Christ who is the one and only messiah, yes. Did they miss a chance to show that all life is found in Christ, including all things that matter, yes and no. Do all movies need to contain these messages, yes to a minimum degree. A Christian's first priority when interacting with the unconverted is to use the gospel, and the grace and truth of Christ through his blood to reach anyone and everyone, but it should also to speak to the unbelieving, those that have heard the truth but chose not to accept it, to ask the right questions, and connect with the person, to show them the beauty and grace, and truth of Jesus Christ. But lastly, ours words should always be an upliftment to other brothers and sisters in Christ, and help to pick them up when they're down, to encourage them, to support them, to rebuke them, correct them, teach them, love them, care for them, endure for them, and commit ourselves physically, mentality, and spiritually to Christ, and in doing so to his will, whether that may be in all three areas. This movie really only targets the last category, and does so, that it doesn't help everyone in that category, nor in all parts, but at the same time it would help some I imagine, and you can't measure righteousness, salvation, or anything good of God, for whether its in part or many, all is good, all is great, all is perfect. What this movie needs most though in large, or in part, I think is connecting with the audience, connecting to people. If the producers, directors, or writers knew how people think, react, live their life, and what they truly need in life, they would be better suited to fill that need. They nailed it in God's Not Dead, its truth, conviction, bravery, courage, wisdom, faith, hope, and the greatest of these love, for Christ first, which then Christ's love comes out through the person, not the person themselves. This movie had a chance to do the same.",1437091200,3,6589,4.6259607173356105

4216253,1,B003XDJEKS,"I totally agree.  The movie was a huge disappointment.  Just because a movie is about a pastor and a church does not make it Christian.  Christ crucified, forgiveness of sins, eternal life are never mentioned.  Cults do a better job of cloaking the Gospel in Christian terminology than this blatantly ""feel good about yourself"", ""believe in yourself"" movie does.  Anyone who thinks that this is a Christian movie needs to open their eyes. Reading Galatians 1:8 wouldn't hurt either.  The movie is anti-Christian.",1432857600,,512,5.108433734939759

The church is supposed to be an Apostolic church but apparently the writers have no clue what an apostolic Church is or how they dress. Apostolic churches are Holiness churches. Apostolic women wear long dresses. They do not dress like the church women in the movie who wore jeans, sleeveless dresses and halter dresses.
