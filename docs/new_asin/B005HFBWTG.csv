8472930,5,B005HFBWTG,"Great DVD, information thorough.  Highly recommend it.  Tells you all about the life of Rembrandt, museums showing work, good coverage of his work and  discussion of some important works;  shows restoration work as it is being done to several paintings, carefully goes through each step;  and, a bonus -  shows what is involved in the etching process.  A valuable DVD to have.",1361491200,6,376,4.967741935483871
8472931,2,B005HFBWTG,"I didn't finish ""...The Master"" because it was so-o boring, thus the title R.E.M. I am not sure if it was because of the production or just Rembrandt's biography in itself. He made a great deal of money, lived above his means and went broke. His first wife had died, and he later 're-coupled'. However, he wouldn't marry his mistress as he had committment issues: He didn't want to share his money. Ahhh...no inspiration there. Further, the man painted too many self-portraits to keep me awake. This is in great contrast to the story of Michelangelo, who was truly ""Divine"".",1350518400,,574,4.75
