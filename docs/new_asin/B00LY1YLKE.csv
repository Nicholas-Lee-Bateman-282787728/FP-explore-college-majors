6510227,4,B00LY1YLKE,"This film has been getting a lot of hate from critics. However, I decided to write my first review to somewhat defend this comedy. I'm a huge fan of the original. I watched it religiously growing up and pop it in on occasion. The soundtrack was always a huge part for me as well as the humor, of course. Upfront, the sequel is nowhere the comedy gold the first was. It's less memorable, less funny, slightly more ridiculous. (CGI feathers, glowing from radiation.) However, as much as I recognize these flaws, it felt good and satisfying to see Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey back in these roles. Is it perfect? No. The movie felt forced at times, and again, comparatively, more ridiculous than the slightly more grounded original, but I'd be lying if I didn't laugh and enjoy seeing these two get into absurd situations. The nostalgic nods felt great too. The music that harkens back to the original and a decent soundtrack in the film itself also is a plus. I will buy it as soon is it's out on blu-ray. Overall I think it fits in decently next to the original. It won't be remembered as fondly, but after seeing the first so many times, it's nice to see them again in a different environment.",1416355200,4,1192,4.497695852534562
6510228,5,B00LY1YLKE,20 yrs in the making & well worth the wait!!! Absolutely loved the 2nd part . Went to see it the past opening weekend & Loved it :),1416355200,7,131,3.7142857142857144
6510229,5,B00LY1YLKE,"Let's get something straight right from the start. This movie isn't as funny as the original. HOWEVER, had the original never existed, this would set the standard! Let's just say, for sake of argument....the ORIGINAL D&D is a 10/10. I'd rank this around a 8-8.5. I literally found myself gasping for breath during some of the scenes (the stinking beer comes to mind).

The story is quite simple (and I'm sure from the commercials you already know). After 20 years, Harry and Lloyd reunite and discover a postcard (postmarked 19 years earlier) from Harry's former girlfriend, Fraida Felcher (Kathleen Turner). She explains she was pregnant and wanted him to know. However, after seeking her out, they find that she gave up the child for adoption. Once Lloyd sees a picture of Harry's (now grown) daughter, he makes it his quest to track her down.

Hilarity ensues and to be honest, I don't want to ruin any of it for you. Basically, it's the sequel we've all been waiting for! You're going to see scenes that are obvious replications from the original and some new scenes that will make you laugh. It's almost as if they took the funny scenes from the original and tried to ""modernize"" them. I don't say that in a bad way. As many times as I've seen the original (and it's got to be a couple hundred times, LITERALLY), I still found everything funny!

Final Verdict: WATCH THIS MOVIE, BUY THIS MOVIE, LAUGH ENDLESS AT THIS MOVIE!",1416355200,9,1428,4.681274900398407
6510230,3,B00LY1YLKE,"I would think that anyone reading this or seeing Dumb and Dumber To (D&DT), or thinking of seeing it, has seen and enjoyed Dumb and Dumber (D&D). If you haven't, I would first recommend crawling out from under the rock you've been living for 20 years, and then checking it out. If you thought that movie was just okay, at best, then D&DT might not be for you. If you, like me, LOVED  D&D and have seen it countless times and laugh hysterically each time at the stupid humor and potty jokes, then you'll probably enjoy D&DT.

This movie picks up about 20 years after the original. Harry and Lloyd are recently reunited and Harry discovers a very old post card from Fraida Felcher telling Harry that she's pregnant. Harry and Lloyd go visit Fraida, who tells them that she had to give her daughter up for adoption, but has always regretted it. Harry and Lloyd then go on a road trip to track down Harry's daughter. Harry can't wait to meet his daughter, while Lloyd has the hots for her and can't wait to date her.

This movie was very reminiscent of Dumb and Dumber and wasn't too original or cutting-edge.. It's very familiar, but still enjoyable, if you're a big fan of the first. I enjoyed this movie because I think D&D is so hilarious. It was great catching up with Harry and Lloyd, and they haven't changed much, including many of their jokes and antics.  In fact, it seemed that many jokes were ones that were pulled straight from the first movie. I laughed for nostalgia's sake, remembering how great the first movie is. There were humorous parts in this movie, but I have to admit that most of the funny parts were funny because they were some of the best jokes from the first movie, done again for this one.

This movie reminded me a bit of of Hangover 2 in the sense that, when I saw that movie, I was constantly reminded of the first Hangover and how much I had enjoyed that movie. To me, Hangover 2 (and then 3) was stale and recycled many of the funniest parts from the first Hangover. I would be lying if I said that D&DT isn't like that. The difference is that D&D came out 20 years ago, so I was wanting to see Harry and Lloyd again and excited to be watching a new movie, which made me appreciative of the parts that reminded me of the first movie. The similarities reminded me of how much I loved D&D. I also enjoyed seeing Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels again. They seem to really get along and have a great friendship and chemistry in real life that translates to the movie, and it seemed like they were really having fun with this movie, that made it more enjoyable to me.

Overall, not the best comedy of the year.
However, for the sake of nostalgia, I really liked it and laughed a lot throughout it.",1416268800,21,2720,4.355029585798817

You rent this movie because it is all about the original characters, nothing more.  Don't expect something other than the original.

There are some mildly amusing gags along the way in this one, but it pales in comparison to the first one which is one of the all time great comedies.

6510432,3,B00LY1YLKE,"After twenty long years, Harry and Lloyd are back AND... most people didn't care. Despite the success of the first film, the Farrelly's waited far too long to bring the pair back. Everyone who grew up watching the first film are adults now, and the demographic they were going for with a PG-13 rating, has no idea who Harry and Lloyd are, hence the disappointing numbers at the box office. In this long awaited sequel, Harry (Jeff Daniels) is in need of a kidney and finds out that his only living relative is a daughter he never knew about. That's all it take to get Harry and Lloyd back on the road for more antics AND... they tried too hard. The original film was legitimately laugh out loud funny, while it's sequel may lead to a snicker or two. The beauty of the original is that it was so simple and so stupid that you couldn't help but laugh. The new one is full of long running pranks, modern slang the pair don't understand, and just obvious jokes. There's absolutely no spontaneity, like when Harry chucks the salt over his shoulder or Lloyd puts laxative in Harry's tea. That's not the only issue here, as the bad guys are kind of the biggest joke in the movie and Lloyd finally crosses the line from cute to creepy. The bottom line, I loved seeing Carrey and Daniels together again and I enjoyed the parallels to the first film, but aside from a few misunderstandings and a line here or there, this film isn't even close to being the film fans waited twenty years to see.",1454284800,5,1483,4.416058394160584

Carey was so bothersomely crude and desperate I just couldn't take it anymore. J. Daniels would gear the plot with a bit of care but then Carey pops in and does something cringe-worthy. He's the annoying kid in class who gets on your nerves.  This started from the very first scene and quickly became tedious.  Maybe down the road I'll give it another shot but I won't hold my breath. In the original the duo's highjinx were accidents, like the Police Academy movies. Here they seem to be acting like mean fools on purpose which takes away the humor and rooting aspect.

It works because its insane.

The first time I sat through this I was trying to compare it to the first movie too much and although I thought it was still funny and overall a good followup it didn't impress me as much until I watched it a second and then even more so with a third time on demand later on. Its really grown on me much like the original after multiple viewings and I think too many of these reviews are people that watched it once and just dismissed it as mediocre next to the original.

6510599,5,B00LY1YLKE,"I'm surprised how much I love Dumb and Dumber To!  No it's probably not as good as the first one, but then again I mostly forget what the first one's like since it's been so many years since I last watched it.

Jeff Daniels (who's 60 years old by the way so it's hilarious he's portraying a younger guy) and Jim Carrey (who's gotta be the funniest comedian I've seen in years and returns to his golden years of nonstop goofiness!) are both so incredibly dumb that you can't help but find them charming.  This movie has all the charm of a 90's-style comedy which is a nice blast from the past for me.  Yes the style of comedy is *extremely* far-fetched (fart jokes, exploding birds, bush pushing pranks and several means of stupidity all over the place!) but the quickness of the joke delivery by both Jim and Jeff's characters just had me on the floor laughing.  I had trouble keeping up and will need to watch the movie again at a later time.

The storyline, as unusual as THIS is to say, is surprisingly strong.  There's a couple major twists along the way but unfortunately if I spoil one twist I'll end up spoiling the ending.  Not that storytelling is this movies main strength by any means.  No way!  I'll just say it turns out Jeff's character needs a kidney transplant, so they go in search of Jeff's family (specifically his daughter played by the adorable Rachel Melvin).  Seriously the writing in the first half is nonstop hilarity as the two embark on a mission around town and later around the country on silly road trips to discover Jeff's relatives.  The communication with Kathleen Turner's character is probably the funniest writing in the movie,  She used to um, like the bedroom a lot when she was younger!

Turns out Jim has a thing for Jeff's daughter and constantly finds himself fantasizing about her.  Fantasizing in a way only Jim can, lol.  Meanwhile the two have to deliver an important package to a convention that reveals world changing technology (exactly where two dummies *shouldn't* be of course!)  and of course since the event is so important, Jim Carrey in particular doesn't take it remotely seriously (like in the scene where he leaves the package on top of the car as they're heading down the road, or constantly disrupting the presentation).  Without spoiling too much, the daughter turns out to be just as clueless as Jim and Jeff, and her adopted parents have a really evil scheme brewing that I can't reveal because I'd end up explaining the whole movie.  Let's just say they play the bad guys pretty well (at least the mother played by Laurie Holdin does).

Again the storyline is really strong with a couple twists, but the overwhelming amounts of stupidity and in particular Jim Carrey's character being so unbelievably goofy make this one 5 stars for me.  Depending how you feel about relentlessly silly humor, you may or may not like this film.  I however, LOVED it!  Expect silliness at such a high level that it's extremely hard to keep up with at times.",1440288000,,3004,4.637051039697543

I bought the sequel entirely based on my love for the original only to be disappointed.  I do not know what it was specifically or not, possibly just my own maturation, but I did not laugh once in the entire movie.  I consistently said to myself ""they are trying to hard to be funny"" unlike the first one in which it was just funny.  I also did not feel like there was any carry over from the first movie.  In that I mean, this movie was built around essentially Harry and Loyd playing out stupid gags on each other over entirely long period of time with what turns out to be stupid consequences.

6510693,2,B00LY1YLKE,"While the original Dumb and Dumber was no great work of art, it still managed to be charming and entertaining with plenty of great laughs to keep you interested. After an abysmal prequel, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are back as Lloyd and Harry, two of the dumbest humans to ever walk the earth, and it seems that they've only dimmed with age.

It's probably more proper to say that Dumb And Dumber To is less of a comedy and more of a tedious slog, as I found myself not laughing for a majority of the movie. This film's jokes fall flat, insult your intelligence, bank on nostalgia, or get a small chuckle out of you. It doesn't help that Jim Carrey's Lloyd is such a detestable jerk in this film. While the first film painted him as more naive to the feelings of others, yet generally well intentioned, here he's more akin to a narcissistic sociopath. Manipulating everyone around him to get what he wants, and what he wants is beyond creepy as he wishes to bed Harry's illegitimate daughter (and then later fears that she is in fact his daughter just to add to the creepiness of it all).

Contrast this to Daniels as Harry, who practically carries the film with a sense of warmth and, dare I say... a bit of intelligence??? Of course, the film wants you to care about Harry, who needs a kidney transplant to save his life, thus leading him to seek out his long lost daughter to convince her to help him. Sure, Harry will get into the same trouble as Lloyd, but while Lloyd does it because he's trying to stroke his own overblown ego, Harry does it because he really doesn't know any better, and I found most of the comedy coming from his mishaps rather than Lloyd's.

Aside from some great jokes involving full body camouflage suits, the film can be best summed up with one scene where Harry and Lloyd rediscover their iconic dog van, only for it to fall to pieces after five minutes. It's nostalgic, but far too old and will inevitably end in disappointment.",1437436800,,1961,4.456824512534819

I thought this movie was just about as funny as the original!
Some of these reviews are saying the humor is mean spirited -I guess that's not at all surprising since the world we live in today has become so kooky and ultra sensitive and politically correct.
I saw nothing at all mean spirited-just real dumb and funny!(these guys are too dumb to even know what mean spirited is!)
We clearly have lost our sense of humor that's for sure-not a day goes by that somebody (or some group)is not getting offended by something or someone -it's become COMPLETELY INSANE!!!!!
This is a really dumb movie about really dumb guys doing dumb things...
THATS IT!NOTHING MORE!!
Kind of like the old airplane and naked gun movies-just lots of laughs.
Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were awesome-picking up right where they left off as if no time has gone by at all. That is not easy-most of the time when movies try to pick up where they left off years later it doesn't work right-this time it does.
 The story,gags and situations are all still funny and yes-
Harry and Lloyd may have gotten EVEN DUMBER !!
If you liked the first one and you love these characters you will have a lot of fun with this movie.
It's just great to see Harry and Lloyd back again!

Well, even with our low expectations, we were shocked at how awful it was. Jim carrey was overacting and the jokes sucked. We tried desperately to soldier on to finish the movie but could only make it 17 minutes in before turning it off. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy.",1435968000,,449,4.487804878048781

One thing I did not like was the old ladies' diamond scene.  It was absurdly crude but yet it added nothing to the funniness quotient of the movie.  I think this movie stands on its own as a very funny movie but I'd recommend viewing the original first to fully appreciate this one.  The original D&D is one of my all-time favorite comedies but the sequel also makes my favorites list but just not up as high on the list.  WARNING: This type humor is definitely not for everyone (i.e. - my wife hates this type of humor...actually, most women I know don't get this type of stuff).  This is also not suitable for children.  I would only recommend this movie to people that appreciate Jim Carrey style humor.  The title should tell you everything you need to know about whether you'll like this movie or not.

Jeff Daniels was released from the island of obscurity for the reunion of the same tired jokes they cracked in the 90s.
  Basic plot ,
  Well crud I can't really remember I stroked out halfway through this as a way to save my sanity. Save your money and just go get a sub at subway for $5. The entire movie was a bad fart joke and a pile of recycled jokes. I really wish I hadn't ponied up the 4 bucks for this.",1435449600,2,578,4.0

Sure, there are some funny scenes, but the movie just doesn't have enough quality comedic material to maintain any level of consistency. I could be a bit more forgiving if this movie was intended to be watched completely independently of the original, but it clearly wasn't. Dumb and Dumber To makes far too many references to the original for it to render the original unnecessary, but the movie doesn't go far enough in attempting to reward you for recognizing these references. Also, you know that something's wrong when half of the footage and stills used in the end credits are from the original movie. Oddly, the end credit sequence even seems to attempt to show you the similarities between the two movies by displaying scenes from each movie simultaneously, almost as if they're trying to make you appreciate the similarities.

Tame and sluggish are putting it nicely when talking about this ""comedy.""

You cannot make silly faces and expect the audience to laugh.  You cannot write a stupid plot that no one in their right mind would care about, and then just HOPE these two guys do funny things.

You want funny?  Check out Joe Rogan's stand up, especially his recent Rocky Mountain High.  Check out the first Dumb and Dumber.  Check out Reno 911.  Check out Inside Amy Schumer.

6511338,1,B00LY1YLKE,"This movie broke my heart. I feel a little silly typing that. But as entertainment goes, the first D&D'r is my favorite movie of all time. So this one really hurt. As other 'firsts' go, the second/sequel is usually not that good. This takes the cake though.

 Imagine a batter has a good game and hits a homerun. Now imagine he takes a break from the game and then decides to come back twenty years later. Upon stepping up to the plate, he tries to hit a grand-slam every time at bat (though the bases aren't even loaded). Sadly the batter fails miserably. He tips a few, yes, but ultimately strikes out every time.

 If that analogy was bad, this movie is worse. Seriously.  I know its easy to ""play from the stands,"" but seriously. It was like someone had a fourth grader write the script or there was a deadline of two hours. The potential for making this better than the first was there. The acting was great, cinematography was excellent, it's the script. My forehead was crinkled above my nose for most of the movie. You know the ""wft"" face?

6511635,1,B00LY1YLKE,"I grew up watching ""Dumb and Dumber."" I still watch it from time to time and laugh at all the same jokes. An absolute classic!

I was actually excited for ""Dumb and Dumber To"" to hit theaters 20 years after the original. The trailer looked funny and I thought the opening scene was a good continuation and explanation to where Harry and Lloyd have been, the last 20 years. Everything else fell short. To be quite honest it was painful. I thought Jim Carrey did a great job of reprising his role as Lloyd and reminded me of the original and seemed natural for him. Jeff Daniels (who was amazing in the first film) seemed like he had to try much harder. Maybe that's because Jeff doesn't do comedies?

It was so painful to watch, I ended up turning it off before finishing. Maybe one day when I'm bored and have nothing else to watch I'll give it another shot.",1428796800,,858,4.35625

1. The characters seem ""dumber"", like the old Harry and Loyd seemed to have a slightly higher intelligence than these new characters.
2. They made Loyd a complete idiot by making him fall in love with Harry's daughter.
3. Harry's daughter is stupid as well.
4. They kill off the first bad guy in a matter of minutes and left the movie feeling empty, unlike the original in which they acted it out better.
5. Harry's flashback drew the line, I mean come on, I know it is a Dumb and Dumber film but when Harry smeared Peanut butter on his privates then called in the family dog to clean up, that is where I lost hope for this movie. Well, what little I had left.

It seemed to me they just threw the story together with open plot holes and decided to end it with the whole point of the movie to be false. At least they accomplished something in the original movie. They returned the briefcase and had an awesome time. (despite some setbacks)
I just hoped for too much I suppose, I don't think I'm going to re-watch it anytime soon. But the original? Give me three minutes to make popcorn and I'll be ready to hit the couch. Anyone want to join me?",1428278400,,1356,4.211538461538462

That's how exciting and funny this move was. It put me to sleep and I remotely didn't want it playing in the background. My unconscious self didn't even find it funny.
I met Jim Carrey when he was still going by James and doing stand-up, and I watched his career blossom. Lately, the movies he's been working on just haven't lived up to what he's capable of doing... and this is an example of another bad movie he's made the choice to do. I wish he'd pick movies like Bruce Almighty, Liar Liar, Eternal Sunshine,Yes Man and even the Number 23.
Dumb and Dumber 2 should have never been made, and Jeff Daniels- just never slapstick funny. I wish he'd stick with Squid/Whale, Gods and Generals, Pleasentville type of movies.
I hope they don't decide to make a 3rd movie in this series.  Both are good actors, but no more buddy movie. Please.",1427760000,,985,4.353260869565218

If you enjoyed the first movie, I suggest watching the second as well, but do not go in with super high expectations. Like I said earlier, Dumb and Dumber is a classic and is hard to out do. Maybe rent it first to make sure you will like it. I didn't pay full price for the Blu-ray / DVD combo (around $10) and I feel like that is a fair price.

Based on the reviews here, I thought it would just be the usual Hollywood con job, ripping-off fans of the original with a throwaway movie. Instead, the script and casting were excellent (especially the girl), and everyone threw themselves into their roles. Some reviewers have complained that there are few fresh ideas, but that wasn't the goal. People watching a sequel want to repeat the pleasure of the original. If the Farrelly brothers had fresh concepts, they would make a whole new movie. Following the original formula was the right call, and they did it well. Maybe it was due to my low expectations, but my wife and I laughed like crazy throughout the movie.",1426896000,,714,4.766129032258065

I think it's very funny at times and also a little funny a times but if you're looking for it to be better than the first you're crazy. The first one was funny because it was original and no one had ever done the stuff Jim did in it. So to expect this one to be better is nuts. This is a hilarious movie only if you have a sense of humor, if not you'll rate it low and say it wasn't good enough knowing that no one else  has made a better comedy than this in a long time.

If your a fan of the original like me, you'll probably watch it regardless of what anyone says. If you're on the fence, you'll find better entertainment somewhere else.

I kept hoping it would get better as the story droned on. Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels were wasted talent. The story line, acting and directing were all below tolerable.  Crude ""potty humor"" in the original was paced and placed effectively. In this mess it was just thrown like a monkey tossing poo at someone in a zoo.

The fact that Daniels and Carrey could convincingly pull this reunion off after so many years is amazing. Also amazing is to see Daniels again in such contrast to his more recent work  The Newsroom, The Answer Man, Purple Rose of Cairo etc. He is truly a gifted, genre-spanning actor. Bravo!

On a technical note, I also have to give huge credit to whoever designed the final credit roll. Why? Because it doesn't roll. All credits are displayed in static frames so that one can actually read without trouble who did what in the film (either in live mode or freeze-frame).

6513106,5,B00LY1YLKE,"The reason people are disappointed with this movie is because ""its not like the original"". Well think about another successful comedy movie that had a sequel: Airplane!

Airplane is considered by some to be the funniest movie of all time. It was so successful that they decided to make a sequel and what did the writers do? They used the same humor as the first. Now the general reaction was ""Its the same jokes as the first, there was barely anything new"".
 ""Airplane: the sequel"" was okay, but it didn't do as well as its prequel. Did the Farrelly Brothers want this to happen to dumb and dumber?

No.

Yes Dumb and Dumber To does have a few jokes from the first, but not enough to just recycle the entire movie.
If they used the same jokes, the same basic story, and the same setting as before; people would complain that its too similar like the first and that Carrey and Daniels did it for the cash. So what did they do?

They changed it. They changed it to get praise from critics and people complain that its not like this first. YOU CANT WIN

Personally I thought that this was equal to, if not, better than the first. It was hilarious! A few parts are pretty hilarious and I assure you that this is not a clunk of a movie. The sad thing is, people from this generation don't have a sense of humor like previous generations. You can tell a joke to someone and they will respond with ""What?.....I don't get it"", but if you call someone a ""sack of d--ks""  they will laugh. Most people don't get the jokes in this movie, it has to be dumbed down (No Pun intended....or should I say, Punintentional ). No one will ever get comedies from the past unless you grow up with classic comedy. I grew up watching the three stooges every Saturday and my favorite movies are airplane, and animal house. Other kids like family guy or trip tank as their ""comedy shows"" although I do not have anything against these shows, I do have to say that they don't deliver to me like the classics.

I can see where some of the criticism came from: This is definitely not the same movie and I don't think that the chemistry between Carey or Daniels started off well at the beginning, which I think was by design.  It's been 20 years or so since the original, so what do you expect?  However, after about the first 15 minutes, Harry and Lloyd were back to their usual antics full-steam including some moments that were painfully funny.  This is your typical Dumb and Dumber movie, it is full of bathroom humor, low brow humor, jokes that are just painful and gross at times, but overall, very entertaining.

I couldn't have given it 1 star because I love the original too much to do that!  The jokes were just bad.  Really bad.  However, I stuck with it and things eventually got better.  The second half of the movie is tolerable.  The entire movie is ok.  Would I recommend watching it?  Probably, yes, just because you're curios.  You probably should watch it and check it off your list.  Is it a good movie?  No.  Will you be able to make it though the entire movie?  Possibly.

6513860,1,B00LY1YLKE,"I saw the original film when I was about 11 years old, and it was one of the funniest things I had ever seen. I watched it many times later in life and still enjoyed every moment. That film had the Farrelly brothers on top of their game, there was no one else making silly comedies like that, but the film wasn't only successful for being silly, it also had two lovably moronic characters who you cared about. Unfortunately, that feeling is anything but brought back when watching Dumb and Dumber To, nothing Loyd and Harry does fits their characters from the first film, it all feels forced and the bottom line is that it's pretty much never funny. Please believe me when I say that this has nothing to do with me seeing the film 21 years after the first film because the first film still has genuinely funny parts. Dumb and Dumber To...I chuckled lightly ONCE at a joke involving their old vehicle...the 2 second joke basically infused a bit of reality into the situation and I felt like that was the tone they should have gone with to make this work. This movie tries so hard to make you laugh, and honestly the only way you could find this funny is if you watch stuff like Here Comes Honey Boo Boo in which case you are part of the problem why garbage sells. In fact, there is even a cameo from Honey Boo Boo's Mom in this movie...no joke. There's unnecessarily gross parts involving Loyd sticking his hand inside an old lady's vagina, then pulling it and blowing off the dust...OH MAN COMEDIC GENIUS! That might have worked in a Me Myself and Irene sequel, but not here...I'm not some annoying politically correct guy who wants to nerf the world, but anyone saying this movie is terrible is NOT lying and anyone who says it's actually pretty good either is lying or has the absolute WORST taste in films and probably owns every Larry the Cable Guy dvd.",1424995200,,1857,4.448680351906158

Just like the movie,  even the reviews on the movie have the same plot. Unoriginal, uninspired. Since when were Harry and Lloyd mean spirited, sexist, and cruel?

Outdated jokes, racist humor, disgusting humor, bad acting. I love Adam Sandler, Chris Farley, Will Ferrell and other sophmoric humor but this does not work here. It's just a really old Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels trying to be funny. What may have been funny was ruined by poor comedic timing and tasteless jokes. They rub their fingers in their asses and then grab a beer and stick it under someones face so they can get free beer because the beer smells ""skunky"". That's funny? Somehow the childish humor has lost it's luster as you look at these 2 old farts acting like 12 year olds. I could go on but I would just be wasting more of my time on this garbage.

People who write negative reviews here are the ones who don't exactly understand what slapstick comedy and dark humour are all about, and in this particularly niche genre, only those who understand the true nature of its inherent comedy features will truly appreciate the beauty in this movie.

Thankfully, they brought back the original lead characters - funnyman, rubber-faced Jim Carrey and his goofball, nonchalant partner Jeff Daniels. Those who like this movie will also like another movie made within the same decade - The Three Stooges, of which one of the characters had a similar hairdo to that of Jim Carrey in the movie.",1424563200,,874,4.898648648648648
6514172,4,B00LY1YLKE,"Dumb and Dumber is my favorite film of all time. I have followed the Farrelly Brothers throughout their careers. I have loved every film they have written and directed. They truly are geniuses.

When my brother told me there was going to be a sequel to the first, I felt as if a miracle had come true. I died of anticipation for two years.

Unfortunately, it could not live up to the reputation of the first. I think that if perhaps we would have never seen the first, this one would be more funny. I don't think there is anyway the Farrelly Brothers could have made a film as funny as the first. The first was supernatural, something out of this world.

I went into it for what it was: a tribute to the first film.

Don't expect to be laughing immensely, or experience pure brilliance in the script. The first, as I said, was and is incomparable. In the first, the plot flowed so naturally that you believed it was the lives of two very dumb men. In this one, you see what seems to be a mash up of different jokes forced together into a story.

That being said, it's a pretty decent film and the fact that the Farrelly Brothers, Jim Carey, and Jeff Daniels all got together to make it happen is magical enough for me.",1424563200,,1218,4.278260869565218

I'm not sure what happened. It shouldn't have been too hard to make a good sequel to Dumb and Dumber. I don't think anyone was expecting something that lived up to the original, just a movie with the same old Harry and Lloyd, a similar ridiculousness, and a different storyline (with nods to the first one).

I agree with some of the other reviews. It really does seem to be making fun of anyone 'dumb' enough to want to watch it. There is no heart, Lloyd and Harry are like parodies of themselves, they use the same jokes but do them poorly, the storyline is the same but there's no fun in it. It's like eating a junk food you loved years ago, only to find out that they changed the formula and took out the good stuff.",1424390400,2,838,4.2974683544303796
6514534,3,B00LY1YLKE,"It's tough to follow up a comedy classic.  Comedy sequels often have excitement around them, but it's tough for them to deliver as well as the original version did.  I think this is because the first is always something new and unexpected.
 I'm glad the Farrelly Brothers, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels tried at least.  The original was dumb but in a clever way, this one is just dumb.  Are you going to want to watch it again and again and tell your friends they have to see it?  No.  Are there lines that stick out that you'll quote in 5 years time?  Doubtful.  If you liked the first film, your curiosity may lead you to check this out and I think if you do, you will get laughs from it.  It's stupid and it's meant to be stupid.  It wants to make you laugh and- yeah it does take the cheap route this time around, which isn't great, but they did find funny moments that make the film okay.
 Watching this movie once is probably enough and more than likely will make you want to watch the original and appreciate how well that one turned out.

6514539,2,B00LY1YLKE,"This movie received (barely) 2 stars simply for nostalgia. It is about 20 minutes too long, and it looks as though the writers copied the same formula from the first plot (roadtrip, love interest, gags, crooks, redemption), though the second time around it is not so interesting----and pretty convoluted. The film starts out ok, with a funny road trip premise, then gets strange with the introduction of multiple characters, including the brother of a villain who appears to be like the ""Predator"" movie character with his visibility-cloaking ability. Kind of a video game sidetrack from the plot, I guess.

It looks like the writers really strained to come up with a similar, formulaic plot as D&D I. Heck, they had 20 years!

The villains are not so funny or endearing this time. Missing are the funny ""Seabass""-type interactions, and Mafia hitman-types who  pay a price for their involvement. The D&D story works best when the characters are having brief interactions with one another------- and other unsuspecting people. When the shots go longer than a minute, the film bogs down. Extended dialogue is not a strength with these two characters. There are laughs here, no doubt. The ""meth cook"" roommate is probably lost on a good part of the audience, but it is a subtle, very funny element. The ""stinky beer"" sequence is crude, but funny. Again, the brief gags are the best!
After watching this film, I longed for the simplicity of the first one . . . and any subsequent return to the franchise should not be longer than 90 minutes----- there's not enough really funny things after that . . .",1424304000,2,1597,4.842490842490842

You do get similar humor throughout and with the acing of Carrey and Daniels you get a great team that play so well off each other and really do bring their characters back to life. I know that there are some that did not like the movie, but that being said I will say that this movie lived up to what I expected the movie to be. While they tried to hold the movie to the same standard as the first movie, they didn't need to as I think it could stand on its' own.

I am a huge fan of the first Dumb and Dumber. My husband and I thought it was hysterical but you really need to be able to laugh at stupid. If you find stupid dumb, this is a movie for you. We are huge fans of South Park and Tosh so that should tell you something. We find dumb hysterical.

Dumb and Dumber starts out awesome. Lloyd and Harry are much older. Harry has been spending the past 30 something years visiting and taking care of Lloyd in a mental institution as a disabled invalid. He is still ""upset"" over Mary and Harry tells him he has to let it go. Well Lloyd has been spending the past 30 years playing a practical joke.

This time instead of searching for love, the guys are searching for Harry's long lost daughter. He needs a kidney transplant and Lloyd decides to help him get one by finding the girl. The guys are on another road trip that gets them into all kinds of crazy situations.

I thought it was a funny movie. I loved it! Yes there are some crude jokes like Lloyd trying to steal a hearing aid for Harry by sticking his hand under an old lady laying in a bed. ""Do you have the diamonds up in this turkey underneath you?""  There are a lot of poop jokes but all in all if you like stupid humor these guys don't disappoint.

The idea of these grown men searching for a daughter that Harry didn't know he had while Lloyd is secretly falling in love with her is perfect Dumb and Dumber.

Oh and Kathleen Turner as Fraida and Bill Murray as Ice Pick just add to the fun!!!",1424131200,,1514,4.146757679180888

6514626,1,B00LY1YLKE,"Not enough conflict between the characters. No development in their personalities or relationships. Just a steady flow of great jokes, cheap jokes, and bad jokes, over and over. The normal people in the movie were too cartoony, and didn't create a strong enough snap back to reality when we'd spent a few minutes straight with Harry and Lloyd. This is important in comedy writing. The audience can believe any world the story asks us to, but this comes a price. If the world conveys most of the characters being just as funny as the intended ""comic relief,"" then we find them to be way less of a relief. What worked so well for the original film was how serious everyone else in that world was, and how out of place Harry and Llyod seemed in their world. I this film, Harry and Lloyd fit right in, and you eventually lose interest in their shenanigans.

Overall, it's hard to be upset about it. We all wanted this. We just foolishly expected less rot in a two decade old grave.

But shame on you for the Breaking Bad reference. It wasn't even a joke, just a cheap laugh for the spill over audience from those Wayans Brothers' Spoof flick.",1423785600,10,1138,4.492753623188406

Some people might find this movie a little tiresome.  It's either your kind of humor or it's not.  For me, there's something reassuring in Harry and Lloyd.

Even though this movie had it's funny moments, I hate to say it but, Jim Carrey has lost a lot of his comedic talent since the 90s. I don't know why it works that way but a lot of the actors I like from the old days just aren't that good anymore. But, I have to give the creators and original actors credit. They knew Dumb And Dumber was a classic and they tried to make it as good as they could but they fell short. There are forced moments in this movie that makes you go, ""What?!""

People who hate this movie were DUMB enough to go into the theater with expectations of the sequel being on par with the original. Pay no attention to their worthless reviews.

6514709,4,B00LY1YLKE,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

 Judging from the lukewarm, mediocre Amazon ratings for ""Dumb and Dumber To"" (hereafter ""D&D To"", the movie is a major let-down from its classic predecessor.  I'm not in a position to address this opinion because, frankly, I only kinda, sorta half-saw the original ""Dumb and Dumber"", and that was years ago, and on TV, and it may have been censored.  Yeah, I know, I should be ashamed of myself.  But comedy sequels are often a dicey proposition, because the first movie is always the funniest since the humor is unexpected, and the sequels more or less have to include some of the earlier funny stuff to have some continuity.  But, off course, seeing the funny stuff a second or third time is (usually) not as satisfying because you know the joke.  The ""Naked Gun"" trilogy (which ""Dumb and Dumber"" strongly resembles), starring the late, lamented Leslie Nielsen, might be considered a primary example of this.  So maybe the ""D&D To"" movie haters have a point.

 Well, as I say in my review title, all I know is that ""D&D To"" made me (and most of the movie audience I was with) laugh.  ""D&D To"" hits the comedy road rolling from the beginning when, at a mental institution, Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) confesses to Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) that he was only pretending to be in a coma for the last 20 years and that Harry didn't have to feed him, push him in a wheelchair, wipe his butt, etc.  It was just a practical joke.  Naturally, Harry has no hard feelings and even offers to pull out Lloyd's catheter.  Trouble is, the catheter is a little stubborn, even with Harry and two orderlies pulling on it...

Well, anyway, Lloyd and Harry are off on a new adventure.  Harry learns from funeral home director (I think) Fraida Felcher that he may have had a daughter named Fanny (Rachel Melvin) by her.  From an address on an envelope returned unread to Fraida, the guys EVENTUALLY figure out where Fanny lives.  After the expected road trip mishaps, Lloyd and Harry learn that Fanny has changed her name to Penny and is apparently the adopted daughter of eminent scientist Dr. Pinchelow (Steve Tom) and Adele Pinchelow (Laurie Holden).  Dr. Pinchelow has an invention he claims will change the course of humanity, but he is too ill to attend the El Paso science convention to present it and get an award.  Turns out, Adele and servant (I guess) Travis (Rob Riggle) have been poisoning the doctor's food in a bid to snatch the invention and make millions.  But the doctor sends Penny, who proves to be as much of a scatterbrain as Lloyd and Harry, to the convention in his place.  Now Adele and Travis plan to bump off Penny as well.  But as expected, Lloyd and Harry arrive at the Pinchlows' place to complicate matters even more.  You see, Harry wants to find his daughter not only for the usual reasons, but also because he may need a compatible kidney.  On top of that, Lloyd falls obsessively in love with Penny.

Okay, enough (or maybe too much) exposition.  ""D&D To"" at least knows that it is largely a rehash of the original, since the end credits show juxtapositions of similar scenes from each movie.  Perhaps ""D&D To"" was confident that its material was so outrageous that it could get as much laughs the second time.  Again, I don't know about that.  Essentially seeing this material for the first time, I can say is I laughed a majority of the time and only somewhat winced now and then at some scenes.  I thought the catheter, envelope address mix-up, and lottery ticket scenes were slyly hilarious.  The over-the-top ""Funnel Nuts"" game Travis, who's trying to eliminate the guys as well when they decide to try to find Penny at the convention, teaches Lloyd and Harry to play, makes you laugh and wince at the same time.  Ditto for the icky way Lloyd gets a hearing aid for Harry after a train accident, and the icky way Lloyd and Harry get free beers at the convention.  Some scenes, like the ""wine cork"" dream sequence and the homeless guy with the dead rat in his mouth, were admittedly more icky than funny, but that was infrequent.

Therefore, I recommend ""D&D To"" for that tiny group of people who have not seen the original movie and do not mind the occasional raunchy, scatological, or gross scene with their comedy.  I also recommend ""D&D To"" because, despite what some Amazon posters have said, Lloyd and Harry are still basically decent guys, in spite of the sometimes harsh slapstick gags they play on each other and in spite of the last scene (which I bust a gut over, so sue me).  After all, each makes a sacrifice to save the other.

P.S.:  For a second sequel, however, I think it might be fun for the ""Dumb and Dumber"" franchise to do a spoof of ""Flowers for Algernon"", where a retarded person becomes a genius through surgery.  It's just a suggestion, to make things different and interesting.",1417651200,5,4867,4.613953488372093
6514710,5,B00LY1YLKE,this movie is awesome. this movie is hilarious I loved. just seeing jim and jeff play Lloyd and harry again was a treat this might not happen again for along time or it might not happen again period. this was just a pinch less funnier than the first but not far. both movies are equal to me and you don't see that in sequels. the plot was dumb but that's the point. this movie is all about stupidity and jim and jeff do a great job. if you loved the first you will love this one. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1416960000,11,535,3.962962962962963
6514711,4,B00LY1YLKE,"They tried to match the original, and somewhat succeeded, but somewhat failed. Before you read on, -SPOILERS ahead-

The good: there were a lot of funny moments all throughout the movie. I disagree with people who rush to the extreme negative and say it is an absolute stinker of a film. Some of the best parts: Harry and Lloyd's interaction, their vicious pranks against each other, the continuity with the first movie, and revisiting old characters, such as Timmy, the blind kid with the bird. I also liked Rob Riggle's performance, and the way he basically played the same character twice. The way his first character died was really funny to me. Also, I enjoyed the re-appearance of their dog van, the shaggin wagon, and the way the movie actually shows realistic consequences of the clich Hollywood car jump. RIP shaggin wagon!

The bad: this movie was not as funny overall as the original. What can I say, I was waiting for a gag that would top the turbo-lax toilet scene, and instead we get Lloyd reaching his hand in an old woman's bed, and what happens was just too disgusting. When I saw that in the theater, it certainly got a reaction, but it was not laughter. Everyone was gasping and I heard a lot of ""gross"" comments. I was also not too amused when Harry holds up a cat, lifts up its tail, and points its exposed rear end at the camera. The joke wasn't that funny, and it was just nasty. I don't want to see a cat's chocolate starfish! I think the difference boils down to this: in the original, there was some mildly gross stuff, but it was not over the top gross, and it was funny. In this new movie, the gross factor is over the top, and it's not all that funny.

So will I buy this Blu-ray? Sure, once it's marked below $9.99. The movie is not a total train wreck, there's enough funny parts to make it watchable. But in no way does it match or surpass the original. I have a feeling that this will be the last Dumb and Dumber with Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels together, seeing how Jim Carrey usually doesn't like sequels. He made an exception for this movie.

Oh, and one more complaint: What's up with Seabass not getting any time until AFTER the credits??",1416960000,35,2176,4.4325
6514712,4,B00LY1YLKE,"Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey) search for Harry's daughter, the one he never new he had. And she compliments our twosome nicely. As expected Jeff Daniels plays a straight man for Jim Carrey in most of their scenes. There were scenes which had me and the theater laughing out loud, and alas scenes that just didn't work due to predictability. It takes about 20 minutes for the film to break out and get funny.

The movie has 1 f-bomb and crude humor. 3 1/2 STARS",1416700800,,474,4.448275862068965

6514714,2,B00LY1YLKE,"Is this as bad as the critics say? Yes and no. If you like Adam Sandler movies, you will like this. If you were a huge fan of the original movie (like me) then you might enjoy seeing the characters again on screen. There are a couple of parts that made me smile or chuckle. Big laughs, not so much. The biggest problem for me is that this is a sequel to my favorite comedy of all-time and it is not even close in quality. The people who made this film really miss the point of what made the original great.

The original film established the characters as grown men with the mental capacity of 7 year old boys. For much of the original the characters have a sort of innocence about them which made them endearing. In this sequel that innocence is gone completely. In fact they come across as mean and dangerous. An example of this can be seen in the plot. In the original Harry and Lloyd go on a road trip to return a lost briefcase to a woman. Although they had their own reasons, the basic actions have some form of good intentions. In the sequel they turn the characters into deadbeat dads who search for their daughter to ask for a kidney and for the other to marry her. The plot changes these characters immediately into bad people, and their entire goal is self-serving. This is reflected in the entire film. They become less fun to watch this time around because they are really hard to root for.

The comedy in the sequel has a much meaner edge to it. In the original they are stupid but they don't seem malicious in what they do. Nothing they do is done with bad intention. In part two Harry and Lloyd do things that are mean the entire film. They end with them pushing two strangers into the bushes for giggles. The way they treat Harrys parents is awful. The way they treat most everyone in the film is.just bad. It does not translate to one laugh. The comedy is packed full of gags, and very few of them seem to push the story forward. The first Dumb and Dumber a lot of what happens happens, happens within the context of the story. Not every minute had to have a joke. The sequel almost seems desperate because of the number of jokes they try and pack into the movie mostly at the cost of a coherent story. Most of what is done has no purpose (and most of the jokes are very forgettable).

Another big problem with the sequel is the setting. In the original, the dumb duo is set in reality. All the supporting characters serve as the straight men. Great comedy needs the combo of crazy played against the straight man. The sequels supporting characters are every bit as crazy and unusual as the leads. There is nothing to ground this movie. It is a lot like Neighbors which came out earlier this summer. When everything is crazy it just becomes a bunch of noise, their is no nuance to it. After a while it all just runs together and nothing seems funny because there is no normal reaction to relate to.

Lastly, what made early Farrely Brother comedies great was that their movies and characters had big hearts. We could relate and actually like the characters in these movies (which include Dumb and Dumber, Theres Something About Mary, Shallow Hal, Me, Myself and Irene, and even Stuck on You). There were moments where the characters revealed something true about themselves. The directors cared about these characters and they were treated with respect despite their obvious faults. In this sequel, Harry and Lloyd were not treated this way. They were treated like stock characters and there for laughs only. No one, not the writer or director, had any reverence for these characters. And since they didn't why should we?

So in conclusion they took 20 years to make a careless cash grab of a sequel to a movie that I hold high regard for. A lot more care should have been taken with these characters and it surprises me a lot that the original writer/directors were involved with this movie and this was the outcome? The plot itself was fairly generic. Couldnt something more original and clever be thought of after all this time? If you are going to spend the time and effort to make a sequel to a movie that so many people love, couldn't a little more care have been taken with the characters? Did they have no idea what made their early films so successful and beloved by fans or do the Farrelly Brothers even care anymore? Was this sequel just a payday and nothing more? It certainly seems so and that is a bit sad.",1416441600,195,4438,4.4338235294117645
