8570493,3,B00BLOPR70,"No ""The Lady Vanishes"".  Not a big deal to me but if you are looking for that one in particular be aware that it is NOT included here, despite what the DVD cover says.  I would actually prefer to see 'Beat the Devil' by John Huston so that's a plus, but pretty amateur s*** to list the wrong movie on the box.",1462492800,6,309,3.967741935483871
8570494,3,B00BLOPR70,"OK for the price - but only about two movies worth watching out of the 15 videos.
Comes in two discs and with two DVD covers",1447804800,5,124,3.8076923076923075
8570495,2,B00BLOPR70,"I found a better video quality version of these movies on YouTube: Becky Sharp, Vanity Fair, Algiers, They Made Me a Criminal. I didn't look for the others, because I have some of them on Millcreek/Treeline box sets. The image of Beat the Devil was so awful that I stopped after 3 minutes, and found my Treeline version. Treeline is watchable.

The fact that TGG Direct loaded 7 or 8 movies, each 70-100 minutes in length, on one side of a DVD, should be a warning about the (lack of) data provided.

I didn't play these recently, but I have them on the packs listed (which I bought 10+ years ago).

8570497,4,B00BLOPR70,"The Lady Vanishes is not included in the set as it says on the box. Instead is another movie called, 'Beat the Devil' starring Humphrey Bogart.

Most, if not all, of these movies are from the public domain. That doesn't mean they're bad, someone just forgot to renew the rights.

Nice quality for 7 to 8 movies per disc.",1389484800,6,320,4.406779661016949
