8659996,5,B00CMAUN12,"This is one of the most memorable movies ever made. Mammooty and Mohanlal have equal scene time to make their fans happy. Suresh Gopi shines in all scenes and is the best thing about the movie. Dileep is just OK in a regular role suited for him among the bigger stars. The action scenes were boring except mohanlal's which is fun for his fans to watch. Bhavana has nothing much to do except look pretty. It was good that the younger stars were not given screen space because their performance cannot match the trio of Mohanlal,Suresh Gopi,Mammooty.  Defenitly a MUST HAVE for any Malayalam movie fan.",1367452800,,600,4.660377358490566
