3963999,5,B002P8LKBI,"This is a wonderful class. Having done it with its creators, I can honestly speak to their skill and knowledge. This class really gives you a great sweat and strength workout in an interval style yoga format- it really burn some calories and loosens you up. You will be glad you got this DVD. If you can't make it out to Santa Monica regularly, this is the next best thing.",1259625600,6,373,4.3428571428571425
3964000,5,B002P8LKBI,Best yoga video I've ever done. I try others but they are not as well put together as this one and man this one changes my body so quickly. Want good arms? Do this one. Want nice legs and abs? Do this one. I've been doing body slim for years and I love it.,1440979200,,256,3.759259259259259

3964002,1,B002P8LKBI,Boring workout. Silly commentary. Pose featured on cover is not even included on the video. A waste of money.,1436486400,,109,4.7894736842105265

3964005,5,B002P8LKBI,"I love this video. I have done it weekly for over 3yrs. It is a great workout for people that want to sweat, and not just ""stretch."" I highly recommend it.",1423180800,,155,4.032258064516129

3964007,2,B002P8LKBI,"While the instruction is very, very good, the vinyasas are WAY too fast. I was a dedicated Yoga Works Annie Carpenter junkie so I'm not new to this type of class. There was barely enough time to get to the next move let alone plant your feet.",1417132800,,242,4.170212765957447

3964011,5,B002P8LKBI,"I absolutely love this video!  I had first done this workout on my Time Warner fitness channel, which, unfortunately, was removed after some time.  Not knowing the name of this, I searched for awhile and was so excited when I found it.  It's a great workout!  I love the mix of cardio and slowburn.  I always play my own background music, so I don't mind that there isn't any.  I love the instructor's voice...not annoying like some can be!!!  I highly recommend!",1406937600,,463,4.573170731707317
3964012,1,B002P8LKBI,I work out a lot and this seemed like a beginner workout although my arms and chest were sore for a few days so maybe it was harder than I realized.,1404432000,,148,3.806451612903226
3964013,5,B002P8LKBI,"Some of the moves provide significant challenge, but most aren't too difficult. I'm an intermediate and I enjoy this video. I know some people said that they hated her talking, but I enjoy the cadence of her voice and love hearing the names of the poses in san-skrit.",1401926400,2,267,4.583333333333333
3964014,4,B002P8LKBI,"It is definitely more strenuous than I had anticipated, but it's a great way to supplement my other workout routines.",1393977600,,117,4.9
3964015,5,B002P8LKBI,"I love yoga and wanted a new routine. This is more than a yoga routine, it is a full blown, sweaty workout. I loved it. The pace is fast, but slow enough to follow and it is challenging for any level. I would highly suggest it to anyone!",1393977600,2,237,3.9583333333333335
3964016,5,B002P8LKBI,"I love this workout! People who think yoga is slow and boring need to get this DVD! It will have you SWEATING. This workout gets my heart rate into the fat burning zone (55% - 70%) for almost the entire time. (When I take the time to check, I'm usually in the 68% range but by the third section of vinyasa flows I'm in the 75% range, so it's also a great cardio workout as well). Great buy!",1393459200,4,390,4.012820512820513
3964017,5,B002P8LKBI,"I did this one when it was on demand with Comcast but they took it off.  This is a challenging one that gets your heart rate up but also works to sculpt abs, arms, and legs.  I do it once a week and have seen good results.",1391126400,,222,3.702127659574468
3964018,5,B002P8LKBI,Favorite yoga workout. A little faster yoga to help you burn calories. If I could only buy one video this would be it.,1389225600,,118,4.173913043478261
3964019,5,B002P8LKBI,"I am pretty new to yoga and this work out is very well instructed. I could do all of the poses- I'm positive I don't look as graceful, but I did it! It works pretty much every area of your body as proven by the soreness all over the following day! =) It felt good to be sore though cause I know it's working! My teenager daughter has even joined me once and she agreed it was a great workout!",1389139200,2,392,3.9125

3964021,4,B002P8LKBI,"I've done this video twice.  Just did it for the 2nd time and am a little shaky. It's different than a normal yoga video or class.  It's focus is definitely on strength and cardio and using standard yoga positions to achieve those goals.  So it's perfect when you want to sweat a little more than a normal yoga class.  I think the video burns calories and will make you stronger.  But it won't enhance your yoga skills or flexibility.  It will definitely make you stronger and in better shape. I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 b/c the instructor is good, not great.",1384041600,6,561,4.398058252427185
3964022,5,B002P8LKBI,"This is one of my most favorite yoga routines.  Normally I get bored after 35 minutes, but this video makes me want to keep on going to the end!",1383868800,,144,3.9655172413793105
3964023,5,B002P8LKBI,"I have followed this work out for 3 years and although I bounce from work out to to work out, this is my go to. I love the instruction and the flow of the poises. The instruction is very easy to follow.",1372896000,,202,3.8333333333333335
3964024,5,B002P8LKBI,"I used to get this On-Demand then they took it off so I had to go buy it.  Love the combo between slow-burn and cardio workout.  You really work up a sweat for yoga, but you feel so fantastic afterwards!",1368144000,2,203,4.05
3964025,2,B002P8LKBI,"This was disappointing for a couple of reasons.  After using and liking YogaWorks' FIT ABS program I had hoped for more of the same sort of workout but perhaps with different or more difficult poses.  The instructor not only did not vocalize all of her moves as she did them so that you could work out without having to keep your eye her every move, somewhat difficult while upside down,  but the speed at which the poses were executed made it impossible to hold the stretches, an intrinsic part of a yoga work out.  It felt more like calisthenics than yoga.",1367798400,7,558,4.4950495049504955
3964026,4,B002P8LKBI,I find that a lot of yoga videos are short but this one is slightly longer than the ones I have so that was a first plus. The instructor moves at a good pace and talks through each movement which I find helpful. It does take a couple of times for your body to get used to yoga but I've heard great things about Power yoga so I'm looking forward to my body responding well to this.,1364774400,,380,3.948051948051948
3964027,5,B002P8LKBI,I love doing yoga and wanted a challenge. This gave me that challenge.  I love it!!!! It is not for the beginners though,1364428800,2,120,4.217391304347826
3964028,5,B002P8LKBI,I first discovered the Yoga Works series through my on demand programming from my cable company. I loved it and was so sad when it disappeared. This program is great for beginners and advanced yogi's. it never seems to get easier.,1362873600,2,230,4.634146341463414
3964029,5,B002P8LKBI,"I didn't particularly care about Yoga, but was told that it would be beneficial to my weight loss goal. I ran across YogaWorks on Comcast ""On Demand"" and after working out on several occasions with Andrea, I knew I had to make this a part of my weekly routine. Thanks YogaWorks!",1362355200,,278,4.470588235294118
3964030,5,B002P8LKBI,I used this workout to lose the baby weight with my first. At the time it was free though OnDemand.  Second time around it was not available and I was more than happy to spend the small amount of money.  It came brand new and quickly.  Have already lost 5 pounds using it twice a week. 45 minutes of yoga quality you would get at a yoga class through a gym. Highly recommend buying from user and using this video for weight loss!,1361059200,3,429,4.144578313253012
3964031,4,B002P8LKBI,"I am 57 years old, and I have yet to get through all of this routine.  I am presently doing the first 25 minutes or so, and aim to master all the moves before continuing on.  I am presently a little out of shape by comparison to what I was six months ago, so this is probably the reason I cannot do more.  Flexibility is something you lose with age, so it is so important to do yoga, even if you do a lot of walking, lift weights, etc.

The idea of starting out with core work is great - it is nice to feel that you are doing something for those abs and getting it over with!  This routine then alternates cardio sections with yoga body burn sections, and you really feel the cardio, especially.  I do get a bit bored with the sun salutations, and would have liked a bit more variety, in this respect, so that's why I have only given it a four.  It is definitely a thorough workout, however!",1360195200,6,891,4.086206896551724
3964032,4,B002P8LKBI,"I love this DVD. It's definitely more of a vinyasa flow or power yoga than anything else as the poses are very athletic. If I have a lot of energy and am not feeling like a lot of 'sitting on the floor stretching', this is the yoga video I choose.",1359849600,5,247,3.96
3964033,3,B002P8LKBI,"After using the same beginner yoga dvd for several months, I was seeking one offering more poses, extended stretching opportunites and a greater yoga experience.  Because of the reasonable price, I decided to give this dvd a try, in spite of some viewer warnings.  I really wanted to like this dvd but was too bored to continue past the first twenty minutes!  Despite her cheery disposition, I found the instructor's style somewhat disruptive and lacking in opportunites to hold poses long enough to achieve any real benefit.  Instructions seemed to be thrown out between breaths.  ""Breath in...raise your arms overhead....breathe out.....lower them to the floor....... stretch back into plank.......feel the burn, we're burning calories.  If you are looking for a non-impact aerobic workout you may want to give this dvd a try.  If you are searching for real yoga instruction you may want to keep looking.",1359417600,10,906,5.164383561643835
3964034,5,B002P8LKBI,"I was referred to the YogaWorks brand by a friend who is actually a yoga teacher (whom does not work for this company.) Going to a studio to take classes is too costly for me, and I do mostly meditative yoga at home. I told my friend that I was on the hunt for a good video for a more fitness based routine. She immediately replied with ""YogaWorks!""  I came home and decided on their Body Slim video. I am at an intermediate level, and was looking forward to a challenge with familiar poses. Boy, oh, boy. I got what I was looking for.

Jesse, the instructor, is wonderful. Clear and concise, she talks you through the whole routine, even if it is at moment her just telling you to inhale or exhale. I like that she reminds you to smile, and have fun.

Before starting any new yoga dvd I always watch it in its entirety first. When I was first watching this one, I felt that it looked simple, and would be very easy for me to complete. Ok, I was wrong. It was wonderfully challenging. Every time I complete the video I am left feeling pretty incredible afterwards. I do this video about 3 times a week, and have done so for about 3 weeks now. ( I also run, and do meditative yoga several times a week.) I quickly started to notice a difference in my body after consistently doing this video. I honestly look forward to doing this routine, and would definitely recommend to anyone who is already familiar with yoga, and is looking to slim down and get their heart rate up.

This video is NOT for beginners, or those who are trying to relax or meditate. It is, however, and awesome video from and awesome company with an awesome instructor and an awesome routine that will leave you feeling awesome.",1359331200,2,1697,4.34384858044164
3964035,5,B002P8LKBI,Would recommend to others.  Came in excellent conditon.  came in the time promised.  Have been very pleased w all things,1357257600,,120,4.9
3964036,5,B002P8LKBI,My wife and I purchased this DVD to go along with another yoga DVD we have. It has been a nice compliment to another YogaWorks workout DVD. We do yoga out of our home and this Body Slim by Andrea is great. I recommend this to anyone that also likes to do yoga out of their home. I think all levels of users would benefit from this DVD.,1356998400,2,335,3.9411764705882355
3964037,5,B002P8LKBI,Love this YogaWorks.  Have many yoga tapes to change up my daily workouts but find myself going to this one more often.  I really feel like I've accomplished something after this workout.  Sweat a lot but it feels good.,1354060800,,219,4.564102564102564
3964038,5,B002P8LKBI,"First saw it on Comcast's Exercise TV On Demand programs. I fell in love and now I own them all! Body slim really does slim, Beginners is nice and gentle, and core is kick-ass! ;) Have fun!",1350345600,,189,4.135135135135135
3964039,3,B002P8LKBI,"I've got this DVD as Yoga newbie 2 months ago.
Agree with Carrie and the 1-star review - while this is a nice concept, I feel the fact to get-out-of-breath has little to do with yoga. I used this program several times now, and the more I go into Yoga practice, the less I like it.

+ trainer keeps me motivated, real ""fitness-studio"" feeling

-- ""Cardio""-sections are way too fast, it's impossible to keep correct breathing
- modified versions are presented by only 1 person (out of 6-7 participants), and camera shows this person only occasionally; not really helpful for beginner.

I would not recommend this DVD for yoga practice, but for those who want to get nice workout with yoga elements.",1343779200,9,696,4.688524590163935
3964040,5,B002P8LKBI,"I'm pretty new to yoga, so I started with the YogaWorks Beginners DVD.  I moved on to this one, and wow!  It's very challenging for me, and I have to modify the poses, but it's a great workout.  When I'm done, I feel amazing!  I recommend this to anyone- if you're a yoga pro, this might be easier for you, but even the woman leading the video gets winded.  Definitely a great purchase!",1343433600,2,386,4.232876712328767
3964041,4,B002P8LKBI,This workout will leave you dripping in sweat. And is a very good workout for a more laid back individual that just wants to stay fit. The problems i had with this dvd was i wish there was more of a warm up in the beginning instead of a pilates like ab routine. I also don't recommend people who have shoulder problems to push your self to the limit. just adjust to you limits without injurying urself more.,1343001600,6,407,4.230769230769231
3964042,5,B002P8LKBI,"This is a yoga DVD that feels like a class.  There is constant activity; no wasted time for set ups.  It also goes through fast movements interspersed with ""slow burn"" movements -- several intervals.  The one very minor complaint is that the instructor -- who is very good -- sometimes runs out of breath because she does the routine with you.  While it's nice that she does the routine, when she runs out of breath, it's hard for her to give reminders regarding breathing (in/out) and form.  As I get tired, my breathing/form suffers, so I need those reminders.  But, overall, I love this DVD.  This and the Bryan Kest one are my favorites.",1338681600,,641,4.5701754385964914
3964043,3,B002P8LKBI,"I have several different yoga and other work out DVD's and was looking for something new that was less than an hour long for days I don't have much time. This workout flew by. There was not a lot of time to hold any poses, so you felt rushed through the whole thing. On a positive note, you do sweat and at the end feel like you did a cardio work out. Overall, I will probably add this to my rotation of dvd's but not consider it my favorite.",1336521600,6,442,3.9775280898876404
3964044,5,B002P8LKBI,"As a yoga newbie, I first started the YogaWorks beginners AM/PM that was on my cable On Demand.  I am very new to Yoga, so it was a challenge at first.  Then our local cable discontinued the On Demand fitness that had this workout.  I ordered it from Amazon, built up my strength and learned the poses better.  I am now doing the Body Slim and LOVE it!  It's one of my favorite workouts ever!  I am so used to workouts including weights and cardio, so making the transition to yoga was hard for me, but I love it.  It's probably a ""beginner's"" workout, but it still challenges me to the core!  I haven't yet reached my weight loss and fitness goals, but I am definintely seeing my arms tone, my obliques have slimmed, and just overall feel better!  I would definitely recommend this for any beginner for sure, as if I can do it, then I'm sure most others can (I'm also very unflexible!)  I try to do this at least 2 times a week now along with some strength and cardio.  I must also say..I have Plantar Fascitis and since I have started to do yoga a couple times a week, it doesn't bother me nearly as much.  Can't say that the yoga did it for sure, but it's definitely better!",1333929600,2,1177,4.228699551569507

3964049,5,B002P8LKBI,"This is one of the 2 or 3 yoga videos that has earned a permanent spot in my exercise rotation. It's unique in that it deliberately provides cardio work with yoga (in addition to ""slow burn"" and abs work). I also really like that they mixed in some men with the usual bevy of beautiful women. As a man, watching beautiful women is of course always a pleasure, but I like exercise videos that don't assume that only women will use them. This is a good yoga video if you want to sweat and work hard during your yoga. I alternative it with other yoga videos that are more geared to working on holding positions correctly. This one will build stamina and strength quickly, and the abs workouts are a great bonus. Highly recommended.",1323734400,2,728,4.440298507462686

This DVD is less than an hour and provides a comprehensive, challenging yoga workout. I get pretty sweaty doing this one, and after I did it the first time, I woke up the next day sore in places I didn't know I could be sore! The instructor is top notch and it moves at just the right pace for me (quick, but not TOO quick). I always find the time flying when I do this one.",1322179200,,528,4.038095238095238
3964051,5,B002P8LKBI,I workout between once and twice a week with the yogaworks body slim video and it always makes my body feel like it's gotten a great workout.  I like how it starts off with easier cardio and slow burn sequences and works up to more challenging postures.  It has also helped me with stress and tension; my upper back feels a lot better (I am in front of a computer most of the work day).  Would highly recommend this video.,1320192000,5,422,4.25

The first time I tried it, I sweated a lot and my arms, legs, and abs were sore. I loved it!! I knew I worked out really hard in one hour and I was addicted. I've been doing it 2-3 times a week now and I can see results in my arms and abs. It makes you look and feel stronger, and you will feel so much better afterwards. You might feel discouraged at first but don't give up! You won't regret it. Be prepared to sweat!!",1314316800,5,520,3.869158878504673

3964055,5,B002P8LKBI,"I am addicted to this video. I am a beginner and I started with the YogaWorks Beginners video to get used to all of the basic poses. When I first tried the Body Slim video, I was pretty discouraged. It was really difficult for me to keep up and at times, I just had to stop and watch in amazement. I decided to keep practicing the Beginners workout for about two weeks, and after that, I was able to do the entire Body Slim workout. I need to use some of the modifications, but I can keep up with everyone on the video and it is a fantastic workout. It really gets your heart pumping, but during the slow burn routines you are able to find your breath and cool down again. I love it! I do this complete workout 2-3 times a week. In combination with the Beginners video (I rotate between them), and after about two months of doing these workouts, I can see and feel a huge difference in my biceps and calves, and I am also seeing change in my stomach and thighs.

Nothing has quite lived up to the classes at YogaWorks so I was so insanely happy when they released these dvd workouts!

3964059,5,B002P8LKBI,"Love this video. I have defined my arms and abs especially. I workout with it at least 2-3 days a week. Everytime I use it, im engaged and focused. The switching between standing poses(slow burn) and cardio moving makes it so that it is strenth and cardio.
I would rate this as a intermediate to high intermediate level yoga(but not advanced). When first did this video I had to use modfications(showing in video) or break at certain points, but  don't get discouraged. I think that after 2 weeks, I was pushing through and feelng good.

Another reviewer gave this a 1 star because it wasn't a mind/body style. To that I would argue that any yoga is mind/body. Its your time with your body, breath, and your strength in building your power. This happens to be a slimming class which is moving, not still meditation. I wouldnt punish the video for being what it is. If you want meditation, this isn't for you. If you want strength and definition and weightloss- this is your video. Good luck. Namaste.",1277510400,58,1000,4.612359550561798
3964060,4,B002P8LKBI,"I bought a special from the actual Yogaworks studio in Orange County. I was hoping to find a similar routine I can do at home, so I decided to buy this dvd. It's easier than the level 1 classes I have done at Yogaworks studio, but it's not bad. But I wish it was a little more challenging. I use to feel sore after the actual studio workouts, but I don't feel that way after this dvd. However, I add this dvd to my workouts once in a while to give it more variety.",1275609600,6,464,3.9468085106382977
3964061,5,B002P8LKBI,"I love this video.  I did it initially through my cable company's on-demand service, and as soon as it was over I immediately got on Amazon and ordered the DVD. I do this almost every day now and it is fantastic!  Cardio has always been difficult for me to stick with, but with this routine I am so focused on my breath and alignment that I barely notice the physical exertion until I'm finished and covered with sweat.  Probably not ideal for someone who is very new to yoga, as you move through poses very quickly during the cardio sequences.  But, for someone with a bit of experience with the basic poses, this is a fantastic work-out.",1274140800,4,639,4.435897435897436
3964062,1,B002P8LKBI,"This is yoga as a workout, not yoga as a mind, body & soul centering practice.  She alternates between cardio, using vinyasa flow moves, then switches to stretching poses.  It is not appropriate if you are aiming for the process that calms the mind, aligns the body and enlightens the soul.  Her voice is in a mode of a cheerleader, of a 'you can do it' actor.  She elongates a word every few, like streeeetttch it out, reeeeaaaach it up.  It gets annoying.  Her voice is also very FAR from a calming, soothing meditation voice of many yoga masters.  The meditation phase was a joke.  There are very little hatha yoga stretches in here as well.

Choose this dvd if you want a work out that involves stretching.  Do not choose it if you think you will get the full benefits of yoga.  I give her credit, she knows the sanskrit words for each move and she does match the breathing with the move.  But I do yoga 7 days a week for a different reason.  This dvd will never be played again.",1272931200,22,983,4.306010928961749
3964063,5,B002P8LKBI,"For someone who is not terribly experienced in yoga and is looking to tone up and lose weight, this video is perfect! I love that there are both cardio and slow burn sections woven together. Even though I'm not very flexible, I could do all of the poses and sequences. If you can't keep up with the video, there is an easier version that is shown as well.
Overall, this video is great. The instructor is motivating and very precise. I can already feel a difference in the way I feel since I've started using this. I would absolutely recommend this DVD.",1271808000,9,552,4.421568627450981
3964064,5,B002P8LKBI,I have tried a few other yoga dvds and this one is the best. Its great to be able to tone and get some strength training when you do not feel like using weights. The instructions are clear and the pace is not to fast but just right to increase your heart rate. I hope they will make some additional body slim dvds.,1268438400,3,314,4.0
3964065,5,B002P8LKBI,"In addition to YogaWorks Beginners' AM/PM, and YogaWorks Fit Abs DVDs, YogaWorks has the BodySlim DVD whose focus is on weight loss. After trying out the other two DVDs, I was excited to work out to this DVD. This is an intense and challenging workout that increases body conditioning and strengthens the core. During the workout I could feel all of my muscles shaking and my heart rate going up. I like to challenge myself during this workout, but afterwards I feel so energized that it is all worth it. I am convinced that if I keep on working out to this DVD, I will continue to lose weight. I usually bring this DVD with me when I travel to help me maintain my workout routine and use it as an alternative to going to the gym.",1264377600,36,730,4.335766423357664
3964066,5,B002P8LKBI,"Intelligent yoga exercise sequence taught by a very experienced teacher from YogaWorks in Los Angeles.  The instructor, Jesse Schein, gives clear and concise instructions during the main ""Body Slim Class"" segment which is just under fifty minutes long.  This DVD also includes a fourteen minute ""Learning Guide"" by another YogaWorks instructor that covers the basic building block poses, how to perform them correctly and also the sanskrit names.  Jesse Schein's ""Body Slim Class"" starts with some floor warm-ups and then progresses through a standing sequence. During the ""Body Slim Class"" Jesse talks you through the sequence and demonstrates it at the same time, while a room of students follow along.  One of the students models a modified version of the sequence for beginners.  Jesse is a very popular yoga instructor with a loyal following and teaches a PACKED class in Santa Monica.  I highly recommend this DVD if you're looking for a challenging workout taught by someone that knows her stuff!",1262822400,23,1003,5.198757763975156

The program itself is great.
The production quality...well it's not amazing, but it isn't horrible. It's not as clear and well laid out like you see is popular videos. But, it doesn't really matter because it's a great yoga dvd. She is easy to listen to which matters a lot to me. I can't workout with those overly excited or super tough voices, makes me feel like my heart is racing before I even workout.

8376722,3,B002P8LKBI,"If you are looking for a traditional yoga workout, this is not it - it goes way too fast to enjoy the purpose of yoga, which for me, is to relax, stretch, strengthen my muscles, and focus on challenging my body to perfect the pose.  That said, it is designed to be very fast moving to incorporate a cardio element.  Unfortunately for me, since I am used to doing Tabata or Hiit cardio (which is the most beneficial and efficient cardio, according to research), this fell short of that, so I feel it is stuck in the middle between a yoga workout that is too fast and a cardio workout that is lacking in enough intensity to get the heart rate up enough to really benefit your heart.  If you are a beginner to exercise, however, this may be a great place to start, and I will likely continue to use it for light workout days or off days.

I am confused about the pictures of the poses on the cover and the back, however, since none of those pictures correspond to the workout at all - I find that very strange and misleading.",1461801600,,1022,4.252577319587629
