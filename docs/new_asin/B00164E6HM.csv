8260741,1,B00164E6HM,"George (Tom Parker) shows up in a Mexican village to look for his missing sister who he barely knows. Mom (Dee Wallace) is distant and tells him to leave. Children all over town are disappearing and people suspect a ghost/demon J-ok'el, a legendary woman who drowned her own children.

George is determined to find his sister. The film was made for TV lame quality. Very boring. Keep the FF button handy.
