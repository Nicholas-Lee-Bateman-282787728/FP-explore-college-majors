8239029,5,B0010X5JCA,After visiting Jerusalem you will want this DVD. It is one of the best and well focused films of the Old City I have found to date. It covers the four religions that are established there by people and historians that live in the city walls. I highly recomend this film for those that want to learn morn than the knowledge that was given by the tour guides. The views are rejuvenating to see and will most definately restore your memory of what you saw. Enjoy,1230681600,17,459,4.348837209302325
