8121553,5,B000FEWNMY,"saw this movie when it first came on tv.......great script-good acting......amazon forgot to mention that Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones
films and the lovely Jennifer Warren is also in it......Dobson is great as the muscle of this secret society while Stella is the brains and
Jennifer finding new blood to introduce to the club which of course is M Stowe but Jack is the one who opens Stowe`s eyes when she is
accused of something to get her into this society from the hospital she works at and things get strange after that.....Jack & Stowe both
work together to destroy the all-female world domination group but as things end there is always someone to pick up the pieces to start
a new chapter of the Amazon Society......which simply means you can kill most of the strong women out there but they find a way to
rebuild this amazing world thru one young girl........to bad they never put this film on dvd you will have to do that yourself so I hope you
own a vcr then transfer it to dvd or Blu-ray but save the vcr & tape you may just need them for the future that`s what I did",1450310400,,1082,4.415
