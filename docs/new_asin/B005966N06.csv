4620450,5,B005966N06,"I ordered this because I have always loved the Gidget movies and the TV series.  This gave the background info on how it all started.  Even though I am almost a contemporary of the real Gidget, I was unaware of lots of the cultural aspects of surfing in its inception, so this filled in a lot of holes in my knowledge.
I gave this 5 stars, not because it is something I will watch many, many times--though I certainly will watch it again--but because it was very fun for me to see and remember times gone by, when growing up in America was a different experience than it is now.",1388016000,6,578,4.245454545454545
4620451,4,B005966N06,"Documentaries are great ways to learn more about the things that you are interested in. And sometimes documentaries are great ways to learn things that you had no clue about in the first place. For me, this film falls into the latter category. It was fun, informative, and most important gave me an insight on a part of American life I had not learned about before.

Yes, Gidget (Kathy Kohner) was a real person. A nickname combining the words girl midget, Gidget was around fifteen years old when she started hanging around on the beaches of southern California in the fifties. She was feisty, a girl ahead of her time. She learned how to surf on those beaches at a time when girls were just eye candy, and just sat on the beach, watching their surfer boyfriends. She also kept everything that happened on that beach written in her diary. At some point she decided that her story needed to be shared, so she talked her screenplay writing father into penning her story, creating a sensation.

After the book became a best seller, the movies came calling. The first Gidget film was a smash success, but as most of the original surfer bums observed, it was the beginning of the end. What was once almost an exclusive club of serious surfers, became an overnight American sensation. Everyone wanted to try surfing, and the beaches became clogged with ""surfing wannabe's"".

The string of Gidget movies continued, along with a TV series and at one point a cartoon as well. Women around the world started to identify with Gidget's personality, a girl with lots of determination to do what she loved, no matter the consequences. The fifties male-dominated sport had become an activity for everyone equally.

This documentary goes in depth with some of the stars from the movies made (Cliff Robertson, Sally Field, Gregory Harrison, among others). And we also get some input from some of the original surfers from the fifties who give great insight on what it was like having the fifteen year old Gidget hanging around, learning how to surf.

This is a great documentary to pick up for fans of surfing, the Gidget movies, or just to learn more about one of America's greatest historical times. The film looks great, shot in full frame with a great surfer music instrumental soundtrack. The extras on the DVD are based around the surfers in the film, and some extra footage.

Extras:
Jamie Budge
Rohloff on Rohloff
Extended Ending
Gidget and Rabbit at Duke's

Pick this up for some surfin' sunshine beach love!

4620452,3,B005966N06,"Great historical footage from the early days of surfing at Malibu. Those familiar with the book will enjoy meeting the ""real"" versions of the characters. And, no, the real Gidget looks nothing like Sandra Dee. Much cuter! My only objection is that there is a lot of repetition and redundancy. A better editing job would have made it shorter, but tighter.",1366156800,,354,4.819672131147541
4620453,5,B005966N06,"My wife has never been on a surfboard in her life while I have surfed for 47 years. I got this DVD because I am aware of Kathy's environmental work and also interested in the story beyond the movies and tv shows. As a surfer, the movie was engrossing as it featured a who's who of surfers from the early days who all knew ""Gidget"" and it was interesting to see how this young girl got involved with famous surfers who were instrumental in the sports early days as well as her relationships with those that were on the entertainment side (movies, tv) of the Gidget story. Even more important was the reaction of my wife who enjoyed this equally as much as I did. It's one of those movies that when you realize it's coming to an end wish it would keep on going.",1333411200,13,759,4.241379310344827

4620455,4,B005966N06,"Dawn Hunt, DVD Verdict --Narrated by Jorja Fox (CSI) and featuring interviews with Sally Field (Brothers and Sisters) and far too many pro surfers to name, Accidental Icon: The Real Gidget Story tells the tale of Kathy Kohner Zuckerman who began surfing in 1956. Nicknamed ""Gidget"" (a combination of girl and midget) she became an icon whose legacy endures.

The decision to focus on the impact of Gidget over the past five decades was the smartest move the filmmakers made, because the actual story of how Kathy Kohner became Gidget takes less than a minute to tell. Fifteen-year-old Kohner was looking for a way of life and a group of people to fit in with. Going to Malibu and hooking up with the local surf scene was the answer. She became so enamored with the people, what they were doing, and the new lingo (words like ""Bitchin!"" and ""Cowabunga!"") she felt it was a story that needed to be told. Kathy started by writing it all down in her journals, one of which she reads from here. But she wanted to go bigger, to share her story with more people, so she went to her father, Academy Award-nominated screenwriter Frederick Kohner (Gidget), who captured the story as she told it to him. The rest is the meat of this documentary.

Accidental Icon is not people gushing over Gidget for an hour. Sure, there's some of that, but these are real people and their stories resonate as such, with Gidget's friends admitting they resented the release of first the book and later the movie because each was one step away from the reality of what it meant (and still means, in many cases) to be a surfer.

Accidental Icon was shot on Mini-DV and includes Super 8 film stock, so the quality isn't the greatest. However, you can easily overlook whatever grain and palette issues there are due to the engaging nature of what you're watching. The Dolby 2.0 sound is serviceable and the filmmakers took care to get interviews in spots away from distracting ambiance. The special features are mostly padding, including an extended ending to the piece, as well as an outtake.

4620456,4,B005966N06,"Any fan of the 1960's, surfing, and pop culture history will love this documentary about the original surfer girl - Gidget!  From the earliest days of surfing to the hot young ladies who ride the waves today (and get paid for doing so!) this documentary looks at the story of one of the first gals who saw what the boys at the beach were doing and said, ""I can do that!""  Who knew that the famous book, movies, and tv shows were all based on a little lady from Malibu named Kathy?  Lots of great retro beach footage & interviews with legends of the waves, modern day pro surfers, Academy Award winners Sally Field and the late Cliff Robertson, and narrated by Jorja Fox (from CSI).  An entertaining and educational DVD the whole family can enjoy!",1317168000,11,746,4.463235294117647

8462773,5,B005966N06,"I am adding this review from my perspective as a journalist who has devoted four decades to coverage of diversity issues. And I'm writing this in summer 2017 as the new Wonder Woman movie has debuted and touched off a surprising level of inspirational writing about the emergent roles of all the women involved in that comic-book-inspired movie. Sometimes ground-breaking diversity bursts into American culture in unexpected ways.

That's certainly true of the Gidget francise, which included at least four feature films that still are in circulation, plus the very popular Sally Fields TV series (the later TV revival series, at this point, isn't available). It's easy to look back nostalgically at the original novel (updated in a 2001 edition)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gidget/dp/B001QTV4OU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gidget</a>, then to dismiss the whole franchise as cheesy and dated in terms of its attitudes.

And that is the eye-opening value of this documentary in which a range of women surfing professionals talk about the way Gidget broke open conceptual barriers for themwhether they knew there was a ""real"" Gidget or not. Also, Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman appears throughout this documentary and explains how, as the ""real"" Gidget, she discovered this idealistic experience on the beach, then translated these surfing stories to her father, author Frederick Kohner. Turns out, the surfer guys were real young men (although Kathy and her father felt free to recast the characters in various ways in the novel). As amazing as it sounds, Kathy was able to make her way as a kind of ""little sister"" to these guys and was able to break into the somewhat esoteric world of surfing culture.

This documentary really did open my eyes, as a journalist, to this boundary-breaking cultural milestone. Plus, it's just downright fun to see the historical photos from Kathy's life, from the various movie and TV productionsalong with commentary on how the whole story evolved. Important historyand just plain enjoyable viewing.",1496793600,3,2071,5.526813880126183

It was great reading about it from a girl (and that makes it special) who lived through it. This was the story that helped create the Gidget movie, with Sandra Dee and the TV series Gidget, with Sally Field, who was 16 at the time (and made my heart flip!).
