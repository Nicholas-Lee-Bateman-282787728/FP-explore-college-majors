It goes from campy and lighthearted to dark and mean-spirited with wild abandon, showing no interest in maintaining any sort of consistent mood or style.  The story is the flimsiest excuse to string together a series of stomach-churning set-pieces that push the gross-out factor to unprecedented lengths.

A woman has her face bashed in with a rock while waiting for a train.  Her assailant steals her purse and leaves her for dead.  This sets into motion a curse that causes its victims to barf up worms, centipedes, maggots, eels, blood, pus and gallons of black slime.  Pretty darn gross.  The story really goes nowhere and there are long, boring periods between the puking scenes, but there is some decent atmosphere and the whole thing is obviously intended to be nothing more than a gory freak show.

For decades this was a near impossible to find movie, available only as a barely released VHS from Video City or as a bootleg.  Apprehensive Films' recent special edition DVD-R unfortunately appears to have been transferred from said VHS release, as it is cropped (severely) and the darker scenes are almost unwatchably murky.  A far better version exists somewhere, as there are clips available on Youtube that are widescreen and have far better picture quality.

Regardless, don't expect the Criterion treatment for this one any time soon.  A fuzzy, cropped copy of this movie will do a serviceable job getting across the insect zoo regurgitation scenes.  Just lay off the lo mein while watching it.",1362096000,2,1587,4.943396226415095

Apprehensive films should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such a trash transfer. If you can not do something right, do not do it at all. You have lost yourselves a customer there Apprehensive.",1347408000,3,462,4.191011235955056
8495336,3,B0069K5WSU,"Apprehensive films does it again! Bringing this gut buster to dvd after all these years! I remember watching this old gem on vhs tape back in the late 80's.  This film has people with snakes, eels, maggots, reptiles, etc. oozing out of their mouths. They vomit these yummy snacks up when they are confronted by the She Devil. This is a no brainer if you want pure geek value!! I do not believe there are special effects in this film this is the real deal! So if you are eager to watch horror with a slate of Fear Factor stunts this stinker is for you!!",1330300800,2,552,4.257142857142857
