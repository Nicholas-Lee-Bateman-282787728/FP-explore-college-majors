7816543,4,6301886577,"Of course the other reviews have already included the spoiler details, I surely wish they hadn't as I would have loved to have watched the movie with zero premonition of what to expect.

That said, I will not go into the details of that particular storyline here and instead critique the movie in general.

Sophia looks ravishing both as the young mother in the beginning of the movie and looks amazing as the mature middle aged woman in the rest of the scenes.
Her acting has improved markedly in this movie, compared to her wooden dialogue deliveries from Lady L or Breathe of Scandal days.
Not to say I am not smitten by this gorgeous artist actress of all times. I absolutely love her and have watched every movie she has ever made.
I felt her screen presence in this movie, especially in the first 30minutes of the movie was quite refreshing.

The movie is set in 1970s Montreal and that lends to a very chic, urban, cityscape. The influence of the french feel adds to the arthouse effect and makes the movie a very delectable one indeed.

The other characters of Ben Kincaid, Hogan, Coco, Jean LeBrecque are interesting.

But my biggest issue with the movie was the actual incestual situation, which really cannot be labelled as such, since neither of them really were aware of their relationship. THe son never gets to find out (at least in the film, even at the very end, as to the true nature of the relationship of Sophia and himself).

Sophia begins to doubt this, only at the last 15minutes of the movie...

I also had trouble in believing the strong feelings Sophia develops at the mere sight of this buther boy, with rather bad teeth and terrible hair, that shows up at the restaurant with a large caracass over his shoulder.

I personally would have fainted at the sight of a dead animal that up close and personal, rather than falling instantly in love with the fella carrying it.

They could have spent a little more time in developing that initial phase.

But other than that, this movie should be watched.",1362614400,,2024,4.597222222222222
