8732582,3,B0153T09EO,"I have 4 other DVDs by Alvaro and love them.  He is fun to watch and offers much to learn about his particular style.  His first DVD from Havana is his usual best.  I'm sorry to say this second Havana effort falls short of his best work.  He is his usual happy and sharing self but the work in at least two of the demonstrations fails to measure up to his best typical efforts, all in my humble opinion, of course.  I'll continue to study him as his style is pretty much the way I like to paint.",1451433600,,495,4.010204081632653
