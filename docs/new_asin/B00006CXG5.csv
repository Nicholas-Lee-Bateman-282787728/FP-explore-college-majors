1743888,5,B00006CXG5,"the overall score i will give is certainly 5 out of 5.
this is a set of 10 horror movies, lots from the seventies, for a really cheap price.  I will list each one and the rating i gave it.
KILL BABY KILL -  5 out of 5
  this is a MARIO BAVA film.  he is one of the best Italian horror movie directors -in my opinion second to argento.  this is one of my favorite movies by him.  The beautiful red and green foggy colors make the atmosphere of the movie just sweet. and the story is gripping.  starring the sexy and lovely Erica Blanc (as do two other movies in this set.)
DEVILS NIGHTMARE - 5 out of 5
  this is one of the most impressing of the movies in this set.  had a hot lesbian scene, and Erica Blanc again starred. this time as an evil, seducting succubus.  she will scare you and make you fall in love.  just really fun.
GOD TOLD ME TO - 2 out of 5
  it seems like lots of people really liked this one.  interesting I guess, but really corny.  I didn't really like it.
GOOD AGAINST EVIL - 2 out of 5
  this one had a fun story to it, and likeable characters. but it kind of ended in the middle.  i think it was an opening pilot to a television series.  worth watching once if bored.
PIECES - 4 out of 5
  another college campus slasher film, but really funny.  it also had lots of gore and nudity along with bad acting.  I liked it alot -and it will even keep you guessing.
KISS ME KILL ME  - 5 out of 5
  maybe my personal favorite out of this set.  it is also released on amazon as BABA YAGA.  this was a tripping, groovy ride of a film.  the soundtrack was awesome-the main actress was cool and beautiful - the style was really neat.  a sexy movie and I loved it.
SATANS SCHOOL FOR GIRLS  - 3 out of 5
  this was an interesting movie which lacked in gore and style as well as sexiness.  it had a lot of pretty girls, but it was all relatively boring to watch.  so watch it once for the story and thats it.
THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE - 0 out of 5
  seriosly this was a GREAT movie with 5 out of 5 potential. but this was the most frusterating movie of the set.  because it was butchered to pieces.  third one with ERICA BLANC who plays a sexy ghost, but most of her scenes are cut out becuase she is naked in them.  no---  .  still i really enjoyed watching this giallo and i am going to try to get my hands on the unbutchered version
CATHYS CURSE - 1 out of 5
  this one was just really bad quality,  the movie was from the 70s so there is no excuse.  not to mention the story was dumb and disturbing.  maybe a little like exortist in the way you really feel horrible for  a little girl.  not my cup of tea.
THE GHOST - 4 out of 5
  a really old horror ghost mystery which has great acting and a good story.  very stylistic too.
so this set is really a bargain for a few great movies and just the enjoyment of watching all the others.",1064275200,19,2858,3.929701230228471
1743889,5,B00006CXG5,"In a bargain package such as this, you can't expect ten out of ten amazingly good movies; there are a few duds thrown into the mix on Fright Night, but these are more than offset by some really, really good horror movies that can be hard to find on their own.  Don't expect any extras here because you won't find any; Fright Night is all about the movies.  The real gem of this bunch is God Told Me To, an independent film of great power and complexity; this is the movie you want to pop in the drive whenever someone tells you that there's no such thing as a well-made indie horror film.  Pieces is a bad horror movie lover's dream come true, topping off a buffet of blood and gore with two of the most surprising and outlandishly hilarious final twists I've ever seen.  One must also point out the fact that you have here not just one, nor even two, but three Erica Blanc movies.  Erica Blanc is one of the most striking queens of European horror, and fans who are unfamiliar with this actress should quickly seek out some of her movies.  Blanc plays a sultry succubus in the Belgian film Devil's Nightmare, but she is much more impressive (though, sadly, more fully clothed) in Kill, Baby, Kill, an excellent horror film evoking a strikingly Gothic atmosphere.  Blanc also appears in The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave, but what I am about to say is of the utmost importance: while the Fright Night package lists the film's running time as 103 minutes, the version included here is actually the butchered, 88-minute version that is really not worth watching at all.  All of the erotic and even reasonably horror-laden scenes are cut out, and all you get here is a travesty of an otherwise good movie.  Acclaimed British horror siren Barbara Steele stars in The Ghost, a really good atmospheric horror film featuring a welcome twist at the end.  Kiss Me Kill Me is a European horror film that may not appeal to everyone but which I found quite enjoyable.  The last of the good films is Satan's School For Girls, a made-for-TV movie featuring two of Charlie's Angels that is quite surprisingly effective and impressive.
Now for the bad news.  Cathy's Curse is a thoroughly insufferable film of embarrassingly bad video quality; if you like watching a little girl stare at things a lot, maybe you'll enjoy the film, but I couldn't wait for it to end.  Then there is Good and Evil.  Now this film seemed to be developing into something pretty good; after I learned to accept the presence of Dack Rambo in a horror film, I started getting into the story: a girl has been unknowingly raised to be the demon Ashteroth's future wife; ironically, the demon needs a virgin bride.  She falls in love, a priest figures out that she is an evil spawn and tries to stop the marriage, a revelatory exorcism is performed on a related little girl, the demon bride is hidden away from and pursued by good guy Dack, and then - the movie ends.  I have never been so shocked in my life to see credits start to roll.  Good and Evil was shot for television, and I can only assume there was supposed to be some kind of follow-up movie planned because this stinker just stops right in the middle of the story with absolutely nothing settled in terms of the plot.
In my opinion, as you can see, there are seven good to great horror movies in Fright Night, and these as a whole more than make up for the surprisingly few disappointing films in this package.  The Euro-horror contributions are particularly effective, serving as a great and inexpensive way for American fans to acquaint themselves with Europe's more Gothic style of horror.",1052870400,15,3618,4.548536209553158
1743890,4,B00006CXG5,"A couple of these are really pretty good and all are worth watching if you're one of those people who'll watch almost any horror film once.
""God told me to"" is the best film of all, though one reviewer apparently didn't get it.  I would feel comfortable recommending it to most people.
I will watch all of these again some time, and that, combined with the price makes this worthy of recommendation.
If you only like the cream of the crop, dislike older films, or dislike foreign films, stay away.",1043625600,5,497,4.522222222222222
1743891,3,B00006CXG5,"I actually thought that this DVD release had something to do with the mid-80s movies, ""Fright Night"", & ""Fright Night II"", therefore I expected vampires, and plenty of them. Instead, what I got was the following movies:
Kill Baby Kill
Deivil's Nightmare
God Told Me to
Good Against Evil
Pieces
Kiss Me Kill Me
Satan's School for Girls
The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave
Cathy's Cure
&
The Ghost
These films are a mixed bag, some from Italy, others from the US. All predate the 1980s but nothing special. Almost all have been on video here in Australia before
Kill Baby Kill was boring
Deivil's Nightmare has mild lesbian scenes
God Told Me to is strange
Good Against Evil is boring
Pieces has a man chainsawing women, pretty yukky!
Kiss Me Kill Me was strange about a witch seducing a fashion photographer, and doing someting evil to her camera
Satan's School for Girls (the 1973 version with Kate Jackson - who was later in the tv series Charlies Angels - not the 2000 version)
The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave yawn
Cathy's Cure is about a girl who turns evil after being possessed by a demonic doll

7967418,2,B00006CXG5,"Kill Baby Kill - this is atmospheric and full of beautiful scenery.  A coroner travels to a small, ""cursed"" town to conduct an autopsy of a supposed murder victim.  He discovers witchcraft.  I think this was directed by Bava if I remember correctly.  It's tedious in the extreme, though it does get fairly good towards the end, but still it's hard to sit through the first hour.

Devil's Nightmare - Some tourists are staying in a castle, and each of them represent one of the 7 deadly sins.  They are killed in ways that play off their sins.  Some are a little bit interesting.  I think this had a long and fairly boring lesbian love scene in it.  Overall, dull.  I fell asleep about three quarters of the way through.

God told Me To - A police inspector investigates a rash of mass murders, and in each the perpetrator says that ""God told me to"".  Not as boring as the rest, but the plot isn't believable at all and it's just sort of a big muddled mess.

Good against Evil - this is a '70s made for TV movie that was obviously the pilot for a possible television series.  A couple fall in love, but the woman is controlled by dark forces and whisked away by some evil guy.  Her boyfriend goes in search of her.  Then it ends.  I guess there was supposed to be a bunch of TV episodes where the conclusion was eventually reached.  Pretty boring, though not as bad as some of these.  Needless to say, the ending - or lack thereof, is a complete letdown.

Pieces - Well, at least this one has hot babes in it.  A serial killer stalks a college campus, killing various girls.  Not too boring at all, just low budget.

Kiss Me Kill Me - aka Baba Yaga, probably the worst piece of [...] in this collection, and that's really saying something.  Some girl meets a weird woman, takes some topless pictures of her friend, goes to meet some guy and they chat.  I turned it off at this point, I was bored out of my skull.  Pretentious art film, if you can watch this you can watch pretty much anything.

I haven't watched the last 4 movies in this set, but I don't hold out much hope that they would bump my rating up.  Overall, even for the price, this isn't a bargain.  For the most part these movies are painfully boring to sit through, and I actually have to say that it would probably be more enjoyable to just channel surf through your cable TV lineup on any given night of the week than to endure these things.",1169164800,2,2407,4.286666666666667

7967421,5,B00006CXG5,"FRIGHT NIGHT is a great 10-movie collection for a low price! KILL BABY KILL- Is a poorly named gothic chiller about a strange little girl who causes people to commit suicide just by seeing her. She has cursed the townfolk for watching her die some years earlier. Creepy! DEVIL'S NIGHTMARE- Erica Blanc is a succubus who shows up at an old castle to fulfill her own curse. Fortunately for her, a busload of tourists has just been stranded with her! Happy hunting! GOD TOLD ME TO- A classic Larry Cohen flick about a series of senseless slaughters with a very bizarre connection. Yep, you guessed it, all the murderers say that God told them to do it. Excellent! GOOD AGAINST EVIL- Satan's daughter grows up and tries to lead a normal, non-satanic life. Ha! No chance! PIECES- Abused boy grows up into chainsaw-wielding maniac. Gruesome, but good! KISS ME KILL ME- (aka: Baba Yaga) Beautiful photographer gets involved with a kinky witch, who introduces her to... well, kinky stuff! Weird and wonderful! Watch for the killer S&M doll! SATAN'S SCHOOL FOR GIRLS- Uppity girls school is actually a breeding ground for future satanists of America. 70s made-for-tv movie. Stars Kate ""Charlies Angels"" Jackson and Cheryl Ladd (under an alias) in a tiny role. THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE- Another Erica Blanc movie that should be great, but suffers from film mutilation! Yikes! The original ""ghost"" is a fully naked woman. This version is G-rated, so it makes almost no sense at all! CATHY'S CURSE- Strange tale about a little girl, possessed by her dead aunt. She wreaks havoc on her own family and others! THE GHOST- Barbara Steele is fantastic as the cheating, greedy wife, in this story of evil and betrayal! She plots with her husband's own doctor to bump him off! The trouble is, hubby just won't stay dead! Very good spooker! OK, there you go. FRIGHT NIGHT is perfect for your next halloween marathon! Enjoy...",1088294400,17,1919,4.80060422960725

7967423,3,B00006CXG5,"Woohoo! Another Brentwood cheap 10 movie set.  Mine had a little problem but maybe you'll be luckier?! Here we go from worst to best (more or less):
(10) Satan's School for Girls.  Why do people like this movie?!? It has a great title and stars some Charlie's Angels but wow was it boring and pointless.  Sunny California is not that scary, come on.
(9)  Good Against Evil.  Made for TV nonsense.  A couple interesting, puzzling scenes early on, crap from that point out.  Good to fall asleep to.
(8)  The Ghost.  Really bad print on this one, lots of missing film.  An OK chiller featuring the famous Barbara Steele.  Classy  yet somewhat dull.
(7) Cathy's Curse.  This was way better than I expected.  Little girl moves into scary house, finds creepy doll, causes chaos.  Really cheap looking early 80's special effects add to the fun.  Horribly scratched and damaged looking print, however.
(6) The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave.  I'd like to see an unedited version of this one.  Good story, but horribly and obviously cut.  Erika Blanc looks great but I would think the uncut version has more nudity.  This version is a major tease.
(5) Kiss Me Kill Me.  Early 70's art damage that also goes by the title ""Baba Yaga.""  I missed the benefit of widescreen, especially on the opening credits which featured strange comic art.  There's a leather dominatrix doll for Chrissake.  Dated, weird, but pretty fun.
(4) Kill Baby Kill.  Mario Bava directed it.  Well-photographed, well-written, and you get to see a girl get whipped with a bunch of weeds.
(3)  Devil's Nightmare.  To my pleasant surprise, this one came equipped with a blood-splattered, busty introduction courtesy of Redemption.  The movie itself is not very gory but the story is brilliant.  Travelers representing the seven deadly sins die at the hands of a sexy female demon (succubus).  Erika Blanc twists her face up and actually looks pretty creepy as the succubus.
(2) God Told Me To.  Starts out with the infamous sniper scene and actually gets better from there.  Great performance in the lead as a cop by Tony LoBianco.  To my frustration, my DVD will not play the last chapter so I have not seen the end of this otherwise great movie.  Yes I am pissed, I will try it on my friend's DVD player but this still totally sucks.  GRRR
(1)  Pieces.  ""You don't have to go to Texas for a chainsaw massacre,""  heh heh.  Really fun 80's slasher/chainsaw insanity.  Graphic violence, nudity and hilariously large amounts of cinematic cheese make this one a sure keeper.
So there ya go.  I wish God Told Me To had played the whole way through, it could have got #1 on this list.  At least the set was cheap.",1076284800,33,2672,4.655913978494624
