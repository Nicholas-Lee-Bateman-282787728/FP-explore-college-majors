8299922,3,B001EYLBFY,"torture chamber with christopher lee in very little
of the film. not a bad movie just not good. he vanishes
in the middle of the film and becomes kinda slow. he
shows up again in last 30 or so minutes. quality isn't
very good. watchable. the dracula movie with cushing is
much better but not the best hammer movie ever made.
it's worth having for cushing and lee. i've had on video
for years and the quality is much better. no widescreen.
if your a fan of both it's worth having it not then not.
start with early hammer films with lee and cushing.",1341705600,,547,4.269230769230769
