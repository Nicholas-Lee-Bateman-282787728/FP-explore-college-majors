Awesome choreography, insane footage and the best boarders on earth doing some of the craziest tricks seen.  There is also a segment with the younger generation tearing the wake apart.  The video shows, also, female riders, of whom aren't as insanely skilled, ripping it apart with the best of 'em.  One of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, I purchased most every album from every band post viewing the first time.  I really don't think I can comment enough.  Just buy it.  There is no way you will regret it.  That is all.",1130889600,,611,4.592592592592593
