I love Cathe because she always targets the areas that tend to concern us the most.  I also, think it's great how much variety she puts into all her workout dvds. It keeps me coming back for more because there's no room for getting bored.  There's always a new way to try switching your workout routine up.  I will always recommend her!! She really knows her stuff!!",1423612800,2,467,4.333333333333333

8615909,5,B00FIC4XKI,"This workout should be titled, Great Glute Burn.  Youll get great glutes and youll get a great burn in those glutes along the way. This workout has some new exercises, mixed with some classic exercises.  The focus is on the glutes, but youll also work your hamstrings and inner thighs as well.

The workout details:

Warm Up  7:00
Workout41:30
Stretch6:43
Total  55:13
Bonus Chair  7:19.

Equipment needed:

Dumbbbells
Stability Ball
Slide n Glide Discs
Pink Firewalker Loop
Chair
Mat.

There are also several premixes, ranging in length from 46 to 62 minutes.  Since I love to workout for an hour a day, I am happy about the 62 minute premix, which includes the original workout plus the bonus chair.

As the workout begin, Im thinking, Oh no, not another quasi-intense metabolic workout with the infamous squats with 8 pound dumbbells.  About 15 minutes into the workout, my muscles were screaming, so much for quasi-intense!

Why I loved this workout:

*Dare I say because of the hover squats and low ends.  I hate those moves, but I love how they make my muscles feel.

* The exercise variety .  Youll do compound legs/glutes, glide discs legs/glutes, stability ball legs/glutes and floor work.  And if you're feeling extra peppy, you can add on the bonus chair routine.

* The instrumental music.  I find the vocals in Cathes music are distracting, so it was nice to just have music for a change.

*Cathes expressions.  She said a few times during the workout,  You aren't thinking about running away are you?  I need you to work!  Um, busted!

One thing to note about this workout is the cross back lunges.  You need to be really careful with these or you could tweak your knees.

 I felt nicely worked out when I was done.  Since heavy weights are best for me for changing the shape of my legs, I use workouts like this for a change and to boost my metabolism.  It is good to mix things up.

If you're looking for a fun and challenging workout for your legs, you may just love this one!",1383782400,2,1993,4.586894586894587
