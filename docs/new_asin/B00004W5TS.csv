7924882,4,B00004W5TS,"Vampire's Seduction is an early release from Seduction Cinema.  This short flick showcases the hot brunette erotica actress Tina Krause (aka Mia Coppia).  It's filled with lesbians, bad humor and even worse acting.  But it's all in good fun and I highly recommend it.  Watch out for Misty's sister Chelsea, too bad she wasn't in more movies.",1233187200,2,341,4.9298245614035086
7924883,1,B00004W5TS,"This is a terrible ""movie."" (I hate to even call it a movie because there's no plot or storyline - forget acting.)  It was shot on digital video and looks like it was done in one night.  A complete waste of time.",1110585600,,212,4.023809523809524
7924884,1,B00004W5TS,"I'm an .... I was sucked in by the title. I love vampire-sex films. This film has very little vampirism but lots of poor quality & plotless sex.
I had already decided, after seeing other John Bacchus lemons, not to buy any more of his films. I didn't know that this one was from his stable.
They are so formulaic. Excepting as mentioned earlier, this has so little vampirism. It involves primarily a rather ugly and seemingly retarded man spying on a lot of other people having sex.
This man just walks into some girls apartment and without her noticing, stands in the bathroom door as she soaps herself.
He is bitten once on the arm (that's the extent of the vampirism), and then goes and watches more people. There's the typical  John Bacchus feature; a woman in bath/shower soaping herself.
Thus the sex scenes aren't really connected to anything. Tina Krause stands outside in the dark waiting for him to report back. She dances around topless a bit, but has very little else to do in this film other then to die pointlessly at the end, having had a few scenes dancing, and being very bored.
Even the DVD bonus material (on the flip-side of the disc) is also meaningless as we see Misty Mundae in a long sequence not used in the film ""An Erotic Vampire in Paris"" which again features a bath scene. She bathes, as the she-Vampire comes in. The she-Vampire spends a long time brushing her hair before getting in the bath too. There's a little bit of breast-fondling, but no vampirism. More shots from some other film are used including a woman standing in front of a window and rubbing herself. There was no point to this either.
If you enjoy John Bacchus films you are the most easy to please person on the planet. He enjoys showing women (with inflated breasts) doing lots of dancing and prancing about, and very mild sex scenes, varied only by someone pretending to be a vampire or a demon. And of course, there's got to be a scene showing someone washing herself. It's like a moving version of a ...  spread (big boobs, high-heels, big hair).",1049846400,2,2048,4.547425474254743
7924885,1,B00004W5TS,"John Bacchus' early films are simply dreadful, none more so than Vampire's Seduction.  Tina Krause plays Dracoola, daughter of the vanquished Count Dracula.  She recruits Wally, the last of the Van Helsings and an utterly disgusting imbecile, to bring her the lesbians she craves.  Wally sneaks into a house and watches an unattractive woman shower and then rub lotion on herself.  Next, he spies on a sleepover wherein some girl's mother tells a couple of supposedly virginal young girls to forget about boys and then shows them how they can entertain themselves.  Finally, we have a psychiatrist whose unusual method of treatment for a woman who considers herself unattractive (for good reason) is interrupted by a pizza delivery boy.  That's pretty much it, except for the stupid ending with Dracoola and Wally.  Debbie Rochon plays a waitress but her talents are completely wasted here.  The movie is painfully stupid, incredibly boring, and amateurish in the extreme.",1045267200,2,972,5.185897435897436
7924886,4,B00004W5TS,"I won't bore you with a long review, suffice to say that the 'sleepover' section was undoubtedly the most titillating for me, not that the acting was top notch, is just that the scenario is rarely seen in films available in your local blockbusters! so a certain forbidden quality shone through with a little semi genuine innocence rapidly turning into full consent coercion by the young but wickedly intenioned mother",982108800,,417,4.9714285714285715
