2925166,5,B000USSHZW,"It's not surprising that Red Without Blue may make some viewers uncomfortable, especially those who are used to films that explore only the struggle and difficulties that transgender people face. And for the first 20 minutes or so of Red Without Blue, you believe that this is exactly the kind of film you are watching. But then, something remarkable begins to happen. This family that has begun the film in a state of chaos and dissention begins, against all expectations, to HEAL. The process is slow, and unfolds in remarkable and unexpected ways. A father who is at first distant and removed slowly rediscovers and comes to re-value the depth of the love he has for his twin sons (one of whom is now becoming his beautiful daughter). A mother who is emotionally brittle and at times even contemptuous of her transgender child gradually comes to accept the new reality that has entered her life, in part through the near-miraculous appearance of another transgender woman in her own Montana town who helps her movingly learn that she is not so much losing a son as gaining a daughter. And two brothers who begin the film having lost the deep connection of love and trust which has bound them together in the past slowly come to rediscover and re-forge that bond.

It's a narrative trajectory that few, if any films exporing the transgender experience have charted before, and you get the feeling that it's one the filmmakers themselves didn't see coming. Yet I believe the story this film tells is also a valid part of the transgender experience - the story of a family initially ripped apart by a new reality that comes to realize that the love that binds them is more important than the changes tearing them apart. That this film becomes a testament to the fact that families CAN heal, and that there are actually some trajectories in life that go upward instead of downward, makes this a film to treasure, and one I found deeply moving.",1195257600,22,1942,4.728613569321534
2925167,5,B000USSHZW,"I first viewed this movie at a premiere in San Francisco with the stars and filmmakers in attendance - it was such a fascinating movie that I knew I wanted to own it when it came out on DVD.  I ordered it from Amazon and thoroughly enjoyed it again.  This story of identical twin boys, one who grew up gay, the other who grew up transsexual and transitioned to becoming female, illuminates an interesting variation on the human experience.  Well-made!",1193961600,5,451,4.6125
2925168,2,B000USSHZW,"This documentary focuses on a set of male twins of which one is a gay man and one is a transgendered person.  It offers a very unique situation, but it's the precise rarity of the situation that may distance audiences.  Many viewers may leave this thinking, ""Gee!  I guess my family and I don't have it as badly as I thought.""  I just don't know how many families have both gays and transwomen in them simultaneously.  To the work's credit, the family members evolve and have dynamic changes.

David Leavitt has written books on families in which more than one person is gay.  The book ""Mama's Boy"" discusses a divorced mother whose son comes out.  ""Transamerica"" looks at how a transwoman interacts with family members.  Still, I am very concerned that this documentary has no universal themes.  After you see that there's a family much, much different than the 1950s model, then what does the audience do?  One can think, ""That was eye-opening, but now what?""  The work records some of the family's blabbing.  No one says, ""Uhm.  Well.  But."" Still, it sure did feel like it.

I hated the way socioeconomic class is left out of the picture.  This family lived in Montana.  How were the son and new daughter able to afford moving to either coast?  Many transpeople have difficulties paying for the desired surgeries.  The cost of that barely comes up at all.  These twins dropped out of high school, how did they get into college and why was there no talk of needing financial aid?  The Brandon Teena tragedy illustrates how not all transpeople have the luxury to move to tolerant cities.  Race is erased here too.  The son gets an Asian or Eurasian boyfriend and the interracial component of their coupling never comes up.  Being male aside, what do the son's relatives think of him dating a man of color?  This family is from Montana, a generally homogenous state very unlike the diverse California.",1191369600,12,1902,4.7051671732522795
2925169,4,B000USSHZW,"This is an excellent view into the lives of one family and their evolution into accepting one another as is. However, it is also a film that stayed with me for the wrong reasons. First, it was wrought with hypocrisy. The mother is in a lesbian relationship, whether she chooses to define it as such or not. The twins speak about their lack of acceptance from schoolmates and peers, yet when Clair mentions an acquaintance from school (Ladd/Rachel), Mark Oliver immediately says ""oh the dorky nerd kid who played Dungeons and Dragons?"" Clair expects immediate tolerance and acceptance from Mark, yet she is intolerant of his need to grieve for Alex and his ""twinship"" as he knew it and time to understand. In another instance, Clair has come out ""as a woman,"" but seems visably repulsed by Rachel's anatomy pic combined with the ""vagina talk"" that followed. She is speaking with Rachel about their commonality in MTF transitioning, then refers to Rachel as ""dude,"" at which Rachel visably winces.  The twins come across as rampant narcissistics who only live inside their bubbles and can't see anything from another's point of view.  There is entirely too much ""me me me what about me"" going on. I don't understand why it has not been made clear to them that they are struggling to accept themselves and need to love themselves first before they go seeking love. Their entire frame of existence seems to revolve around ""someone else has to love me and therefore prove that I am loveable,"" which I found infinitely depressing. Sure we all would like to be loved, but it should not define us, appraise us, and generally be the end all be all of our existence. They are self-absorbed, but without purpose. They appear to use each other to fall back on when lonely, while in the interim taking each other for granted. In essence, a very unhealthy relationship, not to mention the undertones of incest, especially as adolescents in the midst of self-discovery. It seems like the two can't be apart, can't be together, can't love anyone else, really, but can't love only each other. There is much more going on here and I don't think it is fair to ""blame"" gender and sexuality issues alone. The most profound line in the entire film, which would ""fix"" everybody if they really believed it is when the grandmother said ""the divine (kingdom of heaven) is within us; but you make your own hell."" Infinite wisdom, unappreciated as old grandma just blathering on while standing in the kitchen. Touche!",1430870400,12,2489,4.786046511627907
2925170,3,B000USSHZW,"I liked most of the film.  I think that the filmmakers did a great job but that it was difficult because the twins were both dealing with so many emotions and were essentially depressed for most of the film. So it was at times a huge downer- but I think real life IS that way.  I want to say that I mostly felt myself having a negative reaction to the twins mom for essentially admitting that she ""gave up"" when she had the divorce and that she ""chose"" the boyfriend. The thing that bothered me is that she was not at all seeming to be sorry about it and if I had two children who were both fairly depressed I would have to look within myself as a mother and I think she did not. I also think that by her not admitting that she's essentially in a gay relationship- it further adds fuel to the twins not feeling accepted by anyone but each other because she can't even accept herself.
Both of the twins are absolutely adorable and very attractive people and yet they have no idea. Clair is stunning and I think the way the two of them are towards each other is just lovely. I wish them both peace and a lifetime of happiness and acceptance.",1424044800,,1139,4.19634703196347

2925172,1,B000USSHZW,Very slow movie that never really picks up speed. I want to like the twins but they seem to be the most bland people on the planet! I feel bad for all of their struggles but skip this movie unless you are going through the same problems and maybe it will be more likable to you?,1420934400,,278,3.982142857142857

2925175,5,B000USSHZW,"Red without Blue"" pulls no punches; and I admire that--it grabbed my attention immediately and it never let go until the movie's end. The film is about a seemingly happy family that upon closer inspection and especially through the eyes and story-telling of inseparable identical twins Mark and Alex Farley, disintegrates to the point where the parents divorce, the teens use hard drugs and try to kill themselves and the mother ignores her responsibilities to the point where the twins have to be separated and sent to different boarding schools for troubled youth for two full years.

But this is also a poignant, memorable film about identity; and that is what makes it all so fascinating. Alex decides he wants to live life as a woman and his transition from male to female is candid without being preachy or melodramatic. Alex now goes by Clair and it's amazing to see Clair develop into a beautiful young woman with a true sense of confidence. As for Mark, he breaks away from his old identity; he now wants to be called Oliver and establishes a loving relationship with another young man named David. Mark also has the luxury of being able to travel to Prague to study art further while David teaches English in Paris.

The parents change, too. Scott and Jennie Farley divorce and Jennie's later relationships with Tim and subsequently Jennifer Jordan are both quite consuming. Nevertheless, I got the strong sense that both parents came to know their children better after Mark evolves into Oliver who is a fine young artist and Clair goes to Sarah Lawrence College. The rest of what happens to both Mark and Clair is best left out here so that you'll have something to look for when you watch this film!

Some will say that the film makes little or no mention of their financial status, or how Oliver's family reacts to him dating and then living with David who is Asian. True, the documentary could have addressed these topics--and more--but the film is so jam packed with details of their raw emotions and incredible, true life stories that to tackle those issues could have been a distraction from the major issues of a family in crisis, individual identities, relationships and people evolving to become happier and much better adjusted individuals.

The DVD comes with deleted scenes and commentary from the filmmakers. There are other extras as well.

I would highly recommend this film for persons interested in human identity and sexuality with an emphasis on gay and lesbian issues; and anyone studying the issues of transgendered people will find this thought-provoking as well.",1337904000,3,2597,4.8931818181818185

2925177,5,B000USSHZW,"This is an oddly fascinating and thought-provoking film that I keep thinking about.  It is about identical twin boys who have an idyllic early childhood in Montana, recognize their homosexuality, grow apart, become rebellious drug abusers as teenagers, attempt a joint suicide, are shipped off to separate boarding schools and denied contact with one another, and later reunite.  As young adults, one of the twins identifies as transgendered, which the other twin reads as a personal rejection, but later comes to understand and support.  The film culminates with Clare's surgery and emergence as a more confident woman, and shows Clare's acceptance as a woman by both her twin and by her parents.  Meanwhile, Mark struggles with finding a positive romantic relationship and preserving that relationship, once found.

Okay, that's a lot to pack into one movie, but it never seems over the top, preachy, or overdone.  The characters are all very real -- revealing their frustrations, anger, and vulnerability, as well as their tender sides.  In the beginning, Clare comes across as whiny and self-pitying.  Her twin, Mark, comes across as resentful and a tad self-centered.  Their mother comes across as frustrated and not-wholly-accepting of her son & daughter.  As the characters reveal more of themselves, they all become much more likeable and real.  Clare, in particular, is much more attractive as a person once she settles into her womanhood and Mark is much more likeable once he has accepted Clare as she is.

Clare and Mark must be very bright and very talented and somewhat well-off, as they don't appear to face financial struggles (Clare goes to Sarah Lawrence and takes a cab to school each day.  Mark is in art school.)

The film is very ""real"" and very ""intimate"" for lack of a better description.  It doesn't appear to be contrived or staged, and much of the camera work is done by Mark & Clare.  It gives you a behind the scenes look at their relationship, their struggles with family and parents and friends, and their personal struggles.  By the end of the film, I found both of the main characters to be intriguing and likeable, and the film leaves me wanting to know more about them and hoping that they find success and happiness in life.",1231113600,3,2260,4.920844327176781
2925178,3,B000USSHZW,"A fascinating and unique documentary about twins, one gay and one a transgendered. The hardships that both of them have to go through in dealing with life and with developing romantic relationships and friendships with their family and among themselves are worth watching. This movie makes a heterosexual person who is happy in her skin realize how good she has it and how confusing and difficult it is for someone who isn't in today's society. It's impossible to imagine how much harder it must be for a twin, one of a whole to deal with the entire issue. This movie is an interesting study into one's family struggle and the coming of realization that they are a family and the only thing that matters is that they must stick together through better or worse.",1195603200,,761,4.686567164179104
