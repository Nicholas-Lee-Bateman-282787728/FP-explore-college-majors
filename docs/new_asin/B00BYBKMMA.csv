8575554,5,B00BYBKMMA,"Writer/director Giuseppe Tornatore is highly respected for his films Cinema Paradiso, The Legend of 1900, Mal&egrave;na, Everybody's Fine, and here he opens a new realm to test his prowess - a story that is so well crafted that even after the film is over the resolution is not entirely clear: he respects his audience too much to make things completely tidy. It is rich in art, music, atmosphere, the underpinnings of the art auction world, phobias and more.

Master auctioneer Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush in a magnificent performance), owner of a vast accumulation of famous paintings of women he hides in a locked room, becomes obsessed with an extremely reclusive heiress Claire (the stunningly beautiful Dutch actress Sylvia Hoeks) who collects fine art and is living in a boarded up mansion left to her my her deceased parents. Claire suffers from agoraphobia (fear of strange places) which keeps her confined to her home: her only servant is Lambert (Dermot Crowley) who has never seen her. She refuses to be seen but hires Oldman to perform a valuation of her antiques and paintings and only speaks to him behind closed doors. Oldman has his own phobias: he has a huge selection of gloves he wears at all times, afraid of touching anything without their protection. Oldman also has a scheme with one Billy Whistler (Donald Sutherland) who attends Oldman's auctions and bids on art in a fashion that allows the two to keep the money private. Oldman also employs a young tinker Robert (Jim Sturgess) and feeds him pieces of mechanical findings from Claire's home: Robert is convinced the pieces when assembled will be an ancient android long lost to history books. Gradually Oldman spies on Claire, falls in love with her despite the enormous difference in their ages, and plans to change his life, and just when it seems their lives will change, the film takes a surprise turn which spins a spell with the audience and cannot be revealed in a review. Nothing is as it seems - so much of life is a forgery.

Tornatore is an inordinately sensitive writer and director and has graced this gorgeous film with a musical score (mostly women's voices) by Ennio Morricone. The cast is uniformly brilliant and it is very difficult to understand why this film has not raised a strong following. It is cerebral, intensely romantic, and fascinating on every level. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, January 14",1390003200,3,2403,4.901719901719901
8575555,4,B00BYBKMMA,"The Cinema Paradiso director Giuseppe Tornatores latest work is part thriller and part character study. To anyone who knows the conventions of thriller The Best Offer (La migliore offerta) falls short of classic status, being too lengthy (especially in the second half) and even predictable, but the star Geoffrey Rushs authentic performance as Virgil Oldman makes up for that.

Set in an unnamed city (probably somewhere in Europe), Virgil Oldman, an able but arrogant auctioneer, receives a phone call from a mysterious client, a young woman who refuses to show up before him. At first Virgil refuses to take her seriously, but later he is drawn to the mysteries surrounding the dilapidated villa she lives in, and the woman herself, too.

The contrived story cannot bear close scrutiny, and the relationship between Virgil and the young woman is not entirely convincing, but Geoffrey Rushs brilliant acting is something else, always credible and riveting. Jim Sturgess and Donald Sutherland lend solid support, and Ennio Morricones music and Fabio Zamarions cinematography is also a plus.

After all, this is a story about Virgil Oldman and his life, played expertly by Geoffrey Rush. See for his great performance.",1388880000,,1218,5.235897435897436
8575556,5,B00BYBKMMA,"This is an excellently crafted and intriguing movie, and an interesting study of obsession and desire.

After seeing it, I was reminded of Hitchcock's "" Vertigo"", which explores similar themes.

Geoffrey Rush leads an ensemble cast, as a successful art dealer/ auctioneer/ expert.

His story is one of obsession, and love found and lost.

The story is clever and engaging.

The music is excellent, and the settings are gorgeous.

Well worth a look!",1383609600,,448,5.068493150684931
8575557,3,B00BYBKMMA,"A spinster auctioneer falls in love with an agoraphobe, which is interesting, at times riveting. Then the story is explained away and trivialized. It was all just a con job, with--that's right--a femme fatale as bait. But that too is worth watching, as it is an interesting failure. You wonder how and why intelligent film people could allow a wonderful set-up to be ruined by the most hackneyed plot device in cinema. Why didn't they let the agoraphobe be real and focus on a truly novel idea, instead of opting for the predictable? Why did they bring the plot crashing to earth with a clunky twist, and then load the film with heavy-handed ironies about deception and forgery, when the real thing would have been twenty times more engaging?",1382140800,,742,4.75968992248062
8575558,5,B00BYBKMMA,"""The Best Offer"" is a drama romance genre film which follows the eccentric, obsessive and at times conniving antiques auctioneer Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush).

Oldman is renowned for his exceptional skill in identifying and valuing goods, but he at times operates to benefit himself to further enhance his plush but reclusive lifestyle. It is a challenging client though who peels back the layers of a man set in his ways and suddenly he sees a world beyond his own collection of priceless art.

The gradual but dramatic transformation of Oldman certainly presents the viewer with a feel good story, yet the vices of human nature should never be underestimated.

Rush is outstanding as Oldman and the entire cast are a unique collection of characters.

8575559,5,B00BYBKMMA,"When a wealthy (and very lonely human being) man receives a curious invitation, he will get into a spiral of mystery and suspense.

A wonderful script, a well expected game of cat and mouse, an enigma to be solved, in which the feelings will undermine his rational mind. Giussepe Tornatore is back again with this marvelous script, loaded of mirrors and distorted visions in which nothing is like it seems.

One of the best productions of the year. No doubt and go for it!!!",1377302400,4,474,4.630952380952381
