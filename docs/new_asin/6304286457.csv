825552,4,6304286457,"This movie just keeps getting better with the passage of time.  The one scene where Gator is cruising through town after losing a patrol car and is recognized by a local woman which then perfectly segues into him talking with his parents is absolutely excellent, top notch filmmaking.  Of course, the action scenes are very good also.  Finally, the way Gator takes care of the crooked sheriff without ever having to lay a hand on him demonstrates just how smart he really is.
In this day and age where certain groups are desperately trying to feminize men, this movie should be required viewing for all males under the age of 18.  Burt Reynolds (Gator) exemplifies how a real man acts and deals with problems.  The line, ""There's only two things in this world I'm afraid of...women and the po-lice"" is not only classic, but actually quite profound.",1032480000,11,848,4.741496598639456
825553,2,6304286457,This is o.k if your in the mood for it.  White Lightning is a quiet type subdud movie.  when you watch it you get kind of a dirty feeling of sweaty hot poor towns and smelly sweaty people.  there is alot of cigarette smoking in it and you just get a hot southern feeling of poverty.  People in this movie look like they need a shower bad especially Burt Reynolds.  But the acting is pretty good and overall I think it has a good story line but just don't eat a cheese sandwich watching it because the people are pretty rugged and dirty and kind of smelly looking.,979516800,,563,4.175925925925926

826166,5,6304286457,"There was a style of movie making in the 70s where heroes were villains and villains were heroes, and violence ruled without apology.  White Lightning is Burt Reynold's best work.  It's a hillbilly car chase black comedy but not really.  It's dark and nasty, and has its humor but the drama is pretty real as is the violence.  It's filmed in rural Arkansas I believe, and the location shooting doesn't hide the sweat and humidity and the general conditions of life there.  My favorite scene in the movie is when Burt and Roy Boone (Bo Hopkins) are delivering moonshine to a bar, and you hear the beginnings of a boogie riff as they are loading up outside, and when they swing the doors open, the volume of the music jumps up about 10 fold.  In the theater this was about knock your socks off volume.  A single girl is dancing to the music while the customers are fanning themselves to keep cool.  As the moonshiners make their delivery the bartender (uncredited) reveals he knows Gator (Burt's) dad all of this dialog shouted over the music, which never reduces in volume.  After this incident, Gator decides to burn his little black book where he's been keeping notes for his fed assignment - he decides the whiskey people are good folks and he only wants revenge on the sherrif, not everybody in the business.  When he throws his black book in a burning trash barrel, Roy accuses him of sleeping with his girl friend (he is) and Gator deliberately picks a fight with him just to give the book time to burn.  70s movies like this sometimes require multiple viewings to catch details like this, the what and the why.  Ned Beatty shaves his head and plays a much older man who ""run Bogan County for 20 years"" and sets the tone for the evil sherriff stories to follow.  But Beatty's J.C. Connors is no buffoon - he's nasty, sadistic, and thinks nothing of killing anyone making trouble for him.  Jackie Gleason he's not.  One of Beatty's few early serious roles (Nashville and Deliverance come to mind).  White Lightning is the godfather of the hillbilly / moonshine / car chaser of the 70s, but it's darker, more real than most of the slapstick that followed.  Dukes of Hazzard, Smokey and the Bandit and half a dozen other owe their genre to White Lightning.  Oh and Jennifer Billingsley, a very sexy actress who fits the part perfectly, and sadly didn't have a long career in films, is Burt's girl and she's more than just a pretty thing - she comes in downright handy when the going gets tough,  When you see Gator and Roy unloading and the opening lucks of a 12-bar boogie in a back alley, crank up your volume and experience what it's like to walk into a rural bar - the place was probably real.  Location shooting, the sweat is real.  A tremendously good film often forgotten.",1504051200,3,2781,4.55533199195171

827011,2,6304286457,"White Lightning, 1973 film

Two men are bound and gagged and sitting in a boat. Two men in another boat follow, on shoots the boat so it sinks! A man in prison gets a visitor who tells him the bad news. Who killed them? Later Gator attacks a guard, then runs away from the prison farm. He is caught. Can he make a deal to get out? Bobby McCloskey meets Federal agents and learns about direct evidence. He is given a speedy car and outruns a Highway Patrol car. Two girls talk to him. He returns home to see his mother. He tells his father of his plans. Gator goes to the Logan County Fair and meets a mechanic. [Does he talk too much?] Payments are in cash, no paper trail. [Carrying untaxed liquor provides jobs in a rural area.]

The Sheriff is warned about a government agent who is snooping around. Gator is chased by a patrol car but escapes! Later he meets the Sheriffs secretary and acts friendly. One man produces 3,000 gallons a month from his still. Plastic gallon jugs are delivered at a church parking lot. Later they visit a tavern, people talk about events. The next morning Gator swims in a creek. That young woman Lou joins him. The Sheriff is warned about a government agent. Two agents question Gator about results. Later he buys sacks of sugar (the ingredients for moonshine). Lou is questioned about Dude, she talks. The Sheriff is suspicious.

Gator and Dude deliver boxes to a tavern, there is a difference of opinion. Then a delivery goes bad! Gator is captured. But he is able to overpower his guards and escape with Lou. A woman saws off his handcuffs at a home. There is a funeral for Dude. Where is McCloskey? A young woman tells Gator what she knows about his brother. Then he flees after the Sheriff arrives. There is a chase for action. Car crashes do little damage! There is a spectacular car crash. There is another funeral in town.

This is a story of crime and revenge. It could have used a better story (see Walking Tall for a better movie). The brand of cars tells of product placement. While driving along dirt roads the cars remain free of dust! Did you notice other discrepancies? This is mildly entertaining, and educational if the events are accurate. While the Sheriff is the chief law enforcement agency in any county, what about the elected County Commissioners?",1463270400,,2306,4.5360576923076925

I love how this movie captures a time that seems to me to be long forgotten. The pool hall in one scene and the awesome cars and trucks in the others. Ned Beatty plays a good jerk. Pay special attention to Bo Hopkins and Matt Clark. I've seen Matt Clark in other movies, but none where he was this young.

so it's time for an upgrade if you love this film get this new blu-ray
picture & audio quality is much better than the old dvd release plus you get a new interview with Burt reynolds

Here Burt plays Gator McCluskey who is released from prison to help take down a crooked sheriff played by Ned Beatty.  The car chases (a staple of movies from this era) are excellent as are Reynolds and Beatty.

828216,3,6304286457,"There was a time when Burt Reynolds and Jack Nicholson were two of the most desirable leading men in Hollywood. It seems hard to believe now, given the divergent paths their careers have taken. Watching an older film like White Lightning provides flashes of the candle that once burned bright, yet Reynolds' perennial poor choices in films read like a litany of self-sabotage. Not just the bombs like Stroker Ace; but perhaps more critically, the starring roles in box office smashes that he inexplicably turned down: Han Solo in Star Wars, Garrett Breedlove in Terms of Endearment, John McClane in Die Hard, Edward Lewis in Pretty Woman. Damn! That guy needed an agent. If he had one, he needed a better one.

Here in White Lightning, his alter-ego of 'Gator' has a certain charm but wears thin, the direction cannot choose between Deliverance-style drama and Dukes of Hazzard-style fun, and the relatively strong supporting cast cannot save the film's hokiness, despite its sweaty southern realism.",1362960000,,1000,5.0606060606060606

Even worse is that before I received a shipping notice, I requested a cancellation. Guess what order the next two emails from this company were in? If you guessed SHIPPED, then so sorry its already shipped.. you guessed right .. and your prize is you can my copy of this movie...

I am to blame for being ignorant of the DVD formats. I also will put a little blame on the company and on Amazon as well. Other than the format being stated as PAL, they never mentioned anything about DVD Region Code. As for Amazon, you are just guilty by assocication in that you condone this type of selling. It amazes me that web browsers and applications can all but tell you which direction your facing when you are on the computer but no one picks up on the fact that this item is being sold to U.S. customers that cant use it.

I will be more aware in the future and perhaps just by my DVD's from Hastings or some other US only company where I am assured of getting something I can use.

828445,3,6304286457,"White Lightning (1973) features Burt Reynolds, in familiar territory, as Gator McKlusky, a car thief and moonshine whiskey runner, doing time in prison down south.  When his kid brother is found drowned in a backwoods swamp with weights attached to his body, Gator gets riled up, and looking for revenge, agrees to work with the authorities, and go undercover to find out what he can about the transportation of illegal moonshine whiskey (white lightning) in the country where his brother was killed.

Gator is released, and soon hooks up with Roy Boone (Bo Hopkins), a local moonshine runner.  After using his wild driving skills to run interference and keep Boone from being nabbed by the po-lice, Gator meets Big Bear (R. G. Armstrong), the leader of crew producing the white lightning.  Sheriff Connors (Ned Beatty), manages the illegal bootleg activities, and begins looking for a snitch, after being tipped that the Feds are conducting an investigation, and McKlusky is busted by Big Bear and his men.  Gator uses some subtle misdirection to escape, but takes a bullet in the process.  Fleeing with Boone's girlfriend, they take refuge at a home for unwed mothers, and Gator learns the reason why his brother died.  Suddenly the Sheriff arrives, and the film climaxes with a pretty extended car chase through the back roads, with a sudden and unexpected conclusion.

White Lightning, is a well acted and pretty realistic film, that does not try to do, or be too much.  Gator McKlusky is regular guy, who doesn't engage in any superheroic behavior, and Burt Reynolds' performance is spot on, and believable.  The action sequences are mostly limited to a couple of minor scuffles, a brief gunfight, and  a couple of nicely staged car chases, so don't expect any outrageous stunts.

Directed by Joseph Sargent, White Lightning does not take the dark violent path it could have.  The movie opens on a very disturbing note, with the murder of two young men, but never again displays that same kind of evil ruthlessness.  Vengeance and revenge, might be Gator's initial motivation, but once free, it does not seem to be a major factor.  McKlusky and Connors, never have a confrontation, which is interesting, as Reynolds and Beatty were also together in Deliverance (1972).  The final car chase has a lighthearted tone, leading to a finale that is a little anticlimactic, and perhaps unsatisfying, but sometimes realism produces that kind of result.

In the 70's, Reynolds would continue to find success behind the wheel of a car, in films like Smokey and the Bandit (1977), and the Cannonball Run series.  He would return as McKlusky in a sequel, Gator (1976), which he would also direct.",1267574400,2,2689,4.964285714285714

As always, the 70's movies reel me in. This one's no exception. I suppose because I was a kid then, I love remeniscing. I like the big cars, the old advertisements, the clothing and hair styles, the lexicon of the era, people smoking indoors.

There is also a sense of more space as there really was more space. Land, I mean. You see more woods and fields in 70's flicks. If you're lucky, you see an area undeveloped that you know is now covered in housing or industry. 70's films feel like family, too. It seems there were only so many actors to go around so you see the same faces in many movies from this time.

828517,3,6304286457,"Fresh off his Oscar-nominated performance in ""Deliverance,"" The Sideburn King of 70's Cinema teamed up with Ned Beatty again in ""White Lightning,"" an action-oriented story about fast cars, Southern justice, moonshinin', and vengeance. Reynolds is Gator, a prisoner who gets himself released on the promise that he'll drum up evidence on a crooked County sherriff (Beatty). It seems this sherriff murdered Reynolds' brother, and Burt's carryin' a grudge.

The film is a rather shambling affair; the plot meanders and we never really get a sense that Gator's got much of a plan. He just wants the sherriff dead. Think of it as ""Smokey and the Bandit"" without the jokes, the music, or Sally Field and you're on the right track. Nonetheless, for fans of Burt and good ole-fashioned 70's car chase movies, it works just fine on its level. It is certainly preferable to the 1976 sequel, ""Gator,"" for which Reynolds made his directorial debut, reprised his starring role, and more or less re-used the plot.",1140912000,,999,5.018072289156627

828611,3,6304286457,"While watching White Lighting (1973) yesterday, I couldn't help think a more appropriate title might have been Hillbillies, Moonshine and Pit Stains, as there were copious amounts of each throughout the film...written by William W. Norton (Big Bad Mama, Day of the Animals), who also wrote the subsequent sequel titled Gator (1976), White Lighting was directed by Joseph `No Time For' Sargent (Colossus: The Forbin Project, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three) and stars Burt Reynolds (Deliverance, The Longest Yard).  Also appearing is Bo Hopkins (The Getaway, Midnight Express), Ned Beatty (Silver Streak, Superman), Jennifer Billingsley (The Thirsty Dead), Matt Clark (Jeremiah Johnson, Brubaker), R.G. Armstrong (Race with the Devil, Dixie Dynamite), and Diane Ladd (The Wild Angels, Chinatown), whose real life daughter, Laura Dern, makes her first, silver screen appearance in an uncredited role as Diane Ladd's characters daughter.

The film opens with the killing of two young men (hippies college students, I suspect, given their youthful appearance and longish hair) in a remote area of the bayou at the hands of two police officers.  Well, turns out one of the boys just happened to be the younger brother of Gator McKlusky (Reynolds), who's currently pulling a stint in the local penitentiary on a charge of running (delivering) illegally distilled whiskey, aka moonshine aka white lighting.  Gator takes the news hard, tries to escape, but eventually finds himself in the position of making a deal with the feds, as both the gooberment and Gator have their eyes on the same target, that of Sheriff J.C. Connors (Beatty), the most powerful man in Bogan County, and also the one responsible for killing Gator's brother (the feds want Connors because he controls the lucrative flow of `shine in Bogan County).  The plan is for Gator to infiltrate the `shine operation in Bogan County and collect as much information as he can, but Gator just wants a shot at Sheriff Connors (vengeance is a dish best served sweaty, in Bogan County, at least).  The feds provide Gator with a souped up car and a slightly unwilling contact in that of Dude Watson (Clark), who hooks Gator up with local runner Roy Boone (Hopkins), which leads to local `shine maker Big Bear (Armstrong), and eventually Connors himself.  But therein lies the dilemma...you see, Gator is a good ole boy, so the thought of ratting on his own kin, making a living doing what they've always done (distilling and selling whiskey), makes him sick to his stomach, but his desire get back at Connors for his brothers death is something that can't be denied...

If you're looking for some good old fashion, sweat stained, engine revving, tire smokin', exhaust huffing, balls out visceral entertainment, look no further.  This was Reynolds initial foray into the `good ole boy' soon-to-be-his-trademark character, one that reached its pinnacle in the film Smokey and the Bandit (1977), as previous roles mainly included him playing Native American characters like Joe in Navajo Joe (1966), Red Hand in Blade Rider, Revenge of the Indian Nations (1966), and Yaqui Joe Herrera in 100 Rifles (1969).  Many consider this to be his finest on screen performance (I was always partial to his role as Paul Crewe in the 1974 film The Longest Yard), one that certainly agreed with him as he revived the character a few years later in the film Gator (1976)...this was also the start of his `quipping' in films...you know, that thing where he makes a smarmy joke, and then he's usually the only one who laughs?  I think my favorite scene in this film is the one with Gator and Dude in Gator's car, and the pull up to Sheriff Connors in town for a first meeting (for Gator, at least).  Gator knows the sheriff had something to do with his brother's death, so he comes off in sort of an antagonizing way reviving the engine of his hot rod while Dude nervously makes small talk with the sheriff.  Beatty's character gives the unknown man a good, long look as if to say, ""I'm the law, and I don't know you, but I've got my eye on you.""...either that, or he was hot for him...another great scene features R.G. Armstrong getting whacked upside the head with a boat oar...I felt that one myself...probably the most painful sequences involved Reynolds emoting in character about the loss of his brother, and trying to comprehend the reasoning why...I questioned this particular plot aspect of the film, but then realized it was necessary because Reynolds would have needed that extra motivation to force his character to work with the feds, going against his own peoples...that way he doesn't look like a complete sh*t...in this effort, they also had to make the villain, Beatty's character, incredibly vile as to draw away from Gator's betrayal of his people (I guess it wasn't bad enough he was a killer).  This is illustrated in numerous scenes, like when the sheriff is interrogating (torturing) Dude's father by shoving the old man's hand in a doorframe in order to get some information, letting his deputies manhandle Dude's wife, played by Diane Ladd, the way they did, or his derogatory comments about minorities and hippies.  One thing this movie has a lot of is exciting and well exercised car chase sequences.  When done right, the viewer can almost feel the pull of the gravitational force taking a turn at 40 mph and smell the rubber burning as the accelerator is punched to the floor.  And the stunts, for the most part, weren't over the top crazy, but strong, solid, and believable (the one where Gator partially lands his car on a garbage scow might have been the one exception).  One thing that seemed really strange about this movie was the obvious removal some of the dialog through post-production dubbing (they took out the swears).  I think this was done prior to the original release as to get a PG rating...I'm unsure if any scenes have been shortened in terms of removing violence or nekkidness in a further effort to satisfy the rating requirement, but I'd probably say yes...

One thing that annoyed me most of all about this release, and the reason I'm going three stars instead of four, is that there is only the full screen, pan & scan (1.33:1) version available on this DVD.  Why they couldn't include both is beyond me, but I guess the studio was just trying to save a few bucks and figured we wouldn't care...I noticed the same treatment for the film Gator, which I won't be buying unless they decide to re-release it with both formats.  The picture quality on this DVD does look decent, but, as someone else mentioned, it does appear a little too dark, especially during the shadowy or nighttime scenes.  The Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono comes through well enough, and in terms of special features, there's only a trailer for the film.

828613,4,6304286457,"Someday in the near future, perhaps, some enterprising young scholar will write a lengthy dissertation on Burt Reynolds's storied cinematic career. I know I would like to know how an actor of such populist appeal in the 1970s could plunge into the depths of ignominy by the 1980s and 1990s. Of course Burt is in the midst of a renaissance since his turn in ""Boogie Nights"" a few years back, reemerging as a sort of world weary Hollywood elder statesman of the type William Holden used to be a couple of decades ago. My ponderings about the ups and downs of Reynolds's career inspired me to check out a couple of his earliest films recently, and I started with the 1973 backwoods romp ""White Lightening."" Why not? I've already watched ""The Longest Yard"" so many times that I could probably reproduce the entire script from memory. And as for ""Deliverance,"" well, that picture is more of an ensemble effort than a vehicle for Reynolds. No, ""White Lightening"" is a good place to start because it develops in embryonic form the type of character Burt would cultivate to fullest effect in ""Smokey and the Bandit,"" his most successful film and probably the apogee of his career.

""White Lightening"" introduces us to Bobby ""Gator"" McKlusky (Reynolds), a renowned bootlegger currently serving his second sentence for smuggling hooch. Gator is doing his time in the stir the easy way, working in the shop fixing up cars and generally hamming it up with his fellow inmates and the prison staff. Everyone likes Gator and Gator tends to like everyone around him. Then tragedy strikes when McKlusky's sister shows up to tell him that their brother wound up dead in a swamp. Since their brother was a straight arrow and a college student, both are mystified as to why he would fall victim to foul play. When Gator discovers that a corrupt sheriff by the name of J.C. Connors (Ned Beatty) might have something to do with the murder, he walks out of prison with the goal of making things right. The authorities track him down before he gets very far, but his escape and the reasons for it bring in some federal agents and a dangerous offer. If Gator will go undercover and gather evidence against Connors's various illegal schemes, the feds will let McKlusky walk away from the rest of his sentence. Of course, Gator agrees to the proposal because he thinks it will allow him to seek personal revenge against Connors.

The feds tell Gator to go see one Dude Watson (Matt Clark), a parolee with a long list of liquor violations, as an in to Connors's action. Watson wants no part of Gator, however, but eventually goes along with the plan when he realizes he has no choice. It is Watson who introduces McKlusky to moonshine runner Roy Boone (Bo Hopkins), and before too long Gator is in like gold with this man and his girlfriend Lou (Jennifer Billingsley). Boone helps his new pal get work with big time liquor manufacturer Big Bear (R.G. Armstrong), a very dangerous individual who trusts no one for very long. But he comes to trust Gator, grudgingly, until a series of incidents reveal exactly whom McKlusky is really working for. Connors resorted to a little torture to divulge this piece of information, which results in the abduction of Gator and Lou by Big Bear's sweaty associates. Faced with certain death, McKlusky manages to escape (of course) and wreak his own brand of down home vengeance on the crooked cop. And he does it without the help of the feds or the state authorities. I'm not giving anything away when I say that the climatic scene involves a big car chase. You knew there would be a car chase, right? If not, you don't belong here!

I liked ""White Lightening"" even though the pace of the film tends to drag. Reynolds does a pretty nice job in his role, and even gets a few opportunities to show some range with in his scenes with Lou as well as in a scene where he talks about the pain of losing his brother. Ned Beatty plays the corrupt southern cop with great aplomb, letting us know his brutal nature without taking the character over the top. What really works in the film is the great atmosphere. It's obvious director Joseph Sargent shot the majority of the film in the Deep South. The dismal swamp seen in the opening credits, the gravel back roads hemmed in by vegetation, the claustrophobically small town, and the ramshackle buildings out in the boonies fairly screams ""THIS MOVIE WAS FILMED IN THE SOUTH AND WE'RE DARN PROUD OF IT!"" The set pieces and locations are so good you can practically feel the humidity and heat wafting out of your DVD player. And that's a good thing. It gives the film a realism lacking in other movies in this particular genre. Throw in the car chases, a few fistfights, and some southern humor and you've got all the fixings for a fun way to spend a couple of hours.

Unfortunately, the DVD version of ""White Lightening"" leaves a lot to be desired. The picture transfer is fullscreen, not widescreen, and the quality looks below average. How so? Scenes shot in the dark look really dark, so dark it's hard to see what's going on. Moreover, the only extra included on the disc is a trailer. While I don't always listen to (or appreciate) commentary tracks on DVDs, I would like to hear Burt Reynolds's comments on this movie. I'm somewhat of a completist when it comes to this actor's films, which in this instance means I want a commentary track. If you haven't seen it yet, give ""White Lightening"" a shot; it's far superior to the rather lackluster sequel ""Gator"" made several years later.",1112313600,13,5538,4.6479591836734695
828614,4,6304286457,"""White Lightning"" is an interesting curio from the seventies.  Call it good ol' boy chic.  I can almost be certain that this film didn't get much critical play from more fashionable circles but I'm sure the denizens of the drive-in understood.  This film has down home ambience that the Coen brothers would kill for.  At times the film's languid pace was a little too slow for my Yankee sensibilities but the pace picks up as the film progresses.  Burt Reynolds has an easy-to-take charm here that he seemed to have lost as he progressed (regressed?) into a box-office superstar.  Ned Beatty is effective as the murderous boss of the backwater Arkansas county but he doesn't overplay it.  Also good is R.G. Armstrong as an evil moonshiner.  This ain't classic stuff but it's good Saturday night light viewing fare.",1106956800,,814,4.8478260869565215
828615,5,6304286457,"Burt stars as Gator McKlusky a moonshine runner serving time in a Arkansas prison. His brother is killed by a corrupt sheriff (Ned Beatty), so Gator agrees to go undercover to exspose the sheriff and get his brothers killer. The action is awesome. Car chases, brawls and Burt's signature humor. The DVD transfer is good but sadly the film is FULL FRAME and not WIDESCREEN. I guess MGM figured only rednecks would buy such a film and didn't bother with a 16x9 transfer. And no the film is not edited the language was re-dubbed in parts of SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT also to get a PG rating, cinema was only PG or R rated in the 70's. The 1976 classic GATOR is the sequel.",1085011200,10,665,4.370967741935484
828616,4,6304286457,"I don't think this movie was edited for its dvd release. I watched it recently, and in my mind I put back in all the swear words that were re-dubbed. NO WAY could this movie have gotten a PG in 1973 if all that swearing had been included. And it was originally PG, not ""R"" or ""PG-13"" (which didn't exist in 1973). I'm an old guy, 42, and I saw this back in the day with my parents. I was 12 and we didn't go to R rated flicks as a family. And, as I wrote before, I own the original poster and it says ""PG.""
I still think the swearing was edited out by the studio just before the movie's theatrical release, to tone it down from an ""R"" to a more-profitable, family freindly PG. Reynolds had just gotten popular (from Deliverance, talk shows, and posing nude in Ms Magazine) and they wanted to change his new movie from playing only the drive-ins to playing in the family theatres. This kind of last minute fiddling was often done in the old days when movie companies wanted to get a certain rating (and is today, but usually for sex instead of for language).
If anybody out there has seen a version with all the extra swearing kept in, please write me and let me know when and where! And let's get that director's cut out on dvd if it exists!",1065916800,7,1241,4.175
828617,4,6304286457,"I don't belive this new release of White Lightning has been censored for dvd, even though it does show signs of obvious re-dubbing of rough dialog. The original release back in '73 was rated PG--I have the original movie poster, so I know this for sure. I believe the dubbing was done just before the film's original release, to tone it down from an R rating to a PG. Reynolds was just becoming a huge star and the studio probably decided that they could cash in more with a larger slice of the audience to draw from--in essence changing the movie from an adults only drive-in flick into one that could play the neighborhood theatres (and those new multiplexes springing up everywhere in the 'burbs) and which any teen or kid could see.
I saw this in it's original form, back in the day, in the theatres, and I am pretty sure it was just as we see it now on dvd (except it was matted). Definately a PG. With all the swearing put back in, I'm sure it would have had to be rated R back in the gentler days of the early seventies.
Still it would be cool to see a ""director's cut"" if such exists (or at least a widescreen instead of an open matte version). And if anyone out there knows the solution to the mystery of the missing swears firsthand, let us know! Joe Seargent--you still around?

828618,1,6304286457,"White Lightning is one of my favorite Burt films. Unfortunately, this DVD is a watered down version of the excessive original. Not that you need it, but most of the foul-language has been poorly dubbed over to words like, ""shoot"" and ""dang"".  One of the main character's deaths at the end of the film is cut  - you don't see the villain shot, you only see him after the fact. I wonder if this was the only available print that MGM could find in their vaults? In addition, MGM adds insult to injury by releasing a full-frame (pan-and-scan) version! Ouch! Quality of the picture is good, but that's no reason to plunk down your hard-earned cash on an incomplete version of this film. I'm sad.",1060992000,108,690,4.512
