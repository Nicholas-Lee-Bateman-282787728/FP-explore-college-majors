2043608,1,B0001YYNSK,"""Eliza"" moves to town while she looks for her true love as foretold in her horoscope. She meets a series of weirdos and outcasts residing in her apartment building, including Tommy Lee Jones' character, a disgruntled American Indian intent on destroying a bridge as a strike against the government. Eliza's only goal in life (and the main focus of this film)is to find her one true love; she practically stumbles over Jones whom she befriends, not realizing she's found her soul mate... Well, the hook sounds marginally better than what ends up on film.

This film is EXCRUCIATING in its attempt to be artsy - too many closeups of leering faces, abrupt laughter, and people prancing in and out of frame; it's lack of plot is downright nonsensical to the point of ridiculous while we keep wondering when an actual storyline will unfold. (Don't hold your breath.) No wonder Eliza doesn't realize who her true love is, her character embodies the mindlessness of this film; it's a wonder she can even find her way home after the end of a long day of ""searching"".  The sound quality is poor, but the film suffers from a lack of intelligent dialogue anyway, so you won't miss much. Jones can't save this sad mess - This film fell into obscurity for good reason. Give it a miss -

If you want decent early Tommy Lee Jones fare, try ""Jackson County Jail,"" ""Back Roads"" (with Sally Fields) or ""The Eyes of Lara Mars"" (with Faye Dunaway). Like many 1970s films, these movie styles are also dated, but Jones' talent shines through in them without the burden of wading through creative flotsam and jetsom masquerading as an art film one finds in ""Eliza's Horoscope"" .",1195948800,2,1655,4.7
2043609,5,B0001YYNSK,"The only movie made by a genius director from Canada, comparable from this perspective to ""The Caroussel of Souls,"" recently released by Criterion. This arthouse gem is an extraordinary blend of Fellini and Kubrick (you will be surprised to see what inspired him in his last movie, ""Eyes Wide Shut""). Highly recommended for all real movie buffs and connoisseurs, and not only! Criterion Collection should take a look at this brilliant work of art as well, and release it in the format it deserves.",1156809600,4,497,4.928571428571429
2043610,1,B0001YYNSK,"I have this on a tape that is nearly unwatchable, but I stuck it out and found it rewarding viewing.  I was excited to get this DVD, which I assumed even at a budget price and likely too heavily compressed, particularly given that the film runs an even two hours, would be an imporvement on that tape, but I was horribly mistaken.  The sound is so distorted as to be nearly indecipherable, and an unlistenable film is even worse than a difficult to watch film.  It's a shame someone hasn't seen the value of this film enough to give it a decent release.",1097020800,7,553,4.349514563106796
8018545,3,B0001YYNSK,Sound quality is poor.  Hard to understand what characters are saying.  No captions.,1510963200,,84,5.384615384615385
8018546,3,B0001YYNSK,Honesty i really can't said much about this movie to me its very low buget and the most exciting parts we the make belive sex that never showed anything but one naked womna at the end lol,1422835200,,187,4.081081081081081
8018547,1,B0001YYNSK,"Let's see, I've already bought one VHS tape of this film, and two other DVDs so far...and ALL of them looked like crap (AND had terrible sound!).  Now seeing as how this film is in the Public Domain, am I really gonna take the chance and spend eighteen dollars (with shipping) and buy yet another disc of this from these AFA Entertainment fly-by-night clowns who claim this is a remasterd and ""enhanced for widescreen"" version? Considering how lax Amazon is letting discs of questionable production obviously churned out on the cheap in someone's garage be sold on here with high-falutin' claims of being ""restored"" or ""remastered""...?

The answer is...NO!",1364688000,,656,5.009174311926605
8018548,1,B0001YYNSK,"Of all the DVDs I've purchased through Amazon this was the only one that was unwatchable due to both poor video and sound that dropped out completely....
Too bad since I'm a TLJ fan",1285459200,,181,4.352941176470588
8018549,4,B0001YYNSK,"I recall watching ""Eliza's Horoscope"" at a local theatre in 1970. I do not recall Tommy Lee Jones was the construction worker nor the  young lady's name. I remember he worked dayshift on a construction site (the bridge I read today a group of people would blow up?).

She (Eliza) seemed like a misplaced flower child, young,innocent and simple minded. She went to see a Chinese fortune teller in the big city (Montreal). I saw this 3 years before visiting Montreal for the first time.

I remember she took a ppair of shears and cut all her beautiful long hair off and the face of the elderly Chinese lady laughing hysterically as if she was seeing this tragedy omnipresently and the background onscreen was all red and black only!

This film is unique in the photography and special effects and I seem to recall nice,upbeat music as well. I enjoyed it!",1282435200,,852,4.622516556291391
8018550,1,B0001YYNSK,"Was this movie made by a high school drama club??????
I like Tommy Lee but this movie is terrible. The sound is bad and editing pathetic.
This is the only DVD I ever threw away.",1275955200,,177,4.085714285714285

8018552,3,B0001YYNSK,"DIGIVIEW's slimline cased DVDs feature unrestored public domain films that have no subtitles or extras beyond plot synopses on their back covers. As with all such bargain brands, dubs are ""best available source"" and can vary from very good to only fair. Audio levels are however some of the highest you'll find, which makes these ideal for laptop PC or portable disc player watching.

Richard Manuel, keyboardist for The Band is typecast in ELIZA'S HOROSCOPE (1975) as a hippieish composer.

The main character is an eccentric 18-year-old girl with a troubled past who consults Rose Quong (same), an ancient Chinese astrologer living in a Montreal tenement building. While waiting for her predicted true love to appear, Eliza (Elizabeth Moorman) rooms temporarily in this same dank flop house with Lila (Lila Kedrova), a 50-ish former white-faced pantomimist.

One of their neighbors is the anarchistic Indian, Tommy Lee (Jones). When not walking construction girders or drinking with his buddies, Tommy plots to dynamite a nearby bridge as a form of Native protest. He's attracted to Eliza from first sight and she does sleep with him occasionally, but the girl has her heart set on marrying a wealthy man.

Through a variety of outlandish costume and make-up changes over the course of ten days, Eliza meets a number of well-off weirdos. One of her new friends is a home movie fanatic who owns a vulgar life-sized centaur statue. During another episode, she falls in with a creepy cult that combines baptism and devil worship with peyote-laced baccanalian orgies.

An odd editing technique is persistently used here. It's best described as 'visual yips'. Often insignificant moments repeat themselves like a cracked 78, even as the audio continues along smoothly. The end result is more annoying than artistic or disorienting. Most interesting is Elmo Peeler's bare bones music score, a gently melancholy soundtrack in this, his only motion picture.

Mysticism practitioners, entrenched and/or latter-day hippies, plus fans of nearly unfathomable cinematic symbolism will find much to like within Canadian-made ""Eliza's Horoscope."" For the rest of us however this one's slow going at best. Try seeing it in a non-sober state.",1259193600,4,2227,5.259154929577464

8018554,2,B0001YYNSK,"I have to agree, with most of the other's users comments.  It was a bit confusing, and it helped reading their comments.  I personally, as you can see, from what I usually buy, dramas, cerebral movies, was kind of lost with this one.  I know this isn't much of a review, but it was great seeing a very young Tommy Lee Jones

I know this doesn't have anything to do with this movie, but for fantasy, I really enjoyed ""Skellig"" which was actually a children's book and then movie.  The actor who portrayed ""Skellig"", Tim Roth was excellent.

Eliza's Horoscope has to do with Indian culture, mysticism (which I usually enjoy) and death.  All in all, I was a bit lost.",1252800000,,664,4.43801652892562
