1628080,3,B00005N5RH,"This adaptation of ''Tale of Two Cites"" is a success in everything except the most important part--- capturing the tone and mood of the original piece. In the Penguin Classics Edition of ""A Tale of Two Cities"" the introduction talks about how the plot of the story, conducted on a very personal and small level, feels much bigger than it really is. The movie failed to capture that feeling of scale and hugeness that the book encompasses. The costumes, acting and scenery are great for all of the English scenes and some of the French. But in France, the Revolutionary world of the Dufarges is so badly done and the tone is so off that it was often difficult not to laugh. The ""mob"" scenes were unenthusiastic and done in a way that made you not only feel bored but also ""so what was the big deal?"" Perhaps in an effort to avoid violence, the whole Revolution is downplayed and the Dufarges seem simply insane, not part of a mob of starved peasants. This problem could have been avoided had there been better writing. All in all, this is a miniseries to watch only if your curiosity gets the better of you. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except those with special interest in the book and a mild interest to explore this adaptation. As I said, it's not all bad. But with better writing it could have been much, much better.",1009152000,48,1326,4.483471074380165
1628081,5,B00005N5RH,"I had to watch this video in class when we were studing the French Revolution.  I liked the movie so much, I decided to bet a copy of the book.

1628110,2,B00005N5RH,"Like most current productions, this is gorgeous; hence dull. More like a TV show than one of the most unforgettable & thrilling stories ever.

Dramatically, it can't hold a candle to the 1935 film version, which although B&W, is visually stunning  compared to this stylish fluff. The cast here tries hard but struggles to compete with the sets, costumes, make-up, hair, etc. This isn't even in widescreen; only 1:33 full screen.

1628113,2,B00005N5RH,"On the basis of the previous reviews, I purchased this item for my son and I to watch, as he's currently reading the book in high school. I've seen the British and American films (and the horrible TV adaptation with Chris Sarandon) but felt something was wanting, so I looked forward to seeing this. Alas, it is very poorly directed, which undermines anything the performers are attempting to do. The pacing is the same for every scene (glacial), there is no sense of drama or momentum, the crowd scenes are laughable, and, as far as the actual filming goes, any appreciation of the basics of shot composition and editing are sadly lacking. In short, I found this adaptation so thoroughly boring that I could only watch the first disc, and quickly disposed of the set at a nearby bookseller.",1402099200,6,791,4.697841726618705

1628115,3,B00005N5RH,"The part of Carton is well played. It is tempting for the director to use one actor for the ""look alikes"", Carton and Darnay; I appreciate the use of two different actors. Unfortunately, Lucy Manette comes across as somewhat lacking in personality.  She and Charles Darnay both seem to me lacking credibility - too 'sweet' and bland for the 2-DVD length of this movie.",1387065600,,368,4.75
1628116,5,B00005N5RH,"I am/was amazed that Charles Dickens could so accurately portray an alcoholic at a time when the word didn't even exist.  The movie inspired me to read the book.........several times now, gaining new insights each time.",1384819200,2,219,5.083333333333333

1628119,2,B00005N5RH,"Historical drama is definately my genre so I was drawn to this.  All I can say was that it scarcely held my attention...and I'm not that particular.  The acting was annoying and some of ""ze French accents"" were annoying and difficult to understand.  The leading lady, though lovely, used only one expression through most of the movie.  The female protagonist overacted her role which was emphasized all the more by the underacting of other characters.  It was difficult to follow; they drug out parts they didn't need to and didn't elaborate where they should have.  All in all, a very unsastisfying experience.",1370476800,2,611,4.9411764705882355
1628120,5,B00005N5RH,I thought that this story and movie version aptly depicted the insanity of the French revolution. The movie was richly cast with a lot of heavy weights from the UK and France and it is easily the strength of this film with very notable performances from James Wilby (Sydney Carton) Jean-Pierre Aumont (Dr. Alexandre  Manette) and Kathy Kriegel (Madame Defarge) The whole cast was just outstanding that helped deliver this powerful story.,1365120000,,437,5.069444444444445

1628133,5,B00005N5RH,"This is by far THE BEST rendition of this beautiful story. First of all, the actors who portray Sidney and Charles are completely believable. It is a faithful portrayal of the book as Dickens wrote it. Second, the actors who portray Sidney and Charles are the FINEST portrayals of these characters. The French Charles Darnay, Dr. Monet and the Defarges are really French actors (wow, what a concept). The actor who portrays Sidney is a tortured soul who loves Lucy so much it hurts. Furthermore, unlike other movie and made-for-TV versions of the story, the actors who play them are DIFFERENT people, as Dickens had intended them to be. The two are NOT supposed to be the same person, as is portrayed by those who don't understand the story. They're not related!!! They're supposed to just LOOK SIMILAR, be of SIMILAR build and hair color, which is why Dickens' story works so well. NOBODY - not Lucy, or anyone else who met the two of them, would ever have been STUPID enough to be fooled by anything else. I am a History teacher and have showed both versions to my students. The Chris Sarandon version, which is just AWFUL, put them to sleep, but the Masterpiece Theater version kept them enthralled. I highly recommend it!!!",1330819200,3,1227,4.711627906976744

1628135,3,B00005N5RH,"I was expecting so much from this production of ATTC that I must confess my disappointment upon seeing it.  I now own four film versions of Dickens' masterpiece and this is the least exciting of them all.  In spite of a good cast, reasonably fine art direction and a few scenes that make excellent use of locations with the adequate kind of atmosphere, the film lacks rhythm and true emotion.  Above all, this version is absolutely wanting in epic dimension.  The crowd scenes are ridiculously poorly staged.  One never has the feeling that the characters are immersed in a Paris that was witnessing the bloodbath of the French Revolution. Truly, the 1935 Jack Conway version still stands as the best cinematic portrayal of Dickens' classic novel.  The 1958 and 1980 versions place second and third by comparison, and the present one comes as a distant fourth.  Too bad.",1266451200,5,870,4.837837837837838
1628136,4,B00005N5RH,"This is a film I watched years ago in school as we were reading the novel. It has remained in my memories for over 15 years. When I found it on Amazon, I had to have it. The story is of extreme pain and extreme love. How far will the extremes go? how deep are the wounds of pain and how deep is the love that one man has for a woman he knows he can never have? how far will he go for her? this movie is very deep and emotional, one of the best Dicken's stories. This is a beautiful story, with beautiful actors and it is worth every minute.",1255737600,3,540,3.830357142857143
1628137,5,B00005N5RH,"Set amidst the turmoil of the corrupt governments of England and France, this story begins (after a flashback) in 1775 with the release of Alexandre Manette who has unjustly been in prison for the past eighteen years. He is reunited with his eighteen-year-old daughter, Lucie Manette, who believed herself an orphan. Though Monsieur Manette gladly adjusts to leading a normal life again, he is haunted by the thought of something he cannot clearly remember.

Charles Darnay is a French heir to much wealth, which he does not claim, due to the means by which it was acquired. Rather, he has chosen to earn his living by teaching, and in kindnesses to others, attempt to repair the wrongs incurred by his family. In one such instance of kindness, he meets the Manettes; their acquaintance grows into friendship throughout further meetings. Darnay's renunciation of wealth and position in France, donning a false name in England, and traffic between the two countries, cause each country to either dislike him or suspect him of treason. All of these things lead to tenuous situations for Charles Darnay.

Sidney Carton is a barrister of England, who, though very bright, is in general, bored with life. He is envious of Mr. Darnay because he holds the affection of the beautiful Miss Lucie Manette. Can he reconcile his love for Miss Manette, and his dislike of Mr. Darnay?

Aside from the characters already mentioned, A Tale of Two Cities contains wine shop keepers who lust for revenge on their French oppressors, a messenger for a bank who robs graves at night, Lucie Manette's opinionated, but faithful servant and friend, and various other characters, all intricate to Charles Dickens.

Although this is a story about people, it is also a tale of two cities, London and Paris, before and during the French revolution. It is a tale of loss and of gain, of violence and of peace, of revenge and of love. Perhaps it is best described by the opening words of the book it was based on: ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"".

This movie version is very well made and acted, and is very accurate to the book. I highly recommend both the movie and the book.",1255564800,4,2169,4.757978723404255
1628138,4,B00005N5RH,"Overview:
Film certainly contains more scenes than the 1980 adaptation (ex: Jerry Jr. is a character in this film). Secondly, the spirit of the film appeared more like Dickens' novel than the 1980 adaptation. Thirdly, the music in this film is quite good. Fourthly, Tellson's Bank is mentioned by name in this film. Fifthly, the Defarge's first names are mentioned in this film.

However, the 1980 adaptation does have one major advantage: the film contains far superior costumes and action effects (ex: the storming of the Bastille) than the 1989 adaptation. A second possible advantage is the ending of the 1980 adaptation is better done. (In this adaptation, the viewer does not really know when Lucie and Jarvis Lorry discover that Charles - not Sydney - is in the carriage.

Sequence [reveals plot in detail]:
Film begins with Dr. Manette writing from prison. Viewer joins Dr. Manette as the doctor is recalling those scenes from long ago pertaining to the Evrmonde brothers. Dr. Manette denounces the Evrmonde brothers, to the last of their race. Dr. Manette rolls up the document and hides the document in his cell.

[Road to Paris 8 years later]
Jarvis Lorry and Lucie Manette talk about how Dr. Manette was ""recalled to life.""

Wine cask falls and people lick up the wine. The Defarges watch. Gasper writes the word ""BLOOD"" on the wall. Monsieur Defarge erases the inflammatory word. Defarges emphasize that the revolution will come.

Jarvis Lorry helps Lucie Manette understand the political situation in France where the aristocracy can arrest anyone without providing any reason. Jarvis Lorry says he has more freedom than most people because Lorry represents Tellson's Bank. (Note: The 1980 adaptation never mentioned Tellson's Bank by name.)

Monsieur Defarge, Madame Defarge, and other associates talk about French nobility. Madame Defarge says the only nobility for the poor is cold, hunger, and want. Lucie Manette and Jarvis Lorry arrive at wine shop.

Lucie Manette is afraid to see her father. (Note: In 1980 adaptation, Lucie is not afraid to see her father.) Lucie Manette knows that Dr. Manette will be much changed. When they see Dr. Manette, the doctor says his name is ""105 North Tower."" While Dr. Manette does not recognize Jarvis Lorry, the doctor recognizes Lucie Manette by her blond hair (the same color as Lucie's mother).

Jerry Cruncher and his son - named Jerry, Jr. - arrive in courtroom for Charles Darnay's treason trial. Jarvis Lorry is present. Jerry Cruncher tells Jerry Jr. about what happens to someone who is found guilty of treason. When Jerry Jr. asks what will happen if Charles Darnay is found not guilty, Jerry Cruncher replies that the Old Bailey always finds the defendant guilty - a hanging, drawing, and quartering is what people pay to see.

Attorney General presents the state's case against Charles Darnay. The attorney general claims Charles Darnay is passing secret British military information to France. Charles Darnay does not explain why he has traveled for English to France so frequently.

Marquis Evrmonde lives his royal life with many servants. Evrmonde receives a letter saying that a servant will accuse Charles Darnay of treason.

Back at trial, that servant testifies that he saw secret papers by accident in Charles Darnay's luggage.

Lucie Manette says she saw Charles Darnay five years ago when traveling from France to England. Charles Darnay helps Lucy Manette with her father, who had been in ill health. Lucie admits that Charles Darnay had passed some papers to two French gentlemen before leaving France, but she could not be certain when the papers contained. Clearly, Lucie Manette did not want to testify against Charles Darnay.

When John Barsad testifies, Stryver points out how similar Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton appears. Charles Darnay is acquitted.

When leaving the courtroom, Charles Darnay is congratulated for his acquitted. Stryver says that many innocent people are hung or imprisoned. Dr. Manette appears absent, as though in deep thought, as he hears Stryver's words.

Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton go to a pub for a drink. Sydney Carton says he doubts Charles Darnay would ever want to trade places with him. Sydney Carton says he cares for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for him. Sydney Carton says he hates Charles Darnay because of how Lucie's eyes look at Charles Darnay but not at him (Sydney). The pair drinks to Lucie Manette.

Stryver scolds Sydney Carton for Carton's lack of energy or motivation. Stryver and Sydney Carton talk about Charles Darnay and how Darnay was so secretive about his affairs. Stryver and Carton talk about Charles Darnay's real last name is not Darnay (although they do not know what it is). They reference that, according to Charles, his family harbors a terrible secret.

Lucie Manette and Dr. Manette talk. Dr. Manette is uneasy because the doctor is certain that there is something he has done that may later cause Lucie harm. Lucie comforts Dr. Manette, by saying that they have each other. What could possibly harm them?

The Marquis' carriage runs over Gasper's son, killing the boy. The Marquis Evrmonde treats the crowd with disrespect. The Marquis gives Gasper a coin, which is thrown back at the Marquis. Marquis Evrmonde says he would gladly run over anyone in the crowd. Madame Defarge records the name Marquis Saint Evrmonde in her knitting.

Gasper attaches himself to the bottom of the Marquis' carriage.

Marquis Evrmonde denies an elderly woman her petition to have the Marquis place a tombstone over the grave of her husband who died of want. The Marquis appears indifferent to this poor woman's only desire.

Returning to his estate, Marquis Evrmonde is surprised to find Charles waiting for him. The two converse. Charles emphasizes the wrongs committed by the Evrmonde family and his (Charles') desire to correct them, as was his late mother's wish. The Marquis emphasizes his aristocracy, family royal obligation, and how it is a complement to be despised by the rabble.

Gasper stabs Marquis Evrmonde in the heart while the Marquis is in bed. (Unlike 1980 adaptation, in this film, Gasper must climb the side of the Marquis' mansion to reach the Marquis' bedroom window. Secondly, the Marquis is awake when he is stabbed. Thirdly, Gasper leaving the estate without being immediately caught.)

Charles Darnay and Dr. Manette have a conversation. Charles tells the doctor how he understands how attached the doctor is to Lucie. Charles further emphasizes that Charles loves Lucie and wants to marry her. Charles also states that Dr. Manette would always be welcome in Lucy's life. Dr. Manette replies that he believes Charles loves Lucy and tells Charles that if Lucy will have him, he will consent. Charles then desires to tell Dr. Manette about his past and his (Charles') real name but the doctor says to wait until the morning of the wedding.

Sydney works on case preparation at a public house while drinking a considerable quantity of wine.

Stryver assesses Sydney's work, and believes the work was well done. Stryver, however, has one suggestion for Sydney. Stryver urges Sydney to find a wife who owns some property and settle down before Sydney's life of dissipation of singleness lead Sydney to poverty.

Charles Darnay and Lucy Manette walk in the woods. Sydney approaches but stops to hear Charles propose to Lucie. Lucie accepts. Charles and Lucie kiss. (Camera captures the kissing scene in a long, circular angle...) Sydney departs dejectedly - Lucie cannot be his.

Gasper is in an iron cage.

Crowd shouts traitor as horses pull a casket down the street. Jerry Cruncher and Jerry Jr. inquire and discover that the traitor in the coffin is John Barsad. Jerry Cruncher asks where Barsad's body will be buried and receives an answer.

That night, Mrs. Cruncher prays for her husband, Jerry, knowing Jerry is going out that night to dig up Barsad's body and sell it to a surgeon (i.e. Jerry is a ""resurrection man""). Mrs. Cruncher pleads to Jerry not to commit the action. Jerry refuses. Jerry Jr. asks if he can go with his father. Jerry refuses but tells Mrs. Cruncher that Jerry Jr. will make up for her.

Jerry Cruncher and his grave-robbing associates dig up Barsad's coffin. Jerry Jr. disobeyed his father's command to stay home and instead watches from the distance. After the coffin is brought up from the grave and the lid removed, Jerry Cruncher and his associates discover that rocks were the only items in the casket. They wonder who got to the body before them and even whether John Barsad was ever actually placed in the coffin.

John Barsad arrives in France. Barsad claims he wants to find employment with the government of France, and that Barsad has certain skills (spying) he can offer. Barsad is emitted.

Gasper remains in the iron cage. Gasper thinks about his son's death at the wheels of Marquis Saint Evrmonde's carriage.

Sydney Carton talks indoors with Lucie Manette. Sydney remarks that Lucie appears very happy. Lucie remarks that Sydney appears very unhappy.

Miss Pross goes to Jarvis Lorry to complain about how dozens and even 100s of unworthy men seek the company of her ladybird (Lucie). Jarvis Lorry asks to know the names of these men. Miss Pross replies ""Sydney Carton"" and ""Charles Darnay.""

Gasper is taken from his cage to the place of execution, where he is hung in front of a watching crowd. After the execution, Monsieur Defarge and an associate talk about how it took the authorities over a year to find Gasper, since no one would turn Gasper in. Monsieur Defarge and the associate also talk about how the authorities plan to let Gasper's body rot in the noose.

Monsieur Defarge and a new associate talk with other older associates. Monsieur Defarge plans to show the new associate what the aristocracy in France is like.

Lucie Manette talks with her father one more time about whether she has his (Dr. Manette's) permission to marry Charles Darnay. Dr. Manette urges Lucie to marry Charles - saying he does not want to prevent Lucie's happiness.

Monsieur Defarge receives the news that John Barsad - a new government spy - has arrived in the district. Barsad enters the wine shop and orders a drink. Barsad inquires about Gasper's death - trying to get Monsieur Defarge or someone else to say something negative about the government. Barsad calls Monsieur Defarge ""Jacques.""

Monsieur Defarge points out that his name is not ""Jacques."" Barsad tells Monsieur Defarge that they have mutual friends in Dr. Manette and Lucie Manette. Barsad also tells the Defarges that Lucie Manette will marry Charles Darnay, the nephew of the late Marquis Saint Evrmonde.

After Barsad leaves and the shop closes for the night, Monsieur and Madame Defarge talk. Monsieur Defarge hopes Lucie Manette will keep her husband out of France. Madame Defarge says that Charles Evrmonde's destiny will take him to France to meet justice.

Sydney Carton tells Lucie Manette that she has been ""the last dream of my soul."" Sydney says he will always remember Lucie and that his life was a life of what could have been. Sydney Carton says, ""For you, I would do anything. I would make any sacrifice...Remember always there is a man who would give his life for you or for anyone you love.""

Charles Darnay gives Jerry Cruncher's son a coin. Jerry takes the coin from Jerry, Jr.

Miss Pross and Jarvis Lorry tell Charles Darnay that when Charles and Lucie are away on their honeymoon, Dr. Manette will receive the best care. Charles thanks them.

Sydney Carton hopes that he and Charles Darnay can be friends. Sydney Carton asks a favor of Charles Darnay. Sydney asks Charles if, once Charles and Lucy are married, he (Sydney) could have the right to visit the family unannounced and uninvited whenever he wished. Charles Darnay grants Sydney Carton's request.

Dr. Manette talks with Lucie Manette about his thoughts when imprisoned - how he wondered whether his unborn child was a son or a daughter.

Jarvis Lorry and Miss Pross admire Lucie, who is wearing her wedding dress. Both Jarvis Lorry and Miss Pross have tears in their eyes yet deny crying. Jarvis Lorry makes a comment that seeing Lucie reminds Jarvis Lorry that he is a bachelor. Miss Pross replies by telling Jarvis Lorry that he was a bachelor from the cradle and even before.

[Before scene: Charles Darnay, alone with Dr. Manette, tells the doctor details concerning his past and his real name.] Scene begins: Dr. Manette says that nothing about Charles' past matters except that Lucie loves him. Dr. Manette says that Charles will always be ""Charles Darnay"" to him.

Lucie and Charles are married at the church. Sydney Carton observes the service from outside the church.

A distraught Dr. Manette returns to shoemaking. He retrieves his tools and begs Jarvis Lorry and Miss Pross to ""give me my work."" During this time, Dr. Manette hallucinates about his time in prison and refers to himself as ""105 North Tower.""

After nine days, Dr. Manette regains his reason. Dr. Manette asks Jarvis Lorry if Lucie was told of his relapse. Jarvis Lorry says she was not. Dr. Manette says that the relapse was triggered by so many memories of the past. (Note: We as viewers know that the relapse was triggered by Charles' admission that he was an Evrmonde.) Jarvis Lorry asks Dr. Manette if the tools could be disposed of since they only facilitate unpleasant thoughts of the past. Dr. Manette admits that getting rid of the tools would be very difficult.

Jarvis Lorry and Miss Pross bury Dr. Manette's tools in the garden. (Note: In the 1980 adaptation, they disposed of the tools by burning them in a fireplace.)

Scene shows Dr. Manette, Lucie, and Charles happily riding in an open carriage.

Monsieur Defarge rallies the French patriots to overturn their aristocratic oppressors. The patriots are aroused to action under the belief of liberty, equality, and fraternity.

Dr. Manette peacefully sleeps as Charles and Lucie take a walk.

A little peasant girl sees an aristocrat hanging in the middle of a street.
The Bastille is stormed (not really so adventuresome a storming as in the 1980 adaptation). The governor is kicked around until Madame Defarge desires to chop off the governor's head with an ax and show the head to the crowd. Monsieur Defarge, meanwhile, searches 105 North Tower for any secretly concealed writings of Dr. Manette. (Viewer does not get to see if he finds anything - of course, we know Monsieur Defarge does.)

Narrator speaks while viewer watches happy images of the French people. "" All men born free are equal in rights. Social distinctions can only be based on common usefulness. The aim of every political body is the presentation of the natural and unalienable rights of men. These rights are liberty, property, safety, and resistance against oppression. No man can be accused, arrested, or imprisoned except by due process of the law. Free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the most precious rights of man. Every citizen can, therefore, speak, write, and print freely.

People's attitudes change from rejoicing to silence as they see something fearful.

Film shows the cobblestone streets (as ominous music plays) until the guillotine rises in front of the camera. (So much for justice and natural rights.)

Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton talk about the revolution. Sydney Carton says, ""It seems to me it's the same as ever: Best of times, and the worse of times; season of light, and the season of darkness; the spring of hope and the winter of despair. We have everything before us. We have nothing before us. We're all going direct to heaven. We're all going direct the other way.""

Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton arrive at Tellson's Bank, which the French aristocracy is congregating at as though the bank was their embassy. Viewer hears the conversations of various angry French aristocrats.

Jarvis Lorry and Charles Darnay talk. Charles Darnay tries to persuade Jarvis Lorry not to travel to France. Jarvis Lorry refuses to remain in England, emphasizing that his whole life has been spent serving Tellson's Bank. Jarvis Lorry believes he is needed in France to safeguard sensitive bank documents.

A Tellson teller holds a letter for the Marquis Saint Evrmonde (Charles Evrmonde). Various French aristocrats at Tellson Bank say they know the Marquis to be a traitor to France - left his estate to rabble after his uncle's murder. Mr. Stryver takes the side of the aristocrats in damning the Marquis for abandoning the family estate.

Charles Darnay takes the letter saying he knows the Marquis. Mr. Stryver then proceeds to diatribe against the Marquis, saying he is surprised the Marquis is not at the head of the murdering rabble.

Alone in his study, Charles Darnay read the letter. The letter is from Charles' faithful servant, Gabelle, who had been arrested for serving the Evrmonde family. Gabelle writes that if Charles does not help him, Gabelle will be killed.

Charles talks with Dr. Manette about leaving for Paris. Charles tells the doctor to give Lucy a letter explaining where Charles was going and why. Charles does not want to tell Lucy in person for fear Lucy will want to travel with him.

Dr. Manette tells Charles that he (Charles) must write to him the very first moment he (Charles) reaches Paris.

Charles visits his daughter as she sleeps. Charles visits Lucy as she sleeps. (Viewer hears music playing in the background.)

Charles is arrested for being an emigrant and an aristocrat. French authorities believe it is irrelevant that Charles returned on his own accord to help a servant.

Charles meets with fellow aristocrats also locked away in La Force. They bow to Charles.

Charles is locked away in a cell. (Note: Cell appears nicer than in 1980 adaptation.)

Lucy Darnay and Dr. Manette talk with Jarvis Lorry in France. Lucy tells Jarvis Lorry that they came to France after they did not hear from Charles. Dr. Manette says that since he (Dr. Manette) was a prisoner at the Bastille, no Frenchman would touch him except to embrace him. Dr. Manette says that he knows Charles is in La Force.

Guillotine is raised. Guillotine falls again and again. Blood covers the blade of guillotine. A large crowd cheers as head after head is chopped off.

Dr. Manette protects Charles Darnay from being taken from La Force by the mob.

Charles and Dr. Manette talk in Charles' cell. Charles says that until the door closed behind him, Charles never knew what Dr. Manette had suffered. Dr. Manette replies that his suffering is now his strength.

More guillotine killing is shown.

Jerry Cruncher watches the Defarges, Jarvis Lorry, and one other patriot enter Lorry's establishment.

Lucy reads a letter from Charles. Madame Defarge views Lucy, her daughter, and Miss Pross. Lucy begs Madame Defarge to help her get Charles released. Madame Defarge tells Lucy to let Dr. Manette help Charles gain his release. Madame Defarge also says that the French people have suffered at the hands of the aristocracy too long - having their own husbands and fathers killed or imprisoned - to worry about the troubles of one woman, wife, and mother (Lucie Manette).

Guillotine blade drops.

Jarvis Lorry and Sydney Carton talk. Jarvis Lorry talks about how many people are guillotined by the bloodthirsty crowd. Jarvis Lorry mutters that the tribunal takes ten cases per hour, and that few prisoners are ever acquitted or released. Sydney Carton says he had heard jokes made about the guillotine. Jarvis Lorry says that Charles' trial date is uncertain, but that Dr. Manette has done everything possible for Charles. Jarvis Lorry says that Lucy can wait at a certain place outside of the prison, and that Charles can see her from inside. Sydney Carton tells Jarvis Lorry not to tell Lucie that he is in Paris, not until Sydney knows he can be useful.

Jerry Cruncher asks Jarvis Lorry and Sydney Carton if they know a man down on the street. Sydney Carton says that the man is John Barsad. Jerry Cruncher replies that Barsad is an Old Bailey spy who was supposed to be dead but never was - that the coffin was filled with bricks and stones. Jarvis Lorry scolds Jerry Cruncher for being a grave robber. Jerry says that after seeing all the bodies from the guillotine killed in France, he has repented his grave robbing.

Sydney Carton and John Barsad talk in a church. Sydney Carton tells Barsad that he knows Barsad was in the employ of the British government as a spy. Sydney says that the French government would find this reality quite condemning. Barsad claims not to be afraid - claims he is trusted. However, Sydney Carton knows Barsad is terrified. Sydney asks Barsad for a favor, since Barsad is trusted in his goings in and out of La Force. Otherwise, Sydney Carton says he will denounce Barsad.

Lucy and her daughter stare into the La Force. As they watch, a woodcutter taunts them. The woodcutter pretends the wood he is cutting is Lucy and her daughter's heads.

Dr. Manette tells Lucy that Charles' trial was scheduled for the next day.

Dr. Manette intercedes at Charles' trial. Dr. Manette says that Charles only returned to France to help Gabelle, who had since been set free by the tribunal. (Note: In 1980 adaptation, Gabelle is killed.) Dr. Manette tells the tribunal that he too was an emigrant from France yet returned. Dr. Manette asks the tribunal if they also consider him an enemy of the Republic. The crowd's consensus is the Dr. Manette is a hero.

Monsieur Defarge tells Madame Defarge to present her evidence. Madame Defarge responds by saying that now is not the time.

Back at Lorry's residence, Charles and Lucy embrace. Miss Pross gives her unfavorable opinion of the French.

Citizen soldiers march toward Lorry's residence.

Charles and Lucy sleep.

Citizen soldiers continue marching.

Lucy touches Charles in bed

Citizen soldiers rearrest Charles Darnay. Dr. Manette begs to know who denounced Charles, and what Charles is accused of. The soldiers tell Dr. Manette that Monsieur and Madame Defarge and one other denounced Charles.

Sydney Carton looks on.

In court the next day, the prosecutor states that new evidence will be presented against the Evrmonde family. Prosecutor says that Earnest Defarge, Trese Defarge, and Dr. Alexander Manette have denounced Charles Darnay. Dr. Manette denies having denounced Charles, but then the prosecutor shows Dr. Manette his own document. Memories flood back to Dr. Manette.

Viewer hears and sees Manette's narrative played out. (Note: Narrative is briefly spoken in 1980 adaptation.) Viewer sees how the Evrmonde brothers took Dr. Manette by force to attend a young woman who was sweating profusely and in great pain. Viewer see and hear that sister's brother who was mortally wounded in his dying breaths tell Dr. Manette how the Evrmonde brothers took his sister by force for sexual conquest and killed her husband. The young woman's brother says he had another younger sister who the Evrmonde brothers will never find. (Camera turns to Madame Defarge who has tears in her eyes.) The brother in great pain says, ""Marquis Evrmonde, I curse you! I curse you!"" and then dies. The young woman lived a few days longer and then died.

Dr. Manette wrote that he decided to write to the minister telling of those events. Dr. Manette speaks that after writing and sending the letter to the minister, he was kidnapped. The Evrmonde brothers burned the letter addressed to the minister in front of the doctor. Dr. Manette was taken to the Bastille.

Dr. Manette reads the end of his letter to the tribunal. Dr. Manette reads his denouncement of the Evrmondes ""to the last of their race.""

Madame Defarge taunts Dr. Manette by saying, ""Save him now, doctor.""

Dr. Manette apologizes for denouncing Charles. Charles tells the doctor he had no idea the Evrmonde family had behaved this badly. Charles said that he only knew his mother had told him about a family the Evrmondes had wronged.

Lucie faints as Charles is led away. Sydney Carton speaks to Lucie and tells her again that, ""For her, I would do anything."" Sydney kisses the unconscious Lucie.

Dr. Manette walks up and down streets hopelessly, begging for someone to help Charles.

Jarvis Lorry and Sydney Carton talk. Jarvis Lorry says that Charles Darnay will die tomorrow. Jarvis Lorry tells Sydney Carton that Lorry is 78 years of age and that Lorry had always been a man of business, even when Lorry was a boy. Sydney Carton says that Lucie and her daughter will morn for Jarvis Lorry when Lorry dies.

Dr. Manette walks in pouring rain. Dr. Manette talks to himself saying, ""How could I denounce him? How could I?""

Sydney Carton buys two products at a pharmacy. The pharmacist warns Sydney to be careful not to mix the two drugs together.

Monsieur Defarge says that the violence against the Evrmonde family must stop somewhere. Madame Defarge is not willing to stop. Madame Defarge admits that the brother and sister who died at the hands of the Marquis were her own siblings. Madame Defarge believes it is her duty to seek vengeance against the Evrmonde family to the last of their race. Madame Defarge concludes by saying, ""Then tell wind and fire when to stop but don't tell me.""

Sydney Carton overheads the Defarge's conversation at the wine shop.

Dr. Manette asks Jarvis Lorry for his work back. Dr. Manette is experiencing great mental shock.

Sydney Carton asks Jarvis Lorry to follow certain instructions, since the child and Lucy are in great danger from Madame Defarge. Sydney Carton says that Madame Defarge and a woodcutter will denounce the child, Lucy, and Dr. Manette as trying to help Charles escape since they were all seen near La Force. Sydney Carton says there can be no delays, and that they must leave before Charles' execution. Sydney Carton gives Jarvis Lorry Sydney's papers. Sydney Carton says that they should take two carriages when leaving Paris. Sydney Carton tells Jarvis Lorry not to be surprised if Sydney arrives at the carriage unwell the next day.

The next morning, Sydney Carton looks over the architectural wonders and poverty of Paris. (Music plays in the background.)

Barsad allows Sydney Carton in Charles' cell. Charles puts Sydney's coat on. Charles writes to Sydney's dictation. Sydney mixes the two drugs and places them near Charles' nose. Charles goes to sleep. Sydney then calls in Barsad and tells Barsad to take Charles exactly where Sydney said. Barsad tells two guards to enter with a stretcher. Before the guards arrive, Sydney places the dictated letter in Charles pocket. The guards take Charles out of prison, leaving Sydney in Charles' place.

Alone in the cell, Sydney quotes, ""I am the resurrection and the life sayeth the Lord.""

Lucie, her child, Dr. Manette, and Jarvis Lorry wait in the carriage. Barsad brings Charles Darnay to them. The carriage leaves. Lucy looks at Charles. However, it is not clear if she realizes the man in the carriage is her husband. Lucie remembers Sydney's words from long ago.

Madame Defarge enters Lorry's residence, as Miss Pross is packing. Miss Pross rapidly shuts doors. Madame Defarge approaches Miss Pross and says sotto voce, ""Are they gone or are they in that room?"" When Miss Pross refuses to let Madame Defarge into the room, Madame Defarge and Miss Pross get into a scuffle. In the scuttle, Madame Defarge's pistol accidentally discharges and kills Madame Defarge.

The shot makes Miss Pross deaf.

Crowd gathers at guillotine. Madame Defarge's seat is empty. The woodcutter asks how many people will be guillotined that day.

Jarvis Lorry gives the guard at the gates to Paris all their travel papers. The guard finds the papers acceptable. The carriage is let out of Paris.

A woman shouts out for Madame Defarge, saying that Madame Defarge has never missed an execution. Woman also wonders where Monsieur Defarge is.

Prisoners arrive at guillotine. Woodcutter makes crude jokes.

A seamstress talks with Sydney Carton. The seamstress says she was charged with plotting against the republic. She says she is innocent. The seamstress then realizes that Sydney Carton is not Charles Darnay. The seamstress asks Sydney why he plans to take Charles' place.

Monsieur Defarge sits in his wine shop thinking about the guillotine blade's repetitious falling. Monsieur Defarge wants the killing to stop.

The seamstress and Sydney Carton comfort each other as they angry crowd shouts at them.

One by one the prisoners are guillotined. Sydney Carton and the seamstress continue to talk. Eventually, the seamstress' turn to die comes. Before parting, Sydney and the seamstress kiss.

Sydney quotes Scripture, ""Whosoever believeth in me shall never die.""

Lucie reflects upon her past with Charles, with tears in her eyes.

Sydney's famous words are spoken as Lucie's carriage goes off into the distance. Sydney says: ""It is a far better thing that I do then I have ever done. It is a far better rest that I go to then I have ever known.""

MY THOUGHTS:

This adaptation is rather loyal to the novel (certainly moreso than the 1980 adaptation.) Now, some people may enjoy the 1935 adaptation. However, since the 1935 adaptation was black-and-white, I don't feel it acceptable to use in comparison with the 1980, 1981, or 1989 color adaptations.

What I really liked about this 1989 adaptation was the music, which set a very effective mood. For example, the morning Sydney is going to go and take Charles' place in prison, the music and art/imagery was perfect to portay how Sydney felt.

Now, the production must have been low budget, and therefore, the special effects (ex: the storming of the Bastille) are quite unconvincing by modern standards. However, I don't think this ruined the film.

Therefore, I recommend this as my personal favorite color adapation of Charles Dickens' ""A Tale of Two Cities.""",1249084800,7,29878,4.940495207667731

1628140,4,B00005N5RH,"I've watched two made-for-TV versions of this story and both have strengths and weaknesses, but I prefer this one over the 1991 ITC production.  Pluses?  The cinematography was better, the emotional tone of the intense scenes was more believable (with the exception of the demonic Therese Defarge) and it is more faithful to the novel (also longer).  Negatives?  The sound quality varied considerably and even though the French accents were more authentic, it was sometimes difficult to understand.  The actress who played Mme Defarge went over the top in her zeal to portray Therese, but that might have been intentional.  Mme D is a crazed character in the story, so maybe it fits...

For teachers, I've prepared an intro and comprehension packet that would help when showing only the movie without reading Dicken's lengthy and sometimes difficult novel.",1243555200,5,856,5.159420289855072
1628141,5,B00005N5RH,"After enjoying this DVD set, I was inspired to read the book, which I had not done since high school.  As I read, I compared the scenes in the book and the movie.  This production sticks more closely to the book than any other movie/mini-series based on a book that I have ever scene.  Of course, they could not fit the entire book into the time alloted, but they missed very, very little.  Generally speaking, the scenes from the book were in the movie, but they were abbreviated with less detail and shortened dialogue.  What's missing?  The movie never makes the connection between Miss. Pross and Barsad, wich isn't very important.  I missed seeing Little Lucie's attachment to Sydney Carton, which could have been slipped in quickly and easily.  The only additions to the story not found in the book were done to explain things to the viewer.  One character would explain something to another character which Dickens related to the reader in his narration.  The movie did show Sydney Carton outside the church in distress while Darnay married Lucie.  This was a nice touch; Dickens should have thought of this.  Much of the dialogue comes straight out of the book.

Many of the actors do a superb job.  James Wilby portrays Sydney Carton to perfection.  In order to fully appreciate his performance one has to be familiar with his performances in other movies to see how he has altered himself for this role.  More than just his hair color was changed.  His voice is different, his posture slouches, he walks ploddingly.  It's just amazing to see this normally elegant actor turn himself into a frumpy mess.  John Mills is 100% perfect as Jarvis Lorry.  He is completely convincing right down to his bad wig.  The casting of characters like Monsieur DeFarge, Miss. Pross, Barsad, the little seamstress, Jerry Cruncher, the woodcutter, etc. are just right.  Even the exras in crowd scenes have the right look.  The citizens of London look British, and the extras in the Paris mob scenes look French.

It's a complicated story, so the viewer must pay attention, particularly a viewer who is unfamiliar with the book, but it's a great and moving story.  Every time I watch it I want to tell Sydney Carton not to do it.  He's one of the greatest characters in English literature, and he's brought to life in this production.",1236816000,14,2325,4.75
1628142,5,B00005N5RH,"A classic novel can have strong characters, elegant English, deep philosophy, a good historical setting, engaging dialogue or a gripping plot. A Tale of Two Cities has all six, and has them in abundance! It's the 19th century's ""cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me"" and suffers few rivals. It is a far, far better novel than any I've ever read. For this reason, no screen adaptation will ever do justice to the original words as set on paper or narrated on CD.

That said, Arthur Hopcraft & Philippe Monnier have done an outstanding job. France's history has always held a fascination for me personally. By the age of 21, I'd TWICE spent Bastille Day in France. Even back home in Ireland I vividly recall July 1989 when ""Revolution Fever"" was in the air. What excellent timing to coincide this film's release with the bi-centenary of the storming of the Bastille! Among the acclaimed cast is the irreplaceable John Mills. Having stolen the show as Pip in the 1945 ""Great Expectations"", he turns up 44 years later only to excel himself again - this time as the learned banker Jarvis Laurie. Other lead roles are played by Xavier Deluc (Charles Darnay), James Wilby (Sydney Carton), Serena Gordon (Lucie Manette), Jean-Pierre Aumont (Alex Manette) and Kathie Kriegel (Therese Defarge).

1628154,5,B00005N5RH,"Within my admittedly limited experience, Masterpiece Theater dramatizations of great books are well produced and faithful to the original.  This is no exception.

Well, Dickens's famous opening lines, ""It was the best of times. It was the worst of times,"" etc. do not come at the beginning of the production but are inserted into a monologue by Sydney Carton shortly after the start of the second DVD.  Otherwise, the plot, details, and characters seem much the same as I remember from when I last read the book several years ago.

My wife and I bought this set to help a young friend who is close to graduating from high school at a public school and therefore has problems with reading comprehension.  We are well satisfied that she can watch this, then read, and perhaps profit in several ways.

Anyone looking for dazzling FX and computer-generated panoramics will be disappointed.  This was made on a budget for television in 1989.

1628158,5,B00005N5RH,"This film version of A Tale of Two Cities is a masterpiece -- it faithful adapts Dickens' classic novel while holding out as a worthwhile movie in its own right through incredible performances from its lead actors.  The plot of the novel has not been touched -- in filming Dickens' most tightly-plotted novel, a good decision.  The acting is uncommonly good.  Sydney Carton is fabulously done; James Wilby is to be commended for a wonderful and nuanced performance.  I also found Madame Defarge particularly well-done; the actress playing her is SCARY!  Considering Mme. Defarge's character in the book, I think her almost insane bitterness and sharp purpose is well-portrayed.

A couple of unique things about this film include its use of French actors to play French characters and British actors to play British characters.  No contrived accents, and people actually look their nationality -- both important in such a highly political story.  I also strongly support the decision to have Carton and Darnay played by different people; yes, they're supposed to look alike, but not identical.  And having different actors play them facilitates the portrayal of their very contrasted characters.

I am admittedly coming from the perspective of one who read and loved the book years before seeing the movie; I can't judge what this film would be like to someone who has never read the novel.  But I found it an accurate and sensitive adaptation of the book I know and love, and I imagine that the beauty of the story would appeal just as easily to someone experiencing the story for the first time.",1110499200,165,1596,4.962406015037594

The movie is extremely long which is part of the problem and the acting is horribly done. I found myself straining to stay awake. The script is something out of the Middle Ages with no modern word adaptations it's hard to imagine any of the characters are ""real."" The storyline is straight out the book with no hollywood adaptations this causing part of the problem-- you don't get any sparks between Lucy and Carton- or dialouge. It focuses more on the war and hardly anything on the romance or passion in the story.

All in all this movie in my opinon butchered one of the classic love stories in literature. Tale of Two Cities fans- we know buy the classic it's always better!",1108684800,9,970,4.41340782122905

1628161,4,B00005N5RH,"Never have the noble humanities and horrible dehumanization been revealed to such extremes as in Dickens' ""A Tale Of Two Cities"". Just exactly to what extreme the human hatred could go, just exactly to what extreme the human love could go, and just exactly to what extreme the human sacrifice could go, you will get answers from this novel.
It tells ineffably touching stories of love and sacrifice, striking stories of hatred and revenge, in the turmoil of French Revolution. This was the time that hunger would drive poor people to sip the wine spilled on the street stones, this was the time that an innocent man (Dr. Manette, Lucie's father) was imprisoned in the Bastille for eighteen years not for any crimes but for saving people's lives, this was the time that conscience made a noble person (Charles Darnay) to relinquish his aristocratic title and pursue life of simplicity and dignity, this was the time that a gentleman (Charles Darnay) would take the risk his own life to save the life of his servant, and this was the time that a young man (Sydney Carton) would take another man's place on the guillotine and realize his promise to his beloved (Lucie), to whom he treasured as ""the last dream of my soul""......
This Masterpiece Theatre miniseries did a fairly good job in crafting the stories, although less successfully in bringing out the grandeur of the Revolution. But thanks to the wonderful actors and actresses, their brilliant acting has, to some extent, made up the weaknesses. Sydney Carton is a fascinating character. Young actor James Wilby has excellently sustained Carton's emotional complexities: his cynicism, his indifference, his impulsive yearning for life, and his devoted love to Lucie. Carton, who is Darnay's lookalike and bears the same great affection towards Lucie, is, however, Darnay's inner alter ego. In contrast with Darnay's ideal, Carton is real, and, when fleshed out by James Wilby with immense delicacies, this is the character that couldn't be more captivating. Most of the other characters are also well rendered, with maybe a weak line with Madame Defarge, whose hatred and thirsty for revenge is somewhat stiffly and superficially depicted.

""It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known"", the drama ended with Carton walking towards the axe, while Lucie, Darnay, and their daughter riding towards their safe home.
