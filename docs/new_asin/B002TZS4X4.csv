I tried to watch this show once and after about 5 minutes of babbling and broken english by Bridget I had to change the channel. How a bimbo with the IQ of a flea can get a show is unbelievable. Once this skanks looks and body go, she will be in big trouble.",1262044800,,328,3.984848484848485
3986768,5,B002TZS4X4,"I loved this dvd!!!
I love to travel & i love reality tv shows, so naturally i was a huge fan of The Girls Next Door (Or Girls Of Playboy Mansion as it is in Australia)but due to the change in name i haven't seen the final 6th season because it hasn't been released here =(

Anyway Bridget is funny & bubbly so full of personality she makes her own show just ooze with entertainment!
As a big traveller, i have huge plans to travel the world & an ever expanding list of places i wish to go... Alot that where already featured in this dvd, watching the culture & adversity of the places Bridget travelled just made me want to be there now!! So if that was the purpose of the dvd then they certainly succeeded.
Bridget respected the traditions of each Country/City & it made for a very educational fun dvd.
Learning can be fun!!

Plus she had a huge wardrobe of different bikini's for the boys!!

The Price Of The dvd is great for its value! I thought being a cheaper dvd its quality would be lower & it may have had bad production, but i was very wrong, the QUALITY was fantastic & all 3 discs were immaculate!
This is a dvd i could watch over & over again. It even Featured Australia!!!

I heard that Bridget also filmed a pilot for her own reality tv show, but it was not picked up any networks =( Devastating because after this dvd, i'll be watching anything i can with Bridget it in.
Kendra, was always my favourite Girl Next Door, But after this i now see Bridget in a whole new light, this dvd put Bridget in her element!!!

Hope This Helps!!

3986769,1,B002TZS4X4,Loved her in Girls next door but this was so boring I have yet to watch the entire dvd.  It's stored with the other videos from the Girls Next Door.,1311811200,,148,3.933333333333333
3986770,5,B002TZS4X4,"I gave this book to my teenage son for his birthday because he's a big ""GIRLS NEXT DOOR"" fan.  He hasn't stopped watching it and it really shows off some of the most beautiful beaches (my son informed me he wants to go to the beaches of Spain now!)  Thanks.",1301875200,2,257,4.12
3986771,5,B002TZS4X4,"this is a good DVD set.  I have a hi def. TV and blue ray player.  I guess every one has theire own tastes, but Bridget looks good to me in the videos.  I don't say she looks perfect, but good.  these videos do show some bare skin in bikini.  this may not be for every one.  I happen to like the videos.",1290470400,,303,3.7301587301587302
3986772,4,B002TZS4X4,"I do NOT normally watch The Travel Channel unless they air a show on the Disney theme parks.

I was a late bloomer to watching The Girls Next Door because I am NOT a Playboy fan.

I decided to watch the show because after I started watching TGND I became a fan of the ladies.

I did enjoy the show.  What the best part was because Bridget really was having fun & enjoyed what she was doing  EXCEPT FOR EATING FOOD I AGREE I WOULD NOT EAT EITHER

Besides Holly & Kendra her sister Anastasia makes an appearance.  Other ladies seen on TGND are in different episodes

Beach & area coverage are normal for this type of show, showing everything they can/of interest.  Best episode So. California for TGND fans.  Holly & Kendra on this episode.  Worst Thailand the snakes at the beach.  Torment animals that will kill you.

Now, let's pick apart the DVD package

Cheap, cheap, cheap.  Cheap, thin plastic case.  ALL THE DVD'S HAVE THE SAME PHOTO OF BRIDGET, SAME 1 WHICH WAS USED ON THE COVER SHOT.  Can NOT read the episode guide inside without taking the DVD's out 1st.  Discs 2 & 3 are on top of each other.  So, if you want to watch disc 3 you have to remove 2 discs.

Extras, what extras.

It was a good 1 season show, but the DVD package is just terrible.

My rating is for the show NOT the DVD package.  That would get only a 1.",1268438400,3,1329,4.207171314741036
3986773,5,B002TZS4X4,"First of all, it has Bridget.  That alone should be enough.  But if it isn't and you like sexy beaches and you would like to know the low-down on where to go and what to do when you get there...this is for you!

3986774,5,B002TZS4X4,"I looooooved this program.

Watching the Girls Next Door I always thought Bridget would make a great tv show on traveling, showing her great personality & character & i really enjoyed watching this season!

She's very fun to watch & she generates an exictment about a city that you cannot help but want to visit some day.

Travel Channel, take note & cast Bridget on more of your shows!",1264464000,8,386,4.565217391304348
3986775,4,B002TZS4X4,"I've only seen this show on TV but it was an amusing show, it is much like Girls Next Door (and I still think it's a spinoff of the show). I think it would be even better if I knew it was uncensored, if I knew that I would buy it.",1264032000,,230,3.5294117647058822
3986776,5,B002TZS4X4,"I watched this show religiously on The Travel Channel and am so happy that they're releasing the DVD! With the purchase of the entire season I can now delete all of those episodes from my DVR to free up some memory. I enjoyed watching the show, even though Bridget got to be quite annoying with her little-girl talk and school-girl giggling. I love traveling and it was easy to overlook Bridget when you considered the fact that you got to see a new country every episode. I actually went to Costa Rica and stayed at the same resort Bridget highlighted in Arenal. The show captured the beauty of the region but video cannot describe what it's like to actually be there. I tried the volcano mud wrap at the resort and would recommend it to everyone. I'll also admit that it's quite cool to be someplace where you know Bridget has literally sat and slid down the waterslide. The thing I found funny, however, is the fact that I watched the show in high-def and boy does Bridget have some bad undereye baggage! I would also tell Bridget to make sure that if she's doing another show where she's walking around in nothing in a bikini to get her stomach toned! Other than that, I would recommend this show to anyone who is curious about what the world around them looks like.",1262822400,5,1270,4.478448275862069
3986777,4,B002TZS4X4,"Ok, I am giving my review only 4 stars because I have not seen the dvd version of the show. I did watch the show on tv and I loved it. I usually find a lot of shows on the travel channel to be a little stuffy (not much, but a little) but Bridget's show made me want to travel to places I had never even thought of visiting before. I found her fun and funny and she just really seems to have a zest for life.",1262217600,10,407,3.689655172413793

8380823,5,B002TZS4X4,"hi

This is a pretty good show. I bought it somewhere else for $14.99

I think it way over priced dvd set. $129.99 is crazy for a 3 disc set only 17 episodes.

I have been a fan of Bridget for serval years when she was on the girls next door show.",1445299200,,247,3.7115384615384617
8380824,5,B002TZS4X4,"I want to go to all the places she went to.
Such beautiful places.
She did a great job, way to go Bridget!",1440633600,,106,3.652173913043478
8380825,4,B002TZS4X4,"I think I enjoy Bridget's Sexiest Beaches here on DVD than I did when it appeared on the Travel Channel, and only for 1 year. Those places she and her friends went to seem pretty interesting for those who want to soak up the sun or ride the waves on the beaches!",1421712000,,262,4.0576923076923075
8380826,4,B002TZS4X4,I like it because you get to see so many beautiful places! The places are just stunning and I think bridget is fun.,1378944000,,115,4.043478260869565
8380827,4,B002TZS4X4,"I have seen all the girls next doors shows and I loved them all! I enjoyed the episodes but the special features was stupid. If you like looking at Bridgette in her bikinis you will like this dvd. I think she did a good job, but she could leave something to the imagination now and then, she has lost a lot of weight, but she could tone up a bit. Overall great video for a great price! P.S I think it would be cool if she went through the USA looking for beaches too just a thought :)",1374278400,,484,3.9489795918367347
8380828,4,B002TZS4X4,"Having not seen the show on cable TV, I didn't know what to expect.  I knew I liked Bridget Marquardt from Girls Next Door, so I thought it would be fun.  The show felt like it was edited in snippets of time.  What the producers called ""sexy"" I call stupid.  Example:  Watching Bridget drink the tequila worm...eh?  Really is this what you wanted to watch?  Or did you want to know about hotel, locations to see, and shopping?  The latter was my preference. There wasn't enough of that. Not like a traditional travel show.  If you enjoy seeing Bridget in a bikini, then this show doesn't disappoint. I still look forward to seeing Bridget in another new show. Bridget did her best, but the producers and whoever created the concept, they made this show stupid.",1360368000,2,760,4.57037037037037
8380829,4,B002TZS4X4,The locales of the beaches are great but the activities shown in this video are sometimes waste of time.  Instead of showing the beauty of the beaches they show ridiculous activities in the beach as the python and snakes fighting in the cage for almost an entire show.  Waste of time.  And the host is always trying to be cute.,1359158400,,327,4.416666666666667
8380830,5,B002TZS4X4,"Bridget takes us to stunning locales in ways only she can!  A beautiful show, well done and super-informative for travellers like me.  Loved both the Travel Channel show, and this resulting DVD.  Highly recommend.",1332288000,,213,5.205882352941177
8380831,4,B002TZS4X4,"I wanted something to put on my dvd when I had guests and this is great. I can let the tv on without having to pay attention all the time, but there's still something pleasant to watch, very nice locations and a nice hostess! It's very well produced and we get to know some amazing beaches. Bidget should get her own show, much better than Samantha Brown...!!!
Love it!",1327104000,6,369,4.36231884057971
