You may find this movie interesting because it shows how the people who lives in the poor neighbourhoods around Medellin had to look for a life in the past dark years where the drugs played an important role. In fact, the movie tells the story of some guys that get related with that crude violence, becoming ""sicarios"" (people who work killing people) and how they fight just to survive in an small world which is governed by the money of the drug lords. Furthermore, it is important to notice, that Victor Gaviria, the director, had been kill because of this movie.
However, as I am from Medellin, Colombia, (where the movie was made), I can tell that Rodrigo D: No Future, as all movies, has bits of non-true facts which can be misunderstood by people. As a colombian I can tell you, that this is NOT a true description about the colombian life style, and does not completely describe how is Colombia and of course Medellin. If your are interested to know our life style, I suggest to look up for the movie ""Golpe de estadio"".
Nevertheless, this movie is really well done, and I am sure you will enjoy it.",1046995200,3,1173,4.485981308411215
7905054,5,B000007NMZ,"Rodrigo D is not the best foreign film ever made; I don't think it was even intended for the awards. But it definitely is the best documentary movie portraying the social consequences of the drug ventures that flooded Medellin in a sea of violence and decadence in the decade of the 80's. Easy money and quick death, this seemed to be the motto of the youth living in the slums in that time. ""No Nacimos Pa'Semilla"" (We weren't born as a seed) is a book written during the nineties exploring this same notion by a local writer. Most of these kids didn't expect to make it over 20, and most didn't.

""Lost is you, is me, are we all""- Line whispered by Rodrigo when Ramon, a worthless thief and low life drug dealer, tells him it's too bad they don't have a gun to steal a nice motorcycle.

I don't intend to write here how this came to be. It is always more complicated than it seems. Yes, there is poverty, a blind eye from the local government and the hand of drug lords. But it all has its roots in the 50's with the beginning of the internal conflict that Colombia suffers till this day, and seems like a complete mess unlikely to be solved. As a Colombian, and citizen of Medellin, I have begun a series of articles you can find in Hubpages telling the story of the Colombian Conflict and another article with a complete analysis (with the movie taken from Youtube) of Rodrigo D No Futuro.
You can find both by going in to Hubpages or searching on Google:

7905055,5,B000007NMZ,"Classic film from Colombia from famed director Victor Gaviria. In this film he takes us to the mean streets of Medellin back in the late 80's through the eyes of its youth. To be honest the level of despair and feeling of nothingness and crushing poverty makes a very grim picture. However it was an honest film, Mr. Gaviria used real street kids to capture its authenticity. In doing so, a rare film was made, truly a must see.",1341878400,,428,4.430379746835443
7905056,4,B000007NMZ,"This is kind of like a ""City of God"" from Colombia in as much as it focuses on the youth in the roughest, poorest areas of a South American country.

The focus is on how punk rock is interpreted in Colombia by these street kids. Some reviews have said that these kids are the opposite of the DIY ethos of punk because they actually pursue material things, through crime. But that is kind of missing the point. These kids live in poverty. Half of their homes are barely finished structures.

They lead desperate and marginalized lives. With the anti-authoritarin chants and sloganeering and nihilism, punk rock makes the best soundtrack for it.

Rodrigo is the one kid who seems to have any depth to him. Still bereaved after his mothers passing, he struggles to find a way to channel his frustration and interest. The only thing he wants to do is play drums, but he has not sticks or kit. He also has a morbid fascination with heights, foreshadowing what's to come.

I enjoyed the movie more for being a glimpse into another world. I grew up into punk rock in New York. I knew plenty of latino skin heads and punk rockers and it was just funny to see some of the parallels.",1257552000,,1173,4.4672897196261685
7905057,5,B000007NMZ,"Rodrigo D: No Futuro follows a teenager, Rodrigo, as he goes about his day, struggling to find meaning and alleviate this huge weight of boredom and hopelessness that plague him and his friends and acquaintances.  Rodrigo is an aspiring drummer but no matter how hard he tries, he can't drum the demons out of his head.",1253923200,,319,4.696428571428571
7905058,5,B000007NMZ,"I'll say that the first time i saw this movie i was 16. I am honest saying that at that time i didn't like it. I was expecting something different and at that time the movie industry in colombia was in its beginning so i expected to see something more like a hollywood movie on those days.

As the years gone by i found this dvd on amazon and decided to purchase it. Well....now it's different. Now i understand the movie a little bit more but it's still confussing. But there's something really clear now...this is a great movie if you watch it as a documentary of the life in Medellin at 90's.

The apathy of this teenager, who become a great colombian actor afterwards Ramiro Meneses, and his dream to start a punk band, with no talent, except the one of waving the drum sticks on the air, makes you feel in a documentary movie the same as ones that you see about guys on the National Geographic Channel but with more non-sense violence and no future.",1152921600,2,954,4.353932584269663
7905059,2,B000007NMZ,"Rodrigo D is suppose to represent a ""reality"" film before ""reality"" TV emerged as a common and popular viewing choice.  We are to follow the daily routine of Rodrigo D, a very poor and angry young man, as he trys to understand where he is going and what he wants to be/do.  Curously, Rodirgo is suppose to be a drummer in a Punk band.  But we never see him play the drums.  In fact, his best musical effort is purchasing a set of drum sticks for 150 pesos...about $0.08.

Rodrigo, like the film, just drifts from place to place, moment to moment...mostly arguing, fighting, yelling and lieing his way about town.  Along the way he steals some things, meets some friends, and they get killed, In the end, of course, he lives and the film ends.

Senseless, meaningless, useless...Rodrigo D goes no where...just like his film.  Those who may have been killed duringthis filming, or shortly thereafter, arethe lucky one.",1127433600,2,916,4.68125
7905060,4,B000007NMZ,"If you haven't watched this movie then be warned ... this is an extremely difficult one to watch.  And it's certainly not for everyone.  But if you can stomach the poverty, the violence, the hopelessness and the senselessness that pours out of every shot then don't miss this.  The story follows a group of teenagers (some of them young actors, others kids picked off the streets) trying to survive in the seedier part of the town of Medellin, the citadel of the Colombian drug lords.  The town is a maze of unauthorized ugly brick constructions and the potholed roads look undrivable, mirroring the despair and aimlessness in the lives of its residents.  School dropouts turn to drug-peddling and car thefts to have enough money for food and beer.  Life is cheap and guns are used like toys.  The fact that four of the boys appearing in this film died before it was completed only reinforces its impact.

It has taken a long time for this to come out on DVD, but that wait is now thankfully over. Living in the U.S. or indeed in most other parts of the world, it is difficult to imagine that this depicts a breathing town where people still continue to live their lives.  Not a single shot in the movie is visually or emotionally pleasing; you feel downright unpleasant when it ends, but this is life in Medellin portrayed almost like a documentary.  Most of these people have never seen anything different or better ... this is the reality for them, and I would call it remarkable to have been able to share that for an hour and a half.

If you didn't like the film, then that's understandable.  I admit that I would certainly think more than twice before traveling to Medellin.  If you did, then also watch Mira Nair's ""Salaam Bombay"" if you haven't.  Its another movie made with street urchins halfway across the world, but the underlying common theme comes across just as vividly ... dreamless lives looking at grey days turning greyer.",1100908800,9,1941,4.637426900584796
7905061,5,B000007NMZ,"Rodrigo D is finally, and most deservedly, available on DVD.  This extraordinary film from Colombia is certainly one of the most powerful and moving documents concerning the waste, poverty, and violence of life among the underclass in Medellin.

Using primarily street kids for his film, Victor Gaviria provides an unflinching portrait of their lives:  trying to make money and have fun; running and hiding from the cops who would beat, disappear, or kill them; turning their own violence on each other.  The story focuses on Rodrigo who, throughout the film, is trying to find drumsticks and music lessons so that he can realize his dream of being a punk musician.  He is inhibited by poverty, the loss of his mother, animosity from his family, and the violence which proscribes his life.  He is overwhelmed and ultimately sees but one way out.

Mr. Gaviria, in a postscipt, points out that six of the beautiful boys in his film were dead by the time it was finished, victim of the senseless violence in Medellin.  One can only imagine how many more have gone after, and how many more will, in a society where repression and poverty replace hope.

Thanks to the producers of this DVD who also saw the necessity of an presenting this important film to a larger audience.  It must be seen.",1094169600,15,1288,4.761261261261262
7905062,5,B000007NMZ,"I have seen this movie before, wayyy before I get into independent movies and I fall inlove with it, I have been trying to gte this movie forver and I am so suprise that I found it is not even relese yet and I am going to buy ittt is a most buy moviee..",1091145600,3,253,3.7037037037037037
7905063,5,B000007NMZ,"In an almost documentary style, Victor Gavina has created a remarkable film of life at the bottom in Medellin.  Oppressed, disappeared, beaten, or killed by police, these children of the streets have little to do but rob for a living, [destroy] for sport or defense, drink beer and take drugs to pass the time.  Rodrigo wants more, and imagines himself a drummer in a punk band.  He spends much time throughout the film in a heart-breaking search for drumsticks and music lessons so he can pursue his dream.
Gavina employed many actual street children in his powerful film and informs us, in a final twist to the gut, that five of them were killed before its release.  One can only wonder how many have died since.  It is all the more important, therefore, that Gavina has bestowed upon them a humanity, humor, posterity, and grace that life did not.
""Rodrigo D"" is one of the great little films of all time.  It should be lovingly transferred to DVD so all can see, and take to heart its important message.",1060387200,3,1007,4.597765363128492
