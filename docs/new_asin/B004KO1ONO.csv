4397480,5,B004KO1ONO,Can't say enough about these 2 films they can be purchased like this or seperately. They both are very thought provoking and enlightening do not want to spoil it for you. Very good Films.,1401840000,,187,4.529411764705882
4397481,5,B004KO1ONO,"""Sarah's Choice"" is an excellent pro life movie done in a real way. The movie is not preachy, the acting is excellent and the story line is very spiritually uplifting. Sarah, considering an abortion has three visions to visit her. In a unique way, the results of what will happen with each choice that Sarah would make, if she chooses to make them.

""Hidden Secrets"" is an excellent movie dealing with secrets each of a group of friends meeting each other at the funeral of a Christian friend they all knew. Each of the group has a hidden sin secret that is revealed as time goes along and how the forgiveness of Jesus reconciles them with their lives.",1400284800,,652,4.52542372881356
4397482,4,B004KO1ONO,"This movie took a very long time to arrive in the mail, but was worth the wait.  Love both of the movies. The acting quality of Christian movies is getting much better.  ""Hidden Secrets"" was a very pleasant surprise.  The story was great and there was some good humor in the the movie that worked. Would highly recommend both movies.",1359072000,,333,4.516666666666667
4397483,5,B004KO1ONO,"I had purchased this movie combination because of two reasons, the first was Sarah's Choice, I had seen part of this movie on TCT and wanted to know ""the rest of the story"", was really pleased with the way it was acted out and the pro-life choice from a different perspective (from an adult woman that is advancing her career and finds out that she is pregnant unexpectedly), it didn't focus as much on the more often take of a young teen getting pregant while in high school (although this was adressed from a current co-worker of Sarah's).  Good movie for familes and youth groups alike.

Hidden Secrets was also good.  I won't go into details about the story line since it has already been throughly covered.  It was a really good film that I will not be disappointed to watch over again.  The way the story was played out was really good and had some unexpected twists and turns that kept us from being bored or frustrated.",1342742400,,927,4.494047619047619
4397484,5,B004KO1ONO,"Great movie..Shows Christians at different stages. Very real, there is NO sin God did not already forgive. I would recommend
this movie to everyone.",1341360000,,148,5.208333333333333
4397485,5,B004KO1ONO,"I really liked both of these movies--Hidden Secrets more than Sarah's Choice--loved the acting by John Schneider, who by the way really has come a long way from ""Dukes of Hazzard"". The message in both movies is great, although very different shows you come away with the same message ""Judge not lest you be judged"" ~ and you realize that a mistake in the worlds opinion can be a miracle in God's hand. It is never too late to give your issues to Him.",1336003200,3,450,4.369047619047619
4397486,5,B004KO1ONO,"Sarah's Choice & Hidden Secrets are without a doubt FAITH BASED movies. It is the content's intent to promote a specific lean on what are often controversial issues. So without attempting to delve into the pros and cons of any social, religious, or political issues, this pair of movies do provide entertainment, with a mix of good performances with some stars as well as lesser known actors. Both films are also available individually, or used, having been previously released in 2009 and 2008 respectively. The religious tendency is toward a Christian point of view, but the issues are personal and often confronted by many of different faith persuasions.

SARAH'S CHOICE is led by singer, Rebecca St. James, as Sarah. She's not new to faith based movies, and even has more in the works as supporting and lead actress. She does a believable job as a young advancing female businesswoman who becomes pregnant and has to consider how it might influence her life/career. She considers ALL choices, including abortion. Actually the film presents arguments on both sides of the issue, but obviously favors the Christian perspective. Dick Van Patten plays his first clergy role, perhaps better known for his late 70s TV series ""Eight is Enough"". Funny man Brad Stein has some funny lines, but actually plays more of a straight serious uncle here, especially as compared with his role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christmas-with-a-Capital-C/dp/B005BRFN8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christmas with a Capital C</a>.

Sarah's colleague Megan is played by Logan White, has also co-produced herself in ""Hidden Secrets"". Her husband, David A.R.White, produced in both films in this combo DVD set, as well as acted & wrote in ""Hidden Secrets.""

HIDDEN SECRETS also stars John Schneider (yes, from Dukes of Hazard) who is a bit of the successful bad guy in this film. It's an interesting story with plenty of comedy as well as some very serious moments. It leaves the viewer entertained as well as thinking on some important issues of life. It is one of White's better roles. The plot is about friends gathering to bury a member of their `gang' of long ago. Of course lives have changed, secrets between them have to be re-encountered, and personalities begin to unfold, sometimes in conflict. It's a masterful mix of subplots and a wonderfully made film. A step ahead of most faith based films. They are getting better; they have to, to compete with the likes of ""Fireproof"" and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Courageous/dp/B0062NAX1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Courageous</a>.

Both films are worth the time of viewing. But expect a Christian influenced direction in the outcomes of characters in both movies. It IS the reason for producing them.",1325635200,5,2828,5.479357798165138

8433260,2,B004KO1ONO,"Two slow moving films.
Sarah's Choice drags as the story progresses.  The plot spends too much time going through the many choices she could make
about her unborn child.  It became tedious to watch.
Hidden Secrets was boring enough so I couldn't watch all of it.",1432339200,,262,4.673913043478261
