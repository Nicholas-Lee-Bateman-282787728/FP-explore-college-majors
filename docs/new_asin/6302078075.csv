440792,3,6302078075,"I've watched the first five minutes of this movie three times, and I love it.  It's 1918 and a straggling company of mud-splattered American Marines are marching through a bleak, barren and blasted landscape, led by Captain Jimmy Cagney.  They approach a small French village.  One of the men fall out of line to drink a dipper of water.  A tall, neat and clean Marine barks ""What company is this?""  The weary marine treats him with disdain and answers with sarcasm.  The barking soldier, top soldier Dan Dailey, is here as a replacement, with green recruit Robert Wagner in tow.  Learning who commands the company Dailey tells Wagner they'll wait until the last minute before joining the company - there's obviously some bad blood between Dailey and Cagney.  The men continue marching, nearing the village.  We see the pretty - heck, gorgeous - inn-keeper's daughter Corrine Calvet race through the deserted streets of the village to get a place to watch the arriving American troops.  A company of nattily dressed French soldiers, with band, stand at attention and the band begins to play a rousing march.  Cut to a wide shot of the marching marines.  Capt. Cagney picks up his head when he hears the music, his body straightens.  Fifty feet from the bridge that separates his men from the welcoming French troop Cagney barks an order and the straggley men fall into line and, well, look sharp.  The men pass in review - `Eyes... Right!' - and fall out.  The film cuts to a young lieutenant who is glaring at Cagney, his face a study in passionate hatred.

 This is the way any and every movie should start.  In five short minutes, including the time it takes to run the opening titles in the middle of the sequence, we're introduced to the two major characters, Cagney and Dailey, learn they don't like each other, and, with the insertion of the balefully staring lieutenant, guess Cagney is disliked by more than a few of his men.  We're even introduced to the soft leg of the movie's romantic triangle with the insertion of the Calvet character.  We meet rookie Robert Wagner, the lead player in the movie's romantic subplot.  The troops' march into the village is well-conceived, well-cut, and moving.  Before I had a chance to settle down I was emotionally invested in this movie.

 Unfortunately, it goes downhill from there.  Cagney and Dailey, it turns out, have fought together from Antwerp to Zanzibar, both as brothers-in-arms and romantic rivals.  They'll spend most of this movie bickering over Calvet.  The rivalry is meant to be of the fast paced, screwball variety, but it's too convoluted and contrived - not to mention incredible - to care much about.  The film is taken from the Maxwell Anderson stage-play, and for a motion picture it feels strangely stage bound.  In movies the camera follows characters, on the stage the actors walk onto a set.  An awful lot of the stuff going on here takes place in Cagney's office, or in the inn's bar, or in a field headquarters.  And furthermore we're never really introduced to that angry young lieutenant from the first scene, never learn why he hates Cagney so intensely, never learn why WE should have negative feelings about Cagney who seems like a standard issue `love-em-and-leave-em' soldier who'd fallen under the spell of pretty young Calvet.  If that angry young lieutenant doesn't get a chance to explain himself he does get to speak the lines in which the play's title is embedded.  Cagney's men, rested and brought back up to strength with green recruits - Robert Wagner and others - are back at the front line.  They're ordered to capture a German officer for interrogation purposes.  Cagney sends out some of the green troops, who don't return.  Lieutenant Angry, desperately wounded, writhes on his field sick bed and dares Cagney to capture that German officer himself.  It's wordier than that, and a whole lot more serious than the movie prepares us for, and, most importantly, the Lieutenant's rant contains the title of the movie.  Heck, we just know Cagney as an aging Lothario, not a mean/vicious/vainglorious/what-have-you commander, and having an overwrought bit player hurl a mouthful of Maxwell Anderson epithets at him is a little much.  What price glory, indeed.

 What the heck.  Reputable sources have it that Ford intended to turn what, I assume, is a Maxwell Anderson anti-war play into a musical.  That may not have been such a bad idea.  Calvet does sing to the boys in the bar a couple of times, and Wagner gets serenaded by a French girl in a blue beret.  The action sequences are bad, the `what price glory' scene is a dud, and generally this one works better when it plays it for comedy rather than drama.  WHAT PRICE GLORY isn't an awful movie, especially for those of us who are fans of Cagney and Ford, but it is awfully uneven and static.",1162684800,6,4843,4.780722891566265
440793,2,6302078075,"This was a most disappointing movie, considering the cast and director. One can only assume that John Ford was putting most of his energy towards The Quiet Man and not to What Price Glory.

The usual ""authenticity"" of a John Ford movie was evidently lacking right from the start. When you have marines refer to themselves as ""soldiers"" it is hard to watch the movie without a great deal of cynicism. The word ""soldier"" and ""army"" were bantered about by this group of marines as if they thought they were in the army. I never knew or heard of any marine that would think this way.

The movie seems to ramble without any focus or plot. It appears as if it is a group of individual skits put together and called a movie.

I gave it two stars just because of a great cast. Harry Morgan always contributes solid roles and it is fun to watch a young Robert Wagner. James Cagney is looking his age and not quite credible as a marine who could endure front-line combat.

This movie was well intended, but, as the saying goes, the road to hell is paved with good intentions!",1102723200,4,1065,4.3908629441624365
440794,3,6302078075,"""What Price Glory"" is a World War I lover's triangle set against the ravaged backdrop of French countryside circa, 1918. Drama aside, the film is not what one might expect from the directorial giant likes of John Ford.  James Cagney is a bit over the hill to be believable as Capt. Flagg, a stoic commander of a motley troupe of conscripts. Flagg's ill at ease postulating does not bode well with his men, so he turns to disrespectful and disreputable Sgt. Quirt (Dan Dailey) for a little bit of hard knock military strength. But the tensions between Flagg and Quirt are pressed to the breaking point when they both fall for the same girl - stop me if you've heard this one before. Strong performances elevate this film above the tripe that - generally - it is.
THE TRANSFER: Frankly, not up to snuff. Although the overall color scheme has retained much of its original luster, the picture quality is a disappointment. There is an excessive amount of film grain and age related artifacts throughout for a not very smooth visual presentation. Fluctuations in color balancing are - at times - severe and distracting. There is a minor amount of digital grit that further detracts from the image. Black levels are weak. Contrast and shadow delineation is poorly balanced for a very unstable looking presentation. The audio has been cleaned up but remains strident sounding and lacking in bass.  EXTRAS: As with the other war films in this batch from Fox, you get nothing to augment your experience.  BOTTOM LINE: ""What Price Glory"" isn't recommended either as a war film, or for its transfer quality. Seek satisfying your thirst for conquest elsewhere.",1085443200,12,1648,4.836879432624113
440795,4,6302078075,"Taking place in World War I is the James Cagney-Dan Dailey drama ""What Price Glory"" made in 1952 by the legendary director John Ford. Essentially the movie is a classic love triangle story set against the backdrop of the ravaged French countryside of 1918. Cagney plays the part of Capt. Flagg, a commander in charge of a ragtag group of conscripts who must rely on the brash and disrespectful Sgt. Quirt to whip them into shape. Trouble brews though when Flagg and Quirt both fall for the same girl. The movie is a triumph for all concerned both in strong performances from the actors (including a young Robert Wagner) and a technical masterpiece from the crew. The same cannot be honestly said for the DVD. Although the picture and sound are both acceptable the quality of the overall print shows some wear and there are noticeable fluctuations in the color balance.

440798,5,6302078075,"1952 movie directed by John Ford starring James Cagney as Captain Flag, a 'tough-as-nails' Marine company commander in World War One. Just after returning from the front line trenches to rest and refit his company, he receives a new top sergeant, Sergeant Quirt played by Dan Dailey, to get his new replacements ready for the next tour on the lines. Sergeant Quirt is probably the best in the Marines, but he's also a wild rival to Captain Flag and they soon show their stuff after Quirk's arrival with a quick fistfight in Flag's office.

The Marine company is full of senior battle-hardened veterans portrayed in an entertaining manner by numerous actors including William Demarest (Uncle Charlie from ""My Three Sons"") and Henry Morgan (Colonel Potter from ""M.A.S.H.""). A youthful Robert Wagner stars as one of the newly assigned juniors who falls in love with a local girl during the company's training period.

John Ford did masterful job rolling in humor, drama and romance. The film is well balanced and portrays the Marines as colorful hard-core types that do more than their share for the war effort, as well as play hard in their off time. There's good action when the company returns to the front and captures some elements of hardship in World War One's trench warfare. It's a romantic and entertaining feature that rivals Ford's other well-known feature ""The Quiet Man.""

Cagney and Daly turn in fine performances as the Company Commander and his 1st Sgt, respectively. They are both career  Marines of long service and have developed a professional respect for each  other rivaled only by their personal dislike. They both vie for the  affections of the inkeeper's daughter with predictable results. The  integration of fresh-faced replacements with the battleworn veteran Marines  brings some lighthearted moments.  The tone is more serious in the few  short battle scenes and the ending where Quirt leaves Charmaine to rejoin  the company moving out for the next push is one easily related by any  Marine viewer. It is a remake of an earlier silent film and I regret I have  been unable to obtain a copy of the original as I am sure it is excellent.  However, I feel Mr. Maltin in his review above dismisses it without even  viewing it. The review and synopsis don't even get the right war, referring  to WW2, and seem to not realize they players are Marines.

More romance and shinanigans than warfighting, plus a lot of hard drinking and internal conflcit (especially between an officer and enlisted man) which would get you court martialed in the real Army.  This is a very campy movie, which overall was disappointing giving the cast.  Still, James Cagney's acting alone makes this worth seeing.

440878,2,6302078075,"What Price Glory, 1952 film

This is based on a Broadway play from the 1920s. It was first made into a silent movie, before the Hollywood Production Code of 1934. A movie allows scenes that could not be easily performed on a stage. This story tells about life in 1917 and peoples attitudes. That picture from a pack of cigarettes is dated. [What baseball players smoked and damaged their wind? One movie star advertised cigarettes but never smoked them!] In WW II Marines were not used in Europe because the Army objected (they are part of the Navy). Aye, sir. Sgt. Quirt reports to Capt. Flagg; they are old friends. [You can tell by their behavior.] Quirt has a problem with the bottle; the others are warned about him. They show scenes of training and marching to pad out the story. [Doing the laundry by the canal?] Charmaine speaks American, she learned English in school. What age have you? Flaggs journey is interrupted by a crash into a pile of organic fertilizer on his return from Paris.

These Marines are ordered to move up to straighten out the line. A Frenchman has a complaint about his daughter. Think fast, Captain Flagg. He points to Sgt. Quirt. A formal charge could mean serious punishment for him. [The silent film version was more explicit: SOL.] The Marines have landed and the situation is well in hand. They are ordered to move out in twenty minutes. The marriage will be postponed. Im sorry, Charmaine. Its a lousy war, kid, but its the only one weve got. Troops are blessed before they move out. Some are sent to the brig by Sgt. Quirt. Later the troops return. We see fresh graves. Next soldiers march though a field into machine gun fire; some fall. Grenades silence the machine gunners. One soldier is wounded and given pills; it is a ticket home. A replacement Lieutenant arrives. The telephone gives orders to capture an enemy Staff officer. But these men don't return. What price glory now? Flagg and Quirt will they their luck, crawling through mud. They reach their destination and accomplish their mission. But the Oberst doesnt make it back.

Sgt. Quirt is given a tetanus shot and sent to sick bay. An explosion wounds a soldier. A telephone call brings new orders: take the railroad station and hold it. Sgt. Quirt meets Charmaine again. Lewisons plans for marriage have ended. Capt. Flagg mourns for the lost boys. Sgt. Quirt arrives, there is conflict and drinking. Will there be a contest for Charmaine? Dice or cards? I plugged him! A messenger tells of a Big Push towards the front. All leaves are cancelled. Capt. Flagg, drunk, will march to the front. He has a premonition. Nobody knows where we are going. Sgt. Quirt also leaves, limping along. [And so this story ends.]

Neither the 1920s version or this one are readily available. Was this meant as a comic version of a serious play? There were few movies made about The Great War compared to WW II. It is worth watching once. The background seems authentic; note the colorful tones. There was no mention of the poison gas used then. This was not used in WW II for two reasons. It depends on wind  which can change directions and affect others; and was outlawed by common consent. Gas masks were improved. They used flame throwers for local combat. The original play was followed by a popular melody called Charmaine, which is seldom heard today on the radio. Did Charmaine serve as a symbol for what was wanted but could not be possessed?",1397520000,,3438,4.67603305785124

Their ongoing fisticuffs are over the affections of a French bar girl. The combat scenes are silly, Cagney looks way too portly in this role, and the dialogue is atrocious. One example: he keeps bemoaning how ""they keep sending me these... these darned KIDS!  All the veteran Marines have gone to their maker"", and ""when's this war ever gonna end"" -type crap, which would make better sense in a WWII movie, and GREAT sense in a Vietnam movie.

440886,4,6302078075,"What Price Glory(released July/52) is a remake of the 1926 film of the same name directed then by Raoul Walsh. Walsh had a very similar rep back then as an actor's/guy's director,just as Ford enjoyed in later years. The original starred a younger Edmund Lowe and Victor McLaglen in the main roles,while this 1952 version has James Cagney as Capt. Flagg and Dan Dailey as Sgt. Quirt,respectively. I must say I prefer the original version as it was much more raw. Also if you looked closely you could see it's leading actors actually cursing,not saying what the inter titles informed one they were. Actually it brings to mind another Raoul Walsh production in 1928 of Sadie Thompson. If you watch Gloria Swanson yelling at Lionel Barrymore she isn't verbally holding back either. And actually this was much more common in the silent era than most think. But I digress.
The story of this 1952 version has us in WW1 and Capt. Flagg seems to be one of the most despised and hard boiled leaders of men the Marines ever had. His platoon has just come back from the front and are resting in a small French village. Enter Sgt. Quirt,who is well known to Capt. Flagg and whom he busted once before for conduct unbecoming. The two will resort to fisticuffs on a moments notice,as one or the other will draw an ""X""with chalk on the floor and away they go. Flagg and Quirt's on going love/hate relationship however does not interfere with war duties;that is where they think alike. Flagg knows Quirt is the best sergeant the Marines ever produced and is a useful component in the overall scheme of things.
Thrown into this mix is Charmaine(Corrine Calvet),the daughter of a local tavern owner. She is in love with both the good captain and the sergeant. She has asked the captain to marry her but he refuses. Just before the company is called up to the front again(unbeknownst to Quirt),Quirt is being forced to marry her due to a complaint made by the father. As Flagg stands as a witness,his commanding officer appears and apologizes to the couple-to-be about not being able to stay because of the imminent ""push"" by his troops. Quirt catches on and refuses to marry Charmaine.
Out on the front orders come down to capture a German officer at a particular farm house. Soldiers sent out never come back. Quirt and Flagg both sneak to the farmhouse at night. They shoot three officers and by happenstance take one prisoner. On the way back a shell promptly kills their hostage and slightly wounds Quirt. Back safely behind lines Flagg is bemoaning their bad luck when in comes a young Robert Wagner as Private Lewisohn. He has nabbed himself an officer and saved Flagg's bacon. Just as he goes to leave the private is killed by an incoming shell and Flagg breaks down. Shortly there after he receives orders to take the farmhouse he just came from and hold it.
A few days later and the platoon is back in the French town. This time Flagg is bound and determined to finally marry Charmaine. She agrees. However Quirt has been there ahead of him and as Flagg and Charmaine hold each other,Quirt enters. All bets are off. The men square off,both determined to marry her. They each toast with drink after drink,and soon they're pie-eyed. They finally agree to settle the situation in a poker game. The final card is dealt and Quirt would have won if Flagg hadn't started laughing/bluffing before handing it to him,and he walked out in a huff. Soon orders come for Flagg to take his men back to the front. At first Flagg tells his men that they never found him and to make anything up because he doesn't want to leave Charmaine. But the call of duty is too strong and Flagg relents and tells Charmaine it is for the best and leaves. Shortly after Quirt reappears and he and Charmaine embrace and kiss. But duty calls to Quirt also,and he hobbles off to join Flagg and the boys.
Ford made an excellent choice in Cagney,for Cagney played it like his fans expected him to:rough,no nonsense and willing to take on any man in the house. Dailey as Quirt had some job to do to measure up to Cagney,but surprisingly he somehow managed to pull it off. I have never been a Dailey fan,as I have always considered him a rather weak actor. But this is certainly one of Dailey's best performances in any film. The action as far as the war goes is well done and gripping,and throughout there is always the noise of shells in the distance to keep you rooted to the fact there is a war going on,despite what you see on screen. The film also has many funny moments thrown into the mix to lighten things up. The only complaint I can really muster is the last 20 minutes or so seem to last a little longer than they should. Otherwise it generally moved along well.
Technically speaking  the film is in full screen,in colour and the picture overall is generally good. Extras include the two trailers.
All in all a pretty good entry by John Ford whose two leading men Cagney and Dailey do a good job in their respective roles. The picture is them,and the rest do their jobs in making them shine. 3 1/2-4 stars.",1368403200,,5070,4.559210526315789

Cagney does his thing in this light comedy-drama set in 1918 at the Front in France. He and Dan Dailey are old warhorses...who take up arms and put them down again throughout, as mental and physical exhaustion take hold on these fighters - perhaps 15 years too old to be in combat - and as a shared romantic interest with a ""local"" girl, an innkeeper's daughter (fighting her own internal war, as she must decide which soldier she will marry - or will she marry at all), compounds the drama.

The movie is based upon a fairly pedestrian play and strangely, John Ford does not expand the story beyond the confines of a shelter or inn. One wonders if Ford knew he had a tight budget and so freed up Cagney to go completely over the top with Cagneyisms. The man could act. And he lifts a B-movie to a B+, getting all he can get from a good, albeit cliched script.",1292544000,4,868,4.319018404907975
440929,4,6302078075,"""What Price Glory"" is neither a comedy nor a war film but more of a military spoof about two servicemen, Captain Flagg (James Cagney) and F/Sgt Quirt (Dan Dailey), set in WWI era France.  Both men are professionals and respect each other's abilities but they have a long standing love hate relationship going back many years.  Now they find themselves together again facing WWI with a company of men who are no more than children or old men.  Even the officers are nothing more than ""college boys"" lacking any real experience.  Flagg and Quirt know the sacrifice that must be made but seek to carefully guard the lives of the boys entrusted to them.

Directed by John Ford, his underlying theme is devotion to what is just and of being part of and playing for the team.  All through the movie are seen examples of the men making sacrifices of what they want for what they know must be done.  Against his desires to get even with Quirt, Flagg knows Quirt's abilities are needed for the greater good and saves him from a forced marriage.  Quirt throws two of the weaker soldiers in the brig to save their lives from the front lines.  Quirt and Flagg take on a mission on their own to avoid sending others who they know lack experience and finally old and young soldiers join the march to the front even though they are excused.

There are plenty of humorous moments in the movie and the interplay between Cagney and Dailey is classic sitcom but this is not a war film or a story of an historical event.  It is simply set in a WWI setting.  The movie has conflictions in terms in that the men are supposed to be a company of Marines but always refereed to as soldiers and of being part of the army.  The movie stresses that except for Flagg and Quirt this is a ""citizen's army"" and that the men are not professionals thus posing the larger problem for Flagg and Quirt to not sacrifice them needlessly.  Over all this is an entertaining movie as a mix of sitcom with the seriousness of war.

440930,4,6302078075,"A very enjoyable James Cagney movie, very little war, mostly comedy. The film has been very well remastered. Dan Dailey, who was 11 years younger than James Cagney and also an excellent 'song and dance man' plays a brilliant character as a foil to Cagney. Highly recommended.",1241395200,,275,4.872340425531915

440933,2,6302078075,"I know what you're thinking -- with John Ford and Jimmy Cagney, how could one go wrong?

By using a stage play as the source material, that's how. The action, such as it is, rarely leaves the confines of a saloon and its environs. If you're looking for a gripping treatment of WWI trench warfare, you'd better keep looking.

This movie is not about WWI at all -- it's about (1) a love triangle made up of 3 one-dimensional characters, and (2)drinking. And in fact, it's really alot more about (2) than (1). It is, in fact, an anthem to something that Ford and his entourage believed in religiously: alchohol.

Why does the French girl like either of two guys? We never find out.

After a while, it just gets sort of tiresome.

This has not been my best review on Amazon, but there's really just not much to say. Five years after this joke of a movie came out, Stanley Kubrick directed Paths of Glory -- a treatment of WWI which quickly achieved classic status and is just as compelling today as it was when it was first released. I wonder if Ford ever saw it and if it was even possible for him to be embarrassed by what he had done.",1186617600,3,1133,4.300469483568075
440934,5,6302078075,"I happen to love this Marine film...it appealed to my Marine persona throughout the movie...it may have dwelled on the love interests in the Reserve Area at length, but the mud-Marines and their jargon was real and chippy...I thought Jimmy Gleason stole his scenes while on camera like the old pro he always was...the casting was superb...Bob Wagner and Marisa Pavan were perfectly cast as the young star/crossed lovers caught up in events beyond their control...the great John Ford had his stamp all over the hi/jinks that popped up away from the battlefield as well as Marines in battle/combat... Ford's professional acumen shows clearly the Marine camraderie between the enlisted ranks [young an old] was evident to me; rather than, to rip this war film apart, it had the battle/crest of the type of fighting men Marines are in all wars [past or present] with a few light moments in the Reserve Area with all its human entanglements that are sure to surface to the chagrin of Marine Officers...to this [Korean War] combat Marine, ""What Price Glory"" rates a 5 star rating of a movie....enjoy this DVD...Semper Fidelis....SSGT CHRIS SARNO-USMC FMF",1175731200,3,1148,5.015706806282722

7822823,5,6302078075,My favorite Cagney movie. Mixed in with the huff and gruff and comedy is a real sense of what it was like to fight in WWI. Both James Cagney and Dan Dailey deliver believable characters in this tale of constant battling between a Marine Captain and top sergeant. A battle that had been going on long before the war started. Now enters a girl.....You're on your own from here. See it.,1457568000,,383,4.408450704225352
