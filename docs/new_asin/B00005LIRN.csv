1622949,5,B00005LIRN,"I had purchased this video some time ago and watched it once with my husband.  Last week I decided to watch it again, this time alone.  Even though I had seen it before, it had me jumping at every little sound.  This video is just plain scary.

The segments of the University campus in Ohio and Leap Castle are especially intriguing.  I'm still wondering how the young man who visited the dungeon happened to get blood on his hand, yet no cut ever appeared.  The Black Mausoleum of Bloody MacKenzie is probably the best example of poltergeist activity to present to any skeptic.  And the haunted mission in California gives one pause when considering the existence of ghosts.  Just who did ring that bell???

All in all this is one scary video.  I sincerely wish this show would be brought back on TV.  There are still plenty of places to explore and the success of current shows dealing with ghosts and hauntings proves there is certainly quite an audience ready for more of this type of ghostly entertainment.  If this is not possible--more videos, please!",1099785600,17,1058,4.65945945945946
1622950,5,B00005LIRN,"Scariest Places on Earth (SPOE) is one of my favorite shows of all. My son loves to watch this video too. I can tell the people are scared by seeing the look upon their faces. I wish that the network had come out with more videos for people to buy. But, all in all if you were a fan of this weekly tv show you will love this video. It only has a very few episodes on it but, I think it is worth it!",1069113600,15,398,3.6941176470588237
1622951,5,B00005LIRN,"I love this show.  The great thing about it is that I can watch it with my twelve-year-old neice and not have to worry about the content.  It's scary, but it's good clean fun.",1064793600,8,175,4.117647058823529
1622952,5,B00005LIRN,"This tape consists of the best TV moments, and is fastinating. The viewers are given a honest history of the locations that adds to the atmosphere.
 Fans of the show or those with an interest in the paranormal should pick up a copy!",1040169600,9,232,4.395348837209302
1622953,5,B00005LIRN,I just got this video and I enjoyed it alot. I just started watching the show recently and liked it from the first episode I saw. This video has some very creepy places visited and I hope that another volume is released. My favorite segment is Satan's Dormitory. I hope the entire first season will be released on video or DVD.A great video to watch late at night in a dark room.,1029542400,,379,4.277777777777778
1622954,5,B00005LIRN,i bought this video because i'm a big fan of the TV show. and this has some good clips from the show on it. you won't regret it.,1015804800,8,128,3.607142857142857
1622955,5,B00005LIRN,"Usually, when I see ""haunted places"" stories, they are the standard, lame fare of other people telling stories and no actual footage of these people in the haunted places.  No proof in other words.  This video is different.  When I first saw it, I was rather excited at the concept.  A family spends the night in a haunted place using scientific tools to measure changes in atmosphere and temperature.  I watched, eager to see how this was going to unfold.  Not only was I kept hooked to this story, but it was truly frightening in many places.  For example, there was a doll that was sweating on its own, a piano that played itself (it wasn't a trick or the kind that is made to play on its own), furniture that moved on its own, voices that came from nowhere and screams that were not made by the visitors or the crew.  I highly recommend this video.  You won't be dissapointed!",1015113600,15,880,4.416149068322981

7944263,4,B00005LIRN,"I'm not sure if all the episodes are the same, but the tape I received follows Pentagram University in Athens, Ohio, Axe Murder House in Villisca, Ohio, and Hayden Bridge Exorcism. the tape is narrated by Linda Blair and is the same show presented by Fox Family. It was sufficiently creepy and the VHS tape is in good working condition, if they release the series as a set I would definitely buy it.",1353369600,2,399,4.47945205479452
7944264,2,B00005LIRN,"I'm into the supernatural,and remember watching this around Halloween. I think they still show it, come the season.
The premise is the tale being retold, followed by 1st hand accounts of sightings, and other unusual findings. They return to the area in question, with cameras showing their faces throughout the venture. I'm not sure but I don't recall showing the suspected haunted area, and few noises, other than the explorers freaking out.
This show lacks depth, and somewhat motivation. They could have referenced old town records, and or historians of the affected area, and areas. Most of the talk here comes from teens, looking for excitement.
Adults unfortunately rarely take these adolescents seriously.",1212451200,,712,5.3097345132743365
7944265,5,B00005LIRN,"ok,ok When is this coming out on dvd ?????? and is this the only season ... there was more then this .....",1188777600,4,106,3.8636363636363638
7944266,3,B00005LIRN,"This does not contain full episodes of any of the places the series visited. It's the in-between stuff, when they'd have a narrator going into places like the tombs under Rome and Alister Crowley's mansion. That was never the best of the series.

I'd hope that Family Channel would give Robson the rights to his project and let him release it on DVD or something. I loved this series, and look forward to repeats at Halloween., since they don't play any other time. But last year was a huge disappointment, as they no longer show the good episodes from the original and have shot a bunch of stuff with (obviously) fake psychics and a silly hostess.

This is only good for reminding yourself that there was once a very cool show that had real families doing investigations into haunted places - but this video doesn't show it.",1183852800,3,825,4.605442176870748
7944267,5,B00005LIRN,I don't care what anyone says! This was a great show! I've enjoyed this tape time and time again and everyone always asks me where I got it from. Of course I tell them Amazon! I just wish it was offered in DVD format instead of VHS. Very fun and informative if you are interested in the paranormal.,1175558400,,298,4.155172413793103
7944268,3,B00005LIRN,"I think it's irrelevant whether or not the places visited are haunted even at all, but since it's mentioned a lot here, i'd like to say it's very unlikely. There's no way they could get that much paranormal activity from every location they visit, on every show. So the producers enhance the families experiences, with a little special effect and a lot of psychological influence.

Even though I think the effects are staged, it's obvious that the participants do not know. The amount of courage, fear and emotion, make the show entertaining in my opinion. Psychology is a powerful tool in frightening people and 'Scariest Places' obviously know how to plant the seeds, even before the participants arrive to the supposed haunted locations.

The show is just to have fun, not meant to be taken seriously in my opinion.",1129939200,2,818,4.877697841726619
7944269,4,B00005LIRN,"Contrary to a previous reviewer's commentary, this is not ""hokey comedy"", and other errors in the commentary seem to be based on a lack of understanding of the technical processes used to create the show (""black hats turning white"", etc.).

Scariest Places on Earth is a unique TV series, combining aspects of ""reality television"" (i.e. unscripted, unrehearsed participants), ghost stories, horror drama,  and documentary.

In each episode we visit a new location with a new team of participants.  Each site has a history of paranormal activity or a sinister/occult past and could be just about anywhere:  a castle in Ireland, a monastery in South America, a haunted house in New Orleans ...

The participants are often a family, or a group of friends, recruited by the show to go and investigate the site (invariably at night) to ""solve the mystery.""  The people are given typical paranormal investigator gear like temperature and electromagnetic sensors to aid in their investigations.  Since each episode takes place at night and usually in extreme darkness or low-light, night-vision cameras are used extensively so that we can see the action clearly.  In fact, each participant is fitted with a camera around their neck solely to catch their reactions!

The night-vision cameras use the infra-red spectrum to capture an image, which means that the color of people's clothes may appear to change when moving from a normal camera to night-vision (hence the ""black hat becoming white"").

Since participants are literally ""kept in the dark"" for hours at a time (they don't have access to the night-vision as we do), and are exploring very spooky and elaborately tricked-out spaces, they often become panicky and hysterical.  And you would too!  Even safe at home as a viewer you might get goosebumps.

Though it's never discussed (unlike MTV's Fear), each site is obviously rigged to enhance the atmosphere with objects that appear to move on their own, stairs that creak as ghosts descend behind you, cold spots to be detected with the gear, etc.  Some of these effects are kept off-camera, which might be frustrating for some viewers.

All in all, the show is very well put together, and has a huge cult following.  The writing (intro and voice-over) is excellent, and creepily delivered by the artists.  The camera work and editing is equally good.  Linda Blair (The Exorcist) makes few and, for the most part, completely superfluous appearances as the show's host, but also apparently served as creative consultant.

I loved this show, and I hope they make more!",1121644800,8,2567,5.066666666666666
7944270,1,B00005LIRN,"After reading the other reviews here I thought this would be a terrific spine-tingling compilation of scary stories...but rather than producing chills, it produced gales of laughter from me and my husband.  The backstories of all these ""haunted"" places are very intriguing, and some of the footage is interesting, but the people who do the investigating are obviously hamming it up for the cameras, the special effects are obviously staged, and they try to use lighting to make things look spooky, but with hilarious results--such as having people point flashlights up from their chins, a la Blair Witch. It's so obviously staged that one scene [SLIGHT SPOILER] shows a girl entering a spooky tunnel from the back, and her cap is black. When it shows her from the front, pointing the light up from her chin, her hat is suddenly white. Back and forth it goes, with her hat changing colors.  Many scenes of the ""investigators"" have the camera bobbling around as people scream, and you have absolutely no idea what they're screaming at.  Often the narrator says that a person goes into a room alone, yet there is a camera following them around.  And why is it that all of the ""investigators"" are students?  Because their screaming is louder and shriller than adults?  The funniest thing, though, is the voiceovers by Zelda Rubinstein, the delightful little woman from Poltergeist and Picket Fences.  Her voice is decidedly spooky alright, but because this video is so funny already, her ""narration of impending doom"" makes things even more amusing.  I'd say that if you're in the market for a good frightening video, you'd be better off renting Thirteen Ghosts--or if you have access to older movies, check out Helter Skelter, In Cold Blood (with Robert Blake), or even Aliens.  While ""Scariest Places on Earth"" is mildly interesting, the main entertainment is in how funny it is--unfortunately it's not the least bit scary.",1104192000,3,1921,4.978125
