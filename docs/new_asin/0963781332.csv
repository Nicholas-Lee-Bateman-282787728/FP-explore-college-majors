7793709,4,0963781332,"Lexie Cannes is a dark, spooky, moody film. It was filmed largely by a handheld camera which adds to the suspense and sense of 'being there'as Lexie is persued by a stalker. Additionally, Lexie is deaf; again adding to the suspense and making it harder for her to stay safe. Moody, suspenseful, and a huge dose of realism. I was constantly looking over my shoulder when I went out later that night. Two thumbs up!",1353974400,5,413,4.52
7793710,4,0963781332,"""Lexie Cannes"" is a powerful, moving cinema experience, full of moody dark shadows and glimmers of light. It follows the life of a woman seeking self fulfillment and acceptance even as she is pursued by a violent criminal. She is a brave, beautiful and engaging heroine who must overcome great disadvantages in life and does so bravely. The cinematic experience is a unique one--raw, personal and, in the end, sweet. I recommend this most highly, especially to those seeking a break from slick, formulaic Hollywood productions built on gratuitous sex and violence.",1353974400,3,564,5.141304347826087
