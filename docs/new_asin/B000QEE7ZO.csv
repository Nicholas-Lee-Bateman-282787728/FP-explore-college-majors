""Ever had the bottom drop out from under you? Have your dreams ever been shattered or your hopes crushed? Does it seem like the light at the end of the tunnel is dim and God isn't listening anymore? If this sounds familiar, don't give up. There is good news for you!

In his video, ""The Power of Song,"" David Ring shares how we can get God's attention in our most desperate situations. It doesn't matter what we have been through; God has provided a key to set us free. There is victory in Jesus for everyone. Just as God opened the jail cell for Paul and Silas in their midnight hour, He will do the same for you.

Throughout the ages music has had the power to move us. A simple song can bring tears to our eyes or joy to our hearts. It can transport us beyond our day to day troubles to a place of freedom and peace. If you have ever tapped your foot to a good old gospel tune in a little country church, at a big gospel sing, or in the quiet of your home, you know what that means. God used a song early in David's life to mend his broken heart. Later, David would use a familiar hymn, ""Victory in Jesus,"" to share the gospel story. God still uses the power of a song to transform lives today. Sing! He will hear your heart's cry. Then watch the power of God fall.""",1182902400,2,1311,4.11328125
