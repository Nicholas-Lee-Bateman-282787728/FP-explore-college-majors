2632375,5,B000HA4WRU,"I was pleasantly surprised to find this boxed set and even happier to discover they are all good quality transfers. These are not the double faced disks; two disks have two movies and a third has Here Come The Waves. My favorite is Waikiki Wedding, a funny story about a bored Miss Pineapple (Shirley Ross) and the lengths Bing will go to stop her from going home and ruining his career. Bob Burns is great as Bing's sidekick and keen eyed High Chaparral fans can spot a young Leif Ericson as Ross's irate boyfriend. Martha Raye's comedy is not really to my taste but that's just a personal opinion. She is also in Double or Nothing, along with Andy Devine.

There is not a bad movie in this set and I'm happy to see some of Bing's earlier work out on DVD, other than just Holiday Inn, Bells of St Mary and White Christmas. The music itself is timeless and these movies are just plain fun. Well worth buying.",1165881600,26,908,4.372781065088757

2632380,5,B000HA4WRU,"This set contains five movies. All starring the legendary Bing Crosby. I don't as a rule like musicals, but when you watch a movie with Bing, you know it's going to be a musical.

*** Spoiler Alert***
The first movie in this set is Waikiki Wedding, as the title suggests it takes place in Hawaii. If you are a fan of Hawaii Five-0 then you will be surprised to hear the word Haoli used in a picture as old as 1937. But, they do use the word very early on in the movie.  Anyways, Bing plays the son of a Pineapple businessman who heads a large pineapple company.  Bing comes up with the idea of a ""Pineapple Girl"" who receives an all expense paid trip to Hawaii. In turn her time in Hawaii is to be represented in a series of newspaper articles, that in turn would generate business for the company. The only problem, she is not having fun and wants to return home. She was told she would find romance in Hawaii and has found none. Now, Bing (Marvin) meets her accidentally, and when he finds out she is the Pineapple girl, he goes out of his way to entertain and romance her. All the time writing and sending phoney articles claiming to be from her to the newspapers. Bing(Marvin) sets up a phoney smuggling, he gets her involved with, including angry Hawaiian natives, an angry volcano and an escape. In the meantime her boyfriend from back home comes to Hawaii to find her and rescue her from her dismal time in Hawaii. Well, there is only one problem Bing has fallen in love with her. Who will she choose to be with, to marry? The fun, the laughs, and the songs it's a great movie. Don't forget the pig, the monkey and most importantly a costar that provides most of the laughs Martha Raye.

This is a very good movie. I highly recommend it.

The second movie is ""Double or Nothing"". This is a movie with just the right amount of music, comedy and suspense. The actors are superb, there is Martha Raye, William Frawley (from I Love Lucy fame) and of course others including one of my favorite actors Andy Devine. And who knew that Martha Raye or Bing Crosby could sing Scatt. There is also an ending that had me scratching my head. You will scratch yours too.

The movie starts with a couple of gentlemen tossing wallets and purses with $100 bills in them onto different locations on the street. Bing is in what appears to be a lunch counter when a dog brings him one of these wallets. Bing immediately returns the wallet to the address inside. Upon doing so, he learns that three others have out of a total of 25 people who had picked up the wallets. Here, two things happen, he meets a beautiful woman, and learns that he is invited to a meeting in a mysterious place at 8pm. Said meeting is supposed to be beneficial to him as well as the other three honest people.  The meeting turns out to be a reading of a will. The stipulations of the will are tied to an argument the deceased had with his brother. His brother felt that people were both dishonest and dumb. He felt that people were both honest and intelligent. To this end, he gave each of the four $5000 and a month to double it. Hence the title. The first to succeed would win his fortune over a million dollars. If none were to succeed, then the fortune would go to his brother. Each one creates their own means/business to double their money. The girl Bing met, is the daughter of the living brother. The four decide to pool their resources, and if any of them reached their goal, they would share the fortune. The living brother pretends to befriend them and even help them to reach their goal. All the time, trying to sabotage them. In turn, he manages to sabotage each of them in one way or another. But, sabotaged is not defeated or is it? Bing falls in love with the girl etc. This one has a great dance scene with a policeman and Bing that involves tap dancing and other great dance moves.

The movie is really really good. Even if you don't buy the set, you should see this movie. Rent it if you can.

The third movie ""East Side of Heaven"" finds Bing(Denny) a Singing telegram deliverer, usually by phone. When a drunken son of a millionaire requests that Denny deliver a birthday song to his father in person, things start to change for Denny. While singing the birthday song to the man, he becomes involved in a bitter battle for custody of the millionaires infant grandson. Denny is fired and gets a job as a singing cab driver. This causes him to postpone his wedding for the 4th time. Soon, the mother of the infant comes to Denny for help, eventually leaving the child with Denny. Leading to a series of comedic  misunderstandings. First with his fiance, then with the police etc.  This movie has it's funny parts, the story is good and Bing is in top form.

The fourth movie ""If I Had My Way"" brought a tear to my eye at the end. That is not to say it had a sad ending, it had a very happy ending as do all of these movies. This movie finds Bing (Buzz Blackwell) as a member of three friends who build bridges. One of whom has a daughter named Patricia. When Pat's father is killed while working, it is up to Buzz and Axil to bring her to her rich uncle Jarvis in New York. When they get there Jarvis denies any relationship to the girl and sends them to a relative with the same name across town. This relative accepts Patricia with open arms. Meanwhile Axel has run into an old friend who owns a restaurant. Axel's friend invites them all to a Swedish dinner. While there, they find out that the restaurant is failing and Axil's friend is just looking for a sucker to unload the restaurant on so that he can return to Wisconsin. After everyone leaves the two old friends get drunk and Axil ends up buying the restaurant with the money that both he and Buzz had saved. Now, stuck with a failing restaurant, deep in debt with bill collectors knocking at the door, Buzz must find a way to get some money to save his investment. He tricks Jarvis into giving him the money for some worthless stock Patricia's father had left her. The rest you will have to see, to see what happens and how Patricia gets into the act of saving the restaurant. This one also has a very funny scene with a squirrel and a woman with a hat.

The fifth movie ""Here come the waves"" is about two twins, one (Suzy) infatuated\crazy about the star that is Johnny Cabbott(Bing), the other(Rosemary) can't stand him. But then, all of the women seem to go crazy for the crooner. Johnny and the two girls enlist in the Navy. They meet several times, Rosemary starts to fall for Johnny as she gets to know the him that is not the star. Suzy learns that Johnny is being sent out to sea on a battleship, and writes a letter to the head of the Navy. In the letter she suggest's that Johnny not be put out to sea, but instead be made the head of creating an entertainment film that would encourage more women to join the Navy. Rosemary is lead to believe that Johnny wrote the letter to get out of combat. With Johnny's best friend vying for Rosemary all of the stops are pulled out as both men try to land the woman they love. In the meantime Suzy is still trying to land Johnny.

This is a very funny movie.

****Spoiler Alert Over*****

This is a great set, well worth the money, and I see that Amazon has just reduced the price to $7 and change. I am not sure how long that will last. Grab em' while you can. If you like classics like I do you will love this set.

2632388,3,B000HA4WRU,"This set contains five movies starring Bing Crosby in movies from the late 1930s to the mid 1940s.  Bing Crosby was one of the most popular singing stars of this period and any musical he stared in could be expected to make money.  Paramount, the studio Bing worked for, did not feel the need to spend a great deal of money on these pictures(Universal produced one of these movies).  Therefore the production values on these movies are low.  They also did not want their writers to get too createive on these movies. because of this, the only reason to watch four of these movies is to hear Bing sing-which he does very well, thank you.  However, one of these movies is very good, with an excellant songbook, a good plot, and very good actors to back up Bing.  This movie is 'Here Come the Waves'.

Kinda hokey but still fun. It's notable for the debut of the song ""Blue Hawaii"" which was, amazingly, the *B* side of the Academy Award (Best song) from the same movie, ""Sweet Leilani"".

2632396,3,B000HA4WRU,"This three disc(one sided) set from Universal gives us five Der Bingle films from the late 30s to the early 40s;Waikiki Wedding(released Mar/37-Paramount),Double or Nothing(released Sept/37-Paramount),East Side of Heaven(released April/39,Universal),If I had My Way(released May/40,Universal) and finally Here Come the Waves(released Dec/44,Paramount).The bulk of these films did good business when released. The plots make them just average films but the best thing about them is Bings crooning,as some wonderful standards came out of all of these films.
Waikiki Wedding sees Der Bingle as an idea man for a corporation dealing in pineapples. One of his ideas was to have a contest proclaiming the winner to be the Pineapple Queen,who would be flown to Hawaii courtesy of the company,for publicity. The winner comes over to the islands but she is not a happy camper. It's up to Bing to please the lady,and of course fall in love with her along the way. Martha Raye is on hand for some good solid laughs. Watch for a young Anthony Quinn and listen as Bing gives up with two of his biggest hits ever with Sweet Leilani and Blue Hawaii. 3 stars.
Double or Nothing finds a millionaire dying,and in his will,provisions being left for the honest folks who return deliberately planted $100 bills,to be compensated with the bulk of his estate:$1,000,000. To win the money each are given $5,000 and the first one to double it within a month gets the inheritance. Of course the guys relatives aren't impressed and they try to kybosh each & every one of them. This film co-stars Martha Raye,William Frawley(the future Fred Mertz in I Love Lucy) and Andy Devine(the future Jingles in Wild Bill Hickock).The best songs here are ""It's the Natural Thing to Do"" and ""The Moon Got In My Eye"".Watch for Bings old Rhythm Boys singing mate Harry Barris as the band leader.
East Side of Heaven co stars Joan Blondell as Bings girlfriend and Mischa Auer as his roommate. Bing and Joan are due to get married,again,but Bing loses his job singing telegrams in the postal service but gets a job singing while driving a cab...only in Hollywood folks! One day a lady friend of Bings leaves Bing with a baby in his cab and he and Mischa must hide it from not only the cops but the babie's grandfather(Sir C.Aubrey Smith).Thrown into this mix is a radio reporter just dying to save the day to further his career. The best musical number here is Sing a Song of Sunbeams. 3 stars.
If I had My Way co stars little talented Gloria Jean,Charles Winninger(solid supporting veteran of the screen),and film comedian veteran El Brendal. El Brendel,Bing and their friend Jarvis(Allyn Joslyn),whose daughter is Gloria Jean,have all worked and lived together building bridges. One night Jarvis dies in a bridge accident and Bing and El have to look after her. They write a relative in New York who is rich but he gives them the runaround and they end up at poorer relatives,but both more than willing to look after Gloria. In the meantime El costs himself, Bing and Gloria all their savings by buying a friends broken down tavern. The rest of the film involves them trying to come back from this setback. How much do you bet they do?This is the best film of the set and boasts a solid cast,with a much better plot than the rest;even though the opening set up of the father dying one can see coming two films back! Gloria Jean was Universal's newest answer to Deanna Durbin and she WAS talented,no doubt. Old vaudevillians Blanche Ring, Eddie Leonard(for everyone who thinks Jolson the premiere target for his use of blackface...think again,and get over it!)and Trixie Friganza,stop by to entertain. Also Six hits and a Miss,deemed the premier singing group of its kind by many of their peers in the industry at the time,back up alot of the singing. Songs include If I had my Way,April Played the Fiddle, Meet the Sun Halfway, I Haven't Got Time to be a Millionaire, and The Pessimistic Character. 3 1/2 -4 stars.
Finally Here come the Waves is an Uncle Sam flag waver designed for the recruitment of WAVES(Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service).I don't think there was any branch of the services that didn't get some kind of plug from a film somewhere. This film co-stars singer Betty Hutton playing a dual role as twin sisters,who do a singing act. One sister acts more in line with the Hutton was all know and love,the other a more subdued and sophisticated one. Bing is a singer with a wide and screaming following in the female sector. One of the Hutton sisters is wild about him and when both sisters join the WAVES,one of them brings along all his records. Bing himself after several attempts at joining the Navy gets a waiver and finally gets a posting on a battleship with a Navy buddy of his. The other quiet sister has no interest in Bing at all in the beginning,but alot of mix ups and faux pauxs later the tide does turn its inevitable way and the film goes out in the usual flag waving manner. Hutton does a good job playing both sisters,but the plot has just too many mix ups and does get boring quite fast. The songs from this one include the classics That old Black Magic and Accentuate the Positive. 3 stars.
Technically speaking the films are quite clear and crisp,as these are quite good prints all. There are no special features.
All in all a fair to middling group of films starring arguably the greatest singer of the 20th Century,Harry Lillis Crosby. The best one in the pack,hands down,is If I had my Way. You can't help but get suckered into a plot where a girl has been orphaned...come on! The films themselves may be overall average stuff,but some of the music to come out of these films are now standards by some of the best tune smiths of the day,sung by Bing who was at the height of his career. He made it look all so easy;then,the great ones do,don't they?",1337299200,2,5857,4.709551656920078
2632397,4,B000HA4WRU,"I can never really fault the legend that is the man, it is only modern film standards that make some of these old films seem less than top quality.  That said however, all the films make enjoyable watching.  ""Here Come The Waves"" also starring Betty Hutton contains the famous songs ""That Ol' Black Magic"" and ""Ac-cent-tchu-ate The Possitive"" and is probaby the best of the five films here. Everything comes down to each individuals taste of course but if you like old stuff this collection is brilliant entertainment.

Waikiki Wedding stars Bing and Shirley Ross, the age of the film shows, but is easy to forgive if you are a Bing fan.  Bing sings the lovely ""Sweet Leilani"" amongst others, and the old famliar ""Blue Hawaii"" (later to be sung by Elvis in the film of the same name) is sung in Hawaiian by the chorus and in English by Bing and Shirley Ross - MAGIC!.

East Side Of Heaven was a new one on me, but again a really good family type film.  It is a ""Fun"" movie and as the case text says ""The baby was so popular in this film that Universal Studios made six sequels which came to be known as the ""Baby Sandy"" series"".

While none of them are as excellent as his classics ""White Christmas"" and ""Going My Way"", most of them can be enjoyed for what they are - lively low budget musicals. The best in the set are both included on the second disc. Also featuring child star Gloria Jean, ""If I Had My Way"" has godfather Crosby attempting to provide for the orphaned girl of his best friend. My personal favorite of the set, ""East Side of Heaven"" is a hilarious comedy about two bachelors who get stuck with a baby when the mother skips town during a custody battle for the child. I found that the others, while pleasant, were fairly forgettable. Of course Crosby's easy going persona and rich baritone are winning in every film he appears in. Unfortunately, there are no special features. All in all, I'd say that this is set of early Bing Crosby movies that never became classics.",1185926400,10,1086,4.632124352331606
2632424,3,B000HA4WRU,"Bing Crosby is undoubtedly one of the greatest entertainers of the 20th century and I am definitely a fan.  I had seen most of his better known films from Going My Way to High Society, even Rhythm on the River and Birth of the Blues, but was not prepared for this box!  These are not great films, not really interesting films, and not films I want to watch again.  You would have to be a true-blue lover of the crooner before feeling justified in buying this set.  Sorry Bing.",1179878400,4,476,4.314606741573034
2632425,3,B000HA4WRU,"It is obvious that any purchaser of this DVD set must like Bing Crosby and his voice.  If not, watch at your peril.  The set consists of 2 early programmers from Paramount, 2 from Universal and one big budget wartime musical. The early Paramounts are the best because Bing's easy going charm seems genuine without any sign of the mechanical manipulation of the later Bing.

- ""Double or Nothing"" and ""Waikiki Wedding"" benefit from excellent scores, good supporting casts and witty screenplays with a degree of satire. Martha Raye steals scenes in both and the latter benefits from Shirley Ross who had one of the best voices of any screen vocalist of the thirties. There is a charming scene in the cockpit of a yacht when Bing and Shirley improvise the song ""Blue Hawaii"" and their warmth and rapport is a delight.  The prints of both films are in good condition and have that pleasant ""old film"" patina.
- ""East Side of Heaven"" and ""If I had My Way"" move away from satire to the cornball sentimentality of the later Bing.  Each has a hokey song which became a trademark for Bing but they leave me cold. The former is superior and Joan Blondell is a sprightly leading lady but completely wasted. The story is dumb, the art direction ordinary and the supporting cast variable. The latter is unbelievably corny and boring. This is the sort of film where the cast are laughing at their jokes while the audience stares in stony disbelief. Poor Gloria Jean is directed to grin all the time whatever the circumstances so you want to strangle her. Her voice is a light falsetto and hardly melds with Bing.  The prints of both films are excellent and considerably brighter than the early Paramounts.
- ""Here Come the Waves"", with a first rate print, is wartime propaganda. Betty Hutton plays twins who join the Navy and is surprisingly convincing. All the scenes with both Huttons on screen are cleverly done. Bing plays a singer in the mould of Frank Sinatra with a squealing fan base of bobby soxers. If there is one thing Bing did not have, it was sex appeal and he is too old, as usual, for the part. There are some good songs, particularly ""Accentuate the Positive"" which has Bing and Sonny Tufts, of all people, in blackface and some of the most bizarre precision dancing to be seen on celluloid. This is one musical in which the leaden plot takes up too much screen time.

The DVD has no extras, except one trailer, which is reflected in the relatively low price. Also, the inability to select scenes is a pain as you fast forward through the poor plots to reach the songs.  None of the films are classics, though ""Double or Nothing"" is a forgotten treasure but there are some entertaining songs, so if you like Crosby's voice, you'll be happy enough.",1174953600,9,2750,4.6094069529652355
2632426,5,B000HA4WRU,"Some ghastly films, but if you're a collector of Bing Crosby's films you have to take the good with the bad. ""East Side of Heaven"" is probably the best of the bunch.

I'm grateful that they are available, and the singing is great. It's the plots which don't really wear well.",1173312000,,275,4.392156862745098
2632427,5,B000HA4WRU,"Whilst not being near the best of Crosby's films, this welcome selection of rarities is great to see on DVD. Quality of transfer is high - Good light entertainment with a great selection of songs. Let's hope MCA/Universal release more of Bing's lesser known films.",1168300800,10,264,4.888888888888889
2632428,5,B000HA4WRU,This is the best set of Bing CDs that has been issued. Quality of prints is excellent and the set was not announced or expected. May more be issued.,1168300800,5,148,4.137931034482759
2632429,5,B000HA4WRU,"We have this set strictly for IF I HAD MY WAY, the 1940 musical co-starring Bing Crosby and Gloria Jean. Every version that has appeared on television and in theaters for six decades has been Universal's 1946 reissue, which is missing some Gloria Jean footage and almost all of the featured appearances by vaudeville stars.

It is a pleasure to report that Universal consulted the original 1940 release for this sparkling DVD edition. The film is fully complete with all of its original (undoctored) titles. The entire score is on parade here, including Gloria Jean's charming ""Little Grey Home in the West,"" seen and heard for the first time in 66 years. The guest-star specialties are intact: Blanche Ring and Eddie Leonard sing their signature numbers backed by Six Hits and a Miss; Paul Gordon does a trick-cycling act; Trixie Friganza, Julian Eltinge, and Grace La Rue appear as themselves.

A fine ensemble cast (El Brendel, Allyn Joslyn, Charles Winninger, Nana Bryant, Claire Dodd, Moroni Olsen, Donald Woods) lends fine support to Bing and Gloria, who sing memorably. If you like Bing Crosby, this is very enjoyable and highly representative of his talents. The restoration job is excellent, with the long-lost deletions artfully fitted back into the standard vault print. Picture and sound are also excellent. The restored IF I HAD MY WAY is a major find for movie-musical fans, and the DVD is highly recommended.",1167264000,42,1423,5.02542372881356
2632430,3,B000HA4WRU,"A better-than-average singer and a comedienne with a gift for playing knockabout face, Martha Raye supported Crosby in ""Rhythm on the Range,"" making her film debut as a rough-and-ready society girl who sets her cap for rodeo star Bob Burns... She sang ""Mr. Paganini,"" which became one of her trademark tunes of the years, and bellowed her way through the movie with enthusiasm... She had less to do in ""Waikiki Wedding,"" in which Crosby sang ""Sweet Leilani,"" the Oscar-winning tune of that year...

But in ""Double or Nothing,"" she got along better as one of a quartet of people-- Crosby, Andy Devine, and William Frawley were the others--who are caught up in a plot involving a millionaire's will... The story paused often enough to permit Crosby to sing, but Martha Raye stopped the show with a noisy and disorderly spoof of a burlesque stripper called ""It's On, It's Off."" She was not round up to help him in the last few years of the thirties, when his films lacked the lively spirit and sense of his earlier musicals...",1167091200,3,1023,4.747191011235955
