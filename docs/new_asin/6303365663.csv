641993,4,6303365663,"I'd have given this movie 5 stars, but it falls a little short in the quality of animation, but in execution only.  And by all means avoid the dubbed version like it'll blow up your DVD/VCR player.  It's horrible!  The voices are bizarre, they don't follow the bio's of the characters.  For example, in the comic books the character Briareos is a 'Mediteranian Black' with a full cyborg body after he's severly injured in a accident with a land mine.  But, in the dubbed version of the movie he sounds like a cab driver from Brooklyn!  Besides that, the story is truncated and subtly altered into confusion.  I guess when the movie first came out, it was thought that the US market wouldn't understand the story in the original context, so they changed the translation to make it simpler.  If you were to watch the movies back to back the stories would appear very different.
I've been a huge fan of Masamune Shirow since the first issue of the 'Appleseed' comic book.  This movie does hit the high points of the general themes in the comic books, but doesn't really follow any one story found in the comic books or graphic novels.  It's kind of like David Lynche's version of 'Dune', it's one way of telling part of a much larger deeper story that's found only in the print version.  To really enjoy and understand just what's going on in the world of Appleseed you've got to read the comic books and graphic novels.  Shirow is really on to something in his views of human cloning, cybernetic technology, and the politics of the future.  In short, the movie's cool, but the graphic novels and comic books are much better.",987120000,,1622,4.570934256055363
641994,3,6303365663,"Appleseed appealed to me with its simple escapist charm, but the storyline falls pathetically short of any resolution, and whatever moral questions it's asking are quickly buried under the frenetic action, never to resurface.
In a nutshell, the plot involves an anti-cyborg terrorist faction and a duo of policemen who are out to stop them. Oh, and there's something about a renegade cop, and a giant wasteland, and an AI system that seems to control everything...
There isn't much gore or nudity to speak of, and the art is low on detail. Yes, it's mildly entertaining, the robotic infantry suits are fun for a while, and there's an explosion of gunfire every few minutes, but there's hardly anything here to engage the viewer long-term.",982972800,,738,4.959677419354839
641995,4,6303365663,"The animation was superb and the characters were likeable.  The plot  wasn't well defined but I can over look that due how beautiful the movie  was.  If you like Mecha and anime, you'll enjoy this movie.  If you don't  know what mecha and anime are, you'll be left a bit cold.

641996,2,6303365663,"Shirow, Shirow, Shirow what were you thinking!  Allowing Appleseed one of the greatest cyber punk story lines of all time becomeing a 50 min Anime! Not only that but the main story line is taken mostly from the second book  in the manga series, published by Dark Horse. The voices are absolutly  annoying and the animation is average. If you want to get the true value  out of your money pass on this and get the manga by Masamune Shirow, author  of Ghost in the Shell.",960940800,,469,4.406976744186046
641997,3,6303365663,"I'll confess that I am a Shirow fan and I've enjoyed reading Appleseed. I was looking forward to the anime, but I was a bit disappointed by it. This anime is based on Appleseed: Book 2, but to condense that lengthy volume  into a one hour movie, some sacrifices had to be made.
One of the major  things which suffered in the conversion was the characterization. The same  familiar characters of Deunan, Briarios, and Hitomi are still there, but  they are very watered-down when compared to the rich characters they were  in the manga. They have very little character depth or personality in the  anime.
The entire storyline is also somewhat different. While the overall  plot is the same, the complexities are toned-down. It essentially follows a  typical ""police versus terrorist"" storyline, with a little  political intrigue from the manga thrown in. For those who find Shirow's  works confusing, then this may be a blessing, but for those who enjoy the  rich depth of his stories, then this will be a bitter disappointment.
The  animation is of pretty average quality. The characters look the same as the  manga, but it's generally not too flashy. While I haven't seen the dubbed  version, I heard that excessive swearing was added in. The subtitled  version has almost no profanity in it.
Appleseed does have some  entertainment value. If you've never read the manga before then you'll  probably get some enjoyment out of this. Fans of the manga should probably  give it a pass, though.",959212800,11,1490,4.868525896414343
641998,2,6303365663,"I've seen both the English dub' version and the Japanese language/English sub-title version. The sub-titled version is orders-of-magnitude better. Whoever did the English dub' for Appleseed didn't just translate, but tried  to localize it, swapping the original dialog for phrases and text that  would sound ""more american"". The result is almost two different  movies. If you have a choice, ONLY get the Japanese language version.",957139200,,430,5.584615384615384
642059,5,6303365663,"Although this was made back in the late 80's this is still a classic, after WW3
human civilization has crawled back into the age of peace and prosperity, Bioroids now populate the city of Olympus along with normal humans until a group of terrorist decides to disrupt that peace by stealing a top secret military hardware called the ""Multipeade Cannon."" it's up to the hot and tough Nat Dunan and her Cyborg sidekick to stop the ring leader ""J.K. Sebastian and the Handsome seductive

I'm sure there are great reviews elsewhere online but if ;you love classic cyber-punk/mecha anime, this is your ticket.
The English dub is the only version I've ever watched and it rocks. I wish Manga Entertainment was still releasing titles as strong as it used to...(sigh)

Great story (I won't give it away but it deals with fighting terrorism), great animation, likeable characters, Masamune Shirow does not fail. Grab it.",1329091200,2,509,4.988235294117647
642061,4,6303365663,"When I first watched this OVA, it was just after finishing the Manga of the first Takuban and I was disgusted with how the Anime company changed so much of the tale. As the decades trudged on, I grew to a small liking of this tale and the animation within.

Honestly, you just don't see this type of Anime anymore. It did well within the budget it had and the intense Lack of moe girls was uplifting for myself. This and 'Black Magic M-66' rounds out the best of Shirow Masamune's work adapted by someone else.. though Shirow actual drew & wrote the story boardings for '~M-66'

ADDED 8/8/12
I got a notice that someone was influenced by this review and I thought I'd also mention if anyone was interested in this show, they should also buy 'Black Magic M-66' too. As written above, the '80s was a time of great experiments not seen since. The passion felt in every Hand Drawn cell is palpable. Back in the day~",1270598400,3,911,4.384615384615385
642062,3,6303365663,"If you want to see what you are really getting in this DVD, go look at the version under product number 660200407926 here on Amazon. That version will also give you content based reviews, which this is not.

This is to warn you that this is not ""Widescreen Presentation,"" despite what it says on the box, which Amazon has copied to their description. Manga Video has merely taken the old, full screen version and stuck it in a cardboard wrapper claiming it is widescreen and hiding the fact that it is the other product. Go ahead: compare the ISBN numbers on the wrapper and the DVD inside. The wrapper is the ISBN for the product here on this page. The ISBN on the DVD inside is the full screen version referred to above.

I have this on my widescreen TV right now. The only way to get it into a so-called widescreen is to either zoom the picture (thus cutting off the top and bottom, and degrading the detail) or set it to show the picture full screen, which gives everything wrong proportions, making people in particular look squat and wide. So, get ready to enjoy those gigantic black bars on the right and left of the picture if you want to view it in proper aspect ratio.

I have had the same problem with other Manga Video releases that have been put out in these ""new"" silver cardboard wrapped editions, such as Perfect Blue.",1266969600,10,1334,4.436734693877551
642063,2,6303365663,"This OVA is loosely based on the Appleseed manga series.  While the OVA and the manga share the same characters and setting, the storyline for the OVA deviates from the story told in the manga.

The OVA runs for a little over an hour, and I think this short runtime is to the production's detriment.  When I watched the DVD, I felt the storytelling was rather choppy.  The only reason I was able to follow what was going on was the fact that I had seen Shinji Aramaki's 2004 film version of Appleseed.  If it hadn't been for that, I would have been rather lost as to what was going on.  Personally, I think this OVA version of Appleseed would have been stronger if there was a longer runtime, and that a significant portion of the expanded runtime was spent giving a little more background on the characters.  Deunan and Briareos are so undeveloped as characters in the OVA, that it's hard to really care about them.  And considering that they are supposed to be the heroes of the story, this isn't a good thing.

The animation isn't too bad in the Appleseed OVA.  While it's nothing groundbreaking, it's still a good example of the typical style of animation being used in Japan during the late 1980's.  However, I wish a stronger script was used for this production.

The extras were rather unimpressive on this DVD release.  The character bios are two page write-ups for the characters that include a picture.  This was probably the best extra on the disc, but Calon was not included.  Considering he's a major part of the story, I thought this was a major oversight.

The ""Japanese production credits"" are a credit roll that includes the Japanese voice actors.  Considering this is already included at the end of the OVA, this seemed like a waste of an extra.  The remaining extras were all advertisements for Manga Entertainment (Manga Video Previews, Merchandise & Catalogue, and Manga DVD Catalogue).  There are also Palm Pictures DVD previews and weblinks for Manga Entertainment, Palm Pictures, and Sputnik 7.

Personally, I prefer the 2004 film version of Appleseed over this OVA production.  However, if you are a fan of the Appleseed OVA, you need to acquire this release, since it is the only way to own the production on DVD.",1242691200,,2239,4.68974358974359
642064,3,6303365663,"While the animation is not as awesome as the two 3D cell shaded movies, the story is pretty decent. Worth a look if you enjoyed the two 3D flicks and want more in the same universe.",1227657600,2,181,4.055555555555555
642065,2,6303365663,"Coming from a hardcore Masamune Shirow fan, if you want to know about Appleseed, either read the mangas, or see the two excellent CGI films.  This OVA from the early 80s is total cheese, taking none of the futuristic drama into account, and going for cheap laughs.  It might fit the Tank Police series, but not here.  Trust me, don't waste your money when this series has been reimagined into some of the finest computer animated features to ever come out of Japan.",1207440000,,465,4.578313253012048
642066,3,6303365663,"This is the original cell anim and should in no way be confused with the glorious 3D CGI creation of the same name. The animation is shoddy and doesn't compare well with many of its contemporaries, Akira this is not.

Plot, xenophobic terrorist and sappy police traitor plot to destroy Olympus ( Spelt incorrectly in the signposts.) The defence is lead by Deunan a female SWAT cop and her Cyborg sidekick Brearios, who looks more like a robotic rabbit than the formidable man-machine he's supposed to be. Much shooting and running around in circles ensues until right prevails, Hurrah !

If you've seen the latest Appleseed CGI masterpiece and are considering watching this one, don't. It's simply not in the same league and the character relationships, such as they are, are nonsensical when compared with the more recent version. It's almost guaranteed to disappoint.",1149465600,7,869,5.027777777777778
642067,5,6303365663,"Appleseed is based on the manga - Mankind is trying to make a perfect utopia in the city of Olympus.  But is it perfect or just another form of a cage, monitored and controlled by a computer named Gaia.  Forces within the city are trying to restore their freedoms.  Or are they just trying to bring paradise down to hell?

It is up to Dunan Nats and Buliarous Hekatonecles, with the rest of their fellow officers in the ESWAT Squad, to keep order without breaking the laws themselves.

The voice actors don't seem to appear in anything else, the plot is simple, the themes watered down, English is mis-spelled -Red ALART???-, the music is late 80s (DUH - the anime was MADE in the late 80s) and the F-word is used by everybody.  All in just over an hour.

IT is SO PERFECT.  Come on, this is the stuff we all watched at one time or another.  Terrorists, mecha, explosions.  A must for any fan of anime or Masamune Shirow.",1104192000,6,921,4.364705882352941
642068,5,6303365663,"This movie is quite the shocker for anyone who's never seen, heard, or read about this anime/manga. First time I saw this was when I was 12 taping it on my VCR infront of my parents and the first real thing they say in the movie is ""Mother F***** come out with your F******* hands up you piece of S****....."" So you can imagine how I was as shocked as they were except in a good way. This movie at times doesn't make much sense, but it's still good with all the action, swearing, emotion, realism, oh yeah did I mention the swearing. This movie is without a doubt worth getting. Parents can get it for there kids if they want. I mean it contains like no nudity as far as I can remember, and besides your kids are going to be introduced to swearing anyway. So why not teach them how to do it properly and when to do it with this as their guide. I hope this review was helpful.",1099440000,6,875,4.093023255813954
642099,3,6303365663,"The original Appleseed, is based on the Masamune Shirow manga, the same writer/artist responsible for Ghost in the Shell's source material. Appleseed takes place in a city that is run completely by robots in a post-apocalyptic universe. The main characters are police officers who are tracking down a terrorist plotting to liberate the city from robot control. I got the sense that they tried to cram too much of the comic into the anime just for fans. Characters are not fleshed out well, one main character seems to be lesbian, but only through some subtle signs, and much about the world goes unexplained. Still, the plot is entertaining, and has some interesting twists. The animation is dated, which is fine, given its vintage, but what bothered me the most was the lack of imaginative environments. A future where robots take care of everything should be alive and automated. It just seemed like everything took place in the present day, but with a few cyborgs and mecha running around. What gives? Appleseed is worth at least a rental, and I can't wait to see what the new gorgeous CG movie does with the same elements.",1091318400,3,1126,4.809278350515464

642101,5,6303365663,"I bought Appleseed today at some comic book store because they didn't have anything else I was interested in.  I wasn't expecting much, but this 68 minute anime is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  They swear like there's no tomorrow and say degrading things about themselves that I don't think I can repeat here.  I've spotted at least five typos (mostly on signs) throughout the movie.  ROFLMAO!  The animation is fine, but it's irrelevant.  Buy Appleseed without hesitation. It's a riot.  :) :)",1068163200,4,507,4.825581395348837

The video is interesting, but might dissapoint.  The story is well done, but lacking the details and beautiful art of the comics.  It is not as good as his other stories on video (M-66 Black Magic, about escaped battle droids that need to be recaptured) and Ghost in the Shell (about intelligence in the robot and computer systems and what is a soul, anyways?) ...

Also you should be made aware that there is an abundant almost unending supply of adult language in this movie.
I won't go into the story too much because that's half the fun. I will say that this anime has some of my favorite anime action scenes in it and I fall in love with it every time I put it in the DVD player. I rank it up there with Akira, Ghost in the shell, Iria and Robotech...

Third, get subtitled, The dubbed is a sacrilege to the entire movie which isn't a very long running film to begin with. The dub degrades the entire flow of the film. It's terrible acting with misplaced words. The F word(not fornicate but the other one) is said mindlessly throughout the entire pic. The plot really was a bad one. I hoped it would develope more but it didn't.
Good side is that i was in the hospital at the time. I had my appendix removed and my brother came in and handed me some movies. It helped pass the time away. That was the dubbed.

642108,3,6303365663,"Based on the slick Masamune Shirow manga series, I had big hopes for this one. Did it live up to them? I would say yes - and no.
A story about humans trapped in the perfect city, and how when life is easy to live, it's almost pointless. Sadly, the plot is bogged down by bad directing and a lack of imagery. We have two ""villains"" and neither ever make the audience feel threatened. Unlike in the mangas, Dedune and Bariarieos are pretty clean cut (read: uninteresting) characters, a far cry from the mean, violent, and profesional SWAT officers they where in the mangas. The plot is roughly based on the second manga, but so roughly that fans will find a new, and fairly interesting, story. The characters will just get in the way...
The animation is pretty bad, but the flat colors and sad, sad art hurt this anime the most. It's very two dimensional and uncreative.
The dub is poor, Bariarieos's totally incorrect voice being the worst part. The character designs are terrible, and it's too bad that the animators didn't mimic Shirow's style better. It looks more like the ""Gall Force"" designs, without any of the charm or the great hair, than they look like Shirow's stuff. The villainous villain (not to be mistaken with the villain we are expected to pity ^_~) has a place on my ""Top 10 Ugliest anime characters list"", especially when he's in his landmate. A word on the landmates, they are THE ugliest mechas, ever. Why did the animation team not use Shirow's designs? Beats me, because these landmates, which look like something out of ""Inspector Gadget"" or ""Duck Tails"", are awful. Asuska Langly would kill herself before she set foot in one of these ^_~.
Overall, though I was harsh on this anime in the review, it's not the worst Sci-Fi anime I have seen, by far, and this makes a fine rent for fans of the mangas. Because the plot is still advanced in nature, this can be an enjoyable experience. Buy? Well, I don't know... you better not look for beautiful animation and art as a standard in your anime, for one, and you should make sure copies of ""Ghost in the Shell"" ""Battle Angel"" and ""Armitage III Polymatrix"" are on your shelf already, second.
