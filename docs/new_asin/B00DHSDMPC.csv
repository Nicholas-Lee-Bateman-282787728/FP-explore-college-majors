5813774,5,B00DHSDMPC,I got up at 5:00 AM with my mother to watch it.  We loved it and i gave this to my mother for Christmas this year. We are real anglophiles.  We watched it again together the day after Christmas.,1389484800,,194,3.948717948717949
5813775,5,B00DHSDMPC,You have to be a loyal fan of the Royals.  I have been since before Diana met Charles.  How fortunate I have lived to see Diana's son married and have a little boy to call his own.  How proud his Mother's soul must be!  I know Charles is proud as well.  I'm so proud of how Diana changed the ways of the Royals and how Charles and the boys have followed her wishes.,1386115200,,365,3.9452054794520546
5813776,4,B00DHSDMPC,"This is an enjoyable DVD for those interested in the British royals.  Watching historical film clips of old Queen Mary, always glittering in diamonds and/or mummy wrapped in pearls, always brings a smile to my face.",1381536000,,215,4.972222222222222
5813777,5,B00DHSDMPC,I love this video and have looked at it more than once and loaned it out.  I look forward to the next vide about Kate and William.,1378684800,2,130,3.814814814814815
5813778,5,B00DHSDMPC,"My mother is a great fan of British royalty and I admit I inherited a little of her fascination for all things British royalty. It was a happy day reading that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, i.e. William and Kate had become new parents to  bouncing baby boy, Prince George. This DVD does not focus on the new royal baby, but instead takes a look at the world into which royal children past and present have been brought up in, with lots of archival footage that should delight fans of British royalty.

""In 1948, Prince Charles was born in a Buckingham Palace bathroom which had been converted into a royal operating theater."" Now that is a peppy little anecdote for you! Interviews with royal watchers such as royal biographer Ingrid Seward reveals how Charles' imminent arrival was an anxious time for Prince Philip, husband of then Princess Elizabeth, who would in a few years, ascend the throne of England and become Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Archival footage shows the infant Charles surrounded by his eight sponsors, including his uncle Edward, who had infamously abdicated the throne of England for love of Wallis Simpson.

The press is portrayed as being respectful and mindful of the Royals' need for privacy back when Charles and his siblings were being raised, but the documentary also shows how things have drastically changed since then, especially since the birth of Prince William, followed by Harry. The show makes a point of connecting this to the pressures that William and Catherine (Kate Middleton) will face as they raise Prince George. The glare of publicity is a given, and the question is, how will they manage this while giving George a semblance of a 'normal' upbringing?

The documentary then moves on to analyzing a succession of British monarchs such as George V, and how these monarchs approached parenting, mainly traditional. Imagine being a royal infant or toddler and only being presented to one's parents, i.e. the King and Queen, for about an hour each day, while at tea! This distant parenting style impacted the personalities of royal children, and was especially significant in the case of Bertie (George VI) who had always been overshadowed by his older, more glamorous and confident brother Edward. When Bertie married Elizabeth and the pair became parents, they balked at the traditional parenting style favored by their parents and instead became more engaged parents to Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. But even then, the young Princesses were often accompanied by a succession of nannies and governesses, and young Elizabeth did not really have any real playmates except for her sister Margaret.

I found the insights on royal child-rearing to be interesting and helpful in discerning the personalities of many members of the British royal family. It is obvious that the parenting of royal children has undergone many changes, from a more distant and traditional upbringing to more modern approaches as practiced by the late Princess of Wales, Diana. Now with Prince William and Princess Catherine as new royal parents, it will be interesting to see the way they approach parenting, and how this impacts the royal family and how it is perceived among the public. From what I've read so far, it appears they favor the hands-on method and look as though they will be highly engaged and involved parents.

The DVD runs 75 minutes, in color and B&W (when featuring archival footage), with the option of English subtitles, and is Region 1. DVD courtesy of BBC America.",1378080000,6,3520,4.998293515358362
5813779,3,B00DHSDMPC,"If you follow the Royal family you are likely to enjoy this DVD. This DVD release was timed with the birth of the new British Prince but it is not about Prince George. The DVD looks back on childhoods of various royal children King George VI, Elizabeth, Margaret, Charles, Anne, William, Harry as well as Kate Middleton. You can see what changed in how the children are brought up in the Royal family. The DVD includes archival footage as well as as recent documentary material. This DVD contains no surprises but it is well made. It is 75 minutes long.

I received a copy of this DVD for review from BBC America.

5813785,2,B00DHSDMPC,"I was expecting more from the documentary than the usual recycled stuff. I especially hoped they would go more in depth on the psychological level--they touched the surface of all the events from the the royal wedding of Diana until the present, and very little about William and Kate and this new baby George. I think it came across almost like a little PR for the Royal Family and a photo op to advertise how great they are. I'd like to hear a little more about some of the stresses and tensions of ""being royal."" The best point made was that Diana really cracked the ceiling and introduced the family to modern child rearing and open, feeling-oriented social service and relations. She was ground breaking for that family and not enough credit has given to her for that. Unfortunately, her sons seem much more traditional and a bit scared to break out of the mold. They've been brain washed. I think her death was tragic but I wonder what sort of humiliation and shaming she would have had to endure had she lived on. That family is somewhat fascist in it's insistence upon protocol, ritual and so-called rational behavior. They really don't leave much room for anything new, but Diana was courageous and broke through all of that. This was hinted at, but most of the interviews were with people who are both fans and employees of the family or former employees and the family has a firm hand on people's reputations. Everyone seemed scared to speak out except in the official party-line announcements. In that sense the Windsors are a kind of Royal Mafia. Kate is NOTHING like Diana although they made comparisons. She is traditional and very conservative and hasn't the beauty or charisma that Diana had. William has played it safe. Such is life.",1409270400,,1751,4.706840390879479
