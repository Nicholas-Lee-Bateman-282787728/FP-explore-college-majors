3437833,1,B0019HSQ68,"I purchased this so called Blu-Ray disc twice but both discs
were immediately rejected by my Panasonic BD-55
Blu-Ray player. There was something very wrong with a company releasing
titles that were authored incorrectly like this. I had to return
the defective products at my own expense to get a refund back.",1233100800,3,308,4.9423076923076925
3437834,1,B0019HSQ68,"Purchased this Bluray twice and both times it failed to play--very, very disappointing.  There is something very wrong with this particular production.  Purchased the Rachmaninov and it played great.  Be careful about this particular Bluray.  I complained about it, but, of course, no one bothered to heed and I am sure there are others out there. Beware!!",1229904000,5,356,5.192982456140351
3437835,1,B0019HSQ68,"Yes this so-called ""blu-ray"" is all weired from the ground up just because it's totally a GOD-DAMN D9 DVD! I don't know whether you guys have tried to put that thing in your DVD-ROM and used PowerDVD or something else to see whether it could be played! IT JUST COULD!!! And you can even learn thers's a capcity of 5GB data on that disc with your Windows Explorer. What's more, just notice the label on the inner circle of the data side, it reads: ""TCHAIKOVSKY L1 F1 DVD"". Just be aware: A 7.1 DTS-HD MA track DOES NOT imply a blu-ray disc, and now all we got is a D9 IN A BLU-RAY CASE AND ITS PRICE!!!",1226016000,6,601,4.145299145299146
3437836,1,B0019HSQ68,"I tried in three different Blu ray players: this disk doesn't work. and I open the box, I mean I bougt it NEW.
Why? Why companies throw they products without previous testing? Why I have to pay for one man's  hungry to achieve ""top performance"" in his dirty job? I'm just a buyer who wants to enjoy the music. And pay for this and I don't get a single sound, it's simple; it's just anfair...
Enjoy the prize to achieve your goals, sales manager, don't you forget the bill's coming sooner or later.",1225929600,3,497,4.344086021505376
3437837,3,B0019HSQ68,"This is an excellent recording. The music audio quality is excellent. The Blu-ray disk is audio only (as the title says). This Blu-ray disk does have a strange problem, it will not play through without loosing audio output (somewhere in Chapter 5). If you restart chapter 5 playing, all is fine. Maybe it is just this disk???",1219363200,6,325,4.719298245614035

8274106,2,B0019HSQ68,"Unfortunately, I didn't cared reading other reviews before buying this, I don't know why amazon let this kind of things be sold in here. The disc is a BD-R printable, the cover is printed with an inkjet printer, the box is a generic box of very poor quality. It costs like an original but it's a copy.",1330041600,,301,4.298245614035087
8274107,1,B0019HSQ68,"I am very upset for this product.
This is not a real Blu Ray disc but a Blu Ray recorded (something like a CD-R).
I have a Sony PS3 and a beautiful Denon DVD-A1UD hi-end player but this disc disc do not works (both the players are updated at the last firmaware).
It is a SHAME that Amazon sell an ""home made"" blu ray that is absolutely different in comparison of industrial quality products.
I am sendin back this fake disc.
PS: The cover and the label disc are printed with a copier and PC printer!!!!",1299801600,2,502,4.239583333333333
8274108,1,B0019HSQ68,"I bought several blue ray 7.1 channel classical music titles from Amazon in 2009-2010, none of them live up to my expection. They simply do not play all the way through and for the part that they play, the audio is well below my expection. Those purchases were a waste of money for me and may be the technology or the available recording is not yet ready? (IMHO).",1293321600,,363,4.352941176470588
8274109,1,B0019HSQ68,Alert!!!!!!!!!!!  This video was completely blank.  You are buing a very expensive CD.  Do not buy it is a rip off!,1286928000,,115,4.380952380952381
8274110,1,B0019HSQ68,"I have five other Surround Record 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio that play just fine, although one will play on a Panasonic BD30 and not on a Panasonic BD60, both with current firmware updates.  The Tchaikovsky recording does not play on either Panasonic BR player.  One other one, the Bach had three noticeable defects on the recording that were not the result of a scratch, but actually encoded in two of the recordings that I had to return.  Another one, the Mussorgsky was another recording that would not play at all on either Panasonic BR player.  I suppose that I should keep my fingers crossed because I have never had a BR DVD film that did not play, so that is aggravating to run into problems that have to do with an all audio recording.  e-mails to Surround Records have been unanswered.  So, some work and some don't.  When a Surround recording runs, it is fantastic, when it doesn't, it is highly disappointing.",1262822400,2,918,4.62962962962963
8274111,3,B0019HSQ68,"Technically this is not a Blu-ray Disc but a dual-layer DVD which uses the AVCHD and DTS-HD Master Audio codecs in order to play in a Blu-ray Disc Player.  And play it does, within reason.  Using 3 current high-end Blu-ray players (LG BD390, Samsung BD-P2500 and Panasonic DMP-BD80), all with the latest firmware applied, the results are mixed.  On 2 of the 3 players, set to ""bitstream"" mode, I was eventually able to pass a DTS-HD Master Audio stream to a compatible preamp/processor via HDMI for playback of the audio track. (BTW, there *IS* no video track here -- it's an audio-only Blu-ray Disc).  When working properly, the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 channel 24-bit 96Khz track here sounds phenomenal and the performance is clean and enjoyable.  Those with compatible gear are in for a treat.  But if you want your player to be able to do the decoding, this is where the trouble begins.

On the Panasonic BD80 (firmware 2.2), set to PCM mode (internal decoding), the sampling rate drops down to 48 Khz - still good quality but not the 96 KHz as advertised.  On the Samsung BD-P2500, any attempts to decode the track internally fail with a nasty crackling sound.  On the LG BD390, I was unable to get sound from this disc in any mode: bitstream, PCM stereo, DTS re-encode and multi-channel PCM modes all failed to pass a valid stream to my preamp/processor for decoding.

This is one of only a couple of recordings available which use full 7.1-channel 24-bit 96 KHz DTS-HD Master Audio sound, and perhaps for good reason, because decoding it internally seems to be a task beyond the capabilities of most current players, even those that are supposed to support internal decoding of DTS-HD MA and which do behave properly with other DTS-HD titles.

Unless you can confirm that your specific player and receiver or processor will work with this title in advance then it may not be worth a purchase.",1260403200,9,1898,4.738601823708207
8274112,1,B0019HSQ68,"I bought three of this company's Blu-rays ... save your money and get the CD. Better yet, get an SACD version for real high-quality sound. I have ""Tchaikovsky Piano Concertos Nos. 1 & 3,"" ""Bach Orchestral Suites No. 1, 2 & 3,"" and ""Vivaldi Four Seasons"" in these discs. None will play in my Samsung Blu-ray player with the latest firmware. All play in my Panasonic. The sound quality is no better than standard quality 5.1 surround; in fact, I suspect they just copied the material from a standard 5.1 version. There's very little sound in the rear channels and virtually no separation. Sounds like stereo. Save your money, these are a rip-off.",1238025600,,644,4.707964601769912
8274113,3,B0019HSQ68,"So far, not what I had hoped for. I might need to give it a couple more listens for it to grow on me.",1234915200,,101,3.25
8274114,5,B0019HSQ68,"I wanted a good piano recording to experience with my  blu-ray player and new sound system and after a lot of web searching and reading reviews, I decided on this  recording. The new 7.1 DTS-HD sound is a magnificent upgrade from stereo and even 5.1, with much greater presence and definition in the sound field. Linked together with the magnificent artistry of the soloist and his accompanists, this should remains among the the most treasurable piano recordings  -- and now one of the best sounding recordings available -- of the Tchaikovsky.",1233878400,,544,4.956043956043956
