3902798,3,B002C2KATK,"I collect raunchy adult comedies mostly for the laughs or the T & A, so I took a chance on this one because it was cheap. There were a couple of decent comedic moments, but this is a great movie to own for the nude scenes alone. If you are looking for a film that has a lot more nude women than laughs, then this is for you.",1407974400,,324,3.7794117647058822

When they hear the sirens of a police car they chuck their sure thing out the window.  The hilarity ensues as they attempt to find their lost herb and make it to a party where they can score.",1354838400,,325,4.142857142857143
3902801,4,B002C2KATK,"How much you enjoy this 3D sex farce will depend on your tolerance for truly crude humor.  This is a really nasty little film with tons of nudity and gross situations.  Sometimes it is funny, sometimes it is stupid but it is almost always entertaining.  The film was shot using an anaglyphic 3D camera (the same type of process used for NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD 3D) and it has some scenes that really look exceptional.  I'm not sure why the film is made in 3D other than to have an additional gimmick to sell it.  Nothing really flys of the screen at you except breasts but I suppose that is okay.  Don't expect it to look like AVATAR.  This is a good time and if you like really offensive dumb comedy then you are certain to find a lot to enjoy with this silly little movie.  It never even rises to the level of an AMERICAN PIE sequel but it isn't entirely awful either.  Check it out if you like this sort of thing.",1263513600,7,917,4.194285714285714
3902802,2,B002C2KATK,"This disk has both a 2D version and a '3D' version of this 'film'.  In 2D, this is a really bad movie.  As for the 3D, only about 1/2 of the film is actually presented in 3D.  It alternates between that and some simulated 2D mess that gives no 3D effect whatsoever.  The puzzling thing is whether it was the fault of the filmmakers or poor authoring of the DVD the resulted in the horrible pseudo-3D portions.  It appears to be a filmmaker problem, as the 2D and 3D comes and goes a key plot points (if there is such a thing as a key plot point in a movie like this!).  Basically a poor man's American Pie, this time with watermelon instead of an apple pie.",1254096000,,657,4.133858267716535

This film is a Mockbuster/or at least a riff on all those National Lampoon movies and generic teen comedies with Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill.
The dope,drugs and marijuana stuff is a amusing,If only as a DIY weekend project for misbegotten teens.
Some of the situations aren't that funny,Bro/Sis mistake and Strawberry's extra quality.
Michelle was awesome female lead and has quite a future( See interview elsewhere).
The others mentioned above stole their moments with great ease,Christine is a SOV legend and very funny and Victoria has a huge list of credits in all genres,Elina redefines MILF !
Some things on road seem out of Scooby Doo mysteries in a SUV .",1252108800,,780,5.054263565891473

3902805,2,B002C2KATK,"For the ages of 18-19 who might need to feel better about how bad their stoner, sexless life is turning out. I once again took the risk of ordering another stoner comedy, especially one with a budget this big as they filmed it in 3D. Someone has to do it right?

Anyway, we have a film about two undersexed teen boys left alone for the weekend to smoke dope and have rancid masturbation hallucinations - a lot of them. Upon finding some leftover sexual dope, they decide to partake in a wild party filled with naked women - a lot of them. As the party progresses our two leads find beautiful women who help them lose their virginity. And that covers it. Along the way we are subjected to some of the most disgusting visuals I have seen in a sex farce (not going to bother listing them as the review will never get published).

The supplements include a few minutes of bloopers (funnier than the movie) and a 10 minute making-of. That docu actually covers a legitimate back story about how the director made this 3D ""sexy stoner movie"". All of the skin girls interviewed were hilarious talking about how artistic and amazing this concept is, that made me laugh more than the movie also. The film quality looks good and the sound is a mixed bag (available in both 5.1 and 2.0). Essentially a soft core stoned teen dream film with no saving grace other than some of those scenes would look pretty good in 3D, gross - but good. I added a pic of the cover art but not sure if it will get published. 1 for the film, 1 for the extras and film quality. Enjoy.",1251504000,,1551,4.344827586206897

8362878,2,B002C2KATK,"I guess if you can't get enough of unfunny idiotic teen sex comedies, this is your film. Virgin Spanky (Rollin Perry) visits suspect virgin college buddy Mert (Seth Cassell). They drink, get stoned, peek at girls, look at porn and try to get laid. About an hour into the film the ""sex pot"" aspect comes in as we endure massive amounts of unfunny lines, juvenile humor, foul mouthed kids, an incest scene, and mountains of flesh...okay the last part wasn't too bad. Unfortunately the rest of the feature was a bust too.

I would assume fans of the film don't need a review to watch it.

F-bomb, sex, massive amounts of nudity (Rana Davis, Lindsey Ahern, Rebecca Blue, Michelle Penick, Maura Murphy Orit, Christine Nguyen, Teryl Brouillette, Giusy Castiglione, , Sarah Bennett, Jasna Novosel, Sarah Agor)
