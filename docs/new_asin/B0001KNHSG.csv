8013656,3,B0001KNHSG,"This series is a Tenchi series in name only. The series should be called Seina Yamada GXP. Seina is a boy that is knida lame. His family enrolls him in the galaxy police academy. This show is about the crazy life he has at the academy. He is yet another wimpy boy that gets the attention of some major babes. He is not a very compelling character though. He tries hard, but all the powers that be are out to get him. I like the female characters in this series, and there are some pretty funny situations, but this series falls way short of greatness. There are few old characters that get a little time. Mainly Mihoshi, who cleans the toilets and hallways at the academy.

This volume finds Seina working hard at the academy. He finally undergoes the body enhancement and gets his personal training from Amane. He also gets the honor of living with her at her mansion. There are some that find that unacceptable. This DVD is very funny, but that's it. There's not a solid plot, character backgrounds or drama. That doesn't have to be a bad thing though. This part is really funny.

If you are a completest and won't be satisfied unless you own all the Tenchi entries, then go on and buy this show. If you are interested in this series b/c you expect more Tenchi and his harem, then you aren't missing anything. Personally I don't think this series good or bad. It's not memorable, and has already been forgotten by most.",1353024000,,1421,4.461538461538462
8013657,4,B0001KNHSG,"Seina Yamada finds himself in trouble when he can't keep up with the training.  He could fail P.E. unless he gets his body enhanced!  And when he does, things REALLY become tricky.  You see, the enhancement makes you stronger, faster and tougher - it changes you completely.  That explains why Mihoshi from the OVA can survive crashing her spaceships all the time.  But the changes force you to learn how to do everything all over again - walking, running, standing up, cleaning, everything!
So Amane decides to help him by having him come live with her.  It seems simple - he will do daily chores and learn how to control his body again.  But things are not what they seem - Amane's roommates are Kiriko and Erma.  It seems everybody wants to be with him while at the same time they don't really trust each other.  Seiryo is less than happy, but who cares what he thinks?
In the last episode Amane's parents even show up and we learn why she joined the GP.  The screwed up, out of control, NB robot adds some to the humor (but not much).  Think Benny Hill want-to-be.
I gave it a four, because while it was funny and interesting, and I got to see ""Washu's Pore"", it only had three episodes, 75 minutes, while the first DVD had FIVE episodes.  The same extras also.  So, buy this USED and only if you are ALREADY a fan of the anime.",1087776000,,1332,4.365853658536586
8013658,5,B0001KNHSG,"Although this story is excelent in and of itself, it is HIGHLY encouraged that those who have GXP get themselves the Tenchi Muyo OVA series.  (Currently spanning thirteen episodes and promises to continue in the not too distant future.)  Fans of the original Tenchi muyo will get the most out of this with all their insight and knowledge behind some seemingly unnoticed comment or fact. (Those who know OVA episode thirteen know Seryio.  JUSTICE! MUAHAHAHA!)  The BGM is excelent in my oppinion (My personal favorite being the Mikagami's appearance from the first DVD... ) and for the most part keeps up with the story.  Animation is spectacular, looking to be a combination of older style animation for most scenes, and '3D' modeling for the ships and other objects of that nature. (I don't doubt both are done VIA computer now.) English voice acting talent fits the characters quite well, and is done superbly. Characterizations feel like they actually belong to that character for REAL.  I still suggest you watch it in japanese and subtittled, as to match the lip-flapping, they had to edit dialogue.  I personally can't wait until the rest of this is released.  (Especially the episode which cameos the original Tenchi cast... whichever one that was...)  This is WORTH the buy if you're a Tenchi fan.  If you're unfamilliar...  Get the Tenchi Muyo OVA first.",1086480000,,1363,4.960352422907489
8013659,5,B0001KNHSG,The second disk of Tenchi Muyo GXP is very funny its all about laughs in this one and not very much plot. Amane though is a little perverted though. You have to look that over though. One of the funniest things in this disk is the MB unit. It smokes which is really funny. The show is a must have for any Tenchi fan. The dubbing is just as good as the first one and the animation is still great. The only problem I have is the extras except for some new trailers it is the exact same as before. Overall the disk is good very funny.,1084838400,,531,3.97196261682243
8013660,3,B0001KNHSG,"This DVD covers the events immediately following Seina Yamada's entry into the Galaxy Police Academy.  Hopelessly physically outclassed by his classmantes and remorselessly tormented by his PE teacher, he undergoes a nanomachine body enhancement that increases his strength and life span.  He is forced to move into the house of the woman detective who recruited him (Amane) while he learns to control his new strength and abilities, and two other female teachers move in to help.  His friends and classmates become envious of him, and racy rumors start to fly.  His new housemates begin to tease, flirt, compete, and become ridiculously jealous of each other.  This is complicated by the bufoonish PE teacher's crush on Amane and his hatred of Seina.
Compared to the first DVD in the series, the second is somewhat of a disappointment.  First, there are only 3 episodes where the first DVD had 5.  The quality of the artwork has declined from the first 5 episodes; the backgrounds are still great, but the character animation has become crude and sloppy.  The comedy is non-stop, but seriously over the top.  Character reactions are overplayed in the extreme.  The gags are mostly good, but cheap and sleazy sex jokes abound.  Amane's conduct, in particularly, is ridiculously exhibitionistic and provocative.  Seina's personal robot, NB, is accidentally transformed into a mechanical pervert who likes to stir up trouble at every opportunity by replaying embarrassings moments for anyone who'll watch.
Don't get me wrong, this DVD is really funny.  The story is still good, and the characters are still interesting.  Just be warned that it is often seriously rude, crude, and lewd.  Also, check out track two of the English subtitles; it's a more literal translation from the Japanese than the dub, and sometimes the differences are so huge that you have to wonder what story Funimation was watching when they wrote the script.",1082505600,,1929,5.118210862619808
