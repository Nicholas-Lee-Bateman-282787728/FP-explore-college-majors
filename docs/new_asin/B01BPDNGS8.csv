7665038,5,B01BPDNGS8,"This season 2 box was released with all 24 episodes,nearly a year ago here in Sweden (EUROPE).I strongly recommend it to all people that,just like me is of the opinion that it nowadays seems to be nearly impossible to produce shows like this. It's only beaten by Mannix.

Buy and enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!",1264032000,4,297,4.823529411764706
7665039,5,B01BPDNGS8,"William Conrad had been around for quite some time before he became best known for being private eye Frank Cannon in the Quinn Martin television series, ""Cannon."" He had been an actor, producer, and director for movies and television shows, and was best known for three programs that used his voice only - being the voice of Matt Dillon on the radio version of ""Gunsmoke,"" the narrator of the classic cartoon series ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,"" and the narrator of another Quinn Martin series, ""The Fugitive.""

When Martin looked for someone to play an overweight, but very capable private eye in Cannon, he could have picked a better actor than Conrad. Even though he was best known for his vocal talents, Conrad made Cannon a flesh and blood character - charming, humorous, compassionate, and on occasion, violent. For once, Conrad had a chance to show as much talent on camera as he had off camera. And with Martin's penchant for creating solid detective dramas, Cannon became a very popular series.

Conrad would have other notable gigs after Cannon, the emcee of CBS' Thanksgiving Day festivities, the DA in ""Jake and the Fatman,"" and for too brief a time, ""Nero Wolfe,"" but he will always be remembered at the portly detective who drove a Mark IV, had a car phone (very rare at the time), and who knew as much about cooking as he did the law.",1263427200,22,1361,4.714285714285714
7665040,1,B01BPDNGS8,The show is great. The set is not. Splitting up a season is like a cake without the icing. As smart as splitting War & Peace into War. And Peace.,1263081600,9,145,3.8666666666666667
7665041,5,B01BPDNGS8,"Cannon is an excellent TV Show.  William Conrad's performance is superb and Frank Cannon is one of the most memorable characters in television history.  Cannon, like other Quinn Martin Shows has lots of location footage, great guest stars, great writing and high production values.

Cannon Season 2 is great!  All 24 episodes are good or better!  Not a single mediocre or bad episode!  An amazing achievement!

This DVD contains Episodes #37-48 from Season 2.  Some personal favorites of mine are ""Death Is A Stone Sea Horse, The Dead Samaritan, The Seventh Grave, Catch Me If You Can, and Deadly Heritage.

I hope everyone who can will buy Cannon Season 2 Volume 2 DVD.  You will have many hours of great television to watch!

Paramount thanks for releasing Cannon Season 1 and Season 2 on DVD.  Paramount please release Cannon Season 3 on DVD soon!
Thanks Paramount!

God Bless!",1261872000,8,880,4.864864864864865
7665042,5,B01BPDNGS8,"Cannon, which ran for 5 seasons from 1971 to 1976, was a terrific detective mystery series led by the incredibly fit big actor William Conrad.  They didn't have altering computers or trick cameras back then, and besides him being a wonderful dramatic actor (see The Killers with Burt Lancaster), he appears to be actually doing most of his athletic stuntwork and definitely all the chasing of the criminals.  He had a gruffly endearing manner as Detective Frank Cannon, and the stories were intelligently written and peppered with many popular TV and film stars of the day, some listed below next to their featured episode of this Season Two, Volume 2 3DVD set:

Nobody Beats the House - John Marley, Tom Skerritt
Hard Rock Rollercoaster - Charlotte Stewart, John Vernon

7665043,4,B01BPDNGS8,"Nothing kills nostalgia like watching the shows we used to love in the 70s and 80s. But THIS is one of the few that really has held up very well, despite the relative corniness and innocence of the times. I would imagine it will appeal mostly to those of us who weren't raised on the more modern (ie, fast-edited, mega-violent and raunchy) shows, but even young people who prefer well scripted and acted dramas might enjoy this one.

Like so many others, I lament the failure of the studio to release subsequent seasons.",1331251200,2,520,4.591397849462366

7665045,4,B01BPDNGS8,"Cannon was one of the best P.I. shows of all time. It is a shame CBS Paramont isn't remastering this series. I have the first season of Barnanby Jones, (another Quinn Martin Production) It has been remastered, and looks great! Come on CBS Paramount, give Cannon
the same treatment.",1310169600,2,281,4.755102040816326
7665046,1,B01BPDNGS8,"Great show, but as is the case with many Universal/Paramount releases, they simply stop releasing DVD's after a few seasons if they think that the show isn't selling well enough: Even if the low sales are because of splitting seasons into volumes and ultimately charging twice as much per season. They are notorious for ending the release of a series after a season or two. Some real geniuses working there. I'm now stuck with partial runs of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Night Gallery, etc... and now Cannon. If you like to collect full runs of classic TV shows like I do, it's almost better not to buy the first seasons from Universal/Paramount in the first place. They're the the worst, and obviously couldn't care less about their customers.",1297555200,6,743,4.858267716535433

7665048,4,B01BPDNGS8,"A superb show that improved with each season. One star off for visably blurry DVD's, which look passable when viewed on a portable, but appeared faded on a large screen.",1285804800,2,169,4.666666666666667
7665049,4,B01BPDNGS8,"The second season of Cannon finishes up in 1973 on DVD with a continuation in the tradition of faded images and bleak color from inferior masters. Frank Cannon looks great making an appearance on the premier episode of Barnaby Jones from 1973, another Quinn Martin series, for which CBS did a far superior job of transferring to DVD than Cannon. Hopefully CBS will up the film elements of Cannon to the standard of their first early '70's Quinn Martin series on DVD, The Streets Of San Francisco, which looks marvelous.",1269820800,3,519,4.777777777777778

to order.  I recommend purchasing it.  So far I have enjoyed watching this
show and would recommend it to everyone to watch it again as it have been
along time since it was on TV.  This show was purchased on Amazon and I have
purchase alot of the old shows from Amazon. They are very good about shipping
it fast.",1268524800,7,391,4.1866666666666665

They really need to give you all of the season at onetime.",1266969600,11,315,3.787878787878788

8750971,5,B01BPDNGS8,"Cannon Season One and Two were previously released in 2008 thru 2010 on pressed DVDs by CBS/Paramount. The first 2 seasons were released as 2 Volumes per season. Then in 2013 CBS/Paramount released season 3 in its entirety, however they put it on DVD-Rs instead of pressed DVDs. Pressed DVDs are supposed to last longer than DVD-Rs. Then CBS/Paramount did NOT release the final 2 seasons of Cannon. CBS/Paramount did not remaster Cannon. The video quality is like VHS, contrasty and sometimes there is a thin band of color on the left side of the screen. Then in 2015 VEI released Cannon as a box set with all 5 seasons including the pilot movie and the ""revival"" movie, ""The Return of Frank Cannon"". Now in 2016 VEI has also released the 2nd season separately. This VEI release is NOT remastered and is missing the episodic promos that were on the earlier CBS/Paramount releases. However ALL the DVDs are on pressed DVDs and are single sided and have color labels on them unlike the grey labels that CBS/Paramount used. Each season is in a  plastic  6 DVD case, except for season 5 which is a 7 DVD case, and all the cases fit in a cardboard slipcase. And it appears all the original 1970s music is retained and the episodes are NOT cut, they are complete and are around 50 minutes each. The extras are the 2 movies and a 7 minute slide show of scenes from the series set to the theme music. Cannon is different than the rest of the private eye shows, he is a loner with no regular supporting cast like the Rockford files and Mannix and he is fat, William Conrad frequently jokes about his weight. Cannon is a fast paced show with believable action in it. Cannon is a tough, but likeable guy. It's too bad VEI didn't remaster Cannon, the show deserves it, but at least they released the whole series uncut on colorful pressed DVDs. If you like classic TV with masculine private eyes and fast paced stories you should buy Cannon.",1460505600,2,1929,4.5243553008595985
