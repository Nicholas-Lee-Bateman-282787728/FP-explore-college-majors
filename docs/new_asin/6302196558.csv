7822440,5,6302196558,"At less than 15 minutes, you're getting the ""Word To The Mutha"" clip along with behind the scenes footage on the set of the video. The most significant aspect of this VHS is the fact that it features all six members of New Edition together (something that would not take place again for another five years). The song and video are impressive, and effectively symbolize the loss of innocence that the New Jack Era had experienced by the fall of 1991: both Ralph Tresvant and Michael Bivins use rough language (previously unheard of at that point), and the rest of the group appears to be taking on a rougher edge - especially Bobby Brown. All in all, this VHS is worth the pesos for New Jack Swing era nostalgics -  if you can actually find a copy, that is.
