2542176,5,B000EWBOCC,"Clifford Antone kept the Blues alive during the 70's, 80's and 90's at his clubs in Austin, TX. His habit of bringing artists in for a week's engagement meant that young artists like SRV and Doyle Bramhall Jr. could hang out with these cats and learn their riffs. This collection of jams, recollections, and pure blues energy will be a treat to any blues lover. Highly recommended.

If you dig this, also check out Kenny Wayne Sheppard's new CD/DVD, 10 Days Out. A similar collection of old blues masters, but with more complete cuts.

Let's hope Antone's Records releases full DVD versions of these seminal bluesmen in their natural environment,",1178755200,,646,4.863636363636363

2542179,5,B000EWBOCC,What a great documentary about such legendary venue. Antone's should be registered by the Austin authoritys as a historic landmark. This place can be a meca for blues lovers from all over the world. Cliffford Antones was a man who follow his dreams and provided joy to many blues musicians and public in general.,1159228800,2,312,4.796296296296297
2542180,5,B000EWBOCC,"This DVD is not for anyone expecting muscial performances.  It is a history class about someone who contributed to the blues revolution.  Antone's shows clips on virtually every important blues act of the day.  It is informative and educational. While music was going thru its transition of disco, glam, and metal Antone was creating a foundation of the blues movement.  It is an informal documentary that is pleasing.  Now that we know tapes of and young Stevie Ray exists, please release them!!!!!!!!!!!!!.",1156809600,12,508,5.146341463414634

2542182,5,B000EWBOCC,"I've lived in Austin for over 8 years now, after relocating here from another part Texas.  I was privlaged to meet Mr. Antone (but he would always tell you to call him Cliff) on sevearl occassions over the years. He may not have remembered my name every time, but I was always 'brother' or 'buddy'. He was truly one of a kind.  He was generaous to a fault, the type of man who would give you the shirt off his back or the last penny in his pocket. I had heard there were nights when whatever band was playing, was playing for tips, and it was a rather slow night, and tips were slow.  Somehow or other, at the end of the night, Clifford would manage to get a $100.00 bill in there without anyone seeing.  There were times I was in the club, when some young band would come on.  You could just look at these kids (15-18 years of age), and tell they were scared to death.  Clifford was a lot like Ed Sullivan, in the the way he introduced people. They were 'wonderful', 'terrific', 'fantastic'.  With just a few words of introduction, you'd see the change in these young kids faces.  He gave them the confidence to take charge of their music, and lay it down with the best of them, and play to the best of their abilites.  I remember one night, when a young Gary Clark Jr. and Eaves Monsees (Austin home grown blues musicians) were both just 15 or 16 years old.  Both guitar players, and still in High School.  He introduced them to the crowd, like they had been playing for years, treated them like royalty.  Later when the headliner (Jimmie Vaughn!!) was about done with his set at 1:45 in the morning, he invited these kids on the stage to jam with him.  The torch had been passed, much like Albert King, Freddie King and Albert Collins had done for Jimmie and his brother Stevie Ray Vaughn years earlier.  What a night that was and I'm glad I was there to see it.  Clifford, I will miss you, and the world of blues music, and Austin will never be the same.  So folks, if you want a life changing experience, pick up this DVD. It will give you an insight into the passion and life of this fine, wonderful, terrific and fantastic man; and the blues he loved so much. We'll miss you Cliff.",1150329600,16,2188,4.274271844660194
2542183,5,B000EWBOCC,"This DVD came out in 2004 in Australia. I have been looking for its US release for 18 months. Unfortunately, Clifford Antone died earlier this year so this DVD has been posthumously released. This documentary is extraordinary. It has RARE footage of Eddie Taylor (Hey, probably the only footage of Jimmy Reed's axe man and Freddie King's mentor) it is wonderful! Also the glimpse of Jimmy Roger's (James Lane) playing and jamming with Jimmie Vaughan. That is worth the whole price of the thing.

Plus, it has B.B. King recognising Clifford's support of the blues, plus more RARE footage of Pinetop Perkins and the great Sunnyland Slim. Albert King and Albert Collins are both discussed and we see Albert Collins playing in the club with the house band. Also we see a young, pre-famous SRV playing in the club BEFORE he was with Lou Ann Barton's band (and even playing a Telecaster for a second!).

As a guitarist I have always been a big fan of the Texas Blues Guitar and in this DVD you will get the whole lowdown on the scene since the 1970s. Warning: the film is rough, lots of incomplete snips of performances, a bit amateur on the filming and editing, BUT the stuff is so rare and the fact that you also see the only available footage of so many greats, like Luther Tucker (he was lost to the scene for over 10 years) totally makes the investment worth it.

 You will enjoy this film if you love Blues or even music in general. It has great still pictures of the greats of Blues from Clifford's collection, good interviews with Antone, Kim Wilson, BB King, Jimmie Vaughan (The T-Birds were the house band at Antone's), Lou Ann Barton, Angela Strehli, Marcia Ball, Willie ""Big Eyes"" Smith (Muddy Water's Band), Billy Gibbons and many more. The whole section on Hubert Sumlin (Howlin' Wolf's guitarist) is also very touching. Clifford took Hubert in after Wolf died and had no more gigs-he even got him glasses to see what he was doing again! Get this DVD today!",1149292800,51,1965,4.621776504297994
2542184,5,B000EWBOCC,"Even if the blues isn't your favorite music, you'll enjoy this documentary. I've never been to Antone's club in Austin, but this movie makes me want to go see a show there! I was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening of the film a few months ago and I'm looking forward to getting a copy of the DVD, with the bonus features, etc. This is the real thing, folks!",1147824000,9,370,4.3
2542185,4,B000EWBOCC,"A quality documentary, detailing a classic venue for the classics, talkin' 'bout the blues..at Antone's in Texas!

Rock and Roll has the Stone Pony, CGBG's, The Fillmore(s), etc. The Blues, well, you have Jason's in Belmar, NJ, you have B. B. King's in Manhattan, NY, and you have Antone's...right around the corner, regionally speaking, from Chicago, Delta, Memphis C7-F7-G7 meccas. Here we see James Cotton, Albert King, B. B. King, Marcia Ball, et. al., on stage and back stage; and in splendid still shots.

This is not a didactic pieece, just a warm, engaging, look-back at the professional and personal interaction of all the big names you need in blues.

For this reviewer, less interview segments and more complete performance segments should be the ticket. On the other hand, we have the unique chance to get up close and personal with the great Buddy Guy, who is seen and heard throughout. Also some long overdue footage of the ""hot mama"" Lou Ann Barton, conspicuously absent on so many documentaries.

A nice companion to the Clint Eastwood and Martin Scorsese sets.",1324252800,,1077,4.966666666666667

2542188,5,B000EWBOCC,"If you love the Blues or, as I do, play the Blues this DVD is a real treasure.

2542189,5,B000EWBOCC,"Get this DVD. Hold on a minute. Doesn't this reviewer usually wait until he gives 101 reasons why the reader should (or should not) spend time, money and energy on a reviewed item? Get this DVD. Why? This writer has strewn this space with more examples of historically important moments, events or personalities in music and other arts, general human culture and politics than one can shake a stick at. What drives this work is an attempt to give notice to the sometimes unknown (or not well-known) sources and support system for the kind of things that interest him. The blues interests him. And if one views this little gem of a DVD about the efforts of  the late Clifford Antone, who for over thirty years was the pivotal figure in the Austin, Texas blues (and other genre) scene, then one will understand what I am trying to get at in these reviews.

Look, these days the popularity of the blues is at one of its lower points. Others forms of entertainment, including the rise and continued dominance of the variants of the hip-hop tradition among the young, the passing or retirement of the post-World War II legendary electric blues players that formed the transmission belt from the early rural blues tradition and dwindling number of us who still value this quintessential form of American music has taken it toll. As this DVD rather graphically, lovingly and with a bit of humor points out the role of ""keeper of the flame"" is, as they say, a hard dollar.

Yet beginning in 1975 (another low blues point) Clifford Antone and his friends did exactly that. This documentary is filled with the exploits, great and small, that went into that task, including the usual ""talking head"" commentary that one expects (and here wants) in this kind of documentary). Now ""Antone's""  in Austin, Texas does for the blues tradition what the promoters of mountain music in Ashville, North Carolina or the owners of Club Passim (now non-profit) and Caffe Lena's did for folk music in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Saratoga, New York  have done to `keep the flame alive' in these important musical traditions. But even more than that Clifford Antone and friends, seemingly, connected with every important living blues tradition of the last half of the 20th century. There are probably few places in America where the Muddy Waters/Howlin' Wolf tradition (in the person of legendary guitarist Hubert Sumelin) could meet Stevie Ray and Jimmy Vaughn, Doug Sahm, the Thunderbirds and a host of other Texas talent- and it worked. Get this DVD. Oops, I said that already, didn't I.",1250640000,,2563,4.855835240274599
2542190,5,B000EWBOCC,"As a die-hard Texas Blues fan this DVD was an awesome history lesson on one of the greatest promoters of the blues. Antone's is the home of Texas blues and watching this DVD provided an excellent history behind the making of legends. There are some really neat clips of some of the greatest blues artists never before seen.
A must own/must see.",1231891200,,344,4.564516129032258
2542191,5,B000EWBOCC,"This is one of the best blues documentaries that has ever been done.  To see all these true legends again is like going home.  I grew up in Chicago and saw most of these guys many times.  I am kicking myself that I didn't ever get to Antones for these incredible jam sessions, but I count myself incredibly lucky for the many times that I got to see the musical legends that are profiled in this film.

The only thing that could make this film better is more music and less history.  WHERE are the Antone's video and audio archives?  Full versions of these legendary performances NEED to see the light of day !!!

2542192,5,B000EWBOCC,"This dvd does a great job of showing us the passion of lifelong Blues fan, Clifford Antone. The real highlights are the footage of the tremendously talented and underrated Luther Tucker, whose talent is evident on songs such as ""War Boy"" and ""Playboy"". He was an excellent rhythm guitarist. There is also wonderful footage of Eddie Taylor, the backbone behind Jimmy Reed and all his great hits. Jimmy Reed was the the first crossover Rhythm & Blues Artist, except for perhaps Louis Jordan. It is a shame that this is the only available footage of Tucker and Taylor. It's also a pleasure to see Jimmy Rogers perform, and to see a young Stevie Ray Vaughan. Jimmie Vaughan's enthusiasm comes across loud and clear, but the real star of the documentary is Clifford Antone. The extras with Buddy Guy and Pintetop Perkins are a pleasant addition to this dvd.",1213660800,,852,4.763513513513513
2542193,5,B000EWBOCC,"I bought this DVD at the same time as the much better known and fawned over Lightning in a Bottle ...  what a contrast.  Lightning is nice in that some blues legends (albeit not too many of the more obscure ones) have some big time attention lavished on them, but it almost seemed like they were treating the musicians as novelties ...tiring of the pristine rendering of Lightning, I popped it out after about 45 minutes and put this DVD in.  Wow.  What a telling contrast.  Clifford Antone loved, lived and (a little) played the blues and cherished the performers - this is truly the tribute album while also chronicling some of the history of Antone's.  The other great thing about this DVD is that the treatment is such that Antone's could have been in pretty much any town, it does not have to rely on that too often overdone Austin cache for validity or authenticity.  This is so much more than advertised.  Highly highly highly recommended.",1204848000,,946,4.622754491017964
