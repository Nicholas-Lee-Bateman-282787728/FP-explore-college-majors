8007763,1,B00018D5HG,"I was pleased to see they had remastered the original Marco Polo Jr. versus The Red Dragon. However, after watching the movie, I was horrified they completely tore the movie apart and turned it into some horrific Disney-fied freak show. This is the worst remake/remastering of a movie ever. My childhood was destroyed by whoever made this. Terrible. I want to give it negative stars.",1378944000,2,383,4.907692307692308
8007764,4,B00018D5HG,"If you know our history, you will enjoy this movie.  The story approaches the basic content of the way history said it happened, but the plot is different. You will like the twist in the plot and the laughter will come.",1358640000,,219,4.341463414634147
8007765,4,B00018D5HG,"This film was originally made in 1972 by Eric Porter Productions in Australia, as that country's first animated feature film.  It was a 50-50 co-production deal between Porter and American artist and script-writer Sheldon Moldoff.
As one of the unit directors on the film, I thoroughly enjoyed working on it and, for its budget of maybe one-eighth of a contemporary Disney animated feature, I felt that it stood up pretty well.
But I always thought that it would benefit from a bit of tightening up, and so was interested when Ron Merk contacted me a few years ago with the news that he and Moldoff were going to rework the film.
In general, I think they have done a good job, although the climactic battle between Marco and the evil villain is not as good as I was hoping it would be.  Nevertheless, I give it four stars - so go ahead and buy it, it's good fun!",1186012800,11,862,4.449367088607595
