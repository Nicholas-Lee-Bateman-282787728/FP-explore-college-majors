4982183,5,B006B8949S,"This is the most unique series you'll EVER watch, unfortunately you have to use a multi-region DVD player in order to see it.  Why it's not available yet for us in the USA baffles me.  There are many Noel Fielding fans here who want this!  Hear us ROAR!  BASOOOO!

Okay, having said that, let me get to my review of this second, and final, season of LUXURY COMEDY!  First, this season has much more structure with its narration than the first season.  The first season seemed like Noel and friends were trying on various characters' costumes and masks, really working on the development, and just at play.  There's something very enjoyable watching that, however with ""Tales from Painted Hawaii"" we get Noel taking on a totally different concept where his gang are working at a coffee shop on the edge of a volcano!  This I took to mean as a metaphor for the show in general -- very much on the edge of life and show cancellation, as well as the audience never knowing what to expect as far as how explosively strange and obnoxious things can get!

What's best about the show are the little ""shows within the show"" : from the opening episode's outrageous internet sensation, a day glo turquoise half panther man with blue tits, Paul Panfer, to ""The Adventures of Joey Ramone"" where the punk icon is a plastic/play-doh figurine in a topsy-turvy world of other such figurines, to the Bryan Ferry-sing-songy-voiced Fantasy Man in his neon Tron-like dimension where we're never sure if he's ever really part of reality or not, and so many other little vignettes it's hard to list them all.  Noel has a crayon box full of characters roaming about all the time, dishing them out left and right and off-center, you'll find you really don't want just five episodes, you really want things to slow down a bit, because you begin to really care about these individuals.  It's the best silly show Noel's ever done, and I'm happy someone let him get away with this and set it loose upon the world!

So, if you can't get it on DVD, try to find it on YouTube or see if you can find it streaming online via BBC, or any other internet TV show viewing service.  It's a trip.  Like a hot cup of lava java, it's a good jolt of funny.",1454889600,,2213,4.4975
4982184,5,B006B8949S,"Even if you've never seen Noel Fielding's special brand of comedic genius before, or watched ""The Mighty Boosh"", let go of all logic, and watch this while keeping in mind that this is like a children's show made for adults, complete with ""no-no potty mouth"" language and grown-up situations.  It's also filled with so many references and homages to artists, musicians, and cult films, you could make a drinking game out of just how many Noel and his characters make per episode.  For me, this was a pure art house, psychedelic, dream experience heaven.  I absolutely loved it.  But in order to understand it, you really have to just exit reality for awhile.

In this first season, it felt to me like Noel was really exploring the various characters he was trying on like so many costumes and masks he could think up -- and he thinks of a lot of them!  The comedy -- is it luxurious?  It runs at such a fast pace, so bright and loud, yet so uninhibited from the usual constraints of conventional TV show fare, it's refreshing every now and then to watch something that truly is ""art"" and not another gross out, rude animation that appeals strictly to the ignorant masses.  Luxury Comedy appeals to those of us who are ""in"" on the in jokes.  I'm from Noel's generation, I went to art school right around the same time, listened to and loved the same music, etc., so watching this was very much like seeing something my friends' would've made as a college project, that is, had we ever been as ambitious and brave as Noel.

With that said, this show does have guts and balls to be so strange and non-sequitur.  It's an acquired taste, but also delicious for those of us who already have the taste for it!",1454889600,6,1701,4.50814332247557

Fair warning, if you're not familiar with Fielding's other work (like The Mighty Boosh), it will look bizarre. But that's part of its charm! :)",1469318400,2,312,4.491228070175438

It's surreal in the best ways possible, nonsensical in all the best ways possible, and it never stops striving to provide something new and fun, it's the most decadent show and the title luxury is all in favor of the audience. It's Dr. Seuss meets Andy Kaufman meets Robin Williams meets Salvador Dali and a sprinkle of David Bowie. The luxury is ours Noel, Thanks.",1469232000,3,400,4.647887323943662
