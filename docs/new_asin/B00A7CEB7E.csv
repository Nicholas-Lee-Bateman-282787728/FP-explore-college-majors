But...

I have actually been interested in yoga for quite some time, and so I thought who better than the lovely Yoga Jordan to initiate me into this practice? So I took up yoga with Jordan. Today. About half an hour ago actually. I just finished my first ""sun salute"" routine, which is the sequence of poses (asanas) that Jordan covers in this dvd.

It's funny. I watched the dvd a couple of times before I actually had a go at tackling the routine, and I thought it just looked like a variety of pretty simple, even relaxing poses, but it's a lot harder and more strainful than it looks. Even the more simple looking asanas are challenging to hold for long. I'm a 30 year old guy. I'm very fit and active but I've been feeling my age a lot more in the last couple of years. So I've started taking more time to stretch before undertaking demanding physical pursuits. Trying to follow the sun salute routine with Yoga Jordan was another reminder that I'm not getting any younger. But I guess when you stretch you want to feel plenty of strain. That's the point.

Of course, yoga is supposed to be relaxing though. Or at least it's supposed to teach you to relax and stay calm. Jordan does a good job of covering this aspect of yoga, with plenty of focus on breathing and staying relaxed. While going through the asanas Jordan suggests when to breath in and when to breath out, and continually reminds us of the importance of our breathing being in sync with our movements. I thought she covered that aspect very well. Unfortunately I was unable to really follow her breathing guidelines at all first time 'round, because I was more focused on trying to hold these poses which were stressing me out a lot more than I'd hoped or expected. But I guess that's the point of getting the breathing right. It allows the body to relax. I'm sure over time I'll be able to focus more on Yoga Jordan's breathing guidelines and it'll all come together.

The dvd is made up of a brief intro in which Yoga Jordan tells us a little bit about Yoga, how she uses it in her life, and how we can apply it to our own lives. She then runs through each of the asanas separately, in detail, outlining exactly how we should move in and out of the poses, what part of our bodies should be doing what, where we should feel it, and how we should breath. She then runs through the whole sun salute routine as one, allowing the viewer to follow along and do the routine with her. During this segment she still uses plenty of detail, outlining the movements and breathing techniques, making it easy to carry out the movements even when they require turning your head away from the screen. Anybody who knows a little bit about Jordan will know that English is not her first language. It is however mine. And I thought Jordan did a very good job with the English overdub, or whatever you call it. Clear and easy to understand.

Anyway, I don't know that I could say this dvd is actually worthy of a 5 star rating. I mean it's well put together. But it's very short and simple. I think a 4 would be a fair rating. When I heard that Jordan was doing this dvd I had of course hoped for, and pictured her in maybe a sports bra and some little gym shorts during the shooting. I'd also hoped for some extras and special features like maybe some footage of Jordan not wearing much and being really hot in various locations. But I guess I give props to Yoga Jordan for keeping this dvd serious and focused on yoga. Although I would say that one negative side effect of the dvd being all business is that Jordan's fun and highly appealing personality doesn't come across at all, like it does in the pictures and videos she does for her website etc.

But yeah, I gave the dvd the 5 star rating because Jordan is an exquisitely hot babe with a jaw dropping 32HH chest, and so she has the advantage of getting preferential treatment from guys like me, which is exactly the way it should be. Hey, who ever said it was a fair world? I have no shame...",1360972800,10,4186,4.38659793814433
