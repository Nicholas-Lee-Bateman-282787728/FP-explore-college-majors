8121769,5,B000FFJ8S0,X is an anime I have been wanting to complete for a long time. I was very surprised to find how good the condition of this rare box was. Love the felt cover and interesting design.,1388620800,,180,4.027777777777778
8121770,4,B000FFJ8S0,"X is one of the many series I've picked up as a result of me being a collector of Geneon DVDs. Two very rare auctions ended on eBay.co.uk on the same day, one for the rare remix set and one for the less rare two bailey box sets - I won the latter.

The series description sounds interesting enough to interest most anime fans: In X there are a total of fourteen people from various walks of life who have psychic abilities (varying from controlling machines to controlling elemental forces). Seven are destined to be Dragons of Heaven; a group who fight to preserve the Earth as it is now by protecting seals located in Tokyo, while the other seven are destined to be Dragons of Earth; a group destined to destroy the Earth by destroying the seals. Among these psychics is one known as Kamui, the only one that can select his own destiny by becoming the leader of either group and, with him being the most powerful, save or destroy the earth as a result.

Very disappointingly, the above description is practically all the plot you're going to get out of X. As interesting as the concept is, it wasn't executed very well at all and there really wasn't much depth at all.

What frustrated me about the story was how flashbacks appeared far too often and went on for far too long when the series is only 24 episodes long, one episode actually being a recap. The time spent needlessly treading over old ground repeatedly could've been spent improving the story, but...

The part of the plot I found most poorly executed was anything and everything related to the seals. The Dragons of Heaven are supposedly there to protect certain areas of Tokyo (where the seals are located), yet the seals can actually be broken easily by simply killing someone close to the seal protector and making them lose the will to fight. And, even if I was to ignore that, there's also the small matter of every other psychic aside from Kamui being worthless when only Kamui can kill Kamui (this will only by understandable if you watch the series) in order for the final seal to be broken.

Thankfully, the plot weakness caused by the needless amount of characters didn't ruin the series, the opposite being true. X wasn't created with the intention of providing a deep story with lots of twists, the goal instead clearly being to make X into one of the better character driven series out there. While very little time was spent developing the plot during the 24 episodes, a huge amount of it was spent on developing the large cast of characters, with the characters frequently getting episodes all to themselves so that you get attached to them. After those attachment episodes (once the manga author/animation team was sure you cared for the characters), the cast start to shorten in number due to tragic event after tragic event, resulting in the characters sticking in the tragic character section of my memory.

So, in a nutshell, X isn't recommend to those looking for an excellent story...but is recommend to those looking for well developed/likeable characters. Wouldn't it have been great if we could've had the best of both worlds?

Anyway, time to move on to everything else that needs mentioning, starting with the art/animation. The art looked good for a series that aired in 2002, my only real complaint about it being that some of the female characters looked more like ugly males. The animation wasn't very impressive at all for a series that involves fighting, the fights all being static and usually involving an attack being made and then a short conversation taking place before the next one - it isn't a series that people looking for action would be best pleased with. But, overall, X looks more than good enough for a series that's focused on character development and emotions.

The other thing that needs mentioning is the music, but there's really not much to say... I found it to be an easy to forget soundtrack that fitted the series good enough. None of the tracks stood out in an amazing or awful way.

Note: Before my last words, I want to mention something else in case people want to know: There's very light yaoi in X. There are many moments where straight guys won't be best pleased with what they're seeing, although nothing of a sexual nature takes place. When 4 females create a manga with a cast that's nearly all male I suppose it isn't surprising to see some minor yaoi goings on, such as hand holding, a gay love sub-plot and a man licking another mans neck... I know what would happen if the reverse occurred!

That's pretty much it. All that remains is for me to say that I thought X was heavily flawed but worth my time. I recommend it it to anyone looking for an emotional ride.

So I bought this DVD box set, I thought I'd pass out from all the joy I felt.

Okay, okay enough jokes and on to a real review...^__^
(BTW please pardon the spelling)

So I bought this Collectors set and was quite pleased with my parchase. I had bought it in a store and so the picture and my box set is a completly different look. Mine is gold letters and fuzzy cover.
Either way its the same thing so I am able to state my opinion.
I watched it first in English and and the sound was crisp and clear, it really made the colors stand out!
Then this is where it gets a tad disapointing...
I then watched it in Japanese...it has two choices to choose from...I really did not see any difference, but I was dissapointed by the quality.
If it is suppose to be re-mastered or re-mixed you'd think they'd make both laungages crisp and clear. Instead your left with a muffled, dissapointing sound quality. It really takes the color away from the series.

The series is so sad and yet so awesome! I just got a little annoyed with all the re-caps of things to come and past episodes...that was a bit too much and could have been done without or a little less.

That sounds like a lot of negatives, but really the possitives are what make the series so good!
The characters, the shocking twists and turns, the colors, the visual effects...
There is way too much to name...that is just a few.
I recommend you go out and buy this seriese...be it here or in a store that sells anime, just go and buy it...You won't be dissapointed!",1207872000,,1539,4.311418685121107
8121772,5,B000FFJ8S0,"Out of all the anime that I have watched, X is still by far my favorite. The high price of this box set might turn some people off, but it is worth the price. The story centers around Kamui, a young man of 15 who has been given the fate of the world. But there are two Kamui, and the other just happens to be someone who was very close to him. Kamui must choose between two sides, The Dragons of Heaven (Seven Seals) who want to keep the world in its current condition, and the Dragons of Earth (Seven Angels) who want to wipe out mankind and let the Earth start again anew. One of the things that is hard for people I think, is the fact that there are like 17 major characters, and still more minor characters that have significance. However, these characters are memorable, and you'll know them by heart in no time.

I recommend this to people who are over the age of 13. There are a couple scenes with some brief, not graphic nudity, and there is a lot of violence. Nothing too bad to.

After watching this tragic tale, you'll need something to cheer you up however. The series makes me cry every time I watch certain episodes, and people do die. So be prepared.

This is really great though, and comes highly recommended from me. The manga is also excellent, but the movie isn't as good. So get this.. The anime!",1184112000,3,1316,4.27710843373494
8121773,4,B000FFJ8S0,"What can I say about X. Its a darn good anime with a pretty catchy story. I'm sure many of you will find it interesting and confusing at the same time...but it all falls in place at the end so its not as bad some may say. As for quality I would say this anime has pretty top notch stuff. Story is pretty good, though like I said it is a mind bender. Music is good and catchy ""Drowning in my dream!"" ...ahh yeah pretty catchy. Although it has some imperfections (like what happened to Kanoe or why wasn't Nataku's character developed more)..it is still a pretty good anime. For those younger viewers, I wouldn't suggest it to them (besides the story itself would be too confusing for them anyways)...there is some violence (and people DO die!) very very brief nudity, but nothing to close your eyes to. I would say around 13 and up would be appropriate. BTW...skip episode 00. Gives way too much info on what happens. SO skip it!!",1174867200,3,929,4.406976744186046
8121774,4,B000FFJ8S0,"X is a very decent melodrama about one of anime's favorite subjects - the endtimes - with a shoujo twist.

Teenager Kamui Shirou returns to Tokyo to retrieve a magical sword reputed to eventually play a part in the battle between the forces of preservation (to be represented by seven psychics of varying powers called Dragons of Heaven) and the forces of destruction (seven opposing psychics called Dragons of Earth).

However, Kamui is more concerned about keeping his worried best friends, siblings Fuma and Kotori Monou, out of his problems - especially when the situation becomes more complicated when he finds out he has a choice between becoming the leader of the Dragons of Heaven or Dragons of Earth.  When he finally decides to lead the Dragons of Heaven, he does so only to find that his decision has doomed Fuma to become the leader of the Dragons of Earth, instantaneously and horrifically altering his personality.  As Fuma gathers the Dragons of Earth, the other six Dragons of Heaven rally around Kamui - including Tokyo Babylon main character Subaru Sumeragi, seven years later still an emotional train wreck and drawing breath only to find the man he loves, Dragon of Earth Seishiro Sakurazuka, for a reckoning regarding what happened between them (for the full impact of their story, I strongly suggest reading the seven volume Tokyo Babylon manga before either watching or reading X).  Subaru isn't so soul dead, however, that Kamui's plight doesn't bring out his innate kindness, and knowing more than a little bit about Kamui's pain he becomes the boy's emotional support.

However, although the other Dragons of Heaven have their own issues and Subaru does indeed eventually face Seishiro again, this is ultimately Kamui's story, as he tries to bring Fuma back to him - and wrestles with the question of what he will do if he has to stop Fuma by any means necessary.

The series isn't perfect - for one thing there are far too many momentum-killing flashbacks - but it's strengths outweigh it's weaknesses.  A great amount of time is spent introducing us to all of the fourteen very different psychics, and they are all adequately fleshed out with the exception of the frightening yet oddly sympathetic asexual clone Nataku, who could have been an even more fascinating character if the question of whether it has a soul or not had been further pursued.  We get to know them well enough that when the final battles begin in the last quarter of the series, we care about what happens to the Dragons of Heaven and even some of the Dragons of Earth who resist the roles that fate has cast them in.

That, in the end, is what this kind of story is all about; and if you want to curl up with a good angstfest this might fit your bill.  I would only strongly recommend skipping Episode 0, which is only a summary of the general idea of the story that gives away too much.",1171152000,6,2888,4.721669980119285
