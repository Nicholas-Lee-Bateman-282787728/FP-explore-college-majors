8676292,3,B00N4X8S0Y,I ended up giving it away to someone who could appreciate it more than I could. I was into wrestling as a kid but I never really checked out WCW back then. I thought maybe this DVD would get me into it but I fell asleep every time I tried to watch it. The guy I gave it to enjoyed it though so I'll still give it a 3.,1528761600,,317,3.608695652173913

8676297,4,B00N4X8S0Y,"NOTE: This is a one disc version of the previously released 3 disc set featuring only the documentary & bonus extras that were included on the first disc of the original set.

They were Pepsi to WWE's Coca-Cola in terms of being the closest competition that the company has ever had in it's entire history to the point where they were the #1 wrestling promotion in wrestling...this is the story of the company that started off as Jim Crockett Promotions but morphed into World Championship Wrestling. Throughout the presentation, you do hear from the usual crop of WWE associates who's had a history with WCW (Vince McMahon, Jim Ross, Michael Hayes, Arn Anderson, Ric Flair, Ron Simmons, Big Show a.k.a. ""The Giant"", Dean Malenko, Chris Jericho, Rey Mysterio, Gregory Helms, Mike Graham) but you also hear from those who you don't normally hear from & probably didn't expect to hear from at all (Kevin Sullivan, Jim & David Crockett, Magnum T.A., Bill Watts, Goldberg, and Dr. Harvey Shiller who was the President Of Turner Sports). Now a couple of notes here as well is that the big controversy surrounding the project was that Eric Bischoff chose to not be involved with this project based off WWE's negative showcasing & rewritten history of WCW over the years. WWE fixed that problem as best as they could by using past interview footage taken from other WWE projects (the old ""Confidential"" show & the Monday Night War DVD) & used here to get comments from people like Bischoff along with other names like Hulk Hogan, Booker T, Diamond Dallas Page, and Scott Hall.

The documentary begins talking about how Jim Crockett Promotions came together along with the birth of Georgia Championship Wrestling and how that was the show that built the cable network we know know as TBS. The politics of the National Wrestling Alliance along with the creative innovations like Starrcade are discussed before into the story of ""Black Saturday"" where Vince McMahon took over the TBS timeslot and the aftermath of that whole deal where David Crockett said, ""we payed for WrestleMania."" The national expansion of JCP along their new talent being brought in (along with the tragic story of Magnum T.A.) are talked about before going into how that backfired on them & caused the sale to Turner. The transformation into WCW with changes behind the scenes along new talent, the in ring wrestling quality that even made Jim Ross admit they had a better in ring product than WWE at that time, and the classic feuds that happened during that period (Steamboat/Rude, Sting/Flair, Steamboat/Flair) were heavily talked about. Jim Herd's history with WCW along with the ""revolving door"" of bookers is discussed next before getting into the positives & negatives of what happened during Bill Watts' era of WCW. The introduction of Bill Shaw & the hiring of Eric Bischoff (along the irony behind that after what happened with Bill Watts) is talked about next before going into the steps taken to usher in the new era of WCW like the higher production level and the impact of Hulk Hogan signing with WCW & other ex-WWE personalities coming into the company leading to the birth of WCW Nitro & what Eric Bischoff did to be controversial & make his product different than WCW. The story behind the format of the nWo is heavily discussed next such as where the concept REALLY came from, the lawsuit filed by WWE, Hulk Hogan morphing into Hollywood Hogan, the innovations made to made the nWo look completely different from WCW, and Big Show talking about the details of Hall & Nash's contract which was pretty interesting to hear. The impact of the crusierweight division & Goldberg, how WCW dominated wrestling with their TV ratings/PPV buys were discussed next before going into the influx of celebrities into WCW with DDP telling the story of how the tag matches involving himself, Hogan, Dennis Rodman & Karl Malone, Eric Bischoff & Jay Leno came together and the mixed reactions by other WCW talents to it. The story behind the Goldberg vs. Hogan match on Nitro is heavily discussed next (you won't believe how Goldberg found out about it) before going into the heavy series of mistakes that WCW started to make ranging from what happened at Halloween Havoc '98 to certain wrestlers becoming the booker & being out for themselves to infamous ""Fingerpoke Of Doom"" to the undercard talent starting to leave the company. Incidents during the ""Vince Russo"" era of WCW is talked about such as David Arquette becoming the WCW Champion and the incident at Bash At The Beach '00 with Hulk Hogan and how it was so bad to the point where the talent themselves thought Vince McMahon sent him over to kill off the company...and listen to what Mike Graham had to say about Jeff Jarrett. The story of how the corporate merger of AOL Time Warner led to the end of WCW, WWE buying the company, and the legacy left behind of WCW close out the documentary.

DVD extras include bonus stories such as Dusty Rhodes talking about the ""Cactus Jack Is Missing"" series of videos, Bill Watts talking about the issues of ""racism"" that were put on him during his run of WCW, Bill Goldberg talking about where the elements of his character came from (you'll laugh when you hear how he got his ""Who's Next"" catchphrase), Harvey Shiller talking about a character named ""Spam Man"" which you have to hear to believe, and a piece from the old ""Confidential"" show with Eric Bischoff & Vince McMahon talking giving Eric away the results of RAW on Nitro.

As usual with every DVD, there are some positives & negatives. The big negative here is that the documentary seemed to go through all the post-Nitro era of the company too quickly for me (you went from the birth of Jim Crockett promotions to the nWo before the first hour was up). Although certain incidents & feuds in WCW's history were heavily talked about on other DVD's....there were still incidents here that could have been talked about or gone more in detail with like the expansion & merging with various promotions like the UWF, the Clash Of The Champions going head up against WrestleMania IV, the controversial ending of Starrcade '97 with Hogan vs. Sting, how the nWo got so big that there were more stars in that group than in WCW, and the issue of racism that was always apparent in WCW's history just to name a few.  The major positive for me that overshadows that is the fact that after seeing the negative image WWE gave out on WCW in the past...they did what they did on the Starrcade DVD and give a fair view on the company & kept it away from being a burial like how we've gotten before.  Overall, this isn't on the level of how the documentaries of ECW & World Class were but it was better than ""Monday Night War"" so this is something I would recommend as a ""starting point"" to learn the history about WCW and later get the other WCW related documentaries & DVD sets to hear about specific incidents & feuds.",1409702400,,6925,4.723738626964433
