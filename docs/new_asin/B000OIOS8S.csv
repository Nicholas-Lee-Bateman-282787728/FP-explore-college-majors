2796957,3,B000OIOS8S,"If you go further into the video, the poses are repeated with voice over giving direction and alternatives to the posture. Still not adaptive in terms of being on the floor.",1405123200,,173,4.612903225806452
2796958,1,B000OIOS8S,The video starts off with a man in a Buddha squat chanting.  There is no introduction.  It wasn't at all what the title claims.,1390867200,2,127,4.25
2796959,1,B000OIOS8S,"I have just reported this DVD to Amazon and requested that it be removed from Amazon. I will follow up to make sure that happens. It not only has nothing to do with the elderly, it could be dangerous for any elderly person to try the yoga poses featured, unless they are in exceptional shape and have done yoga for many years - in which case, they wouldn't be ordering this DVD!  I am a senior, and I teach yoga to people 50 and above, and I wouldn't give any of the poses on this DVD, except tadasana, mountain pose, to my students. The DVD starts with a young man seating himself in full lotus position, which many young people cannot do! Also, the DVD I received is only 27 minutes, and ""part 2"" is virtually identical to ""part 1.""  Do not buy this DVD - it's a fraud!",1383350400,6,771,4.167785234899329
2796960,1,B000OIOS8S,"I don't know who titled this DVD, but it is not for the elderly. I am a yoga teacher and have taken an interest in yoga for the elderly, chair yoga, etc. and am currently doing a training in chair yoga. I bought this DVD and was very disappointed. There's no way I could picture my 80+ year old grandmother doing this asana practice. This is much too advanced for most elderly people. Maybe good for someone who is older who was an althele most of their life and still in good shape with no joint issues, but not for the general elderly population. Not much advice is offered for modifcations either.

There are MUCH better DVDs out there. Peggy Cappy's Yoga for the Rest of Us series is excellent for example and came as part of my chair yoga teacher training materials. I enjoy the practice myself and she goes through several modifications some using a chair, some not. The people in her video class range from someone who looks about in his late 30's to people who look like they could be around 80.

So, buyer beware, this dvd is expensive and the title is deceiving as to the target audience.",1266537600,18,1098,4.403940886699507
8185424,5,B000OIOS8S,"I like that each prosition is shown so you know what you must do, and then you are given step by step inatructions",1473033600,,114,4.0
8185425,3,B000OIOS8S,The exercise are too advance for some elderly. There were no instructions of how to modify poses if they were too difficult.,1465257600,,124,4.681818181818182
8185426,1,B000OIOS8S,"Really?!?!  The first pose starts with the most impossible pose to do.  The nightmare that has held anyone back from ever thinking of doing yoga.  There is no talking just some person doing very difficult poses.  Don't waste your time even starting the streaming, much less buying it.  There are many others offered through Amazon Prime that are much better than this.  For the Elderly ...LOL",1453593600,,392,4.863636363636363
8185427,1,B000OIOS8S,"I watched only the first 10 minutes or so of this video. The initial pose is the lotus position. How is an elderly person supposed to get his/her legs in that position? I have a knee replacement. No way I could come even close to that. The following poses are fairly simple but they are demonstrated by young men. If you are going to do a yoga video for the elderly, you should have an elderly person demonstrate it. I watched this because it is one of the few yoga videos for seniors/the elderly that is available free streaming for Prime customers. My search for ""yoga for seniors"" turned up several that had to be either rented or bought. Come on, Amazon - give free streaming to seniors on fixed incomes who want to stay fit. Charge for power yoga that younger people who make more money will be interested in.",1446508800,2,814,4.397350993377484
8185428,1,B000OIOS8S,Not for the elderly or beginners.  The first pose shows a slender man in the classic cross-legged posture with his feet atop his thighs.,1432944000,2,136,4.666666666666667
8185429,5,B000OIOS8S,"This is one video in a series.  The first video in the series (Yoga: Mind Body Connection) is about 2 hours long and will teach you the asanas (poses/postures) used throughout the series.  The rest of the shorter videos, of which this is one, will simply demo a sequence of the particular asanas that will target the issue identified in the video title.  You do NOT get verbal instructions or coaching in this hour-long video.  You will need to go to the first video for that.  Here you get a presentation of the asanas recommended for a particular problem or issue [in this case, a recommended yoga practice for the elderly].  That said, I think this is one of the best targeted yoga series' out there.",1427068800,,703,4.5396825396825395
8185430,1,B000OIOS8S,I think the dvd got mixed up. It was an Indian meditation for the entire hour,1426809600,,77,3.875
8185431,1,B000OIOS8S,Not for the elderly or beginner. Terrible video. no instruction and  moves are in possible for someone who has not done yoga that much.,1426636800,,135,4.625
8185432,5,B000OIOS8S,"We're these people watching the same video???!!  This video was amazing! This is the premier elderly yoga vid on prime.  If you want to see flourescrnt polo shirt sporting men seemingly holding the same pose for 5 minutes, this is the video for you!  Sure, upon closer inspection the video was actually being frozen by the producers to make it seem like the instructors weren't moving but who cares.  This video has it all, wild graphics, cheap game show like backdrops and all the obnoxious bell noises you could hope for.  5 star vid!",1421107200,,536,4.659574468085107
8185433,1,B000OIOS8S,"This video did not work for me.  I think it assumes you know yoga in the first place.  There is no talking.  There is music in the background and a man starts out by sitting in the lotus position.  He holds that pose for quite some time.  Then the video changes to the man in a standing position.  He holds that pose for a long time.  I quit the video after that one.

I need to let you know that I have not watched yoga videos in the past.  I attend a local yoga class for seniors twice a week, and was looking for a video to supplement that.",1412380800,,543,3.908256880733945
