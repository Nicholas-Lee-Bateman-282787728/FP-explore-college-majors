8618609,5,B00009VREZ,"Beautiful and compelling documentary about the Pantanal - Brazil's shrinking region of wetlands and exotic wildlife. Also encapsulates a portrait of the rustic local peoples, their gritty attitude toward foreign invaders, and their reverence for a land whose landscape, ornery creatures,  and culture is in danger of being forever erased. Packed with cowboys, renegades and other true-life characters out of an older world; and sights as eery as an endless sea aglow with hundreds of crocidile eyes.
  Good for educational purposes, nature and environmental interests, or just plain entertainment. Excellent.",1055808000,3,608,5.733333333333333
