7948480,1,B00005O896,"This DVD is very disappointing because gives almost nothing about jumping that can be useful for a beginner rider.

I ride since 1 year ago and I am jumping obstacles up to 2 feet high, so I am a beginner that bought the dvd expecting some tips from Greg Best, but instead the title "" basic jumping""  it should be named ""Subbasic Jumping,"" because the information he gives is too poor for the price.",1178409600,2,399,4.378378378378378
7948481,4,B00005O896,"There is alot of good information in this video, some of which I have never been told by an instructor in all my years of riding.  The quality is a little amateurish, but overall the video is informative whether as a review or for someone just starting to jump.",1140912000,,261,4.326530612244898
7948482,4,B00005O896,"Greg Best is a great rider in his own right, and he is also a great teacher. In the video he is patient, clear, concise, and very effective in getting techniques across. I have all three tapes of this series and I think they're great.
The video says ""Basic Jumping"", but it mainly (and very appropriately) covers flatwork. Greg correctly states that jumping is essentially riding, just over a fence. And poor flatwork will only magnify problems over jumps.
The tape is not really a ""B""eginner tape (walk, trot, canter), but is a great supplement to riding classes. Additionally the entire set of tapes is something you can and should refer to every once in a while for a ""refresher"". I have been riding for over 10 years and I got a number of good ""basic techniques"" from this video.
I rated only 4 stars simply for the video quality and the Vogel boots ad. The video is good--but is essentially someone with a video-cam on a tripod. And the ad is just in poor taste--imho.
Highly recommended though!",1075680000,2,1000,4.592178770949721
7948483,5,B00005O896,I have all 3 of these videotapes...and they're fantastic instructional programs for the beginner through advanced. I strongly suggest anyone jumping should view these programs.,1008720000,3,176,6.08
