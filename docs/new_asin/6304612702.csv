926075,5,6304612702,I'm a fan of bad B-movies. My wife hates it. MST3K is the only thing that makes them tolerable. Root for the cat!,1361836800,,113,3.9565217391304346
926076,4,6304612702,"Yet again, those crazy guys and gals at Best Brains have made it possible to sit through an unwatchable movie without having to worry about your eyes and ears starting to bleed as a result of being exposed to so much boredom captured on video.  This isn't MST3K's best, however - I would classify it among the least enjoyable of the experiments made commercially available for public consumption.  Interestingly enough, however, this film may provide more scenes in Comedy Central's later advertisements about the show than any other experiment I know of: for those who still remember the good old days, you'll recognize the ""finish it"" drinking scene, the screaming nurse-like woman scene, and of course the classic Barney Fife going down the stairs scene.  Crow's Barney Fife impersonation is probably the highlight of this whole MST3K movie experience, though.  Mike and the bots are funny from start to finish, but there just aren't any truly spectacular MST3K moments to come out of experiment # 518 (Mike's fifth experiment after taking over for Joel).

As far as the movie itself goes, it's all about an annoying and bitter old woman who hires three foreign housekeepers so that she can pick a new body for herself - like most crabby old women, she has her own mad scientist in the basement perfecting the science of brain transplantation.  Yes, it's the weirdest beauty contest of them all, as the old lady ogles and feels up her nubile young charges looking for the perfect new body for her sick little brain.  Miss England wows the audience and judge with a completely ridiculous accent (which seems to come and go quite a bit) and a hip-swaying walking style that only young, healthy hips can hope to survive.  Should she, however, be unable to fulfill her duties for any reason (such as having her eye raked out by a fellow contestant who now thinks she is a cat, for example), the plainer yet passably attractive runner-up will be expected to take her place.  There's basically nothing atomic to see, no brains are presented for our inspection, and the whole thing simply reeks with boredom.

This experiment also features a short called What About Juvenile Delinquency?  There's a lot more action (not to mention extreme close-ups) here than there is in the featured film.  Unfortunately, this is one of those ""What would you do?"" educational films that expect you to actually think about what you have seen - I hate those.  I would much rather watch some punk come to a bad end.  As for host segments and skits, you start off with a special Love Letters reading by Tom and Crow, get to see Mike terrorize the bots with his rather disturbing chin puppet skills, and enjoy the sad and tragic career of Weather Servo Nine!  The real highlight comes when the bots dress up and act like the Mads, then Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank respond in kind (you can imagine what happens when you put TV's Frank's head inside a fishbowl) - now that's entertainment.",1114128000,,2964,4.76171875
926077,5,6304612702,"A lumpy-faced scientist, with the help of a dog-faced associate, chisel their way into vaults and steal corpses...

  Meanwhile, three women from different places across the globe (""all from Nebraska"") try not to get other movie roles by doing their worst accents.  The ""British"" lady is especially funny with her ""jolly"" and her ""bloody 'ell""...Good God, does MST notice this...They pounce on their accents like comedy panthers.  Well done, boys.

  These three women are all going to be housekeepers for an old woman who wants a brain transplant... and lumpy scientist is just the man for the job.

  Things don't go as planned and the scientist is radiated in his own machine...along with a Hot Pocket.

  The old woman is transplanted into a cat intentionally by lumpy so he can have more money to further his work with...naked dead people...

  So the girl is saved, lumpy and the old crazy woman are no more, and the budget for this picture is like an elevator going straight to hell.  Mike and robots are hillarious in this, which had a much needed mocking coming to it.  Great, great stuff.

926078,4,6304612702,"The makers of 'The Atomic Brain' no doubt wanted to create a work of bone-chilling horror. But unfortunately, all they came up with was mind-numbing weirdness. And that makes this fine fodder for Mike and The Bots (M&TB) on the Satellite of Love.
MST3K riffed on a number of failed horror films in its decade of life, and this is a fairly typical example of the genre. It's not so much creepy as queasy, especially with the film's obvious fascination with beautiful and vulnerable young women. As always, M&TB make the most of a bad situation.
As I've noted in some other reviews of MST releases by Rhino, 'The Atomic Brain' is not one of the absolute best MST eps (in my opinion). However, several of the host segments in this episode are worth mentioning, including Mike's chin puppet and The Bots' satire of the Mads in the invention exchange.",1006732800,4,846,4.6466666666666665
926079,5,6304612702,"If you're new to MST3K, then shame on you!  Still, this is a great episode to start off with.  Some of the riffs during the movie are bust-a-gut hilarious (the accents of the actresses alone are enough to send you laughing...ever hear a Southern girl try to talk British??).  The host segments are great, the movie has too many funny moments to count.  Spend the money on this one with no fear!",992908800,,394,4.430555555555555
926080,5,6304612702,"Another great episode of MST3K, although it's not the best of the episodes  that are curently on video.  If you would like a better one, check out  Bloodlust, Mitchell, and Sidehackers.

926081,4,6304612702,"In The Atomic Brain, there is no atomic brain. A terrifically funny one. A woman wants her brain in the body of one of three young girls specially selected. Oh, boy. Not to mention the eating of a live mouse during the  film.",961545600,,225,4.232558139534884
926082,4,6304612702,"An average MST 3K, hillarious in some parts, a little dull in others, but the good parts are worth the 4 stars alone. The main focus of joke-making in this episode is the music and the horrible british accents. A great  episode for MST 3K fans, but if you're new to the show, start with a better  episode.",946425600,,305,4.241379310344827
7877359,2,6304612702,"The main problem with mst3k is the skits where the writing, the sets, the scripts and the acting is as bad as the movies and without the running commentary: ""Atomic Brain"" in spades. The audience would think a movie with that kind of title is a little sci-first but no help to the boys; it's depressing and the actresses' looks and performances are dreary. The educational film is much better but for some reason it isn't miffed on outside the theater.",1501459200,,452,4.592592592592593
7877360,5,6304612702,"THE ATOMIC BRAIN (originally titled MONSTROSITY, 1963) is a very poor picture.  Probably the best thing in it is character actress Marjorie Eaton as Hetty March, the querulous rich old lady confined to a wheelchair (""Tonight, on a very special LADY IRONSIDES,"" riff the bots) who has her doctor procure three young, beautiful women from abroad so that she can pick one to transplant her brain into.  What could go wrong?  Well, plenty, including a cat whose brain gets switched with one of the girl's brains.  Mike and the bots miss none of this, guaranteeing a good time.  To sweeten the pot, a short about Juvenile Delinquency is included.",1487462400,,641,4.844036697247707

7877364,5,6304612702,"One of my favorite mystie episodes. Three beautiful undocumented workers with hilarious  accents come to work for a mean old woman, who already has a mad scientist on payroll. The results are tragic for everyone. There is a brain in the story, but it's not atomic. However (spoiler alert) the home security system, once activated, triggers a nuclear explosion. Probably should have thought that through before they went ahead with it.",1433030400,,434,5.112676056338028
