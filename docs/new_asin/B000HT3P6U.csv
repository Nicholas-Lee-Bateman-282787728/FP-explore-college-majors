2642914,4,B000HT3P6U,"Fine - okay - there, deleted...

What's funny, and ironic as heck - is that for all my ""whining"" you all complained about --- that's all your comments were!  Whining about my ""whining"".

I wasn't even whining! -- obviously, you didn't read closely enough, and between the lines.  I was putting forth questions, ideas, and answering some questions of previous reviewers.

The fact that what I, or anyone else says in these reviews - is taken SO seriously by some of you, is actually frightening!  These are our opinions, we're entitled to them -- and quite honestly, I fought for the right to defend them!

What everyone FAILED to realize (except a small few) was that I was griping about how THE NETWORK decided to divide the series --- and WONDERED, if that would coninue - just to make a buck... THAT'S ALL.  (stating that they don't do it for other shows -- especially shows with fans / fanbases no where near as strong as that of Family Guy).

All you who left comments to my (original) review need to get a freaking life!  Grow up, and certainly don't say ""I want the 3 minutes of my life back you stole"" -- and then waste 5 more minutes, telling me about it!  DUH!",1160524800,26,1170,4.446009389671362
2642915,5,B000HT3P6U,"This is the second part of season 4.

They put seasons 1 and 2 on volume 1.

So i'm guessing thats why they divided this season, so that the rest of the seasons will correspond with the volume. Season 5 on volume 5; Season 6 on volume 6; etc, etc.

i still think its unfair to put one season in two volumes. but im still going to buy it because its a great half a season",1160179200,6,370,3.8421052631578947
2642916,5,B000HT3P6U,Like everyone else I'm going to buy this the day it comes out anyway but I think it's a pretty shameless and shady thing to divide a single season in to two halves and sell them seperatly. Someone please point out a non-monetary reason for doing this. I'm not against people making money but this really is shameless...and not in the funny way.,1160092800,14,344,4.476190476190476

Anyways it should be the rest of Season four minus The Stewie Griffin Untold Movie season finale.

Yes, I will get this DVD since I'm a family Guy fan but Amazon should really fix the title...and call it Family Guy Volume 4 (Season Four).

While those things still hold true with this volume in my book I came to the conclusion that many of the episodes in volume four were too good to pass up, and that the cut-aways are not as overly-used as the previous season/volume. There may only be about 15 eps but most of them are great with few exceptions and I would recommend this to any fan of FG or animated comedy in general.",1341964800,,599,4.454545454545454

2643055,5,B000HT3P6U,"Season four has gotten both rave and bad reviews and mostly for the same reasons.  First of all Family guy is a hilarious poke at pop culture.  There is nothing that is sacred with them as I have reported in previous volumes.  Here the point, people try to read to much into the episodes thus they don't get the simplicity of the jokes, for example people complained about patriot games where Peter is recruited by Tom Brady to play for the Patriots and then traded to the london Silly nillys after to much show boating, Does this sound like anyone we know.  But the secondary story line is even funnier as Brian bets $50 on celebrity boxing with lone shark Stewie and then doesn't pay in time.  The abuse Stewie puts Brian trough is hilarious.  As is every other episode if you don't overthink it.  Look Family guy is what it is and that is Funny!!!!!",1324080000,,852,4.423076923076923

2643069,5,B000HT3P6U,"This is a review for both the Old Boxed Set verison and the new Slim Set version.

VOLUME FOUR IN GENERAL:
Family Guy, Volume Four contains the final 14 episodes of Season Four (Episodes 28-30 are unincluded because they were released as the movie Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story). The features are pretty nice and it includes an uncensored audio track which is optional.

BOXED SET:
The front cover shows a nude Peter (he is revealed on the inside to have pants on) popping out of a cake with the rest of the Griffin clan standing around him in a celebratory manner. The back cover has some nice artwork with the usual description for the set including features and such.
The Inside contains three thin plastic cases for each disc. With artwork of Peter slowly getting out of the cake (by the third cover he has fallen into the cake and splattered it! =D) The backside of these covers contains Episode Titles, their descriptions, airdate, and directors. It also has the bonus material that is included on that disc. For the first time, inside each disc case there is artwork pertaining to the episode ""PTV"" where everything gets censored. Each special inside artwork also has a somewhat funny quote on it.

SLIM SET:
The front and back cover are exactly the same. The slim set doesn't have a boxed set feel. It is just like a normal 2-Disc DVD case, but with an extra spot for disc 3. There's not as much artwork inside anymore and now it is only The Disc Number with Episode Titles that are on each disc. No more airdate and such things. Bonus material is still the same, however.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
If you don't mind having a slim set or you bought the slim set of Volumes 1-3, go ahead and order from amazon.
If you really like the boxed set look better, or already have Volumes 1-3 in boxed sets, look for it on [...]

2643107,5,B000HT3P6U,"Okay, first things first. No, Family Guy isn't The Simpsons, or King Of The Hill, or South Park. Amazon is right in that way. Family Guy is way, way better. I am a Simpson fan, but could never latch onto the other two. Family Guy is a show unlike no other I have seen. Very few shows can have a barrel full of laugh out loud moments in every episode. FG is one of those. After it's cancelation, FG came back stronger, funnier, and pushing the envelope more than ever. This second volume of season 4 episodes hits the mark every time. While The Simpsons is still funny, it can't match the outrageous, over the top lunacy and humor that FG has going. FG is filled with funny, interesting, endearing characters(unlike a Stone/Parker series, which apparently had an episode trying to kill FG off. Jealousy is an ugly thing). This box set is further proof that Seth MacFarlane know funny, and know it's audience. First off, let's go through the special features. The best thing about this set is that there are 5 uncensored episodes here. If Peter or whoever says the ""S"" word or drops the ""F"" bomb, you hear it. Peter Shin shows you how to draw Stewie. Adam West gets a tour of Family Guy central(by Mike Henry), and there is a featurette on directing the show. Now, the episodes themselves. There is a lot to be enjoyed here. ""PTV"" has Peter starting his own network after too much censoring on regular TV. A classic. ""The Fat Guy Strangler"" has Lois's brother visiting and revealing his penchant for stalking the obese. ""You May Know Kiss The..Uh...Guy Who Receives"" is filled with expected jokes about Brian's gay cousin getting married. There is a spoof of 'Poltergeist' in ""Petergeist"", and Brian The Dog heads back to campus in ""Brian Goes Back To College"", while Peter and his crew become the new A-Team. Good stuff. As usual, there are a number of commentaries on episode by cast and crew. The show is quite brilliant in it's execution of razor sharp jokes, pop culture references, and break aways to something that happened or something the characters did. This has always been a strong suit of the show, and it hasn't lost it's edge, or humor. FG continues to surprise me with some of the things they say and do. A lot of the time I can't believe they get away with it, unlike other shows who seem to do these things just for the noticeability factor and forget to factor the ""funny"" in. In the world of Peter Griffin and his brood, things can go on for many more years. Let's hope Fox knows this and keeps Family Guy around for a long time to come.",1177459200,,2555,4.496774193548387

These newer episodes are not nearly as funny as the first two (and even three) seasons. Now it seems as if Seth MacFarlane is struggling to be funny as his comedic stylings are growing dryer with each episode that he releases. I am dissapointed with this season, but am pleased with the entire series as a whole. If you're a big FG fan, go ahead and buy this.

2643128,5,B000HT3P6U,"First things first, one of the reasons I buy DVD boxed sets is for the commentaries.  Some of the early family guy boxed sets where somewhat sketchy in regard to commentaries but this set has every episode covered I think.  The commentaries, like the show itself, are somewhat vulgar and profanity laden but the icing o the cake was when Seth MacFarlane commented that if you don't support gay marriage you are 'Just a fu$^er.'  Really, Seth?  It seems the creator of family guy is a supporter of gay marriage...to the extreme!  Heh heh.  I'm writing that one down.

  Okay, moving on, as with the previous episodes of the show there are plenty of inside jokes and more Star Wars references than you can shake the metaphorical stick at(or the non metaphorical stick if you, I don't know just like shaking a stick at your television) but unlike the previous seasons it is uncensored so you can hear all the uncensored cursing and pg-13 sexiness that you can handle.

Most DVDs are only rented in this household (big Netflix customers, for nearly 3 years now) - but Family Guy is a series that we watch again and again. Its twisted, layered humor is pretty raw and at the same time oddly sophisticated. It is certainly one of the more original cartoon shows out there even if it owes a big nod to ""The Simpsons"" as the one that started it all. Family Guy, however, goes more for the jugular than that series, not shying away from putting any of the family members into scenarios that delight the viewer because nothing is sacred and the darker themes of American society and culture are explored to the fullest. The show is extremely well-cast in terms of its voice talent as their delivery is spot on and the visuals are often absolutely dead-pan and hilarious. The animation medium has become more detailed and realistic, and yet the rather minimalist approach that Family Guy takes proves once more that iconic visuals driven by brilliant writing are more effective than all the other style and flash.",1170374400,,1136,4.68

My main complaint is that they split season 4 into two DVD sets when they could have just as easily made them a single set. My understanding of this has to do with the way the network originally split the season for broadcasting purposes but it's most likely another way to milk profits. The only other thing I'd like to see is an option to play all the episodes that skips the introduction credit sequences which gets old after the first couple times of hearing the theme song.

I won't go further with critiquing the actual show - either you think it's as good as it ever was, or you find the use of ""I haven't...since that time Peter..."" to be less of a comedy device and more of a crutch to hide inability to sustain 22 minutes of either A or B story.  OK, that was a critique.

As I mentioned before, FOX allowed the commentary tracks for all 14 episodes included in this set (in the past, the producers recorded for all episodes, but FOX restricted many of them for some reason).  If you've never listened to the commentaries, do so.  Many times, they go off-book, but it's interesting conversation.  Plus, there are a number of featurettes that are worthwhile.  They aren't all gems though: the tour of the FG offices with guest star Adam West was lame; Adam himself comments that he's already seen all this, as he voices the Mayor in multiple episodes over the course of the series.",1167091200,,1080,4.530927835051546
2643185,4,B000HT3P6U,"This is a good DVD set, I got it like a week after it came out. I noticed a few things, that may not be a big deal to some people, but it will mean a lot to REAL ""Family Guy"" fans like myself. Well, first off, the DVD set says that there is an optional censored track on 5 episodes. There's only 5 optional censored tracks. There should be 5, but in the episode 'Brian Sings and Swings' the part where Meg's teacher shows the sex video that he and his wife made, the teacher asks if anyone wants to watch it, but finally he says: ""Who cares? I wanna see this video of me f**king my wife."" But on the DVD the teacher says: ""Who cares? I wanna see this video of me doing my wife."" And in 'Petergiest' when they meet Carrot Top, Peter says: ""You're soooo f**king funny! F**k you for being so f**king funny!"" On the DVD Peter says: ""You're sooo f**king funny! Goddamn you for being so damn funny!"" Anyway, it may not be a big deal for everyone, but it was for me.",1166227200,,959,4.052631578947368
2643186,4,B000HT3P6U,"Definitely a step down from season three, but still worth it. The second half of this volume is particularly weak for 'Family Guy', but I think most of us can forgive it, as we're well aware that MacFarlane had his new-born baby to groom whilst this season of the show laid way (the spawn being 'American Dad').

The main reason I can't be too hard on the show, even amidst a lot of the mediocrity displayed on the DVD here, is because I really do love it. Even though it has been a powerful catalyst in the ever-growing, obscene nature of modern television, it has always to me remained endearing amongst its perverse humor. And by God, it surely is perverse by this point -- while not as subtly cynical as early 'Simpsons' or outrageously crass as current 'South Park', it finds itself somewhere in between the two. Personally, I really dig this fine line they walk; even though it is a completely desensitized, cruel show, one of the main reasons I always boot it back up is because of how much I love the Griffin family -- the show is edgy, but part of that edge comes in its hidden sentimentality. To again bring up early 'Simpsons' for comparison, 'Family Guy' might lack the overt humanity that involves one beyond the comedic aspects, but it still does captivate somewhat because its characters are so likable. To be more specific, the dynamics between Peter, Brian and Stewie form this bond, and it's not surprising that these just happen to be the three members of the household MacFarlane voices.

One very cool feature is that every episode has a commentary now; the first few 'FG' DVD's only had a few select episodes. Yet, there might as well only have been a few. I only listened to a few commentaries on the discs, but they reflect my thoughts on a lot of 'FG'. The first I listened to was the disturbingly bizarre episode where we dive into the old perverted neighbor's fantasies about Chris, because I figured with such an awfully twisted subject, some interesting thoughts from its creators had to come from it... Nope. At one point, one of the guys says ""people who listen to these must have too much time on their hands; how could anybody listen to one of these?"". He then goes on to declare that the only commentary he's ever listened to was the cast & crew commentary of 'American Pie'........ Need I say more? MacFarlane, at least, attempts to rip him a new @#%h@le on the commentary for saying something as such so shamelessly, but the point is made... A lot of the guys working on this show aren't brilliant -- they're not even that funny; they're not that passionate or respecting of the work, either. If they all had been, the show probably wouldn't float in limbo so much as it does in this DVD -- when one man's dedication is split in two due to outside circumstances ('American Dad' in this case), that of the team should be able to hold the boat above water... But they can't. MacFarlane shouldn't be experimentally improving as much as he can be seen doing here, but you don't really have a choice when you're a one-man army without other creative input (and I don't mean to dismiss a few of the other great minds who DO contribute... something I'm obviously doing to gross effect).

Redemptively, though, there ARE some awesome episodes on this DVD, and enough priceless moments within the collective 13 that I can overlook an enormous amount of jokes that derail completely. Surely Stewie's ""uncontrollable laugh"", as Brian calls it, is one of the funniest things I've -- ever -- seen (and probably one of those MacFarlane-experiments gone beautifully right). Or when Brian, on his first day as a Taxi Cab driver, nervously bypasses his first potential customer because he's black (Cleveland, who, after the fact, roars and rages in Brian's rear view mirror). There are at least two dozen of these individually beyond-hysterical moments, and it becomes a showcase of how the highest highs can completely overshadow long lengths of lows.",1165795200,,3971,4.686246418338109

2643198,4,B000HT3P6U,"There was a time where I would've defended Family Guy has one of the more funnier shows on television. Sure Simpsons has a formula(unrelated first half which leads to the major story) like this show has the cutaways but at least many of them were just outright funny. After they were resurrected from the 8th layer of Hell known as Cancellation, it seemed as if the trip back scared them and now they're just resting on their laurels. Sure there's jokes throughout this season that's funny but many of them don't even have the hilarity they had from previous seasons. This review will center on set highlights:

Set opener ""PTV"" has Peter getting offended by the FCC's control over vulgarity and starts his own TV station filled with it, prompting the FCC to try to censor Peter himself. ""Brian Goes to College"" has him having to of course, go back to school, so he can get his job back at the New Yorker. ""The Father, The Son and the Holy Fonz"" has Peter starting a church dedicated to the Fonz when his dad shows up while Stewie's trapped in a Bubble Boy situation.

""Brian Sings and Swings"" has Brian becoming a hit when he sings with Frank Sinatra Jr only to find himself hitting the bottle hard. Stewie's brother from Emissionary Impossible comes back and they both declare war on each other in ""Sibling Rivalry"". ""D*** Throats""(not sure if they'll censor it so...) has Brian trying to expose Mayor West as a fraud while Peter and Lois try to rekindle their musical days with marijuana.

""Peterotica"" has Peter writing erotic novels but having to help his father-in-law when a lawsuit bankrupts him. ""You May Now Kiss the...Uh... Guy who Receives"" has Jasper trying to marry his boyfriend only West proposes a ban on gay marriage. In a great parody of Poltergeist, ""Petergeist"" has Stewie sucked into the TV when Peter finds a native skull and defiles it.

One of the main selling points of the show was the random cutaways. Phrases like ""this is worse than that time than..."" or ""remember when..."" are very commonplace and they were pretty fun season 3 and before. Now it's as if they're random for the sake of being random. The show has this idea that by the joke's nature it should be funny. An example is Soundwave from Transformers showing up. He actually doesn't make a joke but it's as if just the very idea of Soundwave is supposed to be funny enough. Also the show seems to develop a taste for jokes that go on for too long. Fat guys in ""Fat Guy Strangler"" are featured for quite awhile and the scene itself wasn't even funny to begin with. Then we have Stewie violently going after Brian or barbershop singers singing about sexual harassment: the former was just not funny as a principle while the latter WAS funny until they focused on it excessively.

Now if it sounds like I'm naysaying, I'm not. Many of the scenes were funny but many of the jokes just fell flat, just plain odd or repeated well beyond the funny zone. But if you're into the show, it's worth picking up anyway.",1165017600,5,2996,4.582089552238806
2643199,1,B000HT3P6U,"Seriously, 14 episodes for $30? Why? The original box set came with 28 episodes, on four discs. More episodes per disc than anyone could ever dream of. It was awesome. Don't tell me you still can't pull that off. Want to know why they didn't? Because they can make more money selling 14 episodes for $30 than 28 for $45.

For some reason, perhaps the lay-off after being canned by FOX, the writing went downhill.  Sure, there are some funny monents in these episodes -- Osama's blooper reel comes to mind -- but they are few and far between.  The jokes are mostly tired and the  story lines are frazzled, never meshing like in the past.  Please, don't waste your money -- and don't encourage them to keep putting out tired crap like this.  Sorry.",1164412800,19,599,4.351351351351352
2643202,3,B000HT3P6U,"Family Guy previously won my vote of approval because it made me laugh at the audacity of the characters, all of whom are the prime exemplars of dysfunction.  What I laughed at was the utter incredulousness of it all--that Peter would try to seduce Luke Perry, that Stewie is obsessed with matricide, or just the fact that Brian is an erudite lush of a dog.  Seasons 1-3 were gems for the way they sucked you into that crazed world, but season 4, while sharing some of that charm and caustic humor, tends to fail by pushing the audacity of the characters to senseless levels or by falling on some of their signatures and effectively turning them into schticks.

Disc 1 is brilliant and arguably one of the funniest string of episodes released in the show's career.  Believe it or not, the show's actually one of the smarter animated series for the way it can weave in so many pop culture references and make them funny even if the audience may not know the reference itself.  Episodes like ""PTV"" and ""Brian Goes Back to College"" do this with ease, keeping the laughs rolling incessantly.  But the show loses coherence when you hit the second disc, where the story is thinner than usual, you can see the punch lines coming from a mile away, and they rely repeatedly on gimmicks, most notably the flashback.  One episode, ""Patriot Games,"" I found particularly insipid and (I can't believe I'm saying this) offensive.  Here, Stewie pummels Brian mercilessly in a violent sequence that elicits only horror at the fact that the writers and actors would find the idea even remotely humorous.  The protracted, pornographic violence of the episode combined with the leaden jokes and skits made me actually revile the show.

I haven't kept up with the episodes in season 5, but I hope this DVD release doesn't spell the nadir or (worse yet) the downfall of this series.  Seeing as how it was originally cancelled and resurrected twice before on the power of an enraptured audience, it would be especially sad to see the show die slowly through its own increasing mediocrity.",1163894400,22,2065,4.740223463687151
2643203,5,B000HT3P6U,"Despite what others may have said (critics and peers) about the recent episodes of Family Guy, make no mistake that Seth MacFarlane's animated laugh fest is still hilarious to no end.  The episodes contained in this collection, under the title of Season 4 Part 2, feature the same kind of bawdy lunacy you'd come to expect from the residents of Quahog.  In these episodes, Peter creates his own religion dedicated to the Fonz while Stewie has to live in a plastic bubble after being baptised by tainted holy water (yes, you read that right), Lois decides to stop breast feeding Stewie later on, and Stewie ends up going to war with his just as power hungry brother Bertram (voiced by Wallace Shawn).  Quagmire is in fine form as well in these episodes (giggity!) as well, as he comes close to getting married to a psychotic bride (Nicole Sullivan).  There's plenty of laugh out loud moments, as you would come to expect from the series, and even though by now the joke conventions have worn thin (as they were brilliantly spoofed on South Park), the way that they are weaved into the stories are still nicely done, and still oh so funny.  All in all, love it or hate it, you know what you're getting with Family Guy, and that's as safe a bet as you can ask for.",1163894400,8,1261,4.5131578947368425
2643204,4,B000HT3P6U,"First off, what is with the selection screens?  I have to adjust my television just to read the options!  Anyway, several episodes here are up to the high standards of previous Family Guy seasons.  My favorites are ""PTV,"" ""The Fat Guy Strangler,"" ""Father, Son, and the Holy Fonz,"" and ""You May Now Kiss..."" (Jasper is funny).  Others, however, I found to be mediocre or just plain bad (""Patriot Games"").  There are not as many episodes I want to see over and over as there are on volumes 1-3, but this season is still good enough for 4 stars.  There are a lot of extras on disc 3, too.  44 deleted scenes and you can select all and have them play one after the other (some of these jokes are better than the ones that got left in the shows).  The featurettes are very interesting where many of the directors and artists are interviewed on what all is entailed in putting a show together. Also, these episodes are uncensored (there is an F-Bomb dropped or two) but there is a censored option (isn't it usually the other way around?).  Anyway, here are the episodes:

Disc 1

""PTV"": A wardrobe malfunction involving David Hyde Pierce at the Emmys causes the FCC to censor all tv--""The `bleep' Van `bleep' Show, Starring `bleep' Van `bleep.'  So Peter starts his own network featuring such highbrow programs as ""The Side-Boob Hour"" and ""Dogs Humping.""

""Brian Goes Back to College"":  The New Yorker magazine is interested in Brian as a contributor but requires a college degree.  Brian had dropped out of Brown University. It's strange to think of an animated dog in this way, but I'd always thought Brian was so cool and together.  Hearing him lament about how he never finishes anything put a new spin on his character.

""The Courtship of Stewie's Father"":  Chris works for that disgusting old man who likes young boys while Stewie and Peter bond over something they both enjoy immensely:  terrorizing Lois.  This episode almost makes one sympathize with that old pediaphile (well, almost).

 ""The Fat Guy Strangler"":  My favorite of this volume.  Lois finds out she has a brother who went crazy after seeing their mother having relations with Jackie Gleason (hence his hatred of fat men).  Meanwhile, Peter makes the shocking discovery that he is fat and starts the NAAFP.

""The Father, the Son and the Holy Fonz"":  Peter's father baptizes Stewie with tainted holy water and he has to be quarantined in a plastic bubble.  Meanwhile, Peter starts the church of the Fonz--""Please rise.....Now sit on it.""

Disc 2:

""Brian Sings and Swings"": A near-death experience causes Brian to feel he must live for the moment so he hooks up with Frank Sinatra Jr. as part of the New Rat Pack.  A funnier side story is Meg pretending to be a lesbian to be accepted into a club.

""Patriot Games"":  This has to be the most stupidest Family Guy ever.  Peter meets Tom Brady and joins the New England Patriots (along side Diet Pepsi machine?) but is transferred to a London team for showboating. Meanwhile, Brian fails to pay a debt and Stewie gives him a beat-down mob-style.

""I Take Thee Quagmire"":  Quagmire gets married and soon realizes it was a mistake.  Meanwhile, Lois is weaning Stewie but he finds he is addicted to breast milk.

""Sibling Rivalry"":  Peter donates to a sperm bank and Stewie's rival baby is born (remember ""Emission Impossible""?).  Meanwhile, Peter stops having relations with Lois after his vasectomy and Lois gets fat.  I like that part.  Another highlight: Chris's shoebox diarrhea of the evolution of man.

""Deep Throats"": After getting what he deemed to be an excessively high parking ticket, Brian wants to find dirt on Mayor West and sees him dating his young intern: Meg.

Disc 3

""Peterotica"": First off, that Quagmire stuff in the beginning is very annoying.  Anyway, Peter writes erotic novels and uses Lois's father's name as the publishing company.  When someone gets into a car accident listening to Peter's book on tape (read by Betty White), Mr. Pewterschmidt loses everything and must move in with the Griffins.

""You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives"":  (You get it?  Hahaha).  Brian's gay cousin Jasper plans on marrying his partner but Brian first must fight Mayor Wests' ban on gay marriage.

""Petergeist"":  Peter digs in the yard and finds an Indian skull and weird things start to happen.  Part of the plot is similar to that Simpsons Treehouse of Horrors where a 3D Homer is stuck in another dimension.

""The Griffin Family History"":  The Griffins are stuck in a panic room while their house is being robbed so Peter tells them stories of his ancestors Nate the slave, Willie ""Black-Eyed"" Griffin the silent comedy star, and Peter H*tler who was the brother of...yeah.",1163808000,34,4707,4.793275217932752
2643205,5,B000HT3P6U,"REVIEW: Family Guy is one of the best shows on television. I am a huge fan and am so glad to see how far it has come. I smile every Sunday night because I know Family Guy will be on. I remember when it was cancelled, I remember doing online petitions, I remember sending emails, and I remember sending letters. Yes, Family Guy was that important to me. It was that rare breed of comedy that worked, that was hilarious, it was intelligent, and completely crude. The pop references are absolutely hilarious, and I'm sure everyone loves it when they get a pop reference and their friends don't. So if nothing else, Family Guy makes you feel smart.

This 3 disc set is the second half of season 4 and is labeled as volume 4. In this set we truly have some of the funniest episodes to come from the series. ""Brian Goes Back To College"" is one the best episodes on this set and has some of the series' most quotable lines. Stewie and Brian make a large presence in these episodes and the writing is incredibly sharp. We have an amazing musical number where Peter and the New England Patriots perform ""Shipoopi"" from The Music Man. It truly is pure genius comedy. Fans of the show will snap this one up in no time and will get the most out of the episodes with constant references to the past seasons. Another bonus of this DVD is that there are so many restored scenes that are put back into the episodes that were originally cut due to time constraints.

VIDEO: The difference between before the show got cancelled and after it came back on air is quite notable. The crew utilizes CGI in a few episodes and the image and animation gets better with every episode. The transfer is in 1.33:1 fullscreen and is absolutely as good as it gets when it comes to animation. Colors are sharp with no bleeding, the images are sharp.

AUDIO: In terms of sound we get a really great 5.1 Dolby Digital mix. There are a lot of musical numbers in this volume and they seriously benefit from the surround mix. There is an optional censored audio track for those who are offended by the un-bleeped language.

SPECIAL FEATURES: The highlight of the special features for me were definitely the commentaries. Honestly, I am not a commentary type of guy, I think they are uninvolving. However, I love television series commentaries, and no one gives better commentaries than the cast and crew of Family Guy. Seth MacFarlane gives so much info behind the jokes and the process of making the episodes. The writers and producers such as David Goodman and Mike Henry add lots of stuff too. The great thing about the commentaries are that they are f*cking hilarious. Seth and gang cuss, laugh, sometimes go into character, make fun of each other, yet still provide informative comments. Some episodes also have multi angled sequences to show the animation process in greater depth. On disc three is where you'll find the featurettes. There are over 40 deleted scenes, mostly cutaway and filler stuff, but there were some hilarious scenes. They are also completely finished and animated (lacking music and finished sound effects though), not just pre-visualizations like in previous sets. The ""Director's Life"" featurette is a look at how animation directors do their job and how their jobs differ from live action directors. Seth MacFarlane has nothing but respect for his directors, and this featurette is dedictated to the hard work they do on the show. The next little segment is animator Peter Shin doing a demonstration of how to draw Stewie. The final featurette is a behind the scenes look at the Family Guy offices. Adam West is toured through the offices by Mike Henry and we get to meet some of the great people behind the scenes, it's fun and entertaining. Overall, this set offers a great amount of new content that is on par with the past sets.

BOTTOM LINE: Family Guy will make you laugh loud and hard. It is truly the smartest and funniest animated show to grace television. The fact that it was cancelled still boggles me, but we fans brought it back and I'm so happy we did all that we did. I continue to me amazed by the sharp writing and smart references that the show has in each episode. Truly a must buy.",1163635200,41,4195,4.595460614152203

Basicly it is always getting better. I plan on pre-ordering this season as soon as I am done with this review. And the pricing for this season is reasonable in my opinion. I mean really 25 bucks is nothing compared to some other outragous prices I've seen. You know if you like the show then buy it. Buying every season hasn't failed me yet and I don't expect it to either.

Perhaps they were worried that the first half of season 4 was all they would get before they were canceled again? You never know. You can't immediately judge their actions. There are reasons for everything.",1161820800,9,468,4.517647058823529

2643227,5,B000HT3P6U,"If you like the show, buy it.  If you can't afford it, don't buy it.  If Fox wants to sell 3 episodes for 120 bucks, who cares?  Why do people complain so much when the very thing they complain about is what brings them pleasure?  I mean, come on... it's a CARTOON!  So I guess if you can't save your money and buy it when you can afford it, you will stomp your feet and resort to stealing.  Its clear Fox has met their match, but just in case they don't feel like giving in to your demands... you might want to start saving your money now for the next season.",1160870400,8,560,4.0
