8170166,5,B000EYK4BW,"Really enjoy the butt and thigh workout, abs and arms and stretch part too. it is a four part video, the hiphop part is hard to follow but the other three sections are GREAT",1395100800,,173,4.117647058823529
8170167,1,B000EYK4BW,"I got this thinking it was a hip hop type workout that would really get my heart rate up. I did all 4 workouts (which are maybe 10 minutes each) and I didn't even break a sweat, and I definitely didn't get my heart rate up. So if you are looking for a workout, don't get this",1297468800,,275,3.8421052631578947
8170168,1,B000EYK4BW,"Completely disappointing. The mustachioed Carlos Llanos leads about 15 people through the same routine from the warmup about 1000 times.

The warmup acts as a primer/foundation where the steps for the workout are taught and mastered. The music is great. It lulls you into false hope.
Once the cardio begins you wonder if your DVD is broken. It's the exact same thing as the warmup. It is agonizing getting through it because everything is re-taught as if the warmup didn't exist at all. In addition, in between each repetition of the same routine there is an absurd amount of pointless marching. Due to this marching, it was impossible to keep up a good heart rate.

The moves had great promise and the music was great. But even the dancers seemed bored, and I lost interest completely. It's cheap, but you get what you pay for.",1297209600,,828,4.703448275862069
