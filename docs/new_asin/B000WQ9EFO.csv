2989267,4,B000WQ9EFO,"I really enjoyed the show when I was younger and ordered it out of nostalgia.

For the era, the comedy was new and very edgy.  Some great young talent was introduced such as Jim Carrey (billed as James Carrey), Jamie Foxx, almost the entire Wayons family, and David Alan Grier.

The down side is that, while the attitudes towards some of the subject matter is pretty over-the-top (depending on one's point of view) and clearly are sarcastic, there is the constant referral to ""The Man"" as being the sterotyped rich white person who oppressed the minorities on the show.  For very impressionable youths of the time, that message got a weekly dose of reinforcement. Having grown up as a poor white kid, ""The Man"" put everyone down, and not just confined to minorities.

Enjoy it for the visual gags and skits as a whole.",1216857600,2,818,4.652777777777778

  In Living Color You Can Do What You Want to Do

  by

Mark Walter Meredith

  Therefore, In Living Color the Series is back on TV, Eleven oclock Central, twelve oclock Eastern.  Now I have always had a problem with this show.  Once at a newspaper I used to work at on this newspaper writing stint I did for about 10 years on and off (mostly off) a certain young woman was going to write an article about it.  In addition, I expected her to do the subject justice.
  Nevertheless, when the article came out it was short and I was disappointed to find whom it barely scratched the surface.  She had not written down any of the things I had suggested she write about.  I guess she had waited until the last minute like everyone else (besides me.  Of course) and then slapped everything down fast into her article as quickly as possible in a mad slap dash manner.
  What makes it all worse is whom the common-senseless people above me put the title of the article directly under my three-panel cartoon, Stereotypes are Not Funny. close to nothing else.  Making it look like they were making some example of the cartoon strip.
  Now Damon Wayans used to be disabled himself (he used to wear an orthopedic shoe. One with a thick sole) but I don't think its fair for him to make fun of handicapped people.  His handicapped superhero with the clubbed-like wing-like right arm and slurred manner of speech is offensive; also the handicapped heros weakness.  His own form of kryptonite that Wayans named after disabled people.
  Ive seen and Oprah show the other day about how people call each other names in high school.  About how white kids will even, call African American kids the n-word unprovoked and I think I know where it all started.  From Michael Richards the show Your Momma.  To films to whatever stuff, I might have missed.
  It all starts with In Living Color.  Keenan Ivory Wayans whom put up the money for the show and came up with the show has a concept.  Make fun of everybody else and there will be no more people treated differently.  Whose idea seems to have exploded in his face?
  Here is a sample of the lyrics of the shows beginning song,
In Living Color
  You can do what you want to do
In living color
In living color
You can do what you want to do
  In living color
You can go to the moon
  Float like a balloon
  Its never too late
  Moreover, its never too soon
  Take it from me its tight to be
  In living color
Moreover, how would you feel knowing whom prejudice is obsolete?
Moreover, humankind danced to a new beat
Moreover, at night it was safe to walk down
The street
  In living color
  You could do what you want to do in living color.

  I don't want to see disabled people with their heads bashed in on the sidewalks and people bragging about how they were bashing their heads in while cracking jokes like Spider-Man.

IF you can get over the fact that there have been edits to the DVDs with the missing music videos cut completely and other skits edited (especially the super bowl special), then you can enjoy this. For someone whose enjoyment nostalgia is ruined by the cheapskates who refuse to pay copyrights for the parodies and to let us enjoy the raw humor that defined this magnificent series, I can't enjoy it as much as I wish I did.

Otherwise, this is okay for now.",1267833600,124,720,4.488549618320611
2989335,4,B000WQ9EFO,"The series is from the early 1990's so i wonder if many younger people will appreciate the jokes. Comical quips about reagan, bush sr., exxon valdez, etcetera.

the comedy is rather raw, meaning the show was fundamentally built around making something funny, not politically correct.

sadly that and copyrights butchered the series.

the musical performances at the end of the show are on the disc, but i can't remember enough of the show to tell what else is missing.

a quick wiki look and online search can answer far better than i, but i will say that one of the funniest sketches was demolished. there is a sketch called men on film.
that skit is about two homosexual men reviewing various things, and in this case, they are commenting on a super bowl game during half time. the performance was done live and was extremely funny, but offensive to some celebrities. it also grabbed a HUGE, in the double digits of millions huge amount of viewers from the super bowls own half time show.
now what's left is still funny, but lacking the omg, he didn't just say that moments.

basically for anyone with a good memory and old enough to remember 1980-1990ish pop culture should be able to appreciate the jokes. best way to discern if this series is for you is to look on youtube or some other online video site and view some of the clips of this shows work.

i believe without this television series, shows like madtv could not have come around. this show even has the prototype vancome lady.
i'll also warn people that this show isn't overly friendly to the caucasian populace. as someone who was raised in the similar areas and double standards as the waynes brothers i can understand and laugh at some of the jokes about whitey/the man and what not, but i have met some people who are out right insulted by the jokes and considered them racially prejudiced. the show does ridicule many races but even kenan (the producer) even admits they focused on whites. therefore if whoever is reading this is white and can't take a joke, don't bother buying this series. luckily my caramel butt can laugh at all the stupidity from every race.

finally, this complaint isn't serious as it is just a minor peeve of mine, but the theme song becomes quite annoying after a few episodes (or sooner), so if you don't like it, keep the remote close. sadly too, the skip chapter buttons don't automatically go from one skit to the next, sometimes the skip buttons will cross over 2 or more sketches at a time.

**************EDIT************************

3223764,4,B000WQ9EFO,"I really enjoyed the show when I was younger and ordered it out of nostalgia.

For the era, the comedy was new and very edgy.  Some great young talent was introduced such as Jim Carrey (billed as James Carrey), Jamie Foxx, almost the entire Wayons family, and David Alan Grier.

The down side is that, while the attitudes towards some of the subject matter is pretty over-the-top (depending on one's point of view) and clearly are sarcastic, there is the constant referral to ""The Man"" as being the sterotyped rich white person who oppressed the minorities on the show.  For very impressionable youths of the time, that message got a weekly dose of reinforcement. Having grown up as a poor white kid, ""The Man"" put everyone down, and not just confined to minorities.

  In Living Color You Can Do What You Want to Do

  by

Mark Walter Meredith

  Therefore, In Living Color the Series is back on TV, Eleven oclock Central, twelve oclock Eastern.  Now I have always had a problem with this show.  Once at a newspaper I used to work at on this newspaper writing stint I did for about 10 years on and off (mostly off) a certain young woman was going to write an article about it.  In addition, I expected her to do the subject justice.
  Nevertheless, when the article came out it was short and I was disappointed to find whom it barely scratched the surface.  She had not written down any of the things I had suggested she write about.  I guess she had waited until the last minute like everyone else (besides me.  Of course) and then slapped everything down fast into her article as quickly as possible in a mad slap dash manner.
  What makes it all worse is whom the common-senseless people above me put the title of the article directly under my three-panel cartoon, Stereotypes are Not Funny. close to nothing else.  Making it look like they were making some example of the cartoon strip.
  Now Damon Wayans used to be disabled himself (he used to wear an orthopedic shoe. One with a thick sole) but I don't think its fair for him to make fun of handicapped people.  His handicapped superhero with the clubbed-like wing-like right arm and slurred manner of speech is offensive; also the handicapped heros weakness.  His own form of kryptonite that Wayans named after disabled people.
  Ive seen and Oprah show the other day about how people call each other names in high school.  About how white kids will even, call African American kids the n-word unprovoked and I think I know where it all started.  From Michael Richards the show Your Momma.  To films to whatever stuff, I might have missed.
  It all starts with In Living Color.  Keenan Ivory Wayans whom put up the money for the show and came up with the show has a concept.  Make fun of everybody else and there will be no more people treated differently.  Whose idea seems to have exploded in his face?
  Here is a sample of the lyrics of the shows beginning song,
In Living Color
  You can do what you want to do
In living color
In living color
You can do what you want to do
  In living color
You can go to the moon
  Float like a balloon
  Its never too late
  Moreover, its never too soon
  Take it from me its tight to be
  In living color
Moreover, how would you feel knowing whom prejudice is obsolete?
Moreover, humankind danced to a new beat
Moreover, at night it was safe to walk down
The street
  In living color
  You could do what you want to do in living color.

  I don't want to see disabled people with their heads bashed in on the sidewalks and people bragging about how they were bashing their heads in while cracking jokes like Spider-Man.

IF you can get over the fact that there have been edits to the DVDs with the missing music videos cut completely and other skits edited (especially the super bowl special), then you can enjoy this. For someone whose enjoyment nostalgia is ruined by the cheapskates who refuse to pay copyrights for the parodies and to let us enjoy the raw humor that defined this magnificent series, I can't enjoy it as much as I wish I did.

Otherwise, this is okay for now.",1267833600,124,720,4.488549618320611
3223832,4,B000WQ9EFO,"The series is from the early 1990's so i wonder if many younger people will appreciate the jokes. Comical quips about reagan, bush sr., exxon valdez, etcetera.

the comedy is rather raw, meaning the show was fundamentally built around making something funny, not politically correct.

sadly that and copyrights butchered the series.

the musical performances at the end of the show are on the disc, but i can't remember enough of the show to tell what else is missing.

a quick wiki look and online search can answer far better than i, but i will say that one of the funniest sketches was demolished. there is a sketch called men on film.
that skit is about two homosexual men reviewing various things, and in this case, they are commenting on a super bowl game during half time. the performance was done live and was extremely funny, but offensive to some celebrities. it also grabbed a HUGE, in the double digits of millions huge amount of viewers from the super bowls own half time show.
now what's left is still funny, but lacking the omg, he didn't just say that moments.

basically for anyone with a good memory and old enough to remember 1980-1990ish pop culture should be able to appreciate the jokes. best way to discern if this series is for you is to look on youtube or some other online video site and view some of the clips of this shows work.

i believe without this television series, shows like madtv could not have come around. this show even has the prototype vancome lady.
i'll also warn people that this show isn't overly friendly to the caucasian populace. as someone who was raised in the similar areas and double standards as the waynes brothers i can understand and laugh at some of the jokes about whitey/the man and what not, but i have met some people who are out right insulted by the jokes and considered them racially prejudiced. the show does ridicule many races but even kenan (the producer) even admits they focused on whites. therefore if whoever is reading this is white and can't take a joke, don't bother buying this series. luckily my caramel butt can laugh at all the stupidity from every race.

finally, this complaint isn't serious as it is just a minor peeve of mine, but the theme song becomes quite annoying after a few episodes (or sooner), so if you don't like it, keep the remote close. sadly too, the skip chapter buttons don't automatically go from one skit to the next, sometimes the skip buttons will cross over 2 or more sketches at a time.

The few sketches I remember that are missing include:

-Billy Dee Williams date rape sketch.

8225161,4,B000WQ9EFO,"Great box set! I still remember the sketches, but I will admit that some of the jokes may be hard to catch if you weren't around in the 90's. Then again, would you be looking for this show if that were the case? Anyway, since I don't explicitly remember the music acts, I have enjoyed this box set in its current state.

BTW, some of the DVD boxes have a cover sheet over the actual box. I am mentioning this because I was about to send the DVDs back since it looked like the oil stains were on the actual boxes. However, the stains were actually damage to the cover sheet caused by the glue. When you remove the cover sheet, the actual box will be absolutely fine underneath. If you had/have the same issue, I hope that my description makes sense.",1483315200,,748,4.267605633802817
