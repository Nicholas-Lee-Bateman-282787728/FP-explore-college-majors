2331572,1,B0009X3LWM,"One DVD would not play..the second DVD played for 10 minutes and quit!! The problem is..who has the time to wrap them up and send them back? Even if I wanted to do that they came from 2 different independent sellers, I did not keep track of who they are..more research would probably give me the answer to this but this should not have happened, not 2 out of 2.",1299542400,2,361,4.171428571428572
2331573,5,B0009X3LWM,"This dvd is outstanding. It is the 2nd half of a terrific collaboration
between some of the greatest country artist/songwriters of all time.
From Willie Nelson to Bobby Bare,Gene Watson to B.J.Thomas and with
Barbara Fairchild/Janie Fricke it was a joy to watch and listen to. They
sing all great songs and tell many stories from their past. Well worth
the time & money. And Vol 1 is just as good.",1281916800,10,397,4.605633802816901
