Then it's on to Nikola Tesla and the tragic story of his inventions being dominated by Wall Street moguls and other powerful industry men of the time. This is what I liked about Radio Wars. It mixed a bit of humor in with a very serious side of radio. One minute we see the inventor of FM dancing with success, and then we learn he put on his best coat and jumped out of his 4 story office window because the president of RCA basically ripped off his ideas. The contrasts are amazing and I had no idea that each period of radio over the past 100 years was so dramatic.",1354406400,2,700,4.231343283582089
