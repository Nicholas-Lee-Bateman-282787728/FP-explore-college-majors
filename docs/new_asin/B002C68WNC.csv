Loved the extra's also very much.",1257033600,,74,4.0
3903980,5,B002C68WNC,"Cyd Serman (Felicia Day) is an online gamer, who goes by the name Codex. Her own therapist has dumped her, telling her she spends way too much time online. But when an online friend shows up at her door, mistaking cyber flirting for the real thing, Codex decides to enlist the help of the Guild. And gets them to all meet in the real world.

Felicia Day created and stars in this comedy series created for the internet. Each short webisode begins with Codex talking to the camera, as her video blog, then transitioning to her experiences with her Guild friends and the real world. Hilarity ensues. Codex and her geeky Guild spend so much time in their online game, that interactions in the real world are often skewed. Besides the clever dialog, the casting was perfect for each character.  Felicia's Codex is sweet and completely loveable. Sandeep Parikh plays Zaboo, the young man who shows up at Codex's house and mistakenly believes that he has a real relationship with her. Vincent Caso is Bladezz, a young teen who hits on all of the female Guildmembers. Jeff Lewis plays Vork, the Guild leader who takes his job way too seriously. Robin Thorsen is Clara, an extremely irresponsible stay-at-home mom. And Amy Okuda plays Tink, a spoiled girl who would rather not interact with the rest of the Guild, unless she happens to find it amusing.

""The Guild"" is a fast and funny web series that is enjoyable for more than just gamers. Anyone who spends a little too much time online will be able to relate in some ways, and enjoy the wacky and sometimes self-deprecating humor throughout. The DVD set offers up great special features as well, such as several gag reels for both seasons. Fans have the option of watching the seasons online still, but the DVD offers exclusive bonus materials. I had never been a fan of web series, besides ""Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog."" But I'm now hooked on ""The Guild.""

- Special Insert: Gaming Glossary and Note from Felicia Day
- Cast and Crew Interviews

3903981,5,B002C68WNC,"This webseries is made of ABSOLUTE WIN and awesome sauce. But it....NOW! You will love it if you are a gamer. Even if you aren't a gamer, you can still appreciate it. Its fun for all!",1255996800,,183,4.111111111111111
3903982,5,B002C68WNC,"Slackers and fellow nerds, stand up. Or, like, whatever. Technology keeps on marchin', and now we even got web serial shows hitting it up big. Cutie-pie actress and self-avowed avid World of Warcraft gamer Felicia Day created, writes, produces, and stars in THE GUILD, a series focusing on a pretty pathetic bunch of online gamers. It's par for the course that these cats spend an unholy amount of awake time logged on to their game, ""The Knights of Good,"" to the exclusion of pretty much everything else. But then real life barges in.

Felicia Day is ""Codex"" - which is the guild code name of our heroine Cyd Sherman - and Codex is a bit of a sad sack. She's just lost her job and her boyfriend. Her therapist just now broke up with her. And, responding to a knock on her door, Cyd has a face to face with her creepy but genial stalker Zaboo, who just happens to be a fellow gamer in her guild. Zaboo mistakes online flirting with Codex for honest romance, and he quickly becomes a house guest who won't leave. Thing is, Codex prefers her fellow questers where they are, online and not in the same room. However, in trying to cope with Zaboo's intrusion, she hits on the notion of having the guild members meet in person. Uh-oh.

Coming from a non-gamer's perspective, I find THE GUILD to be hugely entertaining stuff. Let's face it, most of us are at least a little bit like these hapless folks, and it's this commonality which keeps me tuning in and it's what made me snatch up this DVD. Felicia Day has mad skills. She's outstanding as the sweet, very insecure Codex, and she can't really be given enough props for juggling all the hats she has to wear to keep this show going. An accomplished violinist, Felicia even rocks the bow and strings in Season 2. The cast is comprised of no-name actors and Felicia's buds from her improv days - Jeff Lewis (the always deadpanned ""Vork"") and Sandeep Parikh (""Zaboo,"" a Hinjew) are friggin' hilarious. That the cast comes together like this and consistently produces these bits of awesome... well, it's a triumph for the underdog and the underbudgeted. Fact is, THE GUILD wouldn't have survived if the fans hadn't dropped in their donations; that's how strapped the show was. Felicia Day launches each episode with an entry from Codex's video log, which not only gives us even more of a window into her character but also cements her even further as the show's core character. Personally, I dig these v-logs because this is when Felicia comes up with her best facial expressions. She's so cute, man.

THE GUILD is a web sitcom, its recipe touching on themes of alienation, loneliness, obsessiveness, and sheer social discomfort. And, it turns out, when done right, these themes make you laugh. I'm not a gamer and so some of the gaming jargon zipped by over my head, but I still found plenty of relatable things (although, okay, I'm pretty horrified at how badly Clara neglects her kids - it's one of those ""laugh as you cringe"" deals). It's cute how the Guild members become each other's unlikely support system, on- and offline. Even Clara, who spends most of Season 2 crazy hammered, tries to fit in.

All 22 webisodes from Seasons 1 & 2 are here. Disc 1 has the first season webisodes and the following bonus stuff: 2 optional audio commentaries for each Season 1 webisode (one with the cast, the other with director/producer Jane Selle Morgan for episodes 1-5, producer Kim Evey, and director Greg Benson popping up from episode 6 on); cast interviews; audition footage with Vincent Caso (""Bladezz""), Robin Thorsen (""Clara""), and Amy Okuda (""Tinkerballa""); Season 1 gag reels; a Christmas Carol video; and the Season 1 script (PC downloadable as a PDF file). Word to the wise, the best bonus segments are the outtakes.

Disc 2 has Season 2, in which we get to know the Guild even better (especially Vork) as they interact with each other even more, and Codex sort of gets an outside life. There are also server shutdown woes and a betrayal from within and a cautionary tale about why you shouldn't ever leave your valuable stuff on a sofa. Also, the very hot, very tall Riley enters the picture, as well as that annoying movie stunt double. Bonus stuff on Disc 2: two commentaries, one with the cast, the other with Felicia Day, producer Kim Evey, and director Sean Becker; Meet the Cast & the Crew & the Extras; more cool gag reels; Season 2's Episode One table read as the cast munches pizza; ""Twas the Night Before Xmas"" (the Guild version); audition footage of Fernando Chien trying out for the role of ""Wade Wei"" & Michele Boyd going for the role of ""Riley"" (with some great ad-lib stuff with Sandeep Parikh); some fan art (meh); and the Season 2 script (PC downloadable as a .PDF file). Lastly, the DVD case comes with a warm thank you note from Felicia to the fans, a graceful finishing touch to this highly watchable labor of love.",1255737600,8,4890,4.635524798154556
3903983,5,B002C68WNC,"I am a gamer too, and this is not representative of all MMO gamers but there are definitely some like it. All likable characters with just some quirks. I do know some people that don't care for it saying it stereotypes gamers but I think it just strikes too close to home. And the dvd quality is way over net quality.",1255219200,,317,4.213114754098361
3903984,5,B002C68WNC,"Originally released as two separate DVDs, Amazon is now selling both seasons in one package for a delicious price that's hard to pass up.  Like I originally wrote in my review of Season One, it's amazing that we're even able to write reviews here at Amazon for this awesome web series.  Consider the first season which was funded by creator and actress Felicia Day with donations/help from the audience and consider how unlikely such a collaboration is.  It's amazing that the show has become such a hit, spawning additional seasons and a more mainstream acceptance. In an ideal world, it shouldn't be surprising, since it's probably one of the funniest and heartfelt shows I've seen on either the web or TV.

Stepping back a bit, The Guild is a show about...well, an online guild of friends who live in the local area but only know each other through their online alter-egos. Cyd/Codex (Felicia Day) is struggling with what appears to be an addiction to their current MMO, dealing with a psychiatrist who ""breaks up with her"" and a gnome warlock who shows up at her front door, thinking they are romantically involved.  As the first season continues, we're brought into this zany world of Codex's and all of the great characters who rely on stereotypes, but also represent some people gamers might know.

What works for The Guild is the fact that the characters are so vivid and played pitch perfectly by the entire cast. Yes, they verge on walking stereotypes, but the hilartiy and the love for these people (some of the kinds of people I know personally) gives the show a much needed heart. What's great is that, while a gaming geek will get the most enjoyment out of the show, I have shown this to friends who think gaming is limited to Rock Band and they, too, kept coming back, week after week, to watch it.

Season 2 begins pretty much right where Season 1 ends. Codex talks to her webcam, summarizing the events that happened after the first Season. The story that follows deals mostly with a server outage for their game, forcing the members of the Knights of Good to deal with the real world. What makes the second season so much better than the already excellent first is that, now that we've been introduced to the characters, they can be given room to grow. Much more character development is given in this season and the show allows each character to have their individual storylines and key moments, splitting screen time a bit more evenly. The witty writing and the hilarious situations that arise are still here, except I found this season even more humorous than the first.

The story climaxes with a bittersweet cliffhanger of an ending. So it's a good thing that Season Three has already started (you can view it on Xbox Live and MSN). If you haven't given The Guild a chance, this set is the best way of doing it.  While I wish it were in HD, like on Xbox Live, this is a terrific package.  It's hilarious, witty and a perfect celebration of MMO geek lifestyle, but it can also be appreciated by people who have no knowledge of the lifestyle. It's the rare beast that can cater to both the culture and those not in it and The Guild nails it perfectly.",1253577600,24,3172,4.608156028368795
3903985,5,B002C68WNC,"If you don't own THE GUILD, you need to. But don't get the individual season discs; get this one! It contains the entirety of the wonderful online series. If you haven't see this great online show, you need to understand that that each season is less than an hour in length, with each episode lasting around four to six minutes.  But what it lacks in quantity it makes up with in quality.  It is not just that the disc collecting both seasons is cheaper, it is more convenient.  No switching of discs.  And I don't know about you, but my DVD shelves are getting incredibly tight.  A single case instead of two is something that I really appreciate.

THE GUILD is one of the most successful direct-to-Internet series yet produced. It was created and is written by and stars Felecia Day, who starred, along with Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion, in what is by far the most successful Internet-first project ever, DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG. The series concerns a group of people who would normally have nothing to do with one another, but have been drawn together by playing World of Warcraft together. For though who have never played WoW (I suppose such individuals exist), one of the things that you can do in WoW is form guilds who quest together. From personal experience I can attest that you end up forming online friendships with people you normally would not spend much time with. If you have played WoW, the show has lots of subtleties that will seem familiar and fun. I've intentionally avoided meeting anyone that I play online with, but these poor souls decide to meet in person. (Though I never join guilds for person reasons. I detest PvP [Player versus Player] and WoW is structured so that if one member of a guild fights a member of another guild, all members of each guild are thereby opposed to one another. Since I could not find a way to be a member of a guild and not PvP, I played solo, which luckily isn't that hard to do in WoW. BTW, I stopped playing WoW after maxing out several characters because of the staggering amount of time that gaming can absorb. Never going to get that book written playing WoW.)

The Guild consists of: Codex (her online name), played by Felecia Day; Zaboo, a Hinjew (half Indian/half Jewish) who stalks Codex; Vork, an early middle-aged loser who lives in his dead grandfather's house (he lives off cashing his granddad's social security checks, and who is also a world-class tightwad and the titular head of the guild); Clara, the mother of three toddlers that she neglects to play online; Tinkerballa, a cute Asian girl who is so obsessed with gaming that she plays Gameboy while also playing WoW; and Bladezz, a long-haired teen who is not the most popular character on the show in Season One. This exceedingly odd collection of individuals unhappily linked with one another provides a host of funny moments that shouldn't be missed.

Felecia Day has pretty much established herself as the hottest female actress on the Internet. Though many knew her from her Season Seven appearance on BUFFY as one of the Potentials, most of her work has been away from either film or television. DR. HORRIBLE made her on online star, a status that was quickly reinforced by the beginning of THE GUILD. She also starred in the great, though unaired episode of DOLLHOUSE ""Epitaph One,"" which many regard as the best episode of DOLLHOUSE. But again, unless you watch it on DVD, you won't see it at all. Most recently she has become even more popular due to a music video based on THE GUILD ""going viral."" If you haven't seen ""Would You Like to Date My Avatar?"" do so immediately. Starring Day and the rest of the cast of THE GUILD, with music written by Jed Whedon (the brother of Joss), it is a delightful send up of online socializing. The song is infectious, the performances delightful, and the lyrics witty. And it completes the whole DR. HORRIBLE-""Epitaph One,"" and music video trilogy. Jed Whedon co-wrote DR. HORRIBLE and ""Epitaph One"" with his wife Maurissa Tancharoen, and Maurissa is one of the performing dancers in the music video (she is one of the female dancers who back up Tinkerballa). And Felecia Day starred in all three. She is so adorable that I'd love to see her translate her online and DVD success to film and TV. Until then, we have this delightful online series. Do yourself a favor and get this disc that collects both seasons of THE GUILD.",1253318400,4,4418,4.662387676508344
3903986,5,B002C68WNC,"How to describe The Guild...The Guild primarily follows the lives (in and out of game) of 6 mmo players. Although the premise of the story is set around the mmo and the guild known as ""The Knights of Good"" who stand for all things...good, what it really comes down to is the relationships and the inner workings of the group dynamic. What makes it great is you don't have to be that familiar with mmos in order to understand what is going on, although some things are a little easier if you are.

The Guild stars Felicia Day(Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog, Epitaph One - Dollhouse, ect.)who plays Codex, the core/heart of the guild , Sandeep Parikh (Legend of Neil)aka Zaboo, the most lovable stalker (cyber and literal) anyone could ever interact with/meet , Jeff Lewis (who has had numerous guest roles over the past decade)aka Vork the old guy of the group and rigid rule bound guild leader.

Also included in the cast are Robin Thorsen who plays Clara (real name Clara)the ditsy negligent mother, Amy Okuda aka Tinkerballa who is the princess/ice queen that Disney would never write a story around, and Vincent Caso, the renegade guildie who just can't stay out of trouble who goes by the name of Bladezz.

The cast and crew of The Guild makes the most of an extremely limited budget and yet it never feels like they are cutting corners where it matters most. Superb dialogue, and in season two great stunt work. This show is a testament to what can be done on the internet and has helped to pave the way for web content for years to come.

Based solely on the bonus content on the original season one and two dvd releases I can assure you that this is a bargain that you can't pass up. Buy the dvd and help to support the show, which has just begun on its 3rd season and shows many good things yet to come. If you're unsure, just go find the ""Do You Wanna Date My Avatar"" video. If you still don't want to buy it after watching that then apparently you have no pulse and the zombies ate your brains (Shout out to Jonathan Coulton, Re: Your Brains).",1252713600,55,2053,4.437665782493369

3903997,5,B002C68WNC,"The top-rated reviews already discuss the important information about the show itself, so I'm bypassing all of that with a simple statement: this show is fantastic.  The show is freely available on YouTube, though, so why buy the DVD?  Aside from the obvious fact that you can watch it when all power goes out and your computer or portable DVD player only has a few hours of battery left, so you want to suck as much enjoyment out of those hours as possible before a Revolution-style apocalypse occurs, this is worth purchasing simply for the bonus material.

Most cast and director commentaries on DVDs feel condescending at worst and somewhat informative at best.  With The Guild, however, the cast commentary feels more low-key and comfortable, is witty and charming, is nearly as funny as the show itself (which is saying a lot), and is worth watching multiple times.  The director commentary (a separate set of tracks) is, of course, informative, but instead of the usual ""this is what we did and this is why it was so much better than anything else anyone has ever done!"" it's filled with humorous information, heartfelt gratitude to the fans, and insights into the creative process.  Finally, the deleted scenes.  I won't spoil the awesomeness for you, but if I ever meet Jeff Lewis, Sandeep Parikh, or Felicia Day in person, I probably won't be able to stop laughing because of my recollections of those scenes.

The series is over now, with the conclusion of the sixth season, but even though The Guild matured and became increasingly polished and consistent as it went on, some of the most absolutely hilarious moments are in this DVD set.  Get to Sandeep's face-smashing and magic carpet scenes, and if you're not laughing at the end of this the only possible explanation is that CBS ""comedies"" and reality TV have permanently destroyed your sense of humor.

And that is only the setup for ""The Guild Seasons 1 and 2,"" a hilariously geeky webseries that follows the misadventures of a bunch of RPG geeks in their offline lives. Everything about this series is mind-blowingly funny -- the actors, the scripting, and the many troubles that these nerds encounter in their lives (ranging from an angry Hinjew mom to a cosmetic orb).

In the first season, Codex (Felicia Day) is horrified when her fellow guild member Zaboo (Sandeep Parikh) shows up at her door, and declares his undying love for her. Having nowhere else to go, he ends up living on Codex's couch, even as Codex struggles with Zaboo's hostile mother. Will Codex be able to get rid of Zaboo without relinquishing him to the iron grip of his mom?

Meanwhile, the lecherous teen Bladezz (Vincent Caso) causes unrest in the group, causing Guild leader Vork (Jeff Lewis) to talk about the possibility of kicking him out. But it turns out that Bladezz has some clout with the group, no matter what

The second season has Codex and Zaboo finding a new apartment, since Zaboo's mom got her evicted. But her apartment comes with a bonus: a sexy stuntman that Codex desperately wants to impress. At the same time, she manages to unload Zaboo on Vork as his new roommate, and Tinkerballa (Amy Okuda) uses her feminine charms to get stuff from Bladezz.

Then the Guild is hit by a terrifying threat: four hours of server downtime! How will they cope with four hours of the real world? One word: PARTY. Several words: wild party that will involve fighting, kissing and betrayal.

""The Guild: Seasons 1 & 2"" is one of those webseries that shows why conventional TV output is going the way of the dodo. This show is head-and-shoulders above bad sitcoms and reality TV -- excellent writing, hilarious running jokes, weird characters and jokes centering on the social misfits who are united by RPG gaming. It doesn't care that it's a niche series.

Most of the humor stems from the characters' personalities and their total lack of normal social lives (""You have the maternal instincts of a wood-chipper!""). There's a bunch of running gags that wind their way through each season, leading up to a climactic battle with whatever is threatening the Knights of Good. It may be a sexy stuntman, or it may be an aging Indian woman with glowing eyes.

And the actors do brilliant jobs as the shy neurotic Codex, neglectful mom Clara, lewd teen Bladezz, smothering stalkery Zaboo, cold cruel Tink and ""old lady with a penis"" Vork. They range from merely strange to outright insane (Vork has a ROOM FULL OF GARBAGE), and almost every line wrings some humor from SOMETHING -- one example would be the running joke about Codex's gay ex-boyfriend, whose cello she set on fire.

""The Guild: Seasons 1 & 2"" ends up being like M&Ms -- each episode is small, but you just won't stop until you've run out of them. Addictive, insanely funny, and well worth watching.",1330041600,,3132,4.669691470054446

3904003,2,B002C68WNC,"I. Overview
""The Guild"" is a comedy web series about online gaming written by Felicia Day, who also stars as the main character, Cyd Sherman/Codex. The title refers to a group of gamers, known in the game as ""The Knights of Good,"" who play an MMORPG together and decide to meet each other in person upon Cyd's suggestion. The remainder of the series follows the Knights of Good and their interactions with each other after, both online and offline. The members of the guild refer to each other by the names of their avatars in the game: Codex (the main character, who plays a priestess), Zaboo (a half-Indian, half-Jewish guy who plays a warlock), Vork (a middle-aged stickler for rules who plays a warrior), Bladezz (a cocky and arrogant teenager who plays a rogue), Clara (a negligent mother who plays a mage), and Tinkerballa (a diva Asian girl who plays a ranger). Other characters are introduced at different points in the series, including a rival guild and several minor characters.

II. The Pros
Season I is quite arguably the best season of the entire series. Anyone who has had extensive online gaming experience can relate to the guild and their addictions to the online game they play, which seems to be a fantasy setting similar to that of World of Warcraft (which some members of the cast admit to playing in interviews). Zaboo's infatuation with Codex is amusing and draws sympathy from anyone who has experienced unrequited love. The cast is colorful and there are some truly original moments, as the ""boss battle"" with Zaboo's mother. All in all, the first season leaves us curious to see what will become of this motley crew of gamers.

III. The Cons
Unfortunately, subsequent seasons of ""The Guild"" fail to build upon the great groundwork that is set in the first season. Although there are many directions Felicia Day could have taken to develop her plot, none of the characters experience real growth or change. The result is a stagnant stream of antics where truly amusing moments are few and far between and the underdeveloped characters that surround Codex are little more than one-dimensional caricatures. Zaboo's Steve Urkel-like obsession with Codex borders on nausea, Vork is a hypocrite who professes to do good in the game while committing illegal and unethical acts in reality, Clara makes us wish the police would show up and slap her with cuffs for a disturbingly overt display of child neglect, and Tinkerballa convinces us that the modern woman is a gold-digging, man-eating, potty-mouth lump of vanity.

Codex herself turns out to be no more interesting/appealing than the characters with whom she interacts. Supposedly shy and demure, Codex/Cyd: obstinately demoralizes Zaboo, blackmails a fellow guild member, encourages a fight over herself at a party, assumes control of the guild, defeats a rival guild leader, and engages a sexual relationship with a complete stranger. It is not clear whether the inconsistencies in Codex's character - like those of Vork's - are the result of poor acting, poor scripting, or both.

""The Guild"" also projects an overbearing, feminist overtone. Codex openly pursues other relationships with guys while Zaboo grovels for her attention, Zaboo's brief distraction from Codex with a girlfriend ends when she rejects him for another girl, Bladezz is defaced when his mom has a sexual encounter with a rival guild member, Vork is ""undateable"" and his role as leader is surmounted by Tinkerballa and Clara when they reject his guild hall, and Clara dominates her husband while refusing to interact with the couple's children herself. Clearly, this is a series that lacks any strong male characters. The effect here is an estrogen-saturated view of online gaming that alienates the male audience.

Finally, we never see the actual game that is being played until Season IV, and then only briefly. Up until this point, we see interaction between members of the guild only in real-time - typically, with each character sitting at their respective PC, holding conversation through mic and headphones.

IV. Summary
At first glance, ""The Guild"" appears to be the interesting and untold story of the online gamer's world. Upon deeper inspection, the series does not deliver what it purports to be. Rather, it is a polarized and overreaching attempt to dramatize a popular past-time. Indeed, ""The Guild"" owes its popularity to online gaming itself, rather than the ingenuity of its script or the quality of its performance.",1320105600,5,4483,5.043184885290149

What I didn't realize was there was extra content that I had never seem before, stuff not published for streaming.  That was really cool, except now I am aquiring all seasons.",1318723200,,277,4.2075471698113205
3904005,5,B002C68WNC,"It is a little difficult to get into the story as it starts right in the middle of the action, but it is well worth watching. Since the episodes are short it doesn't take long to get used to the characters and the get involved with the story.

I only wish the seasons were longer. This show is hilarious and a real treat for gamers. Anyone who knows even a little bit about the ""geek culture"" will enjoy the humor. Felecia Day is adorable!",1318550400,,439,4.226190476190476

3904007,3,B002C68WNC,"First of all, I'm a HUGE fan of The Guild and I was very happy when the DVDs started to be released.

But I bought the DVD primarily for the commentaries.  And unfortunately, the audio on the commentaries is absolutely awful.  You can only hear one or two of the commentators clearly - everyone else is completely inaudible.  And with this group of actors and writers, missing more than half of their comments is crying shame because you just KNOW they're saying something hilarious.

Sigh.  Felicia, darling, please get some better mics for all future commentaries.",1309132800,,566,4.84375
3904008,5,B002C68WNC,"I'd been hearing other people talk about this series for over a year now and now thought it would be something I'd like.  For some reason I got the misimpression that it was about people who ""create"" role playing games.  But it turns out it's just about regular (and irregular) people just like you and me who also happen to love playing games on-line to the detriment of their personal lives.  That is until this one group who only have known each other on-line are forced to meet in person and then the hilarity kicks in.  WRITER/STAR Felicia Day has created an amazing storyline that is part cringe-humor and laugh-out-loud nonsense.  But it also has a great heart.  I've only watched the first two seasons, but I'm getting them all now and can't wait to see SEASON FIVE when it appears on youtube later this year.",1307318400,2,817,4.561643835616438

That said, my wife is not a gamer, doesn't know the first thing about gaming, and still loves this show. It's one of the few gamer-related things I can share and enjoy with her.

The special features on these seasons are a lot of fun and offer a great insight. Definitely worth the paltry price of entry.

3904015,5,B002C68WNC,"I actually found this show awhile after it was released (I checked it out after I heard Day was doing a Dragon Age webseries) and I really enjoyed it. I find it amazing that they could find completely unknown actors and make really original and interesting characters. In my opinion, the funniest character is Vork who delivers lots of punchlines in an awesome deadpan. Personally, I've never played MMORPG's but I am a big RPG fan and I've met up with internet friends to play Rock Band together. So I was able to relate with the characters and story, though all of the people I met were pretty average, unlike the show. Here is where one of my issues stand, while the show is very successful at avoiding common gaming stereotypes, they end up adding new ones. I feel like throughout all of the series, not one normal character was introduced, and while I know they wouldn't be conducive to comedy, it does become a bit unreal. My other issue is that there aren't any even slightly overweight men on the show. Maybe I'm biased, but it's just weird when the character I identify with the most is Codex, a cute petite ginger chick (mostly because of her intelligence and slight social anxiety). In the end though, I just absolutely loved the show, and I'd be sure to share it with people I know and re-watch it a couple times.",1300492800,2,1325,4.525

3904017,5,B002C68WNC,"I remember discovering the guild before they were a big hit and seasons 1 and 2 are still as hilarious as they were when they first came out. The only real sticking point for this is the fact that many of the webisodes are less than 10 minutes long. Thankfully, seasons one and two are packaged together to make it consumer friendly on the fanboy's wallet. Considering the length of the seasons, the price isn't too bad. However, if you're not sure you're a fan, go to MSN and preview the first couple of episodes just to make sure you like what you're getting. All and all I'd recommend this awesome WoW induced series.

Sure you can get the episodes for free, but hey that's just what Vork would do. So bring cheese to your burger joint and save up your loot from cheese gouging to invest in these quality dvds. Splurge on your expense budget! :)

Kidding aside, this is an excellent show but I do suggest watching a few webisodes to see if you enjoy it first. It's probably not for every human on the planet, it's definitely for all Role-Playing Gamers, and maybe even for those casual gamers... Even beyond that niche, I bet anyone will find it humorous even if you don't get all the lingo at first. If you're not a gamer, give it a shot anyway you may just be pleasantly surprised!

The DVDs offer a great deal of extras and have two alternate audio tracks with commentary, along with an easteregg! I usually skip all the ""making of"" and commentary b/c I find them boring, however I surprisingly enjoyed The Guild's extras.

It starts out low-key, but the humor builds the longer you watch, and just keeps building.  I hurt myself laughing.  The characterizations are terrific, and the dialog is absolutely hilarious.  I've gamed (tabletop, not on-line) so I recognize a lot of the ""types"", but I think even people who've never games will respond to the quirky, off-beat, and very fast-paced humor and the plays on stereotypes.

Maybe it works best in its current format of little 5 minute ""vlogs"" but it is certainly worthy of more!  Felicia Day is excellent as a ""relationship-challenged"" woman who spends most of her time playing an online fantasy game similar in idea to World of Warcraft.  The show revolves around her quirky friendships with the other players, and how awkward those relationships become when they cross over into the real world.",1271635200,,597,4.766990291262136

3904032,5,B002C68WNC,"A very clever series from a talented cast!  The truth in lending clause is that you can down-load the entire series off of the Internet.  When I ordered this set I was overseas in a band-width challenged area.

I watched the entire two season set from start to finish.

It is a loving look at the best and worst of Massively Multi-player On-line Role-playing Games done by a cast centered on three that have worked together in the improv world for years.  It shows.  They are brilliant together.

The story takes us through the trials and tribulations of Codex (played by Felicia Day, who also writes the series) who has a hard time finding time for the real-world in-between her marathon MMO gaming sessions.

In the first season, Codex is confronted with a cross-over from the MMO to the real-world when one of the players comes to live with her, because ""our characters have like a relationship.""  Crazy situations and hilarity ensue that are finally resolved when the guild (*gasp*) meets for the first time in the real world.

The second season features Codex's quest for love, and introduces another set of memorable characters.

Anyone who has ever played an MMO for more than a few hours will recognize the archetypes portrayed in the series.

Nicely done Felicia Day!  I am a fan!

In service,

Rich

3904045,5,B002C68WNC,"""The Guild"" made the Amazon Editors' Picks: The Top 100 DVDs and Blu-ray Discs of 2009, IMO, for a very good reason.  This is a top notch comedy series -- currently, my very favorite.

The story behind the ""The Guild"" fascinates me, and fully demonstrates the potential of the internet for a truly creative, and dedicated team to make and distribute high quality entertainment on an amazingly modest budget (particularly early on).

At the center of this creative effort is Felicia Day, a 21st Century 'Renaissance woman', who inspired a Wired online writer to say:  ""the wonderful girl geeks in history, like Ada Lovelace, Marie Curie and Felicia Day.""  Felicia Day writes the scripts, has the lead actress role (Codex), co-produces, and promotes this series.  IOW, she does it all.  I find it truly remarkable what a young woman's (self-professed) 'addiction' to online gaming blossomed into, and how a series that was once supported by PayPal donations eventually picked up the support of Microsoft.

As others have mentioned, while you can watch this online for free, you will get better quality from the DvD as well as many extras, which are well worth viewing.  And, you will help support a very worthy effort, IMO, one which is at the forefront of what I think is a new media revolution.

I can't wait for Season 3 to complete, and go to DvD, along with the incredible ""Do You Wanna Date My Avatar"" music video, and the very funny Halloween special episode.

Bottom line: buy this for yourself and your friends.  You don't have to play a MMOG to enjoy it; although, my guess is some who do play those games (like myself) may enjoy it even more so. :-)

3904046,5,B002C68WNC,"Late in posting my review, but others already noted plot and character details, so no need to rehash those.  Let me just say that Felicia Day and her ensemble deserve every bit of notoriety that The Guild is bringing them.  If you're not a gamer, you may miss an occasional bit of innuendo, but the genuine writing and spot-on acting will hook you nonetheless.  And, of course, it's funny as hell.

One nice aspect of the boxed set is that you can watch both Seasons 1 and 2 in uninterrupted glory.  For me, that really helped bring home the character development between the first few episodes and the second season.  It's almost like watching your kids grow, without the headaches.  The progression continues in the current (third) season, which I'll be snapping up as soon as it's released to disc.

As an aside, if you're not familiar with Day's bio or other work, check out her Wikipedia and/or IMDb entries.  She is an extremely gifted individual -- and talented actress, of course -- as well as a smart businessperson.  (In a recent talk with my son, I used her as an inspirational example of what someone can achieve when they're smart, work hard and don't give up.)  Her life story would probably make a great movie in itself, and she's only around 30 years old.

I'm not as familiar with the rest of the cast, but my limited exposure to other work from Lewis and Parikh was great fun, too.

Although, as one reviewer noted, you can watch these episodes online, why would you want to?  With the DVDs, you get uninterrupted viewing, extras and a picture that looks great on a big screen.  The only possible improvement would be HD on the disc. Plus, you're supporting someone who's made a name for herself the hard way -- and given us belly laughs and, really, new friends in the process.
