5878369,5,B00DYAPXXM,"This is the best workout tape I have ever owned. The instructors are EXCELLENT!  I love to dance, I love salsa and calypso dancing and music, and I got both in this DVD.  Of course an added plus is the cardio workout I get when I do it.  For me, this is the most pleasurable exercise and I don't feel that I am exercising.  I feel exhilarated from this DVD. I am almost 71 and not down for the count, not by a longshot!! I want to keep moving.  It keeps me happy and exuberant and frisky.  Moving = LIFE.",1385942400,13,504,3.99
5878370,5,B00DYAPXXM,"I believe the DVD Step by Step is one of the best I have danced to.  The music gets your feet moving and elevates your mood if you are feeling depressed.  I love the way the instructors break down each move before moving on  to more difficult material.  Also, showing the dancers from not only the front, but a back view is most helpful.  Since using your DVD, I have lost, not only weight, but inches in my waist and hips.  This tape will help people move on to taking Zumba classes and feel confident in their ability to learn more challenging footwork.  I will be checking in to more of your Zumba Dvd's in  the near future.  Thanks again.  BT",1383177600,21,646,4.264462809917355
5878371,3,B00DYAPXXM,I thought it was going to be a step by step work out DVD that I could work out with it so I was a little  disappointed.,1380672000,5,119,3.4074074074074074
5878372,5,B00DYAPXXM,"Perfect for me, who has no dance background at all. I now can keep up with the class! Fun, energetic, yet slow enough to learn the different steps. Slowly moves up the pace to zumba speed.",1379980800,24,188,4.25
5878373,1,B00DYAPXXM,wasnt what i wanted it said on the description that it was a zumba workout and it turned up to be just steps.,1379894400,13,109,3.782608695652174
5878374,5,B00DYAPXXM,This is an excellent DVD that breaks down every Zumba move slowly step by step.  So when you do go into a class or move on to a regular Zumba DVD workout you will know what you are doing and not injure yourself.  Often in classes the instructor does not have time to breakdown all the moves for you so they just go too fast to follow.  Everyone should have this DVD before attempting Zumba.,1377907200,56,390,4.173333333333333
5878375,4,B00DYAPXXM,only watched a little so far but seems very easy to follow,1411257600,,58,3.9166666666666665
5878376,4,B00DYAPXXM,great,1410652800,,5,5.0
5878377,5,B00DYAPXXM,"I appreciate how they do the steps in three motions.  First they break it down step by step, then they show it in slow motion tempo, Lastly they show you how the dance should look at regular tempo.  I can learn the step and know how to do it before I get to class.  One zumba class I went to the instructor did not slow down the steps for people who were new to the class she just keep the tempo at a fast pace.  Hard to keep up, but now I can keep up because I learned the steps.",1407542400,2,480,3.77
5878378,5,B00DYAPXXM,"Zumba really is awesome and this CD is exactly what it claims to be in basic steps. Even going through it though,  gives you a swaeting work out.",1407110400,,145,4.178571428571429
5878379,4,B00DYAPXXM,Great for beginners. They literally show you step  by step.  It lasts about 1 hour and has many different steps.  Good deal!,1401926400,,124,4.545454545454546
5878380,5,B00DYAPXXM,"This DVD is fantastic!  I love the way they teach you the steps.  Now, I'll be able to do all the steps in other Zumba DVDs.",1400025600,,124,3.730769230769231
5878381,2,B00DYAPXXM,"It was beyond my ability.  Not the fault of the DVD or the instructors, it was me.  I'm too old for this!",1399680000,,105,3.727272727272727
5878382,4,B00DYAPXXM,Basic moves explained well and demonstrated slowly for beginner to keep up.  I would recommend this before going full-fledged Zumba.,1396742400,,132,5.6
5878383,5,B00DYAPXXM,received this and gave as a gift. Have not heard how they like it yet. Guess it was what they wanted.,1396137600,,101,3.857142857142857
5878384,5,B00DYAPXXM,I've faced it. I am uncoordinated. I can't dance. But this DVD takes it slow and easy for people like me.,1395446400,,105,4.0476190476190474
5878385,1,B00DYAPXXM,"I don't think it was made clear enough that this was just steps, no dances.  I wanted an exercise video, already know the steps.",1394323200,,128,4.333333333333333
5878386,4,B00DYAPXXM,"Love the pace and the instructors explain the steps well. Wish they would have had a final workout at the end, even though it can be a workout just learning the steps. I would have found it to be more useful that way, instead I just passed it on to a friend.",1393804800,,258,3.980769230769231
5878387,5,B00DYAPXXM,"I was not sure about doing Zumba, for 2 reasons., 1-age-baby boomer, 2-not very dance coordinated., I did 2 sessions at the Y.  The workout class could burn up to 565 calories.  I wanted to keep going to the class (since it really is a great workout), I thought would benefit from learning a little more about the steps.  I find this DVD to help tremendously!  They break down each common Zumba step, step by step.  Start off slow and gradually increase to tempo.  After a few more at home practices, I whould be ready to go back to class.  :)",1393632000,2,543,4.316831683168317
5878388,1,B00DYAPXXM,"The dvd was disappointing.  As stated, the zumba steps ARE introduced but they are never put together into a workout routine.  I will have to purchase another dvd to get a zumba dance routine.",1393200000,,192,4.617647058823529
5878389,1,B00DYAPXXM,I hated this. I thought there was going to be a class to take on it and there wasn't. I wasted my money.,1391817600,3,104,3.5652173913043477
5878390,5,B00DYAPXXM,This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and I know she really likes it and enjoys working out with it.,1391644800,,104,4.0
5878391,4,B00DYAPXXM,Yes it was very helpful in learning the steps at a slower pace.  I was in a class that started before I joined so I needed to catch up. Very helpful.,1391299200,,149,3.806451612903226
5878392,5,B00DYAPXXM,Its great for beginners! It really breaks down each step slowly then builds up to a fadter pace! I highly recommend this for beginners,1390867200,,134,4.625
5878393,1,B00DYAPXXM,This DVD wasn't the cheapest option out there.  Once you master the moves the DVD is worthless.  There is no workout on the DVD.,1388534400,8,128,4.291666666666667

8599056,5,B00DYAPXXM,"delivery was fast. this dvd is as stated in customer reviews, it is the dance steps and how to do them NOT an exercise dvd-however in learning the dance steps you get a work out.",1422835200,,178,4.114285714285714
