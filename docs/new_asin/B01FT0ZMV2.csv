8761466,4,B01FT0ZMV2,"I think is a great movie, and I was hoping there would be a detailed book from which the script originated, but it is not so. The reason for not giving it 5 stars is because the sequence of scenes in the escape and chase could have been more ""emotional"" to the viewer, with added suspense and closer to being captured. The end is inspiring, and can be interpreted more than one way, but it works.  I watched it several times.",1488326400,,425,4.246913580246914
