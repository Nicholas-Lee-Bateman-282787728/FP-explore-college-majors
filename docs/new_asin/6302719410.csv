500117,1,6302719410,"If you own this episode on VHS there is no reason to purchase the DVD version.  I am a big Inspector Morse fan and find this to be one of the better episodes but the DVD itself is horrible.
I cannot believe how a show as popular as Inspector Morse can be turned into such a shoddy DVD.  The DVD contains no extras (although some newer episodes do contain laughable text trivia, ha!) The transfer is mediocre at best, and lastly the packaging is cheap. I recently purchased ""Brideshead Revisited"" on DVD, wonderful transfer, wonferful packaging, many extras including a booklet.  Is it really too much to ask that the series be treated with a little respect, how about some extras behind the scenes footage? a director or author voice over? maybe an interview with some of the surviving cast? Its just dreadful in every respect.  I can only hope the series is issued again by a company with more taste.",1035244800,16,901,4.577639751552795

500121,5,6302719410,"LAST SEEN WEARING was one of the first dramatizations of the BBC/PBS series of 33 episodes based on the character of Endeavor Morse, Detective Chief Inspector of the Thames Valley Police Department--serving the city of Oxford in England. LSW is actually based on one of the 13 books Dexter wrote, and contains  a clever and complex plot. I think I'm fairly intelligent, and I read many mysteries, but I will say, I was baffled by this story. I read the book first, and recommend you do too.
The storyline is this--a young girl who is a day student at a private girl's school fails to come home one day. The police are called in to find the girl. Six months later, the girl is still missing and Morse is put on the case.  He tells Sargeant Lewis, ""She's dead.""  ""Why do you say that Sir?"" says Lewis. Morse replies, ""Because I'm the three-file man. They bring me in when there are three files, and when there are three files, someone's gone missing too long.""  So the first mystery is this, is the girl alive as Lewis says, or is she dead as Morse insists??
If she is dead, who killed her? The headmaster of the school has been behaving suspiciously. His wife thinks his actions are odd. The assistant head mistress seems to have some knowledge she is keeping under wraps. And then there's the father who has access to all sorts of earth-moving equipment--and he's her stepfather after all and a wealthy one at that. On the other hand, one of the male instructors quit quite recently, around the time when the young girl disappeared. He moved onto a lower paying job in another school. Why would he do that?
For regular fans of BBC/PBS drama and comedy, the cast is filled with many familiar faces. Julia Sawhalia (""Absolutely Fabulous"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"") and Hugh Grant's old girl friend (Estee Lauder model) play students. ""As Time Goes By"" fans will recognize the actor who plays Alistair. In LSW he plays the young male teacher who recently vacated his job at the private school where the female student disappeared.
The DVD is excellent. The shots of the English countryside are wonderful. The crisp clear photography reveals the black circles under Morse's eyes (he has a little alcohol problem) as well as the 20 layers of dirty green paint on the long corridor in the old police headquarters building. This is vintage stuff.",982972800,39,2339,4.656174334140436

Here we are at the second episode of the second series and Inspector Morse goes from strength to strength.
A young schoolgirl, Valerie Craven, has went missing and despite the Police and Valeries fathers best efforts, a year later and she still hasn't been found or made any contact with her family.
 Morse and Lewis are given the case to bring the proverbial fresh pair of eyes to the case. Or as Morse so delicately puts it; One file, anybody. Two files, Ainley or McKay. Im the three file man. No, shes dead. Morse has little interest in the case as he is convinced Valerie is dead. This lack of interest grates on Lewis and it comes to the fore when he snaps at Morse, Well, you got your body, sir when one of Valeries teachers dies by someones hand or possibly by accident.
However, Lewis was correct; the death has now piqued Morses interest in the missing schoolgirls disappearance. Questions begin to arise: Why did the French teacher at Valeries school, Homewood School for Girls, leave to work at an ordinary comprehensive school? Why did the headmaster of Hometown appoint Cheryl Baines as deputy when he obviously has nothing but contempt for her? Why is Valeries mother lying to the Police? Morse and Lewis attempt to not only to answer all these questions but to find Valerie.
John Thaws Morse is at his grumpiest and irascible in this episode but for me and other Morse fans this is part of the reason we love him. Far too many other detectives in the 1980s and 1990s were all sweet and light and never had a bad word to say about anyone. Morse changed that and I personally believe that thanks to Morse, TV detectives become more realistic, more human, and more like all of us. We all have bad days and so does Morse.
In this episode there is no love interest for Morse and though he does appear to have a little liking for Cheryl Baines he is proverbially barking up the wrong tree. In fact he is the wrong gender of tree.
The episode starts calmly, even sedately with Morse sitting at home reading Thomas Hardys novel, Jude the Obscure. The novel alludes in a small way to this episode in that the town of Christminster is based on Oxford and it involves the love for a teacher. (Hey Im studying for an English Literature and sometimes it spills over to other areas of my life, ;)  ) As the episode moves on it gradually builds momentum at a very satisfying pace and this is due not only to a good screenplay by Thomas Ellice but good direction by Edward Bennet who would go on to direct seven Morse episodes.
For British viewers there are quite a few familiar faces in this episode: Philip Bretherton who plays David Acum is known for being the book publisher in the wonderful As Time Goes By that starred Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer. He also appeared in Coronation Street some years back. There is also Julia Sawalha who is best remembered for playing Saffy in Absolutely Fabulous and more recently starred in Lark Rise to Candleford. Of course we all recognise Elizabeth Hurley as one of the schoolgirls even though she was 23 when the episode was filmed.
The episode has a very good ending helped considerably by the wonderful portrayal by Peter McEnery of the slimy Donald Phillipson as he tries to talk his way out of a very sticky situation.",1400889600,,3288,4.531986531986532

500183,3,6302719410,"When the Inspector Morse Mysteries were first broadcast, I was still delivering packages for UPS while episodes were being broadcast. I have managed to see a third of the series, sometimes in their entirety but mostly in snippits over time. One of the reasons I am a Prime member is the reasonably priced and sometimes free downloads through Amazon Instant Video. I have watched all of the Inspector Lewis seasons, Derek Jacobi as Claudius and Cadfael; the new Sherlock, old Campion and Jeeves and Wooster are on my watchlist. I have searched for the Morse Mysteries, finding them on Amazon. I bought the first three seasons for around $75, and was sorely disappointed to find NINE episodes in the first three seasons, was shorted two episodes from the third season. $8.00 per episode of poor quality is NOT my idea of a bargain, especially for a TV series 25 years old. As much as I would like to see the other 24 episodes, I will die first before I am ripped off again by ITV/Amazon or whoever wants to make a mint off Morse's memory. They should have their eyes held open ala Alex in A Clockwork Orange and forced to watch Fox News for 24 hours. And to offer to buy back a $25 3 DVD season for $6.00 is an insult to your regular customers. GREED will be the cause of your demise.",1358812800,4,1282,4.459574468085107
500184,5,6302719410,I love all the Morse mysteries. This is one of my favorite series. Love John Thaw in anything he does.,1355270400,,102,4.15
500185,3,6302719410,"John Thaw is one of my all-time favorite actors in investigative dramas. Thaw's Morse is compelling to watch - he loves listening to operatic music, enjoys his quality pint of ale, is addicted to crosswords, easily smitten by a pretty face and intelligence, and is meticulous and astute in his deductive reasoning. All in all, Morse exemplifies the consummate detective, and most of the Morse episodes are of superior quality in terms of writing and acting.

This set though contains one very good episode, and two less than great ones.

The Wolvercote Tongue
In The Wolvercote Tongue, an American tourist is found dead while resting in her hotel room. Though her death is initially ruled as the result of a coronary attack, Morse is convinced that something must have brought about her death, especially since the dead woman was about to present a prized jewel called The Wolvercote Tongue to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. When another body turns up soon after, Morse is convinced all is not right, and sets about solving the murder mystery with his long suffering detective sergeant, Lewis (Kevin Whately who went on later to star in his own series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masterpiece-Mystery-Complete-Inspector-Lewis/dp/B0056031NW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masterpiece Mystery: Complete Inspector Lewis</a>

Last Seen Wearing
This is one of my favorite Morse mysteries. In Last Seen Wearing, a teenage student at an elite prep school has been missing for the past several months. The case finally lands in Morse's lap, and he confidently tells Lewis that the girl is dead. Lewis refuses to accept this, and eventually Morse gets on board and the duo start investigating. Everything points to the girl's school, and the list of suspects is long. The headmaster appears to be hiding something; the deputy head (a woman with lesbian tendencies) seems to know something but refuses to divulge any information; the male French teacher has upped and left, transferring to another school; and then there's the girl's stepfather, a powerful businessman who may or may not have something to hide.

I like how Morse conducts his interviews as they are done in such a manner as to be considered thinly-veiled interrogations, and often putting the interviewee at an awkward disadvantage. There are some familiar faces in this episode - a very young Elizabeth Hurley who plays a student at the school, and also Julia Sawalha from Pride and Prejudice and Lark Rise to Candleford. Lewis' role is more of a hands-on, dig in the dirt kind in that he spends much of his time roaming around trying to piece the other pieces of the puzzle. Together, Morse and Lewis make a formidable team indeed.

The Settling of the Sun
The Settling of the Sun is another Morse episode that I felt was underwhelming for several reasons. It is one of the bleakest of the Morse episodes, lacking some of usual wit and humor in other episodes, and centers around a conspiracy, dating back to the war years and its repercussions.

Morse is invited to present a prize for a crossword competition organized for a group of international students. When one of the students is found murdered, Morse's investigations reveal a darker motive that goes back to the war years (the dead student is a Japanese).

Usually, the supporting cast in the Morse episodes do an excellent job, but not so in this particular episode. I found some of the acting over the top, and some less than credible. Aside from that, Morse falls for a lady professor here, but unlike the women in other Morse episodes (beautiful, charming, witty, and intelligent), this lady appeared high-strung, whiny, had mood swings, and was generally a very unappealing character. This made it difficult to understand or even believe Morse's attraction to her.

Final verdict - strictly for fans only.",1350777600,3,3873,5.136507936507937
500186,5,6302719410,The entire series is the very best of British story telling and acting. John Thaw was wonderful as the crotchety Inspector. It's really great to see Kevin Whately as his sergeant as a young man.,1348444800,,194,4.571428571428571

They picked the right man for the job, for I can't imagined anyone else playing Inspector Morse.  I've enjoyed watching it on PBS.  Although Mr. Thaw is no longer with us we have the privilege of watching such a talented and fine performer at work. Thank you Mr. Thaw. Now how I missed purchasing set 5 I have no idea. Definitely will do so on my next purchase/order.  And yes I will RECOMMEND Inspector Morse.",1347235200,,537,4.35
500222,5,6302719410,"This is Set Two of eleven ""Inspector Morse"" Sets. Each Set has three episodes/discs. Don't confuse these eleven ""Sets"" with the previously issued (but still available) ""Collection Sets"". Each of the six ""Collection Sets"" cost more, as each has more episodes/discs than these Sets.

This Set has three episodes, all from Series 2 (what we call seasons in the U.S.). They originally aired December 1987 and March 1988 in this same order. The British Series 2 series included one more episode, ""Last Bus to Woodstock"", which has been moved to the next Set Three of these Inspector Morse DVD sets.

In ""The Story of Morse"" a 50 minute documentary about Inspector Morse, Colin Dexter says this: ""If you're going to write right about forensics and pathology and ballistics and so on, obviously you've got to know your onion. But I know nothing. Absolutely nothing about that. And if you write who-done-its, in other words, the central idea of the author is to dangle half a dozen people in front of you, so you always guess the wrong one; never the one you thought of; never the butler, and all these sorts of things, the less you know of police work, the better! And you just want to mystify everybody, don't you?!""

Episodes:
The Wolvercote Tongue
Last Seen Wearing
The Settling of the Sun

THE WOLVERCOTE TONGUE:
A tour bus pulls into Oxford. It's a high-end tour with only 12 participants, lead by the tired and disaffected guide, Sheila Williams (played by Roberta Taylor). She rushes from the bus to meet Dr. Simon Kemp - whose name should be Dr. Shallow - only to have him tell her his wife says he can't see her anymore.

Laura and Eddie Poindexter are on the tour. The Oxford stop is important, because the wealthy Laura is donating the Wolvercote Tongue to the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology, the first university museum in the world, established 1677. The tongue is part of an ornate two piece belt buckle, somehow separated after they were dug up together. The Ashmolean already has the buckle.

Eddie returns to their Randolph Hotel room to find Laura dead and the Wolvercote Tongue gone. Was it really just a heart attack?

Trivia: This episode was written by Julian Mitchell, based on a short story by Colin Dexter. In 1992, well after the TV episode first aired, Dexter expanded the short story into a novel titled ""The Jewel That Was Ours"", though there are differences between the novel and the show. Dexter's walk-on is when he appears as the man behind Morse in The Chapter Bar of the Randolph. This episode is full of lovely wry humor, especially in the interactions between Morse, Lewis and Max de Bryn, the pathologist.

LAST SEEN WEARING:
Morse is grumpy when he's given a new file. It's Valerie Craven, a teenager missing for six months. The only reason he's given this missing persons case is that Valerie's father, construction magnate George Craven, is not just rich, but on the Police Committee. Lewis is raring to go, trying to give Morse the 3 files compiled on the missing girl, but Morse isn't interested: ""I'm sorry to disappoint you, Lewis, but she's dead.... They put me onto these things when they can smell a corpse. One file - Anybody. Two files - Ainsley or McCay. I'm the three-file man. No, she's dead.""

Another reason Morse is disgusted with handling the case. He's supposed to solve it, but he's not supposed to bother the family. He interviews the father anyway (which gets him in trouble). Lewis: ""The thing with you is, if somebody tells you you can't do something, you go right on and do it, don't you?""
Morse: ""I make it a rule.""

This is a murder mystery, so there's going to be a body. But will it be Valerie's?

Trivia: This episode was written by Thomas Ellice, based on the 2nd Colin Dexter novel of the same name, published in 1976.

THE SETTLING OF THE SUN:
An Oxford school has a welcoming dinner for its summer international students. Morse is at the head table, next to his friend, Dr. Jane Robson. At her request, he created a crossword puzzle for the summer attendees. He's there to give a prize to the student who does the best on the crossword. Morse gives a little speech before awarding the prize: ""On the whole, crosswords are far more exotic and exciting than police work. Most murders, for example, don't require solving because they haven't been planned. Thought a lot about, perhaps, over the years. Not as murders, but as silence. The silence of a wife, a husband, a son or a daughter, even. No more words, talk, screams, arguments, insults. Insults more often lead to murder than anything else in my experience.""

During the dinner, a student from Japan suddenly takes ill, and leaves the hall for his room. He shortly turns up murdered, his body laid out as if a crucifix. Is this hatred left over from WWII?

Another doomed love for Morse. And his speech is prophetic - in the breach.

Trivia: This episode, written by Charles Wood, is based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Dexter's walk-on is when he appears as the doctor sitting on the bed next to Jane's bed, in the very last scene.",1337126400,14,5075,4.667413213885778
500223,3,6302719410,"The 1980s don't look too awful in Oxford, England, just grainy, something that seems to be an issue with several early Morse episodes. At least polyester and big hair made few inroads, low-tides of fashion simply didn't wash up on Oxford's rarified shoreline. This collection features three mysteries that don't rate the usual 5 stars, because they don't represent the overall Morse oeuvre well, and the filming is utterly dreadful. The experimental shots are claustrophobic, with pretentious mirror images and narrow, sloping filming that make it feel like you're viewing the story through a drunk shoebox. Thankfully, by Set Three, everything is level and excellent again, allowing Morse to stew in his own juices, not those of a pickled lens. When you sail to the far shore, after viewing Set 1 - 11, I strongly recommend continuing your journey with the erudite and clever&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Complete-Inspector-Lewis/dp/B0056031NW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Complete Inspector Lewis</a>. The dynamics between Detective Inspector Lewis and the wry Sergeant Hathaway (Laurence Fox) are a treat.

The Wolfvercote Tongue: The owner of the missing, precious Anglo-Saxon jewel, the Wolvercote Tongue, has been murdered. The filming is nauseating, the story ok. Morse bucks the pathologist's report, believing this is more than a garden-variety heart attack.

Last Seen Wearing: Morse believes a missing schoolgirl has in fact been murdered; he discovers things are not all they seem at her exclusive school. As with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders-The-Early-Cases-Collection/dp/B0011B9W38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders: The Early Cases Collection</a>, the body count rises as the case unfolds. A very young Elizabeth Hurley guest stars as a schoolgirl.

The Settling of the Sun: Silly story line, again, horribly filmed. These three mysteries don't develop the characters well, especially the relationship between Morse and Lewis. Don't worry, it gets much, much better after this. Here, the tranquil cloisters of Oxford College are haunted by the ghosts of WWII, and are the setting for revenge killings. Inspector Morse finds himself dining amongst the suspects, a dangerous side-course indeed.",1323216000,23,2324,6.166666666666667
500224,5,6302719410,"This is one of my favorite Morse mysteries. In Last Seen Wearing, a teenage student at an elite prep school has been missing for the past several months. The case finally lands in Morse's lap, and he confidently tells Lewis that the girl is dead. Lewis refuses to accept this, and eventually Morse gets on board and the duo start investigating. Everything points to the girl's school, and the list of suspects is long. The headmaster appears to be hiding something; the deputy head (a woman with lesbian tendencies) seems to know something but refuses to divulge any information; the male French teacher has upped and left, transferring to another school; and then there's the girl's stepfather, a powerful businessman who may or may not have something to hide.

I like how Morse conducts his interviews as they are done in a such a manner as to be considered thinly-veiled interrogations, and often putting the interviewee at an awkward disadvantage. There are some familiar faces in this episode - a very young Elizabeth Hurley who plays a student at the school, and also Julia Sawalha (from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-and-Prejudice-Restored-Edition/dp/B00364K6YW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition)</a>&nbsp;and also&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lark-Rise-to-Candleford-Complete-Collection/dp/B003WEAW18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lark Rise to Candleford: Complete Collection</a>. Lewis' role is more of a hands-on, dig in the dirt kind in that he spends much of his time roaming around trying to piece the other pieces of the puzzle. Together, Morse and Lewis make a formidable team indeed.

500225,5,6302719410,"Inspector Morse Sets are good English detective series. Each episode is a good length and not too overwhelming. They are intriging enough for the classic ""Who Done It"" modes.",1318032000,,174,5.0344827586206895
500226,5,6302719410,Inspector Morse is the standard for British Mystery. We enjoy the stories very much and plan to continue purchasing them till we have them all.,1317254400,4,143,4.76
500227,5,6302719410,"Detective Chief Inspector Morse is a self assured intelligent man with little respect and patience for people with lesser intelligence, or with ideas with which he disagrees. He reads good literature and listens to good music; Thomas Hardy and Wagner in this BBC film. He drinks too much, usually two pints of ""bitters"" at a time. When told by his Superintendant not to do something, he does it before anything else. The Superintendant is usually angry at him - for failing to obey his orders and for asking for some scotch at a murder scene in this case - but he still relies on him for complicated cases because of his successes. Yet despite his abilities and his ultimate successes, he generally gets matters wrong the first, second, and third time, before getting it right. These matters include misreading the people and developing a wrong case theory.

 In this case, the daughter of a wealthy well-placed man disappears. Morse is handed the case after six months. He insists that the girl is dead, but since the police recently received a letter allegedly written by her, everyone else thinks she is still alive. Morse uncovers lots of information about the girl's family, her school, its teachers, and the teachers' families, and he tries a trick that results in a person's death.",1293580800,,1288,4.85
500228,5,6302719410,"In ""Last Seen Wearing"" (1988) Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse and his minion, Sergeant Lewis, are assigned to a missing person case. A teenage schoolgirl, Valerie, a day student, has been missing for months from an exclusive private school. Morse says immediately without doubt that she is dead. Lewis who has two daughters says he thinks not, but Morse is positive. If you've watched Morse working cases before, you know, brilliant though he is, he often goes off half-cocked. The father is a tyrannical millionaire-builder who treats Morse with complete disdain. A letter has been received from the girl saying she is all right, but Morse thinks that someone has doctored one of the girl's old letters.
The girl's teachers and the young egocentric headmaster of the school become suspects. Without any evidence Morse says that when the girl disappeared, she was pregnant. It's another of his wild guesses.
Morse tools around in his red Jag interrogating suspects. Actor John Thaw does a good job of portraying the prickly inspector, and Lewis is interpreted with great skill by Kevin Whately. Elizabeth Hurley also appears in this episode.
This TV film is much better than ""Deadly Slumber"" because it's actually based on a Dexter novel rather than just the character of Morse. The story is richer; it has touches of humor; the characterizations are much deeper; and the often comic by-play between Morse and Lewis is far better delineated. Morse's conflicts with Superintendent Strange and even with pathologist Max are very well done.
Morse is fond of Classical music especially Wagner's ring cycle, crossword puzzles, and he enjoys reading Thomas Hardy. He enjoys his pints in pubs but can get livid when time is called when he hasn't had his ration. Morse in a pub gets another pint and rationalizes it by saying, ""When I'm thinking, I get thirsty."" He also says to his sergeant, ""You're such a prude, Lewis.""
Valerie was a wild girl who turns out to have had an affair. Morse, in order ""to make things happen"" goes over the line and breaks the law more than once even resorting to forgery. Morse uses lateral thinking (""I can't think in straight lines."") which often proves wrong.
One of the suspects is murdered, and Lewis blows up at his boss and says, ""You were so keen to have a murder.""
After his usual false starts, Morse is able to eke out a solution, but we have great fun on the journey.",1284940800,,2401,4.844282238442823
500229,4,6302719410,"A teenager has gone missing - Morse believes she is dead - Lewis believes she is alive.  The plot builds from there with a woman, other then the teenager being murdered.  The involvement of a girl's school leads us to various behavioral patterns, heterosexuality, bi-sexuality, homosexuality all adding to most interesting plot lines, and confusing Morse no end.  Additional complications are introduced with Catholicism and abortion.  Not much opera here - our only compensations are some chamber music which Morse is relaxing to while reading Thomas Hardy at the very beginning of the story and an orchestral excerpt from Die Walkre just prior to the ME Max's excellent analogy he poses to Morse.  While both are sipping a pint at a local pub Max asks Morse if he understands what it would be like to lose a child, when Morse answers no, Max suggests he grasp the situation by envisioning he (Morse) cannot find his copy of ""The Ring"".  Morse's reply will be found in the video. There is very little icing aside from brief exchanges relative to flowers and first editions.  A fine plot carries this episode despite the lack of topping which we have come to expect.",1165881600,,1166,4.8291457286432165
500230,5,6302719410,"What I particularly enjoyed about LAST SEEN WEARING is the character study of Endeavor Morse, Detective Chief Inspector of the Thames Valley Police Department, serving Oxford.

In the opening scene, Morse is reading Thomas Hardy, one of the brooding classics of English Literature. But construction noise (by a firm that later turns out to be tied into the case) disturbs him and he goes into work--where he continues to read Hardy, and ignore the files that his eager Seargant attempts to thrust into his face.

The pathologist, in trying to get Morse to feel the pain of the parents' loss of their daughter says, ""Imagine that your copy of the Ring Cycle [Wagner's interminable opera] was destroyed and it was your only one."" Yes, as the editorial review says, the ""cultured curmudgeon."" I love it!

Morse's lined face, slight paunch, in-need-of-a-haircut and always in need of a drink gives us a completely different portrait than, say, the dapper Poirot. When Morse confronts the contractor, the man says, ""Oh no, are you the one who drinks?"" Morese doesn't miss a beat to confirm or deny, but simply says, ""Are you the tyrant?""

His boss asks Morse if this flu of his is really a depression. Though Morse denies it, this seems likely. He seems burnt out, and doesn't really snap to in the case until a real body is found to galvanize his attention.

The story is amazing in crime literature in that it has a happy ending of sorts!
