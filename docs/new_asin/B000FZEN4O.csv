It gives a great feel for Kenya's  wildlife areas, the array of animals and safari vacation activities. I really felt like I was there on my own exploring Kenya""s ecologically diverse areas. I thought the filmmakers were surprisingly complete showing the variety of spectacular landscapes that a wildlife safari can take one--not only wildlife open savvanah plains & scrub bush, but mountain forest and coastal areas --all teeming with wildlife. But BEST of all for me -an animal lover--the dvd had many great animal and exciting wildlife scenes---all the ones you would want to see on a safari--lions with cute cubs, cheetahs, elephants with babies, hippo & rhino, crocs, giraffes, snakes, monkeys and lots more.
Enjoyed too seeing the African dancers and the Arab sailing ship scenes-- and also the hot air balloon ride and the really clear underwater scenes. The filmaker swimming with whale sharks scene was amazing! Wonderful photograpy throughout.
Also I was really surprised at how many things there are to do on a safari vacation and enjoyed seeing all the different types of places you could actually stay. If you were actually going--the list of places to stay etc would be helpful. Also appreciated the narration that gave lots of information & answered lots of my questions about Kenya.
In addition to the nice long movie part, there was a well organized button selection feature that enabled me to pick the special things I wanted to look at in depth-- like certain parks and areas and some particular water sports activities. This was a really well done, informative and so enjoyable to watch DVD. I would really recommend it for Africa dreamers and especially if you are going to safari or vacation in Kenya.",1251417600,,1833,4.9480519480519485

8128012,5,B000FZEN4O,"Well worth having in your DVD collection.  It was totally as described in the write up, a wildlife focused journey through wild parts of Kenya and a good look at other activities one might not consider when going to Africa. I am an animal enthusiast so I was very pleased to see all the wild animal footage--with lots of variety beyond the big five! The narration was particularly informative about Kenya and it scenic national wildlife areas and wildlife,  as well as places to go and things to do.  Didn't want this one to end. It was like being there. Am getting the updated version ""Safari Kenya' to add to my collection too. Big plus: the DVD is 3 times as long as most similiar DVD's that I have seen!",1227916800,,707,4.423076923076923
8128013,1,B000FZEN4O,"This is a very basic video with less than ideal production values.  Besides showing some wildlife, there is scant information about culture or other areas of interest to tourists.  Only a handful of tourist facilities are highlighted and no real information is provided other than their websites.  A big disappointment.  I recommend looking at National Geographic offerings instead; at least there you will be getting the best of the wildlife and scenic footage.",1227744000,,462,5.287671232876712
