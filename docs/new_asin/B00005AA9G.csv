1412477,3,B00005AA9G,"It is sad to see talent like Sutherland and Macy go sour with flick like this!  Sutherland and Macy are a father & son hitmen. Dad gives the order and son disposes of target. What a bad choice for hitman! Macy goes to psychiatrist (Jack Tripper-Hahaha)and tell him he kills for a living. Later, he tells him that he has ""fallen in love"" with fellow lobby psycho Campbell that at one time during the flick shows her legs! (Why?--cluck! cluck!) Oh, how sad the ending! Reminiscent to the Orson Welles days of directing when the ""flow"" would SUDDENLY run out & the ending would be abrupt...",993513600,,587,4.537735849056604
1412478,5,B00005AA9G,"I first watched PANIC last October when it aired on SHOWTIME.  I am a huge Neve Campbell fan and jumped at the chance to see something new from her.  I was astonished at how good this movie was.  Don't get me wrong, I love Neve's other movies, but they appeal to the senses in a much more shallow, and immediate pleasure-type way.  This movie seemed extremely deep compared to her role in WILD THINGS and the SCREAM films (which I still LOVE).  PANIC is the story of Alex who is tired of his job of killing people so he decides to see a shrink.  In the waiting room, he meets a friendly, neurotic young woman, Sarah, played with perfection by Neve Campbell.  Alex immediatley takes to Sarah and her antics and begins to slowly get involved with her, easing his way into an affair.  The film brilliantly interweaves the story of Alex's past, his future, his struggles with his family (his father, who forced him into the ""family business"" of murder-for-hire, his mother who quietly supports her husband's decisions, his wife, who feels distanced and bitter towards Alex, and most importantly, his son, who is just beginning to understand how the world works), his torrid affair with Sarah, and the relashionship (which quickly becomes deadly) with his therapist.  The movie does not use special effects to dazzle the eye or even complex camera shots.  The entire movie gives a sort of tense vibe, which really contributes to all of the story lines.  The last ten minutes are honestly the most haunting and compelling I have seen in recent films.  Every actor submits themselves to their role and becomes their character and I honestly believe what they say.  Sammie, the six year old son of Alex, provides the comic relief (the scene at the table where he talks about going into the army is hilarious) but at the same time instills the fear that history will repeat itself, and he too will fall prey to Alex's father.  This is a must see for ANY Neve Campbell fan....or any fan for that matter.",993340800,10,1993,4.641025641025641
1412479,5,B00005AA9G,"If you're a fan of William Macy, this is a must-see film. I think it is one of his finest roles, showcasing his ability to convey emotional complexity without being overly dramatic or over the top. In this film, he plays a hitman who is becoming increasingly tormented by being part of the family business, a business which just happens to be murder for hire, disposing of unwanted people for a hefty fee. The business is headed by Alex's father, played to psychotic perfection by Donald Sutherland, a man who is relentless in his determination to make Alex do his will. Tormented by the idea that his young son might follow his own path, Alex decides to see a psychiatrist (John Ritter). Neve Campbell, cast against type (for those of us who remember her in Scream) does a superb job playing a troubled young woman who encounters Alex in the psychiatrist's waiting room, eventually entering into an affair with him. I won't say more about the major events in this film but hope this brief intro intrigues you enough to want to see it.  Although I plan to watch this one again and again,  I do have to say this might not be for you if you want a movie full of non-stop action, suspense and violence. The drama here is mostly psychological, intense enough in its own way, but far different from that of an action film.",992995200,48,1317,4.529411764705882
1412480,5,B00005AA9G,"Panic is a story about Alex(William H. Macy)who works for his father in the family business. Alex is paid money to go out and kill people. No, in the midst of a Mid-Life Crisis, he wants to quit. He wants to change. But, his father forbids it. If, Alex quits, his father will tell his wife, Martha(Tracey Ullman) and his little girl friend/mistress Sarah(Neve Campbell)* Alex can't have this happen to him, so he sort of pretends that he is still working for him. *Sarah met Alex on the first day of Alex's visit to the shrink. They had a conversation. Alex kept in touch with Sarah, and they had a little fun if you get my drift.* I won't tell you the end, because I know how mad I'd be if I found out the end on the internet.

1412587,4,B00005AA9G,"Both Macy and Sutherland slayed it, no pun intended, lol. Really interesting from a psychological point of view, the riptide father/son relationship is well exhibited between Sutherland and Macy against the juxtaposition between Macy and the actor playing Macy's son, Sammy. Those bedtime conversations between Alex (Macy) and his son, Sammy, were very reminiscent of those in the Courtship of Eddie's Father waaay back in the day, which I thought were some of the best scenes in this movie. I don't remember the name of the actor who played Sammy, but he deserves mentioning because not only were they well acted, but his character was delightfully winsome and added more depth to every scene he was in.

I was both happy and sad the moment I saw John Ritter on the screen, I had no idea he was in this movie, and I was so happy to see him on screen! It's been so long since I've seen him in anything and it reminded me how tragic he left this world too soon. I thought he, Neve Campbell, and Tracey Ullman equally did a good job in their roles. Well, no, Neve Campbell did better, her character was more interesting and more developed.

I'm not sure where the movie title, PANIC, comes from, since that has nothing to do with the movie, in my opinion.

Sutherland, on the other hand is an extremely versatile actor and plays his totally despicable character to perfection. This is a well written and well acted movie that is interesting to watch even though it was never destined to be much of a box office success. PANIC is a movie that held my attention from start to finish partly due to the writing, and partly due to showcasing the screen talents of two of my favorite actors. John Ritter, a talented but somewhat under rated actor who met an untimely end, is very good in this as well and it is nice to see some of his final work.",1466812800,,748,4.58955223880597

1412656,5,B00005AA9G,"A film that takes a somewhat familiar premise (a middle age hit man in midlife crisis seeing a shrink) and turns it into something personal, original and special.  William H. Macy is wonderful as the killer with a perfect family life -- a loving son and wife who know nothing of his profession -- and a calm, easy going exterior coving a man shattering to pieces inside.  Donald Sutherland matches him with a disturbing, chilling performance as Macys dominating father who trained him to kill, and still runs his sons out for murders as if he were an errand boy.

The supporting cast is excellent as well; David Dorfman as Macys young, sweet, slightly oddball son, Neve Campbell as a mixed up, hyper, sexy young woman who is the object of Macys obsession, Barbara Bain, so good and so rarely used, as Sutherlands wife and arguably the real power behind the throne and Tracy Ullman in a completely dramatic role as Macys confused wife.

Its the details the late Henry Bromell (Homeland, Brotherhood), the writer/director brought to each moment that make the film so special.  Whether a wonderful line of dialogue, or the complex look between two actors, theres something about the film that honestly catches the complexity and depth of existential panic, something we all share, whatever we do for a living.  There are things one could quibble with, but I don't want to.  This is one of those special little indie films that never got the attention it deserved despite a number of excellent reviews.",1460764800,,1498,4.80544747081712
1412657,5,B00005AA9G,"This is an absolutely awesome movie. The script and dialog was really genuine, and the acting from the lead characters to the supporting cast, was perfect. The little boy in this movie, stole every scene he was in. He was absolutely a little pistol with a personality plus. He was a natural and didn't appear to be acting like most little kids in movies do.

I do not agree with the title ""Panic"", a minor point as the issues 'Alex' (William H. Macy's character) has are building over time. Panic has typically a singular trigger or trigger that initiate paralysing-type symptoms in an individual.  Tracey Ullman, who plays Alex's wife, 'Martha' has somewhat of a stilted dialogue delivery style; which drew me to conclude this added to making her character seem somewhat dull and drab, in truth she is often has roles completely on the opposite end.  William H. Macy's acting skill is consistent in its ease and its brilliance as it remains so today and in every roll he takes.  The child who play 'Sammy' (adorable 6 year old son of Martha and Alex) has to be an absolute prodigy!  He is just outstanding and the cutest!  I looked him up.  Actor David Dorfman, now 22, graduate of Harvard Law School at age 18.  Keep your eye out for that one, he still is a working actor!",1452988800,,1009,4.535911602209945

1413064,3,B00005AA9G,"The comment in the most helpful critical review is spot on correct, the side story involving Neve Campbell is not very interesting, in fact one wonders why it is there at all. When she asks Macy why he is outside her apartment, he has no answer. Nothing really happens between them but wife played by Tracey Ullman wants to throw him out of the house for it when she discovers the presence of another woman.

the script needs a big re-write. Eliminate the side story with the younger woman altogether. Instead, Ullman as the wife appears intelligent. Does she really think their lifestyle is supported by a meager home based kitchen gadget business?  Although the topic is not addressed, one supposed that Alex is able to launder the money from the 'hits' through the gadget business. I cannot imagine filing a 1040 with the occupation Hit Man on top. And the script suggests that is was Sutherland's wife, played by Barbara Bain, who actually got him in the business. There is the story. Surely wife Ullman wonders where Macy goes when he leaves the House for a hit. Let the tax return get audited, let some questions be asked, all of a sudden Macy cannot account for where money comes from (remember the scene in Fargo where he could not account for the cars no on the lot to McDormand's character). And what does Dad do anyway?  Let Ullman's suspicions start to rise and let the unanswered questions grow and grow. Macy is caught then not wanting to to this any more but terrified the wife will find out his real job in life and that the grandparents are monsters on a Macro Scale. Where would that take the family?  And how does Sutherland cultivate this business anyway, hitmenareus.com?  Watching Sutherland and Bain trying to explain what they have been doing would be much more satisfying and compound the plot more than an uncompleted near affair with a younger woman that never flew anyway.",1451952000,,1900,4.676646706586826

It has a wonderful group of actors in the cast and was apparently a cable movie first, which is why I missed it. It has an ominous thread running through it with various themes and is an adult film because of this. The threads of the different story lines weave in and out and are tied up at the end, and you will have to draw your own conclusions about that. Bill Macy is superb as a former abused and bullied child of domineering parents who finally breaks free in order to save his own child. It is not the stereotypical action film and goes at a slower pace, which is why it will not find favor with most viewers.

There was almost  nothing surprising; and that's the problem with this movie.

The premise is pretty cool too, as it's something a tad different, but not too out there, so it doesn't alienate traditional audiences. The only real problem I had with this film is that while the main idea and story is sound, they really don't delve deep enough into some of the main subjects. They didn't get into the nitty gritty or fully develop Macy and Campbell's relationship as they could have, in my opinion. I also feel like we didn't get as clear of a picture of Macy and Ulman's marriage as we could have. The story spent much more time on Macy's relationships with his son and father. And while these are definitely integral to the plot, I feel like the other two could have used some more screen time, as they could have made the movie more interesting and satisfying.

That might have been okay except that the ending is even more depressing. To make matters worse, there are gaping holes in the plot. The worst hole in the plot involves Alex's failure to question his father's latest assignment. That plot device is what keeps the drama going.

Like William Macy's Alex, we all know what we should do, should say and how we should live our lives.

He seems disturbed over his life and looks for a new relationship with a young lady, played by Campbell.

At mid-life, Macy's character decides he doesn't want to do it anymore, and seeks professional counseling.  The psychologist turns out to be played by John Ritter, who turns in a fine performance.  He is very likeable, and I really enjoyed seeing him in what must have been one of his last roles.

Along the way, Macy becomes romantically involves with another psych patient 1/2 his age - the superbly lovely Neve Campbell.  The plot thickens further when grandpa Sutherland starts grooming Macy's little boy for the family business.  And Macy gets a very difficult hit assignment.

The scriptwriting could have been a bit better.  The time jumps confused me now and then (and you can't make Sutherland, or Macy, look 28 anymore). The cast is top shelf. Nice SoCal backgrounds w/ nice camera work all around.  Suspenseful.  Some smart humor.  Maybe a bit predictable.

This is a very good film. Not such much action, but a good script that stays away from cliches and cheesy lines. The acting is top notch other than Neve Campbell who never really makes her presence felt. In fact, I'd say her acting was alot worse than it was in her first gig Scream years back.

Macy himself does the sad and lonely character really well. I'm not sure he has alot of depth... But he's obviousally found his niche in the acting world. He sort of like Samuel L Jackson in the since that he doesn't have alot of depth, but he's really good at what he does do well.

So why does this movie not get a higher grade?

Well, for one... William isn't really convincing that he's a hitman. Also, the poor job of Neve brings it down alittle... The movie also slightly drags because no action really happens.

The problem is this is a family business, although we are never told if this is part of the Mafia or a private business- the latter, I think. Anyway, in the waiting room, Alex runs into this beautiful young thing played by Never Campbell, and they start talking.  What is Alex to do? His wife thinks he runs a mail order business and what he really does is kill people. Neve Campbell's character is someone who knows nothing, an innocent young thing, just what he needs.

Alex tells the therapist about his job and his therapist (John Ritter) is upfront. If Alex tells him about a forthcoming job he will have to report it, otherwise he is protected by doctor/patient confidentiality.  Alex's father is played by Donald Sutherland, and a more cold blooded man would be hard to find. We see in flashbacks how Alex was trained by his old man and his first job as that of a killer.

""Panic"" is one of those movies that grab you. It is well written, the actors are marvelous and just right for their parts. I had never heard of it. It is a quiet movie that seems to have come and gone.  Daniel Dorfman is Alex's son, Sammy. What a fabulous young actor he is. We realize that Alex needs to save his son, so that the next generation, Sammy, that is, will not have to become a killer.  A scene that is so telling is one of Gram and Grampa browbeating Sammy. We understand how Alex became the hit man, the murderer, the killer, the confused, mixed up man he is.

Alex makes a decision to quit this job. He will confront his father and put a stop to this horrible business. And why does Alex have to support his mother and father through this killing business? It is lucrative enough, so that dad tells Alex he will buy his wife a new Lexus and a vacation after the job is done. Just what kind of family is this? How did Alex such a wonderful man with a conscience, it seems, come to this family? What genetic characteristic is going to help him be finished, kaput, done, fini with the killing job?

1413209,4,B00005AA9G,"What a find this movie was.  Subtle, tense, occasionally laugh-out-loud funny and ultimately satisfying.
A hit-man wants out of the family business, and in to the pants of Neve Campbell.  Which, I suppose, makes him a murderer and a philanderer.  Not that you'll feel anything but empathy and compassion for William H. Macy's character: which, of course, is his genius.
In a story that explores, among other things, the whole family dynamic - from the damage our parents do us, to the effort needed to make a marriage succeed - you'll find it all rings true.  The context of the story is alien and exotic, but the relationships aren't.  Your father is probably not a controlling and manipulative sociopath (and, you know, small mercies and all that ...) but even so, how many of us would find it easy to step up and admonish him, when he steps over the line?
Donald Sutherland's performance as the sociopathic pater is astonishingly good.  He actually had me shouting at the screen.  And I'm British.  We just don't do that ...
Give this movie a go.

Framed that way, both his father and his son can be seen as reflections of his own psyche.  The reason why he is so blank, so tired and depressed, is that they cancel each other out.

A professional killer (played brilliantly by Bill Macy) is at a crossroads in his life as his own young son has reached the age when he himself was indoctrinated by his father to bottle his emotions and start shooting at squirrels, an activity that ended in him adopting the family business of paid assassinations.
That predicament is intriguing in itself, but handled as professionally as the film does, it is absolutely riveting. The dialogue is sharp and smart, and this relatively short film nevertheless has the power to elicit a full range of emotions from the viewer. There are places to laugh, to be shocked, horrified, saddened, aroused, angry, and to love. A wholesome treat.
It is an actor's movie, and the ensemble of terrific artists -- Macy, Neve Campbell, Ullman, and Ritter -- play off each other like members of a top-notch theatrical troupe, who realize that a quality product requires each actor to support the others unselfishly. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland -- who play father and mother -- are positive chilling, discussing the ""family business"" as if it were a grocery store or a dry cleaners. And remarkably, there's Sammy (David Dorfman), the young boy, who turns in an absolutely stunning performance, not to mention his uncanny resemblance to Ullman, whose son he plays!

1413225,2,B00005AA9G,"Before I saw this film, all signs said I would enjoy it.  Its cast includes two of my favorite actors, William H. Macy and Donald Sutherland.  I read boatloads of positive reviews about it, some even calling it one of the year's best films.  I typically avoid mass-produced Hollywood films in favor of little-known sleepers like this one.  And the premise had great potential.
Consequently, it was pretty disappointing when halfway through the film I found myself uttering aloud to nobody in particular, ""Wow, this is bad.""
After having time to absorb the film, I realize that's not entirely true.  The film isn't that bad.  But I'm still baffled by the praise it's received.
The opening scene is promising: Alex (Macy) visits a psychologist for the first time, and when asked what he does for a living, he frankly replies, ""I have two jobs.  I run a mail order business out of my home...and I kill people for a living.""  Alex begins to have doubts about his career, however, when his father Michael (Donald Sutherland), the founder of the ""family business,"" assigns Alex to his next target--his recently acquainted psychologist.
You can pretty much guess the path the film takes from there.  Alex is at the perfect age for a midlife crisis.  He wants to quit his job as a hit man but fears his father's reaction.  And he takes a mistress, Sarah (Neve Campbell).  For much of the film, Macy resorts to hanging his head and looking sad, which he does well, but like Hugh Grant's sputtering speech and fluttering eyelids, this fallback device wears thin quickly.  My biggest qualm with his performance is I never believed for a moment that Macy's character was capable of killing anyone.
This is surprising, because Sutherland goes to great, indeed excessive, lengths to portray a man who could father a killer.  In flashbacks we see Michael teaching an eight-year-old Alex to kill squirrels with a pistol, and later coaching him through his first ""hit,"" chuckling fondly all along.  In the present, Michael viciously berates Alex's 6-year-old son Sammy for spilling glue, shouting, ""What are you, stupid? A moron? Is there a brain in there?""
We're never given any other foundation for this character, and as a result Sutherland's performance is one-dimensional and devoid of any human qualities.  Although it's fun on some level to see him portray an over-the-top maniac, it doesn't lend any credibility to the film.  Alex's mother Diedre, as well, is implausibly unsympathetic.
As Sarah, Neve Campbell plays a patient of the same psychology clinic as Alex.  In one of her first scenes she unapologetically explains to her therapist in graphic terms that she's bisexual, and thus we learn from the getgo what a spunky and unconventional character she is.  She spends most of her screen time spouting purposefully quirky lines of dialogue like ""50 minutes is way too little time to fit in a week of tragedies"" (referring to her therapy sessions).  Of course, her unconventional demeanor is attractive to the alienated Alex, who visits her apartment with unclear intentions, wandering around answering ""I dunno"" to her questions and looking oh-so-confused and beleaguered.
Sammy is an obnoxiously precocious kindergartner who poses timely questions to his father such as, ""What's infinity, Daddy?""  Ultimately the son's function in the film is to act as the ""last straw"": when Michael takes his grandson out to shoot a squirrel, apparently with the intention of rearing another soldier for the family hit business, Alex has had it, and wants it all to end.
With Michael sporadically contributing vignettes of wisdom about ""destiny"" along the way, the result is a lumpy, confused film.
The screenplay can't escape it's plot-driven structure by clumsily fleshing out its characters along the way, and for the first time ever, I could *see* Macy and Sutherland *acting.*  The cinematography is elegant and the music is effective (if a bit familiar at times), but ultimately the film can't escape its clunky dialogue, desperate performances and obvious conclusion.  This film should have been better, but unfortunately I can't understand the praise it's received.",1026691200,6,4156,5.06158357771261
1413226,5,B00005AA9G,"This movie has two absolute highlights:
First one is William H. Macy as Alex. His feeling of exemption in the end is so obvious and touching.
The second highlight is the performance of David Dorfman. Just watch that little kid act.
Also wonderful are Donald Sutherland and Barbara Bain playing Macy's parents. Really scaring.
According to the meaning of Neve Campbell's role to the movie her performance is slightly disappointing. It stays quite colorless; esp. if one considers that she was meant to bring more contrasts to Alex' life. Anyway, the film lives from Alex' relationships towards his son on the one hand and to his father on the other.
Filling the plot in a very worth seeing way are Tracy Ullman playing Macy's wife and John Ritter playing his shrink, as Alex himself calles him.
Great cast. Watch it! You won't regret it.",1020038400,6,836,4.8125
1413227,4,B00005AA9G,"Making a movie is a very risky business. Of the several hundred films that get a theatrical release every year, perhaps just one in three makes a profit. Many hundreds more don't get released at all, although some of these are lucky enough to go direct to video. I love to alert people to great but overlooked movies, and Panic is one of them.
Alex [William H. Macy] is having a mid-life crisis. Without telling his friends or family, he goes to a psychologist for help. When the doctor asks him what he does for a living, Alex replies that he has two jobs. He has a mail order business, and he works for his father. When the shrink asks what he does for Dad, he says that he kills people. Yes, dear old Dad runs a hit man service. And Alex wonders why he feels empty inside! Meanwhile, in the doctor's waiting room, he meets Sarah [Neve Campbell], a strange, desolate and beautiful girl who makes Alex feel alive for the first time in a months. How will Alex solve his crisis? What role will the girl play? Will his wife find out his true profession? Can his twisted father persuade him to go through with the next hit?
What a dumb plot, some of you are thinking, and in lesser hands, it would be. Director and writer Henry Bromell cleverly gives the tale richness and depth. There are several layers to it. Alex may be a bad man in many ways, but loves his wife and his relationship with his young son, played by the extraordinary David Dorfman, is caring and genuine. Their scenes together are poignant and memorable. I suspect that the story is meant to be allegorical. The hit man theme is there to show the extraordinary lengths a sons can go to please his father, no matter how cruel and ruthless that father might be. Even the most dysfunctional family can have unbreakable bonds and twisted loyalties.
Panic is greatly helped by its fine cast. I doubt William H. Macy is capable of a bad performance. The often underrated Neve Campbell gives substance to a character who would be a joke in the hands of a lesser actress. Donald Sutherland is one of my favorites and is perfect here. No one can make a smile look as menacing as he can. Tracy Ullman is believable as Alex's ernest but insecure wife.
Panic was well received by critics and audiences at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival. Later, at a test screening, the audience did not like the ending, so the distributor got cold feet and shelved it. Such is the logic of Hollywood.",1016236800,10,2438,4.456375838926174
1413228,4,B00005AA9G,"The effects of job related stress and the pressures born of a moral dilemma that pits conscience against the obligations of a family business (albeit a unique one) all brought to a head by-- or perhaps the catalyst of-- a midlife crisis, are examined in the dark and absorbing drama, ""Panic,"" written and directed by Henry Bromell, and starring William H. Macy and Donald Sutherland.  It's a telling look at how indecision and denial can bring about the internal strife and misery that ultimately leads to apathy and that moment of truth when the conflict must, of necessity, at last be resolved.
 Alex (Macy) is tired; he has a loving wife, Martha (Tracey Ullman), a precocious six-year-old son, Sammy (David Dorfman), a mail order business he runs out of the house, as well as his main source of income, the ""family"" business he shares with his father, Michael (Sutherland), and his mother, Deidre (Barbara Bain).  But he's empty; years of plying this particular trade have left him numb and detached, putting him in a mental state that has driven him to see a psychologist, Dr. Josh Parks (John Ritter).  And to make matters worse (or maybe better, depending upon perspective), in Dr. Parks' waiting room he meets a young woman, Sarah Cassidy (Neve Campbell), whose presence alone makes him feel alive for the first time since he can remember.  She quickly becomes another brick in the wall of the moral conflict his job has visited upon him, as in the days after their meeting he simply cannot stop thinking about her.  His whole life, it seems, has become a ""situation""-- one from which he is seemingly unable to successfully extirpate himself without hurting the ones he loves.  He can deny his age and the fact that he has, indeed, slipped into a genuine midlife crisis, but he is about to discover that the problems he is facing are simply not going to go away on their own.  He's at a crossroads, and he's going to have to decide which way to go.  And he's going to have to do it very soon.
 From a concept that is intrinsically interesting, Bromell has fashioned an engrossing character study that is insightful and incisive, and he presents it is a way that allows for moments of reflection that enable the audience to empathize and understand what Alex is going through.  He makes it very clear that there are no simple answers, that in real life there is no easy way out.  His characters are well defined and very real people who represent the diversity found in life and, moreover, within any given family unit.  The film resoundingly implies that the sins of the father are irrefutably passed on to the progeny, with irrevocable consequences and effects.  When you're growing up, you accept your personal environment as being that of the world at large; and often it is years into adulthood that one may begin to realize and understand that there are actually moral parameters established by every individual who walks upon the planet, and that the ones set by the father may not be conducive to the tenets of the son.  And it is at that point that Alex finds himself as the story unfolds; ergo, the midlife crisis, or more specifically, the crisis of conscience from which he cannot escape.  It's a powerful message, succinctly and subtly conveyed by Bromell, with the help of some outstanding performances from his actors.
 For some time, William H. Macy has been one of the premiere character actors in the business, creating such diverse characters as Quiz Kid Donnie Smith in ""Magnolia,"" The Shoveler in ""Mystery Men"" and Jerry Lundegaard in ""Fargo.""  And that's just a sampling of his many achievements.  At one point in this film, Sarah mentions Alex's ""sad eyes,"" and it's a very telling comment, as therein lies the strength of Macy's performance here, his ability to convey very real emotion in an understated, believable way that expresses all of the inner turmoil he is experiencing.  Consider the scene in which he is lying awake in bed, staring off into the darkness; in that one restless moment it is clear that he is grappling, not only with his immediate situation, but with everything in his life that has brought him, finally, to this point.  In that scene you find the sum total of a life of guilt, confusion and uncertainty, all of which have been successfully suppressed until now; all the things that have always been at the core of Alex's life, only now gradually breaking through his defense mechanisms and finally surfacing, demanding confrontation and resolution.  It's a complex character created and delivered by Macy with an absolute precision that makes Alex truly memorable.  It's a character to whom anyone who has ever faced a situation of seemingly insurmountable odds will be able to relate.  It's a terrific piece of work by one of the finest actors around.
 Sutherland is extremely effective, as well; his Michael is despicably sinister in a way that is so real it's chilling.  It's frightening, in fact, to consider that there are such people actually walking the earth.  This is not some pulp fiction or James Bond type villain, but a true personification of evil, hiding behind an outward appearance that is so normal he could be the guy next door, which is what makes it all the more disconcerting.  And Sutherland brings it all to life brilliantly, with a great performance.
 Neve Campbell looks the part of Sarah, but her performance (as is the usual case with her) seems somewhat pretentious, although her affected demeanor here just happens to fit the character and is actually a positive aspect of the film.  If only she would occasionally turn her energies inward, it would make a tremendous difference in the way she presents her characters.  ""Panic,"" however, is one of her best efforts; a powerful film that, in the end, is a journey well worth taking.",1014681600,13,5818,4.799599198396794
1413229,5,B00005AA9G,"I wasn't totally sure what to expect when I rented this movie.  I was browsing the shelves, and this one had caught my eye several times.  I always brushed it off, though, expecting some sort of FARGO wannabe.  Admittedly, the premise doesn't sound all too inspiring.  But, you can't go wrong with William H. Macy, and Donald Sutherland is always good (even in bad movies).
So I rented it.  I could not believe how much I enjoyed the movie. The cast was terrific, I'd even venture to say brilliant.  Everyone in this movie is perfect, especially the son.  But more on him in a second.
The hitman plot is interesting, and fun to watch.  The father-son relationship with Macy and Sutherland is all too painful and similar to many, I'm sure.  John Ritter and Tracey Ullman are two of the kindest, most sympathetic characters ever.  But the son...the actor who played Macy and Ullman's son was the best part of the movie.  Blowing on his harmonica at the breakfast table, his mother frantically trying to get him ready for school, he finally stops and looks up at her: ""Mom, I'm composing.""  The birthday scene is the most touching I've seen, all without words.  The scene, maybe a minute or two long, had me smiling the whole way through unbeknowngst to myself.  It wasn't a funny, scene, it wasn't comedic, it was just touching.
But all that makes it sound like some sappy movie.  It's not, really.  The movie actually made me very happy (in a weird kind of way, which you'll see if you watch this movie).  It's not sentimental, it's not melodramatic, and it's not a tearjerker.  It's hard to put into words what it is, but it's like holding a newborn baby (which still sounds sappy).
I really cannot reccomend this movie enough.",1013558400,5,1727,4.60655737704918
1413230,4,B00005AA9G,"The ""banality of evil"" has long been a source of fascination for those artists exploring the dark side of human nature.  Gloomy houses filled with vengeful spirits or twitching psychos hold less fear for the common man than the sudden discovery that the ""people next door,"" the PTA member down the street, or the social director for the local church youth group are the true villains who surround us unnoticed, people whose very ""normalcy"" serves to mask the evil within.  For only when the mask is finally ripped off and we at last get to see what we have been living next to all along do we come to realize how very tenuous is our security and safety in this world.  What could be scarier than that?
In this category of works, ""Panic"" emerges as a genuinely chilling, emotionally unsettling psychological thriller, short on gratuitous violence and long on characterization and mood.  Writer/director Henry Bromell has fashioned a dark, disturbing tale of a man named Alex (William H. Macy) who seeks the professional help of a therapist played by John Ritter.  Alex's problem is a decidedly unique one:  it seems that, since he's been a teen, he has served as hit man for his father (Donald Sutherland) whose mysterious, shady ""business"" apparently calls for the elimination of certain parties at the request of unknown ""clients.""  Alex is a seemingly good man, devoted to his wife and son, who has somehow found a way to distance himself emotionally and morally from the heinous crimes he commits.  Yet, obviously, Alex has arrived at a point of moral reckoning - for how else to explain his sudden need to unburden himself to this total stranger?  Macy gives a brilliant performance as Alex, showing, in his totally understated reactions to the people and events around him, what it is like to be buttoned up so tight that even with all the mayhem and filial abuse he's experienced in his life he is able to truthfully say ""I don't know if I've ever been angry"" - even at his father who got him into this life in the first place.
What makes ""Panic"" so unsettling is that it violates all our comforting notions about the ties that bind father to son and family members to each other.  Rather than setting a fine moral example for their child, both of Alex's parents, Michael (Donald Sutherland) and Deidre (Barbara Bain), have actually groomed him to become a cold-blooded killer.  Yet, life seems to go on in surface ease within the confines of not only that family but Alex's own family as well.  Alex keeps the truth hidden from both his wife, Martha (Tracy Ullman) and his 6-year old son, Sammy (David Dorfman), allowing them to function almost as any other normal suburban family.
Yet, Alex has other, perhaps more mundane problems as well.  He meets a somewhat disturbed 23-year old fellow patient named Sarah (Neve Campbell) to whom he feels an immediate attraction.  Tentatively, these two lost souls grope towards each other, both of them hoping to find in the other that which is lacking in themselves.  But in many ways, Alex is actually a man of strong moral character in certain aspects of his life and he agonizes over taking the initial step towards consummating their relationship, knowing it will harm the wife he loves but no longer feels attracted to.  Bromell's sophisticated screenplay refuses to spell out every psychological detail for the audience, allowing us to make our own connections, draw our own conclusions and reach our own moral judgments.  As director as well, Bromell establishes and maintains a mood of almost heartbreaking melancholy and sadness.  Characters rarely speak above a hush; the camera glides slowly along taking in the scene at a leisurely, unhurried pace; and the haunting musical score heightens the strange unreality of the world which these people have come to inhabit, a world that seems to call into question everything we take for granted in the area of morality, ethics and basic common decency.
The performances from every member of the cast (right on down to little David Dorfman) are letter perfect.  Each of these fine actors knows exactly the right note to hit in every scene, never cutting against the grain of understated seriousness that Bromell has established.

1413249,5,B00005AA9G,"It's amazing to me that this film wasn't released as widely as, say, Memento or even Sexy Beast.  It is an absolutely superb film featuring William H. Macy(Fargo) in his finest performance to date as Alex, a second-generation hitman railroaded into the business by his controlling monster of a father, played by Donald Sutherland(JFK).
The first thing that should strike any viewer about this movie is its cast.  There isn't really a weak link in this movie, even though it does feature Neve Campbell.  Campbell's performance, incidentally, really says something for Henry Bromell's direction:  she's actually convincing, cast against type, and gives her strongest performance to date as the troubled love interest Alex meets in his psychiatrist's office.
The extreme circumstances featured in this film -- i.e. a middle-aged hitman seeing his shrink -- are really only a metaphor for the mid-life crises of half of America's middle-aged men, who went unwillingly into their father's businesses and sacrificed their own dreams.  This movie is not about a love affair or a hitman; it is about how hard it is to be someone's son in America, about the expectations placed on men in our society and the outlets which we are given and which are denied us to express ourselves.  Perhaps Neve Campbell herself delivers the most telling line in the film:  ""It's easier being a man, don't you think?"" to which wife Tracy Ullman replies only with a knowing look, then turns her back.
It's a shame this film was overlooked.  Henry Bromell's debut as writer-director on this film proves one of cinema's finest.  William H. Macy gives the strongest performance of the year, far outdoing Russell Crowe's unintelligible stone-faced Maximus; it is also Macy's greatest role, the culmination of every unsure forty-something he's played.

1413250,4,B00005AA9G,"PANIC is another in a string of fine performances that have shown William H. Macy to be 'quietly' establishing himself as one of the best actors working today.  He delivers the line quoted above just moments after being confronted by his wife, Martha (Tracy Ullman), about possibly being involved in an affair.  It's a very telling line -- Macy gives it such an air of detached resignation -- it exemplifies the pivotal, life-changing crossroads at which Alex, his character, finds himself.  It's a decision that he has to make -- there is no way to avoid it -- but one that he dreads.  He is a man in a corner with no easy way out.
A first directing and writing effort for Henry Bromell, PANIC is a well-composed and intelligent film.  The casting, acting, cinematography and music all combine to create a seeming oxymoron, a sort of 'relaxed tension' that builds as the story progresses.
Alex is having a bit of a mid-life crisis -- he's a son dominated by a cold, controlling father (Donald Sutherland), dragged at an early age into following the old man's footsteps into the 'family business', which just happens to be murder-for-hire.  The only other person who knows what the business really involves is his mother (Barbara Bain) -- until the stress and unhappiness of his life bring him into the office of a psycholigist (John Ritter).  In the waiting room he meets fellow patient Sarah (Neve Campbell), a beautiful, troubled 23 year-old woman with issues of her own, to whom he becomes uncontrollably attracted.
It is at this point that the viewer begins to realize that this film doesn't take the easy road.  In the hands of another writer or director, everything might become nauseatingly predictable -- but it the case of PANIC, the audience is treated to a more realistic, 'inside' look at a hit man, indeed, a hit man with a conscience.
The DVD edition includes a few deleted scenes -- interesting, but just as well left out.  I would go so far as to say that any one of them being included in the finished product might have actually detracted from the overall effect of the film.  Clocking in at only 88 minutes, the film is leaner than many -- but that allows it to move along nicely, to the point, with the fat trimmed away.
This film did well at festivals, but didn't fare as well with most critics (Roger Ebert raved about it, however) or in theatres.  Available now on DVD, it's one that viewers should take the opportunity to explore.",994204800,8,2455,4.659722222222222
1413251,5,B00005AA9G,"I discovered this film in my public library.  I've been impressed by  William H. Macy's acting in other films so decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did because this is a hidden gem of a film that deserves a much wider audience that it's received to date. At first this seems similar to the hit tv show ""The Sopranos"" in its concept and idea with having hitman Macy see a psychiatrist, ably played by John Ritter.  However, Tony Soprano fits into his mobster family's world a lot better than Macy's character Alex does.  Alex exhibits all the classic signs of someone who has been steamrollered into the family business, really doesn't belong there and wants out of it.  His conflict is with his father (Donald Sutherland), mother (Barbara Bain) and himself.  No other mobsters are even used in the film.

Sutherland and Bain are superb as the facade smooth parents who expect and get total devotion to their aims from their son and expect the same generation after generation.  The other main characters, Alex's wife, his girlfriend and his son, serve as contrast to the tension created by this deadly trio.  Alex grabs hold of the three of them, who have no idea of the nature of his ""work,"" as if they can keep the demons of his parents at bay. Macy gives a very subtly layered and nuanced performance that delivers a very profound look at the dark side of a middle aged man caught between his parents and his own desires.  I haven't seen Neve Campbell in many roles but she shows lots of promise for the future.  Traci Ullman as the wife does not give us her usual comic turn, turning in a solid dramatic performance as the wife instead.  Give this film a chance.
