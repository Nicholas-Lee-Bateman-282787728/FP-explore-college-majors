2068555,4,B00028G6FI,"The cover is totally cheese, so I hesitated in buying it, but I am so glad I did! The moves are up to date and fun to do.

The only drawback is that once you learn the whole routine you only do it twice... all that work just to do it twice? I wish they would do the entire thing more, instead of me rewinding and playing over again. I suppose I could do it myself, but what fun is that?

Anyway, it's a great workout but don't expect to get the moves the first time or without pausing. After you go through it once it makes it a good workout after that.",1100390400,,553,3.8849557522123894
2068556,4,B00028G6FI,"I like this workout because it is fairly easy to follow and it gets your heart rate going.  At first I thought it was kind of cheesy becase the dancers in the video are all white girls, however, the lead dancer is talented and a great teacher.  I do think that the hip hop is definately of a more ""cacasian"" style but it is still a lot of fun and there are some challenging moves during the workouts.  It is a great buy for the price.",1100304000,7,434,4.023255813953488
2068557,5,B00028G6FI,"At first, the pure and innocent white girls doing hip hop (can't knock them too much, as I am one myself) seems quite cheesy. But after you get into the routine, you forget about all of that and start having fun trying to learn the routine. You get so into the routines that you don't even notice how hard you're breathing until you're done. Would definitely recommend.",1095811200,6,369,4.522388059701493
2068558,5,B00028G6FI,"This video is very fun and keeps up my heartrate.  It might be a little difficult for people with ""two left feet"" or who haven't done much dancing or aerobics.  The instructor was great and I thought she broke it down well, not so slow that your heartrate went down, but not to fast to get lost.  I highly recommend this tape if you love dancing and want a good workout!",1095379200,148,370,4.183098591549296
2068586,4,B00028G6FI,"I'm a competitive runner, so I'm in very good cardiovascular shape.  Normally I wouldn't choose to do a workout video for my exercise, but this one is good for me when I'm injured because it's low impact.

It's divided up into four different 10-minute dance routines/workouts (3 + a bonus).  If you're a beginner exerciser, you can do just one of the videos at a time.  If you're more experienced, you can do all four of them in a row and get a 40-minute low impact workout.  For me, the 40-minute workout is not too difficult, but I do break a sweat.  I also feel like it keeps me motivated to exercise when I'm sad about being injured.

At first, I found the video frustrating because the dance moves were difficult for me to learn in the amount of time given.  However, I did the video over and over again and eventually was able to get them (although I'm still working on some of them).  It was a fun feeling of accomplishment to get some of the moves, and I was able to get a decent workout along the way, even when I was doing them all wrong.

Finally, Juliane Arney, the instructor, is likeable.  Perky, but not offensively so.

This video is a good bet for people who need something low impact or for beginners who are not thrown off by the challenge of practicing dance moves until you get them.",1360972800,,1304,4.3429752066115705

Easy to do tho some moves can be challenging but able to master in a short time. This workout does make me feel good afterwards and I always break a sweat. I've seen reviews where people say they don't and they probably ate not doing the moves correctly cause u will burn calories and sweat. Love the routines and thisbis by far my favorite workout video above all others.,1329782400,,488,4.315217391304348
2068592,5,B00028G6FI,"I bought this dvd quite some time ago and recently started working out again with the dance moves.

2068594,5,B00028G6FI,"I'm a man, 45.  After using this for over a year now, I say honestly that this is my best and favorite dance workout DVD, so much so that I wore it out and considering buying another new copy.  I strongly feel some people are dismissing this DVD too soon.  Granted, the moves are a bit challenging, but you CAN master them using the ""rewind"" button on your DVD and a bit of patience and determination.

Once mastered, these routine WILL give you years of quality exercise enjoyment AND learn some usable, impressive and funky dance moves to boot.  At dance parties these days, people call on me to lead them.  Most of my moves that impress them the most are from this DVD.  All this makes this the most valuable DVD for me.

Some have said that they don't sweat using this DVD.  WHAT????!!!  I don't know.  Perhaps they are super-athletes or something.  This makes me sweat plenty.  You can always adjust the intensity of the moves once you have learned them well.  Too, recently, after having memorized the routines, I just dance these routines to my favorite dance songs (faster in tempo).  That REALLY pumps up the intensity.  So, be creative with it.  This has been the most scientific and methodical dance workout dvd for me.

Well, now that I'm hooked on dance workout, I'll move on to see what else is out there.  But this DVD is going to be my home base for years to come.",1246838400,3,1380,4.448

2068608,3,B00028G6FI,This is a fun work out there's no doubt about that!  There are three workout routines each getting progressively more difficult.  The third one is very hard but I haven't given up yet.  She gives you a lifeline that you can always revert back to should you lose your way during the routine.  Practice will make the routines easier.,1234137600,,331,4.559322033898305

2068610,2,B00028G6FI,"I've got a fair bit of dance experience (although not hip-hop), but I found this video extremely hard to follow. The moves seem great, but she teaches them very quickly, and the camera often does not show her feet.  Hard to follow steps just from the torso. After sticking to the lifeline a few times through and watching some bits on slow on the DVD, I'm slowly picking it up, but I'm not convinced this will ever be in frequent rotation for me.",1214870400,2,446,4.373493975903615

Up to this point, I hated exercise because it was so boring and exhausting.  Now I am amassing a wide collection of various exercise videos, but I still love Cardio Hip-Hop Workout.

2068613,3,B00028G6FI,"I originally purchased this DVD because it was supposed to be subtitled. No subtitles or closed-captioning to be found (I told Amazon.com to change the description).

The DVD itself isn't too bad for those who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing because the screen shot shows the whole body view for most of the video.

I couldn't understand what was being said in the DVD, but it wasn't exactly easy to follow the movements - the first time. I'm sure that after a few more tries, the video will become easier for everyone.

I would suggest this DVD to those who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing, but I hope Deaf and HoH people will read this review before deciding to buy the DVD.",1202428800,,670,4.387096774193548
2068614,1,B00028G6FI,"I purchased this video after reading many of the reviews and thought this would be a great alternative to traditional aerobics while learning some new dance moves to try when I go out dancing at the clubs.

What a disappointment.  The moves are poorly instructed, poorly cued, and generally difficult to follow.  I realize that practice makes perfect, but the poor instruction and cueing leave me thinking I don't want to waste my time...  I have other videos that will actually get me a good workout without feeling bewildered and confused.",1201478400,,541,4.912087912087912
2068615,4,B00028G6FI,"I really enjoy this workout for the most part.  Julie Arney is so personable and she's a really good instructor.

There are 3 10 minute segments in this workout that you can do all at once or split up any which way.  The steps are quite complicated, more so than most other hip hop workouts.  This is also pretty high impact and fairly tough to do on carpet, but I like the workout enough to modify it to be able to manage on a carpeted surface.

The warmup is extremely short and I don't believe there's a cooldown.  I sweated up a storm with this one.  I could not get the choreography down the 1st time through...I was frustrated and almost turned it off, but I liked Julie enough to start it over again right after doing it the 1st time...I was able to get 90% of the moves down the 2nd time around.  The moves are too fun to give up on!

I don't recommend this one for beginning dancers 'cause the moves are tough to get down.  But if you have some previous hip-hop experience, this one will be fun for you...I actually like the fact that this workout has a high learning curve because I have to work for it!

Recommended to intermediate/advanced.",1197936000,,1152,4.287037037037037
2068626,3,B00028G6FI,"I find it difficult to learn the steps.  I have to watch and re-watch until I have a move down.  By the time I learn the whole routine, I am bored with it and don't have the patience to learn the next routine.  I also find the instructor to be obnoxious, but I think most of them are.  I still give the video three stars because I kept with it longer than with any other video I have had.",1197504000,,388,3.8734177215189876

But, if you are rhythmically challenged you can do it if you watch it several times. I am a dancer and I had to watch it 3 times to feel like I was moving along with the DVD.

2068628,4,B00028G6FI,I like the 10 min intervals per work out and it is fun but the choreography is cheesy and even funny at times. But over all it gets the job done.,1190937600,,145,3.7096774193548385
2068629,5,B00028G6FI,"I've attended aerobic classes and used several DVDs before but this DVD is by far the best I've used. The music is good and the routines are great, so you won't feel like you are intentionally working out like most work out routines make you feel. The dance steps are not something you would pick up just after one try, but think about it, if you learn everything easily then it gets boring quickly too. I actually look forward to dancing every morning, which is really the first time ever I feel like this when it comes to working out. If you like to dance, this is for you.",1189468800,,575,4.284403669724771
2068630,4,B00028G6FI,"I really enjoyed this work-out tape.  I enjoy dancing and was looking for some new moves that were more hip-hop style as the Crunch dance work out DVD I had was actually more of a mix of styles.
The first time I did the Cardio Hip Hop tape, I really didn't get any of the moves. The second and third times, I got some of them down and then after a few more work-outs, I was able to follow rather well.  Granted my form is still not perfect, and I shudder to think what I would see if I were to tape myself doing the moves at this stage :) However, I am mirroring the moves on the screen well enough that I am usually starting and ending on the correct foot/arm and at the right time.

 For me, not getting it right off the first few views gave me more drive to keep doing the tape; I liked the challenge it provided.  Initially I thought there was no way I would get the moves down, but now I have and with time will probably get better. I would also like to note that other than one ballet class in the 1st grade, I have ZERO dance experience.

The DVD is broken down into 3 ten minute sections with a bonus ten minute section.  I found section 4 to be the most difficult choreography.  There really is no warm up or stretch time, but hey, for a ten minute work-out, what do you expect?  Same thing with the short break down of the moves.  They are trying to cram a decent heart pumping work out into a ten minute session - if they did a warm up, a cool down, and more break down, well there wouldn't be much actual dance time.  That being said, I think the 10 minute solution people should offer a couple 2-3 minute sections to designate for warm up and cool down.  It could be optional, just like selecting the number of sections of the work out you want to do for the day.  That way you can do a warm up and cool down if desired, which is usually highly recommended.  It would only add maybe 5 minutes to the entire workout, which would be well worth the benefits.  But, a 15 minute workout certainly doesn't sound as enticing as a ten minute workout.

So, long story short, I will list my opinion on the pros and cons

PROS
Challenging
FUN (once you start to catch on)
Cool Moves
Can choose 1 ten minute session or all 3(4 w/bonus)for 30/40 min work out
Instructor is pleasant and NOT annoying
Encourages adding your own 'flavor' to the moves
On screen timer so you know how much time is left - can be a great motivator during those times you are dying to be done!

CONS
No warm up or cool down session
Moves are tricky at first and you aren't offered a whole lot of break down
Music is lame - in fact I heard the same songs on other work out DVDs I own!

As a further note, if I did want a longer workout in the beginning while still learning the moves, I would just repeat the same section three times in lieu of moving on.  Once I had the moves decent and wanted something new to try, then I moved on to the other sections.",1189468800,5,2931,4.0820244328097735
2068631,1,B00028G6FI,"I was looking forward to a fun hip hop workout and to learn a new routine. The music sucks..it is more like musak and that just killed ot for me right there.

I wanted to break this cd into pieces , but I will probably just learn the routine with my own music  playing over the soundtrack.",1188432000,,424,4.096385542168675
2068632,1,B00028G6FI,"Unless you already are a hiphop dancer it is hopeless to follow her intructions. She has NO idea how to teach ... NONE whatsoever. She shows you a move maybe twice, full speed, not telling you which leg or arm to start on, not showing it from the back so you could mimic and then you are expected to HAVE it and she moves on.

Ridiculous.

2068633,2,B00028G6FI,"This is not the dvd to get if you have any dance experience at all. The moves are not cool and I found the instructor's bubbly talk annoying. The back up dancers are not anything to aspire to either. I found one of them to be such a bad dancer that it was distracting. That said, I do like the format of the dvd with each dance being 10 minutes so you can mix and match. There is also a bonus dance which I found a little more challenging. But if you are looking for a workout, I think going for a walk would be more exercise.",1184630400,,526,3.925233644859813
2068634,5,B00028G6FI,"Quick Fix Cardio Workout is one of my first and still favorite dance oriented workout DVD.  As with all the Quick Fix videos, this program is divided up into three 10-minute segments (as well as a bonus segment), which make the workout seem really fast.

The instructor is Juliane Arney and her style of teaching the moves makes the video cool.  Each segment consists of two 5-minute routines, which are combined at the end for the ""real workout"".  The moves take a little time to 'get down', but once you've learned them, you'll find yourself staying just a bit ahead as Juliane builds upon each move.

The video is not terribly challenging on the body, but it is cardio and therefore good for you!  Some of my favorite moves include ""Zip-It, Drop-Out, Waterfall, and Spin the Record"".  As Juliane says during the program, ""It doesn't even feel like working out.  It just feels like having a good time.""  And it does!",1182816000,,918,4.6521739130434785

The moves look like nothing ive seen today. Her moves are stuck in the 1980's.  The music is out there too. I expected Rap music ,not techo. it didn't make sense. She also teaches way too fast.  If you want people to learn you have to show us at least 3or 4 times.  She shows you once and then adds more to it. I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone who's 20 like myself or older. The only people who like this dvd are people who are stuck in the 80's or maybe  pre-teens.  OVER ALL .... NOT A GOOD DVD.  get QUICK FIX -CARDIO KICK ( KICKBOXING).  THAT DVD IS MUCH BETTER.",1167868800,,744,4.006802721088436

I get up 10 mins early -which doesn't kill me- and pretty much wakeup as I do the video. Easy, simple and it gets my heart rate up enough in 10 minutes that I don't feel it was a waste of 10 mins of sleep.  The video is not complicated and not overly intense, so this is the wrong video if you are looking for a hardcore cardio, but if you just want a quick 10 minutes I do recommend this video.",1167782400,,549,3.9279279279279278
2068661,1,B00028G6FI,"I was disappointed in the music - it is ordinary exercise music and is definitely not of the hip hop genre.  Moreover, the instructor shows you in detail real small simple steps and then quickly advances to more difficult steps with little or no chance to even watch her do it slowly let alone teach you to do them.  Very disappointing.",1167696000,,336,4.491803278688525

Highly recommended.",1164931200,,265,4.24
2068663,3,B00028G6FI,"I bought the entire set and absolutely sing it's praises rather often than not...that is other than the hip hop routine.  There is one part that you run in place for like 8 counts, it's not fun at all & I didn't even lose my breath!  The first few counts are fun and then it goes down hill.  If Carmen wasn't the instructor, I don't think this one would fly as well as the others.  It's just too short and believe me, you will notice once it starts playing.  Now if you want a real work out, Disc 2 in the Striptease series is the best if you want FIRM results.  The lap dance DVD is fun...I think it could be a bit more complex!",1164585600,2,629,3.992

The pace is a little slower than I like so I have to exaggerate the movements to make it work.  I feel like I get a good upper body workout as well as the cardio.  I have a small space to work out in and am able to do this in that space.  The teacher has a fun personality and the other two members add their personalities to the fun.

I also like that there is a bonus workout if I feel like extending my workout a little longer.  There is no warm up or cool down but I don't really need a video to show me how to do that.",1163894400,3,625,3.732824427480916

2068671,1,B00028G6FI,"The music and dance moves are fun BUT a basic concept in exercise was missed here. All of the shots are taken from the front. Unless your brain can rapidly learn and perform dance moves with the OPPOSITE side of the body that you are viewing, you will be awfully confused. It is much easier to learn body movements when viewing the instructor from BEHIND, so that your can copy the moves with the same side of the body.

One of the few exercise videos that does this is the Firm's ""Boomers."" Too bad it's not available anymore.",1163030400,3,527,4.377551020408164

(I have one more of her work outs ""Dancing off the Inches"" and it is also great). You don't even realize after you are done that you have been working out for about 43 minutes (if you do the Bonus) because you have been busy dancing and having fun!  I am 40 years old...refuse to grow old and I love dancing hi-hop! I have danced and worked out for 35 years and I am a certified instructor, but some of the moves were a little confusing at first. Do not be discouraged. When you get the moves (it will just click) you will have so much fun. I do this work out at least 2-3 times a week together with a weight lifting program. I find it works really well together. If I had to say one bad thing it would be that I miss a cool down at the end of the work out.",1163030400,,852,3.896551724137931

It took me a little time to learn the dance steps, but I felt like I got a workout even while learning.

My only negative comment is that the instructor says the dances are from music videos; she is right. They are from music videos but from videos from the 80's.  I was doing most of those dances when I was 12 ( I'm 30).  So, if you are going to an 80's party and you need to learn some dances from the 80's, get this DVD!",1161648000,3,552,4.169811320754717
2068676,2,B00028G6FI,"....is korrect with this one. I haven't seen her video and I WOULD NOT buy a single one because I know EXACTLY what 'tc' is talking about.

This female moves waaaayyyy to fast for a person to grasp the moves.

How do I know you ask?...Well, I have COMCAST CABLE and and if you hit ""ON DEMAND""--she has a 12 minute session under 'Life and Fitness' (I think that's the heading).

She is under the 'Quick Workouts' section and she just ought 2 be, because that's just how quick she moves...

I guess in defense of the video...it doesn't say 'BEGINNER'...but DAMN...hip~hop is just that...HIP~HOP.

Some of tha' moves can be a bit complicating and tha' foot work-- confusing...and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that you need to slow it down--if you tryin' ta' teach it.

You see tha' dancers on videos...it requires a lot of energy.

She will have you (to me anyway) huffing and puffing a little to hard and to early in the game and never wanting to exercise again.

Don't get me wrong...hmpff!...she moves great (not stiff like some) but if she wants to reach a broader audience...SLOW DOWN AND PUT THE ROUTINE TOGETHER AFTER A FEW PRACTICES OF EACH STEP!

I am one who views 'instructional' DVD's 2-3 times first b4 I try them...it helps you to memorize the routine i.e direction of the body, foot work (to some extent).

But it doesn't work with this chick.

Instructors are suppose to motivate you...but this female...can kill any motivation a person has who is trying really hard to gain better health.

Me...she won't kill mine...I'll just move to someone who understands that first impressions...applies to exercise instructors as well.

Don't give up!...I believe a good HIP-HOP Aerobic session would/will be fun.  It will also help you burn a 'krap' load of calories with a proper diet.

You just have to get the right instructor...bcuz baaaaby...she--is--not IT!!!!!",1161561600,,1891,4.811145510835913
2068677,3,B00028G6FI,"I've been trying to do this workout for two weeks. The instructor doesn't break any moves down in half-time, and moves on to the next move way too fast. ""Okay, now add arms!"" she says, while I am still trying to practice the feet, then she moves on. I'm still trying to get these confusing and complicated moves, and I end up doing half-hearted movements, without getting much of a workout. I'm also tired of looking incredibly stupid whenever my husband walks in.

The other problem with this workout is how white-bread it is. Many of the moves are from the 80's, really dated. Also, all three dancers are white and look like they've never been in a black dance club. They dance with goofy smiles and wear weird wannabe outfits like a sportsbra plus camouflage cargo capris. I'm white, and I would never let my black friends see this video, because they would laugh really hard.

I gave this video three stars because I like the setup - you can do the same 10-minute workout three times in a row in order to try to learn it better. I'm sure that when I finally learn the moves, it will be a fun, sweaty workout.",1158019200,8,1112,4.419512195121952

I like that it tells you the amount of time left in your workout.  That's always an incentive for me.  She breaks things down well so in the end you can pretend to be a b-girl (even though you totally aren't) and look one-third of the part.  I always question when people who aren't of color try to teach dances of other ethnic communities, but if you just want to get your heart pumping and not die of boredom, this is a decent workout.",1152316800,4,560,4.295238095238095

This video is so much fun and I do break a sweat. The instructions are fairly easy to follow and it is broken down into three different 10-minute workouts with increasing levels of difficulty. (I'm still on the first one.) If you are a beginning dancer who wants to try out some cool moves, get this DVD. You might even forget that you're a dork!

Save the hard cardio for another day, and if you want the latest moves, visit the hip club in your town. This workout (either all the routines together, or the 10-minute segments done separately) is for those times when you want to loosen up and enjoy yourself and don't really want to feel like you're working out. You do need to be quick on your feet - ten minutes is not really enough time to teach the choreography to beginners.

Except that it's so fun, I'm almost sorry when it's over.

I look forward to doing this DVD.  If it's cold or raining or whatever and you don't feel like going to the gym, you can do this DVD and feel good about not just sitting around.  If you are looking for hot new club moves, I have no idea why you would buy an exercise video.  This DVD is just fun, fun dance moves that get your heart up the more you work it.  Don't give up if you think it's too hard to follow the steps.  Don't use that as an excuse!  Keep trying and it will come.  It's so fun!

This really isn't a DVD for someone who sees themselves as going clubbing every weekend and looking for something to impress. It is for someone who is bored with the tedium of the CRUNCH line, and looking for something fun and quick. I didn't find the choreography particularly hard and ""cheesy"" seems to be an overused word on these reviews. If the moves aren't over dramatized, then it is hard for a viewer to see exactly what is being done so I figure cheesy is actually helpful to breaking down the moves.

I lost about five or six pounds in two weeks learning how to hip hop, and now I want to try other dance styles!

That way i get in a good 30-40 minute work, i've worked up a really good sweat, and i had a blast doing it! Sometimes i'll even decide to hit that replay button a few more times (back to back) and discover that i've done a full 60 minutes! You'd be surprised at how quickly the time passes, and how much fun it is once you're comfortable with the moves.

If you love to dance and don't go ""clubbing"" very often--this is a really cool way to scratch that itch AND do something good for yourself. I highly recommend it for anyone that even THINKS they want to dance. Have to say this tho--if you don't have a very natural ""groove""--you might struggle at first. I felt a little like a geek during a couple of the moves, but after running thru it a time or two, it's all good! In fact, i'm fixing to get my ""groove"" on right now! Time to work out! :o)",1139788800,9,1305,4.158102766798419
2068751,5,B00028G6FI,"I LOVE THIS DVD!!!!  At this price, it's a particularly phenomenal value.  And even more so when you discover that in addition to the 3 10-minute routines it promises, there's a 4th ""bonus"" routine - totalling 4 10-minute routines.  Here's what you need to know:

This is not an ""aerobics routine"" in the conventional sense, but dance coreography.  It takes - or, as in my case, forces you to develop (if you stick it out!!!) - a whole different set of ""dance"" and/or coordination skills than are needed for your average aerobics w/o.  I.e., it's not ""even"" between right and left sides.  While many ""steps"" are in fact repeated evenly between sides, there are many that only one side gets.  Additionally, once you start putting the moves together, often the step beginning one move is also the last step of the previous move...unlike other dance and/or aerobics routine where you finish this move then start the next one, basically putting them next to each other...here, they flow into one another.  Hard to explain, but you'll know what I mean once you see it!!!

I found that in spite of the fact that I generally tend to catch on to even sometimes tricky aerobics routines, and have always been a good ""improv"" dancer, this style and coregraphy was really challenging - okay, frustrating - for me at first.  But I was stubborn, and I would use the ""slow"" button on my DVD player and repeat moves in slow motion endlessly til I got it.  By the end of 2 weeks, working on it daily (and even in my sleep!!), I pretty much was beyond the frustration/challenge of the style and moves, and knew the coreography.  I find the more I do it, the more I ""groove"" it.  I discover new and more subtle nuances to the moves, get into the music more, really dance it.

Rather than getting more boring the more I do it (like most routines), it actually becomes more and more enjoyable...so much so that I can do it for an hour and still want to do more!!!  (so much for quick!!!  :-)

Another thing - when I played the intro, and heard Julienne's voice, I thought ""oh, no way, her voice will drive me nuts!""  But much to my pleasant surprise, once I started the routines, I found her to be throroughly enjoyable and a terrific ""teacher"" - her voice didn't bother me in the least.  She's not over the top like some, and she's clear - and keeps up with reminder ""keywords"" as the routine works from ""learning"" the moves to ""dancing"" them.

I also enjoyed the 2 women who danced behind her, and the camera work was great, allowing full view of the moves (rather than focusing only on a face when you need to see legs and feet!) and not being ""all over the place"".

THE MUSIC is FANTASTIC - better than any DVD routine I've experienced thus far, really professional sounding, without a ""canned"" ""aerobics"" sound.

All in all, a really well done, fun, polished production that provides a heart pumping, sweat producing workout.  I wish there were more versions of this!!!

HAVE FUN!!!",1139788800,11,2967,4.5423728813559325

The instructor is great, music decent, moves fun, works works works and you get 40 minutes!!!!!  You can mix and match the ten minute segments or just choose one, etc.  She explains everything and it moves at an excellent pace!

I hope she makes more of these videos because the leader is wonderful.",1139097600,3,430,4.448717948717949

2068754,4,B00028G6FI,"I just got this DVD last week and although I agree that the steps aren't broken down very much, I decided to just focus on the first 10 minute workout the first day instead of overwhelming myself learning all 3.  Believe me, it makes it a whole lot easier.

I had so much fun learning the steps that 2 hours went by without me even realizing it!  My advice: just keep at one section til you get it. It does look hard at first, but I've done the first section of this DVD 3 times now and I've got it pretty much mastered. It's really one of the rare instances where I actually look forward to working out. :o)",1138665600,4,608,4.092436974789916
2068755,3,B00028G6FI,"This is a fun and effective cardio workout. However, the 10 minute segments are fast-paced and can be hard to follow at first. It took me three to four attempts before I had mastered the routines to the point where I felt like I was getting a good workout.

2068756,1,B00028G6FI,"I've taken hip-hop classes before and loved them so I bought this video to do at home. It's not good. In fact, it may be one of the worst videos I have for more than one reason. The music is bad, the moves are bad, it doesn't get my heart rate up, they don't go over the moves. I bought it because of all the positive reviews I read but now I'm starting to think the producers are writing those reveiws.

I wouldn't recommend buying this video.",1138233600,12,444,4.103448275862069
2068757,3,B00028G6FI,"I enjoyed the video for the dance elements.  It was fun to workout to a little hip hop and I find myself doing some of the moves around the house spontaneously.  However the workout wasn't much of a workout.  It's not very high-energy and I didn't sweat much.

If you don't have two left-feet and just want something fun to do a low energy work-out to, this is for you.  For those with left-feet, it might take you awhile to catch on but if you enjoy dance, this gives you an opportunity to learn some easy moves at your own rate.",1137974400,,530,4.207920792079208
2068758,5,B00028G6FI,"I own a TON of exercise videos and I've been to the classes at the gyms, etc.  I do have a dance background, as well, so I'm picky about good dance-oriented workout tapes... but this one ROCKS!  It has a few cheesy moments but I actually find it challenging, even when I have the steps down, and entertaining.  I think it has a pretty well constructed break-down, as well.  I also believe beginners can get this.  There aren't too many moves in it that would make anyone feel like they have 2 left feet or anything.  The fact that it's broken down into 10-minute intervals allowing you to do them individually or together is terrific, too.  It has great moves and provides a nice cardio workout!!!",1137715200,3,697,4.484126984126984
2068759,1,B00028G6FI,I purchased the DVD hoping for a fun and easy way to excersice. I found the video hard to follow. And I quickly gave up !!  It was a waste of my money.,1137542400,5,151,3.5757575757575757
2068760,5,B00028G6FI,"I found the routines difficult to follow at first, but after about 3 times through I was able to have a lot of fun with this dvd and get a decent workout.  The best thing about it is that because it is a bit more complex, it doesn't get boring.  On the down side:  it is not conducive to carpet unless you are willing to be barefoot.  Also, despite that I wasn't particularly in shape when I started, it only began to get my heartrate in target range after I learned the routines well enough to put maximum energy/intensity into it.

So that you know where I'm coming from:  I have not done regular cardio exercise for more than a month at a time for about 2 years, and when I bought this video I had been on a 6-month hiatus from cardio, just doing pilates.  Also, I am not trained in dance at all and have only taken a couple of dance aerobics classes in my life.",1137283200,5,865,4.113095238095238
2068768,5,B00028G6FI,"I purchased this workout about a year ago, and it is STILL number one on my list...after trying out about 3 others since then. I've been a dancer for 11 years, and it's hard to find a great dance workout...minus all the ""cheesiness"". This one is GREAT; you forget that you're working out at all.

The DVD offers 3 workouts...plus a bouns workout that's more for advanced dancers. The music on this workout is catchy, and matches the moves well. (I found that this helps you remember the steps!) The instructor breaks the steps down, and you get plenty of chances to get it right...the routines are repeated 3 times through at the end of each workout.

Each workout is timed to 10 minutes, and there's a timer in the bottom right hand of your screen so you can see your progress. This is perfect, because you can do one, two, or all three workouts and know exactly how much time you need. (I do one in the morning before work sometimes to get me going...hey, it's only 10 minutes!)

These workouts are very effective for beginners to get your heart pumping and get some tone in your muscles. It's also great cardio for the more advanced.

You get what you put in...so, the harder you dance, the better!",1136419200,9,1201,4.470319634703197

2068770,1,B00028G6FI,"For some reason I thought the moves would be easy to follow.....so not the case! The instructor gives you a ""lifeline"" move for you to follow if you get confused, and she shows you only once. So I would get frustrated and try to do the ""lifeline"" move, but I could not remember what it was. If I wanted to get my heartrate up, I just  jumped in place and watched the instructor dance all over the screen. It was not much fun that way. For those of you who have not had much dance experience, save yourself the money and buy yourself a jump rope! You will get a better workout!",1135641600,7,576,4.142857142857143
2068771,1,B00028G6FI,"I am kind of shocked to see so many good reviews about this video.  I took a hip-hop dance class at my gym and when my instructor left, I decided to buy this video.  Within the first 5 minutes I noticed the moves were kind of cheesy and from the early 90's even though the video was made in 2004.  It also sounded like the director just picked a beat from the keyboard instead of using any kind of real dance music.  Not only did the video have pretty bad music and moves but also the girls in the video had these big annoying smiles that made it even harder to take the cheesy dance moves seriously.

Since I spent the ten bucks I decided to give it a spin anyway.  I had to put the DVD on slow motion because they don't go over the foot moves very well and a lot of the time they're moving the camera around and only focusing on the waist up while the girls are putting all the moves together.  After the second time watching the video in slow motion and the third time watching the video normally, I started to get some of the moves down.  To this day I find it hard to follow along with the video and I'm not a beginner.  So basically, even if I wanted to dance around looking like a fool doing cheesy early 90's moves, it was very difficult to get the moves down.  I'm kind of surprised quick fix had such a bad video and that they're still selling it.  I have their cardio kick video and it's great.

I don't recommend this hip-hop video.  I have taken classes and this video is nothing like them.  Don't waste your money.",1135641600,14,1528,4.118243243243243
2068772,5,B00028G6FI,"I was wary of this one at first, because I'd tried the ""Urban Heat: Hip Hop Workout"" from Tru 2 Form, and it was lousy!  Quick Fix is a whole different ballgame though.

The moves are fun and challenging.  The video features three 10-minute workouts.  I like a 30 minute aerobic workout, so I do all three segments in a session, one after the other.  I'm already sweating profusely when I finish the first segment, so I can say with certainty that doing one or two of these quick workouts at a time will also get the heart pumping.

The moves are a lot of fun, and the instructor breaks them down quite well, especially considering the limited time period.  They are a bit complex, but, as my fellow aerobics lovers know, this makes the workout interesting and exciting.  Stick with it, and you will learn all the moves sooner than you think!  The music is a little mechanical, but it's still funky, and the camera work is good.

I highly recommend this video.  Try it; you will not regret it!",1129852800,7,993,4.430939226519337

The moves are tricky, but they look great and I think with a bit of work you could pick them up. The girls look fantastic, their clothes are funky and the DVD is in short 10 minute sections so if you get bored like me, there really is no time to lose interest. I will continue to revisit it as I want to do the dances, and even if you do stuff up like I did, your heart rate still keeps going.",1128643200,11,495,3.6792452830188678
2068774,5,B00028G6FI,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to anyone who wants to shape up in a fun way! It was my first home workout DVD ever and at first I was intimidated by all the moves, but because the instructor is so clear and good at cueing, each dance workout took about a week to learn. To me, this is pretty good because I have no previous dance experience at all. I did all three workouts plus the bonus workout track everyday for about two months. It's a great way to work up a sweat and learn how to dance! The camera work is professional and the lighting is bright and the studio is spacious. The music stays subtle (it's mostly there to keep your rhythm) and the background dancers inspire you to find your own style.

Each routine lasts 10 minutes. The first workout is basic hip hop moves. I used it as a warm up session. The second workout is more MC Hammer style moves, and a little more intense. The third workout is modern/old-school styled dancing and gives the best workout. The bonus workout is dance-party style and also rather intense. All four routines are excellent to get your muscles pumping, but it's up to you how much you put into it -- the better you know the moves, the more intense the workout becomes. The instructor never looses her breath regardless of the intensity of the movements, (she also gives just enough encouragement plus adds some humor along the way) and the two backup dancers keep up equally well. I learned the first routine thoroughly before I moved onto the next, and just added more moves as the days passed by. I think it's a wonderful way to get your daily exercise. Because of this first workout DVD, I've been inspired to continue home workouts.",1126828800,26,1668,4.4868421052631575
2068775,4,B00028G6FI,"I enjoy this workout DVD. Each workout is only 10 minutes, so I like to add it to the end of some of my more tedious workouts. It gives me a little extra boost while my heart rate is still up, but it's not too strenuous that I don't want to do it. It did take a few viewings before I could get the routine down and not feel completely lost. I also wish that at the end of each workout we would do the entire dance routine more than just two times. In spite of that, the workouts are quick and fun... Although my husband walked in on me today and laughed his head off crying ""Look at those white girls!

2068776,2,B00028G6FI,"I used to take hip hop classes and I was a decent if average dancer.  When my instructor moved away I bought this video.

1. This is a workout video.  If you watch it over and over you will get the moves down but

2. You may not want to watch it over and over because the music is too out of date and electronic.  The instructors voice is friendly but much too sqeaky.

3. The general design of the videeo is weak.  The costumes are ugly, the sounds uninspiring, and the setting just generally dull.  I think the quickfix idea works really well in the other videos especially kickboxing, but it does not work well for hip hop.

4. Buy a workout video or take a dance class but don't waste your time and money on a boring workout video masquerading as a dance class.",1124928000,15,765,4.184931506849315

However, all workouts are fun and challenging.  I am not very coordinated but the exercises are not hard to follow and with practice I see my moves are getting better.  I look forward into doing these exercises everyday and with my history, that is an accomplishment!  I have several VHS and DVDs collected over the years, and as a physical therapist, I feel I have chosen the right ones for me.

Yes, it was difficult for me; however, I've learned over the years that with repetition, repetition, repetition I can learn just about anything.  I think her moves are extemely fun!

I'll probably do this one twice a week when I can't get to the pool or to a boxing class. She's chipper but not obnoxiously so. This would be 40 minutes with the bonus workout so that's pretty good. I'd have given this 5 stars if they'd had a warm-up/cool-down section and some bonus ab-work or something, cos you know girlfriend did not get those abs just from doing this workout! So be warned that you might want to do your own 10 minute stretching before you jump into the DVD workouts themselves. i'd love to see more fun hip-hop DVDs like this but they're either poorly instructed or pure cheese.

It helps that each of the dancers in the video has their own style and they all make it look so easy (which is a goal for me). I thought it didn't have enough arm workouts but the day after, I'm usually sore in the arms so you'd be surprised. The only drawback is your abs aren't getting much of a workout. I'd say mostly arms legs (calves). But the time just flies when you're doing it and before you know, you're breaking a sweat and it's already been half an hour!

If she would teach in 1/2 tempo a few times & practice each finished move several times before learning the next, it would keep the heart rate up, easier to follow. Yes, there'd be less moves, but least you could keep up & work more on the details rather then being lost on the basic move itself.
The moves are old school, cool & well known, not too watered down, but also then calls for more practice.

Juliane does a great job of teaching you the steps and then quickly building the whole routine up so you don't get bored. The time goes by so quickly. There are 3 ten minute segments plus a 10 minute bonus workout. I'd say this is a good intermediate workout. By making the moves a little bigger, you can get an even greater workout. She's upbeat without being silly. I used to try dance at the local health club. I thought I couldn't dance. Now that I can plug the DVD in anytime I want, and I don't have to drive anywhere, I can workout more often and I can easily pick up the steps within the 3rd try. I had fun getting the routines down.

I've done all three routines about 20 times or so and just discovered last night that there is another bonus routine.  So there is a total of 40 minutes of FUN workout and then more if you want to replay one of the routines.  I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who is young at heart, who loves music and who wants to get into shape.",1106697600,13,625,4.081967213114754

I put this DVD in and was amazed by her moves but I found her going fast and the moves hard to pick up. They were moves that I never did in aerobics class. I feel this is a very trendy aerobics class. The younger folks will love the dance like moves, but for me, I'll stick with Kathy Smith.",1105488000,,428,3.875
2068804,5,B00028G6FI,"I always love dance style workouts, but have been disappointed in the past. I've pretty much given up until I happened upon the QuickFix Hip Hop on cable TV (Comcast on-demand fitness section). The workout is broken up into 3 segments... and you can do one or all of them depending on how much sweat (or time) you can afford. It's so great that I am buying the DVD after swearing off fitness videos.",1105488000,10,399,4.405405405405405
2068805,5,B00028G6FI,"The instructor, Juliane Arney, is excellent. She demonstrates and describes the dance moves well. It did take me some time to learn the steps, but once you do it is alot of FUN. I wear a heart rate monitor when I work out. This workout does get your heart rate up for a great cardio workout.",1103414400,16,291,4.214285714285714
2068806,4,B00028G6FI,"OKAY.. I WAS LEARNING NEW DANCE MOVES THAT I WONT GET CAUGHT IN A CLUB DOING, BUT I WOULD IN A MUSIC VIDEO. I LIKED IT.  I WISH THAT THE ROUTINES WOULD BE A LITTLE LONGER FOR MY MONEY.  IT IS FUN TO DO EVERYDAY. NOW WHAT PEOPLE DONT SAY IS IF THEY LOSE WEIGHT OR TONE TO THIS VIDEO.  I WILL WRITE AGAIN IN 2 MONTHS AND LET REVIEWERS KNOW.",1101168000,5,338,3.732394366197183

even if you really want to learn hip hop.
I'm not going to say its easy but it's truly
fantastic teaching",1504310400,,141,4.2592592592592595

Easy to follow.  Might have to do it a few times before you get the hang of it, but it's always fun.",1453334400,,263,4.019230769230769
8023925,3,B00028G6FI,"I just didn't feel this one. I couldn't get into it. I'm not sure if it's because I didn't care for the instructor or what, but I just don't go for this video.",1451433600,,159,3.8484848484848486
8023926,5,B00028G6FI,This dvd makes me want to work out. It's not so much exercise to me since its dancing. And I love that. Easy to follow and like.,1428192000,,128,3.7777777777777777

8023930,5,B00028G6FI,"I've owned this video for years and I still use it a couple of times a month when I'm bored with my conventional treadmill & kickboxing routine.  Unlike other dance ""workouts"" this one will actually make you sweat right from the beginning so it's not a waste of good workout time.  The dance moves are fun and relatively challenging.  They do a good job breaking it down and it doesn't feel like a workout because the choreography is interesting enough to keep you engaged in the dance. Worth the money.",1393200000,,503,4.566666666666666
8023931,2,B00028G6FI,"I am a dancer, and this dvd was pretty boring. I only did it a few times. Not the greatest workout either. Meh, I sold it to half price books. Nothing like Zumba or other dance based workouts.",1382486400,,192,4.078947368421052
