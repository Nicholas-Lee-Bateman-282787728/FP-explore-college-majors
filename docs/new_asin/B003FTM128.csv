8396181,5,B003FTM128,"Thanks to Popcornflix, if it wasn't for them, I would've never seen or heard of this movie. The Toy Warrior was awesome from start to finish. I was not expecting it to be as awesome as it was. I was more than pleasantly surprised. It had a good story to it & was NEVER boring. The animation was nicely done as well. If somebody asked me what my favorite part of the movie was I honestly couldn't say. I enjoyed it all. I can't believe some TV/Movie Exec. hasn't turned The Toy Warrior into a cartoon show, done a sequel or 2 or 3, (If they ever did turn it into a cartoon show or sequel, I most definitely would watch) started a toy line/merchandising & whatever else you can possibly can think of. It's way too underrated & should be more well known than it is. I hope somebody from the entertainment industry will come along & rediscover this movie. I would highly recommend The Toy Warrior to anybody & everybody. It's a GREAT movie for people of ALL ages from kids to adults. If you ever get an opportunity to watch The Toy Warrior, don't miss your chance",1492041600,,1059,4.3
