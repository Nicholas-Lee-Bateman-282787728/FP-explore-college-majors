3147585,5,B0015VQB0G,I really like this dvd!!  I was looking for a more advanced workout and I found it with this.  Christi does a great job with cueing you and keeping you motivated throughout this video.  She has some good tunes for you to work out to and some great moves to go with it.  Your legs will feel the burn with this one for sure.  This also has one of the best abdominal workouts out there.  I know this is sculpting me!  I really recommend this one a lot.  It is in my top 5 list of exercise dvds right now for sure.  Give it a try!,1229817600,3,526,3.8867924528301887
3147586,4,B0015VQB0G,"The choreography in this workout is simple enough for anyone to handle, but segments are short enough that the user doesn't get bored doing the same thing again and again.  The moves are fun and really get the heart pumping and the muscles burning.  I like the variety of music, and I just love Christi's happy/perky/fun personality.",1229731200,,333,4.824561403508772
3147587,5,B0015VQB0G,I've never done an excercise video before and was a little nervous. But I LOVE THIS VIDEO!!! Christi explains everything very well.,1228608000,,131,5.0
3147588,5,B0015VQB0G,"Love it.  Much better than the junk ""Name"" fitness stars are putting out.  Glad I bought it and use it often.",1220313600,2,109,4.142857142857143
3147589,5,B0015VQB0G,This was my first Christi Taylor video. I have read many times about how wonderful she cues. I found it to be very true! This DVD was lots of fun with a great variety of music. I am not exactly coordinated when it comes to stepping but I could do this. I can't wait to do it again! I am glad that I didn't wait until Amazon's release.,1215216000,3,334,3.926470588235294
3147590,5,B0015VQB0G,"Time after time, she shows why she is the master. Every DVD I get of hers is just great and this one is no exception. High energy, informative, cute as heck, sweet, knows her stuff, fresh moves...I could go on and on. But I think you get the point. YOu can not go wrong with this one. It's for the ages. Fun and it gets the job done! I'm sooo happy with it! Keep it up Christi! Amazon needs to get this out already!",1213315200,9,415,3.9523809523809526
3147591,5,B0015VQB0G,Christi never disappoints. Her workouts are the most fun and creative workouts I've ever done and I've been using exercise videos regularly since 1992. She's simply the best. Nothing else need be said.,1207958400,15,201,5.121212121212121
3147592,5,B0015VQB0G,"I can't for the life of me, work out why Amazon aren't releasing this till October of this year when it's already available online elsewhere and I bought a copy already.
I've said it before and again today - Christi is probably one of the top 3 instructors ever.  She is amazing and always high energy while staying friendly, motivating and makes you want to move.  She knows her stuff, cues better than anyone I've ever seen, and gets your heart rate up with her unique and brilliant choreography.  It's low impact, but the choreography is definately something you'll need to keep practising before you get the hang of it.  Trust me - it's worth it.
There are intervals again in this dvd and they all feature different songs and exercise styles.  I love her latin hip swings and v-sit jacks.  She makes exercise fun because her moves are fresh and different.  I can honestly say that I've never done exercises to the Sugar Plum Fairy from the Nutcracker.
I can't speak highly enough of this workout.  Christi is my absolute favourite and you can't help but get hooked on the high energy pace of the workout.  Before you know it, you've done the whole routine and had a blast (and a fat blast).  Don't wait for Amazon - go get a copy elsewhere and begin this right away.  It's so much fun - you'll love it.",1206230400,33,1306,4.468354430379747
3147593,5,B0015VQB0G,I love-love-love to watch Christi Taylor and her power body because she and it are indeed completely fit to dance.,1386028800,,114,4.75
3147594,5,B0015VQB0G,"This is an excellent workout. I really like Christi Taylor's videos in general. Good workout, excellent queuing and interesting choreography. While I eventually get bored of other videos - it doesn't happen with Christi's.",1385856000,,222,5.5588235294117645
3147595,5,B0015VQB0G,"I am just so estatic that I found Christi's video. I lived in New York back in 2011 and Christi's video was given as a treat from time warner cable in their free on demand sportskool channel. I would put on Christi's video everyday for about two weeks and actually lost about 9 pounds. I sweat throughout the whole video and the dance moves are very upbeat, modern and fun. It took me about 3 days to fully get the dance moves down pact and once I did, the rest was history. Since I moved from New York, I thought all hope was lost. I no longer had the luzury of time warner cable's gift to me. I recently found this video at target and immediately rushed to my trusty amazon account. I saved my life! thankyou christi for this video, you're the best! :)",1379635200,,754,4.206896551724138
3147596,4,B0015VQB0G,This video is great. I have to take breaks during it because it is intense but it gets the calories burning in a fun way If you're like me and you like dancing but hate the treadmill to get in shape this is the video for you. It tones the body to get fit but still remain womanly. I would def recommend. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because some of the floor exercises are difficult and i find myself filling in the time with an easier version but other than that it's great.,1369958400,,479,3.948453608247423
3147597,3,B0015VQB0G,"I found the workout okay - a little rough to follow at time, but the instructor is clear that you need to watch it a few times.  The sitting routines are pretty fun and great on the step.  Never did these moves before, and they made me sore the next day.  It's fine, but not the best.  Cheesy music and scripting.",1363478400,,313,4.081967213114754
3147598,3,B0015VQB0G,I bought this for my sister and she loves it. It gives her a good workout. It came right on time when they said it would.,1341878400,,121,3.6923076923076925
3147599,4,B0015VQB0G,"I love Christi's Fit to Dance workout! She makes it a lot of fun and great routines throughout.  I do wish she would do another workout DVD more towards a Jazzercise type atmosphere; I can't find any jazzercise related workout dvd's out there, they are all really old and all seem to be renamed as 'dance'.  I would buy it in a second if Christi came out with a jazzercise type workout dvd! :)",1336953600,,393,4.297297297297297
3147600,5,B0015VQB0G,"This is a great workout to have in your collection. I get bored easily if I'm stuck doing the same thing too often, but this DVD is one of my favorites. No one cues better than Christi and she is also very polite. As a contrast, I have a couple of Jillian Michaels DVD's as well and I find her personality somewhat abrasive. This DVD is mainly step-aerobics with some dance moves added in, but all of the moves are choreographed and timed to the music, so because I'm able to keep the beat and move with the music it feels like dancing... which makes it fun for me and helps me to want to keep at it and keep coming back to this workout. I'm not a huge fan of the music but it all has a beat I can move to, and like others have said, Christi does sing along a few times, but no more than one sentance of the song... so I don't find it bothersome at all. There's a couple of modules that are ab work on the floor or on your step, and a few other modules that you do some arm work with weights while doing some kind of basic foot work throughout.
There's a couple spots of tricky choreography, but as many times as I've done this video I have either eventually picked it up, or just found a way to do something else that still keeps me on pace with what they're actually doing. There's one spot where they're doing grapevines and she adds in some arm movements that I've never been able to get for some reason... oh well, I just move my arms however I feel like it and it works all the same!
As a note about myself, I have a bmi of <22, but I'm not particularly ""fit"". I sometimes don't use a step because I don't own one, so when I do I just use some found object around the house (a cinder block has worked a few times, ha!). I've never had any trouble following the foot work either way, and I just try and compensate for not using a step by stepping high. I use 2 or 3 pound weights and I always do the whole DVD start to finish, which is a little over an hour long.",1329955200,,1968,3.99746192893401
3147601,4,B0015VQB0G,"Bored with all your workouts? This one is a little of everything in 5 minute chunks. You can do as much or as little as you like. It is a good length (1 hr and 15 minutes), you aren't cooling down as soon as the heart rate starts to go up. A bench and weights are required. If you don't have a bench, modifications are a little awkward, and there is no one modeling the moves without it. One big problem, Christi sings OFTEN and BADLY. Definitely put other music on after you've watched it a couple of times! (Sorry, Christi!)",1321056000,2,526,4.217821782178218
3147602,5,B0015VQB0G,I loved Christi's basic step video and wanted something a bit more difficult. At first I thought I would never catch on. I did not give up and now this is the workout I look forward to the most!,1318291200,,194,4.0
3147603,5,B0015VQB0G,I found this to be a great cardio workout.  It is not all dancing but has dance elements in all of the moves which are started slowly with additional elements added so that you don't immediately get lost.  I admit I had a few problems following some of the steps the first time but by the 3rd time I had them down.,1302048000,,314,4.048387096774194
3147604,5,B0015VQB0G,"I LOVE this Power Body workout.  It makes me smile while I'm sweating bullets!  The high/low circuits are the perfect mix.  I can catch my breath after a 15 minute high intensity aerobic circuit while I'm using weights during the lower intensity segments.  I did step aerobics in my 30's.  I'm now in my late 50's and it's still fun.  Christi Taylor keeps the cues coming to help learn the step routine and stay in time.  After two frustrating days of trying to get the dance steps, I don't have the hip-hop down but I feel the beat and it's fun everytime.

Don't get me wrong this is a helluva workout but the music and the intervals keep you wanting to come back.",1289865600,,665,4.349593495934959
3147605,2,B0015VQB0G,"I was very disappointed because I was looking for a dance workout. This is more like step aerobics with some dance moves occasionally. Plus, the music was not very motivating- I mean, I know we're getting close to Christmas, but ""The Nutcracker?"" Really? It does offer a total body routine, but definitely not a dance workout. I'll be looking for another video.",1289779200,4,361,4.838709677419355
3147606,5,B0015VQB0G,I bought this based on reviews and totally agree it is the best DVD I've tried and best workout ever. She manages to stretch you to your maximum capacity but not exhaust you. Just when you think you can't take it it changes. She gets your heart rate up very fast and makes it interesting with 5 minute intervals. 65 minutes is long enough but you can make it shorter easily but choosing your 5 minute segments. The best thing about it is it feels like you have exercised every muscle in your body.,1283990400,,497,4.297872340425532
3147607,5,B0015VQB0G,"Okay, so I LOVE it! This is my first Christi Taylor video and I think she is very good. The music is super fun and makes you want to dance! The first time I viewed it, I thought there was no way I'd be able to go through the whole thing. Then I tried it, and it was totally do-able! Admitedly I am a beginner/intermediate, so for some moves I have found that doing the low-impact version enables me to actually complete the video. As of right now I am omitting only one of the 5 minute sections so that I am not completely BEAT when I am done. She has a good warm-up, followed by a good mix of cardio, then weights, then cardio, then weights, then cardio, then crunches and the like... I love the crunches! Wow! And the ""jumping jacks"" while sitting are OUCH! Great video, it keeps me coming back. When I'm done I feel fit and toned. I definitely recommend it.",1281225600,,860,4.186746987951807
3147608,5,B0015VQB0G,"Terrific workout. Moves are kind of old school step and floor aerobics in themselves - it's just how Christi choreographs them that makes it interesting. I found her very likeable, and she cues VERY well. The music is just ok for me but has a strong beat throughout - even the ""Sugar Plum Fairy"" routine. Be prepared to move fast! I didn't find the choreography too difficult but it takes 2-3 times to get it down for some sections (13 in all; 70 mins), although you can do it from the start if you are happy to just miss a few things. The whole point is to keep your heart rate up, so it doesn't matter if you do it perfectly or not - although it gets more enjoyable as you manage to keep up. It's an interval routine, so cardio followed by strength throughout. Every part of the body gets targeted here, but to say you work hard it's actually really enjoyable to sweat this much! Some people are critical of the very fast arm movements (bicep and tricep) with the fast moving step work, and yes, you do have to be careful not to overextend - you can also just skip as many of those as you like, or just don't use weights. A music only option is always good too. You can also start it anywhere - although once started it just keeps on going through the rest of the workout, but just hit the menu buttton when that happens, as it's obvious when she's moving on to the next section. Very good value esp. now that Amazon just dropped the price. I'm already looking to get other routines...very different and refreshing!",1280966400,,1517,4.326315789473684
3147609,5,B0015VQB0G,"I can really recommend this dvd! I bought this dvd based on the many positive reviews here, and now that I've done it regularly for the past weeks, I can honestly say I agree with all of them! Christi has a fresh personality and an enthusiasm that's very motivating (I actually like her singing along), the moves are fun, versatile, flowing and very effective, the music is great, and because of the interval set up of the dvd you are finished before you know it, yet you work much longer and harder than with other dvd's.
I would like to praise one more thing that is important to me, and problably to anyone doing an exercise dvd at home: I live in a small and noisy apartment and so I can't get into really loud, banging exercise, because my neighbours wouldn't appreciate it. But I can do the exercises of this dvd easily without making much noise, yet I still get a great cardio workout, as well as a great weight-training.
All in all, a really great exercise dvd, so to anyone hesitating: you will not regret buying this one!",1278115200,,1031,4.431578947368421
3147610,2,B0015VQB0G,"I purchased this video based on the rave reviews and was very disappointed.
The video was very repetative and boring.  I was looking for a video for advanced fitness that would be fun and different from other interval videos such as the Firm videos.  I found the routines to be very boring and in many of the intervals I didn't even break a sweat.  It is very frustrating, because I was really looking forward to this video.  I do not recommend this video to anyone who is serious about getting trim and losing weight.",1277424000,3,518,4.4787234042553195
3147611,5,B0015VQB0G,Just like being in a class.  Great instructor and easy to follow with a super workout (even without a step although the step would make it better).,1277337600,,147,4.444444444444445
3147612,5,B0015VQB0G,"This is a fantastic workout.  Dripping sweat, feel good type of workout.  Christi does a great job at cuing you of upcoming moves and changes.  This isn't one of those videos that you need to do a few times to learn the routine and get a good workout.  You sweat...a lot...from the very first use.  I have a weak wrist from breaking it when I was young so there is a segment that I can't do where you need to hold yourself up by placing your hands on your step while doing pelvic raises.  This does hurt my wrist so I just skip that segment (approx. 5 minutes).  You can do the whole routine - approx. 70 minutes - or you can pick a certain routine from the menu.

I highly recommend this video for the intermediate to advanced workout.  It's really fun and an excellent workout.  If you would like to see a glimpse of this video, go to (...) and watch the clip.",1268438400,,862,4.16969696969697
3147613,4,B0015VQB0G,"I haven't done this workout but once, because I don't have a step yet.  I did it without the step and it was workable, but obviously it would be better with.  Christi is pleasant, and unlike some other reviewers, I don't find her singing along to be bothersome.  It's a good solid workout.  I think I probably have some others that get my heartrate up better, but maybe with a step and a little more effort I could improve that, too.  The music is pleasant.  Though not my genre, it's not offensive.  All in all, I would recommend this video.  I try to keep variety in my workouts, so I have a lot of videos that I alternate.  I will definitely enjoy using this one.",1262822400,3,666,4.264
3147614,5,B0015VQB0G,I am pretty active and was looking for a workout DVD that would challenge me.  This is an awesome workout and fun as well.  It took several times before I was able to keep up and learn the moves but I enjoy every moment of it.,1258156800,,226,3.891304347826087
3147615,5,B0015VQB0G,"I love this dvd, I love its in 5 mins interval.  I was looking for a workout I could have fun doing, and this one is it.  Moves are fun and make you feel sexy :-)",1256601600,,162,3.4722222222222223

3147617,5,B0015VQB0G,"I have been working out to step aerobic tapes for about a year now, and I have viewed many different videos by many different instructors.  Christi is definitely my favorite and this is my favorite of her workouts.

I've read people who criticize her for creating too complicated of workouts, and even for her singing while she's working out.  Yes, her choreography can be challenging, but that's part of the fun.  Her workouts are just like everyone else's, and I find myself forgetting that I'm working out, because both my body and my mind are fully engaged.  And the singing is just part of her fun personality.  The fact that she can sing while she's doing aerobics shows me how good of shape she's in.

When I first found her my comment after watching her workout was ""Yeah, right.  As if I could ever do that.""  Then something made me take the time to watch the video all the way through, and then spend some time learning it instead of just expecting that I could do it without much practice.  And I am so glad I did.  I now find that I can just about do her workouts all the way through by practicing using her MoveMaster portion and then trying the workout.

This video is an absolute blast, and an absolute workout.  Her workouts are more dance than exercise, but I don't feel silly doing them like I have with some other dance-oriented workouts.  And this one is the sexiest (in a good way), most fun of all that I've seen.  And if you like this one, you should try her Totally Cool Step, which is my second favorite.

I can't wait to see what she does next!",1249862400,3,1570,4.380622837370242
3147618,5,B0015VQB0G,"I recently became enamored with step workouts, and I bought this as my first ""real"" step workout.  Boy, am I glad I did.  This is 70 minutes of pure fun!  While it may not be as intense as I would like it to be, I definitely feel like I worked out after doing this DVD.  Also, what really made me LOVE this DVD was this:  I looked down at the timer on my DVD player during the workout, and realized I had been working out for 40 minutes--and it only felt like 10 minutes!

I think the reason for this ""long workout going by fast"" feeling is that Christi does interval training--some cardio, some weights, etc.  There are lots of moves, and she starts out with basic moves, and adds on to them.  This being my first step workout, I was very focused on getting down those moves.  And since I am not the most coordinated person in the world, I really had to focus!

Here's the breakdown:

GOOD:

--Lots of variety in the moves
--The ab workout at the end is very simple, but very effective
--Christi's cueing is right on target.  Although there were times when I was having a little too much fun and wasn't listening to her cues.
--Even though I stumbled through some of the more complex cardio/step moves, they weren't so difficult that you couldn't pick up the next set of moves, or start over with the next interval.
--You have fun the whole time.
--Has people in the back doing modified moves with lighter weights.

BAD:

--Some uncoordinated people (like myself) may give up early on because they can't get the moves
--The parts of the workouts with the weights is a little dicey. . you're doing dance moves with the weights, and if you're trying to get the legwork down, you may end up swinging the weights wildly and injure yourself.  Use very light weights or no weights at all if you're new to stepping the first few times through. Christi uses 5 pound weights; the modifiers use 3 lb weights.
--This is a personal preference for me, but I could have done without Christi singing to the music.

Overall, I was impressed with this workout.  I think it wasn't intense enough for me the first time through because I was tripping over my poor feet some of the time; I am sure the next few times through I'll get better.  (My heart rate was up more during the weight segments than during the cardio sometimes.)  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good step workout led by a very good instructor.",1240099200,8,2406,4.400452488687783

3382088,5,B0015VQB0G,Christi never disappoints. Her workouts are the most fun and creative workouts I've ever done and I've been using exercise videos regularly since 1992. She's simply the best. Nothing else need be said.,1207958400,15,201,5.121212121212121
3382089,5,B0015VQB0G,"I can't for the life of me, work out why Amazon aren't releasing this till October of this year when it's already available online elsewhere and I bought a copy already.
I've said it before and again today - Christi is probably one of the top 3 instructors ever.  She is amazing and always high energy while staying friendly, motivating and makes you want to move.  She knows her stuff, cues better than anyone I've ever seen, and gets your heart rate up with her unique and brilliant choreography.  It's low impact, but the choreography is definately something you'll need to keep practising before you get the hang of it.  Trust me - it's worth it.
There are intervals again in this dvd and they all feature different songs and exercise styles.  I love her latin hip swings and v-sit jacks.  She makes exercise fun because her moves are fresh and different.  I can honestly say that I've never done exercises to the Sugar Plum Fairy from the Nutcracker.
I can't speak highly enough of this workout.  Christi is my absolute favourite and you can't help but get hooked on the high energy pace of the workout.  Before you know it, you've done the whole routine and had a blast (and a fat blast).  Don't wait for Amazon - go get a copy elsewhere and begin this right away.  It's so much fun - you'll love it.",1206230400,33,1306,4.468354430379747

3382091,5,B0015VQB0G,"This is an excellent workout. I really like Christi Taylor's videos in general. Good workout, excellent queuing and interesting choreography. While I eventually get bored of other videos - it doesn't happen with Christi's.",1385856000,,222,5.5588235294117645
3382092,5,B0015VQB0G,"I am just so estatic that I found Christi's video. I lived in New York back in 2011 and Christi's video was given as a treat from time warner cable in their free on demand sportskool channel. I would put on Christi's video everyday for about two weeks and actually lost about 9 pounds. I sweat throughout the whole video and the dance moves are very upbeat, modern and fun. It took me about 3 days to fully get the dance moves down pact and once I did, the rest was history. Since I moved from New York, I thought all hope was lost. I no longer had the luzury of time warner cable's gift to me. I recently found this video at target and immediately rushed to my trusty amazon account. I saved my life! thankyou christi for this video, you're the best! :)",1379635200,,754,4.206896551724138
3382093,4,B0015VQB0G,This video is great. I have to take breaks during it because it is intense but it gets the calories burning in a fun way If you're like me and you like dancing but hate the treadmill to get in shape this is the video for you. It tones the body to get fit but still remain womanly. I would def recommend. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because some of the floor exercises are difficult and i find myself filling in the time with an easier version but other than that it's great.,1369958400,,479,3.948453608247423
3382094,3,B0015VQB0G,"I found the workout okay - a little rough to follow at time, but the instructor is clear that you need to watch it a few times.  The sitting routines are pretty fun and great on the step.  Never did these moves before, and they made me sore the next day.  It's fine, but not the best.  Cheesy music and scripting.",1363478400,,313,4.081967213114754
3382095,3,B0015VQB0G,I bought this for my sister and she loves it. It gives her a good workout. It came right on time when they said it would.,1341878400,,121,3.6923076923076925
3382096,4,B0015VQB0G,"I love Christi's Fit to Dance workout! She makes it a lot of fun and great routines throughout.  I do wish she would do another workout DVD more towards a Jazzercise type atmosphere; I can't find any jazzercise related workout dvd's out there, they are all really old and all seem to be renamed as 'dance'.  I would buy it in a second if Christi came out with a jazzercise type workout dvd! :)",1336953600,,393,4.297297297297297
3382097,5,B0015VQB0G,"This is a great workout to have in your collection. I get bored easily if I'm stuck doing the same thing too often, but this DVD is one of my favorites. No one cues better than Christi and she is also very polite. As a contrast, I have a couple of Jillian Michaels DVD's as well and I find her personality somewhat abrasive. This DVD is mainly step-aerobics with some dance moves added in, but all of the moves are choreographed and timed to the music, so because I'm able to keep the beat and move with the music it feels like dancing... which makes it fun for me and helps me to want to keep at it and keep coming back to this workout. I'm not a huge fan of the music but it all has a beat I can move to, and like others have said, Christi does sing along a few times, but no more than one sentance of the song... so I don't find it bothersome at all. There's a couple of modules that are ab work on the floor or on your step, and a few other modules that you do some arm work with weights while doing some kind of basic foot work throughout.
There's a couple spots of tricky choreography, but as many times as I've done this video I have either eventually picked it up, or just found a way to do something else that still keeps me on pace with what they're actually doing. There's one spot where they're doing grapevines and she adds in some arm movements that I've never been able to get for some reason... oh well, I just move my arms however I feel like it and it works all the same!
As a note about myself, I have a bmi of <22, but I'm not particularly ""fit"". I sometimes don't use a step because I don't own one, so when I do I just use some found object around the house (a cinder block has worked a few times, ha!). I've never had any trouble following the foot work either way, and I just try and compensate for not using a step by stepping high. I use 2 or 3 pound weights and I always do the whole DVD start to finish, which is a little over an hour long.",1329955200,,1968,3.99746192893401
3382098,4,B0015VQB0G,"Bored with all your workouts? This one is a little of everything in 5 minute chunks. You can do as much or as little as you like. It is a good length (1 hr and 15 minutes), you aren't cooling down as soon as the heart rate starts to go up. A bench and weights are required. If you don't have a bench, modifications are a little awkward, and there is no one modeling the moves without it. One big problem, Christi sings OFTEN and BADLY. Definitely put other music on after you've watched it a couple of times! (Sorry, Christi!)",1321056000,2,526,4.217821782178218
3382099,5,B0015VQB0G,I loved Christi's basic step video and wanted something a bit more difficult. At first I thought I would never catch on. I did not give up and now this is the workout I look forward to the most!,1318291200,,194,4.0
3382100,5,B0015VQB0G,I found this to be a great cardio workout.  It is not all dancing but has dance elements in all of the moves which are started slowly with additional elements added so that you don't immediately get lost.  I admit I had a few problems following some of the steps the first time but by the 3rd time I had them down.,1302048000,,314,4.048387096774194
3382101,5,B0015VQB0G,"I LOVE this Power Body workout.  It makes me smile while I'm sweating bullets!  The high/low circuits are the perfect mix.  I can catch my breath after a 15 minute high intensity aerobic circuit while I'm using weights during the lower intensity segments.  I did step aerobics in my 30's.  I'm now in my late 50's and it's still fun.  Christi Taylor keeps the cues coming to help learn the step routine and stay in time.  After two frustrating days of trying to get the dance steps, I don't have the hip-hop down but I feel the beat and it's fun everytime.

Don't get me wrong this is a helluva workout but the music and the intervals keep you wanting to come back.",1289865600,,665,4.349593495934959
3382102,2,B0015VQB0G,"I was very disappointed because I was looking for a dance workout. This is more like step aerobics with some dance moves occasionally. Plus, the music was not very motivating- I mean, I know we're getting close to Christmas, but ""The Nutcracker?"" Really? It does offer a total body routine, but definitely not a dance workout. I'll be looking for another video.",1289779200,4,361,4.838709677419355
3382103,5,B0015VQB0G,I bought this based on reviews and totally agree it is the best DVD I've tried and best workout ever. She manages to stretch you to your maximum capacity but not exhaust you. Just when you think you can't take it it changes. She gets your heart rate up very fast and makes it interesting with 5 minute intervals. 65 minutes is long enough but you can make it shorter easily but choosing your 5 minute segments. The best thing about it is it feels like you have exercised every muscle in your body.,1283990400,,497,4.297872340425532
3382104,5,B0015VQB0G,"Okay, so I LOVE it! This is my first Christi Taylor video and I think she is very good. The music is super fun and makes you want to dance! The first time I viewed it, I thought there was no way I'd be able to go through the whole thing. Then I tried it, and it was totally do-able! Admitedly I am a beginner/intermediate, so for some moves I have found that doing the low-impact version enables me to actually complete the video. As of right now I am omitting only one of the 5 minute sections so that I am not completely BEAT when I am done. She has a good warm-up, followed by a good mix of cardio, then weights, then cardio, then weights, then cardio, then crunches and the like... I love the crunches! Wow! And the ""jumping jacks"" while sitting are OUCH! Great video, it keeps me coming back. When I'm done I feel fit and toned. I definitely recommend it.",1281225600,,860,4.186746987951807
3382105,5,B0015VQB0G,"Terrific workout. Moves are kind of old school step and floor aerobics in themselves - it's just how Christi choreographs them that makes it interesting. I found her very likeable, and she cues VERY well. The music is just ok for me but has a strong beat throughout - even the ""Sugar Plum Fairy"" routine. Be prepared to move fast! I didn't find the choreography too difficult but it takes 2-3 times to get it down for some sections (13 in all; 70 mins), although you can do it from the start if you are happy to just miss a few things. The whole point is to keep your heart rate up, so it doesn't matter if you do it perfectly or not - although it gets more enjoyable as you manage to keep up. It's an interval routine, so cardio followed by strength throughout. Every part of the body gets targeted here, but to say you work hard it's actually really enjoyable to sweat this much! Some people are critical of the very fast arm movements (bicep and tricep) with the fast moving step work, and yes, you do have to be careful not to overextend - you can also just skip as many of those as you like, or just don't use weights. A music only option is always good too. You can also start it anywhere - although once started it just keeps on going through the rest of the workout, but just hit the menu buttton when that happens, as it's obvious when she's moving on to the next section. Very good value esp. now that Amazon just dropped the price. I'm already looking to get other routines...very different and refreshing!",1280966400,,1517,4.326315789473684
3382106,5,B0015VQB0G,"I can really recommend this dvd! I bought this dvd based on the many positive reviews here, and now that I've done it regularly for the past weeks, I can honestly say I agree with all of them! Christi has a fresh personality and an enthusiasm that's very motivating (I actually like her singing along), the moves are fun, versatile, flowing and very effective, the music is great, and because of the interval set up of the dvd you are finished before you know it, yet you work much longer and harder than with other dvd's.
I would like to praise one more thing that is important to me, and problably to anyone doing an exercise dvd at home: I live in a small and noisy apartment and so I can't get into really loud, banging exercise, because my neighbours wouldn't appreciate it. But I can do the exercises of this dvd easily without making much noise, yet I still get a great cardio workout, as well as a great weight-training.
All in all, a really great exercise dvd, so to anyone hesitating: you will not regret buying this one!",1278115200,,1031,4.431578947368421
3382107,2,B0015VQB0G,"I purchased this video based on the rave reviews and was very disappointed.
The video was very repetative and boring.  I was looking for a video for advanced fitness that would be fun and different from other interval videos such as the Firm videos.  I found the routines to be very boring and in many of the intervals I didn't even break a sweat.  It is very frustrating, because I was really looking forward to this video.  I do not recommend this video to anyone who is serious about getting trim and losing weight.",1277424000,3,518,4.4787234042553195

3382109,5,B0015VQB0G,"This is a fantastic workout.  Dripping sweat, feel good type of workout.  Christi does a great job at cuing you of upcoming moves and changes.  This isn't one of those videos that you need to do a few times to learn the routine and get a good workout.  You sweat...a lot...from the very first use.  I have a weak wrist from breaking it when I was young so there is a segment that I can't do where you need to hold yourself up by placing your hands on your step while doing pelvic raises.  This does hurt my wrist so I just skip that segment (approx. 5 minutes).  You can do the whole routine - approx. 70 minutes - or you can pick a certain routine from the menu.

I highly recommend this video for the intermediate to advanced workout.  It's really fun and an excellent workout.  If you would like to see a glimpse of this video, go to (...) and watch the clip.",1268438400,,862,4.16969696969697
3382110,4,B0015VQB0G,"I haven't done this workout but once, because I don't have a step yet.  I did it without the step and it was workable, but obviously it would be better with.  Christi is pleasant, and unlike some other reviewers, I don't find her singing along to be bothersome.  It's a good solid workout.  I think I probably have some others that get my heartrate up better, but maybe with a step and a little more effort I could improve that, too.  The music is pleasant.  Though not my genre, it's not offensive.  All in all, I would recommend this video.  I try to keep variety in my workouts, so I have a lot of videos that I alternate.  I will definitely enjoy using this one.",1262822400,3,666,4.264

3382114,5,B0015VQB0G,"I have been working out to step aerobic tapes for about a year now, and I have viewed many different videos by many different instructors.  Christi is definitely my favorite and this is my favorite of her workouts.

I've read people who criticize her for creating too complicated of workouts, and even for her singing while she's working out.  Yes, her choreography can be challenging, but that's part of the fun.  Her workouts are just like everyone else's, and I find myself forgetting that I'm working out, because both my body and my mind are fully engaged.  And the singing is just part of her fun personality.  The fact that she can sing while she's doing aerobics shows me how good of shape she's in.

When I first found her my comment after watching her workout was ""Yeah, right.  As if I could ever do that.""  Then something made me take the time to watch the video all the way through, and then spend some time learning it instead of just expecting that I could do it without much practice.  And I am so glad I did.  I now find that I can just about do her workouts all the way through by practicing using her MoveMaster portion and then trying the workout.

This video is an absolute blast, and an absolute workout.  Her workouts are more dance than exercise, but I don't feel silly doing them like I have with some other dance-oriented workouts.  And this one is the sexiest (in a good way), most fun of all that I've seen.  And if you like this one, you should try her Totally Cool Step, which is my second favorite.

I can't wait to see what she does next!",1249862400,3,1570,4.380622837370242
3382115,5,B0015VQB0G,"I recently became enamored with step workouts, and I bought this as my first ""real"" step workout.  Boy, am I glad I did.  This is 70 minutes of pure fun!  While it may not be as intense as I would like it to be, I definitely feel like I worked out after doing this DVD.  Also, what really made me LOVE this DVD was this:  I looked down at the timer on my DVD player during the workout, and realized I had been working out for 40 minutes--and it only felt like 10 minutes!

I think the reason for this ""long workout going by fast"" feeling is that Christi does interval training--some cardio, some weights, etc.  There are lots of moves, and she starts out with basic moves, and adds on to them.  This being my first step workout, I was very focused on getting down those moves.  And since I am not the most coordinated person in the world, I really had to focus!

Here's the breakdown:

GOOD:

--Lots of variety in the moves
--The ab workout at the end is very simple, but very effective
--Christi's cueing is right on target.  Although there were times when I was having a little too much fun and wasn't listening to her cues.
--Even though I stumbled through some of the more complex cardio/step moves, they weren't so difficult that you couldn't pick up the next set of moves, or start over with the next interval.
--You have fun the whole time.
--Has people in the back doing modified moves with lighter weights.

BAD:

--Some uncoordinated people (like myself) may give up early on because they can't get the moves
--The parts of the workouts with the weights is a little dicey. . you're doing dance moves with the weights, and if you're trying to get the legwork down, you may end up swinging the weights wildly and injure yourself.  Use very light weights or no weights at all if you're new to stepping the first few times through. Christi uses 5 pound weights; the modifiers use 3 lb weights.
--This is a personal preference for me, but I could have done without Christi singing to the music.

Overall, I was impressed with this workout.  I think it wasn't intense enough for me the first time through because I was tripping over my poor feet some of the time; I am sure the next few times through I'll get better.  (My heart rate was up more during the weight segments than during the cardio sometimes.)  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good step workout led by a very good instructor.",1240099200,8,2406,4.400452488687783
