531385,5,6302993644,"The second outing of the Daleks during the William Hartnell era of Doctor Who proves to be an even better story, if such a thing were possible.  Quite often, when one looks at the Daleks in later stories, the stories are dull and the Daleks make for poor adversaries.  But in many of the Hartnell/Troughton Doctor Who episodes, they are a very real threat.  Invasion is a perfect example.  The Daleks have taken over Earth in 2164.  They plan to hollow out the planet in order to use it as a craft to carry them about.  This may seem outlandish in concept, but in delivery the story packs a punch.  We are drawn into the lives of the resistance fighters and watch as they are rendered powerless by the deadly Daleks.  We see the Doctor coming to their aid and saving an entire world.  This six part episode is a must for Dalek fans, Doctor Who fans or the casual viewer.  Highly recommended.",978307200,,891,4.411042944785276
531386,3,6302993644,"An incredibly overrated Who serial and Dalek story, only because it's the second Dalek serial and it's set on Earth. The problem with this serial is that it is very, very slow going, even for a Hartnell adventure, and the Robomen(oh, my COD!)are ploddingly slow and stupid, and how the Robomen are supposed to frighten us is a question I've been asking for years. The lack of scientific credibilty is also very annoying, the Slyther(and just what the heck is ""The Waking Ally""?), uninspired acting and not enough Daleks really spoil everything.
But, there is some great things, as well. The direction & execution is very halucinatory, the Daleks running around London is fun, and their renaming of monuments and other things is way cool, and Susan has a very emotional leaving scene.",951782400,5,783,4.894736842105263
531387,4,6302993644,"I have mixed views about this production, but I feel that overall there are more positives than negatives.
I very much liked the use of future-day England as the story setting. This allowed for a lot of footage  to be shot outside of the television studios, which added visual interest.  I particularly liked the first episode with its plot build-up in the  abandoned city of London. The story also introduced a number of different  characters and sub-plots throughout the six episodes, so that the action  did not just center around the four regular cast. The physical  modifications to the Daleks, mostly done to allow filming away from the  studio also adds interest. Finally, I feel that the story has collector  value, as it is the last one featuring all four original characters. Susan  (Carole Ann Ford) left the series at the end of the last episode.
By far  the biggest disappointment for me was the lame ending. After such a long  and interesting build-up, the finale was a big let-down. It was almost as  though a team of amateurs had taken over the demise of the Daleks, or as if  someone had removed part of the story.
I saw only a few technical  problems with the filming, the most prominent being the moving motor  vehicles in the distance at Trafalgar Square and the shadow of a microphone  boom across the Tardis in one of the final scenes.
All things considered,  this is still an item worth buying. I would not however pick it over the  two other Hartnell Dalek stories available.",921369600,,1499,4.67816091954023

531430,4,6302993644,"The Dalek Invasion of Earth is a fascinating story with so many great moments. However, little of it has to do with the Daleks (although the reveal of the Daleks at the end of Episode 1 is thrilling.)

The core of the Dalek Invasion of Earth is not about the Daleks but what happens in the wake of their invasion: It's a story of resistance fighters, collaborators, and the casualties of war. The third through fifth episodes are remarkably effective as the companions are separated and each goes on their own journey through this war-torn and desperate England. Barbara (with a dispirited resistance fighter), Ian (with a man search for his brother) and Susan, who along with the Doctor travel with a young David Campbell.

The story brings the first departure from the TARDIS as Susan is allowed to grow up very quickly in this her final story. The first farewell from the TARDIS crew is beautifully done with the First Doctor's speech being one of the truly iconic moments of the classic era.

The strong character plots and war drama coupled with a couple very iconic scenes make the story's problems forgivable. The biggest problem is an ending to the Dalek plot that's practically non-sensical and very hard to follow. Still, despite that, there's a lot to commend this story. It's full of gripping and powerful moments and is a must-see story.",1439856000,,1350,4.785407725321888

531432,5,6302993644,"Probably my most favorite and the most important classic doctor who story. Hulu has most of the classic episodes from season 1 till 26, but as I was watching I noticed a HUGE story gap. This story is not on there at all. How could I keep watching without knowing this HUGE chunk of story. Honestly I never thought it would be this emotional and crucial to the rest of the series.

We see the Daleks coming to Earth, invading and taking over, the struggle for the remaining humans to regain their freedom. In the episodes leading up to this we see Susan starting to becoming bolder as a character, thinking for herself and wandering further away from the doctor. I honestly didn't see the ending coming though, it was bittersweet and yet in that exact moment I feel like the doctor we all know and love came bursting out, he took charge of the situation, knew exactly what to do, it killed him inside to let her go, but he knew it was the best thing he could do. In the next episodes he becomes more and more of the doctor, having Susan with him seemed to make him feel older, like her needed her with him to function, letting go made him realize that they both could live without each other. This storyline is SO important because you get to see HUGE character growth on everyone's part I think.

I was wonderfully shocked how many episodes there was to this story I felt like it was never going to end, it was like being a kid again watching old black and white movies with my grandmother.",1428796800,2,1490,4.356115107913669
531433,5,6302993644,"You can turn the CGI OFF!

This was very well done. I have been working my way through the early Doctors. This one, having been remastered, is missing from streaming. Since it's one of the classics, I purchased it. Even 50 years later, this is an engaging story. Many have cited this serial as the one where the Doctor becomes the Doctor, and I tend to agree. It's worth a watch.

The CGI that was added was well done. Largely it is of the ""remove the visible wires"" variety and not the ""add a gratuitous callback to a prequel"" variety. As I said, it can be turned off from the menus. I left it on.  It is also worth having to listen to Carol Anne Ford (Susan) and William Russell (Ian Chesterton) reminisce in parts of the commentary track.

All I have to say is this IS The Doctor, as much as I like Peter Cushing he ripped off William Hartnell to the nth degree!
Really, this story is a sequel to the ever popular first appearance of the Daleks in the 2nd ever story to the classic series.

For me the reason I include this as one of the best from the Hartnell era is because it's complete, it's a sequel, and it is
insofar as I feel the only surviving epic story from the 1st Doctor and it does have that epic feeling plus nice new
effects added that are blended in very well to the story... much better than even some of the newer episodes.

531493,2,6302993644,"Growing up in the United Kingdom in the 1970s and 1980s, the classic Dr. Who series was a staple part of my television diet. I didn't care about the cardboard sets and painfully lame special effects. One of my chief guilty pleasures at the time were the two Peter Cushing feature films of the 1960s that featured the character and were shown regularly on BBC2. In particular the movie of ""Daleks Invasion Earth 2150 A.D."" with its vibrant colors,  and I hoped to one day get to see the William Hartnell series on which the movie is based. Now, over three decades later that dream was realized when I saw it on DVD and the reaction - overwhelming disappointment. It's not just the shoestring budget or the low-quality black and white picture, I knew that both those would be elements in the television series. It's the plodding plot, the cringe-inducing lines and terrible acting. It's obvious comparing the two productions that the weaknesses in the series were evident to the movie makers because they excised all the superfluous elements and made a leaner and more exciting production. Having had the endure the Hartnell version (an actor I have long admired for his  non-Dr Who work), I'll stick with the Cushing version.",1391817600,2,1224,4.796208530805687
531494,4,6302993644,"If you're only going to see one first Doctor story I would recommend either this one or ""The Time Meddler."" The Daleks come to Earth in the future and it's up to the Doctor and his friends to stop them.  Fans of the current iteration of the series need to be aware that the Doctor is not as active in his first incarnation as he is in later ones, so a fair amount of the action and dramatic weight is pulled by his companions and others. But Hartnell still shines whenever he's on screen.

The effects haven't aged well, but if that's an issue for you there's an option to watch it with updated effects which can help younger fans swallow this older story. This story is full of iconic moments, from the Daleks plan (later to be referenced in by David Tennant's Doctor in ""The Stolen Earth"") to Hartnell giving a very moving farewell to a beloved companion at the end.

His ""farewell"" to Susan is just what the 11th doctor's would be. The problem with this story is that it was set too near in the future. We are now past this time and it no longer fits the history of the earth the Doctor lives in which is sad because otherwise it would be nice for the Doctor to come back and visit Susan. After all she would outlive her husband and could have regenerated into an entirely new actress.

That having been said, I would just like to say that the story is top notch, the FX in my humble opinion a little better than most Dr. Who's from that time period, but no where near today's standards.

531555,5,6302993644,"""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" may very well be the darkest of all Doctor Who episodes.  Not because of what happens; but because of when it happens.  The atmosphere is one of doom rather than foreboding, which makes it clear before the first action takes place that this is the middle, not the beginning, of the Invasion.  The Dalek Invasion is no worse than a hundred other sinister events the Doctor has encountered; it's the timing of the encounter that makes it so ominous.  The normal pattern - almost universal thoughout the Doctor Who series - has been for the Doctor to arrive just as something evil is about to happen, or has just happened.  But not this time.  The Daleks haven't just taken over London; they've been there for quite a while, and are well established, and have already destroyed or brought to ruin most of London; and have already either destroyed or enslaved most of the people.  One of Doctor Who's signature activities is somehow managing to set things right again - if not exactly as they were before the alien encounter then very close to it.  But not this time.  It's too late to set things right again; the best that can be hoped for is simply to keep things from getting even worse.  And of course he does - or, more properly, as other reviewers have pointed out, his companions do.  The Doctor is uncharacteristically inept at stopping the Dalek's in their tracks; it's Ian, and Barbara, and Susan who manage to save the day, even if the resolution stretches both science and story telling almost to the breaking point.  There's no attempt, though, to restore London to how it was before the Invasion.  When the Doctor and his companions leave at the end, they leave behind a London still in ruins, which will have to be restored slowly and painstakingly by its survivors.",1251590400,2,1807,4.644654088050315
531556,3,6302993644,"I wish I could give this one five stars, but it would be wrong of me to do so. The plot is great - the Doctor and his companions arrive in a seemingly deserted London sometime after the year 2164 only to find out that the Earth has been conquered and enslaved by the evil Daleks! But they were destroyed on Skaro in ""The Daleks"", weren't they? Nope. They have returned with a vengeance - to Earth! The Daleks have killed most of the human population and now have turned the remaining humans into either slaves or mind-controlled zombies called Robomen controlled by the evil creatures themselves. Now the Doctor and his friends must join forces with a small band of rebels to take back the planet and stop the Daleks from replacing Earth's core with a giant motor capable of turning the Earth into a massive Dalek spaceship.

Sounds good, but the story seems to drag on forever, the acting and directing is terrible, the camera work is crap, the Doctor is once again a grumpy old man who doesn't seem to do much in this story just like in ""The Daleks"", and don't even get me started on the special effects.

Fortunately, the DVD gives you an option on the special features to watch the story with new added CGI effects that greatly improve the story. The iconic location footage is great with the Daleks roaming around the very heart of London itself in front of Big Ben and other places. And the Slyther monster is a very creepy creature indeed.

In all, I would recommend this story to any true Dr. Who fan just because of the iconic nature of this story and because of the great location footage in it. But I would rather recommend the movie remake - ""Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D."", which brings Terry Nation's vision of this story truly to life.",1235433600,,1753,4.4890282131661445

531560,4,6302993644,"""The Tenth Planet"" is the only complete serial that I've seen with the original Doctor Who, William Hartnell.  I've seen him (as well as all of his companions) in snippets from the original show and in later serials featuring other Doctors.  When I heard that ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" was considered one of the greatest Who adventures of them all, I didn't hesitate to purchase this DVD as my first Hartnell serial.

The story takes place in and around London in 2164 A.D.  The Doctor, Susan (Carol Ann Ford), Ian (William Russell) and Barbara (Jacqueline Hill) land in London hoping that it's the 1960's.  Ian and Barbara are longing for home.  Unfortunately, the London they land in is well into the future and ruled by the Doctor's arch enemy:  the Daleks.  They have turned humans into slave ""Robomen"" and are forcing them to work in mines.  Why they are working in the mines, the Doctor must find out.  What it all boils down to is the Doctor and his friends joining up with a small band of rebels who are trying to thwart the Daleks plans.  Will they succeed?  You'll have to watch ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" in order to find out.

The story moves at a decent clip and there is quite a bit of violence and death throughout.  There's one major monster other than the Daleks who makes an appearance, but he doesn't play a very critical role in the story.  The special effects, as expected, are poor, but this story's success is based on its script and direction.  Richard Martin creates both tension and excellent action sequences despite a limited budget.

This is a two disc set.  The first disc is the actual serial with a few special features such as an excellent running commentary that features Ford, Russell, Martin, producer Verity Lambert, and ""Who"" authority, Gary Russell.  The second disc features numerous featurettes that range from making Dalek cakes to finding out what happened to Susan after this serial came to a close.  There's also the standard picture gallery and ""Who's Who"" feature.

On a lighter note, fans of British comedy will recognize Nicholas Smith in a small but key role as one of the rebels.  He played Mr. Rumbold on the wonderful series, ""Are You Being Served?""

This is an excellent addition to any ""Who"" collection.  I plan on grabbing more of Hartnell's work after seeing this serial.

531561,5,6302993644,"This classic Dr. Who.  I saw parts of this when I was child living in England.  To be able to see the whole story without any missing segments is very enjoyable.  To a sci-fi fan such as myself you have to look past the special effects that are not as state of the art as most offerings of this day and age.  But this is history in the making and I personally appreciate the simple quality that was so apparent in the earlier Dr. Who's. The Daleks definitely don't appear as menacing as I remember them when I saw this first in 1964...but never mind it was still great to see the show again sharing it with my 14 year old who now knows what I'm talking about when I mention ""classic Dr. Who.""

531562,4,6302993644,"Just as surely as Klaatu must land in Washington DC and Godzilla must attack Tokyo, the Daleks must invade London. Fair's fair, after all. This is indeed one of the all-time archetypal ""Doctor Who"" stories, full of iconic moments that remain in your mind's eye long after the DVD is back in its case and important in establishing the Daleks as an ever-continuing menace for the Doctor.

And they definitely seem much more menacing in a familiar Earth setting. Sure, they're nothing to sneeze at in their underground bunker on planet Skaro, but somehow seeing them gliding along past most of London's primary postcard locations (eerily deserted) and watching as they terrorize and, well, you know, exterminate ordinary earth folks who could just as well be your friends and neighbors--this really brings it all home to you (as it were). The representation of occupied Earth and its inhabitants is gritty and realistic; both the desperation and greed of the general populace and the haggard camaraderie of the small resistance force are portrayed vividly and in a convincing manner. And there are superb minor touches that make all the difference, such as all the placards and road signs having been painted over in Dalek script.

Still, for a classic, ""Dalek Invasion of Earth"" is rather weak in some ways. Dalek saucers a la Ed Wood are forgivable and we can overlook a few inevitable technical goof-ups, but all depends on the storyline here, which is fine until the end, when the Dalek's nefarious plans are fully revealed. Revealed to be utter nonsense. The overall plot premise just makes no sense, neither strategically (the Daleks already have spaceships, why would they need to retrofit our planet as one?) nor scientifically (Earth is hardly unique among planets for having a magnetic core, although yanking it out would not, as the Doctor cries out in alarm, upset ""the entire constellation""--whatever that means.) Speaking of the eponymous Doctor, he somehow seemed to be taking a back seat throughout much of this adventure, and I felt it lacked something without his full presence and participation.

All of which is not to say that this flawed classic isn't a lot of fun to watch. And it's definitely not without its successes, nor devoid of great moments: the Dalek rising from the River Thames--cool and dramatic, though I didn't figure them for the scuba-diving type; Barbara running over a Dalek with a lorry truck--it's awfully nice to see a strong, active sci-fi heroine predating Ripley from ""Alien""; and last but not least, the Doctor's wonderfully moving farewell speech to his granddaughter Susan. With all this and more, we can be persuaded to take the hopelessly muddled scientific premise with a grain of salt.",1170720000,2,2736,5.008791208791209
531563,4,6302993644,"In that strange and peculiar universe of Doctor Who criticism, it has become increasingly easy to overlook any Dalek story that doesn't have the word ""Genesis"" in it's title. A story which in reality is more about Davros than the Dalek's. The early Dalek stories now remind us just how formidable and frightening a foe they were, before they degenerated into the excessive parody of  the 1980's. The Nazi allegory which is made blindingly obvious in ""Genesis of the Daleks"" is only tantalisingly hinted at in ""Dalek Invasion of Earth"", but its nevertheless present in the subtext of a story that is one of the most rewarding of William Hartnell's tenure. The monochrome visuals add real menace to the proceedings and give London the eerie isolation that perhaps only ""28 Days Later"" has bettered. The Doctor and his companions show real fear for their adversaries and there is a distinct vein of realism running through this story that echoes British visual medias ongoing pre-occupation with this form. The story is full of iconic images and memorable moments, including the first occasion that a companion leaves, and this is all in a season opener. This was the height of Dalekmania and this is certainly reflected in a story in which the Daleks dominate every screen moment, be they in it or not. The story even has time to weave in a particularly prescient class allegory with the robomen. This is vintage Doctor Who, which thanks to the picture restoration looks fantastic, an essential DVD for fans of archive television.",1159920000,7,1528,4.922480620155039
531584,5,6302993644,"The second in the Doctor's adventures with the Daleks is certainly an enjoyable. One may laugh that our technology has outpaced certain things (such as radio headests of the Robomen or big radar dishes on the back of the Daleks), yet this story also showcases the collapse of technology and civilization through Dalek subjugation.

The things that I notice largely in this story are that Ian first meets Jack Craddock on board the Dalek saucer. Next, he is being follwed by a fellow named Larry. Why the change? I don't know. The other thing that detracts (for me anyway) from the story are the women that ""make clothes for the workers"". One, there must be many workers, and, two, why would the Daleks care about the modesty of their slave workforce?

Oh well, these things are trivial, and this story still shows the test of time (look at the actual story, not the special effects).

I always mention that I dislike hidden features on DVDs. This one has some cute ones featuring thr Slyther, yet I know not why they needed to be hidden.

Overall, I like this DVD.",1140566400,5,1064,4.613756613756614
531585,5,6302993644,"This is one of those titles I looked forward to long before I knew of any definite plans to release it on DVD.  I've always felt that, along with the Patrick Troughton story ""The Seeds of Death"", this is probably the best-photographed story of the entire 26 year history of the show; this is despite the fact that the cameraman's shadow can be seen drifting in and out of certain shots, but this can be forgiven since it is only the vastly improved DVD resolution that makes it visible at all, a problem that didn't exist when it was originally broadcast.
  It was the first Doctor Who story to contain a significant amount of location footage, which enhanced its credibility; to see Daleks swarming around familiar monuments and landmarks leant the story authenticity, and the exterior lighting conditions throughout are flawless, and contribute greatly to creating a tense atmosphere of apprehensive foreboding.
  I would also like to say that I have always been outspokenly opposed to the modification of old films and TV shows for any reason, so when I learned that some of the special effects had been replaced with newly-created CGI images, I was a little disturbed.  But when I saw the results, I was floored: the new sequences are integrated so seamlessly and applied with such restraint that I have been forced to reconsider my objections.  Furthermore, this DVD allows the viewer to choose between the original special effects sequence originally broadcast and the new updated CGI sequences.
  This terrific feature, along with the high quality of the transfer, is an excellent example of the extreme care the BBC has taken in presenting these stories on DVD.  They have taken an almost reverential approach in presenting this beloved British national icon to the rest of the world, and this is yet one more reason to buy this DVD.",1085788800,39,1841,4.890675241157556
531586,5,6302993644,"""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" is one of the best ""Doctor Who"" adventures of all time. It has excitement, awe and wonder, terror, and humor mixed into an epic tale of conquest and survival! William Hartnell gives a fine portrayal of the Doctor, and the storytelling and acting are top-notch! The farewell to the character of Susan Foreman (the Doctor's granddaughter, played by Carole Ann Ford) makes for one emotional ending!
Sadly, the DVD extras aren't the best. The featurettes have fine interviews, but are so lengthy and boring, no one really cares what their talking about. However, the six-part serial more than makes up for it! Any ""Doctor Who"" fan will not wanna miss ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" on DVD!

DIOE has gone under some major clean-up work via the Doctor Who Restoration Team's wonderful new VidFIRE machine and looks almost as good as it did (and in the case of episode 5 even better than) back in 1964. It's not entirely perfect due to the age and quality of the source material, but it is impressive. A great assortment of extras rounds out the set. A must buy.",1081728000,4,443,4.349397590361446
531588,5,6302993644,"After the first Dalek episode, which was somewhat weak other than the novelty factor, it was refreshing to see this Dalek adventure in which the Daleks have taken over Earth and are in the process of finishing off London.  Made almost 40 years before Danny Boyle killed most of London off in his remarkable ""28 Days Later,"" this episode does the same thing in London circa the year 2152, after the Dalek invasion is nearly complete.  Quite creepy to see a Trafalgar square empty of all but Dalek life.  The Doctor, Ian, Barbara and Susan fall in with a group of rebels trying to survive against the Daleks and the robomen -- humans that the Daleks have turned into half human/half robotic overseers working against their own, like the Jewish capos in Nazi death camps.  The Nazi similarity to the Daleks is played up fully for the first time here and the action moves all the way through.  The sets are quite wonderful, and the sense of menace is strong enough to get past the rather cheesy special effects that were all the BBC could afford in the '60's.  But it's easy to put that and the Daleks' obvious shortcomings aside is this great thriller in which the rebels are running out of time against the Daleks' plan and the imminent destruction of the human race.
By this point in the series, the actors had matured and developed a true bond with each other.  Susan gets to fall in love (in a 60's kind of way) and William Hartnell seems to have a hit a good  balance between being crusty and arrogant and concerned for human welfare, in spite of his rather obnoxious habit of saying ""hmmm?"" after all his sentences.  If only they'd have let Susan stop shrieking all the time -- I was actually hoping they'd let her get eaten by an alligator.  You can't blame the actress, however -- it was several decades before the doctor's female companions finally were allowed to stop shrieking.  And Susan, being a teenager, got to shriek more than most of them.
There is a tendency on Amazon to review Doctor Who episodes a little more favaorably than they probably deserve, given how much we all love the series, but this one really works on so many levels.  Besides being a barely saved episode and only the second one featuring the Daleks, it allowed the Daleks to function in different ways and started to give them personalities and structure.  The rebels aren't one-dimensional and have various character attributes that keep them interesting.  There is also a disk of fascinating extras with this one, including talks with the set designers and writers as well as various cast members on how the how was shot and what some of the difficulties were.
One of my favorite Doctor Who purchases to date, and a good chance to see the original cast when they'd knitted together and gotten rid of the early kinks.  Highly recommended.",1073088000,8,2825,4.6332665330661325
531589,5,6302993644,"The Dalek Invasion of Earth depicts a deserted and war-ravaged London, which would have been familiar to a large number of the original viewing audience in 1964 as the London Blitz had happened less than 25 years before. This sort of detail tends to be forgotten now that nearly 40 more years have passed, yet this doesn't detract from the impact of the story. Famous London monuments with Dalek ""graffiti"" on them (which I never noticed watching this on PBS broadcasts) really sent chills down my spine, and the sight of the Daleks crossing London Bridge is still an amazing piece of television. The DVD version of this story is more amazing still. Anyone who has seen this on PBS or via the previous VHS release will only know this story with washed-out images and loads of film defects. The DVD is incredible -- the VidFIRE technique works wonders, and with modern restoration work, the episodes on this DVD no doubt look better today on big-screen TVs than they did on the little 405-line monochrome sets which were the norm in mid-'60s England. You won't see a single film defect anywhere on these episodes, and the scenes originally shot on tape in the studio now look like tape again. Indeed, I was surprised by how much of this story was *not* shot on location, but rather in the studio on cleverly-designed sets. If the superb picture quality wasn't enough, there are more than 2-1/2 hours of extras, most of them newly shot. I found it rather shocking that most of the guest cast was younger than I am now (31) when the story was made. Long live the Restoration Team, and long may their stunning work continue!",1070582400,3,1620,4.648083623693379
531590,4,6302993644,"This creepy phrase, appearing on a large poster along the Thames, along with stunning location shoots all over London, sticks with you long after watching ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth."" Almost forty years later, this show retains its darkness, showing a slow degradation of hope and humanity among a scattered group of survivors.
After the pepper pot-shaped Daleks take over Earth, turning most humans into worker slaves, and an unlucky few into lobomotized overseers, the Doctor and his friends (Susan, Barbara, and Ian) land on Earth and join the resistance. Location shoots are used to great effect, even if you're not a Londoner - from a disquieting scene of a berserk Roboman drowning himself in the Thames, to a road devoid of cars, where two women try to escape in an antique truck.
Keeping in mind that Doctor Who, particularly during the 1960s, was first and foremost a children's TV series, it's surprising that no punches were pulled here. The character of Jenny, originally developed as a new companion for the Doctor, has seen so much death that it no longer fazes her; three other characters are traitorous, willing to sell out the Doctor and his friends for food or money.
The DVD here has great features, well worth the price of admission. Using the ""angle"" control on your DVD player, you may switch between the CGI-animation and original animation of the Dalek ship and other special effects, even as you're viewing the episodes. There are several documentaries covering this animation, design and other aspects of the show. There's also the half hour radio drama, ""Whatever Happened to Susan Foreman?"" and detailed captions, or ""info text"" which can be watched by using the subtitle command.
As with all incarnations of the Doctor, eventually the companions leave and change - much like the Doctor himself. This was the first show to feature the departure of a companion, in a touching scene with just the right note of sentiment. The loving speech the Doctor gives to his departing granddaughter, refusing to let her back into the TARDIS, is one of William Hartnell's great moments, sure to raise a sad pang in the heart of Whovians everywhere.
However, while ""Whatever Happened to Susan Foreman?"", also featured on this DVD, is well-written and gets in a few French jokes, its farcical tone seems inappropriate. It would have you believe Susan became a snide, career-minded bureaucrat on Earth and that another Hartnell-era companion, one of the strongest-minded, went mad. The same Susan who declares ""I love the twentieth century"" in ""An Unearthly Child"" begins moaning about how boring the early 1960s were and longs to return to Gallifrey?
Humor has always been a big part of Doctor Who's appeal, but no one would buy Jo Grant becoming Prime Minister, or Liz Shaw the afternoon host of a cooking show (now, vice-versa...). The silly premise is better suited to fan fiction. Most of all, the one-joke play neuters the terrific, emotional ending of this serial - as well as the interesting relationship developing between Susan and David, a resistance fighter.
Instead, Doctor Who fans might be better off watching this as a chaser with ""Genesis of the Daleks"". Of course, both stories are a bit gloomy, so you might want to wait until a cheerful morning to watch.",1070064000,11,3287,4.956521739130435
531591,5,6302993644,"The Daleks have finally invaded and conquered Earth! The TARDIS materializes in what looks to the weary time travelers to be London in 1963, but as it is soon revealed it is actually London in 2164! After wandering around the city, getting separated, then reunited, Ian, Susan, Barbara and the Doctor soon join with a small band of human resistance fighters to try and topple the Dalek invaders while battling the Daleks altered human slaves, the Robomen, an early inspiration for Monty Python's Gumbies. This is one of the best of the Doctor Who series because in this one we start to see The Doctor losing his crusty exterior and beginning to become not as gruff as he usually is. The ending was somewhat bittersweet and has to be seen firsthand to be truly appreciated. The acting in this is, for Dr. Who anyway, first-rate. Barbara's attempt to mimic a Dalek voice is hilarious but also displays Jacqueline Hill's skills as an accomplished actress willing to try nearly anything to give the characters she plays real depth and feeling. The supporting cast were first-rate as well, even for a Doctor Who episode. This is truly a classic for any Dr. Who afficianado.

531592,4,6302993644,"What is it about ""Doctor Who"" that inspires such erudition?  For years, the fandom rap on ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" was that it was a standard B-movie plot with bad acting, wobbly robot villains, and a wonderful ending.  And yet, when you get to the bonus-features disc on the new DVD release, there are two guest actors from the story (Ann Davies and Bernard Kay, who played no-nonsense Earth rebels) expounding at length about their characters' origins and motivations.  You would not expect them to even remember their characters' names, let alone reveal such interest in their backstories, all these decades later.
""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" is a curiously dated archival piece.  It's no longer living, breathing television.  When viewed with the rest of ""Doctor Who""'s first ten serials, it's probably not in the top tier.  When viewed immediately after ""The Daleks"", it pales.
And yet, on DVD, it's one terrific viewing experience.
The reason these DVDs work so well is the research that goes into them.  When you surround a 40 year-old sci-fi action runaround with genuine affection, everyone benefits.  The serial itself is accompanied by a funny, detailed text commentary track.  The audio commentary for the first time employs a moderator format, as longtime professional fan Gary Russell guides an aging production team -- producer, director, and the two surviving members of the original cast -- past pointless anecdotes and into coherence.  I can think of several previous DW DVD commentaries that could've benefited from a moderator.  And never underestimate the power of a crisp transfer of the episodes, digitally rolled back to their original videotape quality, wiped clear of all the distortions caused by film transfer.
The special-features disc may represent a case of information overload.  The interview with story designer Spencer Chapman is good.  The longer making-of feature is watchable -- we're spared the sight of cast members praising the production team with the same five superlatives, and are instead treated with dissertation-quality thought.  There's a clip from a BBC kids' show, teaching you how to make Daleks out of food (""Sara's Secrets"" on the Food Network never did that).  A bizarre radio play detailing the fictional life of Susan Foreman is worth a listen, but I didn't make it too far.  Do, however, hunt for the two Easter eggs, both involving the story's incomprehensible Slyther monster, a short stuntman in amorphous latex who's good for laughs but not much terror.
It ends, as it should, with a muddied Doctor (William Hartnell) gripping his lapels and staring just to the right of the camera, giving his farewell benediction to Susan, just after he's locked her out of the TARDIS.  One day, he shall come back.  We're still waiting.",1067558400,19,2791,5.110132158590308
531625,4,6302993644,"This is a fun and lengthy story from the early days of Dr. Who and any fan will enjoy it. It was also clearly the basis for the second of the Peter Cushing Dr. Who theatrical films. The show is enjoyable and filled with the kind of costumes, premises and acting that would be common in Dr. Who for years to come. If you enjoy the goofy fun of the Daleks (""exterminate!"") or if you've never seen Dr. Who and were looking for something fun to watch with your kids and wanted to try out a ""typical"" Dr. Who episode, then this show will not disappoint. However, I believe some of the extra features could have been trimmed to keep this to a one-disc set with a lower price, though die-hard fans will surely enjoy them. Although I usually love the extra features on DVD and I like Dr. Who a lot, I have to admit that in this case, given the general cheapness of the production values and effects on Dr. Who, do we really need a detailed account of how the show was produced? Perhaps, given the number of episodes, it would be more affordable for people trying to buy more episodes if these releases were restricted to one disc so that the price could be kept lower. Sorry, but as much fun as Dr. Who can be, I just don't see the need for such in-depth extras on every episode released considering the production values on most episodes.

Still my fondness for this show means that I enjoyed this set a lot, and this episode is particularly fun as an early example of ideas that would appear many times again during the series' run: the Daleks, mind control, and future crises on Earth. One extra feature I did like was the 40th anniversary montage of all the Doctors from various episodes. Another was the footage showing the London locations for the show as they looked then and as they look now. A thoroughly enjoyable program overall.",1067472000,2,1832,4.404129793510324

Script Writer Terry Nation, never expecting his evil pepperpots to become a cult icon, had killed off his creations in his original story but was commissioned to bring them back for the next season.  In this story, the TARDIS lands on the bank of the River Thames, London in the year 2164.  The city is in ruins and the Doctor, Ian, Barbara and Susan are soon split up and discover to their horror that the Daleks have invaded the Earth, butchered most of the population and reduced the survivors to either slaves or ""Robomen"".  As the Doctor teams up with members of the London Resistance Movement he uncovers a daring Dalek plan to mine out the Earth's core, replace it with a drive system and turn the Earth into a giant spacecraft which could be steered from planet to planet as the Daleks expand their empire!  The only hope for the remaining human population depends on the Doctors plan to infiltrate the Dalek mining operations in Bedfordshire and prevent them launching a giant bomb into the Earth's core.
Unlike the previous story, the Daleks are no longer restricted to moving on metal surfaces, but are free to roam the streets of London (and the rivers!) with their robotized zombies, exterminating whoever dares to resist them.  Even though the BBC made this show on a miniscule budget, the original effects are not too bad and the sets create an atmosphere that makes this TV show far more enjoyable than its big-budget movie remake ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth 2150AD"".
Technical notes:  The Doctor Who Restoration Team performed a major cleanup and renovation job on the original BBC recording to produce a highly polished DVD release.  Following the success of the new CGI shots inserted into The 4th Doctor story ""The Ark in Space"", new CGI shots were commissioned to replace the ""plate on a string"" Dalek saucer with a new state-of-the-art spacecraft and new matte paintings were made to show the ruined cityscape (the effects have to be manually switched on via the DVD menu or else the show will be played using the original shots).  A commentary track was recorded by Carole Ann Ford (Susan), William Russell (Ian), Verity Lambert OBE (Producer) and Richard Martin (Director).  Also included is a featurette on the new CGI effects, a look at how the Dalek voices were created with the actors who provided them, ""Now and Then"" featurette on the locations used for filming, ""Future Memories"" featurette with some of the actors from the show, studio floorplans, a ""Blue Peter"" (Children's TV show) special on making ""Dalek Cakes"", a rehersal film shot by Carol Ann Ford back in 1964, BBC trailers, pop-up production notes, photo gallery and more!!!

I was pleasantly surprised to discover the answer upon viewing this extraordinary adventure.  the year is 2164, ten years had passed since a cosmic storm hit earth, nearly wiping out mankind on various continents by a mysterious space virus.  During that time, Dalek vessels landed on Earth, and quickly take control, forcing mankind into slave labor working in the mines, conversion into RoboMen (early prototype for the CyberMen), or into pockets of resistance which are hellbent on defeating the Daleks, and taking back control the planet.  Plus, the terrifying secret as to why the Daleks wish to reach the Earth's core is simply extraordinary as well as horrifying, removing the core and replacing it with a specially designed space engine, thus converting the Earth into a WorldShip.
This was a great adventure, especially witnessing a Dalek rising out of the water, that was truly terrifying as the cliffhanger for episode 1.  The way this post-apocalyptic London was conveyed was extraordinary, filming a majority of the exterior shots early Sunday mornings in order to have the deserted streets to work with.  everyone was on top form with this adventure, and it also marks a turning point, as Susan, the Doctor's beloved granddaughter would be the first to leave the good Doctor's company.

531631,5,6302993644,"An excellent six part adventure with William Hartnell.
Barbara and Ian finally get their wish to return to Earth only to find that the Earth of 2164 is under foreign ownership - that of the Daleks.
This story highlights the growing maturity of the show after only a year and the growing confidence of the show's makers in exploring possibilities.
What could be more chilling than to see the most inhuman monsters driving around London, exterminating all before them? What fun the people driving those Daleks around must have had during shooting!
Anyway, the show opens with one of the most sinister beginnings of the whole Doctor show and a little later, the sight of a Dalek emerging from the River Thames was one of the most scary things for children in the 1960s.
There are many things of interest in this story. The first Doctor Who to be shot on location for instance and the idea of the neutron bomb, set to destroy people but leave the buildings intact. The sheer callousness of the Daleks is also brutally exposed in their use of human slaves to mine out the magnetic core of Earth so they cam install an engine and drive it around the universe. Hopefully they would have had to pass a driving test first. Seriously though, the programme clearly demonstrates an inhumanity in both that sense and in the further hint towards the true nature of the Daleks when one is removed so that the companions can escape from the Daleks.
Inhumanity is a theme of the six episode show, in a practical sense of the Robomen and also in the way that the two women give up Barbara and her friend to the Daleks in exchange for food.
The programme is also about hope and about fighting for one's beliefs. In a way this marks a new side of the Doctor - a more anti-authoritarian side. Although he fought on the side of the Thals in the first Dalek story here he becomes more of a fighter against tyranny and oppression, a fighter for freedom who foregoes weapons and prefers non-violent opposition wherever possible. This side of course becomes more prominent as 'time' goes on.
This episode also marks the first departure from Doctor Who. His granddaughter Susan, played by Carole Ann Ford, falls in love with an unlikely revolutionary but does not want to leave her grandfather. In an ending reflecting the social mores of the time in England, the well meaning old man maroons her with the new man in her life, in a drawn out moment of sadness.
As always with Doctor Who, the cheapo sets and effects detract a little from the story but not significantly so.
I write this review a couple of days after the announcement of the death of Jonathan Nathan-Turner at an early age. Producer of three Dr. Whos - Davison, Baker C., and McCoy he will be sadly missed.",1020556800,5,2745,4.58130081300813
531632,4,6302993644,"This is one of my favorite Dr. Who episodes. I don't believe the dark reality depicted in this unsettling and suspensful episode would have run as well in color as it does in stark black and white.
The scene opens with a man, dressed in rags and wearing head gear, scrambling onto an embankment, tearing at his head and then throwing himself into the Thames to drown. The TARDIS then materializes under the same bridge where the first thing the viewer (but not the TARDIS crew) sees is a large sign forbidding the dumping of bodies into the river. A temporarily relieved Ian and Barbara are soon unnerved by the utter silence; the bridge is decrepit, there is garbage and overgrown weeds, and the river is dead. The Daleks have invaded -- London is now inhabited only by resistence fighters, fugitives and Robomen drones who have been surgically altered by the Daleks to be their slaves, useful until such time as they are driven mad by the cranial butchery and begin to bash their heads against a wall or...throw themselves into the river. Through this blasted, surreal landscape, deserted and dead, move Ian, Barbara, Susan and the Doctor, their ears assaulted by the grinding voices of the Daleks chanting their orders through loudspeakers that echo through the deserted streets and houses, hunted and hiding from the Daleks moving deadly silent and seemingly ubliquitously. There is an aura of decay and desperation overhanging this entire episode, with its relics of a happy, free society plastered over everywhere with ""vetoed"" signs.
Barbara has an excellent part, particularly when she joins the resistence fighters and, with one of the other fighters, begins her flight toward her old home town, or what is left of it -- it's tough for women of this era to make a strong impression (the character of Susan is a very uneven example), and she is one of my favorite companions, growing from a nervous, self-admittedly unadventuresome woman in the early stages of her tenure with Dr. Who, to the spirited, enterprising and warm individual in Invasion.
Unfortunately, this excellent episode is rather unfortunately and sloppily ended -- tsk tsk...I'm a writer, and even sweating a deadline it could have been done a bit better.  Carol Ann Ford wished to leave the series and so Susan, still depicted as a rather neurotic waif, is summarily dumped from one man onto another like a bit of unwanted baggage -- the only time that scaaaary word ""woman"" rather than the usual dismissive ""girl"" is used is in the doctor's heartless and, in this case, glaringly uncharacteristic speech (Hartnell couldn't have liked it much). A sentence or two here and there throughout the episode to make Susan a bit less childish would have given her a cogent leadup to her leaving, and made it a truly sad departure rather than a merely exasperating one. But that's just a bit of nonsense at the end that needn't detract (more than one star, that is) from the excellence of this great Dalek adventure. I have only one question, though. What on earth was that Dalek doing rising from the depths of Thames?",1017187200,3,3087,4.846590909090909

531634,5,6302993644,"THE DALEK INVASION OF EARTH starring Original Doctor William Hartnell was the very first episode to have one of the show's Who characters leaving the show. This was another Dalek adventure that the time lord found himself once again facing his greatest enemies. Like Invasion of time and The Green death, This is a adventure where the characters leave when they fall in love. In the sequel to the episode that made Doctor Who a hit in 1963 ""The Daleks"", The Doctor, Susan, Ian and Barbara arrive in a future London only to discover the Daleks have wiped it out and are at war with a band of rebels. Where the Doctor agrees to help the rebels led by David Campbell stop them from blowing up the planet. Dramatically good, This was Carole Ann Ford's final apperence as The Doctor's granddaughter Susan and her acting at the end made this one of the most saddest endings in the show's history. It was very emotional when the Doctor forces his only family to stay behind to start a new life with the leader of the rebels. A classic Daleks sequel.",994809600,,1042,4.518518518518518

When it came out on DVD, there was no choice but to purchase it, as, for some reason, it is not one of the first doctor's serials that are broadcast in on ""Retro"" station.  In any event, there are a few great scenes, like the Dalek emerging from the river Thames.  The plot is typical Dr. Who.  As for leaving Susan behind, it was necessary if the show were to survive.  She was too much of a drag on the character of The Doctor.  However, the way she is left behind, not at her request but with the Doctor locking her out of the TARDIS for her own good is kind of funny.  Maybe he was sick and tired of all her screaming.  In any event, the ""extra"" What ever happened to Susan?"" was very funny but also very appropriate given the way the Doctor gave her the old heave ho......",1470700800,,826,4.086956521739131

The Daleks invasion is great and was a great thing way back when they were in London and they have only got better.but originals are always best.
Great episode for any Dr. fan more than two thumbs up",1455235200,,444,4.114942528735632

The Dalek Invasion of Earth is a more in depth look at the world of Dr. Who and his battle with the Daleks in the earliest days of the franchise.
