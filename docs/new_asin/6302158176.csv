445984,5,6302158176,This is a must own. Classic,1514937600,,27,3.6666666666666665
445985,2,6302158176,Compared to the first two - this was disappointing. Acting was off - story not as good. The ending was a really dud.,1514332800,,116,4.086956521739131

445989,2,6302158176,"Words fail me. ugh.  The women, Diane Keaton who has always been miscast here, Talia Shire, and Coppola's daughter, were so bad.  I couldn't stop staring at the weird costumes the women wore and that poor girls nose.",1511654400,,216,4.657894736842105
445990,2,6302158176,"This was simply awful. Sophia Coppola's acting was unbearable, and the writing was not on par with the previous two films.",1511308800,,122,4.857142857142857
445991,4,6302158176,"The much maligned third installment of the Godfather saga is actually a very good movie. Sofia Coppola can't act, Tom Hagen is sorely missed though I like how the Connie Corleone character has progressed and the massacre in Atlantic City are significant flaws but the film is still an intense final look into the character of Michael Corleone and it had to be done to make his story complete.",1510963200,,392,4.695652173913044
445992,5,6302158176,Loved all three of these. Of course there is a moral here.,1510099200,,58,3.9166666666666665

446025,3,6302158176,"I hate watching these old movies from more than 25 years ago. There are no special effects. The Godfather movies have been hyped up a lot. However, this movie is less boring than the first two movies.",1506988800,,200,4.4324324324324325

446027,1,6302158176,"It is impossible to believe that this movie is not a farce of two of the best movies ever made - GF1 & 2.  I saw this movie when it originally came out and thought it was terrible. After re-watching, I realize that it is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen, such a shame.  The plot is bad and the acting is worse. Do not read further as remainder contains a spoiler... At the end of this mess - I was happy that the daughter was shot - at least we were all put out of our misery.  Do yourself a favor and watch the first two and never, ever watch this pathetic excuse for a film.",1503532800,5,591,3.908333333333333
446028,5,6302158176,An unexplainable movie with unrepeatable actress 'Al Pacino',1503446400,,60,6.625

446051,1,6302158176,"In its own right, it is a horrible movie: no story worth telling, widespread overacting, a lousy cast (only Pacino, Keaton and the actor who played Corleone's personal henchman remain from the first 2 classics). And by the way it is worth only 1/2 a star, if that. This movie is so bad that if it were completely free, no strings attached, its not worth seeing. I couldn't watch more than one half of the movie; it made my stomach hurt!",1501113600,2,436,4.395061728395062
446052,1,6302158176,"The final sequel to the original 1972 Godfather film. Michael had somehow originally envisioned legitimatizing the family business (never presented any idea of how that would be accomplished), and ends up having numerous family members murdered, including his brothers, as he struggled to maintain control. Seems that the Sicilian value of family loyalty meant nothing when it came down to money.",1500595200,,396,5.508196721311475
446053,1,6302158176,"I don't consider this movie cannon to the other 2. While it did have an easier plotline to understand, which was a thing the other 2 kind of got wrong, it managed to get wrong all the great elements of the first 2. The acting was bad, it doesn't say what happens after *spoiler* Fredo dies in part 2, and what Michael Would have done with the Business. Alternative name for this movie: Dynasty, the 3 hour long special, but with godfather characters. Not to mention the extremely anti-climactic ending of the movie.",1500163200,,515,4.548387096774194

446056,5,6302158176,"Who hasn't seen ALL the Godfathers, numerous times? But I didn't recall a single frame or syllable of this one, which was left out as a freebie by someone in my apartment building. Maybe I blocked it out of my mind. The editing is what I admire most - weaving the plot through opera performances and religious iconography. I would have taken a star off for the creepy and disturbing borderline incest, but . . .",1492819200,,411,4.421052631578948

446104,5,6302158176,"My favorite of the Godfather series, but I know I am in the minority for saying so.  Okay, I confess that the assassination attempt was pretty cheesy, but the passing of the torch plot line, and the way the story comes full circle is pure art.  I don't remember who, but someone argued that Godfather III is important because it establishes the series as a tragedy, and I believe this is true, which I think brings the story line more into the realm of art, which I believe this series clearly qualifies as.

Plus that silent scream in the closing is just incredible.  One of Pacino's best scenes ever.",1478563200,6,602,4.495412844036697

446134,5,6302158176,Great way to finish it. Also liked the way the bridge between politics and crime is spotlighted. Very relevant today.,1474416000,,117,4.9

446137,2,6302158176,Certainly one of the director's lesser works. He should not have cast his daughter. He should have waited for Winnona Ryder to get out of therapy or whatever the hell she was doing that kept her from playing Princess Corleone! Robert Duvall was definitely missed as Tom Hagen. They should have paid him a decent wage and this movie could have been saved.,1472774400,3,354,4.634920634920635

446152,3,6302158176,"So bad it's almost good.  Almost.  Come to think of it, closer to completely horrible than almost good.  Coppola had clearly lost it by the time they got around to making this.  Blame it on the drugs, maybe.  Whatever it was, this movie is awful that it's almost fun to watch.  It's as awful as the first two in the series were great, if that makes sense.  You almost feel bad for Sofia dying on the steps (possibly the worst performance in any scene in cinematic history).",1471046400,,473,4.367816091954023

We all know women have such important roles in crime families, right? 3) Then, let's bring in Andy Garcia as the heir apparent. The first two Godfather movies showed just how cool and level-headed a crime boss was  Don Corleone and Michael. So of course it makes sense to bring in a loudmouthed loose cannon who 4) jumps his cousin, the Don's daughter! Which by the way is strange because 5) the children, who were definitely their father's kids and were only allowed to be seen occasionally by Kay, are now mama's kids and 6) the son is an opera singer? Really? And 7) let's throw in some fully unrealistic event such as a helicopter hit. Ever hear of one in America? Come on! and finally 8) there are far too many other criticisms to bother with.

The stage is set with PARTS I and II, but THE GODFATHER, PART III builds upon that as its foundation. THE GODFATHER, PART III has a unique operatic quality to it setting it apart from its predecessors. There is this idea of redemption for pasts deeds where duty to family existed, but without honor and lack of moral fiber from beliefs from the divine entity from whom they were created. That is the conundrum. That is the sadness. that is the setting from which there is no escape. THE GODFATHER, PART III is an operatic epic.",1445558400,,632,4.543859649122807

But this was THE GODFATHER, you would think he would be in a protective garden or have family or nursing staff giving him some care.

I do like the reuniting of Kay and Michael as well as him realize he needed repentance for what he had done in his life.  Also that his son had chosen a different path other than being in the mafia.

For those who are expecting the vicarious thrill of seeing the powerful Corleone family  triumph, you could be disappointed. The characters have of course aged, and the message is, of necessity different, as the saga's arc inevitably  trends downward.  Disappointing too is the formulaic approach which continues from I and II: the obligatory church ceremony, after party complete with father-daughter dance, yet another trip back to Sicily, and I could go on but don't want to be a spoiler.  On the positive side, the music score is beautiful. The acting is fine, although a lot of the dialogue seems like it was phoned in. The story is interesting and there is a grandeur a la Copolla style. I had read that he really didn't want to do III and I'm afraid it shows a little.  All that being said, it is still enjoyable to watch and better than most movies out there. Pacino is brilliant and Copolla is so gifted, even when in second gear.",1417478400,2,1010,4.651685393258427

446568,5,6302158176,"Out of all the Godfather movies this is my favorite.

Unlike the first 2 Godfather movies, this is treated with more artistry; it is like a grand opera within an opera.
The film's dramatic finale takes place at an opera house in Palermo, Italy premiering a production of Cavalleria Rusticana (naturally).
We witness intricate cat and mouse assassination attempts in and around the opera house mirroring the plot of the opera.

Talia Shire as an older and wiser Connie is a delight to watch. When Mary is killed on the steps of the opera house as the family is leaving, Connie drops to her knees and covers her head with a scarf, a classic gesture and it happens to mirror Maria's grieving gesture when Tony is shot dead in West Side Story.

The film is scripted in a more operatic-like style than it's predecessors and the characters are all older, more bitter, more fatalistic and the ending is bittersweet perfection.......and the curtain closes. Bravo! Brava!",1415836800,,962,4.818181818181818

Retaining the original cast was paramount. All excellent in their own movements & delivery. I have no idea why III was not complimented by as many if not more awards as I & II. With Catholic experiences of the 60s and an existing decision in my own mind for more than 50 years that John Paul I was indeed murdered by insiders of the Vatican financial system - the truth is played out honestly and with precision. The going-clean by the Family has been and will always be a goal of today's own. Tit-for-tat in any circle is indeed the come-uppens for anyone. Forgiveness is relished in III in such a way it's absolutely believable as well as transparent. Stumbling thru family, years of deliberate pain for gain and dying alone happens everyday, III is everyone's history. Coppola must have developed this film with forced energy resulting in an unexpected gracious, smooth, and passionate structure. Truly a classic. Those who love history will understand - those who don't will of course dislike the film - they alone are the dis-belivers.

Finally,others have stated that one cannot appreciate the events in it without watching the first two films. Despite of the reasons stated above,I still consider this one of the great films ever released in the big screen. It has a great screenplay that weaves into its plot a fictionalized account of real-life events particularly the death of Pope John Paul I in 1978 as well as the Papal banking scandal that happened between 1981 and 1982 and puts them together. The performance of the cast was great except that of Sofia Coppola,the musical score of Carmine Coppola still reminds us of the haunting musical scores of Nino Rota particularly the Godfather theme, and its themes of greed,crime and vulnerability will resonate to its viewers.

But a mafia hit with a helicopter? We went from ""Leave the gun, take the canoli,"" to doors being locked with handcuffs and mafia bosses being gunned down in some scene that would be too ridiculous in a Batman movie.

Its like Coppola was confused into believing that he was making a straight to VHS Scarface sequel.

But I think Pacino is pretty bad in III. Probably in part due to script. The way Michael transforms is unrealistic. Sophia Coppola is not fit for Godzilla, much less Godfather. Talia Shire's transformation with Connie Ditto Pacino's. This film suffered terribly because Robert Duvall wasn't paid what he deserved, Tom Hagen in III could have made a big difference. There is a Novel the Godfather Returns I enjoyed that featured use of Hagen, who Duvall is terrific as. The highlights are provided by Andy Garcia and Joe Mantegna, who steal the show as Vincent Corleone and Joey ZaZa. The Vincent Garcia portrays recalls James Caan's Santino Corleone. And ZaZa is a flashy gangster. These guys could have done even better with a better script and more screen time. Despite Pacino's sub par outing, he has his moments, how could AL PACINO not? I think a lot of the blame here is on the writing. There is a lot of talent here obviously, and I would still recommend watching it. But it absolutely pales in comparison and doesn't do justice to I and II, two of the very best films ever.

446848,1,6302158176,"The Godfather: Part III continues the theme of Family from the first two movies. In The Godfather, Michael had undergone an internal arc to go from outsider to Don of the family, dropping most of his morals along the way in order to protect the family. In The Godfather: Part II, this idea of the ends justify the means is taken to its logical extreme as Michael tears the family apart in order to protect it.

In Part III, Michael tries to make the family legitimate in order to redeem himself. Unlike the first movie, where Michael's internal change happens on screen, and unlike the second movie, where Michael's does not change at all, this movie has Michael shifting gears to try to pay for his past sins. But this change does not take place on screen. Michael starts the movie regretting his distance from his children and spends the whole movie trying to make up, his internal compass does not change through the movie.

So all we are left are two external plot lines: Michael's efforts to legitimize being constantly thwarted and his failure to protect his family because of his past sins keep catching up to him.

The movie seems to be about something like ""Crime will never let you escape"". But the movie doesn't really prove this because so much of what Michael is paying for is offscreen and in the past two movies. The whole movie just feels like a confession for past sins and the filmmakers showing us that bad deeds will always catch up to us. The idea is not proven by action and choice of the characters on screen. This movie is a necessary but not a worthy tribute to the first two films, it probably shouldn't have been made at all.

446855,4,6302158176,"When I read the review posted by the associated press upon the release of this film, the journalist entitled the review ""The icing on the cake"". I think that was a more than fair assessment. The Godfather pt. III is generally an excellent third installment, but it is not without some serious flaws. The biggest of which is Francis Coppola casting his daughter Sofia in a major role as Michael's daughter, Mary. Francis Coppola chose to cast his daughter for three reasons. The first being that originally Winona Ryder was schedualed to be cast in the part, but she developed some health issue and couldn't participate. Secondly is because Sofia had a natural sicillian beauty that made her visually perfect for the role. Thirdly Coppola had already used numerous family members in the production of the first two films, who had tasks as important as playing major characters and writing the score for the film. Unfortunately Sofia's acting ranges from dreadful to fairly good. There are other obvious weaknesses here and there as well. One that bothered me was just before Michael confesses his sins to a priest in Rome, he suffers a diabetic attack and asks for some orange juice or candy. The priest sends a man off who returns less than 10 seconds later with a tray that included both candy and a pitcher of orange juice, with a glass of the juice already poured. One example of several rediculous weaknesses in this film that are nearly unforgivable. But they are easily forgiven because there are many truly powerfully directed moments in the film that easily companion themselves in the same epic league as the first two films did. The last third of this film is master film making at it's absolute best. And the Cavaleria Rusticana adds to the operatic stature of many moments of this film that stature themselves as classic moments. There are many wonderful moments in this film that earn it a much deserved place in the trilogy.",1367971200,,1938,4.8053892215568865

Uh-huh...  Francis Ford Coppola is a very talented director, so why on earth he cast his daughter in the role of Mary when she can't act is beyond me.  I find it hard to believe he just couldn't find anybody at the last minute to take Ryder's place.  In my opinion Sofia is what brings the movie down.  If you can get past her performance, the movie works for me on most levels.  Andy Garcia gives a very strong and believable portrayal of Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son and while I've never been a big Al Pacino fan, he does a creditable job of showing Michael trying to get out and stay out of the family business, and being relentlessly pulled back in.  I particularly liked the interplay between Michael and Kay late in the film, and in my opinion Diane Keaton is outstanding in showing the conflicting emotions she has always felt toward her former husband and the father of her children.  The Catholic church politics and scandal was interesting.  The scene after the opera on the steps I felt Pacino way overdid.

He makes, and with the help of step-nephew Vincent Mancini, breaks a vow to ""never sin again,"" and it's suggested that Michael's day of reckoning when he doesn't keep his word to God is the result. (semi-spoiler ahead)

No, it's not equal to parts I and !!, yet despite this third Godfather film's few shortcomings, it can't be denied that its climactic scene is truly gut-wrenching, because unlike other murders throughout the 9-hour series, there is loud wailing on all sides as soon as this one occurs, crying and shouts of woe that really get to a viewer (it does to me, at least!). The ""crime pays only to a certain extent"" subtext is clear, and when some years later he passes away, all alone on a sunny Sicilian day, this is a mere footnote to Michael's true demise, which happened on the steps of a Palermo opera house that terrible night.

Director Francis Coppola originally considered having Michael fatally wounded in this sequence, then he'd roll down the stairs. Ex-wife Kaye comes to his side and asks, ""Michael, are you dying?"" He'd answer, ""No,"" and then expire. Coppola preferred instead to have the ex-Don Corleone suffer for his sins, and suffer mightily he does. That forlorn, delayed scream he lets out when the tragedy is done can only scratch the surface of Michael's grief. You clearly see it in his eyes: although still breathing Michael Corleone has ceased to exist.

446901,2,6302158176,"The first two Godfather movies are classics, two of the best movies ever. They have rich character development, tight plots, and brilliant acting.

That's everything Godfather III doesn't have.

I think the biggest problem is that the movie takes place 20 years after Godfather II. It's just too much time and the characters have changed so much. I understand what Coppola was trying to do - he wanted to show an older Michael worried about his soul. However, it just doesn't work. Michael seems more like a doddering old man than the cold, ruthless man we grew to know. We don't see the evolution, and as such don't feel the emotional drama of Michael's quest for forgiveness.

The film is filled with a lot of new characters who don't have the audience's love and respect the way that the original characters do. It would have been OK if the new characters were as compelling as the original ones, but they're not. They're shallow and superficial. In particular, Andy Garcia as Sonny's son takes up way too much screen time. The movie could have been subtitled the ""Andy Garcia"" show. He comes across more like Joey from Friends than Sonny from the Godfather. It seems extremely contrived that Michael would suddenly take him on as a son at the beginning of the movie. Same with Sophia Coppola as Michael's daughter. I guess the two characters were designed to add a ""youth"" element to the film, but they add nothing to the story.

The script is also a bit too ""on the nose"". Where Godfathers I & II were notable for their remarkable use of silence and facial expressions to convey emotions, Godfather II has several monologues.  Michael has several confession scenes which again don't have the emotional impact they should.

I'm glad I did eventually watch this movie, only because I was curious to see Michael's death. That said, Godfather II ends on such a powerful note that I think it says everything that needed to be said about Michael Corleone. That last scene, where Michael is sitting alone after he orders the killing of Fredo, contains more emotional power about the loneliness of power and regret than anything in this entire movie.",1343088000,,2147,4.758064516129032

The (too many)flashback scenes were poorly blended into the current day adding to the inability of the movie to keep me riveted.
By the time it was half over I found myself anxious for it to end. Helicopter assault? Was that supposed to appeal to 13 year olds? Seems more appropriate in a ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""Die Hard"" movie. GF, I thought, was supposed to be serious, grown up entertainment.
Michael Corleone falling out of his chair into the dirt? I know the message it was supposed to send but really, no one else in GF or GF2 ended so disgraced, no one.

446937,4,6302158176,"It baffles me sometimes to think about the amount of seething hatred heaped on the third installment of such a beloved trilogy (the first two films are regarded by many as clear masterpieces, and yet so many consider this third film a parody or sorts).  That isn't to say that it isn't flawed, for it certainly is, and the nostalgic angle that the original two films takes is lost in this particular film, but overall this is certainly a well-made and engaging film that shouldn't be so ferociously compared to its superior predecessors.  I understand that inclination, for it is only natural, to expect something grander from such noble beginnings, but `The Godfather part III' is a film that stands on its own and so when taken out of the initial context and judged solely on its own merits, the flaws fade from great to few.

Yes, there are some flaws that just won't fade away, but as its own film `The Godfather part III' is certainly better than most.

With a different focal point (less on the family, more on the Church), this installment doesn't quite fit in with the internal flow of the first two films; and considering the glossy update it received (being made nearly two decades after the original) it almost feels like it was cut from a different mold.  That may be a reason why so many impulsively label it as a weak or laughable inclusion in such a genius series, but there is so much to really love here.

For starters, Al Pacino is spot on perfection here.  The way he's molded one solidary character throughout three films (and multiple generations) is flawless.  This is his grand opus (the character, not this particular film) and it shows in the way he closes out this man.  In watching the films back to back you can see the wholeness of the character spring to life gradually yet with steely power and technique.  It reminds me a bit of how I felt while watching the recent phenomenon known as `The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo'.  What Noomi Rapace does over the course of three films is brilliant, slowly fleshing out an entire character.  The difference is that one really needs to see all three films in the Millennium trilogy to appreciate Rapace's performance.  That isn't the case with Pacino and The Godfather films.  Each performance is a performance all its own that works in perfect unison with the previous yet is not reliant on the performance that came before it to grab out attention and respect.

While much has been made about Sophia Coppola's lack of acting talent (she is a brilliant director though), it's almost like too much attention has been given to one glaring flaw and not enough given to the fact that the film sports fine performances by everyone else, including the Oscar nominated Andy Garcia.

From a technical standpoint, the film is a marvel.  In its glossy veneer, the film still carries a thick film of grit that captures the heart of the franchise.  Coppola's direction is enticing; the production values are insanely well done and the overall impact of the visuals here are spellbinding.

It's a pretty picture; no doubt.

And so, in closing I'll say this; while the film itself does not live up to the name backing it (and I wholly admit that), there is nothing wrong with embracing this film for what it is.  It is a very entertaining and rewarding crime drama laced with characters we have grown to love (or at least love to watch) and littered with performances that make watching this a pleasure (and yes, one performance that makes watching this a trial at times).

The film is good; end of discussion.",1314662400,4,3568,4.657097288676236
446938,4,6302158176,"This third and final film depicting the Corleone family of Godfather fame was produced in 1990, sixteen years after The Godfather, Part II.  I think the screenwriters hoped that storyline in the book had been forgotten because one of the basic premises of the film directly conflicts from that in the book.  This final episode introduces a new character, Vincent Mancini,  who is supposed to be the son of Sonny and his girlfriend Lucy.  However, the book makes it very very clear that she certainly never had a child with Sonny.  This might be good for the plot, but it disputes the book.

Anyway, most of the original cast is still there.  Al Pacino is now the Godfather, Diane Keaton is his ex-wife and Talia Shire is his sister.  Sofia Coppola, who is the daughter of the director, Francis Ford Coppola, is cast as the Godfather's daughter.  And now there is a new and important character introduced.  This is supposedly Sonny's son, played by Andy Garcia.  He sure is good looking and tough and a Godfather-in-the-making.  Soon, he is challenging the Godfather and is also in a romance with the Godfather's daughter.

The Godfather has a lot of money by now but the amounts that are thrown around are just too humongous to be believed, like 100 million dollars to the church and as much as 50 million to each of his gangster friends in the hope of forming a coalition.  There is also a scene where a helicopter breaks through the tarp used as  the roof of an Atlantic City Casino with machine guns shooting bullets at everyone in attendance.  This is just too much to be believed.

That said, there still great scenes and some fine acting.  I particularly liked the scene between the Godfather and his former wife as they attend their son's operatic debut performance in Sicily of Cavalleria Rusticana.  Actually, all the scenes set in Sicily are well done and I was impressed with its beauty.

Sophia Coppola has never been that great of an actress to me (example: her portrayal of Peggy Sue's baby sister, Nancy Kelcher in Peggy Sue Got Married circa 1987)...she does have that sort of ""valley girl"" attitude in every role but she isn't that bad in this movie.

446942,3,6302158176,"[Based upon 1990s VHS - possibly ""Final Director's Cut""]

With obviously overblown intentions, this sequel still comes off like a made-for-TV movie, with stilted acting and that undefineable but real feeling of something mechanical going on - although there's nothing wrong with serving up something tastey to a public hungry for more...and more.

Pacino and Keaton and Garcia are excellent; Sophia Coppolla is strong in some scenes and tentative in others - in one early scene, where she looks rapturously at her long-lost Cousin (Sonny's son), she's terrific.

Story kicks off well but then veers off into places it had no need to go to. A big part of the plot involves dealings with less than sanctified Vatican people and evil observers following the money that Michael wants to unload - as he wants to unload all of his past and go back to his pre-crime, War Hero status. Not to be.

Along the way his daughter gets involved with her Cousin..and the viewer has to deal with some mildly kinky, unnecessary scenes with the two. As uncomfortable as that is, Coppolla should have stuck to it ...keeping the drama more ""local"", with Michael, now infirm, having to battle with a big question: should he do to his ""love child"" nephew what he did to his oldest Brother. Simple. Great. But, no.............",1282435200,,1302,4.851351351351352
446943,3,6302158176,"No matter which way you look at it, the third instalment of the 'Godfather' series just isn't as good as the first two. While it retains the same high production values and attention to detail, and contains some powerful scenes, the storyline of 'Part III' is haphazard and the acting very hit-and-miss.

The plot revolves around an older Michael Corleone achieving his goal of making the family business (almost) completely legitimate, despite the reluctance of family, associates, and ""friends"" to let him walk away from his criminal past. This had the potential to be really engaging, but the film quickly dissolves into a series of side stories that are under-developed and don't really fit that well together. Instead of the complex interlocking sub-plots of Parts I and II, this film feels much looser and more fragmented; it's more like a series of individual scenes than a coherent narrative. Secondly, far too much time is devoted to the clumsy forbidden-romance subplot between Michael's daughter Mary and his nephew Vincent. This might not have been quite so bad had the two characters shown the slightest chemistry, but as it stands it just feels forced and awkward. Finally, the dodgy Vatican deal at the heart of the film just wasn't that interesting; ""legitimate"" business transactions, no matter how hard-nosed and complex, just don't have the same attraction as the criminal scheming and manipulation we saw in Parts I and II.

Unfortunately, the weaknesses in the story are only emphasised by the inconsistent performances. Some people criticise Pacino's performance here, and it's true that this Michael is very different to the character in Parts I and II. However, this suits the film, with Michael coming across as a man who has mellowed significantly with age, and seeking to atone for (or at least face up to) the terrible things he has done in the past. I also really liked Talia Shire in this one; instead of the flaky victim of the first two films, she is ruthless and determined here, almost a Godmother-like figure in her own right. Andy Garcia I thought was hit-and-miss as Vincent, he nails it as the suave gangster type, but is less convincing in the ""hot-headed"" scenes. And Sophia Coppola is definitely the weak link here, although to be fair her character wasn't that interesting to start with. These four apart, and in contrast to the first two films, none of the other characters were particularly memorable or distinctive, with the mobsters in particular tending to blend into one another. The film badly misses Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, who would have fitted perfectly into the central conflict about staying legitimate or seeking personal revenge.

What saves `Part III' to some extent is the climax, which is even more tragic and poignant than that of `Part II' because Michael is more of a ""good"" character this time around. Michael has spent the bulk of the film genuinely trying to make things right after a lifetime of wrong-doing, yet still ends up suffering a loss even more devastating than before. Some might regard the climax as Michael's deserved come-uppance, and there is something to be said for him paying for his past sins. But the tone is overwhelmingly sympathetic, with the very final montage of scenes re-inforcing the immense losses Michael has suffered throughout his entire life.

 These final scenes do at least give the entire Godfather saga an appropriate closure, and `Part III' is almost worth watching for the last 20 minutes alone. But that apart, `Part III' is easily the weakest of the three films, not only in comparison to the first two but also on its own merits. While the technical aspects of the film are still strong, and the film is as ambitious as its predecessors, it's too unfocussed and inconsistent to be a true success. A tighter script and more inspired casting choices could well have elevated Part III into the same category as Parts I and II. As it stands, there are just too many flaws here to ignore.",1280188800,3,3994,4.911111111111111
446944,3,6302158176,"The Godfather 3 really isn't as bad as the critics made it out to be.  It just suffers in the shadow of its great predecessors, and from an overwrought and clunky ending.  For the most part, I enjoyed the film.

Pacino gives a great performance and is the real reason to watch this.  That said, too many things end up being too conveniently executed.  Some moments between the characters could have been further developed for greater credibility - for that is where the film suffers.  Andy Garcia gets a lot of screen time, but is improbable as the trigger happy hotshot who's both suave yet totally ruthless and unstable.  He doesn't have the gravitas in some respects, but looks good on screen.  This is where later films like Eastern Promises with Viggo Mortensen go one up on realism.  Sofia Coppola is the ""flower vase"" as some might call her.  She looks fine, but again, is underdeveloped.  In retrospect, Francis Ford Coppola could have done better if he was aiming for the King Lear allegory (which he was) and given us more of a reason to relate to her as a character.  While believable enough as his daughter, she never really makes an impact on us. And as an actress, she's definitely too novice for this role.

Still, one can't deny the Godfather feel of the film.  Beautiful set pieces, nice dialogue,...for the most part the film works.
But the ending is so improbable, it felt like a bad James Bond plot to kill Saddam Hussain in the space of 15 minutes. Full of holes!  That would be one major reason why Coppola has never quite made it back to the top as a director...that, and casting his own daughter for this epic role.",1275004800,,1639,4.546075085324232

The film begins in the fall (brown leaves for symbolism). There are flashbacks to the earlier 1970s movies to remind you of the past (and pad out the time). In 1979 Michael Corleone receives an award for his charitable works. [Not unlike other millionaires?] There is a celebration later where we meet other people. There is a problem with nephew Vincent (Sonny's boy). Will he have bad luck? No. Michael Corleone wants the Vatican to vote their shares in a corporation so Michael will get control of the Immobiliare Corporation (real estate holdings). [Do real estate holdings have special tax treatment as capital gains?] Will the Vatican Bank put their money in? ""Why am I doing this?"" Do others want to invest? But there is a glitch in taking control. Is the old neighborhood having a problem? `Never hate your enemy - it affects your judgment.""

At the meeting Joey Zazza speaks out and asks for a vote. The others want to invest in Immobiliare. But there is a shocking surprise to finish the party! Later Michael has a diabetic stroke. There is trouble again. During a parade shots are fire to kill Zazza and his men. What will Michael do? The scene shifts to Italy. Strategy is plotted. Did the violence there result from history? Michael complains about a financial swindle. Stress causes low blood sugar. The death of Pope Paul VI is announced. Are the rich more corrupt? [The movie slows down here.] There are plots and counter-plots; we know what will happen. [The movie slows down here.] A new pope is elected, Lamberto will be called John Paul I. There will be reforms in the Vatican Bank. Nephew Vincent will take charge (as in a feudal society).

The opera `Cavalleria Rusticana' (symbolism?) has many guests. Is it dangerous to be an honest man? Things seem to be building to a climax. ""Love somebody else."" [Does this scene at the opera remind you of ""The Man Who Knew Too Much""?] Who killed Pope John Paul I? Who killed the others? What difference did it make? The bodies fall as in some operas. Was that the intent of this story? A latter-day tragedy?

Was this movie deliberately crippled to put an end to this saga? Parts I & II were made fifteen years earlier, and were more dramatic. This version avoided referencing political corruption in America. The hidden scandal about the Vatican Bank was its use for money laundering and avoiding taxes on investments: no official reports. The assassin in the opera house used a rifle that resembled the Mannlicher-Carcano bought by Oswald. A professional killer would use a rifle so he can escape to enjoy his pay.

446990,5,6302158176,"The Godfather Part III is a great movie if you have watched the other two parts. As a stand alone movie, I can see why some people were not happy with it.

My sweetheart and I (reluctantly on my part) watched all three parts in a row for the first time this summer. It was a spellbinding story, that is remarkable not for the evil it portrays, but in that it shows the small moves toward evil that lead us on a course that ends up in a personal hell.

For me Part III is an essential part of the story, showing that there is no good to come from a deal with the devil. Karma, Fate, what have you, will require payment sooner or later, and the Godfather ends up as a wonderfully poignant tragedy, rather that a cops and robbers kind of crime story.

For me the crux of the whole trilogy comes with Don Michael's confession to his ex-wife that all he ever wanted was to protect his family, and in the end he lost them anyway, paired with the final tragic event in the story, the heartbreaking reality, that in the end, someone always has to pay.

So here's the deal, don't bother to watch Part III without seeing the other two parts first, preferably in a marathon viewing, but if you watch it as part of the whole, you will probably find it a moving end to the saga.",1226534400,,1265,4.172131147540983
446991,5,6302158176,"I can't rave enough about this film.  A stellar cinematic achievement. Its only fault is being the third part of the trilogy.  It can't compare to the other films.  I and II consistently rank among top ten films ever.  This isn't in the top ten films ever.  Certainly, it ranks amongst the top 20 percent.  (I'd probably put it in the top one percent of all films.  Too much has been made of this film to re-rank or replace it among the other two.

One of the shining parts of this film is its commentary.  Much of the commentary on the first two films are self-promotional.  ""I was great,"" ""The studio hated me,"" etc.  This commentary humbles Mr. Coppola.  He becomes a strong pawn of the studio.  Also interesting is the skeletonized version of the plot Mr. Coppola discusses of Godfather IV at the end of the film, rolling into the commentary, suggesting a film paralleling Godfather II (the rise of Vito in the Corleone family vs. the fall of Vincent Mancini & the Corleone family).

Also interesting are the discussion of casting decisions due to self-excising from the film of a few actors.  Remember - the character of Clemenza was killed off entering the second film, and replaced by a 'parallel' actor, as well.

Finally - the decision of casting Sofia Coppola - certainly seen as a gross abuse of power.  This casting decision could be paralleled to casting Talia Shire in the first Godfather film.  Certainly, it seemed to have worked in his favor.  Too much criticism has been thrown upon her performance.  She is more than competent, if not brilliant, in this role.  She was even a far more experienced actress when cast in this film than Miss Shire was when cast in the Godfather.  I don't see her as strikingly beautiful, but appropriately desirable.  Certainly Miss Coppola has distinguished herself as an artist since.

Finally - the plot surrounding the dirty ascension of a pious man into the shoes of the Pope brilliantly paralleled a modern tale.  It is the essential corruption and rejection of power and grace in a stunningly realistic tale.  Even now, I shudder at the unmaking of a man who worked so hard to remake himself.

You care a lot less about the characters, and the plot does nothing really to add (or to it's credit detract) from the original 2.

One of the things Coppola can not be matched on however is the way he juxtaposes scenes to heighten or compliment each other, and he doesn't disapoint in this film, bringing up the tension beautifully by twinning attempted assassination in a theatre with the dramatics unravelling on stage, or Al Pacino's characters tragic holding of his dead daughter with the joyous dancing of the two in happier times.

Francis Coppola raised eyebrows when he cast his daughter, Sofia, as a replacement for an ailing Winona Ryder, and the critics were quick to dismiss her as an amateur and the weak link in the production. I find her cute and charmingly fresh, though, and her presence kept my eye from wandering off screen. Her acting is certainly no worse than that of bland Bridget Fonda and dull Andy Garcia.

The worst offender in the cast, however, is Al Pacino. Looking and sounding nothing like he did in ""Part II"" sixteen years earlier, he's short-tempered and even blustery in ways that one does not associate with cold, calculating Michael Corleone. The man who cruelly ordered the execution of his brother, Fredo, and withdrew to the point that he was a zombie, is suddenly impassioned without reason. It simply fails to be credible. Pacino might as well be playing a completely different character because this is not the Michael Corleone of the earlier films.

Stylistically, ""Part III"" is rather plain, even drab, lacking the artistry that made ""Part II"" a masterpiece and the best in the series. This is the worst kind of sequel, made, it seems, for monetary reasons alone.

447039,5,6302158176,"The GODFATHER Part III DVD

The God father is based upon Mario Puzo's novel of a Sicilian Family moved to the United States circa 1920's.  Don Corleone goes into the  olive oil business, what else would you expect?  He soon learns that it is easier to make money on the wrong side of the law and recruits a small gang of fellow Sicilians.

In Part III, Al Pacino returns once again to the role of Don Michael Corleone. In this film, Corleone tries to go legitimate. He purchases an Italian company previously owned by The Vatican. He is given a medal by The Vatican, and believes he is on the path to being legitimate. His nephew, played well by Andy Garcia is being trained by his uncle to one day head the family. The Corleones soon learn there are traitors in The Vatican. Corleone tries to find the traitor legally. Upon the Pope's death, he finds a group of high-ranking Vatican officials, are his traitors. This group is headed by Bishop Lombardo, who has just been named Pope John Paul I. He then rids himself of that problem, and believes to be on the right path again. Just as he starts to feel comfortable with legitimate life, a tragedy occurs. Leaving an old Corleone devastated, this is a tragic end to a wonderful film.

There are a million stories that whirl around THE GODFATHER.  THE GODFATHER was a film where just about everything seemed to work out best for all involved, and this illustrates this perfectly.

Highly recommended for fans of Al Pacino, and the American Mafia

447040,2,6302158176,"I have tried many times to give this film an honest chance; to try to judge it on its own merits.  I have found it impossible a task.  Just as difficult as Coppola might have found it to attempt to live up to the two preceding MASTERPIECES that Godfather I and II were, I find it just as hard to give this film a fair shake in attempting to allow it to stand on its own.

The film is lacking in so many areas it saddens me.  First of all, and please bare with me because I'm a fan of this actor, I think Andy Garcia was DREADFUL in this movie.  I think that although he has been brilliant in other films, I found in this 3rd installment of the series his performance was way too ""LOUD"", uneven and over the top.  The first two Godfather movies excelled primarily because of the writing, cinematography, and lastly (and most importantly): the way in which the actors achieved artistic excellence via their minimalist performances.  Garcia seems to have been lost on this latter notion of less is more.  He, in a sense, ruins the movie by attempting to overshadow all that has come before him by seemingly and purposefully playing the role of the Corleone heir-apparent with a sense of artistic entitlement, pompousness, boisterousness and borderline obnoxiousness that DOES NOT bode well for him or the producers of the film.  I don't know how intentional this may or may not have been, but I think he could have achieved a better result had he opted to ""tone down"" significantly the way he interpreted the role while still being able to convey the true reckless nature and spirit of a younger Corleone who, in true-to-life like fashion, inherits the personalistic traits of volatility and hothead-edness of his late father.  It's a shame that Duvall, DeNiro and Pacino couldn't have better served him by counseling him during the making of the film.  Clearly these ACTORS know their craft and should have impressed upon the younger Garcia on what licenses he should or shouldn't have taken in order to preserve the consistency and continuity of the lead acting roles in this trilogy.  Its a failure that permanently harms the film and tarnishes an otherwise satisfactory track record up to this point.

I think the 2nd most tragic thing about this film is the decision of the director to cast his inexperienced daughter in the role of Marie.  This is clearly nepitism at its worst.  She is HORRIBLE in this film.  Simply terrible.  It made NO sense to do this and I think the outcry that came about because of it is well-deserved, although I do remember being stunned by the level of negative press about it at the time the movie came out.  I make no apology for now having finally agreeing with every bit of it.

All in all, I think the movie is salvageable because it had the almost undaunting task of having a lot to live up to.  Godfather I and II are UNDOUBTEDLY among the 10 BEST films of all time.  How could you top or even compete with these two originals?  Simply put, it would have been impossible.  Al Pacino, although less effective in this installment, is still a standard by which all good acting should be measured.  Diane Keaton is HEROIC in the way she is able to reprise her role so well, having for me the distinction of being the ONLY actor in the film who seems to carry over her  performance almost EXACTLY from one film to the next.  And in the absence of the work she does here, the film would have no ""tie that binds"" other than the storyline that, for me, CONTINUES...but doesn't necessarily CONVINCE.

Godfather III is worth renting and worth watching.  The problem for me is that it is not worthy of being in the same class of the two films that precede it.  And that is the biggest tragedy of the Corleone saga alone.  It has a beginning, a middle, and NO END.  Just a feeble attempt at one.",1198540800,,3821,4.5101744186046515

447042,5,6302158176,"I personally really did love this Godfather film, and even thought it was more enjoyable than number II (there I said it).  I would first like to mention this though, and that is to stop bashing Sofia Coppola.  It's not as if Diane Keaton was at first a good choice in the first film (sometimes her character drove me nuts, but this changed by Part II).  While, yes there is one scene in particular that was not one of Sofia's best (and if you listen to the commentary, not really a fault of hers), I otherwise fell in love with her character when watching this film.  I'm about to mention a spoiler here, so if you haven't watched this, don't read this sentence.  When her character is killed at the end of the film, I really felt the shock and pain that Michael had for the death of his daughter.  I literally screamed at the screen for her to get out of the way when the gunman was getting prepared.  This scene contained Al Garcia's flaw, because I wasn't convinced when he screamed ""No!"" after he saw that she was shot.  Otherwise, I thought his performance was just perfect, displaying how he carried Sonny's tough attitude.  I was so happy to see that Gordon Willis remained the photographer, though I wouldn't see why Francis would choose anyone else.  Carmine Coppola was able to add in some wonderful, lovely original music, while also remaining very faithful to Nino Rota's haunting score (having worked on the first two films, in particular, Godfather Part II).  I wish it was more represented on the soundtrack.  In fact, we even have the treat of seeing him conduct the orchestra in the beginning party sequence.  I loved Al Pacino's different approach to Michael, because now we see that he wants to make himself move more in a legitimate direction (unlike what he told Kay in the first film), and this he even states, which causes him to be pulled back into a non-legitimate state again.  We see him getting tired of having men killed, and he basically is less than the monster that he had become in Part II.  While I am also disappointed that Robert Duvall did not reprise his role, I thought that George Hamilton was a fine replacement, though he did seem to not care to hear about Tom Hagen when Tom's son (played by the wonderful John Savage), was leaving for Rome.  The use of the opera I thought was a magnificent idea from Coppola and Puzo, and helped the film out in a very dramatic and theatrical way (not to mention its operatic tendencies).  The moment where Vincent reacts to the opera's own version of someone's ear being bitten I thought was actually pretty humorous.  I don't know if this was intentional, but you have to want to laugh at it.  And it was wonderful to finally see Talia Shire's character expanded upon, so that we can see Shire's extraordinary acting as this character to its fullest, and rather sexy in her delivery.  Yes, the film is definitely unique in its own way, and touches upon a rather heavy subject too, which made it all the more intense.  While it may have been made for money, I'm still glad it was made.  I thought that Francis made a daring choice making another movie that was a continuation of a story that ended (or in this case, stopped) 16 years ago, and the result was nothing short of amazing, surprising, and satisfying.",1198281600,,3291,4.5423728813559325

447055,5,6302158176,"I confess it! ""Godfather III"" is one of my favorite movies. All right, it has less-than-perfect moments, but it also has memorable ones, such as the touching confessional scene between Michael (Al Pacino) and the Cardinal (Raf Vallone) in the cloister, and the reconciliation of Michael and Kay (Diane Keaton) in Don Tommasino's dining room.

I especially enjoy the Italian locations, and since I spent the `80s in Italy, amidst rumors about what was commonly regarded as the suspicious death of John Paul I; the scandals of the Vatican Banco Ambrosiano (with the banker Calvi hanging from the London bridge); the P-2 scandals in the highest posts of the government, not to mention numerous assassinations of judges in Sicily, the background of the story--the last half of which takes place in Sicily--rang true for me. Furthermore--and more importantly--Coppola's brilliant use of recurrent visual and thematic imagery renders the film outstanding not only on its own merits but also in respect to the first two films. Besides the well-discussed use of oranges whenever a catastrophe is imminent, Coppola constantly juxtaposes themes of religion and death, replicating the events of the story--the biting of the ear; the religious procession, the veiling of the head--with those of Mascagni's magnificent opera about death, revenge, and religion in Sicily: ""Cavalleria Rusticana."" Coppola intersperses scenes of the opera with scenes of actual vendetta, as the plans of Vincenzo--the new godfather--are carried to their violent conclusion. The part I love the best, though, is when Coppola transfers the tragedy taking place onstage in the opera, outside onto the steps of the opera house--life imitating art. That final choreographed scene, staged to the heart-rending music of Mascagni, gets me every time (Please pass some more Kleenex tissue!).

Al Pacino's silent scream on the steps of the opera house embodies the mask of Greek tragedy. And tragic irony renders ""Godfather III"" particularly powerful, when the film is viewed in the context of the whole. For instance, the preservation of the family is the device that moves the plot of the entire trilogy. The crimes committed first by Vito Corleone and then by Michael are committed in order to keep the family safe, even though the meaning of 'family' becomes distorted from its original significance during the course of the trilogy. In ""Godfather III,"" however, the aging Michael, who is trying to become a pillar of society in order to preserve his immediate family, accomplishes the very opposite of what he intended. The final scenes of ""Godfather I"" and ""Godfather III""--both set in gardens--emphasize the tragedy. Whereas Vito Corleone dies in the garden, alone except for the youngest member of the family--his toddler grandson--at his feet, Michael Corleone dies in the garden, alone--except for a dog at his feet. Classic examples of tragic irony!

I wish that Coppola would reprise his ""Godfather Saga"" which he made for television in the seventies. He reshuffled the scenes so that the narrative ran in chronological order from the funeral of Vito's father in Sicily at the beginning of ""Godfather I"" to the shooting of Fredo at end of ""Godfather II."" In combination with this particular format, ""Godfather III"" would make an especially effective tragic finish to the trilogy. The entire saga would then recall the Greek dramatist Aeschylus's trilogy. The original saga of family and its disintegration through revenge and murder, ""The Oresteia"" depicts the fall of the House of Atreus, just as the Godfather trilogy depicts the fall of the House of Corleone.

When I once made this observation to my daughter, she gave me a sarcastic look and said: ""Mom, you're over-educated!""

447056,1,6302158176,"Positively AWFUL. I don't know how the same brilliant director who brought us the first two installments of ""The Godfather"", as well as ""Apocalypse Now"" (surely one of the finest films ever made), could have also produced this embarrassing slop of a film. If you loved parts 1 and 2, PLEASE: preserve them in your mind by not watching 3. Coppola ruined the character of Michael Corleone by giving Al Pacino a terribly weak script to work with and surrounding him with bland mediocre acting talent (and that is being very kind). The 2nd film should have been the end of the saga: it ended precisely the way it should have, with Michael left utterly alone. It stayed true to the character and to the absolute consequences of his deeds. Part 3 tries to turn him back into a likable, ""gone soft"" old fart, which is nothing short of cinematic blasphemy. Michael Corleone is one of the great mob characters of all film; what Coppola did to him in this movie is a travesty. The acting is laughably bad, especially Sofia Coppola's painful performance as Michael's daughter Mary and her 1991 Razzie Award was well-deserved. In fact, Razzies are the only award this movie merited. The fact that it received 8 Academy Award Nominations is a total mystery. Cinematography, maybe, but Best Director? Best Supporting Actor? Best Film??? Come on! That's all the proof anyone needs that the Academy Awards are a pompous popularity contest. Rent something else, I beg you. Parts 1 and 2 are IT and they are all you need.

447057,3,6302158176,"I don't hate this movie, it has several strong points, but in truth I can't say it's a great end to the Godfather series.  I've come to the conclusion that Godfather II should have been the last Michael Corleone film.  That's because every time I watch it I get chills during those last few moments, a piece of perfect and haunting cinema history.  Somehow those last seconds sum up everything Michael might have had and everything he might have been - they are utterly heartbreaking.  And they are enough.  The message didn't need to be carried into a third film explaining about Michael's regrets - from the end of part 2 we already knew!  Michael has had his brother killed and is emotionally dead, so we don't really need to see his physical death and deterioration in Part 3.

So what did I like about Part 3?  Several scenes stick in my mind.  When Vincent killed Joe Zaza there was a flash of Vito / Sonny / Michael from the old days.  When Michael told Kay he'd always loved her and she said it back, I couldn't hold back the tears, although it did feel a little contrived since Kay had remarried and we weren't given a sense of who her new husband was.  The ending was the best bit, symbolic and achingly sad.  Al Pacino's final moments were heartbreaking, as I knew they would be.

The performances are generally good, particularly from Al Pacino, although his character unfortunately no longer requires him to use his remarkable quiet voiced anger that he displayed so chillingly in the first two films.  I thought Andy Garcia was only OK as Vincent, his character wasn't really fleshed out enough to be truly compelling.  Talia Shire's character, Connie, seemed to be a completely different woman, and it was strange how Michael suddenly let her sit in on business meetings.  The main problem I had was that Mary, Michael's daughter, and Vincent, did not have any chemistry between them so it was impossible to see how they had fallen in love.  Their romance was unrealistic because they never acted 'in love', there were no intense glances as there were between Apollonia and Michael in Godfather 1, for example.  The whole 'forbidden romance between cousins' plot seemed unneccesary and a bit of a strange choice.  I also would have liked more closure on Michael's first marriage to Apollonia, it wasn't clear if he ever told Kay before or how she found out or how she (or their children) felt about it, they didn't even seem surprised which didn't seem quite right.

Overall, the Godfather III is a difficult movie to review.  It isn't a classic like part 1 and 2, but it's not terrible either.  I just question whether it was ever needed in the first place.  Perhaps 'Part 3' should have been left up to our imaginations, with Al Pacino's dark-eyed intensity from the final scenes of Godfather 2 forever etched in our minds.",1172620800,,2840,4.647294589178356
447058,5,6302158176,"I consider this movie a fitting endpiece to the saga of the Corleone Family.  I think it is the best and most deeply moving piece of the Trilogy.

It is about the end game of the quintessential idealist, Michael Corleone.

Whereas his father (Marlin Brando) was the honor bound pragmatist, his brother Sonny was the violent loose cannon, his brother Freco was the gutless whiner, Michael was moved by his ideals and what he considered was right.

In Godfather 1, we see him throwing away his ideals for Family protection, and in Godfather 2, we see him turned to stone by his own actions.  This is stressed in the Birthday party scene at the end of Godfather 2.

In Godfather 3, we see a sick and dying Godfather haunted by the once idealistic Michael Corleone he was.  The idealism is returning to him, and of neccesity there had to be recompence for the earlier sins he did.  Yet the Sins of the Father affected all of his attempted repentance.  He paid the ultimate price at the end by the death of his daughter being part of the neccesary attonement.  And after all that, in the end, he has visions of dancing with the most important women in his life, all which he threw away by his behavior.  He died totally alone and unloved.

My favorite caracter was Joe Montagna (Joey Zasa)  When Vince blew him away, I cheered!  Could that caracter be based on John Gotti?  Hmmmmm...",1168300800,2,1378,4.522267206477733
447059,5,6302158176,"The third part is nearly the most interesting because we finally have

these Corleones in the modern world. They have sold their casinos and

gambling institutions, they have never been in drugs or prostitution

and the new Godfather, Michael Corleone, wants to get respectable,

recognized by the catholic church and world influential. So he tries to

donate big quantities of money to the Vatican bank in exchange of a

majority share in the Vatican's real estate institution. He fails at

first but goes on and tries to find the invisible ways into the

labyrinth. So he makes friends with as many people as possible in the

financial, religious and political circles around the church. He finds

out he has to go to Sicilia to get in touch with an important cardinal

who is actually elected Pope, but does not last more than a few months.

They have special teas that make you sleep very long in the Vatican.

But this third part shows a great evolution of the Sicilian-American

and Italian-American communities in the US. Violence is becoming less

and less easy in the US. They have to respect the law and law-enforcing

institutions are too strong and powerful for them to be neglected or

under-evaluated. Then there is a shift in that mafia violence. The

Corleones going to Sicilia, among other things to take part in the

first operatic production of Michael's own son who is an opera tenor,

violence catches them up and Sicilia becomes the theatre of what they

can't do in the US any more. And once again Michael goes through and is

well protected by the men of his nephew who he has just appointed his

successor, and also by chance. The final gun directed at him cannot be

prevented from firing, though the assassin will be shot back on the

spot by the new Don Corleone, but Michael is once again lucky and the

bullet does not reach him. For more details rush to the DVD. Thus the

third part ends in drama, even melodrama. But it is definitely clearer

than the second that is too long and too complex and entangled. We seem

though to be living the last powerful years of this family that has to

accept the challenge of becoming legal and respectable. In other words

the world is changing and the mafia along with it.

While he attempts to link the Corleone's finances with the Vatican, Michael must deal with the machinations of a hungrier gangster seeking to upset the existing Mafioso order and a young protg's love affair with his daughter.

This movie was probably not necessary but its here and although it is leagues behind Parts I and II, its still a great movie. I think that's it greatest fault too, that its predecessor's were so great that it couldn't help but be inferior. Al Pacino gives us an aged Michael Corleone but, at least to me, he wasn't as believable as he was in the previous two. Here he was Al Pacino and lacked the intensity and, well, believability of the character he showed previously. Maybe that's because of the character's age and he's so different than what we have perceived him as in the other two movies. But, you eventually accept him again as Michael and Pacino gives another stellar performance. Talia Shire returns as Connie, Michael's sister only this time she tries to pull some strings and get into things. Shire's performance is good but the problem is that this is unbelievable for the character. In the previous two Godfather films she was there, not involved in the business in any way and suddenly here she's thrown herself into the fray. Andy Garcia plays Vinnie, Sonny's illegitimate son. He plays Pacino Sonny's role in the original Godfather and it seems he's trying to imitate James Caan's presence instead of being his son. It works in the long run but it feels like he could have done something more with the character. Diane Keaton is Michael's ex-wife Kay. She doesn't really do much until near the end of the movie and seems like she is only there to further the ending of the movie. Her role is very detached from what she did in Parts I and II where she was Michael's loving wife whom he was trying to hold on to. Here, she's married to another man and doesn't have an impact on Michael until, as I said, the ending and even there her role isn't vital. Sofia Coppola is Mary Corleone, Michael's daughter, and she completely slaughters the character. Did she know that this film wasn't a comedy? She doesn't speak in the movie, she awkwardly yells and is reminiscent of the stereotypical bad actor that reads their lines monotonously. And George Hamilton takes over Robert Duvall's role as B.J. Harrison. George Hamilton? Whoever the hell decided to replace Duvall after he refused to reprise his role should be shot but then to go and cast George Hamilton was just wrong. He sticks out and I was waiting for him to rip open a bad of Baked Ritz crackers and start munching on them. I'm sorry but I just couldn't take him seriously. The rest of the cast does their job well and their really isn't a weak link outside of Sofia.

I personally didn't think the music was as good as it was in the previous two installments. There wasn't anything memorable outside of the ""Godfather Waltz"". That's not to say it was bad, because it wasn't. The music perfectly complemented each scene it was used in. It's just that it wasn't as good as previous efforts.

I don't think this should have been called The Godfather Part III, it should have been titled The Godfather: The Musical because after every few scenes another musical piece would pop up. This, accompanied with the editing, made it feel like a TV movie. At the end of 97% of each scene the transition was a fade to black. I was honestly expecting a commercial to pop up one of these times. There were just too many musical pieces in the film as well. We get a long one at the beginning, a few shorter ones scattered throughout the middle and another long one at the end. The whole final movement of the film in which two intrigues are inter cut with Anthony performing in an opera are supposed to be suspenseful, but they're not. They're so confusing that we don't even know where the hell one of the intrigues is taking place. Is it in Rome? Sicily? London? I don't know.

The whole of the movie is a tad convoluted and hard to believe. Michael is trying to go legit with...the Vatican? This only adds to the confusion of the movie. This entry is easier to grasp and understand what's going on than Part II was but you are left scratching your head at some points. This will definitely require a second viewing just as Part II does. Another problem is that this feels like a sequel unlike Part II, which felt like a natural continuation of the original. You're also just thrown into this world without so much as an introduction or a re acquaintance to some characters so you're left to figure it out on your own which can be pretty annoying when you're trying to do that and follow the complex storyline all at once. But one of the biggest eyebrow raisers is the incest plotline. That's right. Vinnie and Mary are first cousins but are in love with each other. The movie even acknowledges that this is wrong but it's still kept. At the it is supposed to hit us hard due to the circumstances but it just doesn't because you didn't believe in it in the first place because it is wrong. That plotline was unneeded and came out of left field. That was probably the worst addition to this film next to Sofia herself.

But what really brings this movie together is its spectacular ending. The whole scene on the steps is superbly shot and you really feel the raw surge of emotion that's going on in that scene. You feel for Michael because of everything he did to try and right his wrongs thus far. But directly after that is the death of Michael Corleone which is tragic yet fulfilling. He is 77 years old and retired to Sicily, alone and distraught when he dies from a stroke. Before he dies he thinks of the women he loved and ultimately lost due to his choices in life. We feel for this character and when he dies, at least with me, a surge of emotion came over because you think back to the journey we went through with this man and here is the end of a legacy. The whole way it is shot and presented struck a chord with me and was the highlight of the movie Michael is alone with nobody left because they are either dead or have left him. It's a sad way to go but perfectly executed here. The music that accompanies it is superb as well. It isn't an original piece conducted for the movie but it works amazingly well. It adds so much to the scene and is a great listen on its own. I cannot say enough good things about this ending. Its just superb and a truly great way to end this monumental series.

The Godfather Part III is a great movie. It isn't up to snuff with its predecessors but it can't be expected to be. It is wholly undeserving of the bad rep it gets because underneath, there is a great movie that has just gotten flack for being inferior and a sequel. Despite some rough edges and lacking in areas that the original two excelled in, The Godfather Part III is very worthy of bearing the Godfather name.",1158537600,4,7569,4.463872832369942

Two good things about this movie, Pachino's performance and very beautiful cinematography. Everything else is pure garbage. The Godfather had three sons. Sonny, Michael, and Fredo.

Al Pacino is outstanding, as usual, and Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Eli Wallach and the rest of the supporting cast are impressive.  Nepotism, and Winona Ryder's unavailability, however, subjected the audience to Sophia Coppola.  What can be said about this winsome and homely AWFUL actress?

447127,4,6302158176,"At the end of the 1980s, Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Studios was nearly bankrupt.  Zoetrope needed money, and it didn't take a genius to figure out how to get it.  They would make another GODFATHER movie.  And that is how, sixteen years after THE GODFATHER: PART II, we were given THE GODFATHER: PART III.

The film begins in 1979.  Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has finally given up his life of crime and is building a reputation as a respectable philanthropist.  When Victor Mancini (Andy Garcia), the illegitimate son of Michael's deceased brother Sonny, asks Michael for work, Michael finds himself drawn in once more to a life of crime.  Cocky gangster Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna) starts a gang war while Victor falls in love with Michael's daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola), deepening Michael's troubles.  As an enraged Michael says, ""Just when I thought that I was out, they PULL me back in!""

That was the mood of many audiences as well.

In defense of the film, THE GODFATHER: PART III is far from a bad movie.  In fact, it's a very good movie.  However, when compared to the first two GODFATHER films - arguably the greatest movies ever made - PART III looks very, very weak.  For the most part, the acting is excellent.  Pacino is very moving.  His performance as Michael in this film closer resembles the younger Michael from THE GODFATHER than the ruthless fiend from THE GODFATHER: PART II.  Andy Garcia as Victor, Michael's young protege, is excellent.  Returning cast members Diane Keaton and Talia Shire are great.  George Hamilton's character is a substitute for Robert Duvall, who couldn't agree to the low paycheck for the film.  Bridget Fonda has a brief, but enjoyable, appearance.  The big flaw in the cast is Sofia Coppola.  Sofia, Francis Ford Coppola's daughter, is now best-known for directing films such as THE VIRGIN SUICIDES and LOST IN TRANSLATION.  As a director, she is very talented; as an actor, she is not so talented.  Sofia is woefully miscast as Michael Corleone's daughter, though Winona Ryder - the original choice for Mary Corleone, who had to pull out at the last minute to perform in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS - would have been miscast as well.

Coppola's directing and his script, co-written by GODFATHER author Mario Puzo, is great, but it lacks the power and feeling that it had in the original GODFATHER movies.  Gordon Willis' cinematography, which was magnificent in the original films, isn't half as impressive here, though it has its moments.  The real problem with THE GODFATHER: PART III is that it shouldn't exist.  Though it is an interesting addition to the saga, it was made for money, not because it needed to be made, and to say it pales in comparison to parts I and II is an understatement.  Still, I would recommend seeing it, if only to quell your curiousity, and for the film's ending, which is truly stellar.",1155081600,,2863,4.811475409836065
447128,5,6302158176,"Yes it is true, this is the least entertaining of the Godfather Trilogy, however it does have a few sparkles that shine in the darkness. What many people might fail to see is that this film does reflect the nature of transition which took place not only in the Mob, but also in America.

 The film documents how slowly but surely another generation takes a hold of the reigns, only instead of a worthy successor the torch is passed reluctantly to someone incapable of filling the shoes of the title. It reflects America (and much of Western Culture,) in the fact that we too have been protected for so long from ""the horrors of this world"" that we are not even aware of the proper way to fight them. One gets the sense that Vincent (played by Andy Garcia,) although a very competent leader is not quite up to challenge to take over the Family.

 For me this was one of the primary shortcomings of the film, yes Sophia was terribly and a waste of film but the real tragedy of this film was the lack of depth to Andy Garcia's character. The man is a supreme actor and could have easily offered an Oscar performance if given the chance. The film should have focused more on Michael attempting to maintain the protection of his family through his sister and his nephew, not as the film really materialized. However, despite that judgement I do believe this film is worth your time.

  Godfather part III is interesting in that it presents how deep corruption can truly go, it also shows the viewer just how quickly life can become complicated and that sometimes the solution to those complications ends in utter sadness. The film is quite appropiate for the nature of the times in which it was written (the 1990's,) and if it can teach anything to us, it is that we have to live our lives without letting the corruptions and horrors of this world get to us. In the end Family is the only thing that really matters.",1154908800,,1910,4.471264367816092
447129,4,6302158176,"Like others I have watched the Godfather movies religiously and watched the third installment somewhat with a low expectations because of the negative reviews. Of course coming back to a loved story after so many years is not an easy thing. The movie isn't bad by any means. Just the religious and cult like following the first two Godfather has, it's hard to live up to.

Three things that I thought took away from the quality of the film:

1. Sofia Coppola: she was not good in this movie at all. At times she looked bored, most of the time she looked confused. I believe Francis Ford Coppola, being her father didn't push her enough to the performance the movie deserved from such an important character. Winona Ryder was said to been a contender for this role.

2. Robert Duvall: One of the Best actors from the original cast was left out from this film because of money. He is quoted recently as saying, ""I said I would work easily if they paid Pacino twice what they paid me, that's fine. But not three or four times, which is what they did,"" recalls Ducal. His absence and the addition of Sofia was a smack in the face of diehard fans.

3. Andy Garcia: Don't get me wrong, he's a good actor but he acted like all he did was research on mob guys, I didn't get the impression that he was ever a tough guy in real life. Someone like Johnny Depp would have killed in this role.

There are alot of really good reviews on the movies so I won't write anything long but these three things took away from the quality of the movie for me. I couldn't believe these characters as much as the originals. An excellent gangster movie on it's own, but within the Godfather trilogy definitely the weakest.",1153094400,,1695,4.402555910543131
447130,1,6302158176,"My favorite movie of all time is The Godfather.  The Godfather Part II is my 2nd favorite.  Sadly, Coppola decided to make a part III.  While I looked forward to this movie with great anticipation, this film not only didn't live up to its legacy, it fell short of being even a good Pacino movie.

While much has been said (appropriately so) about Sofia Coppola's performance as Michael Corleone's daughter Mary, I will make one further comment... I'm glad to see she has made a great name for herself behind the camera, because she should never again be in front of it.  While it could be said she wasn't given much to work with (only a sick story of her falling in love with her cousin), she showed that she has no future in acting.  Her performance was one of the worst I've seen in any movie.

The plot (what there is of one) surrounds Michael trying to make his family legitimate, but they keep ""pulling him back in.""  He has somehow risen to the point of multi billionaire, who gets involved with the Vatican, and even coordinates the murder of the pope.  Meanwhile his son is now a talented opera singer who is making his debut in Sicily, bringing his parents back together to see his performance.

The movie goes to great extremes to bring back a lot of the characters (played by the original actors) from the first 2 movies, including the girl Sonny was boffing against the door when Tom came to find him.  However, they got interesting with the casting for new characters, including Eli Wallach and Anthony Garcia playing Italians.  Odd.

All in all, this is a very poorly done movie with an extremely weak ending and no real plot line.  It was more of a retrospective of characters than a new movie idea.  I have the first 2 movies on both DVD and VHS.  I do not own and will not pay for the third.",1152835200,8,1808,4.4169184290030215
447131,5,6302158176,"I enjoyed this film even more than the acclaimed Godfather II and it provides a seamless and accomplished finale to the Godfather series. There is another awesome performance from Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, supported superbly by Diane Keaton,Talia Shire , Andy Garcia and Sofia Coppola who plays Michael's beloved daughter Mary. Godfather III is set in 1979 and deals with the declining years of Michael Corleone and his desire to distance himself from his gangster past and to achieve the respectabilty and legitimacy he craves for. This leads him into financial dealings with the Vatican and involves him in a brilliant, but controversial sub-plot concerning a web of corruption and murder within the Roman Catholic hierarchy. However it is family, tradition, revenge , love and power which are the main themes of the film. Michael's desire to mend fences with ex wife Kay and his relationship with his two children are superbly explored, yet his repemtance and paternal love remain always shadowed by a murderous criminal past that he cannot shake off. The climax of this film is superb, one of the best endings to any film I have seen, full of tension ,suspense and brilliantly directed by Coppola. The poignant final scene is a perfect conclusion to the whole trilogy.",1151280000,3,1277,5.028301886792453
447132,4,6302158176,"Nominated for several major Oscars, the curiously underrated THE GODFATHER: PART III (1990) is the work of a master filmmaker--Francis Ford Coppola--still at the peak of his powers.  Filmed on location in New York City, Rome, and Sicily, the movie is a feast for gangster film lovers.  For starters, it has all been elegantly designed by Dean Tavoularis and costumed by Milena Canonero almost entirely in browns and blacks and whites.  And I believe the great Gordon Willis finally got his GODFATHER Oscar nomination for brilliant cinematography.  This is filmmaking of a very high order.

Essentially, the story has the Corleone family coming to Vatican City around 1980 to give a huge sum of money--blood money--to the Catholic church, and the church in Rome trying to decide whether to take such a huge sum of blood money.  There is more than enough violence to satisfy red meat GODFATHER fans, especially a massacre inside an Atlantic City casino, a street shooting during an Elizabeth Street (lower Manhattan) festival, an elegant don (a great Eli Wallach) eating poisoned pastry (!), and the elaborate climax inside a Sicilian opera house during a performance of ""Cavalleria Rusticana"".  The opera action mirrors killings similtaneously taking place all through the opera house.

But this is a very mellow and poignant drama, with the violence really in the background.  It was made a full sixteen years after the Oscar-winning Part Two (1974), and the actors are also sixteen years older.  Al Pacino plays Michael very quiet and low-keyed as the character deals with diabetes and a weak heart.  He has made peace with former wife Kay (a never-better or lovelier Diane Keaton).  Kay stands in a darkened study looking at a photo from Lake Tahoe in part two, her younger self.  Much later, she and Michael will travel to Sicily; he will show her some of the places he grew up in and hid out in from the first movie (1972).  Much later still, there is a montage with Michael and daughter Mary (a much maligned and quite charming Sofia Coppola), then Michael in part one dancing with his doomed Sicilian bride, then Michael and Kay dancing at Lake Tahoe in part two.

The movies play off one another so beautifully when seen on consecutive nights.

The grand party in the first half hour is pure Coppola home movie and wonderful, with everyone having a great time eating and dancing in Canonero's beautiful costumes.  I especially cherish a throwaway improvisation moment that Coppola clearly adores on the audio commentary:  young Gia Coppola wants to dance with Mary and Michael, so a two-some becomes a three-some.  Very lovely.  And, incidentally, I LIKE Sofia Coppola in this movie.  Damn it, she is nervous and vulnerable, but that is what the character of Mary calls for!  She is perfect for the role, better than originally cast Winona Ryder would have been, and Coppola is obviously proud to have her in the movie as a home movie on his commentary.  Her scenes with Andy Garcia are very touching, and Coppola hilariously adds a recipe for Yukki in the movie.  ""My movies should at very least have one food recipe in them,"" he hilariously notes.  Corleone movie fans will also remember that baby Sofia was the infant Michael at the end of part one in 1972.

It is no secret that I have been hospitalized for two heart attacks in the past fifteen years.  And I have diabetes.  So the scenes with a hospitalized Michael (recalling his father--Brando's Don Vito in the first film--hospitalized), and Michael needing orange juice and a chocolate bar in a Vatican City garden after a diabetic attack, have a special poignancy for me.  There is also a dark comedy moment in that same (or a similar) Vatican City garden where Michael wants to confess his sins to priest Raf Vallone.  As Vallone listens patiently to the confessions, including having his sister's husband and his brother Fredo killed, he gasps.  But he tells Michael sympathetically that God forgives him if he will sin no more.  It is a hilarious scene, but Michael does not take his advice because the film's last half hour is a bloodbath.  One death on the opera house steps after the performance, and a silent agony scream from Michael, packs a wallop.  The very last scene is quiet and deeply moving.  Corleone family movie fans will definitely be very satisfied.  And be glad that Coppola's original title was not used; it would have given away the ending!

THE GODFATHER: PART THREE runs 170 minutes in its Authorized Director's Cut, which is nine minutes longer than the 161 minute theatrical version.  It flows smoothly and leisurely, with a skillful blending of brutal murder scenes and quiet domestic moments.  The brilliant and Oscar-winning film editors are Barry Malkin, Lisa Fruchtman, and Walter Murch.  Coppola truly misses Robert Duvall as the family lawyer, on the audio commentary, and is much too hard on replacement George Hamilton.  I think Hamilton is very good in a few scenes, but agree that Duvall would have been better.  I also think, again, that Sofia Coppola, now an Oscar-winning filmmaker (LOST IN TRANSLATION), is satisfying as the likeable and poignant Mary.  Joe Mantegna has a few powerful scenes as Joey Zaza.  And Eli Wallach is magnificent as an aging villain.

Should there be a GODFATHER IV?  Francis Coppola discusses that on the audio commentary to my deluxe DVD boxed set.  Even after two decades, Paramount executives were still hassling him--begging him to make another GODFATHER film for them, but it absolutely MUST be in theaters for Christmas 1990.  That was an enormous challenge that included writing the original script with Mario Puzo and filming all over the world, then editing a three hour movie within one year.  When Michael says in a kitchen set, ""Just when I think I am out, they pull me back in!"", that was also Francis talking about making another GODFATHER film.  But he makes them so well!  And obviously was still supervising final cut editing when the movie hit home video.

I think Coppola has a good twenty years of filmmaking left in him.  Anyone can make good wine.  Maybe Sofia could help on the screenplay as an Oscar-winning screenwriter.  Maybe that, and definitely not acting, is her niche.  There is so much material with the Corleone family left to tell.  Intercut the 1930's and 1940's with the 1990's, like Part Two, as a four hour HBO blockbuster.  Or just do the 1930's and 1940's for three hours theatrically.  If you watch the chronological order recut movie, there is a jarring gap of fifteen years between Michael leaving Sicily in 1930 and Bonasera talking with Don Vito in 1945 New York City.  What exactly happens to this family during the Depression and World War Two?  I'd love to know, and I'd love to have a still master filmmaker tell me.  Until that future time, we have three excellent GODFATHER films that play off one another poignantly and powerfully on DVD when watched on three consecutive nights--actually four, including the bonus disk.",1150761600,6,7010,4.869087837837838

See for yourself of course, it must be watched, but this movie is a shadow of the other ""Godfather"" movies.  I was rooting with all my heart for this to be a great movie, and even though it broke my heart, I can watch it now with a sense of humor and enjoy all its silly aspects.  It's a fun ""bad"" movie, draped in the greatness of its parents.

Many of the scenes seem as if they were early takes that didn't quite work, and many of the characters come off as almost comical stereotypes.  The film even earns a surreal edge through the plot; Michael's daughter starts an affair with her first cousin, Fraedo's[...] son.  An Appalacian twist to a Godfather movie?  Michael donates $100 million dollars to Sicilian charities.  He's a billionaire?  And all of it goes to Sicily (that's $20 a Sicilian)?  How the hell did Michael get so rich, was he deep in Microsoft early on?  I remember hearing that Coppolla was frantically rewriting the script as he filmed; it shows.

Perhaps those that can see this as a great flawed film are the lucky ones, but I just can't get there.  Enjoy it for what it is; a rushed campy version of the others, with some valiant efforts by some of the actors (Garcia, Montegna, Pacino at times).

447184,4,6302158176,"I thought that was an apt quote from this film since, to many reviewers, this film is the Corleone 'bad memory'...but I disagree.  Other than the obvious fact that Sophia Coppola makes a MUCH better director than actress (her role would have been better suited for Italian actresses like Monica Bolluci or Asia Argento, but alas) the film still stands as a great movie.  No, it doesn't carry the same weight as the previous two, but that's mostly because this film focuses less on the Corleone family and more on the Church.  Al Pucino is SPOT on in this film, and whats great here is that with all three films we see a gradual progression of his charactor, starting in the first film as a man lost in is own steps and then in the second film as a strong and dangerous man and now finally in the third film we see the man that is Michael Corleone, not the gangster, not the son but the man he always meant to be.  This film follows as Michael reluctantly takes on his nephew (Sonny's son) Vincent (Andy Garcia) as an aprentice sort-of-speak, training him in the ways of the family business.  As a deal with the Church goes bad Michael is drug back into the world he thought he was leaving behind.  Michael wants to be legit now, he wants to be a good man, and throughout this film he's trying to prove that to Kay (Diane Keaton) as he tries to be there for his family.  Vincent has brought his own baggage to the table, and as he starts an affair with Michael's daughter (Sophia Coppola) there is turmoil as both Michael and Kay try and seperate them.  The film is much different then the first two but that doesn't make it a bad movie.

447185,3,6302158176,"This review has spoilers of Godfather Part I and II:

I'll go ahead and rate this film after having seen it recently after seeing before several years ago. I think I can more fairly judge this film now, considering for some time I was extremely bitter for Paramount having a ""behind the scenes"" promo BEFORE the VHS version of the feature film, which actually showed scenes of the ENDING! Needless to say, giving spoilers of the film before playing it, ruins a film. Fortunately, DVDs have menus so no studio in their right mind would do such a thing.

Granted, this wasn't the greatest movie, or even a great movie. But it is good and better than 90% of films out there. But it doesn't match up with the other two films in any way. Adding to the fact that this movie was undoubtadly a disappointment (after watching the first two beforehand for the first time), the spoilers really turned me off this film.

But that was a while ago, and when I saw this again recently, I had forgotten the exact details and focused more on the storyline , acting, and other merits.

I'll start off by saying that Pacino's acting in this film, as in the first two parts is great. At times he seems a bit over the top, but he conveys the emotions of a regretful old man haunted by his past crimes, especially the killing of his brother Fredo. I actually think his acting in this was better than his acting in ""Scent of a Woman"", which he won an Academy Award for.

Anyways, the rest of the plot is interesting and involves the Vatican. It's actually not a bad plot.

I think what ruins this film for many are two things: Sophia Copolla's wretched acting and the bizarre incest relationship between her character and her cousin's. Copolla is even worse an acress than she is a director (granted I've only seen one - ""Lost in Translation"" which I found terribly overrated). She wasn't ready for such a major role as this in her first acting job.

But looking past the relationship and the terrible acting by Sophia, I still don't believe this to be a terrible film. It's not a film you'll see as many times as the originals (which never get old), but it's worth a viewing or two. And that makes it worth three stars IMO.

But I can't fault those that would recommend only the first two and pan this (it may be better looked as the first and second being one very large epic film and having it end there for those that are also fan of the original Godfather novel by Puzo  - which never covered anything that was in this film). Looked upon in comparison to the others, it really isn't worth more than 1 (or 2 if being generous), but by itself...it's not that bad. The plot and direction are all well presented.

In the end, I say it's worth atleast one viewing to decide for yourself. I would probably still recommend the Godfather DVD Collection which also has the bonus disc.",1146873600,2,2857,4.424761904761905
447186,4,6302158176,"Many of you may completely disagree with what I am about to say but I definitely enjoyed it more than the second installment.  For those of us how enjoy flawed characters which showcase depth, you will agree.  The only flaw I find in the movie is the plot involving the Catholic Church. Other than that, it is truly a spectacular movie. Al Pacino does a fantasic job portraying Michael Corleone's quest for redemption, from his life of crime to his estranged Kay.  This movie is the story of his decline, and a graceful decline it was, showcasing his maturity and his willingness and determination to 'get out' and go legit. Another suprising character to me was Connie, who's character in this movie evolved to more of a matriarch with a definite influence in Corleone family affairs. Just because this movie does not have the violence or more of the mafioso feel as the first two do does not make it a bad movie. On the contrary, it makes it stand out from the other two because of the difference. However, it does not make it any less of a movie.",1146614400,,1049,4.510526315789473
447187,4,6302158176,"I stayed away from this film for a long time, doing a dumb thing: listening to the well-known film critics.

When I finally got around to it, I was very surprised. It was a good film. Not great, not intense as the first two Godfather flicks, but definitely a lot better than advertised.

Many people said this was filled with anti-Roman Catholic propaganda, but I didn't it find that way. Yes, the ""Vatican bank,"" whatever that is, was portrayed as not on the up-and-up, but it was a little confusing to follow, maybe too confusing to get offended! Actually, there were some positive things, religious-wise, with Al Pacino's character, who sought forgiveness for his past sins and made a few very profound statements such as, ""What good is confession if it isn't followed by repentance?""

Anyway, Pacino's acting talents are the main attraction in the lower-key, more cerebral Godfather film. There isn't that much actionbut when it occurs, it's pretty violent. As with the other two films in the series, it's nicely photographed with a lot of nice brown tints.

Finally, director-writer Francis Ford Coppola took a lot of flak for putting his daughter in such an important role but I thought she (Sofia Coppola) was fine and - like this film - unfairly criticized.",1146355200,11,1265,4.869767441860465
447188,4,6302158176,"Many complaints have been made about Part III's supposedly sub-par cast and slow pacing. These charges are true only in a few spots during the film. No, Sofia Coppola was not born to be an actor, but she's supported by enough talent and given such good dialogue (as is everyone) that it's not much of a detriment to the movie. The pacing actually is too fast, in that none of the characters (except for Michael) or any of the plot lines feels really developed like they could have been. But again, this adds up to a small point in the end. As for those who moan about long, ""boring"" stretches of non-violence, they're clearly missing the point of the film (especially the reviewer who advised to ""skip the ending"").  While the first two parts were more in line with the classic gangster genre, I completely agree with the reviewer who compared Part III with Shakespearean tragedy. There's certainly enough philosophical ""meat"" here to do the Bard justice, and had Coppola and Puzo been equally great writers, it may have been one for the ages.  Themes of high religion, politics, personal salvation and their interrelation are dealt with in a way that few films can match (or even attempt). Lines like ""These days, the power to absolve debt is greater than the power to absolve sin"" give the story a higher moral dimension, though not in the sense that what the characters do is actually ""moral."" Likewise, one can ask how Michael's age and illness relate to his desire for repentance. A fear of mortality? A sense of conscience? It's questions like these, and many others, that make this a great film. Don't expect to like this movie if you don't want to think about it.",1145664000,,1671,4.661016949152542

How do you follow up what may be the greatest movie of all time (certainly the penultimate mafia movia) and it's worth successor?  The easy path would have been more of the same.  Instead, we get the story of the Michael Corleone's attempt to run from the corruption.  Interspersed we are shown, but not told, of how people follow their parent's destiny, and how mobsters should not be so glamorized after all.  While many find it unworthy of the initial greatness, I found the dark irony an intriguing way to close the saga.",1143331200,4,578,4.572815533980583
447190,3,6302158176,"Francis Ford Coppola concludes his cinematic biography and film study of the Will to Power of the fictional Corleone Crime Family in THE GODFATHER, PART III (1990). Completed fifteen years after THE GODFATHER, PART II and seventeen years after the original film, this movie is generally considered an unworthy successor to two of the greatest films ever created. In truth, THE GODFATHER, PART III is a far better film than is generally recognized. But as a high quality ""average""  film, it badly pales in comparison to the brilliant 'Part I' and virtually perfect PART II.

In the original, Coppola presented us, by chance, with a mythos of the Father In Age and the Son In Youth. In PART II, he consciously created a study of the Father In Youth and the Son In Middle Age. By this logic, PART III should have been a story of the Father In Middlescence and the Son In Age. But it is not.

Surprisingly, Coppola never seemed to envision the films as such a portrait. Although Coppola does give us the Son In Age in THE GODFATHER, PART III, rather than completing his beautiful tryptych portrait of Vito and Michael as Father And Son, he revisits a theme of the first film, that of The Prodigal Son. By treading the same ground in THE GODFATHER, PART III, he seriously weakens this film.

The Prodigal Son is Vincent Mancini, Michael's uncertain heir-apparent and nephew, the illegitimate son of his deceased brother Sonny Corleone and his sister Connie's (Talia Shire) bridesmaid, Lucy. Vincent is played by Andy Garcia in the only Oscar-caliber performance of his less-than-stellar career. Although initially considered by all to be ""The Next Pacino"" Garcia is a charter member of The Flat Affect School of Acting typified by Kevin Costner and Viggo Mortensen, and over the years has generally proved to be as engaging onscreen as watching a block of wood. Far worse is Sofia Coppola, the Director's daughter and Talia Shire's niece, whose awful performance as Mary Corleone is legendary.

Sensing but never really understanding the central flaw in this film, Coppola tries to close the lacuna with overly-contrived subplots about a rival Don's depredations against the Corleone Family and an international conspiracy to assassinate Pope John Paul I. As a result, THE GODFATHER III occasionally degenerates into a platform for several gratuitously violent scenes, and, at times, takes on the ""B"" air of a spy thriller.

The grand performance of this film is Al Pacino's as the aging Don Michael, who, after a bloodstained lifetime of crass manipulation and loss, is spiritually working toward his own redemption. Although he tries valiantly to legitimize the Corleone Family and distance himself from the sins of his past, the shackles of his life's work are not so easily loosed. In Michael, Pacino gives us a tragic portrayal of a man consumed by his own inner demons who is desperately seeking the one spark of light in his innermost being. Unlike Don Vito however, who lived and died knowing himself, Don Michael can never receive dispensation, and Lear-like, must content himself only with acts of contrition.

Coppola has returned time and again to THE GODFATHER trilogy re-editing and reworking it. Like Don Michael, he wishes to expiate his shortcomings, one of which is the blind spot that obscured this potentially great film.",1140912000,,3336,4.978456014362657
447191,5,6302158176,"Frequently attacked and constantly underappreciated, The Godfather, Part III is often, and unfairly, referred to as one of the biggest disappointments in the history of cinema. When comparing - and I suppose a comparison is inevitable - The Godfather, Part III is certainly not quite as strong as the first two films, both of which are classic masterpieces, practically flawless, to be found in any respectful list of all-time best movies. It was largely a failure both commercially and critically (being nominated for seven Oscars but receiving none). Nevertheless, Part III is a fantastic drama, as good a crime drama as Scorsese's 'Goodfellas', which was released that same year and received much more critical acclaim; certainly the last great film Francis Ford Coppola had directed yet (hopes for 'Youth Without Youth', which has a late 2006 release date). Just like The Godfather, Part II achieved greatness by not trying to recapture the original but being an entirely separate and unique creation, so Part III is a separate creation that stands by its own right, and while it's a continuation of the first two films, it does nothing to subtract from their greatness as some sequels do. The Godfather can work perfectly as a single film, as a two-parter, or as a trilogy; it's a wonderful saga either way.

In many ways, The Godfather, Part III, is closer in its spirit to the first film than to the second. International affairs take second place to character development and human insight. Part III, however, focuses on the character of Michael Corleone deeper than any of the other films. It's debatable whether or not Al Pacino's performance here is stronger here than in Part II - it's clear that he's more experienced and mature an actor than he was in 1974, though he may have lost just a bit of his edge. But while in Part II we saw Michael as a decent man gradually turning into a monster, all the while focusing on his life in comparison with his father, Part III delves more deeply into his soul; the influences of Shakespeare and Sophocles are stronger than ever before, as Michael turns into a tragic hero in the classic Greek sense of the words, a man with, ultimately, good intentions, brought down to his tragic end by fate and by his own flaws. Michael is more human and more pitiable in Part III than ever before, and Pacino is certainly up to the task. Comparisons to Vito are certainly there (watch Michael talk some sense into Vincent, just like Vito did to Sonny in the first film) but they're no longer the focus of the film; this film is about Michael, and so Pacino's performance here is more impressive than in the first two parts.

The rest of the cast is fantastic (although there aren't any actors in the caliber of Brando, De Niro, Caan or Duvall - who was supposed to be in the film but backed out), but other than Diane Keaton and Talia Shire, who reprise their roles from the previous films excellently, the real revelation here is Andy Garcia, who plays Vincent, illegitimate son of Michael's eldest brother Sonny, and friend-of-the-family Lucy Mancini (the affair between Lucy and Sonny is referred to very briefly in the first film, although it plays a large and important part in the original novel). The role of Vincent Corleone is certainly the strongest in Garcia's career, and his only Oscar-nominated one; Vincent is wonderfully reminiscent of his father (played by James Caan in the first film), and he plays an important part of shedding light on the character of Michael Corleone, while never quite stealing the show from Pacino, clearly the center of the story. Also commendable are performances by George Hamilton, Joe Mantegna, Bridget Fonda and Eli Wallach.

There has been much debate about Sofia Coppola's performance as Michael's daughter Mary, so here's my angle on it: it's quite bad indeed, and Sofia proves beyond doubt that she's not an actress. With a lesser cast around her, it wouldn't seem as bad, but next to actors like Pacino, Garcia and Keaton, Coppola seems totally out of place. However, it does little to hurt the film; Mary's part in the film is quite big, but she's mainly there to shed light on Michael and Vincent, and Sofia's less than mediocre performance is ignorable. Thankfully, she quit acting afterwards, and moved on to directing, a field in which she shows much more promise; in fact, the young Miss Coppola shows signs of being one of the most promising young directors of the new millennium.

The Godfather, Part III is a fascinating and thrilling tale, and the last forty five minutes are as gripping as any scene in the first two films; Coppola's directing is as inspired and sensitive as it ever was before, and the dialog is all spotless, believable and captivating. The reference to the death of Pope John Paul I, who died only 33 days after being indicted and whose death remains something of a mystery, is a nice touch, which helps create the sense of realism that was an important aspect of the first two films. It's not as timeless a masterpiece as The Godfather and The Godfather, Part II, but if you loved the first two films, you should by all means watch this third installment, too.",1140134400,3,5186,4.771714922048997

After seeying the entire trilogy for the first time myself, I really don't understand the hate for Part III.

The Godfather part III is a wonderfull movie experience and a wonderfull conclusion of a story that is absolutely fasenating.
Coppola has done what he does best: making movies.

The actors, the sets, the music, everything is perfect in this movie. If you loved the first two, it's not hard to fall in love with this part.
Al Pacino is back as Michael, and does a truly wonderfull job. He plays Michael in a way you haven't seen before. He shows the more emotional, regretfull side of the character.
Andy Garcia is the one that really steals the show along with Pacino. He plays Vincent, the cousin of Michael with such great acting and style, that you get really impressed by him.
Then a part most people complain about, and I think that is totally unnessesary: Sofia Coppola as Michael's daughter. She really is a pleasure for the eye and acts wonderfull. I agree that it wasn't a performance for oscar gold, but she plays Mary like a normal girl. She was the right choice for the part. She plays the part the way it should be: she does it realistic.
I can't imagine anyone else playing the part after seeying this movie.

Another thing that really impressed me with this Godfather episode, is that it all gets carried to a higher level considering emotion. This is the most emotional episode in the trilogy. And the end of the movie, is so emotionally beautiful, that it will stay in your mind for a long time.

So with great acting, beautiful sets, great music, perfect suspence and high emotion: this is a wonderfull conclusion of a legendary movie franchise.

447223,3,6302158176,"The Godfather III has been one of the most maligned movies in recent times.  The truth is the movie is not that bad.  In the first two movies, as Michael Corleone descends into his pitiful existence, the audience sees Michael suffer for his terrible sins only once, when Kay aborts her child.  However, we never see the guilt, remorse and sorrow that Michael exhibits in Godfather III.  One of the criticisms leveled at this movie is that Michael does not die a violent death at the hands of his enemies.  He suffers a far worse fate, as he sees his daughter die before his eyes.  In the director's commentary for the disc, Coppola says that `there is not a worse way to pay for your sins then to see your children suffer.'  In this way, the movie acts sort of as a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Sofia took the critics relentless assaults against her acting.  As for Michael, we see him at the end of the original movie as triumphant, but at the end of Godfather II, we see him victorious but it has cost him  his family.  At the end of the third part, he is broken, beaten and destroyed.  He did confess his sins, but still orders murders, and his ultimate punishment is to see his daughter die.  Coppola has not betrayed the cinematic integrity of the first two films, but just elevated the punishment that Michael must face.  In the first two movies, we are left wondering whether Michael has felt remorse for the life that he has led.  At the end of Godfather III, as he screams on the concert hall steps, we finally see the remorse and glimpse the human being that he once was, instead of the old, crippled mafia chieftan that he became.",1130803200,5,1641,4.444816053511706
447224,2,6302158176,"On its own, ""The Godfather Part III"" is actually a pretty good movie. However, in comparion to its two predecessors, I'm sorry but the film just doesn't hold its ground. Coppola and Puzzo were running out of ideas, and the cast members, both returning and new, basically phoned in their performances.

The main problems with the film are script and casting. First of all, the plot is filled with more holes than Sonny Corleone's body when he got shot at the toll booth. Several new characters are introduced to the story, many of them with little to no origins that just pop out of nowhere. There is some weird plot against the Vatican that may have looked good on paper but just didn't transfer well onto the screen. Then, there's the cast. Pacino and Andy Garcia were great, but for the most part, the cast sleepwalked through their performances, including Diane Keaton and Talia Shire. Eli Wallach and Joe Mantegna were welcome additions to the cast but they too couldn't muster up decent performances. Whose idea was it to replace Robert Duvall with George Hamilton? What was Bridget Fonda doing there again? And then there's Sofia Coppola - look, Francis, we all know you love your daughter, but if you really loved her, you wouldn't go exploiting her lack of acting talent like you did with this film.

The film is not a complete waste, however. The scenes from Sicily, for exmple, are brilliantly written and breathtakingly filmed. As an Italian, I can honestly say this is the best footage of the Sicillian landscape ever to be put on film. The usual death montage at the end of the film was cool to watch, and the Atlantic City Massacre sequence was incredibly well done.

Overall, get this film only if you want to own the complete trilogy on dvd. Otherwise, just catch it on tv.",1127520000,6,1789,4.673015873015873

I thought Sofia Coppola was excellent in the role she was so maligned for, the role of Michael Corleone's daughter.  She was utterly believable, and she wasn't the annoyingly picture perfect beauty queen that is usually seen in movies.  Thanks for giving us a real person for a change.  She looks great.

The best thing about the Godfather series is the acting of Marlon Brando.  His Don Vito Corleone is his finest work in a distinguished career, and it wins my award for best acting performance of all time by anyone.  Without him, how can you compare Godfather Part 3 to the others?  It's like taking Babe Ruth off the 1927 Yankees and then expecting them to be as good.

We have kind of had enough of those mass killings of mobsters.  It's been done before, no?

Anyway, in much of the movie I really enjoyed the acting and the development of the story, and in other parts I felt my interest wane, until it picked up again.

She got toasted when this movie came out, and I thought it was really unfair.

I'd also read that Paramount was too cheap to pay Robert Duvall to return as Tom Hagen, which is very unfortunate since the first two GODFATHER movies really didn't leave a lot of characters that could come back.

Francis Coppola also said in an interview that Paramount approached him to write and direct GODFATHER III.  He asked for six months to write the script.  Paramount gave him six weeks.  That, in a nutshell, is the problem with the film: it plays like a rough draft.

And considering its cinematic lineage, that's really the ultimate shame: Coppola should've been the one to give them the deal they couldn't refuse.

People who give this movie one star are, quite frankly, imnbeciles - it's no Casablanca, nor is it a Gigli, either. It is not that bad as to be ranked a one star review - it should be judged independent of its predecessors, not against its predecessors.

The Godfather Part III is a movie about the redemption of Michael Corleone and his grooming of his nephew, Vincent Santorini (played wonderfully by Andy Garcia), to become the next Don of the Corleone family.  The movie is written very well, and does not move slow or tediously, as another reviewer stated.  This movie had me shaking with anticipation and excitement, especially at the  opera scene.

Many people have pointed out Sofia Coppola's amateur acting as a main detractor for this movie. I came into this movie ready to be disappointed with subpar acting, but was pleasantly suprised with the fine acting. Granted, Sofia Coppola's acting in certain scenes (such as her discussion with Michael during breakfast about being a front for the Foundation) to be very grimace-worthing, but, IMHO, she did quite a decent job acting. Andy Garcia, while not up to James Caan's acting in the original Godfather(who could match him, though?) performs superb as Santino's son, and he is convincing enough to make the viewer believe he is, in fact, the son of Sonny Corleone.  Al Pacino, regardless to say, is phenomenal as Michael Corleone, and provides some of the most moving moments in the whole trilogy here.

With The Godfather Part III,  Francis Coppola ties many loose ends together, and satisfies the viewer with a very good conclusion to one of the greatest film stories in cinema. The similarities between the death of Vito Corleone and the end of this movie are striking, further tying the movies together.  The harshness some people show towards this film is unwarranted-they are disappointed because it is not like any of its predecessors.

Add to this his daughter (horrible actress playing her part), his son (what a puss), and his ex-wife trotting around (give me a break) Italy with him and you have a real loser on your hands.

This movie has nothing of the magic that made the first 2 so great. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it. The first two Godfather movies suffice.

447231,3,6302158176,"Why? This is the question that many people asked themselves before and after seeing Francis Ford Coppola's third (and hopefully last) installment of The Godfather saga. The first two parts were such perfect meditations on violence and the absolute corrupting effect of money and power on an individual. The way Part II ended was a darkly poetic conclusion that nothing else really needed to be said.

Apparently, Coppola thought otherwise and went back to the well one more time with Part III. The problem is that he waited too long. Too many years had passed and he had changed as a filmmaker. Almost going mad making Apocalypse Now and the commercial and critical failure of The Cotton Club had taken its toll on the man. Hollywood had changed and this is reflected in the movie. First and foremost is the casting: Andy Garcia? Bridget Fonda? George Hamilton?! They are fine actors in their own right but are they really acceptable substitutes for the likes of James Caan, John Cazale and Robert Duvall? Granted the first two played characters that died in Parts I and II but the miscasting of these actors speaks volumes of what is wrong with so many movies coming out of Hollywood these days. Actors are cast for their marquee value and not because they are necessarily right for the role.

The Godfather Part III has the feeling of a paycheck movie because it lacks the passion of the first two parts. In the `90s, Coppola's generation of Movie Brats had fallen on hard times. Brian De Palma and William Friedkin had become hired guns with erratic track records. Steven Spielberg had become absorbed by the Hollywood system and Martin Scorsese remade Cape Fear. The Godfather Part III was Coppola's attempt to regain box office clout within Hollywood but instead he was crucified by critics for his troubles.",1118620800,2,1813,4.826366559485531

For years Francis Ford Coppola resisted efforts to recruit him to make another ""Godfather"" film.  When he did make one it was on the condition that Michael Corleone dies, the only logical conclusion in continuing this story.  The knives were out for the casting of his daughter Sofia in the central role of Mary Corleone.  Now I'm not saying that Sofia is a credible actress but her deficiencies, I felt, were covered up by the more accomplished actors in the cast.  I'm more outraged that people think she is an accomplished director-screenwriter on the basis of the woeful ""Lost in Translation"".  Yes, there are many ridiculous elements to the film, a ludicrous Vatican bank scandal subplot and Talia Shire's scenery-chewing account of Connie Corleone.  That said the positives here outnumber the negatives.  First off, Al Pacino's account of Michael Corleone in the twilight of his life is flawless.  You can see in his face the realization that he's deluded himself that the family business that he headed was a noble enterprise despite his efforts to legitimize it in the eyes of acceptable society.  I also thought there was some discernable chemistry in the scenes he shared with Diane Keaton as Kay.  It's kind of ironic that Pacino wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his work here;instead he was nominated for his role as Big Boy Caprice in ""Dick Tracy"".  Andy Garcia is magnetic as Vincent, Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son.  Joe Mantegna gives a colorful account of Joey Zaza, a John Gotti type.  Look for Catherine Scorsese(Marty's mother) in a small role here.  Not to be missed is Coppola's commentary where he vociferously defends the choices he made for this film, in particular his casting of his own daughter.  He sounds like an overly protective daddy protecting his baby girl from the knives and daggers directed against her.",1115510400,4,1960,5.021671826625387
447273,2,6302158176,"Overall, this movie could not have been worse. It was long, strung out and only needed to be about half as long as it was.

  The casting in this movie is terrible. Andy Garcia trying to play some goofy impression of James Caan (Sonny) was embarrasing at best. Sofia Coppola was simply a terrible choice, her mouth moves in stranger ways than Renee Zellweiger, and she ruins every scene she's in. Pacino essentially never gets into character, he just mumbles through his scenes. Joe Mantenga was an awful choice who brings nothing to the film but a weird, effeminate Italian stereotype. Worst part of the movie? ""Connie okays a hit"" Excuse me, but CONNIE okyaying a HIT? Oh, Michael, you have fallen from grace. The abusive nature of Italians toward women is a common theme in Puzo's work and this would never have happened. What's next - Mama Corleone and mary start their own family like clemenza and Tessio?

  This was a sad excuse for a Godfather movie - if they couldn't do it right, they shouldn't have done it at all - notice how EVERY actor is related to Francis Coppola? Pathetic!",1113782400,5,1090,4.6217616580310885
447274,3,6302158176,"I have seen this film several times, all the way through or in parts. Frankly, I have mixed emotions about it because, when discussing it, I want to be fair and focus on it as a discrete film, judging it on its own terms; however, for me at least, that is impossible because it is the third of three Godfather films and its two predecessors are masterpieces. I cannot exclude vivid memories of scenes and even comments from films I first saw 18 and then 14 years before seeing this one for the first time in 1990. OK, that's my challenge. I finally decided to try to rate it on its own terms, hence the Three Stars. What it has going for it includes Pacino's talent, several plausible conflicts, brilliant cinematography, and a tone of melancholy which is consistent throughout the narrative. After years of broken promises to wife Kay (Diane Keaton), Michael has almost completed a process by which to extricate himself and his family from organized crime. However, his marriage has ended, mortal enemies remain such as Altobello (Eli Wallach) and Joey Zaza (Joe Montegna), his negotiations with the Vatican encounter unexpected complications, and finally, his physical health is poor as pressures and tensions in his life intensify. It is no wonder that he suffers a diabetic attack in his kitchen (""Just when I think I'm out...."") from which he never fully recovers.

However, the film has several problems. One concerns the lack of a primary plot to give the narrative cohesion. There are hundreds of individual episodes in The Godfather and Godfather Part II (as in other films such as Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago) but they are coordinated effectively. Not so of the episodes in this film. Sofia Coppola's performance as Mary Corleone has been savaged by most critics. In fact, she is reputed to be a late replacement for Wynona Rider, had no prior acting experience in films, and was given a role as trivial as Anne Archer's in the three Jack Ryan films. I will not join others in bashing her. Another of the film's flaws is director Coppola and the three screenwriters' failure to do more with the role of Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia). So many missed opportunities as Garcia's great talents are under-utilized, especially when on-screen with his obviously exhausted Uncle Michael. The illegitimate son of Santino (""Sonny"") Corleone, Vincent is only occasionally allowed to show some of his father's passion, providing energy which this film desperately needs and otherwise lacks.

The jumpy plot and underdeveloped characters are, in my opinion, this film's major weakness but it has several fine moments as when Vincent challenges Zaza, when Michael meets with Cardinal Lamberto (Raf Vallone), the deadly sequence as the performance in the opera house proceeds to its conclusion, and the final scene when Michael reflects upon his empty life. Judged only on its own terms, Three Stars. Let's all hope that there will be no Part IV.",1113523200,93,2950,4.945564516129032
447275,3,6302158176,"okay! let me start with the earlier one's. the godfather 1 & 2 are among the top 5 movies i have ever seen. al pacino was born for the role of michael corleone. the way novel is written if there is any one movie that has surpassed the book in terms of that ""effect"" then it has to be ""the godfather"". if you haven't seen the movie then i must say you are really missing an experience which cannot be explained in words.

Now for the review. godfather 3... the script was a bit awry, which could have been better. the idea was right. michael hell bent on legitimising the family, vincent taking over the family business, mary falling in love with her cousin,the vatican conspiracy,a new italian don backing joey zasa & the best part of the movie... michael confessing his sins to the cardinal.

the implementation of 1/3rd of the movie was totally waste. it could have been the best like the rest had they worked on the intricacies more deeply. by that i mean editing, screenplay & script. obviously the clear drawback of the movie was the absence of Tom Hagen. Robert Duvall was one of the strong points in the earlier two movies, his absence was clearly felt & missed. His presence could have single handedly made the difference in saving the movie.

then comes the worst part... casting of sofia coppola in place of wynnona ryder (she was supposed to play mary but supposedly fell sick). she was a complete amateur in her acting skills. could never match the aura of great actors like paccino, diane keaton & andy garcia. a sheer waste of a character that was made an essential part of the script. this was the single biggest mistake in the movie.

i loved the end of the movie. i think al paccino gave one of the best performances of the whole trilogy in that end part.

watch the movie for the agony faced by michael. the murder of his brother, the betrayal to his wife, his cold loneliness, a justified end to the trilogy & obviously the best reason...

Anyone who is a true Godfather fan has to give III some applause for the ending...Al Pacino was sooo good in the one, especially the last scene :)..totally oscar worthy...however his Italian dubbing was really crappy and they could have done a better job disregarding the fact he doesnt know any..

447280,4,6302158176,"It took multiple viewings before I was able to understand every nuance but once I figured out all aspects of this complicated Mafia story, I thought it was a wonderful conclusion to the trilogy that suffered from a confusing script. Too much time was given to the bizarre first-cousin romance, and not enough to the treachery of the Corporate-Mafia-Vatican conflict. It is the type of story where you cannot miss a single line of dialogue, so I recommend watching with English subtitles. It helps to clarify exactly what is happening.

The plot centers around Michael's plan to cleanse his image through a business relationship with the Vatican Bank. This was an intriguing and meticulously detailed aspect of the story that unfortunately did not receive the attention it needed. The high-stakes multimillion-dollar Immobiliare business deal, run amuck with secret alliances, swindles and backstabbing, beats those of the shabby dime-chasing Sopranos any day. As I stated earlier, it took multiple viewings to understand every detail but I'll do my best to sort them out now:

Michael offers to buy the Vatican's stake in Immobiliare for $500 million, but Archbishop Gilday ups the price to $600 million. Michael plans for it to be a legitimate company, free of crooked Mafia influence. Michael does not suspect he is getting into one of the most crooked deals of his life. The company's board of directors, notably Don Lucchesi, refuses to ratify the transfer of ownership - AFTER Michael has paid the $600 mil. This is all part of a conspiracy to swindle Michael out of his money, with the three architects being Gilday, Lucchesi, and Mary Corleone's Godfather, Don Altobello (portrayed perfectly by the wonderful Eli Wallach). These three are all loyal to the Italian Mafia, which fears the American Mafia will be moving onto their turf with Corleone's purchase of Immobiliare.

Don Altobello, acting as if he's Michael's best friend, tells him the other American Dons are upset that Immobiliare will not include them, and that he must pay tribute. Michael tells him to organize a meeting...It is never apparent in the movie that Altobello, Lucchesi and Gilday orchestrated the helicopter attack as an attempt to wipe out the American Mafia leadership and increase their own power. Joey Zasa is their pawn. They back Zasa, planning for him to take over New York after the other Dons are dead (notice how Zasa leaves the meeting and Altobello quickly follows him out, seconds before the attack begins). Unfortunately for them, Michael survives, and like Godfather II, is faced with another who-done-it?

I felt this was brilliant - classic Mario Puzo. But too many subplots distract us from this storyline.

After a meeting with his old friend, Don Tommasino, Michael learns he has been swindled by Lucchesi and the Vatican Bank, who are already conspiring with Don Altobello to finish what they started and assassinate him. Thus, we are positioned for the finale and showdown during the opera scene.

The film has its classic moments: the shooting of Joey Zasa during the street parade lives up to any of the trilogy's memorable executions. Michael's confession to Cardinal Lamberto, the failed attempt on Vincent Mancini, the transfer of power to Vincent 'Corleone' and Michael's final scream are a few standout moments.

The movie is what it is. It is not fair to degrade the movie because of the absence of Tom Hagen. We have to accept that the character died between films. Nor does the portrayal of Mary Corleone suffer under the performance of the director's daughter. The Godfather films have always been a family affair and I feel Sofia Coppola does an adequate job in her role and is only a small weakness to a great story. Of course the rest of the cast is terrific, especially Pacino and Garcia, the latter of which was born into this he role as Sonny's boy. My favorite line for Vincent: ""Do I look like a guy who's going to lose?""

The Godfather Part III is a great movie that cowers in the shadow of its predecessors, and suffers from a confusing script, but overall is a fitting conclusion to the tale of our favorite movie family.

447281,5,6302158176,"I have decided to cover both the pros and cons of this film

First off; Too many horrible reviews. I undestand the true fan's dissapointment, and if you are a true fan of ingeniously made films, you will not be dissapointed that much, if at all. Believe me I know what I am talkin about...

Part III, cannot fully measure to Parts I & II but it does come very close. The acting, on Pacino's part is excellent, as well as that of all the other actors.

Pacinos character performs a tremendous turn, to an aged man who repents his sinister life (Fredo...) and does his most to go legitimate, although the firery passion of the once notorious Michael Corleone often leaps out in him.

Andy Garcia, is a wonderful cast member. If we remember Sonny's affair (Part I) with his young mistress, Vincent (Garcia) is his illegitimate son, born apparently after Sonny's death. Garcia plays a foolish Hooligan in the beggining, but then guided by Michael(Pacino) ripens. His performance is unmistakeable and felt.

The film also includes real history in its plot, and sugarcoats it very well. This is of course the assassination of Pope John Paul I, whos death was a controversy.

Best Scene: The Ending cannot be mistaken for any others. The Great Masteful ending of Part's I & II left the viewer thirsting for more and the notion that they both were to be continued. However Part III not only shows that the story continues, but that also the saga ends. It accomplishes both!!! There cannot be a Part IV because of this ending.

To give you a hint without giving away the plot, recall Brando in Part I and then subsitute his character with Pacino's.

Without any overrating, Pacino's performance in the final scene was something that is present only in the best of the greatest films of all time.

And of course, it follows the classic Godfather pattern. Like all of them, it starts out at a celebration, there is the conflict in the middle which offers all the different questionable deaths, be it bussiness or vendettas, and the resolution is like in the first two, resolved in a blood(do not take literally or overread into it) bath.

Problems (minor):

1)Robert Duvall, is not present, without him we have only one legendary actor in the film.

2)Casting: Sofia Coppola: not the best choice in the role of Mary. However not catastrophic, although questionable.

3)Editing: every movie has its glitches, howevever you must be very, and I stress ""very"" perceptive to catch the few and minor(let alone debatable) editing errors in the story's timeline.

Finally, thank you for taking the time to read this, and on a final note, watch it with an open mind. Hopefully (it hasn't been a while since you've watched the other two, in which case I recommend you do first, since many of the characters, even those of the most minor importance show up throughout this one, to give it that ""real life"" touch.",1099526400,14,2890,4.708333333333333
447302,5,6302158176,"Many things happened from the Godfather II for this third part . The expressive force of Coppola seemed having lost .

In the other hand two generations of viewers passed. And the new issues in the market were in that moment object of major attention .

Add it also the absence of that incredible cast in the first and second part. Andy Garca is a solvent actor but his presence was not enough to fill the several holes.

Somehow the recrudescence of the I.R.A. in the eighties deviated the attention and the interest in this sense around the world Check for instance the most important british films in that decade and verify by yourself .

 You can feel the dramatic influence of some previous films of the eighties such as Once upon a time in America, The long good Friday , and specially  The untouchables whose dramatic resources taken directly from the opera resulted little convincing for a viewer involved and accustomed to new approach of young directors such Jim Sheridan , Neil Jourdan , and the recognized  Scorsese with Goodfellas , Cohen brothers (Millers crossing and Blood simple) matched casually this same year 1990 .

The Ambrosian Bank scandal and the strange death of The Pope in 1978 were too far in the memory . The final result was a watchable movie but without that dark poetry, unbeatable trademark of the two previous works of the saga of the Corleone family. Add plus, the serious troubles with the author respect to several issues .

Undoubtly there are arresting moments at the ending sequences , but there are too much concessions to the public . You can notice the urgent necessity of Coppola for explain the complex web inscribed in the script , but the lack of this justified resource in his previous I and II was precisely one of its major virtues : decipher the hidden codes in the story .",1097539200,,1825,4.642857142857143

Part III does have lots of admirable qualities, the vistas of Sicily are wonderful and the plot concerning the Vatican is semi-engaging. However, the bad parts to the film ultimately outweigh the good and I can't say that I would recommend Part III to others for viewing. Yes, the ending of Part III was tragic and powerful. But, the ending to Part II was cinematic masterpiece. I like to think of the Godfather Part III not as a continuation of the series but rather as a footnote that I can easily ignore in light of Part I and Part II's brilliance.",1095465600,,845,4.458064516129032
447305,3,6302158176,"After giving us with GF1 and GF2 2 of the greatest films American cinema has yet produced, Francis Ford Coppola unfortunately gave in to the temptation to create a trilogy.  He should have quit while he was ahead. Cinematographically, GF3 is stunning, the acting almost uniformly superb.  But while watching it for the first time in theatrical release I was astounded at its endless succession of ripped-off images.  This convinced me that Coppola had run out of ideas.  Another of these reviews rightly points out that Coppola skilfully blended fact and fiction by adapting the Vatican Bank scandal for GF3 but even this is, in the last analysis, an act of borrowing of the kind that typifies the film.

Additional Example 1:  the street scene in which Joey Zaza is killed. The assasin is disguised as a mounted police officer & as he fires says, ""Take that, Zaza.""  Remember Zsa Zsa Gabor's trial for slapping a police officer?

Additional Example 2: The much lauded shot of Pacino, as Michael Corleone, on the opera house steps as he realizes his daughter is dead.  It seems horrific--until you realize it's merely one of the 20th century's most iconic image: Edvard Munch's ""The Scream.""

Additional Example 3: Pacino dying and falling off his chair in the film's final shot.  Pure Rowan and Martin's ""Laugh-in"" with Artie Johnson's dirty old man putting the moves on Ruth Buzzi's frump & falling off the park bench after she hits him with her purse.  Unfortunately, Buzzi doesn't appear in GF3.

Additional Example 4: the ascending spiral of murders counterpointed against a performance of ""Cavalleria Rusticana.""  Here Coppola rips off his own GF1, specifically the baptism sequence in which Corleone rivals are violently killed while Michael stands godfather to his sister's son.  In both cases, the sordidly violent is juxtaposed with the sublime.  Effective, but inevitably less so in its repetitiveness in GF3 than it was in GF1, where it was new and had tremendous impact (arguably among the most striking sequences in film history---right up there with that baby buggy in ""Battleship Potemkin"").

Unfortunately Coppola further weakens the final moments by having Talia Shire repeat a gesture taken from the opera stage just minutes before--she raises her scarf over her head in a traditional Sicilian sign of mourning.  A tad trite, though it is a reminder that for all Michael's yearning for respectability, the Corleones always remained a Sicilian village clan.

As to the casting, Coppola erred grievously by not offering Robert Duvall a salary equal to Pacino's, who according to Duvall was to get 3 times what Duvall was offered.  It hurts to imagine what Duvall could have done for this film.  It is equally painful to recall Sofia Coppola's presence in the film, which cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be called a performance.  So Coppola couldn't land the actress he wanted for the part; there were lots of other highly competent young ladies out there. Yet he insisted on using his woefully inexperienced daughter.  Go figure.  Ms Coppola has landed on her feet as a director, but here's hoping she has the sense never again to step in front of a camera.",1095033600,3,3185,4.977315689981096
447306,5,6302158176,"Sixteen years after 1974's ""The Godfather Part II"" which is a prequel and a sequel to the original one, 1990's ""The Godfather Part III"" is a very dark and very emotional farewell to the Coppola's legendary trilogy.

 Set in the late 1970s the effects of the passing years are beginning to weaken Michael Corleone as he continues to be the head of the Corleone crime estate but now with the atrocities he's committed over the years starting in 1946 onwards, Corleone aims to try to legitimize his family business dealings while trying to redeem himself for his past sins in order to have peace with himself. However his attempts to remove himself from the violent underworld are undermined by power hungry proteges from younger gangsters aiming to take over the family business.

 This finale in the Godfather Trilogy is the darkest and the most emotional of the three. I don't understand the negative reviews that I read on this movie. This is a fitting conclusion to the saga of Don Michael Corleone. The ending is quite depressing and the movie is dark as MIchael Corleone is experiencing the effects of advancing age.

 The acting, like in it's two predecessors, is really well-done once again. While Al Pacino is by far the driving force of the entire movie series besides the late Marlon Brando from Part I, others in this cast are also really great as well. My favorite was Diane Keaton playing Michael estranged wife Kay Corleone as she sorts out her love yet acrimonious relationship with Michael as he suffers from increasingly ill health.

 While not quite on the scale of it's predecessors ""The Godfather Part III"" is a really powerful and fulfilling conclusion to the Godfather trilogy and it is highly recommended when buying the ""DVD collection"".",1094688000,4,1760,4.862876254180602

Although the plot gets somewhat byzantine near the end and Al Pacino's ""silent scream"" should have been edited out, I thought the movie held up well with the first two and was a respectable third sequel to the first and second movies. Imagine my surprise when I read the critics and learn that I'm supposed to hate this awful movie, that Sofia Coppola cannot act and that Andy Garcia does an awful job as well, blah, blah, blah. I suspect that if Mr. Coppola had not directed I and II-- is he a victim of his success?-- that the critics would have given him rave reviews. Instead of comparing this one up to the first two, why don't we look at the other movies released (1990?) that year and see how this one measures up to them. The criticism of Ms. Coppola is ill-founded. She is quite good as Michael Corleone's child Mary. The daughter in THE SOPRANOS bears a striking resemblance to her and surely is modeled in part on her. Mr. Garcia is a terrific actor and  brings new meaning to the phrase, handsome Italian men. Diane Keaton is superb here as Michael Corleone's ex-wife who never stopped loving him, at least on some level. Finally Al Pacino gives a heartbreaking performance as the aging head of the Corleone family who struggles unsuccessfully to die a respectable man.

All the elements from the first two productions are here, the wonderful crowd scenes, the interweaving of criminal acts with religious services, the juxtaposition of the most heinous acts on earth with holy observances. (Here the poison goes all the way to the Vatican.) On the other hand, both of the Corleone children break the cycle of murder and violence: Mary manages her father's charitable organization and Tony makes his operatic debut in Sicily in quite a grand section of the movie.

She was a sweet, kind girl and that was how the character was portrayed. And the love story between Mary and Vincent I thought was so beautiful (even though there was the whole incest plot and the supposed age difference. Can you spell statutory rape?). It made me cry.

447311,3,6302158176,"Godfather 3 was a movie saved by one person, Al Pacino. His powerful acting in the first two Godfather films was without a doubt visable in the third. But this movie was destroyed by horrible acting. Andy Garcia portrays Micheal's (Al Pacino) nephew from his dead brother, Sonny. Andy plays Vinnie, a youthful hoodlum looking for power and respect. This movie got Andy Garcia famous, even though it was obvious he was just trying to copy Marlon Brando and Al Pacino's prefomance's in the last two Godfathers, and he did a horrible job and tore down the legacy of Godfather with every scene he was in.
But it wasn't just Andy Gracia who tore apart this movie, oh no. He had some help. Sofia Coppola plays Mary Corleone, Micheal's daughter. You could tell she had no idea what was going on. It was like Francis Ford, the director, just told her to say random things without even giving her a script. Marlon Brando, may he now rest in peace, was probably disgusted with this movie before he died.
To make this movie even worse, they decided to have a dramactic ending scene with Mary shot by a some random person sent to kill Micheal. This scene ends with Al Pacino screaming his lungs out, and the whole time I was sitting there saying, ""That guy did you a favor by killing off that unholy death angle sent from the deep dark bowels of heck."" The final scene, was indeed, a sad one, but with the acting skills in this movie, I don't blame Micheal for dying. I do have to admit, there are no words to describe the death scene of Micheal Corleone, because that marked the end of the Godfater lagacy, hopefully, forever. But don't get me wrong, I still love the Godfather trilogy, and always will. It just needs to end, here and now.

I agree that the casting of Sofia Coppola was not very good.  She seemed lost in the role as Don Michael's daughter.  However, I enjoyed Andy Garcia portrayal as the heir apparent of the Corleone family.  Al Pacino is great once again in the role Michael.  I also enjoyed Coppola's direction and Gordon Willis' cinematography.  This version is in a class by itself.  A very good film.",1088899200,,512,4.674157303370786
447332,4,6302158176,"I will admit that this is a film that is plagued with poor decision-making by its creators. I don't know who decided to give an actress as horrible as Sofia Coppola the part of Mary Corleone, but someone really screwed up there. It's true that this film lacks the care that was crafted in the other two, particularly the first one. However, there is a somewhat Shakespearean feel to it (and I apologize, since everyone seems to think they know so much about Shakespeare these days). This wasn't an unneccesary installment as much as it was sloppy. Pretty much every event in this film wasn't needed; Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo certainly needed to spend a few more months on the screenplay.
Despite its glaring flaws, I can't help but feel that people are too hard on this concluding installment. The acting is terrific (although Sofia Coppola is simply a pain in the loins), the scenery is great, and there were enough plot twists to keep me interested. This is worth your time, without a doubt.

447333,2,6302158176,"I'm sure many moviegoers share my opinion that the first two films in this series are among the best American movies ever made. I'm equally sure that fans of the first two share my disappointment in the quality of the final part of the trilogy.
There are many significant problems with this movie. The most serious is the dialogue. I think the problem is this: in Parts I and II, many of the characters - Vito Corleone, Salvatore Tessio, Peter Clemenza, Hyman Roth, Frank Pentangelli, and Johnny Ola - were born in the 19th or early 20th century. So when they spoke in the pseudo poetic/operatic jargon of the first two screenplays, it made sense because they were from another era. But when Joe Mantegna, who is supposed to be playing John Gotti, expresses his anger by saying, ""I say, on this day, I have been shown NO respect,"" it strikes a false note. An angry Gotti wouldn't have talked that way; he'd have probably just cursed at everybody in the room. While we're on the subject of the meeting in Atlantic City, the ""hit"" with the helicopter is too ""public"" and ""noisy"" to be a mob hit. A stunt like that in real life would cause such a public outcry, it would result in Congressional hearings on mob activity. By the way, how did Vincent know it was a hit before everyone else in the room did?
How did Connie Corleone evolve from a sheltered, spoiled newlywed in Part I, to an international floozy who resented Michael in Part II, to Michael's most ardent ally in Part III, even ordering ""hits"" on people? And how was she able to figure out that Michael killed her husband in Part I, yet remain ignorant that he killed Fredo in Part II? Her metamorphosis is another false note.
I thought the point at the end of Part II was Michael's isolation from and alienation of everyone who cared for him. So, why in Part III does everyone treat him like a ""great guy?"" The man killed his own brother, for God's sake. Can't anyone in Part III figure that out?
I could be wrong, but I think some of the key plot elements in the two masterpieces (Michael's hit on the other four Mafia dons in Part I, the mob's attempt to control Cuba in Part II), while based on real life events, were not common knowledge to the movie-going public, at least not to me. (Note: I was 14 years old in 1972). I learned some things I didn't know by watching the first two, and felt I never knew what would happen next. However, it's pretty much common knowledge that the Vatican and the Mafia did some business together. So, a major plot point of Part III, rather than teach me something, ultimately bored me.
I've saved the most obvious flaw for last: Sofia Coppola's performance as Michael's daughter. It's not that she's a bad actress; it's that she's NOT an actress (or much of a screenwriter either; e.g. Lost in Translation). Further, Vincent is supposed to be so drawn to her that he risks Michael's wrath by pursuing a romantic relationship with his own cousin. Call me shallow, but I think his attraction to her would have been more understandable had Mary been too beautiful to resist. No offense, Sofia, but you ain't it. Of course, I'm not exactly Denzel Washington myself - he's taller and has more money.",1080000000,2,3193,4.506896551724138
447334,4,6302158176,"Frankly, I cannot understand those who find Part III sub-par. It is a good all around movie, with a fresh new modern type of filming. Even worse is that Mary Corleone (Sofia Coppola) takes a beating for what I thought was a charming role. It's true the plot could have done without the incest, but that couldn't explain the venom in which other Godfather enthusiasts view it. Overall, it's a slower paced Godfather, but not by much. In fact, there seems to be as many mob hits and drive-by's as any other, including a surprising helicopter strafing scene.  The character Vincent also makes up for any loss in energy presented by an aging Michael Corleone. He comes through in a genuine Sonny attitude which centers around killing anyone you dislike in a fit of rage.

Aside from errors and ommissions written about in other reviews, one problem I had with this movie is: Who are all these people at the party?  If they are cousins, etc., whose offspring are they? I recognized Sonny's twin daughters, Sandra Hayden, Connie, Michael and Enzo the baker. It seems that Copolla underestimated the fan's knowledge of the two previous stories and takes liberties here by randomly tossing in 20 or 30 relatives that come from god only knows where. It would appear unanimous that Sofia was a poor choice, considering there were actresses available to play the role. I'm thankful however that I didn't have to sit through this movie watching Winnona Ryder, who was originally cast in the role. At least Sofia is Italian.  Another beef I have is with the Sicilian murder plot, whereby Vincent and Connie hire two Chip N' Dale dancers to be Michael's bodyguards. Get real here, Francis. It's a bit hard to swallow that these silent strong men rent themselves out for operas and vendettas. And just when I thought it couldn't get any worse...why, I asked myself,  didn't Copolla just end the movie with Michael's heart wrenching cry on the stairs of the opera house. A monumental moment for Pacino, to which I say bravo! One of the finest moments in the film and worth enduring the rest of the film to see.

Why?
Andy Garcia - Nobody could possibly be a more obnoxious character than his. Not sure if it was scripted that way, or if his interpretation skills are completely absent.
Soffia Coppola - Cannot act
Andy Garcia & Soffia Coppola's characters having an incestuous relationship.
A top clergyman of the Catholic Church gets whacked by the Corleones. What?
George Hamilton replacing Robert Duval. ""Mr. Tan"" instead of Mr. Duval? Terrible decision based on $$$ (they would not give Duval the money he requested).
Michael Corleone reconciles with his ex wife Kay? Sorry, but no Mafia Don would take back the wife that aborted his (male) child. Yeah, a mafioso can mellow with age, start thinking like a liberal, and be understanding of that act. Why would she take a murderer back either (he's not exactly a prize...)?? Mind boggling

Writing was awful.

447338,4,6302158176,"All right, if you want to compare this movie to the first 2, it comes up short. Godfather 1 had originality and masterful storytelling. In Godfather 2, the storytelling is perhaps even better. Godfather 3's biggest problem is that it's very blatantly a sequel. Godfather 2 masterfully goes backward and forward in time, comparing and contrasting Michael and his father Vito and showing the obvious degeneration of the younger Corleone. And for all those people who want to slam Mr. Coppola for casting his daughter - come on, he's made some of the greatest film masterpieces of all time...I think he knows what he's doing. Perhaps what makes this, in my opinion, as good as the first 2 is Al Pacino's performance. If anyone had any doubts about Pacino being one of the greatest of our time, those critics were answered. He was absolutely fabulous. All the other actors returning from the previous films were excellent in their character transformations. Sure, Andy Garcia wasn't outstanding in this movie, but his striking resemblance to James Caan helped, and he seemed to get better as the film went on. My only real complaint is Bridget Fonda. What the hell was she doing in this movie? She showed up at the beginning, played a small role in the development of Andy Garcia's character as a hot-head, but then disappears and is never heard from again. I think her character hurts more than helps the character of Sonny's son. He's portrayed as more of a James Bond type of character who woos the ladies (even his own cousin...whats wrong with this guy? incest is best?) or a precurser to Tony Soprano. All in all a very good film. Without Pacino, however it is forgettable. He carries this movie and makes it work as well as it does. While it's not everyone's favorite, it has a lot of competition and it's definitely worth watching if only for Pacino's performace and the evolution of his character. As much as we want to knock Coppola's girl, she's pretty hot and pulled off her role pretty well. I don't think the incest story worked very well though. That would never happen in an italian family. I had an Italian girlfriend once. If her cousin made a move on her, you could be sure her father would have cut the kid's nuts off.",1056067200,2,2234,4.6725888324873095

Believe me here when I say I'm being objective.  After putting off watching this movie for so many years because I was afraid it could not approach the genius of the first two movies, I bit the bullet.  Unfortunately, my worst fears came true as I struggled to follow this movie.
I will refrain from taking shots at individual performers and stick with the movie.  It was agonizingly slow and hard to follow.  At times, I found myself struggling to keep up with all of the different characters, who came and went, and came again, etc.
I suppose that people should see this movie for the sake of ""closure"" but that's as far as I can go.  I'm still reeling from the disappointment.",1047254400,9,681,4.459677419354839
447360,4,6302158176,"""The Godfather, Part III"" suffers tremendously when compared with its two legendary predecessors.  It simply lacks the originality and sweeping, epic scope of those originals.  That being said, it's not nearly as bad a movie as some critics and reviewers would have you believe.  There are definite weak moments and performances in the film, most notably that of Sofia Coppola playing Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) daughter, Mary.  Her performance lacks the depth and power necessary to carry this kind of material.  Her's is the work of a novice actress, which she was.  Her scenes are not unwatchable and she's not truly terrible, but she's also not very good and parts of her performance are uncomfortable to watch.  Still, it is nice to see most of the same cast back together again with Michael, Connie, Kay, Al Neri, and even Johnny Fontane.

  What gives ""...Part III"" its hook is the quest of Michael Corleone to clean himself of the family business and seek redemption for his past sins.  After watching him become one of the most menacing cinematic characters ever in the previous two films, it's intriguing and somewhat sad to watch him struggle to make things right with the people he has hurt as he sees his life reaching its twilight.  His legacy has been one of greed and violence and now he wishes it to be one of kindness and benevolence.  Of course, once you're in the family, it's nearly impossible to leave.  An assassination attempt on his life after he had settled all accounts (with money instead of violence) with his fellow mafioso types graphically illustrates that point, and leads to his famous quote, ""Just when I thought that I was out they pull me back in.""  His hot-headed nephew, Vincent Mancini (Sonny's ... son, played superbly by Andy Garcia), further inflames the situation with his incessant need for revenge on behalf of Michael (and an illicit affair with Mary).  Still, Michael hopes he can overcome this setback and move on with his desire for a crime-free life.  He seeks to make the Corleone business enterprise totally legitimate by purchasing the international conglomerate, Immobiliare (sp?), the construction and development arm of the Vatican.  He also seeks to sever his ties with the violent aspect of the business by transferring the title, and all its trappings, of 'Godfather' to Vincent.

  The true crux of the story involves Michael's business dealings with corrupt Vatican officials over this deal, and secretive plot to murder Michael by opponents of the sale.  Much of this takes place among the backdrop of Old World Italy as Michael returns home to watch his son, Anthony, perform is his first opera.  Plus, Michael hopes to rekindle the romance with his ex-wife, Kay.  Michael is hopeful that decisions he is making will help make life safer for Mary and help woo Kay back, and, in the end, allow him to fully atone for all his sins.  In true ""Godfather"" style, though, Michael's journey is wrought with difficulty and despair that would rival some of Shakespeare's own tragedies.

  Pacino's performance manages to give Michael the most human dimension ever seen in him.  This is a fascinating direction to take and powers the film throughout much of the three hour running time.  However, there are still a number of flaws that undermine the film.  The absence of Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen is most glaring.  The similarly patterned character of B.J. Harrison (played by George Hamilton) is serviceable, but does not nearly carry the same presence that Hagen did.  In addition, it seems that the 16-year layoff between Part II and Part III caused the ideas to go stale for director Francis Ford Coppola.  He seems to have reused many of the elements of the earlier films, without recapturing their magic.  A notable example would be Johnny Fontane serenading Connie at the beginning of the film.  It's reminiscent of the scenes at the beginning of ""The Godfather"", but doesn't seem to carry nearly the same meaning.

  In truth, ""Godfather, Part III"" is a completist's movie.  It doesn't stand alone and it makes very little sense if you have not seen the earlier films.  It also does not compel repeated viewings the way the first two films do.  Still, it is a good movie and it is a fitting conclusion to the saga of Michael Corleone.",1043884800,6,4302,4.869146005509642

447364,3,6302158176,"""The Godfather, part III"" is like attending a high school reunion: same faces, but the mood and attitude are conspicuously different.  In this case, that's not a good thing.  In this lackluster sequel to ""The Godfather, part II"" we find the Corleone family twenty years later in 1979.  Michael is older, suffers from diabetes, and struggles to live down his past as a mafia thug.  He teams up with the Vatican to do charity work, but the ghosts of his background continue to haunt him.  Can Michael renew his life as a ""legit"" businessman?  Can he ever reconcile with Kay, the mother of his two kids?  The above sounds like an interesting premise, but ""the Godfather, part III,"" though not awful, lacks the magic and brilliance of its two predecessors.  First off, Franis Ford Coppola replaced the suave Robert Duvall for George Hamilton as the attorney Tom Hagen.  Secondly, he casts his own daughter, Sophia, as the role of Michael's daughter, Mary.  Sophia's performance isn't the disaster people say it is, but it still comes across as amateurish.  And, finally, the film is directed with all the passion of a filmmaker who's in it for the money.  That's because Coppola, reeling from a string of critical and commercial flops in the 1980s, needed a hit badly, so he returned to familiar territory and released this film, which certainly did not deserve a Best Picture Oscar nomination in 1990.  What works?  Well, Andy Garcia lights things up as the son of the hotheaded Sonny, and his character is just as tempermental.  It's also interesting to a degree to see Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire revive their respective roles.  Otherwise, the film isn't a bust, but it's a surprisingly average movie, with a few lines of dialogue that seem awkward as they are cringeworthy.

The film gives the impression of an entirely strange director finding the abandonned clothes of the first two films and putting them on himself - it really is like that, a peculiar, rather 'off' imitation of someone you know and love. Music, set pieces, themes, characters are all shamelessly rehashed from the first two parts - and honestly to what end? What more about Michael, his life and his family legacy do we learn that we didn't already know? No ending could more definitively convey the shattering of a man's life through his actions' impact on others close to him than the silent coda to Part II (to my mind without doubt one of the top 5 greatest American films), certainly not the overblown operatic hysteria we have here, nor the unintentionally almost comic re-hash of that original spine-tingling moment that ends this film. Copolla was clearly aiming at a certain 'operatic' look and feel in many aspects of the film, but the end results are so ham-fisted in places as to be close to laughable; a good example being poor Talia Shire's bizarre turn as a sort of black-clad Queen of the Night. Dialogue between the Mafiosi is so cliched and leaden in places as to be simply unbelievable any more. The 'borrowings' from the first two films are just too blatant and purposeless to be anything other than irritating; Eli Wallach's character (extraordinarily over-acted), the older father figure who is secretly trying to betray Michael, is a transparent re-hash of Hyman Roth; We have an assasination in the midst of the feast of St Genero and so on and so forth. The two strands of the film, Michael's attempt at legitimacy and redemption and the fact-based dubious shennanigans at the Vatican Bank never really gel either, in such contrast to Part II in which the themes of personal and institutional corruption were seamless. It's possible that there was a film to be made about Michael Corleone's later life - it's true that his torment at the end of Part II does leave the door open - but if there was, it needed a much more original approach than this overblown farago offers.",1025222400,8,2351,4.807407407407408

In Part III, Michael Corleone tries to get out of the mafia, which, if you watched the other movies in the series, you know he never truly wanted to be a part of anyway.  He resigns his coveted title of Godfather to his bastard nephew (the illegitimate son of dear, departed Sonny) and tries to stabilize his life.
But he never succeeds.  In fact, his life takes a tragic turn for the worse.  I won't tell you HOW, but trust me: you may need a box of Kleenex for the ending.  I thought this was a great conclusion to the violent life of a mobster.  The life Michael Corleone chose was a bloody, crime-ladden one, and he suffered the consequences.  I mean, think of it this way: you don't win the Nobel Peace Prize by blowing off the heads of your enemies. (Whoops. I forgot they gave Yassir Arafat a Peace Prize.)

447390,2,6302158176,"It goes without saying that ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather Part II"" are two of the greatest films ever produced.  It is the very power, majesty, and near-flawless production qualities of these two epics that render it all the more tragic that ""The Godfather Part III"" turned out so badly.
There's no sugarcoating the magnitude of the cinematic disaster that ""Part III"" represents.  Everyone knows how poorly the casting is, particularly the unfortunate last-minute insertion of Sofia Coppola into Winona Ryder's planned role as Michael Corleone's daughter Mary. Her wooden performance and awkward screen presence by themselves deal a near-fatal blow to the film's prospects for success.  Other casting blunders include the inclusion of the bland George Hamilton as a replacement for Robert Duvall as the Corleone legal adviser, and the use of Joe Mantagna to portray the supposedly dangerous gangster Joey Zasa.
Even with these problems, any ""Godfather"" sequel featuring such talented performers as Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire should at the very least prove decent.  That the film turns out so horribly reveals that the production problems extend to the plot concept, the writing, and the direction.  The main premise of the film, that an aging Michael Corleone wishes to legitimize himself and put his violent, corrupt past behind him is certainly plausible, as is the notion that a ""next generation"" of gangsters (i.e., Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son Vincent) might be waiting in the wings.  The resulting story, however, is muddled and unsatisfying. It is suggested that shadowy, murky kinds of corruption rattle the walls of the Vatican; we are introduced to entirely new and heretofore unknown underworld factions, which don't poke their nefarious way into the plot until midway through the film. Overall, the story is a kind of multilayered mess with countless loose ends, leaving viewers confused and with way too many ""Yeah, buts.""
Perhaps even worse than the tortuous story line is the film's presentation and pacing. Whereas first-rate dialogue, camera work, and editing caused the previous two ""Godfathers"" to sizzle from start to finish, this film exhibits a staid, plodding quality that by the last forty minutes or so has slowed to a veritable cinematic crawl. I swear that during the gratuitous scenes in Sicily in which Kay and Michael sit endlessly at a table reminiscing about the old days it's all I can do to keep from falling asleep.  Part of the problem, in fact, is that so much of the film feeds shamelessly off the energies generated by the previous two releases.  The endless recollection, reflection, and hagiographic dredging up of old Corleone family homilies permeates and nearly engulfs the entire project, leaving little that is new or distinctive that can be identified with the ""Part III"" production.
The film does have its moments, including a powerful final scene ...  But such moments are too few and far between.  Overall, this is a bloated turkey of a production which demonstrates that the sixteen-year interval between ""Part II"" and ""Part III"" was simply too long to sustain the creative energy that rendered the original ""Godfather"" films so successful.  Frankly, it would have been better for the moviegoing public, for Francis Ford Coppola, and certainly for his daughter Sofia had ""The Godfather Part III"" simply never been made.",1012176000,38,3394,5.197802197802198
447391,5,6302158176,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather Part III"" is an incredible standard in mottion pictures. Out of probably the three greatest sequels ever made in one probably the greatest trilogy ever made, and when I say one of the greatest I can not exclude Indiana Jones, because I am the biggest Spielberg fan in the world. ""The Godfather Part III"" is not the best in the series, but it's probably the most intriuging. Given the simple story line, with some great novel twists, ""Part III"" is my favorite. I loved this movie ever since the first frame started to roll. The incredible opening of the abandoned compund in Tahoe, to the ceremony, to the party. The dance that Don Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) does with his daughter, Mary (Sofia Coppola), is incredible. The patriarch of the family is now in his sixties, his relationship with Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), has gone to hell in a handbasket, as so apparent in ""Part II"". Michael is trying very hard to go straight, to have a legitimate life. It's going as he has planned, but when Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), the bastard son of Sonny (James Cann), who met his fiery end in ""Part I"", has come to his Uncle, trying to get rid of the bad blood between him and rival gangster, Joey Zasa (Joe Mantagna), who now controls the family business in New York. Michael and business advisor, BJ Harrison (George Hamilton), want part in a conglomerate called, International Immobiliare. The futrue of the legitimate business deals rests in this company, which rests in the hands of a dying Pope. After 80 minutes, the clan moves out to Sicily to see Michael's son, Anthony, perform in an opera, ""Cavilleria Rusticana."" The climax of the film is very exciting, and the ending is very sad. If you are a person who gets overlly envolved in films, you may need kleenex for the very ironic ending to the Corleone Empire.",1011312000,,1854,4.690184049079755
447392,4,6302158176,"I thought GF3 was actually a pretty good movie. The reason I think it is so widely criticized though is that there are some MINOR flaws, while the first 2 Godfather's had none at all. The most disturbing part of the movie for me is the relationship between Mary Corleone and Vincent Mancini. They are first cousins and have a love affair. As far as Sofia Coppola's portrayal of Mary, it isn't half as bad as everyone is making it out to be. The performance definitely wasn't Oscar material, but it didn't exactly ruin the whole movie either. I'd rather have Sofia Coppola as Mary than Winona Rider. As an Italian-American, a non-Italian actor attempting to portray an Italian character is not credible to me. On another note, I thought the actor who played Anthony Corleone was less convincing in his role than anyone else in the movie (look at the scene when he tells Michael he is dropping out of school). Also, Tom Hagen is missed.
There are also many thigs I love about this movie. The theme of family is moving and convincing thoughout the movie. Al Pacino and Dianne Keaton remain great for their parts and totally recapture their roles as Michael and Kay. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone was excellent in the segment, her acting was actually better than it was in GF1 and GF2. I also liked how we caught up with characters we haven't seen since GF1, such as Johnny Fontane, Don Tomassino, and Lucy Mancini. While none of them have major roles, their parts help to intertwine this movie with the two previous ones. The music is compelling and adds mood to many scenes. The scenes shot in Sicily are truly beautiful and almost worth the price of the movie alone. The dealings with the Vatican shows how powerful the Corleone family has become.
In conclusion, if you compare this movie to GF1 and GF2, you will be disappointed because it has its flaws. HOWEVER, if you watch it expecting an average movie, you'll be pleasantly surprised and discover it really is better above average after all.",1010102400,,1997,4.6440677966101696
447393,3,6302158176,"Francis must LOVE his daughter. How on earth could he have allowed her to remain in the role after watching early clips ?  Didn't he at least have her screen test ? Mindboggling.
I agree with the above review, her casting cost him a third academy award.  While there are other glaring problems, this one is the largest and most obvious.
Second problem is the godawful pacing. Part of Pt. I and Pt. II were slow, but Pt. III suffers from extraordinarily bad editing.
Third, who the hell let Joe Mantega in the back door of this film ?  Wasn't Raul Julia still alive ? Mantega is a ok actor, but painfully out of place in this film.
Besides those two glaring black eyes, the film is suprisingly satisfying. Who wasn't happy to see Sofia get blown away in the end after the acting performance she turned in ? And, the helicopter hit ?  Very creative.
The whole theme of redemption was well scripted. It's easy to believe after all the sins Michael Corleone has committed, that he would want to atone for his bad choices.  (My god, though. You're own brother ? Still gives me chills.)  Coppola knew the public wanted to see Michael get his, and WOW did he give it to him. Powerful stuff.
Sad fact is, it could've and SHOULD'VE been more powerful.",1000771200,6,1242,4.4493392070484585
447394,3,6302158176,"So much of this film goes wrong where it could have gone right--and we'll dispense with the groaning about FFC's casting of Sofia Coppola as Mary; she's not particularly awful, but for a film of this magnitude (and trepidation; many people went in with high expectations), she sinks every scene she's in.
The three main problems with this film is the dialogue the casting, and the pace.  Coppola had Pacino and Brando both play 'Godfather' without having to resort to profanity, until this film.  The inclusion of George Hamilton does not make up for the screen presence of Robert Duvall--Tom Hagen is sorely missed.  And Joe Mantegna could have easily been replaced by either Chazz Palminteri or Armand Assante (just to name a few), both of whom could have brought forward a bit more charisma to the role of Joey Zaza.
The whole subplot of redemption through legalization of the Family holdings is fine--it makes total sense, even if it isn't all that interesting.  My favourite moments came when Pacino was playing Michael at his lowest moments, particularly the confessional scene.
The cinematography is a big plus; the film often looks--particularly in the second half--beautiful, and as usual, Nino Rota's score is never less than totally effective.  The other is the inclusion of Andy Garcia as Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son Vincent--he got a well-deserved Oscar nod for this film.
By the end, however, the film just can't sustain any momentum it ever gets, and we're left thinking it's a letdown, especially when held up to the first two films.  It's worth owning for completion of the story, but you probably won't be watching Part III as much as the other two.",999993600,,1673,4.935943060498221

I much preferred ""Part III"" to ""Part II"", feeling that the theme of attempted redemption and reconciliation was extremely powerful. Michael is again trying to keep his family intact, while coming under increasing fire from other organized crime figures (literally). He is consumed with guilt over the ""hit"" he had ordered on his brother. He is trying to remain connected with his children, and to make amends with his estranged wife. Like ""Part II"", this movie does a good job of trying to connect actual historical events with the fictional plot of the film. In this case, the historical sub-plot involves the surprise election and sudden death of Pope John Paul I. The weakest portion of this film (and what may well have cost it the Academy Award) was the foolish decision on the part of Francis Ford Coppola to cast his daughter Sophia in the key role of Michael's daughter. She executed one of the worst acting performances I've ever seen in my entire life (to the extent that the climax of the film became welcome!) Had a professional been cast in that role, the film would have been much more highly rated and respected.

447399,1,6302158176,"I had to write this review, because I am extremely offended by some of the comments made by the viewer from Derby... ""Godfather 3 is a masterpiece, pure and simple, far surpassing its morally bankrupt predecessors. Anyone who says otherwise has no understanding of character, theme and plotting...and can safely be ignored."" Well, I'm sorry, but I refuse to be ignored. For one, this third film, while it does show Michael attempting to legitimize the family business is not any less ""morally bankrupt"" than the other two.  This film is in fact much more shocking and graphic in its violence, including some particularly gory ear-bitings, and machine-gunnings that were certainly not needed.  Further, there seemed to be a code of honor in the first two films.  The younger characters show none of this code. Vincent is a ticking time bomb, and Mary is a seemingly virginal but duplicitous character. Wouldn't you call an affair between two first cousins ""morally bankrupt""?!? Michael, who claims to have put the Mafia business behind him, once again returns out of revenge. This is morally bankrupt as well. As far as the comment that any one who does not think so has no understanding of character, theme, and plotting, let me tell you that not only did this film lack focus, it lacked energy. It was much more slow-moving than the other films, sometimes torturously show.  Further, the plot never maintained interest, mostly due to the fact that these new, younger characters are neither compelling nor very likable. I go into the ""Godfather"" films expecting to see ""Godfather"" characters, not their children. Children, who, may I say, were atrociously acted, without feeling or depth. I had trouble maintaining my composure through this film. In the other two films, I hung onto every word, trying to piece together the labyrinthine plots. In this one, I left a number of times to go to the bathroom, get a bite to eat, etc, and did not care that I had missed a little. In fact, I hoped that I had just so the movie would end faster. The only reason I would recommend this film, when I would prefer to just pretend it never happened, is the great scenes between Al Pacino and Diane Keaton.  Kay was always the only character who could speak up to Michael, and it was fascinating to see both of these characters in a later part of their lives, continuing their verbal sparing, but still somewhere deep down caring for each other. So prepare to grab your fast forward button and careen swiftly through the few brilliant scenes of this failed conclusion (and skip the end while you're at it). And to the viewer in Derby--if you truly believe that this film is the best of the series, that this movie has great character, theme, and plotting, you are allowed. But the vast majority will not only tell you that you are wrong, but ignorant as well.

Ryder, who was in her prime as an actress, could have elevated this tripe to Oscar status.  A second star deducted for a ridiculous dismissal of Robert Duvall. If the producers were so distraught over Duvall's role demands, they should have wrote him into the script up to the helicopter hit.  Now, that would have added an extra measure of depth, not only to that scene, but to the entire film.  Duvall was the only character (left alive) that was missing from the first two films.  I should deduct another star for some slow paced, crap editing, but I won't.  The Good:  Most fans don't appreciate this, but Coppola wove fiction and non-fiction expertly with the Immobilare/Vatican bank plot.

447431,3,6302158176,"Coppola deserves credit for attempting to tie together the remaining ends of Michael Corleone's life, but he is wide of the mark in this concluding Godfather chapter. Al Pacino is brilliant in his seminal role as Michael, but his acting skills can't compensate for a convoluted and wandering plot, or the fatal flaw that nearly ruins this movie: the casting of Sofia Coppola in the role of Michael's daughter.
  Others might pass off Coppoloa's poor acting skills as ""so what?"" but it's incomprehensible that Coppola allowed his amateur daughter play such a vital role. Every time Sofia Coppola is in a scene, the viewer cringes because her acting abilities are, quite frankly, non-existent. Her limitations as an actress are absolute in every department, and her scenes with Pacino are particularly difficult to watch. Pacino is one of the greatest actors of the post-1950 generation, but here he is saddled with a woman who is not in the same league, by an impossibly wide margin. I noticed other reviewers slamming her for her lack of physical attractions: this is also jarring and ruins an otherwise adequate movie.
  Andy Garcia is quite good in the role of Michael's nephew, Vincent, though he can't hold a candle to James Caan's performance as Sonny in the original Godfather. The Vincent subplot is ultimately plodding and distracting.
  There is one great scene in the movie: when Michael and Kay return to Sicily and he asks her forgiveness and they admit they still love one another. This is as touching and as beautifully written as scene as anything in the previous two Godfather movies.
  Ultimately, Godfather III fails because it faces an impossible task. No movie can duplicate the sheer brilliance of its predecessors and the casting of Sofia Coppola undermines it completely.

447433,5,6302158176,"In disagreement with several reviewers here and in agreement with many others, I want to add my praise of Sofia Coppolla in this wonderful movie.
She *perfectly* plays her character: a spoiled, rich, insulated, and very Americanized Italian-American girl with an excessively romantic heart and an unhealthy dose of naivete regarding her family, especially her estranged father and other people from ""that side"", including her love, Vincent/Vicenzo.  The only basis I can think of for her all-too-frequent and, frankly, vicious critics is that she has a large nose.  Seriously.  Her performance *perfectly* fit the character, she spot-on plays the very picture of the all-American, well-to-do, wannabe-rebellious, and totally ingenue debutante, who, because of the sullied background she never chose, is inevitably caught in the crossfire.  Her character could not have been any other way, and any actress would have played her exactly as Sofia Coppolla did.
And frankly, I think she's a mega-hottie, but I must confess to having a fetish for women with interesting noses.  The whole film, I kept thinking, ""Man, Spike Jonze [her real-life husband] is one lucky man."", and wanted to shout out to Vincent ""No! Don't be the new Godfather! It's a life of pain, loneliness, emptiness.  Go with her!!"" I can see where reasonable people can disagree about her attractiveness, if they have a (boring and oh so typical) preference for mini-noses.  But the digs against her acting are utterly unfounded.  Her performance was flawless.
Her character was all that Michael Corleone could never be but always wanted; she was what he was trying so hard to protect. She was the ultimate movitation for his wanting to go ""legit"", and Sofia portrayed that character perfectly.  Period.
The digs against her are shallow b.s., based on nothing but frat-boy-level assumptions regarding female appearances and the worth of women being equal to their suitability to mainstream, least-common-denominator beauty standards.

Probably the only scene that's indicative of  a modern Mafia is the helicopter hit, and that's one of the best and most  inspired scenes in the movie.  Also (and this is also anachronistic), all  the gangsters you see in the movie are Italians.  There should have been  scenes where Michael Corleone has dealings with Colombian and Asian  gangsters.

447471,5,6302158176,"Before I start my editorial review, I want to say, that this film, iven with its minor flaws, still remains one of the best Mafia Movies ever made (along with G1 and G2 of course). This film, in my opinion, is perfect, as  his famous predecessors, and deserved an Oscar (at least for Best Picture  or Director or iven Best Supporting Actor --Andy Garcia).
  Sixteen  years after they made ""The Godfather Part 2"", Francis Ford  Coppola have been decided to complete the epic story of the Corleone  family.  For those who can remember back to G2, we last left Don Michael  Corleone sitting alone contemplating the fact that he had ordered the  execution of his own brother, Fredo.
  The third installment of the  Godfather trilogy takes place twenty years after G2.  Aging Michael  Corleone is trying to turn his dream into a reality.  His dream has been to  make the Corleone family completely legitimate.  Michael has been  attempting to do this ever since he took over control of the family at the  end of the first film, THE GODFATHER.
  The film opens with an old,  weary, incredibly corrupted Don Michael Corleone receiving a humanitarian  award from the Archbishop.  Michael is later approached by the Archbishop,  who has been placed in financial charge of the Vatican.  In an effort to  help the Vatican overcome their financial trouble Michael offers to donate  600  million dollars in exchange for the Vatican's controlling interest in  a company called Imobilare.  It is Michael's belief that if he can gain  control of the financially strong company he would finally be able to make  the Corleone family legitimate.  Michael encounters problems when several  members of The Vatican council refuse to give controlling interest of  Imobilare to Michael because his family is involved in organized crime.
  Michael is not so easily free of his former underworld allies, however.  When he makes a $600 million play for the international conglomerate  Immobiliare, they want a piece of the cake, seeing an opportunity to  launder their money.  Michael's refusal at a meeting of dons stings more  than a few of his old friends, and brings down a bloody retribution.
  The next Don Corleone--Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), Sonny Corleone's  illigitimate boy--is awaiting his opportunity.  He possesses a ruthlessness  and taste for violence that Michael has long since lost, and as the  Immobiliare stakes escalate, the old head of the family recognizes the need  for youth and strength.  The passing of the baton, however, carries with it  a tragic price.
  The plot of the movie, concocted by Coppola and  Mario Puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines, brings the Corleone  family into the inner circles of corruption in the Vatican. Actual events -  the untimely suddenness of John Paul I's death, the scandals at the Vatican  Bank, the body of a Vatican banker found hanging from a London bridge - are  cheerfully intertwined with the Corleone's fictional story, and it is  suggested that the Vatican lost hundreds of millions in a fraud. We  eavesdrop on corrupt Vatican officials, venal cardinals scheming in the  vast Renaissance palaces that dwarf them, and we travel to Sicily so that  Michael Corleone can consult with Don Tommasino, his trusted old friend  (first appeared in G1), to discover who is plotting against him within the  Mafia council.
  And yet it's strange how the earlier movies fill  in the gaps left by this one, and answer the questions. It is, I suspect,  not even possible to understand this film without knowing the first two,  and yet, knowing them, G3 works better than it should, evokes the same  sense of wasted greatness, of misdirected genius. Both Don Vito Corleone  and Don Michael Corleone could have been great men. But they lacked that  final shred of character that would have allowed them to break free from  their own pasts. Or perhaps their tragedies were dictated by circumstances.  Perhaps they were simply born into the wrong family.
  Al Pacino  returns to his familiar role as Michael Corleone, along with Diane Keaton  who reprises her role as Michael's estranged wife Kay Adams. Also  returning, is Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Michael's sister, who has  turned in middle age into a fierce, thin-faced woman in black, who stands  in the deepest shadows, who schemes and lobbies for her favorites -  especially for Vincent, whom she wants Michael to accept and embrace. Once  lineless and rendered obscure to the plot, Lucy Mancini (original actress  and all) has returned to the saga after being left behind in Part I. And  she has brought a not-so-little remnant of her affair with Santino Corleone  with her. Recall the scene in Part I when Sonny leaves Lucy's apartment  with his henchmen to pick up his sister. That was perhaps the very moment  after which the last Don Corleone was conceived. Another one of Santino's  remnants has returned to the saga in G3: his twins (Francesca and the other  one). They are now grown and still identical, and still adorable too  (unfortunately, they are not developed ever since..). Remember their line  in G2, ""Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!"" and their inclusion in  the Corleone family portrait taken at Connie's wedding. Also returning are  Al Neri, Calo (the Sicilian bodyguard), Tommassino and Johnny Fontaine  (voice still intact).
  The film also stars newcomers Andy Garcia as  Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son, and Sophia Coppola as Michael's  daughter.  The fine cast is also joined by veteran actors Eli Wallach,  George Hamilton and Joe Mantegna.  There is also a small role played by Don  Novello who is best remembered as Father Guido Sarducci on ""Saturday  Night Live.""
  This film is beautifully filmed with splendid  cinematography of New York and Sicily, but it also contains the violence  that has become a trademark of the Godfather films.
  As always,  Pacino is a delight to watch.  The third time around, he brings a mournful  weariness to his character --he portrayed an aging and sick Michael  Corleone who couldn't overcome the guilt of having his brother killed.  This is a man who has paid for all the wrong choices.  Memories haunt him  like ghosts that can never be exorcised.  The emotional toll is shown in  the stoop of his shoulders and the thickness of his voice. The final scene  of the movie, Michael's death, which is intended to echo Marlon Brando's  famous death scene, is perfunctory and awkward.
  Family, as has ever  been the case, is crucial to Michael.  His children are his reason for  living.  In his words, ""The only wealth in this world is children.  More than all the money and power on Earth, [they] are my treasure.""  He says to Mary that he would burn in hell to keep her safe.  It is a  prophetic statement.
  Of course, as I told before, this film has some  minor flaws like: Robert Duvall is missed.  It's impossible not to feel the  vacuum created by his absence.  And because Paramount didn't won't to make  his role bigger in that film, they desided to kill Tom Hagen somewhere  between G2 and G3. George Hamilton's B. J. Barrison is a one- dimensional  necessity of plot, not a ""real"" character.  At least the decision  was made not to replicate Tom Hagen in Barrison.  Hamilton is given little  more to do than stand in the background and speak a fewlines.
  Another unfortunate casting decision was the choice of Sofia (daughter of  Francis) Coppola as Mary (Winona Ryder, the director's preference, was  prevented by fatigue from appearing).  Coppola is pleasant enough to look  at, but her range is limited, and that lack of ability diminishes several  emotionally-charged scenes.  This is the first GODFATHER to have a major  role defined by a poor performance.
  Despite its missteps, THE  GODFATHER PART III packs enough of a punch to deserve a place alongside its  predecessors.  This is no poorly- conceived curiosity.  Not only does the  film bring Michael Corleone's story to a conclusion, but it remains  faithful to the form and style of parts I and II.  Taken as one grand epic,  with this chapter included, the GODFATHER movies represent one of the most  solid, emotionally-rich tales ever committed to film. And if you combine  all three films with ALL their lost scenes (especially from G1 and G2),  like ""The Trilogy"" or ""The Saga"" did, then you'll see,  that the Godfather, is purely, and simply, the BEST GANGSTER-DRAMA film  EVER made.",958867200,8,8424,4.9260588657573585

447474,1,6302158176,"An ill-advised plan to go for the easy money sixteen years after the glory days of Godfather I and II, Coppola and company don't even come close to the spirit and quality of those first two films.
The reason that  Godfather II bucks the sequel trend, and is nearly every bit as good as the  original, is twofold- first, each film introduces a new actor or two to the  immense cast.  The new actor introduced to the mix in Godfather II is  Robert DeNiro as a young Don Corleone, who is a wonderful addition to the  series (For his counterpart in III, see below).  The second reason is that  Puzo's book proved to have too much material for any film (even a lengthy  one) to accomodate.  So with the original still in theatres, Coppola  created a second film from the source material left behind two years  earlier.  Attempting to go ""back to the well"" after nearly two  decades was a bad idea.
Much of the rest of the blame for this terrible  film must fall on the new cast member introduced in this film, Sophia  Coppola.  Heck, if Francis wanted to employ more of his family (not that we  should mind- his father's score is consistently fantastic), he should have  considered Nicholas Cage.  Sophia, replacing a much better actor who  droppped out at the last moment, is completely out of her element (and who  wouldn't be, in her first film?  Still, she took the part, she can take the  lumps).  For as much of the film revolves around her character, this is  inexcusable.  Andy Garcia is a better addition to the ensemble, if a bit  over the top.
The rest of the film is a tired re-hash.  We are even  treated to a new non-Italian consigliere, and George Hamilton is no Robert  Duvall.  Worked the first two times around to have a non-family member as  the Don's advisor, so it should work this time too, right?  Uh uh.  And  that's what's wrong with the film.
All in all, I wish they had left well  enough alone.  The first two films are masterpieces, but this retread is  unneccesary and bland.  If you really want a trilogy, watch one of the  first two films twice.",951868800,4,2071,4.445040214477212
447475,4,6302158176,"Many fans of the original think this one is terrible - maybe compared to the first two, but it is, by itself, a very good, if somewhat uneven film. [Pacino doesn't really doesn't come across as the same character he was in  the first two.]",950227200,,239,4.311111111111111
447476,5,6302158176,"Some critics complain that Sofia Coppola was inexperienced for such a big role.  I disagree.  Ms. Coppola's inexperience helped her play the character of Mary more convincingly.  While it is true she sometimes seemed  rather ""valley girl,"" this shouldn't be surprising.  Michael did  his best to shelter her from the harsh realities of life in the Corleone  Family, and the upbringing and guidance from her father came across in her  portrayal of Mary.
Another criticism is Michael's quest for redemption...  that such a notion does not square with the character in Parts I and II.  Again, I disagree.  Recall Michael wanted nothing to do with the Family  Business in Part I.  His father had hopes he might become ""Senator  Corleone... Governor Corleone,"" but this was not to be.  Michael had  to step in for the sake of his family. This necessity does not change the  fact that at one time he was a good son, who simply wanted to become a math  professor, marry, and have a family. In Part II, he obviously put this  notion behind him, but there must have been a part of the ""old  Dartmouth Michael"" lurking somewhere deep inside.
In the years  following the end of Part II in 1959, Michael took steps to legitimize the  Corleones by getting out of illegitimate businesses.  That done, he sought  forgiveness for the wrongs he'd done.  Had he not been betrayed in Part  III, he would have likely found the redemption and peace he sought on a  personal level.  In addition, the Corleone Family would have been the  legitimate family enterprise that would preserve and protect future  generations of Corleones, as well as reform Vatican finances.  This would  have fulfilled his father's dream.
Some say the opera scene was too long.  I disagree, and think it was both moving and beautiful.  We're watching  scenes from a violent opera that had a sub-theme of revenge.  At the same  time the opera is being performed on the stage, a real opera is about to  take place in the audience.  The music from ""Cavalleria  Rusticana"" is perfect for this film - especially the final, moving  scene in the courtyard of Michael's villa.
I'd say Part III is the  ""third best"" of the series, but it is worth owning and watching,  over and over again.  The film should have received some academy awards,  and I'll never understand why it didn't.",949017600,55,2329,4.741206030150754

7823329,3,6302158176,"I might have been able to follow this final part of the Godfather series if I'd been able to hear the dialog. I watched it on the Roku version of Netflix. I don't know if that was the problem or the fact that so much of the dialog was done just above a whisper, but I only caught about 30% of what was being said. And that was with the volume as high as it would go. It made trying to follow who was doing what to whom and why a bit difficult.

I missed all the hoopla when this first came out, so I didn't know until after watching it that Mary was played by Coppola's daughter, Sophia. I found her acting to be okay enough. She wasn't exactly a major character - despite the desperate attempt to make her one - so she was adequate. The whole incest thing between her and Vincent though was ill-advised. Truthfully, the acting was a bit lackluster across the board. Can't specify what was missing, but something was. I couldn't help but feel that Andy Garcia would have been justified in suing the rest of them for non-support.

But the real problem was the convoluted plot that relied way too much on trying to retrod scenes from the original films. Flashbacks, used successfully in the first two, were annoying here as they did nothing to clarify or further the story. Improbable action, such as the slaughter scene in Atlantic City were next door to ludicrous. Someone slaughters all the top Dons and nobody even blinks? Mafia wars have started over a lot less. At the very least a massive power struggle would have ensued. And, Oh Hey, let's redo Vito's killing of Fanucci with different characters!

Maybe this was a case of waiting too long between films and losing the touch and tone generated by the first two, but all in all this was definitely not Coppola's finest hour.",1520035200,,1781,4.440366972477064
