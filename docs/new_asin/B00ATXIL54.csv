5509971,4,B00ATXIL54,"having practicing magick for many years, I like watching movies with magick as the theme. This film had all the elements of intrigue, comedy and a fine storyline. I would recommend this flick and gave it a four star.",1368144000,,216,4.564102564102564

5509973,1,B00ATXIL54,"Poor story line. Confusing plot. While lead actors are good, their talent is wasted in a poorly made movie. Don't waste your time and money. How it got 4 stars is a puzzle.",1366070400,,172,4.242424242424242
5509974,3,B00ATXIL54,This film has great opening act.  A fantastic second act.  The curtain call is not what you would expect as it turns into a buddy film out of the blue.,1365897600,,151,4.0
5509975,5,B00ATXIL54,"This was a very, very enjoyable movie and not typical of what I have found in chinese movies.  This movie has comedy,intrigue, unique plot twists, and interesting magic tricks.  I don't want to say too much without being fearful of giving plot twists away, but I will say if you are a fan of the genre, I would recommend this movie as it is unlike anything I have seen before in the genre and I feel it is unique.  If you are looking for a movie that isn't hard to follow, but has several plot twists and has some light comedy, pick this one up.",1365379200,,545,4.171428571428572

JUDGMENT CALL:

Featuring a wonderful pairing of two great HK actors Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Lau Ching-wa with elegant actress Zhou Xun , ""The Great Magician"" is a film that is well-acted, features plenty of humor, action and fantasy elements.

For the most part, the film is a comedy.  Lau Ching-wa plays the warlord Bully who is rumored to be a tyrant, but in truth, he is kindhearted and  doesn't like to see people getting hurt.  But he knows the importance of his power as a warlord and despite his lieutenant Liu wanting to exert power on the people, Bully resists.  Part of the charm of Bully Lei is that he is so unlike the warlord that people think of him as.

Clumsy and naive, Lau Ching-wa is a versatile actor who knows how to get people to laugh through facial movements and his action and he achieves it in ""The Great Magician"".

For Bully is mostly a man that is dedicated in growing his empire but finding a way to have his seventh wife, Liu Yin love him.

Liu Yin is an independent woman who has been kept confined by Liu Yin.  A woman who just wants her father to be freed and will never submit to him or any man.  Actress Zhou Xun has done a fantastic job in many films, playing the cold or somewhat emotionless characters.  In ""The Great Magician"", she is a woman who was left behind by her fiance Chang and now that he has returned, she is not sure if she has any love for him any more.

Typically, you don't see to many Hong Kong films, especially one set in the 1920s where a woman is portrayed as strong and not the typical damsel in distress role.  The character is portrayed as independent and strong.

Meanwhile, the role of Chang is wonderfully performed by veteran Tony Leung Chiu-wai.  A suave and confident magician, he wants to save his former fiance and her father, but realizes how much she has changed in years because it took so long for him to come back for her.

A film showcasing a love triangle, it becomes more interesting when Bully comes to the magician Chang in hopes to learn magic to woo his seventh wife Liu Yin. But since Yin's father is a master magician and her former boyfriend is also a magician, she has seen it all.

The film does feature a storyline about corrupt Chinese working with the evil Japanese who seek to cause disruption in Bully's land.  While the Lt. Liu Kun Shan (portrayed by Wu Gang) is seen as the primary antagonist, part of the problem of the film is that it tries to be a film about a love triangle, yet tries to incorporate this behind-the-scenes planning of a coup between Liu and the Japanese.  Because the film is a comedy, the antagonists action can't be taken as anything too deep.  And as a viewer, it's not easy to care for this other side story as you are more invested on Chang and whether or not he can free his former love and her father.

For the most part, at 129 minutes, you feel that the pacing is off as too much of the plot involving the coup attempt is going too fast and feels rushed.

But as a fan of Derek Yee's films, it's good to see him doing something outside of crime thrillers.  Not emotional, dark or deep, this is a film that is bound with humor, visual effects and is quite enjoyable as a comedy.

The film does look wonderful on Blu-ray and the visual effects on the magic used throughout the film is nicely done.  Costume design is also well done and cinematography is very good.  Especially the wire-work for stunts throughout the film.  The lossless soundtrack is well-done and is quite immersive.  I wish there were more special features but I am glad that a  38-minute featurette was included as most Asian cinema tend to only have short featurettes and a trailer.

Overall, ""The Great Magician"" is a fun, witty action fantasy film featuring wonderful performances by Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Lau Ching-wa and Zhou Xun.  But with a lengthy film with frenetic pacing of its intricate plot full of twists and turns, while entertaining, some portions of the film does lose its luster due to frenetic pacing.  Still enjoyable and a Hong Kong film worth watching!",1364601600,2,6028,4.742307692307692
5509977,5,B00ATXIL54,"Nearly any film with Tony Leung Chiu Wai is worth seeing, and this is one of them (one might want to miss his recent ""The Silent War"").

And every film with the adorable Zhou Xun is worth seeing (including her recent ""The Silent War"").

Without being informed in advance that this film, ""The Great Magician,"" is a broad farce, a comedy, one might be puzzled about what is happening -- until one sees tiny Zhou Xun whip Bully's butt in response to his efforts to ""woo"" her.

Relax and enjoy.  And then, if you haven't already, see Tony Leung in ""Chungking Express"" (with the wonderful Faye Wong), ""2046"" (with Zhang Ziyi), ""Chinese Odyssey 2002"" (with Faye Wong), and ""Lust, Caution,"" and Zhou Xun in ""Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress,"" ""The Banquet"" (with Zhang Ziyi), ""The Equation of Love and Death,"" and, ""True Legend"".

I am unbiased in recommending Tony Leung, as he is my favorite actor.

And equally unbiased in recommending Zhou Xun, though the universe itself, as a whole, recognizes the infinite tragedy that she doesn't know that I exist.",1364083200,,1057,4.78021978021978
5509978,5,B00ATXIL54,"I had heard good things about ""The Great Magician,"" and was suitably impressed by the magic (no, it's not all CGI!), story and action in the wonderful film. Other than a few bad words, I would recommend this for kids, but let's leave it at teen audiences and above. Tony Leung gives an admirable performance and the other actors are first rate, too! It was interesting to learn how some of the illusions are performed, but I'm betting other magicians won't like the tricks of the trade being exposed!",1361145600,3,500,4.629213483146067
5509999,5,B00ATXIL54,"Since I saw several movies of Wong Kar Wai with Tony Leung years ago, I am a great admirer of this great Actor. So I also like movies that have some weaknesses. The plot of this film suffers from some silliness.

The performance of Tony Leung Chiu Wai is beyond any doubt. Overall I like the movie very much.",1374624000,4,308,4.220338983050848
5510000,5,B00ATXIL54,"Didn't think I could like a Asian movie without Kung Fu fighting, but I absolutely loved it! Love the ending.",1373673600,,109,4.5
5510001,4,B00ATXIL54,"I thought this movie was fantastic. Great story, plot twists, ect.

One problem. The description for it, both on amazon and netflix, having nothing to do with the actual film. There is no ""eight immortals"" mentioned in the movie at all. Ever.

Puzzling.",1373587200,6,253,4.8604651162790695
5510002,4,B00ATXIL54,Loved the nuances in the film between the two male leads and their female interest. Great imagery and an imaginative story line make this a fun movie to watch. Enjoyed every minute of it.,1373500800,,187,4.529411764705882
5510003,3,B00ATXIL54,"Set in the early 20th century of China, years after the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the Revolution in 1911, ""The Great Magician"" revolves around Tony Leung Chiu Wai's renowned illusionist Chang Hsien arriving in a town where a powerful warlord Lei Bully (Lau Ching-wan) rules. While Lei Bully tries to win the heart of his ""seventh wife"" Liu Yin (Zhou Xun), the magician seems interested in the same girl imprisoned by the warlord.

This is an entertainment-oriented movie from Tung-Shing Yee (Derek Yee), director of such intense crime dramas as ""One Nite in Mongkok"" and ""Shinjuku Incident."" ""The Great Magician"" is a light-hearted fantasy action movie - at least that is what it strives to be - but the overlong film (the running time exceeding two hours) simply needs a better story.
]
The best part of the film is the stars Tony Leung Chiu Wai, Lau Ching-wan and Zhou Xun. The characters they play are not exactly convincing, but their superb performances almost succeed in making them look credible, together with the great production values.

However, there are so many characters that pop up and disappear unceremoniously, as well as so many intrigues going on involving the Qing Dynasty supporters, Japanese military officers and Chinese revolutionaries. There are also subplots about the secret of magic spell.

So what the film is all about? It is a love story, I think, but the love story is suddenly replaced by something else in the final chapter. Perhaps the idea of a great magician as a hero of a special effects-ridden action is to be blamed. So where is the magic? ""The Great Magician"" is fairly amusing action that is curiously unexciting.",1371081600,3,1665,4.897163120567376
5510004,2,B00ATXIL54,"It was not worth the time nor money.
I would like to return it and ger money back!
I would say it was something a child or teenager might enjoy.",1370649600,,144,3.8333333333333335
5510005,4,B00ATXIL54,"Just for fun. A delightful, light hearted movie.  The actors were very good and perfect for this type of movie.  Please remember, this is a Chinese movie, not an American one. You will have to read, but at a point, you are enjoying the film and forget that your even reading along.",1370304000,,281,4.384615384615385
5510006,4,B00ATXIL54,"intelligent depiction of an era in china we are not allowed to see
though many of these movies are overpriced",1369872000,,109,4.5
5510007,5,B00ATXIL54,"Others have written more extensive & knowledgeable reviews, but I just wanted to add my two cents' worth. The magic entertainments are truly entertaining, the special effects fun, the acting wonderful. As an added treat we get to see a scene that has to be seen to be believed: a large table around which generals sit and move figures of soldiers as they argue strategy...or whatever it is they're really talking about...because this is actually a table surrounded by some of today's greatest Chinese directors having what is obviously great fun! It is astonishing. You can learn about it in the making-of feature included with the movie. A must-see that the movie's (really) director accurately describes as leaving the audience feeling happy!",1369440000,,744,5.10655737704918
5510008,5,B00ATXIL54,Bought this movie at Target after reading the general opinions on Amazon. But having felt a little let down by overwhelming critics from Amazon in the past still wondered if I wasted my money. After watching the movie felt more entertained than expected and the story line was quite good.,1369008000,,288,4.78
8557731,3,B00ATXIL54,"Don't be fooled by the trailer. This movie is more The Royal Tramp and less Detective Dee.
Not a bad movie, just quite different from what the trailer promises.",1489622400,,160,4.551724137931035

8557737,5,B00ATXIL54,The movie itself is a feat of magic.  It is very well acted and has an original plot.  I don't want to spoil it anymore than that.,1390867200,,130,3.7777777777777777
8557738,5,B00ATXIL54,Tony Leung plays a charismatic stage magician that has troubles abroad to perfect his craft. He blends traditional Chinese magic acts with Western tricks as well. The performances are a highlight of the movie. The other two subplots involving the love story between Tony Lueng and Chiu Wai are intersting and add an elements of a romantic comedy. While the overall threat of the Japanese Invasion/Rebirth of the Manchu Dynasty is intriguing giving the WWI era feel to the movie. It definitely keeps you entertained and involved.,1381190400,4,528,5.080459770114943
8557739,5,B00ATXIL54,This is a pretty good movie to watch. Its a bit like The Prestige & The Illusionist mixed asian style. The cast is great. The scenery is fantastic. The magic tricks are very intriguing to watch. I'm glad I bought this movie.,1378166400,,224,4.357142857142857
8557740,4,B00ATXIL54,"Great special effects for the magic tricks and pulling back the veil on how some of it is done, interesting story line, decent suspense, refreshingly deep characters.",1375488000,,166,5.185185185185185
