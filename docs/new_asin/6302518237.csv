478112,5,6302518237,"I first saw this on HBO too. This movie is a heartfelt gem! Ami Dolenz plays an adorably cute and sexy genie. Dean Cameron is great. My Daughter watched this and she loved it. This movie has the potential to be a major hit with all ages. If Disney would have released this, it would have been a big $$$ making classic. I own it on VHS, and I have been checking once a month for the past 2 years awaiting its release on dvd!

Ami Dolenz is a goddess in this movie and and she only adds to the role she plays so well. I agree, this is her best movie. I developed a crush on her after watching this movie. She has beautiful blue eyes. She is a dream girl. She is absolutely stunning in this great movie!

While I believe there are two versions of the film, I think the 'R' rated version is hysterical. If you love Dean Cameron, like I do, then you will LOVE this film.",1016323200,4,315,4.266666666666667

478208,3,6302518237,I've seen this movie a few times now but only the edited television editions.  It was a classic Dean Cameron movie with lots of quips & a plethora of beautiful women in bikinis and less.  Ami Dolenz was delightful as always. Funniest part for me was Dean Cain being listed as volleyball player number 1.  If you are in the mood for mindless fun then go for it,1464307200,2,359,4.25

Although it's not in my library,  the quality of the movie is impeccable and brings back what I love about these older 90's films. It has a very different story line and is a pretty cool movie that has still held up in the test of time with comedy and love.

478333,4,6302518237,"Scotty (Dean Cameron) loses his girlfriend, his apartment, and his job all in one bad morning.  Depressed, he sits on a bench on the beach next to a beachcomber (Pat Morita), who gives him a fancy bottle.  He lies down on the bench to sleep, wishing he was in a comfortable bed with two hot chicks.  When he wakes up, voila!  The bottle houses Jeannie (Ami Dolenz), whose job is to grant his every wish.  Well, almost every one; she can't make Dana, the hot model of his dreams, love him.  What she can do is give him all the tools to woo her - fancy home, nice clothes, great car.  Those things work, sort of, Dana makes herself very available, but not exclusively so.  But it turns out that genies have human emotions too - who knew?  Jeannie falls for Scotty, and we have the love triangle that makes the movie (like thousands of others).

All very predictable, but deftly assembled and engagingly performed.  And the girls!  There are beautiful topless girls from beginning to end, starting with Monique Gabrielle as Scotty's straying girlfriend, through the two hot chicks granted as his first wish, to the contestants in an international beauty pageant (seriously). If you like looking at beautiful breasts, your wishes will be fulfilled like Scotty's.  Recommended for when you're in the mood for it.",1403568000,13,1307,4.704845814977974
478334,5,6302518237,"I glad they are finally transferring movies that can only be found on VHS. Movies like this bring back memories of a special time. Now if they can only find a way to put ""hamburger the movie"" on prime.",1390089600,,201,4.17948717948718
478335,4,6302518237,"OK, I admit this is a low-budget, bikini & t**ty B-movie, but it's also kinda sweet.  From almost the start you know what is going to happen but you still want to watch it, because Ami Dolenz (playing Jeannie) is so good.  She is that rare combination of sweet and hot.  Beautiful eyes and THE nicest smile EVER.  Her role doesn't require great acting, but for what the role is she does it perfectly.  The other actors range from bad to just OK, but it does not really matter because whenever Ami in on screen you are watching her.  After Scotty (played by Dean Cameron) gets a clue, the movie has a happy and predictable ending.  Ami never takes her top off (unlike other girls in this movie) but it is better that way.  She still looks fine in a bikini.

This is really a happy, sweet, and cute movie.",1361923200,3,803,4.3
478336,2,6302518237,I first saw this movie when I was in high school.  I remember it being better than it was.  The bright spot throughout this movie is Ami Dolenz.,1361836800,,144,4.107142857142857

is on DVD,  I have quite a few that aren't, but I keep looking.",1351123200,,148,4.285714285714286
478388,5,6302518237,"I first discovered this movie 20 years ago, on HBO, and it's one of my favorites! It's one of those small, overlooked movies, but a real gem when you are fortunate enough to find it!

I can't believe that it has never been released on DVD, and remastered, but one should definately own it on VHS tape, or at least record it from TV the next time it is broadcast.

The movie is such a sweet, charmer, and one that really makes you hope for the two main characters to realize how much they really like each other, and that true love is what really matters. It's told in a very moving way--even though the movie is also a terrifically funny comedy.

What really makes this movie stand out for me, though, and still think of it all these years later, is the wonderful onscreen presence of Ami Dolenz as Jeanie!! Ami and I are the same age, and ever since I saw her for the first time, in this movie, I've really had a crush on her! Her character--through which Ami is able to convey much of her real-life personality--is so sweet, innocent, naive, caring, and adorable that one cannot help but fall in love with her! Plus, she comes across as such a neat girl--not the notorious ""cool girl,"" but rather the kind of funny, charming, and fun, regular kind of girl that anyone in REAL life would be lucky to find.

I very much hope for more new movies with Ami Dolenz and that this wonderful and beautiful actress will finally receive the recognition she deserves, and I hope that ""Miracle Beach"" will finally get the recognition IT deserves with a DVD release!!!",1338076800,,1556,4.43006993006993
478389,4,6302518237,"There are two versions of this movie, one rated and one unrated.  For children and the young at heart the rated version is a sweet fairy tale, with the charming and and singularly gorgeous Ami Dolenz at the story's center. She is a well-meaning but not so good genie who is on her last chance to help a hapless human. He is rather a simpleton, wanting to use her powers to help him land his fantasy girl, a self-absored TV advertising model. But causing a person to fall in love is the one power genies cannot provide. Along the way, our genie falls in love with the goofy but earnest young man. And he, at last, finally realizes this, providing the classic happy ending.  BUT BE FOREWARNED, the unrated version adds numerous gratuitous scenes of topless and g-string babes, turning the film into yet another of that genre and definitely not for those under 18 even with parents present.",1312243200,4,887,4.572327044025157
478390,4,6302518237,"I really did want to like ""Miracle Beach"" -- a lot.  I have a good imagination, and always did enjoy ""I Dream Of Jeannie"" on TV.  This updated story of a young man, newly homeless, who comes into possession of a magic bottle, (which even LOOKS like the one on ""I Dream of Jeannie""0 with a genie, (a gorgeous blonde girl genie -- again!), inside, seemed OK.  I mean -- OK -- the srory IS a bit derivative....but if I liked the orginal, (and I did), this updating COULD still be fun -- couldn't it?

As an old-fashioned girl, (the 1890s would have suited me better tnan even the 1960s), I was appalled by the nudity and loud rock music.  Still, the quartet playing subtle jazz music looked to me too old and (mainly) too bored to add anything exciting to the story -- except for their music.  The script is good in this story -- but the acting only so-so.  The girl playing the genie at least had SOME range of emotions, (from A - R), but the guy playing her father, (and chief genie) had almost no emotion at all, relying on his impressive presence, (and he DOES have one), for most of the emotions in his few scenes.

The rest of the cast -- including our earstwhile homeless hero -- aren't too bad.  The react to situations, rather than act them -- but in a story like this one, this is a very small error.

The story ends happily.  The girl of our hero's dreams is NOT interested in him, but the lovely, long-suffering Genie does.  Realizing this, the two become solemates....and a happy ending is had.

This movie doesn't have the spontaniousness and joy of the first few episodes of ""I Dream Of Jeannie"", but neither does it sink to the repetiticeness and slight bordom of the last few episodes of the TV show.  This updated version gives ""I Dream of Jeannie"" an updated twist -- and it's nice to see that so many other people liked it....even more than I did!  I still wonder why, in this movie version, as well as in the old TV show, that the ""Jeannie"", (obviously a native of the Middle-East), still continues to have blonde hair...but that's a very small quibble.  Imagination, love of the fantastic, and of happy endings, still lives!  It's good to know that
they do....and hopefully, these qualities will continue into all future generations, as well!",1287705600,,2261,4.462287104622871

Ami Dolenz looks so sweet and innocent with those blue eyes, and that definitely helps sell her genie character. Dean Cameron does a great Scotty Mckay, going from kicked to the curb by his landlord to finding a genie to help him live his dream of falling in love with ""the perfect woman"". Along the way his perfect woman isn't who he thought she was. Nice romantic comedy that at times pulls at the heart strings..",1164931200,5,509,4.204081632653061

The Blu Ray picture and sound are fine.  Bare bones release save for a couple trailers.  As this movie actually has a bit of a following that is disappointing.  There are two versions of this film; a ""clean"" version shot for TV and an ""uncut"" version.
