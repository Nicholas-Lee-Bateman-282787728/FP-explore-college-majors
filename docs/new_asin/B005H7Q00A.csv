It is so nice to have my computer next to me as I work to pause or go back in the dvd when I have a question. It is as if I have a personal instructor every step of the way. Scarlett has done a great job on this course with very detailed work laying out the pattern and putting it together for a perfectly smooth fit.
Now if I only had more places to wear these works of art :-)",1418428800,,653,3.917293233082707
