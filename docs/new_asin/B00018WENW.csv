1977008,5,B00018WENW,"I loved every minute of it, all over again. Growing up in England and going to Public schools  really brings back the memories. The acting and story lines are riveting, you can't wait to get back to it. You will love this one and watch it many times over as I will.",1080432000,5,265,4.096153846153846
1977009,5,B00018WENW,"Simply put, TSTAMD is 11 hours of riveting drama, being without a doubt one of the best mini-series ever produced by the BBC.  I first saw it on TV in 1980/81, and have been waiting ever since for it to be released either on tape or DVD.  And now it's here, and well worth the wait.  The acting is superb. The story is always interesting.  Such is the exceptional level of production that you actually feel like you are really there; the characters and story being so well portrayed.
The DVD picture quality is superb; however the sound is only average by today's standards but quite acceptable.
If you love fine acting, deep character development and a great story this is a must see.

I have replayed those tapes many times in the intervening years and wondered if and when the series would be available on DVD. Now, just before those tapes wear out, here it is! As Mr. Fetzer says in the synopsis, the acting is impeccable, the story draws your interest quickly and holds you through the entire 13 hours. This is a must for any DVD library. This is well worth the investment in money and time.",1075680000,,492,4.477777777777778
1977012,5,B00018WENW,"It's taken a while (a substantial understatement) but 'To Serve Them All My Days' one of the Beeb's finest ever dramas gets the DVD release its many admirers have for so long demanded. And it beggars the question, what have the BBC been playing at?
TSTAMD - an Andrew Davies adaptation don't forget, a giant in the biz over on the Brit side of the pond - has been criminally ignored by the BBC for years, garnering only a late-night re-run on cable/satellite channel UK Drama in recent memory. They should be truly ashamed of themselves.
It's not a promising premise, admittedly; shell-shocked socialist miner's son recuperates from his experiences at Passchendaele by taking a job as history master at second rate public (that's private to you) school.
The drama takes place between the wars, following young David Powlett-Jones as he grows up and learns to compromise his hotheadedness enough to actually teach his young charges something about 'real' life. Like all the best stories it's about change, about reacting and growing and moving on. And it's constructed briliantly.
It'll fly off the shelves, and I'm getting my order in now. I advise you to do likewise.",1075334400,6,1168,4.934010152284264

1977016,4,B00018WENW,I saw this miniseries when it originally aired in 1980 on PBS. While the acting is superb it does not follow the book and on my opinion the book is vastly better. David Powlett Jones was written as a gentle soul but John Duttone portrays him as an angry man.

1977029,5,B00018WENW,"This is my absolute favorite BBC production, ever. The best.

It's about a shell-shocked soldier, who upon returning from WW1, finds a job at a private [public, to the Brits] boys school. Although educated, he is from the mining towns of Wales, and quite often shakes up the sensibilities of the other teachers and some of the students with his politics, but this is really about a man's life. The series is very long, and takes him from youth to middle-age. The acting is superb, every single character is perfect, and there are many exciting moments -deaths, politics,  fires, kids going missing, a few love affairs, true romance - but most compelling is his move up the academic ladder, despite the upper-middle classes prejudices against his modest roots.

This is the most perfect character study ever done by the BBC.  It's not new, probably made in the seventies, so most people will miss it, of course. The acting believable, and the protagonist portrays his somewhat conflicted character accurately - you completely understand why he does what he does and says what he days. The writing is excellent. The portrayal of the time periods, and as time progresses is charming and will draw you in even more fully.

I never wanted it to end, and the friends I've given it to as a gift made the same comment.",1452988800,4,1310,4.753303964757709

Covers much the same period as James Hilton's ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"" and plays on your emotions in much the same way, although it's a much more ambitious tale than Hilton's.

1977059,5,B00018WENW,"This BBC production of John Duttine's novel aired on PBS in the 1980's. Last year we tried to revisit it by renting CDs from Netflix. Because the last few CDs were defective we purchased this set.

1977060,5,B00018WENW,"This miniseries was first aired on Masterpiece theater back in the early 80's, and it's a thoughtful, well-cast, well-acted story of the life of a Welsh officer fresh from the hospital after being invalided out during World War I-- in 1917.  Wounded twice, three years of combat at the front-- he's a basket case badly in need of a place to build himself.  And he finds it.

I knew nothing about English public schools (what Americans would call private schools), and nothing about England in the period between the wars, and this series taught me a great deal while entertaining my wife and I with it's characters, it's story line and the quality production.

It's very entertaining, very funny at times, very tearful at times, and very, very well done.

We love this series and were delighted to see it all over again these many years after we first saw it-- and it was even better than we remembered it.",1402617600,,906,4.6375

1977078,5,B00018WENW,"An excellent series from the BBC, with a screenplay by Andrew Davies.  The story runs from almost the end of WWI to the beginning of WWII.  The story is basically about a soldier returning from the trenches of WWI to become a teacher to privileged boys in England.  His job is to ready the boys for the future, and the future for most of the boys is, unfortunately, WWII.  It is a very well written, and excellently acted series.",1367798400,,429,4.3924050632911396

The story is about a WWI British Soldier  who is shell shocked. It is suggested that he go to a healthy community and with  fresh air.  He recovers from his ordeal in the army and goes on to become a remarkably fine teacher in a public boys' prep school,. The story  has a wonderful human warmth about it. It is a beautiful study in the human condition, loss, and war. Any one interested in WWI literature should find it a very fine film.

My husband has been a teacher for 40 years in an until-recently all boy boarding school. I made him watch the first night of this show when it originally aired on Masterpiece Theater back in the 80s and he got hooked.

1977082,5,B00018WENW,"This 1980 BBC Miniseries is based on a novel set in the early 1900s.  It reflects on the story of Lieutenant David Powlett-Jones, a young veteran of three years of World War I, removed from active duty because of a leg wound and a severe case of what was then called ""shell shock.""  Thinking he might recover in the country, his doctor recommends that he pursue his dream of becoming a schoolmaster.  The film opens when a troubled Powlett-Jones arrives at rural Bamfylde Boarding School for boys.  The story is riveting as the schoolmaster faces personal tragedies and vocational challenges. The characters, from the cheerful but wise headmaster, to Powlett-Jones' colleagues, his students, and the women he loves, are fascinating and perfectly portrayed.  The 11 episodes cover about 20 years of the romance, trauma, contention, humor, and tragedy of the life of Powlett-Jones.  Highly recommended.",1348617600,,900,5.172413793103448
1977083,4,B00018WENW,"...this may not be your cup of tea. This is the Masterpiece Theatre's adaption of R.F.Delderfield's novel of the same name.  It tells the story of a young Welsh miner's son who was wounded in WWI. He is hired on as a history teacher at an elite boarding school, even with his socialistic political leanings, and eventually becomes the school's headmaster.  Along the way, his love life suffers setbacks and he endures professional setbacks, as well. The tale is inspirational, and the lives of the boarding school teachers and students is well explored.  The adaption spans the time between WWI and WWII, and references the politics of the times in a way that is integral to the story, unlike the Downton Abbey saga. This story is considerably drier and more 'stiff upper lip' than the modern romanticized tales of today.

The program was produced in 1980, so there is some lack of vividness of the imagery, though I suspect the videography was always a bit static.  The story sags a bit in the middle, but there is an authenticity to the story, as a whole.  It made me want to make up a pot of tea with a side of scones with jam and sit back to enjoy. John Duttine stars as David Powlett- Jones with a host of pre-Harry Potter English character actors, many who have been seen in other Masterpiece productions over the years.",1341792000,5,1326,4.5974576271186445
1977084,5,B00018WENW,"This has got to be one of my favorite PBS series. My dad, who spent time in England during WWII said it was spot on. I don't understand why someone would call it tripe.... Only problem I had with the film was killing off both of the twins.  Would have liked to have seen Grace grow up. Other than that it was very true to the book. Cant say that about a lot of films.

1977095,5,B00018WENW,"All of us have favorite books, movies, poems, TV shows and even mini-series.  For me, this one has stood the test of time.  Many years after seeing it, I can remember - and picture - so many of the scenes.

Having grown up without a grandfather, I decided early on that I would adopt the Headmaster, Algy Herries, to be my honorary grandfather.  He had the enthusiasm of a child, the wisdom and vision of someone who saw the world the way it was but did his best to make it better.  He knew when a child (or a teacher) needed a cup of tea from his wife, Elly.  And he knew when it was time to push them past their fears and help them step up to the possibilities before them.

The characters are well realized and credible, and I adored David Powlett-Jones's first wife. Who would not have loved her?

I hope people will buy this and watch it.  I'm going to see if I can convince my 14-year-old grandson to watch it with me.  He just visited the 911 memorial in New York and may be better attuned to the sweep of history that is the backdrop of To Serve Them All My Days.",1335744000,2,1071,4.130434782608695
1977096,4,B00018WENW,"I enjoyed ""To Serve them All My Days"" immensely. Each hour-long episode is riveting with dramatic suspense. There are three episodes per disc, on four discs--and it was all I could do to wait until the next evening to watch the next--except the last disc, which, to my disappointment, had only two episodes (I did not want the story to end!). Since others have given details of the story, I shall remark only on the production.

This film, made in 1980, is one of the old-fashioned BBC dramas, which emphasised quality in production, costume, and setting. It goes without saying that the characters are superbly acted [I especially liked Algie, the first Headmaster, an Anglican priest]. The story is heartwarming; in fact, one may want to keep a box of tissues handy for the weepy bits. Set in a British Public School [i.e., private, but publicly funded so that any boy who qualifies can attend], the production, which was filmed at Milton Abbey in Dorset, focuses on the lives of the Masters and their charges from 1916 to approximately 1931.

Although the cinematography is excellent, the color has, unfortunately, deteriorated, especially the skies, which have become pale, and if characters are standing with the sky at their backs, haloes hover slightly over their heads. This, however, is only an occasional problem, and the story is so interesting that I did not let it bother me.

I did notice significant changes in the story, which I first heard as a BBC radio series, based on the novel, but the series is strong enough to stand on its own.

If you like action-packed adventure, ""To Serve Them All My Days"" is not for you, but if you like quality drama, about an England that has largely vanished, this film will indubitably be your cup of quality tea!",1323388800,2,1764,4.773770491803279
1977097,5,B00018WENW,"Like so many other reviewers have stated, I agree that this is one of the best mini-series the BBC ever produced (and later aired via PBS Masterpiece Theatre). The drama is engagaing, the acting is excellent and the characters and events seem so very plausible. It's also very visually striking, often in a stark manner. It very much reminds me of tales my mates told of their days at public school. My grandfather was also a young soldier in the trenches of WWI and suffered shellshock in a similar manner to David Powlett-Jones.

I'm surprised this series isn't more of a household name, the way Upstairs, Downstairs is. I don't know how I missed this in the 1980s. I only learned of it recently when Netflix suggested I might like it based on my viewing preferences, and it was right. It was so good that I had to buy the series, as the whole family enjoyed it and will want to watch it again - and I only buy DVDs of our favourites.",1316995200,,936,4.410404624277457

1977099,5,B00018WENW,"After viewing the first episode of this series and hearing the bittersweet theme that accompanies the rolling of the credits, one feels transported to a lost time and place that can only exist in the imagination.  Such pure heart and yearning for the ideal cannot exist in the world of our everyday life.  As you watch the series unfold and allow the characters and story to carry you to that rare place, you are given a sense that life can be so precious and replete with meaning.

We watch as David adjusts to life as a school master, learns to deal with the privileged boys and the opinionated staff, experiences love and loss, and grows up to be just the man the headmaster knew he would.

This 13-part miniseries on four disks is simply wonderful.  The story spans twenty years, going slowly so we get to know and care about David and his associates.  John Duttine is very convincing as the timid and self-conscious young man who gradually learns about life and people.  Middlemass is excellent as the wise and cheerful headmaster and Alan MacNaughton gives a particularly touching performance as a crusty old house master.  The series was filmed on location in a beautiful English boys' school and the sense of history and tradition is palpable.

The story finds comedy and tragedy in everyday situations.  It was a pleasure to watch a group of people who lived together in the days when they really talked and listened to each other, with nary an electronic device to distract them.  When it was all over, I found  myself sighing and wishing I could watch it all again.  I felt like I knew and liked the characters and, most importantly, that they were real and interesting.

The first headmaster was a warm and delightful old gentleman. The next headmaster was the man who always fixed that which was not broken.  The love life of the young teacher, his children, his loss, his caring -- all made me feel what we have abandoned in modern education.  I loved this story so much I bought for my brother as a gift.

1977119,5,B00018WENW,"I have been riveted to this video series since I began watching. Wonderful characters and a resonant plot! The central character is a history teacher, and just as that discipline gives one much to reflect upon--so does this well-paced drama about a schoolmaster at an English public school in the inter war period. As the episodes unfolded, I found myself thinking deeply about the measure of words such as altruism, narcissism, feminism, class, charity, generosity of spirit and a a host of other ponderables, including the elusive meanings of the verb, ""to love.""
  The concluding episodes left me blubbering over what it means to live a ""life worth living""--a theme raised at the beginning of each episode as they all commence with the singing of the Bamfylde school song, ""Look Ahead to A Life Worth Living."" The series' over riding question for me? What is the cost of a life worth living?",1237680000,2,894,4.875
1977120,5,B00018WENW,"This BBC mini-series is beautifully filmed and written. The story based on the novel by RF Delderfield follows the career and personal life of a young Welshman who joins the staff of a boy's boarding school upon returning from the trenches of WWI. We meet David Powlett-Jones as a shell-shocked combat veteran and watch him develop into a first class educator and ultimately the school's headmaster. Along the way he meets both personal challenges and professional difficulties that drive the story and engage the viewer. John Duttine is absolutely brillant as Powlett-Jones and the supporting cast are almost uniformly excellent including the young actors who portray the students at the school.

This is a series to become absorbed in as it runs to almost 13 hours in all. The story unfolds gradually as the years pass and the banter between the old school teachers and their younger colleagues is witty and memorable.

Television rarely provides viewing of this quality.",1219708800,,973,5.113207547169812
1977121,5,B00018WENW,"First off, I'm one of those who enjoys any drama, American or foreign, that depicts teachers, academia, and even anything remotely to do with a school - ""The Paper Chase,"" ""Good Will Hunting,"" ""Diabolique,"" ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips,"" ""The Chorus,"" etc.  The 1980 production of ""To Serve Them All My Days"" remains one of my favorites.  I viewed this miniseries many years ago and recently with nothing new at hand, viewed it for the second time.  Despite already knowing the story, I've to say it hasn't lost its appeal for me at all.  It wasn't one of the more well-known British productions even back in the `80s and I think part of its appeal to me is that it looks like a homegrown production.  By that, I mean that it doesn't have the gloss or polish that later British productions, especially those by BBC, had.  It even looks like it was made on the cheap, but the story is powerful and quite moving.

The series is comprised of 13 episodes that span the years of 1918 to 1938 or thereabouts.  The story centers on a soldier, David Powlett-Jones (PJ), who's just returned from active duty during WWI.  He ends up teaching at a Devon boarding school called Bamfylde.  Coming from a coal-mining family in South Wales and ever conscious of the class differences, he tries to settle into his new life and devotes himself to the education and guidance of his boys.  As the decades go by, he finds purpose and meaning in the life he's chosen.  In between, he marries and suffers some tragedies that make him a better man in the long run.  It's a very lengthy story that I find difficult to synopsize (I've found sites that unfortunately provide too much of the plot).  Suffice to say that the miniseries is similar to ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips,"" but has a more pronounced political and social bent to it.  PJ is vocal about the backward thinking of his era and wants to move the school toward a more progressive future even it means displeasing those who'd rather cling to the status quo.

As is the norm with most British productions, the acting here is first-rate, especially John Duttine as PJ and Frank Middlemass as the very amiable headmaster, Algy Herries.  Lots of very interesting characters and each one well-defined, as well as a great many truly intelligent dialogues.  The political and social issues (socialism, miners' rights, bigotry) add meaning and depth to the story and not just there as window dressing.  This is definitely a worthwhile series whose themes of fairness, endurance, dedication, service to others, love and true knowledge will never lose their relevance.  It took many hours (approximately 12) to view it all, but they are some of the best hours I've spent.",1216512000,2,2681,4.724731182795699

1977123,5,B00018WENW,"Growing up in England and attending a catholic school the characters hit home for me. Different era perhaps, but attitudes and the personalities really came to life for me.
The story line is well docummented here, so I won't repeat it.
But what I can say is the actors do a fantastic job of bringing to life the type of characters I encountered as a child. And even nearly 3 decades after it was aired on PBS the story and atmosphere of the series is as sound now as it was back then. The main character of Powlett Jones carries the brunt of series so well that even if I dissagree with his politics, he's the type of person who I would love to spend time with. Not many portrayals on film can do that. He has such a wide gammit of emotions and conduct that make for compelling vewing. He's tormented by war, acutely get's the boys attention by a solid backbone and has a gentle and submissive personality when his family and love intrests come to play...And on top of that doesn't comprimise his values even at the most vunerable moments. Fantastic acting by the main character to portray so many different aspects and make it believable.
The other characters are just as engrossing. Wheteher you like or hate them they keep your attention(At least for me) Howarth and Carters interaction from two different out looks is both funny and entertaining.
The headmaster Herries is probably the most loveable and mature individual. Has a serious side, but hates to dwell on the negatives!
There are so many others who add to the drama, but all told this series crosses the border of so many up's and downs of one persons life in anusual setting of a boarding school of the early 20th century!
Great viewing and the characters are real and down to earth.",1195344000,2,1748,4.534810126582278
1977124,4,B00018WENW,"Here, Andrew Davies has less propitious material than he had, later, with his production of Pride and Prejudice, but he does a superb job with an academic/historical/slightly political/romantic novel and a limited budget.  The script is perfect, as is the acting.  The interplay of British academics in a public school (i.e. what Americans would call a private prep school) is so close to reality as to suggest that we are viewing a documentary.  The drama--with both romantic conflict and academic conflict--is muted but still very intense.  The governors/trustees of the school are a special treat.  After you watch the entire miniseries you will want to read the novel or check out plot summaries of it, since there are some changes between the book and the miniseries that will be of interest.

1977127,5,B00018WENW,"I saw ""To Serve Them All My Days"" when it was first broadcast on Masterpiece Theater and I have never forgotten the series, so I was very pleased to see that it was released on DVD.  The story has been nicely related by other reviewers so I will concentrate on the wonderful performances.  John Duttine is marvelous as David Powlett-Jones; his range and depth of emotion are perfectly portrayed in a role that must have been very demanding.  Frank Middlemass makes Algy Herries a beloved Headmaster; gregarious, open and unflappable but very serious when he has to be.  We are quite sorry when he ""retires"" as Headmaster but are glad that he does not entirely leave the story.  Neil Stacy is excellent as Carter, a character that I could loath and find some sympathy and understanding for.

The women in David Powlett-Jones' life are certainly fascinating and charming.  Belinda Lang was truly wonderful as his first wife, Beth.  She played the role with particular sweetness tempered by good humor and good sense; Kim Barden made quite a seductive Julia Derbyshire and Susan Jameson made a troubled would-be politician and lover for Powlett-Jones.

I recall that Alistair Cooke had warm praise for Charles Kay who turned in a perfect performance as Alcock, the icy Headmaster who succeeds Algy Herries.  Alan MacNaughton was a delight as Howarth, who may have had a bleak outlook on life but was a solid friend to David Powlett-Jones.

Having come from a military boarding school founded along the lines of English boarding schools by an Episcopal minister, it was easy for me to recall events from my own education and compare the teachers of Bamfylde with ones that I was taught by.  The series is so good because it is true to life and I would believe that R. F. Delderfield based his books on real people and events from his own experience.  This is an unforgettable series that is well-acted and holds your interest throughout its 13 parts.  Highly recommended.",1176336000,,1967,4.832835820895522

Hired to teach school at an elite boarding school, David finds himself mired in a culture he despises: that of the wealthy social elite. Soon however, David becomes enamored with the school and teaching and chooses to stay.

David's life is an interesting one, though at times some sub plots were more interesting to this viewer than others. David's persecution at the hands of the evil South African headmaster went on a little long. Likewise, I found his last romantic interest tedious. She seemed a selfish character who used David as a crutch. I found myself disliking her intensely.

Overall, I enjoyed the series and felt it could've benefited from a few more episodes. 4 stars.",1176163200,2,755,4.937007874015748
1977139,4,B00018WENW,"This is a story about a shell-shocked soldier, David Powlett-Jones who returns home from the First World War, and finds his healing and restoration while teaching at an English boarding school for boys called Bamfylde.  The story is derived from the novel by R. F. Delderfield with the same title as the film, To Serve Them All My Days.  It is a hopeful and encouraging story which sweeps across the years from the final days of the First World War to the approach of the Second World War. Many discouragements and even tragedy plague the years, but the general trend is upward and encouraging.

This is a film series that I had waited a long time to see.  I had read the book, To Serve Them All My Days twice, the second time just before seeing the film version.  By and large I thought the film version was quite well done. The adult characters are well developed as they are in Delderfield's writing.  Many of the individual schoolboy characters are slighted somewhat in the film, however.  The story flows well from episode to episode as it apparently was presented on television.

The DVD version is about eleven hours long on four DVDs.  In shorter films derived from written stories, one can understand leaving some significant things out.  I felt, however, that there were too many exclusions in the film version of To Serve Them All My Days which was plenty long enough to take into account important elements of Delderfield's original story.  In that sense I was quite disappointed.  I felt the film makers deleted too many of the stories about the individual schoolboys which give the written story reality and life.  Plus, the entire aspect of the story based on the survival and recovery of Powlett-Jones' young daughter, Grace, who in the book lives through the accident in which Powlett-Jones first wife and Grace's twin sister Joan were killed.  I use the word ""aspect"" because Grace figures very prominently through much of the story as Delderfield originally told it, partnering with her father from a very young age and aided in her recovery by two of the Bamfylde schoolboys in particular, and finally joining her father as a secretary.  When such a major aspect of a story is removed the story becomes something different.  A bit less of Powlett-Jones love life and common room discussions, and the inclusion of Grace's recovery, and more of the stories about the boys he served all his days would, in my opinion, have raised the film to a level of excellence.",1171670400,4,2481,4.761682242990654

1977141,5,B00018WENW,"I've had been looking out for this DVD, To Serve Them All My Days, ever since I read the book over two years ago.  I saw the miniseries on PBS Masterpiece Theatre back in the early eighties and didn't have the foresight then to tape them.  So after reading the book I searched and searched for the VCR tape or DVD, until last year when Amazon finally offered it.  Since then we have watched it at least 3 times, every 4 months or so, and find it as enjoyable each time around.  It's like visiting an old friend and it seems that you get something else new out it with each viewing.  We find ourselves immersed in the time, the culture, the values of the period, and the passion of the characters.  There are 13 episodes in all and although not as complete as the book or totally faithful, it captures the essence of the story wonderfully and adds another dimension.  The casting couldn't have been better (just as I would have envisioned them), and the acting is terrific.  The book and video complement each other superbly.  I highly recommend both to propel you into another warmer compassionate place, for whatever brief time, escaping the turmoil and superficiality of the present.  I'll leave the narrative to the other reviewers who have done a super job of detailing the story. Enjoy!!!",1149033600,8,1293,4.582608695652174
1977142,5,B00018WENW,"Finally on DVD, To Serve Them All My Days is a princely miniseries with a heart of gold. Veteran writer/producer Andrew Davies hit a home run out of the park with a magnificent adaptation of Delderfield's novel of England between wars. John Duttine dominates the series with his portrayal of David Powlett-Jones, in a subtle and winning performance, Frank Middlemass is supercharged as Headmaster Algie Herries, and Alan MacNaughtan rightly steals every scene he's in with a wry, eccentric brilliance. The performances from top to bottom are consistent and wonderfully rich. Delderfield's novel examines the futility of war with exacting subtlety, wisely and articulately focusing on the lives of youths destined for its relentless killing fields, and the adults whose experiences have harvested for them wisdom and courage. Thank God for that, there are few enough intelligent containers of truth in an age of perpetual war. This series could be recommended viewing for young American men and women facing daily the campus scourge of army recruiters and the jingoism of war-for-glory profiteers - I can't think of a better wakeup call. Story, setting, actors, and a first rate literary adaptation combine for an unforgettable experience. One of the best things about this film is the Bamfylde school song sung at the  beginning of each episode. Its hypnotic English hymn proportions draw you in each and every time, devotedly preparing you for a rewarding telling of an ageless story. To Serve Them All My Days is perfect filmmaking, and bountiful viewing. High-powered, five-star recommendation.",1142899200,7,1597,5.312252964426878
1977143,5,B00018WENW,"I spent the long weekend getting reacquainted with an old friend, so to speak. I got the boxed set of the wonderful miniseries, 'To Serve Them All My Days', based on the novel of the same name by R.F. Delderfield. I saw this first when I was barely a lad of sixteen or so, just at my school-leaving age and going off to university. I was amazed then at how much from 'before the war' remained true to form for school, and watching it again now twenty years later, it stands up to the test of time perfectly well (and I was once again amazed at the true-to-life nature of the whole enterprise). The series won the BAFTA award for the best television series of its year, and rightfully so.

The miniseries is done in thirteen parts, each just under an hour long, as a co-production of the BBC and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It was filmed in a real public school, Milton Abbey School in Dorset (not too far from part of the country where the mythical Bamfylde School resides), and many of the 'extras' in school shots are actually school boys of the Milton Abbey School. The settings didn't have to be changed too much to accommodate the inter-war period dcor, and of course the architecture for the most part was hundreds of years older.

However well done the sets and images are, this is still a teleplay about relationships and the coming of age, not just of the boys in the school, nor even of the lead character, Mr. Powlett-Jones, but really of the whole of society. The inter-war period in Britain was a fascinating time of societal development, particularly in terms of politics. Delderfield introduces this as an ever-present but never centre stage idea through the dealings of Powlett-Jones, son of a Welsh coal mining family, some of his out-of-school relationships, and the clash that this inevitably sets up with the privileged corps of boys at the school.

In the first episode, David Powlett-Jones has just returned from the trenches in the first world war, wounded both physically and spiritually. He is suspicious of the job offer at this upper-class bastion, but the gentle understanding of the headmaster, Algy Herries, encourages him to stay. His relationships with the other teachers are a fascinating study, particularly the gung-ho-warrior type Carter (whose not-always-disabled knee seems to have kept him out of the war) and the cynic-with-a-good-soul Howarth, who becomes Powlett-Jones' best friend over the course of their life together at Bamfylde.

Howarth chides Powlett-Jones at one point about the kind of monastic life that one can fall into at a remote school such as Bamfylde.

Howarth: Some men can live the celibate life. I don't fancy you're one of them.

David Powlett-Jones: What did *you* do about women all these years?

Howarth [pausing, smiling]: Your appetite for sordid revelations never ceases to astonish me.

Howarth reveals some of his indiscretions (remember, this is post-Victorian England, and the revelations, such as they are, would be considered exceedingly mild by television standards today). Powlett-Jones over the course of his twenty years at Bamfylde ends up with three primary loves; Beth, a young wife who dies early; Julia, someone not to be tied down to a school (or even the island of Britain), but keeps regular if long-separated contact with David over time; and Christine, the failed Labour candidate who becomes his second wife, taking on a role at the school as well, not the least of which is to remind the now-headmaster Powlett-Jones that there is a world outside the still-privileged halls of Bamfylde.

The teleplay is exceedingly well done, with the acting and the writing supporting each other in such a way to give real insight into the psychological make-up of the characters. John Duttine played David Powlett-Jones with a good amount of passion; however, I am torn between Frank Middlemass (as Herries) and Alan MacNaughtan (as Howarth) as to who my favourite actor is in the series. Both bring so much to their roles, and I can see myself in each of them in many ways more so than I can identify with Powlett-Jones. For the women, David's first wife Beth is played by Belinda Lang; Julia is played by Kim Braden (trekkies may recognise her from bit parts both in Star Trek film and series work); Susan Jameson plays Christine, David's second wife (fans of 'Coronation Street' may recognise her from that show). Each of the three is very well suited for their respective roles - Lang plays the young, optimist; Braden plays the worldly, ambitious but sensitive soul; Jameson plays the idealist who comes down to earth, managing to keep her ideals intact.

The play does a good job also of keep the boys from becoming a faceless, anonymous mass (a decided danger, given their uniformity in dress as well as age). There are particular boys who stand out, but one gets the sense from the watching that they are all individuals, and treated as such, both by the careful and caring headmasterly type Harries and Powlett-Jones, as well as the cynical Howarth (and even by the more scathing of the teachers, whose style is no longer in vogue).

The situations are credible, interesting, and instructive. The characters are fully formed and worthwhile. The production values are not to cinematic standards, but hold up very well over time (the lack of lavishness befits the nature of the school and the nature of the time as well).

This remains one of my favourite series of all time. The DVD has few extras, but among them are photographs, background information both on the school and on Delderfield, and the lyrics to the school song (which opens each episode, sung by the congregation of boys), by Kenyon Emrys-Roberts: 'Look ahead to a life worth living, Full of hope, full of faith, full of cheer,...'",1134432000,2,5795,4.872081218274111

Each of the three is very well suited for their respective roles - Lang plays the young, optimist; Braden plays the worldly, ambitious but sensitive soul; Jameson plays the idealist who comes down to earth, managing to keep her ideals intact.

The play does a good job also of keep the boys from becoming a faceless, anonymous mass (a decided danger, given their uniformity in dress as well as age).  There are particular boys who stand out, but one gets the sense from the watching that they are all individuals, and treated as such, both by the careful and caring headmasterly type Harries and Powlett-Jones, as well as the cynical Howarth (and even by the more scathing of the teachers, whose style is no longer in vogue).

The situations are credible, interesting, and instructive.  The characters are fully formed and worthwhile.  The production values are not to cinematic standards, but hold up very well over time (the lack of lavishness befits the nature of the school and the nature of the time as well).

This remains one of my favourite series of all time.  The DVD has few extras, but among them are photographs, background information both on the school and on Delderfield, and the lyrics to the school song (which opens each episode, sung by the congregation of boys), by Kenyon Emrys-Roberts: 'Look ahead to a life worth living, Full of hope, full of faith, full of cheer,...'",1133136000,18,5814,4.872081218274111
1977145,5,B00018WENW,"As someone who did not see the 1982 Masterpiece Theatre presentation, but saw the DVD only recently, I'd like to add my kudos to the rest. The beginning of the first episode was a bit slow, I thought, but it soon picks up and holds your attention. It does sound like it would be a bit dry, but it's not. We really care about the characters. David Powlett-Jones has his share of tragedy, but he gets through it without bitterness or resentment. I'm pleased to see so many other glowing reviews; this is indeed period drama at its best.",1127606400,,534,4.404040404040404
1977146,5,B00018WENW,"Most Teaching movies I avoid like the plague. The formula is way too predictable and insulting to me. This film on the other hand is not one of those.

 It is well written and has a very strong cast of actors that show the career of a British school teacher at one the elite ""Public"" read private and very expensive schools for the Upper Class/Establishment of England.

 I also like how the female actresses are allowed to be real persons not just part of the props. That and the idea of how a shell shocked soldier of WWI is allowed to gradually grow into becoming a first rate teacher. Altogether a strong and very up lifting film to behold!",1126137600,4,644,4.38655462184874

(2) Howarth's off-campus relationship would have also contributed to an understanding of the closeness of he and PJ. (3)The ceremony for the dog Towser, the hero of an early dorm fire, upon his death would have been charming.

1977167,5,B00018WENW,"Thanks to a suggestion from my friend Carol, I watched the videotapes of TO SERVE THEM ALL MY DAYS.  I can't say enough good things about this BBC production.

The story begins in England with David Powlett-Jones seeking employment as a teacher at an elite boarding school called Bamfylde.  A returning soldier, Powlett-Jones is a limping and a shell-shocked victim of the trench warfare of World War I. He's also depressed and feels he won't get the job since he's the son of a Welsh miner and has no previous background as a teacher. The headmaster, a terrific character, takes an immediate liking to the young man and Powlett-Jones is hired to teach history.

The story spans a twenty-year period where Powlett-Jones becomes an accomplished teacher, is admired by his students and gains the respect of his fellow teachers.  Early on, he finds a wonderful woman to love, but fate intervenes and his  life doesn't turn out the way he thought it would. This is not a Hollywood story! The characters are believable and all of the actors do a terrific job. The different personalities of the teachers and the brilliant way the headmaster handles all of the difficulties that the school faces makes this a film worth seeing.",1117324800,,1221,4.818181818181818
1977168,5,B00018WENW,"'To Serve Them All My Days' was published as a book in 1972, and made for telly in 1980. It is, to my knowledge, one of the first series that Andrew Davies wrote the screenplay for -- before going on to 'Very Peculiar Practice' and excellent adaptations of 'Vanity Fair' and 'Pride and Prejudice'. Apart from the last episode in this series, which is a bit of an anti-climax, he does a superb job throughout. The actors all put in career-best performances, which does have a down-side for John Duttine, in that he is still best-known for one of the very first things he did.

The potential problem for this series is that it immediately invites comparisons with two other productions. The first is 'Goodbye Mr Chips', which took Robert Donat through his earliest days as a teacher, his loss of his wife and baby, and eventual death in retirement at the school. The second is Michael Palin's first Ripping Yarn, 'Tomkinson's Schooldays', which was filmed at the same location (Milton Abbey School), only a few years earlier. It doesn't help that headmaster Herries is played by Frank Middlemass, who also played a wonderfully sadistic retired general in another Ripping Yarn.

But the plot is so good here, and the characterisation so well done and endearing, that the three works seem to enrich each other. Maybe it is because all are sympathetic to the English public school, despite Delderfield putting a socialist headmaster in charge of the senior school and his socialist wife in charge of the prep school. (I haven't read the book, but I assume that these details weren't added just to add piquancy, given that the first transmission was during the early Thatcher years.)

If you choose to buy this series in parts, then part three is the most dispensable. The plot loses a bit of momentum once the South African headmaster has died, and frankly the woman that Powlett-Jones chooses to pursue in part three isn't as desirable as the two previous women in his life. The plot becomes so predictable in part three that you half-hope Carter comes back on the scene to antagonise old PJ.

The nice little irony at the end is that it isn't necessarily PJ who serves the school all his days -- that honour goes to Howarth.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the extras are nothing to write home about: no commentary, no sub-titles or alternative languages, and glorious mono sound. The picture is occasionally jittery -- I assume because a few frames of film were damaged. The BBC would have done a better DVD production job, had they not sold the rights to AcornVideo, but we mustn't grumble.

I suspect this is a series you will want to view very swiftly -- perhaps even more than one episode a day if, like me, you have trouble restraining yourself. Depending on the size of your DVD collection, you probably won't watch it again more frequently than once every five years. But you'll really want to lend it to friends and family, just to hear their pleasure at seeing this marvellous series again.",1112832000,7,3001,4.739463601532567
1977169,5,B00018WENW,"Those who saw this 13-episode miniseries in 1984 or read the Delderfield book won't be disappointed in the adaptation, finally released on DVD.

  David Powlett-Jones, invalided from World War I by shell-shock and a leg injury, is encouraged to take up a career as a schoolmaster.  He is hired by the headmaster of a boys boarding school in Southwestern England, and under the gentle encouragement of that headmaster, Algy Herries, finds he has quite a knack for teaching.  His leftist (for their time) political views shake up the school, but he is quickly accepted.

  The series covers the period between near the end of World War I to the start of World War II, and in that rapidly changing world, we see David evolve and gain confidence in himself and what he believes in.  Perhaps this is best brought out in the relationships he has with three women, his first wife, Beth, who is tragically killed, Julia Derbyshire, with whom he has a romance, and his second wife, Christine, a would-be Labour politician.  All recognize his genius and encourage him, and it is with their help that he finds fulfillment.

  This was definitely a low budget affair (you see the same boys over and over again, even though over twenty years transpires!), with few outside scenes, and when the school catches on fire, the effects are minimal.  But it doesn't matter.  The acting is spectacular.  John Duttine is spectacular as David.  Frank Middlemass, who is probably the most familiar name to American audiences due to his part in ""As Time Goes By"", also excels as Herries.  Look for an excellent small part as the disciplinarian Cordwainer by longtime British character actor, John Welsh.  Again, though, the British showed their knack of putting together a large cast using actors, few of whom have been heard of beyond their shores.

  There are few extras on the DVDs.  A text biography of Delderfield, the lyrics to the Bamfylde school song (custom written, though it sounds like a hymn), an explanation that the school scenes were filmed using a school in Dorset, as well as the students there.  That's the sole disappointment.  Though the series was filmed cheaply, more extras on the DVD wouldn't have cost much.

Excellent.  Highly recommended.",1105488000,61,2242,4.8936170212765955
1977170,5,B00018WENW,"Like others who have commented here, I was quite taken with this mini-series when I saw it on PBS in 1984. Seeing that it had become available on DVD recently, I revisited it, wondering if my fond memories from 20 years ago would prove accurate or had taken on an unrealistic glow over time. Not to fear: I found the show's quality *surpassed* my memory of it. The series scarcely ever strikes a false note, and is bursting with poignant, funny, compelling and honest moments and characterizations.

The writing is very sharp, often surpassing the source material.  I read the book after my first viewing 20 years ago -- Andrew Davies' script really improves upon Delderfield's portraits of the women in David Powlett-Jones's life, especially Christine Forster.  I thought the direction was very strong as well, with pacing that moves along, yet lets us linger over important moments in ways that 21st century television rarely does.  But the acting trumps all -- what a remarkable cast, always note-perfect.

The story follows David Powlett-Jones, a shell-shocked veteran of WWI. As we learn in the first of 13 episodes, David was the youngest son of a Welsh coal-miner. Unlike his three older brothers, two of whom died in a mining accident along with their father, David was ""kept out of the pit"" to attend the local grammar school. At age 18, instead of heading to Oxford as planned, he was shipped to France, where he spent three years fighting in ""the Great War."" His arrival at Bamfylde school in what appears to be early 1918 is part of a recovery program prescribed by an army neurologist: a closed community in a rural setting to help mend both the physical and the mental wounds David endured in the war.

At first David is skeptical that someone of his limited formal education, working class roots, and Socialist political leanings really belongs at Bamfylde, a public school where the boys ""have an unconscious assumption of privilege."" But the gentle yet insistent persuasion of headmaster Algy Herries convinces him to give it a try. His first day in the classroom provides an immediate challenge as the schoolboys test his mettle. But despite David's outwardly shy and soft-spoken ways, he soon shows that he can be as tough as any situation demands.

The series follows the intertwining of David's personal and professional growth, and the recurring conflicts between these two facets of his life. Along the way, there are loves, friendships, triumphs, and tragedy. Through it all, John Duttine is a marvel of sensitive and compelling acting, as are many of his cast-mates.

Be forewarned that the series was produced in 1980 on videotape and with a limited budget (reportedly less than $2 million -- in comparison, ""The Blue and the Gray,"" a 1982 Civil War saga about 2/3 as long, cost between $16 and $18 million). Hence, the production often has the look of a filmed play, with few outdoor scenes and no special effects. But what it lacks in ""gloss,"" it more than makes up for in substance.

I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys quality drama.",1099008000,40,3079,4.8606870229007635
1977171,4,B00018WENW,"To Serve Them All My Days, really is a powerfully moving series and, like most film and television surrounding wars, speaks powerfully about its subject while keeping it firmly embedded in a tale appealing to those on either side of the fence.

The first episodes, depicting the young, limping shellshocked soldier David Powlett-Jones arriving at Bamfylde, and slowly making his way, growing stronger and forging bonds while earning respect with the students are powerful and moving.

If the later episodes involving romance, marriage and political machinations of the school system become a tad ""soap operatic"" - the same can be said of the best series today (The Sopranos, Dead Like Me, etc.) - and like those, the level of acting and commitment to the telling of the story at hand is impressive and never less than entertaining.

The cast is impressive, with affecting performances:  John Duttine captures every bit of nervousness and one cannot help but route for his Powlett-Jones.  Frank Middlemass and Patricia Lawrence as Algy and Ellie Herries are strong, sympathetic and make a formidable team. The brilliant Alan McNaughtan is amazing as Howarth keeping things from ever turning maudlin or saccharine and injects a beautifully jaundiced eye into the proceedings.

You can't go wrong with this set.",1098921600,9,1308,5.204761904761905
1977172,5,B00018WENW,"This one surpasses even Upstairs & Downstairs. Unfortunately the visual quality of the DVD is poor, as was U&D. It looked  better on a small screen tv rather than a 65 incher. A great shame when this is such a superbly acted series. I had never heard of any of the cast, one would have thought that they would have been academy award winners by now. Maybe this series was shown on PBS or A&E, but I missed out on it before.

This is British Public School as it should have been. I attended uppercrust British schools, and remembered characters as depicted in this series. I have to admit that I have not read the book, but was surprised that no boys were caned in the tv series when in fact beatings were a normal part of the British school day, and I cannot believe that in the early 20th century it was any different. I do not believe that the series would have been  better by dwelling on the negative aspects of British school life too much, but for the sake of authenticity it should have been acknowledged.

Apart from that I still give it 5 stars because of the quality of the acting.",1097971200,8,1091,4.307317073170732
1977173,5,B00018WENW,"After reading To Serve Them All My Days perhaps 20 years after its publication, I was convinced that I wanted to work with helping students as a volunteer, even if an opening as a teacher was not available--the book is that inspiring.  It is rivetting reading.
The DVD is beautifully produced, accurately preserving the main lines of the plot.  The film-characters fit the book-characters down to the ground--especially the headmaster (who, two decades later, portrays Lionell Hardcastle's father in As Time Goes By, looking hardly a year older).
The author, as I recall, reflects the popular politcal sympathy of his era (the very early 1970's), which may help account for the book's well-deserved success upon its publication. However, his hero's timeless advice to question popular academic culture (in the novel conservative) thus becomes unintentionally ironic--given today's much more liberal-leaning academic philosophy.

To Serve Them All My Days is Goodbye Mr. Chips (the plot of which it generally parallels) for the more community-and-politically involved--and is all the better for being so, regardless of one's political persuasion.  I do hope, now that it is available on DVD, that public broadcasting stations will begin showing it again.  It is truly a marvelous film.",1088121600,,1284,5.4

1977175,5,B00018WENW,"To Serve Them All My Days is a BBC production originally shown on Masterpiece Theater in the early 1980s.  I saw it then and admired the wonderful acting, the lovely settings, and the excellent story.  I am so glad it is finally available on DVD.
The story revolves around young David Powlett-Jones, a shell shocked and wounded veteran of World War I who is hired to teach history at Bamfylde School in the last days of the war.  David is from a Welsh coal mining family, and he has strong socialist convictions as well as a large chip on his shoulder about the priviledged youths and men he now finds himself among.  This is a subtext that runs throughout the series, but the primary story deals with David's growing self confidence and abilities. There is also a romantic subtext, with David being involved with three women, a wife who dies tragically, a brief fling with another woman, and finally a second wife who is both upper class and a Labour politician, thus combining the two disparate elements in David's life.
John Duttine is wonderful as the star of the series, but there is an excellent supporting cast led hy Frank Middlemass and Alan MacNaughton. Another nice aspect is the depiction of Bamfylde School itself, giving us Americans a pretty good idea of life in a British public school.",1086739200,95,1302,4.697368421052632

We're presently living in a golden age of lowbrow high budget soap operas and 3rd rate science fiction. The actual golden age of television was the British television of the 70s through the early 80s. In particular, the British literary miniseries. The age of I, Claudius. The age of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. The age of Brideshead Revisited. Even the sleazey stuff (The Cleopatras, or the Old Borgias) was substantially superior to any of the rubbish pumped into iphone-twiddling modern retinas. And lowbrow stuff like the Onedin Line or Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker era Dr. Who is significantly more charming than something like ""Madmen.""

It is indeed heartwarming, but it is also brutal at times; his ultimate fate was ... brutal. Dying in the Somme seemed like a better fate. But this is much like life.
