5689799,5,B00C3JULLY,"I'm telling you that this story is wonderful and it's got great characters that make you part of the story. Thrills, chills, love, and hatred, yeah, it has it all. I wouldn't say it is for someone who doesn't like a lot of blood and for someone who doesn't get scared easily, this isn't the scariest. But, hey, I've seen people jump at paranormal activity and I didn't find that movie scary either. Scarier than paranormal activity, kind of like the grudge, and with wonderful characters make sense like Higurashi. Do it up.",1375833600,,524,4.645161290322581
5689800,4,B00C3JULLY,"I watched this show earlier in the year and I must say, it's an eerie, gruesome mystery with intriguing characters and a good story line! All wrapped in 12 episodes! Which by the way, since this is only a 12 episode long show, I'm kind of put off by the price...why is it so pricey?",1375833600,2,282,4.1454545454545455
5689801,5,B00C3JULLY,This is horror and mystery at its best. It'll keep you at the edge of your seat and you won't want to stop till you have watched all 12 episodes. The main driving force of this anim is who is going to die next and what/who is behind it all. If the plot doesn't grab you the animation will. The animators of this show spared no expense and effort to make this show look gorgeous and it shows. You'll find yourself regularly pausing the show to admire the detail of the backgrounds and the scenes.,1374364800,,495,4.221052631578948
5689802,4,B00C3JULLY,"Another isn't entirely what you'd expect. A transfer student joins the mysterious class 3 of Yomiyama High School, and soon encounters a lot of weirdness. There is a mystery, a tragic history, a curse, and a strange odd girl that no one can see but him. He soon finds out that a chain of events has been set in motion that will cause a lot of carnage and death, and there seems to be no way to stop it...

The best way to describe it would be an anime take on the Final Destination horror films. In both, the actions of people tend to result in a lot of death and carnage by everyday things and invisible circumstances. Another embraces this and adds a mystery to it of why this is happening and how can we stop it? I can't really describe the plot as it twists, turns, and sometimes blatantly misdirects you to keep you unsettled. It's quite good for anime horror, and escapes a lot of the traditional Japanese horror tropes into a more Western sensibility. There are even references to writers like John Saul and the movie the Omen.

Like Final Destination, it's also pretty gory. Some of the deaths are brutal, and extended for shock impact, while others are brief and startling. It's winds up being less gratuitous in a way because the deaths are so unexpected, and to people you actually care about, that it is less about what cool gore scene they could include, and more about shocking you and reminding you the curse is not something cozy or benign. You also see the aftermath of the deaths, too, and your heart goes out to the poor people surviving.

It's good, but there are some minor issues. The ending to me didn't really seem to be as justified as it was. Without spoilers, the most pertinent parts of why it ended the way it did were revealed at the ending and only some things were foreshadowed well. Also, the misdirection changes the story in the way you don't expect, and you may get one idea of how things are and not like the actual explanations.

The whole series is streaming on Crunchyroll, but I plan to buy the blu-ray when released. It's a different take on anime horror that is quite good, and worth a spot in your collection if you like that genre.",1366502400,8,2176,4.4325
5689803,3,B00C3JULLY,"When I started watching Another, I was intrigued by it.  The story is essentially that in one particular classroom, year after year a bunch of the students die.  The mood of the story is very well done, and I liked the two main characters a lot.  The visuals in Another are also quite appealing.  If you are a fan of gore, there are some pretty unique death scenes.  But after it was all said and done, the story really just didn't develop well...

As the story begins, you wonder why do students in this class die.  But then the reason doesn't turn out to be very elaborate; it's kind of a let down...  There's good chemistry between the two lead characters, but nothing ever comes of it.  The ending had a bit of surprise, but most of it was pretty predicable...

There's nothing psychological at all in the show. If you want to see gore as a result of a tormented mind or strange twist of fate like in Elfen Lied, Deadman Wonderland, or Future Diary, you will not find it here.

I won't say that I didn't like Another, because as I was watching it I enjoyed it.  But looking back on the series after it was over, it just seemed empty.  If you like random gore, then by all means, watch it.  If you want there to be some reason behind the madness, or really even much of a storyline, you'll probably come out a bit disappointed.",1366329600,14,1330,4.289156626506024
5689804,5,B00C3JULLY,"K'ichi Sasakibara has recently transferred to a new school. His class has a strange atmosphere, and it gets even stranger after he meets an odd, but pretty girl named Mei Misaki. Then he learns of a horrifying story that started 26 years ago, when a popular student named Misaki died...

Another is one of those horror stories that is horrific, but not really scary. The deaths were surprisingly graphic, but other then that it was fairly mild. The atmosphere is well done, the story fast paced, and the characters engaging enough to propel the story. I really enjoyed watching this series, as it is exactly the kind of horror show I enjoy. Creepy, but you'll have no trouble sleeping at night. If you enjoy shows like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shiki/dp/B007BMIGRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shiki</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Umineko/dp/B008RL7B6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Umineko</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-They-Cry/dp/B00358MG7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When They Cry</a>&nbsp;(Higurashi), then you should give Another a try.

Another is based on the novel by Yukito Ayatsuji. It is 12 episodes long and aired January through March of 2012. It is available streaming on Crunchyroll, if you want to give it a try before purchasing.
The DVD set includes clean opening and endings as well as a special on the series (which I haven't seen yet). Audio is available in both Japanese and English, but I've only seen it in Japanese so far, so can't remark on the English dub. The Japanese was good though.",1365120000,40,1660,6.150862068965517

Considering how much i love this series buying the complete collection was a must. It comes with no art or flashy case, just a regular bland dvd case. This set includes everything youll need. If you have not yet seen this i highly suggest you do but i must point out the english Dubbed is a bit cringy, mainly Misaki Mei but i really do like the voice actor for the main character",1498435200,,597,4.155172413793103

5689870,5,B00C3JULLY,"This was not at all what I expected. Based on reviews by others I anticipated a show that would give me nightmares and goose bumps. However I was delightfully surprised to find myself at the edge of my seat playing guessing games and asking my TV questions like, ""is she?"", ""is it him?"", ""is this but a dream and his subconscious sharing itself subjectively based on an experience before death? What is going on!?"". No doubt I was losing sleep trying to complete the series to find my answers. The level of detail and thought put into the environments and shadows is well done and impressive. Obviously the artists took thier time and we're not lazy. The level of animation compliments the story so well that even as an animated series it's very immersive.

26 years ago, in a third-year classroom of a middle school, there was a student named Misaki. As an honors student who was also good at sports, she was popular with her classmates. When she suddenly died, her classmates decided to carry on as if she was still alive until graduation. Then, in the spring of 1998, a boy named Sakakibara Kouichi transfers to the class, and he grows suspicious of the fearful atmosphere in that classroom.

5689915,4,B00C3JULLY,That sh*t escalated quickly. This anime is a must watch for anyone who enjoys final destination type horror movies. The first 3 episodes are a little slow but after that (and since there are only 12 episodes) things get crazy fast. Its gory to say the least so please be prepared for that. The story is compelling and I didn't see that ending coming. The characters are interesting and you want to get to know more about them but a lot is left to your imagination in this anime; which is a good thing. Defiantly gets your mind racing. For the price I think its a decent watch that can be finished in a weekend. I would say its most like Future Diary only the whole plot smashed into 12 episodes.,1443571200,,695,4.312977099236641

Do NOT pass them up, should you be into this genre. I loved this Anime, & will always watch it over & over again for years to come.

5689957,5,B00C3JULLY,"This anime does a lot of things right. It's cool how a lot of little details from early on reveal their significance towards the end. There's a really nice unity and cohesion to the story.

And it's a pretty complicated story for an anime, with lots of little parts that all have to fit together and make sense in the end, and they basically nailed that, which I really enjoyed.

It's one of those stories where you can think about it afterwards and go, ""Oh yeah, now I see why so-and-so said that thing in episode 2.""

I'd say it's worth a watch.

Unfortunately, the ending is terrible. At least it's a proper ending that resolves the story. They don't commit the unforgivable crime of slapping on a non-ending that makes no sense. But the cool, dark, intense vibe that they did such a great job of building over 10 or 11 episodes just disintegrates and it turns into a bunch of dopey mayhem with (as others have noted) people doing stuff that doesn't really make sense.

I'm deliberately being vague here, because I don't want to spoil it, but it's like the IQ of the show drops by 20 points right around episode 11.

Anyway, I'd say it's still worth a watch. You know, I'd almost say watch up through episode 10, then stop and read how it ends online or read the novel so the awful last two episodes don't ruin it for you.",1426032000,,1325,4.365853658536586

5689959,5,B00C3JULLY,"One of the best horror anime I have ever seen! It starts off sweet and innocent enough. Some kids at a high school have figured out an evil curse has been placed upon them and that they must kill the one of whom the curse rests. At first the curse isn't taken too seriously because for the most part it seems like a bad joke. But the curse is indeed terrible...as long as the person lives horrible deaths are in store for close friends and next of kin. Eventually after many grizzly and untimely deaths the students begin killing one another in a frenzy to find the one of whom the curse is placed in an insane attempt to keep the curse from subjecting them to a horrible death.

The entire series is amazing! Taking cutesy anime boys and girls and subjecting them to some of the most horrifying deaths to ever be drawn is quite awesome! It ranges from a clumsy girl slipping on water and becoming impaled on an umbrella to a teacher knifing himself to death, even a young kid becoming reduced to tiny bits of skin blood and bones when an elevator shaft malfunctions! Oh, and let's not forget the park gear on a truck towing a heavy mechanical shovel suddenly going in reverse! It smashes a young kid to death as well!

The characters and plot are very well thought out and the audio is quite suspenseful It's an Anime Alfred Hitchcock would be proud of because it's so good and giving you the suspense, the fear of the unknown, suddenly luring the watcher into a false sense of security and then BLAM! A character you have grown to admire is suddenly killed in horrific bloody fashion!

5689975,5,B00C3JULLY,"(Like what I did there above? I thought it was pretty cheeky but that's not the point) So let me get this out the way real quick. When I was a kid, I first encountered anime in the form of Dragonball Z and Sailor Moon. Then later found Inuyasha, then discovered the vast majority of anime OUTSIDE OF WHAT'S ON TV and now in my 20's, I'm exploring those genres. This year was most definitely a horror genre year with my purchases of Attack on Titan, Future Diary, Shiki, streaming Higurashi; When They Cry, and now here's Another. (Oops I did it again.)

So the anime set up is similar to Higurashi in that the character designs are cute so the last thing you think of visually are these characters dying brutally, violent deaths. The plot in my opinion somewhat remains vague throughout the entire show which basically is that the 9th grade class C is haunted by some sort of deathly entity and the protagonist Koichi sets the events in motion after his encounter with the mysterious Mei Misaki.

One of the great points of this anime is that it puts you in one direction of thinking and changes it completely within a matter of episodes. I'd explain what I mean, but even that is a spoiler. After episode 3, the plot thickens and students are fighting to stay alive. Although the series is short, everything up to the last episode is very significant and even the potential filler episode isn't even filler after awhile.

I highly recommend this anime simply because it keeps you on the edge, trying to anticipate and guess what will happen next even if there's some questions at the end of the anime that don't seem to reach an answer. If you're a fan of the horror genre, add Another to your collection. I also recommend Future Diary as well.",1419379200,,1745,4.515822784810126

It really kept me on the edge of my seat with each episode giving you the impression of giving you further indications as to who is responsible, only to wait until the very last minutes of the show to reveal everything in such a manner than concludes the story perfectly.

To any murder mystery fans out there, there is nothing out there that I've seen quite like it and I seriously enjoyed watching it.

If I may make a recommendation however, I'd try watching it in japanese with the subtitles on. I'm usually a fan of dubbed anime, but in this case, I found that the overdub made the characters sound like 9 year olds, while the japanese audio made them sound more like their own age.",1406505600,,935,4.398843930635838
5690039,5,B00C3JULLY,"Intro:
This is not a happy fairy-tale. Let's begin with that, Another is a dark anime. It has a cool aesthetic, soundtrack, and avoids many of the tropes that modern anime series' have fallen into. This series contains 12 episodes and the OVA.

Animation: 4.5/5
This is a gorgeous anime, the characters are all animated fluidly and the deaths are gruesome and realistic. The eye-catches in between scenes is pretty creepy (porcelain dolls are not my friends). The entire city is rusty, dark, and generally unclean which helps add to the atmosphere. Even the rails on top of the hospital are rusty and somehow frightening. Only complaint here is the occasional CG use, which anime fans should be accustomed to at this point.

Sound: 5/5
I watched both the Japanese and English versions and I am happy to report that they are both fantastic. Neither one of them suffers from annoying/whiny voice acting and this is actually some of the best work the English VA's have done. The music is appropriately creepy and unsettling, and the opening theme is very catchy.

Story: 5/5
The best way I can describe the story without too many spoilers is Final Destination meets Battlestar Galactica (any BG fan will understand it's not the Sci-fi portion I'm referencing). It is a mystery that kept me guessing right up until the very end, and I am usually pretty good at guessing where plots will go. The twists and turns were all alluded to throughout the series, so there are no bogus ""we made a twist just because we could"" moments that many mystery stories like to do.

Overall 5/5
If you are a fan of anime, and/or a fan of horror in general, you owe it to yourself to give this anime a go. Well worth the price, in my opinion.",1406505600,17,1718,4.622950819672131
5690040,5,B00C3JULLY,"This is a great anime! To me it is like the anime version of the Final Destination movies, someone in the show is going to die, You don't know who, don't know when, don't know how but the one thing I do know is that if you buy and watch this series you will never be disapointed. Its amazing! the story is intense at times, not many laughs to break it up, its mostly a thriller horror 98% of the time.",1404950400,,401,3.962962962962963

5690042,5,B00C3JULLY,"This is one of those 'cartoons' only the Japanese can produce. Yes it is a 'cartoon' but no, it isn't bright, fluffy and happy. O Gawd, is it not bright, fluffy and happy.

But very, very satisfying.

Not to delve too deeply into the story, this is basically a curse/ghost story. A particular class in a Japanese school is cursed, one of the class members  is a ghost, but you can't tell by touching or talking to them. And, if this ghost isn't outed - identified and killed - someone or someones in the class will die.

The suspense builds very well in a properly paced fashion, you are kept guessing until well into the last episode. While I can't say the reactions of the people in the series is actually representative of actual Japanese, these reactions do reflect what is also out there in anime and Japanese popular literature (read: manga and light novels). The artwork is properly noir-ish for this indeed is a very noir series.

In one respect viewing is not very repeatable; one you know the hook you know the hook and the suspense goes away. But the series is suitable for repeat viewing if only to soak in the atmosphere and the depth of the art - the voice acting and animation and music. The characters are memorable in action if not in name, the story is VERY memorable in toto. I personally count this as one of my favorite suspense-terror works. Recommended.

Generally all the horror anime I watch are nothing but  excessive violence and seem to only promote shock value as a way of luring in an audience. This anime did everything right. From the music, the atmosphere, the character and the art style everything is brought together. From the first moment you watch you are drawn in. The intro seems to explain the theme of the story well. From the minute you start watching it seems mysterious and enticing. This did have a similar story-line to Final destination but its a little different.

That is the question everyone is asking in Another, and the question you will be asking yourself through the majority of the show as well.  Another manages to blend horror and suspense with overall excellent story line and plot, and the results are highly enjoyable.  The supernatural element is particularly compelling, as there is no sinister intelligence at work in the town--merely an odd hiccup in the laws of nature.  In some ways, this show reminded me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Leaves/dp/0375703764/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Leaves</a>, which is a very good thing.

I like some terrible shows and I hate some really well-done shows. I recognize the difference between enjoyment and quality. This is both highly enjoyable (if you like suspense-horror stories) and high quality.

Another is a great anime. The music is pretty good, if not super memorable. The characters are really well developed for such a short series.

The animation style really tickles me. While the drawing of the characters is pretty standard, the details of the settings are some of the best I've seen in any animation. The choices of lighting and shadow, moss on cobblestones, rust on wrought-iron fences, and other little details add to the atmosphere of the show so well. There was a lot of attention to detail put into this show.

And the story is great. I believe that art exists to convey emotion - even if that emotion is negative. A horror movie that succeeds in scaring the audience is a good piece of art. I am a grown man who does not scare easily and this show - even though it was animated - managed to creep me out slightly when watching alone late at night. That might not sound like much, but it is very, very rare for me so I found it impressive. The twists and turns kept me guessing - and then reevaluating my guesses.

The anime is a must have for horror anime fans. It's horror however there is also alot of deep emotion in it, and some things are not as they seem.

It's always smart to keep an open mind in this anime as well since its not predictable at all and never fails to shock you. I will say its not for children and not for people who can't handle gore. I'd say Elfen Lied fans would really enjoy this due to the gore and horror theme. However its not ALL horror, there are some parts that can bring tears.

5690103,3,B00C3JULLY,"Another is a very odd series.  While the plot reads like an anime version of Final Destination, the final product is very addictive, yet fairly flawed series.

Instead of recapping the plot, which is perfectly summarized on this page already, lets focus on what the show does right.  The story, while confusing at times, is instantly entertaining.  The perfectly crafted mood and tone draw the viewer in, and then constant, hovering doom keep the show moving along.  Very rarely does the story play it safe, with pretty much all characters at risk of falling victim to class 3-3's curse.  The art enhances the mood, building a word drenched in shadows, cool colors and a hazy, almost sunset glow that settles over everything.  The pace, at least in the earlier episodes, is deliberate.  It takes time to establish mood and character.

Character is another area where the show stands out. While the cast is VERY large, and focus can be pulled all over the place, the characters are very enjoyable to watch.  Note I didn't say ""watch die"".  These kids are good group of normal teenagers who are stuck in a horrific situation.  You feel bad for them, and you don't really want to see them die, but die they do.  This show is brutal in dispatching it's cast.  The death scenes are shocking and well animated.

While the show does a lot right, it also has some pretty obvious flaws.  First and foremost is the occasional CGI employed.  In some scenes it is hardly an issue, but in others it looks horrid.  The worst is a scene set at the beach, with the ocean animated with CGI.  It looks like something from an original Playstation game, and completely pulls the viewer out of the scene.  Also, because of the large cast, and the more realistic character designs, characters can be hard to tell apart, with only slight differences in hair style being the only way to separate one character from the other.  The other glaring problem is the way the story is compressed in the later half of the series.  For the first half the pace of the show is slow, taking it's time to establish character and setting.  The second half (a good marker is the beach episode) is much faster paced, with characters getting bumped off left and right.  The issue is that some of these characters are discussed as if the audience should already know who they are, and yet we have had zero exposure to them until their death scene.  It kills the impact and can cause the story to feel choppy and under developed.  The other major issue is in the final three episodes.  While the tension is high, the pace fast and the action non-stop and violent, some of the character's reactions and choices seem rather odd (like characters constantly running back into a burning building, or another character seeming to brush off a rather brutal death.

Overall this series is very entertaining.  All of it's flaws do not get in the way of the viewer getting sucked into the twisting and turning story, or the over the top violent deaths.  The writers also, wisely, inject some levity into the series at times, allowing us to be reminded that these characters are kids.  For horror fans this is a must watch series.  For everyone else, it depends on your own personal taste, and ability to handle a show that can feel very uneven at times.

I can't really rate horror based on thrills, chills, as it really doesn't scare me, though I startle, same as most people, when that tactic is used.  To me many things whether horror genre or not, can be ""horrific"", but I'm just not equipped to rate whether you'll need to sleep with the lights on.",1381449600,,530,4.655913978494624
5690108,5,B00C3JULLY,"Anime horror mysteries are pretty rare in general, but when they appear, are they any good? Another is an anime that is definitely worth the time of any viewer who likes horror aspects in their stories. This title explores a middle school and the unusual happenings of one particular class. A class that seems to have a ghost for a student.

The main character transfers into this new class without being aware of the ghost stories and the class regulations. After a short while, people in the town start dying very gruesomely. The pacing is kind of slow for most of the story, but is was all done for the sake of building up the horror, suspense, and the mystery of trying to stop the rash of deaths in the town. Its kind of like Final Destination mixed with the Sixth Sense.

The character designs in this anime are very well done; they look rather cute, which is all the more upsetting when some of the characters are killed off. In fact, this show has more in common with the anime series Higurashi than any other show. The music is also very good too, and certainly sets the mood when it comes to creeping out the viewer. The opening theme song is done by Ali Project, who also did the music for Code Geass and Rozen Maiden, which is always a plus.

Probably the reason many people watch the series is because of the character, Mei Misaki, the eye patched girl on the cover. Trying to find out who she is and her story are top priorities when the viewer is introduced to her. She is very pale looking and is very quiet. Its almost like she doesn't belong in the class at all. She is acquainted with the main character early in the series, but everyone seems to be against this, or they seem to ignore her completely.

It is worth noting that this series can be very bloody at times, so it is not for the faint of heart. The final two episodes are insane and hectic, and definitely for those that enjoy anime violence. Also, this show has probably the best plot twist in an anime during the final episode. Notably this anime is done by PA Works, who also worked on Angel Beats and Canaan; both of which are very good anime.

This collection is distributed by Sentai Filmworks, and it is very good. Strangely enough, the DVD release has 3 discs with 4 episodes each. I am not sure why they did not put 6 episodes on two discs like other releases. There is a feature included called ""Another Special,"" which is a music video featuring a very cute chibi version of Mei. The English dub is very good this time; Mei sounds stoic, but also very intimidatingly scary, and also empathetic when needed. All in all, check this title out.",1381017600,,2631,4.405349794238683

5690110,5,B00C3JULLY,"From the opening scene, to the final moment Another keeps you at the edge of your seat.
It begins with a ghost story. A harmless tribute to a dead classmate that leads to the start of a terrifying curse. Another does not skimp on the gore, but it doesn't use it as a crutch either to paint itself as a horror story. It's beautiful writing and gripping plot take care of that. Another draws you in and takes your breath away. Once you start watching, you won't want to stop. As one by one people begin to die in mysterious accidents, it quickly becomes clear that no one is safe. As the story builds into a final horrifying crescendo of madness and despair. And a truth unfolds, more terrifying than you could possibly imagine. Another is horror at its finest, and will stay with you long after you've finished watching.",1377648000,2,819,4.466666666666667
5690111,5,B00C3JULLY,"Imagine Final Destination, but better.  This anime is how horror should be done, not just using gory deaths but having a very creepy setting with a mysterious story that should provide a satisfying conclusion.",1376870400,8,209,5.147058823529412
5690112,5,B00C3JULLY,"A sweet story, the dolls were a little creepy but added a air of horror to it besides the endless blood bath of students.

8577056,3,B00C3JULLY,"Another shares the same difficulty of so many horror stories; it is aimed at two completely separate audiences: horror fans and the rest of us.  A truly great horror story can please both; a lesser horror story can please one at the expense of the other; an awful horror story will please neither.  IMHO Another is somewhere in the middle.

First, let me be clear; I am NOT a horror fan.  Nothing wrong with being one, but I am not, and the idea of meeting a bunch of interesting characters, getting to know them, getting to like them, then watching most of them die in horribly gruesome ways doesnt appeal all that much to me.  If it does appeal to you, then youd better read some other reviews because chances are we will not entirely agree, but hopefully my review will neither offend nor bore you and hopefully it will be a bit more useful to the rest of us.

To start with, I absolutely loved this series in the beginning: the gorgeous, creepy looking animation, the marvelous, creepy sounding music; heck, I even liked the bolting opening song that I noticed so many more experienced critics disliking though that might be because I haven't heard any of the allegedly similar songs Ive seen reference to.  Without much experience in horror anime I was fascinated by the creepy set up and for the first several episodes shared with main character Kouichi Sakaibara the growing unease and skant knowledge about just what in the world is going on regarding this creepy class in this creepy school.  The initial deaths were shocking and the tragedies strangely moving; I was compelled to watch the 12 episodes straight through in a single sitting

The problems came when I began thinking about what I had just seen.

First, I never noticed the Big Secret revealed at the end along with the Big Twist, needing to have it pointed out to me by experts, and while being admittedly totally surprised by it, I didn't find it nearly as significant as the latter,... probably because after the librarian mentioned that over the last 10 years Counter Measures had about a fifty percent success rate, I simply assumed they didn't know as much as they thought they did.

For me the big problems started with the revelation, annoyingly delayed by a series of in-your-face accidents, of the solution that worked 15 years ago.  Really?  Wow, that was really stupid!  I mean, you couldn't screw up and implement that improperly,... unless you count at least HALF of the deaths in the two episode climax!  I don't really care how carefully explained it was (and it was carefully explained to me); IMHO it rates no better than a good-to-know to be considered and filed away while you try something else.

Therefore, it was with even greater annoyance that I regarded the revelation that there actually was a BETTER way to solve the problem, a better way that could arguably have prevented most or even all of the deaths if either events hadnt conspired together so hard to prevent it

or if somebody involved had only possessed a three digit IQ....  Even with the annoying tendency for curse-related memory loss, Im thinking that the CD being put up to replace the cassette tape at the end should include instructions to make a phone call!

If you are a horror expert, you may disagree and might even have a list to detail your disagreement with me, and thats fine, but if you are not, be ye warned.  Another starts brilliantly but ends with you (well, me at least) rooting for the Curse.

Note: For reasons unclear the OVA episode 0 is not included in this set, but you can find it online.  Although it is set before the series, for the first time through I would recommend watching it after watching the series because it reveals a few secrets too soon.",1527465600,,3740,4.6433990895295905

8577059,4,B00C3JULLY,"There are some things here that should NOT happen on a Blu-ray release. First there is a super annoying add at the very begging that not only insults the viewer (great way to make sure I never look at their site) but also looks like it was made very cheaply by a 12 year old.

Also the English subtitles are in bright highlighter Yellow with no option to change to color to say white with a black outline? Or even just plain white? Thank goodness I have a PS4 and thus the option to turn off the subs and watch it in Japanese without them. Who pays to watch show on Blu ray only to have obnoxious bright yellow subtitles on the bottom of the screen?

Lastly if you read the description on the back of the package it says they are in High School which is false, they are in their last year of Middle School, clearly the person(s) who put this together did not care at all nor did they watch the series.

Like I said I really like the anime, that's why I wanted the Blu-ray of it seeing as I also have a crunchy roll sub and could just watch it there, but Sentai really needs to get their act together.",1516060800,,1100,4.1069767441860465

8577061,3,B00C3JULLY,"The 1st 4 episodes are probably the best, it goes down hill from there, entertainment wise. Its not as hyped up as it seems, its very similar to those lame final destination movies.",1508198400,,181,4.515151515151516
8577062,4,B00C3JULLY,"This was a pretty great horror anime, with some interesting twists throughout, with some that stretched believability towards the end.

It is relatively gory, without some of the mind bending elements of other, more mature and imaginative horror animes.

8577064,5,B00C3JULLY,"Another is easily my favorite horror anime. It's set in a small town and follows the protagonist, a teenage boy, who just moved to the town only to be placed in cursed class three.

Uncover the mysteries of the town and the class curse as chilling encounters and horrific events follow through the semester.

With a cast of likeable characters, some more intetesting than others, great art, and a nearly flawless atmosphere Another proves that Anime can be a perfect medium for the horror genre.

That said this bluray was my first time hearing the dub, and although it took me a bit to adjust i can firmly say it does a atisfying job.",1503187200,,635,4.552631578947368
8577065,5,B00C3JULLY,"This is one of my favorite horror animes. It's not only got gore, but it also keeps you guessing the entire way through. Even when you find out what's going on in the show, you still never know who's going to die next, or how. I think they found very creative ways to kill off the characters, and no matter how many times I watch it, I still cringe every time someone dies. I am only disappointed that there are only 12 episodes. By the time it's over, I'm just left wanting more and more.

The art is not only GORGEOUS, but also flawless. You know how most animes will have a few panels of bad art, or miscoloring in some spots? That doesn't exist in this anime. Every drawing was carefully drawn and inspected before being used. It really shows how much care the artists put into the show. The music also does a great job at keeping the creepy tone going the whole time.

I've watched the show 3 times now, twice in Japanese, once in English. The Japanese acting was definitely better, and the English had its weak moments at times. However, they're both very good and enjoyable, so if you don't like subtitles, you will still have a good experience. The characters are all wonderful and unique, and the actors do a good job of portraying the characters and their emotions in both languages. All the actors were great when performing their death scenes and such, which is really the most important thing in good horror acting. It is definitely worth it to buy this series on blu-ray. The art begs to be watched in proper HD. You will be doing yourself a favor.

As far as the gore factor, it can be brutal, but it is actually done quite tastefully. The gore isn't shown too harshly, or for too long, but it's definitely enough to make an impression. Once you've seen it before, you might start cringing at some of the scenes before things even happen, like when they show a quick scene of an elevator. The story is so fantastic, each time I watch it again, I enjoy it wholeheartedly, even though I already know the story while the character is running around trying to figure out what's going on. The last few episodes get wild, so enjoy the ride.

As far as the packaging, it is beautiful, although there is no art on the inside case. The ""Another Special"" that is included in the Special Features is garbage, though. It's a boring music video with nothing but chibi art of Mei. So just pretend that doesn't exist.

If you're a Horror Lover, definitely buy this one!! You'll definitely watch it through at least two times.",1502064000,4,2525,4.456709956709957
