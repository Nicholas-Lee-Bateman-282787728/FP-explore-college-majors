8524817,4,B0083UXROA,"Being a longtime attendee of ""country"" and ""estate"" auctions in Eastern Pennsylvania (especially in Lancaster and Berks County, where more such auctions take place), I was particularly interested in seeing this new film. It was filmed in these two counties and concentrates - mostly - on the Zettlemoyer Auction Company outside of Allentown, PA where the three generations of Zettlemoyer men are still going strong with weekly (sometimes more) auctions. There are other area auctioneers featured but the Zettlemoyers seem to get most of the screen time.

With all the interest in ""what is stuff worth?"" reality TV shows (Antiques Roadshow, Pawn Stars, Storage Wars, etc), this DVD release is very timely. And, if you like those reality shows, you'll probably enjoy this. I will warn you that the director has a habit of not carrying the filming of the auctioning of a unique item to the conclusion so that you will hear what it went for. This is particularly annoying in the coverage of the huge handmade quilts at the Kutztown Folk Festival. You hear the auctioneer start a quilt at $3,000, then drop it to $1,000 and you'll hear it go up to $2,500 and - suddenly - the Director cuts to another auction!

If you attend a lot of auctions, like I do, you'll learn some new things, especially during the all-too-short section where we follow the auction company as they visit a farm owned by three sisters, which was in the family for three generations, to evaluate if there is enough farm machinery and household goods there to make it worthwhile to take the goods on consignment.

We also hear from those who attend auctions and why they go and what they look for.

Near the end of this 89-minute film we get to see both a produce auction and a livestock auction. (The Zettlemoyers handle all kinds.).

While I did like the film, I though it dragged on - and became repetitive - in parts and probably have been just as interesting - maybe more - in an hour, rather than 89 minutes. But I'm glad I watched it.

The DVD has a few short bonus features:

1. Auctioneer gives us a few tongue twisters - 0:41
2. A few auctioneers describe the history of auctioneering and the auction schools. (Auctioneers are licensed by the State) - 5:00
3. ""Confessions of A Bid Calling Champion"" (the senior Zettlemoyer on winning his prize - 2:39
4. A Tractor Parade - mostly the complete sale of one tractor and a few other oldies - 1:13
5. There is a .pdf file included that - if inserted in your PC - you can print out ""practice drills""

So, again, I'd recommended this if you like those reality shows. I did like seeing it.

I hope this review is both informative and helpful.
