Made in 2007 this documentary is now making its way to blu-ray via Synapse. Thank goodness they made the decision to do so, adding several special items that will please fans of the film and those who made it.

As we learn via interview with director George Romero Warner Brothers contacted him after the success of his film MARTIN concerning a vampire in modern society. They had just acquired the rights to SALEMS LOT and wanted him to meet with author Stephen King about making a film adaptation. The two met, became fast friends and while the studio changed their plans about that film the pair later found something else to work together on. That was the 1982 film CREEPSHOW.

Fans of the old EC Comic books that were banned at one time and credited with creating subversive attitudes in teens, they came up with an anthology film that combined those old styled stories with modern movie technology. Rather than use the old comic titles they came up with their own comic called Creepshow. Instead of the Crypt Keeper they had The Creep. But the stories they told in this film would have fit perfectly in those old comics.

This documentary takes a look at their efforts moving from how they came up with the idea to the cast to the special effects to the music and so on. Each step of the way is an interesting look at just how a movie gets made and in this case outside of the studio system. Thats because whole Warner Brothers eventually distributed the film it was indeed an independent film to begin with. Made on a shoestring budget for the project it was every penny spent on this film shows up on screen. That only made it better.

Interviews in the film range from various cast members including Ed Harris and Adrienne Barbeau to effect supervisor Tom Savini to Romero himself. All of them offer anecdotes about the making of the film and from the things they discuss it sounds like they had far more fun than they should have. The entire team seems to have bonded, everyone from grips to well-known actors who had been in loftier roles but found that there was something special in this film, that it was more than just a cheap horror flick. It was a homage to those great comics that came long ago. For myself I think that this film was an inspiration for the later HBO series TALES FROM THE CRYPT which used those original comics for their scripts.

The film uses behind the scenes footage along with the interviews to give a glimpse of what goes on behind the scenes. Its interesting to watch as some actors who were just beginning at the time, like Harris as well as Ted Danson who was just about to start a TV series about a group of people hanging out at a bar, and others involved in the production who went on to bigger things are shown in their early days. Particularly fascinating is the way the effects were done. Remember these were days long ahead of computer generated effects. Most were practical effects that were done, including some hair raising stories concerning the final story involving thousands of cockroaches.

The movie is well made, informative and for fans of the film a must have for their collection. In addition to the film the extras are fairly massive for as old as the movie is. They include:
-An audio commentary track with director & editor Michael Felshe
-An audio commentary track with actor John Amplas, property master Bruce Alan Miller and make-up effects assistant Darryl Ferucci
-Creepshow Days  An interview with director of photography director Michael Gornick
-Extended interview segments with George A. Romero, Tom Savini and Bernie Wrightson
-Behind the Screams  a compilation of on-set video footage from Tom Savini
-Horrors Hallowed Grounds with Sean Clark  An episode of the series that takes you to the locations made famous in various horror films
-Vintage 1982 Evening Magazine segment shot on the set of the film featuring rare cast & crew interviews
-Behind the scenes photo gallery of CREEPSHOW
-Best of all the full SCREAM GREATS VOL. ONE: TOM SAVINI documentary with optional audio commentary track with Tom Savini. To my knowledge this is the first time this has ever been released on disc.

If you love making of movies, documentaries, horror films, George A. Romero, Tom Savini or CREEPSHOW then by all means this needs to be added to your shelf. Once viewed youll find yourself digging out that copy of the original film to watch again and remember just how much fun it was the first time around.",1470700800,,4529,4.67713567839196

7743256,4,B01F4L7OV2,The Just Desserts doc is great but having Scream Greats Vol. 1 - Tom Savini made this a worthwhile purchase along with the huge amount of supplementary material. It's too bad someone (hint hint Shout! Factory) couldn't put all of this with a 4k digitally restored edition of Creepshow thus giving that masterpiece the release it deserves.,1469923200,,338,4.947368421052632

7743259,4,B01F4L7OV2,"My expectations were pretty high for this release.

I was spoiled with such fantastic horror docs as Never Sleep Again, Crystal Lake Memories, and More Brains: A Return to the Living Dead. Those docs included all aspects of script, filming, distribution, advertising, release, and legacy. Very entertaining if you grew up with those films.

While Just Desserts was thoroughly entertaining and likely the best (and only) Creepshow doc we'll get, it left me wanting more. For starters, it differed in style to the Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th docs. Those films highlighted each effort individually. Just Desserts is kind of all over the map. Rather than focus on each of the five stories, they organize chapters by special effects, style, location, etc. It's just not as coherent, but still enlightening.

The interviews are also lacking. While NSA and CLM interviewed basically everybody but the caterer, Just Desserts focuses mostly on George Romero, Tom Savini and a few key production staff. Stephen King is sorely missed, but listening to Tom Savini is always a treat. No tales of behind the scenes drama or production problems (other than budget). The interview with Ed Harris was funny because he's clearly uncomfortable with his infamous dancing performance. Hearing how they imported thousands of cockroaches from Trinidad was the highlight.

Overall, I enjoyed the doc. I wanted more, but with much of the cast gone or moved on, this is the best we can hope to get. Recommended.",1469232000,4,1500,5.085365853658536
7743260,5,B01F4L7OV2,"Creepshow was such an awesome and inspirational movie for me as a kid, Just Desserts really covers a lot of the aspects of making the movie. Tons of wonderful interviews and loads of special features! Honestly, the documentary is an amazing supplement to the film, but the special features offer even more material with extended interviews and ""behind-the-screams"" footage!",1469059200,3,373,5.338983050847458
7743261,5,B01F4L7OV2,"Originally a major special feature on the
2013 UK Region (B) Special Edition of Creepshow by Second Sight films UK/Universal
This is a phenomenal  documentary
If you love the other  horror film documentaries in the last 5 years you'll dig this
My only problem with this release is the distributor
Synapse Films I'm not a huge fan of there's
But, I'll openly admit I'm gonna have to double dip for this BR
The exclusive  extras make this worth wild
You get a real gem in  Scream Greats Volume One: Tom Savini, Master of Horror Effects it's only been available on VHS and it's rare and out of print  this is the first time it's on a digital format  I seen this back in 1988 very cool
Scream Greats Volume One was also on Laserdisc (But, I can bank that's a LD that's super rare and hard to find) most horror/Adult Laserdisc are more rare and harder to come across then the typical Jurassic Park, Die Hard laserdisc
Horror's Hallowed Grounds with Sean Clark,

This documentary is in the same vein as ""Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy"", ""Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History Of Friday The 13th"", and ""More Brains!: A Return To The Living Dead - The Definitive Return of the Living Dead Documentary"", each have been released on their own and not as an extra on a DVD/ Blu-Ray release. Just Desserts is awesome! I loved it and I'm glad it's finally getting a US release and on Blu-Ray and with a ton of extras to boot! There are a ton of behind-the-scenes stories shared on this documentary about making the movie that I never knew. If you love the movie and you love the documentaries mentioned, you will love this documentary.  I can't wait to finally receive my copy and watch it all over again and check out the extras.",1462924800,36,865,4.440251572327044

It has a wealth of information about the movie with tons of interviews and looks at the special effects and storytelling. A lot of these Making Of Documentaries have been coming out recently and this is a good one if you're into them at all.",1490572800,,442,4.469135802469136
7743267,4,B01F4L7OV2,"Let me start off by saying, this is a great documentary about the making of Creepshow. I feel like we really had no good supplemental material with the DVD and Blu-Ray copies of the film. This more than makes up for that! George A. Romero and tom Savini both have large parts in making this thing as good as it is. There were also several interviews with some other members of the cast and crew (grips and all). The thing I'm a bit disappointed in, however, is - why couldn't they get Stephen King to talk to them? He may just not be interested in this anymore, but his insight would have been the cherry on top. I have no doubt this would be a 5 star release for me. We will settle at 4 though. I will say - if you're a fan of Creepshow at all...you should definitely buy this! It's well worth your money.",1488240000,4,806,4.140127388535032

7743273,5,B01F4L7OV2,"Very cool,just what I hoped for. Coverd all the great stuff from the original creepshow and more. I watched it 4 times. Why oh why doesn't King and romero and Savani make another creepshow? One and two were one of a kind. Love the anthology and props used.none of this crappy cgi and computer imagery. Creepshow uses what was available at the time andit really feels so much better than what they use now in movies. If you guys do another creepshow,do it exactly as the creepshow ine was done,props,comic scenes,keyboard music etc and it will be a huge hit! thanks for Just deserts,really enjoyed it but it makes me long for a new creepshow.",1479513600,6,641,4.582608695652174
7743274,5,B01F4L7OV2,"As a HUGE fan of the Creepshow films, I felt this was a must to add to my collection.  Great documentary packed with a ton behind the scenes information.  My only compliant is that the paper insert that shows other films this company has, or is making available, had quite a bit of racy (pornography) video info with cover photos.  If you have children, or middle aged kids, this maybe something you will want to remove from the disc case to possible avoid any...interesting question.  The insert does nothing more than showcase current and future films and has nothing to do with this documentary so I had no issue tossing it out.  Great to see all behind the scene information and learn any new things from this classic horror film.  I saw the original film when i was 11 and the Crate segment was a love hate relationship for me, scary and so fun to watch at the same time at that young age.",1476662400,,894,4.420731707317073

7743277,5,B01F4L7OV2,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

When it comes to horror film anthologies, I just cant get enough.  I mentioned this just last week, during my review of CREATURE FEATURE.  But within these genre gems, there is a wide variety of quality.  Some are forgettable, some are decent, and some are really good.  Then you have those films that stand above the rest, the elite 1% by which all other films are graded.  One of these top-tier titles is CREEPSHOW, a collaboration by two horror icons, author Stephen King and filmmaker George A. Romero.  If you have never heard of CREEPSHOW, then you probably live under a rock.

In my opinion, CREEPSHOW is one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) horror anthologies ever made.  It has a bit of everything, and theres not much more a horror fan can ask for.  JUST DESSERTS: THE MAKING OF CREEPSHOW is a behind-the-scenes look at how this fan-favorite film came to be.  If you like Special Features (as I do), then youll love this documentary.

If youve ever heard the term visual delight, this film is a perfect example.  There is SO MUCH to this documentary, I guarantee youll want to watch it again.

JUST DESSERTS: THE MAKING OF CREEPSHOW is shot well, in typical documentary format.  The film is comprised of interviews as well as behind-the-scenes footage that was taken prior and during production.  The BTS footage shows many of the unique and fun ways the crew brought the film to life, while the interviews showcase the creators and those involved with the shoot.

I have to confess Ive never read any of the old comics CREEPSHOW was based upon, but from what I understand, the movie is a solid testament and homage to them.  I wish Stephen King could have (or would have) participated in this film, as I would love to hear him discuss the comics influence on his writing.  Im not sure why hes missing from the interviews, but that doesnt really detract from the film as a whole.

JUST DESSERTS: THE MAKING OF CREEPSHOW is an excellent and fascinating look at one of horrors most legendary films, and I highly recommend it.  Regardless of whether you like Special Features or not, this documentary will find a place in every horror fans heart.",1473638400,,2231,4.625954198473282
7743278,5,B01F4L7OV2,"Really loved this documentary and also glad that the Scream Greats Volume One documentary is on here as an added bonus.  Must have and watch for those who loved Creepshow.  Very interesting story about the making of the film and lots of insight about the actors who were in it also.  It makes you want to watch the movie right after.  I wish they got Steven King and Ted Danson in this documentary, oh well.

RIP George Romero :(",1472342400,,429,4.379746835443038
7743279,5,B01F4L7OV2,Great doc!!,1471910400,,11,5.0
7743280,5,B01F4L7OV2,"Right up front it's necessary to know that Stephen King isn't part of this documentary. So, if you're interested in his insights about Creepshow, you won't find it here. Otherwise, this is a terrifically vintage and enlightening look into the making of, possibly, the best horror anthology movie of the 1980s. George Romero and Tom Savini and a host of others (from actors to grips to camera operators) talk about the inception and creation of 1982's love letter to E.C. Comics. Romero and Savini are extremely entertaining as they talk about the different segments of the movie and what it took to bring them to the screen. I think Romero talking about the cockroaches used for the movie's final segment, ""They're Creeping Up On You"" is hilarious. Pay special attention to the part about cockroaches and the telephone. As a character in Vault of Horror (or Creepshow, itself) might yell, ""Aaaaiiiieeee."" This whole documentary is filled with enthusiastic people talking about a project they clearly loved doing. That kind of love showed in 1982 and it still shows now. The best part of all is all the behind scenes footage. From cockroach wranglers trying to do the impossible (wrangle cockroaches) to Savini putting together some of the most iconic makeup jobs of the 80s, Just Desserts is the perfect supplement to your 20th viewing of Creepshow.",1471305600,,1349,4.9734513274336285
