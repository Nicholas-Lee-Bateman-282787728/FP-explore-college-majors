6080567,5,B00GJNQ65U,These are two of my favorite movies.  Underrated classics.  Danny Kaye was a comic genius.  More people should see his movies.,1401753600,,126,4.904761904761905
6080568,5,B00GJNQ65U,We are movie collectors and were happy to find Danny Kaye's Court Jester on DVD at a reasonable price.  The fact it is a double feature was just a bonus.  It came very quickly.,1398643200,5,176,4.147058823529412
6080569,5,B00GJNQ65U,"The Court Jester is Danny Kaye's finest example of the multifaceted entertainer's work. The ""Vessel with the Pestle"" is hilarious and never will go out of style.  The Five Pennies is a tear jerker and shows his fine dramatic talent.",1394150400,,232,4.8
6080570,5,B00GJNQ65U,"The Court Jester is a great movie, and Danny Kaye's performance is spectacular as he shifts between a bumbling, good-hearted jester and a dashing, confident swordsman.",1391212800,5,167,5.461538461538462

6080578,5,B00GJNQ65U,"Danny Kaye films are full of layered dialogue and an amazing delivery of song and dance.

6080608,4,B00GJNQ65U,"I enjoy THE COURT JESTER, because it's funny and adventurous, this film was different than watching Disney's SLEEPING BEAUTY (1959) because both films were made in the 1950s. Now THE FIVE PENNIES was made in 1959 and PARAMOUNT PICTURES wanted to produce Alfred Hitchcock's film NORTH BY NORTHWEST, but that film right went to MGM and became a hit but not for PARAMOUNT. So PARAMOUNT made this 1959 drama classic THE FIVE PENNIES, this tells the story about one man of the jazz age who goes on to become a great jazz singer in decades before having family problems in San Francisco. Remember one actress and some of the settings were used in Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO (1958).",1408752000,2,675,4.777777777777778
6080609,5,B00GJNQ65U,"This is one of Danny Kaye's best, I've been laughing with ""The Court Jester"" since the first time I saw it as a little girl. I had the VHS version and now this one. I am now a PROUD GRANNY and I cannot stop laughing every time I see it; I love Basil Rathbone in this movie. ""The Five Pennies"" is a classic, also part of my youth. The duet of Danny with Louis Armstrong singing ""When the saints go marching in"" is unforgettable. If you like Danny Kaye and haven't seen them, don't miss them.",1404345600,8,490,4.114583333333333
6080610,5,B00GJNQ65U,"I saw this as a youth and still remember various parts of it. Not sure of the scene but crack up every time on the vessel with the pestle has the brew that is true, etc.  Danny Kaye one of my favorites.  He was a consummate entertainer, in comedy or drama.  Worth the money. Great movie!  The dialogue is crisp and witty throughout the movie.",1402704000,,342,4.2153846153846155

8623858,5,B00GJNQ65U,"Danny Kaye in Court Jester - one of my favorite movies.  It is nice to have it when I need it - on DVD.  The quality of the recording is as good any other DVD I own.

The Five Pennies - I'd never seen that movie.  I liked it, though I admit that I'm rather a fan of the older character driven movies.",1457222400,,300,3.7142857142857144
8623859,5,B00GJNQ65U,"The Court Jester is one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen, so that is why I bought this two movie set. Expecting the Five Pennies to be a comedic, lesser movie than the Court Jester, it was simply a bonus. I was severely mistaken in that expectancy. The Five Pennies started off quite funny, and then turned into an emotional, heartfelt movie that will have you in tears. Both of these movies are extremely wonderful, and each of them are worth well over the asking price.",1456963200,,483,4.438202247191011
