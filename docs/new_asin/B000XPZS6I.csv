8229063,3,B000XPZS6I,"""Dies Irae"" (Day of Wrath) is a stylish film that is shot and edited extremely well. It looks great. At six minutes, though, it does not have time to develop much plot, and the summary on [...] (""one man takes on a gang of armed thugs to settle an old score"") actually gives more information than the film itself. The cast does a good job conveying good guys and bad guys without talking, but potential buyers should be aware that what they are getting is not really a full-fledged story per se but rather a well-executed set of action scenes.",1198368000,3,543,4.44
