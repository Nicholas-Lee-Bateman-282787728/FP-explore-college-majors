8231488,5,B000YA7UZ4,"This is definitely one of the funniest shows I've seen in a long time.  It's similar to Jackass but its much funnier and actually has a plotline (somewhat).  Each show, Kenny and Spenny decide on a competition (who can drink the most beer, who can eat the most meat, who can go the longest without getting a boner, etc.) and then compete for two or three days or until someone wins.  The winner then chooses a humiliation (eat bird poop, makeout with an old lady, etc) for the loser.  It sounds kind of dumb but its actually really funny.

This 3 pack is great because it has a lot of their best shows and mostly consists of ones that weren't aired on Comedy Central.",1219881600,,667,4.346774193548387
