This flick just happened to be one of the movies that they were featuring on their online movie thingy.  Well, we had no idea what this  film would turn out to be.  We actually ended up really loving it in the  end!!!  It seems like it's going to be one of those cheesy low budget  horror flicks, but it ends up being one of the most intelligent films I  have seen in a long time.  The ending was kind of lacking, but not enough  to take away from the rest of the movie.  I won't give anything away, other  than it does have a lot of zombies in it, but they play an entirely  different part than you would think.  CHECK THIS MOVIE OUT!!!

Not sure what this movie is, but I enjoyed it. It was incredibly unique and I don't think I've ever quite seen anything like it on it's own merits. It very much feels like it started out as a ""Dead Alive"" kind of zombie comedy and just decided to go in a ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me"" direction.

I liked how this movie really turned up some zombie conventions on its head. The zombies are never explained, and eventually they just fade out of the significance of the movie altogether. The zombies aren't even really a focus in the movie anyway, it's much more about this young man's personal unease with being alive where he is, fighting love as much as he does the living dead, and losing his ability to be human altogether. This is by far the most heartfelt zombie movie I've ever seen, which is probably why, despite how incredibly dark and nihilistic it gets, it never feels desolate or void. It never feels as lonely as the main character is.

Pretty good writing and acting too. The anthological approach was a good move too - I felt like I watched a whole miniseries condensed into a rather short film. Felt longer than it was, in a good way.

Yep, I'm definitely keeping this one.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vulgarity-For-The-Masses/dp/B007SZQOVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vulgarity For The Masses</a>",1387065600,,1377,5.057268722466961

Here one of the greatest black comedy/horror zombies films ever made, this side of ""Return Of The Living Dead"" & ""Dead Alive."" Though much more surreal & deeper than both those great masterpieces.

This is the story of Francesco Dellamorte, grounds keeper for the city cemetery, who everyone calls, ""engineer,"" and his seemingly half a deck assistant, ""Gnaghi,"" who is almost a dead ringer for Curly of the ""Three Stooges."" It's the story of the dead coming back to life, ""Returners,"" which Francesco & Gnaghi dispatch back to the grave with a nonchalant, just another night at the job routine, which really is very funny! Then Francesco meets the woman of his dreams at a graveside funeral service. What entails is a funny, semi serious, deeply black comedic odyssey, as Francesco may or may not be insane, questioning his own sanity?

Hilarious scenes pop up through this film like worms feasting on a corpse! We get a flying talking/singing head! Oh, it can move on the ground too! We get a motor cycle zombie, that is literally a motorcycle zombie! We get boy scout zombies! We get a jealous husband zombie, with saplings trees growing out of his head & body! Yes, the laughs are many, at the expense of the dead, & the living too!

Like many Italian horror films, ""Cemetery Man"" is filmed gloriously! Richly colored nighttime cinematography is a real treat for the eyes. It's soundtrack is unforgettable, like many Italian horror films. Unlike many Italian horror films, ""Cemetery Man"" is a lucid, cohesive whole, filled with fine acting & script, though the farther you get in the movie, the more bizarre it becomes! You'll be pondering the ending for days, months, years!

Really a gem of black comedic horror, ""Cemetery Man"" is for those with an open minded sense of humor, as some might find a scene or two offensive. So sit back, have a plate with spaghetti topped with bananas, & enjoy the singing disembodied head on your television screen! It's a scream!",1367452800,,1990,4.807017543859649

804129,5,6304178360,"Francesco Dellamorte is the humble caretaker of the Buffalora Cemetery, where corpses just can't seem to stay buried. He and his assistant, Gnaghi, are left to destroy the brains of the recently deceased, who return from the grave each night. As the lines between love and death begin to blur, Francesco becomes lost in the futility of his own existence before delusion and madness drive him to kill the living before they can return as the dead. DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE, or CEMETERY MAN as it is known stateside, is a pure masterpiece of Italian cinema, and director Michele Soavi's finest work. Soavi adapts the existentialist philosophy and biting black humor from Tiziano Sclavi's writing perfectly, while infusing the film with his own surreal imagery, flamboyant action sequences, and ornate sense of style. When casting the lead, there was simply no other choice than English actor Rupert Everett, who served as the inspiration for the character of ""Dylan Dog"" in Sclavi's popular comic book series by the same name. Everett is inseparable from the role, and provides an uncanny performance as our introverted antihero. He may only be upstaged by Franois Hadji-Lazaro, who plays the lovable idiot savant, Gnaghi. CEMETERY MAN features a number of stunning sets and incredible special effects by Italy's premiere designer, Sergio Stivaletti. Needless to say, it is one of the most original and artistic films within the genre, and perhaps Italy's last great Horror movie.

""Cemetery Man"" tells the story (horribly) of Mr. Dellemorte (the ""Cemetery Man""--played by Rupert Everett) whose job is to make sure the dead people in his cemetery stay dead.  It seems they keep coming back to life for some reason or the other.  Okay, that premise (if played correctly) could be funny.  This was not.  A script that was SO disjointed, accompanied by scenes that were even worse, do not make for a good time.  ""Cemetery Man"" is another Italian horror movie, but the trouble with this one is, well, it's just not that good.

+5 The name Michele Soavi may not ring a bell for most horror buffs but stating that the dude has quite the reputation may be an understatement. Although Italian horror seemed to have it's day in the sun long before Cemetary Man ever found it's way into our dark hearts, it would seem that Soavi was destined to become a legend in our living room. Having worked under such infamous horror auteurs such as Joe D'Amato & the beloved Dario Argento, it was only a matter of time before Soavi really made a splash on the international horror scene. Soavi also served as Assistant Director on the set of Terry Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. Cemetery Man was his ultimate calling card.

Fortunately, Dellamorte Dellamore Cemetery Man was anything but your run-of-the-mill zombie flick or rank Italian horror flick.  The film was based on Tiziano Sclavi's comic  book Dylan Dog, and starred Rupert Everett in the lead role. Soavi's stylish horror film managed to not only breathe life into a dying genre but also attract a whole new audience who had yet to experience the grand pleasure of a true comedy horror. I must also confide that Cemetery Man also beat Shaun Of The Dead to the punchline by about 10-11 years which is quite impressive.

I first saw this masterpiece during the summer of 1996 when very little at your local box office would be even remotely interesting. Perhaps the only film that could even cause to bat an eye around that time was teenster flick ""The Craft"" which is not bad film by any means but definitely pales in comparison to ""Cemetery Man"". In a time when films by Italy's finest directors were nowhere to be found & the mom/pop theatres were nearly phased out largely due to the rising multiplexes which cater to the mainstream crowds, I was a bit dumbfounded to have something so deliciously wicked & entertaining as Soavi's film.

Francesco Dellamorte has the uneasy task of being Buffalora's cemetery watchman where the recently deceased rise from their graves usually within seven days. Dellamorte ( whose name translates as ""St. Francis of the Dead"") slaughters the living dead when they rise from their graves with the assistance of Igor-like assistant Gnaghi (played by Francois Hadji-Lazaro). That is, until the day he meets a beautiful young widow (Italian supermodel Anna Falchi) at a funeral & falls head over heels.  And yes, now you have perhaps one of the most romantic if not tad erotic horror-comedies ever made.

Everett may very well be the most romantic lead actor right up there with a Hugh Grant or Hugh Jackman if you will.

Unfortunately, Dellamorte's young love interest is about to meet an early demise after the two proceed to make love on the recently deceased husband's grave. In an almost hilarious montage, the jealous zombie husband rises from his earthly grave & attacks the beautiful widow. It would seem at this point that our hero has missed his chance at a new life & possibly love but this is only the beginning. Over the next hour, Francesco is destined to meet two other women who bare an uncanny resemblance to the widow & the end results are often hilarious if not darkly comical.

While it may be difficult for some to subscribe to this kind of film, I highly recommend you check this one out if you're into strange cult films or even zombie flicks with a twist. Unlike Soavi's teachers or mentors, Michele is more interested in creating dream-like sequences which linger on in your head for days while intentionally making you giggle during your ""squirm"" moments. Perhaps he is one of the few directors in his native country or any other who has successfully proved that horror does not have to be confined to just great FX & can have broader themes which may very well appeal to a wider audience. Make no mistake, it's a winner all the way around & deserves every bit of recognition it's received.",1309132800,,3888,4.7481481481481485

Despite being a 45-year genre fan, I had never heard of this until it won a listing in Steven Jay Schneider's ""101 Horror Movies You Must See Before You Die"".  Other reviews will try to capture DD's strange problems and charm, but to be succinct: it is a gory black comedy born of its authors' frustration with Death and Love (the TWO biggest topics humanists could possibly tackle).  Because it deals with the authors' deepest human longings / questions / frustrattions, and because it's not afraid to toss in tangentially-related detritus from its stream-of-consciousness, I think this qualifies as a true art film - not in a pretentious we're-going-to-make-art way, but in the sense that it simultaneously expresses the very personal mindset of its creators AND deep grapplings with the universal human condition.  Genre fans should not be put off by such a highbrow evaluation - the gore and sex and humor flow aplenty.  Casual viewers may be put off by DD's unexplained, apparently aimless plot points, and the EXTREME character arc of the lead (boy hero goes shockingly callous/heartless then back again), but I'm glad to see so many Amazonians ""get it"".

804190,5,6304178360,"""Cemetery Man"" is a rare gem that too many people overlook.  Mixing and matching pieces of horror genres such as comedy and horror, ""Cemetery Man"" finds a nice balance that produces a great overall storyline with intriguing characters, accented by violence, sex, and dark humor.  Director Michele Soavi, did an excellent job with this title, striking a perfect balance between the violence, and the laughs, making ""Cemetery Man"" a very interesting and deep film to watch.

The story focuses around a gravedigger/caretaker of a cemetery by the name of Francesco Dellamorte who lives within the small town known as Buffalora, Italy.  His only true friend is a hunchback who goes by the name of Gnaghi.  Gnaghi isn't much of a companion though, seeing how he is not capable of speaking, instead relying on grunts, and groans to get his point across.  It's no wonder that Francesco is rather anti-social and dark by nature after so many years of being surrounded by death.  However, the audience gets to witness that Francesco does see some excitement from time to time, despite his lackluster job.

There is something special about the graveyard of Buffalora.  After seven days of being being buried within the cemetery, it appears as if something makes the dead return to life.  It is Francesco and Gnaghi who are responsible for sending the undead back to their eternal resting place.  No one believes Francesco about this madness that occurs every night at the cemetery, so Francesco eventually stops the pursuit of getting others to believe him.

One day, things change for the better for Dellamorte.  A beautiful young woman (played by Italian model Anna Falchi) appears at his cemetery, in attendance of a funeral held to honor her late husband.  The woman begins to grow attached to Francesco as the film progresses, until she meets a gruesome death at the cemetery, after the two lovers make passionate love on top of the grave of the woman's now deceased husband.

Things begin to twist in what can only be described as ""Twilight Zone"" style developments.  Everywhere that Francesco goes, he is greeted by a woman who resembles his new found lover.  Yet, it always appears as if fate has already been pre-determined to keep the two from ever truly being together.  Disasters constantly keep the two separated after each meeting.  Eventually, Francesco completely loses track of what is reality and what isn't.  As a result, he steadily grows more violent and delusional as the film progresses; however, it seems like if everyone in the town is oblivious to any of the events that have occurred, further fueling Francesco's madness until the epic conclusion that is bound to shock the viewer.

Great scenery, coupled with great acting and a very unique, and interesting plot line make this film worth checking out.  The punchlines and jokes are well delivered, and contribute quite well to the overall plot, rather than feeling tacked on.  Several scenes incorporate both horror and comedy elements at the same time, a true touch of genius.  There is plenty of violence, nudity, and laughs to be found in ""Cemetery Man"", and it's bound to please fans of other horror/comedy films such as ""Evil Dead"".  You'll laugh throughout the entire film, while still having the pleasure of enjoying a dark, haunting atmosphere, full of zombies, and violence.",1279843200,,3351,4.983812949640288
804248,3,6304178360,"To be honest I expected quite a bit more with ""Cemetary Man"". I have several friends who rave about this flick saying it combined the best of 80's Italian Gore with the black humor found in movies like ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Dead Alive"". To be honest it was simply okay, but nothing worth going out of your way to pick up.

The basic storyline is that Rupert Everett plays the caretaker of a ramshackle cemetary. It seems that a plague infects some of the dead, and they return after 7 days. Rupert and his half-brained assistant must re-kill these ""returners"" and rebury them. When an old man dies, the young bride catches the eye of the caretaker. Upon consumating their relationship in the graveyard, the old man returns from the dead and bites the young woman.

I don't want to throw out any spoilers, but genre fans will know what follows next. I will say there were times I chuckled, and I LOVED the musical score of the film. The gore level wasn't bad, but it won't give Fulci fans much to talk about. The story was interesting and the ending was a nice surprise, but overall I think the hype ruined my enjoyment of the film. I was expecting too much and was bound to be disappointed.

804251,4,6304178360,"After years of hearing good things about Dellamorte Dellamorte (known in America as Cemetery Man) I had to check it out when I noticed it on-demand. This being my first artistic Euro zombie flick had me not knowing what to expect. Luckily the tongue and cheek comedy/zombie horror had just enough of the goods to provide a lot of laughs and enjoyment. The film was directed by Michele Soavi who worked with famed Italian horror Dario Argento for several years. The influence has obviously had an effect on Soavi as he was credited with keeping the Italian Horror traditions alive throughout the 90's.

The film begins with cemetery caretaker Francesco Dellamorte (Rupert Everett) and his sidekick Gnaghi(who looks like curley from the 3 Stooges). Francesco works in the small Italian town of Buffaloras' cemetery, and just can't seem to keep the dead in their graves. For some reason those that have passed away rise within 7 days of their burial and can only be fully stopped by a fatal blow to the head. Thankfully for the town, Francesco is very dedicated and views the constant zombie killings as part of his job description. Within the film is a lot of dark humor, zombie love, and a gun wielding caretaker that can't keep the women away.

I'd have to say this is one of the strangest film I have ever seen in my life. However it's not a bad thing in this case. Cemetery Man was done extremely different then most zombie films thanks to some very interesting writing/directing. There is just the right amount of humor and zombie action to keep your interest despite some slower moving parts. The Italians certainly have a great hold over the zombie genre and would inspire me to check out many more works of the sort. I recommend this film to a certain type of viewer. If you want a gory zombie flick then this one won't satisfy you. You really have to be open to an artistic spin on the walking dead.",1247097600,,1906,4.619469026548672
804252,2,6304178360,"In `Cemetery Man', better known in Europe as `Dellamorte Dellamore', poor old Rupert Everett (before he was famous), has to deal with a pesky plague of corpses that return to life on the seventh night of their burial in the graveyard of a small ""Italian"" town of Buffalora. Although there isn't a single word of Italian spoken in the film, apart from the words ""Dellamorte"" & ""Dellamore"", the Italian setting is unmistakable. At first, the premise sounds great. It promised a return (or at least a nod) to the good old days of 70's Italian gore classics, like `Zombie Flesh Eaters' or `Zombie Creeping Flesh', but unfortunately, after the first 25 minutes or so, it descends into a mish-mash of the unintelligible and the aimless.

Honestly, I do understand why this movie would have a decent following, but the film really doesn't know which direction it's going in. It continually wanders off down blind alleys and gets itself lost. Even the basic premise that the film is hung on is never fully fleshed out...so to speak and is completely abandoned half way through the running time. Likewise, the side story of Everett's hopeless infatuations with several women (all of whom are Anna Falchi) never seems to know what to do with itself and therefore one is left with an unsatisfying taste in the mouth, when the end credits roll.

Unfortunately, the film's characters don't save the day either. Everett comes across as an annoying foppish Englishman (totally out of place in the Italian setting), with an inbuilt detachment from the whole project. Falchi is, of course very striking, but couldn't act her way out of a paper bag and every other character is there to make up the numbers it seems. Except for Everett's monosyllabic friend and work colleague Gnaghi, who's played greatly by Francois Hadji-Lazaro and is easily the best thing about the movie.

""Gna!""

But, while `Cemetery Man' fails to deliver on its promises, it does hold a certain spell over the viewer. It's atmosphere is not without merit and in fact it's a far more interesting movie than a large percentage of the dross that gets the green light every year and in a way, its aimlessness is one of its charms, in that you truly never know where the film is going to go next. The problem is though, is that you get the feeling that the director Michele Soavi wasn't 100% sure either. I haven't read the book that the film was based on, but I'd wager that there are a number of departures from the novel's narrative. Either way the film veers from the superbly weird `Mr. Vampire' like atmosphere one minute, to absurd, inane and extremely annoying idiocy the next.

It also difficult to know just who Soavi was thrusting his picture to. As a bizarre pudding of zombie horror, comedy, romance & eurotrash, the film promises everything on the one hand and delivers nothing with the other. Simply because none of the themes are expanded on and are discarded willy-nilly. The zombies are few and far between (and are completely forgotten about), the comedy is not funny, the romance has no chemistry and is aborted all the time and the eurotrash is just not trashy enough.

`Cemetery Man' is, in no way, a complete failure though due largely to the previously mentioned atmosphere and I'd recommend it for that (and Gnaghi) alone. But it is certainly not in the same stable as weird euro horror of the 1970's / 80's and is sure to disappoint many who will come at it from that angle.

Either way, it's probably a movie that I will revisit sometime in the future, but I'll almost surely come away from it feeling the same way. Confused, unsatisfied and a little short changed.",1245196800,4,3643,4.72755905511811

804256,3,6304178360,"Originally released as Dellamorte Dellamore, this is from director Michele Soavi, who mostly to this point was known as a right-hand-man to some of the most inventive Italian directors of the 70's and 80's such as Dario Argento, Lamberto Bava, and Joe D'Amato. He even worked side by side with Monty Python legend Terry Gilliam. But with this effort known in the states as Cemetery Man, he took those influences to new heights of the surreal and in doing so, sort of alienated the core Italian Horror fanbase in the process.

I first recognized his solo work in his 1988 film The Church. But like that film he takes to Horror, unlike his teachers, by putting the gore and frights second and the dream-like visuals and themes first. But it was the reverse order that made Italian Horror cinema so successful in the 80's, and in my opinion adding more ""class"" is what killed it as a whole by the mid-90's. Sure, Horror can have broader themes, and at times it can work quite well, but when you deal with things such as language barriers, small budgets, and a world outside of Hollywood, if what you did worked already, you shouldn't try to fix it.

And that's what Soavi tried to do with Cemetery Man. Starring a pre-famous Rupert Everett, is a story of a groundkeeper of a small cemetery where the people buried in it rise from their graves about a week later. The film starts like any other of the Italian Zombi group, and quite well with real-time gore effects that are impressive, but soon the story takes a weird romantic turn as Francesco falls for a young bride of a new burial and the whole film get very surreal. Along the way, with his faithful mute sidekick Gnaghi, who's a dead ringer for Curly Howard's Italian cousin, things go quite strange. The local goverment has an idea that the dead are rising here, but doesn't seem to care. Francesco's love eventually meets a grizzly fate only to return in his life in not one but three different incarnations. And when Francesco himself questions existence here, his over-the-top actions are not only passed by, but not seeming to even be ever happening in the first place. And in the end, we get a glimpse of closure of what we saw, but leaving many questions unanswered and sorta empty inside.

The disc itself is quite nice, with a long documentary on the background of Soavi, a 5.1 audio mix, trailers of other classic 80's/90's underground horror (strangely all American releases this time), and a beautifully remastered picture. Sure, I would have loved to have a commentary track explaining why the plot was what it was, or any involvement from Everett after the fact, but Anchor Bay has yet again presented a movie with great detail, if it deserves it or not.

Concluding, I'm sorta torn on Cemetery Man. Visually it's stunning with it's images and themes of love and the afterlife with Zombi tones, but honestly that's not what we wanted or was accustomed to from Italy's Horror Zombi crowd. Sure, greats like Bava or Argento provided similar themes in their 80's works, but with Soavi it somewhat falls flat in the 90's. Probably the last decent Italian Horror film to come out from there, Cemetery Man shows just why that unfortunately came to pass and their Zombiworld's days were numbered.

804278,4,6304178360,"Yea, I'm reviewing another Italian horror film.  My first review of such a film (Demons) has been a wild suck-sess.  Even though I actually enjoyed it, people didn't like me pointing out the proverbial toilet paper stuck to its proverbial shoes.  So, I got hammered with ""No"" votes.  As always; that's cool (by no coincidence, most of those votes piled on after I wrote a review of ""Pan's Labyrinth""; my crowning achievement!).  Well, here we go again.  I saw some toilet paper coming out of the pants this time.  The good news is this film was trying to be comical to a certain degree.  The bad news; it took itself a little too seriously to be funny.  However, this movie isn't that simple (or as complex as it tried to be).  Let me explain...

- RACCONTO (story)(mild spoilers)
This film is not so deliberate that its purpose is obvious.  The plot revolves around ""The Cemetery Man"" and his mundane, day to day existence blowing the heads off of zombies and the fact that this is his sole purpose in life.  Whenever he decides to divide himself from his work (i.e.; have steamy sex and fall in love) the inevitable result is death of some sort.  We and he eventually have to resolve ourselves to the fact that, no matter how many chances he gets, it's just not going to work out.  As you could imagine, this is a bleak and numbing existence that takes its toll on our ""Hero"".  This point is made in not so subtle ways, even when we get to the bizarre impressionistic ending.  On the other side is his buddy, Gnaghi, who finds love despite destiny due to less than discriminating tastes.  Of course, he's not the boss and tragically must succumb to destiny's pecking order.  I liked the way this started, but about two thirds through it took directions that started to suck the fun out of it for me.  The story fulfilled its destiny, but I didn't enjoy its uneven changes in pacing and style.

-IMPRESSIONISTIC HORROR COMEDY?
By the end of this film, I asked myself that question.  Before the end, it would have never occurred to me this was the goal.  This film starts out with a bang (you know; like the ones in all the Clint Eastwood Spaghetti-westerns?) and muddles its quirky way along as a somewhat sublime soft-core, zombie comedy (though it's not really that funny even by dark-humor standards).  Later, ""Cemetery Man"" becomes a film about a sociopath fulfilling his destiny.  In the end it falls off the impressionistic deep end, quite literally (is that possible?).  Of course it all has a point and it all makes sense, but it could not avoid appearing disjointed.  It was very entertaining in early stages with lots of bizarre zombie mayhem.  Unfortunately the pace of the film slows down, then gets slower and then takes some strange turns.  It's all pretty dark and ludicrous but not particularly funny, unless you find the emotional suffering of others funny.

-DELIBERANDO MAGNIFICO! (Magnificent acting!)
Well, not really ""Magnificent"" (I just wanted to use ""MAGNIFICO"") but it was usually pretty darn good.  Rupert Everett was an excellent choice for the lead; tall, handsome, brooding and edgy with a quirkiness that fit the role.  Anna Falchi and her ""chesticles"" were, um, IS his main squeeze.  Her characters (Yea, she plays more than one) are pivotal and shallow all at the same time.  This actually works when you consider how this movie plays out.  Franois Hadji-Lazaro is Gnaghi; Rupert's simpleton assistant and beloved friend.  Like most mute characters, he is a very sympathetic figure (Fairly disgusting as well).  The rest of the cast serves it purpose without negative effect.

-MORE ZOMBIES, PLEASE?
I'm way behind on my Italian zombie films (this being the first I've seen).  However, they clearly have a talent for this genre.  These might have been some of the more creative and interesting zombies I've seen in a film.  Not overdone (like in ""Resident Evil 3) and well acted, these zombies keep you asking for more.  The head carnage in this film is also top notch, believable and very entertaining.  Unfortunately, the cool zombies and the ensuing carnage fade into the background of the story.  Perhaps this is where my less than excited mood comes from.  If some way could have been found to keep the zombie's more integral to the story, I might have maintained my enthusiasm.

- IL FILM IL DESTINO. (""The film's destiny"" according to ""Google"")
""Cemetery Man"" has nice production values and some nice creepy atmosphere.  The actors did a good job and the Zombie carnage was first rate. As cool and interesting as this film started out, no amount of sex, grossness or murder could keep my enthusiasm going as the story moved away from the great ""zombie pest control"" theme.  I understood where the story was going; I was just disappointed in how we got there.  There is nothing of note good or bad for the DVD release as I didn't pay much for it and had no problems with it.  The film appeared to be shot in English with post production dubbing.  There is plenty to like in this film, just don't be surprised if you lose interest or become disappointed as it progresses.

804309,5,6304178360,"Francesco Dellamorte is the gloomy, unsympathetic caretaker of a very unusual cemetery in a small Italian village called Buffalora. Living out a miserable existence that even he views as something between life and death, when Francesco isn't seeing to the normal duties of his job, he is sending bullets through the heads of those who have returned from their graves. Why the dead are returning to life is a mystery to Francesco, but he tries to keep it between himself, his mentally-challenged assistant Gnaghi, and his one other friend whom he rarely sees, Franco.

Dellamorte's bizarre life finally spins out of control when he meets a beautiful young widow that he falls instantly in love with. The two discover they share some very odd interests, and it would seem that happier times lay ahead, but the reaper has other plans for the cemetery man who has yet to understand the difference between life and death.

Based on a character created by Italian comic book writer Tiziano Sclavi, ""Cemetery Man"" is a film that has garnered much praise for being far more than your average zombie flick, Italian or otherwise. The film is a philosophical pondering of love, loss, life, death, meaning, and reality through the eyes of Francesco Dellamorte Dellamore, a character whose own existence and meaning is hotly debated by fans. I've read several interesting theories on whether or not certain characters were other characters' imaginings or alter-egos, including Dellamorte himself! And, even stranger theories about the film's bizarre events abound. Whether this was intentional (as most prefer to see it, and far too many ""clues"" would indicate), or the result of all-too-loose writing passed off as genius, I'm sure I don't know, but even those who prefer to take the film completely literally tend to enjoy this as a great showcase of horror, sex, and violence in a thoughtful package. No matter how you view the film though, you're sure to be left trying to figure out the true meaning of the ""twist"" ending. Whether that is a good or bad thing I'll leave up to you to decide.

""Cemetery Man,"" AKA ""Dellamorte Dellamore,"" should hardly be called a comedy, really, but it has its share of well accomplished giggles. The effects run the gamut from impressive to ""I can see the wire,"" but are enjoyable on the whole, and the performances and music are great.

Somewhere between Dead Alive and Dawn of the Dead, this one's got plenty of gore!!
This movie came out in 1994 when Italian cinema had died down for some time, and many hailed Michele Soavi as the savior of Italian cinema. This is without a doubt one of the best Italian, or anywhere for that matter, movies to have ever been made.
Cemetary Man is a masterpiece of Italian cinema that even the master of horror Dario Argento should be envious of.

If ones penchant is the likes of ""The Night of the Living Dead"" or the ""Dawn of the Dead,""  it will certainly disappoint. However, for true horror fans and fans of zombie genres it presents a unique presentation and perspective with greater character study. There's something very funny about the sight of the dour Rupert Everett nonchalantly blowing off the heads of walking corpses that doesn't immediately strike you as funny, but remains in your mind as a wonderfully light-hearted way of approaching such actions. Much like the excellent Donnie Darko and Mulholland Dr., Delamorte Dellamore is a film that will probably remain in your mind for a long time after you finish watching it as you try to figure out what it all means. The mixture of humor, character study, fine acting, gore, and nudity sets it self apart from the many usual and common ""shoot'em up"" zombie movies. However, I do have one quarrel. It's not the movie, it's the production company who transfered and dubbed the movie. It was extremely poor. Even Rupert Everett, Mickey Knox and Clive Riche who are all english actors seemed to been dubbed, with a number of the actors, particularly Anna Falchi, being given extremely weak voices. I would of suggested watching it in Italian with English subtitles, but that option isn't available with the American DVD.

One thing I've found with Italian horror movies.....they spend alot of effort on visual trippery, seems they want every Italian movie to be an art film, and this is no exception (same goes for the Argento films of the past).  Its not a bad thing, just a distinctive style that you either buy into, or you do not.  An awful lot of strange things happen for no real apparrant reason :)  A little bit of sex (again, in that erotic italian artsy style), a bumbling mentally retarded sidekick, and a whole lot of strange, implausable things happening.

Cemetery Man is one of those genre defying films that surprises at every turn. It is amusing, thought-provoking, and borrows inspiration from the surrealists (in fact, consider the scene where Francesco and his love are passionately engaged under the sheet in the mausoleum . . . this is actually inspired by Magritte's ""The Lovers II."") Moreover, strains of Kubrick can be noted as Francesco ventures on a killing spree to ""An die Freude."" Soavi aligns himself with the greats and proves, that in many respects, he belongs there.

Not a mainstream fan, this was my first experience with Everett. His acting was absolutely impeccable. Franceso's ennui reflects our own ennui. Likewise, Franois Hadji-Lazaro showcases his enormous range with his portrayal of Gnaghi (a seemingly simple-minded ""idiot-child"" who harbors a reserve brilliance). The dynamic between these two actors is rare. Their exchanges are both humorous and tender.

The plot has been rehashed here over a hundred times, so there is no need for me to elaborate. Simply allow me to say, if you are looking for a zombie film similar to Romero's work, do not bother. You will be frustrated. In many ways, the zombies are incidental to this film . . . they shamble around the edges, but have no real role. The actual story is one of desire (and the inherent dangers of desire). So, if you have IFC blocked, think Bravo is too ""artsy,"" or find Sundance pretentious, BY ALL MEANS, do not try this film. Furthermore, if the thought of voluntary male-castration has you running for the hills, visit a more pleasant page. But if you are intellectually curious, buy this film today.

Apparently Anna Falchi, the Italian supermodel in the show had her dialogue dubbed in. While I enjoyed Rupert Everett character better in ""My Best Friends Wedding"", his character here was also highly entertaining. Other reviewers wax lyrical about the story, the director, and the intelligent subtext. I do not pretend to have such depth of understanding. While I like the show, I do not think it is a keeper. It is not for me one of the top 10, or even the top 20 shows I would want to hold onto. Fortunately, I don't have to make that choice.

Cemetery Man tells the story of Francesco Dellamorte (Rupert Everett) who has grown tired of his day in, day out existence, and his somewhat demanding job.  Only thing is, his job happens to be in the department of putting newly re-animated zombies to bed days after they are buried in his cemetery.  His hum-drum, lonely life (besides his assistant Gnaghi, played here by Franois Hadji-Lazaro) takes a turn however when he comes across a beautiful widower (Anna Falchi, in one of three roles) that makes him question his existence, and the homicidal rampage he takes that brings him to the point of spiritual enlightenment.  It's clearly not everyone's cup of tea, but for genre buffs Cemetery Man is a real treat.  Everett is utterly spectacular in a role that not many would be able to pull off, and under Michele Soavi's guiding hand, the film takes many turns that you won't see coming.

804380,5,6304178360,"Although I adore this film I can understand why so many people find it disappointing and bad. It's just that ""Cemetery Man"" looks rather strange for an unprepared viewer. Those who crave to see another zombie-flick would be frustrated because it's not your average horror movie. And it's also not a comedy. By many descriptions and reviews you could get a feeling it's something like Peter Jackson's ""Braindead"", but it's not. Surely there're some comic moments in ""Cemetery Man"", certainly it has a substantial part of it dedicated to zombies. But even if you wanted to find something similar to previous works of Michele Soavi, you won't find them here because this one is so different from ""Stagefright"", ""The Sect"" and ""The Church"". I guess it'll be easier to get this film if you're quite familiar with traditions of Italian horror cinema.
I'd call ""Cemetery Man"" (originally titled ""Dellamorte Dellamore"") a philosophical exercise by Soavi for it has a lot of things to think about and in general it is a metaphysical feature. The original name ""Of Death and Love"" is of course closer to the meaning of the film and I'd say it's essential for its understanding.
Two main concepts of mankind are being considered here by the creators of the film, and the results, I think, are very offbeat, ingenious and sometimes controversial which is necessary for any good movie. And as with many good movies you'd want to watch it more than once to catch all the hidden meanings. And pay more attention to what characters are saying rather than to action itself.
""Cemetery Man"" is very smart, innovative, intelligent and tacit. And forget about zombies, if you want them - just watch Fulci's ""Zombi"". There are plenty of them in ""Cemetery Man"" of course including a dead girl's head falling in love with cemetery attendant's mentally handicapped help-mate (!), but ultimately it's not what this film is about.",1152748800,6,1903,4.913043478260869

804391,4,6304178360,"I've been waiting to see this movie for years, as they've been telling us that a DVD release was just around the corner forever, so I never sprung for used VHS copy or bootleg, and, once again, it proved worth the wait.  I'm not quite as in love with this film as some genre fans, but it's definitely a very good movie, and easily one of the most original and unique horror movies of the 90's.

Now, I should note that this is only a horror movie in the loosest sense.  It qualifies as one mainly because it is so rooted in the form and conventions of the genre, even if it doesn't use these things in the conventional way i.e. in an attempt ot be frightening.  Black comedy is perhaps a better description, filtered through a vaguely surrealist, contemporary and darkly fantastic universe. (I've heard this film compared to Terry Gilliam, not with out reason, and Tim Burton is another effective point of reference.)  Still, on the other hand, it primarily takes place in a cemetery and involves a lot of zombies and exploding heads and whatnot, so it's pretty tough to deny it the horror label as well.

'Cemetery Man' is quite simply one of the most plotless films I've seen.  It simply lurches forward from one scenario to the next with no apparent thru line whatsoever.  The premise is like this:  Francesco Dellamorte is the caretaker of the cemetery of Buffalora, a small, rural town presumably found in Italy.  Oddly enough, corpses have begun to rise from their graves approximately one week after they die, though Francesco sees no particular reason to alert anyone to this problem. (He, correctly, notes that it's just easier for him to shot them himself.)  The film basically follows his day to day life, as he deals with the epidemic and continually philosophizes while occasionally and spontaneously falling in love with women.  People love to talk about Italian horror films having a `dream-logic', and they're usually full of crap.  I've never bought that most of these films are generally self-consciously disjointed, it's just that they have priorities greater than making a coherent plot.  This time, however, it is obvious that this was deliberately designed to be as wandering and inexplicable as it is.  Still, the film is built from numerous intriguing scenes, so it works even if it doesn't add up to that much.

Anyway, this is a heavily character driven affair, and Rupert Everett's Francesco Dellamorte is wholly at the center of the film. The success of the movie is heavily reliant on the audience's ability to like him, or at least be interested in him. Fortunately, Francesco is a great character and Everett does a fine job with him, making him a strangely cynical romantic and delivering all his sharp one-liners with just the right attitude.  (Now, a handful of these cracks are a bit too on the nose, I think, but they're quite clever in general.)  Francesco's assistant, the monosyllabic Gnaghi, who functions more as a pet than as a person, also proves to be surprisingly endearing, probably even moreso than Francesco himself.  Other than them we've got a few more amusing types, such as Francesco's one other friend, Franco, who seems normal, but perhaps isn't, the electioneering mayor of Buffalora and the clueless detective sent in to investigate the series of murders that occur later in the film.  On the weaker side are the three women played by Anna Falchi, but that's to be expected as they serve a different function from most of the other characters, as they're all Francesco's ill-fated love interests.  (Though, it must  be noted that whoever it is that dubbed Falchi's voice isn't much of an actress.  Also, Anna Falchi looks like a fish. This, arguably, doesn't matter, but I felt like mentioning it.)

Beyond the various oddball characters, 'Cemetery Man' is simply a visually splendid film.  Soavi showed that he could shoot and stage scenes effectively in 'Stagefright' and (especially) 'The Church', but he really takes things to the next level here, with innumerable oddball shots and great, elaborate set design.  The cemetery itself looks especially great, and it comes off as something of a parody of your traditional horror movie cemetery, as it is so exaggeratedly ominous and foggy.  On the downside, the many zombies generally don't look so hot, and the gore fx is often surprisingly shoddy.  Perhaps this is intentional, as the film is mainly just trying to be bizarre and surreal rather than frightening, but I still wish they looked better.

Despite the severe lack of a central plot, `Cemetery Man' actually manages to build somewhat, ending with some of the darker, more intriguing scenes, and finally concluding with the fairly baffling  finale.  The ending will probably irritate some, but I liked it.

It's hard to say who this movie will play to, but its got quite a cult-following by now.  A taste for Italian horror is certainly a plus, but you'll also probably need to like some ultra-black  comedy and self-consciously goofy, contemporary fantasy.  If you like all that, I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't enjoy `Cemetery Man'

Being Dario Argento's protege, Soavi's films have all had a bit of Argentoness to them.  For this film, it seems like the time Soavi spent with Terry Gilliam really rubbed off coz this film has a very Gilliamish feel to it.  I wonder if the grim reaper in this film is the same one used in Baron Munchausen!  The Gilliam touch and the fact that this movie's based on a comic would account for what people might feel are continuity errors, lapses in logic(not a new thing in Italian horror), a feeling of downright silliness and scenes that might seem just downright juvenile.  The film seems to exist in a kind of fantasy/fairytale type world, so it's easy for the viewer to accept the goofiness that sure as hell wouldn't be accepted in a straightforward horror film.  Needless to say, American audiences probably won't like it.  Rupert Everett is very impressive here.  No matter what film I see him in, in my mind his role of roles will always be Francesco Dellamorte.  Most of the roles he does anymore seem to exploit his homosexuality.  It's fine for awhile, but he seems to be typecast anymore.  Hell, in this film he plays a heterosexual man better than most heterosexual men probably could!  Then there's Anna Falchi who is simply the personification of sex on two legs.  She plays three roles, but they really aren't all that different from one another.  The dvd comes with a making of.. documentary that runs just shy of half an hour.  It's good and informative, but after waiting so long for this film to come out on dvd, the features are a bit of a letdown.  However, for better or worse, you can't deny that Cemetery Man is definitely a unique film.  It's difficult if not impossible to compare it to any one film.  Not many films accomplish being so morbid, zany and silly, yet can jerk you the other way and actually make you care about the characters in a dramatic sense.  Cemetery Man is a must see for Italian horror fans, or just horror fans in general.",1150416000,5,2315,4.554479418886198
804394,5,6304178360,"Okay, so the documentary is unusually good. The only problem is that the only cast member is Anna Falchi, who somehow looks even better than she did during the film. And she's wearing little make-up and has regular-sized lips! What? Where is Rupert and Gnagi? I'd love to know what Gnagi is up to!

It was nice to see Michele Soavi and learn more about him - he's not an easy fellow to research in the states.

The transfer is really nice, however, some shots are wicked grainy. The first pull out from the skull comes to mind. Other shots are clean as a can be on DVD, which means they must be source-based issues.

They also used the American ""Cemetery Man"" titles on the print, which is fine. It would have been a neat extra to have the Italian titles, as well.

There's some other features, like the original making-of, that aren't here, which is a bummer.

But, in all truth, it is a pleasure to finally have this in a good, legitamate US DVD. The booklet that comes with it is great - although it repeats a lot of information from the documentary.

This is the brainchild of Italian director Michele Soavi.  Rupert Everett is Francesco Dellamorte a caretaker of a cemetery where the dead have a habit of coming back to life.  Dellamorte pays little heed to the walking dead as he goes about his job of killing them again and putting them back into the Earth.  He actually lives in the cemetery along with his faithful mute sidekick Gnaghi.  But beyond the death and Gore this is far more than a horror movie and more a character study of Dellamorte who finds himself falling in love with recently deceased women (actually the same one)  over and over again and dealing with his own insecurities and loneliness.

There is also, as I said a great deal of black comedy, and what else can you essentially call necrophilia when you consider his affairs with these dead, but still moving women, not to mention Ghaghi's love for the mayor's daughter who ends up as a decapitated head in his possession later in the film.  Everett truly stands out as not only the star but the narrator as well.  His role was deeply complex, much more than one would ever expect in what is too easily dismissed as an Italian splatter film.  I can't wait to see this again!",1149724800,3,1375,4.485943775100401

804399,4,6304178360,"Rupert Everett plays Francesco Dellamorte, the forlorn, laconic caretaker of the Buffalora Cemetery, aided by a Curly-esque, dim-bulb--but frenetic--sort of individual called Gnaghi. One slight annoyance, or nightly chore--if you will--is that they have to keep the newly buried dead underground. For reasons never mentioned, the dead keep wanting to stay undead. (Mr. Soavi, as noted in the IMDb trivia for the film, explains that these 'returners' are brought back to life by the mandragola roots that permeate the grounds of the cemetery. But that really doesn't tell us why, does it?)

So Francesco and Gnaghi are kept rather busy returning the dead to where they belong--in the ground. To assist with this endeavor, Francesco keeps a revolver, which he uses liberally to shoot the dead, well, dead again. To complicate matters, Francesco refuses to let the town authorities know what is happening in the cemetery for fear he may lose his job, along with having to fill out all that bureaucratic paperwork. One aspect of all this bizarre supernatural activity that provides a bit of tension is that we never know, as Francesco and Gnaghi never know, which returners are going to take a few bites out of them, and which returners are just anxious to get back to their daily living routine (but really shouldn't, considering hygiene and all).

Francesco's night life, shooting and reburying dead people, is more interesting than anything else he does during the day, and that is a sad commentary on his existentialistic existence. For a man whose favorite pastime is reading the phone book, and who observes one day that ""At a certain point in life you realize you know more dead people then living,"" things are not going all that well. But how can he get out of his doldrums?

It is at this point that the voluptuous She enters his life. The woman, as played by Anna Falchi. He meets her during her husband's funeral. He is captivated by her beauty. Francesco does what he can to get closer to her, but it is when he shows her his ossuary--interesting double-entendre here--that she begins to fall passionately in love with him. It is here that the use of billowing cloth becomes most apparent as they embrace and kiss through the cloth. Billowing cloth appears throughout the film, and combined with the cinematography of long perspectives and close-ups, lends an impressionistic feel to the odd events surrounding Francesco. The ossuary itself is a wonderfully eerie and claustrophobic tomb filled with intertwined skulls, bones, earth and huge mandragola roots, suffused in a brownish-gold light. In the documentary, it is explained that the set was constructed in layers, then put together to create the finished look. It is quite a work of horrific art indeed.

As daylight fades and the night comes, blue ghost lights dance around Francesco and the woman. Soon both he and the woman are making love over her dead husbands' grave. Her husband, of course, is not pleased, and attacks them, killing his wife before Francesco can stop him. This being Buffalora Cemetery, however, she soon returns in her billowing death shroud to make passionate love again with Francesco. A little decomposition doesn't get in the way of his ardor, but her biting a rather large chunk out of his neck does. He makes sure she does not return this time.

Adding insult to injury, a busload of scouts, the mayor's fun-loving daughter, and fun-loving but careless motorcyclists, get mashed up on the roadway in a nasty accident, and soon fill up the cemetery, providing both Francesco and Gnaghi with much work to keep the mangled returners sedentary. Gnaghi, who does have some personal issues, takes a fancy to the mayor's daughter's head, and he soon has it out of the grave and into his apartment. She also takes a fancy to Gnaghi, and soon the two are singing and chatting up a storm.

The film shifts from absurdity to surrealism as Francesco begins to see the woman he loves in other women. Oh, and the meeting he has with Death I suppose I should mention also. Death is rather miffed that he keeps sending the dead back to the grave, so Death tells him it would be better if he just killed the living instead.

Francesco's existentialist angst spirals out of control, and he finally seeks escape from it all. Packing a few belongings, and Gnaghi, into the car, he heads out of the town, through a long tunnel, and into the outside world. Or does he? Has he found a resolution to his problems by trying to escape them?

804431,4,6304178360,"Years ago, while I was discussing the Evil Dead/Army of Darkness series in a video store, the clerk recommended this movie to me.  The 6-week wait for the VHS to arrive was well worth it.  As VHS tapes tend to deteriorate over time, a DVD release is more than welcome.

The movie itself is one of the funniest I have seen.  It has been relegated to the Horror genre, but that classification is not necessarily correct.  There is a significant amount of blood and gore, but the movie is not frightening, scary, or even moderately ""shocking"" as compared to the recent Dawn of the Dead release.  The only view of the undead that we come to understand is that of the main protagonist, who regards them as an annoying part of his job instead of, as in most zombie movies, some frightening demonic aberration.  From the opening scene, his treatment of the undead is downright hilarious.  By the middle of movie, when our protagist is casually talking on the phone while blasting corpses in the head whom are lined up at his door, it's hysterical.

The attentive viewer will note that no zombies appear in the latter part of the movie.  As the Grim Reaper suggests to the main character, it seems that the problem of dead people rising in the cemetery can be solved by shooting living people in the head.

Of course there is more to the movie than killing zombies.  The love story becomes increasingly strange as the movie moves on.  We discover that the protagonist's true love is the only truly ""undead"" or perhaps ""undying"" character he encounters.",1147305600,2,1544,4.632352941176471

Some might argue that the movie is a metaphor for regret, obsession over lost loves, or that the town it takes place in is really the place people go when they die.  But even if deciphering metaphors isn't your thing, the movie is still plenty entertaining.

His mentally impaired partner, Gnaghi, forms a relationship with *the zombified head* of dead girl he was infatuated with when she was alive.

804437,5,6304178360,"Cemetary Man is an exceptionally strange and wonderful film. Sensual and surreal, dark yet funny, it transcends any single genre. Every time you feel the story beginning to fit into a recognizable mold, it breaks free and shoots off in a completely unexpected direction.

Rupert Everett is Francesco Dellamorte, keeper of a small town cemetary. The excruciating monotony of his day to day existence is interrupted when sees the dead start coming back to life. In order to avoid having to fill out a pile of forms with the City, Dellamorte must re-kill these dead people. He is assisted by Gnaghi (Francois Hadji-Lazaro), a sort of village idiot who evolves into a truly memorable character.

Besides the zombie angle, Cemetary Man is also a strikingly original love story. Dellamorta falls in love with three different women, all of whom are all played by the the same actress. The first, he mistakes for a zombie and kills early on. The second dumps him after she makes him undergo some type of chemical vasectomy. The final one turns out to be a prostitute, so he kills her (no doubt, he was still bitter about the vasectomy).

It seems worth noting that there appeared to be a break between Dellamorte's subjective perceptions and the reality he inhabits. His communications with others are characterized by persistent misunderstandings. The only one who seems to understand him is Gnaghi - and Gnaghi's vocabulary is limited to his own name. Everything suggests that Dellamorte is either dreaming this whole story or experiencing some sort of schizophrenic delusions. But the ending doesn't yield any definitive answers.

804491,5,6304178360,"Cemetary Man (a.k.a. Dellamorte Dellamore) is one of the most original and entertaining horror movies of the last 20 years.

Director Michele Soavi started out in the Italian film industry by acting in a couple of movies by gore-meister Lucio Fulci before he became an assitant director on Dario Argento's Tenebre as well as acting in Dario's Phenomena. He made his directorial debut with 1987's Stagefright (a.k.a. Bloody Bird) and the violent and extremely stylish slasher flick put him on the map. He proceeded to direct two more films with Dario producing and co-writing (The Church and The Sect). While those two films were very similar stylisically to Dario's films, by The Sect he was beginning to develop his own visual sense. (He also was 1st assistant director on Terry Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.) Cemetary Man was the first film that he made without Dario's involvement and it is apparent that he truly came into his own with this film.

What's great about this movie is that it features zombies, but it really isn't about the zombies for the most part. Francesco Dellamorte (Rupert Everett) works as a care-taker for a local cemetary along with his mute co-worker Gnaghi (Francois Hadji-Lazaro who looks strikingly similar to Curly from the Three Stooges!). His only true friend is Franco (Anton Alexander) whom he talks with on the phone frequently. He spends his time drinking fine wine while marking out the names of people in the telephone book who have passed away. It just so happens, though, that people who are buried in this cemetary tend to come back from the dead as flesh eating zombies. But Francesco takes it all in the stride and views as just another element of his job since he can't get anyone to believe him.

The opening scene sets up the irreverant tone of the movie right away. Francesco is talking on the phone with his friend Franco when someone knocks on the door. He tells Franco to wait a moment and opens his door only to find a zombie standing there holding a briefcase. He shoots him in the head and calmly returns to the phone and picks up his conversation where he left off.

The movie is actually in a lot of ways more of a tragic romance. At a funeral he spots a gorgeous and mysterious woman who is not given a name (played by Italian supermodel Anna Falchi). She is there to watch her husband be buried. He immediatley becomes obsessed with her and they end up having sex on her husband's grave. He comes back to life and bites her on the arm. Francesco thinks she's dead, and when she comes rising up he shoots her in the head, only to realize that she was actually still alive. She then comes back from the dead and ends up biting Francesco on the arm before Gnaghi splits her head open with a shovel.

This basically concludes the first act of the film. The rest of the movie consists of the Anna Falchi character reappearing as different people much to the dismay of Francesco and his various attempts to be involved with her. Through some truly surprising (and darkly comic)events, the film ends with a conclusion that is very cerebral and enigmatic.

What sets this movie apart is that the horror elements (the zombies) act as sort of a backdrop for what is essentially a tragic romance mixed with doses of black comedy and some disgusting gore. There's a part in the movie where Francesco tries to tell the Mayor about the dead coming back to life, and the Mayor just brushes it off and completely ignores him.

A movie this wild would not work if the acting didn't anchor it. Rupert Everett gives a hilarious deadpan performance that works perfectly. The actor playing his helper Gnaghi also has some memorable scenes and manages to do a lot with a role that literally has almost no dialogue. The beautiful and exotic Anna Falchi manages to do equally solid work, especially since she's a supermodel with no acting training. While she has quite a few nude scenes in the film, they're done for the sake of the story and not just for titillation (but does she look amazing!) The rest of the cast finds just the right notes with all of their characters as well.

The extreme violence and explicit gore in the movie might repel some people, but like everything else in the film, it's done in a very artistic manner and isn't just exploitative.

If I have one minor complaint about the film, it's that it's a little bit episodic at times. It's very apparent when one act has ended and the next began. But it's nothing that really bothered me all that much. Some people might find the changes in tone jarring and offputting though.

This movie saw a very limited theatrical release back in 1994, which was when I originally saw it. Much to my dismay, it has yet to come out on DVD yet. I've noticed that Anchor Bay has begun re-issuing Michelle Soavi's earlier films (uncut and uncensored I might add) so maybe they'll pick up this one as well.

Unfortunately, Michele Soavi's son came down with a rare stomach disorder shortly after he completed this movie and he has taken an indefinite period of time away from directing to attend to his son's needs. He did something for Italian TV a couple years back, but Cemetary Man is the last movie that he has made. I would really like to see him get back to making movies at some point, since he's easily one of the best filmmakers to emerge out of Italy in quite some time. But I also respect that fact that he puts his family first.

Cemetary Man is a must-see for horror fans that want to see something truly artistic and original.

I didn't have high expectations being that the movie starred Rupert Everett (just having seen ""My Best Friends Wedding""), but nothing else was on.  The first 5 minutes of the film made me believer that horror film was not dead.  It had a strange, original story that kept me watching.  There are some excellent ""death"" scenes.

Rupert Everett plays Francesco Dellamorte, a cemetery caretaker, charged with the task of watching over a cemetery where the dead rise after being put into the ground.  His only companion is Gnaghi.  Gnaghi only speaks in grunts and his girlfriend is the severed head of the daughter of a public official. Combine these elements with Francesco trying to have relations with a girl that keeps being reincarnated with an exact physical replica and you have a pretty good movie.

At the time of this review in '05, this movie had not been released.  It has now been. It's far more entertaining than the carbon-copy ""horror"" films pumped out by the major motion picture companies.  If you get a chance, WATCH IT.  It'll be worth your time",1123718400,6,1198,4.684210526315789

This movie is unlike much of what else is out there. There is also a philosophical side to this one, which is very rare in a campy film.

Right in the middle of all these cheesy horror flicks Cemetary Man was giving them all the finger with its quiet cover. Everet lives in a world isolated. Morals, thoughts, and even his insticts have become suspect. Surrounded by death, and people incapable of accepting his existance nor able to change anything ahs made his mind slip more than a bit, letting take to life-threatening and changing situations with little thought or consequence. Self-inflicted castration, a gay man playing straight, an igor clone, a resurrecting love interest, sureal environments, zombies, arson, cool music, and more than a little strange dialoge make this a very interesting movie for those who like their horror flicks with a bit of thought and insane story.

I once recorded it off of Showtime, which was the same version as the laserdisc actually. Then I finally ordered the DVD from Italy (where the film was originally released from and I paid over $50 for it), and the box and seller said it was 148 minutes (over 9 minutes longer than what you can buy in America on VHS) and this was not true at all. The film barely finished at 99 minutes like all of the other available versions. I even purchased the ""Red"" version on European DVD, and found it exactly the same as the other versions that I have mentioned. So yes, the movie, in my opinion is really awesome and all (especially if you love black humour and all), but do not bother searching for/buying it from Europe or Japan or anything. Simply go for the American VHS version, for it looks so much better on the VHS! It is more haunting, more atmospheric... Well worth owning, I think-- the movie will definitely make you think.

It makes even more sense at the end when one comes to realize that Dellamorte has been lost in his own world, his own dreams, his own fantasies of things that never happened-- and that Gnaghi has been speaking the whole time, Dellamorte just never bothered to acknowledge it.

Rupert Everette stars as a cemetery curator with a problem--his resident undead have a nasty habit of returning to pseudo-life a couple of weeks after interment. But Rupert has a profound aversion to paperwork so he just shoots them in the head and buries them again...until the day his one true love (an italian model who bears a startling resemblence to Star Trek's ""Seven-Of-Nine"") dies in an unfortunate zombie accident.

What can I say? We were bored. We took the plunge, flashed the fatal Blockbuster card, and irretrievably lost two hours of our lives and countless innocent brain cells to this flick. Oh i know what you're thinking--camp, zombies, gorgeous gay Englishmen ... what's not to like? Well, I'll tell ya:  everything beyond the first 35 minutes.

Consider the fact that after the incident with the mayor, you just don't see them anymore. They are no longer relevant to the plot. Let me state it clearly.

804513,5,6304178360,"Dellamorte Dellamore (Michele Soavi, 1994)
Soavi, who got his start as an assistant director to Italian horror god Dario Argento, spent his time making obscure B-movies until he stumbled upon Dellamorte Dellamore (Of Love and Death, but released in America under the title Cemetery Man), Giovanni Rimoli (Trauma)'s adaptation of Tiziano Sclavi's novel of the same name (one of the highly-praised and popular Dylan Dog novels that have made Sclavi a household name in most countries that are not on this side of the Atlantic).
Set in Dylan Dog's hometown of Buffalore, Dellamorte Dellamore is the story of Francesco Dellamorte (Rupert Everett, who should need no introduction), the caretaker at a cemetery infected by a plague that causes the dead to come back to life seven days after being interred. Dellamorte (whose name translates as ""St. Francis of the Dead"") takes it all in stride, keeping around a variety of inventive weapons with which to re-dispatch the dead. After all, all that gravedigging means a lot of overtime pay, right? Dellamorte's sole companion in life is his sidekick, the seemingly mentally challenged Gnaghi (Francois Hadji-Lazaro, recently in Brotherhood of the Wolf, but probably best remembered for his unforgettable role in City of the Lost Children). Until, that is, he spies the most beautiful woman (Italian supermodel Anna Falchi) he's ever seen at a funeral. Immediately, you know you're not watching your everyday horror film; Dellamorte becomes a bumbling romantic-comedy film star around her. And yes, that's what you've got here--a romantic comedy. With zombies.
The comedy/horror blend works extremely well, and in the process doesn't keep the viewer from seeing that there's a lot more underneath the hood than the surface would convey. (This is hinted at throughout, but becomes obvious in the final scene thanks to a startling trick Soavi hands us; watch closely, because you may not catch it unless you do. It's brilliant.) Dellamorte and Gnaghi are complex characters on the surface, but there are clues throughout the movie as to their deeper motivations and understandings of the things going on around them. To me, this is living proof that Rupert Everett is a better romantic comedy lead than Hugh Grant, but that's just me. (Hugh Grant hasn't worked with zombies!)
Dellamorte Dellamore is one of those movies you can't really believe was made in the nineties. Intelligent, beautifully-shot, low-budget horror/comedy that looks as if it came out of Dario Argento's salad days (or out of Japan; there's more than one aspect of this film that reminds me of the brilliant My Left Eye Sees Ghosts). I can't recommend this wonderful film highly enough. Go as far out of your way as you need to to catch this one. **** ",1088380800,73,2762,5.097130242825607
804514,5,6304178360,"A movie with zombies, that's not about zombies. Go figure. It's more focused on the nature of love and the nature of death, as evidenced in the original Italian title Dellamorte Dellamore (the title ""Cemetery Man"" is a bit of a travesty).
The zombies fail to be horrific, since Francesco sees them as commonplace things. Which is probably the element that makes me say it's not horror. One of the few main elements in a [zombie] horror film is that the zombies must be scary! And sure they seem to unnerve Gnaghi a bit, but Francesco disposes of them as if he was stepping on cockroaches. They don't scare him, they're merely a nuisance.
And horror movies are mostly based on the conflict between the humans/good guys/whatever and the zombies/axe murderers/monsters/whetever. Cemetery Man is based on Francesco's experiences with and feelings about people and the world around him. In the beginning it seems like horror, with the zombies rising on the seventh day and all that. But once you see the way Francesco reacts to the zombies (as just part of his job, etc.) you know that they aren't the focus of the film.
The main things I like about this movie are the claustrophic atmosphere, and the fact that it can be interpreted in an endless number of ways. Was the first woman a zombie or just unconscious when Francesco shot her? If she was only unconscious, were the other women just his mind's way of punishing him? Why was it that no one could concieve of blaming him for his own crimes? Was he insane? Why did the dead come back? And so on.
My favorite scenes in the movie: When Gnaghi unearths the mayor's daughter and her head floats along the ground. Somehow, I just loved the impact this scene had. The way the head can really get around on its own lends a very surreal quality to the movie. Second, the scene with Francesco in the hospital. When he talks to his ""friend,"" it's a real turning point in the movie. It really changes the atmosphere and the pace. An adjacent scene, where someone says to the fleeing Francesco ""You have a gun? Good."" is particulary great. The next would be the ending, but I won't give that away",1088380800,7,2136,4.579634464751958

Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of Zombies(very well done Zombies too)but the movie flows beyond gore and macabre.  You really connect with this caracter, Delimorte.

I was really looking forward to seeing this one after all I read about it, ignoring the few negative reviews. Big mistake. So I dimmed the lights and sat down, waiting and waiting for this film to deliver. I waited and waited.... Bottom line, I was extremely disappointed and wished I hadn't wasted my time watching it. Maybe it was the fact that I went in hoping to see something like Night of the Living Dead only with a twist, well this movie stears clear of the usual zombie cliches and trademarks and blazes a trail of it's own. Director Soavi tried to make it too stylish and different from the usual zombie flick. I admit I usually am not very interested in a clever plot or interesting characters when I watch a zombie movie. What I really like is an atmospheric gore drenched nightmare like the Beyond or an over the top black comedy such as Braindead, Night of the Creeps, or Return of the Living Dead (All classics). If this is what you are hoping to see my advice is to avoid Cemetery Man aka Dellamorte Dellamore like the black plague and see a Fulci movie for an example of Italian greatness.
 This story revolves around a cemetery caretaker and his...sidekick who fight off the undead and get into all sorts of trouble. They each get involved with a strange relationship that becomes too much to handle, and become entangled deeper and deeper with a situation that is out of control. Eventually, their lives become surreal, reality harder to grasp. This only makes it more grueling to watch. In my opinion the characters are rather bland. The story is too ""out there"" and freaky. I give credit to any director or writer who attempts to come up with something original or unique but it has to be delivered well on screen. This is where Cemetery Man fails.

 There are several scenes of zombies attacking, yet they add little entertainment and the gore is infrequent and brief. The effects are decent but can't save this [movie]. Although the movie held my interest to the beyond stupid ending, through much of it I was bored and the story drags on with little comedic relief. This is one of the worst movies I have ever sat through (and I love low budget horror). Even though it is devoid of the overly polished Hollywood feel, it's undeniably dull and stupid. I just don't see how it can be entertaining to so many, but we all have different tastes I guess. I'm going to stick with less brain numbing splatter flicks from the 70s and 80s.

I would like to be able to be more forthright, placing its plot in a tiny package, comparing it to another movie for good measure and then saying something meaningful about it in closing, but this movie doesn't allow one to truly do so without fault. It actually defies the rigid standards of movie preprocessing, giving you a wonderfully unique feeling that makes my reviewer soul scream, ""10 stars!"" If you actually do categorize it, you end up either classifying this as an Arthouse film, something that oftentimes insults the quality of a beautifully constructed entity, or a surreal horror experience, something it easily surpasses.
Basically, I feel I have to be a little bit standoffish because this outing by Michele Soavi (The Church, Stage Fright) goes so far outside the ""box"" of reviewing, giving a bit of everything -humor, gore, a storyline, intrigue, nudity, a plethora of strange characters and events to drive the move forward, an interesting location for everything to take place, a snowglobe, and so on - and packing enough visual ""heat"" to entertain even the pickiest taste tester.

Those who see this as a confusing mess or just a cool zombie flick are missing the point.  Sure, it has everything from the graveyard setting to the dead rising, and yes, it takes a splitting of the head to kill the dead, but there is so much more to it.  It has story and symbolism amongst it all.
And there's more.  The film is certainly a visual treat as most Italian horror flicks are, and is highly humorous.  For all you sick bastards like me, there is a decent amount of gore, and Playboy model Anna Falchi bears her assets several times in this film.  But it's all done tastefully.  This film has STYLE.  It is very artsy, and if you're not a fan of those types, steer clear.
Now to the symbolism.  If you haven't seen the flick, I would recommend skipping this paragraph unless you enjoy spoilers.  The snowglobe is symbolic of how our hero is trapped in his place in life.  He is trapped by his own doing however, as he is afraid to live.  His occupation with death is very clear.  Lines like ""We're born to die"" and ""We all end up here sooner or later"" are evident as life being viewed as meaningless.  Anna Falchi's character is the embodiment of love and death.  In this film love and death are seen in the same light.
Also this film is a tribute to the genre itself.  The familiar setting and basic story about the zombies returning and such (which turns out to be merely a backdrop) pay great homage to horror films, mostly the classics though.

No, it appears the dead won't stay dead. These ""returners""  as they are called come back seven days after their deaths to wreak havoc.
Francesco has accepted his charge in life and realize no one in their right mind would believe him. He knows that without the cemetery, he would have no life. Unexpectedly, that all changes when ""she"" (Anna Falchi) walks into his ossuary. I never realized that ossuaries has such a strong erotic attraction for women. Quickly, they both fall in love.

It's not remotely as interesting to watch as that might sound.  Rupert Everett plays 'The Engineer', a cemetary overseer appointed by the mayor to fend off, alongside his obese Hungarian colleague Gnaghi, the undead, with guns, knives or any blunt instrument that comes to hand.  During the course of the film he falls for many women played by the same actress, mops up random accidents (including the motorcycle decapitation of the mayor's daughter, whose undead head his assistant romances), envies the domestic and bureaucratic normality of his friend Franco, and either fantasies about, or actually commits, mass murder.  He even has conversations with statues.
Quite simply, 'Cemetary Man' fails to work on any level.  Its original title, 'Dellamorte Dellamore', referring to the hero's name, puns on the connection between death and love (the Engineer's first sex scene here is with a widow on her husband's grave), and the film gets bogged down in his laborious monologues on these subjects, as well as on solitude, friendship, status, home, destiny etc.  Their dreary monotone carries over onto the unimaginative voiceover, which fails, verbosely, to make up for shortcomings in the visual storytelling.
From its opening scene, when the Engineer interrupts a phone call to nonchalantly shoot an intruding zombie, 'Cemetary Man' plays its horror subject matter for laughs.  As James Whale, Hitchcock and Wes Craven have proved, it is possible to have fun with the genre while still unnerving the audience, but director Soavi replaces comedy with noise, cluttered scenes, unfunny Felliniesque grotesques, and gross-out sequences that are clumsily contrived.  Everett, now a fine comic support, was at this stage in his career too preeningly pompous to carry this sort of role (although his lank, packed physique is something to behold).  The film's big talking point is its byzantine, comic-Gothic set design, its endless, hermetic, disgorging cemetary, its rank and teeming ossuary, its clinical bureaucratic spaces; but these are filmed with such ponderous artiness that they never convince us that they are anything but sets; as a result, the film numbs, but never chills.",1004572800,2,2309,5.338842975206612

804597,5,6304178360,"Actually, portions of Romero's Dead trilogy, particularly ""Dawn of the Dead"", could answer the above heading as well. ""Cemetery Man"", however, is much more a philosophical exercise than any of Romero's work. The original Italian title, ""Dellamorte, Dellamore"" (rough translation: ""Of Death, Of Love"") reflects this.
Based on an Italian comic book (which I have not had the pleasure of reading), ""Cemetery Man"" details the adventures of Francesco Dellamorte (a great understated performance by Rupert Everett) and his seemingly imbecile companion Nagi (Francois Hadji-Lazaro). Francesco is the caretaker at the Buffalora Cemetery, where the dead have the habit of crawling out of their graves seven days or so after burial. In an effort to avoid the hassles and paperwork that would result from notifying the authorities about what he calls ""Returners"", Francesco simply accepts the task of dispatching the dead (in traditional blow or shot to the head style) as part of his responsibility as caretaker. So things go until She (played by the delicious Anna Falchi) enters the graveyard, bringing love to the somber heart of our hero.
Director Michele Soavi has crafted a unique, multi-layered and visually stunning film with ""Cemetery Man"". At times an over the top slapstick zombie gore fest, the film never descends to the level of gore for gores sake gratuity. The Buffalora Cemetery, especially by night, is a thing of gothic beauty - a scene out of a dream or fairy tale. The themes of love, death and the search for meaning elevate ""Cemetery Man"" to a realm far beyond that of most, if not all, of it's kin in the zombie movie genre.
Highly recommended to those interested in unconventional horror films.",973987200,2,1709,5.107142857142857

The actors' and  actresses' skills vary from tolerable to really bad.  The story line is  just wacky but not in the humorous sense.  I could not wait for the film to  be over.  I would not recommend this movie especially if you like horror  films or zombie flicks.",967420800,2,468,4.476190476190476
804599,5,6304178360,"Francesco Dellamorte never finished high school, he only read 2 books in his life, 1 he never finished, the other one's the phone book. With this  lack of education and skill he is forced to work one of his town's lowest  jobs..Cemetery Man. The caretaker of Buffalora's cemetery his job is  simple. Most of the physical work, digging graves and burying bodies is  done by his simpleton overweight assistant Gnaghi, who speaks only in  grunts and works extra hard for wine and ice cream. Francesco's duties  consists of keeping records, locking up the cemetery at night and blowing  the heads off the undead with his trusty revolver. Unlike other dinky  little bland European towns Buffalora has a characteristic that makes it  quite unique.
On the seventh night after someone is buried in the town  cemetery they will most likely come back to life [something in the water  perhaps] and go on a rampage searching for what else, living human flesh.  Franceso and Gnaghi battle the undead almost every night, combating what  Francesco calls ""returners"". Strangely enough the only way to  make the behave and stay in their graves once and for all is to split their  heads open, a spade will do it, but a dumdum bullet is best. Blowing off  zombies heads, cleaning up the mess and re-burying them makes for extra  work, for which our hero gets paid not 1 cent more. This movie is very  artsy and unlike most other types of horror movies. There is an overall  comic yet serious flow throught the film. The story line, fine acting, and  new age techno score by Manuel De Sica sets this far apart from other  movies in its genre. I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in  foreign films.",965779200,5,1692,4.703071672354949
804600,5,6304178360,"I wouldn't be surprised if Cemetery Man isn't the world's only arthouse zombie film. There can't be too many of those, can there? The movie starts  out with a bang, and gradually becomes weirder and weirder, and  progressively more philosophical.
Just as there can't be too many  arthouse zombie flicks, there can't be too many illiterate graveyard  philosophers. Well, maybe Dellamorte (Rupert Everett) isn't illiterate, but  he's awfully close to it. He's only read two books. Okay, so he's only read  one, and it was a phone book, but that doesn't stop him from pontificating  whilst blowing away the living dead.
There are lots of grody bits to keep  you entertained: buckets of fake blood, peeping tom ignis fatuus (okay,  flaming cotton balls suspended from obvious strings), and rotting boy  scouts. There are also plot twists which will bend your brain, like the  ever-present Dellamore. Dellamorte looks like a classic Boris Vallejo  model, and Dellamore looks like a hunky Boris Karloff. The dialogue is  hilarious, and the cinematography superb. Maybe the director resorted to  using fake flies in the death scenes (in retrospect, I'm sure this was  intentional), but he spared nothing in his camera work!  The zombie  mouth-cam rocks.
The movie is worth seeing if only for the burgeoning  romance between Gnagi (Dellamorte's assistant) and the mayor's daughter.  It's very, very funny, and sweet, in a decomposing and vomitous sorta way.",965088000,,1449,5.168103448275862
804601,1,6304178360,"First off, let me say that I love zombie and zombie-related films.  I own and continually watch ""Dawn of the Dead,"" ""Night of the Living Dead ('68 and '90),"" and the Evil Dead Trilogy films.  I also  enjoy Fulci's work and the gore-laugh-fest, ""Dead-Alive.""
Thus,  I was looking forward to watching the oft-recommended ""Cemetery  Man.""
The first minute of the film was entertaining and I was  encouraged.  However, this encouragement would soon turn to bewilderment,  boredom, disappointment, and ultimately betrayal.
Sure there were  ""zombies.""  But they were few and far between.  And I never felt  a sense of danger as is felt in the living dead films.  Plus, I always  overlook minor special effect mishaps when the rest of the movie is done  well.  This was not the case with ""Cemetery Man.""
Sure there  were eccentric characters.  But they seemed to be pasted into the story,  instead of flowing with it (ala the cast of Dead-Alive).
There also was  a sexual undertone that made me think of the later films of Ed Wood.  That  is not a good thing.
If you are part of the art-house crowd, or if you  had to watch this film for a film class project, you might enjoy it.
If  you are a fan of Romero, Fulci, Raimi, and Savini, rent ""Day of the  Dead"" instead.",964656000,,1260,4.592760180995475

In it Gnagi  falls for the mayors daughter, Everett's character Delamorte tries to get  the town doctor to chop off his...problem, Delamorte falls in love with  three women who look identical, becomes the chief suspect in a murder case  (a murder he committed), and realizes that no matter what he does, his life  is almost completely futile.
