2735378,4,B000MGTT54,"If you are looking for step by step instructions, this isn't for you.  If you are looking for general guidance and a jumping off point, then this is for you.  Most of this will probably only make sense to you if you are a somewhat experienced knitter.  I was a little disappointed by the fact in some instances EZ had to have help with her calculations and a few other things from someone off camera.  On the other hand, I liked the fact that this is not some sterilized studio creation; the atmosphere is that of a cozy room with an old friend showing you a few tips and tricks.  All in all, not bad and I consider it money well spent.",1221955200,27,636,4.180327868852459
2735379,2,B000MGTT54,"I am a seasoned knitter. I saw this DVD advertised in a lot of the knitting catalogs and rave reviews on Amazon. Finally I gave in and purchased a copy.
If you think you'd enjoy knitting with Mrs. Doubtfire, then you will probably enjoy knitting with Elizabeth Zimmermann.  She is entertaining and has a wonderful sense of humor.
That being said, I gave the DVD only two stars because this is not a workshop for beginners.  It is a great review of techniques for someone who already knows how to knit.  It is sometimes hard to follow due to Elizabeth's self-editing of her directions and rapid speech.
I am sad to say that, for me, I was disappointed in the production.  I think it was initially a PBS series which would explain the adlibs and self-editing.
If your local library has a copy, I recommend viewing it prior to making a purchase.  This is an expensive DVD to just sit on the shelf.",1216252800,80,894,4.460122699386503
2735380,5,B000MGTT54,"I bought this DVD because I saw it was from EZ.  It is a 4 hour PBS publication and believe me you get your money in techniques.  In the comfort of your livingroom, you take this classes and if youmiss a part, or want to review it you back up to it.

This woman is amazing and this DVD is a great addition to your library, the resale value is very high if you want to sell it.  Elizabeth Zimmerman makes knitting seem easy and encourages you as if you were there with her.  Thank You for leaving us with the Gift of your teachings.",1210723200,9,531,4.019047619047619
2735381,5,B000MGTT54,"Elizabeth Zimmerman is refreshingly witty and charming as she guides you through all the primary and advanced knitting techniques.  The video close ups are excellent.  She absolutely loves everything about knitting and her enthusiasm is contagious.  This video captures it all as she takes you through her innovative shortcuts and helpful suggestions.  I thoroughly enjoyed seeing all the many beautiful sweaters she created over the years.  Old fashioned, perhaps; timeless definitely !  A must for any serious knitter's library.",1208476800,17,530,5.6455696202531644
2735382,5,B000MGTT54,"EZ is a classic, whose style every knitter should know.  This video will help make sense of her book, and give you a taste of the ""real thing.""

A true classic!",1207872000,11,160,4.129032258064516
2735383,5,B000MGTT54,"The content of this DVD is well made.  I was having trouble understanding the pattern from ""Knitting Workshop"" and this DVD really fleshed it out. The instructor goes at a good pace for me to follow, explains things well, and the camera closeups help you see what she's doing.

I learned how to knit from books and the internet so I find it extremely helpful to see a proficient knitter in action.  In addition to making the jacket I am picking up general knitting tips here and there.  This DVD provided much reassurance and confidence building for a self taught knitter like me.",1202256000,62,580,4.601941747572815
2735384,5,B000MGTT54,"I love this DVD.  I have wanted it since I first heard it was on the market, but didn't have a chance to get it until recently.

This is her original TV series on PBS and is excellent.  Whether you are a beginner or an advanced knitter there is something here for you.  She is a great teacher and her explanations are excellent.

I've been knitting for 40 years and considered myself an advanced knitter until I watched this DVD, I decided that really I'm a Intermediate knitter at best, but becoming better with each watching!

I highly recommend this DVD for everyone who wants to improve their knitting, especially those that don't learn well from books.",1198713600,87,657,4.572649572649572
2735385,5,B000MGTT54,I order this DVD because I heard and also read on the internet that it was a good DVD to have and watch.  I haven't had time to get through all of it but what I have seen has been very good and I have learned a few new things as well.  I would recommend it to any and all knitters.,1197331200,11,281,3.5901639344262297
2735386,5,B000MGTT54,"I had this on my wish list for a long time before I treated myself to buying it.
So my question to myself is ""Why did I wait so long?""

I vaguely remember this series when it was on PBS and I was a young beginning knitter.  I remember being in awe of EZ then and I am still in awe.  She is amazing.  This DVD and it is like having a wise and experienced mom or grandma sitting there with you and showing you how to knit.

This DVD offers solid instruction and education for the beginner all the way up to some advanced techniques.",1195603200,59,530,3.9622641509433962

2735390,5,B000MGTT54,Learned to knit within hours of watching this. I have tried to learn by reading but nothing compared to seeing it first hand. Love this.,1423180800,3,136,4.48

2735392,4,B000MGTT54,"My knitting experience: I knitted a scarf when I was 7. Then, like most kids, I got bored with knitting and didn't pick up needles again for 20 years. Needless to say I didn't remember a thing - I couldn't even cast on. I went straight to this video (I had seen it numerous times over the years as it was one that my mom watched a lot when I was a kid). Just a few knitting projects after watching this I was already making baby and children sweaters.  That being said, I seem to pick up crafty things quickly - I also self-taught crochet in less than a few hours by watching youtube videos and a pattern by video from The Lovely Crow. If you prefer VERY clear, VERY direct instructions, this probably won't be a good fit. Likewise, if you don't like it when people correct themselves after saying something, etc you won't like it.  In this video it is less ""structured"" in the sense that she acts as though she is just sitting next to you and showing you some things like good friends. I do like this video and the techniques shown, but I would also say that there is a plethora of videos on youtube showing all of the same things...for free. If you aren't sure if you'll even like knitting, it may be worth it to check out youtube first to self teach, and then get this later on once you are sure of the commitment.",1417910400,5,1317,4.222222222222222

2735394,5,B000MGTT54,"Who does not love Elizabeth Zimmermann? She has some ingenious ways of knitting which she talks about, and shows many examples. She's funny too. Like when she is showing how to do an increase from the row below, she says ""If you knit the increase this way then you have my blessing, but if you knit it this way you do not have my blessing."" She is charming, funny, and an amazing knitter, you have to have this DVD in your knitting library.",1408924800,3,440,4.313253012048193

2735396,5,B000MGTT54,"If you're an experienced knitter (I consider myself pretty experienced) there's probably not much new to learn from this dvd.  I always learn something new, though.  It's well worth the money just to hear/see Elizabeth doing what she does best.  I really do enjoy these dvds and find myself viewing sections of them over and over for reference.  Plus, EZ has a great sense of humor.  Love them!",1393891200,3,394,4.735294117647059

2735403,5,B000MGTT54,I cherish this DVD. EZ was a miracle worker with knitting needles and yarn. I enjoy listening to her talk to me while I knit as if we are having tea together. Great DVD for beginners and experienced knitters alike.,1392854400,2,214,4.375
2735404,5,B000MGTT54,"I can't express enough how delightful it has been to ""spend time with"" E.Z.

This video has become one of my most cherished possessions, and I can see that I will re-watch it often in the future to relive my amazing experiences listening to Elizabeth's wisdom.",1391644800,2,383,4.647058823529412

2735407,4,B000MGTT54,"I love EZ and the way she writes--her formulaic patterns and ingenious knitting tricks. I'm just glad that I got a chance to read her books first before I bought the video. Don't get me wrong--I enjoyed the video--but it is tedious at times and I would have given up if I didn't know who this lady was to begin with. It was fun to see her in the flesh and to see on video and in detail many of the patterns I have read about and seen photographed in her books. But the video work is terrible, and the off-camera chatting with her daughter Meg is maddening! Still, love her, will share with loved ones.",1365638400,5,601,4.189655172413793
2735408,5,B000MGTT54,"Elizabeth Zimmerman and her daughter, Meg Swansen, are my knitting heroines!!  Elizabeth has such a calming, chatty style that you think you have the confidence (and therefore you do) to do these things that she invented, ""unvented"" or explains.

2735410,5,B000MGTT54,"This DVD is the best! I am a devotee of EZ, have all her books. The DVD is a great companion to the book ""Knitting Workshop"". I think nothing works as well as visuals to learn new things in knitting -- or anything else, actually.",1334880000,5,229,4.111111111111111
2735411,5,B000MGTT54,"I love this DVD. It is awesome. She is one of those ladies who can knit without looking. It is like having my mom in the room with me instructing me on how to knit. Since I no longer have a mom I really appreciate this DVD. I haven't watched all 6 hours yet, although I have watched 3 hours and it was well worth the price. I will be looking for more videos from her and her daughter, Meg Swansen. I checked out a video at the library of the two of them and it is fantastic. This DVD I just pasted the link for<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Knitting-Glossary-DVD/dp/B000MGTT4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Knitting Glossary DVD</a>&nbsp;is actually an index of all kinds of knitting stuff, cast on, cables, cast off, etc and she and Meg show you how to do it, which is so much better than trying to figure it out from a book of still photography.

Someone said it is like watching Mrs. Doubtfire teach you to knit and I agree. This works out well for me because I loved Mrs. Doubtfire and I doubt if Elizabeth Zimmerman will ever set her self on fire in any of her videos. Highly recommend to both friends and family.",1308441600,6,1158,4.648780487804878
2735412,5,B000MGTT54,"Quite simply, the most inspiring, entertaining, informative knitting video ever produced.  Worth watching over and over again, as there are layers of knitting wisdom to be gleaned.  Elizabeth sparks creativity and will have knitters' fingers twitching in no time to cast on and start exploring the world of wool.  Worth every penny, and then some.",1305158400,6,347,5.2727272727272725
2735413,5,B000MGTT54,"While the filming techniques are reflective of their time, Elizabeth is warm and informative.  I'm enjoying listening to her, and even as an experienced knitter, I find I am both learning new techniques, and recognizing the origin of other techniques I've learned elsewhere.  I am very pleased with this purchase.",1298678400,6,313,5.24
2735414,5,B000MGTT54,"EZ has a typical dry British sense of humor that I find entertaining.  Some won't.  But, she shows all the basics I didn't get learning to knit from a magazine at age 7.  That was a long time ago, and a lot of spinning and knitting ago.  Wish I'd had this many years ago.  Love it!  Yes, I have to back up and review, sometimes often, but it's like having an instructor sitting in the room.  Worth every penny.",1278979200,6,410,4.113924050632911
2735415,5,B000MGTT54,"Absolutely the most fun knitting design video and book series, I have all her video's and the knitting workshop book I can't live without, my number one most used knitting book ever.. highly highly recommended if you want to learn how to easily make sweaters and hats, shawls, socks, leg warmers, scarves , baby surprise jacket,  totem jacket , blankets, some of the easiest most innovative designs came from Elizabeth Zimmerman.
go to ravelry website and type her name and you can see how many people have loved her. I love her totem jacket baby and aduly size and of course her genius baby surprise jacket...
this video and book series is something I cherish very much, so lets say you hate to pearl, knit in  the round, just knit one row on circular needles but keep going don't pearl back just connect to the beginning in the round where you started and just knit on, so easy you will be using her perfect % system to make sweaters without a pattern that work,  if you go to you tube you can learn all her techniques which are the easiest ever and get fast results.. if you must buy only one book on knitting start with this one and watch you tube video's on how to knit

if you just want to make fast sweaters that are no seam in the round  you can,  so very easy  using  her % system , also learn how to easily steek a sweater for a very  easy cardigan,  by simply sewing down on each side of where you will cut and cut down the middle add your finish down the sides , I also highly recommend  getting a set of the addi bamboo and lace point  click circular needles, it will be the only needles you will ever use.
Try  learning how to use a knitting machine absolutely fun, a brother kh260 chunky for thicker yarns,  or 950 model or above for  thinner yarns, I make gorgeous things in a very short time, watch you tube video's on  knitting machines, they are not difficult to use.. although at  nite I love knitting by hand, but for lace, scarves and even knitting large rectangles and then pattern cutting them and using a serger to serge the seams  possibilities are endless, see Karen Allens designs she makes beautiful cashmere sweaters by  using  her knitting machine and several different colors to knit a larger piece and then washes it and shapes it then cuts and sews it together for a perfect fit..

But back to the review of this  book... get it... it will be one of your favorites.. I also have all of Barbara Walkers books, Mary Thomas, and so many others.. but this is the book I reach for the most....
Awesome lady and genius designer
Even her initials spell what she is about  ""E. Z.""",1264032000,7,2606,4.360995850622406
2735416,5,B000MGTT54,"Granted, I already knew how to knit (kind of - I knew knit & purl) when I first got this DVD, but I learned so much more while watching it. This DVD CAN BE for beginners, if you take the time to rewind thru various sections you're trying to learn from. I taught myself circular knitting with double-pointed needles & I find that I'm much better, faster, & more consistent with my gauge than other knitters knitting the same projects, and I knit so much faster than others that I don't dread the DPNs, but have fun with them!

If you don't know how to knit, but sit down with this DVD, a set of knitting needles, some yarn, some patience, and the DESIRE to teach yourself, you can and will learn how to knit.  And with all the tips and tricks in this DVD, you'll learn so much you'll be sorry you didn't learn how to knit sooner in your life & will wish you had more years to do all the projects you find & love.

If you want to learn from a master knitter, do not pass this DVD up. I watch this DVD a few times a year and still learn something from it every time.",1261267200,8,1063,4.052380952380952
