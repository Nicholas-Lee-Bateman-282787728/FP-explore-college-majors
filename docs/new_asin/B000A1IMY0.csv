8072067,4,B000A1IMY0,"This is a very old Mexican film seen when a child with then famous actor, Jorge Mistral.  Miguel Aceves Meja, an excellent Mexican singer, was not so famous at the time, and if memory does not fail me, he must have appeared as part of a mariachi group in this film, not as a main character.  I liked the film but the preparation of some of this products leave something to be desired technologically in terms of sound.",1372377600,,418,4.346153846153846
