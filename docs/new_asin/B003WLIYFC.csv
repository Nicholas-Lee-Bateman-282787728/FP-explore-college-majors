These reports are a series of short science news reports made for local television stations. The Index's ""Background"" section says they were distributed to 'over 150 television stations' and those appearing in this collection were selected for their use with a 'science curriculum'.

Although the packaging says there are 293 reports on these seven disks, there are 26 of them which are the same, for a total of 267 reports in all. From what MrWizardStudios.com says, there were ""636 reports in the How About... series.""

These are a precursors to his 'Mr. Wizard's World' series and the short magazine type mini sections he would later use. In that series he also made short segments called 'Snapshot', 'Safari' and 'New Frontiers', which gave a brief explanation of one topic similar to these reports.

These reports are arranged into seven subjects, one main subject per disk, but some of the reports discuss two subjects, and how they relate to each other. And so appear on more than one disk. As the disks were prepared for classroom use, more then general viewing, where one subject would be studied at a time. The disks also come with CD inserts giving the list of each of the DVD's contents, and inside the insert, a brief description of the report, and the university or organization which provided the science footage. Don Herbert 'Mr. Wizard' presents this information usually while standing in front of a blue screen, while the footage runs along beside him.

The 'Index' a 36 page book arranges the contents of the disks in 'Subjects', 'Science Process Skills'', and general index of the titles of the reports. The last page is a 'Credits' page for the original series and DVD release. But doesn't mention the individual institutions the footage came from. The information such as the order of the reports on each disk, and the universities, and such, is only on the CD inserts.

The reports are numbered up to 43 on some disks, while the number of the disk is used to identify a report, so 443 would be the #43 the last report on disk 4. There are also several reports that are the same, but with different names, the 'Index' also seems to miss this fact. These are;
* 114 ""Disease Cells and Lasers"" which is the same as, 712 ""Diagnosing Disease With Glowing Cells""
* 415 ""Simple Forms of Life in the Antarctic"" which is the same as, 602 ""Desert in the Antarctic"".

The reports that are repeated from one disk to the other are;
105 & 329, 107 & 229, 111 & 231, 114 & 712 (see above), 122 & 313, 126 & 320, 127 & 317, 133 & 709, 136 & 309, 215 & 532, 216 & 440, 220 & 633, 221 & 627, 222 & 632, 238 & 439, 240 & 640, 326 & 634, 409 & 639, 414 & 603, 415 & 602 (see above), 423 & 638, 442 & 637, 443 & 626, 502 & 601, 542 & 743.

In conclusion, if you like these you will also hopefully like the series ""Mr. Wizard's World'. And if you've watched that series, you will hopefully like this as well. If there were 636 of these reports and their number counting hadn't been mixed up by the numbering in this collection, that means there are still about 369 more of these reports yet to be released on DVD, and that would be something to look forward to. I hope someday the entire set of 636 will be released on Blu-ray Disc. As well as the entire series of ""Mr. Wizard's World"". You may also like another of my favorite science television shows ""Beakman's World"" of which the two penguin character's were named Don & Herb in his honor.",1371945600,,3505,4.465625
