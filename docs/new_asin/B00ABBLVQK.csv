8549743,5,B00ABBLVQK,"I bought this video after several of our local knights strongly recomended it. Sir Gemini does an excellent job of walking you through the foundations of medieval combat using sword and shield. Whether you're just getting into the sport, or want an excellent refresher and/or different viewpoint/approach, this is the training video for you. I can't recomend it enough.",1360195200,,369,5.271186440677966
8549744,5,B00ABBLVQK,"Great introduction video for people new to European martial arts. If you are an intermediate or advanced fighter, this may be a bit too basic for you.",1360022400,,150,4.592592592592593
8549745,5,B00ABBLVQK,"I have been swordfighting for over a decade and this DVD is a great introduction into the art of fence. The techniques discussed in this video are of utmost importance if you want to take your swordfighting skills to the next level. Footwork, Measure, Timing, and of course, the major cuts are all discussed in great detail. If you are just learning, or looking to instruct, this DVD is a must-have.",1360022400,,399,4.633802816901408
8549746,5,B00ABBLVQK,"Gemini Asonte is one of the finest instructors in medieval martial arts active today. He has developed a clear and direct system of fighting in armour informed by the works of the fechtbuchs and modern combat arts.
Set out in easy to understand chapters this DVD takes you through basis stances and guards and the core attacks and defences.
Techniques are explained and demonstrated in detail and a variety of learning drills and exercises are also provided.
I have adopted Gemini's Oplomachia school as the core curriculum for my trainees and am working on adapting his ideas to my own techniques.
I cannot recommend this DVD more highly to those interested in WMA, medieval martial arts and SCA tournament combat.

8549747,5,B00ABBLVQK,"What a great  ""Basics"" DVD  for  New  people  learning to  Fight  in and  out  of the SCA.  I would  Recomend  getting one before there  no longer available",1356480000,,156,4.333333333333333
8549748,5,B00ABBLVQK,"I had been waiting somewhat impatiently for Gemini to get his video out, since I live nowhere near him and the few chances I have gotten to train with him have been fabulous.  The video is, in a word, awesome.  Gemini does a really good job laying out the vocabulary and explaining in plain english how to execute the different stances and moves he teaches.  I also really appreciated that he used repetition of both showing the move to the viewer and using descriptive words to break down what he was doing into ""steps.""

The video is also very helpful in that everything Gemini teaches builds on the basics from the very first lesson.  It makes the lessons easy to follow and reinforces the vocabulary and proper mechanics through each lesson.  Gemini's explanation of frame weight transfer as a power generation tool has been invaluable to me as well -- if you fight a western martial arts style such as rattan swords in SCA-style combat, and you have any sort of power generation problem, or diminishing power in  successive blows or combinations, you need to watch this video.

I cannot wait for HE Gemini to put out an ""Intermediate"" lesson disk, but in the meantime, I am going to use this disk as a daily training tool to work on perfecting my fighting foundation.

Totally worth the price.
