3909942,5,B002D755B2,My family & I totally love this show!! Absolute must for any Wallace & Gromit fan!! Hilarious & too cute!! Love everything about this!! Keep the DVD's Coming & put more episodes on them too!!,1255219200,,191,4.485714285714286
3909943,5,B002D755B2,There's something about this character that is irresistable with his fluffy wool tail.  He is cool like Grommit in the way he solves the wants and needs of his flock.,1254700800,,166,4.533333333333333
3909944,5,B002D755B2,"Love it love it love it.  My husband and I watched it before our son, we laughed so hard!!  Shaun is hilarious and everything comes across great even without words :)",1253318400,,166,4.32258064516129
3909945,3,B002D755B2,"Another skimpy Shaun collection.  The episodes on this DVD are:
- Little Sheep of Horrors
- Abracadabra
- Things That Go Bump
- Heavy Metal Shaun
- Troublesome Tractor
- Sheepwalking

The episodes are all well-worth watching (the star-rating is for the small amount of episodes, not the quality of the episodes).

DVD also has a couple of games as ""bonus features"".  I'd rather have the look-behind-the-scenes features that the previous DVDs had.

It looks like the ""6 episodes per DVD"" is how things will be working out from now on (since there are only 12 episodes left that have not been put on DVD here in the US).",1252022400,24,618,4.63302752293578
3909946,5,B002D755B2,"There's something for everyone in this cute show about a bunch of sheep, their watchdog and their owner.  No words, just a lot of hijinks and sound effects.  Every episode is well done, funny and less than five minutes long.  The series is named after Shaun the sheep from Wallace & Gromit's ""A Close Shave,"" which is found on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wallace-and-Gromit-Three-Amazing-Adventures/dp/B000W089WO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wallace and Gromit: Three Amazing Adventures</a>.

There's a baby sheep on the show named ""Timmy"" and he's always got a binky in his mouth.  He also goes missing in a few episodes and a frantic, comedic search by the other sheep always ensues.  The ""Little Sheep of Horrors"" episode is top notch example.

You won't be disappointed with this show.",1251331200,15,834,5.8429752066115705
3909947,5,B002D755B2,"If you like British humor, you will love Shaun. Enjoyable for adults as well as children.",1478044800,,89,4.625
3909948,2,B002D755B2,"This was a very mediocre viewing experience. These episodes have none of the charm of the Wallace and Gromit series, and any attempts at humor felt forced and contrived. I'm not sure why this seemed such a good idea--it's the rare writer who can create a decent story with no dialogue at all, which is what all of these writers tried--and failed--to do. Perhaps for very young kids this would be entertaining, but we found it to be tedious and not at all worth watching.",1477180800,,470,4.541176470588235
3909949,1,B002D755B2,bought thinking it was more then just the episodes from the show.  Very disappointing to pay for something I have already seen.,1476576000,,127,4.7727272727272725
3909950,3,B002D755B2,"Although we love Shaun and Timmy we were a little disappointed with this DVD. The cover pictures them dressed up for Trick-or-Treat and we were expecting to see a segment on that, but sadly there wasn't one. Timmy looks so adorable in his Halloween costume, but it's only on the cover picture for the DVD. Too bad.",1476316800,3,314,4.526315789473684
3909951,3,B002D755B2,NO NEW SHOWS! Just a remix of old shows. Mom was disapointed my five year old nephew told her he already has seen them.,1473897600,5,119,4.0
3909952,1,B002D755B2,"I love Shaun the Sheep, but this is just wrong. The DVD isn't anything new. These are all from the 1ST season. So if you have season 1 already this is a rip off.

3909960,3,B002D755B2,This is great but several of the episodes are recycled. Wish it had been all original episodes. Will watch every halloween from now on.,1399593600,,135,4.666666666666667
3909961,5,B002D755B2,Shaun the Sheep are really fun DVDs. They are interesting stories and a lot of fun to watch. I really like the way they are made and produced.,1397606400,,142,4.107142857142857

3909964,5,B002D755B2,Love this series.  Caught it at the end of a cartoon show on TV and started watching for it.  Found it at Amazon and started collecting the DVDs.  Very funny.,1391040000,,158,4.2
3909965,5,B002D755B2,Fun video.  I bought this for my young daughter and it is enjoyed by everyone in the family.  The little ones enjoy it as an animated show and the older family members are able to catch the subtle jokes that go unnoticed by the younger members.  The claymation and the stories fabulous.,1390953600,,286,4.461538461538462
3909966,4,B002D755B2,it is really great. it shows how gifted the creators are to not only to tell a story but also they the put that story together with its characters.,1373500800,,147,4.103448275862069
3909967,4,B002D755B2,I think I was expecting it to be more like the movie Little Shop of Horrors but it's not. But very cute.,1359849600,,104,3.772727272727273

3909971,5,B002D755B2,"My little girl is 2 and shaun the sheep obsessed. She doesn't have a whole lot of words perfected yet but she request to watch ""sheep"" every night about bed time. Great movie. It is a little short but with kids her age, honestly, she just wants to replay it and watch it again anyways regardless of the length.",1350000000,,310,4.271186440677966
3909972,3,B002D755B2,"""Shaun the Sheep: Little Sheep of Horrors"" is the fourth DVD release of episodes of ""Shaun the Sheep"". It has 6 episodes, where Shaun and the other sheep get into adventures. I did not enjoy this fourth DVD as much as the first and second, because the comedy has become a bit broad. As TV shows age, they tend to become too over the top, like Fonzie jumping the shark in ""Happy Days"". Cartoons need to follow some set of rules to be entertaining, like cartoonist Chuck Jones imposing the rule that the Road Runner could only run on roads. In this fourth DVD, I felt that Shaun and his fellow sheep could now do anything for the sake of comedy, and weren't following any rules. The DVD includes two simple games, suitable for young children, but I also found them pretty amusing. Reviewed 9/7/2009 after watching on DVD.",1325894400,,819,4.503355704697986
3909973,5,B002D755B2,"We are Shaun the Sheep fans here, from our 2 1/2 year old granddaughter on up to our 83 year old Grampy! This is one of our favorites though; our 3 1/2 year old falls off his chair laughing at it. The kids don't even pick up half the humor, but adults will! I like to watch it even there are no kids around! Not too scarey for the above ages.",1313971200,,342,3.8309859154929575
3909974,5,B002D755B2,"A Wallace and Gromit spin-off claymation show that follows Shaun, a sheep.  Greatly amusing and at times hilarious storylines appropriate for all age groups!",1296950400,,157,5.541666666666667
3909975,5,B002D755B2,"Shaun the Sheep is perfect for children of any age.  The stories are interesting, and there is always a good message.

I've shown this DVD to kids from three to sixty-three, and all enjoyed it thoroughly.

I highly recommend that you add the entire Shaun the Sheep collection to your private DVD library.

In service,

The creative team seems to be their best when having a slightly spooky theme as the basis (as in Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were Rabbit.)The selections on this disc are my favorites.

3909979,5,B002D755B2,We got interested in Shaun the Sheep when it played in between the cartoons on Disney.  She loves these movies and watches them over and over.

3909983,3,B002D755B2,another wonderful series and story lines from the folks of wallace and gromit.  my only complaint is it's fullscreen.  i think having wide screen would bring that much more visual joy.  would of liked 5.1 audio option too.  i loved the 2 games included!  a must have for kids and adults alike.,1258502400,,293,4.5576923076923075

I really enjoyed them and am glad they are finally available in the U.S.  Everyone from our 4-year-old twins up to my 60+ year-old parents just love Shaun the Sheep.  We bought all four DVD's of Shaun the Sheep and got a Wallace and Gromit DVD with the 3 classic episodes on it for free!  That was an unexpected surprise.  Since they were 4 separate products and since I don't remember seeing anything about a free Wallace and Gromit DVD, I'm not sure why we got it or if others would get it as well.
