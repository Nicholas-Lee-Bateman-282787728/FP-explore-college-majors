Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg and his lover Peter and other elites who seeded the 60's with art poetry style earned their keep writing porn for oxford press at $500/book ( using pseudonyms of course). Great great stories like the gathering for disappearance before your eyes of William S. Burroughs , the stories and a demonstration of his ""Dream Machine"", how the title Naked Lunch came about, how a translation of Howl  enriched the French language and the first meeting between the non French speaking ex pats at The Beat Hotel with Marcel Duchamp and the Dadaists.  Just so much fun and so exhilarating.  Great gift for the art collection at your local library as well as your own library of documentaries.",1372377600,6,839,4.732876712328767

5109822,3,B007TC3BI0,"This is an 82 minute film that shows what became the Beat Hotel.; an obscure hotel in Paris that became the home and even refuge of many of the writers of the Beat generation. It was their refuge from obscenity trials, among other matters -writers such as Alan Ginsberg. Photographs and firsthand interviews tell how this Beat generation began.

The main feature is done quite well. Even the talking heads are not intrusive. They are on for a few seconds and then pictures are show of what they are talking about. However not much is described of the more famous residents.
The extras are where this DVD falls short. There is a short film with Harold Chapman discussing his photography; but you cannot understand anything that he says. The sound is so muddled, it is like he is talking into an old fashioned telephone connection and someone recorded it on a cheap hand held tape recorder. The short film on the dream machine just shows the cylinder rotating - no explanation. The deleted scene does have subtitles but nothing else does and they were really needed in many places. There are 10 art gallery drawings, but again no description.

This shows not just a hotel, but is representative of an age and culture. One wishes that more was explained of the temperament of mainstream society and what life was like, so that a viewer would understand more of what this hotel represented as a haven for the Beats.",1358294400,9,1411,4.685483870967742

5109824,3,B007TC3BI0,"Alan Govenar's new film, The Beat Hotel, pays tribute to artists that were occupiers of the resistance movement during the 1950's and 1960's. The dwelling place for these artists was located in Paris, France, and was deemed a safe space for the eccentric, nave, brilliant, misunderstood, and confused mind.  This no-name hotel had a seedy reputation due to the drugs, uninhibited sex, gypsies and vagabonds that were commonplace inside.  The resident artists were affectionately known as the Beat Generation in part because they rebelled against American suburbia, censorship, war, and political hypocrisy through their art form.

Some artists were optimistic about the future while other artists appeared heavy burdened by the past. Respected and cherished names associated with the Beat Generation included: Allen Ginsberg, Peter Orlovsky, Gregory Corso, William Burroughs, Ian Somerville and Brion Gysin. Allen Ginsberg fled his obscenity trial in the United States and landed in Paris.  William Burroughs authored Naked Lunch. Ian Somerville and Brion Gysin invented the Dream Machine. Harold Chapman, a British photographer and Scottish artist, Elliot Rudie, were both in Paris capturing the Beat Generation in action.

In Paris, the artists were free to move and think. Besides, why would the French and European officials expend resources on censoring young writers, photographers and poets when they had enough societal troubles of their own?  Truth be told, certain police met their mistresses at this hotel and/or enjoyed a free meal by the hotel owner, Madame Rachou.  No harm done, right! Madame Rachou was the gatekeeper of the hotel and the artists amused her. Nevertheless, these artists found their way around Paris holding odd jobs while growing and maturing in their craft and talent.  The hotel rental rates were cheap enough to allow some artists to have enough money to dine at different restaurants and socialize with the locals. Despite the repute, the hotel was a place to exchange impactful and enduring ideas.  When the hotel is sold to new owners, a chapter in history concludes, but a seed of unrest is planted for the next generation.

Alan Govenar, director of The Beat Hotel, is a writer, folklorist, photographer and president of Documentary Arts, a non-profit organization that creates and preserves new perspectives on the arts, culture, and history. Govenar has also produced and directed numerous films in association with NOVA and PBS for broadcast and educational distribution. With that said, the first-hand accounts of what happened in The Beat Hotel appear genuine but the cinematic portrayal of those events were lackluster, almost sterile, as if Govenar were playing it safe for another NOVA/PBS audience.",1336780800,2,2748,5.384615384615385

8521770,3,B007TC3BI0,"Beat hipster Jack Kerouac was nowhere to be seen at the Parisian Beat Hotel, or is his name, mentioned in this documentary.

To show a documentary about the Beat Generation and avoid its king, Jack Kerouac, who wrote the most important literary beat generation oeuvre ""On the Road,"" is silly. Nonetheless, the beat poet Allen Ginsberg, famous for the greatest poem of the Beat Generation ""Howl"" roomed there. Along with other Beat notables like Gregory Corso, and the mad man himself William S. Burroughs, who wrote his most well known novel ""Naked Lunch"" there. That alone, offering room and board to the nut job, Burroughs, says a lot about the Beat Hotel and its owner Madame Rachou.

My opinion: Burroughs was a mad man, pure, stark, raven mad. I know. I had read two of his lunacy books: the ""Naked Lunch,"" and his other loony-brain novel ""The Soft Machine."" I could truly state with conviction; he was a mad man. His novels were pure nonsensical, incoherent.. Yet Kerouac's ""On the Road"" was pure pleasure, inspirational, to read; the novel was revolutionary. And so was Ginsberg's poem ""Howl."" And let me add Corso's poem/design ""Bomb."" The Beat Generation produced memorable works of literary distinction.

Not as renown as the Lost Generation, of the 1920s, who also resided in Paris. Among the Lost Generation were Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Gertrude Stein.

Watching this documentary, I must admit, however, I did become a bit confused. I wondered if it was more about the Beat Generation or the Hotel in the Latin Quarter of Paris; I would guess both, nonetheless the writers were more famous.

Watching this documentary was also odd because I had strolled down the Rue Git-le-Coeur without realizing its significance that it played in American literary culture. I most likely walked right pass The Beat Hotel without turning my head to notice it as I made my way to buy a pastry or crispy French bread. Also I had wondered the streets of the Latin Quarter at two in the mornings with a group of students and tourists singing to our hearts content. Yet, I never knew there was the Beat Hotel nearby or its historical significance. I was clueless.

I always thought the artist community in Paris was at Montmarte in Pigalle, near Sacred Coeur. It's where Toulouse Lautrec painted, and where Picasso and Pissarro and the painters of the post impressionist, impressionist, and cubism turn of the century era, 1900, plus writers like Apollonaire, lived there in Paris. I never knew that the Latin Quarter, near Norte Dame de Paris cathedral, was also a neighborhood of struggling, starving, down and nearly out writers.

This documentary says it was. So if one agrees with the premise that the Beat Generation writers made the Latin Quarter
ground zero for 1950s American writers, so be it.

I, for one, am a big fan of the Beat Generation. Kerouac was one of the 20th Century's greatest writers, even though he only wrote one great book. His other books are duds. And Ginsberg wrote a great poem, yet his other works, including Kaddish, are good reads, yet nowhere near as fantastic as ""Howl.""

Back to the crazed Burroughs. Upon reading his novels, to say the least, my thoughts turned to the garbage can. It would be an understatement to say he was mad.. After reading the Naked Lunch and The Soft Machine, I thought, Burroughs had grabbed loose paragraphs out of a garbage can. Then pasted them together. Result: his novels. Viola! Beat Generation. My opinion.

Back to the documentary, I was confused if it was more about the writers. or where they lived in Paris. The Beat Hotel is as much about the 1950s Beat Generation as it is about Madame Rachou, who ran the hotel. Nonetheless this documentary failed to pick sides of who deserved more attention the writers or the hotel. In the end, I was left to wonder about what took place in Paris in the 1950s, and what the heck was Burroughs frame of mind outside of irrationality. When he wrote the Naked Lunch at the hotel, I would guess, he probably was thinking about a baguette without the creamy brie cheese: it was all he could afford as a straving writer: a naked lunch.",1446336000,,4154,4.772980501392758
