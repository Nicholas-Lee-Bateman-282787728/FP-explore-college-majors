3622193,5,B001GZM44I,"Actually, this is the Discovery Channel show 'FBI Files', which was made by the same production company as 'The New Detectives' (which inspired the creator of 'C.S.I.'). Each hour-long episode covers one true investigation through interviews with the FBI agents, police, and forensic scientists who cracked the case. This 3-disc set contains episodes on John Gotti, the 1993 WTC bombing, the Unabomber, and the Polly Klaas kidnapping.",1224720000,14,434,5.492537313432836

8307444,3,B001GZM44I,"Hi all.
I'm not sure if this is the correct ""forum"" to be asking a question, but I would like to know if anyone knows of a particular episode of a crime drama I watched recently.
The episode concerned Hispanic brothers bank robbers & an ex-cop (I think he was dismissed from the force), who volunteers to go undercover to sell a gun to one of the brothers, in the hope of infiltrating the gang.
If memory serves, it was one of the FBI TV shows (FBI Files or Criminal Pursuit?) but not 100% sure on that.
Any help would be much appreciated.

Cheers.",1356134400,,548,4.269230769230769

8307446,5,B001GZM44I,"I liked to watch all the time I had the chance the different programs about FBI files, because is describing us how the fbi bureau agents worked to find out the clues and complete the puzzle to catch the killer(s). I recommend buy this product.",1322179200,,244,4.444444444444445
8307447,4,B001GZM44I,"I gave this as a gift to my soster and her husband, they both liked it, now on the other hand, I don't think it would be something I would want to watch. You would have to like that sort of thing.",1242864000,3,196,3.6904761904761907
8307448,5,B001GZM44I,"This is a real contender for one of the best tv shows ever made, and is surely the best documentary-format program ever produced. How could anyone not be absolutely intrigued at these real-life factual stories.

Some people think that only fiction has ""limitless possibilities"", but when you watch this, you realize there is no end to what humans do to each other, their motives, behaviour, excuses and alibis.

This is what good tv is all about. Hell, this is what tv should be about nowadays, instead of the mindless drivel which is on most of the time.

Watch it and learn something. It may not help you sleep at night, but you will learn how to make those you care about safer.

I will definitely be buying the entire series dvd boxsets when it is released.",1225238400,22,761,4.573529411764706
