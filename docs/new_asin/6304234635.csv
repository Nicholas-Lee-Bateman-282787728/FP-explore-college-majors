812034,4,6304234635,"This movie makes me laugh uncontrollably just thinking about it. It has such a perfectly bad cast, plot, and conclusion. The way every character approaches the ridiculous carnosaurs is almost as hilarious as how silly the attacking reptiles act when they fight. You will find that this third chapter is the cream of the crap, and if given a chance it is a good buy.",983232000,,365,4.630769230769231
812035,3,6304234635,"Okay, I LOVE both the Jurassic Park movies.  Carnosaur 3 delivers, but in NO way like the Jurassic Park movies.  Carno3 was aiight,the special effects were kinda stiff and unconvincing, and the acting wasn't all that.  (Except Rick Dean.  He was AWESOME in this movie!  I'm glad Jon Winfrey brought him back from Carnosaur 2 as a different character.)  If you want my opinion on the SPFX, I think they shoulden't have shown the dinosaurs.  They should have shown just the shadows, or hands, or just an eye or something.  That goes for Carno2 as well, but not the original Carnosaur.  NOTHING, and I mean NOTHING could have been done to help that movie!  But, anyway.  Yeah, the SPFX suck, but they're very, very fun, and the gore scenes are, well...uh, GOREY, but that's cool!  That's VERY cool!  If you're gonna see this movie, watch it in the dark.  It'll help the movie ALOT!",979862400,2,878,4.616883116883117

812171,4,6304234635,"I'll state right off the bat that this movie is not, by any stretch of the imagination, good. It was most likely a rush job to cash in on Spielberg's Lost World; Jurassic Park. It has the feel of a lot of USA Network's prime time drama TV of the mid 90s, so I would not be surprised if that's where much of the staff for this movie came from. The dinosaurs are recycled puppets from the previous two movies. However, it is interesting to note that inbetween Carnosaur 2, and this film, the T.rex had it's head blown off for another New Horizon's film called Dinosaur Island. So it appears they very hastily rebuilt the head of the T.rex for Carnosaur 3, and looks the part. For the bad movie fan though, this one is entertainingly awful. It never tries for any heavy-handed drama or tearjerker moments that some direct to video/TV movies go for. It might actually be best described as a Carnosaur fanfiction that got made into a movie.
As for the DVD itself; it's pretty average. No real extras apart from trailers and cast biographies. The video quality is decent, given the 16mm source material. Same goes for sound, basic stereo. Nothing really to write home about here. Seen better, seen worse.

Overall worth the purchase as far as I'm concerned. Might not hurt to get a used copy and save a few bucks.",1374019200,,1307,4.491596638655462

Even for the movies to have a poor budget. I enjoyed them all. But # 1 of them is a classic. Best of the worst in horror. Anyone who enjoyed these movies as kids or even adults should get this collection. With great menus and a little bit of special features these DVD's are surprisingly crazily good.

812232,1,6304234635,"This may be Scott Valentine's best dramatic performance yet.  And it's a darn shame.  Ouch.

So you take some marines and other military guys, ala Commando or Predator, add the spitfire Hispanic girl (who, of course, dies) ala Aliens and Resident Evil.  Stir in two scoops of Raptors, ala Jurassic Park.  Blend one scene of shooting up the monsters eggs (Aliens again).  Add a dollop of Jaws, by pushing a bomb or air tank into the montster's mouth, for explosive effect.  Churn in 20,000 gallons of bad acting and cliche plot.  The perfect recipe for a Bad Movie!

812233,1,6304234635,"If this is your first time experiencing the wonders of cinema, if

you've never seen a ""Moving Picture"" before, you'll think this movie is

a child of the gods. BUT if you've seen a movie, a TV show, even Barney

the Dinosaur, then you won't be very impressed by this film. Heck

Barney the dinosaur was even more realistic than the dinos in this

flick.

Now I like B movies. I just watched ""The Giant Gila Monster"" right

before I watched this swill, and I liked that movie much better. It

works as a B movie. It has lamer dialog,hokier acting, cheesier effects

and an honest to gosh real Gila Monster as the monster! Carno 3 just

doesn't pack much of a B movie punch. It has some gore, and that

Polchek guy comes close to being funny a few times but this movie is

underwhelming, almost....flaccid. It's the Little Engine That Couldn't

of Dinosaur movies.

  I'm not saying you shouldn't watch the movie. Some people can watch gum drying on a sidewalk and feel entertained. If you're one of those people, then give this movie a shot.",1163376000,,1041,4.457446808510638
812234,4,6304234635,"Yes, the series has been fun, but when will they stop! I think it should have stopped at number 2, but that is my opinion. Anyway, I watched this film on tv, and...well, what can I say? It is a low- budget film about dinos. Now, the dinosaurs may look fake, but they do a good jod on getting people to 'jump' out of their seats. The story is miner. Sometimes you can tell what is going on, but sometimes your saying ""WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?"". The goofs in the film are sometimes not even noticable, but sometime...you get the picture. The series has always been gory, and this film is very gory. If you were to fight over an argument on which film is better, Jurrassic Park 3 or Carnosaur 3, I think Carnosaur 3 would win. Do to the fact the Jurrassic Park 3 is terrible and the fact that Carnosaur 3 has better acting and story. Eacj film has almost the same story, but been changed around. In the Jurrassic Park franchise, It is always the same story. Anyway, If you really like the series, buy this one as well. It is just as good as the first two.",1148774400,2,1051,4.207920792079208
812235,5,6304234635,"I don't know what it is, maybe Carnosaur has finally run it's course, but this wasn't at all the best out of the series. The dinosaurs look a little better than in the previous two, but the film doesn't really go anywhere. It's just a rehashing of the previous films. Scott Valentine does a horrible impersonation of Sylvester Stallone and it is very clear that he is trying to do so from the facial looks to the talking, pure Stallone. Like I've said in a previous review, B-rated movies aren't meant to be Oscar winners, but even for a B-rated movie it's pretty bad.

Michael McDonald from Mad TV is on Carnosaur once again, this time towards the beginning",1136678400,,658,4.529411764705882
812236,2,6304234635,"In CARNOSAUR 3, Jonathan Winfrey resurrects the same plot mechanisms and rubbery special effects that marked the first two in the series.  Unfortunately, since the plot and special effects of CARNOSAUR and CARNOSAUR 2 were laughably bad, in this third go round, nothing of note has been added, with the possible exception of two good looking females who interact romantically with their male counterparts at the drop of a hat.

There is no real connection story wise with either of the first two so the opening scene of a terrorist hijacking gone awry is only to give the carnosaurs (actually a trio of Velociraptors and a T-Rex, all of whom for some reason cooperate rather than turn on each other) their cue to go on a rampage.  And on a nonstop rampage it is, much to the consternation of an anti-terrorist SWAT team who quickly find out that the carnosaurs' reptillian skin is every bit as bullet proof as their own body armor. The killing starts in a warehouse, and then inexplicably shifts to a sea freighter.  The climax races toward who will kill whom first.  The plot holes are big enough for well, a T-Rex to walk through.  Ever since Robert Cornthwaite as the mad pacifist scientist from THE THING (1952) shouted that the military has no right to kill an alien species that plainly seeks to kill as many humans as it can, Hollywood has continued to insert such an off the top character.  Here, it is Janet Gunn, the lovely blonde who exhorts the military to find a non-lethal way to subdue the creatures.  I could almost see a political subtext operating with Gunn taking the leftist attitude that the military must discover what the good guys have done to warrant being chomped on by flesh eaters who deserve our understanding more than our enmity.  Films like this one are not to be taken seriously.  We see them.  We are shocked by a few scenes of heads being ripped off.  We laugh at a few incongruous romantic pairings.  And then it is over.  Thankfully.",1136592000,2,1970,4.639769452449568
812237,3,6304234635,"As 'b' type creature features go it was pretty good. The characters were funny sometimes with a lot of 1-liners delivered.

The idea that 1 guy could run a naval ship is hilarious and the rubber dinosaurs were pretty cheesey though.

Also funny how as soon as they established the female scientist's intelligent character they decided they could ditch her glasses so she could be a love interest .;-)",1126051200,,400,4.782608695652174

812300,4,6304234635,"Last week I rented Carnosaur 3.  This is the third in the series but they do not seem to be really linked.  Carnosaur was based, very loosely, on the book of the same name by Harry Adam Knight which then became the basis for JURASSIC PARK.
In this the third installment a group of terrorists attack a military convoy transporting class 4 materials.  They were hoping for plutonium but found a tyrannosaurus rex and a pair of deinonychus.  These beasts were meant to remain dormant in a refrigerated environment but, thanks to the terrorists, they are now free on a shipping pier.  An anti-terrorist squad is brought in to capture the dinosaurs before they have a chance to breed.  Someone decided to grow them as self-fertilizing hermaphrodites.  It turns out they are nesting on a freighter so the military pulls out of the dock thus isolating the dangerous beasts.  Unfortunately things do not go as planned.
This movie was better done than the first movie with better acting, better story and better continuity.  If you like dinosaurs you will want to check out this movie.",1082937600,3,1076,4.772972972972973
812301,3,6304234635,"Alright, just how many lemon sourballs did they have to give Scott Valentine to make him keep that Stallonish type sneer throughout the whole movie?  In an obvious effort to shed his sitcom/family type roles, Valentine plays Rance like he just had two or three enemas and can't wait to get to the pottie.  His performance is so ludicrously bad, he's enjoyable.
This third in the series was obviously tired, as they've never done the fourth.  It' not grossly bad, just not as good as it could have been with a little more regard to plotting, pacing, and credibility.  Janet Gunn tries to outdo Valentine in her role as the doctor determined to take the dinosaurs alive to study them and make unbelievable progress in curing diseases?  Then halfway through the movie, she's a gun-toting soldier, obviously in heat with Valetnine, and she doesn't need her glasses either.  Rick Dean's Polchek tries so hard for comic relief, but delivers his lines with such lethargy, you wonder what kept him propped up.  Fortunately, Juliana Vail and Morgan Englund, as two marine grunts, give the picture some strength and credibility.
Roger Corman took over the helms of producer for this one, and his standard tacky touches are oh so evident.
It's a fun little movie in its own deranged way; the arm wrestling between Vail and Dean is so ridiculous, you can't help but laugh; here they are in the midst of killer dinosaurs and they want to show who's tougher, he or she.
Rent--don't buy, though.",1075507200,5,1480,4.780392156862745
812302,5,6304234635,"The story of a young boy's journey towards manhood is the central theme of this incredible story. Ned Belamy has proven himself worthy of rank among top rate actors like Chuck Norris and Bill Lumberg.  The underlying literary devices prove the brilliance of director Roger Corman.  The reccurance of the ""Bobcat"" as the plot develops, and the irony of the death of the mothersaurus play key roles in the blossoming of the protagonist.  This film makes one question his philosophical standings on the significance of human interaction with nature. After watching this movie, I immediatley thought of the classic Robert Frost poem ""The Road Not Taken"" -however a little bloodier. I bet Frost's original draft had a theme more like Carnosaur- but his editor toned it down a bit.  Now let's examine a little more in depth the pros and cons of the film.
CONS:
The ending did not leave a feeling of understanding and satisfaction.
The visual effects were overwhelmingly mediocre.
Not nearly enought hot women.
PROS:
the dynamic duo of Ned Belamy and Dianne Lad. Together, they were unstoppable.

The first movie actually tries to have a plot and attempts to be scary to some avail. The score is superbly disturbing and the acting is good. The special effects are terrible in the best possible way. Roger Corman did a good job on this one with a tiny sum of money. Numero dos is more in the vein of the common junk of the ninties(like pumpkinhead 2 and Leprechaun 2). The special effects are far better but even that is not too great. The original score is gone and the movie lacks any chance of being a good movie. Number three is the exact same as the second only with a few tiny twists.

If it weren't for the frequent gore on view to keep you distracted, you might have discovered plot holes big enough to pass a dinosaur through. A Special Forces team is dispatched to retrieve three biogenetically engineered dinosaurs stolen during transport. With the help of a scientist (Janet Gunn), the team (led by a bored-looking Scott Valentine) try to contain the carnivorous critters in a dockside warehouse before the queen T-Rex lays her eggs and infects the human population (what the hell??). Of course, complications arise. After mucho macho posturing, only Valentine and Gunn are left alive. Will they save the day? You bet. Is it left wide open for another sequel? What do you think? (So far, no third sequel has been forthcoming, but that doesn't mean there won't be one sometime in the future. Let us not forget this is Roger Corman we are talking about!). The effects are quite good and plentiful. Heads and body parts are ripped off in such a manner as the flesh stretched like cheese on a pizza. The only performance worth noting is Rick Dean (ISLAND OF BLOOD - 1982; STRIPTEASER - 1995) as a wisecracking soldier. Things go quickly downhill when he is killed off. As it stands, CARNOSAUR 3 (also known as TRANSPORT) is an O.K. time-waster if blood and guts are the only thing you are looking for. Also starring Morgan Englund and Stephen Lee.
