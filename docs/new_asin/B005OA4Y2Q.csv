8481033,5,B005OA4Y2Q,"I've followed Ulver through their entire career. I was one of those rare youths who stumbled upon college radio at a very early age, and, as a musician who plays by ear himself, can just feel the beautiful dark soul that Ulver has purveyed throughout all the years. When I first heard them in about 1992, they were recording extremely atmospheric Black Metal, and were quite great at doing so. What they've become over time are absolute musical geniuses!

This live performance, which up until its inception, was a very rare treat for fans of the band, was gorgeous darkness at its best. The synths, samples, crystal clear drums and haunting vocals all blend perfectly with the wide array of stock footage video displayed on the massive screen behind the band. It's an entirely unique and mind-expanding adventure that they take you on.

This band just keeps getting better and better. This DVD, however, is a crowning achievement that can't be beat! The performance of the spacey song Eos is utterly mesmerizing, and I could just watch and listen to that otherworldly, gorgeous tune repeatedly. This is an artistic masterpiece on par with Degas' Dancers, Fritz Lang's Metropolis, and the rest of the best available for your eyes and ears in this vast world of unlimited experiences just waiting for you to let them take you away to a faraway place.

I highly recommend buying this DVD! Do it! Stop reading this!! I'm just rambling now! GO! CLICK 'Add to cart' NOW!!!",1427155200,,1467,4.813492063492063
8481034,1,B005OA4Y2Q,THOUGHT I had bought a music cd; instead got two-dvd set. Went ahead and watched some of it and not my thing. I'll need to pay attention next time when I order.,1374624000,,160,4.03125

This wonderful DVD & Blu-Ray Set captures Ulver in all of their progress, from Themes From William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell to Shadows of The Sun. The band plays with an eerily precision that pervades through every song; this is art in every sense of the word. Garm's vocals really shine here, and he's every bit as impressive live as he is in the studio. Daniel O' Sullivan is also very impressive here, especially as a newcomer to Ulver. He plays with extraordinary grace - and in truth, so does the entire band.

Highlights include Eos, Not Saved, and the macabre For The Love of God. Listen to this with a good audio system and without distractions and I assure you that you will not be displeased.

It's dark. It's beautiful. It's ULVER.",1333843200,7,840,4.477124183006536
8481036,3,B005OA4Y2Q,"Normally, it would take me several weeks or even months, to get used to any new release by Ulver.  This DVD is no exception.  I like the music they play, there's no doubt about it.  I'm a big Ulver fan, and have been since I heard them back in 1997.  Ever since, I have acquired all their albums.

 This being a concert in the Norwegian Opera House, the video they played to accompany the music was confusing, inspiring, disturbing, and in the case of the song `For the Love of God'... out of place.  It probably has to do with my Western or American sensibilities toward sex in art.  I will not be spoiling anything by saying there are some edited pornographic clips during the performance of this song, along with some catastrophic images of bombs, dead people, etc.

 The other part I didn't like about this performance was the old man at the beginning and at the end.  What was that all about?  I found both appearances of the old man quite disgusting, and not relevant to the music.

 What I did like was the Pink Floyd/Portishead vibe I got from the concert.  The audience reacted well, and the production of the video was top notch.  The DVD and Blu-Ray have the same content, so you're not missing anything other than HD Video and Sound.  The package is really nice.  The exterior of the case is made out of cardboard with, inside it opens with the DVD on one side, the Blu-Ray on the other side.  In the middle are the liner notes with photography.  They did a good job at having professional packaging.  I don't think the DVD or Blu-Ray are region locked, as I played both on my PS3 with no problem.

 I'm okay with this purchase, but it's nothing really to write home about.  I expected more from Ulver.",1333843200,4,1714,4.402555910543131
8481037,4,B005OA4Y2Q,"The DVD is amazing, I really like it. I love this kind of music, and I am making my own library of DVD's regarding this type of music. I will keep buying it.",1332288000,2,157,3.787878787878788
