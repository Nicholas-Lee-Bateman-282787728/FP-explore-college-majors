8354233,2,B00278FSPU,"Being a huge fan of Korn, I was looking for a quality documentary of the band and thought this collector's box looked pretty promising, but I assure you... you will be very disappointed. The box consists of two documentaries; one of them being ""Kornography"" (which I don't think was even mentioned in the items description) and the other is one I have never heard of. Both are very bad! Neither of them contains ANY footage or even original music from the band. Not even any footage of their performances! ""Kornography"" does have a couple stolen interviews with the band (they did not interview the band themselves) and it does go into the background of the members, but all it has is recycled photos being used over and over again while a narrator speaks which makes it quite boring to watch. The other is actually worse! It contains nothing but interviews with fans and managers of other bands that have never even worked directly with Korn. And like ""Kornography"", it contains only a few recycled and overused pictures with poorly recreated music from the band. Besides the fact of how awful these two films are, I think it is important that you know that despite this collector's box being released in 2009 (making one believe that this is very up to date), the information and material provided and discussed in both films do not exceed the year 2000. Overall, all I can say is don't waste your money and time with this, any fan of Korn would be embarrassed to own it.",1294617600,11,1473,4.647509578544061
