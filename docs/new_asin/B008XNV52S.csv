8532253,5,B008XNV52S,"loisier gives a lovely snap of a beautiful marriage and further of two very important artists.  look forward to seeing more of this talented young filmmaker's work!

only gripe is that genesis is a pioneer in the performance-conceptual art world - this is neither a matter of plain opinion nor for debate; after all the TATE BRITAIN has acquired her archives, therefore canonizing her, for posterity.  this is unusual to have happen while an artist is still living...but genesis is THAT important.  anyway, i wish the film covered more of the work made by breyer-p-orridge as this is a fascinating period in the work of one of the world's leading -- and fortunately still living -- artists.",1374969600,3,690,4.871794871794871
