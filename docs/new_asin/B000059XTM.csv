1409833,2,B000059XTM,"Leos Carax's ""Pola X"" is at best problematic and at worst an incoherent mess.  It is rumored that Herman Melville went insane while writing ""Pierre: or the Ambiguities"" on which this film is based. This explains a lot in regards to what we are forced to endure while watching this film.  Pierre (Guillaume Depardieu, Gerard's son)is a good-looking, blond, rich author living with his sister, Marie (Catherine Denueve who manages somehow to keep her dignity) and engaged to blond, good looking, Lucie (Delphine Chuillot).  While having a beer with his cousin (Laurent Lucas who is always dewy-eyed for some reason)one sunny afternoon, he sees a dark haired woman, Isabelle (Katerina Golubeva) spying on him and proceeds to follow her as he realizes this is the woman of whom he's been dreaming.  Up until this point the film has been about light: bright sunlight, white clothing, blond hair,etc.  But the minute Isabelle comes on the scene everything goes dark, dank and miserable. Pretty obvious symbolism.  Isabelle claims to be Pierre's long lost sister and Pierre decides to turn his life upside down and take care of Isabelle which leads him into a fast spiral downward.  Golubeva's recitation regarding her previous life and her delivery of it in an irritating voice that sounds like a young, drunk Marlene Dietrich is one of THE most irritating scenes in movies that I have ever been unfortunate to witness.  The only small saving grace of this movie, besides Deneuve, was the sex scene between Pierre and Isabelle (Yikes!).  It was mildly erotic.",998265600,34,1553,5.011673151750973
1409834,5,B000059XTM,"This DVD is truly shocking all across the board.  Leos Carax's film is a study of willful descent into madness by a perfect and dewy blond young Guillaume Depardieu and he informs this film with an understanding of ambiguity and existentialism that I think only the French can express somehow.  Carax is masterful!  How he got Catherine Deneuve to bare her breasts, I cannot imagine!
 Also, pleasureably shocking is how perfect the picture quality and sound on this DVD is.  Fox Lorber has often had trouble getting their material up to the standard that DVD can display but this DVD shows they have turned it around.  Never again would I hesitate to buy from them -  I'll do it gladly!  The color saturation and detail of the picture truly preserve the gorgeous original photography.  Lastly, this DVD contains the most emotionally honest commentary track I've ever heard by Guillaume Depardieu.  If you're buying any Catherine Deneuve or Leos Carax film, buy this.",990835200,14,966,4.907407407407407
1409835,5,B000059XTM,"Pola X is a love it or hate it experience. Motorcycles on winding roads it may have, but these roads are not called ""Middle.""
This film, brought to us by the same man who brought us the intense, passionate, uncomfortable film The Lovers on the Bridge in 1991, revisits some of the same territory of that film here. There is Desperation. Lust. Love. Blindness. Sight. Darkness. Light. Prosperity. Intense Poverty. Artists. Their Art. The Loss of that Art. The Incredible Need to Recapture It. Hunger. Satisfaction. Illness. Life. Death. Pain. Loss. Intense joy. Bitterness. Jealousy. Regret. All in all, the ingredients of what makes a Great, with a capital G Great, film.
Pola X has a light side and an incredibly dark and desolate one. The film starkly separates these sunny and shadowy pieces of our hero's life into two main segments. First we see the light. When the film opens, we meet Guillaume Depardieu, in his beautiful villa, with his beautiful mother, and his beautiful fiance. Next to all this is a beautiful little computer, next to which lies his beautiful little book, which he wrote when even younger, and which he became instantly famous for writing, a sort of cult figure. He is a beautiful young man who has everything. Except his writing, except his muse. Because he has reached a point in his life where everything is so stable and 'flat' that he is beginning to have trouble writing, creating, producing. And this is nagging at him, slightly, like a small child tugging softly at his arm for a piece of candy or a pat on the head. For a while, though, he is happy. Happy smoking a cigarette with his beautiful mother on the lovely sun-dappled lawn, and making love to his fiance with quiet passion in her young room in her own house. Happy with these creatures of light, these creatures which cannot see into him, into his dark self, his true self, his strong, artistic, belligerent self which is knocking at his door, waiting to be let out.
All of this changes when he begins having dreams of a mysterious stranger, who is somehow familiar to him. Then, when in town one day with a friend, he sees a woman, a woman who somehow resembles the woman in his dream. She is following him. He follows her. They find each other. What happens next begins a gigantic odyssey of obsession, artistic fervor, dark secrets and their telling, and a manic intensity which takes our young hero, and all those around him and unravels them, slowly, one thread at a time....
This is riveting, fascinating French cinema. It asks, among other questions, which is more important: Art, or Life? Without a middle ground to choose from, our hero embarks on a desparate, driven attempt to find his Voice. As he peels off all the layers of familiarity and comfort, all health and future plans, in the name of writing again, he starts a slow, solid spin out of control, and ends up almost at the point of death. A must-have for every serious (intense) cinema lover. A raw, exorcising cinematic experience. Five Stars.",987033600,23,3011,4.704545454545454
1409865,4,B000059XTM,"In 1992, Leos Carax's career as a film-maker seemed to be over. His film ""Lovers On The Bridge,"" a collection of visual and sensory extremes that took years to complete and bankrupted three producers in the process, received uniformly bad reviews and failed at the box office. No one wanted to work with Carax or sponsor any more of his work.

Carax disappeared. According to later interviews, he spent much of the nineties in the Balkans, observing the various wars there up close. Then, in 1999, he suddenly filmed ""Pola X,"" an adaptation of Melville's bizarre novel ""Pierre, Or The Ambiguities."" His return sparked some interest, but critics hated ""Pola X"" about as much as ""Lovers On The Bridge."" No surprise there -- ""Pola X"" is even more maximalist and emotional than its predecessor. It's not a ""comeback."" In this film, Carax so clearly doesn't care if anyone is listening that one can't help but admire him.

Unlike ""Lovers On The Bridge,"" where the plot had a very strong realistic underpinning at its core, ""Pola X"" is contrived from beginning to end, like the book it's based on. But it is a very impressive and intense film. Objectively, ""Lovers On The Bridge"" might be ""better,"" but ""Pola X"" has a way of forcing one's admiration.

Leading man Guillaume Depardieu is the film's biggest strength. Carax's films tend to draw more attention to their director than to their actors, so it may be easy to overlook Depardieu's performance, but it is actually very strong. Like all of Carax's protagonists, Depardieu's character is desperate and obsessed. But Carax's previous favourite actor Denis Lavant always seemed to get some kind of smug self-gratification from exhibiting his pain, whereas Depardieu looks like he's credibly suffering from his mania. This makes a big difference. ""Pola X"" might be the first Carax film where the protagonist's desperation is genuinely affecting.

Unfortunately, the leading lady is the film's biggest weakness. Katerina Golubeva, as Pierre's long-lost half-sister, is insufferable. She has a huge monologue in one scene where she drones on, and on, and on, in a heavy monotone voice. This is the entire range exhibited by her character. She only talks in this shrill, harsh tone. And she does a lot of wide-eyed, helpless staring. This aspect of the film is not necessarily Carax's fault -- the monologue and the characterization come directly from the source material -- but it's still very irritating. As befits a Carax film, her character is hopelessly selfish, and can think of nothing better to do than to curse her lover for no apparent reason even as he's going mad.

The other actors, however, are all quite good. Delphine Chuillot reminds me of Julie Delpy from ""Bad Blood,"" and actually her character is pretty much identical to that one. She's the saintly, long-suffering Carax heroine, but she has the good grace to suffer quietly and look innocent and pretty. And she makes an actual sacrifice for Pierre, as opposed to Isabelle, who is incapable of doing anything other than dragging him further down.

In ""Pola X,"" there is a sense that Carax has detached himself from his protagonist, and no longer views romantic excess as something glamorous and wonderful. This can be perceived in the scene between Pierre and his publisher. She tells him that his earlier, immature writing was superior to his latest work, precisely because it was in some sense more honest. Pierre is an immature young man, and it is beyond his ability to find any kind of deep, original truth about life, much less shock someone with it. This is echoed later, when Pierre receives a rejection letter that characterizes his writing as ""a raving morass which reeks of plagiarism."" This is very interesting. If it had merely said ""raving morass,"" then we might be inclined to think that Pierre's writing is actually brilliant, and the world has cruelly misunderstood him. But the part about plagiarism suggests that the publisher may be right.

Pierre even says something to this effect, addressing Isabelle: ""I thought I could give you everything, but I have nothing."" It's presumptuous to try to read into the director's motives, but Carax might be saying something about himself here. If he spent much of the nineties observing wars, he may have come to find the hip romanticism of his early films to be inadequate. Such a line certainly never appears in any of those films.

Carax's long absence has only improved his visual style. ""Pola X"" has less expensive visuals than ""Lovers On The Bridge,"" but it rivals the earlier film in grandeur. The brief opening montage of a wartime bombing raid is arguably Carax's most effective image. It's vastly superior to Godard's attempts at something similar in his last film ""Notre Musique.""

The warehouse is also very impressive, in some way even more than the Pont-Neuf from ""Lovers On The Bridge."" Like the depiction of Bastille Day in that film, the warehouse scenes combine visuals and sound to great effect. The camera pans over the rusty, forbidding set, while a bunch of stern-faced guys (apparently extremists of some sort) play gloomy, rhythmic music. It's kind of ridiculous, the way Carax sticks this weird industrial band into the set for no apparent reason, but at the same time it somehow reflects and illustrates Pierre's increasingly demented, warped condition. The camera lingers on the rust on the walls and the sharp corners. So, even if the plot of the film makes no sense, at least it's possible to believe it on its own terms while one is watching the film.

If ""Pola X"" is really Carax's last film, it's a strong conclusion to an unfortunately short career. But, as recently as 2006, there have been rumours that Carax has started work on a new film. Will we see him again?",1189987200,13,5774,4.918891170431212
1409866,3,B000059XTM,"...the girl who plays Isabelle would be dead by now.  She has the most annoying squeaky voice and the most annoying Slavic accent.  There is a scene in the woods, where she goes on and on about her miserable childhood, and after 90 seconds you are ready to wrap that dark hair around her neck and strangle her.  The girl who plays Lucie is much more palatable, because she stays quiet most of the time.

It's really hard to feel sorry for the characters in the movie, because none of them are really sympathetic.  The only one I felt sorry for was the little gypsy girl who got killed by the passer-by.",1139011200,8,602,4.339285714285714
1409867,5,B000059XTM,"Leos Carax's POLA X is truly one of the most engaging films that have come out in the past decade. Throughout the movie Carax (Lovers on the Bridge, Boy Meets Girl) creates a visual poetry which is both innovative & contemporary. The film may create a sombre mood throughout but it engages you to a limit that you start looking at things the way Carax wanted you to.

I am inclined to write the review of this movie because of the various negative publicity & misleading reviews it has received over the years. True, this is not your usual run-on-the mill type even in the art house genre, but it is definitely worth a watch. POLA X( based on Herman Melville's ""Pierre, or the Ambiguities"") is actually an acronym of the French title of the movie ""Pierre, Ou Les Ambiguities""[P-O-L-A]. The 'X' in POLA X derives from the shooting script being Carax's tenth draft of his screenplay. The protagonist Pierre(Guillaume Depardieu),a young novelist coming from a rich family & a prolific background, is writing his new novel but is falling short of new ideas. His otherwise mundane lifestyle turns upside down when he meets a disheveled dark haired girl, Isabelle (Golubeva), who resembles the girl he has been dreaming about for some time. She turns out to be his illegitimate sister, a secret he was kept in dark about for all these years. Pierre finds in her the inspiration for newer ideas & an opportunity to break out of his routine lifestyle. He breaks his engagement to his sweetheart Lucie (Delphine Chuillot) & embarks on a journey with Isabelle - to provide her with all the love, support & protection that the world has denied her & also to stimulate his own creative instincts.

It is definitely disappointing to see that even after so many years of its release, a few minutes sex scene between Pierre & Isabelle seems to get all the attention. It's true that it is graphic but it is sensual - innovatively shot with the use of tricky camera shots, colour & use of light & shadow. Carax didn't want to make it look like one of those ""Guide to Sex"" videos. I find the pace of the movie quite appropriate that does justice to the unfolding of the story. The scene at the forest where Isabelle talks about her past seems tedious for a first viewing but it settles with you with successive viewings. Isabelle's anxiety, insecurity & pain, which she could not share with anyone for so long, could be shown in that manner only. Also who can forget the background score of Scott Walker which supports the sombre mood & haunts you throughout the movie? Superb Cinematography & clever use of light & shadow techniques makes it a visual treat - completely in sync with the script. In fact this is a film which tries to tell its story visually rather than using long dialogues. I see this film reaching a cult status, may be 25 years down the line, when those Criterion Collection guys will come out with its special edition. But for the time being I will strongly recommend it to those who want a unique cinematic experience & a BREAK from the usual hundred million budgeted HOLLYWOOD Blockbuster crap.",1092182400,49,3099,4.6429872495446265
1409868,5,B000059XTM,"Carax's Melville is one of the great films of the last decade and certainly on a par with Claire Denis's Beau Travail, her version of Melville's Billy Budd. Pierre is Melville's most enigmatic work and Carax illuminates the mystery by placing it in our world, the dawn of the twenty-first century, where the spectator must enter--the viewer become a reader again--unriddling this Hamlet from the inside out.",1082592000,4,407,5.08955223880597
1409869,1,B000059XTM,"I am not too enthusiastic about writing reviews (for good movies there are already better ones than I might do and others are not worth to mention), but this one was unusually dissapointing. I have seen other Carax movies, and, although not being a great admirer, I found him at least interesting - thus, I bought this dvd, largely on the basis of other, some quite intriguing (if not always positive) reviews. However, so far this turned out to be the only dvd I would prefer not to have.
Since my mistake was misinterpretation of other reviews, I will start with some statements what this movie is not. It is not (an any kind of) love story. It is also not a study of deep (or any) philosophical questions.
The best description probably will be that it is a kind of horror movie. The mysterious Isabelle (Golubeva) really resembles a kind of vampire (in traditions how these are usually shown in movies) and meeting her is probably quite close to the meeting of death with the obvious consequences. Apart from that, the movie quite professioinally shows the kind of nightmares you may encounter on such an occasion and that's it. The nightmares are well done and as such may keep you interested, but they don't solve anything or give you anything - the feeling you are left with is just that of horror.
It is true that there is some good photography, camera work, (maybe) some acting, but probably not more (just differently) than in a typical hollywood movie.
Conclusions:
You might like it, if you are looking for horror movie, or if you basically like hollywood-style movies (the style is different, but similarly valuable and works on the level of similar instincts). If you expect that movie must be a work of art, then most likely you will be dissapointed - this one is not.",1026345600,4,1782,4.6424050632911396

7934422,3,B000059XTM,"I had a copy of ""Pierre,"" the Herman Melville book the movie is based on, and could never quite finish it. I gave it to my boyfriend, who did read it, and then told me about this movie. I found it VERY helpful to watch this movie with someone who had read Pierre, since it fills in some gaps for the characters' motives which isn't at all obvious in the film.

Basic, basic plot: Young man is in love, also kind of sketchy dynamic with his mom. Meets woman who claims to be his half-sister. He decides to abandon his secure life to run off with her, and the results are not good.

Guillaume Depardieu, as well as the two female supporting characters in the form of his girlfriend and the half-sister, do their best in a movie that is just a little too difficult to follow without a knowledge of what Melville had in mind. Catherine Deneuve isn't in the movie enough - she is powerful, beautiful, and absolutely packs in the psychological compulsion that make her scenes the most fun in a mostly humorless movie.

Guillaume Depardieu died a week ago. I am sure that his father, Gerard, was proud of him, but I would have been particularly so given his ability to take on such a potentially ridiculous screenplay and bring it closer to the psychological turmoil that comes across more obviously in the original book.

recommended for: arthouse freaks who would like everyone to know that they also read Melville.

p.s. I didn't find it THAT sexually explicit, particularly for a French film, but there's one scene a lot of reviewers refer to, and yes, it's pretty crazy, but not in an x-rated way. More in a ""whoa?! what?"" way.",1224633600,4,1625,4.51360544217687

7934424,2,B000059XTM,"Pola X is at once the most accessible and least interesting film from infant terrible Leos Carax. His modernised adaptation of Herman Melville's Pierre, or The Ambiguities is certainly less disjointed than his other features, but it lacks the inspired standout moments that make them worth watching even if they don't entirely work. If you're expecting something like the joyful sequence set to David Bowie's When I Live My Dream in Boy Meets Girl you'll be bitterly disappointed: this is a joyless film that wanders into unintentional self-parody without ever providing much to smile about. This is self-conscious Miserablism in the classic tradition.

It starts out as glacially classical French film-making before moving more into better photographed nouvelle vague with all the usual clich&eacute;s - self-indulgent disaffected hero (Guillaume Depardieu) flirting with ill-defined violent politics in the pursuit of an equally ill-defined truth while constantly lying to himself; utterly hopeless leading lady (Katerina Golubeva) that either producer or director wants to have sex with delivering a pitifully bad and painfully stilted performance; 'daring' unsimulated sex scene (albeit featuring body doubles); clumsy symbolism and a bleak-chic ending you don't need to have read the book to see coming. There's an interesting note of criticism in the anti-hero's search for truth in poverty and his need to increasingly create a fiction to support his self-image (he persuades his sister to pose as his wife and his fianc&eacute; to pose as his sister and while desperate for money constantly refuses to touch the money he and his family have) and it earns Brownie points for its attitude to racism in France, but it's not quite enough. Jacques Rivette declared it the best French film of the last ten years, but I guess that just implies he doesn't see many French films these days.",1201046400,7,1889,5.296666666666667
