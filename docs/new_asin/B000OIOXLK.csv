8185355,1,B000OIOXLK,Seller did good job...arrived right on time like they usually do from them. The DVD Set is the original 'Why We Fight' series in a beautiful new package with professional presentation and decent quality DVDs. SAVE YOUR $$$. It's the same Army documentaries that we have all seen several times...they just didn't call it 'Why We Fight' so you would think it was something new...not something that was made in 1942 - 1945. The set is one big rip-off - it is not the sellers fault..the chicken $#%^ that produced it just wanted to sell something under a new name and didn't have the cajones to admit it.,1404691200,,600,4.564814814814815
