5125086,5,B0083SJFYS,"So this may be considered filler and it is pretty short but I really enjoyed this season. I'm actually surprised that they put as many episodes as they did into this set, but its honestly a really enjoyable season.

Once again these episodes leave the main arc in Hueco Mundo but this is not the same as other filler. In this set we get to see the story of the Vizards and how they became what they are in the present. The set takes place about a hundred years in the past and really delves into Kisuke Urahara's back story. There are a lot of appearances by various Soul Reapers, including Hisagi, Byakuya, Gin, and Aizen.  Its an interesting story of intrigue, betrayal, and how the Soul Society is run.

After episode 213 we get a couple episodes about Kon...great. They are just run of the mill comic relief fillers and they are entertaining to a degree. I don't really like Kon so the two episodes really weren't for me.

At 215 sort of return to the main arc. The Arrancar start their attack on the world of the living and are met by Soul Reapers. The lieutenants start fighting lower level Arrancars and Ichigo continues his fight in Hueco Mundo. They are really great episodes but this set doesn't get very far into them before it stops.

In short the filler in the middle is annoying and the last episodes are a build-up that will pay off in the next set. However, the reason I plan on buying this is the episodes at the beginning where we get to learn some of the back story on the Vizards and Soul Reapers. The price has been talked to death so again I will not speak on it. The episodes in this themselves are great and well worth the watch.",1338163200,20,1653,4.336569579288026

5125208,4,B0083SJFYS,"Long ago, Kisuke Urahara was the former captain of the 12th Division and the founder of the Shinigami Research and Development Institute and Tessai Tsukabishi was the Captain of the Kido Corps in the Soul Society.

But many have wondered how and why Urahara was exiled to the human world.  And with the episodes featured in  ""Bleach DVD Set Fourteen - Original and Uncut"", all is revealed!

So, what is ""Bleach""?

""Bleach"" is one of those titles, alongside ""Naruto"" and ""Dragon Ball Z"" that has managed to capture the attention of anime fans and continues to reinvent itself with new sagas and characters. Created in 2001 by mangaka Tite Kubo, the manga has been published on Weekly Shonen Jump and the animated series has been airing on Japanese television since 2004.

The series has manged to grow its fandom worldwide, especially in the US as the series has aired on television on the Cartoon Network and the various video games for the Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS and the Sony PSP have also been popular among the fans as well.

The manga series revolves around teenager Ichigo Kurosaki, who has the ability to see Soul Reapers (a military group that escorts the souls of the dead) and in this case, Ichigo has seen a female Soul Reaper named Rukia Kuchiki. One day, a hollow (a monster that was once a human soul) has come to attack and when Rukia was injured, she transferred her spirit pressure to Ichigo in order for him to fight the hollow.

The series focused on Ichigo and Rukia's friendship as somehow nearly all her spirit pressure had been transferred to Ichigo and stripping away her soul reaper power and thus Ichigo now has the power to take on the hollows while Rukia helps guide him through the battles with her knowledge. As Rukia temporarily lives with Ichigo, the two together battle hollows.

Meanwhile, in the Soul Society, they learn that a traitor was in their midst and it was revealed the traitor was Fifth Division Captain Sosuke Aizen along with Ninth Division Captain Kaname Tosen and Third Division captain Gin Ichimaru.

It was learned that Aizen was experimenting illegally with hundreds of Shinigami and Rukongai in order to create a new powerful Hogokyu (a blue orb that can dissolve the boundaries between shinigami and hollows and allowing one to attain the powers of the other).  And for Aizen, his goal is to create the perfect Arrancar.

In season six, Aizen unleashed his army of Arrancars against the Soul Reapers.  The Arrancars have the power of the Soul Reaper, have a weapon similar to a Zanpakuto and intelligence beyond a normal hollow.  Where a Zanpakuto is a manifestation of owner's soul, for the Arrancars, it is a manifestation of its former self.  And the strongest members of the Arrancar are known as the Espada.

This leads us to the 11th season of ""Bleach"" in Japan, which was a short season that is a flashback arc that show us the past of Kisuke Urahara and the creation of the Visoreds.

110 years ago, the Soul Society was comprised with different captains.  Shinji Hirao was the Fifth Division Captain and working under him was lieutenant Sosuke Aizen.  There is news that a new Twelfth Division Captain is being hired and it was recommended by Yoruichi Shihoin that Kisuke Urahara to be the new Captain.

But while Urahara is gifted with mysterious talents, his blunt and loudmouthed liutenant Hiyori Sarugaki is not to happy with his appointment as Captain.  Seeing Urahara as lazy and weak, she can't believe that he is the new Captain and when she goes to attack him, she is shocked that her kicks misses him in the head and so quick, that he makes everyone think that she had hit him perfectly, when in fact, she had missed and then put himself in a position to get kicked afterward.

As Hiori learns from her new Captain, she is taken to the Maggots Nest, a holding area for people who may be too dangerous for the Soul Society.  And he explains about the development of the Technological Research Bureau that he had created.  Urahara hires a young Mayuri Kurotsuchi to be his second in command at the bureau.  Meanwhile, a young boy in the Fifth Division has moved up and his name is Gin Ichimaru, who impresses Aizen with his abilities.

Fast forward nine years later, and there are three shadowed figures watching the Rukongai and many of its citizens begin disappearing.  Ninth Division Kensei Muguruma and his group go to investigate and see a gigantic hollow attacking a group of kids, one is a younger Shuhei Hisagi (which answers the question of why grown up Shuhei has numbers on him). Hiyori of the Twelfth Division is also sent to check on the disappearances of the Rukongai citizens.

As the investigation continues through the night, the Ninth Division is slaughtered except Captain Kensei and when he sees his attackers, he is shocked.  Their troubling deaths lead the Soul Society to send the the Kido Corps (featuring Captain and Lieutenants of different divisions) to investigate the matter.

But it is quickly revealed when the Kido Corps is dismantled of who the perpetrator is....Aizen, Ichimaru and Tosen.  It is learned that Aizen is practicing hollowfication and discovering his motives are Kisuke Urahara and Captain Tessai Tsukabishi.  And using his Zanpakuto, is able to make people think that the ones responsible are Kisuke and Tessai.

As the two are shocked by their order of lifetime imprisonment for practicing hollowfication and killing their fellow members of the Soul Society, Yoruichi manages to break both men out of the area but also taking the bodies of the hollowfied Kido Corps to a special area.  And Urahara's new goal is to find a way to undo the hollowfication.

And now, taking us to present time, where the members of the Kido Corps have now become Visored (Vizard), Soul Reapers who have obtained hollow powers.

This storyline then transitions to Season 12 known as part four of the ""Arrancar Battle"".  A storyline which continues to showcase the Soul Reapers vs. the Arrancars and Aizen's goal to use Karakura to invade and destroy the Soul Society.

VIDEO:

If there is one thing that I've always enjoyed about ""Bleach"" is that for a TV series that is cranked out in Japan, the TV series features a good amount of detail in the background art. The series tends to really showcase quite a bit of locations and thus, not always reusing scenes.

Also, the character designs, despite not always being detailed, is shown great care by character designer Masashi Kudo who definitely respects the original illustrations of Tite Kubo. Some closeups are really well done and there is a good amount of focus on the actual animation during the battle sequences.

For a TV series, especially knowing how in Japan, many of these studios tend to crank them out because they have other deadlines taking on other series, ""Bleach"" continues to look very good.

As for picture quality, of course on DVD, you are going to see some softness, banding and edge enhancement but for the most part, picture quality is very good on DVD.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Bleach DVD Set Fourteen - Original and Uncut"" is presented in stereo English and Japanese. Both dialogue tracks are clear and understandable. For those with a modern receiver may want to set their setting to stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Bleach DVD Set Fourteen - Original and Uncut"" comes with the following special features:

  Production Art - Using your remote, you can view ""Bleach"" production art.
  Clean Ending - The clean ending theme.
  Omake - (2:43) The ending omake for episodes 206-217.

JUDGMENT CALL""

For longtime ""Bleach"" fans, ""Bleach DVD Set Fourteen - Original and Uncut"" is a significant volume as it features the origin of Kisuke Urahara as a Captain of the Soul Society but also introduces us to a group of characters, former Captains and Lieutenants who would eventually become a group know as the Visoreds.  And since I'm reading the manga series, which is ahead of the series, I can easily tell you that this storyline plays a major importance as the Visoreds are very key into the Aizen saga and also Ichigo Kurosaki's development of his powers.

But the volume also shows us the first reveal of when the Soul Society became suspicious of Aizen but also the first time Ichimaru and Tosen became traitors but were able to successfully pin their crimes on Kisuke Urahara and Tessai Tsukaibishi and also learning how Yoruichi was also involved as an accomplice.

""Bleach DVD Set Fourteen - Original and Uncut"" features the complete eleventh season that aired in Japan back in 2009 and also contains the first few episodes of the twelfth season which is leading to another epic battle between the Soul Reapers and the Espada.

While there are filler episodes in this volume, fortunately the filler episodes are fun to watch.  Including one that includes Ichigo's friends in sentai outfits.  But the main storyline is the Urahara/Visored storyline that is fascinating and a storyline that should satisfy fans of ""Bleach"" who wondered why Urahara and Tessai are staying in the human world and why the two including Yoruichi were seen as enemy of the Soul Reapers earlier on in the series.  But no doubt, these Visoreds are going to play an important part in the series to come.

Overall, ""Bleach DVD Set Fourteen - Original and Uncut"" is another action-packed and enjoyable volume for ""Bleach"" fans. But one that answers questions in regards to Urahara's past.  For those hoping to see more Ichigo and friends, unfortunately, you're not going to get that with this volume.  But if you are a ""Bleach"" fan, you should be satisfied with this 14th DVD set overall.

5125213,5,B0083SJFYS,"I love Bleach, but like most everyone else I'm tired of all the extra crap they use to take up space. This DVD set takes us back to the beginning of the madness caused by Aizen. He was only a lieutenant at the time. He started his hollow experiments. Shinji and the other visords became his victims. We also see how Kisuke and Yoruichi became outcasts as well. This is a very interesting arc for a change. After that there are a few episodes where Kon plays at being a power ranger or something equally retarded, and finally the battle with Aizen and his Aspada begins in the fake Karakura town. I may be speaking too soon, but I think were on the verge of seeing the really important stuff. I enjoyed this DVD set and I'm looking forward to set 15 and the 4th movie in December.",1349481600,,779,4.27027027027027
5125214,3,B0083SJFYS,"I know alot of people are complaining about the prices of the bleach dvd sets, but what alot of you don't remember is when they used to to release the series in single dvds seperately with only 3 to 4 episodes on a dvd for about $20-$25.  This was even true for other animes in the past, it wasn't until later that a series was released in a whole box set with a cheaper price.  I know only 12 episodes a box set for around $30-$35 doesn't seem like a good deal especially when they first started to release the box sets of bleach which were around 20 episodes or more for the same price, but they also stopped releasing them in the single dvd and started to just sell them in box sets, so I think this is a happy medium for Viz.

My only complaint with Viz is how they are releasing the format of the bleach anime.  Episodes 1-168 were done in the 4:3 or standard defintion.  Episodes 169 and then on were done in the 16:9 or widescreen format.  But it seems Viz wants to keep the english dub version in its 4:3 standard even after episode 169.  This leads to the episodes getting cropped off and sacrificing quality and not getting the whole picture.  This becomes espcially apparent at the beginning of the anime when they are showing the episode's number and at the end of it with the words ""to be continued"" be cropped or cut off.  I hope they correct this flaw in the future.

I have noticed that they are releasing episodes digitally via the playstation store through the PS3 and it seems that they are up to the point of having the lastest episodes that air on adult swim on cartoon network shortly after.  You can also purchase either the SD or HD version of the show starting with season 16 and after.  I hope they make this option availible for physical copies like bluray in the near future, especially seeing how the Bleach moives, Fade to Black and the Hell Chapter have bluray options availible in the ntsc region.",1348185600,14,1929,4.342618384401114
5125215,1,B0083SJFYS,"Selling just a few (relatively speaking) episodes at a time for the price this is being offered for is nothing more than a money-grabbing excercise.

Avoid this until you can get the entire season in 1 box set.

It's a great series. But that does not justify the costs associated with purchasing it in piecemail fashion. Given the amount of ""partial"" season releases one must purchase, it easily costs twice as much as waiting and buying the complete season.",1347926400,4,458,4.784810126582278
