7853698,4,6303698433,"What in this movie is anticipated? The coal-black complexion of Natalie Cole? The fact that she is the staring actress? (I kept waiting for her to break out in song.) Is it the bond the white child forms with his parents' servant? How quickly the mother of the child turns on this servant who is 'just like a member of the family?' Where Lily goes when trouble is suspected? How the boy reacts when he finds out? Her true relationship with family members? The eventual outcome of compounding transgressions?

Not much of what you see is expected. The fact that Natalie portrays an uneducated Southerner neutralizes anticipation for a dramatic performance with enough surprises to make the whole lesson in family ties worthwhile viewing.

(Natalie Cole has an unrelated album called ""Take a Look."" Interestingly, every song title has something to do with this movie.)",1115424000,3,866,4.9655172413793105
