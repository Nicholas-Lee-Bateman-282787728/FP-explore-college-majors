8730973,5,B014JD2KI8,"Best of cinematic scores in the backyard of one of the best European cities, played by the best orchestra in the world. What more can you ask for? Note that songs played catered to a gen X audience. So if you are a millennial, there might only be a couple of familiar themes.",1517616000,,275,4.2075471698113205
8730974,3,B014JD2KI8,"This is a review of the blu ray version of this concert which, at this writing, is not listed on the Amazon website.  As with all previous Waldbuhne concerts the disk is technically excellent.  The sound is vivid with a large dynamic range and there is minimal to no outside noise.  The color is lovely particularly the transition from daylight to darkness.  I was not thrilled by the music selections, but other reviewers were more enthusiastic.  It think it is hard to make a coherent piece from the fragments of sound required of a movie soundtrack.  In a few cases composers have gone back and created suites based on a soundtrack they have written -- I have heard some beautiful works by John Williams.  However for this concert I felt that the very large, usually excellent Berliner Philharmoniker was not nimble enough to pull this off.",1513641600,,843,4.732876712328767
8730975,5,B014JD2KI8,"I have been collecting Berliner Philharmoniker DVD's for some years now. I had thought for some time that this orchestral ensemble had personality and this particular performance displays that personality superbly! This is a totally ""non classical"" program, but, as another reviewer notes, the requirements for successfully composing high quality film music are such that comparisons to traditional classical compositions should be carefully weighed. Many of these compositions deserve just as much respect and reverence as their classical counterparts. And the examples performed here really demonstratively emphasize that view. These selections are no less demanding upon the player's skills than anything in the classical repertoire. The orchestra and conductor have fun, the audience has fun and the viewer of this excellent DVD will have fun!",1503792000,,847,5.784

8730977,5,B014JD2KI8,"The performance captured on this Blu-ray, which I received a review copy of, starts off with a bang with the 20th Century Fox fanfare by Alfred Newman. And then it never lets up.

Since its an open-air concert at the Waldbuhne in Berlin, as usual the program consists of popular, easily accessible works, this time from the movies. Theres no reason for anyone to look down their noses at the commercial work, unendingly melodic and expertly crafted, of serious composers who fled Europe for Hollywood and contributed so much to what we now think of as the golden age of cinema. Several of those composers are featured here, along with the one who has so successfully carried their torch to the present day, John Williams.

The disc contains little more than an hour of music (especially when you deduct Berliner Luft, the traditional closer for these concerts), but whats here is choice. What a luxury to have the Berlin Philharmonic, arguably the best orchestra in the world, playing this music with great enthusiasm and respect but without a trace of stodginess or undue reverence.

Theres no need for me to relist the works on the disc, since on this Amazon page you can see a photo of the back of the case. I will add, however, that the three segments from Korngolds Robin Hood score form a mini-suite and there are two segments from Rozsas Ben-Hur.

The Tom and Jerry piece by the lesser-known Scott Bradley might not initially seem to fit in, but its highly sophisticated, and it gives the Berlin Philharmonic an opportunity to show that it can swing like a jazz band. Hard to imagine the Vienna Philharmonic doing this!

The 1080i full HD image is very good, and the 5.1 DTS-HD sound (youll want to switch from the PCM stereo default) is perfect. I heard details in the orchestrations that I had never noticed before due to the clarity of textures. The strings, in particular, sound luscious, which is exactly what you want for these pieces.

There remains much to be mined in the classic film score genre. Here's hoping the Berlin Philharmonic takes a page from today's sequel-crazed movie industry and eventually offers us a follow-up.",1475193600,,2144,4.765498652291105
8730978,5,B014JD2KI8,"This disc, recorded in HD at the 2015 Waldbuhne concert differs from most of the others in the series by being entirely made up of non-classical repertoire. That is not in any way supposed to be a derogative judgement, just a descriptive observation. It is no secret that writing good film music is an art form requiring high levels of musical and technical skill on the part of the composer additionally combined with dramatic sensitivity and is not to be underestimated.

This disc delivers a range of such music all of which is played with evident enjoyment by both conductor and orchestra and at a high level of proficiency. The music from Tom and Jerry is clearly very demanding and incorporates many unusual and fun extra ingredients. It proves to be completely engrossing and entertaining for both performers and audience alike. Other pieces such as the Big Country and Star Wars deliver strongly on the epic and others focus on more romantic expression. All in all there is something here for most cinematic tastes with varied music taken from a quite a wide range of cinematic eras and genres.

Technically this recording offers high quality visuals and sound. The sound is provided in both DTS Master 5.1 as well as stereo. The visuals are inclusive of the audience reactions and the sound does not suffer from being an open-air event while not being the same as a controlled studio sound. This is one of the most successful recordings of this rather extensive series so far. Indeed it is arguably the best yet but that will be a matter of personal preference.

Comparisons are frequently odious but in this case the unique nature of the program and the venue make comparisons impossible to make and therefore irrelevant.

This disc deserves to be much sought after by fans of film music and the Waldbuhne concerts.",1450742400,5,1825,4.821086261980831
8730979,5,B014JD2KI8,"First, see I. Giles's review of what appears to be the same item:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waldbuhne-2015-Berliner-Philharmoniker-Sir-Simon-Rattle-EUROARTS-Blu-ray/dp/B017C58R50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waldbuhne 2015 [Berliner Philharmoniker ,Sir Simon Rattle ] [EUROARTS: Blu-ray</a>]. I fully agree that this is a must-have for fans of the Berlin Philharmonic, Waldbuhne concerts, and film music. In addition to the thrill of hearing one of the world's greatest orchestras giving this music as good performances as it is ever likely to get, the Berliners really let their hair down for this one. All kinds of weird and wonderful things happen back in the percussion section (joined by a violist, of all people) for the Tom and Jerry music; and the horn section decks themselves out appropriately for the music of Indiana Jones and Star Wars. Great fun! Brilliant picture and sound, of course.

(Note: for any of you who may have seen the original concert, the Grieg Concerto with Lang Lang is not contained on this disc. Also, presumably at some point Amazon will correct the timing, which is not 135 minutes, but rather a shade under 74--the official time listed on the cover is 73 minutes.)",1450656000,7,1247,5.7405405405405405
