7946107,4,B00005N5RE,"Why is it so easy to see the injustices of the penal system of other countries in other times but so hard to do anything about our own? In the future, perhaps some of what are in the present considered to be ""crimes"" will be obsolete. But I digress. This miniseries from Australia was very well-made, and the performances are very good. I do think that the billing was a bit misleading. The star is Colin Friels. Anthony Perkins is listed first, but he is more of a guest star, his screen time is only about half an hour. Still, this is a welcome addition to my collection.",1359417600,,573,4.314814814814815
7946108,5,B00005N5RE,Saw this mini series many years ago and enjoyed it very much.  Was glad to come across it finally on DVD.,1299110400,,105,4.0
7946109,3,B00005N5RE,"Although dated with a mildly cheesy script we found it enjoyable enough for even the teenage kids asking for the next disc.

The transfer is grainy but not to off putting. Although the cover shows what would appear to be a head line production for Anthony Perkins he only appears much later in the film.",1179273600,3,303,4.509090909090909
7946110,5,B00005N5RE,"Great job. Anyone who read the book would know there is no way to do the whole thing on screen, but what a terrific job they did. I think even a novice would still understand the movie without the insider knowledge left out from the book.",1175126400,4,238,4.195652173913044
7946111,5,B00005N5RE,Colin Friels is probably less known or acclaimed internationally than his wife Judy Davis. His effort in this miniseries though early in his career should have him right up there equally recognized. A great story and a miniseries collectable.,1165017600,5,242,5.230769230769231
7946112,5,B00005N5RE,"I saw this on TV, here in Australia a long time ago and only recently again on Pay TV and have straight away placed it in my shopping cart. It is the magnificent story of an Englishman who after learning he is the barstard son of another man is disinherited. He is then falsely accused of the murder of his true father and the theft of a watch and sent to a Penal colony in Van Diemen's Land (Now Tasmania) for the term of his natural life. It shows his struggle for freedom against the tyranny of British rule and countless altercations with other prisoners and a particular Prison officer. He saves the life of the Commandents daughter, but is tricked and sent back to prison. He strives for freedom and a possible return to England so he can reunite with his mother. It is a long program over 5hrs, possibly best watched over a couple of nights. Though if you're like me won't be able to turn it off.",1110240000,6,903,4.317647058823529
7946113,3,B00005N5RE,"This is adapted from a book written in the 1800's. It was considered a strong novel about the bad state of prisons. It is about a prisoner who is innocent, but his whole life, is accoused of killing another person. The film seems less severe than the book. As more sad things happen in the book. So get your hankey's out, it's a tear-jerker...",998524800,6,343,4.375
