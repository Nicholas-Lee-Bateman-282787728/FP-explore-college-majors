698203,5,6303651453,"James Bond,and Sean Connery's career,were off to a running start with the very excellent ""Dr. No."" The title character,a deformed agent of the terrorist organization SPECTRE, has plans to sabotage the USA's space  program.  When he has two British agents murdered for getting too clse, Her  Majesty's Secret Service is tipped off and Bond is dispatched to get the  facts.  Aided by his friend Felix Leiter, an American agent (portrayed  quite well by Jack Lord), Bond takes on Dr. No, meeting luscious Honey  Ryder along the way (Ursula Andress, the first of the famed Bond Girls).  Broadway actor Joseph Wiseman gives a flawless, critically acclaimed  performance as the sinister Dr. No, making him one of the best villains in  the series.  Along with ""Goldfinger"" and ""From Russia, with  Love,"" this film is one of the top three in the Bond series.",911347200,4,850,4.950354609929078
698358,5,6303651453,"Even the earliest Bond films still stand the test of time.  These look fantastic on Blu Ray.  I would probably buy one of the boxed sets, if you don't already have some of the other Bond movies on Blu Ray format.  It would be less expensive and you would save space by purchasing an all inclusive package. But, if you are just buying individual titles in order to fill the gaps and upgrade your collection, I would wait until around the holidays where these single re-issues are likely to be on sale and you can snatch up several titles for cheap.",1506384000,,547,4.396039603960396

698360,4,6303651453,"Ian Fleming's books were selling on both sides of the pond before being made into movies.  In 1960,  a Canadian producer Harry Saltzman set out to make film adaptations of the books, with co-producer Cubby Broccoli.  Dr.  No was the first feature film.  The talent search for the leading man passed over male models.  The spy that landed the role of James Bond with the second most 007 movies to date was Sean Connery.  Sean Connery has been called ""a common Bond,"" starring in a total of six 007 films.

Without any real spoilers,  Dr. No  was set and filmed in Fleming's beloved Jamaica and at studios in Britain.  The scenery around Kingston, Jamaica and its beaches are quite picturesque.

James Bond is up against an evil Chinese villain,  Dr. No,  who has a very advanced Island lair.  Appropriately,  though I don't want to reveal the plot in this first bond film, viewers are introduced to SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion) of which Dr. No is a member.  This crime conglomerate will be a fixture in subsequent bond films.  While I really enjoyed this 007 film, it is not a favorite.",1503360000,,1142,4.769230769230769

698363,3,6303651453,"Decided to watch all of the James Bond films in order. For some it will be a revisit, others a first time viewing. This is the typical over-the-top 1960s action  subtlety is nonexistent. Sean Connery is not my favorite Bond, but he's quite funand somehow perfect for the super-misogynistic, unintentionally-racist debut of the franchise.",1500508800,,337,5.2407407407407405
698364,5,6303651453,"The very first film adaption of the 007 James Bond series, Dr. No. It is based on the 6th Bond novel ever released, the first 007 novel is actually Casino Royale (1953). This movie stars the legendary Sean Connery who plays the role of a British spy agent known as James Bond.
First time I watched it... I loved it right away because whether James Bond meets Honey Ryder for the first time, how far technology and 007 movie adaptations have progressed over the years, or when Bond is on the hunt to eliminate Dr. No, you can't go wrong with the classics.

I have a good feeling that I'll be collecting the rest of the Bond movies on both Blu-ray and DVD as a hardcore collector in me. Legacy.",1498608000,,692,4.323076923076923

698430,5,6303651453,"Dr. No (1962) is the first ever James Bond movie, and lays the foundation for future great Bond movies. This movie has a little bit of everything, from action to suspense to romance, etc. Throw in a memorable villain and Bond girl, and you have the perfect concoction for a very good springboard of the franchise. Honey Ryder is one of my favorite Bond girls, and her first appearance (coming out of the ocean) is one of the most iconic moments in Hollywood. Even though the pacing of this debut movie is a tad slower, and the high tech gadgetry wasn't quite there yet, I was never bored, because the plot is interesting, and the characters likewise. This is easily one of the greatest Bond movies of the franchise. This blu ray features an excellent restoration, with a crystal clear picture. The sound, however (not an unusual problem for older movies) requires some volume adjustment at times, but it's probably just easier to keep the volume a tad higher so you don't have to make adjustments. The special features are nice to have as well. Overall, Dr. No is a big YES for me, and should be essential to anyone who's a casual or die-hard fan of the franchise.",1482192000,,1164,4.574162679425838

A few spins into danger zone and it is all over.. lol. I would think they'd had put a metal block in there to prevent it going past danger. Why would you ever want it in danger zone.

Still Ursula Andress was great but Sean Connery was really very good as a secret agent. Albeit not what ian fleming originally imagined, he did a phenomenal job and set it up for the rest.",1480118400,,517,4.222222222222222

698731,5,6303651453,"This is an incredible film, and yes, it's the one that started it all. If you seek the essence of ""Bond,"" at least in his cinematic form, then this is your required viewing (along with Goldfinger). Be warned, though: Dr. No is somewhat offensive to mainstream values, as it was (though less so) upon its original release. Whether you like this aspect or not, however, the iconic film has become well-settled in the pantheon of classic cinema and been woven deeply into popular culture across the globe.

About the film itself. Like other Bond films, the pacing in Dr. No is slow. Although there is a lot of action, it is action buried within scenes replete with chic imagery of sex, power, money, and masculinity (in a particular sense). Some of the lines in the script, like the one I've quoted in my headline, are devastatingly effective, and you will find a sense of pleasure in rehearing them, should you decide to watch the film again. Sean Connery is perfect in the role, and even the bit parts, like John Strangways in the beginning, are cast well. And, of course, there's the shell diver.",1479772800,3,1096,4.649484536082475

Besides the rampant sexist quality that underpins Bond's role, there is another adjective that defines the film: hokey. In places, the lack of technological sophistication reminded me of early episodes of another famous doctor, Dr. Who. And somehow, Sean Connery had not yet developed the debonair quality that defined his later character. Still, despite the superfluous presence of a rather cold Ursula Andress, the film plods along to provide a mildly satisfying experience. 3 stars.",1478908800,2,608,5.151515151515151

I think that Sean Connery gets better in future 007. In Dr No, he rushes lines and the action doesn't stand up to today's thrillers. My biggest complaint and the reason for a mediocre rating is the sound. You will need to set your volume level pretty high to hear the dialogue but when background music or dubbed in sounds occur, it will be way too loud. But we want to see the James Bond series and this is where you have to start. I suspect that anyone reading this will do the same thing. Let's hope that going forward with the series that the sound problem gets taken care of. I know that Sean Connery gets better. Also, no Q in Dr. No. Which Bond movie does he make his first appearance?",1461456000,,866,4.191616766467066

Some say it's okay but doesn't compare to some other high points of the series, while some say it's nothing worth writing home about. The bottoms line is - this is where it all starts. I feel there is a ride that this episode of Bond offers which has some element repeated only in the rebooting that occurred in Casino Royale. It is in Dr. No that Sean is discovering the character of Bond and where so many elements of the series are first introduced. Above all the location of Jamaica for me will always spell the adventure that being a part of a Bond story involves. The getting away from it all resonates in Bond rolling his sleeves up in the backdrop of the beautiful-exotic Caribbean. In Dr. No I feel you get a gritty Bond that sets the tone of what follows in Sean's portrayal of the character, yet also the only movie you have Bond singing which also makes him real-believable-human. In my book it's a unique movie, a special movie.",1459641600,,1018,4.420212765957447

701321,5,6303651453,"A few weeks ago, I decided to actually go and read the series of original James Bond novels written by Ian Fleming out of a long held curiosity to see how the literary originals compared to the later EON movie productions. While Dr. No was not the first of the Fleming books, it was the first movie, and as such, I think did perhaps the best job of capturing Fleming's vision of Bond on the big screen. The original Bond books do not have a lot of fancy gadgetry or a lot of ""double entendre"" dialog, but remain compelling nonetheless. I felt that Dr. No stayed fairly true to the author's vision of Bond, and just enjoyed this cinema version, (seeing it with a new perspective), in a new way. Now having read a number of Fleming's books, it is hard to imagine anyone other than Sean Connery as 007, even if I admire Daniel Craig's rendition of a more ""modern"" take on Bond. While the premise of most Bond films can be a bit outlandish, I thought Dr. No was a good story, and quite frankly, just good entertainment. I think this movie can now be considered a minor classic, and more than fulfilled that ambition of bringing Mr. Bond to the big screen in a very memorable way.",1454284800,11,1175,4.345454545454546

701419,5,6303651453,"Dr. No  is much better than I remember.  After watching it recently on a HULU Bond Marathon.  I was surprised how good the film is.  I grew up during the Roger Moore era of Bond.  As a kid Roger's films were more exciting, but as I grew older to an adult I truly believe that Sean Connery is the best James Bond.  I used to see You Only Live Twice and Thunderball all the time but never really had a chance to see this film all the way through.  I don't remember it coming on TV that often when I was younger.

Dr. No is probably the only Bond film that had eluded me.  I have seen every movie in the franchise until finally seeing the first film.  James makes smart moves throughout the film.  It seemed like as soon as he landed in Jamaica someone was trying to do him in.  I loved the lines he had with his superior M about getting rid of his old gun or else be assigned to desk duty.  I also enjoyed watching him in the hotel room rigging the briefcase and the closet with a strand of hair.  Later when he came back to the hotel I kept thinking some kind of goon or thug would burst from the closet when Bond noticed someone had tampered with his room.  I thought the dragon scenes were pretty corny and silly but hey the rest of the film works very well.  I loved seeing Bond take care of the assassins.  I am sure few people remember that he actually drove what looked like a Thunderbird for his first car cameo instead of the Austin Martin.  It seemed like James did not really know who to trust outside of Felix Leiter of the CIA.

I think the film has aged very well.  I would rate the movie 4 to 5 stars.  While watching the film, I felt like I did not want to miss a single moment for fear of some detail I might miss.  Dr. No is more of a spy/detective movie with very few gadgets and more common sense.  I would definitely recommend the movie to any Bond fan.  It helps to turn up the volume because some of the dialog seemed to be at a very low volume.  Definitely a nice debut film for our favorite secret agent.",1450137600,,2027,4.058080808080808

701721,2,6303651453,"Dr. No was the very first Bond film to be produced, way back in 1962. Dr. No is actually the 6th novel by Ian Fleming, but this was Bonds first dive onto the big screen. This was also my first introduction to Sean Connery as Bond.

We start off with the iconic theme song, a fantastic and famous riff that once in your head, never leaves.  The Bond franchise is all about its amazing title sequences, and this one is veryodd. Its colored dots, almost like a disco dancefloor, followed by silhouettes of people dancing, which has no connection to the plot. It does, of course, use the first 'bullet through the barrel' shot, which is an iconic visual from the series.

The story is very straight-forward for what I am used to in Bond films. Dr. No controls a remote island off of Jamaica, and wants to launch some rockets to take over the world, blah blah blah. There are very little twists and turns here. It honestly doesnt feel like a spy movie, it feels more like a detective movie. An hour into Dr. No, I wasbored. The age of the movie is definitely felt during night scenes (clearly filmed during the day using filters) and driving screens, using video screens. The director doesnt add much to the film, most camera shots are static and boring.

There are some important Bond-isms that are introduced for the first time in Dr. No. Bonds skirt chasing proclivities, his martini, and his gun, to name a few. The Bond Girl with a ridiculous name (Honey Ryder) is played by Ursula Andress, who looks fantastic in her role. The scene where she emerges from the water in her white bikini is iconic, and was the yard stick by which all other Bond girls were measured. Connery was smooth as hell as Bond, and its easy to see why he was so successful in the role. He oozes sexuality and just looks powerful. The titular villain isn't very interesting. One thing that wasn't here that I missed were the gadgets Im so used to seeing in 007 movies. Not one to be found.

I didn't like Dr. No. Although I understand that it was an important film in the Bond canon and it introduced a ton of 007 traditions, but I personally found it pretty boring.

701723,3,6303651453,"Dr. No, 1962 film

The film begins with three blind men crossing a street [without help?]. Inside a club four men play cards. One man leaves, he is shot dead by his car! A hearse drives up and picks up the body. [W6N is not a valid call letter for Jamaica.] Those three men enter Strangway's house to steal his file after silencing the secretary. MI6 is alerted. There is a high-class gambling casino in London. James Bond wins then leaves for his office. [Note the double door to M's office.] American missile tests have been sabotaged by radio beams from the Jamaica area. Bond will soon leave for Jamaica with a Walther 7.65mm PPK in place of his 6.35mm Beretta. At home he finds a surprise! ""Almost immediately."" At Jamaica Bond finds a car waiting. Is it a trap? A man watches Bond then follows him. Bond's driver won't talk.

Bond inspects Strangway's house. He finds a receipt for a bill. Bond learns about Strangway's recent past. He talks to Quarrel about a fishing trip. There is a nasty surprise! Felix Leitner introduces himself. They talk. There is a surprise from a free-lance photographer. She doesn't talk. Crab Key has a bauxite mine and a bad reputation. Prof. Dent tested some rocks for Strangway. Later Dent rushes to Crab Key. An armed guard at the dock meets him. Dent gets his orders from Dr. No. Bond returns to his room. That night a spider walks on his bed. The files on Dr. No are missing! Bond has a new toy to test rocks. Later he gets an invitation to a home in the mountains. On the way her is followed by a Packard hearse. There is a fiery accident. Bond arrives and gets close to that woman. He calls for a car, then searches her house. He prepares for a visitor who talks and then goes silent.

That night Bond visits Crab Key with Quarrel. In them morning he sees a young woman collecting shells. They talk. They hear the sound of high-powered boat. A machine gun sprays bullets on the beach. Honey tells about the dragon. They hide under water from the dogs. A straggler is eliminated. They see tracks in the sand. Honey tells about her past. ""Did I do wrong?"" That night they see the dragon and are captured after a fight. They are washed down to remove radiation. Next they are greeted and shown their rooms. Free coffee? At night a man visits when they are asleep. [Note their style of clothes.] Dr. No visits them. [Note the Goya portrait of the Duke of Wellington!] Dr. No tells about his past. The conversation is polite. Dr. No talks about SPECTRE and his plans. ""I never fail.""

Bond is ""softened up"" then jailed. But he has a plan to escape into the bowels of the ventilation system. He sees the operation. A nuclear reactor produces power. A man turns the power level into the danger zone! Dr. No has lost his grip! The sabotage has failed. People scurry about to escape as in an unplanned fire drill. Bond frees Honey and they hijack a small motor boat to escape. Crab Key explodes like a small volcano. Later the boat is towed to safety. Another mission accomplished.

This was the first of a long series of ""James Bond"" movies that ran for the next five decades with various actors portraying Ian Fleming's fictional operative. The books are usually better than the movie. The real life Dusko Popov (""Spy Counterspy"") was the model for James Bond. No movie has been made from his autobiography. It looks as if Ursula Andress' voice was doubled for this movie. The hidden agenda for this story was the menace of Communist China in the Caribbean! Bauxite ore produces aluminum, the other product from Jamaica besides sugar.",1431043200,,3570,4.537267080745342

701836,5,6303651453,"I watched Dr No many years ago, and my impression at that time was that it was a pretty dull film, and not the REAL launch of the Bond series, which at that time I suppose was usually considered to be Goldfinger. Now that I'm re-watching the Bond films, I find I like Goldfinger less (and I certainly didn't enjoy Diamonds Are Forever), and am now actually more interested in less flashy fare like From Russia With Love and this one, Dr No, the filmed Bond that started it all (mainly...).

The film is out of sorts in many senses, with an awful, dotty opening title sequence that hardly has a single silhouette of a nude woman; it also lacks the pre-credits sequence, and the title track shifts gears quickly to play a twee Jamaican number about three blind mice. We get to see Bond slowly (nearly as slowly as in George Lazeby's Bond, when he's shifting into Sean Connery's well-worn shoes), and the immortal line ""Bond... James Bond"", uttered at near-subsonic frequencies for ultimate coolness. After a casino dalliance, Bond is briefed by M and a certain ""Major Boothroyd"" (named after a real-life munitions expert who gave Ian Fleming advice, but who was later replaced as a character by Desmond Llewelyn as Q), who reprimands Bond for using a Beretta, forcing him to sling a Walther PPK and generally treating him like a child. Oooo-kay... Bond travels to Jamaica and engages in some heavy sparring with a dumb thug masquerading as his chauffeur. Great encounter with Professor Dent, showing Bond to be more cold-hearted than the books would have him (controversial at the time - and maybe still now), a trait later inherited by Han Solo and Indiana Jones... sorta. Bond suffers a terrifying encounter with a tarantula spider (which isn't poisonous and wouldn't have harmed him anyway - Wikipedia says that ""though all tarantulas are venomous and some bites cause serious discomfort that might persist for several days, so far there is no record of a bite causing a human fatality; the bites of many species are known to be no worse than a wasp sting"" - but they sure look creepy!!), and has a lovely dalliance with the exotically Asian-looking Miss Taro, a secretary at Government House in Kingston who is a spy for Dr No, and was played by the very non-Asian Zena Marshall. The second half is filled with Honey Rider (known in the book as Honeychild Rider), bumblings in the Jamaican bush, a ridiculous mechanised swamp dragon and few grisly deaths, and an encounter with the stately Dr No that is both sublime and suffering succotash! Our Bond suffers beatings, burnings, and nearly as much physical hardship as Daniel Craig, making him a very heroic Bond indeed (if not a very smart one - he pretends to be clever with Dr No, then very clumsily admits to having never heard of SPECTRE). The battle with Dr No in a nuclear reactor is amazingly brainless, as is Bond's handy escape from a burning island in a speedboat while others are jumping into the water and trying to swim away.

Ironically, Dr No is followed by From Russia With Love, but in the film series it was the other way around - in fact, Fleming intended to kill Bond off at the end of From Russia With Love (the fifth book), but brought him back in Dr No (the sixth book), referencing his near-fatal battle with Rosa Kleb and his long recovery from the toxins she poisoned him with from her killer boots. Also, funny things happen between Quarrel and ""Quarrel Jr"" between the order of the books and the films.

While Dr No was NOT the first Bond book, it WAS the first Bond film, and established the Bond iconography, courtesy of director Terrence Young, a man so dashing that anyone involved in the film claimed that he could himself have played Bond had he wished. And the DVD comes with plenty of extras to mark the occasion. ""License to Restore"" (11:34) is a fascinating documentary about how the DVD producers set about restoring the original film, referring to a blooper in The Man With The Golden Gun that shows the cameras in mirror during a clumsy fight scene.

The Declassified MI6 Vault contains a bunch of other documentaries: ""The Guns of James Bond"" (5:00) shows the real Boothroyd offering interview comments about the inappropriateness of the Beretta as a weapon for a secret agent, thoughts about appropriate shoulder holsters, and the From Russia With Love rifle. ""Premiere Bond Opening Night"" (12:00) goes through the various Bond premieres, showing Ian Fleming and the stars, as well as unruly crowds when Goldfinger opened (one French fan even tried to climb into Connery's car in Paris!). Thunderball premiered in Tokyo, probably because the cast of the film were already in Japan filming You Only Live Twice; meanwhile, that film had its premiere with Queen Elizabeth II and Chitty Chittyy Bang Bang stars, Tony Bennett, Roald Dahl. Ivor Bryce, ""lifelong friend of Ian Fleming"" was there too. For the Diamonds Are Forever premiere, Roger Moore arrived together with Sean Connery, sparking reactions!! David Bowie and Paul McCartney were there for Live And Let Die. For Your Eyes Only with Prince Charles and his fiancee Lady Diana Spencer (and they attended next four together). Piers Brosnan had been at the For your Eyes Only premiere!!

007 Mission Control allows the replay of several character-driven or thematic scenes, but also allows you to watch the opening credits without the text! ""Exotic Locations"" with Maud Adams (2:30) a bit dull.

Mission Dossier includes more documentaries, such as ""Inside Dr No"" (42:00), going back to scenes of the original Casino Royale CBS TV version from 1954 that had been quickly forgotten, as well as comic strip versions. To cast Bond, director Terrence Young wanted Richard Johnson, and Cary Grant was considered, but the producers knew he would never make more than one bond film. Roger Moore was considered for Dr No, but was not available. Then Sean Connery, who was once introduced to Cubby Broccoli by Lana Turner, was considered. Terrence Young taught Connery style, as he was only a rough diamond. Noel Coward suggested for role of Dr No, his telegraph reply read ""No No No!!"" Zena made up as Asian Ms Taro. Ursula Andress cast without meeting producers. Strangways cast after chance encounter in Jamaica. Ian Fleming smitten by Ursula, wrote her into the book On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Great Bunny Yeager pics of Ursula. Recently-stolen Goya appears in film. Nuclear reactor control room was a $100,000 set. Ursula Andress was to be in a crab torture scene. Music composer remembered music he wrote for VS Naipal's ""A House For Mr Biswas,"" adapted it to be the classic Bond theme. This was the genesis of the Bond theme, and John Barry spiced it up with chords. Maurice Binder's opening is of the inside of a gun barrel, built classic Bond iconography. ""Terrence Young: Bond Vivant"" (17:50) describes Young's life, how he was born in Shanghai, made his second film Corridor Of Mirrors with Lois ""Miss Moneypenny"" Maxwell. ""Dr No 1963 Featurette"" (8:40) features a super ugly announcer running through it, droll and dry.

Ministry of Propaganda includes a theatrical archive: ""theatrical trailer"" (3:20) that focuses on the ladies, narration. Dr No is tall, but otherwise very much like Agent Smith, a total cold fish. ""Introducing James Bond"" (3:10) introduces the bond wardrobe and gun, very grainy. ""James Bond is back in Dr No and From Russia With Love"" (1:55), ""James Bond Face-to-face With Dr No and Goldfinger."" (2:15), both hammy ads for double features. ""Miss Honey and Miss Galore have James Bond back for more."" ""They try to bomb him, and charm him; mug him and drug him; they try to chop him, and drop him; belt him and melt him."" Also very grainy.

TV Broadcasts: ""Miss Honey and... (0:55), ""Miss Honey and Miss Galore (0:18). Culled from the longer ""Back-to-back"" item. Radio Communications: ""Beautiful Nature Girl"" (1:00), which introduces Honey Rider as Honeychilde Rider, as she's called in the book. ""Dr No, a madman with a fantastic secret."" (1:05), ""James Bond, the indestructible ace undercover agent (0:58), ""A female tarantula - the deadliest kind."" ""Meet James Bond, ace underground agent."" (0:48), ""On the edge of your seat"" (1:08), ""Come on out, we know you're there"" (1:00), ""From 'Eye-an' Fleming's novel"" they mispronounce the author's given name. ""Filmed in tropical Technicolor."" Oh, is that different from regular Technicolor?

Image database is full of amazing pictures of Ursula Andress, as well as uncharacteristic shots of Sean Connery goofing around with his Bond girls: ""The Filmmakers"" (8), ""Portraits"" (23), ""Jamaica"" (69), ""Pinewood"" (16), ""The Lost Scene"" (3), which shows a lame attempt to show Honey Rider being tortured by giant crabs, which moved too slowly to be scary, ""Ian Fleming - Jamaica"" (8), ""Ian Fleming - Pinewood"" (4), ""Around the world with 007"" (22 grainy shots of some classic film posters).",1428364800,,8908,4.894039735099338

701840,5,6303651453,"I always considered DR. NO to be one of the better Bond films and closer to the literary James Bond created by Ian Fleming. Sean Connery's performance is that of the no-nonsense dedicated civil servant. His screen presence alone conveys the physical, intellectual and moral conviction of the character. He is essentially a modern day version of the white knight slaying the dragon for Queen and country.

Joseph Wiseman as Dr. No is one of the best villains of the series. His steel mono-toned performance is eerily unsettling. He remains one of the most enigmatic villains in the series. He is a villain moved more by unfounded revenge than by greed or riches. You almost sympathize with him as he makes futile overtures to Bond imploring him to join his organization. It seems that Bond is the only man capable of appreciating his intellect. Not even Dr. No's backers, Blofeld and S.P.E.C.T.R.E. are worthy of his talents.

Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder leaves one of the most indelible images of the series as she emerges from the sea clad in her white bikini. She is characterized by the simplicity of her goodness and naivet' as she is drawn into a vortex of worldliness that Bond further engulfs her in. Rather than that of a supposed sex object, she exudes a raw femininity found only in nature. Bond can not help but feel that he has corrupted her both deliberately and inadvertently in his blind quest to revenge the deaths of fellow agents. This is the very strength of Richard Maibaum's script, here and on subsequent Bond films.

These films, the better ones, are about Bond, his adversaries, his loves and his friendships. Jack Lord was the first of many actors to play Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA friend. ""Friend"" in the world of James Bond is not a word used casually. Lord seemed the one actor to visually convey the camaraderie that existed between these two characters. John Kitzmiller gave a very good performance as the loyal Quarrel, one of the most important characters in he entire series. This character epitomized the dormant qualities found in the instincts of the common man. When called upon in the death struggle of good vs. evil he is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.

Anthony Dawson as Professor Dent seems perfect as a man who knew better than fall into an inescapable web of subterfuge that Dr. No has spread from his island to the mainland. Zena Marshall as Miss Taro is a more willing participant, as she appears eager to overtly display her sensuality and share her sexual appetites openly with Bond. She is supposed to lure Bond to his death. Finding this not the case she enthusiastically offers herself to Bond. It is in these scenes that Sean Connery displays a certain animal screen presence that no other actor has ever equaled in the role.

Many elements that distinguish a James Bond movie were introduced in this film. The opening gun barrel trademark, ""The James Bond Theme,"" Bernard Lee's portrayal of the inimitable M, Lois Maxwell's portrayal of the desirable Miss Moneypenny, Ken Adam's innovative and distinctive production designs, Maurice Binder's unique main titles, the ""Martinis shaken not stirred,"" just to name a few are all here.

Director, Terence Young, always boasted and took relish in how he supposedly shaped the look and feel of the James Bond series. This is quite possibly true when looking at DR. NO. It is a film visually rich with well-detailed and defined characters. It also has an uncanny feel for the settings inspired from the Ian Fleming novels whether it be Bond's intelligence headquarters in London, the exotic sights and sounds of Jamaica or the incongruity of Dr. No's plush lair hidden in the mosquito invested swamps of Crabe Key.

DR. NO is also characterized by quick paced editing by Peter Hunt. Hunt's innovative technique keeps the story moving visually and unobtrusively which also further defines the cinematic world of James Bond.

But coming full circle, it is Sean Connery's performance and screen presence that intrigues and captures the imagination of the viewer. Given the sets, the music, the script, the locations and all the other elements, it all comes down to how Sean Connery fits and moves through this cinematic world that has been created for James Bond. Sean Connery's performance is indeed that of Britain's dedicated civil servant. DR. NO is the benchmark.",1425772800,,4370,4.895945945945946

702028,3,6303651453,"I wanted to write this review, basically just to warn people about this particular DVD edition of the movie.  Plus, I have to say, even though I've seen the movie a couple of times, thought it has been many, many moons ago, I was very disappointed in the movie in general.  I mean, unless I fell asleep during the movie, the namesake of the  movie, Dr. No, couldn't have been in the movie more than 15 or 20 minutes....let's say 30 minutes tops.
And, I decided to buy this special edition, regular DVD of the movie, because 1) I was able to buy it brand new at a real good price from the market place sellers, and 2) I figured, being re-mastered for blu ray really wouldn't help a 50 year old movie that much.
Boy, was I wrong.  It didn't look like any re-mastering has been done on the film on this version of the DVD.  It still had glitches in the film, and just generally looked exactly like a 50 year old film would look.  I later read that the blu ray version looks great.  So, I just wanted to warn people that A) this movie doesn't really measure up to the later Bond films, IMO, though it is interesting to see how the Bond series gets its start and B) this is the last movie that I'm buying on regular DVD, if a Blu Ray is available!  I mean I was really disappointed in the quality of the film on this DVD.  It isn't terrible, but you'd just expect it to be better!
I'm not going to go into the plot or anything, we have enough reviews that do that.  I just wanted to give folks a note of caution to, IMO,  buy the blu ray vs the regular DVD.  I guess it is a no brainer.  But, I found out for sure, its a no brainer!  I hope you enjoy it, should you decide to get it, even though I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as later Bond films, no Bond collection is complete without the first film!  I give it about 3.5 stars for the quality of the movie, and 2.5 stars for the quality of the video on the DVD, thereby adding up to a 3 star movie, and what would probably be my lowest rated 007 movie.",1411344000,,2002,4.0329113924050635

This one actually makes the top of the list with some critics - and it's definitely appealing (although I wouldn't say #1).

702232,5,6303651453,"This is Connery's first foray into James Bond territory and it made him a star and Bond went on for another 50 years.

His style and good looks gave the world the impression that espionage was a gentlemen's game and spies lived an exciting life.  Assignations with beautiful women, gliding throughout the world in exotic cars and utilizing the latest in technical gadgets became synonymous with the world of intrigue.

Of course we all know this is not the way it is.  Never the less, it is an exciting escape for those enamored with the genre.

Bond is dispatched to Jamaica to locate a missing agent and his new secretary.  Along the way he meets the usual cast of characters with something to hide.  With Felix Lighter, aptly portrayed by the stoic Jack Lord and a local fisherman, Quarle they discover a bauxite mine run by the mysterious Chinese Dr. No.  After landing on Crab Key they along with the sensual beauty Ursula Andress are taken captive.  Beneath the mine is Dr. No's hideout complete with aquariums and a portrait of Napoleon giving Bond an idea of what kind of man No is.  The villain as usual wants to take over the world so Bond and Andress proceed to unravel Dr. No's diabolical plan.

The exotic Jamaica, fine acting and plot line are all excellent.  It is a time gone by and many aspects of the film are dated however, it is well worth the time.  As one who has seen all of the Bond flicks this one is similar to the first chapter of a rip roaring adventure that you cannot put down.

702236,5,6303651453,"TITLE: Dr. No was Release October 5, 1962 and the runtime on this movie was 109 minutes. Dr. No (1962), starring Sean Connery, is the first James Bond film. Based on the 1958 Ian Fleming novel of the same name, it was adapted by Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood, and Berkely Mather and was directed by Terence Young. The film was produced by Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, a partnership that would continue until 1975. In the film, James Bond is sent to Jamaica on an investigation into the death of a fellow British agent. The murder trail leads him to the underground base of Dr. Julius No, who is plotting to disrupt an early American manned space launch with a radio beam weapon. Although the first of the Bond books to be made into a film, Dr. No was not the first of Fleming's novels, Casino Royale being the debut for the character. However, the film makes a few references to threads from earlier books, such as M presenting him with his better-known Walther PPK. Dr. No was produced with a low budget, but was a financial success. While critical reaction at release was mixed, over time the film received a reputation as one of the franchise's best installments. The film was followed by a successful series with currently 22 films and a 23rd planned for release in 2012. Dr. No also launched a successful genre of ""secret agent"" films that flourished in the 1960s. Many of the iconic aspects of a typical James Bond film were established in Dr. No, beginning with what is known as the gun barrel sequence. The film begins with an introduction to the character through the view of a gun barrel, and a highly stylized main title sequence, both created by Maurice Binder. In his work on film, production designer Ken Adam established a unique and expansive visual style that is one of the hallmarks of the Bond film series.

SUMMARY: John Strangways, the British Intelligence (SIS) Station Chief in Jamaica, is ambushed, killed, and his body taken by three assassins known as the ""Three Blind Mice."" In response, MI6 agent James Bond (007) is summoned to the office of his superior, M. Bond is briefed to investigate Strangways' disappearance and to determine whether it is related to his cooperation with the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on a case involving the disruption of Cape Canaveral rocket launches by radio jamming. Upon his arrival at Kingston Airport, a female photographer tries to take Bond's picture and he is shadowed from the airport. A chauffeur, who Bond determines to be an enemy agent, picks him up. Bond instructs him to leave the main road and, after a brief fight, Bond starts to interrogate the driver, who then kills himself with a cyanide-embedded cigarette. During his investigation, Bond sees a picture of a boatman named Quarrel with Strangways. Bond locates Quarrel but finds him to be IN-cooperative when he interviews him. Bond also recognizes Quarrel to have been the driver of the car that chased him from the airport. Bond follows Quarrel and is about to be beaten by him and a friend when the fight is interrupted by the man from the airport who has been following Bond: he reveals himself to be CIA agent Felix Leiter and that not only are the two agents on the same mission, but also that Quarrel is helping Leiter. The CIA has traced the mysterious radio jamming of American rockets to the Jamaica vicinity, but aerial photography cannot see the exact location of its origin. Quarrel reveals to have been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. He also tells about the island of Crab Key, owned by the reclusive Dr. No, who operates a bauxite mine, which is rigorously protected against trespassers by armed security force and low-scan radar. After finding a receipt in Strangways' house about mysterious rocks naming, Professor R.J. Dent, Bond meets with Dent who says he had assayed the samples for Strangways and determined them to be ordinary rocks. This visit makes Dent wary and he takes a boat to Crab Key where Dr. No expresses displeasure at Dent's failure to kill Bond and orders him to try again, this time with a large venomous spider. Bond survives and after a final attempt on his life, sets a trap for Dent, who he captures, interrogates, and then kills.

QUESTIONS: What was detected in Quarrel's boat? Where does Quarrel take Bond? Why did he take Bond there for? What are they looking for? Where does Bond meet Honey Ryder? What was Honey Ryder looking for when Bond found her? Why was Honey afraid of Bond? Who was attacked after nightfall? Why were they attacked after nightfall instead of daylight? What happen to Honey and Bond were attacked? Why would Bond have dinner with Dr. No? Who planned a surprise at the launch? Why was Bond in prison and what happen to Honey?

MY THOUGHTS ON THIS PICTURE. This wasn't bad for the first James Bond movie. The Bond movies got better as the years went on. This Bond movie didn't have the toys that you would see in the later Bond films which took some of the action away. Sean Connery wasn't bad in this movie either. He wasn't the greatest James Bond actor either. I think Roger Moore and Pierce Bronson were a lot better. The best part of this movie is when Ursula Andress come walking on the beach in her swimsuit. That to me is when the movie got good. With Ursula as the leading lady in this movie I give this movie 5 weasel stars",1389571200,,5400,4.68809272918862

All the film clips are from the new HD source and also the photos that illustrate the piece were rescanned. Only the interviews that were shot in standard definition were upscaled. I have never heard of any company doing such an endeavor with a DVD extra before and I'd like to say kudos to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for this.

From the moment the camera focuses of Sean Connery as James Bond, the journey begins.  Connery seems so comfortable in the role that made him an international star.  Coming off his role in Darby O'Gill and the Little People, Connery created the film character of James Bond.  Terence Young, the film's director allowed Connery to craft many of his traits onto the character and Connery delivered.  The result is a classic spy action thriller without the glitz of later Bond films.  Remember, this film only had a $1M budget which it made back several times.  Of course, European actress, Ursula Andress is gorgeous as Honey Rider, Jamaica is beautiful, Joseph Wiseman is creepy as the villainous Dr. No (with his metal hands), the music is snappy, Maurice Binder's titles and opening sequence are artistic and engaging, and the plot is interesting.

702520,4,6303651453,"I recently re-watched this first James Bond adventure, and was reminded of how expertly the film makers set up what would become a great fictional character.  Even before we see him in action, we are shown the dangerous world he works in (the prelude to the main action is the murder of a British agent and his assistant in Jamaica) and shown some of the daily workings of the British Secret Service.  Bond is a kind of international policeman sent to investigate the murder, and soon falls into a larger plot featuring the mysterious Doctor No.

Sean Connery is clearly figuring out who Bond is in this first outing.  In a couple of scenes he seems too excitable, almost shouting his dialog.  But his charisma is unmistakable and he handles the physical action with surprising grace.  He also nails a Bond's professional coldness and streak of cruelty, something we take for granted in super spies, but very new and mysterious in the early 60s.  I think that Connery and Daniel Craig are the best of the Bonds, and it was fun to see first Bond adventure again.  Highly recommended.",1367280000,,1082,4.6878306878306875

Without the kind of galactic-sized budget or recklessly eccentric touches that would come to define the series in later installments, I was impressed with the film's ingenuity in filling those holes. Though Bond lacks his usual cache of gimmicks and gadgets, that time is instead spent inspecting the finer points of his espionage work, which I appreciated. There's something to be said for firing lasers from a pocket watch, but I was just as captivated watching Sean Connery booby trap his closet with a single strand of hair or set up a would-be assassin by rolling his bedsheets into a bundle and laying in wait. It loses touch with that grounded sensibility in the third act, though, which is much more in-line with what one would expect from the series. Bond's dastardly eponymous foil is comically run-of-the-mill, although he doesn't truly get enough screen time to explain himself and seems far too easily defeated.

702684,5,6303651453,"Having never seen any Bond films outside of the newer releases starring Daniel Craig, I figured I should start off my introduction into classic Bond the right way. The film proved to be immensely entertaining. While this was Connery's first time as Bond, he plays the role so well that you would never know it otherwise. He captures Bond's personality perfectly. Craig plays the character in a more aggressive way, but both he and Connery play up the suave, gentler (and much more humorous) side of Bond to a great extent as well. The action, production design, costumes, and props are all excellent. Connery was cracking me up the entire movie with his one-liners and his cockiness. Just like Craig does in the role, he may act like he truly cares, but he's usually stringing whoever it is along as a means to an end. And that's what is so great about the character - you truly do not know what he is going to do next. I would have preferred it if the villainous Dr. No would have appeared earlier in the movie so he could establish more of a presence, but that really was the only drawback for me. Everything else considering, it was an absolutely stellar film, and a great Bond film (especially since it was the first). I may be rather late to the game of seeing the Bond films with Connery, but I'm definitely down with watching the other films in the future.",1362787200,,1363,4.5

702686,4,6303651453,"When appreciating art, there is a lot of ""for its time"" to take into consideration. Dr. No doesn't really hold up very well in a number of departments. The acting is kind of silly and exaggerated. Many scenes linger too long. There are some really ridiculous moments, like the time that a guy gets killed by a flame-spewing tank that he sees literally a mile away and yet doesn't get out of the way of. The filmmaking in this film isn't meant so much for artistry than it is simply hewing to the John Wayne movie conventions of the time. It doesn't push the envelope, but instead is meant to bring to life the novels. It's competent, but not inspiring.

Still, for what it is, it is enjoyable. There's something about the slight amateurish quality of the film which makes bond girl Ursula Andress shine even sexier, because her bathing suit isn't sleek and symmetrical and she isn't airbrushed into barbie doll perfection. It's real, and so that much better. Also, the slower pace, without the intricate SFX being thrown at the viewer, makes for a more meditative viewing experience that is calming compared to the contemporary Bond's.

It also seems to me that the much slower pace forced more of the burden onto the actors. Nowadays, the cuts are so quick that a skilled director could make any amateur look good on film. Here, the cuts are so long that the lead man is oddly more vulnerable and has to fill the space in a more assured manner; it's like you're watching a jazz performance from the actors.

So, for it's time, and for what it is, it's enjoyable. However, it isn't striking in the way that movies like 2001 a Space Odyssey remain to this day.",1362182400,,1659,4.560402684563758

Wile it may not have had the budget of later films, there is a lot of style in this first feature and Connery is already a natural in the role.  Joseph Wiseman's Dr. No is a bit too much as an oriental villain with metal hands.  As a matter of fact, the film tried to cast a few roles that were Chinese in nature but played by actors who were not convincing as Asians.  But that still can't take away from the fun here.

The picture quality is astounding, a great restoration.

Sound is excellent, too.

There are plenty of extras carried over from the DVD Ultimate Edition.  Regretably, they are in standard definition, and one can certainly how much superior HD is to SD while watching these.

Among the extras are:

007: License To Restore - a brief look at the restoration, but because it is in SD you really don't see much except in cases where there are hairs or the like on the original.

The Guns of James Bond - a grainy b&w featurette from the 1960s from the real Boothroyd that Ian Fleming based the character in Dr. No on.  Not exactly a thrilling piece but it does have a nice Connery introduction.

Premiere Bond: Opening Nights - this is an interesting look at many of the Bond films opening nights.  Some good stars turned out and real-life celebrities like Pricess Diana are included.  Future Bond Pierce Brosnan is spotted in the background of a photo at the premiere of For Your Eyes Only.

Inside Dr. No - an excellent documentary about the making of the film, running about 42 minutes.  Includes interviews with Ursula Andress, director Terence Young, designed Ken Adams and many more.

Terence Young: Bond Vivant - a featurette about the director and his film history.

Dr. No 1963 Featurette - a b&w TV short, very rough shape and generally uninteresting.

A selection of trailers and TV & radio commercials.

There is a commentary that features voices of people involved in the making of the film.  These come from a lot of sources, but the narrator, who works at the Ian Fleming Foundation, gives a brief intro to each before playing the audio clip to let us know who is talking.  However, this is still rather awkward, because you really do lose track and it feels very jumbled, though he does try to keep each clip scene-specific.

Plus,an ""image database"" has a collection of about 100 photos (70 of them were taken on location in Jamaica).

This is my favourite Bond movie which I fond kind of ironic consider4ng it's the first one. But this first outing offers a good balance between the charmer, the killer, the tough guy. And like already mentioned the gadgets are few and far between which, in retrospect, makes the later films somewhat cartoonish and over-the-top. This movie offers the best Felix Leiter in Jack Lord. It's a shame he didn't continue in the role. It also offers the best sexy-woman-coming-out-of-the-water scene I can remember thanks to the gorgeous Ursula Andress. The story is played low-key which makes it one of the least cheesy Bond films. Oh and call me old fashioned but although I love many of the cars he drove, that Sunbeam Alpine was really cool. In my opinion the Bond franchise has endured because it was built on this great foundation. BTW' I don't understand why Bond never got it on with Moneypenny.

And then Bond getting called into M's office to start his mission against Dr. No, And to be honest, this movie drags and drags, we get car chases against green screen that are obviously against green screen.

702940,5,6303651453,"I always considered DR. NO to be one of the better Bond films and closer to the literary James Bond created by Ian Fleming. Sean Connery's performance is that of the no-nonsense dedicated civil servant. His screen presence alone conveys the physical, intellectual and moral conviction of the character. He is essentially a modern day version of the white knight slaying the dragon for Queen and country.

Joseph Wiseman as Dr. No is one of the best villains of the series. His steel mono-toned performance is eerily unsettling. He remains one of the most enigmatic villains in the series. He is a villain moved more by unfounded revenge than by greed or riches. You almost sympathize with him as he makes futile overtures to Bond imploring him to join his organization. It seems that Bond is the only man capable of appreciating his intellect. Not even Dr. No's backers, Blofeld and S.P.E.C.T.R.E. are worthy of his talents.

Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder leaves one of the most indelible images of the series as she emerges from the sea clad in her white bikini. She is characterized by the simplicity of her goodness and naivet as she is drawn into a vortex of worldliness that Bond further engulfs her in. Rather than that of a supposed sex object, she exudes a raw femininity found only in nature. Bond can not help but feel that he has corrupted her both deliberately and inadvertently in his blind quest to revenge the deaths of fellow agents. This is the very strength of Richard Maibaum's script, here and on subsequent Bond films.

These films, the better ones, are about Bond, his adversaries, his loves and his friendships. Jack Lord was the first of many actors to play Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA friend. ""Friend"" in the world of James Bond is not a word used casually. Lord seemed the one actor to visually convey the camaraderie that existed between these two characters. John Kitzmiller gave a very good performance as the loyal Quarrel, one of the most important characters in he entire series. This character epitomized the dormant qualities found in the instincts of the common man. When called upon in the death struggle of good vs. evil he is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.

Anthony Dawson as Professor Dent seems perfect as a man who knew better than fall into an inescapable web of subterfuge that Dr. No has spread from his island to the mainland. Zena Marshall as Miss Taro is a more willing participant, as she appears eager to overtly display her sensuality and share her sexual appetites openly with Bond. She is supposed to lure Bond to his death. Finding this not the case she enthusiastically offers herself to Bond. It is in these scenes that Sean Connery displays a certain animal screen presence that no other actor has ever equaled in the role.

Many elements that distinguish a James Bond movie were introduced in this film. The opening gun barrel trademark, ""The James Bond Theme,"" Bernard Lee's portrayal of the inimitable M, Lois Maxwell's portrayal of the desirable Miss Moneypenny, Ken Adam's innovative and distinctive production designs, Maurice Binder's unique main titles, the ""Martinis shaken not stirred,"" just to name a few are all here.

Director, Terence Young, always boasted and took relish in how he supposedly shaped the look and feel of the James Bond series. This is quite possibly true when looking at DR. NO. It is a film visually rich with well-detailed and defined characters. It also has an uncanny feel for the settings inspired from the Ian Fleming novels whether it be Bond's intelligence headquarters in London, the exotic sights and sounds of Jamaica or the incongruity of Dr. No's plush lair hidden in the mosquito invested swamps of Crabe Key.

DR. NO is also characterized by quick paced editing by Peter Hunt. Hunt's innovative technique keeps the story moving visually and unobtrusively which also further defines the cinematic world of James Bond.

But coming full circle, it is Sean Connery's performance and screen presence that intrigues and captures the imagination of the viewer. Given the sets, the music, the script, the locations and all the other elements, it all comes down to how Sean Connery fits and moves through this cinematic world that has been created for James Bond. Sean Connery's performance is indeed that of Britain's dedicated civil servant. DR. NO is the benchmark.

Dick. A whale of a tale that has gone on for 40 years. Bond

guy and then put an extra bullet into his back for good

at that. Not a real threat. And Bond goes and kills him?
This was the scene that made all the difference, and made
Bond the icon that he is today.
The film is nicely devided with Bond in London, than in
Jamaica, and finally on Dr. No's island which introduces us
to Usula Andress'$50,000 bikini, a fire breathing dragon,
and Dr. No and his uniquely designed hidout. These seperate
locations refresh the movie at two points giving renewed
interest to the story.

And in all of this is young Sean Connery playing it straight
and at times sadistic. Yet, he has his fears. Namely a
tarantula in bed with him instead of his usual guest. And sadness, when his aid is burned alive. Throw in a fem fatal in a seductive mountain home luring Bond to his death and ""the three blind mice"", and you've got the movie that started it
all, though it wasn't until ""Goldfinger"" that the whole

The result is an adventure that is a bit more grounded in reality than many of the later films would be.  Ursula Andress remains one of the most impressive Bond girls.",1303257600,,647,4.962962962962963
703029,5,6303651453,"As a James Bond fan, I have often debated which is the epitome of Bond films. From Russia With Love had the best plot and Goldfinger had the best villian. However, which is the ideal film that best features James Bond as a character ? I can't help but turn to no other film than Dr. No. Everything Bond does in this film is what makes him so memorable, so classy, and so dangerous.

The introduction of Bond is one of the memorable sequences in film history. We see a man playing Baccarat in a smoke filled Casino and his opponent is a woman as equally as charismatic. What made that first ""Bond, James Bond"" so great was Connery's delivery; It oozed an innate, swarthy, sexual charisma. Also the line compliments the ""Trench, Sylvia Trench"". Later when Bond is called into M's office while he was at the Casino we learn it's 3am. This further pays homage to the opening atmosphere in Ian Fleming's Casino Royale and the neausiating ectasy of the casino. Here the character's nature is soldified and it's enternally enjoyable.

Now just to digress a little, I must say I loved the way how the British secret service was depicted in this film as opposed to future Bond films. When the line fell dead on Jamica, we see the machine of MI6 at work. Members of the secret service trying determine what happened before they take their course of action. Also I loved the fact that the orginization was in the guise of ""Universal Exports"" as seen on the door to Moneypenny's office. You feel things are operating even without Bond and Bond himself is dictated by this entity. Too often in the later films MI6 just seemed to be a building of extras waiting for Bond to come to the rescue.

I think Bond never felt this smart or dangerous and sometimes cruel as opposed to other films. It's the little things that all add up. Take for example when Bond thought there was a home invader in his apartment. He moved quitely to the opposite end of the living room, removed his shoes, moved towards the bedroom where he heard noises and with his Walther PPK in hand. This moment displays what keeps Bond alive. Bond is no smarter, stronger, and possibly even tougher than many of his opponents. What makes Bond to ideal hero is that he has that ""sixth sense"" for danger. He's two steps ahead because he knows something isn't right in the atmosphere and any other man would have ignored some incongruity at that moment in time.

This reliance on instincts rarely lets up in the film. Bond quickly sniffs out a false laison to the Jamiacian Government House waiting at the airport and quickly prvents his picture being taken by a mysterious young woman. At his hotel room. Bond uses primative but efficient burgular dectors; Bond leaves powder on his brief case to see if any finger prints get on them and he takes a hair which he applies saliva on to keep pinned to the double doors of his closet. When Bond returns he finds these places violated and also he smells that something isn't right with the vodka he left on his desk and takes out another from the drawer.

Bond also is prone to cruelty in this adventure. I think the notable moment was when he had Cayman Islander Quarrel retrieve that mysterious photographer girl in Pus Feller's club. Bond interrogates her by letting Quarrel bend her arm and he dosen't give a secound thought to Quarrel being injured by her using a broken lightbulb. This a rather harsh course of actions because as far as Bond knows, and the viewer, Quarrel seems like a thug who would willing maime or possibly kill. Probably one other minor thing was when he took Honey Rider by the arm to establish his dominance when she refused to leave the dangerous Crab Key Island.

Now I have been going on about Bond all this time but what about the film ? I think this probably the most versatile Bond in the franchises history because it operates in different genres. In the beginning it seems like a detective thriller and bit of a Charlie Chan film with the un-usual death of Commander Strangways and his assistant in Jamica and Bond is sent down there persuing suspects. Later when we arrive at Crab Key, it goes into the adventure genre with this primative nature woman called Honey Rider. Lastly this film turns into a Sci-Fi B Movie. The settings become far more post modern and the finale takes place in a gigantic laboratory. I think this combination meant alot to the film because it seems like such a long journey from plausiability and it escolated into fantasy. The key word there is escolation. The threat was somewhat established but we couldn't really brace ourselves into for what was to come.

The most important co-stars of the film don't dissappoint. Future star of Hawaii-Five-O Jack Lord appears as CIA operative Felix Leiter. It's not much of a part but Lord makes a great impact on the film because of Lord's presence. He's just as cool as Bond but in an American way. John Kitzmiller plays the faithful and resourceful Quarrel and his death is one of the more tragic in the series. The beautiful Ursula Andress plays Honey Rider and we know that wonderful introduction. Honey's personality was just as memorable. She is this hard-as-nails ""jungle woman"" of sorts but she ultimately needs Bond's help in this world of men with dangerous ambitions. They struck the balance here perfectly, not a bumbling bimbo and not too tough. Of course we get to Doctor Julius No played by Joseph Wiseman. Wiseman brings the character of No to life in a cold, monotone, voice. Though No seems inhuman he does pause when Bond insults him and clearly has a god complex with a desire for power and eagerness to tell his life story to Bond. He also gets a bonus for noticing how Bond casually slipped a knife under his sleeve; That kills me everytime.

I think the only nitpicks I have is the music and the writing for Julius No. Monty Norman conducted the music for this film. and it had dated rather badly; An unintentionally hilarous moment in the film was when you hear an instrument blare everytime Bond slammed his shoe to kill a lethal spider. Also as much as I loved Doctor No himself he's lacking just a bit. This adaptation removed the sadism from the character almost entirely. In the novel, No fed and clothed Bond and Honey so he could conduct an experiment trying their physical stamina. Also it seems sort of dissappointing that No is essentially working under a greater power as opposed to the book which employed his services. His God complex seemed a little less stronger. Still Wiseman did a great job with what he was given. Simply put this is the Bond to watch if you love the character and you want the best in your thrills.",1288656000,3,6662,4.583053691275167
703030,5,6303651453,"""Dr. No"" was the first James Bond film released to theaters in 1962, and it is heavily regarded by both fans and critics alike as being one of the best in the Bond franchise. In the story Bond travels to Jamaica to investigate the death of a fellow British Secret Service agent. While there he encounters the dangerous Dr. No, a madman attempting to distrupt an American space launch.

 The film has all the ingredients that would become famous with other Bond films; a sexy leading man, played superbly by Sean Connery (in my estimation the best James Bond period), a great theme song, outstanding visual photography at various locations around the world, a neat opening, wonderful villins, and a beautiful Bond girl, this time played wonderfully by Ursulla Andress. ""Hawaii Five-O"" star Jack Lord has a supporting role in ""Dr. No"" as a CIA agent.

 The film print is outstanding, probably one of the best jobs a studio has done in restoring old movies to DVD and Blue ray. The colors are strong and vibrant, and it looks like the movie was shot yesterday.

I cannot find any online references to this article, but it must have been done by Ian Fleming as an excerpt from his novel. It would be fun to chase this lead down.",1277942400,2,627,4.405172413793103

Bond is cool, sexy, and somewhat cold, as when he goes to bed with a female foil and then amusedly hands her over to the local cops.

Somehow, Bond is mis-identified as a 'secret' agent, because I can't recall too many situations where his status as an agent remained unidentified for long. Dr. No is no exception. The bad guys have a line on him as soon as he arrives on the island, literally, and it never stops from there.

Anwyay, I would learn that this was the movie--in the very successful ""James Bond"" franchise--that got the ball rolling.

I never read the Ian Fleming books so I don't know how they measure up but this is the first classic 007 that I've seen, all the way through, with Sean Connery.

And Connery does not disappoint! He's classy, handsome, rugged, and a total player with impeccable style so you have no problem believing that he can get the bad guys and the women to boot. Andress is divine as a pseudo side-kick/love interest, but I don't know why they dubbed her voice(at least that's what is explained on the special features)? Her own voice with that exotic accent seemed fine to me.

The action is pretty good and you get to see those exotic locales that the ""Bond"" movies are famous for, in this case Jamaica.

Picture clarity and color are fantastic so this transfer to blu-ray is worth it and there's lots of specials!

703155,4,6303651453,"Alright, I'm gonna attempt to do a review on the James Bond 007 movies, all 23 of them.  Right off the bat, I think ""Never Say Never Again"" is good enough to be reviewed, even though it's considered an unofficial entry (gotta wait for Review #14 for that one).

Hopefully, I can keep these brief but interesting.  I love this series, even when it missteps.

Forgive me if I gloss over the history of how the 007 stories were acquired and produced by United Artists' Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman.  That's why DVD special features were invented, and any of the 2-disc or Special Edition DVDs will give you a lot of insight into the making of.

But enough about the DVD product; it's time to delve into the 1962 premeire outing of ""Dr. No.""  And I'll tell you right off the bat that it's one of the most unique entries compared to the rest of the Bond franchise.

""Dr. No"" begins with a couple assassinations of British spies in Jamaica, prompting the British government to select one of their secret agents to investigate.  'Investigation' is the key word, because unlike most Bond movies, this 1st movie feels like a detective story with some pulp noir thrown in.  There's a dose of exotic locales, suspicious women, and a fairly believable story until the last act when James Bond and the gorgeous Honey Ryder are held captive in the villain's evil lair.  There's more suspense in the story, rather than a dose of fistfights and chases (although there's a little bit of that, as well).

""Dr. No"" is very patient in introducing us to James Bond, Agent 007.  We don't even see the man for about 15 minutes, and even then, his face is obscured until he delivers that immortal line, ""Bond...James Bond.""  It's an introduction that no moviegoer will ever forget.  Keeping with the mystery noir, a couple of Bond's allies in Jamaica appear to be shady stalkers, until a brief scuffle sorts everything out.  It's a neat way to introduce Felix Leiter and Quarrel, the CIA agent and local fisherman helping James Bond get familiar with the area.

I suppose there's little point in telling you how good Sean Connery is in the role.  While I don't want to open the can of worms of debating which actor is best, here's my short answer: Connery is my favorite interpretation of the character, but I love the other portrayals from Lazenby, Moore, Dalton, Brosnan, and Craig.  None of these actors could've done each other's stories, end of discussion.

Anyway, back to Sir Sean Connery --- he's excellent.  He's charming and  sophisticated under the most dire circumstances, sly with the ladies, and pretty good with his fists and Walther PPK pistol.  What makes ""Dr. No"" unique to me is how we actually believe that we are learning 'with' James Bond.  In most of the other movies, 007 figures things out so quickly, that we just shrug and go along for the ride.  This time, there is real mystery.  Who ordered the assassinations?  Who is tampering with the Cape Canaveral rockets?  Who is this mysterious Dr. No from Crab Key that nobody has seen?  How did the beautiful Honey Ryder end up on Crab Key, an island that nobody has been reported to come back from?

I will admit that ""Dr. No"" is a very slow-paced movie, but if you go in with the right frame of mind, perhaps you can see how exciting this movie was back in 1962.  Of course, the upcoming sequels kicked up the excitement a few notches, and are considered some of the best of the series.  But for a 1st outing, ""Dr. No"" is a promising start.  On second thought, if this were the only movie in the James Bond 007 series, I'd still say it's a pleasant piece of entertainment.

703157,4,6303651453,"Dr. No has elements none of the other Bonds have.  Aside from being the first 007 adventure, it is more like a old fashioned spy story than a ""Bond film"", and it shares being one of the best along side From Russia With Love. The film stays the course it sets out to do in that Bond is really a detective in this one, sluething and walking around as if no one can come close to him.  The scenes in the hotel quite clearly are the establishing scenes that this is a man to be reckoned with, a spy who does his duty, a man with licence to kill.  It has the look and feel of a Bond novel and this makes the action intense.  Sean Connery makes the film, and, of course the rest of the series, in that he prowels around every scene like a tiger.  When he finally meets Dr. No, the chemistry between them is on fire and we see the true acting talents of this new, young actor.  Dr. No is a menace and Connery's Bond shows pain and suffering at his Dr. No's hands, making both characters quite real and believable, something missing from later Bond films.  Of course one cannot go on without mentioning the incredible ""coming from the sea"" scene of Ursula Andrews.  This scene is a classic and she too shows her talents as she suffers at the steel hands of Dr. No.  All in all, Dr. No, like Sean Connery, is a force to be reckoned with.",1256428800,,1328,4.136186770428016
703158,5,6303651453,"I won't bother with the details of this movie. It is an all time 007 classic to say the least. The Blu Ray version of this film is absolutely stunning and spectacular. Viewing it on your HDTV will make you feel like you are on actually on the set while the filming is taking place. The scenes filmed outside are gorgeous and filled with deep, rich natural colors...unbelievable....and what can I say about the infamous Honey Ryder beach scene? My jaw was on the floor and I felt as if I was on the beach with the characters. Top to bottom, you won't be disappointed at all. The extras on the Blu Ray are great too. Highlights from the extras are: (1) Behind the scenes at Lowry Digital Films which talked about the process for restoring the original film with before and after scenes from the restoration; how they did some of their ""magic"" was beyond me but I'm so thankful for it. Geeks will appreciate the views of Lowry's operation center with 500+/- G5s, 300+ G4s, and 1GB ethernet network connecting it all. (2) Backstory of how Dr. No came to be on the big screen which included in-depth interviews with several of the actual producers, writers, actors, and players involved. How impressed was I overall with the Blu Ray version of Dr. No? I haven't written a review on amazon.com since March 2006 and was compelled to do so for this version of the film. I will definitely be buying the Blu Ray version of ""Goldfinger"" (which Lowry Digital re-did as well).",1254873600,9,1463,4.545454545454546
703159,4,6303651453,"Here is the beginning of what would become the worlds most megalithic and longest running film series in terms of both entries and longevity. It starts out as an unassuming British spy thriller, whose main character just happens to be called Bond...James Bond. The words are drawled out by an unknown Scottish actor making his big mark on the film world, the one and only Sean Connery who many decree to be the best James Bond.

From his first tuxedo-ed scene, lazily lighting a cigarette he seems to own the part. All the base elements for the Bond films are there from the beginning. Bond the charming, no-nonsense agent, all about ladies and martini's, his gruff boss M, brilliantly played by Bernard Lee, his flirting secretary Moneypenny played by the come hither Lois Maxwell and the far reaching locales, in this case Jamaica. This first Bond outing sticks close to the novel source material of the 1958 Ian Fleming novel - an unusual choice for the first outing of the super spy but there was huge legal trouble trying to adapt Thunderball as the first film.

The pace is slower and more downbeat than later entries. Its style and essence scream ""product of the times."" from the sixties hairdo's and cars to the fashions, check out Jack Lord's funky sunglasses. Even smoking is far from being poo-pooed as it is today. But what do you expect from a story shot in 1962? Still it's the solid story buoyed by solid acting that make it a cut above other action films of its time.

Bond investigates the assassination of an agent in Jamaica who has stumbled across too much information about the mysterious Dr. No. Making the good doctor the prime suspect in a locale where radio beams have been detected diverting and destroying American Space launches. Connery shows Bond at his most ferocious and raw. He appears a charming gentleman but shows no mercy to his enemies. An example being the most ruthless Bond moment in the whole 50 year history in his casual gunning down of an unarmed Professor Dent played by Anthony Dawson, when he's outed as one of Dr. No's stooges. A moment shocking for it's time and Connery's ice-cold delivery gives it an edge.

Mention must go to Ursula Andress without whom the phrase `Bond Girl' would never have made it into the modern day lexicon. She only appears well over an hour in and yet there's quite a bit of character background for her and she doesn't just throw herself into Bond's arms as so many do in future films. The emergence of her tall blonde and bronze physique from the sea wearing only a white bikini and knife belt would make anyone sit upright at the cinema...well there's a possible double entendre`.

Now to the first ever Bond villain and we have the dangerously silky smooth Joseph Wiseman as metal handed Dr. No. He's the first ever agent seen from SPECTRE and one who begins the tradition of Bond villains with a notable physical deformity. Dr. No seems so unshaken from his icy menace by Bond you can really believe the hero isn't a match for him. In fact Bond gets irradiated, electrocuted, drugged and beaten up by Dr. No's foot soldiers before getting the better of the baddie.

Hawaii Five-O's Jack Lord plays the first and best of the many screen incarnations of Bond's CIA counterpart Felix Leiter and Jack Kitzmiller plays Quarrel the local islander who eventually becomes a loyal ally of both. Much is made of Bond's womanizing and here he only uses it to route out (oh-er) the spy in the British embassy. The whole ensemble is brilliantly brought together with the flourish of original Bond director Terence Young, who made James Bond a hit with the `looking down a gun barrel' opening to the soundtrack to the flashy opening titles by Maurice Bender that are accompanied by the original and best James Bond theme for the first and only time in the series history.

Producers Broccoli and Saltzman and a major hit on their hands roll on the 60's! Though with the meticulous re-mastering of picture quality and 5.1 surround sound on this edition, much better than the first releases mono sound track - it feels like you could walk right into the clear scenes and dive into the Jamaican sea. The Special features as always for the Bond releases are forever special from all the promotional materials and especially the making of documentary on how the whole phenomenon started over 50 years ago with so little ambition and so much to gain.",1254787200,,4413,4.6937984496124034

703162,5,6303651453,"If you don't know where that line comes from, you've either been in a coma for several decades and just woke up, or you are the World's Greatest Hermit. To say that Ian Fleming's fictional creation is a pop culture icon doesn't do it justice; James Bond is more than that. There are arguably only two fictional creations better known worldwide than James Bond (and no I'm not going to try to troll religious people by including religious icons in that list).

It's with that legacy that MGM finally decided to begin releasing the Bond collection on Blu-Ray in the form of six randomly selected Bond adventures. While it wasn't the first of the set I watched (hey, I've seen them all before) I found it fitting to kick off my two days of Bond Blu-Ray reviews with the movie that spawned a franchise: Dr. No.

Anyone who has seen James Bond can testify that it isn't the plot which makes the movie-it's the actor, and the action on screen. No Bond better personified that than Mr. Connery. For those who have only seen the Brosnan and new Craig Bond takes, do yourself a favor and stop reading this right now, and go buy Dr. No on Blu-Ray (or DVD if you have no BRD player). Sean Connery took a character and turned him into a legend, and this film is a large part of that legacy.

Taking place amidst car chases, explosions, and wet bikini clad women, Connery's first foray into Bond brought the world a new kind of movie, and a new kind of world. With the Cold War fresh in the minds of many, the idea of villains able to hold the world hostage was a very real fictional threat, but hadn't truly been portrayed in Bondian fashion until Dr. No.

Of course, these days the movie itself might seem dated. White actors don makeup to play minorities, women have wonderfully suggestive names (and scant clothing for the period), and the writers and director (Terrence Young) hold no punches when it comes to offending groups of people. Viewed as a modern film, Dr. No slumps along struggling to find an identity; viewed as a piece of art from when it was originally made, Dr. No is a fun, action-filled espionage thriller which would forever change the history of cinema, and defined careers for numerous people involved (and women for the next several decades).

Movie aside (which is as fantastic as always) I'm sure what people want to know most about is the quality of the video and audio. First off, remember the age of this movie and the small budget it was working with at the time of release. Even with those obstacles, the video transfer here is by far the best Dr. No yet. You can make out details on paper, see all the lines on Connery's face during his trademark grin, and (for the guys out there) see partly through certain wet white bikinis at times.

Compared to modern releases the crispness of color and the black levels are nowhere near as strong, but in terms of taking an aging film and cleaning it up for modern audiences, Dr. No doesn't pull any punches. It's not fantastic looking, but compared to the source (and past DVD releases) the quality is miraculous.

The same can be said of the audio. On my original Dr. No DVD there are plenty of times when I can't quite make out what someone is saying over background noise, but in this release that's all gone. It's the first time audio of this quality has been put together with an older Bond movie, and the result is nothing short of awesome.

If there's one true downside with this release, it's that the extras are severely lacking. I know that it's impossible for MGM to find further scenes after all the re-releases we've already had of Dr. No over the years, but I would have loved some newer updated commentary from people, and maybe better retrospective looks at the film itself compared to the new Casino Royale film. (You know, compare the two Bond ""starts"" against one another and juxtapose them with the original Fleming character.)

Lack of Blu-Ray extras aside, Dr. No is a fantastic release and a great starting point for the BRD era of Bond. The video is the best Dr. No has ever seen, the audio blows previous releases out of the water, and combined they bring new life to an aging classic. If you're a Bond or action fan, you owe it to yourself to pick up Dr. No and re-live a legend.",1249689600,,4268,4.489690721649485
703163,5,6303651453,"DR. NO

The first movie featuring James Bond, Agent 007 of her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service revolutionized our world. James Bond is a fictional character created by writer Ian Fleming in 1953 while he vacationed in his Jamaican property by the name of Golden-eye.

The James Bond movies capture the action and romance found in the books by the author and surfaced a world of espionage, gadgets, secret weapons, beautiful women and amazing cars. Needless to say, James Bond movies are famous the world over.

Sean Connery, selected for the first movie: Dr. No, created an image so powerful that still to today, it is thought as that of the best Bond character. DR. NO dazzled audiences with an action packed film where a British Intelligence Station chief is killed while in Jamaica. 007, sent to investigate the disappearance sets out to resolve the situation with the help of the CIA.

As James Bond arrives at Kingston airport, he is followed. The chauffeur that picked him up at the airport claimed to be sent by the Government House but soon Bond suspects that he is not. When Bond tries to interrogate him, he kills himself by taking cyanide.

Enter Felix Leiter, a CIA agent that helps Bond and while the character is never played by the same actor, it is a role we often see throughout the Bond movies. We learn that the CIA has discovered radio jamming of American rockets and has traced the source to Jamaica. Crab Key Island, owned by Dr. No and secured by armed forces becomes the center of action and when Bond tries to further investigate, the Crab Key file is stolen and Bond suspects foul play.

With the help of Quarrel, a fisherman and in the company of Honey Rider, played by Ursula Anders, Bond gets into Crab Key only to be taken captive by the crew. James Bond and Honey Rider are invited to dine with Dr. No and during dinner, Dr. No explains that he is a member of SPECTRE [Special Executive for Counter Intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion], a criminal organization that plans to tamper with Project Mercury, a space launch about to take off from Cape Canaveral. Dr. No tries to enlist Bond but Bond refuses.

Bond manages to escape and spoils the criminal plot releases Honey and they escape, leaving us in great expectation for the next Bond film.",1249257600,,2292,4.7007481296758105

This film also introduces audiences to the smooth talking charm of Sean Connery who is able to turn the character into icon in his first quote: ""Bond, James Bond.""  Who could have guessed back in the day that this character would become the star of the longest running film series of all time?

Now, Dr. No is a good Bond film, but it isn't the best, as it is soon surpassed by films such as From Russia with Love and Goldfinger, but Dr. No does remain a great film as Sean Connery is a demanding screen presence through and through.  He hasn't gotten the character to its full-potential just yet, but he certainly is close to that point (he'd perfect it in Goldfinger).

In the film we are introduced to the Bond charm and the essentials such as pretty girls, exotic locations, eccentric villains, and elaborate traps.  So Bond enters in a grand fashion bringing in action that is well-ahead of its time which.  Some of the action and ideas presented in this movie are things you wouldn't see much of until later in the 60s.

The final verdict is that while Dr. No is the BEST Bond film it is the first in the series and as such deserves great respect for all the things it introduces.  It introduces Sean Connery and all the elements of a GOOD Bond film.  This is why Dr. No is certainly the Bond film for beginner fans to the series.  It is probably the BEST way to introduce someone to the Sean Connery Bond because...It's how the entire world was introduced to him in 1963!

Also, the new DVDs have great picture quality and are well worth buying if you do not own the previous Special Edition of Dr. No.  The picture is crisp and the sound is good and it comes highly recommended.",1238544000,,1778,4.41717791411043

703218,5,6303651453,"In 1962, movie audiences were first introduced to the suave, cool secret agent James Bond played by Sean Connery. It goes down in history as a true landmark performance.

After a British agent named Commander John Strangways (Robert Rietty) is mysteriously killed while stationed in Jamaica, James Bond is sent to investigate his murder and radio jamming interference that has recently disrupted the launches of rockets from Cape Canaveral. Bond investigates the strange events with the help of CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jack Lord) and Strangways' fishing guide, Quarrel (John Kitzmiller). They discover that these events connect with the reclusive SPECTRE agent Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman), the resident of the nearby island of Crab Key, which locals are forbidden to visit. When Bond and Quarrel go to Crab Key, they meet Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress), a girl who collects seashells on the island. Together, they attempt to stop Dr. No's villainous plans before it is too late.

This film, while not Connery's best performance as Bond, solidified  Bond's image in pop culture for years to come. The scene where the audience meets Bond for the first time at a Baccarat table is classic. The gadgets were not introduced to the James Bond franchise until the second film, but ""Q"" does make an appearance (however, he is not played by Desmond Llewelyn).

If anything I really like to watch this to see how Connery really melted into the role. Right away, he owns the character and plays a handsome yet deadly bond. To knit pick, the story of Dr. No seems actually rather boring, I found it really hard to connect with what was going on. The movie also lacks with the villain. What really was the purpose for Dr. No's metal hands? They seem kind of pointless. Also why does the James Bond theme always play when he's doing absolutely nothing relevant to the story at all. He could be walking in the supermarket and they would play that music.
I'm not trying to make this movie sound terrible by any means. I find it to be very entertaining. Ursula Andress was a beautiful addition to the film and made for some very excellent scenery. Also, I really liked the fight in the beginning of the movie, when Bond can't stop the guy from taking the cyanide. It's all good fun.
While I don't consider this the best movie, I consider it the most important because it really opened up a world of possibilities.

703401,4,6303651453,"Bond, James Bond; the legendary words uttered by Sean Connery in Dr. No have become a cinematic emblem among movie fans and newcomers as well.
Dr. No was the 2nd James bond movie, that's if you count Casino Royale as the first one (the 1954 version of course) but officially this is the first theatrical film released by EON productions.

Dr. No is adapted from the 1958 Ian Fleming novel of the same name. The novel and the film are very reminiscent, only tiny differences changed; such as the mentioning of S.P.E.C.T.R.E  wouldn't be mentioned in the novels until Thunderball.

Sean Connery's portrayal of the lethal but cool secret agent is mesmerizing; til this day I think he is the perfect impersonator of the character. Only two actors have made the role as good as Connery, and that is Timothy Dalton and Daniel Craig. Moore's portrayal was more of a play boyish/Humoristic character. Peirce Brosnan was also a very good contender but the last two movies he did were poor compared to the previous one he had made. And Lazenby never got to make the role his own; he wasn't bad but didn't feel like bond.

As for Dr. No's plot it's quite on the fantasy level. After a commander named Stangways is killed by three blind men (ahem, supposedly blind) and kill his secretary as well, Bond is sent by M to investigate the ""disappearance"" of Dr. Strangways in Jamaica. As well the U.S. is a bit puzzled why there missiles are deflecting. Bond finds out that Strangways could have been killed because he had discovered radioactive rock samples from an Island called Crab Key; where of course our malicious villain has his secret lair. Dr. No is planning to topple missiles, meaning that he will deflect nuclear weapons with a radioactive beam of some sort. Now it is up to Bond to stop him and save the day.

Since Dr. No is the first film, it tends to have a bit of a weaker established plot. The movie is overall very good, but it's missing what the future bond movies would have; and that is the gadgets, Blofeld, and the amazing cars. Other than that the flick is a solid good BOND extraveganza, much better than the disappointing You Only Live Twice. Definitely worth watching and owning for any avid fan of the genre.

This movie is just over 45 years old (counting from the date of this review).

(Sir) Sean Connery made six EON (or ""official"") movies with him starring as James Bond.  They were: (1) Dr. No (1962) (2) From Russia with Love (1963) (3) Goldfinger (1964) (4) Thunderball (1965) (5) You Only Live Twice (1967) and (6) Diamonds are Forever (1971).

As you can see from the above list, ""Dr. No"" is the first spy film of the British Bond series.  As well, it is the first to star Connery as the fictional MI6 agent Commander James Bond (code number 007).

This movie is based on the 1958 novel ""Dr. No"" by Ian Fleming (1908 to 1964).

Briefly, Bond is sent to Jamaica to investigate the death of a British agent.  The trail leads him to the island home of the reclusive Dr. Julius No.  Bond uncovers Dr. No's plot to disrupt American rocket tests, and scuttles his operation.

Note that this movie does not show Bond earning his ""double-0"" status which gives him a licence to kill but presents him as a seasoned veteran.

There is no title song sung at the beginning of this movie.  Instead there is instrumental music that has the James Bond theme music with lively Jamaican music.

This movie has several things it introduced to the James Bond series.  Here are some: (1) the distinctive James Bond theme (2) the gun barrel sequence (3) Bond girls (4) the criminal organization SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion) and (5) Bond's signature Walther PPK handgun.

However, the real reason that this movie is so significant is that it introduces Bond to the world.  This movie was such a success no doubt because of Connery's acting ability.  He brings a certain savoir fare to the role.  Who can forget Bond's memorable debut to the world:

At a card table smoking a cigarette telling a beautiful woman that he's ""Bond...James Bond.""  As he speaks these words, the James Bond theme music plays in the background.  Mere words can't adequately express this PRICELESS scene.  You HAVE to see it for yourself.

The main Bond girl is Honey Ryder played by Ursula Andress (whose voice was dubbed).  Joseph Wiseman gives an unforgettable performance as Dr. No, a reclusive member of SPECTRE.  Jack Lord (who would be later known for the hugely successful and long-running ""Hawaii 5-0"" television series) plays Felix Leiter, a CIA operative.

Some say that Q (the gadget master) is not in this movie.  Actually he is.  But he's played by a different actor (not the actor everyone is used too) and is addressed as ""Armourer"" and Major Boothroyd.  He replaces Bond's Beretta handgun with a Walther PPK handgun.

M and Miss Moneypenny are also in this movie.

This movie was filmed in Jamaica and London, England.

When first released, this movie made about sixty million dollars worldwide.  That's about four hundred and twenty-five million in today's dollars.

The only problem with this movie was the ending.  It seems that the screenwriters were overly-concerned with introducing James Bond to the world.  They do a great job of this.  But they may have realized that the movie was getting too long.  Thus the actual time they give to Dr. No on-screen is minimal and they make things too easy for Bond thus wrapping up the movie much too quickly.  In other words, I was disappointed with the ending.

The DVD itself (the one released in Sept. 2007) is flawless in picture and sound quality.  This movie has been digitally restored and I'm sure the picture is just as good (if not better!!) than when it was released just over 45 years ago.  As well, there is one extra in the form of an audio commentary.

Finally, here is some information to consider.  This DVD is actually the first disc of the two-disc ""Ultimate Edition.""  Bond fanatics might want to purchase this two disc Ultimate Edition since the second disc has ""the best collection of special features ever assembled for Bond.""  (Unfortunately, the Ultimate Edition is no longer available but it can be purchased second-hand.)

In conclusion, this was the Bond movie that started it all!  For the true Bond enthusiast, this movie is a must!!

When the first James Bond films hit the theaters I can remember an acrimonious discussion with my future mother-in-law about how my future wife was not allowed to see those ""kinds of movies""! (My wife and I were high-school teenagers at the time.) In the ensuing years, we had lots of laughs over this episode .... but I was hooked on James Bond movies. There is only ONE James Bond and that is Sean Connery. Dr. No is the one that got me hooked and I have seen every episode several times. The simplicity of Dr. No is one of its attractions. This was a ""pre-gadget"" and ""pre-Q"" film!",1212624000,2,648,4.319672131147541
703446,4,6303651453,"Would you believe I had the Dell/Gold Key comic that was based on this film? Do you have any idea what that sucker'd be worth today? OUCH! Anyway...all hail the maiden voyage of the SS 007-Franchise! It would be one of the few of the series to adhere faithfully to the novel it was named for.

Sean Connery, (it was almost a year before I learned how to pronounce his name correctly, [like everybody else, I thought it was 'Seen Canary']) shows us immediately why he is still the quintessential 007: cool-minded, droll, all-business when needed....he would put his heir, Roger Moore, to shame!

One thing you could always date the 007 movies by was the style of the Bond girls in each movie, at least in the sixties....and Sylvia Trench is obviously being played by a woman whose aesthetic sense is rooted in the late fifties rather than the early sixties. Every OTHER woman in the movie pretty much sticks to a style that could be plopped in ANY post-war decade, but Trench pretty much betrays ""Dr. No's"" early-sixties origins.

The movie pretty much follows the book almost line for line, except for the way Dr. No himself looks and the very end, when Bond defeats him. I often think that, if they had used the book's ending, this film, before this series had garnered the great reputation it would eventually develop thanks to ""Goldfinger"", would have been its own self-parody. Cormorant guano, indeed! ;-)

The transfer I have is beautiful: sound, picture quality, etc....all good. And now I have all three of the BEST Bond flicks, the beginning Bonds, on dvd....Talk about hog heaven.

703447,5,6303651453,"This is hard-core James Bond for the true fan who appreciates that there is Sean Connery and there is everyone else in this role. Joseph Wiseman is antiseptically frightening as Dr. No, and Jack Lord is a lively, pleasing Felix Leiter. But as always, Connery is superior -- the only Bond who really matters.",1204243200,,307,4.703703703703703
703448,4,6303651453,"Hard to believe now, but on its first release the film that started it all was sold as much on the scenery as anything else. In the days before foreign package holidays really took off, the glamorous locations gave the low-budget film an exotic look that helps hide some of its limitations.

Terence Young, Cubby Broccoli and co-writer Richard Maibaum had all previously worked together on the Alan Ladd starrer The Red Beret - indeed, many of the Bond regulars had worked on Broccoli's fairly undistinguished British pictures - and at times the initial uncertainty of tone is noticeable, with the film occasionally threatening to turn into a predictable British `quota quickie' at times. Young's direction of some of the early scenes is, it must be said, rather ham-handed - indeed, turn down the colour and you could be watching an early episode of The Saint. You can even see the arc lights reflected on the paintwork of the getaway car at (something that would become one of the series less recognised trademarks in the Connery years!).

Its attitude to the black characters is also rather less than enlightened - not just Bond treating Quarrel like a houseboy (""Fetch me my slippers, Quarrel."") but also the way John Kitzmiller is required to turn into Stepinfetchit in the `dragon' scene. Considering British films' strong record on tackling racial issues in the 50s and 60s up to the sixties, this may possibly be attributable to the fact that the Bond films, while British, were always produced by an American and a Canadian: certainly Hollywood was somewhat lagging behind British cinema on the race relations front at the time. But if you can ignore that, there's much to enjoy: Connery introducing himself with the immortal ""Bond, James Bond"" for the first time and Joseph Wiseman's superb villain's equally memorable entrance (""One million dollars, Mr Bond.""); Ursula Andress emerging from the sea; the spooky Sisters Rose and Lily; and some good action scenes.

The film also has a darker tone than any its successors until Casino Royale. Bond is quite cold blooded in a way he never was again during Broccoli Sr and Saltzman's watch, be it sleeping with a girl while he waits for the police to arrest her or waiting for Dent to empty his gun before killing him (""That's a Smith and Wesson and you've had your six.""). Similarly, Honey is not above the use of a Black Widow spider on those who have wronged her (""It took him a whole week to die,"" she tells Bond matter-of-factly).

Sadly, while pitched as the `Ultimate Edition,' the transfer is still problematic. The picture quality is certainly improved, but rather than the original British 1.66:1 ratio, it's presented in the cropped 1.85:1. There aren't many new features - featurettes on restoring the films, the premiere and a 1964 archive featurette `The Guns of James Bond.' Most of the features from the original release have been carried over (with the exception of a double-bill trailer which can be found on the From Russia With Love Ultimate Edition), though accessing the film is more laborious than it needs to be as you work your way through logos, promos, dull but unskippable `set' menus that take you to another menu that take you to a sub-menu that take you to another logo and not one but two copyright warnings before you can get anywhere near the film or a special feature (a feature on all the Ultimate Editions, as are the poorly designed, slow and far too small stills galleries).

Thanks to the contributions of director Terence Young, set designer Ken Adam, editor Peter Hunt and composer John Barry, the 007 style was immediately established in this Jamaican adventure. Producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli should be applauded for getting the most out of their limited budget. ""Dr. No"" succeeds as an unpretentious spy thriller  minus the gadgetry and gimmicks in later Bond outings.

Connery (Bond) is dispatched to investigate. Cleverly avoiding 4 assassination attempts, Bond solicits help from Andress in investigating Crab Key, a remote island owned and operated by a feared Chinese megalomaniac, Dr. No. Bond turns the tables on this madman, first by escaping, then by rigging a ""China Syndrome "" which completely deestroys the island as he and Andress escape. Strange, but the movie hasn't aged a day in 45 years, even though John Kennedy was President and the L.A. Dodgers were sweeping the Yankees in the World Series. It's still a fresh, breezy, suspense movie well worth watching.",1198195200,5,958,5.147435897435898
703452,5,6303651453,"This is the one that started it all, and in many ways it was never surpassed:  sure, the plots became more intricate and spectacular and the effects slicker, but this one set the pattern for all the rest.  The thing that is most fun about it is that you can feel the raw newness, before it became a plodding formula.  Even several later continuations with Sean Connery are not nearly as good.

The essential Bond elements pioneered in this one are Bond's charm and easygoing sexuality with the flawless girls that seem to flock to him, his elegance, his cold-bloodedness and efficiency as a killer, and of course, the quirky baddie with oversized ambition and talent for destruction.

Perhaps because I saw it at such a young age with my beloved dad, this one is my favorite by far. Dr. No is such an evil, charismatic character, the perfect foil for the dashing Bond, who is a great improvisor and destroyer in his own right.  But Connery brings a grittiness and realism to it that all the other Bonds couldn't quite.  That makes him the one and only best.

Indeed, as this was made for a far less explicit time, it is full of titillating tidbits, implied throughout with understated and very dry humor.  This is truly superior to most contemporary spy films, with the possible exception of the Bourne films, which set their own standard.

Warmly recommended.",1197763200,4,1360,4.676470588235294
703453,5,6303651453,"From the opening strains of The James Bond Theme over the first gunbarrel opening, Dr. No propels the audience into the world of James Bond. The trio of Dr. No, From Russia With Love and Goldfinger got the series started with a bang and created a standard that has never quite been matched, even by great later entries like On Her Majesty's Secret Service, The Spy Who Loved Me and For Your Eyes Only. Director Terence Young's tough, violent tone in Dr. No does Ian Fleming's books proud and it's unfortunate that that tone wasn't maintained throughout the series. The locations, editing and casting are top notch. The only way the film really fails is in the casting of the wooden Jack Lord as Felix Leiter. In the books Leiter was a tall, blone, skinny gregarious Texan. Lord, in contrast, looks like he wandered off the set of Hawaii-Five-0 onto this film. Luckily, Leiter isn't that important to the film, so any negative effect is minimal.

However, Dr. No owes its success chiefly to two moments -- two of the greatest entrances in screen history. One is Honey Ryder's (Ursula Andress) entrance on the beach on Dr. No's Crab Key. Andress immediately became an object of desire for millions of red blooded males with her tanned sensuous body and skimpy bikini (in the book Dr. No, Ryder was naked). After 42 years and god knows how many sexy women, Andress' Ryder is still the standard. And unlike so many of the later Bond heroines, Andress' Ryder is a tough, intelligent woman who can take care of herself. When Bond promises he won't take the shells she sells to support herself, Andress answers, ""I promise you you won't, either."" Later, when she tells of killing her rapist with a black widow spider, even Bond recoils in mild shock. Andress' entrance opens the concluding act of the film and creates one of the more memorable Bond heroines of all time.

The moment that defines the film and is probably one of the greatest moments in screen history is, of course, Sean Connery's entrance as James Bond. Legend has it that Ian Fleming was horrified when he met Sean Connery, but quickly changed his tune when he saw his entrance as James Bond onscreen. Connery says the famous line ""Bond, James Bond"" with such confidence and sex appeal, he instantly burns his mark into the series (which turned out to be a double edged sword when he tried to work outside the series). Next to Orson Welles' entrance in The Third Man, Connery's entrance in Dr. No is probably the best. Every time the clip is shown at the Academy Awards or other such award show, it still draws applause from the audience. It isn't a stretch to call it a landmark in film history.",1196121600,2,2657,4.627118644067797
703523,4,6303651453,"This is where it all started, and it can be easily overlooked with 21 more recent Bond films out there.  Despite the fact that Dr. No goes all the way back to 1962 and has a very low budget of 1 million, you will be rather surprised to see how well this film is, even for today's standards, if you have not seen it.  While I did not originally doubt it would have a decent story, the older picture quality and sound kept me at bay.  Now with the digital and auido upgrade of this re-release, it's a perfect time to go back (or begin) with great nostalgic Bond, performed by the great Sean Connery - arguably the best Bond to ever fill the screen.

If you know about From Russia with Love and Goldfinger, and the fact that they are two of (if not) the best Bond films ever made, Dr. No comes up a little short.  Naturally though, since these 2 later films were given a bigger budget among other things to expand on.  For what Dr. No was allowed for its time, it produced a fine movie with an exceptional story that can still compete with anything produced today.  I think the smaller budget kept the focus on story, and that's what makes Dr. No most memorable, and most engaging.  The pacing was fabulous and every scene was intriguing whether it be the presence of fascinating characters or the beautiful on location shots of Jamaica.  The villain's entry came 2/3 through the film, making it all the better.  His name was such focus throughout, that you were so curious that when he was finally revealed, it was a powerful event.  Dr. No came off as one of the more natural Bond villains, but his easy defeat was a bit dissapointing to see.

If you have never seen Dr. No, you must watch it now.  You will not regret it unless you can't help but desire an overload of action on your plate.  For everything else a great Bond film is and perhaps more, Dr. No carries it well.

703524,5,6303651453,"I always considered DR. NO to be one of the better Bond films and closer to the literary James Bond created by Ian Fleming. Sean Connery's performance is that of the no-nonsense dedicated civil servant. His screen presence alone conveys the physical, intellectual and moral conviction of the character. He is essentially a modern day version of the white knight slaying the dragon for Queen and country.

Joseph Wiseman as Dr. No is one of the best villains of the series. His steel mono-toned performance is eerily unsettling. He remains one of the most enigmatic villains in the series. He is a villain moved more by unfounded revenge than by greed or riches. You almost sympathize with him as he makes futile overtures to Bond imploring him to join his organization. It seems that Bond is the only man capable of appreciating his intellect. Not even Dr. No's backers, Blofeld and S.P.E.C.T.R.E. are worthy of his talents.

Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder leaves one of the most indelible images of the series as she emerges from the sea clad in her white bikini. She is characterized by the simplicity of her goodness and naivet as she is drawn into a vortex of worldliness that Bond further engulfs her in. Rather than that of a supposed sex object, she exudes a raw femininity found only in nature. Bond can not help but feel that he has corrupted her both deliberately and inadvertently in his blind quest to revenge the deaths of fellow agents. This is the very strength of Richard Maibaum's script, here and on subsequent Bond films.

These films, the better ones, are about Bond, his adversaries, his loves and his friendships. Jack Lord was the first of many actors to play Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA friend. ""Friend"" in the world of James Bond is not a word used casually. Lord seemed the one actor to visually convey the camaraderie that existed between these two characters. John Kitzmiller gave a very good performance as the loyal Quarrel, one of the most important characters in he entire series. This character epitomized the dormant qualities found in the instincts of the common man. When called upon in the death struggle of good vs. evil he is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.

Anthony Dawson as Professor Dent seems perfect as a man who knew better than fall into an inescapable web of subterfuge that Dr. No has spread from his island to the mainland. Zena Marshall as Miss Taro is a more willing participant, as she appears eager to overtly display her sensuality and share her sexual appetites openly with Bond. She is supposed to lure Bond to his death. Finding this not the case she enthusiastically offers herself to Bond. It is in these scenes that Sean Connery displays a certain animal screen presence that no other actor has ever equaled in the role.

Many elements that distinguish a James Bond movie were introduced in this film. The opening gun barrel trademark, ""The James Bond Theme,"" Bernard Lee's portrayal of the inimitable M, Lois Maxwell's portrayal of the desirable Miss Moneypenny, Ken Adam's innovative and distinctive production designs, Maurice Binder's unique main titles, the ""Martinis shaken not stirred,"" just to name a few are all here.

Director, Terence Young, always boasted and took relish in how he supposedly shaped the look and feel of the James Bond series. This is quite possibly true when looking at DR. NO. It is a film visually rich with well-detailed and defined characters. It also has an uncanny feel for the settings inspired from the Ian Fleming novels whether it be Bond's intelligence headquarters in London, the exotic sights and sounds of Jamaica or the incongruity of Dr. No's plush lair hidden in the mosquito invested swamps of Crabe Key.

DR. NO is also characterized by quick paced editing by Peter Hunt. Hunt's innovative technique keeps the story moving visually and unobtrusively which also further defines the cinematic world of James Bond.

But coming full circle, it is Sean Connery's performance and screen presence that intrigues and captures the imagination of the viewer. Given the sets, the music, the script, the locations and all the other elements, it all comes down to how Sean Connery fits and moves through this cinematic world that has been created for James Bond. Sean Connery's performance is indeed that of Britain's dedicated civil servant. DR. NO is the benchmark.",1191542400,4,4369,4.894594594594595
703525,4,6303651453,"It is 1962 and the James Bond saga is already about 10 years old...by Ian Flemings' standards at least. It was 1952 when the first Bond book was written by this former WW2 intelligence officer and published. That was ""Casino Royale"".Four more followed. The first four were mildly successful then ""From Russia With Love"" seemed to break Flemings' writing career wide open.
Two film entrepreneurs by the name of Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli(his family was famous for their namesake vegetable!)cast a then virtual unknown Scottish body builder by the name of Sean Connery in the role of James Bond in their first film of what was to become a highly successful franchise built on Flemings' works. Some of the films followed his works more closely than others. Flemings'Bond,from what I recall in reading them years ago, was a much darker or somber figure than the one created for the screen. George Lazenbys' portrayal in""On her Majesty's Secret Service"" was more true to Fleming form,but was a box office flop due to Connery's portrayal of the character and subsequent popularity thereof.
Dr. No was a great beginning to the franchise. And this newly released version(and all the other Connery Bonds I will review) are remastered and look more vivid than I have ever seen them. MGM in the opening disc commercial calls their work on this a revolutionary new process. Well don't be fooled. This kind of frame by frame restoration has been around and in use by other concerns for some time now. It's just that MGM has finally gotten around to using it more and touting it. MGM(and ALL companies) should think seriously of releasing all their products this way....it is way overdue. MGM's fortunes have fallen dramatically over the years. Once the kings of Hollywood they now rarely hit much box office gold. Fox,Universal and Paramount are beating them big time and have for years now. I would like to think Sony Picture's take over of MGM has maybe given them a kick in the derriere...they need it. Let's face it MGM may not lead the pack like they used to but they have got one heck of a treasure trove of product sitting in their vaults at the moment. And what better way to start to gain back some of that all important revenue than to re-release their stored product in the most pristine form they can? It surely cannot hurt. But I digress.
Dr. No was released to great fanfare in 1962 and was a big hit for Broccoli and company and United Artists. The movie opened with a new and original difference. The hero walks into frame silhouetted in a side shot while the music plays cool and steadily in the background. We seem to be looking through one eye of a mask when suddenly he turns and shoots in our direction. The screen slowly turns red,the mask eye shakes and then all momentarily goes dark. We realize we were looking through the eyes of some unknown criminal who Bond has ""erased"".It was new,different and totally fresh and the public showed their appreciation at the box office. All subsequent Bonds(up to the current one)would repeat this opening.
The cool music accompanying this film would be performed by legendary composer/conductor John Barry. A great theme that has never lost its' appeal and when you hear the famous guitar strains you know exactly what you're listening to. Another great touch(of many)that make(especially) these early Bond films so memorable.
This movies' plot moves along at a great pace and the tension never lets up. It concerns the interference of the launching of rockets from Cape Canaveral in Florida from source unknown. A British Intelligence operative in Jamaica,by the name of Strangway and his assistant,are murdered. Bond proceeds there and gets some help from a CIA agent played by Jack Lord(of later""Hawaii Five-O"" fame).It seems Strangway had gone to a local island called Crab Key and had returned with some radioactive rock samples. Crab Key also seems to be the home of a ""dragon"".Our Bond gets over to Crab Key toute suite and lands right into the clutches of villain Dr. No in his hideout there. Dr. No is played to perfection by Joseph Wiseman.
Will Bond be able to save the world from the evil plans of Dr. No?That's for you,dear readers,to find out.
There are a few ""firsts"" in this film. Besides the obvious introduction to Bond himself,we find ""M"",Bonds' boss in this and subsequent Connery Bonds,played wonderfully by Bernard Lee.""Money Penny"" a small but wonderful and endearing part played by Lois Maxwell. I still wonder to this day,as we all did way back then,why they didn't pursue a romantic relationship on screen with those two characters. It was such a natural. We are also introduced to Bonds' favourite drink....a medium dry vodka martini,shaken not stirred with a twist of lemon. And of course no Bond movie would be complete without a love interest,or two,or three,or four,or more! This movies' main one was with ""Sylvia Trench"",played by Eunice Gayson. She was one gorgeous start in a long line of Bond sirens he subsequently seduced. This was a famous Bond trait in these films that made his character stand out. Whatever Bond did with women was just that,no explanations,no apologies. That was his world and you accepted it.
Dr. No deserves every one of its' four and a half stars and probably a little more. The cast is impeccable,the plot wonderfully tight and the music is the best. And of course Sean Connery's performance in this and subsequent Bond pictures produced,to me at least,the best,most enduring,convincing and my favourite portrayal of the British Intelligence agent 007 James Bond in the entire series.

703531,4,6303651453,"Outside of Bond fandom very few people know that Sean Connery was actually the second actor to play the character of James Bond. In the 1950s there had been a television production based around Ian Fleming's first spy novel ""Casino Royale"" in which American actor Barry Nelson had played 007 as a US spy with Clarence Leiter as his British counterpart. Fast forward to the early 1960s and work is once again getting underway to bring the fictional spy to the screen. Cast in the lead role is what one UA executive referred to as a ""lorry driver"" and with a small budget (a measly $1 million) there seems to be little hope for the fledgling franchise. Yet when Doctor No (the final choice for the first of the series) hits screens it changes the film industry, sending reverberations the likes of which are still being felt today. Staying largely faithful to the Fleming book of the same name (something that was not to last) the rather modest movie set screens afire, helped enormously by the performances of Sean Connery and Swiss beauty Ursula Andress. In fact for many, Andress is the quintessential Bond girl, establishing one of cinema's most iconic images as she emerges from the sea in a white bikini). Right away the trademark violence is evident as three assassins murder a British operative and his pretty secretary in Jamaica. The break in communication has the British nervous and they send for their top agent. Switch to a smoky casino in London. And we see the back of a man, his hands moving his cards about the table and then taking a cigarette out of its case. Lighting it he is fully revealed and the trademark line ""Bond, James Bond"" is heard on cinema screens for the very first time. Arriving in Jamaica Bond learns that the missing operative was investigating the mysterious character of Doctor No who operates from a private island named Crab Key. Determined to learn the truth he arranges to sneak onto the island with his colleague Quarrel to discover the truth behind the disappearance. Taken on its own Doctor No is a nice, taut, suspenseful movie with some wonderful performances from its leads. New York actor Joseph Wiseman is particularly chilling as the title character with his metal hands (some disfigurement or quirk has since become a necessity for Bond villains). Taken as the initial outing in a franchise the movie is a low-key effort that ably sets the stage for the films that were to follow. Today this movie rarely tops people's lists as a favorite in the series, but that is largely because in the ensuing years the Bond series came to mean spectacle and special effects, often at the expense of good storytelling. Initially released on DVD in the cardboard snapper cases with only Bond trivia to complement it, in 2000 MGM did the movie justice by reissuing it as a special edition with improved video and audio and a nice collection of extra's. For the time the Bond special editions were considered the ""cream of the crop"" as far as DVD releases were concerned. Here we have an audio commentary which is comprised of spliced together interviews from earlier - many behind the camera had since passed on including director Terence Young.

703593,5,6303651453,"The year was 1962, the era of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Khrushchev, the Berlin Wall, and the ever present threat that communists would attempt to attack the west with nuclear weapons. Enter James Bond, 007, license to kill. At first the movie makes you believe that James is out to beat a communist threat. Later we learn that the dreaded S.P.E.C.T.R.E. organization is really bankrolling Dr. No. Of course, for the audience of 1962 it had to be the Soviets or the Chinese, so an organization even more dreaded must mean they are truly evil.

Sean Connery does an excellent job in this movie. There are minimal special effects, and some might be considered slightly cheesy by today's standards, but the movie is played very seriously, with only a minimal amount of tongue-in-cheek. James Bond is clearly yet to be a super-spy. He has weaknesses and is quickly put back in his place by M, his boss, when he steps out of line. Remember that Sean Connery was a relative unknown in 1962, having starred in a Disney movie and a few other places. His performance in this movie is indicative of his latent talent; he is precise and assured.

Ursula Andress plays the first Bond girl, Honey Ryder, but is clearly not a blushing beauty. She exudes innocence, and yet she is intelligent and ready to defend herself. She put a black widow spider in the bed of a man who forced her into having sex with him, so she clearly is strong-willed and not to be trifled with.

Jack Lord, already a TV star, makes an appearance as Felix Leiter, playing him in a style that would become famous on ""Hawaii Five-O"" years into the future.

It is easy to compare this 40-year-old movie's special effects with those of today and laugh. For example, the car exploding halfway down the cliff without hitting anything or the ""deadly"" tarantula walking on a plate of glass overlaid on Sean Connery's arm. These minor transgressions only add to the character of what was even then a relatively low-budget film.

The ultimate edition of ""Dr. No"" makes enough improvements over previous versions to make it worth having if you either need to upgrade your VHS tapes or if you consider yourself a huge James Bond fan.  The most important difference is in the quality of the video.  The restorers corrected dozens of problems in the picture and the cleaned the sound.  This version also adds a number of features never seen before, including a feature on the guns of James Bond and another feature on Bond premieres.  This movie also explains the restoration used in the ultimate editions.

One feature I found particular nice to have.  In the previous version of ""Dr. No,"" you had to click to advance to the next picture in the still gallery section.  In this DVD the pictures play like slide show, which I think is a huge improvement.

As I get older, and today's movies become more sophisticated and special effects dependent, sometimes it's refreshing to look back to the days when you could readily tell the good guys from the bad guys, and it was shocking to see a good guy deliberately kill a bad guy. This movie is solid popcorn fare.

703596,3,6303651453,"There is something wonderful about watching the old Bond films.  While the modern installments in the series are heart-pounding action movies that build upon the glamour and style of the originals, there is an unmistakable style and class to the original films that simply can't be recreated.  DR. NO introduces us to James Bond for the first time, confidently portrayed by Sean Connery (whom many consider to be the best Bond).  Immediately, we are drawn into the larger-than-life world of Bond, filled with tons of action, beautiful women, and magnificent villains.  It is the ultimate in escapist entertainment.  And while the original film lacks some of the attributes of the later films (such as an obsession on gadgets and the wonderful ""Q""), DR. NO establishes some of the classic features of any good Bond flick: the opening credit sequence with the famous gun barrel shot, the theme music, the infamous greeting, the medium-dry martinis (shaken, of course), the dry wit, and the impeccable style and taste of our protagonist.

DR. NO is set in Jamaica, though some scenes do take place in the London office of the Ministry of Defense.  Recently, the United States has been experiencing some anomalies: specifically, their rockets have been getting ""toppled,"" diverted off-course by intense radio interference.  The US plans to launch a space rocket to orbit the moon and wish for nothing to go wrong.  The British have been monitoring the situation and the film opens when a British operative, Agent John Strangways, working in the Caribbean is assassinated.  Bond is sent in to discover what happened and quickly realizes that Strangways was killed because he was getting to close.  Bond is greeted in Jamaica with various villains who try to take him out.  There is hardly a soul he can trust.  As he begins to track down what happened to Strangways, he learns of a secret private island (Crab Kay) owned by a Chinese man with the curious name of Dr. No.  The locals are terrified by the island and will not get anywhere near it for fear of a mysterious ""dragon"" that inhabits the island.  Bond, of course, wastes no time in deciding to go to the island to meet this Dr. No firsthand.  The action quickly escalates from there.

DR. NO is interesting for its particular plotline.  Our evil villain has no immediate plans of taking over the world.  Sure, world domination is in the works for later down the road, but the disaster that must be averted is not a nuclear meltdown or the start of World War III.  Rather, it is to prevent the toppling of an American space rocket during its launch.  It is an act of unfounded revenge more than anything else--the brilliant mad scientist determined to get back at the country who rejected him.  Dr. No is the first villain we shall meet who has ties with S.P.E.C.T.R.E, the evil organization that would follow Bond through the early years.  Joseph Wiseman's performance as Dr. No is quite chilling.  He truly set the standard for all bond villains that would follow--a quiet genius, misunderstood by the rest of society, crafting a scheme for world domination while hidden in a secret lair apart from the world.

Sean Connery's performance as Bond is impeccable.  Those who are familiar with the Bond novels often cite Connery as the most authentic Bond, frequently mentioning DR. NO as, perhaps, the most accurate performance in the series.  I would argue that no other Bond manages to capture all of Bond's qualities quite so capably: his intelligence, his hard-hitting athletic style, and his ""way"" with women.  And speaking of women, one cannot mention DR. NO without mentioning the beautiful Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress).  There is no question that Ursula set the standard for Bond women.  In my opinion, she was the best of the series.  The scene in which she exits the ocean, clad in her white bikini, is one of the most unmistakable shots in all of cinema.  Honey Ryder is truly an independent character, one as equally compelling as Bond, instead of just a tag-along for audiences to stare at.

There is no opening teaser before the credit sequence.  The opening credits are rather tame by Bond standards.  Essentially, after establishing the famous gun barrel shot, the circle of the barrel becomes a colored dot, giving way to a colorful sequence of dots that provides the foundation for the colorful credits that would follow in future films.  But the Bond theme sounds wonderful, featured here for the first time.  In many ways, DR. NO is a simplified version of the series.  Bond only kills a few men during the film (confirming his 00 status) and only seduces three women (merely suggested by cutting the scene as soon as Bond begins to kiss each girl).  While his lifestyle is one of refinement, we do not see the extravagance that would come to define the later films.

Like many others, I highly recommend DR. NO for any fan of the film series.  In fact, now that the Ultimate Edition is available, I think that everyone interested in these films should watch the series in its entirety.  The Ultimate Edition looks and sounds like nothing else I've seen.  The quality of this restoration is unmatched.  You will feel like you are watching a new film.  After watching the Ultimate Edition, I don't think I can stand to watch the old MGM transfer.  There is detail and color on this restoration that I've never seen before.  Additionally, this is a two-disc set.  The second disc contains a documentary on the restoration process, an old television production on ""The Guns of James Bond,"" detailing Bond's switch from the Beretta to the PPK, and a documentary on the various ""Opening Night"" parties and showings held for the Bond films over the years.  On top of that, the movie has an excellent commentary included with it.  While these extra features are fun, the true worth of this edition is in the excellent restoration of the film.  It is worth its weight in gold.

Let me make an important note about this edition.  Part of my three star rating has to do with this version.  The MGM Special Edition is a sorry excuse of a transfer.  Fortunately, they finally decided to do things right with the Ultimate Edition.  If you are interested in buying this film (or any of the other Bond films), invest in the Ultimate Editions.  You will be most satisfied.",1172448000,2,6328,4.791320406278855
703597,5,6303651453,"There is something wonderful about watching the old Bond films.  While the modern installments in the series are heart-pounding action movies that build upon the glamour and style of the originals, there is an unmistakable style and class to the original films that simply can't be recreated.  DR. NO introduces us to James Bond for the first time, confidently portrayed by Sean Connery (whom many consider to be the best Bond).  Immediately, we are drawn into the larger-than-life world of Bond, filled with tons of action, beautiful women, and magnificent villains.  It is the ultimate in escapist entertainment.  And while the original film lacks some of the attributes of the later films (such as an obsession on gadgets and the wonderful ""Q""), DR. NO establishes some of the classic features of any good Bond flick: the opening credit sequence with the famous gun barrel shot, the theme music, the infamous greeting, the medium-dry martinis (shaken, of course), the dry wit, and the impeccable style and taste of our protagonist.

DR. NO is set in Jamaica, though some scenes do take place in the London office of the Ministry of Defense.  Recently, the United States has been experiencing some anomalies: specifically, their rockets have been getting ""toppled,"" diverted off-course by intense radio interference.  The US plans to launch a space rocket to orbit the moon and wish for nothing to go wrong.  The British have been monitoring the situation and the film opens when a British operative, Agent John Strangways, working in the Caribbean is assassinated.  Bond is sent in to discover what happened and quickly realizes that Strangways was killed because he was getting to close.  Bond is greeted in Jamaica with various villains who try to take him out.  There is hardly a soul he can trust.  As he begins to track down what happened to Strangways, he learns of a secret private island (Crab Kay) owned by a Chinese man with the curious name of Dr. No.  The locals are terrified by the island and will not get anywhere near it for fear of a mysterious ""dragon"" that inhabits the island.  Bond, of course, wastes no time in deciding to go to the island to meet this Dr. No firsthand.  The action quickly escalates from there.

DR. NO is interesting for its particular plotline.  Our evil villain has no immediate plans of taking over the world.  Sure, world domination is in the works for later down the road, but the disaster that must be averted is not a nuclear meltdown or the start of World War III.  Rather, it is to prevent the toppling of an American space rocket during its launch.  It is an act of unfounded revenge more than anything else--the brilliant mad scientist determined to get back at the country who rejected him.  Dr. No is the first villain we shall meet who has ties with S.P.E.C.T.R.E, the evil organization that would follow Bond through the early years.  Joseph Wiseman's performance as Dr. No is quite chilling.  He truly set the standard for all bond villains that would follow--a quiet genius, misunderstood by the rest of society, crafting a scheme for world domination while hidden in a secret lair apart from the world.

Sean Connery's performance as Bond is impeccable.  Those who are familiar with the Bond novels often cite Connery as the most authentic Bond, frequently mentioning DR. NO as, perhaps, the most accurate performance in the series.  I would argue that no other Bond manages to capture all of Bond's qualities quite so capably: his intelligence, his hard-hitting athletic style, and his ""way"" with women.  And speaking of women, one cannot mention DR. NO without mentioning the beautiful Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress).  There is no question that Ursula set the standard for Bond women.  In my opinion, she was the best of the series.  The scene in which she exits the ocean, clad in her white bikini, is one of the most unmistakable shots in all of cinema.  Honey Ryder is truly an independent character, one as equally compelling as Bond, instead of just a tag-along for audiences to stare at.

There is no opening teaser before the credit sequence.  The opening credits are rather tame by Bond standards.  Essentially, after establishing the famous gun barrel shot, the circle of the barrel becomes a colored dot, giving way to a colorful sequence of dots that provides the foundation for the colorful credits that would follow in future films.  But the Bond theme sounds wonderful, featured here for the first time.  In many ways, DR. NO is a simplified version of the series.  Bond only kills a few men during the film (confirming his 00 status) and only seduces three women (merely suggested by cutting the scene as soon as Bond begins to kiss each girl).  While his lifestyle is one of refinement, we do not see the extravagance that would come to define the later films.

Like many others, I highly recommend DR. NO for any fan of the film series.  In fact, now that the Ultimate Edition is available, I think that everyone interested in these films should watch the series in its entirety.

703598,5,6303651453,"I always considered DR. NO to be one of the better Bond films and closer to the literary James Bond created by Ian Fleming. Sean Connery's performance is that of the no-nonsense dedicated civil servant. His screen presence alone conveys the physical, intellectual and moral conviction of the character. He is essentially a modern day version of the white knight slaying the dragon for Queen and country.

Joseph Wiseman as Dr. No is one of the best villains of the series. His steel mono-toned performance is eerily unsettling. He remains one of the most enigmatic villains in the series. He is a villain moved more by unfounded revenge than by greed or riches. You almost sympathize with him as he makes futile overtures to Bond imploring him to join his organization. It seems that Bond is the only man capable of appreciating his intellect. Not even Dr. No's backers, Blofeld and S.P.E.C.T.R.E. are worthy of his talents.

Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder leaves one of the most indelible images of the series as she emerges from the sea clad in her white bikini. She is characterized by the simplicity of her goodness and naivet' as she is drawn into a vortex of worldliness that Bond further engulfs her in. Rather than that of a supposed sex object, she exudes a raw femininity found only in nature. Bond can not help but feel that he has corrupted her both deliberately and inadvertently in his blind quest to revenge the deaths of fellow agents. This is the very strength of Richard Maibaum's script, here and on subsequent Bond films.

These films, the better ones, are about Bond, his adversaries, his loves and his friendships. Jack Lord was the first of many actors to play Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA friend. ""Friend"" in the world of James Bond is not a word used casually. Lord seemed the one actor to visually convey the camaraderie that existed between these two characters. John Kitzmiller gave a very good performance as the loyal Quarrel, one of the most important characters in he entire series. This character epitomized the dormant qualities found in the instincts of the common man. When called upon in the death struggle of good vs. evil he is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.

Anthony Dawson as Professor Dent seems perfect as a man who knew better than fall into an inescapable web of subterfuge that Dr. No has spread from his island to the mainland. Zena Marshall as Miss Taro is a more willing participant, as she appears eager to overtly display her sensuality and share her sexual appetites openly with Bond. She is supposed to lure Bond to his death. Finding this not the case she enthusiastically offers herself to Bond. It is in these scenes that Sean Connery displays a certain animal screen presence that no other actor has ever equaled in the role.

Many elements that distinguish a James Bond movie were introduced in this film. The opening gun barrel trademark, ""The James Bond Theme,"" Bernard Lee's portrayal of the inimitable M, Lois Maxwell's portrayal of the desirable Miss Moneypenny, Ken Adam's innovative and distinctive production designs, Maurice Binder's unique main titles, the ""Martinis shaken not stirred,"" just to name a few are all here.

Director, Terence Young, always boasted and took relish in how he supposedly shaped the look and feel of the James Bond series. This is quite possibly true when looking at DR. NO. It is a film visually rich with well-detailed and defined characters. It also has an uncanny feel for the settings inspired from the Ian Fleming novels whether it be Bond's intelligence headquarters in London, the exotic sights and sounds of Jamaica or the incongruity of Dr. No's plush lair hidden in the mosquito invested swamps of Crabe Key.

DR. NO is also characterized by quick paced editing by Peter Hunt. Hunt's innovative technique keeps the story moving visually and unobtrusively which also further defines the cinematic world of James Bond.

But coming full circle, it is Sean Connery's performance and screen presence that intrigues and captures the imagination of the viewer. Given the sets, the music, the script, the locations and all the other elements, it all comes down to how Sean Connery fits and moves through this cinematic world that has been created for James Bond. Sean Connery's performance is indeed that of Britain's dedicated civil servant. DR. NO is the benchmark.

The restoration of the picture and sound on this DVD edition of DR. NO s outstanding. The images are outstanding. A very good job was done re-mastering the sound in digital stereo. There is very good stereo separation. The extras are pretty good too concentrating a lot on Ian Fleming's creation of James Bond.",1167609600,13,4682,4.886649874055416

James Bond.""

Bond has dark, rather cruel good looks and a slight scar down one cheek... Tall, handsome, well-dressed, exquisitely mannered, and enormously charismatic, Sean Connery had all the bravura of Ian Fleming's secret agent... He has powerful sex appeal, and is a real lady killer.

Bond--licensed as 007 by his superiors to kill--is an embodiment of pure fantasy... He frequently travels under his own name, making no effort to hide his taste for luxury rivals, and his loves for sensual pleasure... He continually provokes his superiors, and ignores common sense and danger in his combat with villains...

Characterized as a cultivated gentleman and good officer who knows his wines, paintings and weaponry, Bond must often take a back seat to the super-spy hardware with which he is equipped... The technology exhibition play an important part in any Bond films...

With an essential Chinese look, Canadian actor Joseph Wiseman brought to life Dr. No--the first megalomaniac super villain of the atomic age...We first see his black steel hands when he pulls back the bed sheets covering a sleeping 007--Bond's code name... Wiseman looked the perfect combination of crippled scientist and criminal: From his heavily staffed underground base and using atomic energy, Dr. No--on behalf of the SPECTRE organization--was operating a device on the tropical island of Jamaica that massively interferes with the critical rocket launchings from Cape Canaveral...

The plot concerns a British agent, John Strangways, missing in Jamaica... Bond is sent to investigate... He discovered that Strangways was on the track of a certain Dr. No, owner of a mine on the nearby island of Crab Key... The locals avoided Crab Key, believing it haunted... Bond landed there, but instead of ghosts, came upon a girl named Honey on the beach... He was soon caught up in a deadly battle of wits with Dr. No, who planned to destroy the entire US space program...

Ursula Andress coming out of the water on Crab Key, dressed in a skimpy bikini, is the most famous introduction for a performer in screen history--paralleling Omar Sharif's arrival on camel in David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" the same year...

Jack Lord was the first to portray CIA agent Felix Leiter...

Bernard Lee established himself as the perfect authority figure in the fist eleven James Bond movies...

Anthony Dawson had the memorable role of Grace Kelly's attempted murderer in Hitchcock's 1954 thriller ""Dial M For Murder."" As the chief agent of 'Dr No,' this lean-faced Scottish character actor planned numerous assassination attempts to eliminate Bond...

Lois Maxwell is the tall, distinguished-looking woman who portrayed M's secretary, Miss Moneypenny, in 14 James Bond films...

Zena Marshall is the seductive Miss Taro, who appeared fresh from the bath, wrapped in a towel in the hallway of her Blue Mountain cottage... She is the quintessential enemy agent--voluptuous, deadly and expendable...

Peter Burton made his one and only appearance as armorer Major Boothroyd who replaced Bond's gun, the .25 Beretta by the Walther PPK... In following films, his character was renamed 'Q' and was given to Desmond Llewellyn, who made the role his own...

If you really like mystery spoof, this is your chance to see the first and best adaptation of an Ian Fleming spy fantasy, mixing sex, violence and campy humor against expensive sets and exotic locales...

""Dr. No"" had great Calypso ballads: the romantic, ""Underneath The Mango Tree"", the animated ""Jump Up Jamaica"", and the calypso version of ""Three Blind Mice"" to introduce the three blind beggars...",1167091200,5,3929,5.166929133858268

Director Terence Young.  Produced by Albert R. Broccoli, Harry Saltzman, Stanley Sopel. Music by Monty Norman, John Barry.
Based upon the novel by Ian Fleming.
Sean Connery is ""Secret Agent 007, ""James Bond"", in this very first theatrical ""James Bond"" film that started it all (1962-2015).
Sean Connery continued to be Bond through 1967 and returned in 1971 and 1983.  Six ""official"" films and one more declared ""unofficial"" (Never Say Never Again, 1983) because it was made by a different production company not EON Productions.

  In Jamaica, British Intelligence Station Chief, John Strangways (Tim Moxon) is shot by three black men.
  At the Le Cercle Casino, Secret agent 007, James Bond (Sean Connery) meets his first Bond girl, Sylvia Trent (Eunice Gayson). At least she gets his phone number and invitation for tomorrow.
  Duty calls.  He must hurry to the MI6 Headquarters.  Secretary, ""Miss Moneypenny"" (Lois Maxwell, in the role she would play for 23 years, 1962-1985) has been trying to reach Bond all over London.  Bond would rather tease Moneypenny about her affections towards him.  Once in a while, Moneypenny shows a hint of jealousy.
  His boss, ""M"" (Bernard Lee, a role he would play until 1979) tells him his new mission is to find Commander Strangways (Timothy Moxon) in Kingston, Jamaica.  There he will meet with a new co-worker, CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jack Lord, Hawaii 5-O tv series 1968-80).  Major Boothroyd (Peter Burton) gives him the appropriate Walther PPK.
  Bond lands in Jamaica and already has a man on his tail.  He accepts the ride from the chauffeur, Mr. Jones (Reginald Carter) to the Government House.  Along his mission, when he arrives in Crab Key, he sees a bikini-clad woman arising from the sea singing, ""Underneath the Mango Tree"".  She is looking at her seashells. James Bond is looking at...well just looking.  The lady is ""Honey Ryder"" (Ursula Andress).  Of course, Bond will be honorable.  All in a day's work for Bond.  He discovers the villain is Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman).

Look for the pink cadillac with the proper name ""ELVIS"" on the license plate.

This film was not released in the USA until May 8, 1963.

Up until about one year ago,  I had never, ever seen a James Bond movie,  and had not interest in seeing one either,  it just was not my thing.  Then, one cold night (about 1AM) in January of ""05"" I was bored and nothing was on TV.  I somehow ended up on AMC, and they happened to be running a James Bond movie marathon.  The movie I happened upon was this one, Dr No.  the movie was about a third of the way through,  but for some reason, I was captivated,  and could not stop watching...  This movie seriously rocked,  and it from my guess anyways was about 30 or 40 years old!!  Not to mention, I only saw half of the movie.  A few days later I saw it was on again, and this time saw the whole thing,  again,  I was just blown away!!  This was a great movie,  and I am not a movie person.  Getting a root canal was higher on my list of things I would rather do than watch a movie from the 60's! But this was a turning point for me.  The marathon lasted the whole week and I was able to see many more Bond films. Some of my other new favs were, Goldfinger, Live And Let Die, MOONRAKER (my next addition to my DVD collection!!), View To A Kill, and Diamonds Are Forever ( I love the two homo's).  Like I said,  I am not a movie person,not by a longshot.  Never had an interest in this sort of thing before.  But I just cant get enough of James Bond.  I can't wait to get my Dr No DVD.  Rest assured,  this DVD will be getting played every night and as often as possible.  One of the things I like about these Bond movies is how many different sub plots and layers there are to these films.

  I just cant wait.

  As I said in my opening line,  IF YOU ONLY SEE ONE JAMES BOND MOVIE,  THIS IS THE ONE!!!  You will be hooked on James Bond!

From the beginning of this movie you will come across gadgets that only 007 can have, girls that only 007 can date, and troubles that only 007 can handle!

Sean Connery plays role of an MI6 agent who will do any thing for his Majesty's order. His acting was improved in the later movies like Gold Finger, and Thunderball, but he still manages to pull the show brilliantly in this movie. Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder looked stunning from the scene one of her appearance. However, my favorite in all the James Bond series is still the sweetest female of all ""Lois Maxwell"" as Miss Moneypenny!

My favorite soundtracks are: ""Underneath the mango tree"", ""Jump Up"", and the ""The Island Speaks"". Overall, a DVD worth adding to your collection and a must if you are a Bond fan too!",1139443200,16,943,4.607142857142857
703720,5,6303651453,"This first film of the Bond franchise effectively introduced the world to Sean Connery and to his action alter-ego James Bond in 1962. Even forty-some-odd years later, DR. NO, with its deceptively simple settings and technologies, remains among the best of the Bonds.

Monty Norman's ""James Bond Theme"" is in evidence, as is a primitive ""opening montage."" Ken Adam creates some striking sets. All this on a no-frills budget of about a million dollars!

Truly a late Fifties artifact, DR. NO has a small-budget feel, just a little gadgetry, a few very pretty girls (most memorably the amorous Sylvia Trench and of course Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder in her custom white bikini), an unquestionably despicable villain, a restrained quintessentially British  hero, and a good strong storyline, which tracks Ian Fleming's novel comfortably but not entirely faithfully.

Since the film is not following the ""Bond formula"" it has nothing to live up to and operates solely on its own terms. Watch Bond's easy approach to others, and keep a close eye on how others, particularly women, react to him.

James Bond is sent to investigate the disappearance of Commander Strangways, Jamaica's MI-6 Station Chief. His investigation leads him to the mysterious Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman), an eccentric Eurasian scientist with a mad plan for world domination.

DR. NO reminds us that Bond is in his origins and essentials, a secret agent. DR. NO is Bond Simple: Instead of huge set-piece battles, groundbreaking special effects, and overwhelming pyrotechnics, DR. NO relies on characterization and story to hold the viewer's interest.

As with most of the Bond Special Edition DVDs, this one is packed with goodies, although, DR. NO being a ""little"" film, they are a bit slender in comparison to the DVD mega-blockbusters GOLDFINGER, THUNDERBALL, and DIE ANOTHER DAY which had a second ""extras"" disc.

It's clear in the end that James Bond is going places. This movie started the embryonic franchise off on just the right footing. I wish every Bond movie that followed could have been at least as good as DR. NO.",1137628800,4,2093,5.063953488372093

The era of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Khrushchev, the Berlin Wall, and the ever present threat that communists would attempt to attack the U.S. with nuclear weapons. Enter James Bond, 007, license to kill. At first you think that James is out to beat a communist threat. It is only later that it is revealed that the dreaded S.P.E.C.T.R.E. organization is really who is bankrolling Dr. No. Of course, for the audience of 1962, it had to be the Soviets or the Chinese, so revealing that there was an organization even more dreaded must mean they are truly evil.

Sean Connery does an excellent job in this movie. There are minimal special effects, and some would be classed as slightly cheesy, but the movie is played very seriously, with only a minimal amount of tongue-in-cheek. James Bond is clearly yet to be a super-spy. He has weaknesses and is quickly put back in his place by M, his boss, when he steps out of line. Remember that Sean Connery was a relative unknown in 1962, having starred in a Disney movie and a few other places, he wasn't a well-known actor. His performance in this movie is indicative of his nascent talent, played precisely and assuredly.

Ursula Andress plays the first Bond girl, Honey Ryder, but is clearly not a blushing beauty. She exudes innocence, and yet she is intelligent and ready to defend herself. She put a black widow spider in the bed of a man who forced her into having sex with him, so she clearly is strong-willed and not to be trifled with.

Jack Lord, already a TV star, makes an appearance as Felix Leiter, playing him in a style that would become famous on ""Hawaii Five-O"" years into the future.

The quality of the picture and the sound leaves something to be desired. Both need to be restored. However, in a choice between no Dr. No and Dr. No with less than optimal picture, I choose Dr. No. It's also easy to compare this 40-year-old movie's special effects with those of today and laugh. For example, the car exploding halfway down the cliff without hitting anything. Or the ""deadly"" tarantula walking on a projection screen that was supposed to be Sean Connery's arm. Minor transgressions that only add to the character of what was even then a relatively low-budget film.

As I get older, and today's movies become more sophisticated and special effects dependent, sometimes it's refreshing to look back to the days when you could readily tell the good guys from the bad guys, and it was shocking to see a good guy deliberately kill a bad guy.

Joseph Wiseman as Dr. No is one of the best villains of the series. His steel mono-toned performance is eerily unsettling. He remains one of the most enigmatic villains in the series. He is a villain moved more by unfounded revenge than by greed or riches. You almost sympathize with him as he makes futile overtures to Bond imploring him to join his organization. It seems that Bond is the only man capable of appreciating his intellect. Not even Dr. No's backers, Blofeld and S.P.E.C.T.R.E. are worthy of his talents.

Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder leaves one of the most indelible images of the series as she emerges from the sea clad in her white bikini. She is characterized by the simplicity of her goodness and naivet as she is drawn into a vortex of worldliness that Bond further engulfs her in. Rather than that of a supposed sex object, she exudes a raw femininity found only in nature. Bond can not help but feel that he has corrupted her both deliberately and inadvertently in his blind quest to revenge the deaths of fellow agents. This is the very strength of Richard Maibaum's script, here and on subsequent Bond films.

These films, the better ones, are about Bond, his adversaries, his loves and his friendships. Jack Lord was the first of many actors to play Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA friend. ""Friend"" in the world of James Bond is not a word used casually. Lord seemed the one actor to visually convey the camaraderie that existed between these two characters. John Kitzmiller gave a very good performance as the loyal Quarrel, one of the most important characters in he entire series. This character epitomized the dormant qualities found in the instincts of the common man. When called upon in the death struggle of good vs. evil he is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.

Anthony Dawson as Professor Dent seems perfect as a man who knew better than fall into an inescapable web of subterfuge that Dr. No has spread from his island to the mainland. Zena Marshall as Miss Taro is a more willing participant, as she appears eager to overtly display her sensuality and share her sexual appetites openly with Bond. She is supposed to lure Bond to his death. Finding this not the case she enthusiastically offers herself to Bond.

Director, Terence Young, always boasted and took relish in how he supposedly shaped the look and feel of the James Bond series. This is quite possibly true when looking at DR. NO.

DR. NO is also characterized by quick paced editing by Peter Hunt. Hunt's innovative technique keeps the story moving visually and unobtrusively which also further defines the cinematic world of James Bond.

703784,5,6303651453,"Outside of Bond fandom very few people know that Sean Connery was actually the second actor to play the character of James Bond. In the 1950s there had been a television production based around Ian Fleming's first spy novel ""Casino Royale"" in which American actor Barry Nelson had played 007 as a US spy with Clarence Leiter as his British counterpart.
Fast forward to the early 1960s and work is once again getting underway to bring the fictional spy to the screen. Cast in the lead role is what one UA executive referred to as a ""lorry driver"" and with a small budget (a measly $1 million) there seems to be little hope for the fledgling franchise. Yet when Doctor No (the final choice for the first of the series) hits screens it changes the film industry, sending reverberations the likes of which are still being felt today.
Staying largely faithful to the Fleming book of the same name (something that was not to last) the rather modest movie set screens afire, helped enormously by the performances of Sean Connery and Swiss beauty Ursula Andress. In fact for many, Andress is the quintessential Bond girl, establishing one of cinema's most iconic images as she emerges from the sea in a white bikini).
Right away the trademark violence is evident as three assassins murder a British operative and his pretty secretary in Jamaica. The break in communication has the British nervous and they send for their top agent.
Switch to a smoky casino in London. And we see the back of a man, his hands moving his cards about the table and then taking a cigarette out of its case. Lighting it he is fully revealed and the trademark line ""Bond, James Bond"" is heard on cinema screens for the very first time.
Arriving in Jamaica Bond learns that the missing operative was investigating the mysterious character of Doctor No who operates from a private island named Crab Key. Determined to learn the truth he arranges to sneak onto the island with his colleague Quarrel to discover the truth behind the disappearance.
Taken on its own Doctor No is a nice, taut, suspenseful movie with some wonderful performances from its leads. New York actor Joseph Wiseman is particularly chilling as the title character with his metal hands (some disfigurement or quirk has since become a necessity for Bond villains). Taken as the initial outing in a franchise the movie is a low-key effort that ably sets the stage for the films that were to follow. Today this movie rarely tops people's lists as a favorite in the series, but that is largely because in the ensuing years the Bond series came to mean spectacle and special effects, often at the expense of good storytelling.
Initially released on DVD in the cardboard snapper cases with only Bond trivia to complement it, in 2000 MGM did the movie justice by reissuing it as a special edition with improved video and audio and a nice collection of extra's. For the time the Bond special editions were considered the ""cream of the crop"" as far as DVD releases were concerned.
Here we have an audio commentary which is comprised of spliced together interviews from earlier - many behind the camera had since passed on including director Terence Young. Added to that is a documentary on the making of the movie including on-camera interviews, some archival and some new and a documentary on the aforementioned director. Rounding out the set us the usual collection of promotional material.
An easy movie and DVD to recommend.
On a sidenote - work is currently underway by Lowry Digital to restore this movie, if audio and video is of primary importance to you then you might want to wait until that is released in 2006.",1127347200,19,3650,4.749606299212599
703785,1,6303651453,"Dr. No is indeed the original film - and people will often defend an original, no matter what.  But this film is ultimately slow, painfully outdated, and downright silly in parts - combined to be one of the least entertaining entry in the series.  I give it cred for being the inaugural film, but that's as far as I go.

The main issues here is that the film just belongs to a different time, when audiences didn't expect big explosions, lavish car chases, and intriguing villains.  This movie is mainly focused on introducing us to Bond and his world - it sets him up as walking the line between mysoginy and sexual addiction - it introduces us to his cold-blooded nature - and it shows us MI6 and, most importantly for the Connery years, sets up SPECTRE and SMERSH.  It also introduces us to two of the four types of Bond girls - unconvertable bad girls and innocent girls - (the other two are convertable bad girls and throw-away girls, both of which will be introduced in the next two films). We meet Felix Leiter, Moneypenny, and M for the first time.  Finally, it shows us the exotic nature of the Bond settings that will wisk us round the world over the next 20 adventures.

But, for all this set-up, the overall film is lackluster at best.  Aside from some interesting ""hidden island lair"" action near the end, most of the film is very talky. The most painful to watch scenes involve a car chase that is almost entirely shoot against a green screen (which was not very polished in the 60s) and the campy 60s ""hi-tech"" look of men in full plastic radiation suits.  In the car chase, the car following Bond comes up to rear-end him a few times, and because the perspective is all wrong with the rear-projection, when it gets that close the following car looks TWICE as big as the one Connery is in - more like a Semi than a Sedan!

I think the moment that really hits home to me is when Bond has a tarantula crawling on his shoulder (you can see the glass separating the two) and then finally throws it to the floor.  He lunges at it and hammers it with his shoe five or six times as the orchestra dramatically accentuates each hit.  Connery's hair flop all over the place - it's just a very disheveled moment for Bond - very 50s . . . it just kills the whole movie.

I realize this is a hallowed film to fans - but I just have to say that FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is a far better film to begin the series with!

EDITED TO ADD: Having recently re-watched the film, I stand by  most of what I said - but I might have given it two stars - it is still an entertaining movie - but just not as good as the other films in the series.",1125014400,16,2630,4.253012048192771

703787,4,6303651453,"This movie is excellent for those who wish to start a James Bond collection.  Although Casino Royale was the original 007 novel of Ian Fleming's and will be remade for the next film in the series, DR. NO is the original adventure in a full motion picture format.  For James Bond enthusiasts, there are many interesting websites to consider which contain information, trivia, games, and photographs.

Since the film was released in the United States in 1963, it is a little dated, but the storyline follows the novel more closely than recent films of the series.  One example of this shows a patrol boat crew member using a megaphone to give Bond a warning, but when he lowers the device from his mouth, the sound remains at the same volume.  This was also the first major acting roll for Scottish born Sean Connery, who in my opinion has given the best Bond performance of all the actors who followed him.  Indeed, according to authors Lee Pfeiffer and Philip Lisa of The Incredible World of 007: ""His commanding physical presence, rugged good looks, and unique ability to display charm and ruthlessness made Connery an international star overnight.""

By introducing audiences to new essentials of film making, it made James Bond movies the blockbuster series that they have become.  For instance, the opening sequence shows a view looking through a gun barrel at 007 walking, he then suddenly stops, and shoots directly back at the audience. This was an ingenious concept that set the stage for all future Bond movies to present day.  Also, by utilizing Jamaica (rather than the typical cold war era locations of earlier spy thrillers), it added a new element of its own, a tropical flair.  Yet, another such example is the use of a villain donning metal hands, who instead of simply shooting 007, delegates dropping a spider into his nemesis' bed in an attempt to eliminate him.  Writer Alastair Dougall of James Bond the Secret World of 007 states: ""Dr. No's research into radioactivity had had a disastrous side effect - the loss of both of his hands.""  A final touch that was added to enhance the film was the introduction of Ursula Andress playing the part of Honey Ryder.  Her first scene which showed her walking out of the Caribbean Sea onto a beach wearing only a bikini, and a knife was so well liked; it was later used by Halle Berry in the more recent Die Another Day!",1123459200,3,2381,4.722222222222222

Im not going to do a summary of any of the movies considering lots of people have already done that im just going to review parts of it. For starters is Sean Connery, he was just the perfect actor that was picked to play James Bond, he is a cold-blooded killer but at the same time a gentleman and he pulls off both nicely.  The character of Honey Rider is a nice edition to the film although she is not in it for about the first hour, but that first shot of her coming out of the sea is memorable.  One problem this film had was the villian Dr. No.  He is a great villian but the first time we see him is about 90 mins in to the film, so for the earlier parts its just lowsy henchmen.  I don't care for this films action sequences to much nothing to great there, what this film has is the acting and it is done really well. The meeting with Bond and Dr. No is a conversation that makes your eyes glued to the screen.

It was also the only James Bond movie I had ever seen all the way through.  I was in a tiny minority of people in the audience that night who did not like the movie.  But everyone I was with said it was the best James Bond movie thus far.  Well, for years after that, I had decided that if GOLDENEYE was the best, then I certainly did not need to see any more of them.

However, in the last few years I've been hearing from other people that the old ones with Sean Connery (and even a few of the old ones with Roger Moore) are much better, and that I should start there before I just throw the towel in on the whole James Bond series.  So, I rented DR. NO and sat down to watch it.  For the most part I was pleased.  I thought it was more enjoyable (and even much more believable) than GOLDENEYE.  Expecting the acting to be as cheesy as the typical action movie of that era, I was pleasantly surprised to find the performances well above the action-movie standard.

But I must warn the non-Bond fans.  If you're brand new to the James Bond films (as I am for the most part) - all the aforementioned compliments aside - this film is very slow in many parts.  (I didn't even watch it in one sitting.)  It has as many exciting parts (if not more) as boring parts, but the boring parts are still there.

Sean Connery stars as the suave and sophisticated British agent, who here is sent to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of a colleague.  The trail ultimately leads him to the feared island of Dr. No (played with villainous inhumanity by Joseph Wiseman), a mysterious figure whose criminal vendettas could endanger humanity.

Connery makes an impressive debut as James Bond, who is just as cool in his earliest screen appearance as he is in the more recent ones.  Wiseman makes one of the most fantastic Bond villains, while ""Hawaii Five-O""'s Jack Lord portrays Felix Leiter.

Men would want to be like him and women would just want him, no never mind how sexist, amoral and ruthless he may be.  The title villain is an egomaniac with a sense of sinister sophistication rarely seen anymore.  The both fast and well paced story has you hooked from the first sequence.  The film is largely loyal to the novel though it was given a few new touches to adapt it to a film script.  Despite what some have heard, Ian Fleming was very pleased with Connery as Bond.

Sean Connery is James Bond.  That said, being the first in the series and working on a limited budget, ""Dr. No"" still has some kinks to work out.  The title character as assayed by Joseph Wiseman is not that menacing.  Ursula Andress, stunning as she is as she emerges from the water in that white bikini, is a bit wooden.  The film's energy is derived from the magnetism of Sean Connery.  The film also contains the best portrayal of Felix Leiter by Jack Lord.  See this film as the introductory salvo of a great film series but it was not until the next venture, ""From Russia With Love"" that we really start cooking with gas.",1101686400,,841,4.529801324503311

703883,4,6303651453,"Although 'Casino Royale' is accepted as being the first adaptation of Ian Flemming's Bond novels to film, the 1962 release of 'Dr. No' was the first Bond story to be produced by Albert Broccolli.  Broccolli's films would become the most recognized spy films to this day.  It was also Connery's first appearance as the suave and steel-willed British secret agent.

In this film, Bond is sent to Jamaica to investigate the death of fellow agents.  With the help of his CIA contact, Felix (Jack Lord of 'Hawaii Five-0' fame as McGarret), Bond goes to investigate the mysterious Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman)who seems to have had a hand in the murders.  In his investigation, Bond discovers a secret plan to extort the world powers of their wealth.  Typical of Bond, there's no reason to avoid mixing business and pleasure in such exotic assignments, and no company could be more pleasant than that of the gorgeous Bond Bunny of the film, Ursula Andress.

The story tends to be more suspense and mystery solving than the typical gadgetry and action that would become staple crops of the later Bond films.  This is no loss as the film has an excellent script and is well directed.  One of the best Bond films of all time.",1091664000,,1210,4.696682464454977
703884,5,6303651453,"Dr No, the first and one of the very best James Bond movies was released in 1962, and was filmed in London and in Jamaica.

The film begins with the entrance of three blind Jamaican beggars, who shoot a British diplomatic official, before brutally murdering a young British secretary, operating the switchboard at British intelligence in Jamaica.

This sets the scene for a violent battle between British Secret Service and the mysterious forces who have committed these horrible murders.

Enter British agent James Bond, played by the irrepressible Sean Connery, who won immediate fame in this role, setting the stage for forthcoming Bond performances, who must go to pre-independence Jamaica to find out who is behind this all and stop them!

A rollicking adventure of action and intrigue follows, with Bond foiling the minions of the crime syndicate SPECTRE, which include a leggy Chinese siren, who invites Bond up to her apartment in Jamaica's Blue Mountains, while planning various lethal traps, and the perfidious Professor Dent, who learns that trying to kill 007, can be fatal to your health!

The character Professor Dent, a seemingly mild academic, who is in reality a cold-blooded killer, is certainly not hard to fathom, given the plethora in the next 40 years of left-wing academics, who glorify terrorism and genocide!

The climax of the movie comes with the entrance of the absolutely gorgeous Honey Ryder, played by the exquisite bikini clad Swiss actress, Ursula Andress. Who can deny that Ursula was one of the 20th centuries sexiest actresses, after watching her waltz around the deserted Caribbean beach setting , in a skimpy bikini , showing off her perfect golden body , with a face of the sweetest innocence!

Bond, together with Honey, and the ill-fated Jamaican colleague Quarrel, must battle SPECTRE's private army, including a diesel run, fire spitting metallic dragon, before being captured and being brought into the underwater compound of Dr NO (Joseph Wiseman), who suavely explains to Bond his plans for world domination. Bond must foil Dr NO's plans of international sabotage, and rescue Honey in a way only 007 can do.

 The secret ingredient is Sean Connery as he portrays 007 with the ruthlessness and sophistication of the Ian Fleming original novels. Whether coldly disposing of the nefarious Professor Dent,or charming the sexy bikini clad Honey Ryder(Ursula Andress), Connery hit's the mark.

703887,5,6303651453,"When the movie Goldeneye came out I was made aware of the fact that James Bond was not a one hit Phenominnon,(Sorry I don't know how to spell that word) that Goldeneye was one in a series of Great Movies that had been going on since the 60's. Of Course being a little kid at the time the fact that the movie was older than me made me lose all interest in ever seeing those old movies. It wasn't even until that I was in middle school that I actually looked back to any of the movies in the series made before Bronson. The First one I saw was ""Live And Let Die"" Which was good but not good enough to make me go out and start my collection (which by the way now holds all twenty movie in the MGM series). The next one I saw was the first, Dr. No, and I have to say the first time I saw it I hated it, I just thougth it was too slow and did not have enough gadgets, and that was the end of Bond for me, at least for two years.

 My birthday I think when I was in eighth grade my dad got me a few James Bond films because he saw how much I liked the movies Goldeneye and Tommorow Never Dies. The Ones he gave me were GOlfinger and Licence to Kill. Licence to Kill was the one that got me into the series. I also shorly sfter began to appreciate the movie Goldfinger. My small collection had begun.

 For the next few months I went on a James Bond Movie rampage going to Best Buy, Target and Wall Mart almost every weekend. The only movie in the series that I was not to interested in getting was Dr. No. but by the time I had gotten all the other movies I felt that I might as well get it so I could at least say that I had gotten all the movies in the Bond Series. This was a little stupid considering that I had returned that same movie for another movie just a few weeks earlier when I had gotten the movie for Christmas. Anyway I went out to Target and bought the movie and Out of boredom that night from seeing all my other movies way too much I decided to slip the movie into my VCR.I was shocked at how good it was. It was like I remebered the movie very well from the first time I saw it, but that I had seen it through some one else's eyes. I loved it and have now watched that movie more then any of the others in that series. THe worst thing ever to happen to Bond was when he went from Connerry to Lasenby and Moore (considering that he left and the role twice).

 If you like this movie I would reccomend that you go out and get all the movies in the series, at the very least all the ones with Connery. But don't ever get the movie Never Say Never Again, it is a Sean Connery Bond Film made Ten years after he left the series. This orignally was not part of the MGM series and is actually just a horrible remake of the classic movie Thunderball. But as for the rest of the films they are great, (although Roger Moore will definitly get on your nerves somtime at the corny way that he chose to play Bond.",1090368000,,2913,3.937181663837012
703888,5,6303651453,"From the opening strains of The James Bond Theme over the first gunbarrel opening, Dr. No propels the audience into the world of James Bond. The trio of Dr. No, From Russia With Love and Goldfinger got the series started with a bang and created a standard that has never quite been matched, even by great later entries like On Her Majesty's Secret Service, The Spy Who Loved Me and For Your Eyes Only. Director Terence Young's tough, violent tone in Dr. No does Ian Fleming's books proud and it's unfortunate that that tone wasn't maintained throughout the series. The locations, editing and casting are top notch. The only way the film really fails is in the casting of the wooden Jack Lord as Felix Leiter. In the books Leiter was a tall, blone, skinny gregarious Texan. Lord, in contrast, looks like he wandered off the set of Hawaii-Five-0 onto this film. Luckily, Leiter isn't that important to the film, so any negative effect is minimal.
However, Dr. No owes its success chiefly to two moments -- two of the greatest entrances in screen history. One is Honey Ryder's (Ursula Andress) entrance on the beach on Dr. No's Crab Key. Andress immediately became an object of desire for millions of red blooded males with her tanned sensuous body and skimpy bikini (in the book Dr. No, Ryder was naked). After 42 years and god knows how many sexy women, Andress' Ryder is still the standard. And unlike so many of the later Bond heroines, Andress' Ryder is a tough, intelligent woman who can take care of herself. When Bond promises he won't take the shells she sells to support herself, Andress answers, ""I promise you you won't, either."" Later, when she tells of killing her rapist with a black widow spider, even Bond recoils in mild shock. Andress' entrance opens the concluding act of the film and creates one of the more memorable Bond heroines of all time.
The moment that defines the film and is probably one of the greatest moments in screen history is, of course, Sean Connery's entrance as James Bond. Legend has it that Ian Fleming was horrified when he met Sean Connery, but quickly changed his tune when he saw his entrance as James Bond onscreen. Connery says the famous line ""Bond, James Bond"" with such confidence and sex appeal, he instantly burns his mark into the series (which turned out to be a double edged sword when he tried to work outside the series). Next to Orson Welles' entrance in The Third Man, Connery's entrance in Dr. No is probably the best. Every time the clip is shown at the Academy Awards or other such award show, it still draws applause from the audience. It isn't a stretch to call it a landmark in film history.",1087257600,17,2655,4.627118644067797

703950,5,6303651453,"I am a major fan of the James Bond movie series! I know just about everything about the world's coolest secret agent! Fans like me are synonymous with the Bond name. Clever gadgets, gorgeous women, exciting adventure, colorful villians, and cool cars are just some of the things represented of Bond. But surprisingly, the first James Bond movie, DR. NO, doesn't start out with those things we all know of the Bond movies. But DR. NO has amazing sets, creative title sequences, the astounding Bond music, bad guys, beautiful women, and the best Bond of them of all: Sean Connery.
DR. NO was the first film adapted from the books, created by the amazing Ian Fleming. Producers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman bought the books from Fleming, and tried to convince studios to finance them. They had trouble there, which they called the 'Bond thing' too British, and sexual. Luckily, United Artists took a chance on DR. NO, and allocated a meager budget of $1 million.
Next, they cast a virtually unknown Scottish actor named Sean Connery. The studio wasn't too keen on Connery, who beat out actors Roger Moore and Rex Harrison. They also hand-picked the alluring Ursula Andress as the Bond girl, Honey Ryder and cast Joseph Wiseman as the title character, and the first Bond villian. With these perfect cast choices, the film would go on to be a huge hit and launched the career of Connery.
DR. NO was the one of the few films most faithful to the original story, with James Bond sent by M of MI6 to Jamaica to investigate the death of a fellow agent named Strangways. Bond's trail leads him to the isolated island of Crab Key, where he meets the sexy Honey Ryder. Bond is then confronted with the corrupt scientist Dr. No, from the evil SPECTRE organization who is planning to use Crab Key as a launch pad to destroy the U.S space programme and plan world domination, but of course Bond succeeds by foiling the villian's plan and saving the world... for the first time.
Sean Connery personifies James Bond with such perfection that it was hard to imagine anyone else in the role. He's tall, charismatic, demeaning, and perfectly tailored for the role of Bond, who is the connoisseur of fine food and drink, who kills in cold blood and yet is able bed and charm alluring ladies and save the day from vicious villians; it's all in a day's work for the charming British spy, James Bond, who's the perfect anti-hero.
Nobody in the world would have forseen the phenomenon that the James Bond films would become. DR. NO, the very first film, lauched the breathtaking world of James Bond to audiences in 1962, and it still stands even in 2004, where it is a part of existence among people's minds. This will be my first review of the 007 films, as I'm planning to review all of them in order.",1078185600,,2784,4.626262626262626

All 007 movies are approx. 2 hrs. long. Dr. No is one of the few that feel that long when viewing. This film is drawn out, lacluster and out right boring.
Furthermore, Sean Connery is a pathetic actor. Much like Al Gore his persona and performance is robot like. Besides that, he's Scottish. Why in Gods name would he even be an option when casting. He can't even imitate a proper British accent. ... Just because an actor has had a long career doesn't necessarily mean he is talented. For Example: Kevin Costner",1077753600,3,681,4.5

Sent to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of MI5 agent Strangways, Bond stumbles onto the plot of SPECTRE agent Dr. No to destroy the US space program with radio waves.

 Since the plot of the film is so well known , I will stick to the features found on the Special Edition DVD. The print quality is sharp and clear for a forty year old film. If one wishes to see the unrestored quality he only needs to view the original trailers to get some idea. The sound is English Mono and the dialogue comes across with no real distortion.
 The disc features two featurettes. The first ""Inside Dr. No"" gives a great deal of information about the production and has interviews with most of the surviving members of the cast and crew. The second feature ""Terrence Young:Bond Vivant"" explores the career of the Bond director and makes interesting parallels between his life and the character he brought to the screen.
 An unusual commentary includes taped comments and stories from almost all surviving cast and crew members. This commentary track is fact filled but tends to drag slightly. There are also trailers, TV and radio spots and a stills gallery.

Sean Connery was very good in his first time out as James Bond, although a little rough around the edges, but then you couldn't expect him to get it down right the first time!  The extras on the disc are fascinating as well. I found the trailers very interesting, but found the TV spots of the trailer rather grainy.  Also, a short documentary introducing James Bond to the world was very grainy as well. It's these two things that kept me from giving it 5 stars. However, I did find the radio ads for the film fascinating, who'd ever thought you'd be able to listen to the original radio ads for the film?  I didn't think they would exist in this day and age.

703954,4,6303651453,"It's been said that the Sixties didn't really begin until 1964, the year in which The Beatles came to America, and there's something to be said for that thesis. The first James Bond film, released in 1962 in the U.K. and in 1963 in the U.S., has a definite Fifties feel, most evident in the fact that 007 wears a hat, an adornment that John F. Kennedy helped make unfashionable for men and which Bond would never be seen in again after ""From Russia With Love, except in the series' trademark gun barrel opening.
Aside from the headwear, what really seperates ""Dr. No"" from its successors is the music. Except for the now famous ""James Bond Theme,"" it is ordinary background music, completely lacking the ambition and distinction of John Barry who claims he is responsible for the theme for which Monty Norman is still taking bows, but having been called in at the last minute to punch up the score never received proper credit. (A comparison of Norman's score with Barry's subsequent work for the series makes it obvious that Barry is the man who wrote the most famous theme since the the dum-de-dum-dum of TV's ""Dragnet."" Beginning with ""From Russia With Love,"" Barry would score all the Bond films through 1971's ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and would return for five more films before bidding adieu to the series after ""A View to a Kill"").
""Dr. No"" also relies less on special effects and gadgets, and Bond, not quite as quick with a quip as he would be in the remaining films, is less enigmatic, more like a ""policeman"" as the title villain calls him at one point, and less the exotic spy. The lack of humor makes this earliest incarnation of 007 more ruthless, more brutal, and the humor would be introduced in an attempt to offset complaints that Bond, and in effect, the films, glorified sadistic violence.
""Dr. No"" is a memorable debut for modern cinema's most enduring character, and watching it now one can't help but wonder if its creators had any clue that they were giving birth to a phenomenon that is still thriving in the 21st century.",1073692800,2,2045,4.651933701657459

After several rockets crash down well off their flight pattern and an M16 operative is murdered, James Bond is sent to Jamaica to investigate.  Everything points to the mysterious character known as Dr. No.  Bond, joined by CIA agent Felix Leiter, tries to figure out what is causing all these mysterious happenings.  Along the way he deals with several would-be assasins, plenty of gorgeous women and all with his trademark dark humor and wit.  This may be missing some of the elements of later Bond films, most noticably any gadgets, but this still remains a classic film for introducing the world to secret agent James Bond.
 For me, Sean Connery will always be the perfect Bond.  He does not disappoint here as the secret agent with the license to kill.  While the other actors portraying Bond were always good, they were never able to match Connery's appeal or humor.  Ursula Andress is stunning as Honey Ryder, the first Bond girl who everyone knows for stepping out of the water in her famous white bikini.  She has always been my favorite Bond girl.

703990,4,6303651453,"Before it had taken off like a screaming bottle rocket and emerged into an unforgettable, irresistible action-adventure anomaly, the Bond series kicked off with 1962's Dr. No as a technically low-budget film, with a relative unknown at the helm of James Bond, in Sean Connery.  Compared to the more recent Brosnan Bond flicks and even, Connery's successive flicks as 007, Dr. No captures the feel of Ian Fleming's Bond novels, as a straightforward detective movie with an emphasis on espionage and a megalomaniac twist of global implications involved.
In Connery's very first outing as the suave, resourceful British secret agent James Bond 007, Bond is sent out to Jamaica, to investigate the double murder of an MI6 agent, John Strangways and his secretary.  Along the way, Bond dodges aside plots of his own murder, while crawling closer to the culprits and their motive for doing so.  Eventually, Bond unravels that Strangways had discovered critical information about a remote, intimidating island called Crab Key and its dirty secrets and hence, he was taken out for his reconaissance.  Bond follows Strangways' trail to Crab Key, accompanied by a rather superstitious and fearful Kingston fisherman and one of Strangways' closest friends, Quarrel.  Tagging along with a shell diver and seller, the incredibly voluptuous blonde bombshell, Honey Rider (Ursula Andress), of whom Bond met on the shore of Crab Key, Bond encounters the enigmatic, vengeful and cold Chinese scientist and SPECTRE operative, Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman).  Bond exposes Dr. No's diabolical scheme to destroy American rockets, launched from Cape Canaveral, and in effect, obliterate the U.S. space program.
Dr. No is a fairly suitable debut Bond flick.  Unlike the majority of Bond films, Dr. No is not a rip-roaring high-octane action caper, but rather a very steady-paced, deliberate, no-frills, serious detective film, remaining true to the Ian Fleming format of storytelling.  Another obvious difference is the lack of sophisticated, nifty gadgets.  Bond's sole gadget, if you would want to call it that, is his signature Walther PPK handgun.  Continuing with the business-like feel of the film, there are virtually no special effects.  Ergo, compared to latter Bond films, Dr. No has a stripped-down feel, but it definitely has its moments, in particular, Ursula Andress' emergence from the sea in a skimpy, white bikini.  Other than that, despite its carefully-crafted, dialogue-intensive story, Dr. No is somewhat stale in the sense that the characters lack a sense of alluring charisma or for that matter, personality.  Connery lays the foundation of the Bond series well, with a solid outing, portraying the resourcefulness and consummate professionalism of Bond well.  However, Connery is very serious to the extent he does not exude the charisma and the swagger he plays with in his later performances.  Ursula Andress, as the very first lead Bond girl is alluring visual eye-candy all over her, but like Connery, she is rather mundane.  Quarrel, played by John Kitzmiller is somewhat of the comic relief, exhibiting fear, especially with the talk about the Crab Key ""dragon"", with the priceless facial expressions to boot.  A spry Jack Lord of Hawaiian Five-O and Mission Impossible fame reflects Connery's serious snickering gimmick as Felix Leiter, with lesser edge than the former.  Joseph Wiseman is just fine and dandy as Dr. No, who is not revealed until much later on in the film, and for good reason, to preserve his enignmatic aura.
In terms of where it measures up amongst the ranks of Bond films, Dr. No is average and in the middle of the pack.  Its successor, From Russia With Love is a vast improvement over Dr. No, in that it is faster-paced and charismatic, yet deliberate, containing well-utilized action sequences, while preserving the integrity and savvy of the literary, espionage-intensive Bond of the Ian Fleming books.  In conclusion, Dr. No, despite its overtechnical tendencies, is worthy of being checked out.",1055894400,,4023,5.2367601246105915
703991,4,6303651453,"Should historians in a future millennium wonder what came first in the evolution of the 007 films, the gadgets or the Bond Babes, then DR. NO will provide the answer.
This first James Bond film has a young and raw Sean Connery in the title role as the British superagent tasked with thwarting the evil Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman), who plots to destroy an early, American, manned rocket launch - the Mercury program for you children - from his overbuilt hideout on a Caribbean island.
For the record, James carries no gadgets to make life easier. There is, however, Bond Babe Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress) fetchingly but barely contained in a bikini as she emerges from the surf. The various manifestations of the Commander will not see anything so stunning until Halle Berry jiggles onto the sand in DIE ANOTHER DAY (2002).
Wiseman as the villain inspires only yawns. A youthful Jack Lord from his pre-HAWAII FIVE-O days is unnecessary as the local CIA company man. All of Ursula is spectacular, but, since acting obviously wasn't a requirement, she doesn't have to do much more than wet down her scanty costumes as a warm-up for her 1965 ""Playboy"" pictorial.
Compared to any of the recent FX-laden Bond epics starring Pierce Brosnan, DR. NO is almost boring. But Sean Connery has been, and always will be, the pre-eminent 007. So, this film is more fairly compared to GOLDFINGER, perhaps the classic representative of the series, also starring the magnificent Scotsman. Thus, four stars instead of the three it deserves in a larger world view.",1053993600,2,1539,4.855513307984791
703992,3,6303651453,"""Dr. No"" is the movie that introduced Ian Fleming's James Bond to American cinema. Neither Bond nor the movies would ever be the same again. Walt Disney gets the credit for discovering Scottish babe, Sean Connery. A former bodybuilder, Connery was Numero Uno after appearing in Disney's ""Darby O'Gill & The Little People"" and Hitchcock's ""Marnie."" In this, his first outing as Britain's most amiable super spy, Connery cuts such a dramatic swath from the moment he steps before the camera that even today it remains impossible to truly separate the man from this immortal screen character.
To those weaned on contemporary Bond adventures, the plot of this debut movie is tame by comparison. Bond goes up against Dr. No (Joseph Wise), an Oriental mastermind with no hands who is set on toppling American missiles launched from Nassau. The formula of the series so familiar to Bond-philes is absent from this movie, wholly lacking in high tech special effects or gadget driven vignettes that all subsequent Bond films since have rather blatantly abused. Ursula Andreas cuts a handsome figure in her now iconic white bikini as Honey Ryder - a collector of sea shells who finds herself the unwilling guest of Dr. No. Despite its lack of trademark moments, there are several stellar scene stealers worth mentioning; including the moment when Connery utters the immortal ""Bond...James Bond"" line during a card game in a crowded casino, a bedtime sequence in which Bond discovers a tarantula spider crawling up his torso and the classic one liner Bond utters to Honey as she rises from the surf. ""Are you looking for shells?"" she asks. ""No,"" Bond replies, ""I'm just looking!""

Unfortunately there's not much to look at on MGM's DVD. Colors are strong at times, but often quite gaudy and oversaturated. Flesh tones are too orange. Night scenes have a muddy, softly focused characteristic. Edge enhancement, fine detail shimmering, aliasing and chips and scratches in the original camera negative are all present throughout the film. Pixelization is, at times, a distraction. There's a digitally harsh feel to some scenes. The audio is mono and strident. The bass is very shallow sounding while the treble is just too, too grating on the ears. MGM does get top marks for its extras: two documentaries that fully cover the Bond phenomenon and some nice added touches, including a theatrical trailer and audio commentary. One wishes that more had been done to clean up the actual print of the film.",1051488000,3,2487,5.007246376811594
704073,4,6303651453,For the most part I would suggest seeing this movie.  Except that for one thing it is a slower paced bond than any others.  Another thing is the audio track is not that good.  Sometimes you will be watching it and someone will say something and then a few seconds later you will hear.  Making for a bit of uncomfertable watching.  All in all it is a good movie.  Certainly not one of the best James Bonds but certainly not the worst.,1045958400,,433,4.219512195121951
704074,5,6303651453,"This first installment in what would become a legendary film series introduces many, but not all, of the familiar elements.  A young Connery plays the character he made famous in this episode as more aristocratic military man than the uber-cool superspy of the later movies.  Much more plot-driven than the later Bond films, DR. NO lacks the gadgets and athletic stunts (while introducing a low-budget version of the explosions and car chases) that the franchise is now known for.  It features ""sizzling"" Ursula Andress as the first Bond girl and Jack Lord as the first Felix Leiter, with a suitably over-the-top villain played with understated brilliance by Joseph Wiseman.  The orchestral score is occasionally overdone, and some of the effects are campy enough that the modern viewer may find themselves wincing through some of the picture (although perhaps less often than at the modern installments with their much worse one-liners).  An unfortunately large amount of screen time is spent on the stereotyped islander character Quarrel, played by John Kitzmuller, while M and Moneypenny are shorted, and Q is nowhere to be seen.
This is a fallible, analytical Bond, working his way through the mystery of his mission.  If one appreciates a more realistic thriller in which the women have personalities and motivations for their actions, this will likely become a 007 favourite.  Those looking for a more typical Bond-as-superhero movie might want to start their early Bond viewing with GOLDFINGER, but DR. NO, closer to Ian Fleming's vision as it is, remains a classic.
The DVD is introduced with an obnoxious visual display, and distorted rendition of the classic theme, which will make you want to quickly click through to the movie or to the special features.  The forty-two minute documentary included is full of information about the making of the movie, and about the origin of some of the Bond tropes.  It emphasizes the role that director Terence Young had in making the movie Bond personality, as well as revealing the famous Bond theme's own humble beginnings.  It's a refreshingly modest ""making-of"" retrospective that fans of the series will enjoy.",1044662400,2,2164,5.139601139601139

704076,5,6303651453,"Dr. No was the first movie to launch the legacy that would span out into 20 more official movies and 2 unofficial ones. Sean connery brought a suave, witty and violently exciting role to 007.
The movie begins with a British agent in Jamacia called Stranways and his secretary being murdered. Then back in London we are introduced to James Bond. James Bond is called to office, and we are introduced to his boss ""M"" and the flirting secretary Miss Moneypenny. Bond is told that Cape Canaveral is worried because their rockets are being toppled and they think the destructive energy waves are coming from Jamacia where Strangways was investigating the mysterious Dr. No before he was killed. Bond is sent to Jamacia, where is identity is quickly noticed by a photographer and a phony chauffeur who tries to kill him. Bond then meets up with CIA agent Felix Leiter and a local fisherman called Quarrel who are also investigating Dr. No and his island Crab Key. Bond's life is also on stake when a spider is released into his room. Bond discovers the Professor Dent is behind the spider attack and kills him, since he does not talk. Bond and Quarrel travel to Crab Key to hunt down Dr. No. Bond awakes on the island to find the alluring girl called Honey Ryder, who tells them that she collects shells on the island. Suspecting visitors, Dr. No's men fire on the beach to try to find Bond. Bond, Honey and Quarrel travel deeper into the island where Quarrel is killed and Bond and Honey are taken captive. They are taken to Dr. No's laboratory, where they finally meet him over dinner. Dr. No explains to Bond that he is a member of the greatest criminal organization called SPECTRE. His job has been to jam all radio signals to USA rockets in order to destroy each one. Dr. no leaves Bond in a cell to jam the upcoming rocket. Bond escapes and battles Dr. No in the nuclear laboratory, with Bond drowning Dr. No. The rocket is not harmed, and the entire islands lab explodes while Bond and Honey escape in a nearby boat., where they are picked up by Felix Leiter and the CIA.
Dr. No was the movie that set the standard for all other 007 movies with the exotic locales, beautiful girls, dominating villians and the exciting, adventerous missions of agent James Bond 007!",1041379200,,2266,4.57002457002457
704077,3,6303651453,"For those who want to know how James Bond was played before he became an action-and-gadget-focused hero, ""Dr. No"" is a good choice.
You see the basics established pretty quickly: Bond's weakness for women, his intense focus on his mission despite his womanizing, and his fearlessness. You also see formidable adversaries, and there seem to be villains at every turn on his mission in Jamaica -- the chauffeur, the ""blind"" assassins, the photographer, geologist Professor Dent (the excellent Anthony Dawson), and the big guy himself, Dr. Julius No (Joseph Wiseman).
Sean Connery plays 007 with a bit of a ruthless, angry edge, one unseen in the rest of his Bond performances. But his intensity and determination come through as he probes the disappearance of John Strangways, the British Intelligence agent who'd come close to discovering the source of interference with NASA rocket launches.
Wiseman is brilliant as Dr. No, the SPECTRE operative whose radio waves sent from his Crab Key base mess with the rocket launches. He's witty, charming, convincing and eccentric without being cartoonish -- a trend that continued with the villains of the next two Bond movies.
Bond's fellow good-guys give stand-up performances, too. Bernard Lee plays 007's boss, M, with an authority and reserve that's endearing. Same too with M's lovelorn secretary, Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell), whose flirtations with Bond are heartwarming and funny. Jack Lord is icy but knowledgable as Felix Leiter, the CIA man.
My big problem is with Bond's treatment of the native Jamaicans that surround him. While in later films 007 would perfect the art of being comfortable wherever he is, he sometimes seems a fish out of water in Jamaica and compensates with an icy authority -- witness his master-servant relationship with CIA operative Quarrel (John Kitzmiller), the Cayman Islander who's his sidekick through much of the film.
""Dr. No"" is a good film -- closer to Ian Fleming's idea than the later pictures, and an exciting movie that sets the stage for the classic James Bond films to come.",1040428800,2,2064,5.12759643916914
704078,4,6303651453,"Its hard to believe it has been forty years since Sean Connery first introduced himself as James Bond at the blackjack table. But he did, and for that reason alone, this being the first installment in the James Bond series, this film is worth seeing. The classic tune even kicks it off.
Bond is sent to Jamaica to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a British opperative named Strangways. Once he gets down there and starts checking things out it becomes apparent that this will not be routine. Of course not, that's why its Bond! And so the formula takes over (it starts here, not in Goldfinger as some would argue). The formula: sexy women, bizarre henchmen, villian trying to rule the world, great names, dry wit, and lots of action.
I mean, whats there to say? Bond is great. And for that matter so is Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder, the first Bond babe (my favorite next to Barbara Bach as Triple X in The Spy Who Loved Me). Like Bond? For all you fans of the new series with Brosnan (I like him too), its time to go back to the series root and see Connery take it away. He is Bond. Additionally for all you Bond fanatics, this is a great DVD. The making of video and the commentary are interesting and full of facts I never knew. Personally, I love it when I can actually learn from watching special features. And while I'm on the subject I have seen several of the 007 special edition DVD's and they are all great and worth owning.
So, see Dr. No. For the first time or the twentieth time, it doesn't make any difference. After all, if it did Bond would not have thwarted countless scemes to take over the world, been in more fights than Mike Tyson, bedded more women than Hugh Hefner, drank a million martinis, and age forty years and not a day in the process. All he has to do is get up and dust of his suit, no matter what decade, no matter what Bond. He is still, and forever, Bond.",1038873600,,1900,4.339887640449438
704079,4,6303651453,"I was a bit too young to see this film when first released; ""Goldfinger"" was the first Bond that i saw in first-run, but i remedied that omissionas soon as possible *after* being introduced to the Bond series, catching a double-feature of ""Dr No"" and ""From Russia With Love"".
I had begun reading the Bond books even before seeing ""Goldfinger"", and so i knew the original story of ""Dr No""; in some ways, this is one of the more-accurately adapted books of the series (one thing did worry me, though -- the death of a character who also appeared fairly importantly in a book earlier in the series; how were they going to deal with that if they ever filmed the other book?).
Though most of the films open with Big Beat or rock themesongs, this one (appropriately enough) opens with a neat little calypso, and one might say that ""modest-but-appropriate"" describes virtually the entire film -- none of the huge stunts and elaborately-choreographed action scenes that have become the norm in the series, few if any gadgets -- not even a rocket-launcher mounted in his car! -- and a not-too-far-from reality air about the whole production.
USAn audiences' previous main (only?) exposure to Sean Connery had been as Michael, the new gamekeeper/romantic lead in Disney's ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People"" [in which (to quote the old ""MASH"" joke) he only had one eyebrow.  ""Over which eye?"" ""Both""].  If anyone recalled that previous role, this film must have been an interesting contrast.
Well-acted and -cast, nicely filmed (on what, by com parison with later films, must have been almost a poverty-row budget), this was quite a nice introduction to the character and the series.
((Incidentally, there was a US comic-book adaptation of this film, published by National/DC; i remember it but didn't read it...))",1038787200,,1805,4.914754098360656
704080,5,6303651453,"This was the first Bond film made all the way back in 1962.  The film is now 40 years old yet it still holds up very well.  The reason it has stood the test of time is that it focused on story-line and characters rather than gadgets.  I enjoy the current films with their stunts, but, what always stays with me the longest is the storyline.  If you are a Bond fan you simply have to own the first, the original James Bond; the one that started it all.  This film introduced the world to Sean Connery, (and we were all made the richer for it), as well as the quintessential ingredient of all Bond films; the Bond Girl--in this case Ursula Andress.  Interestingly enough Ursula has more in common with the modern Bond Girls and their tough, independence than she did with many of the ones that would follow in the series, (especially during the Roger Moore era).  I don't own every Bond film, but, I do think you owe it to yourself and your collection to own the one that established the genre and originated a 40 year franchise.",1038614400,,1027,4.345549738219895
704142,5,6303651453,"The year was 1962.  The era of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Khrushchev, the Berlin Wall, and the ever present threat that communists would attempt to attack the U.S. with nuclear weapons.  Enter James Bond, 007, license to kill.  At first you think that James is out to beat a communist threat.  It is only later that it is revealed that the dreaded S.P.E.C.T.R.E. organization is really who is bankrolling Dr. No.  Of course, for the audience of 1962, it had to be the Soviets or the Chinese, so revealing that there was an organization even more dreaded must mean they are truly evil.
Sean Connery does an excellent job in this movie.  There are minimal special effects, and some would be classed as slightly cheesy, but the movie is played very seriously, with only a minimal amount of tongue-in-cheek.  James Bond is clearly yet to be a super-spy.  He has weaknesses and is quickly put back in his place by M, his boss, when he steps out of line.  Remember that Sean Connery was a relative unknown in 1962, having starred in a Disney movie and a few other places, he wasn't a well-known actor.  His performance in this movie is indicative of his nascent talent, played precisely and assuredly.
Ursula Andress plays the first Bond girl, Honey Ryder, but is clearly not a blushing beauty.  She exudes innocence, and yet she is intelligent and ready to defend herself.  She put a black widow spider in the bed of a man who forced her into having sex with him, so she clearly is strong-willed and not to be trifled with.
Jack Lord, already a TV star, makes an appearance as Felix Leiter, playing him in a style that would become famous on ""Hawaii Five-O"" years into the future.
The quality of the picture and the sound leaves something to be desired.  Both need to be restored.  However, in a choice between no Dr. No and Dr. No with less than optimal picture, I choose Dr. No.  It's also easy to compare this 40-year-old movie's special effects with those of today and laugh.  For example, the car exploding halfway down the cliff without hitting anything.  Or the ""deadly"" tarantula walking on a projection screen that was supposed to be Sean Connery's arm.  Minor transgressions that only add to the character of what was even then a relatively low-budget film.
As I get older, and today's movies become more sophisticated and special effects dependent, sometimes it's refreshing to look back to the days when you could readily tell the good guys from the bad guys, and it was shocking to see a good guy deliberately kill a bad guy.  This movie is solid popcorn fare.  Watch and enjoy.",1037318400,2,2585,4.62719298245614
704143,5,6303651453,This is one of the best Bond films next to Goldfinger. It is the most like a Bond book. It is also the first movie that Connery is seen in. In fact it's the first Bond movie. This movie is great. I like Connery the most because he's not as formal as most Bond's are. The only problem was that the villian should have been in it more. It also drags at parts. This is a Bond film worth having.,1036886400,,391,3.9
704144,5,6303651453,"I always associate the phrase ""James Bond movies"" with tuxedos, hi-tech gadgets, and (unless ""Thunderball"" or ""The Living Daylights"" is on TV) a really keen movie-watching experience.  That certainly goes for the DVDs, too... once you plug the ""Dr. No"" special edition into your player, you know it'll be a good four or five hours before you're standing up again.
Seven of the Bond movies have been reissued in a new ""special edition"" package.  ""Dr. No"", the granddaddy of them all, is first in the set, both alphabetically and chronologically.  As far as I can tell, the content of the disc is the same as the ""Dr. No"" in the last box set, but for those of us who didn't own the disc before (and why didn't I?) this was a great excuse to purchase and watch.
""Dr. No"" is one of the more compelling entries in the series.  It's light on gadgets and locations, but this only allows Sean Connery to dominate the movie from beginning to end, and show why he's still considered THE Bond, so many decades (and actors) later.  His wit is dry and acid-sharp, and even on this umpteenth viewing I picked up on barbs I'd never noticed before (""So, does toppling American missiles compensate for having no hands?"").  I also enjoy the way the second half of ""No"" takes place basically in real time, following Bond, Honey and Quarrel along the beaches of Crab Key, and deep into Dr. No's cavernous, stainless steel lair.  Dr. No is uncharacteristically muted for a Bond villain -- he doesn't show up until the last 25 minutes -- but he's as chilling as Alaskan wine and his death scene is memorably ironic.
The animated, interactive DVD menus are fun to watch, being highly reminiscent of the famed Maurice Binder opening titles.  There's a cute 20-minute short on director Terence Young, whose ""Bond Vivant"" lifestyle is said to have directly influenced Connery's portrayal of 007.  The 42-minute ""making of"" documentary interviews at least a dozen cast and crew members, and the Patrick MacNee narration is a definite plus.  There's another dozen promotional spots, and a freaky black-and-white featurette from 1962, which features an American actor in Coke-bottle glasses introducing grainy B&W clips from the film.
The DVD's audio commentary track is a cut-and-paste job, linking reminscences from the same actors seen in the making-of, along with some 30 year-old recordings of Terence Young.  Lois ""Moneypenny"" Maxwell and Monty Norman (who sings quite a bit of his score, along with the movie) are the most memorable voices here.  The rest are a bit dry, and basically just repeat what's in the documentary.  If you can't rest until you know what order the scenes were filmed in, this is all for you.
Special kudos to the Photo Gallery.  These are usually a chore to get through, but the ""Dr. No"" gallery is neatly subdivided into nine or so different categories, so you can skip the endless B&W shots of anonymous crew members frowning on location.  The stills from the ""missing scene"" (Ursula Andress menaced by drugged, slow-moving crustaceans) are amusing, as are the various foreign movie posters.  El Satanico Doctor No, indeed!",1035590400,6,3128,4.862523540489642
704145,5,6303651453,"I always considered DR. NO to be one of the better Bond films and closer to the literary James Bond created by Ian Fleming. Sean Connery's performance is that of the no-nonsense dedicated civil servant. His screen presence alone conveys the physical, intellectual and moral conviction of the character. He is essentially a modern day version of the white knight slaying the dragon for Queen and country. Joseph Wiseman as Dr. No is one of the best villains of the series. His steel mono-toned performance is eerily unsettling. He remains one of the most enigmatic villains in the series. He is a villain moved more by unfounded revenge than by greed or riches.  You almost sympathize with him as he makes futile overtures to Bond imploring him to join his organization. It seems that Bond is the only man capable of appreciating his intellect. Not even Dr. No's backers, Blofeld and S.P.E.C.T.R.E. are worthy of his talents. Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder leaves one of the most indelible images of the series as she emerges from the sea clad in her white bikini. She is characterized by the simplicity of her goodness and naivete as she is drawn into a vortex of worldliness that Bond further engulfs her in. Rather than that of a supposed sex object, she exudes a raw femininity found only in nature. Bond can not help but feel that he has corrupted her both deliberately and inadvertently in his blind quest to revenge the deaths of fellow agents. This is the very strength of Richard Maibaum's script, here and on subsequent Bond films. These films, the better ones, are about Bond, his adversaries, his loves and his friendships. Jack Lord was the first of many actors to play Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA friend. ""Friend"" in the world of James Bond is not a word used casually.  Lord seemed the one actor to visually convey the camaraderie that existed between these two characters. John Kitzmiller gave a very good performance as the loyal Quarrel, one of the most important characters in he entire series. This character epitomized the dormant qualities found in the instincts of the common man. When called upon in the death struggle of good vs. evil he is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Anthony Dawson as Professor Dent seems perfect as a man who knew better than fall into an inescapable web of subterfuge that Dr. No has spread from his island to the mainland.  Zena Marshall as Miss Taro is a more willing participant, as she appears eager to overtly display her sensuality and share her sexual appetites openly with Bond. She is supposed to lure Bond to his death. Finding this not the case she enthusiastically offers herself to Bond. It is in these scenes that Sean Connery displays a certain animal screen presence that no other actor has ever equaled in the role. Many elements that distinguish a James Bond movie were introduced in this film. The opening gun barrel trademark, ""The James Bond Theme,"" Bernard Lee's portrayal of the inimitable M, Lois Maxwell's portrayal of the desirable Miss Moneypenny, Ken Adam's innovative and distinctive production designs, Maurice Binder's unique main titles, the ""Martinis shaken not stirred,"" just to name a few are all here. Director, Terence Young, always boasted and took relish in how he supposedly shaped the look and feel of the James Bond series. This is quite possibly true when looking at DR. NO. It is a film visually rich with well-detailed and defined characters. It also has an uncanny feel for the settings inspired from the Ian Fleming novels whether it be Bond's intelligence headquarters in London, the exotic sights and sounds of Jamaica or the incongruity of Dr. No's plush lair hidden in the mosquito invested swamps of Crabe Key. DR. NO is also characterized by quick paced editing by Peter Hunt. Hunt's innovative technique keeps the story moving visually and unobtrusively which also further defines the cinematic world of James Bond. But coming full circle, it is Sean Connery's performance and screen presence that intrigues and captures the imagination of the viewer. Given the sets, the music, the script, the locations and all the other elements, it all comes down to how Sean Connery fits and moves through this cinematic world that has been created for James Bond. DR. NO is the benchmark.",1035331200,,4285,4.87517146776406
704146,5,6303651453,"Dr. No was the first Bond film, and is a masterpiece in every way. The scenes of Bond introducing himself at the Baccarrat table and Ursula Andress emerging from the sea are forever branded in the conciousness of film buffs worldwide.
Both Dr. No and its follow up, From Russia With Love, are perhaps the films that best embody Ian Fleming's vision of the character. The action and suspense work in this film because we believe Bond is human. Subsequent films turn Bond into a unstoppable agent that can miraculously save the world with outrageous stunts and gadgets.
Sean Connery at his best, and a great action film that will stand the test of time.",1034121600,,651,4.6695652173913045
704147,5,6303651453,"Dr. No hasn't aged as well as some of the Bond films, but the strongest elements of the film still outshine those of lesser Bond classics. Dr. No is the meat and potatoes of the Bond series; the gadgets are kept to a minimum and Bond's cold warrior is direct, brutal and without remorse when dispatching the bad guys. What makes Bond so fascintating in this early effort is the cold detachment exhibited by Connery over the fate of those on the wrong side.

As the series continued Bond became more complex but never overcomplicated. The best Bond film in the series is still On Her Majesty's Secret Service. There's a tragic, human quality that is finally revealed about Bond. A warning, if you haven't seen Secret Service I'd suggest skipping the rest of this paragraph. Although there is little reference to the murder of his wife in later films, there's a thematic undercurrent that follows and effects the character into future films.

Joseph Weiss does a fine job as the title character (although I would have much preferred to see Christopher Lee in the role. Ian Fleming had Lee in mind when he was writing the novel and did suggest him to producers for the film. Sadly, Lee never got a chance to audition for the film)although he paints the character in broad (some would call it racist)strokes.

Ursula...well she set the standard for all Bond girls to follow. The streamlined story, lack of gadgets and characters make this Bond a tough one to top. Only a couple of the Bond films really compare to the original debut film.",1030233600,,1534,4.674074074074074
704233,4,6303651453,"Bond. James Bond. Member of Her Majesty's Secret Service. Code number with the double-oh prefix - 007. The double-oh prefix thus gives him a license to kill. He has worked with Her Majesty's Secret Service since 1952, and for the first ten years of his service his preferred sidearm was the Beretta, a weapon to which his superior, Sir Miles Merservy, and the service's Armorer, Major Geoffrey Boothroyd (here played by Peter Burton as a straightforward bureaucratic type), take serious disapproval; Sir Miles Meservy cites as proof a mission by 007 some years earlier where his Beretta jammed and despite the mission's successsful implementation Bond spent six months in hospital in consequence. With a threat of demotion to standard intelligence duties, James reluctantly acquiesces to the issuance of a Walther PPK automatic sidearm.
James Bond is also a fancier of beautiful women and an inveterate gambler who rarely if ever loses. His gambling will keep him awake through the wee hours of the night, and he makes sure that when he does sleep, it is never on the firm's time. He also takes a liking to Sir Miles Meservy's handsomely attractive secretary, Miss Moneypenny, whose own attraction to James is flirtier.
Such is the introduction to the most famous espionage agent in the annuls of page or screen. Dr. No was not the first James Bond story to be laid down on either film or videotape - a mid-1950s television special of Casino Royale offered the very first screen introduction of the character - but Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Salzman's 1962-released treatment was the most spectacular and began a motion picture series that remains a force in the opening years of the 21st century.
James' assignment is to Jamaica, where a British intelligence officer, John Strangways, and his secretary are mysteriously killed and dossiers on a scientist, Doctor Julius No, are missing.  Strangways was checking reports of mysterious radiation from the island area that has been plaguing US space launches.  As for Julius No, he is a Chinese-German who owns a bauxite mine off the shores of the island of Crab Key, and his paranoia for security ensures that no one goes near the island - on threat of death.
James first encounters a fisherman, Quarell, with whom Strangways often sailed.  The encounter soon leads to a brief scuffle and a meeting with Felix Leiter (a pre-Hawaii Five-0 Jack Lord), a CIA operative who also worked with Strangways and who will figure prominently with James in the future.
Strangways' investigations sometimes took a back seat to meetings with friends at a nearby club, and James' own investigation encounters him with one of Strangways' club pals, geologiost Professer Dent.  When a claim by Dent proves false, James realizes that Strangways latched onto something at Crab Key that involves radiation - and is thus serious.
Despite two attempts on his life - the first, the planting of a tarantula, remains one of the most chilling scenes of the entire series - James and Quarell push onward and land at Crab Key, where they run into Honey Ryder, a collector of seashells.  They are soon pursued by armed men to the interior of Crab Key, and a firefight leads to Quarell's death and the capture of James and Honey, where they find a fantastic sight - a massive decontamination chamber, and a palatial estate built into the coral and rock below the ocean, the handiwork of Doctor No and his Chinese and Jamaican henchmen.
Doctor No is as confident as he is ruthless, to the point where he holds a dinner date for James, to try and recruit him to the organization to which No owes his loyalty, The Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Extortion, and Revenge.  But James cannot be bought, and it will take all he has to stop Doctor No's next radio beam aimed at the launch of another US spacecraft.
Dr. No introduces Monty Norman's classic guitar-horn-cymbal-drum driven theme cue, and also nicely grounds the varied characters so the audience can truly identify with them as the film proceeds.

704235,5,6303651453,"I owned this title on VHS and on laser disk, and neither compared to the quality of this DVD version. The sound is typically great, but the picture sharpness and color depth surpassed my expectations. The special feature documentaries/biographies aren't the usual movie trailer drivel - they are well worth watching. That's the case for buying the DVD.
  What's the attraction with Dr. No? Watch this movie and you'll know why Casino Royalle is seldom referred to as the first Bond movie, even though it pre-dates this feature. Things to watch for? No gadgets, in fact very little high tech anything. This was the platform from which the movie 007 was launched - this is where the Bond persona was formed. He's suave, he's sophisticated, he's Bond. But there is one difference in the Bond character of Dr. No as compared to the subsequent Bond films. James is more arrogant is his manner. Watch the way he interacts with his subordinants and co-workers. Don't believe me? Just watch for the beach scene where James orders Quarrel to fetch his shoes. Of course he still can't extend such an attitude towards ""M,"" even when being forced to trade in his beloved Beretta for his soon to be trademarked Walther PPK.
  Bottom line? If you don't have this title, you don't have a Bond film ""collection."" And if you're going to do it, spend the extra dollars for the DVD. Then start looking for what is arguably the best 007 film of them all - From Russia With Love.",1017014400,,1458,4.66147859922179

All the elements of a great Bond film are present, including great locales, action, a beautiful Bond girl in Honey Ryder, and an evil villain, Dr. No.  The only aspects that could have used a little work were the gadgets and the music (I started getting sick of the ""Underneath the mango tree"" song), but it was to be expected that the first movie in the series would be lacking in those categories.  Joseph Wiseman was an excellent villain, although the context of the movie did not allow us to see him enough.  Ursula Andress paved the way for future Bond girls with her terrific performance as Honey Ryder.  And Jack Lord may have been the best Felix Leiter of the entire series.  One of the best parts of the movie was when Bond put the pillows inside the bed to make it seem as if he were in it.  Shortly thereafter Proffesor Dent came and shot the pillows, startled to realize that Bond was not actually in the bed, but sitting in a corner of the room.

Wow, what a professional! A guy shows up from nowhere claiming to be from CIA and hop, We're on the same side, big smile, let's shake hands my patriotic fiend...

it still stands up as one of the finest in the series.
Without a doubt 007's 1962 debut is a classic. The films plot is far different than most of the other Bond outings it more of a mystery than an all out action save the world Bond film (although the plot ends with Bond saving the world and there is plenty of action) Dr. No proves to be one of the best story lines in the series.
The acting is superperb in this film! The whole cast deserves a pat on the back. Connery's performance as Bond is amazing it's a if the character is second nature to him. Ursula Andress plays the beautiful Honey Ryder and starts off as the beginning of a long line of Bond girls (ironic that she remains one of the best). Joseph Wiseman is awesome as Dr. No. He plays the character very dryly but you can see the menace lurking beneath. Hawaii Five-O's Jack Lord portrays the first of a long line of Bond's comrade Felix Leiter and proves that he is the best of them all. John Kitzmiller plays the comical Quarrel, Lois Maxwell begins her career as Moneypenny, Bernard Lee plays the gruff M, and Anthony Dawson plays the weasely Professor Dent. As for the rest of the cast well they are all superb as well!
The plot finds James going to Kingston Jamaica to find out who murdered British secret agent Strangways. However his findings lead him to the notorious Crab Key where he uncovers Dr. No's lair and his plans to destroy the American space rockets. The plot is not only exciting but downright brilliant. The only thing this film lacks is all the exciting Bond gadgets and Q but he would show up later in From Russia With Love.
Overall Dr. No is one of the best Bond films ever! It's one of my favourite. The acting is brilliant, the plot is exciting and Dr. No is one of the best Bond villians to ever hit the big screen. Highly recommended!",1012521600,,1998,4.3449197860962565

The infallible Sean Connery proves beyond a doubt that he IS James Bond. While Connery would perfect the character over the next five years, never would his portrayal of our favorite spy be so raw and ruthless. Likewise, the series itself would be refined throughout the years, but with few exceptions (From Russia with Love and For Your Eyes Only) would never be so stripped down and honest. Not all the classic Bond elements were yet in place -- there is no pre-credits sequence, no Q Branch and the soundtrack is possibly the weakest of the series -- but, Dr. No succeeds on pure guts alone. Veteran actor Joseph Wiseman's chilling portrayal of the title character was the blueprint for all Bond villians. Ursula Andress goes straight to the Bond Hall of Fame for her unforgettable turn as Honey Rider, the first Bond Girl. The hard-hitting action takes place in Jamaica, the first of many exotic locales which became a series trademark.

Sean Connery has the leading role, as James Bond - 007.  Sent to Jamaica to invistigate a mysterious murder, he discovers an underground network of evildoers, heading by a group calling themselves SPECTRE.  This terror group specializes in extortion, blackmail, and revenge.
Dr. No, played by Joseph Wiseman, is a member of this criminal organization, and, as Bond uncovers, has a powerful weapon that can destroy American spacecraft; and unless the American government can come up with a sum of money to satisfy SPECTRE, Dr. No will.
With the help from the CIA, and Felix Ligher - played by Jack Lord - they hope to capture Dr. No before he can unleash this weapon upon America and world.
While in Jamaica, Bond meets a beautiful young woman fishing for shells, played by Ursula Anderson.  (The use of models becomes a running theme in all future bond flicks, as well as the sexist attitude and inuendo.)  She tells bond of a strange island where a dragon lives.  Bond, knowing dragons do not exist, speculates that this is where he can find Dr. No.

And though I must admit that all the other James Bond movies were wonderful, ""Dr. No"" is still one of the top of my favorite Bond movie list. ""Dr. No"" begins in Jamaica, where an agent and his secretary are mysteriously killed. James Bond (Sean Connery) is sent to investigate.

There are many reasons why you would like this movie. First, you would immediately fall in love with the character of James Bond with the wonderful acting skills of Sean Connery. Also, besides the Felix Leiter in ""For Your Eyes Only"", Jack Lord's portrayal of him is I think the best of all. There is a reason why I gave only 4 stars for this movie. It's because maybe back in 1963, the action and suspense would have been really thrilling for people then, but now... after watching movies like ""Matrix"", ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", and the newer Bond movies with Pierce Brosnan, the action isn't that appealing.

Watching this movie is like being transported to another time, when Bond movies didn't need gadgets and girls to be exciting (although the Bond Girl in this movie is another relic:  she isn't an anorexic). Instead of focusing on having a big action scene every five minutes, this movie is more about establishing the characters, their reasons and motivations for what they do, and for Connery's finest performance:  he nailed down the Bond manner on his first try.

704432,5,6303651453,"Sean Connery, bless him, has a career spanning nearly 50 years. From ""South Pacific"" chorus boy to B-movie heavies to James Bond to bearded father figure, he has made quite a few movies: some good, some great, a lot of not-so-great, but the great Scot still has box-office draw. ""Dr. No"", the first big-screen James Bond film, made an instant star of Mr. Connery. It's easy to see why! The film, while a little slow-starting, is mercifully nearly ""gadget-free"", is shot in picturesque Jamaica, and introduced that gorgeous blonde Amazon Ursula Andress to the world, clad in the now-legendary white bikini, a sort of Aryan Girl from Ipanema. And then, of course, there is Mr. Connery. Six-foot two inches tall, with his ""dark, cruel good looks"", (as one film producer described him), hairy chest, and very wise deadpan delivery of his lines, is a breathtaking natural wonder. This comic book for adults, as opposed to the later Bond films with Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan, et al, which, in my opinion, are comic books for adolescent boys, is highly entertaining. It is also ""of its time"", which is why I felt the series should have ended with ""Thunderball"". This was a time of big cars with tailfins, ice-cold cocktails served on low-slung cocktail tables, sharkskin suits, and girls with ""hairdos"". In my opinion, when Roger Moore inherited the role, the series lost its edge. Mr. Moore, a very handsome, capable actor, was too ""gentlemanly to a fault"" in the role, and the silly smirkiness of the scripts and too-obvious monikers like ""Holly Goodhead""  and ""Jaws"" smacked more of Malibu than Ian Fleming. The overabundance of car chases, explosions, and gadgets detracted, rather than added to, the decline of the series. And besides, how many times can you draw from the well? It's long run dry! But now for the ""Dr No"" DVD-gorgeous picture and sound quality, beautifully done menu graphics, dozens of candid stills, and the documentary are all part of this Valentine to the first Bond outing.

Will you see Titanic with the same interest in 2040? Maybe for its special effects. But you don't watch Dr. No today, after almost 40 years of its release, for its special effects.

704434,5,6303651453,"More of a mystery than an espionage thriller, ""Dr. No"" was the first movie featuring Special Agent James Bond, 007. The $5 question still remains, however, was the movie a good start to the series? I would say yes and no. The movie in itself is a fairly decent action/adventure thriller (for 1962 at least), but when compared with such an amazing film as ""Goldfinger"" (which would follow ""Dr. No"" after ""From Russia with Love"" as the third 007 installment) this movie pales severely. The James Bond saga truly started with the ""Goldfinger"" revolution, not with ""Dr. No"". This movie is definitely not my favorite of the entire series. Just because it was the first one doesn't give it any priority in my mind. To be honest, it was rather a disappointment after having watched ""Goldfinger"" before this one. Still, my judgements are probably a little too harsh since the series was just starting out, and the movie was produced with very little money. That is the reason I'm giving the film four stars instead of three or two.
All in all, ""Dr. No"" is a movie long-time Bond fans will love, but not a movie newbies should check out.

In this fantastic story, the villain, Dr. No, plans to destroy U.S. rockets and it's up to Bond in his own unique style to thwart Dr. No's plans.  Assisted by U.S. agent Felix Leiter, (Lord) and various ladies along the way, this ends up being one of the most enjoyable of all Bond films staying quite true to the book.

704436,4,6303651453,"For me it's hard to imagine what being a moviegoer back in 1962 must've been like. Back then, special effects weren't nearly as special. Similiar to listening to the radio, I can imagine the audience viewing Dr. No to pretend that Sean Connery was being chased by a hearse when it was obvious that he was sitting in front of a projected image. They imagined the pain that a henchman must've felt when Bond punched him in the face, even if the punch was clearly cheorographed and missed entirely onscreen. These low points would probbaly break a new movie in our generation, yet the previous generation did not depend on special effects or such to carry them through the movie; they wanted a solid plot, and on that note Dr. No successfully delivers in almost every way.
In the first entry of the legendary James Bond saga, Bond is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a British Agent in Jamaica. Bond soon finds himself a target, and hurries to the island of Dr. No to thwart his scheme to divert a rocket from Cape Canaveral. All of the future prequisites for a Bond film are in place, ranging from beautiful girls (three of them, including Ursula Andress) to devious assassination methods to chase scenes and the like. Noteworthy are the scenes in M's office at the intro of the film, with smart dialogue, the introduction of the PPK, and Bond's flirting with Moneypenny afterwards. Other memorable moments in the film (out of many) include a scene where 3 'blind' men gun down a british agent, Bond shoots a henchman in cold blood, and the dinner conversation w/Dr. No.
Sean Connery is smart, suave, and impressive in his first Bond film. It's not hard to see why audiences admired him, cheered him on, and why Bondmania became a national sensation. Deliveries of classic lines like ""I think they were heading for a funneral"" and ""You've had your six"" never sounded better. Though he grew more confident in From Russia With Love, Connery is still excellent in this film.
My only problem with this film, and it's actually a very big problem, is that the film never prepares us for it's unbelievable finale. Throughout the film, Bond is attacked in low-key, plausible ways. He is shot at, chased by a hearse, set upon by a spider, hunted by dogs, betrayed by a beautiful girl, etc. None of it involves special gadgets or gimmickry (no cars with jet-propelled missiles, mutated animals, etc) and when Bond set off to visit Crab Key, I had in my mind that Dr. No was a simple, if insane villain. However, all of this plausibility is thrown away by introductions of radition suits, guys without hands and fantastic set designs. The film provided very let setup or hints that something this fantastic was coming, and I ended up disliking it a great deal. Indeed, I would have much rather perferred that the entire adventure remained low-key. Even at that, it would still have impressed audiences in 1962.
Overall, this is still a good Bond film worth recommending. It's a historic movie with many good moments dispite its inplausibility, and audiences should be left with a good idea of why Sean Connery is considered the best Bond. If you're a Bond fan or love the extras, the DVD is worth the extra money. But I can not recommend this as a worthwhile DVD purchase based solely on the movie itself, because the sound and picture quality will remain about the same as a VHS master. After all, the film is pushing 40.",974851200,,3421,4.674958540630183
704437,5,6303651453,"Dr. No, simply put, is THE BEST JAMES BOND FILM.  It is the most original of all the Bond films, and one of the best looking - DESPITE its meager $1,000,000 budget.  Sean Connery is excellent in his Bond debut, and Jack Lord is outstanding as Felix Leiter (and Lord set a standard that only David Hedison came close to matching).  All of the elements fall into place; acting, script, direction, music, scenery - EVERYTHING works!  At just under two hours the movie never drags (like some later Bond films do), it just flows from one scene to the next.  Joseph Wiseman is also well cast as the title villain; he doesn't just play it like the cliched ""evil bad guy.""  In fact, his Dr. No is amoral - he sees himself as above morality, giving his performance a Machiavellian quality.  There are several other GREAT Bond films (""From Russia With Love,"" ""For Your Eyes Only,"" ""The Living Daylights,"" ""Licence To Kill,"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" among them), but Dr. No is just a little more special.  It was the first.  It set the style.  It broke new ground in action/adventure films.  If you've seen it you know what I mean.  If you haven't - BUY IT NOW!  Find out for yourself just how great this film is.  If you have seen it, but don't own the DVD - BUY IT NOW!!

It was, after  all, the first of the James Bond movies, and there was some precedence to  set for the long line of 007 films to come. Director Terence Young took  seriously the task of getting Bond started on the right footing. He, with  the help of author Ian Fleming, molded him into the suave cad with a biting  wit and firmly established his ""license to kill"" image so well  that many people still swear that Sean Connery will always be the ultimate  Bond. The DVD version of this 1962 hit is excellent in that it includes  enough extras to help a newcomer to the series learn all he/she needs to  know to get started. A 42-minute documentary and a shorter tribute to the  late Mr. Young are both very entertaining. And the film transfer is  immaculate, although the mono sound does waver in volume. This tale of an  Oriental madman playing havoc with American missiles and Bond's smooth way  of getting to the bottom of the problem is worth a couple of hours viewing.

This Bond is a lot more vulnerable with almost no  gadgets having to survive by his skills and wit. Connery was the best Bond,  and in this film he is just getting used to the role. He feels less assured  and hasn't gotten comfortable with the role yet. But this is what makes  this Bond more memorable, more human and more vulnerable. The whole film  feels like 'Bond in the tropics' filmed almost entirely in Jamaica, the  exotic locales are eye-candy. Filled with witty dialogue and started the  now-famous Bond cliches like; 'Bond... James Bond' and 'martini vodka,  shaken not stirred'. The first third of the film feels a bit unfocused and  only has an exciting tarantula attack. But once Bond visits an enemy  secretary and gets a 'deadly escort' on his way, that is when the film  really takes off. Then we meet Ursula Andress as Honey Rider (!), arguably  the most famous of all the Bond girls. And Bond does battle with the  sinister Dr. No and saves the world just in the nick of time.

Some weak(mostly  irritating) moments are the errors. When Bond visits Miss Taro, we are  given 2 different address. All the voices are from the same actress in this  movie, except for Moneypenny. And during the island part, it got so  dragging that I was tapping my foot, wishing it would move on.

The character is presented as a ruthless, yet sophisticated  individual with a taste for life's greatest pleasures, ranging from finely  tailored suits, to the most beautiful women.  Oh yeah, and he also happens  to be a British spy with a license to kill.  ""Dr. No""  is an  old-fashioned espionage thriller that introduced us to a character that we  can't seem to let go of after nearly four decades.  As an entry in the  series it spawned, it scores highly on so many counts.  It has the most  beautiful woman ever to appear in a Bond film (Ursulla Andress), as well as  one of the most memorable villains (the title character, chillingly played  by Joseph Wiseman).  It also has the distinction of introducing practically  everything: Monty Norman's infamous James Bond Theme, the gunbarrell  opening logo, 007's Walther PPK, the characters of ""M,""  Moneypenny, and Felix Leiter, and the vodka maritini (shaken, not stirrred,  of course).  But most importantly, it introduces us to Sean Connery, who is  still the quintessential Bond, and gave the character the bluerpint for all  to follow.  His introduction scene in the casino where he utters the  immortal line,""Bond, James Bond,"" is not only the most memorable  scene in the series, but perhaps in cinema history.

A triumph of producer Albert Broccoli's perseverence, and the  inspired casting of virtual unknown Sean Connery as 007 (an  exclusive-to-DVD documentary details how co-producer Harry Saltzman wanted  Roger Moore for the role, and Broccoli considered Cary Grant!), the first  Bond outing is a lean, mean affair, more faithful to Ian Fleming's original  concept of Bond, with far less 'padding' and slapstick than later films in  the series (particularly the Roger Moore outings) would display.
The  casting of many of the roles is memorable; Ursula Andress is the incredibly  sexy Honey Ryder; Joseph Wiseman, best known as a brilliant character actor  in gangster films, makes a ruthless Dr. No; Jack Lord ('Hawaii 5-0') is  coldly efficient CIA agent Felix Leiter. And of course, Bernard Lee and  Lois Maxwell makes their debuts as 'M' and 'Miss Moneypenny'. (Desmond  Llewelyn would first appear as 'Q' in the next Bond film, 'From Russia With  Love').
Among the other 'extras' in the DVD edition is a tribute to  director Terence Young, whose vision of 007 is STILL in effect, nearly 40  years later; and a voice-over audio track, with commentary by many of the  original production staff responsible for the creation of this seminal Bond  outing!
While there were rough edges to smooth out (John Barry's lush  music is sorely missed; only composer Monty Norman's famous 'James Bond  Theme' would remain, by 'From Russia With Love'), many spectacular elements  were already in place, such as Ken Adam's incredible set designs, and  Maurice Binder's provocative nude silhouette opening credits! 'Dr. No' was  FAR ahead of its time, and influenced the entire action and spy film  genres!

704544,4,6303651453,"In 1962, with a very modest budget and a relative unknown as their leading man, the production partnership of Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman finally brought Ian Fleming's James Bond on the big screen in DR. NO, based  on the book by the same name. The film become a big hit with moviegoers in  the UK and the US, made the unknown actor Sean Connery a star, and began  one of the most successful and long-lived film series in history.
Unlike  many of the Bond films that followed, the small budget of DR. NO meant that  lavish sets and special effects had to be kept to a bare minimum. This was  compensated for by a well-crafted screenplay and the great performance of  Connery and the rest of the emsemble of actors, several of who would  reprise their roles for years to come such as Lois Maxwell as Miss  Moneypenny and Bernard Lee as ""M"". Many of the plot elements of  later Bond films were invented during production of DR. NO including the  opening gunfire sequence, theme music, M's office, SPECTRE, missions to  foreign locales, and of course the lovely Bond girls.
For today's  moviegoers, the film may look somewhat outdated and bit simplistic. Bond  has no special gadgets to save him, in fact the only item given to him by Q  (who is not played by Desmond Llewelyn in this outing)is his trademark  Walther PPK. In short, he must survive by using his wits.
His mission is  also simple: find out who killed an agent stationed in Jamaica who has been  investigating a mysterious radio beam interfering with US rocket launches.  It is a story with intrigue as Bond sidesteps a number of potentially  deadly obstacles to face the evil Doctor No (who is well played by Joseph  Wiseman). Many Bond fans who have not seen this film before might it find a  refreshing change to later Bond films (or else they may be totally bored  with the lack of mass destruction).

7852333,3,6303651453,"Having recently watched all these movies chronologically, I find there's a proper way to assess the 007 franchise: namely, by its villain (and, by extension, it's plot), by its Bond girls, by its action and sets, by the context laid out by the previous films, and by how well it has aged into the modern day.
Villain - The eponymous Dr. No is the best part of the whole damn movie and, to this day, he is one of the more unique Bond villains. His plot isn't incredibly elaborate, but it's the first movie in the series and certainly doesn't need to be. Up until his first appearance, the film has a standard ""classic"" spy plot; once Bond starts to hone in on the location of Dr. No's secret lair (a really badass lair, at that), the truly iconic moments begin.
Bond Girls - Miss Taro, the femme fatale, and Honey Ryder, the main girl, are admittedly sub-standard. The former is lazily underestimating and easily manipulated (and the subject of the film's most palpable misogyny); the latter, despite being one of the most beloved Bond girls, is overrated. I'm sorry. She's got a knife and a backstory, and that's it.
Action and Sets - Being the first in the series, it has the lowest budget. However, it is very competently filmed on location and the few sets that they do utilize are immersive. There is a staple car chase, but it looks painfully bad, even more so considering they didn't really use professional stunt drivers (if they did, it's hard to tell). Not many close-quarters brawls and practically no gun fights, but...eh, read on.
Context - This is as good as the first film should be. James Bond is a distinctly different person: he does detective work, he's practical in maintaining his cover and, unlike in many of the other movies, he doesn't get a whole lot of help in the end. I went into it with generally low expectations...At the end, I decided to watch through the rest of the series--24 films to date.
Ageing - Out of all the others, it feels the most like a spy movie. That alone secures it as a worthy watch. The misogyny is exactly what you'd expect (seduces a woman for information, then has her arrested immediately after). It isn't heavily racist in depicting its non-white characters, though Bond very occasionally seems to treat his Caribbean companion as an indentured servant. But anyway, the later ones can be way more offensive.",1521763200,,2363,4.64200477326969

7852337,2,6303651453,"Surprisingly poor movie, with terrible writing and directing only redeemed by the eternally charming Sean Connery.  This film is absolutely worth a watch, but only as a reference to see where Bond films started and how far they have come.  Apart from Connery all the acting is completely wooden, characters that are completely one dimensional and never slightly believable.  The nonsensical villains are of course now a staple of Bond films, but in the movies since this the writers have learned to make them interesting.

I know Connery fans and classic Bond fans find a lot to love here, so I want to lay out my criticisms as clearly as possible.  First I want to address the terrible directing, as I think it is the most apparent flaw this film has.  From camera work, to pacing, to what they decide to show and what they decide to skip, Terence Young makes nearly every directing mistake he can.  Scenes that are meant to be dramatic are filmed entirely from one angle in one take, when there are cuts there are consistency errors,  unimportant parts of the film are dragged out, and entire scenes could have been cut from the movie that would have left it better off.  At best the film is awkward, making mistakes that many directors in that era made.  At worst it seems as if editing was a foreign concept to the director, leaving a bunch of scenes that manage to be a jumbled mess despite being in the correct order.  A single watch of the film will have most viewers noticing consistency errors (on camera cut the positions of the actors change), directing mistakes (like Bond not noticing his hands touching the ""burning hot"" vents), poor pacing (lingering on unimportant scenes for far too long), and scenes that just add nothing to the movie.

The next problem is the writing.  From plot points that are now common knowledge as factually incorrect (possibly thanks to everyone becoming more familiar with nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster), to characters that are poorly written, the writing constantly gets in the way of the movie.  There is a bilingual sailor that changes from intelligent to imbecile depending on the scene, a Bond girl that is apparently boring, naive, weak, and foolish despite surviving on her own for years, and several characters that are introduced and immediately forgotten.  The only character outside of Bond who is tolerable is Moneypenny, and their exchanges are still enjoyable as ever.

The next issue is of course the acting.  Most of the actors in this film are not given much to work with, but only Connery does a particularly good job.  The writing may be one dimensional, but those kind of characters later became standard in Bond movies with much better results.  The actors leave their characters feeling lifeless and wooden.  It is difficult to care about the characters when it seems like the actors do not care about them.

A film that has issues in all these areas is not going to be a good film, even with Sean Connery headlining it.  The lovely music, Sean Connery's charm, the scenery, and the action are not enough to make up for the shortcomings of this film.  I was disappointed by it, but I still appreciated seeing where the Bond films began.  It is still useful in that regard, and will help you to notice several references in later films.  Just do not go into this movie hoping for it to be comparable to Goldeneye.",1512604800,,3390,4.724489795918367

7852339,3,6303651453,"nice seeing an early Bond film that didn't rely on ""Blaufeld"" as the villain.  Had there ever been any need for secretive operations, the original nondescript Sean Connery would have been more suitable than his physically larger successors.",1510099200,,240,5.315789473684211
7852340,5,6303651453,"This 1962 movie based on Ian Fleming's book contains the first or our favorite charters, including Sean Connery as James Bond, Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder, and Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny. A surprise and shocker is seeing Jack Lord playing the U.S. CIA agent Felix Leiter.

The earlier Bond movies required more acting than fancy gadgets. However you will still recognize his puns.

Dr. No is suspected of being up to no good. A previous agent on the trail of this mysterious Dr. No (Joseph Wiseman) seems to have disappeared. And there are no more transmissions from the local outpost in Jamaica. So it is up to James Bond to find out what happened and finish the project. Naturally he finds trouble form the beginning; however this is nothing compared to what he will find on Crab Key.",1508198400,4,793,4.697841726618705
