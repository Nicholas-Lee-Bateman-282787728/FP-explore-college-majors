8714364,2,B00WUKHWZY,"If you call these anemic little white chickenscratches subtitles, then we have a serious difference of opinion.

I'm not exactly blind, and I do like to read subtitles comfortably from the same distance I watch everything else on TV.  It is a seriously good show you are ruining with your incompetence.

Now, about sound synchronization.  The first act has good synchronization.  I am now into Act II, which started out with sound approximately 30 milliseconds ahead of video.  Now farther in, we have a fife and drum corps which passes directly in front of camera, so is easy to synchronize at 60 milliseconds ahead of video.  This is really unacceptable and it's going to take quite some time to map out the whole opera and publish numbers so those with sound delay boxes can hang onto their remotes and adjust it 'on the fly', every time they watch.

And there goes my little theory that it's only on certain DVDs, never on Blu-Rays.  That theory is shot.

I do notice this problem on many videos from Mariinsky/Kirov Theater:  Eugene Onegin, La Forza del Destino, and now this.  Do they have crappy equipment there, or inept engineers, or what?  And anyway, why can't FarHaus identify and fix the problem?

So I can't recommend this under any circumstances.  But I will continue the mapping, and update periodically, only because I am a fool.",1487289600,2,1346,4.766233766233766
