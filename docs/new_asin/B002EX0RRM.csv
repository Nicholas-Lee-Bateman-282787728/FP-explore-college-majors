8368415,2,B002EX0RRM,"No! No! No! This movie is totally mis-cast, uses odd production choices, includes no Jackson music, and tries to cover too much of Michael Jacksons life in 86 minutes. Flex Alexander attempts to portray Jackson, even though he looks nothing like him. For the most part, he has the voice down, and many mannerisms, but there is no way you would mistake him for the real Jackson. Speaking of mis-casts, a character called simply ""Liz"" in the credits is undoubtedly supposed to be Elizabeth Taylor. Aside from her appearing like Jacksons fairy god-mother every time he has a meltdown, this actor looks less like Taylor than Alexander does Jackson. For me, the only convincing actor was the guy that played Joe Jackson!

The movie, released in 2005, starts in the early 1980s and races to 2004, the beginning of Jacksons trial. Many events in Jacksons life are severely abbreviated or totally left out. For example, the Pepsi commercial accident, the Victory tour, and the history of the one glove are all rushed through (By the way, the movie would have you believe Jackson began wearing one glove to hide his vitiligo skin condition). Another example of abbreviated events involves his plastic surgery. Two scenes are shown  using the same footage, btw  of Jackson going through plastic surgery. After each operation the only visible difference is that Alexander has on lighter makeup. Its particularly noticeable after the second portrayal of surgery, and Alexander looks like he has on clown make-up!

Because the pacing of events is so fast and segments are short, subtitles are used throughout to make sure you know where you are in the time-line. The movie also uses actual footage of crowds at Jacksons trial, as well as footage of LaToya Jackson, OJ Simpsons car chase, the planes hitting the World Trade Center, and the real Jackson dangling baby Blanket over a balcony in Berlin. Going back and forth from simulated events to actual events was distracting, especially since the type of film did not match. Another particularly annoying production technique was using hand held cameras through most of the movie. They provided enough movement in the film to give you motion sickness! Speaking of being sick, there is NO Jackson music in this movie. None. Nada. Not even an attempt to hear Alexander sing a cover song, let alone a Jackson song. I guess the music rights were denied or too expensive.

Once the movie hits the 1990s significant events are presented, including the Dangerous tour (93), the 1994 marriage and divorce with Lisa Marie Presley (that could be a whole movie by itself!), the marriage to Debbie Rowe (96), and starting in 1997, the birth of his children. Also, among these scenes are those showing Jackson hanging out with children. A good portion of the movie then becomes about his relationship with children and how it impacts his life and career. This story line carriers over into the 2000s, where we see the Jackson tribute show in Madison Square Garden (which coincidently took place on Sept 10, 2001, the day before 9/11), the 2001 Blanket incident at a Berlin balcony, the Living with Michael documentary (03), and the beginning of Jacksons trial in 2004. Its at this point the movie fades out and includes a subtitle that read  and Im paraphrasing  Michael Jackson denied all allegations. I guess the sequel would have included the trials!

This movie misfired in many ways. Instead of binge watching, this was cringe watching. Die hard fans might enjoy it, but average fans would do better to watch Michael Jackson: Searching for Neverland, or The Jacksons: An American Dream.",1519516800,,3616,4.935855263157895
