7903391,4,B000005NJM,"This short instruction video (~30 minutes) starts simple but the pace increases considerably as it progresses. Learners may need to stop, rewind, and rewatch. The instructor reviews the string names, teaches a scale, then shows some progressions the learner can develop. It is a real crash course which I use to help others incorporate the bass into their musical skill set. I would suggest that viewers should have some skill on string instruments before watching. I found non-string players tend to get left behind as the video progresses.",1249516800,,541,5.159090909090909
