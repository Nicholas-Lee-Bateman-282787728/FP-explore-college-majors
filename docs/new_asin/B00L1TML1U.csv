6459698,5,B00L1TML1U,"This is a gripping and sobering documentary that EVERY American should watch. Actual war footage taken straight from the valleys and mountains of Afghanistan, there is no better way to get an understanding and respect for what these men and women go through in combat. This isn't the run of the mill documentary with narration by some A-list actor, the journalists when into the deepest and darkest places of Afghanistan with these men and women, then told their heroic story.",1408060800,28,476,4.9625
6459699,5,B00L1TML1U,"I had the privilege of meeting Mike Boettcher in the field, and met him immediately after the conclusion of Operation STRONG EAGLE III featured prominently in the film. What he, his son Carlos, and producer-directors David Salzberg, Jr. and Christian Tureaud managed to do was create a no-holds-barred, honest, apolitical, gutteral sense of what it was like out there: the danger, the worry, the camaraderie, and the courage of our fighting forces in the midst of desperate, harrowing firefights deep in the 'heart of darkness.' This movie is a tribute to all who have sacrificed far away from loved ones and the American public eye, and to the journalists who try to tell their stories -- putting themselves in harm's way as well. BRAVO!!",1407974400,37,739,4.967741935483871
6459700,5,B00L1TML1U,"This movie came to our small town theatre after the community came together to pre-sell 500 tickets. I do not care for war movies or documentaries and I have mixed feelings about the war, but some friends wanted to go so I went. WOW - talk about an eye-opener! This movie shows the good and the bad - the love of country, the dedication of our soldiers, the conditions we take for granted, the sadness, the laughter. It is real - no Hollywood spin, no scripts. (And there's no blood so those with weak stomachs don't have to worry about that.) There was not a dry eye in the place! Every person in the theatre stayed to watch the credits...and when the credits were over, every person in the theatre sat in silence to let it all soak in. I will own this on DVD, I will recommend it to every person I meet, I will buy it as a gift. I can only assume it will be shown in history classes. The perspective this movie gives is, well, WOW!",1405814400,270,933,4.188888888888889
6459701,5,B00L1TML1U,"As one of the soldiers from the No Slack battalion which is featured in the movie, I can tell you that if you want to know what we experienced, this is the perfect movie.

6459702,5,B00L1TML1U,"""The Hornet's Nest"" (2014 release; 97 min.) is a documentary about fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. As the documentary opens, we are reminded that it is ""Kunar, Northeastern Afghanistan, March 29, 2011"" where serious fighting with the Taliban is taking place. We then go back to a year earlier and are introduced to Mike Boettcher, a veteran of war reporting. Mike is about to return to be embedded in Afghanistan. But this time his son Carlos is also going, ""to understand why you chose work over us for so long"", wow. Mike and Carlos are embedded with the 101st Airborne, and we see them on various missions, such as ""track Taliban snipers"", ""search and clear compound"", etc. The last 30-35 minutes of the movie lead up to ""the hornet's nest"" that was Mission Strong Eagle III in March, 2011. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this documentary is outstanding on so many levels, I hardly know where to begin. First, this is the best documentary that I have seen that truly gives you an idea about what things were/are like for our troops fighting the Taliban. The embedded journalists literally put their lives on the line as well, so as to bring us this incredible footage. Second, the documentary also gives us a glimpse into the utter absurdity of life in a war zone. While bullets are flying, we see people, including children, in the background, walking or on their bikes, Third, and most importantly, the documentary gives rarely before seen insights on how the men and women in our military are true heroes, in every sense of the word, fighting an ""invisible"" enemy (nickname for the Taliban: ""ghosts"") in a faraway land under impossible circumstances, all so that you and I can go about our daily routine here at home in the US. Regardless of how one feels about the merits of these wars, we owe all of these men and women our thanks and appreciation, and then some. For reasons that I don't want to spoil here, the last 10 min. of the documentary will stay with me for a long, long time. Earlier this year the movie ""Lone Survivor"" was a big box office success, and with good reason. But I must tell you that ""The Hornet's Nest' is better, for no other reason that this is REAL, not just a Hollywood version of what has happened in Afghanistan.

""The Hornet's Nest"" opened this weekend out of the blue, without any pre-release fanfare or buzz, at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati. When I went to see it today, I had a private screening, as in: I literally was the only person in the theatre. What a shame. But no matter, hopefully this documentary will find a wide audience once it's available on DVD/Blu-ray. If you want to get a true picture of what life is like for our military fighting the Taliban, you owe it to yourself to see this, be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray. ""The Hornet's Nest"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1405728000,163,2949,4.59392789373814

6459721,4,B00L1TML1U,"Four stars for the infantry men and what they go through.  The journalist and his son and the ongoing personal monologue really brought the film down.  Some of the bad video taken by the son should have been edited out (shaky, sky shots, leaf shots over and over).

6459726,3,B00L1TML1U,"I was truly torn on how to rate this one. If you leave out the parts attempting to re-twine lost family ties due to a career choice (no disrespect intended, but it is what it is) then this is an absolute eye opener for those who are inexperienced in serious combat matters. The parts of the movie related to it's advertised intent are outstanding and while I'm in the end glad to see a father and son reunited, I'm going with a 3 for detracting from the circumstances under which it happened. Maybe a little more truth in advertising up front would prep the viewer to expect what the movie greatly was about and make it more acceptable in its presentation. Only the footage captured from the viewpoint of those who laid down their lives and part of the message delivered from that, saved the day from a 1. It's worth a watch for the inside view.",1528070400,,845,4.388535031847134

To all who have served, thank you.

6459743,1,B00L1TML1U,"This movie is not about our heroic soldiers fighting. Its all about the journalist and his son and they just so happen to find a war to cover together. I give plenty of credit to all the warriors who had to bring these two jerks with them into the field each mission. Could not stand another minute of the arrogant egotistical reporting. It even included retakes of some of the camera work. If you want a real movie with real soldiers and unstaged documentary during live fighting, this movie is not for you. Better off watching Citizen Soldiers for the real story of  bravery and casualties.",1525564800,,592,4.584905660377358
6459744,2,B00L1TML1U,"There is a lot of great footage, that if edited differently, would have made this way better. As it was, it appeared to be some sort of self worshiping by the journalist. The first half he sidelines the people actually doing something to focus on his and his son's relationship.

6459748,3,B00L1TML1U,"I watched Restrepo and Korengal a few years ago and assumed this would be something similar. I was sorely mistaken. Two minutes in and I was already cringing at the commentary by Mike.
To be clear, this is not a documentary about the war or the troops- this is a documentary about Mike. Every time I thought a soldier was speaking giving his point of view, it turned out to be Mike or Carlos talking about how difficult it was for them to be embedded with the soldiers. From the pauses in the statistic slides to the shots of Mike interviewing himself, I couldn't watch more than the first thirty minutes due to Mike's lust for the spotlight.
I get that it's difficult stuff, I understand that it's extremely dangerous (I probably couldn't do it myself) but putting yourself in every other shot is not what people want to see. Restrepo is a model of how an embedded war documentary should be: no shots of the reporters, just interviews with the soldiers and their life in a remote region of Afghanistan.
Mike was in it for himself, and his son should never have gone with him.
An earlier review stated all of this already, but I felt the need to chime in as well.",1524355200,,1163,4.4392523364485985

The war correspondent however, really had no business being out there under those conditions.  I have no military experience, but from the side lines, it looked to me like he did not belong there and may have compromised that team's performance.  That should never happen.",1523145600,,491,4.867469879518072
6459755,5,B00L1TML1U,"I know Mike personally and professionally. I saw the film well before it's release in a private screening. At the time I had only been removed from my time as a Military Journalist with the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson by 6 years and my own service by 11 years. I have seen personally what Mike felt with in his assignment. The Film was actually a byproduct of his assignment and it not only captures the intensity of what our military fighting service members have and are going through, it captures what was unintended. A Man and his son mending a relationship that had been lost. I saw how the assignment effected Mike and I saw the PTSD as well. I don't feel this film over did anything. It wasn't meant to be a strict documentary of what the military alone went through, it was also about how a witness to war is also affected by it. To say there was too much Mike and not enough Soldier is to miss the point of the film entirely. To say it was dramatized in the least is also wrong. I totally get how Veterans may have this view, but try to look beyond your experiences and see how the non-combatant is also a part of the story. As a Active Duty Military Trained Journalist I saw  much of what Mike saw and I had to keep my own story out of it, Mike did that for the original assignment and provided the footage and stories he was assigned to do, this film again is merely a by-product and an account through his eyes an how he has come to deal with the inhumanity of War and how even the ugliest part of our conflicts can bring about change for the good.

6459757,2,B00L1TML1U,"After watching this film, I don't think the soldiers and their point of views were given much credit at all. It's mainly about a man trying to justify his career decision that dismantled his personal, family life. Afghanistan war is a very controversial, misunderstood war, very political in all aspect of how Taliban can infiltrate in their own country, neighboring countries, and even in the U.S. What needs to be mentioned and show is how these brave men and women, who chose this career path, if you so call it's a career, not about the war correspondent journalist's career choice, fight, cope during, after the war, watching their friends died in a battle, and continue to fight for safety for all.",1522540800,,704,4.8264462809917354

It was GOOD to see the soldiers again, to see their struggle, and the good that was done there to try to keep the people of Afghanistan safe. I would hope this kind of footage would help civilians understand a little better what a soldier is, and what it is like for them...

That being said, like some of the other reviewers here, I feel this documentary should not have involved so much personal drama from behind the camera, that is not what a war corespondent is supposed to do. Aside from the fact that it was just flat campy. This should have focused solely on the soldiers. Instead it felt as if this was a way to toot his own horn, and to try to bring glory to himself and his son.

People join the military for many reasons. Some volunteer for combat units, maybe out of pride, bravado or others. They do not get to decide where they are sent. But when in battle, they fight for each other - to keep the brothers and sisters safe. They fight so they can get home back to their families.

6459850,2,B00L1TML1U,"I wish I could give 2.5 stars because I have to give credit for the outstanding footage.  It was beyond compelling and was also the only reason I lasted the entire documentary.  I will also give Mike and Carlos Boettcher credit for risking their lives by embedding with these soldiers.  But that's as much as I can say about that...

 Overall, the narration seemed contrived and like an audition tape for a news reporter/anchor position.  The title may be called ""The Hornet's Nest"" but maybe 30-35% of the movie is actually about the soldier's experience in the valley.  And when I say 30-35% of it being the soldier's experience, I really mean 15-20% because the rest of the time was dedicated to Boettcher and his experience.  A common theme I've seen in any critical review of the film is that Boettcher is too superfluous, almost self-indulgent in his narration and the way he navigates his time of Afghanistan. The first half of the film is dedicated to something completely personal and unrelated: Mike goes on about how he was a poor father who was never around while his kids were growing up and now this life-threatening trip to Afghanistan would be a great opportunity to reconnect with his son who has absolutely no combat experience.  From that moment forward, every experience is tinted with Boettcher's personal stake in it - how the experience scared him/affected him, what he was thinking and feeling throughout enemy fire.  Even when his son isn't around, it continues to be this self self-absorbed ego-trip for Boettcher who just seems to be coming to grips with the fact that he's aging and can't embed much longer.  When tragedy strikes, all he really has to say about it is, ""How do you process that... as a reporter with a camera?... you don't.""  That's just not what this film should have been about.

One incredibly insensitive and condescending moment stood out though. When Boettcher is explaining the actions taken by a particular soldier during a firefight, this is what he has to say, ""In the middle of this battle, specialist Lindskog, this timid young man who you wouldn't expect would do anything heroic, runs through this hail of gunfire to try to save his fellow soldiers and another afghan soldier.""  I'm sorry but every man and woman who becomes a member of our military is heroic.  Their job is to is to do the things you and I are not necessarily capable of doing, at the risk of their own life, for the protection of our entire country.  That is brave.  And that is heroic.  Maybe Boettcher was just trying to frame the scene but, regardless, it was patronizing and incredibly crass.

The only reason I would suggest this film is to see and appreciate the footage for it's compelling, raw and captivating content.  Otherwise, the story is a disappointing homage to a war correspondent-with-an-Achilles-Complex's career that is inching ever closer to retirement.",1511395200,2,2901,4.822222222222222

I agree with other reviewers the narration from the producer detracted from rather than added to the quality of the film.  The MH professional in me wanted to sign him up for a few sessions related to emotional processing and his relationship with his son which came across as far more pitiful than the touching story he seems to have intended.  Nonetheless, his capturing of the plight of these soldiers was excellent and I'm glad he was willing to be on the front lines to tell this story.  It is truly heartwrenching.

This is just unnecessary killing and destruction, we are fighting an ideology, a sick religion and are afraid to admit that. When they kill, they do it in the name of Allah, and 90% of their people support them. Why are we there? What did they ever do to us? The attackers of 911 were all from Saudi Arabia, none from Afghanistan, so why? Why did our troops go in there with no support.

The visceral visage of a close RPG round that in and of itself, rips your heart out when it's landing on those you love and serve with. Being inside a helicopter with your brothers, or kids, bleeding in front of you. The way the dirt leaps from this Earth when an explosion is so intimately close to you. The first words from a leaders mouth telling you someone you've trained and served with, become family with, is dead. That utter shock of desperate disbelief. Then quickly followed by knowing your close friend isn't coming back to shoot the bull with you. That last roll call. Hearing their names while you're still trying to figure out how fragile and yet, blazing life was for them and you. The part of your mind that says, ""As a leader, I wasn't going to cry. Yet now I sob."" Snot running down your face a bit slower than the tears. The grief because you know their family back home and you can't be there for them any more than you could be there for your buddies when they were killed. Be it feet or miles from you, for some reason or another, you weren't there to save them. Help them.

The problem with this film is Mike Boettcher. He talks about his sacrifices, but they pale in comparison to what those soldiers sacrificed.

What does he even mean by this?  Is the military a ""dick measuring contest all of a sudden?  This comment is exactly what creates animosity and resentment among the ranks and disrupts unit cohesion.

6459994,2,B00L1TML1U,"I am a former Infantryman/11B in the Army and a combat veteran of both major theaters in the Global War on Terror. The combat footage in this documentary made me physically, mentally, and emotionally uncomfortable, such is it's quality. So much to the point that I almost couldn't finish it. It is my opinion that with respect to the footage proper, this is utterly seminal, industry redefining work. A magnum opus befitting a combat correspondent so experienced. It should, without qualification, redefine what people think of when they hear the words ""combat correspondence"". That's all I have to say about that.

In light of this footage of immense quality, I find it... unfortunate that Mike Boettcher felt so compelled to attempt to dramatize this material. What I can only describe as Lifetime movie grade monologues about himself, his career, and his attempts at attempting to rekindle his waning relationship with his son completely ruin this film. I will not go so far as to declare this work disrespectful on his part as I have a very different view of the service than many. I will, however, say that it was completely unnecessary and very much detracted from the otherwise immensely compelling footage. You don't need to engage in creative editing about your son catching a round on a ridge side and dying, when people were actually dying, captured on footage so clear it had my heart rate over 100BPM sitting in a chair. There was no need to introduce your own drama, there was plenty to be had.

Mr. Boettcher is a war corespondent, and in his rush for fame he seems to have forgotten that. You are there to report on the war, not produce a creative melodrama with Afghani scenery and gun fire in the backdrop. It is because of these intertwining scenes of melodrama I am forced to remove three stars from what would have otherwise been a flawless and unbelievably realistic photo thesis on modern combat. This documentary could have been so much more, could have been so close to perfect. Instead, it was turned into a mediocre and unpalatable docudrama. If this film had been half the length due to the endless ramblings and reality TV grade false crisis being edited out, it would have been a five star production. As it is now, I personaly find it a waste of the finest combat footage to ever emerge.",1499040000,304,2318,4.749379652605459
6459995,2,B00L1TML1U,"This is a great movie if you click through exactly ALL of the footage of Mike Boettcher. What a self-important piece of garbage. Not even one bit of this movie suggests anyone involved in its production could be mistaken for a ""professional journalist"".  It is more like the masturbatory war-porn video diary of a self-indulgent rich guy tourist, and his spoiled, know-nothing son. Their needlessly melodramatic dialog, coupled with the overdone musical score is not only complete amateurish claptrap, but it is an insult to the men and women who are supposed to be the actual subjects of the story. SPOILER ALERT, but the part where they intentionally edited the footage to make us think poor Carlos was dead, was not only cheap, but also in incredibly poor taste, considering actual soldiers did end up losing their lives in this film.  My heart goes out to everyone who puts their lives on the line for this country.  They deserve to be better honored than being treated as afterthoughts to Mr Boettcher's precious Peabody Award, and whatever other distinctions he bragged about.

It's biggest and most persistent flaw is that Boettcher & Son desperately want to be the co-stars of this film. The disproportionate emphasis on their father/son adventure is out of place when soldiers they are filming are being killed in combat. At certain points what would've been incredibly moving moments are shattered by close-ups of Mr. Boettcher offering his own, overly choreographed remarks while he seems to be straining with all his might to force a tear down his cheek. The documentary is punctuated with how all of this affects Mr. Boettcher and his son and we are even treated to a short segment about their Emmy award winning journalism. Towards the end we see a commanding officer weeping at the memorial service for his fallen boys. Mr. Boettcher, not content to let the moment say all that needs to be said, has to tell us that he was crying too. In his final remarks he hitches his wagon to the valor of the men we've just watched (or watched in between Boettcher family promos) by using inclusive words like ""we"" and ""us"" as if he played a vital role in completing the dangerous missions. So, yes, he captured some compelling images and interviews, but he let his own self-promotion get in the way of the story you actually wanted to watch.",1498608000,5,1399,4.714285714285714

Good insight into why we lost the war though if you read between the lines.  It is unfortunate that so many sweet kids lost their lives as well.  So painful in that regard.  His use of their loss adds pain to the film since Boettcher sounds so insincere.
Boettcher is a jerk extraordinaire.  He might be phonier than Hilary or Trump.  I kept thinking are the kids being slowed down (and put in danger) because some old, smoking, overweight man is humping over rocks with them.  Of course the army embedded this guy because he would tell a sanitized story so they can share guilt in that as well.
Sad story of journalism.  Sad story of promising young Americans lost.  Bummer all around.",1486425600,2,730,4.596899224806202

Blend with civilians, so to kill one enemy we are killing more civilians, and then we criticize the aliais for that when we do the same thing. But the
Negative side is we send aur young men some of them never comes back, in short these conflict never ends, that people needs a dictator  not

I was advising the ANA at FOB Gamberi at the time and tracked the whole battle from our operations center there. The one thing lacking from first person embedded documentaries like this is the context of the bigger picture. I had travelled with my ANA up and down the Kunar River Valley and into Nuristan over the year that I was there, so when I watch this embedded video story, I am placing the viewpoints and actions in the context of the whole picture I observed at the operational level. I think it is more difficult to appreciate the fullness of what Task Force ""No Slack"" was going through just from the ""Hornet's Nest"". They had fought significant battles in Pech Valley and Watapur earlier in Operations Strong Eagle 1 and 2 and Operation Bulldog Bite.",1485129600,6,896,4.713375796178344

Although this movie doesn't depict war in Afghanistan between 06-10, it does a solid job of portraying the war from 13-15 pretty dang well. I am an OEF 12 combat veteran with the 82nd airborne division, 4th BCT 1-508. This movie shows the necessity of competent leadership, and a strong brotherhood. The first half of the movie is rather slow, and not very exciting, but the second half is gut wrenching and accurate, shows you how quickly life on the battlefield can go from 0 to 60. Most importantly, it shines light on a war long forgotten by the American people.",1481932800,2,753,4.5851851851851855

I wanted to see what exactly it was they did. He never has talked about it. I now understand why. He came home much decorated, didn't act like it was for much. I have come to understand more now. I can not imagine that some of these guys go back over there. He did say that some of the RE's were very good and he wished he could eat them again, I noticed the green packets they ate from.

All I can say is that we, the everyday civilian owe SO much to the men and women who served in Afghanistan and, more importantly, who owe the young men who died during the operations in Afghanistan, our love and eternal remembrance! Such a difficult film to watch as you see young kids, my own son's age, perish on the battlefield. We can ask why they died? But this is not the time or the place! What I can say is that this film depicts absolute heroism, love, and compassion on all fronts. Soldiers risking their lives to save Afghan children who were blown up by their own people, and soldiers paying the ultimate sacrifice to save their fellow soldiers. This is a must see for anyone interested in what happens when young men and women go into war for US! God Bless our troops and God Bless America!!",1468972800,,863,4.433962264150943

I am happy to say I saw none of that in this documentary. The story of the father and son may not be the most captivating part...but it is their good work that tells our story over there; and they do a very good job. I also appreciate that they embed for such a length of time, they can understand the feeling of being there for a year.

Like many others have said, the reporter is trying to make the film about him+his son, not our brave troops.  If the movie cut 90% of the scenes with the reporter in them, it would have got an extra 2 stars from me.  Also, as others have said, he cuts the camera during certain battles...making you think him or his son got KIA.  This was done far too much...and neither of them got killed.  Instead, the reporter made sure to show himself as much as possible, and they got their Emmy award for it.

6460518,4,B00L1TML1U,"A truly riveting documentary that brought me to tears. The film's stunning footage displayed the brutal fighting soldiers experienced in Afghanistan. However, I had a several issues with the editing that led me to vote 4 stars instead of 5. Mind you, these criticisms are incredibly picky and the average viewer would likely never notice.
First, the audio was obviously edited to make the combat footage more intense. Gun shots, bullet ricochets, and explosions were added in to the footage that cheapened its quality. Second, there was poor continuity in the footage of missions. It was evident that different missions from different units were spliced together and  presented as one continuous mission. This could be seen in the helmet patches of the soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division. One single scene would show soldiers from 3rd Brigade (Tori symbol), 4th Brigade (Black Hearts) and 1st Brigade (Clubs symbol) as if they were all the same unit. Finally, some of the B Roll footage was misplaced and misleading. For example, a photo of a supposed grieving mother was wearing MILES gear- indicating that it was an actor during a training scenario. Another example was when the footage of an Apache helicopter cut to a scene of a Blackhawk cockpit as if to show the pilot that flying the Apache.

These small issues, in my opinion, degraded the quality of the otherwise amazing footage of the film. This will rank among my favorite documentary despite the few flaws that I found distracting.",1462752000,3,1501,5.0
6460519,4,B00L1TML1U,"Good show, much better than I thought it would be when I first started to watch it.

One of the reasons war makes members of a fighting unit come together like brothers even closer than real brothers is the intensity of having your life in their hands and vice/versa. Having a father who had been in many conflicts and then to  have is only son come with him to see for himself why his dad missed growing up with his family. It  shows a fathers love and concern for his son doing things that could get him killed as well as the son finding his own direction and following in his father's footsteps.",1456099200,,676,4.31496062992126

I felt like their was just too much scripted nonsense from the journalist. The things he says in a lot of the scenes, the added effects, and the multiple attempts to make us think he was shot and dead (when he drops his camera, the scene fades black, and dramatic music plays, just to have him pop back up and act like nothing happened) - it really annoyed me.

For me, the only raw scene that I felt hit home, was the ending scene when they were paying their respects to the fallen soldiers. That was not scripted in any way, the journalist did little talking, and it just showed video and the true emotion from everyone. If it would have been like that throughout the whole film, I would probably have given this more stars. But I give it 3 out of 5 just because the journalist made it more about him and his nonsense than he did the actual soldiers and the reason he was there.",1453593600,,1013,4.248704663212435

6460819,5,B00L1TML1U,"The Hornets Nest  2014  THN Movie  Rated R  DVD edition:

1.  Mike Boettcher is crazy.
2.  Why are there no subtitles?
3.  This is the most real war documentary Ive ever seen.

Mike Boettcher made a career out of war journalism.  As he explains at the outset of this film, that career cost him a lot of time with his family.  When he prepared to again head to Afghanistan in 2011, his now-grown son insisted he was going with him as it would give him a chance to understand why you kept leaving us to do this.  He finally agreed, his son went, and later the two of them became the only father-son team to win an award for their reporting.

Both were equipped with forward and backward-facing body cameras and microphones to film action as it was going on.  During their tour they went out with a group of 101 Airborne on what was supposed to be a 1-day strike inside the most significant Taliban command center in the country, inside Helmand province.  The one-day strike turned into 9 days as Taliban immediately surrounded them on all sides and attacked daily.  Attacks were so intense that it was very difficult to get any helicopters in safely for evacuation or resupply.

What makes this different from most war films is that it was unscripted (other than the editing that always accompanies creating a film out of raw footage, and periodic narration by Mike into the camera), there were no actors, the reporters were sanctioned by the military but not a part of the military, and all the footage is real-time.  The bulk of it involved active combat environments as well.  No matter what you thought about the war in Afghanistan, this would give a viewer a more realistic picture of what our combat troops engaged in there.  Intense.",1449532800,,1738,4.5811688311688314

But I was to be very wrong, as I watched this movie and got more and more into it. It dawned on me that this is something never seen before by the American public. I have seen video from the Vietnam war: discussing news documentary's, but too see this film and see what truly happens in the middle of an actual battle, I can only say that all Americans should see this film for themselves. I cried in anger and heartache as I watched this video, and at the end I could not hold back from the tears that was flowing down my face and the hurt that was in my heart. Thinking of the lost soles that gallantly gave their lives for their fellow soldiers to save their lives. I can only say if I could give this film 100 stars it wouldn't be enough,  watch and see for yourself and as A fellow American, tell me what you feel inside.",1447632000,9,924,4.133333333333334

6460988,1,B00L1TML1U,"A war correspondent (Mike Boettcher) makes a documentary about himself instead of the men and women from the 101st protecting him. That's what the description should have said. About 20 minutes into the film they edit it to pretend his son gets shot to make it more dramatic, that's when i knew this was going to be bad. They edited in audio of bullets buzzing by and impacting, again for added dramatics. Mike sticks his camera in the face of a kid who had just had part of his leg blown off by an IED. When he does self commentary about his son i felt as though he was acting. They also added ""exciting/drama"" music that sounded like it was from a reality TV show like Cops, which to me diminishes the true importance of what America's service members endure, and is disrespectful. This wasn't a story about American heroes, it was about a deadbeat father and his son trying to make a movie in order to profit from it while using America's service members as extras.

What could the driver and his passengers have possibly thought?  The little one following 'her soldier'.  And so many people helped this movie.  I had no idea while watching it.  Near the end of this movie my tears squirted hard when the text popped up that said we were gonna be outta there in Dec. 2014.  I suspect it was a typo.  Should've said Dec. 2114.

Mike's inner conflict of doing his job, exposing his son to the severe dangers of his job, and documenting the deep sadness of soldiers losing losing close friends is heart-wrenching. This has nothing to do with whether you agree with America's involvement in the Afghan war, or not. It's a candid portrayal of what happened on the frontline, generally without much commentary. How sad that some reviewers misinterpreted the valor and pride of these soldiers as rah rah and propaganda.

This documentary touched me in a couple different ways. Seeing the correspondents go through the same danger as any soldier surprised me and I believe this man is one of the best. He captured the true feelings of soldiers pinned down not knowing if this is the day they die and watching their buddies die. Of course I was touched by  every one of the soldiers that said they fight for the man next to them to get them home and that is the true heart of the US Military.

I deployed twice while in the Marines from 2003-2007 with 1st Battalion 8th Marines and since getting out I have watched countless documentaries on Iraq/Afghanistan. I remember seeing the trailer for ""The Hornet's Nest"" and at the time thinking it looked promising but I couldn't help but assume it would be the same as so many other films I had already seen. I am proud to report that is not the case... In my personal opinion this is the best documentary I have seen on the subject of the United States involvement in Iraq or Afghanistan. It gives a first person perspective of what life is like for our troops on the front lines and shows the toll that our service members pay on a daily basis.

6461577,4,B00L1TML1U,"I was affected by this movie.  I would definitely watch it again.  The story of Jameson Lindskog is worth the price of admission alone.

However, I don't think it was a well put together story.  The first half of the movie concentrates on Mike Boettcher and his son Carlos going to war together.  While there was one scene that took my breath away, overall the story wasn't compelling.  I can see why Mike and Carlos know that is compelling, but it wasn't drawn in.

The second half of the movie was incredible, but didn't pay off the narrative introduced at the beginning of the movie.  I have rarely seen footage as real, moving, and powerful as what I saw in the last 45 minutes of this movie.  Mike Boettcher is a great combat journalist, obviously.

The last 10 minutes of this movie had me in tears.  It was shot well and directed well.  It is one of the most powerful scenes I've ever watched.

But at the very end, Mike brings it back to himself.  His quote at the very end, my headline, is powerful.  But I didn't feel like the movie focused on the role of a journalist.  The first half and last few minutes focused on the role of a war corespondent, but the most emotionally powerful parts focused on the soldiers themselves.

Watch this movie.  Mike was too deep in his job to allow us as viewers to really get into what he has to go through to get us the footage we need to see.  He edited this movie to highlight the sacrifices that the soldiers made for us, while explaining but glossing over the sacrifices that he and his family made so we could see the realities of war.  I went into this movie expecting more about Mike, his job, and his family based on the description and first half.  I only take away one star because war journalism as a topic is only given lip service.",1441152000,,1791,4.3343373493975905

To see ground troops being pinned down and the lack of air support or artillery for our troops was shocking!  I had no idea our forces are going in harms way without full support of our combined arms.

Stepping stone to the gate of a battered hinge opening.  Whirlwind of adversity for  awful of cost.  Never is freedom free.  Too those who endure the training and flickering abuse.

6461985,5,B00L1TML1U,"We chose this movie out of simple curiosity, as all of us are interested in military history--and we were very impressed. It isn't often that you get a true ""first hand"" account of a war through the eyes of a war correspondent, as they are generally shooting footage for the armchair generals at home. In this case, the movie not only gave us a real and immediate respect for our troops in harm's way in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the world--it gave us a unique look into a father/son relationship as well.

These are the types of ""war movies"" we need to see more of--as so few people really understand what war and our military are about. Watching these brave soldiers trying to balance military effectiveness with safety of civilians, and watching the relationship develop between Mike and his son was truly an eye-opening and at times emotional experience. I'll be the first to admit we were wary about this movie--so many of the current and past ""war documentaries"" we have seen have been politically slanted and almost anti-military. This movie wasn't. Whatever Mike Boettcher's personal views may be on war and politics, he was able to put them aside and do an amazing job documenting one of the most difficult and horrifying events--war--and he did so in a very personal but also professional way. We're already planning on looking for more of his work.

As parents, we were also able to identify with his parenting issues--as both of us have been asked similar questions by our children. I know very well how hurtful it can be to have a child ask the question Mike's son asked, but I can't begin to imagine how terrifying it must have been to take a totally inexperienced person into harm's way--especially when that person is your son. I can truthfully say I don't have the courage to do what he does for a living--and I can't imagine how much courage it took for him to agree to bring his son with him, into a situation where other parents' sons were dying. In his own way, Mike is as brave as the military personnel he traveled with, and I hope there are more war correspondents out there who can do their work with as much professionalism and objectivity when he retires--or gets killed, as many war correspondents do.",1437523200,,2232,4.66243654822335

This embed report by ABC World News reporter Mike, and his son show the real difficulties of fighting a guerilla war in the hostile and difficult terrain of Afghanistan. It also demonstrates the necessity of proper ""air support"" from our flying forces, both fixed wing, and rotor winged aircraft. It was evident that without that air support the troops on the ground were very disadvantaged against the guerilla's of the Taliban forces, who knew their terrain very well and had advantage of familiarity and cover.
The Taliban leader and the mountainside ""city"" where he resided was really amazing, but created a death trap for the Marines once they arrived and took efforts to locate ""Mohammed Mullah whatever"". It appeared as a Taos-like resort built into the mountainside, and probably housed thousands of Afghani's at it's peak. The Afghani's learned well how to combat a rotor winged force during their fight against the Russians during the Eighties and Nineties.
Just wish we could leave such a country alone to stand on it's own, but time has proven otherwise. OBL was right in setting up jihadist training camps there in the first place as it was pretty well off of the map during those years that he was planning his ""Great Jihad"".",1437436800,2,1267,4.87037037037037

6462048,1,B00L1TML1U,"I found this to be one of the most bombastic pieces of propaganda I've seen on the Afghanistan War. Frankly, it makes me leery of all of Mike Boettcher's past reports. This is not reportage, but patriotic jingoism. American and allied troops were under heavy pressure during the time of this filming.. There was (and is) widespread concern for the lack of achievable war aims both at tactical and strategic levels. Boettcher reduces all this to a Viet Nam like struggle for the hearts and minds of the Afghani's- grossly oversimplifying a dangerous and frustrating situation. Allied efforts at infrastructure creation and nation building have been undermined by the complexity of ethnic and tribal divisions, corruption fuelled by a wilfully blind eye regarding opium and hashish production on the part of ""friendly"" govt. officials, warlords and tribal leaders, and finally the complete failure to implement public education outside the sphere of radical Islamic fundamentalism.  Although the election of Mohammad Ashraf Ghani as President of Afghanistan is an enormously hopeful sign, the thousands of NATO troops remaining in the country are still mired in the failures of the early years of the war: alliances made to local leaders without regard to their legitimacy or integrity, the lack of viable alternatives to an opium based economy, and a lack of strategy regarding an educational systems that is almost entirely in the hands of anti-Western clerics. Compound all this with the destabilising efforts of our supposed friend Pakistan and it becomes amply evident that the blood shed by Americans, our Nato allies and as many as 200,000 Afghan civilians has bought very little security, freedom or even hope. This film's rah rah, can- do-ism is either naive or false. To be honest, I suspect Boettcher of the latter. Our soldiers have paid far too much on blood and sweat for so little in return.",1437004800,13,1904,5.122186495176849

Until I watched this documentary I had a much different view of the war in Afghanistan and how the Marines/Soldiers were fighting that war.  In Vietnam there were those that were going to be ambushed and those who have been ambushed.  But....being ambushed last about 3 minutes or less....It's the initial chaos that's terrifying.  Afghanistan in many cases is house to house which would terrify me.  It's one thing to walk through the jungle with 20 other guys but being the first one to open that door, the first to be exposed is just too much for me.",1437004800,2,805,4.673758865248227

This could have been the greatest war doc of the Afghan war, along with Restrepo, simply due to the 'luck' of being where the action is and filming at the same time, but falls short due to Mike Boettcher's banal, nearly completely superfluous and interrupting commentary. Literally, he stops the doc, the footage, and the momentum to film himself and say the obvious. The idea frame used for the documentary, reporting from a war zone with his untrained son as a father/son last ditch bonding endeavor, should have been a one line reference and the only personal reference. Instead the viewer gets hit over the head with it and the Soldiers and Marines are nearly ignored, the very ones who are keeping the Boettcher's alive so they can make a doc in the first place. Boettcher and his son do get high marks for putting themselves out there. As I mentioned the extended combat footage and the events it records are very powerful and well presented and the final 25 minutes is content understandably rarely filmed for the public so unique in its availability and very moving. It's unfortunate that such content and potential was squandered by self interest.",1436054400,6,1334,4.855263157894737

6462217,4,B00L1TML1U,"Great to watch. You really feel the action, you see what happens on the battle field and you hope that they'll all make it back home.
But this is war and casualties are inevitable.
I did not care too much about the journalists story though. If you don't want your son dead then don't let him go to the war zone.
If it's your job then that's what you have chosen.
However the movie should have been only about the brave soldiers.
Still I believe it is a movie that should be watched especially by those that criticize and have no respect for the ones that risk their lives every day.",1435363200,,582,4.252252252252252

6462219,3,B00L1TML1U,"I'm giving this movie three stars just for the heroes on the ground and the impressive 101st Airborne. However, Mike Boettcher takes up WAY too much of this film. The entire first half is crowded with the story of his relationship with his son and how he's trying to bond. We hear all about his career up to this point, his Emmy award, etc. It's distracting and has absolutely NOTHING to do with the Kunar Province and the U.S. Army. His relationship with his family should have been an entirely separate film. Never crowd your main plot line.

The second half is more about the battles and a little more back to the point, but here I was shocked again by him cutting in to talk about HIMSELF and how much danger he's in. He was even turning the camera around to show HIS face during the battle! All the battle information should have been relayed by interviews with soldiers. I would have loved to get to know them on an individual level. It would have greatly benefitted the film.

His ego ruined this movie for me.",1435363200,123,1017,4.433155080213904

6462222,1,B00L1TML1U,"On the positive side: the footage and background of the mission of this particular group of soldiers provided a context that you don't get from random youtube battle footage. And of course, you see the real sacrifice that our soliders make.  On the negative side: I think it's a disgrace for journalists to make a story about themselves and to inject themselves into the storyline. Taking your doughy, inexperienced, never been in battle son with you? irresponsible.  Did he have conflict zone, hostile environment training? or was he an added burden to the troops he was embedded with.  This ""film"" was riddled with generic ethnic/tribal sounding music, hackneyed lingo describing battles and the situation against the enemy and constant mugging for the camera by the so-called journalists. It's a given that news organizations often craft stories to fit their own preconceived ideas or storyline (kinda the nature of the industry). But it's a shame for individual journalists to shape a story to fit their own purpose and self-glamorization.  I have more respect for that idiot clown in the documentary Point and Shoot. The milk-toast guy who went to Libya and became a freedom fighter. He didn't know what he was doing, but at least he picked up a gun (when he remembered to grab it). And as a side note, I don't question the sacrifices, patriotism or dedication of our troops, but the ""embedded"" journalist, a new phenomenon since the 1st Gulf War poses a problem since journalists are less able to be question the very presence of US troops, when they are dependent on the same troops to protect them every day. Boettchner doesn't question the longest engagement ever of  US troops a single time, when it's his job to at least ask the question.",1435363200,18,1749,4.89527027027027

Suffice it to say, if you want to see, or if you have wondered, what our soldiers go through in real life fighting in Afghanistan this is must see film.

The narration by the primary experienced journalist, along with some coming of age exposure for his son experiencing a glimpse at what his father has been doing for a living, is not bad and actually very real and brings home that death or injury can happen at any second.

I also think it helps those that were to young for the Vietnam war, to witness a little of what it is like to come under fire from an enemy you can't see.
The only difference is arid and mountainous terrain versus hot and steamy jungle. The enemy hides well.

Finally, I think showing how much soldiers care for each other - that brother and sister hood  - is shown to be a very real thing. And, the final scenes brings that home. Not only for soldiers that have served before, during, and after this period...but also for those who never have served.

Well done and worth the time to watch!",1434931200,,1083,4.28921568627451

I could see how this life had a pull on the father, but it also took a huge psychological toll on him. His son got to know his father and bond through the experience, and his son learned quite a bit about the work itself.

The situation portrayed just seemed hopeless. My observation was that the cost of operating in Afghanistan was in some sense unrealistically high. Such high costs of operation don't seem to favor the side that has to spend so much, over the long run.

You both really did an outstanding..really outstanding reporting both in film and comments.

The film shows the true grit of our Soldiers who fight on regardless!  Of those who did not make it back, we shall never forget those fallen heros and they shall live in our hearts forever.

Is this a movie, a video, a documentary a docudrama or something else. It seems to try to be all of the above. And it does none of them well.
It does not entertain. It does sort of document. But the documentary aspect of this video keeps moving back and forth between a documentary of the soldiers and a documentary that might be called ""Hey Look At Me...I've Got A Camera And I'm Out Here Playing Soldier.""

In short this is a video that lost it's way and doesn't know how to get back. Save that hour and a half of your life and watch something else.",1432857600,2,824,4.215189873417722

It left unquestioned why so many Afghani's were suspicious of, unwelcoming to, and hostile toward US forces. And from an American perspective, why we are still poking the hornet's nest especially at such a cost in terms of fatalities and  casualties to our military forces. I was shocked to see the amount of and supplies and equipment as well as weaponry we are investing there. It has to be in the billions of dollars. Toward what end?  I got the sense that this movie was made by the father and son photographers to pay tribute to and thank the forces who had protected them  and with whom they had bonded and especially to honor those lost their lives in combat.

Afghanistan looks like central Nevada through northern Arizona... except hotter. Having to fight and survive in that hostile environment is a daunting task.

The film represents the best character of American troops. Their courage and dedication are inspiring. No one cannot watch Hornet's Nest without becoming emotionally involved. This is a very powerful film. It needs to be seen by EVERY American, regardless of their view of the war.

No animals were harmed during the filming of Hornet's Nest... except for that stupid chicken.",1431475200,,592,5.344086021505376

Glory be to the war journalists that have had a wonderful decade and a half of US war and conflict to build their resumes.  As a veteran of these wars all I can say is that it nothing more than a ""heart strings"" film designed to make you feel good about the lives we are throwing away.

If you watch this film and come away with anything but disgust about the lives of both Americans and Afghans lost then you couldn't read between the lines.  Our troops are the best guys around and Americans, as a whole, love to love them.....but they sure don't want to be them.

It gets under your skin, and it sticks to your heart and soul. Mike and Carlos Boettcher have given me a gift that is as precious to me as my son Bryan is. Taking footage while taking fire ranks high on my list of heroics. These two men risked their lives to bring home footage of what our Armed Forces risk their lives for every single day. Christian Tureaud, David Salzberg, Jr., Jason Mergot, Brent Dones and many, many others have put together a spine-tingling film that every person that values Freedom should see.

6463090,4,B00L1TML1U,"Focuses a little too much on the journalist father-son story (vice the soldiers and Marines) for the first half, but still tells the story of those units in Afghanistan.  The last 45 minutes of the film were (for me) the best part in terms of providing for an accurate portrayal of the raw emotions and the lesser-known difficulties of fighting in Afghanistan.  The cinematography is beautiful and sound mixing fantastic, but it's still very similar to the Restrepo-type perspective (cameraman on the ground taping the fights). Regardless, it was still very well done.

For those of you who have experience actual combat (especially in Afghanistan) similar to these soldiers and Marines, it may make you somewhat uncomfortable or emotional in ways that are good and bad. At the end of the film, everyone likely will sit in silence and try to absorb what they just observed - it has the affect.",1417478400,,893,4.900662251655629

6463093,5,B00L1TML1U,"Overall, this is an eye-opening look on the inside of the everyday life of a USArmy infantryman with some accounts of the lives of some marines deployed in the region as well. The documentary starts out from a father's perspective undertaking some first-hand accounts of the war in Afghanistan with his son, all the while trying to deepen their relationship. Going to war with his son, both as journalists, reveals a positive effect on their relationship and they grow closer.

The story then transitions and begins to focus in on the experiences of soldiers and marines. The plight of the soldiers ends with the harrowing tale of the ""Hornet's Nest."" What begins as a routine mission goes awry for one company element of the 101st Airborne Division. A one-day firefight against invisible enemies in a valley in Afghanistan evolves in to a one-week long test of integrity, determination, and sacrifice. You won't finish watching the end of this with a dry eye.

Retrospectively, beyond the eye opening physical trials and the emotional roller-coasters that this film conveyed so well, the lasting impression that remains is the resiliency, honesty, and unshakable morality of every soldier interviewed.",1417219200,2,1202,5.158974358974359

This very poorly edited documentary of an actual, run-of-the-mill operation has no where near the emotional impact of any of the really well-done docu-dramas it cites. If anyone needs convincing, then PLEASE see any one of those films and then see this film.

On top of everything else, the camera man should NEVER have opened his mouth. All the way through the film, he is only too eager to tell us about HIS feelings. As a result, this film becomes grating, and awful, and narcissistic almost immediately.",1415750400,23,675,4.760683760683761

6463169,2,B00L1TML1U,"Decidedly mediocre. The film is poorly organized and the music is annoyingly ominous. The frequent camera shots from a dropped, sideways camera edited to make it seem like the filmmakers got shot was silly and does not fit the genre. Mike Boettcher's commentary is melodramatic and confusingly self-centered.

Which leads to my into my biggest criticism: Mike Boettcher manages to turn the story of Afghanistan and American military personnel into a self-centered home video aimed at launching his son's journalism career and, allegedly, patching up their relationship. The guy basically tells you up front that he has spent his life putting his work and himself ahead of everything else. That becomes clear once the film starts rolling. He follows hard-working Soldiers and Marines around, occasionally asking them dumb questions like ""did you sign up for this?"" while complaining about how much gear HE had to carry and how tired HE was. It's disrespectful to the guys humping heavier packs than him while clearing compounds, searching for IEDs, pulling triggers, and not complaining about it. Even more disappointing, I didn't learn anything especially profound about the war or the people who fight it, which is what I care about and why people watch these kinds of films.

This film tries to compete with ""Restrepo,"" but ""Restrepo"" is a superiorly shot and edited film that leaves the viewer with a deeper understanding of the Americans who have been fighting wars since 2001. ""Hornet's Nest"" treats them as a shallow, monolithic background set piece to the (apparently) more important story: Mike Boettcher and his son.",1412467200,13,1625,5.198473282442748

6463171,5,B00L1TML1U,I really brought this Documentary.  Watched it today as an Iraq War Veteran with 2 Deployments under my belt it hits pretty close to home a few times.  I never deployed to Afghanistan so I am always curious to see what it was like for the guy's over there.  Very well made no one took a political side or tried to push politics it just shows what it's like for the guys over there.,1412294400,,381,4.121621621621622
6463172,1,B00L1TML1U,"This movie is a complete waste of money and very misleading. It was apparent very soon that the movie wasn't about the soldiers but about how heroic the cameraman and his son were. I decided I had had enough when there was a scene of a suicide bombing that injured some children, and the footage used was role players wearing ""MILES"" gear, or laser sensor vests that we would use in combat training.
Stupid movie, and total disrespect to any soldier that served.",1412208000,12,462,4.578313253012048
6463173,5,B00L1TML1U,I loved watching this documentary it was a very good father-son team during the filming and facing the same dangers as the Marines and soldiers they were embedded with in the war zone. The war footage was excellent and it was not Hollywood type filming. There is scenes were the camera goes down on the ground for periods but you can still hear the action going on around them. You will see soldiers in this film and not all of them make it until the end. There is no showing of dead American military men in this film only moments showing them when they were living which is the decent thing. I rented this show from Amazon rather then buying it.,1412208000,,647,4.355371900826446

6463175,3,B00L1TML1U,"I think the latest reviews (at the time of writing this) as well as the packaging is misleading. Contrary to what descriptions are  written and promises seen on the cover, this documentary is largely about the journalists filming and not the men they are embedded with. Don't get me wrong, war journalists such as the father and son featured in the documentary are incredibly brave, putting they're lives on the line to capture incredible war footage.

But the BluRay is billed as being about the soldiers fighting the war.

Aside from twenty-odd minutes of time towards the end, the film focuses on what the father has sacrificed being war journalist over the years (family, friends,etc) and an effort to get closer to his son. This focus of the journalists seems darkly comical when the soldiers are running around the photographers during a firefight, yet the camera keeps coming back to the journalists looking distressingly into the lens. All this is a great shame as the father (Mike Boettcher) has a talent for capturing great footage and when he takes the time in the documentary to interview the soldiers, does a great job.

But he doesn't and its difficult to know who is who and sadly, leaving the viewer to play 'catch-up' when the inevitable casualties come from an egagement.

Being from a military family I was a little upset when Mike Boettcher tags his journalistic sacrifices and efforts on the end of the documentary, riding the coat tails of the emotional service honoring fallen soldiers of the unit.

Sebastian Junger was rarely seen or heard in Restrepo, making his documentary about the soldiers putting their lives on the line for the country and its cause. While the fighting men and women in the documentary are obviously beyond compare, the documentary isn't of the same focus as Restrepo.

6463188,1,B00L1TML1U,"I served in Iraq and Afghanistan. This video is a total waste of money. The journalist uses American soldiers as background props to glorify his own courage and role as a photojournalist embedded with troops and how great he thinks his son is. The journalist in this documentary spends more time talking about himself and his son then about the soldiers. He turns the whole thing into a story about himself, praising himself and obviously his son, while largely ignoring the soldiers. The footage for most of the thing is short and terrible. You could tell he was ducking for cover every time the wind blew. He was obviously overdramatizing his emotions and various situations. I could tell the soldiers found him tedious and irritating. They had to deal with him though and be polite. I know how they felt. He also made sure to make a few liberal cracks at the war. This thing was terrible. I noted it won a few Emmys.

This film shows you first hand a glimpse of what war really is in this day and age. It shows you the sacrifice that the men and woman of our great nation have made for you and I. It also shows the realism of the ultimate sacrifice made by an American to give his own life for this great nation. Without these men and woman this nation would be nothing.

At least up to 40 minutes in, it failed to reveal any more about combat than can be found on YouTube. I was still waiting for the ""hornet's nest"" when I turned the TV off.

I was pretty excited about this film, but as far as I'm concerned it should have been titled ""How I worried about my son while embedded with the US military.""

I've supported hundreds of Marine units since 2001 and am in constant contact with Marines deployed to Afghanistan now. I supported many of the 3/3 Marines (America's Battalion) during the time this was filmed. It's not like I don't have a clue about what really goes on. Yes, most of the time patrol is mundane. When it does go kinetic obviously embedded journalists had a hard time expressing it through their camera.

The film is well described in other reviews, and has a correct perfect 5 stars by every rater so far--anyone who gives a lesser rating will probably have an agenda not related to the film.  What struck me most were unanimous comments from many in the large audience who had been in deep combat that this film better portrayed their personal experiences than anything they had ever seen.  Many said only the smells were missing.  The film included many sounds and rough language from combat, but had one feature not from the war:  its outstanding overlaid music sound track.  We all know of the heroism of our servicepersons in combat, but many don't fully appreciate the equal heroism of a handful of war zone journalistswho, I believe, die at a higher percentage than even the troops.  Viewers are gripped by the immediate drama of war, but this is also a multilayered film that can plumb motivations and meanings of war.  I served as a senior Army MD, but never in combat.

They pull no punches portraying the gut wrenching, life and death decisions our young soldiers and Marines make on a daily basis and about which few Americans understand or have even the slightest feeling for.  But, its more than a standard documentary -successfully depicting daily combat drama in an unvarnished way, with real dialog and unflinching truth, terror, and love that reduces combat to its most primal elements.

But this film is more than the ""What"" of authentic combat footage.  It shows young Americans as they are - strong, dedicated, fearless leaders who are part of something bigger than they are - fully engaged and consciously defending our country and its citizens - whether they want it or not.

Excellent film that should be required viewing for all Americans. A big thanks to the Boetchers for this film and the portrayal of our brothers.

Shawn Matthew (NO SLACK)
Did you know you the term Valor does not have its own definition in the dictionary? The dictionary defines Valor as the same thing as bravery and courage. However I disagree. Bravery is pretty common and could be just enlisting during a time of war. It takes a brave person to do something like that knowing they will likely face the enemy. Courage is when you get overseas, get to the front line of the fight, see the people that have been injured or killed and after confronted with the reality that you are at war, shout into the enemies valley, I come here representing America! Behind me lies freedom, and behind you lies desolation. Im going to find you and we are going to fight till one of us dies so the victors beliefs may spread Thats pretty courageous. However it is not Valor.

Valor is when you are actually pinned down in a firefight, and something happens, someone is hit, a vehicle is disabled, or another machine gun opens up and you realize you're flanked. A quiet moment hits you, where you realize something. That you have a duty to go out and help that person, move that vehicle, maneuver to shoot back but by doing your duty you are accepting that you are most likely going to die. The bullets are there and you know that your death or serious disability will be the result of going out in it. You are suddenly confronted with the serious definition of death. That death means your family will cry, youll never know what its like to see your kids grow up, youll get your name carved in a rock and no one outside your poor family, friends and brothers in arms will ever know. It won't even make the news that you were killed doing this. And then after that quiet moment when you realize all of this you go out into the haze of blood, bullets, and smoke having accepted your likely to be killed and hoping against hope you're not. That is Valor.

Being an infantryman, you live on the fringes of society as a barrier to the evils outside of it. Outside of rumors, society is mainly ignorant of many of the evils out there because you are there as a shield. When its cold you feel it while society is warm. When the outside world is dangerous you keep it from penetrating society. The end result of that is society can build in peace and children can grow up in innocence.

Because you are on the fringe of society, you are subject to its decisions though. Should society decide to move in a direction, you will be the first to absorb the repercussions of that decision. You will feel the heat of every fire, the slice of every blade, the impact of every hit while society stays safe behind your shield. And when a boil has been ignored and allowed to grow for too long and its existence puts society in danger, you will be the one to pay the price.

Time in the military made me learn a lot of definitions. Ive seen and learned the definitions of cowardice, dishonor, disrespect, lies, evil, ignorance, and horror. I know fear intimately. However Valor is the most important definition because it drives back all those terrible definitions and is the currency we military use to keep our society safe. We store it inside our veins and when confronted with the end result of societies decisions, in that quiet moment beforehand we reflect on our lives, everyone well miss, and how much we want to live before going and letting the valor flow out onto the ground of some foreign battlefield.

You cant find Valors definition in the dictionary. Very few have ever seen it in real life but I believe Mike, Carlos, David, and Christian captured it in this documentary. I believe they have captured the actual moments when the military exchanges Valor for societys safety. NFS",1410220800,73,3816,4.500721500721501
