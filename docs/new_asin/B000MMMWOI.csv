I laughed, I cried, I was on an emotional rollercoaster. I was captivated by an enthralling performance by the Sine Function and the chemistry he had with his co-star Square Root. I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie especially when they revealed the twist at the end. It is a crime against hollywood and cinema as a whole to not have see this movie, I just wished my local IMAX would screen it.",1488153600,,533,4.235294117647059
