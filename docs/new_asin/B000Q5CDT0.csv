8194108,1,B000Q5CDT0,"While backup male dancers knock themselves out behind her, LaToya ""sings"" her non-hits--it's questionable whether we really hear her here (save during a few truly off-key moments) or whether she's actually mouthing pre-recorded tracks. (There are also highly visible female backup vocalists here, and you wonder if they provided even the most rudimentary vocals here.) As dressed and made-up, LaToya looks like Michael in drag as Diana Ross. Poor backup folks, they're just trying to make a living while supporting someone with absolutely no talent but a marketable name. It's questionable whether the excited audience response here is real or just a matter of sound effects and/or paid studio audience.

Best line: ""This song is from my album...that I'm actually still working on."" Weirdest moment: When a white-robed apparent church choir joins her for ""Be My Lover"" on which Edgar Winter plays screeching sax. (She repeatedly calls him ""Edgar Winters."") This from a woman who claimed she was still a virgin when she later made her priceless 1994 ""Playboy Centerfold"" video, complete with a music video--set to somebody else's song--in which she writhes sexily through a dramatization of Papa Jackson's alleged molesting of her. (I don't doubt her accusation, given all Jackson family history, but her exploitation of it is pretty shameless and creepy.) There's a hilarious bit at the end in which she ""sings"" a Prince song (""1999"") while supposedly playing a guitar-shaped keyboard, but it's clear she isn't actually playing or (probably) even singing.

What you end up with is that, without the celebrity circus she'd grown up in and tried to milk in adulthood, LaToya Jackson is a natural stripper--and not much else, as entertainers go.",1369180800,,1742,5.240143369175628
