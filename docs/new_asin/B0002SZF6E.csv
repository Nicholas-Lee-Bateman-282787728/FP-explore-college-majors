8031458,2,B0002SZF6E,"Ants! 1977 film

A bulldozer destroys a shed. There is a cry for help! One construction worker is buried! A rich man talks about his plans for a gambling casino. But a nest of ants was uncovered. Where is that missing man? They try to dig him out. The death is mysterious. It is investigated as a possible case of criminal negligence by an official. A young boy is attacked by ants in a dumpster. The construction crew talks about filling the hole. What if this thing can attack others? The ants bite one worker, his leg is numb. [Why doesnt that cook notice the ants on the kitchen floor?] He is bitten and collapses! Outside a worker collects ants in a bottle. The health official blames a virus instead, then handles some ants. A worker used a front-loader to destroy that excavation. Could those ants have absorbed toxins from poisons? Ethel Adams calls that developer for a meeting.

Ants climb the wall of the building! They enter the bedroom where that young woman lies in bed. Ants attack a man, he collapses. That worker calls for help against the ants. How can they get a woman in a wheelchair out of the building? Can kerosene and a fire destroy the ants? There is a dramatic scene where a woman is trapped at the end of a long ladder.! Would burning down the hotel be a solution? The people are attacked, can a fire hose flush them off? Can others help? If you don't move the ants won't bite you says the health official. The people stand still. Men arrive to fumigate the room. Once the nest is scattered the ants lose their force. The woman says she will go to Florida. [Dont they have a greater insect population?]

This follows the typical horror story. A threat to the people is answered by a collective action that removes the threat in the end. Is this story believable to you? It could have been better. This was also named Panic at Lakewood Manor. Who believes a gambling casino in a rural area would be a success?",1517702400,,1935,4.445070422535212

8031460,2,B0002SZF6E,"It Happened at Lakewood Manor (Robert Scheerer, 1977)

Picture it. Pittsburgh, 1977. I was over at a friend's house doing something or another. As I was walking out the door to go home, his parents were watching TV. I saw just a scene. It traumatized me. We're talking nightmares for weeks. I had no idea what it was. Fast-forward twenty years later, to the glory of the Internet and its many film geeks. I describe the scene on a forum, and presto-- someone comes up with the name of this movie. I worship. Fast-forward another eleven years, to last night-- yes, it took me that long to get my hands on a copy-- when I watched it. I was once again traumatized, but for very, very different reasons.

Ecohorror schlockmeister Guerdon Trueblood (Candy Snatchers) wrote the screenplay for this Robert Scheerer (The World's Greatest Athlete)-directed dog about mutant ants menacing a resort. Ethel Adams (Myrna Loy) has been running it for decades, with a helping hand from daughter Valerie (Lynda Day George) since infirmity forced her into a wheelchair. A shady developer (Bernie Casey) and his gorgeous assistant (Suzanne Somers, who gets top billing despite having relatively little screen time) want to buy the resort so said developer can put up a big, glitzy lakeside casino. Meanwhile, a nearby construction project (whose overseer, Mike [Robert Foxworth], is having an affair with Valerie) has disturbed, yes, a vast nest of mutant ants. And boy, are those ants mad. When the Department of Health gets involved, things get all kinds of fun.

Oh, Guerdon Trueblood, how I love thee. How long did it take you to bang this script out, an hour? Less? It's quite nicely summed up by one of the characters, inserted into the movie just so the ants will have another target, who says breathlessly to her new boyfriend, ""and to think, this morning I didn't even know you."" (Later that morning, however, they knew one another very, very well. Ah, the swingin' seventies.) the characters are far too thin to be cardboard. Onionskin, perhaps. The plot is about as solid as an acid-eaten piece of PVC pipe. The music (the only score to which Ken Richmond's name was ever attached, at least according to IMDB) comes straight out of the adult film industry. Can say one good thing about it: the ant special effects are about a thousand times better than those of more recent killer-ant CGI-fests on the Sci-Fi Channel. (I assume that real ants were used for most of the shots; amusingly, whatever they used to get the ants where they wanted them was painted in swirls, and so you see meandering rivers of ants wandering down, say, a hotel corridor. I kept wondering why everyone was so scared of a six-inch-wide trail of ants working its way down a six-foot-wide hallway. Why not just step around them?)

This is, truly, an awful movie in every respect, but I have to admit-- the kid-in-the-dumpster scene that gave me such nightmares when I was nine years old? Yeah. That still creeped me right the hell out. **",1223596800,,3004,4.7711538461538465
