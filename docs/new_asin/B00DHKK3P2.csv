8593252,1,B00DHKK3P2,"I along with many others were afraid of clowns when children and could not tolerate this video. The production is also poor and does not hold up well in the current time. It appears it was made in the 80s and hasn't aged well at all. Scary clowns, bad acting, bad production overall. I don't recommend this at all.",1430179200,,314,4.338983050847458
