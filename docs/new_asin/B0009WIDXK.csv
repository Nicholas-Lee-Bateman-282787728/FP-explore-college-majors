8068397,3,B0009WIDXK,The music from Tchaikovsky was tremendous. The costumes and ballet were outstanding. It fit the time period. There was way too much applause in between ballet debuts and shouting and carrying on from the Soviet Apparatchiks during 1982. If this recording did not have all the applauding and the Soviet Party shouting it would have received a 5 from me.,1442361600,,352,4.883333333333334
8068398,5,B0009WIDXK,"LOVELY, magical rendition of a magical classic fairytale. SUPERB dancing w/all the spectacular things associated with Russian-style ballet. Lovely costuming. Timeless music. A must-have for any ballet lover!",1419897600,,207,6.428571428571429
8068399,4,B0009WIDXK,"This is an excellent production of the famous ballet, with beautiful costumes and clever scenery, as well as excellent dancers.  However, the ballet is three hours long, a bit long for my taste.  Some of the problem is due to several people in the audience demanding frequent bows from the dancers, which probably added a half hour to this production.  Without that interruption, the ballet would have been great!  And, perhaps the ballet is known to run long.",1366156800,,460,4.858974358974359
8068400,5,B0009WIDXK,"I bought this dvd to watch the Aurora of her time Irina Kolpakova. The last graduate of the Vaganova school of ballet. She still teaches even after her retirement,passing on all of her remarkable talent to others. She danced with Baryshnikov who said she taught him so much. She remains one of the great ballerinas of the Kirov. This Sleeping Beauty is one of only two complete ballets of her on film. The other being Raymonda. They both are worth owning. She is an absolute technician. She makes it look so easy. It seems she is floating on air when she dances. I just love seeing her dance. Even on the Ballet Favorites dvd in the clips. Don't pass this up. It is just great.",1332892800,,677,4.424
8068401,5,B0009WIDXK,"As a huge fan of Russian ballet, and The Sleeping Beauty in general, this DVD is the best full length Beauty we have available.  Until they wise up and film the current Kirov/Mariinsky reconstruction fot he original 1890 production (you can find a glorious performance of Act III on the DVD New Year's Eve in St Petersburg), this probably will remain the best filmed version despite worthy and interesting productions on DVD from the Royal Ballet nad the Bolshoi.

This is the production Konstantin Sergeyev premiered in 1953, and has remained in the repertoire of the Kirov/Marrinsky since then and is something of a classic in its own rights.  It's also, arguably but to my mind, the most faithful to the original Petipa choreography we have.  Yes Sergeyev replaced a lot of the mime and made some other changes (some of which, like the new male variations, are, while far from authentic, admirable additions), but we get the basic text of this ballet down to all of the charming wedding divertisements, most not performed in the West.

Kolpokova was nearing the end of her career when this was filmed in 1983, and I admit the idea of a 50 year old Aurora can be off putting--but the lady dances spectacularly and is a great and welcome presence.  Everyone else is in fine form--the men and the classic female corps of the Kirov in particular.

A must for any classic ballet lovers and Sleeping Beauty fans out there.",1231977600,14,1419,4.720647773279352
8068402,5,B0009WIDXK,"The ballerinas in this production by the Kirov are dazzling.  One wonders how one company can have so many dancers operating at such a high level of brilliance.  The set for Act 2 - enormous background paintings in fall colors - stands out in particular.  But it is the dancing of the Corps, along with the individual fairies and Aurora herself, that make the viewing of this DVD a reason to go on living.",1145145600,11,405,4.445945945945946
8068403,1,B0009WIDXK,"If you read between the lines of the Product Review, you should be forewarned enough not to buy this DVD. Irina Kolpakova may not have performed it in 1890, but she's no ""spring chicken"" here. She reminds me of Margot Fonteyn when she was way past her prime in Swan Lake with Rudolf Nureyev (on DVD, and also not the best). Neither had two feet off the ground at any time, although Fonteyn was vastly more graceful in her performance. The length of this performance (2:50) helps to make it unwatchable for any but those wanting to see it ""as performed in 1890"". Which leads to my main complaint. I have Swan Lake by the American Ballet Theatre and the Nutcracker by the Bolshoi (both 2005 editions), and the choreography and dancing skills are AWESOME - and even more so when compared to this production, which I suppose points out that these skills have improved over the years, especially when compared to a ballet company that seems to be stuck in 1890. I will say, though, that the Kirov did a good job with their Nutcracker (a 1994 edition, but danced in the '70's). The lighting in the second act made everything annoyingly pink, but otherwise not a bad production.",1140048000,18,1171,4.580952380952381
