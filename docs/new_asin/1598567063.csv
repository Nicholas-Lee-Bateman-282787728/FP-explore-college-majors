7800043,4,1598567063,"This Video Bible is really, really Wonderful and great for Bible study. Using it when friends are over is very fun.. It helps you to  pronounce words that other wise will be difficult to say... Very clear and comprehensive..",1374105600,,224,4.743589743589744
7800044,2,1598567063,"I was given a prompt refund by the company, which was great. I did not see anywhere it had music and sound effects, and the person I bought it for only ever likes speech alone for bible readings. The voice over did tend to get drowned out too much. They went to a lot of trouble to add those extras, but should mention the music etc, as not all like that. I felt the sound effects lacked subtlety and balance. There are also similitudes on the disc. Somehow the entire bible was on one disc, which was clever and handy. I was impressed with the polite, speedy refund.",1356566400,,567,4.2592592592592595
7800045,1,1598567063,"There is a picture of Jesus' Mother Mary as queen of heaven.  Not good.  Also many of the scriptures are mis-read. For example: ""Luke 11:8 KJV)  I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth.""  The word importunity is pronounced ""in-opportunity"".  Neither of them means the same as the other.  We purchase KJV BIBLE on dvd to give to teens, the elderly, the blind, or folks that are just struggling to read.  This DVD is not acceptable. Missed the deadline to return trying to listen to the whole thing, other than that I would have returned them.",1328140800,,660,4.404958677685951
