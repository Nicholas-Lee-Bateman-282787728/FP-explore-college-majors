8402454,5,B003QPUJNY,This was a good documentary about the Eastern Catholic churches. It was easy to understand and very informative about the different traditions in the Eastern Catholic churches vs the Western Roman Rite. As a protestant christian I found this easy to understand the differences between the two rites. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to know more about Eastern Catholic churches.,1297555200,,388,5.174603174603175
