8731076,4,B014KEPFIS,"PLOT: documentary/docudrama with interviews from Gordon Goody one of the original Great Train Robbers.

Gordon Goody in this video is living in Spain and is age 83. He is still alert and able to talk about his life. He starts with his family and adds on how his life as a thief started and continued including several stints in jail. There is a blond actor who is able to help recreate some of the details who impersonates a young Goody. Goody still recalls details of events and people's names surrounding the robbery.  What makes this ""unique"" is Goody talks about the ""Ulsterman"" the ""inside"" connection that gave them the ""inside scoop"" when the mail train left Glasgow. Goody talks about meeting some called the Ulsterman who he says was Irish. The Ulsterman is ID by Goody as Patrick McKenna from a label he on the outside of a glasses case he saw on one of their meetings when they planned the robbery details~  2 ""investigators"" search records looking for the name of Patrick McKenna was the name Goody gave them. The search includes police archived investigations and records in England and Ireland. The investigators explain how they researched and found the inside man they believe is the Ulsterman. Photographs of McKenna are given to Goody to identify if the researchers have the right man.  This is a good short 1 hour 9 minute film and it holds the interest. Goody seems to enjoy his interview and is both articulate for his age....and uses colorful language as he is certainly able to express himself about his past and how it affected his life in and out of Prison. I give this one 4 STARS~",1490486400,,1607,4.667844522968198
8731077,5,B014KEPFIS,I really enjoyed watching A Tale of Two Thieves.  It kept me engaged from start to finish and I was loving every minute of it.  I definitely recommend this to anyone you is considering it!  I plan on watching it several more times to come.,1449187200,,239,4.266666666666667
8731078,5,B014KEPFIS,"A truly riveting documentary. As a fan of documentaries both obscure and mainstream, I can say this one is now among my favorites. I find far too often with documentaries that they either tell a good story but aren't visually appealing, or are visually well-done but lack a great narrative. This is one of those documentaries that nails both the production value and the narrative. Can I give it more than five stars?",1449100800,,417,4.726027397260274
8731079,4,B014KEPFIS,"A Tale of Two Thieves takes the viewer back to 1963 in the picturesque English countryside, where a gang of 15 men pulled off the notorious Great Train Robbery, stealing todays equivalent of $60 million, most of which was never recovered. This documentary centers on Gordon Goody, one of the participants in the crime who, more than 50 years after the event, has finally agreed to go on the record and reveal all the unknown facts about the night of the robbery and his long life of crime. The films highlight is Goodys revelation of the identity of the missing mastermind behind Britains most famous heist  the elusive and mysterious Ulsterman, who walked away and disappeared with over 2.6 million pounds ($5 million).

Director Chris Long (The Mentalist, Gilmore Girls) delves deeply into the legendary crime on the Glasgow-to-London train, detailing how the robbery was pulled off with no firearms but through methodical planning and inside information. The heist has fascinated and baffled historians, criminologists, crime buffs and filmmakers for half a century.

Now 84, Goody currently lives in Spain. Hes a wry raconteur, revealing much of his personal life story as well as recollections of the robbery with charming directness, never sugarcoating what he did. He used violence, stole from innocent people, and enjoyed the material benefits of a life of crime. Rather than glorify the robbery, the documentary shows its reality in often unwavering, harsh detail. In reconstructed scenes, Harry Macqueen plays a younger version of Goody. Carefully assembled and edited archival material provides a sense of the period.

Since the documentary relies on the accounts of only one man  Goody  its not 100% clear whether they're accurate. However, it is the first time a participant in the robbery has come forward to fill in the unknowns that law enforcement couldn't crack. There are no bonus extras on this DVD release.",1446854400,2,1927,5.140575079872204
8731080,2,B014KEPFIS,"This film is not a recap of the events of the Great Train Robbery of 1963, which netted a gang of almost 20 robbers the equivalent today of very roughly 50 million U.S. dollars, little of which was ever recovered.

Rather, it is an interview with Gordon Goody, the original mastermind of the robbery, now 85 years old and apparently living in southern Spain off his share of the loot after having spent many years in prison. Goody talks for almost half of the film about his childhood and life events prior to the robbery, before getting into a fairly brief accounting of the robbery itself. He ends by naming the heretofore unidentified Irishman (aka the Ulsterman), who died some years ago but is believed to have been an employee of the postal service who gave Goody the necessary inside information on the mail trains procedures. This information inspired Goody to begin the detailed planning of the robbery.

If you don't know beforehand the details of the actual robbery or its aftermath this film may be difficult to follow at times, and won't reveal the intricacies of this complex caper or any of its secrets (except for the identity of the Irishman). If you want to know more about the robbery itself, check out Wikipedia for starters. Or watch The Great Train Robbery, a solid 2013 movie in two parts, one looking at the planning and execution of the robbery from the robbers viewpoint and the other examining police efforts to catch the thieves. That film is available at Netflix or Amazon Instant Video. There are many books available also that deal with this sensational crime.",1443484800,,1591,4.760869565217392
