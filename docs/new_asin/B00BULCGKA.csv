8574121,1,B00BULCGKA,"This was misrepresented.  Seeing as how it was from a company in Germany, I should have had a clue, I suppose,
It was somewhat amusing to see American Indians speaking German with English sub-titles.  But I will never watch this DVD again.  That said, an authentic ENGLISH audio version would be very worthwhile.

Like `Dances with Wolves', and rare other movies, it treats the Indian characters with respect, dignity, and authentic realism.

All the actors appear to be authentic Indians, even the lead with his large British beak played by Trevor Howard.  (Go figure this casting choice.)",1459382400,,590,5.030927835051546
