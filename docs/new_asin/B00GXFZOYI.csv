6123585,5,B00GXFZOYI,"I was first reluctant to watch this movie since I wasn't sure how Yu Xing would perform since I've seen him in some of Donnie Yen and Stephen Chow's films but, he does a fantastic job. Also the main villian Sung-jun Yoo did a awesome job as well. Overall if you want a good film with awesome fight scenes, check this one out.",1396828800,7,325,4.174603174603175
6123586,5,B00GXFZOYI,"Glad I bought this movie. It had great acting, super fight scenes and a simple, but interesting plot. years before, kids for all over the world were taken and trained to be killers. Those kids were saved and kiddie kidnapping was put on hold.....until now. So former napped kids (all grown up now) come together from different directions in different ways, to be saved, to save or help save new batch of kidnapped kids. There is more story to it that this. the location was lovely and i like how actors from other countries fit in to make it more believable. It was fun and entertaining.",1396396800,7,587,4.547169811320755
6123587,4,B00GXFZOYI,"Well Go USA is quickly becoming the undisputed leader in martial-arts and import films.  Almost every one of their titles I have reviewed, I have liked.  Todays film, THE WRATH OF VAJRA, continues this tradition.  In addition to excellent production quality, this film is riveting in its intensity and contains some downright awesome fight sequences.

I like the concept of kidnapping your enemys children and training them to be assassins for you.  Its dark and evil, a deeply disturbing idea that only a cunning genius could conceive.  Im not sure if this film is based on fact, but I would be very interested to find out.

THE WRATH OF VAJRA is shot very well and looks great onscreen.  I believe they used a RED camera to film it, therefore the fight scenes in the rain look stunning.  The rest of the production value is high, and the result is a very enjoyable movie experience.

The acting is pretty good, but the sole performance I did not enjoy is that of the child who portrays Little Brother (I cannot find the actors name for some reason).  He spends most of the movie crying, which is understandable given the situation, but his tears get annoying very quickly.  I found myself grimacing whenever he came onscreen.

But thankfully, the story and the action in THE WRATH OF VAJRA make up for that minor annoyance.  The drama behind the story helps fan the flames of the action sequences when they heat up, and theres plenty of them.  I love the fighting in this film, and I look forward to seeing more of the lead actors (Xing Yu and Steve Yoo) in future films.

I greatly enjoyed THE WRATH OF VAJRA, and I suggest you give it a look if you're looking for high-speed martial-arts action.  Be sure and check it out on Blu-ray in order to get the full HD experience; you won't regret it.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1396396800,5,1849,4.5347432024169185

6123591,4,B00GXFZOYI,"I only happened to see this because there was a showing at our local Alamo, but boy am I glad we took a chance, because it was just plain awesome.

There were annoyances and some sub-par moments-- my husband disliked the main child actor, and neither of us thought much of the so-so main actress, who did little with the tiny amount of material she was given. But the fights, i.e. the main course of a movie like this, were simply breathtaking. There wasn't a lot of gore, but the way the fight scenes were shot and acted often made me flinch while keeping me on the edge of my seat. The second big fight was particularly gripping, and the final battle was just perfect.

I rate this movie at four stars because I know it wasn't perfect, and I think certain things may grate on me in the inevitable rewatch. But it's a glorious, well-deserved four stars, and I don't think anyone who's into action movies or martial arts movies will regret a minute of this.",1395187200,13,957,4.401129943502825
6123592,4,B00GXFZOYI,"This is a basic martial arts fight film with an unorthodox background that we have to read at the opening. Japan created a Hades death cult. They would kidnap/buy children from around the world and train them to fight. The object was to spread the spirit of Hades through fighting, killing the spirit of their enemy, in this case China.

The group was disbanded and then ordered to rebuild after 12 years because China was tough to conquer. They managed to gather together. There is a female journalist (Yamei Zhang) who covers them and gives us a speech on integrity in reporting. There is a group of Allied POWs captured in Burma, who employ some American actors. We quickly discover three of the prisoners were former cult members.

Our main protagonist is former member K-29 (Yu Xing) who became a Sholin Buddhist, a habitual good guy in Chinese films. He is there to save everyone but must compete in three lengthy formulaic slo-mo/ fast speed fights. My favorite was the one against Crazy Monkey (Heon Jun Nam) who looked like he escaped from a ""Juon"" film.

The final fight is depicted on the cover. Like ""Kill Bill"" there is a move called the ""seventeen seconds of death."" Did K-29 master it? When will he possibly use it if he did? Okay, this wasn't a mystery, but the film has some minor twists.

 Vajra is associated with the diamond and thunderbolts. It is powerful, hard, and indestructible.

The film is four stars on the Chinese martial arts scale.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Plenty of violence with several bloody scenes. Faces being hit in slow motion, showing the skin flowing. No silly anti-gravity fighting.",1394841600,11,1629,4.734982332155477

6123604,3,B00GXFZOYI,"This movie is terrible but it does have some epic fight choreography and great slow-motion punch shots.  It takes itself far too seriously and tries to be more epic than it is.  I will give the filmmakers credit for creating some fantastic fight sequences (even though in a few scenes you see punches pulled or even completely missing the mark).  You never really get behind any of the characters so you never really care what happens to them.  The weird thing is, two key characters from the beginning of the film are never seen after their brief introductions so you are left hanging at the end.  Bizarre.  Acting is terrible, dialogue is cheesy and the entire plot is contrived.  Good fight scenes though so worth a few bucks to pick up and add to your Kung Fu movie collection.  Will I watch it again?  Probably not.",1451174400,,820,4.561643835616438

Some of the close-up shots, such as punches to the face and the jaws, looks full contact. Plot is good too, with basically good versus evil, and at the end the good won. Because the movie is in blu ray high definition, everything is so crisp and clear, even seeing raindrops slowly falling. I personally like it very much, in fact, I watched it twice already. Very much enjoying the fighting scenes. For anyone who loves kung fu, this is a must have collection.",1423440000,,552,4.53

The fighting is intense, and the cinematography is exquisite. The only sore point in this movie is the acting by anyone that isn't Asian. The Caucasian and African actors were HORRENDOUS, and really bring the quality of this movie down. If you ignore them, and stick to the meat and potatoes of this film (namely Yoo Seung-Jun, who is perfectly cast), you will enjoy this film immensely.",1412812800,,519,4.714285714285714

6123640,3,B00GXFZOYI,"I really wish there was a half star rating available because this film is more than 3 star material and not quite 4 star quality. And it comes so damn close. Well choreographed fight scenes, certainly not lacking for skill, timing, or speed, but some parts I found a little lacking for that visceral impact of more modern martial arts films like Ong Back, Fist of Legend, or even Enter the Dragon. It's obvious that whoever was behind this film had ambition and some great ideas, but some of the pacing between the fight scenes just isn't quite up to par for my tastes.

I would treat this film like a prototype of sorts. There's clearly some great potential here from the director, the cast, and the fighters. They just need to finesse that last little bit to make some excellent stuff. If you're a casual fan of martial arts films, maybe look elsewhere for your fight scene thrills. If you're more of an esoteric, hardcore, or deep cut kind of martial arts fan, then pick this film up on your next binge purchase.",1410048000,,1015,4.516304347826087

The typical good vs evil plot with several twists... problem is, the original idea of a bunch of children raised to be assassins to help Japan take over China could have gone so many different ways. The two main characters, one bad who continues to stay on the evil road, one good who has become a Sakhalin monk... So many options!  But instead they chose the obvious one of repeating history by kidnapping more kids,so the monk has to fight his way in a nonsense competition to free them.

The plot was a little confusing at first, there were many characters introduced in the first 15 minutes, but things picked up nicely and there was a fairly good plot twist that I did not see coming involving one of the minor characters.  The fight scenes in the film were excellent, Xing Yu demonstrates some excellent Shaolin kung fu (he's a monk in real life of course too, so he would be that good).  I was familiar with the lead actor, Xing Yu, from his parts in other movies like Donnie Yen's Flashpoint and the recent movie titled ""Shaolin"" and his small part in ""Bodyguards and Assassins.""  After seeing a movie like this, which really got to showcase his skills, I think he definitely deserves more lead roles, and look forward to seeing him in action more in the future.

8628372,5,B00GXFZOYI,Incredible fight scenes throughout!!! Quick shipping. I read reviews and I don't know what some people are complaining about. I guess if you watch it english dubbed it does give the slight impression that the 'foreign' actors in the film may be lacking in the acting department but to me - not really. I'm a fight scene junky and this flick totally satisfied my fix.,1499299200,,366,4.6461538461538465
8628373,2,B00GXFZOYI,"Ridiculous plot, bad acting, bad direction and bad camera work - this movie has it all. The storyline is absurd from start to finish, and is full of inconsistencies - suspension of disbelief requires an industrial crane. The cheesy camera work is all over the place and is used to mask much of the truly lame fight choreography. The one-on-one fight scenes are barely passable as entertainment - that's where it gets the 2 stars.

I'll take a random Shaw Brothers movie over this any day.

This should have been titled ""The Facepalm of Vajra"".",1496016000,,543,4.705263157894737
