When I first viewed the DVDs by Little GuruSkool, I was amazed at the natural assimilation of Indian culture into every aspect of the film. Children are taught names of animals and colors with use of video clips and talking puppets. The choice of music in the DVDs is a great way to introduce Indian sounds to the children. I now use these DVDs with every child that I teach and it has been an asset to my teaching methods. Many parents I know own these DVDs and I personally recommend them to anyone that would like to introduce Hindi and Indian culture in their child's life.",1263859200,,735,4.411764705882353

I love the illustrations too! I have given the DVDs as presents to a number of friends and cousins in the UK and the US who want their children to grown up with an appreciation of their Indian roots.",1263859200,,369,4.285714285714286
