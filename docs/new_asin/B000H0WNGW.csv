You really become connected to each character and feel like you know them.

I would love to see a Jupiter Landing 2! Heck, let's make it a series!

Great work!",1165449600,,229,4.159090909090909
8135779,4,B000H0WNGW,Jupiter Landing is so much fun.  The characters are unique and the plot has great twists and turns.  We have watched this movie four times and each time we have found fun things that we missed the first time around.  There are some laugh-out-loud moments. I wouln't be surprised if this movie  ends up with a cult following.  It is truly quirky.,1164326400,,345,4.5
8135780,4,B000H0WNGW,"This small budget movie has a lot going for it.  The actors are great, the plot is unique and the characters are so quirky you can't help but enjoy them.

My only complaint would be that I wished they had made it a little longer so the plot and character development would have reached the level necessary to make this a 5 star, off-the-wall, laugh out loud jaunt.  Not bad for a first effort.  I'd like to see these characters again with a better chance of showing their talent.

I'd recommend this movie highly.  It's better than a lot of the Hollywood movies I've seen lately.  I did have to watch it twice to catch all the laughs as the sound was sometimes a bit uneven.  Overall, a definite 4+!!",1160179200,,700,4.3307692307692305
8135781,4,B000H0WNGW,"Jupiter Landing's characters are built up very well and you think you know them. Then the clever plot thickens and perception gets tangled -- you are not sure who is telling the truth or who is the villian. Many very funny moments in between the dark ones. Sexy cast of characters, believable and nicely portrayed. Very unexpected twisted ending. See if you can guess what the movie poster portrays before watching it.",1156377600,3,418,4.819444444444445
