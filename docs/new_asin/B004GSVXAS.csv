4373778,5,B004GSVXAS,"All four movies are on one disk.  We haven't watched all four movies, but the picture quality is very good and the price is more than reasonable.",1345593600,,145,4.37037037037037
4373779,5,B004GSVXAS,"Worth noting: the packaging incorrectly lists Ghost Dad as being full frame, with the others as anamorphic widescreen.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that in fact all four movies are presented in anamorphic widescreen.  Note to Universal: You might want to correct your packaging if you ever do another pressing of these.

What makes this particularly interesting is that as far as I can tell, this is the first time this movie has ever appeared in widescreen format.  All previous DVD releases were 4:3.",1340582400,10,509,4.952941176470588
4373780,5,B004GSVXAS,"Pure luck is one of the best and unsual comedys that has come out in years. Different and worth making a night of entertainment with the junk food or should I say popcorn. Danny and Martin make the most of the situation that could only end up in chaos. Great performances from the cast and the comedy couldn't be better the storyline is marvellous. Fantastic movie I've given it an A grade rating and I'll leave you in suspense as not to spoil your show for the night. Watch for yourself as you might get a susprise, amusing, exciting, never a dull moment, sit back and enjoy.",1340150400,7,576,4.392523364485982
4373781,5,B004GSVXAS,I have looked everywhere for the one movie on this 4 movie disk so was really happy to get it. It came quickly and when it was promissed Thank you,1335225600,8,146,3.9
4373782,5,B004GSVXAS,I bought this even though I already own King Ralph and Ghost Dad. Wow I really own both those movies? Damn. Anyways I badly wanted pure luck on DVD and didn't want to buy that disc on demand BS copy available. Even after owning two of the four films here this is still a really good deal. It even has that amish movie I've seen clips of with Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley on tbs a thousand times. Maybe I'll actually watch the whole thing. Pure Luck gets the five stars on this one though.,1333411200,11,487,4.136842105263158
4373783,5,B004GSVXAS,"Honesty, I bought this entire DVD set for Pure Luck.  Pure Luck is one of my favorite Martin Short Movies (along with Captain Ron and Prince Charming).  As far as I can tell, this is the first time Pure Luck has been on DVD that wasn't an ""Amazon Exclusive"".  Pure Luck is hilarious and if you haven't see it yet, I would highly recommend it.  The Video Quality was 9, Audio was 9, and had subtitles.  The set comes on two dual layer one-sided DVDS with King Ralph and Pure Luck on one DVD and Ghost Dad and For Richer for poorer on the other DVD.  The DVD label is marked March 2010 so this a very recent release (as of 19 March 2012).

King Ralph is an excellent movie, highly recommend.  John Goodman becomes king of Great Britain and hilarity assumes.

Ghost Dad is funny.  Bill Cosby is in a car accident and his ghost is thrown out of his body (apparently, it is genetic because his daughter and his dad can do the same things).

I have not seen ""For Richer for Poorer"" yet so I can't really comment.",1332115200,2,1006,4.214659685863874
4373784,5,B004GSVXAS,"I love all 4 of these movies and when looking to add a few to my collection I ran across this 4 pack. I tend to be cautious with multiple-movie packs because double-sided discs tend to scratch very easily. With this set there are no worries! This set contains 2 discs, each 1 - sided. Disc 1 has ""Pure Luck"" and ""King Ralph"" and Disc 2 contains ""Ghost Dad"" and ""For Richer or Poorer"". Squeezing 2 movies onto 1 side of a disc causes some concern for quality but there is no issue here. These movies play great and the quality matches it! As a new release I Pre-Ordered it and I'm just glad I ran across this before I bought these singly. Enjoy your new movies, I know I do. :)",1331942400,39,676,4.128787878787879

4373884,5,B004GSVXAS,Pure Luck is an incredible comedy with great performances by Martin Short and Danny Glover. It is a riotous mix of comedy and friendship. King Ralph is a humorous look at American lack of social skills and England's rigid social rules. Ghost Dad with Bill Cosby is a funny look at a dad who dies but stays as a ghost because his kids need him. For Richer or Poorer is two people who hide out in Amish country and learn to care for each other all over again without the trappings of wealth.,1436486400,,489,4.268817204301075
4373885,5,B004GSVXAS,"""Pure Luck"" is a favorite of mine. I purchased this set because ""Pure Luck"" is $20.00 by itself. There are two discs in the case, two movies on each disc, single side.",1435536000,,167,4.25

Funny, you never hear about it, but is definitely worth watching.  ""King Ralph"" is just fun.  And ""Ghost Dad"" was kinda' the era of squeezing liberal politics into every movie....but the movie's okay.  Won't watch it again.

nothing works. King Ralph is so great about a fish out of water, who must adopt but not at the expense of losing one self dignity. and Richer or Poorer , is another fish out of water movie. I get a chuckle every time I watch them. And you save money too",1425513600,,547,4.055555555555555

The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is a comedic throw back to the golden age of animation, blended with live action. Josie and the Pussycats, also based on animation from back in the day, speaks to the rebel in all of us while being set to a rocking soundtrack. Mchale's Navy, based on the classic tv show, is filled with hilarity and military mischief. Thunderbirds, also based on the show of the same name, has enough action and adventure to keep the whole family entertained. All this, and at a great price too.",1396915200,3,607,4.577981651376147

Not sure.  There is no menu for subtitles / closed-captions.  The sound levels were inconsistent throughout the movie, made worse for me by the lack on captioning.  Very good picture quality.  No skips or stalls.  Good value.",1389484800,,393,4.6911764705882355
