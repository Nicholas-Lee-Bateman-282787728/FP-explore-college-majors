7980436,5,B00008978G,Amber Smith is as hot as a firecracker in this film! The movie is kind of boring but still erotic to watch with especially with the love scenes with the lesbian and the cop!,1430265600,,173,4.117647058823529
7980437,3,B00008978G,"This movie was actually a pretty good B Movie.  Worth the used price, not the new price.  There were some funny scenes by the writers, in an otherwise serious police drama.  I disagree that the lead actor was not good in this film. His interview with the druggies was hilarious, as well as the confrontation with the dog walker! I bought this for Gigi Erneta after seeing her in The Cheerleader Massacre and hearing the Commentary for that film (billed in this film under a different name in the film credits).  She was very good and received the benefit of some good writing as well. It got a little confusing towards the end, but overall, not bad. This film would probably sell better if Amber Smith was listed as the main actress in the description (I could not see her name on the cover of the DVD until it was enlarged and there is otherwise no mention that she is even in the movie, in the description.) She is the main character. She did a pretty good acting job, and is stunningly beautiful, and yes, she does get naked several times, including a scene with Gigi Erneta in the pool!  Nuff said.",1310601600,,1102,4.435643564356436
7980438,1,B00008978G,"This movie I found just kept going on and on. Also, I think they should re-cast their actors/actresses. Once I almost found my self falling asleep, this movie is not for children. But its not for adults either because this movie is TERRIBLE! Though, if you really like crime you might want to watch this movie",1050019200,3,309,4.535714285714286
