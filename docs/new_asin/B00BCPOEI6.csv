5579168,5,B00BCPOEI6,this series is over due for season 3 but season 1 and 2 are still amazing and i got it early,1370131200,,92,3.4285714285714284

It comes in a fat Blu-ray spec case that holds all nine discs with an outer sleeve.",1369872000,6,335,3.869565217391304

5579172,5,B00BCPOEI6,"What a wonderful show. The quality was amazing and the audio was just as great. This collection has 9 discs which I think is a lot of bang for my buck in my opinion.

This is a great buy for anybody who likes this series, and now it's just a waiting game for season 3 to hit stores!",1367884800,6,291,4.12280701754386
5579174,4,B00BCPOEI6,"I bought both seasons separately. I could have saved some money if i waited. If you have Netflix, watch the first season. If you are not hooked by the end, then skip this show, but i was hooked. I have not even watched the second season yet. I plan on it, though.",1367625600,23,263,4.076923076923077
5579175,4,B00BCPOEI6,"Ecchi is abundant in this anime but I have come to expect it in a fighting anime where the girls are mainly the fighters. Putting that aside the series is really enjoyable. The main character isn't as dense as most main characters in the harem genre but still lacks like most main males in this genre. Our Main Character Minato has an unlikely encounter with one of our main females Musubi. A few dozen cheeseburgers later Minato ends up ""winging"" musubi and becoming her ashakabi. Now its musubi's job to make sure she protects and wins battles for her ashakabi so he can ascend and win the sekirei plan. Along the way Minato attracts more sekirei and wings them as well. Without him knowing he becomes the ashikabi of the north. And if you want to know more you should buy the series. I am terrible at explaing things but that is just a little of what happens. This is a decent combo at a really good price. Best buy sells these at $50 a season where I live.",1362528000,4,960,4.368715083798882
5579176,5,B00BCPOEI6,"At last the first two seasons of the most enjoyable beauty bashing series is in one full collection.  Minato is the most luckless man in the world, until the most lovely girl comes crashing out of the sky.  She is cute, she is busty, and she can break stone walls with a single punch.  Musibi is a fist type sekerei and she has taken the normal man and made him her master.  But Minato can not rest on being happy with one lovely young lady - five others also choose him to turn on their special powers and together prepare to fight to the end of the Sekirei project and the one wish that the Sekirei and master get to have when they win.

This is the first two seasons, and despite the high Ecchi level has a great story, a lot of action and humor, and a few heart wrenching moments.  I already have seen both season three times and it never get old.  Now with the end of season two, there has to be a season three as we need to know who will finally win the whole thing.  Watch it for the first time if you are new, or if you wore out season one or two get it to replace the old disks, but join me as we anxiously await the next thrilling story that is Sekirei",1361491200,57,1162,4.0

5579212,5,B00BCPOEI6,"Sekirei is an Anime and Manga series that will entertain over and over again. I've owned this Anime for several years and can still watch it from beginning to end. This is one of those worlds you can escape into and experience the coming together of strangers who form close friendships and love for one another (Bonds) while trying to live a normal daily life and also contend with the challenges of The Sekirei Plan.
The Sekirei Anime series was produced from July 2, 2008 to September 26, 2010. It includes 25 episodes and 2 OVA which were adapted from the Sekirei Manga&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sekirei-Vol-1/dp/B017I271A4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sekirei, Vol. 1</a>&nbsp;chapters 1-73 (Volume 1-8) and chapters 98-107 (Volume 11).
Anime fans are aware that Anime producers don't strictly adhere to the Manga's storyline so if you've seen the Sekirei Anime then you'll find surprises in the Sekirei Manga and visa versa. In addition to that, there are several sub-stories in the Manga that didn't make it into the Anime series. It seems the Sekirei Manga's publication (18 Volumes) couldn't keep up with the pace of the Sekirei Anime's production and so the Anime studio probably had to move on to produce other Anime series instead. Now that the Sekirei Manga is complete it would be nice to see another season or two of the remaining Sekirei saga produced to bring the Anime series to a conclusion.",1488672000,5,1457,5.257510729613734

I'm really sad that they never made a third season of the anime, and that they didn't make a translated version of the manga. I found the key ideas of this interesting and beautiful. It very much explores the concept of love and relationships, and it isn't afraid to hold back on the idea that not all relationships are good. I'd recommend this to anime fans.",1476403200,,489,4.444444444444445
5579233,5,B00BCPOEI6,Both Season one and two of Sekirei have a great plot and story and including amazing characters. The English dub and Japanese voice actors both did an amazing job voicing characters in this anime as I was watching it I liked it even more the story gets better after the first few beginning episodes. Is a must have if you like watching action/fighting anime and some comedy. I wish we get a season 3 soon because it has been a long time since the two seasons released and I really would like to see more of the story. Overall I recommend this if you have not watch this yet.,1473465600,,574,4.275229357798165
5579234,5,B00BCPOEI6,No season 3 so no end to the story. I love this story. All the characters are likable and it's sad when they die. You end up rooting for them all. Season 2 which is included in this set ends on a cliffhanger. the story is half way maybe. I can't believe they have no plan to finish.,1472688000,,282,3.8793103448275863

That being said this is one of my favorite anime's, Alexis Tipton is great as Musubi! And there are many other great characters as well. Also, the Blu-Ray disks DO NOT have working subtitles as advertised, so if you like Japanese voice acting do NOT count on watching it in HD! I tried it on 3 different players and no subtitle options at all. The subtitles do work on the dvd's but that kind of defeats the purpose of buying the combo pack. I exchanged my first set and the replacement set came in even WORSE shape than the first one and the subtitles on the Blu-Ray disks still don't work!!! Be advised!!!

5579272,4,B00BCPOEI6,"Harem/Icche, Fighting, and huge bouncing breasts.... what's not to love...
Minato believes he is ""Nobody special"" and a failure, so when a beautiful young girl, Musubi, falls out of the sky and lands on top of him...Literally..... he gets dragged into a game called the Sekirei Plan. A plot by an organization called MBI that forces all 108 Sekirei to fight to the death for the ultimate prize. In order for these Sekirei to reach their full potential they must seek out and find the one human who can unlock their inner power with a kiss. These Ashikabi, as they are called, then become the masters of their Sekirei. When other Sekirei gravitate to the kind hearted Minato, tempers and feelings flare as the girls vie for Minato's affection. Cat fights and jealousy land everyone in hilarious situations, and gets them all in trouble with the ""Landlady"". As allies and enemies gather for the final battle, can Minato and his harem of Sekirei survive the game before they kill each other first....... Watch and see..
Personally, I love this Anime. The fan service is great, but the underlying story, while kind of generic, was still well told. The story progresses at a good pace and doesn't sit still for long periods. It has a few good plot twists, some really hilarious moments, and some tragic ones as well that tug on your heart strings a little. All in all an excellent representation of genre and well worth the watch",1454112000,4,1424,4.72289156626506

5579292,5,B00BCPOEI6,"complete series; purchased another Pure Engagement set for same price; wish I had spotted this first.

I have a freely downloaded subbed version off the internet; similar story BUT the English dub's exact language varies a lot from that sub's.  I do not have great hearing but those dubbed voices seem like season 1 and their sentence structure sounds correct; unlike other anime dubs and subs where some non-native English speaker is talking and mixing up sentence structure; saying wrong words, like them instead of then and vice versa.  Those subbed versions abound in these errors, not this version (I have not read this subbed  version, just listened to the voice version). After several years of viewing  that poor subbed version this is refreshing.  This
apparently  BRAND NEW sealed set was a good buy making viewing PE a pleasure, not a chore. Some shows, both anime and live, will show different scenes on full release vs regular general audience release... that is the case here: many fan-service scenes are redone and thru out the video the dialogue is changed here and there.  The story is the same just some of it is different/better.

Another issue, never discussed but seen clearly here and even in the OVA's, is the committee decided single teat size and shape: all the Sekirei's have a wide genetic variations: blonds with blue eyes, red heads, brunet and black haired girls of various heights and builds; even some dark and tan skinned ones in the mix.  One scene shows 3 girls nude in the bath WHILE their breasts are very slightly different sizes their teats all appear identical: same size, shape and color; as if some committee decided that one teat shape was all their animators should use; too hard to draw special ones for each girl (not likely - they all have individual costumes, faces, hair and height)??  This issue is present in many R/X-rated anime where many girls are topless.  Just my own idiosyncrasy and want for realism.

  Be aware PE Disk 3  is really disk 0 and that OVA's time line is between Season-1 and PE-1; I suggest  first viewing it right after Season 1 to keep the context straight.

This OVA is the same as another version which I had purchased thinking it was just the first season alone; that ""Complete"" one also has 2 ""OVA""s including the one in this version; some OVA's are left out episodes from the regular season; not with Sekirei it appears each season has it's own unique OVA and PE has it's designated fan-service OVA.

  Blue-Ray versions are fewer disks BUT have higher resolution shows which really fill the screen which is wasted since anime artwork  doesn't have more details like regular photography in actor movies.  Still this is a good version and reflects the good storyline and rendering from  season 1.",1440460800,36,2775,4.793684210526316

5579305,5,B00BCPOEI6,"This review will consist of 2 things: What the product contains and What I think of the product.
First off this product is both the 1st and 2nd seasons of the Sekirei Anime Series. The title of the 1st being ""Sekirei"" and the 2nd being ""Sekirei: Pure Engagement"".
Second The product looks exactly how it does in the picture though it is thicker than the average blu ray casing it is still the same height and has a slip cover.
Next This Product features a total of 9 discs. 4 of which are the blu rays and the other 5 are the dvd versions.
The 1st season contains extras on the disc with the last episode. The second season contains both extras and the OVA on the disc with the last episode.
This product comes with an English Dub as well as the original Japanese with English Subs.

This anime series was really great! If your looking for a Action/Comedy story about cute girls with superpowers then this is a great choice for you! Also if you like a little bit of ecchi, harem and romance in your anime, this definitely will be good for you as well!
This product overall is great I love this show and having a physical copy is the best.",1438819200,2,1138,4.293023255813954

5579319,5,B00BCPOEI6,"I was glad I was able to get this set on bluray for the price I did. I loved the stories, and bluray is the way to go if you can. Price wise this set is hard to beat, you get both seasons in 1 set. This anime series does have a lot of fan service, but the that's ok its not to obscene.

All in all this anime is about a guy, who meets a girl... Who the girl becomes the guys fighter(sekirei), for some strange competition fight thing. The story is good, the action is good, and comedy great. If your not sure you'd like the series I'd suggest watching at least the 1st season before buying this set. The only way to become someone's sekirei is to kiss them, so there is some drama for that specially the blonde hair one that has the power of water I believe it was, who basically don't want to kiss anyone. And then you have other sekirei that just want normal lives and don't want in on this competition and either are forced to fight, die, or try to escape. Bad day to be a sekirei if your not willing or strong enough to fight.

For bluray quality audio and sound this 2 season feature is priced way to great.",1430524800,,1112,4.05

Not only that Minato Sahashi managed to have one girlfriend in Musubi, but he also have five more,although that one of them is a male. The boy is really something else as Minato not only he utterly cares and love his sekireis,but he also willing to protect them. Everyone loved him.

TL:DR
This is well worth the $60 full price let alone the $30 it's been at for awhile now. It might be to much for some (a lot of breasts) but the story is amazing.

I still get tired of the wimpy males that are pictured as the hero's however he does come through enough to allow the females to kick butt and take names. This one has a lot of boobs showing so if you are going to watch with kids around be forewarned. Otherwise there is no sex, just a lot of action, fun interpersonal competition as well as a scary landlady who is perhaps the most powerful Sekirei there is.",1412035200,,536,4.37

5579373,4,B00BCPOEI6,"First things first, this anime has a lot of fanservice with partial nudity, if that's not your cup of tea then keep searching. But this isn't just a random titty fest. It has a good plot with lots of humor and lovable characters with great character design, the only thing its missing is an ending. The last episode was clearly written with a third and possibly even fourth season in mind but five and a half years later and still nothing, which is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. The story is based on a manga series which has at least another seasons worth of story as well as a real ending but all I can find is the japanese  version. If anyone knows where I can find the english release of this manga please let me know because I would love to know how the story ends but I'm not holding my breath for season 3 of the anime.",1404777600,9,844,4.115151515151515

Well worth the buy.",1402012800,,205,5.181818181818182
5579378,5,B00BCPOEI6,"Yes, this set contains all of season 1 and all of season 2 on both bluray and dvd. It also has a disc of features (mostly trailers) and the OVA for season 2. Season 1 did not have any bonus content. The box it comes in has some great art and is well put together.

As for the rating, it is a bit raunchy with lots of nudity throughout, especially so in the beginning. The fan service and nudity later in the series is mostly warranted, but in the beginning they are just trying to get your attention.

The characters and plot was highly interesting. A lot happens in each episode. I felt it moved very fast and did not stay in the same place for long. The character development was great. I fell in love with the main Sekirei's and could feel their passion at times.

The action was also great. I love the fight scenes. Most characters have supernatural powers so the fights are not close combat and usually do not last long. I would prefer some more detailed and close-up fighting similar to Tenjou Tenge or Elfen Lied, but it was still very enjoyable.

I cannot wait for more in this series. And look forward to finding more similar anime titles. (suggestions?)",1401667200,,1163,4.395348837209302

This anime is a lot of fun to watch the only bad thing.... no third season and no plans for one either.  I recommend this for any one probably 13 yrs and up.  With parental permission if your going to let your kids watch this that's cool but I would watch an episode or 2 first I let my kids watch it with me its mainly T & A no lower frontal no male frontal you know usual fan service.

It has a fun and interesting story and in my opinion an all star voice cast both English and Japanese. The character dynamics and the overall parody style harem soap opera esque humor is pretty classic and even original in it's own way. I couldn't give it five stars because it does land in a somewhat stereotypical place in it's genre with a cheesy art style... Even so, it's full of goodies and the boobs are really nice!

I was waiting for it come out out for season 1 & 2. Love the slip cover and everything.

The story is Good, Just watch it. definitely recommendable.

5579403,5,B00BCPOEI6,"I originally saw this series on Netflix and I enjoyed it right away. The plot, characters, originality, ecchi humor, chemistry, music and anxiety for future episodes are all blended well together.

This anime was based on a manga with the same name. ""Sekirei"" literally means ""Wagtail,"" a species of bird (look it up). The anime follows the manga rather well, even though it's not a complete replica. If you've read the manga, you should definitely watch the anime (and vice versa).

This Blu-ray/DVD combo is definitely worth the money. You have all the episodes from both seasons, along with commentaries from the Funimation voice actors, trailers and OVAs.

Personally, I have always preferred the subbed version over the dubbed version. For me, it's hard to take the dubbed version seriously when you hear some corny dialogue. Still, it's worth seeing at least once.

According to the commentaries, Season 3 has been announced but no one knows for sure when/if that's going to happen. Pure Engagement was made in 2010 and the manga is still ongoing. Perhaps they're waiting for the manga to finish so they can make season three the final season. Only time will tell...",1387584000,17,1172,4.964285714285714

5579407,5,B00BCPOEI6,"This is still my favorite and in my opinion the best fan service anime.  All the characters are memorable and have unique personalities.  A lot of the new fan service animes are too similar taking place at a high school or academy and have forgettable characters.  Others like Queen's Blade can push the envelope too much at times where even I roll my eyes a little.  Not saying Queen's Blade is bad, but I wouldn't watch it with people that aren't regular anime watchers.  I have shown Sekirei to numerous non anime or lite anime watchers, several girls, and they loved it even with the fan service  The story isn't bad, not ground breaking, but good enough to make you keep watching.  The characters are all memorable and the fight scenes are really good.  I have been trying to find another fan service anime as good as this and simply cannot.  The closest I have found is Freezing.

5579414,5,B00BCPOEI6,"I really enjoyed this series.  This set contains seasons 1 and 2, DVD and Bluray formats.  I'm personally hate the waste of dvd packaged with Blu, I just want the blu, not the other.  Throw in a bag of flammin' hot funions or something instead.  Ugh!  Now I'm hungry...

The animation is beautiful, the voice acting is good (english).  The story is cool and the vast cast is pretty sweet, too.  I also found it to be pretty humorous.  This series has a lot of fan service, but I'm starting to enjoy it.  The reason being is that it gives a good indicator of how great the story is - The better the story, the less I really notice the fan-service because I'm so engrossed in whats progressing.  So, if you're seeking the fan-service, it's there.  If you want a good story with interesting characters, character development, plot twists, crazy awesome action, you've got it here.  If you want all, you've found your fortune.
Not sure what to compare it to...maybe Neon Genesis meets street fighter?  If you know either, that might make sense...

I typically play the Amazon pricing game, wishlisting / monitoring and getting it as low as I think it'll get.  I payed 150$ for the Trigun box back in the early 2000's, I'd easily pay full price for this series.  I hope they continue the anime in the future.",1381536000,20,1303,4.523605150214593

5579420,5,B00BCPOEI6,"I rented the first season and watched it. Immediately I fell in love with the characters. This story is about a high school  grad going to college. He realizes that he has very little money and no education. His dream is to go to the big city and make it on his own.

Soon a strange girl falls from the sky as she is being chased by two other girls wanting to fight with her. As fate would have it the girl is well built and our hero can't believe that he found his girl. Little does he realize that the big picture has many girls in a great plan called ""Sekirei"" where all 108 girls fight for the chance to be found number one.

In the second season: the story picks up from the end of season one. The brains behind the game of Sekirei is known as ""The Professor"" who sees and knows what is on going. Our hero doesn't realize that the professor and his wife are his mom and dad.

The series has plenty of well built women stripping down to do bare battle. Also filled with love and heavy sexual overtones.

This series is NOT FOR CHILDREN! It is for the mature audiences.

Still overall I rate it high for a good laugh and an excellent story. You just want to watch more. I want the next season.",1379376000,2,1196,4.111587982832618

I was lured to it via the manga. I'm kind of a sucker for romances, and Sekirei really does have a great idea going. Even the harem aspect is a little different from your regular harem. I just wish it wasn't saturated with bouncing boobs and constant topless women. It really would have been just as awesome without it.

The action sequences are really good for this type of genre, really good. The anime hasn't really reached the more mysterious plot line, but it's there; and with great action sequences, a nice harem twist, a bearable main char, emotional moments and (if you like it) fan service galore, this is an awesome package.

Personally, Im happy with streaming it. But Otherwise, this is a great deal to own. And I'll bet my grandmas secret recipe more seasons are coming.",1373241600,,976,4.441340782122905

5579442,5,B00BCPOEI6,"A lot of other reviews rave about this action harem anime and deservedly so. While ecchi/fan-service rich (i.e. NSFW and generally not suitable for kids), the story, characters, and action stand on their own. The first season follows the manga reasonably well, but the second season strays into its own plot line (nothing that would prevent a rumored and long-awaited 3rd series).

The English dub is pretty accurate and, in some cases, clarifies some possible plot confusions. The voice of Kazehana-san is sufficiently different in Japanese and English that they almost seem like different characters. I think the honorifics in the Japansese version (e.g. -san, -chan, -tan, -kun, -sama, etc.) defines well how each character places themselves in the relative hierarchy with the other characters. It's not a big deal, but in this anime it does add another layer.

The extras were a welcome addition, as usual. I'd have like more commentary, but then again I always like having more commentary.

My only real beef with the BR/DVD collection arise with the subtitles. The DVD episodes allow you to choose which audio language as well as English subtitles on/off (the audio and subtitle buttons on your remote should work). These generated DVD subtitles are jaggy.  The BR episodes are hard-subtitled (must be chosen via menu), i.e. you can either watch the English dub w/o subtitles or the Japanese with subtitles; the subtitles are smooth. That said, the font for the BR 2nd season is thin and sometimes difficult to read -- you might want to pop in the DVD version to watch the subbed 2nd season.",1371772800,,1597,4.992481203007519
5579443,5,B00BCPOEI6,"The series' premise... In season one a kindhearted guy struggling to pass the entry exams for college is drawn into a secretive world that pits beautiful woman against each other in a lethal game that's winner will be the last woman standing. In season two the buxom combatants and their masters struggle to survive in a game which is run by an insane businessman.

While some anime's episodes are merely self contained stories that do nothing to
further the series' overarching plot this cannot be said of the Sekirei. Each episode builds upon the last furthering the series' overarching plot and keeps you entertained as well as engaged in the story through humorous scenarios, interesting character development and nice fight sequences.

With all this said be warned that the series is not suitable for children due to all the fan service and if you're unfamiliar with the term then let me explain. Fan service means there are a lot of large jiggling breasts, revealing clothing, panty exposing character animations, poses and camera angles as well as brief nudity and strongly suggestive themes.",1371600000,,1099,5.032967032967033

After the first season, I was wanting to fire up the second season immediately (which proved to be much more enjoyable than the first season).  The characters are enjoyable, the story and animation were captivating, and this series was great overall with you wanting more and more.

Saw this title pop up a couple times in related viewings or what others purchased o figured why not.  Went out on a limb and watched a few minutes of it and figured okay this might be something that might not be so bad.

I will parrot what others have said about the content of the series with mild nudity and such, but it just isn't the whole part of the series.  Sure it's there but it's not the whole 22 minutes of each episode.  If you strip, funny choice of a word for this type of series, the fan service out you are still left with a decent storyline of a kid who just lacks the confidence in himself who only needed a push.  Sure it just happens that first push falls literally into his lap and well the story unfolds from there.

Animation quality is clean and crisp but just wish the audio levels were a bit tweaked.  It happens in pretty much every other series so just not limited to this release.  Sometimes you'll get the audio blasting out but then the dialogue levels are a bit lower.",1370476800,,1078,4.219512195121951

The female cast is interesting and there is plenty of fanservice. Much of the personalities feel like they inspired the series My life with Monster Girls. If you like series like High School DXD or just fanservice and comedy you will probably like this. The action scenes are hit or miss depending on the budget.
