8437191,4,B004OESAP0,"This DVD is a ""How To"" first time experience for folks who want to know more about clowning. It was created as a primer. The awarding winning video was featured on David Letterman and a favorite by the children of many celebrities including Henry Winkler, Mark and Brian of KLOS Radio and Bruce Jenner.

The mission is to provide families with a taste of what clowns do and why they do it.

The DVD featured several characters developing their own natural talents and abilities. Clowning is light of heart and that is what this DVD is all about.",1299456000,,545,4.551020408163265
