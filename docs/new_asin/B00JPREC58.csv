8653052,3,B00JPREC58,Routine seems fun but definitely not for beginners. She does a lot of complex tricks and splits right at the first routine. I'm sure on time I will use it but not any time soon. I do like how she breaks each routine down step by step,1519776000,,233,3.978723404255319
8653053,4,B00JPREC58,"I would say this DVD is 8/10. This is the only pole workout DVD that I've ever bought.  I like that the workout is separated into DVD chapters/sections, so you can tailor it to your fitness needs.  I enjoyed the workout and the step-by-step routines and look forward to the strength training portions.
I think this is a fun pole workout, but I'm glad I have about a year's worth of pole experience already- Rock n Pole seems maybe not great for beginners, although someone could probably work up to it pretty easily.  The pace is moderate, with each routine is basically only shot from a straight-on angle, so figuring out which side of the pole/arm/leg to use may not be obvious to a novice.  It would be cool if one of the background dancers maybe was positioned to show a back-view for learning the routines. The music is motivating, but it also gets old quickly-- the band's sound is very repetitive; I'll be muting the DVD and playing my own metal playlist soon enough.
Overall, I like the DVD and love the 'rock' feel of it and will be using this as a workout alternate, at least once a week.",1480896000,2,1098,4.447761194029851
8653054,5,B00JPREC58,"This DVD has:
A warm up( about 15 mins. Long)
3 pole routines with their 3 breakdowns ( if you need more help learning the moves there is extra help in special feature option)
Floor play dance routine and breakdown
3 hardcore strength training sections
And a cool down
I am a begginner at pole and was afraid that I wouldn't be able to do much of the video but this is really for all levels. I can't do everything but this gives me something to work on. But tons of fun!",1457222400,3,470,4.119565217391305
