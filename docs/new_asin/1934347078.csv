7801885,5,1934347078,"This DVD takes you through the empty hand combat of the Filipino Martial Arts. It deals with defending against knifes using these methods. CADENA DE MANO means ""The chaining of your hand strikes"". The late Guru Tony Somera is so exact and precise in this art he makes it look easy. You can't learn Martial Arts of any kind without a certified qualified instructor. If you try these techniques please practice use a training knife and eye protection. Techniques are done various times with good explanations. It is like attending one of Tony's seminars in Stockton, Ca. Tony was an amazing  instructor and a great person. The American ESCRIMA community was blessed by his contributions to the Martial Arts and his cultural community. It is so fortunate this information was captured and made available to the general public.",1405209600,,823,4.963768115942029
