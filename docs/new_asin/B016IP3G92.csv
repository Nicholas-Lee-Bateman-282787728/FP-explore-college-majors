7473100,5,B016IP3G92,"Really funny and silly movie.  The directing was spot on, the animation was beautiful, and the actors were impressive, and so cute in their roles. Some stuff throughout for adults to laugh at, while being tame and cute enough for all ages at the same time. Only saw the English version, but was very impressed with the quality and how well done it was.  Loved Jon Heder as the crazy duck egg, Mickey Mallard, and Jay Mewes as the stoner egg, Carney. Zack Gordon (from Diary Of a Wimpy Kid) was excellent and sweet as the lead character, Rolo. Definitely would recommend.  Fun movie for everyone.",1450310400,,595,4.59433962264151

It was awesome that not only did you have this movie at all( couldn't find it anywhere), you also had it in English as well as Spanish on the same disc.
