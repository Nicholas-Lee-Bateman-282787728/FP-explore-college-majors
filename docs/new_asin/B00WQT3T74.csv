8713948,1,B00WQT3T74,Very misleading...old radio interview footage taped together. Huge waste of money and time. Turned it off after the first 10 minutes and only went that long hoping the joke would end and some real concert/documentary footage would begin. Wish Id have read the reviews properly and not assumed that the low stars were from non buble fans. DO NOT BUY THIS! All can be found through out YouTube...for free.,1514764800,,403,4.855072463768116
8713949,2,B00WQT3T74,"As much as I love Michael Buble and own all of his CD's, this DVD was just a series of old interviews with him-- they weren't even in chronological order!  Of course, Michael is charming as always but I kept waiting for at least some concert footage but there wasn't any music on it at all!  I'm sorry to say but it was a $13 disappointment...",1507852800,,343,4.181818181818182
