If you're here looking at this, you probably already know who T-Bone Walker is, and what he stood for in the music world, as well as some (if not all) of his work(s) -- from his humble beginnings in Houston, Texas, to the heavy recordings he laid down in the early 40's at Capitol in Los Angeles, that ended up being covered by countless blues musicians, T-Bone is cited as the grand inspiration for guitar legends such as Chuck Berry, B.B. King, and my personal favorite, Mr. Hubert Sumlin.

From the glorious full-step bends and slight, subtle curls, to the delicious minor/major scale-mixing and that lovely thrown-in blues-note... There was and never will be anything like T-Bone.

The instructor on this video is very clear and starts each lesson with a little bit of history on the track, as well as basic theory behind it... the menu which they don't make much mention of, shows up great while watching on my Mac. There's a few different camera angles to choose from (not just a basic straight-forward on the fretboard one like on other DVD's) and you can get a good idea of what notes are being placed where, and at what time (as you probably know, the timing is big with T-Bone licks). These different angles also lend a good hand to helping each student identify with their own style of learning -- me personally, I like looking at the on-screen tab, combined with the ""looking down as if you're playing"" view... if that makes sense.

I tried posting pictures I pic-stitched of the DVD screens but Amazon did not approve.

Definitely would purchase this DVD again, and was very pleased with the instructor's clear instruction and his overall teaching ability and vibe. If you love the blues and/or roots music, this is definitely your bag, with a great mix of some Aaron Thibeaux ""T-Bone"" Walker's greatest work, taught in a manner where you can practice it daily and come back to learn more when you're ready for the next step. I really enjoyed this DVD :)",1434326400,3,1983,4.670487106017192
