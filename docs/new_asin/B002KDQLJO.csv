Each section shows a real life example of what each of Erikson's stages are like. Great for the classroom or the psychology enthusiast.
Also, as an animation buff there were pats of it that were very well done. Other parts were a bit lazy, but it was done by students in the seventies. Very artsy at times.
All in all I found this movie both visually and mentally stimulating and enjoyable.",1293321600,,558,4.273584905660377
8371884,5,B002KDQLJO,"This is a very well done animation to illustrate the 8 stages of life by Erik Erickson. Trumpet music was done by Dizzy Gillespie! Each of the eight sections contains two characters to illustrate the task to be completed (Trust vs. Mistrust, Integrity vs. Despair, etc..) But be warned: This is a LONG video and it is not of interest to everyone. Don't try to use it to babysit your children! If you are interested in Psychology or Eric Erickson I would highly recommend it! And if you are teaching a Psychology class, this video will help your students to understand each of the 8 stages. Please do not make them watch the entire video in one sitting! It is best used by watching one stage at a time and discussing the stage both before and after viewing.",1266710400,2,756,4.4855072463768115
8371885,3,B002KDQLJO,The film is too old and in cartoon format which will not work well with my students.  A friend suggested I purchase this to use in my Human Development class.  I will probably give the film to her since she likes it so much but does not have a copy.,1246752000,,249,3.96
8371886,5,B002KDQLJO,"This is a wonderful overview of Erik Erikson's psychosocial stages of development. The animation and protrayal of the tension in each stage of life (e.g. Ego Integrity vs. Despair)helps one to understand each of the stages.  There are interesting characters in each stage who represent both aspects of that stage (e.g. ""cute cat"" for trust and ""scary cat"" for mistrust).  This helps students to identify each stage of development while giving examples of the social questions and challenges each human faces during their life cycle.  It is not only informative,but also creative, conceptual and accessible to all. One can easily see some of the Freudian theory Erikson builds on and the examples are clearly illustrate the dilemmas we all face as we develop and mature.  Excellent film.",974419200,8,786,5.165354330708661
