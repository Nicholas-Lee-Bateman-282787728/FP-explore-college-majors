2864951,4,B000RES61E,I thought this DVD was very good. It showed some of the cities and country side of Thailand as well as some of the adult entertainment establishments.  It had several interviews with some of the girls which I found to be informative. I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested in the adult entertainment business in Thailand.,1231200000,9,330,4.7894736842105265
2864952,5,B000RES61E,"This film will not appeal to everyone. You may need at least a passing interest in the subject matter to enjoy it. I found the DVD to be an insightful and interesting look at the relationship between Thai women and Western males.
There are abundant images of Thai beauties and the vibrant nightlife, filmed mainly in Bangkok. The film goes deeper however and gives the viewer insight into the buddhist views and approach to life typical of Thais. I found these views refreshing and share much of the filmakers philosophy on life and love.
Highly recommended and thoroughly enjoyable!",1230595200,15,583,4.898989898989899
2864953,5,B000RES61E,"Very entertaining video. The author obviously had a great time in Thailand. It is nice to see how he juxtaposes the Thailand experience with Buddhism. I know very little about Buddhism, so that part was very interesting to me.",1218585600,6,226,4.82051282051282
2864954,5,B000RES61E,"I couldn't believe that a video could capture the action me and my friends have been enjoying in Thailand for years, but the ""Last Temptation in Thailand"" was just like being there! The guy travels all over Thailand in a kind of sex odyssey and then ties it altogether with a Sex in the City kind of narrative. If you can't go to Thailand or are thinking about going, get this tape and see what you're missing!  Absolutely the best show on Thailand I've ever seen!",1210723200,16,464,4.395348837209302
2864955,1,B000RES61E,I ordered this product before December 1st actually it was shipped on Dec. 1st and I have no gotten it yet and I did not get a tracking code and I have no way of letting them know I have not gtten it and Im an Amazon Prime custumer,1199232000,,231,3.7346938775510203
8200188,4,B000RES61E,"This is a guy's video of his trip to Thailand with voiceovers as he ogles a load of gals he encounters, some of which he takes back to his room for some one-on-one time to interview them in various stages of undress on their hopes, dreams, and men they might possibly consider settling down with.  Mentions prices.

Additionally he visits the countryside and some temples, all the while quoting spiritual comments. Engaging and insightful, suggestive with very little actual exposure.",1508889600,,484,5.0375
8200189,3,B000RES61E,"This is an unusually philosophical and intellectual commentary on the sex trade in Thailand  but also on the nature of desire and its consequences, written an American student of Buddhism and most probably an accomplished Zen meditater. Some of the women and locations are strikingly beautiful, and there is unmistakable historical and spiritual relevance to the narrative. In fact, the ""eye candy"" rarely goes beyond the 'pg' level, while the underlying messages are thought provoking.  Gary Best is an extremely literate orator with the capacity for broad perspectives. I was mesmerized by the women, and deeply intrigued by the social commentary. I might actually hold on to this rather unique dvd- for both reasons. If you enjoyed Gary's film style and philosophical perspective, look for his other film, The Last Road to Cambodia, another personal Asian odyssey with a focus on the Cambodian killing fields of the late Khmer Rouge.",1496534400,,936,5.233333333333333

8200192,5,B000RES61E,"Now some 5 years since I first viewed this video - most of those years spent in Thailand (2 years) and the Philippines (3 years) - and I consider this an excellent introduction to Asian life - and particularly the girls that travelling boys meet there.
Yes, sometimes Best goes over-the-top and indulges a little too much in slavering over the the girls' beauty. That is inevitable given their charms.
But he also raises fundamental questions that are likely to dog many travellers, and gives hints as to the answers without ever actually solving the problems.
As his friend Buddha might say: ""No can solve them, you can only live them.""",1412726400,,637,4.747747747747748

8200196,2,B000RES61E,"This documentary will be of value to two types of people: men looking for shallow sophistry to justify their sex tourism and people interested in how sex tourists delude themselves.  As the creator of this documentary is a happy customer of the sex trade, any semblance of unbiased presentation is lost.  The creator of this documentary claims an interest in truth.  It is, however, impossible for a paying customer to interview a prostitute and expect to hear this truth.  The prostitutes consistently tell him that they prefer middle-aged to old foreigners, that they enjoy their work, and that they dislike Thai men.  They are wily enough to know that these are the exact answers that he wants to hear.

The excuses he and his fellow johns deceive themselves with are pathetic.  They argue, with all of the inadequacy of their collective losership, that paying a Thai prostitute directly for sex is exactly the same as paying for dinner and a movie in the West with the indirect expectation of sexual favours afterward.  These consistently paunchy, pale, and/or awkward-looking men are so lost in their own sexual appetites that they forget that a date is not a transaction in hope of sexual returns, but an embarking of two people in a relationship.  Paying a prostitute for sex in Thailand is exactly the same as paying a prostitute for sex in North America, only the small capital that these men have is valued far more in Thailand.  He and his fellow sex tourists also seem to believe that there is something magical in their whiteness that makes them desirable to Thai women.  The only magic happening here is capitalism in its most base and ugly manifestation.

But the truth is not only lost in what he chooses to present, but in what he chooses to ignore.  While he waxes poetic with self-absorbed consistency on his own motivations, he passes over entirely the issues of AIDS, exploitation, and the social impact of this sex industry.  He interviews fellow sex tourists, prostitutes, and two female backpackers, while remaining purposely oblivious to NGO workers, frontline health care promoters, Thai men, and regular Thai women.  In fact, one section of the film seems to imply that almost all Thai women are available to western men.  Take away the economic imbalance, and you will soon find that a few beautiful Thai women are no longer willing to sacrifice their dignity for the money of ugly white men.

One of the more amusing sections of the film had the documentarian dismissing backpacking tourists as yuppies.  This khaki-short wearing, goateed douchebag is the epitome of whitebread middle class yuppie-ness, yet he tries to separate himself from the label.  Another rather entertaining tangent is his warmed-over Buddhism.  One trap that western Buddhists consistently fall into is that they make the entire philosophy about their own inner struggles, forgetting Buddhism's focus on community.  Does he really believe that his cavorting around Thailand paying for sex with multiple women will have a positive effect on Thai community?  It's not clear in the documentary, because it isn't something helooks into.

For all of his pretentious naval-gazing, the creator of this documentary does have a skill with words.  He is a man of some intelligence and wit, but the hollow sophistry that he uses to justify his own lack of self control is telling.  This is an empty shell of a man, too wrapped up in his own desires to consider the consequences of his actions.

My hope is that someday Thailand's economy will rise to such a level that desperate Thai women will not be reduced to sleeping with these men.  For a much more truthful, striking documentary on Thai prostitution I would recommend ""The Virgin Trade.""",1301875200,17,3737,4.947115384615385
