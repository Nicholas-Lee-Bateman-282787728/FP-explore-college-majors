3583778,4,B001FBJU1I,"Not only does Foghat give props to all the great blues greats that appear on the DVD (Muddy Waters, Johnny Winter, Paul Butterfield, etc...) but they are having a blast playing with them. This is a great DVD for Foghat fans and fans of the blues.",1251244800,13,246,4.369565217391305
3583779,5,B001FBJU1I,"Foghat performing with Blue's legends in concert, it is an outstanding DVD it has 12 songs, about 50 minutes long, includes the songs Sweet Home Chicago, It Hurts Me Too and I Just Want To Make Love To You, live from New York in 1977.",1232236800,13,234,4.222222222222222
3583780,4,B001FBJU1I,"I have all of Foghat's music. They were a rocking band. This video shows them playing with their heroes. The color quality isn't the greatest,but it was shot in 1978 on film,however,the concert is great and I loved every minute of it. It shows a day in history that won't be repeated.",1228953600,16,284,4.480769230769231

8301799,1,B001FBJU1I,"Great bands, great music and I'm sure a great concert to have witnessed in person, but this DVD picture quality is so bad I think they may have video taped it off of an old computer screen that was playing a terrible quality youtube video, and just for good measure they put 2 pairs of pantyhose (probably L'eggs ""suntan"" color) over the camera lens to give it an authentic vintage look.  You can see other cameras rolling FILM on stage so someone has the NEGATIVE.  This distributor just forgot to call that particular person when they decided to sell this damn dvd to the public.

Oh... now that I think about it...  it may have been a creative decision on the part of the distributor to make it look so ""vintage"".  In that case I applaud their efforts and all the energy spent on video taping it off of an old computer screen that was playing a terrible quality youtube video whilst putting 2 pairs of pantyhose (probably L'eggs ""suntan"" color) over the camera lens to give it that authentic ""vintage"" look.  Well done distributor.  Well done.",1392768000,,1046,4.561497326203209
8301800,4,B001FBJU1I,"Performances by all are fantastic, great concept of one of the world's top bands (at the time) playing with some of the great bluesmen while they were still alive. The performances themselves are 5 stars.

Audio and video are very so-so, there doesn't seem to have been any effort to clean them up. I had no problems viewing or listening, but the quality is no better than a typical youtube video recorded straight off the TV, so the video is sort of washed out and the audio is somewhat muddy (like a decent audience bootleg). It would've been great to have seen & heard this fully restored, even moreso if other songs from the evening that weren't originally broadcast were included as I'm certain the show was longer than 50 minutes! The voiceovers are by Lonesome Dave and are kept to a minimum. Sound/video only warrants 2 stars IMO.

I give 4 stars overall as the historical performance matters more to me than the video/audio quality. I would recommend this to any Foghat or blues collector, but not necessarily to anyone who is a casual fan of either, mainly due to the video/audio quality.

FYI - Foghat does not play with Johnny Winter or Muddy Waters' first song; everyone who played that night joins in on the last song, which was done at Muddy Waters' original speed, and not Foghat's heavier & much faster version. Also, I own everything by Foghat, so you know where I'm coming from.",1313884800,3,1397,4.625
8301801,1,B001FBJU1I,"This is the worst looking DVD I have ever owned.  I thought Joni Mitchell's Shadows and Light DVD was bad.  This is worse.  The audio is terrible as well. Look at the DVD jacket pictures, you have to wonder after seeing the video where they got those stills.  I really wanted a video reminder of what this band was all about in their prime.  Too bad.  The only way this would be watchable is on a 12"" B&W tube tv.  Bloody awful!",1311897600,2,428,4.146341463414634
8301802,5,B001FBJU1I,"I have always loved Foghat.  I saw them live once and they gave everyone a great show.  Lonesome Dave would have it no other way.  Unfortunately, there are not a lot of DVDs available of them in their prime.  This is one of them.  It is really cool to see how charged up the boys get in playing with some of their Blues heroes.  And those Blues masters show off quite a bit too.  Rock and Roll lost 2 good friends with the passing of Lonesome Dave and Roddy ""the magician of slide"" Price.  But thanks to a classic event like this captured on film, they are to never be forgotten.  If you are a fan of the Blues as well as Foghat, this is a ""must have"" DVD.",1293580800,2,656,4.023255813953488
8301803,3,B001FBJU1I,"I just got finished watching this show,and it's very good overall. Foghat,Johnny Winter,Muddy Waters,and Paul Butterfield are all standouts in this one,as are most of the other guests. The video and audio quality are alright for a straight transfer,but could have been much better if master tapes had been used to begin with. Another beef is with Johnny Winter's version of ""Last Night""-just about the time his solo gets cooking,it's cut short! Not too cool,IMHO.It appears that it has recently went out of print-don't pay more than $10 or $12 for this one,folks.",1292371200,2,563,5.064516129032258
8301804,5,B001FBJU1I,"This DVD is one of the few releases from the Don Kirshner's Rock Concert television series.  It finds Foghat hosting a tribute to blues greats at a sold out theater in NY.  While the quality isn't the greatest, if you're into vintage Foghat, this is it.  This features not only Foghat but other great blues artists, as well.  Too bad all of Foghat's performances on Don Kirshner's aren't available.  They're out there because clips can be found on youtube.",1276128000,4,456,4.7215189873417724
