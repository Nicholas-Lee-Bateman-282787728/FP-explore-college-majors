8140751,4,B000HPNASW,"As a lifting/carrying flick aficionado, Criminal Act is one of my favorite examples of the genre. In this film there are no less than fourteen scenes of lifting, with around half of those evolving into a full on carry. It's amazing stuff, and, with the lovely Catherine Bach getting the most carrying time, it's easy on the eyes as well. While it's not quite in league with classics such as The Big Hit (featuring Mark Wahlberg lifting/carrying a tiny Asian girl on several occasions) or Pierre de Jardonet's little-seen 1968 classic ""Je vais vous porter  la maison"" (perhaps the Holy Grail of lifting/carrying cinema), Criminal Act will more than satisfy those looking for maximum lift with their carry.",1441411200,,704,4.966101694915254
