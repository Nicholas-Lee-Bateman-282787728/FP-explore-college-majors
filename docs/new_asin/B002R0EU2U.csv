8378228,3,B002R0EU2U,"""Luantics Lovers & Poets"" had some craziness in it, whereas I expected it to have more antics that would be representative of or deserving of Lu.  But maybe that's just me.",1493510400,2,172,4.548387096774194
8378229,2,B002R0EU2U,"The father is the best example of what's wrong with this movie: poor casting, poor acting, and a poor script. I cringed whenever he came on the screen. The actress playing Maria does a good job, but it's not enough to make this thing worth watching.",1487894400,,249,4.434782608695652
8378230,5,B002R0EU2U,"More than what I expected. Love the story, great acting, wonderful music, beautiful city and country scenes. So true to life. Ups and downs and try to connect, reconnect with family and true friendship...the special things in life.",1486771200,,231,5.105263157894737
8378231,5,B002R0EU2U,"A timeless story of a first generation Scottish writer named Seamus MacGregor who lives in the outskirts of Los Angeles County and is dealing with abandonment issues, as his father had left him and his mother and his mother committed suicide when he was young.  This has a profound influence with the way he deals with people and his relationships as he tries to use alcohol to dull the pain and escape.  His writing lets him try to make sense of the world and also offers an escape both imaginarily and real, as he eventually gets a buyer to help him financially get his feet on the ground.  The story continues with his experiences with his best friend and his best friends wife to be, his on and off girlfriend, and his homeless alcholic father.
Pros:
Nice cinematography
Good story that reminds us that without knowing the full story of a persons life, that we might reach the wrong conclusion
An interesting look at human perception and family communication
Cons:
Starts off a little slow, at first I thought this was going to be a 3 star film
If you are looking for a happy feel good film, this is not it, as it deals with human tragedy",1484006400,2,1142,4.480769230769231
8378232,4,B002R0EU2U,"This is a movie about Seamus (Leif Gantvoort - ""The Amazing Spiderman""), a struggling writer whose father (Cotter Smith, a veteran actor who's been in everything) is a homeless, mentally ill alcoholic who abandoned the family when Seamus was a boy, and who wanders the streets bellowing Shakespeare.  The acting was a little melodramatic and some of Gantvoort's emotional scenes seemed contrived.  The plot was somewhat cliche -- I mean really, who still uses an old typewriter to pen their novel?  Nevertheless, it was a good movie about coming to grips with the past and resolving old, festering family resentments.  The film had beautiful photography, stunning scenery, and beautiful actors. Seamus's girlfriend, Maria (Maria-Elena Laas)was totally hot and Leif Gantvoort has a gorgeous body(hey, I'm a red-blooded girl, what can I say). I really liked the portrayal of the friendship between Seamus and his best pal Mickey (Jeremy Robinson), as well as Mickey's devotion to his fiancee, Allison (the very healthy Katie Halchishick) and his attempts to get Seamus to open up emotionally. It's worth seeing.",1370131200,3,1109,5.284090909090909
8378233,1,B002R0EU2U,"I could only view the beginning of this film because it consistently froze up on me. I didn't like it at all. I felt that the writing was bad, some of the acting unbelievable. I usually don't like to give very negative reviews, but I feel that I wasted my money on this. Perhaps if I could've seen the whole film, the rest of it would've been better & I would be able to give it a higher rating.",1353801600,2,395,4.012658227848101
8378234,4,B002R0EU2U,"A cinematically beautiful film.  A mosaic of sympathetic characters, raw emotions and the roads they all intersect on.  A deeply emotional tale of regret, rejection, liberation and ultimately finding forgiveness and rediscovering that one true love.  A film that will be as relevant in 10 years as it is today.",1259020800,3,310,5.16
8378235,4,B002R0EU2U,"We own this film, and the movie is just stunning to watch.  There is a lot of communication that happens without a word ever being spoken due to the cinematography.  It's a great story, and it is told very well.",1258243200,,211,4.25
8378236,4,B002R0EU2U,"After we all get done with the formulaic hollywood stuff that is drivelled out over us, this was an engrossing study in character.  Loved the development of the friendships, backdrop to building of full, lush characters.  it's one of those films that grabs you.  this goes in my list of ""finds""...",1258243200,2,297,4.784313725490196
