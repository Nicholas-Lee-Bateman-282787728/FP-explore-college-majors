8099753,5,B000CNEEKC,"This is a great DVD that will help you to improve your fighting technique.

Alexandre breaks down various techniques according to belt ranking (white to black), starting with basic zuki punches all the way up to complex kicks which require good flexibility and careful timing.

Video quality and camera work are great. Techniques are demonstrated at slow and full speed in the dojo. There are also clips of various tournaments where the applications are shown. Perfect video for all the kumite competitors out there.",1149638400,,516,5.130952380952381
