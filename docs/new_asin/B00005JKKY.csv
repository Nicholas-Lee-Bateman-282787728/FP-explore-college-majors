1437742,5,B00005JKKY,"What a glorious surprise this movie was!  It is the story of two literary researchers who stumble upon a previously unearthed love affair between two Victorian-era poets.  The movie seemlessly moves between the 1860's and present day.  Wonderful cast, great script and very romantic.  Gwyneth Paltrow turns in a great performance as does Jennifer Ehle.",1046044800,,352,5.345454545454546
1437743,5,B00005JKKY,"OK the movie isn't the novel but then very very few films are.
This is not slowly paced as some other reviewers relate, merely
more is going on 'between the ears'. It will be important to
actually WATCH the movie. CAREFULLY. If you felt that '84
Charring Cross Road' was not a good movie, do yourself a favor
and skip this one too. I haven't enjoyed myself this much
since 'The Contender'. I was happy to get the DVD since it this
 never played in my home state, and frankly that's their loss.
A. S. Byatt is an extremely good writer and so I recommend the
book as well.",1045353600,8,570,4.229357798165138
1437744,3,B00005JKKY,"I saw this film shortly after reading the book, which is usually a bad idea. This was no exception, as Possession the movie is a greatly simplified and less significant work than the novel by A.S. Byatt. To be fair, the long and multifaceted novel would be almost impossible to recreate on screen. The film, however, could have done a better job in capturing the romantic and literary feeling of the book. Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart play Maud Bailey and Roland Mitchell, a pair of scholars who uncover evidence of a secret affair between Victorian poets Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel Lamotte. While Gwyneth Paltrow gives a flawless performance (and displays her flawless English accent), Aaron Eckhart comes across more like a male model or soap opera star than an introspective graduate student. His looks, clothes, body language and glib lines are at odds with the story's aura of tragic romance. Perhaps director Neil Labute was afraid if he cast Roland Mitchell as the tentative and somewhat bumbling (and English) character of the book he'd alienate modern American audiences. Possession, like its lead characters, is nice to look at, with its scenic vistas of hills and and quaint seaside villages. It also captures some of the intellectual excitement felt by people who care about anachronistic things like history and poetry. It does not, however, get much beneath the surface of things. There is just too much plot here to cram into 100 or so minutes of film. Aside from the contemporary scholars and their Victorian counterparts, there is a complex sublot concerning another faction of academics attempting to seize a collection of letters between Ash and Lamotte. This competition is awkwardly resolved with a fistfight in a graveyard. The best I can say about Possession is that it's an interesting and visually pleasing but unmemorable romance. Those who haven't read the book are likely to have a less prejudiced and more charitable opinion of it.",1045353600,6,1972,5.052147239263804
1437745,5,B00005JKKY,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this film, but since I love books and poetry I figured I would give it a try.  I found myself amazed by this wonderful movie.  Its the story of two scholars researching the lives of two poets that supposedly had no connection at all to each other.  Ash was a poet that was supposedly a devout husband and Christabel was a lesbian poet living out her life with her lover.  What no one knew was that Ash and Christabel had a passionate affair that is uncovered when the present day Roland discovers an old letter at the library.  Its then he begins to search for the truth with a distant relative of Christabel's, Maude.  From then on, the story unfolds between the present and 1859.  As they make discoveries, Maude and Roland are changed by this forever.
This is truly an amazing and romantic film that doesn't bore. The actors are all amazing and the flashes between then and now is done perfectly.  If you are fascinated with the past as I am, you will love this.  Its a literary film that isn't at all stuffy and the romance is weaved beautifully.  I recommend this highly.
All in all, a wonderful film to be cherished.",1045353600,4,1156,4.410377358490566
1437746,3,B00005JKKY,"Since I have not read A.S. Byatt's much admired and award-winning [Booker Prize, 1990] novel on which ""Possession"" is based, I can not compare the movie to the book. I suspect, however, that the film is only marginally successful in its translation. I know that it did not make me want to run out and buy the book.
This is the story of two scholars who join forces to solve a literary mystery. Roland [Aaron Eckhart] is an American [British in the book] who discovers a letter in a book in a London library. It implies that a 19th Century English poet, Randolph Ash [Jeremy Northam], always presumed to have been faithful to his wife, may have had a passionate affair with a poetess, Christobel LaMotte [Jennifer Ehle], long thought to have been a Lesbian. The impulsive, rebellious Roland steals the letter and shows it to Maud [Gwyneth Paltrow], an expert on Ash. Though shocked at Roland's methods, the stuffy, rather chilly Maud is intrigued. Together, they search for the truth. As the story of Ash and LaMotte's romance unfolds in flashbacks, our literary sleuths embark on a romance of their own.
The flashbacks are glorious, the highlight of the movie. Northam and Ehle have a chemistry onscreen which makes them quite believable. They also get to read some beautiful poetry. Paltrow and Eckhart also read poetry, but they sound more like fans of the art rather than great speakers. Their romance is less believable, as well as less important because the stakes aren't as high. This is a detriment because the story is more of a romance than it is a mystery.
The movie's pacing is quite languid. I enjoyed this tempo in the flashbacks but found myself getting impatient with the modern sequences. There is a time to pause and a time to get on with it. ""Possession"" is best suited for the most patient of viewers. At best, it is an interesting failure.",1045353600,,1859,4.705521472392638
1437747,4,B00005JKKY,I was consumed by this movie.  A beautiful and touching story.  Jennifer Ehle puts her whole heart and soul into her performance. She is mesmerizing to watch.  Truly an under appreciated actress. Jennifer and Jeremy's story should have had more screen time than the modern day persons.,1045094400,,285,5.0212765957446805
1437748,4,B00005JKKY,"I went to see this film purely because some of it was shot where I went to university in Lincoln, England. However, I found the plot very interesting and didn't really notice the time go by!! Although some of the film was predictable, it was entertaining and complelling and worth seeing.",1045008000,,288,4.666666666666667
1437749,4,B00005JKKY,"I read the book when it came out, thought it exceptional and visually appealing and was excited/fearful at the thought of seeing a movie version.  As I read the casting information, the prospect of seeing Jeremy Northam (epitomizing male sensitivity and sincerity) and Ralph Finnes as the male principles was thrilling.  Unlike many others I disliked Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet (physically too lush, sly looking and cold for that character) but for conveying the character of Christabel, even though she did not (again) match the physical description, she was just perfect in her glances, her carriage, the cadence of her voice.  I was disappointed initially at the change to Aaron Eckhart for the Roland Mitchell character, but as I watched the movie over time, that change grew on me.  A couple of quibbles. The grave-robbing scene was cheesy-melodramatic and however did the director not catch the use of a portrait of an old woman (which was enclosed in the final letter of Christabel) as the representation of the daughter of Randolph and Christabel?? I should explain that I saw this movie several times while waiting for my teenager who works at the local movie house... Believe it or not, I cannot wait for the video release.",1043884800,,1240,4.975845410628019
1437750,5,B00005JKKY,"This was the best movie of 2002 that absolutely nobody saw. (There were better movies, but they all found their audiences.) The movie follows two stories -- the 19th-century romance between writers Randolph Henry Ashe (Jeremy Northam, ""Gosford Park"") and Christabel LaMotte (Jennifer Ehle, ""Wilde"") and the modern-day story of two researchers (Aaron Eckhart, ""Erin Brockovich,"" and Gwynneth Paltrow, ""Shakespeare in Love"") who are trying to find the truth about them.
The two love stories are both really strong and have strange parallels, but are never presented in a confusing or inaccessible manner. Director Neil LaBute (Nurse Betty) told a very hard story in a very powerful way. Eckhart redeems his turn in the pathetically overrated ""Erin Brockovich"" and Paltrow yet again plays a Brit so convincingly you figure she's never coming back to America. Oh well -- at least she's good at it.",1040169600,4,893,5.208333333333333

There are 2 parallel tales being told here which, in spite of the really good work of Gweneth Paltrow & Aaron Eckhart as the contemporary couple, get overshadowed by the mysterious couple from the past, played terrifically by Jennifer Ehle & Jeremy Northam.

The back-and-forth shifts from present to distant past are handled well. Great cinematography; shot on-location in England and Wales. The casting was quite good (Paltrow and her leading man were the only Yanks cast), with some good performances by well-known English actors and a couple of very talented unknowns.

1437846,4,B00005JKKY,"I love this film. Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle are outstanding, perfect for their roles. I also thought Gwenyth Paltrow was great. The rest of the cast was mediocre, particularly Aaron Elkin, who was very much a fish out of water - he portrayed a rather crass American pretty well, but utterly failed to portray the intelligence which would presumably have been required for his character's profession and detective skills.

First, the location in England, beautiful, exquisite. Such energy in London, such lush vegetation in the country side.  Second, the story is wonderful, Roland and Maud searching for meaning in poetry and  in a love story while discovering their own love story. The chemistry between Aaron and Gwyneth was wonderful.  Roland made Maud feel beautiful as he let down her hair and caressed her face. Their love was inspiring and tender as each person broke down walls and boulders and finally, open themselves up to each other. Aaron looked so handsome in this movie and Gwyneth was lovely as always, beautiful face. I would recommend this to any fan of Aaron, Gwyneth, or beautiful poetry.

1437972,5,B00005JKKY,"First if you love this movie then see Easy Virtue... the Oscar Wild adaptation... just as good.

One of my favorite all time movies, a comedy and a romance, a mystery, historical drama and much much more. All of the cast is very good but the four main cast members are superb. Jane Austen fans have a surprise.

 My favorite Paltrow movie although Shakespeare in Love was equal; both shine because of the exceptionally well written screenplays.

This rates here 4 stars but you can add a star for dull and/or ignorant people who can't understand intelligent movies. If you love history, literature, love stories and good writing, some of the most inventive ever, don't hesitate.

The lead male character does at times get a little strange in relationship to a past relationship... but he is after all a poet and a poor post graduate trying to make a living in an egotistical driven world of high liberal arts academia.",1445472000,,918,4.7125

1438479,5,B00005JKKY,"This is a classic love story, and this is the most unusual love story I have seen in years. Yes, it is that full of contradictions. For one thing, it is actually two stories: the one in the 21st century and the other in the 19th.

Roland Mitchell (Aaron Eckhart) is an American on an internship at the London Museum because of a retrospective of the works of Randolph Ash (Jeremy Northam), a poet of the Victorian era. Maud Bailey (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a researcher into the life of Christabel LaMotte (Jennifer Ehle), a Victorian era poet who was known to be a lesbian. But Roland comes across the drafts of two letters from Ash to LaMotte that suggest much more. He goes to Maud to find out what she knows, and she is quite intrigued by the letters. She tells him all about LaMotte's lesbian lover, a painter who eventually committed suicide.

While Roland and Maud work together to track down clues to this mysterious romance, we get quite a few glimpses into the lives of Ash and LaMotte. One technique I really liked was when we would be in a location with Ash and LaMotte and the camera would pan to a different part of the room or the building and there are Roland and Maud. About the only thing that is different is the clothes and the carriage replaced with a Porsche.

Clearly, a romance is developing in the 21st century, too, but both academics are pretty timid about love, although we don't get a lot of detail as to why. Basically, one infers a combination of old disappointments and a great deal of focus on their academic work.

So how does it work out for both couples? Watch the movie.",1336780800,,1602,4.438775510204081

The 19th century costumes and atmosphere were beautiful.
Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle are beautiful to look at. I found their portrayal of the star crossed Victorian lovers to be very well done. What was quoted of the poetry was lovely.

The Bad:
Looking into the past at the romantic and poetic lovers by the history loving sleuths, Maude and Roland should have made a great story. It fell short. It was dis-jointed and did not flow seamlessly from past to present and vice versa. I would not say this movie was a total loss , I did enjoy it somewhat, hence 3 stars.

The Ugly:
The portrayal's of the modern day sleuths was abysmal. I've watched both these actors {Paltrow,Eckhart} perform much better in other roles. Neither was a good fit for their roles in this movie. They had no chemisrty at all.

The misty English landscape is gorgeous in this film. Why then did I find my heart sinking as it progressed? Only when the credits came up did I understand: this film was directed and co-written by Neil Labute, who has been responsible for some of the most cynical, mysoginistic films ever to pass for intellectually respectable drama in the past fifteen years. It takes a strong stomach to sit through In the Company of Men (in which two corporate executives plot to romance and deaf girl and drop her), Your Friends and Neighbors (in which a Don Juan seduces every woman in sight, betraying his friends right and left), or The Shape of Things (in which a female art student uses the campus nerd for a ""makeover"" as her art project, humiliating him with a public exhibit of her ""progress"" making him over). At least in those films, he was simply transferring his trendily cynical plays to the screen. Here he has taken a highly regarded novel, winner of the 1990 Booker Prize, casting one of his regulars, the snide Aaron Eckhart (memorable from In the Company of Men for explaining why he behaves so badly to everyone: ""Because I can."") Labute explains in his commentary on the DVD that he cast Eckhart, making the original English character American, to create some sparks in the relationship with Maud, the Gwyneth Palrow character. (Quite a few of the reviews have pointed out the failure of this strategy, so I won't labor it.) What I will labor is the contemptible treatment of Christabel's Lesbian relationship, which I understand was a good deal more complex in A.S.Byatt's novel. And Gwyneth Paltrow as a feminist scholar? Come on.... According to LaBute, it took twelve years to bring Byatt's story to the screen. He should have left it alone.",1269820800,8,1907,4.7993920972644375

The movie has a nice rhythm to it. It never really throws up any major surprises, but the storyline is original enough that it remains entertaining.

A young American apprentice (Aaron Eckhart) finds himself amongst the snobbery of English literature circles, struggling for a space in the sun of acknowledgement, when he discovers secret love letters written by a Victorian poet (Jeremy Northam). Our American apprentice teams up with an English scholar (Gwyneth Paltrow), and they find themselves falling in love as the Victorian love story of the poet and his secret lover unfolds.

Possession is a tender and beautiful film: both love stories - modern and Victorian - interwoven and wonderfully performed by Eckhart, Paltrow, Northam and Ehle; its cinematography and costume design painting it beautifully, and finished off in Gabriel Yared's moving score.

Unfortunately, all of the themes that make it a wonderful novel - feminism, the expectations of society, British reserve, a woman's struggle between love and work, and much more - do not translate well to a movie, and of course don't appeal at all to the modern American moviegoer. The story lines were ""dumbed down"" to fit the just-under-2-hours pace of a movie, ignoring all of the subtleties that made these characters believable in print.

Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart have no chemistry between them, and that only underscored the fact that their ""struggle"" to stay away from each other was poorly written in the film. Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle do sizzle, and made up the only watchable parts of this movie.

If you loved the book, keep it in your head and ignore the film version. If you want a light romance, stick with ""Sleepless in seattle"" and the like.",1192406400,6,959,4.668639053254438
1438670,5,B00005JKKY,"This is a mature, intelligent film (based upon the fictional novel (by the same title) by A.S. Byatt) starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Aaron Eckhart, Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle.  Aaron Eckhart plays Roland Mitchell, an American graduate student working at a museum in London who stumbles upon a previously unaccounted for original letter, written by the (fictional) Victorian poet laureate, Randolph Ash (played by Jeremy Northam).  The particular letter is of a rather racy nature and turns out to be directed to another poet of the day, Christabel LaMotte (played by Jennifer Ehle, who is the aunt, thrice-removed of (present-day) gender studies professor, Dr. Maud Bailey-played by Gwyneth Paltrow).  In an effort to verify the connection that seemingly existed between the two 19th Century poets, Roland consults Maud, who is an authority on LaMotte's writings and personal life.  As a result, the two find themselves caught up in an independent investigation into the relationship between the two poets and unearth the startling discovery that Ash and LaMotte were actually lovers.

The reluctant romance that ensues between Roland and Maud as they doggedly pursue their investigation is contrasted interestingly by the flashback moments in the film of the similarly love-shy, Victorians.  Northam and Ehle, two veteran period actors, shine in their respective roles and the strong chemistry shared between the two is electric.  The set designs and sumptuous costuming (particularly true of the Victorian shots in the movie) are lovely and help transport the viewer between the present-day parts of the movie and those which occur during the middle of the 19th Century.

""Possession"" is a fascinating, suspenseful story about romance and inhibitions.  While Roland and Maud tenaciously pursue their investigative work, the viewer also becomes acquainted with the political and highly competitive nature of scholarly study in the world of academia.  As is normally the case in regard to matters associated with intellectual property, big money rides on the results; Roland's and Maud's joint research draws the attention of less-than-scrupulous colleagues, who launch their own investigation in an effort to also re-write literary history.

""Possession"" will appeal to anyone who enjoys a love story or detective story, since both elements are combined beautifully in this film.  The acting is top-notch and the story is believable and cleverly presented.",1190592000,6,2458,5.4907161803713525

It was one of those books that just leapt out at me... I'm not usually into this type of book but the cover and the write up had me intrigued.

I read the book over the summer and absolutely loved the romance... slightly dark... but very real!

Then we get a wait of about 7 years! And I see the adverts for the film... and it's got Gwyneth in it!!

So first time I see it is on a flight to the US... oh my god I cried... discretely... but god it's a heart wrenching film...

And I picked up the the epilogue bit which I had never read or didn't remember from the book! That one floored me! A very perfect ending to such a beautiful book and film.

Acting is superb and really brings the book to life without losing any of the qualities of the book.

Highly recommended!!! Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle make such a fantastic couple with lots of natural chemistry... and Aaron Eckhart and Gwyneth make a great couple too... both irresistably drawn to one another!

1438674,3,B00005JKKY,"Possession (Neil LaBute, 2002)

There are two types of adaptations: the good and the not-so-good. They can be broken down, of course, into subcategories (brilliant novels adapted into brilliant films vs. mediocre novels adapted into brilliant films, etc.), but the basics are the good and the not-so-good. Possession had all the promise of being a good adaptation-- a fine novel, a solid director, a fantastic cast. What we got is, well, not-so-good.

Roland Michell (LaBute regular Aaron Eckhart), an American grad student, is studying the work of Victorian poet Randolph Henry Ash (Jeremy Northam, recently of The Statement). While doing research for his advisor, he stumbles upon something that may change the face of Ash scholarship entirely-- a possible affair with contemporary feminist Christabel LaMotte (Sunshine's Jennifer Ehle). In order to further research the possible link, he contacts Maud Bailey (Gwyneth Paltrow), the foremost scholar on LaMotte, and the two of them start digging deeper into their literary mystery.

It's a very pretty movie, more Merchant-Ivory than Your Friends and Neighbors, but it seemed to be missing something. Unfortunately, I don't know the novel well at all, and so I can't quite put my finger on what, exactly, it is that's missing. One doesn't have to be a Possession scholar, however, to note something of a lack of chemistry between Paltrow and Eckhart, especially when juxtaposed with Northam and Ehle, who sizzle every time they're together on the screen (and often when they're not). It's not a bad movie, mind you, it just seems like it could have been a good deal more than it is. ** ",1172534400,4,1638,5.123595505617978

1438676,5,B00005JKKY,"Delicate and precious, the film deals with a very embarrassing victorian reality about the poet Ash and his female lover Lamotte. This latter had made the choice of lesbianism, one way to escape the victorian fate for women : to be a totally subservient wife. She falls in love with the poet through a long correspondance and finally yields to desire and passion. She will be pregnant and will deliver in France away from prying eyes. Her female lover will kill herself and she will forever lose her poet-lover, the father of her daughter. She will have lost everything, including her own daughter who will consider her as a distant aunt and will forget to bring her the letter her own father, the girl being completeley unaware of the identity of the man she encounters in the countryside, had entrusted her with for her aunt/mother. Hence the possible renewing of the relation will die away and the secret will disappear. The film though is not very clear on one point. The investigation is jointly managed by an American research assistant and a professor, Maud Bailey, who is presented as a descendent of Lamotte, who is known as having had no male lovers. This of course tells us at once that this Lamotte must have had a lover and the film then becomes the search for the identity of this great great great grandfather of Maud's. The surprising element is that this Maud had not investigated before, though and because she had no lead, but what they both find could probably have been found earlier if it had been looked for, if Maud had really been serious about that lover of a great great great grandfather, which she had not once and for all locked Lamotte in her lesbianism. Till at least the American research assistant comes along... The film though is extremely interesting because of the mirror image the two modern characters send us : they are shy and definitely unwilling to enter a love affair of any kind, both the man and the woman, this time for no victorian reasons at all though the motivations are not clear : modern time desire of both men and women to be autonomous and free from such dependence as sex and love ? Maybe. Probably. Thus the film gets into a higher dimension that implies victorianism was not a monstrous period but only a step on a long road that leads to the freeing of individuals of both sexes without falling in promiscuity and other non-ethical attitudes. We are living in a period where ethics are becoming again the guidelines of individual lives. The film also gives us a nice foot-note about the unethical practices of some university professors and personnel to put their hands on some documents that had been entrusted to a tomb and whose existence had been discovered by some other colleagues who these dishonest professors and personnel are trying to rob of their discovery : such acts are quite common in the academic world, even if marginal, though at times some may feel justified in asking the rhetorical question of how much marginal.

I had considered renting this movie & passed on it, thinking, ""I don't want to see another torrid love story about non-sensical romanticism & obsessiveness.""  But the film proved to be much more practical and smarter than my expectations - something I love about art.

The title of the film is ""Possession"".  There are probably many reasons for the title, but the film might ask the question:  Is it the love & friendship of some that causes the tragic decisions of others?  Or is it some characters' desire to solely possess another person that is the reason for the tragic choices?  And regardless of the cause, how do the people who remain cope with such a tragedy?  How do people in love deal with such a dilemma?

Dilemma - A situation that requires a choice between options that are or seem equally unfavorable or mutually exclusive.

For the movie to have been more interesting, I think the characters of Ellen Ash and Blanche Glover would need to have been more fully drawn, so that we felt their multi-faceted beauty, spice, & layers of loss.

Of the 4 main historical characters, I don't know enough about the characters' levels of suffering and sacrifice to comment on whether 3 of them made mistakes.  But with as little as I know, I don't agree with Blanche Glover's final decision.  Martyrdom lost its appeal for me long ago.

The two contemporary characters, Maude and Roland (Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart) share an unwillingness to become involved with one another based on past romantic experiences.  However, it is the journey they take together uncovering the secret relationship between Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte (Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle) that ultimately leads them to the discovery of themselves and one another.

As contemporary literary experts unearthing a more romantic past, the film appropriately textures Maude and Roland's relationship in a modern milieu.  The love story between Randolph and Christabel is portrayed with the whimsical romance one would expect from the Victorian period.  This structure allows for two completely different types of love stories to be told simultaneously.  The present day story is consumed with internal conflicts in search of resolution, while the story of the past is driven by external factors including deceit, disloyalty, and tragedy.

The film is enjoyable, but far from outstanding.  The most entertaining aspect is uncovering what happened between the two past lovers.  The modern love story is predictable and rather ordinary in it's conventional  use of the fear of pain to create tension.  Randolph and Christabel's story contains more passion and intrigue than that of Maude and Roland's.  The treatment of interchangeably telling two love stories is carried out well, but it just so happens that the one story is much more interesting than the other.  The score and the tidbits of poetry are definitely two of the best components of the film.

I guess there just wasn't time enough to develop the characters, or even to include half of them. The only character true to the book and left almost intact was Sir George. The rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating, and we are left with painful stereotypes and, in the case of Roland Michell, a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming.

It might actually have saved this stopped up commode of a snoozefest about two completely mismatched literary sleuths pursuing the relationship of a philandering poet and his lesbian girlfriend who was about as appealing from my hetero female perspective as Bea Arthur in a g-string bikini.

Gwynnie Paltrow, the most overrated fake British actress in the world, isn't much better.

I especially like the way past happenings and present events seemed to emerge from one another, switching from present to past and back. It was wonderfully carried out, photography really did credit to the production. So did the different beautiful poems and bits of letters linking the two levels: first read by Roland and Maud just to switch it to Christabel and Ash or back. Very dramatic, very powerful.

The characters were very well suited, especially the four protagonists. The attraction between Jennifer Ehle as Christabel and Jeremy Northam as Randolph Ash was almost tangible: very powerful, very passionate, very moving.

I also liked Aaron Eckhart (Roland) and Maud (Gwyneth) and I think I understand why he was made to play an American guy instead of an urban Londoner. This way the difference between him and Maud was more striking especially as Europeans sometimes tend to think of Americans as a bit ""inferior"" - sorry USA, no offence meant! This way we could understand it more clearly why Roland is not really successful as a researcher and why they - from professor Blackadder to Maud - don't take him seriously.

Still, I think that our modern heros should have been given a bit more depth and detail. This is the only bit where I felt the film was wanting. Maud's and Roland's characters could have been elaborated better.

I'm really puzzled by all those American complaints about the casting. I'm English, for crying out loud, and I thought Gwyneth Paltrow WAS English!  Her accent, her expressions and her mannerisms were just perfect: spot on, and not phony in the slightest. The American male lead was just as good --- I've known several American academics just like that. They used to clutter the place up when I was an undergraduate. Eckhart was infinitely more convincing than, eg Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor; or Stanley Baker (Baker an Oxford professor -- you must be joking) in that other university film --- was it called Accident? The English actors, who seemed so stunning to all the American reviewers, struck me as good, but more or less run of the mill. Fact is, most national art impresses foreigners more than natives. Finally, the academic world is indeed a petty, shifty, vicious and jealous kind of place. Sad to say.

1438816,4,B00005JKKY,"This film adaptation of the novel by A.S. Byatt is superb. Its strength lies in the use of the double story line, the double romance, that both develop and intertwine throughout the film.

First we have two modern academics, Maud Bailey, played by Gwynyth Paltrow, and Roland Michell played by Aaron Eckhart. This couple is piecing together the secret romance of two famous Victorian writers, Randolph Henry Ash (played by Jeremy Northam) and Christabel LaMotte (played by Jennifer Ehle). In Byatt's wonderful way of weaving a story within a story, these two modern academic types fall in love as the Victorian secret romance they are discovering acts as a catalyst to their own love affair.

It is wonderfully ironic that the Victorian lovers rush into a passionate and heated romance with terrible consequences when LaMotte's lesbian lover commits suicide while the modern lovers are awkward, cool, frightened of love. Yet it is the flame of the 100 year old romance between LaMotte and Ash that assists in the breaking up of Bailey and Michell's protective armor and allows them to gradually experience vulnerability, and appreciation, and passion, and eventually friendship with each other. This is Byatt's wonderful theme in much of her work, which this film captures, which is that the ""story"" has the ability to reorganize our cognitive and emotional interpretation of our life. There are terrible consequences and painful events that emerge from LaMott and Ash's romance, and yet our modern lovers gradually recognize that there are also severe consequences in maintaining a cool protective veneer over our emotional lives and they do fall in love and act on that love and they are both wide-eyed open to the possibilities.

In the Victorian romance, LaMott has a child by Ash, whom Ash eventually discovers. But the love of Maud Bailey and Roland Michell are also the children of this romance. The wisdom of Byatt would say that whereas the story of LaMott and Ash kindled the love of Bailey and Michell, the value of any story is now whether this tale of modern reticence to love will stimulate others to take the plunge.",1118880000,4,2131,4.997183098591549
1438817,4,B00005JKKY,"The past and the present collide in the film of director Neil LaBute, Possession. The movie offers a delicate and beautiful look to the notion of romance withtwo couples, separated by 200 years of distance.

Roland Michel (Aaron Eckhart) is a U.S teacher doing some studies in London.  While visiting the British Museum to investigate some documents of the renowned Victorian poet Randolph Henry Ash (Jeremy Northram), Roland finds an old love letter -written by the author-, to a mysterious woman.

The addressee of the letter clearly is not his wife, what suggests the poet always was not always the faithful and devout husband that everyone thought he was. More investigations take Roland to conclude that Ash had a romance with the also famous poetess Christabel LaMotte and because of this relationship, Roland seeks advice of expert Maud Bailey (Gwyneth Paltrow) to prove his theory.

At first, Maud rejects the ideas of Roland, since they would discredit her own investigative work about LaMotte, but in spite of this, she agrees to go with him around England looking for the necessary evidence. Immersed in their work, the two academics find themselves attracted to each other while they discover the truth about the romance between Ash and LaMotte.

Based from the novel of A.S. Byatt and adapted by Neil LaBute and David Hwang, Possession relates two parallel love histories. The film comes and goes elegantly between two periods of time contrasting the relations of the protagonists and the unbearable obstacles imposed in their worlds: in the past, the morality; in the present, the fear to commitment.

LaBute handles with great style and smoothness the time transitions between the two stories. The poets' relation is presented under a very romantic and idealistic light, with a certain distance, a lot of verbal flirt, charm and intensity.  The fact that both artists are betraying their couples, their true loves, reinforces the very existence of their romance.

In direct contrast, the romance of the Paltrow-Eckhart couple is brazenly contemporary, with both lovers always been defensive, living with fear to commit and hurt by prior relations.

Clearly, the movie is not a serious study of poetry, but more a cerebral romance.  LaBute is a director that obviously loves the spoken word and likes to lookup into the human weaknesses, secret and denied romances, and those ones that need to be fought. He likes to look into the love that brings with itself sacrifice and pain.  In the romantic illusions that are boosted with the minds of their protagonists.",1116547200,,2575,5.092636579572447

Roland Michell (Aaron Eckhart) and Maud Bailey (Gwyneth Paltrow), experts in English literature, discover a link between Randolph Henry Ash (Jeremy Northam) and Christabel LaMotte (Jennifer Ehle), through a letter one of them stole. As they investigate how important the link between those well-known Victorian poets was, a relationship begins to grow between them, despite the fact that neither of them was eager to start a relationship. But what are the differences between these couples?. It is easy to see that Ash and Christabel plunge into a love affair and are somehow consumed by it and its consequences. On the other hand, Ronald and Maud are so aware of the possible emotional consequences of a failed relationship that they don't want to run the risk of heartache, and thus try to avoid the ""fire"" that true passion involves.

As you probably already noticed, this film doesn't have one love story: it has two. One takes place in the Victorian period, and the other in our times, but both are closely linked. The question is: can a love affair from the past bring a modern couple together?. And if so, how, and why?. The plot is pretty simple, but well developed. The director (Neil LaBute) somehow managed to reflect the progress of both love stories at the same time, so the spectator cannot help but compare the way in which both relationships developed, and the conventions that were important in each time. I specially liked the role that the letters that Ash and Christabel sent each other (and that Roland and Maud discovered) played in the film. They were truly engaging, and the perfect complement for the uniformly good acting and the perfect English scenery.

On the whole, I think this is a good movie, but not a great one. It lacks that ""something"" that makes a viewer remember a movie well after watching it.

Also, while I usually find Gwyneth Paltrow's English accents too over the top and affected, she hit it on the mark with this film. Since doing Emma, her accent has become refined, not overly exaggerated as before.

Gwyneth Paltrow's cold disposition was right for this movie as well. I only wish the film had delved deeper into the aloofness of her character, and added some complexity to it. However, Paltrow's acting does tend to lack intensity at times.

If anything, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ekhart's relationship was too realistic. The two were constantly shown looking akward and self-conscious around each other. And their conversations were dull at best to anybody watching, but most likely interesting to themselves.

There are two romances. One, the modern tale of a handsome but turgidly acted American research student (Eckhart) and his staunchly British, beautiful blond companion (Paltrow) driving around the countryside. The other is more of an afterthought than a pursuit, the one that Paltrow and Eckhart uncover in their research, shown in a series of historical flashbacks.

The only thing that is common among these two stories -- old and modern -- is that they are both stupendously boring. Especially Paltrow and Eckhart, who often tell each other (and thus the audience) what they're feeling in over-analytic Oprah kind of terms rather than express their emotions. Despite having less screen time, both Northam and Ehle do more through looks and gestures.

For a film veering around issues of poetry and the eternal quest for human connection, there is suprisingly little of either.",1095206400,7,1102,5.214689265536723
1438874,5,B00005JKKY,"I must disagree with the scathing reviews I have read here.  I have become very jaded with movies...a long line of endless clones blending together.  This movie stood out from the crowd!

  I was totally captivated and am throughly enchanted each time I watch it.  I love the skillful way in which the producer entertwined the past with the present.  It was as though the past love affair had transcended time to envelope the modern couple. They recognized the love of the past couple and came to experience it themselves.

  I could feel how spellbound the modern couple was in discovering the details of the past, and how it affected them as a couple falling in love.  The way the new loves went to the same places and viewed the same scenery with the same awe was very well done. You could sense them moving through the same stages of their love affair, although their circumstances were different.

  I disagree that the modern couple was not perfectly cast.

They were the perfect contrast and made the victorian couple all the more entralling. I found all 4 actors/actresses completely believable and perfect for the story.  They all possessed a sensualness and passion that was quite palpable.

The love scenes were very tastefully done and not at all vulgar and explicit as some are these days.

  The first time that I saw this movie, I found myself caught up in both romances...feeling the longing, joy, and dispair of starcrossed lovers; feeling the trepidation, yet excitement,

and overwhelming pull of the new love as they discovered not only the love of the past, but their own growing love.

  I think this movie shows how love transcends time. It also shows that our lives and love impacts others sometimes in ways that we never know and lend assurance that though we are born and die, love perseveres.

  I was hooked from the first moment and wasn't bored for an instant.  I am now eager to read the book that inspired this movie.  I commend the writer for this marvel of a story; as well as the director and actors for their portrayal of this mesmerizing story.

  The scenery was breathtaking and contributed to the overall feel of sensualness and passion.

  In my opinion, this movie should win all sorts of awards.

This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time.  It left me feeling that although the victorian couple had only a short time together...they were always in love.  The modern couple learned from that past love and didn't have the same obstacles...their love was enriched by the love of the past.",1093132800,27,2540,4.7015945330296125

But everything that happened in the modern romance was just awful.  I really didn't care about either of the main characters.  I didn't care if they got together, I didn't really care about them at all.  Except when they found new information about the Victorian romance, which is a wonderful story.

I really wish this had just been a movie about Ash and LaMotte and their relationship.  The modern story is just bad.  But the older one is very good, well-developed and interesting.

1438879,4,B00005JKKY,"One of the marks (and pleasures) of a talented filmmaker is in the works that tend to break away from their established genre and stretch their skills in a direction previously unexplored. One could list several such examples, the most obvious being Steven Spielberg growing up with the release of Schindler's List. Although nowhere near that scale, Neil LaBute's Possession fits neatly into that category.
Perhaps best known for the disturbing (some would say misogynistic) In The Company of Men and the dark reality (some would say sociopathic) Your Friends & Neighbors, Possession provides LaBute with some variations. For one thing, it's the first film he's made not based on his own original work, the source material instead coming from the popular novel by A.S. Byatt. Also, there are elements of period drama involved, most decidedly a departure from the modern focus of his previous films.
Disclaimer:  I read the book only after I saw the film so I'm not going to base this review on any aspect of it except to say I highly recommend it as well.
Possession is the story of two modern literary scholars, played by Gwyneth Paltrow and LaBute regular Aaron Eckhart, who together try to uncover the hidden relationship between a 19th-century poet laureate, played by Jeremy Northam, and a lesser poet played by Jennifer Ehle. As they uncover more and more clues, their own relationship begins to take on the characteristics of the one they are studying. It sounds much simpler than it actually is, as the plot also involves something akin to a heated scholarly competition to discover the truth, but that is very much secondary to the two relationships. The film shifts back and forth between time periods, and some of the overall highlights involve the clever means by which these transitions are carried out.
The look of the film is magnificent, with the contrast between the Victorian era and modern times very clearly demarcated -- the Victorians live in a lush, richly colorful world while the present-day scholars work in an almost antiseptic academic setting. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why Northam's and Ehle's characters come across as so much more believable than Paltrow's and Eckhart's. All the performances are decent, at least to the point where they don't distract from the film, but Paltrow's character is established as too much of a cold fish to allow the audience to believe that she could actually give herself so completely to Eckhart, no matter how likeable and studly he is. On the other hand, Northam and Ehle generate an onscreen passion that appears not only genuine, but deeply moving when circumstances remove their affair from their own control. This is another feather in LaBute's cap -- a true love story from a man whose debut film chronicled cruel toying with a stranger's emotions.
Though somewhat underrated, Possession has many of the attributes of a film that will stand the test of time. Not only does it have romance between very attractive personas, but it also has enough of a plot and clever cinematic tricks to hold interest for the entire length of the film.",1084838400,5,3116,4.935238095238096
1438880,5,B00005JKKY,"Don't expect this to be a faithful rendering of the book, because it's not a weeklong mini-series, it's a 2-hour feature film.  It captures the spirit, magic, passion and obsession of the novel while thankfully stripping away much that is boring and slow.  I loved the novel, but that was despite its flaws.  I would never re-read it as I have true masterpieces like Middlemarch, but I've seen Possession three times and fall more and more in love with it.  Every performance is perfect.",1084752000,6,487,4.761904761904762
1438881,2,B00005JKKY,"Neil LaBute's adaptation of A. S. Byatt's novel is far slighter than it needs to be.  LaBute and co-writers Jones and Hwang wisely ditch most of the poetry and don't even attempt to stage a lot of what Byatt wrote, but in paring the story back to ""the essentials"" they've forgotten most of what makes it a good one.  The Ash-LaMotte romance is ultimately a conventional Victorian tale of adultery, illegitimacy and suicide, but what really makes the novel sing is Byatt's take on contemporary academics: their cut-throat competitiveness, blinkered theorizing, personal obsessions and hunger for fame. These are the energies which drive the plot, and without them nothing interesting is at stake.  LaBute's film winds up being just two drippy love stories and some lovely sets.  I guess this is partly because he makes Roland too strong, sidelines Cropper (who could have been a devilish villain), and axes most of the other amusing characters: lesbian-feminist Leonora Stern, the motherly Beatrice Nest, and Roland's hilariously bitter partner, Val (a role made for Helena Bonham-Carter if ever there was one).  He seems to have decided that a love story involving two attractive and recognisable American stars is more likely to engage an audience.  The boxoffice returns suggest otherwise. Moreover, LaBute's version fails to capitalise on the inherent visual drama of many of the novel's key sequences, such as the seance and the stormy grave robbing near the end.  The result is a film that feels stilted, reverential, fatally cautious and underdone.  It has none of the wit and spark that makes the book come alive.  In the hands of a capable comic-drama writer, like Richard Curtis (""Love Actually""), it could have been superb.  The cast is good, and much of the little pleasure the film does bring comes from the performances.  Gwyneth Paltrow is surprisingly effective as Maud, and Tobey Stephens nails Fergus Wolfe perfectly.  Aaron Eckhart is the only exception.  Not only is the decision to make Roland an American a bad one, to then cast Eckhart is bordering on ludicrous.  This is one case where a director's friendship with an actor is to the detriment of the film.",1084579200,5,2179,5.0334261838440115

It's entertaining enough, with a diverting performance by Paltrow and a strangely magnetic turn by Aaron Eckhardt. He's hardly believable as an academic, but interesting to watch nonetheless. The period interludes don't fare as well, with Jennifer Ehle making the choice to act only with adoring glances--she seems to think that looking like she belongs in the 19th century is enough. Jeremy Northam is hot as usual, but the whole romance falls flat. The director makes the wise choice to trim a lot of the academic skullduggery and bad poetry of the book, but the scraps of story and atmosphere that are left never hang together. Altogether, not worth a buy, but worth a rental if you're in the mood for something without sex or violence and a few nice shots of the English countryside.",1082592000,3,881,4.841059602649007

1438937,2,B00005JKKY,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did.  The previews I saw made it look erotically charged, the blurb on the box described it as a 'literary mystery'--right up my street as a literature major with some knowledge of the Victorians--and two of my favorite British actors, Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle, are featured.  Gwyneth Paltrow is in the spotlight now with her baby and wedding news, and I hadn't seen any of her recent work.  So, I settled in with a chai latte, and high expectations for a sexy, literate urbane thriller.
While the premise of the film--two modern-day literary scholars who are academic competitors unravelling a secret, passionate love affair between two famous (and long dead) Victorian poets and falling for each other in the process--is intriguing, the movie never takes flight and realizes its potential.  It goes wrong from the start with the casting of Aaron Eckhart as Gwyneth's fellow partner in literary crime.  Mr. Eckhart is not without talent as an actor (for proof, see his turn as Renee Zellweger's boorish, cheating car dealer husband in 'Nurse Betty'), but he can't pull off a romantic leading man part, especially one who is supposed to be intellectual.  He's not a bad-looking guy in empirical terms, but he is definetely out of his element opposite Gwyneth Paltrow, doing her usual regally severe ice-queen bit again. Her British accent, though well-done is getting wearing . . .she plays three Brits to every American character, and a British accent does nothing to increase her non-existent warmth and accessibility in this role.  The scene where Paltrow and Eckhart's characters, Maud and Mitchell, find themselves sharing the same room in a countryside inn that was inhabited by the Victorian lovers a century and a half prior, and make out in the cramped bed is the most uncomfortable love scene I've ever sat through (and that includes Mickey Rourke's movies!).  Paltrow and Eckhart have zero chemistry, and watching them mash their faces together as called for by the script makes for painful viewing.  Until now I thought that Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant had achieved zero chemistry in 'Notting Hill', but I was wrong.
Jennifer Ehle and Jeremy Northam play the Victorian lovers, and even though their scenes are regrettably brief, their chemistry together is unmistakable.  What a shame they didn't do 'Possession' as a straight Victorian romance and let this pair have the screen the whole time.
As someone else pointed out, 'The French Lieutetant's Woman' with Meryl Streep and Jeremy Irons is a much better example of parallel love stories.  I can't help wondering what Ehle and Northam might have been able to achieve if they'd also been allowed to play the modern lovers.  Or at least let Mr. Northam take the Eckhart part--he and Ms. Paltrow were wonderful together in 1996's 'Emma' . . .no doubts about their chemistry together in that film.
If you are a fan of all things English, 'Possession' does have some beautiful exterior scenes of countryside and old manor houses, and as noted by others, the director does achieve some clever and subtle transitions between the two eras.  But on the whole, 'Possession' will leave you decidedly . . .dispossessed.",1071100800,13,3219,4.983208955223881
1438938,3,B00005JKKY,"I really liked the adaptation of A.S. Byatt's  ANGELS AND INSECTS and I was hoping the film vertsion of A.S. Byatt's  POSSESSION would be equally satisfying but it's not. The story is irresistable to English lit types like myself. One day while going through a literay archive a research assisstant finds an original letter written by a famous Victorian poet tucked between the pages of an old book.  The letter is a love letter to an unknown lover which is doubly surprising since the poet was thought to have been a devoted husband. The research assistant immediately understands the importance of the letter and so he takes it with the intent of using it to determine just who the poet may have been writing to.  Meanwhile the poet is the subject of a major retrospective and anything related to him is fetching high prices at auction so the letter has not only literary value but monetary value as well and so once the existence of the letter is made known intrigue soon follows it wherever it goes.  This should have been a really easy movie to make because its got everything from romance to suspense. Unfortunately a bit of miscasting ruins the film right away. Aaron Eckhart is a scruffy blonde American and he is cast as a scruffy blonde American. But the role requires depth and passion for literature as well and Eckhart conveys neither. This actor also has a noted lack of passion for his co-star, Gwyneth Paltrow. This makes both actors look bad. Given a proper co-star Paltrow would have given a stellar performance but she has no one to act with. Eckhart just isn't right. Hes a good looking guy but he looks out of place in a library and he looks bored when hes next to Gwyneth and so we get bored with him.  When he crosses paths with Paltrow we are supposed to believe she falls for him precisely because he's not English and so presumably has fewer hang-ups than the uptight restrained Englishmen she usually dates but on the contrary he has more hang-ups than anyone in the film.  Maybe she falls for him because he is not intellectually complicated(just emotionally wounded), that would be a reasonable explanation but whatever the reason the chemistry simply is not there. It looks like Eckhart and Paltrow don't want to kiss and so its just awkward to watch them force themselves on each other for the camera. Eckhart hasn't yet learned how to convey a variety of emotions, he always has the same lackadaisical (perhaps self-absorbed) look on his scruffy face.
On the other hand, as virtually every other reviewer has noted, the Victorian love affair between the poet Randolph Ash and his lover Christobel LaMotte which we see acted out as the researchers uncover each strand of their story is very nice and convincing and satisfying. But be warned these period scenes are brief in comparison with the modern scenes. And unfortunately the very competent acting done by the period performers just makes the modern pair look all the more lost when we return to the present tense.
 As an alternative to this I would suggest renting THE FRENCH LIEUTENANTS WOMAN (Meryl Streep & Jeremy Irons)instead to those viewers who really want to see a great film which contrasts love and art in two distinct time periods. Or if you are an A.S. Byatt fan I would suggest renting ANGELS AND INSECTS.",1068508800,11,3305,4.715771230502599

The director eliminated characters, combined scenes, and failed to convey on screen the passion and pain that drive the story.  Aaron Eckhart is totally miscast as Roland Mitchell--Jeremy Northam, who plays Randolph Henry Ash, would have been better in Eckhart's role.  Mitchell is supposed to be a scruffy, shabby academic, but he looks, according to a good friend of mine, like he just stepped out of a J. Crew catalogue. (Well, that, and Eckhart is a lousy actor.) Mortimer Cropper, who is so devilishly evil in the book, lacks development.  He's the type of guy you just love to hate, but in the movie version, he's not nearly as nasty as he should be.  Gwyneth Paltrow and the actress who plays Cristabel LaMotte (her name escapes me--she played Elizabeth Bennett in ""Pride and Prejudice"") save the film.

1438940,1,B00005JKKY,"Gwyneth Paltrow needs to sit herself down!!
Jennifer Ehle and Jeremy Northam's performances, though strong, cannot save this sentimental and unengaging film from itself. Cliche blends into cliche and it's a definite 30 minutes too long. Paltrow plays a boring English-rose type, (Sliding Doors? Shakespeare in Love?) on the shelf because of her work commitments. She's in a failing relationship. Enter Aaron Eckhart, the young American upstart, who ignites the fires of passion in her cold little heart. Their romance blossoms as they trace the relationship between Randolph Ash (Northam), a famed 18th century Poet, who had an affair with the lesser-known lesbian poetess,  Christabel LaMotte (Ehle).
Blah blah blah.
The direction is stagey and flat, and at one point, thanks to some very dodgy background music, the film much resembles an advertisement for the Yorkshire Tourism Board. There's also a particularly memorable key scene involving antique dolls, that's really laughable, thanks to its utter ridiculousness and unbelievable setting. Eckhart is little more than a token Phallus to Paltrow, who whines and bleats her way through all 103 minutes of the movie. In fact, so joy-absorbing is Paltrow's performance in this movie that it totally detracts from Eckhart and the wonderful Jennifer Ehle, who, by themselves, have a decent chemistry and generate the only high point of this otherwise boring picture.
For romantic melodrama, check out classics like 'Now, Voyager', or contemporary pieces like 'Muriel's Wedding', for the comedy angle. 'Possession' will fester where it deserves to be, and in a year's time, people will have forgotten it ever existed.

1438941,5,B00005JKKY,"""Possession"" is one of the most romantic movies I have ever seen, alongside Tom Tykwer's ""Heaven."" A double-edged tale of love, passion, and words that can entice or betray, this is one of the few masterful films that actually brought tears to my eyes. Wonderful acting, beautiful direction, and one of the most amazing love stories ever seen in a movie.
Roland Michell (Aaron Eckhart), a brash young American scholar,  is studying an old book of the famed poet William Randolph Ash when he encounters an old love letter. After some digging, he theorizes that it was addressed to the more obscure poet Christabel LaMonte -- but both poets were either married or in a long-term relationship. If he's right, it would rock the literary world. He seeks the help of Maud Bailey, a cold feminist scholar who has a particular fondness for Christabel's work. Maud tries to bring him down to earth by explaining that Christabel was a lesbian, but Roland is undaunted.
They travel to Christabel's old home and unearth a cache of letters between Ash and Christabel, hidden away by her lover. It tells of a love affair that was doomed from the start: The correspondence first inspired respect, then friendship, then a burning love. Finally, Ash (Jeremy Northam) and Christabel (Jennifer Ehle) escape to the countryside for a few weeks alone. Those few weeks will mar the rest of their lives...
Like all adaptations, ""Possession"" strays a bit from its original work (Roland is made American rather than English, many supporting characters are omitted). But the spirit and tone of the story are close to the book. The core of the story is words. Words that are hidden and words that reveal, words that could change a person's life or perceptions -- depending on whether they are read by the one they are intended for. Even the name of a little child can change a man's life, and his perception of the woman he loves.
But more than that, it's an illustration of love in its different forms: There is the passion of the soulmates, Ash and Christabel; and there is the gradual warming and closeness between Maud and Roland. As Randolph Ash says, ""There are many kinds of love."" Even though the modern love story is okay by movie standards, it's pale and insubstantial compared to the Victorian love story. (Maybe this is because Maud and Roland have the POSSIBILITY of  a deep attachment, whereas Ash and Christabel have full-fledged, undeniable feelings). This film isn't afraid to show love in all its glory and beauty, its pain and intensity.
The direction is beautiful and stately, with the shots of waterfalls and majestic old houses. And Neil LaBute is amazing at choreographing little hints of tension and attraction. He handles the shifting from one era to another expertly; one wonderful scene pans away from Maud and Roland, to rest on Christabel.
Aaron Eckhart does a solid job as Roland; he's pretty charming and twinkly-eyed, but not outstanding. Gwyneth Paltrow has a little trouble making Maud sympathetic, but she manages it (sort of). It's Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle who steal the show. They radiate emotion, so much so that merely glancing at one another has significance and substance. Lena Heady and Holly Aird also give moving, if brief, performances as Blanche Glover (Christabel's ex-lover) and Ellen Ash (Ash's wife).
This is a movie for lovers and true romantics, those who can appreciate the beauty of the love story. While not perfect, it's a haunting and beautiful story, one of the most moving romantic movies I've ever seen. Highly recommended.",1063324800,84,3563,4.907131011608624
1438942,2,B00005JKKY,"The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the redeeming force of Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle who portrayed the poets Ash and LaMotte. Otherwise, I was rather dissapointed with this adaptation of A.S. Byatt's ""Possession: A Romance"". It could have been SO, SO much richer in the hands of, say, A&E Home Video (who brought us ""Pride and Prejudice"" with Colin Firth) where it could have breathed for the full 5 hours it would need to properly portray this novel.
LaBute was not totally without some servicable directing in this film (i.e the footage of Ash and LaMotte) but what WAS he thinking when he cast Aaron Eckhart as Roland Michel?! Part of the romance of the book is in its assured Victorian ""English-ness"" (both past and present) and the subtle mirroring of the relationships between Ash/LaMotte and Michel/Bailey. Eckhart as a brash, petulant, swaggering, American ""cowboy"" does not mirror the subtle, deep, passionate, conflicted, yet gentlemanly Ash, nor does he compliment Paltow's Bailey.
Finally, where was the poetry? Where was Melusina? Where were the gods and the fae? Besides the metaphorical poetry (which ONLY occurred between Northam and Ehle), where were the beautiful verses around which Byatt's ""romance"" revolved?

I was interested to see how Aaron Eckhart would pull off the role of an intellectual (and he does hold his own quite well) and Gwynneth Paltrow nicely underplays her character.
This is a thinking-person's movie -- as noted by other reviewers, one does need to pay attention as the clues that drive the plot are quietly revealed without much ""here's a plot-point"" fanfare within the script.

My personal favourite is CATHY'S CURSE.  A little girl is possessed by her aunt, Cathy, who died in a car crash with her father after they were abandoned by her brother and mother.  Cathy now seeks revenge on all women (and some men).  The first 20 minutes are boring, but once the girl gets possessed it becomes nonstop, fun-filled, unintentional comedy as she does such evil things as get an old man stinking drunk, plays with an evil doll and talks in weird voices.  Meanwhile her mother gets hysterical (THE funniest bad acting I've seen in ages) while the clueless father just gets confused.  Bad special effects also abound (just try to guess how the girl teleports around!).  Unfortunately the print is not very good, but it is watchable and I don't know of anywhere else to find this wonderful gem, which deserves a cult following.  This one alone is worth the price.
""GOD TOLD ME TO"" are the last words spoken by a sniper who has just randomly killed a dozen people as he lies dying.  Other seemingly normal citizens (including a cop played by Andy Kaufmann!) also begin committing murders, uttering the same words when asked why they did it.  This film by Larry (It's Alive, Return to Salem's Lot) Cohen is uneven, but is spooky and will freak you out, especially the scenes where the investigating cop confronts ""God"".  Great print, letterboxed.  Also worth the price by itself.
THE GHOST is a gothic tale in the vein of Corman's Poe adaptations, but without Vincent Price or psychedelic dream sequences.  A bit slow, but very atmospheric and ultimately worthwhile, and with a great performance by Barbara Steele.  Picture quality isn't great, but has a nice midnight movie quality to it.  The first short scene is slightly out of order (apparently to open the film with credits that should have begun a minute in), so you see the end of a seance before it begins.
GOOD VERSUS EVIL, the weakest entry, is a pilot for a series that never happened.  Basically, Satanists raise a nice,normal girl without telling her she is expected to bear Satan's child  (the same mistake as in End of Days: Why not just raise her to look forward to this role instead of keeping her in the dark?).  Their plans are messed up when she and an author fall in love.  The series was to be about him teaming up with an exorcist to rescue her and battle the Satanists.  The villain seems promising, but all you get is a setup for the nonexistent series and a lame exorcism scene (a family friendly copy of scenes from ""The Exorcist"").  Good picture quality, but a completely unsatisfying film.",1054598400,3,2705,4.6547368421052635
1438993,2,B00005JKKY,"The comparisons with the English Patient will come up. Possession the book and the English Patient the book both won the most prestigious prize in the English Commonwealth, the Booker Prize. Both are deeply moving. Both are romances between people of different classes or nations. Since the English Patient made a heckuva good movie, they must have figured that Possession would too. To my mind Possession was the superior book because its emotional punch was much more intense. You'd figure therefore that Possession would make a better movie.
You would be wrong. The film of the English Patient takes a theme of the book (that aristocrats are really stuck in teenage rut) and turns it into a Wagnerian opera, complete with smoldering stares and obsessive stalking, topped off with a heavy dosage of death. The film of Possession is a silly soap opera. The characters make banal misinterpretations of each other that we are familiar with from daytime television and someone figured this would give us suspense. Where the book's modern-day romance climaxes with the glorious orgasm of a woman who at last knows what she wants, the film ends with characters hugging and kissing. That's a threshold? Give me a break. And the historical romance isn't half as Derridian as it's supposed to be, since they haven't discussed male and female naturecultures. ""A letter always finds its destination"" said Lacan. Derrida agrees with some heavy provisos. (""A letter always finds its destination, provided its destination is nowhere."") Where I was crying at the end of Possession the book, I was left wondering what on Earth they were thinking with the film.
As for the acting. Mostly good, given that everyone is hemmed in by a redundant plot line. I'm still obsessessed with Gwyneth Paltrow and I'll see as many of her films as I can. Too bad this isn't Shakespeare in Love.",1054339200,7,1864,4.958466453674121
1438994,1,B00005JKKY,"Those unfamiliar with the A.S. Byatt novel on which this film is based may find Possession to be nothing more than incompetent, a stunningly dull costume drama in which energy and effort seem to have been expended only upon the costumes.
If we look a little closer we may note that the film doesn't include an actual scene (you know, more than a couple lines of dialog, more than a minute long, no dodgy explanatory voiceover from hundreds of years in the future...) until nearly an hour in. We may notice that director LaBute has somehow kneecapped his theoretically excellent cast in a manner that can only be compared to George Lucas' inexplicable mugging of Natalie Portman and Liam Neeson -- and LaBute manages this without a greenscreen or casting Jar Jar Binks.
But those who have read Possession will recognize something more sinister that mere incompetence afoot here. Doubless the lengthy and poetry-heavy Possession is a tough tome to adapt for film, but why would LaBute and listed co-scenarist David Henry Hwang take the book's most distinctive character, awkward British scholar Roland, and turn him into some kind of smug, swaggering, American action movie wiseacre? Why take the completely original Maude and Roland romance and transform it into beat-by-beat Hollywood romantic comedy/drama sludge? And to add insult to injury, why have timid Roland indulge in some (then) untimely French-baiting, as if he was along for National Lampoon's European Vacation?
LaBute and Hwang, respected playwrights, surely cannot have written this scenario. In paying close attention we detect the distinctive script-doctoring of ""Adaptation"" co-scribe Donald Kaufman. Only Kaufman's particular flair for ""finding the story"" could have turned such a distinctive novel into this generic Hollywood swill, as cynical as it is incompetent.",1053302400,11,1835,5.309278350515464

Scholarship is confounded with the spectacle of lying cheats and pretentious [imitations] (literally) digging up dirt, with the avidity and indecency of news reporters chasing a career-making scoop. The script gives almost no sense of the potential value of their find, and Paltrow and Eckhart's characters are so emotionally stunted that they wouldn't know a great love story if they uncovered one. And they don't. The Victorian affair they unearth so diligently is sheer literary melodrama -- the Barretts of Wimpole Street spiced up with Lesbianism and adultery, as phony as Eckhart's perpetual two-day beard.  The major Victorian poet is a droopy-eyed pup. The minor Victorian poetess is irresponsibility personified. When her abandoned female lover takes desperate measures, she blames the male poet and punishes him with breathtaking cruelty. Of course, it's not necessary for characters to be admirable for a film to be. The problem with Possession is that the audience is clearly expected to admire characters who cannot be taken seriously. Of course, it may be that I fled academia because this is how academics truly are, what scholarship has truly become, and what poetry has been reduced to.

1438996,4,B00005JKKY,"""Possession"" is one of those movies where as soon as it is over you want to go out and read the novel upon which it is based the better to be able to enjoy the full tapestry of the story.  Reading A. S. Byatt's 1990 Booker Prize-winning novel would also allow you to better appreciate the adaptation by David Henry Hwang, Laura Jones and director Neil LaBute, which offers some interesting and creative approaches, both in terms of the story and how it is portrayed cinematically.
The story is essentially a romantic mystery.  American Roland Michell (Aaron Eckhart) is working as an assistant to a literature professor in London doing research on Randolph Henry Ash (Jeremy Northam), a poet Laureate during the reign of Queen Victoria.  Roland discovers some letters from Ash that suggest the poet, a paragon of devotion with regards to his wife, had a romantic relationship with Christabel LaMotte (Jennifer Ehle), a minor poet and apparent lesbian, at least according to the historical record that exists.  Roland enlists Maud Bailey (Gwyneth Paltrow), a English scholar who studies LaMotte, and the two begin their journey as literary detectives.
Of course a romantic relationship will develop between Roland and Maud as they are caught up in revealing the past of Randolph and Christabel.  However, I have to admit that I was much more interested in the detective work unlocking the secrets of the lovers from the past than the slowly developing romance between the two scholars.  Actually, I was much more interested in the romance of the two lovers in the past rather than in the present.  This is not only because my academic interests are extremely sympathetic with unraveling the meaning of ancient texts, but also because the two poets have more hurdles to overcome in the romance department.  After all, Eckhart and Paltrow are so good looking that their physical union is no more in doubt than their intellectual coming together.  This film might actually have benefited from having less better looking leds in terms of this particular story.
LaBute gets points for the rather seamless way that he shifts back and forth between the past and the present as letters and locations allow us to slip back and forth between the two.  I also have a real affection for films that still do the old trick of having stage hands move things around so that a total transformation is achieved on a set within a single panning shot back and forth.  But what makes ""Possession"" so memorable is the powerful final scene and the haunting final shot, which is where this 2002 film achives its own sense of the poetic.
I am hard pressed to explain why I am only giving this film four stars given how much I like it; my best guess is because the film is only 102 minutes long and because this is a literary adaptation I cannot help but think this is the abridged version.  There are a few deleted scenes available on the DVD, but they do not indicate anything substantial missing from the film.  I also wanted to lose myself more in the story of Randolph and Christabel, and the Victorian world in which they lived.  I really liked this film, but what I really wanted was to love it.",1051574400,31,3175,4.738656987295826

Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart were believable as the 2 present day people trying to piece together a mystery from the past.

1438999,4,B00005JKKY,"""No mere human can stand in a fire and not be consumed.""

While doing research in the British Museum, Roland Michell (Aaron Eckhart) discovers letters written by Randolph Ash who had an affair with a lesser-known poetess, Christabel LaMotte.

Maud Bailey (Gwyneth Paltrow) knows Christabel's poems by heart and Randolph seeks her out as an expert to help him figure out why a ""chaste spinster"" and the ""married Randolph Ash"" never revealed their love to the world. He has one clue, a love letter.

Christabel and Randolph's love is based on a common love of literature and intellectual discussions, poetry and passion. They are like minds that somehow connected and together they find immense happiness despite their circumstances. Although they fight their attraction to one another, they eventually create a world of turmoil and tragedy.

Gwyneth and Aaron have a subtle chemistry but it is not ""quite"" the mingling of spirits that occurs with Christabel (Jennifer Ehle) and Randolph (Jeremy Northam) and yet there are enough sparks to keep them interested.

""I want to see if there is an us in you and me.""

Is passion worth the turmoil and upheaval? Is this the tangle most people want? While the story of the poets is only a memory, Maud and Roland are just starting their journey and are fortunately single when they meet.

Maud and Roland lurk about in divine libraries searching for clues and discover old letters and journals. They are intoxicated by the thought that they can actually solve this mystery. They must conceal their true purpose while searching for clues.

They spend time reading the letters to each other, which is the most romantic ""modern"" part of this movie. The Victorian ""flash backs"" are much more entertaining on all levels.

The Victorian romance in this movie is wonderful, but the modern romance is much more subtle. Yet, who would not want to have a man read you poetry in bed?

Adapted from A.S. Byatt's novel by the same name. The movie is not the passionate fire the name suggests. However, this movie will possess you intellectually from start to finish.

Thoughtful Romance with an element of mystery.

1439000,5,B00005JKKY,"'possession' is the tender trap, a tonic for a lovesick mind.
i watched 'possession' time and time again at the cinema; head up, front row. i watch the DVD whenever i can; it is a privelege to be able to own a copy.
since the cast and the screenplay are so fatefully interlinked, i shall say, in my view the casting was superb. jeremy northam has all the qualities of a respectable poet laureate, and the sexual appeal to match that of jennifer ehle, his leading lady.
aaron ekhart, i notice in other reviews, has been much maligned as not being the equal of gwyneth paltrow. i simply dismiss that sort of talk. the point of mr ekhart's character is that he feels inferior, to be looked down on by maud bailey (paltrow) and this is the impression the viewer recieves, from the first images of roland mitchell (ekhart) working studiously, to the dramatic realisation of maud bailey's ancestory.
the film is split across two generations; but they are seamlessly linked. Neil LaBute's film is a triumph, the beauty of which shall be revered for many generations to come.
it is a 'feel-good' film, to make one long for love.",1049241600,5,1120,4.605

Why oh why did the producers/writers have to change Roland into being an American?  I'm American, but it totally disrupts the romance between the two leads, and he was not a thief to the extent portrayed in the film.  Awful.
Jennifer Ehle is magic.  She brings as much passion and life to this character as she did to Lizzie in Pride and Prejudice!  Only Colin Firth could have improved the sensational love story here between the two poets.
The actor who portrayed Randolph Henry Ash was lost in Jennifer Ehle's performance. She so overshadowed him.

1439032,4,B00005JKKY,"I remember the wonderful coming attractions for this movie and couldn't wait to see it.  As a fan of A&E, the BBC and Masterpiece Theatre, this film looked like it had everything I love about a movie.  Well, it never came to my town and I now know why.  First of all, the director changed the book (which of course is his prerogative).  But to totally rewrite a part, and making it worse, well that is butchery.  To substitute an intelligent, gentle, ENGLISH academician for a phlegmatic, AMERICAN is almost heretical, even if he is one of your best friends.  And his 5-day beard stubble during the entire movie did nothing for me. The casting of Aaron Eckhart as the poet intern Roland Mitchell was ludicrous.  He acted like he was bored during the entire movie.  There was no spark, not even when making incredible discoveries, nor with his scenes with Paltrow.  Gweneth Paltrow portrayed English Professor Maude Bailey as an ice maiden (using her grating nasal English accent).  There was no charisma between these two and I was very bored during all of their scenes, of which there were too many.
Now, the redeeming qualities; the reasons to watch this film:  Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth Bennett of Pride and Prejudice) as Christabel Lamotte and her secret lover, Randolph Ash, who is played by Jeremy Northam (the handsome star of many period pieces).  The passion between these two accomplished actors is palatable.  Even the cinematography (of the flashback scenes) was extraordinary.  Their story showed an entire range of believable emotions; passion, love, pain, and loss.  For the brief moments that these two were on the screen, my heart soared.  Because of their charisma, I really ended up loving this movie.  I would have loved it even more if this film sent all the 21st century to the cutting room floor.",1048204800,6,1818,4.831715210355987

Byatt novel from which it was adapted -- and I think I was not disappointed because I knew that would be the case. Another reviewer said that the portions set in the 19th century were the best parts, and I agree. Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle are outstanding as the lovers who will only be allowed a brief time together. Ms. Ehle is a wonderfully talented actress (as far as I am concerned, she is the definitive Elizabeth Bennett)with a face that accurately registers emotions so that the viewer is never in doubt as to what the character is feeling or thinking. Jeremy Northam is excellent -- it was his skill as an actor that kept the final scene in the movie from being maudlin. I thought Gwyneth Paltrow did an adequate job in the role of Maud, as it was written for the screen. However, Aaron Eckhart was a poor choice for Paltrow's romantic interest and fellow-academic. I didn't for one minute believe he was a student of 19th century British literature; I thought at first I was being influened by his performance as the biker-lover in ""Erin Brockovitch,"" but the truth is that he just wasn't convincing and seemed uncomfortable in the role. The British countryside was lovely, the story is interesting and romantic, and due to Northam and Ehle I recommend this DVD as a nice way to spend the evening.

However, it was much better, smarter and more faithful than I expected.  Despite the totally unnecessary Americanizing of Roland, I enjoyed the film.  I liked Gwyneth Paltrow as Maude; she actually looks much as I visualized Maude.
But the real stars were Jennifer Ehle and Jeremy Northram as Christabel and Randolph Henry Ash.  They captured the passion and desperation that I think these two people would have felt in that situation.  They made the film work.  The best moments with the modern lovers came when they were in the process of uncovering the truth.  You could feel a little of the crack of excitement that intellectual discovery arouses in some people.  Films don't often capture that.
The cinematography was lovely, and the juxtapositions between the Victorian lovers and the modern academics was very well done.  I particularly liked the moments when the camera panned in a continuous shot from the past to the present, and vice versa.

1439037,3,B00005JKKY,"""Possession"" is an interesting film, if not completely engaging.  One assumes that director Neil Labute cast Aaron Eckhart because he's also starred in the director's other films ""In the Company of Men,"" ""Your Friends & Neighbors"" & ""Nurse Betty.""  Unfortunately, while the two men obviously enjoy working together, Gweneth Paltrow and Eckhart do not have the screen chemistry to pull off a convincing romance.  Thus, the film suffers with the present far less convincing than the past.  Jeremy Northern who I enjoyed as Dean Martin in the TV movie ""Martin & Lewis"" and in ""Gosford Park"" is utterly dreamy-eyed as poet Randolph Henry Ash smitten by Christabel LaMotte.  Ash who is apparently faithful in a sexless marriage gets his hormones honed when haunting the lesbian LaMotte's daydreams.  Jennifer Ehle who is actress Rosemary Harris' daughter must have watched Meryl Streep in ""French Lieutenant's Woman."" The costumer who drapes her in a flowing anorak also mimics Meryl's attire.  However, the searing intensity of Ehle's performance is hauntingly original and effective as she leaves her lesbian lover for the poet, bearing a child in France.  Lena Heady as the lesbian Blanche Glover isn't given a lot to do; but she does drown herself exceptionally well.  Paltrow's Maud Bailey is studied and controlled.  I found her British accent as endearing as it was convincing.  As the script is written with Eckhart the American scholar and Paltrow as the reserved British researcher, the romance more hinges on Eckhart who seems more smitten with himself than with Paltrow.  I kept wishing he would shave.  The film does have interesting elements as the mystery of the past unravels, but the pacing does bog a bit in the present as the leads allow much anxiety about their lovemaking.  All in all, I found this an intelligent and enjoyable piece, more remarkable for the past than the present.  The DVD does not offer much in the way of bonus materials, just the theatrical trailer and director's commentary.  With possession being nine-tenths of the law, this would be one I might enjoy owning to revisit the past.  Enjoy!",1046995200,3,2127,5.048710601719198

1439039,4,B00005JKKY,"Having read the book before coming to the movie, I suppose I might be a bit biased in this review.  However, I was quite impressed by the judicious adaptation of A.S. Byatt's very complex novel.  The film simplified some of the minor sub-plots while being true to the gist of the story.  It could have been much worse.
Then again, it could have been better.  I thought the decision to turn Roland into an American was unnecessary and the determination of the screenwriters to add comments about him being American in every scene was a bit much.  Roland also had changed...he was no longer the gentle self-effacing young scolar who discovers his latent talent for poetry, but had become charismatic, forward, even flirty.  Why couldn't they have left poor Roland alone?  The screenwriters evidently thought that the real, underachieving Roland wasn't good enough for U.S. audiences.
All in all, the ""modern"" romance with Maud Bailey and Roland Mitchell was unsatisfying.  Their best moments were when they were caught up in the excitement of shared intellectual discovery.  I love the part when they discover Christobel's letters and you can just see the wheels in Maud's mind turning.  When they turned towards each other, however, the romance was sadly unconvincing.
Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle, however, succeeded admirably in their portrayal of Randolph Ash and Christobel Lamotte.  The moment they first set eyes on each other you could see the trembling in Ash's face and the KNOWING in Christobel's when they realize that their fate has arrived.  Jennifer Ehle seemed to completely capture the essence of Christobel!  I had imagined her mouth just so...a little tight, a little ironic.  Their restrained, then released passion for each other was very well done...it made the movie worthwhile.
Some very beautiful devices for switching between the Victorians and the moderns - the juxtaposition of the two time periods was well integrated and helped to give the sense of ""possession""; those steps had been walked before.

I'm just generally a big fan of movies and I love seeing the characters I've imagined come to life with someone else's creative eye.  And this movie could have been so great--which made it that much more painful to watch what was in fact created.  The changes they made to the book to create this movie only took away from the story and characters.
For instance, in the novel Roland is a very British obsessive poetic historian in an unfulfilling relationship with a bitter girlfriend and they live in a tiny dank apartment below an old lady with lots of cats whose depressing life scares him and who doesn't let them go into her garden to breathe fresh air.  In the movie they made him like the men in a dozen sitcoms, condemning of love after a bunch of bad relationships, single, living in an apartment below a rich bachelor, and worst of all--they made him American. Why change the character so drastically?  The Roland of the book had depth while the Roland of the movie was purely superficial.  And Roland's not the only one--the only characters who had nearly as much depth in the movie as the ones in the book were Ash and Christobel.
Once you make the changes in character, changes in story line are inevitable.  There was no tension and intimacy in their trip to Yorkshire.  There was no excitement in their trip to France.  There was no joy in the final discovery, no moodiness given to the grave digging scene, no edge of your seat anticipation in the chase for the last piece of the mystery.  They took out all the details that would have made all these events have real meaning.
The fact is that Possession is a complicated book with a lot to try to portray in a movie.  But I can't help but think if say Merchant Ivory or Robert Altman did it, they could have conveyed so much more in the time they had.

The mystery that is set up by the author in the 1900 love story is much more mysterious in the book. There is no mystery in the movie. The audience is handed the answers before the questions. The book's wealth is found in the character's contemplation about life's meaning, whereas the movie takes this out and replaces it with the protagonists having a whiney discussion about why life is unfair.  In the book, the protagonists are in love with their research and they slowly fall in love with one another, in the movie the immediately fall in love and their passions for their subjects.

The story follows two parallel love stories one set around 1900 and the other around 1980, both set around Britain.
