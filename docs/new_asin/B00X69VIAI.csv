7159380,1,B00X69VIAI,As absurd movies the previous ones were entertaining but this one has a rigid political agenda and that is disgusting,1444608000,,117,4.9
7159381,5,B00X69VIAI,"This movie is the pinnacle of entertainment ! Hands-down the most fun, entertaining movie I have watched all year, and let's not forget, that is what movies are all about - entertainment. Full of great cameos - literally dozens. Even disgraced politico Anthony Weiner has a role in this movie. Tarantino? Cohen Brothers? Fincher? Nolan?  All pale when placed next to the genius that is Sharknado 3 Oh Hell No!  Now stop reading reviews and rent . . . no . . . buy this amazing movie NOW!",1444435200,2,487,4.5227272727272725

7159383,5,B00X69VIAI,10 stars for SHARKNADO 3.  Plenty of non-stop action here.  Great movie !!,1444176000,,74,4.615384615384615
7159384,5,B00X69VIAI,"If you saw the second feature, you know what to expect, a climax that topped the previous film. Sharknados appear along the east coast as it seem only the Shepard family can kill them off. Nova (Cassie Scerbo) returns from the first feature after taking a hiatus during the second feature. She provided the film with a lot of cleavage eye candy.

Sharknado is a cult classic film series that I can only compare to the old Batman TV series. No one took it seriously and everyone who is famous wants to be in it, even if only to be shark food. The opening credits appear to be a Bond film and it ends in a way we might expect a Bond film to end...minus the inane stuff. President Mark Cuban says that he called a shark once, a reference to his appearances on ""The Shark Tank."" Ann Coulter plays the VP and her escape scene is well...eat your heart out Orlando Bloom. In one scene they kill a shark with the American flag on a pole, imitating the famous Iwo Jima pose. There is a scene from SyFy's ""3 Headed Shark Attack"" in a theater as well as ""Game of Throne"" references. Anthony Weiner now works for NASA. WWF stars and NASCAR.

Clearly this film series has gotten life with no end in sight. You will either love it for what it is, or not. I suggest watching the other features first as there is zero character build up. 8 minutes into the film, people are getting eaten.",1438646400,5,1372,4.293436293436294

7159386,2,B00X69VIAI,"There is something very amusing about shark tornados. The acting is horrible, but it made me laugh throughout. I watched the first two while I was sick and then just had to watch the 3rd. Now I want to see the 4th. I think part of the fun of these movies is that there are odd things that happen at the most inappropriate times, which are so absurd that you're like ""What?"" ""Did that just happen?"" ""Well, that just sucks."" Weapon of choice, golden chainsaw, of course that makes perfect sense.",1481155200,2,493,4.428571428571429

7159388,5,B00X69VIAI,Totally cheezy movie! I've watched the first two and couldn't wait to see this one. Don't get if your looking for a real plot. This movie was made to be stupid and I laughed the whole movie!,1478563200,3,190,4.162162162162162
7159389,1,B00X69VIAI,"While I like variety in the content of my Instant Video library, my ENTIRE FAMILY agrees that the Sharknado series is CRAP!!!  The only reason we are not returning this particular movie, is because Amazon will not allow us to return the first two movies, which we had already begun streaming, in part.  We are completely dissatisfied with these purchases.",1476057600,,355,4.9

Oh well I always say as the door swings both ways HA! But all said - this one - wow - what a disappointment to me anyway - over the top silly and man am I glad I didn't have to pay for it! Wouldn't recommend actually and believe if another sequel comes out - I'm out of there - not interested further!,1473724800,,430,3.8863636363636362

7159400,5,B00X69VIAI,"Loved it!! Just as cheesy as the first two!  Completely unrealistic, quite repetitive of #1 & 2, but still humorously entertaining. Fin and family plus Nova save the whole East Coast from DC to FLA. Great acting with outrageous plot. Definitely made for scify tv but great for laughs!",1466553600,2,284,4.795918367346939
7159401,5,B00X69VIAI,"There comes a moment one's life when they seek truth and honesty in art. It is not often we bother to stop at the cinema, or any moving-picture entertainment, for the answer to this existential query. A mistake, I have made time and time again... Until now.

To put it simply, 'Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!', is the greatest representation of the emotional magnitude of humankind. It's sober portrayed of Man's fear of the elements is nothing less than refreshing. This film goes further than those in its past ('Sharknado', 'Sharknado 2', 'Schindler's List'). It show gravitas in man's weakest moments by character's that show heroism in every environment of our worldly realm (sea, land, sky, beyond).

Actors with such range and skill are rarely capable of continuing a singular character for such long and enduring cinematic legacies. Most like DiCaprio or Tom Hanks cannot truly withstand the sheer pain and ability of living the harsh realities of their character's lives. Additionally, being to continually play them with the Academy Award-worthy charisma in every film. Tara Reid and Ian Ziering have tapped some method of acting so rare - the ability to find within themselve that spirit to pursue the perfect character. Each one individual, growing, evolving, but still able to maintain the sense of continuity of Fin and April's original love and loss and lust... Well, I have no other words except. I do not see Mr. DiCaprio holding his craft high enough to make a second 'The Revenant'.

These sharks, whether it be the physical beings flying through air and space and time, the internal ones demonizing the Shepard family they all hold the greatest metaphoric subtlety of life. 'Sharknado 3' is not about... sharks. It's about the growing family and the popularization of our culture's ability to 'rip down' the middle man. It's about 'the middle man' rising from the sea to the rank to stand in arms with gods - like the president or Mark Cuban. In this film, it is both.

The only flaw this film has is the fact it was not in full-sized cinemas. Unfortunately to the writers, directors, cast, and - in global sense - the general world population, without being in theaters, it cannot be recognized by the Academy. I truly devastating fact considering just how greatly it's legacy would have been cemented if it was.

Bravo.",1466121600,,2335,4.886363636363637

We would find ourselves cheering out loud for particularly creative take outs by the good guy. My 7 year old daughter loves these. It is a great way to deescalate the scarier scenes for her when the unlikelihood of the scene is so beyond the imagination. Good fun.

8715169,5,B00X69VIAI,"What's a guiltier pleasure than the Sharknado movies? Answer: nothing. Maybe Milli Vanilli. The first Sharknado movie was an immediate sensation on social media when it first aired on the Syfy channel in 2013, so, of course, the network suits decreed: ""Hey, go make more of these suckers."" And so it came to pass that a sequel came out, and, now, 2015's Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!

It seems silly to lay down a plot synopsis because the entire enterprise is so very tongue in cheek that you can't take the characters and their goings-on at all seriously. Still, dig the opening sequence that enthusiastically spoofs all those James Bond cold opens. Post-opening credits, we eyeball notorious shark-slayer and hero to you and me, Finn Shepard (Ian Ziering), as he's honored in the White House for his past heroics. Observe him snag the brag of becoming the first member of the Order of the Golden Chainsaw.

Meanwhile, the National Weather Service is tracking a worrisome tropical storm that's almost upon Washington DC. The big fret is that this storm's impact will be felt throughout the entire eastern seaboard, including, say, Florida. A concerned Finn takes a whiff outside and remarks, ""I know how this is gonna sound, but I can sense these storms now."" Okay, Finn.

His better half is in Florida. A very preggers April (Tara Reid) is taking their daughter Claudia (Ryan Newman) to the Universal Orlando Resort for her 18th birthday. Did you groan, like I did, when, before getting on one of the theme park rides, Claudia is told to stow her cell phone in a storage cupboard? I didn't even know that was a policy. Anywa, makes it mighty inconvenient when, soon enough, the fit hits the shan, and Claudia's parents try to contact her.

This kooky franchise has been around long enough now that even the most casual telly-watcher should be caught up with what it's about. The plot trajectories are always way over-the-top, a violent, gory version of the pie in the face. As ever, I'm reminded of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, an all-star undertaking back in 1963  in which all the celebs clamored for a drive-by cameo. Sharknado 3 presents another epic roster of recognizable names. Who would've thunk it that I now prefer this movie's Commander-in-Chief to the nutbar we now have in office. It's Mark Cuban, by the way, as POTUS, and this bit of casting is one of the best things ever. We even get to see him in shark-slaying action. Not at all one of the best things ever is the casting choice of Ann Coulter as the VP. Other familiar faces pop up, but the only other one I'll mention is David Hasselhoff's who surfaces as our hero's estranged astronaut dad whose biggest regret is that he never did get out to space. C'mon, is that foreshadowing or what?

It's another day in the life for Finn and April and friends, meaning hordes of ravenous sharks hurtling out of tornadoes and GORE and GROSS SHARK KILLS and LAUGHS. Character development? What the %$&! is that?! No, man, see the White House bite it! And the Washington Monument! Thrill to another sighting of Santa Mira, that fictional West Coast town that pops up all over cinema. Check out that mascara shotgun. Yes, I said MASCARA SHOTGUN! How dope is that? Be treated to wonky dialogue such as ""Biometeorology is not exactly an exact science."" and, because it's worth reading it twice, ""I know how this is gonna sound, but I can sense these storms now."" Yep, ladies and germs, it's SHARKS! IN! SPACE!!",1487462400,,3467,4.694078947368421
