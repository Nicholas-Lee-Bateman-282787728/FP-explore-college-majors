7796704,5,1565953797,"This movie have a nice plot and some good performances, specially by Maria Ford and Bobby Johnston. Maria Ford is so hot in this movie in main role, featuring in about 6 sex scenes out of about 8...!. I extremely like bath tub oral scene and some aggressive sex scene involving Bobby Johnston and Maria Ford, which lasts for about 1.5 minute, having very hot hot hot work...! Maria Ford is almost entirely exposed in this movie. After watching this movie, i am a number one fan (i think...!)of Maria Ford...!",1094774400,,508,4.593406593406593

I Like to Play Games Too is a sequel to--you guessed it--I Like to Play Games. But you see, they used the word too instead of the number two?! Incredible!

Seriously, though. This movie just destroys the original in every way. In fact, I would recommend you skip the first movie, a really bland Cassandra Leigh/Lisa Boyle softcore piece of crap, and go straight to the second.

Why? Glad you asked.

The first Games was your average run-of-the-mill softcore, really softcore--I'm talking a few breast shots only--Playboy type of movie. And Lisa Boyle, while being unbelievably hot, is very bland, and very dressed.

The second Games does not follow the plot of the first one. Aside from having a hot chick engaged in some sexy games, the movies are unrelated. And Maria Ford is the star of this one. If she were still doing semi-porn, I would call her the Queen of Softcore--but alas, she seems to be trying her hardest for a legitimate career in Hollywood. But that is neither here nor there.

Maria plays an ad exec., or something, who is hired by some musclebound business man--I have no idea what he does--who is into some dangerous things. Unfortunately, he seems to have some weird hold on Maria, causing her to give it up to him about five times in the course of the film. Eventually she will discover his secret, and still continue screwing him. What a gal.

But you want details, right? Okay, but some may be out of order.

--The movie, opening credits, begins with Maria feeling up some guy playing pinball. (She like to play games. Get it?)

--After getting him worked up, she sends him home. Ha! She then has a scene, maybe five minutes, where she masturbates in the shower. Very hot. She shows it all.

This is where it gets jumbled. I haven't seen it in some time, so the scenes are out of order.

--Maria becomes a voyeur and watches Mr. Muscle get it on with his assistant.

--Maria is seduced by him, but tricked. When she comes to meet him, wearing her sexiest lingerie, he brings out another girl to make Maria happy. This is the hottest scene Maria has ever done.

--Maria takes him home; they go at it. A very long scene, and again, Maria shows everything.

--Maria meets him at a hotel where he makes he ties her down and makes her beg for relief. Again, very hot.

--Maria sneaks into his house, but is caught by three female guards. You know what happens next. Again, hot.

And I believe there is another scene that does not involve Maria, but, I believe, her assistant.

So, that is what is found in I Like to Play Games Too. I highly recommend it; and must say, you are not a true Maria Ford fan if you don't own this one.",1093219200,13,2663,4.457731958762887
7796706,1,1565953797,"There's a saying about movies: ""Sequels are rarely equals,"" and this one more than lives up to the saying.  It has fake (body parts), fake (male-female-interactions), fake acting, and a fake story.  Nobody in this movie is interesting. Most of the women, including Maria Ford, spend most of the movie with expressions on their faces as if they had just bitten into a rotten lemon.  To top it off, the movie opens with enough closeups of Maria Ford in the shower that you can tell she's been ""surgically augmented,"" and things go downhill from there.  This movie wasn't even worth watching as a diversion while treadmill-walking.
If game-playing ... turns you on, get the original. Lisa Boyle has a better body and can act more convincingly than any of the talent in this wasteland.",1080518400,,781,4.8059701492537314
7796707,3,1565953797,"This isn't a bad movie.  The cast is good looking and the nudity is plentiful.  The story, of course, leaves something to be desired and not very realistic.  Yes, this is a soft-core porn movie.  That said, the cast is good looking and the acting is fine.  The main characters are all highly charged sexually and much sex ensues throughout the movie.  Though I'm a fan of Maria Ford, the star of the movie, I had a little trouble watching her in this one.  It looked like she made this movie too soon after her trip to the doctor and her lips were just too damn puffy.  For collectors of lesbian scenes, yes, there is a lesbian scene(what C-movie doesn't these days).",972259200,7,667,4.409836065573771
7796708,4,1565953797,"I've only seen this movie on VHS but I can't imagine why it will differ, besides being higher quality video and audio.  This is one of those good (as far as the genre is) erotic movie with softcore sex and some romance to  it.  This is the perfect Friday night with wine movie to watch with your  girl.  If you buy this, you HAVE to buy the first movie ""I Like to  Play Games"" which i would give 5 out of 5 stars.",961113600,6,413,3.9156626506024095

This has got to be one of the best videos produced by Eros. It is filled with attractive women, and very hot love scenes. You might want to grab your sexual partner and watch this movie together.",955756800,,287,4.236363636363636
