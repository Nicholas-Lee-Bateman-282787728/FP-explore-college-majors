7967035,3,B00006CXFU,"I surfed a little in Fort Lauderdale when I was a teenager.
 ""Roxy Surf Now"" is instructional but would have been much better if it had Subtitles.
  Some of the people speaking slurred some words, making parts of it useless.",1396915200,,224,4.55
7967036,5,B00006CXFU,"I have been surfing for about 15 years.  I have competed at an advanced level, and surf in all sorts of conditions in many locations around the world.  I LOVE this video and recommend to all my friends who are trying to learn to surf, men or women.  It includes multiple important principles that are unmentioned in so many other surf videos.  For example surfing etiquette, which will help eliminate collisions and possible fights (I've seen them happen!!)  This video has enough instruction that someone with no previous surfing background should be able to pick up a big board in decent conditions and figure out how to ride it.  The music is fun and entertaining, so much that my 4 yr old son loves to watch it even though he's not quite brave enough to ride real waves.  I do believe if I had seen this video before I started surfing I would have picked it up even quicker than I did.  Thank you Roxy!",1310256000,,906,4.448484848484848
7967037,1,B00006CXFU,"Don't waste your time or money on this lousy 35 minute movie of a couple of girls surfing. Other than how to 'Duck Dive' with a long, or shortboard, you won't learn anything else. There are websites with free info on surfing that will teach you how to choose a board, get past the breaks, when to go for a wave, how to stand up, turn, drop, etc.  Just go into search engine [...] and type in 'learn to surf'. I am very much a novice and thought this DVD was instructional...well it ain't. If you really just want to waste your hard earned moola,  send your money to me instead.",1079654400,2,577,4.1891891891891895
7967038,4,B00006CXFU,This dvd goes over some great tips for learning to surf and what you'll need for surfing and why you need certain things.  It teaches you overall basic stuff for surfing.  They show you some of the cool tricks to get your attention so it's not all about learning and that's it.  I loved the videa a good handy tool for your first paddle out.  Get stoked and get get wet.,1074816000,2,370,4.169014084507042
7967039,5,B00006CXFU,"I bought this as an instructional video-but it's so entertaining, and the photography is so incredibly cool and eyepopping-that it's really enjoyable as just a fun treat on it's own.  The girls are great, the waves are often incredible, and you get all the basics, shown with no condescension-as if a girlfriend were taking you out to the beach for the first time.  Really dug that camera-on-the-end-of-the-board thing.  It's inexpensive, too.  Can't go wrong!",1060387200,4,460,5.175675675675675
