7385354,5,B0147F0S4G,I love this movie and find Romina Power to be utterly captivating as Justine. Jack Palance gives an intense performance and Klaus Kinski as the Marquis De Sade is brilliant casting choice. Watch it already!,1453939200,2,206,4.914285714285715

7385356,3,B0147F0S4G,"""The Marquis de Sade's Justine"" (1969) is directed by Jess Franco. This is the story of a virtuous girl who is orphaned and has one misfortune after another after she and her sister, Juliette, go their separate ways. Juliette makes a good life for herself as a whore, and then as a mistress, wheras Justine, who tries to maintain her virginity, and virtuous ideals, has all manner of problems plague her from one moment to the next. Tyrone Power's 18 year old daughter played the role of Justine, even though she wasn't Franco's first choice given her limited acting skills. This film is mostly played as a comedy with poor Justine just never having any luck in this world. Jack Palance is wonderful as the monk whose goal is to seek higher knowledge of the pleasures of life, while Klaus Kinski (portraying the jailed Marquis de Sade) is periodically shown locked up in his cell writing his masterpiece and working himself up over his creation. He never actually says a word in the movie. The film was shot in many picturesque locations, such as Barcelona's Gothic Quarter, and the famous Guell Park where Gaudi's various architectural creations can be found. All in all this is a big budget production for Jess Franco which shows that he could put together a decent, if not amazing film, if he had the resources. With a more convincing lead actress this film might have been more engaging.

This set comes with a blu-ray, and dvd, of the movie as well as a CD with the soundtrack by Bruno Nicoli. There is also included a 20 page booklet with excerpts from Stephen Thrower's book ""Murderous Passion, the Delirious Cinema of Jesus Franco. The movie looks excellent as it appears to have been remastered.",1453507200,12,1704,4.718120805369128

8729973,1,B0147F0S4G,"I suppose a movie faithful to the book would have been too difficult to make, but this turns its back on the book very early.  Sets were so-so.

8729974,1,B0147F0S4G,"For the time period and hype I expected more. This had very little to do with the Marquis, the story was very disjointed, and the acting atrocious. I have no regrets in thowing this in the trash.",1484092800,,195,4.297297297297297
