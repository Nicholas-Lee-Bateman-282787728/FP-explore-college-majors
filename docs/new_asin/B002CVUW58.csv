3907203,5,B002CVUW58,"I've been watching the Klay World series for years, and Off The Table is as good as it gets! This movie is funny as hell! If you're a fan of the Klay World series, then you'll feel right at home within the first couple minutes. The signature mindless humor and violence of the series shows throughout the entire movie. It's basically the same krap, just longer (heheh). I won't reveal the main storyline, so you'll just have to figure it out yourself. You won't be disappointed! Props to Robert Benfer! :)",1282003200,5,505,4.56043956043956

3907205,4,B002CVUW58,"Internet memes are one of my favorite types of comedy. One of my favorite ""works of art"" ever, so to speak, would be animator Jason Steele's irresistibly bright and annoying comedy, ""Charlie the Unicorn"", a dead-on satire of cheesy children's films and organ theft. Robert Benfer, however, I am only getting accustomed to. After hearing all the lip service this film got, I was expecting the same polished humor style as FilmCow, seeing as Benfer and Steele had worked together on a podcast at one point.

Unfortunately, I was wrong. This film seems more like it was done by a kid with a camera filming claymen and coming up with whatever popped out of the top of his head. The cluelessness and and borderline retardation of the clay world citizens is very fun to watch, however. The film also boasts a likable cast and, for a young adult, amazing special effects. The characters are well-developed and, for clay models, you feel sympathy for them at their death scenes. Unfortunately, some of the scenes plain dragged on and seemed like plain idiocy instead of witty. But there was no script for the film, so I can't really be harsh on it.

The special features are worth a first look, but don't really complete the DVD that well. Most of them are childish, overt ""spoofs"" of Mr. Benfer's day-to-day routine. ""Klay World"" is by no means a bad film, but if you want high quality without having to pay the ridiculous price, then buy Jason Steele's well scripted ""FilmCow Master Collection"", which, in my opinion boasts some of his best FilmCow work. To make things better, the product only costs 10 dollars, which is a very small price for such surprisingly high quality.

Overall: 7.5/10",1264809600,,1687,4.750853242320819
3907206,1,B002CVUW58,"This movie was just awful. I'm fairly open minded. I like South Park, I like The Office, I like a lot of Newground's stuff, I'll even put up with Family Guy. This didn't have any humor to speak of, really.

This, however, was the first movie I've seen where everyone unanimously wanted to skip forwards every minute and a half of content. There is no story, there are no jokes, and there's not really a whole lot of anything aside from really lengthy set ups that don't go anywhere.

Absolutely awful. I feel bad for anyone that buys this hoping for any form of entertainment. This may be what you're looking for, though, if you're playing a cruel joke on someone.",1264636800,,664,4.479338842975206

3907212,4,B002CVUW58,"While I enjoy some of this humor, this movie had about 30 minutes too much of it. My grandchildren, however can watch it repeatedly with peals of laughter. I don't let them watch too often, but they especially love it when all the cousins come to Gran's. It will become a classic.",1375488000,,280,4.403846153846154
3907213,4,B002CVUW58,"I have been planning on watching this movie since I heard it was coming out years ago. I just finally watched it today. It definitely brought back old memories. Now off to refresh my memory of Knox's clay world and movie parodies. If you haven't seen any of his work before, it's probably not for you. Go onto youtube and look up his videos and get accustomed to his type of humor. The movie had a good storyline, and a few parts did bring on a few laughs. All in all, good movie.",1370822400,,480,4.172043010752688
3907214,4,B002CVUW58,"I think that Benfer did a good job of making a movie that retains the essential elements that make Klay World funny, while incorporating an impressively designed plot.  The only thing that I didn't particularly like is that some of the dialogue in the movie can be a bit tedious to listen to -- the voices of some of the characters can be difficult to tell apart, and some of the whining gets a little irritating (but something makes me think that's the intended reaction; it is Klay World after all).  Other than that, I love this movie, it's one of my favorites.",1362355200,,564,4.466019417475728

3907217,2,B002CVUW58,"I enjoy most of Robert Benfer's work and think that his Klay World series is okay. When I saw that this was on Amazon, I got excited and decided to check it out. I couldn't make it all the way through this film. It was severely disappointing. There is no story, the jokes are totally dull. It is made obvious that Benfer's strong suit does not lie in features. I wish I didn't rent this. That is money I will never get back...ever. If you are curious about this, just pass it by. Stick to his online work.",1340236800,,505,4.163265306122449

8364478,5,B002CVUW58,"I grew up watching Robert Benfer's very early work comedic movie dubs, notably his rendition of clips from the Matrix. Naturally, I moved on to his signature work, very amateur, but charming and creative ""klaymations,"" which perfectly synced with my warped, but good-spirited sense of humor I was developing as a teenager.

In a sense, I feel like I kind of grew up with Rob, listening to his podcast, keeping up with his movies, and even listening to his music. I understand his desire to move on from Klayworld into more Neil Ciceraga-type live action sketches, but he's kept up with the demand. As I got older, my appreciation for Klayworld diminished into nostalgia, and I never got on board with Rob's new projects.

Years later, I am financially independent, and figure I can drop some cash on the movie I never got to order or see. More than anything, it appealed to my inner amateur filmmaker - you can tell Rob had a lot of limitations, but this movie served as a watchable opportunity for growth and collaboration and was probably invaluable to developing Rob's skills as a filmmaker. It's impressive that he's able to stretch the 1 to 7 minute premise of his sketches and not only hold interest, but maintain the feel of the originals.

The movie itself is charming and amusing, and I think fifteen to seventeen year old me would have gotten more of a kick out of it. But the accessibility, seeing a filmmaker work very hard using a simple formula and making it his own is what really stands out in this relic of the early days of internet filmmaking.

For fans of the series, or just for those who grew up with it, now is the time to revisit. If you like cult internet/proto-meme era relics, you'd enjoy this movie. The average viewer may find the film a little dull and trying, but I think the charm will hold their attention and stay with them.",1465516800,2,1858,4.57057057057057
