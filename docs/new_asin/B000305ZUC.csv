2154328,2,B000305ZUC,"This being my first gay Bollywood movie, I figured I would give it a chance. Watch this only if you appreciate the typical scenarios of a gay man with a secret relationship, and a strange ending to an even stranger pacing of plot.

Acting: Awkward and stilted.
Cinematography: Lacking, with nowhere good enough lighting.
Plot: Jumps around in places it really does not need to.
Pacing: Within the first four minutes of the movie, you've skipped ahead 8 months...???

I just don't know what to say except you can skip this movie and not miss a thing. This being the production house's first movie, I won't give it a 1-star review simply because they did at least try to give a believable story along with some decent dialogue every fifteen minutes.",1442966400,,747,4.694656488549619
2154329,2,B000305ZUC,Too many stereotypes.  I need to care about the characters in order to like a movie. I found most of the characters to have Pre-Boys-In-The-Band affected personalities.,1442275200,,168,5.222222222222222

2154332,2,B000305ZUC,"Take a lot of bad, second-rate, low-budget gay American movies, make them Indian, and you have this untasty dish.  The film moves sssllooo[...]  The timing is off.  The actors are all stock characters:  the flamboyant one, the actor trying to hide, the guy on the down low, the straight female best friend, and the ""gay everyman"" main character.  Surprisingly, the supporting actors are cuter than the main actor, unlike in most Western, gay films.  I loved that this film shows that there are gay-identified men in India.  However, homophobia on the subcontinent is never brought up.  No character critiques this legalized bigotry brought over by the English imperialists.  This was disappointingly apolitical, especially coming from characters that are supposed to be sharp, hip, and class-privileged.  The one thing I loved about this movie is that many men with sexy, hairy chests are featured.",1104019200,9,898,5.216783216783217

8035474,5,B000305ZUC,"Another great cultural piece dealing with lifestyle choices among a small group of friends living in India. Cushioned with humor, this film hit the mark and tackled the issues surrounding several of the characters with sensitivity and grace. This is a great film, not to be missed.",1467590400,,281,5.0

8035477,1,B000305ZUC,The cross-cultural stereotypes are insulting to everyone. No wonder there's no charge for viewing it. I stopped after seven minutes.,1459209600,,132,5.65

8035479,1,B000305ZUC,"The plot is convoluted, forced and unbelievable. If they had focused on the romantic possibilities of the two leading men instead of some bizarre gay-straight-gay ""transformation,"" it might have been watchable. Unfortunately this film is a disaster from start to finish.",1455580800,,270,5.609756097560975
8035480,4,B000305ZUC,"If for no other reason, this movie is worth watching for seeing that that in other countries gay people are beginning the fight for the right to be themselves. I found that acting and the story enjoyable and a bit of fun. the characters are people that we could just as easily see here in the USA. It is the story of a group gathering for an engagement that starts a lot of intrigue around the one man grieving over a lost relationship. There is a bit of a mystery about who of the hero's ex was, but friends and family, who are very accepting, and decide to help him get over his lost love.",1452211200,2,591,4.147826086956521

8035482,4,B000305ZUC,I actually like it. Yeah the script and the acting could have been better but for a Tuesday night movie before bed...it was pretty good.,1445299200,,136,4.48
