4390987,1,B004JDE62W,"I am a graduate student studying Asian Studies, specifically on China, its politics and human rights. The documentaries claims were based on meager evidence, scant interviews, and biased politics. The music and pictures were simply ridiculous. If you want to watch a documentary that wasn't well done, has an agenda, and does not present a whole picture, this is your film. The only reason it got one star was some of their insights on Tibet and Pakistan were interesting, but not entirely original.",1318982400,6,499,5.024096385542169
4390988,5,B004JDE62W,"As a high school teacher in the UK I bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-The-Rebirth-of-an-Empire/dp/B004JDE62W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China: The Rebirth of an Empire</a>&nbsp;for my  GCSE Media studies students, hoping to find something to assist the 'Representation' and 'Connotation' theories through the study of the world's largest branded product; China. I was pleasantly astounded by the quality and depth of this film, which to be honest I was predicting to be a bit dry. The makers obviously have a passion for the truth  and seemed to follow it around the world from respected experts down to the usually unrepresented townspeople, getting the whole uncensored picture. China, and its struggle to journey into a free world whilst trying to firmly keep a grip on the steering wheel, is laid bare, warts and all. I was intrigued that China seems to be learning from other nation's mistakes and is attempting to win foreign support with free aid rather than profitable trade deals. At the same time though this ancient nation still can't seem to let go of all of its old ways, and some do appear to suffer as a consequence.
I loved the documentary style this piece takes which kept it fresh and alive to the end. The film makers hopped between both sides of the camera and led you through this complex landscape of truth, oppression and change. I found some of the arguments undefended, but as the  danger retrieving most of this information would cause, sometimes at a life & death level, I can let that go.
Overall a very enjoyable watch with refreshingly modern and thorough coverage of an often hidden knowledge. Fantastic educational resource and highly recommended for colleges or anyone interested in current affairs and the evolving shape of world trade. A+ Well done!",1316131200,5,1839,5.291095890410959
4390989,1,B004JDE62W,"I bought this film assuming that it will portray the good and the bad. Well, it wasn't very balanced, because it reflected a lot about the typical protests against human rights, democracy, Tibetan independence, Uyghur independence, Falun Gong, etc.. etc..

The film is also for newbies who don't really know much about China, and I feel it is bias, fear mongering, and xenophobic.

This is just my personal opinion after watching the film. Too much bias against China making her look like a 'threat' or 'boogeyman' which is exactly what you expect from an anti-China film.",1315267200,14,572,4.947916666666667
4390990,5,B004JDE62W,"The Veverka Bros. documentary, China:  The Rebirth of an Empire, is a timely film that explores the emergence or re-emergence of China as a ""super power"".  The film gives us historic information and brings us to the present day.  It allows the audience to learn about China's impact on its neighbors by visiting citizens of such countries as Pakistan, Afghanistan and India,  who may experience their influence directly, who may be concerned about human rights, humanitarian activities, investment in infrastructure, economic growth, political influence and whether or not China is seen as a friend or foe. How is the United States regarded?  If China surpasses the United States, what type of power will it become?  This is an intelligent documentary that raises many questions  and given the economic dependence of the United States on China, begs American's to question what is our role is in the world, is there something we can do to be competitive once again and, perhaps more importantly, if we have lost respect by the rest of the world, how can we regain it.  I highly recommend this well-done film.",1312502400,,1108,4.983695652173913
4390991,5,B004JDE62W,"I thought the Veverka Brothers did a fabulous job creating this thought-provoking documentary. It was interesting to hear the comments from their well-versed interviewees also. We don't often get a peak behind the curtain into this complicated and mysterious country. Very timely, considering our current situation with Afghanistan and Pakistan.",1312243200,,345,5.92
4390992,3,B004JDE62W,"After waiting 2 years to finally get my hands on watching it. i gained 90% of the information in the documentary while i was waiting for it, so by the time i watched it, it was nothing new to me. However, It is still a good watch for people who don't know much or know a little bit about China. I was a little disappointed because it did not show much on China and its history or understandings of its economical rise.

To me personally, I felt that the Documentary focused to much on other countries opinions of China rather than China itself BUT it is still very good to see as most other documentaries on China don't offer that. It was good that in a way they offer the viewer a different look about China and how they do business today.",1311033600,,740,4.211267605633803
4390993,5,B004JDE62W,"I saw this when they screened it several years ago at Cornell at the end of Summer 2009 [and again about a year later when they screened it at Cinemapolis, Ithaca's independent theatre, in their hometown.]

Even though I thought I ""knew a good deal about China"" [and had even spent a lot of time chatting with both Jesse and Jeremy about their experiences over their four months or so of travels through Asia] - this movie was an eye opener.

It was fascinating to hear so many testimonials from Chinese citizens from a wide variety of provinces and lifestyles (and residents of neighboring countries,) and to see how wide the range of opinions on China's rise (or resurrection) truly are.  While you hear bits and pieces in the news, this documentary was perhaps the most revealing look at the global opinion of China I'd ever seen.  Definitely worth catching again!",1297123200,4,867,4.7218543046357615

8431861,1,B004JDE62W,"Overly biased in a very obvious way, watch it with other documentaries to balance.

8431862,5,B004JDE62W,"Looking at some of the reviews here it looks like this is one of those provocative films that you either love or hate.  I loved it.

The documentary presents a strong thesis and backs it with well-researched, bold yet nuanced arguments about China's rise as a political power, a topic that a lot of people, both inside China and out, are uncomfortable thinking about. It's about China as a nation, not as a people and if you are looking for a film about life in China or the stories of average Chinese this is NOT the film for you. It's also not meant to be a feel-good film about how China is ""modernizing"" or ""democratizing,"" although it does deal with those topics. It's predominately a film about China's external politics and national ambitions and in that sense this film is excellent.

Like other reviewers have pointed out there are a few places that get a little corny (like some of the sound effects), but that's just a stylistic issue and it really isn't a big deal.  The important thing is that this film examines the rise of China from a lot of different angles and yet despite its clear thesis, let's viewers draw their own conclusions.  That's this film's strength, but I can also see how it could be a turn off to some viewers, especially academic types, who already have strong preconceived ideas (either good or bad) about China and want a film that preaches them.

The film does a great job covering topics like China/Japan relations, China/India relations or China/Afghan relations that make the news on a regular basis. It shows how complicated international relations can be and how a given issue can have more than one side. Some people have labeled this film as taking a conspiracy theory tone, but I don't see it. The film DOES dig below the shallow statements commonly made by heads of state, politicians and popular ""experts"" but that is exactly what good independent cinema should do.  If you just want something that regurgitates the standard arguments, go watch TV.  Overall a great film!",1349913600,,2018,4.713068181818182
8431863,1,B004JDE62W,"as both student and professor of Chinese culture ... i was quite disappointed.  i have now lived and worked in Asia with the Chinese for many years, and my life is immersed in the learning of their history, culture and language.  though i would agree that China overreaches their bounds and has their own world agenda that should not be ignored, this presentation was biased to the point of being unprofessional.  i own every China documentary available on DVD and this is the only one i will not re-use in any fashion.  the bias and agenda is further amplified by those they interview.  we see a collection of ""conspiracy theory"" authors, college students, dissidents, human rights lawyers, and human rights volunteers.  the addition of ""crashing sound effects"" in transitions, and the superimposing of a nuclear explosion (granted ... for effect) is unprofessional and cautions me that i will not trust the producers to be ""fair"" in their handling of the issues.  i would exercise great caution before purchasing this film.  if you are a critical thinker ... you will be deeply frustrated.  any agreement i would have with arguments in the film were tarnished by its ""i have a point to make"" college senior film project feel.",1349568000,5,1227,4.888888888888889
8431864,1,B004JDE62W,"Although it brings true issues about China's foreign policy with its neighbors, it hardly deals with China itself, its history or its current domestic issues. It relies too heaviliy on some commentators of questionable experience, although I liked the former CCP member's perspectives.
The documentary has a ""conspiracy theory"" tone to it that I sincerely disliked. I hate to post bad reviews for an independently made film but it felt like this one was done by the same guys that thought 9/11 was an inside job. Not my cup of tea...
Maybe my expectations were wrong and I was somehow mislead by the title. A better title should be ""China's influences on bordering countries""...I was looking for a more comprehensive look at China in the 21st century.",1338422400,3,751,4.921259842519685
8431865,4,B004JDE62W,"I prefer Chinese cheap goods than American military hardware. I traveled to 17 different countries, I went to China 5 times, it is a beautiful country with awesome culture and tradition the foods are great, the people are nice. So yeah China is a great nation. I'm an australian and my girlfriend is a chinese, we enjoy each other's company and we love each other. This doco is abit bias but all I cared about was China's positive side in the doco. I'm not racist but I've seen worst crimes from Britain, France, Israel and America. China is not my enemy NATO is.",1337126400,,563,4.475728155339806
8431866,5,B004JDE62W,"I really liked this film.  The production quality is high and it covers a lot of topics and presents a lot of interesting information. Some reviewers have labeled it as propaganda, but if that's the case, propaganda for whom?  The film is just as critical of American military imperialism as it is of possible Chinese hegemony.  I think the film is really a critique of empire as a whole. History is full of countless examples of big nations dominating the weak and small, as is China's own history.  I think the burden of proof really lies on those claiming that the China of the future will be any different.",1332288000,,610,4.568807339449541
8431867,4,B004JDE62W,"If you're a total novice you might enjoy learning that Dalai Lama does not live in Tibet anymore but in India, however for us, the ones with at least half a brain, the film is very sophomoric. (You'll also learn that Hong Kong was a British colony and Cheng Hai Check too refuge to Taiwan)
Once I realized that my intellect won't do any heavy lifting, I started to watch and enjoy the film as a travel log, a journey through the mountains of Uygur, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.
I have to admire the producers for making this trip, and for their efforts to educate some other youngsters possibly as simple minded as they are. In the age of quick sensations and superficiality, this kind of format could possibly be the best vehicle to introduce international affairs to a generation that seems to be totally indifferent to anything that can not be made into a video game.
Yes, the film is highly anti-Chinese, and I would not have minded, if there was some depth to the views and some sense of balance. For instance at one point a Uygur farmer is dissatisfied that an industrial plant opened up close to his farm. Of course if there was no plant near by, he would have been upset that the CCP is not developing the area... Either way the Chinese Government is evil... Most investigations come to that conclusion. An exception, were some Pakistani mullas that preferred Chinese cheap goods over American militarism.
Later on, the investigation goes to Hong Kong where the democratic traditions inherited from the UK are declining under the pressure of the CCP. Here the investigation gets a lot deeper and for the first time it seemed to be made by adults. The film had this constant identity problem: It is addressing you as a novice, a connoisseur of Chinese affairs and a potential tourist in the same time.

Now for the rest of us that want an intellectual challenge, I highly recommend:

I found it to be a very eye opening investigation in what shaped the western and Chinese societies from early beginnings and why they are so different today.

Finally, in the age of celebrity obsession and cheap thrills, kudos to all the film makers that do take on these topics and actually try to teach us something.",1325376000,,2410,4.990049751243781
