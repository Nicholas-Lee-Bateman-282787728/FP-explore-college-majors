7946144,5,B00005N5UW,"This series is a must see for enthusiasts, and for all who love Israel, Yiddishkeit, or want to get a brief overview of Jewish History. Abba Eban is great with his idiosyncratic narration throughout the video series. The series is several Hrs long and span several tapes. Perhaps you might look to purchase a dvd version. The series starts out in a very ambitious attempt to cover much detail about Jewish civilization but half way through resigns its work to a broad overview. A great piece of film literature and well worth a good family or community viewing.",1322870400,,561,4.73469387755102
