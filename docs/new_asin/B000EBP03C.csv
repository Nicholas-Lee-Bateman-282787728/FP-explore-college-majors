8108310,5,B000EBP03C,"If the $1500 price tag of this currently listed box set seems a little steep, here's a suggestion: buy an all-region DVD player - a new Pioneer or good used Oppo can be purchased for less than $100 (from Amazon, of course)- then go shopping on AmazonUK, AmazonFR, etc. and pick up these European Region 2 collections for $15 - $40 used.  Shipping from the UK is only $5. They are good quality, probably sourced from original prints for the most part; not public domain, but not computer restored, either.  I bought this set from a US reseller for $15.  Universal UK has transferred a number of their old classics to Region 2, some not even available on US NTSC, and many are available for less than $10.  Used copies of the British film collections - David Lean, Michael Powell, etc. are extremely inexpensive, a fraction of the US box set price.",1360108800,2,846,4.546052631578948
