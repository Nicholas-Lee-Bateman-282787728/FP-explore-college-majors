8176650,4,B000FILUVK,"This film is able to compensate for a lack of budget with lots of bullets to please any fan of gun fu. The actors do a repectable job playing everything serious but it's the explosive action scenes that make this film fun. The action is fast and furious without being too over the top or unrealistic. The violence keeps the gunfire reallistic and threatening. If you like gritty, bloody triad films and don't mind the lack of budget this is the film for you.",1323734400,,458,4.464285714285714
