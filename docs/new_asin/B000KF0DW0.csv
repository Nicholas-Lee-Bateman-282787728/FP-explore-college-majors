It is very obvious that these are ""disney knock offs"" and that they haphazardly borrow elements from other american animations and 80's anime ... but these movies are meant for kids. Honestly if I was a kid with nothing better to do and I'd already seen all the disney films and had no access to cartoons ... this wouldn't be a bad substitute! yeah the animation is choppy, dialogue is silly and clunky/doesn't match up, and the stories are short and sometimes seem aimless but a 2-10 year old isn't going to care. Just something to pass the time. As an adult who studies animation I found these films funny in how messed up they get. If it's for kids, they won't care. If it's for an animation critique, they will get a laugh at how bad it is.",1466467200,,892,4.284023668639053
8156113,1,B000KF0DW0,"This is not a Disney collection, that is for sure.
This is NOT good animation.  In fact I was half expecting Speed Racer to appear in the stories.  If this isn't the same hack animators of that genre, it must be their children.
The stories are also butchered and tweaked and just plain silly....They must have used the Poke Mon writers as it makes you want to eat your own foot.
The music is equally silly and makes me ill.
The voices of the characters I would liken to nails on a chalkboard.
You will regret a purchase of this product and you will miss the use of your foot.",1200960000,3,575,4.218181818181818
