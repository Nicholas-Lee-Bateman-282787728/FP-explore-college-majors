8008287,4,B00018WL1W,I agree with the previous reviewer. My students kept laughing and imitating Max Orbit. I was honestly annoyed by it as well. But the information is solid and well presented for fourth graders.,1475452800,,192,4.848484848484849
8008288,4,B00018WL1W,"This is a great video if you tell kids to ignore the overacting/mugging the host makes. The information is accurate, well explained, and nicely presented. The unfortunate part is that ""Max Orbit"" makes so many goofy faces and that kids tune out the learning.",1319673600,3,258,4.886363636363637
8008289,5,B00018WL1W,"I teach 4th grade and we get into types of rocks: metamorphic, sedimentary, igneous. This video is very engaging and informative, too! My students love it and it's a great intro to the world of geology.",1293753600,2,202,4.638888888888889
