4581646,5,B00560317S,"When we ordered the first ""Lewis"" we were very skeptical since it was a spinoff  of the incredibly well-done ""Morse"" series. But to our delight they are just as compelling and beautiful.  We have recently rewatched all episodes through series 3 in anticipation of the 4th series being released. Highly recommend--you won't be disappointed.",1314316800,49,339,5.2592592592592595
4581647,5,B00560317S,"The episodes on this DVD set are great (as always).

My only complaint is that the price currently shown ($31.49) is substantially higher than the price offered on another site.  I have no doubt that Amazon will rectify this problem.  I love Amazon, but you should check this issue before you place your order.

Although the product description of this DVD set claims that the running time is only 60 minutes, another web site notes that it is 360 minutes.  This is probably a typo.  I mention this because it means that the episodes provided by PBS on this DVD set are the full episodes shown in the UK.  PBS cuts 10 minutes from the US TV broadcast in order to fit the episode into the Masterpiece time slot, which I don't mind so long as the full episodes are offered on the DVD.  Unfortunately, PBS has a history of only putting the abridged version of episodes on the DVDs that PBS produces (as opposed to ACORN or BBC).  For example, while the full Inspector Lewis episodes are offered on Series 3 and 4, only the abridged versions are offered on the earlier series.  I believe that the change to selling the full episodes on the DVDs happened because a number of people complained about the abridged DVDs in reviews like this one. So, be careful about the running time when you buy PBS Masterpiece produced DVDs.  Wikipedia states:

""PBS owns the exclusive rights to both broadcast Lewis and to manufacture DVDs for North America. This is in contrast to Inspector Morse, which was commissioned by British company Carlton Television (originally Central Independent Television) and which included all original broadcast footage, even if that footage was edited on North American TV stations. PBS edits 10 minutes out of every Lewis episode so that it fits into the 90 minute Masterpiece Mystery time slot; this includes a preview of the episode's contents narrated by Alan Cumming before the episode and commercials for other PBS programs at the end of this slot. Even Barrington Pheloung's end credit music is abruptly cut for this purpose. For the Pilot, Inspector Lewis 1, and Inspector Lewis 2 DVD sets, PBS Home Video releases what was broadcast on-air in the US as opposed to the UK DVD content. However, for the new Inspector Lewis 3 DVD set, PBS Home Video has released the unedited UK version of the programs contained in the set.""

In conclusion: (i) great series, (ii) full episodes on DVD, but (iii) check the price.",1313884800,208,2433,4.73696682464455
4581648,5,B00560317S,I like the Inspector Lewis series better than the Inspector Morris series.  Lewis is not as irrascible and doesn't treat colleagues as nitwits.  The chemistry between Lewis and Fox is more appealing.,1311465600,53,199,5.1875

The charm and dynamic relationship of all of the characters, especially, Inspector Lewis; D.S. Hathaway; Dr. Laura Hobson; and Chief Superintendent Jane Innocent, provide an engaging drama.  Couple the drama with a whodunit, which will keep one guessing until the final scene provides a wonderful respite from reality.

The English are strange you know, like the continously jump in the passenger side of a car and drive off  on the wrong side of the road.  And don't get me started on their roads, okay, I've started.  The roads are one lane with twists and turns and hedges right up the the edge of the road so it's impossible to see any oncoming traffic, so they are always running each other off the road  They, the English, claim to speak English but I need to have the closed captions turned on as I can't understand a word they are saying.  And the old guys have really strange nick names like Hammy, or Bunny.  There's more but I won't get into that, but in spite of it all, I love Lewis.",1470960000,,797,4.197368421052632

Hathaway is a really interesting character - cerebral and educated but not coming from the wealthy background of those he went to school with; vulnerable and lonely; awkward with women but wanting a connection.

The scripts and dialog are first rate and challenge your mind as well as emotions and always very clever and compelling.

Truly one of the better scripted series with insights into the world of Oxford University and village.

4582448,5,B00560317S,"Violent crime is not the first subject that comes to mind when one thinks of the dreaming spires of Oxford. However, this series rests on a steady diet of crime involving the denizens of Oxford. Despite this, it is the peculiarities of the very insular world of the great university that occupy center stage and Oxford does provide an interesting setting where people murder for reasons that leave the viewer perplexed. Still, the combination of slightly mad  (at least) villians  and likeable detectives more than make up for the lack of realism. These episodes are worth repeated viewings.",1465430400,,591,5.020408163265306

Watched Inspector Morse and was delighted when they started the sequel giving Inspector Lewis the limelight; love the interactions with Hathaway... They found a new and fresh way to revive a similar dynamic as Lewis had with Morse. Of course the setting of it being in Oxford doesn't hurt either. There are typically no really gruesome in year face brutal scenes and these mysteries don't need it. If you are looking for fast paced, crazy chases and modern gadgets, this one is not for you. But if you are after an almost feel-good mystery - tune in.
I personally hope that there will be more seasons!",1464307200,,644,4.608695652173913

Also love Ms Holman as ""Dr. Hobson"".  I read that Season 7 is the last one and wish that it weren't.  However, I understand Mr. Whately wanting to ""retire"" his character after playing it for so many years.  Good luck to him and the other cast members.  You had a remarkable ""run"".  Again...

Hathaway has even started to be a little more Macho setting him apart from the Sergeant played by Kevin Whatley in the Morse series.

It's still Robbie, but this is many years in the future and he now lives alone because his wife has died and his kids have moved on.

4583010,5,B00560317S,"Lewis and Hathaway, facetiously referred to by their gov as ""the dynamic duo,"" are back, untangling complex mysteries in Oxford. Watching them is pure pleasure.  Hathaway is smoothly professional, his erudite and sometimes humorous utterances enlivening a character who might possibly be considered a little dry. Robbie Lewis, as always, is the essential good guy-- down-to-earth, sensitive, disciplined. But he can be provoked to wrath.  Still hurting from the death of his beloved wife, he is beginning to come to grips with his loss, and seems to be more comfortable with the possibility of a new relationship. He's being helped along the way by the pert and sometimes peppery pathologist, Dr Laura Hobson.  A match is obviously in their future, but it's nice to see them slowly warming up to each other.
It's always a treat to see the beautifully shot scenes in and around Oxford; characters are well defined and the stories are full of..well.. mystery.
And Barrington Pheloung's music is always wonderful.",1456704000,,1010,5.146341463414634

4583161,5,B00560317S,"This series is probably the best of the many I have seen over the years.  I have been a long time fan of Masterpiece Theater -- from the very beginning.  I love theater, particularly British, because of the use of language.  The Inspector Morse series was good, but the writers for the Lewis series are even better.  They've created an unlikely pair of men, who not only bring out the best of each other but forge a kind of intellectual and spiritual intimacy that is rare and the stuff of which great works are made.  Part of this success concerns humor and subtlety.  The series is also the best living example I can think of that demonstrates the importance of language in all its variety.

Bravo to the writers as well as the many actors who make the series come alive.  Whately is superb, and tell Fox to give up his pursuit of professional music.  I have no particular dislike of his musical efforts, but any one who can register what he can with a lift of an eyebrow, turn of the head, or quotation from Lear at just the right moment, should not deprive people like me of his acting abilities.  I would like these people to go on until they drop!!!  There is so much wrong in the world today, but performance is not one of them.",1455580800,5,1235,4.349344978165939

4583171,4,B00560317S,"I'm a big fan of this series. For those who don't know, Lewis was the sergeant in the Inspector Morse series, and this series takes up some time after the Morse series. Lewis is more affable and likable than his old boss and has a less prickly relationship with his new partner, DS James Hathaway. Dr. Laura Hobson, who was introduced late in the Morse series as the forensic pathologist, and Lewis have developed a friendship over the first seasons and appear to be headed for romance. Lewis is a plodding kind of detective, amassing evidence and looking for the thread that ties it all together. Usually a flash of inspiration leads him to the tie, and he's always able to sew up the case.",1455062400,,691,4.536

Lewis and Hathaway his assistant are unique characters that play off each other. Laura Hobson is the forensics doctor and she's been quite good too along with Innocent the chief of all of them. Lust, greed, revenge and the like are often part of any story as the detectives search out the murdered and the murderer.

4583628,5,B00560317S,"My wife and I have been binge-watching Inspector Lewis and have made it through Season 4. Well, I guess it's not really a binge, since we limit our viewing to one episode per day so we can enjoy each one thoroughly. It would probably be unfair to call this a ""typical British murder mystery"" although it does have all of the features of that art form: a substantial setup leading to the murder, numerous suspects, interesting sleuths wandering lots of blind alleys and eventually getting to the ""Eureka moment"" when they figure it out, and ending with a climactic scene in which the murderer is identified. Inspector Lewis operates in Oxford, and so the series includes fabulous scenery, both exterior and interior. In addition, the two main characters, Lewis and Hathaway, have a growing friendship and professional relationship, which brings understated humor to the series.

This type of show is not everybody's cup of tea because you really need to pay attention -- no smartphone or tablet while Inspector Lewis is on. But if you take the time, you will find that it's not been wasted. Highly recommended!",1445904000,,1109,4.898936170212766

4583683,5,B00560317S,"These were excellent stories as usual and more than a bit dark. Three of them had their roots in the past. The first story takes place in a woman's college at Oxford that had just agreed to go co-ed. A death during a Gaudy opens a ten year mystery. The second ""Wild Justice"", takes place at St. Gerald, a theological college, where actual friars roam. A visiting Bishop is poisoned with a bottle of St. Gerald' s wine, which begins a murderous rampage. Revenge is the motive but there's nothing nothing cold about it. The third story takes place on Oxford grounds, where a student taking part in a drug trial for a new antidepressant. As usual, with Lewis, more bodies start to pile up. The last has an Irish theme and it all goes back 20 years.

The acting is first-rate and the beauty of Oxford provides an idyllic background for a lot of nasty doings.",1445385600,,854,4.439490445859873

4583713,5,B00560317S,"This series has very interesting plots, and the interplay of the characters Lewis and Hathaway is entertaining. Much of the background music is classical, but it is not dreary or overdone. The acting by all the supporting characters is very good. I like the little bits of pedantry that helps the detectives solve cases. The Oxford depicted looks like a much more hazardous place to live than Cabot Cove!",1444867200,,404,4.869565217391305
4583714,4,B00560317S,"Usually interesting story content, sometimes a bit too gory, and don't like the constant atheistic attitude of Lewis.

4583796,4,B00560317S,"The series is slightly formulaic. The sleuthing is believable and keeps the viewer engaged to the final scene, when all is revealed. The clues are laid out, a few at a time so it is possible to guess whodunit. (My chief complaint with Miss Marple is that vital clues are never revealed before the ending). Inspector Lewis, like it's predecessor, Inspector Morse is an enjoyable bit of English programming.",1443139200,,405,4.884057971014493
4583807,5,B00560317S,"This is a ""later in time"" following the Inspector Morse series.  These mysteries are totally unlike those created in the US. They have deep characters I wasn't fond of the character of Inspector Morris series though Lewis was wonderful as his sidekick in that series (yes, there are even more series in this style!) But I disliked a character who felt as real as my next door neighbor. In this series Lewis has come into his own and has an at first elusive and then adorable Sgt in Hathaway. I have finished through season 4 and still have seasons 5 - 7 to enjoy.  The plots are as twisted as a tiny village path and so rich in possibilities that I have yet to pick out the villain. Prepare yourself for enthralling  entertainment that never disappoints.",1443139200,5,754,4.529411764705882

4583815,3,B00560317S,"We watch Inspector Lewis because it is one of the few remaining programs you offer on Prime that is free (at least, for now) that we find acceptable.
As we have written in other reviews, you have eliminated so many programs that were really very good, and have put in their place, really poor, tasteless, even smarmy, programs.  One time when I mentioned that, the individual who responded said, ""Well, you can always rent or buy,"" a rather poor reply.  Of course we can do both; that individual seemed to overlook (or ignore) the main appeal of Amazon Prime for many of us,  is that programs can be viewed free..

Sadly to say, Lewis is the last mentor/old dog detective unless they make a series with Hathaway as the mentor to a younger Sarge who is going up the ranks.  Watch them in line and you will not want Inspector Lewis to end. As usual,..., the acting is superb, character development flawless thru the years all work with each other. And there is a special bond between Lewis and Hathaway in this series that brings back the days when Males could care about each other and not be seen as gay.

4584330,5,B00560317S,"Finally started to fully appreciate the nuances of Whately's/Lewis' work.  It's so subtle and low keyed it's almost invisible - the best acting!  He plays the down to earth Northern copper true to his roots and slightly uncomfortable in Oxford's sophisticated and 'sophistic' environment - like someone wearing a slightly ill fitting suit but doing his job and making the best of it.

He worked off the irascible but lovable John Thaw/Morse's volatile brilliance with a stolid determination but, now, as the senior detective goes in quite a different, more collegial direction with his junior partner -  an excellent performance choice!  Works for me, at least.

Fox/Hathaway's introverted elegance provides a perfect foil and complement.  Together they make work, Lewis somewhat paternal, but not paternalistic, to the relatively isolated Hathaway. Despite knowing many people in Oxford he is very alone, perhaps lonely. Understandable as a former seminarian/Divinity Student, in a young 'party' town.  Excellent work from Fox.

While the two 'blokes' do the 'heavy lifting' in this, the female characters give it depth and dimension, beautifully played and performed.  Not much of MO Dr. Claire Holman in Episode 2.  Holman brings a quiet warmth to every episode.  Guest artists - always well cast.",1434412800,,1300,5.349753694581281

If you enjoyed the Morse mysteries that ran years ago on PBS or if you are new to these shows, either way these are extremely well done and well worth watching.",1428883200,,567,4.330188679245283

4584714,5,B00560317S,"Season 4 of ""LEWIS"" is the best season of the best detective show of all time.  Every episode is a winner; every script is tightly and smartly written; every aspect of filmmaking is in top form.  With ""Old, Unhappy, Far-Off Things"" we get a strong start to Season 4, and it gets better with each successive episode.

As I've written elsewhere, Lewis and Hathaway investigate cases the old-fashioned way with gumshoe work, keen observation, and that coveted puzzle-solving skill that Lewis picked up from DCI Morse.  All this is done without resorting to violence or action-film gimmicks.

I strongly recommend watching all of ""LEWIS.""  If necessary, give up something else you like to watch so you can make room for all seven seasons.  But if you only have time or money for one, Season 4 is your must-see season.",1427414400,,813,4.805755395683454

It is so not like American crime dramas - no hair raising high speed car chases - no unneeded nudity - no endless stream of bullets that never hit their targets.

The writers are talented enough so that we are not subjected to unnecessary violence, horror, or gratuitous sex just to make the show. The suspects are many and it is hard to pick out the real criminal from the facts given, but that is what makes it a good game of cat and mouse.

Kevin Whately and Lawrence Fox pair well as an inverted Morse/Lewis. The genius of this series, beside the heart-warming continuing story of our Robbie, is ""replacing"" Morse with Hathaway, bringing Cambridge to Oxford, Lewis just unable to get away from Morse. The continued cameos of Colin Dexter are something to look forward to as well. It's all good and solid drama.",1423008000,,532,4.9222222222222225

However,  it won me at the first episode of the series (which, by the way is not the first of this disk and is no where to be found).  The episodes on this disk are finely honed.  All characters are well cast and immediately embraced.  Kevin Whately continues his character from the Morse series, older, wiser, and deeper.  He is now the one in charge, and Laurence Fox makes a fine addition to the series as his second.  I was a bit worried that the writers were trying to create a young Morse, but Fox has carved his own distinct place in the series as the the characters get to know each other, and we them.  This series stands on its own and as a worthy sequel to Morse.",1409443200,,781,4.16

4585374,4,B00560317S,"One of the things I like most about this series is the lack of explosions.  Logic, hard work, are the basic tools the inspectors use to solve crimes.  Of course, there is also the elimination rule where all of my favorite suspects get murdered and the case is solved by the process of elimination.  These are good stories in the tradition of the British crime novel.  Not only is there the crime itself but also the ongoing relationships between the characters.  These are human beings whose lives are a work in progress not some super heroes who fly in and out solving the latest threat to mankind. The one thing that drives me crazy is understanding the accent.  I use a lot of hearing batteries on this series but it's worth it!

However allow at least 90 minutes to account for several buffering episodes. Kevin Whatley who played Detective Sergeant Lewis in the Morse series plays Inspector Lewis.

4585548,4,B00560317S,I chose this program because British TV is just fascinating to this American.  The acting is far superior to the that on American TV and the characters are 3 dimensional.  Bravo to Lewis and Hathaway.,1397347200,,200,4.685714285714286

4585562,5,B00560317S,"I'll go against the tide and say that I am not an 'Inspector Morse' fan. I just never warmed up to the character. But, I love ""Inspector Lewis'! I like everything about Kevin Whately's portrayal of Inspector Lewis. I like the accent; I like his innate moral code; I like the romance with Laura Hobson that took 4 years to play out; I like the display and depth of mourning for his late wife, Val. I like the stories and the unexpected turns they take and his (Lewis') role in those turns, I like the guy. If he was real and I got the chance to meet him while visiting Oxford, I'd like him.  And, I love the scenery since I and my husband came to know and love each other while in Oxford on a college trip.

While I feel a warmness in my heart for Kevin Whately's ""Inspector"", I might just be a little obsessed with DS Hathaway. Laurence Fox is so subtle, so perfectly timed as Hathaway, that I often wonder if Fox isn't playing himself. I haven't found enough of his work available online to be able to tell, but Hathaway is one of those characters that leaves you wanting more. A 'copper', as Lewis would say, who left the seminary to become a cop! The dichotomy of Lewis and Hathaway works. Lewis who does not believe in God and Hathaway who does. Lewis' experience as opposed to Hathaway's inexperience; Lewis' cop brain vs. Hathaway's brilliant one; Lewis' love for the common in contrast to Hathaway's love of the sublime. I'd like a 3 part movie just on Hathaway and what makes him tick. Really, he's a fun character to try to get to know, to figure out; he's a puzzle just waiting to be solved.

As a Christian, I'm not so full of myself that I can't and won't accept others unbelief. It's all about choices. What I hate is that American television mocks me, mocks my belief, and, worse, mocks God. This series explored many religious topics. Topics of doctrine, topics that divide and topics of faith were explored and not mocked. I disagreed with everything religious on the program, but because of the way the series was written and presented, there was no offense given and the show was excellent without the ""bat"" that American TV uses to club me with.

The regular supporting characters are excellent. The supporting characters that moved in and out of the series were excellent, as well. Really, a who's who of British character actors. If you watch British TV series' at all, you'll see these same actors in other roles and I like that. You'll also see all three Fox brothers. Look them up on IMDB.com. Really talented family!

For me, ""Inspector Lewis"" is a go to show. If I'm bored, I watch an episode of ""Inspector Lewis"". If I'm sewing and I want something on in the background, I watch ""Inspector Lewis"". I have my favorite episodes and there are some that I don't care for as much, but every episode is a winner against the dreck of American TV. If you find yourself turning off the TV more and more, well, ok, that is a good thing. Keep it up. But for times when you want to be entertained by the TV, this series is a sure thing.

I just noticed that, for whatever reason, Amazon has me reviewing the HD format of ""Inspector Lewis: Season 4"". I don't own anything in HD format. I have DSL and live pretty remotely. I can't stream anything in HD format. I do own the digital season 4 of ""Inspector Lewis"" in SD format and this review reflects that. I won't review my streaming experience because I don't think my troubles with streaming stem from Amazon. So this review is about content only. If you need a review on the technical and visual superiority of HD over SD, this review isn't it.",1397088000,2,3611,4.430722891566265

4585581,5,B00560317S,"Great series. It grows on you; the characters have a 'back story' that is referenced regularly throughout the series, and even Inspector Morse is referenced. For a police procedural this is great art. The downside(s)? The Oxford locale gets a bit boring after a while, and the surprising regularity with which Oxford dons, administrators, and students are murdered makes Oxford seem more dangerous than Gaza City or Mexico City. Also, in Lewis-Land the women are as dangerous as the men--watch out for the revengeful women who come back after 20 or 40 years to wreak justice!",1396656000,,575,5.0

Most of these British detective shows (Whitechurch, Foyle's War, etc.) bring a new perspective to the same basic way crimes are solved, Inspector Lewis rates at the top.  Many time, however, the clues aren't as obvious to the viewer as to the stars of the program.  But, in the long run, Lewis is very good.  However, I have to pay close attention as I rely a great deal on watching lips to figure out what the dialogue is.  And, as with most of the British 'imports' to America, many of the terms they use are unfamiliar until one gets accustomed to their meaning.  Example: ""bullocks""  The British way of saying ""B.S."" in a nice way.  5 Stars for sure!",1394582400,,669,4.426229508196721

4585673,5,B00560317S,"I am gradually working my way through all seasons of Inspector Lewis and so far I have enjoyed them all.  I have always liked the actor playing Inspector Lewis and first started watching him in a British series called Auf Wiedersehen Pet about construction workers from the North East of England working in Germany.  Later on I watched him in the Inspector Morse series and now have followed him onto being Inspector in Inspector Lewis.  In this series the roles are somewhat reversed from Morse, with Lewis's sidekick detective Hathaway being the intellectual know- it-all!  Morse was always fond of telling Lewis obscure things and in this series Hathaway performs the same function.  Hathaway played by Edward Fox is a delight and has a delicious sense of humor whilst at the same time remains a very serious and complex character. There is not usually a lot of running around or outward aggression rather the series is filled with evocative footage of Oxford and great dialogue it is a series that you need to watch and pay attention to.  Another point to note is that each episode is around 90 minutes in length so they are almost like watching a movie nothing is rushed!  Great show!!",1393286400,,1190,4.775609756097561

I keep coming back for more and will begin to watch the series that preceded this one about Morse. One good thing is any gore is kept to a minimum. Some dead bodies here and there and scenes at the morgue, however, nothing graphic that will haunt your dreams at night.",1390176000,,584,4.518867924528302

4585736,5,B00560317S,"We loved Lewis as Morse's sidekick.  He is still the same ""innocent"" with the new intellectual at his side, but a clever detective.  Beautiful scenery.",1390089600,,151,5.0
4585737,5,B00560317S,Great character development and always a good story line.  Ties current social issues into story line without it seeming to be contrived. A really enjoyable British who-dun-it.,1389830400,,176,5.518518518518518
4585738,5,B00560317S,"Well crafted on every level. Just excellent. I hope they make good on their promise of a new series featuring Hathaway, Lewis's Sargent. His character is one of the most interesting ever written for this genre. Well worth owning.",1389830400,,229,4.897435897435898
4585739,3,B00560317S,"Mind you, I keep watching because I'm an anglophile who likes crime drama; however, this is show has a lot of weaknesses. One is that the lead actor doesn't strike me as the smart, wise Lewis. The other major weakness is that the writing doesn't give the viewer any clues on to how/why the crime occurred ... it all gets resolved, but most of the time it's out of left field and fit together in reverse. Plus, there's a lot of throwaway lines that seem unnecessary, and the continued trying of giving Lewis a love interest is BS since he has no chemistry with the women they push his way. Granted, Dr. Hobbes does a good job of making moon-y faces at him, but those 2 seem so not genuine I'm not certain why they're trying to create this dynamic.

All that said, I likely keep watching this show because of Laurence Fox (Hathaway)he knows how to deliver a line, and give it a comical twist without breaking the story. His levity keeps the show moving, and it would be more interesting if they'd just more deeply explore his character and gave him a love interest.",1389830400,,1063,4.423469387755102
4585740,5,B00560317S,This series is wonderful.  I started with the Inspector Morse series and this one is just as good if not better.  The Oxford landscape has always drawn me in.  The architecture is wonderful.  The stories are excellent and keep you guessing until the very end.  I would think that a certain character was the murderer and then they end up being murdered too!  Very compelling viewing experience.,1389744000,,394,4.8059701492537314
4585751,5,B00560317S,"The actors who play Lewis, Hathaway and the pathologist are the best and the Oxford setting is very classy. The plots are well done and they don't find it necessary to get into the bloody violence. The violence occurs but the viewer usually joins in after the fact.

I am just being generous and for the sake of the atmospheric appeal of Oxford.  I am a huge fan of mysteries especially those from UK. I  have watched several episodes of this and really feel they are dull and lifeless.  The lead actors have charisma but they look tired when they keep talking.  Each time when the story or theirs conversions appear to be getting interesting, it is immediately switched into something tedious and irrelevant.  Obviously the producer wants to stretch this as much as possible for a 90 minute slot. Overall, the show looks like somebody who is in and out of a coma.  It is so hard to watch.  Quite frankly, this is the worst suspense series I have viewed coming out of Britain.",1385683200,,923,4.6894409937888195

The plot lines are complicated and allow each episode to develop at a deliberate pace without leaps of logic so common in American shows. The characters are equally complicated and diverse; Lewis is rarely akin to his mentor Inspector Morse, but shows insight clearly gleaned from his prior relationship.

Add to all this the magnificent locale of Oxford and its beautiful scenery this is a series for the ages; not since Colombo have I been this entertained while being literally forced to think. Not exhausting but a joy.",1381708800,,614,4.894230769230769

4585829,5,B00560317S,"Inspector Lewis is one of my all time favorites of the British mysteries.  The casting is excellent and the stories are surprisingly fresh considering how many years the city of Oxford has been used as background for murder and mayhem.  I almost went into mourning when Inspector Morse left us, followed too soon by John Thaw, so have enjoyed Lewis' progress thru the ranks and his own personal demons.  And who doesn't love Hathaway - such a fascinating character.  The interaction between the two of them is great.",1378944000,,516,4.829545454545454

4585834,5,B00560317S,I have all 6 seasons and love them all. The Inspector Lewis series is an extension of Morse. The characters have depth and they each contribute different perceptions on the cases. The back drop of Oxford makes for interesting murders from all classes of society. I also love the Midsomer Murders series. These series are the ones I will watch over and over and never tire of them!,1378252800,,380,4.602941176470588

4585845,4,B00560317S,I enjoy this mystery with his intellectual sidekick and the romantic tension between Inspector Lewis and the medical examiner. It goes on a bit too long. I'd rather see more one hour episodes than the 90 minute versions.,1377216000,,220,4.815789473684211

4585872,5,B00560317S,"I'm in love with ""Inspector Lewis"" in a way that I never fell completely head-over-heels for the show's predecessor, ""Morse."" By turning the ""Morse"" formula around, we now have Robbie Lewis, a Newcastle native -- true of the character as well as the actor -- perpetually in awe of the variety of ways that college-town and manufacturing center Oxford and Oxfordshire can get mixed up in elaborate and often tawdry crime. The show is up-to-the-minute in its depictions of high-tech and contemporary culture as well as up to its neck in references to British culture, the classics, poetry, and religion through the ages.

When the Robbie Lewis character was the sidekick to Morse (we've only just found out in the new prequel to ""Morse"" that the title character's first name was ""Endevour"") in the original series, the fish-out-of-water quality didn't show up as well as it does now that Lewis is the lead crime detective and James Hathaway is his cultured and native Oxfordian counterpart, and a former seminarian to boot! Season Four also pulls us closer to the developing romance of Lewis with Laura Hobson, the Oxfordshire Police Department's chief pathologist -- a sensible one-woman ""CSI.""

Finally, I love Lewis because it lovingly shows Oxford. Never is an establishing shot of the city's spire-scape and rivers used more than once, it seems. (Not so for its settings for Lewis and Hathaway's journeys on the ground. ""Lewis"" carefully but repeatedly uses the small set of streets to the north of the Bodleian Library's Radcliffe Camera from Holywell Street, New College, and Hertford College over to Balliol College and Broad Street in front of the famed Blackwell's book shop for its city and college center shots -- while never interrupting traffic flow on High Street one block away. Oxford does have a sort of sandstone-colored sameness to its architecture, but this technique emphasizes its unnecessarily while trimming production costs, no doubt. The result is world-famous places like Christ Church college are rarely featured in ""Lewis."")",1374796800,,2052,5.140718562874252

The characters and their relationships, the class politics, the humor, the humanity, the plotting, the setting - it all utterly addicts me. My only caveat is for those who, like me, really need closed captions or subtitles. If that describes you, get the DVDs, because the instant streaming for series 4 does not include any of these. Closed captions DO work on the DVDs from Season 1 on, so if you share my need for them, well, there's your caveat. That aside: enjoy!",1374624000,,561,4.6767676767676765

I see the writers and crew who continued on with Lewis (and now Endeavour) also respect the man's gift for character, plot and the wonderful background and history of Oxford. They also show awareness of power, class and undercurrents of such a closed environment. That said, you need not have viewed Morse to appreciate the quality of this series. The plots and characterizations are rich and stand on their own merit. Lewis and Hathaway are a wonderful team as were Lewis and Morse. This time the down-to-earth Geordie is schooling the academically-minded younger man. Lewis' intuitive comments often brought a puzzle into focus for Morse. Now Hathaway's logic shapes Lewis' passionate view of the mystery surrounding them. A wonderful series dependent upon knowledge of people's character and logic more than shoot-'em-up action.

(Miss Marple is a regular favorite as well, but it depends on who's in the title role.)

The Inspector Lewis series balances beautiful landscapes and wonderful views around Oxford with unusual story lines. In fact, the personality of Oxford is often as much a character as the people.

The stars and recurring characters in this series are what make the show.  The unique mix of plot twists and sense of being right there... that's what keeps me watching this series, even when it treads a little too far into ""eeeuuww"" territory.

I am surprisingly pleased with the Inspector Lewis character. I was scepticle that he could come out of the shadow of Inspector Morse.  A ""Geordie""* as a main character on British TV. His academic sidekick Sgt Hawthorne is equally attractive and at times very funny. Having an iconoclast as an assistant is an unusual plot twist. The supporting cast is equally attractive with witty contributing dialogue. As usual, the omnipresent class system is present between the Blues and the non-Blues of Oxford. Non Oxford/Cambridge  Universities in Britain are referred to as ""Red Brick"" as in non Ivy League schools here in the `States.
*Geordie is an affectionate term for a person from Tyneside, Newcastle, in the northeast of England.

4586008,5,B00560317S,"I was saddened when Morse ended and delighted to discover his Sergeant Robert  ""Robby"" Lewis back as the senior partner of his own show. Pairing him with a young erudite Hathaway is almost like a circle completing and is very enjoyable to watch.

Robby is still the ""common"" man as an outsider to Oxford society, but older, wiser and sadder. There will never  be another Morse (John Thaw) but the casting of Lawrence Fox's Hathaway as a former Cambridge seminary scholar gets us as close to the same feel of relationship between the partners without being disrespectful to the history of the characters.

I believe my favorite episode so far is ""Allegory of Love"", S3, EP1.",1363824000,,673,4.775862068965517

His eyes show the grief for his dead wife constantly. He may make a go of a new relationship, or so you keep hoping.

The new relationship with his sergeant is just as problematic, but like the Morse and Lewis pairing, you know that Lewis and Hathaway will manage to find a modus vivendi. Following that process is the key..",1362614400,,489,4.433333333333334

4586039,5,B00560317S,"Though it started as a spin-off from the immensely popular Morse series, by this point the fourth season of Lewis has well and truly found its stride, with Inspector Lewis and Sargent Hathaway forming a solid partnership despite their differences. Theyre right at home in a quintessential British crime drama, along with cups of tea, English accents, and beautiful Oxford architecture. Each episode is ninety minutes long (though this depends on the DVD; apparently the American version cuts out several minutes per episode) and is beautifully filmed, acted and presented.

The interplay between Lewis and Hathaway is a real treat. Lewis is the dogged, hard-working, by-the-books investigator, whilst Hathaway is droll, laconic and deceptively laid-back. Yet interestingly, it is the elder Lewis who is more temperamental and intuitive, whilst the younger Hathaway is calmer and more analytical. Furthermore, Lewis is an atheist whilst Hathaway struggles with his faith (and his chain-smoking habits). Over the course of the series weve been given plenty of insight into their lives (namely the death of Lewiss wife in a hit-and-run and Hathaways training as a priest) and now they make a great team, combing Lewiss experience with Hathaways higher education.

Also on board is Superintendent Jean Innocent, who oversees all of Lewiss cases (and who butts heads with him on more than one occasion) and Doctor Laura Hobson, the pathologist with a rather dark sense of humor. Each provides a dose of estrogen to the cast, and in the latter case, a possible love interest for Lewis.

The fifth main character is arguably Oxford, where all the mysteries are set. The show takes full advantage of this, with lingering panning shots over its beautiful buildings and winding streets. Everything looks clean and spacious and lovely. On a similar note, not only are many of the episode titles derived from literary quotes, but the episodes themselves are chocked full of references to famous writers and their work. When Lewis and Hathaway partake in banter, they often cite literature and history to each other  yet it never comes across as pretentious; instead they sound and feel like two intelligent, well-read men.

""Old, Unhappy, Far Off Things""

Lady Matildas College is undergoing some major changes; not only is one of their most prolific teachers moving on, but theyve made the decision to allow male students to enroll. As a party goes on downstairs, an ex-student heads up to the dormitories to fetch a cardigan  and is later found dead at the bottom of the stairs. Did she fall or was she pushed? Lewis thinks the latter, especially when he remembers why the crime scene is so familiar: he was there ten years before to investigate a young girl who was attacked at a masquerade and left in a coma. Could there possibly be a connection?

""Wild Justice""

An ecumenical conference at St. Gerard's college ends with the poisoning of a female priest visiting from America, last seen in the company of a mysterious hooded figure on the riverbank. The problem is that St Gerard is filled with hooded figures. Though Hathaway feels quite at home in the seminary, Lewis is more suspicious of the politics and intrigues that are going on between the monks  those that are ready to move into the 21st century and those that cling to tradition. The conflict revolves around the retirement of the Vice Regent and the vying of possible candidates to take his place  including Caroline Hope, who if successful, would be the first of her sex to be elected into the position.

But after the grisly death of another candidate, its clear that a serial killer is at work  one who seems to know a lot about Jacobean revenge plays given the nature of the murder and the words on a note pinned to the body: wild justice. All the clues point straight to Hope, who specializes in Jacobean literature, though even as she insists that shes being set-up, shes also reluctant to share the secret to her past that could shed light on the current killings.

""The Mind Has Mountains""

A beautiful young student is found dead during a residential clinical trial for a new anti-depressant. The building is filled with possible suspects: an intense soldier, a spoiled student, a shifty warehouse worker and his jealous girlfriend  not to mention the rather smarmy doctor in charge of the whole experiment. It soon becomes clear that the victim was the object of desire for several of the other patients, and that there are plenty of clues to be considered: notes, video diaries, phone messages, and overheard conversations. Most of them had a motive, but which of them is responsible?

""The Gift of Promise""

Former MI5 chief Grace Orde has written a memoir, one which is purchased by local businesswoman Andrea de Ritter. She has it signed for Leon Suskin, tucks a note inside the book: Who killed Mary? See chapter eight and has it dispatched to his house. The following day, she is found dead. Presumably this is the result of a blackmailing gone wrong, but Lewis and Hathaway are at a loss to connect the dots between author, victim and suspects. Lewis assumes that the answer may lie in chapter eight of the book, one that details the IRA murder of a Belfast university student in the 1980s. To solve the current mystery, they must unravel the past, discovering what exactly *did* happen to Mary.

All four mysteries are smoothly paced and exceptionally good at introducing a range of memorable characters in a relatively short space of time. Though each episode takes its time in setting the scene and exploring the suspects, it never gets slow, but rather builds gradually throughout the investigation up to its climax. There does seem to be a rather high body count this season (youd think Oxford would be flung into a state of widespread panic with so many serial killings) but the quality of the crimes and characters remains high.",1362096000,,5910,4.9097291875626885
4586040,1,B00560317S,"The first episode in this season is among the worst that they've produced. Tedious, contrived, and B-O-R-I-N-G.  The writers seem to have lost their edge.  Inspector Lewis deserves better.",1362009600,,188,5.448275862068965

4586086,5,B00560317S,"The ""Lewis"" series, five as of 2012, comes to us via a spin off of the old ""Inspector Morse"" TV programs where Lewis (Kevin Whately) was then the foil for Morse (John Thaw) as his Sergeant(read that as his gofer, driver, all around dogsbody).  Lewis has gotten older and wiser and treats his Sergeant (Laurence Fox) much better then what he received from Morse. The Sergeant, James Hathaway, is an ex-divinity school college graduate who is quite knowledgeable about many things sometimes to the disgust of Lewis.

As the series progress it becomes apparent that both men work well together although Lewis appears to have trouble with females.  His wife has died and he still grieves for her and it is obvious that the forensics pathologist has an interest in him.  There is a grown up daughter who we never see and his superior is a woman who is concerned about him not only on a professional level but also on a personal one.

It's a pleasure to watch this series as it does not batter the viewer with lots of blood and gore, car chases, explosions, and other special effects, etc. It does provide reasonable and intelligent solutions to the various programs that are seen.",1350950400,,1175,4.684466019417476

4586088,5,B00560317S,"This series continues it's run of excellence. I enjoy watching them more than once, which is unusual for a mystery series and something I've never experienced with American murder mystery shows. I think I appreciate the series even more after recently reading all of Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse novels.  It gives you a different perspective on Lewis, before he became the senior and also gives you insight on his relationship with Hathaway.  I'm looking forward to Season 5.",1350518400,,477,5.102564102564102

I'd heard about ""Original UK"" editions vs. regular US release formats, go UK- you'll get all of the original material and will get very little ""PBS"" stuff tacked on.

In addition to Kevin Whately (Lewis) and Clare Holman (Dr. Hobson), both veterans of the Morse series, Inspector Lewis features standout performances by Laurence Fox (of the magnificent Fox acting clan) as Lewis' assistant, Rebecca Front as the Chief Superintendent and a host of superb guest actors.

4586105,5,B00560317S,"I came to Inspector Lewis by way of Inspector Lynley, The Wire in the Blood, and the Touching Evil series. Amazon keeps recommending these series to me and I just keep watching them, one after the other, and I am well and truly hooked! Such intelligent writing, almost flawless acting, and high atmosphere. The Inspector Lynley and Inspector Lewis mysteries are a bit more toned down, focusing deeply on the investigative aspects of the crimes. The Wire in the Blood and Touching Evil series are much grittier, and focus more on serial killers, so the latter two series are definitely darker.

I discovered that the Inspector Lewis series came about after the end of the Inspector Morse show, one which I have yet to watch, but I plan to do so after I get through the entire Lewis series. In Inspector Lewis, there is DI Robbie Lewis played to consummate perfection by Kevin Whately, who I understand was a DS in the Inspector Morse series). He is assisted by the Cambridge-educated, brilliant, though solitary DS James Hathaway, who is portrayed by the amazing Laurence Fox). DI Lewis and DS Hathaway make a strange pair, as Lewis is more of a straight-talker and his emotions run close to the surface, whereas Hathaway masks his thoughts and emotions, you know the saying ""Still waters run deep..."". Yet the pair make a competent and brilliant team, working tirelessly together to solve the most baffling of crimes.

The unique thing about this series is that there's usually a spate of killings in each episode, tied into the same motive. The setting is the city of Oxford, so that in itself makes for a wonderful viewing experience, with scenes of the tall spires of the university and other beautiful buildings in the city.

There are four episodes (customers need to pay per episode for instant streaming, unless you're a Prime member in which case it is free), running about 1.5 hours each:
Old Unhappy Far Off Things - When bossy Poppy Toynton is found murdered at an all-ladies' college named Lady Matilda's, Lewis and Hathaway discover that some of the alumnae (who came to attend an event) may be harboring secrets dating back years ago.
Wild Justice - an American female bishop who is attending a multi-faith retreat is found dead, due to poisoning. Then several other people start turning up dead as well providing a headache for our investigative duo as they try to figure out the connections between the victims, and the possible motive for the murders.
The Mind Has Mountains - a beautiful young student Amy Katz is found dead one morning. She was part of a team taking part in a clinical trial for anti-depressants. The main suspect is Dr. Alex Gansa, who appears to have had an affair with her. But there are other suspects as well, and soon the case becomes even more complicated when another student, also part of the team, turns up dead.
The Gift of Promise - when the founder of an organization that supports gifted children, Andrea de Ritter, is found murdered, Lewis and Hathaway uncover the woman's secret life - one of promiscuity and ambition. Next, the young man involved with her ends up dead, and the trail of bodies piles up with the murder of a publisher whose 15-year-old daughter received a scholarship under Ritter's foundation. This proves to be a challenging and confounding case for both Lewis and Hathaway.

Good production, cinematography, and acting all contribute to a good end product. The writing is (overall) pretty strong, on par with the Morse series.

I am drawn to the characters in the series above all. The development of Lewis, Hathaway, and Hobson continues at a slow, realistic pace. There is nothing overdone in series; everything is kept at a realistic level.

It is nice to see on Blu-ray; great picture quality, something season one certainly did not have.

4586111,5,B00560317S,"Long time fans of the Inspector Morse series know Inspector Morse as a classic larger than life anti-social detective in the mold of Sherlock Holmes, Nero Wolfe and Inspector Poirot. Their sidekicks are like the plain friend of a beautiful girl, there to make the great man look even greater by comparison. Lewis was Morse's junior officer, mirror and sidekick for many years both in print and on screen. Few if any readers or viewers ever imagined Lewis leading a detecting team or Kevin Whateley carrying a television show. Thank goodness that the creators at ITV did imagine Lewis and Whateley leading the pack because it turns out that he and Lewis are more entertaining than Morse was.

Inspector Lewis is, as he puts it in one of the episodes, a non-commissioned officer in terms of the police force. That is, he has worked his way up the chain of command through doggedness rather than brilliance and he is the backbone and lifeblood of any service organization. He is smart but not brilliant, hard-wroking rather than given to the brilliant deduction, treats his subordinates with affection and respect, all things that would make him a good colleague, but a bore to watch. Not true, not true. Watching Lewis advance in the service and lead a detecting team and solve crimes is a joy and it is a joy mixed with a realism that the classic genius detectives could never match.

Sgt. James is Lewis's subordinate and he shines as the junior member of the team. The mysteries are well conceived, written and plotted and the solutions and the way Lewis and James arrive at them is natural and believable. I loved Morse and always felt sorry for Lewis. I am so glad that Lewis has gotten this chance to shine as a detective and a character. Highest recommendation to lovers of procedurals, English mysteries and BBC/ITV mysteries. Really wonderful.",1326931200,22,1850,4.7962382445141065

Inspector Lewis exceeds my expectations. The stories are great I love the Oxford scenery and imagine my surprise to see so many of the characters from Midsomer appearing in these episodes. As I do with anything I like I buy all of them and have to wait for new releases. I did see where there are four in production for the new season.

4586126,5,B00560317S,"So, I came to Inspector Lewis by way of Inspector Lynley, The Wire in the Blood, and the Touching Evil series. Amazon keeps recommending these series to me and I just keep watching them, one after the other, and I am well and truly hooked! Such intelligent writing, almost flawless acting, and high atmosphere. The Inspector Lynley and Inspector Lewis mysteries are a bit more toned down, focusing deeply on the investigative aspects of the crimes. The Wire in the Blood and Touching Evil series are much grittier, and focus more on serial killers, so the latter two series are definitely darker.

I discovered that the Inspector Lewis series came about after the end of the Inspector Morse show, one which I have yet to watch, but I plan to do so after I get through the entire Lewis series. In Inspector Lewis, there is DI Robbie Lewis  played to consummate perfection by Kevin Whately, who I understand was a DS in the Inspector Morse series). He is assisted by the Cambridge-educated, brilliant, though solitary DS James Hathaway, who is portrayed by the amazing Laurence Fox). DI Lewis and DS Hathaway make a strange pair, as Lewis is more of a straight-talker and his emotions run close to the surface, whereas Hathaway masks his thoughts and emotions, you know the saying ""Still waters run deep..."". Yet the pair make a competent and brilliant team, working tirelessly together to solve the most baffling of crimes.

The unique thing about this series is that there's usually a spate of killings in each episode, tied into the same motive. The setting is the city of Oxford, so that in itself makes for a wonderful viewing experience, with scenes of the tall spires of the university and other beautiful buildings in the city.

Though it states here that this is Season 4, I looked up the episode guide online and these episodes are listed as part of Season 5. In any case, there are four episodes, running about 1.5 hours each:
Old Unhappy Far Off Things - When bossy Poppy Toynton is found murdered at an all-ladies' college named Lady Matilda's, Lewis and Hathaway discover that some of the alumnae (who came to attend an event) may be harboring secrets dating back years ago.
Wild Justice - an American female bishop who is attending a multi-faith retreat is found dead, due to poisoning. Then several other people start turning up dead as well providing a headache for our investigative duo as they try to figure out the connections between the victims, and the possible motive for the murders.
The Mind Has Mountains - a beautiful young student Amy Katz is found dead one morning. She was part of a team taking part in a clinical trial for anti-depressants. The main suspect is Dr. Alex Gansa, who appears to have had an affair with her. But there are other suspects as well, and soon the case becomes even more complicated when another student, also part of the team, turns up dead.
The Gift of Promise - when the founder of an organization that supports gifted children, Andrea de Ritter, is found murdered, Lewis and Hathaway uncover the woman's secret life - one of promiscuity and ambition. Next, the young man involved with her ends up dead, and the trail of bodies piles up with the murder of a publisher whose 15-year-old daughter received a scholarship under Ritter's foundation. This proves to be a challenging and confounding case for both Lewis and Hathaway.

Now he's got a side-kick, James Hathaway (Laurence Fox), an ex-seminarian, ex-theology-major turned cop, a dead pan wit if ever there was one.  The relationship between the two is that of equals-not quite what it was in the Morse series--with much excellent detective work and some of the wittiest exchanges you'll find in a cop show.  Occasionally, the scenes are downright hilarious, e.g., as when the two, pursuing an investigation, visit a posh school where they are mistaken for a gay couple seeking to place their kid!  Hathaway takes comic advantage of the situation by putting his hand gently on Lewis' knee!  That's the stuff of high comedy.  That relationship between Lewis and Hathaway stands at the heart of the series.  The remaining cast is uniformly excellent, the murders compelling and plentiful-What's the murder rate in Oxford?--, and the investigations imaginative and compelling.

There are two problems, however, which is why I rate it a four and not a five.  First, the plots are extremely complex; try watching, for example, ""The Gift of Promise"" and then reciting the plot.  You're fine with the series for the first 80% of the story, but then watch out, as characters turn out to be other people (in Agatha Christie style) and past events are weighed as current evidence.  If you miss a single aside, even half a dozen words, you'll be baffled. You could use a notebook, take down the names of the many characters, and stop five or six times during the film to trace developments carefully.  But that's not entertainment.

Secondly, the series needs subtitles.  The splendid actor Laurence Fox, who plays the sidekick, is all too often unintelligible.  And if you miss a sentence or two from Fox, well, you won't enjoy the selection as much as you should.

Still, bring on number 5.  Inspector Lewis at its best equals its predecessor, the Inspector Morse series. At its worst, it beats anything of the kind made in America for a good many years.",1318896000,4,1301,4.758928571428571

4586139,4,B00560317S,"""Inspector Lewis Series 4"" (Series 5 in the UK) is an improvement over last year's fare in that the mysteries and their solutions consistently make sense. They're not realistic, but they conform to an internal logic. So thumbs up for the writing. As usual, all mysteries revolve around the halls of academe. Inspector Lewis and pathologist Laura Hobson (Clare Holman) are growing closer -and dancing around each other like schoolchildren, which is silly but not too annoying. Pacing is good. Chief Superintendent Innocent (Rebecca Front) is completely in the background, which is a little unfortunate. She's a good character. But the rapport between DI Lewis and DS Hathaway only gets better. Four 90-minute episodes on 2 discs. Subtitles available in English SDH. The episodes are:

""Old Unhappy, Faroff Things"" revolves around Oxford's only (fictional) women's college, Lady Matilda's. There is a reunion weekend to celebrate the school, attended by some protgs of the outspoken and influential Professor Diana Ellerby (Juliet Stevenson), among others. One student who remained close to Ellerby, Poppy Toynton (Kathryn O'Reilly), is found murdered on a staircase during a party. The case evokes a sense of dja vu, as 10 years ago, the sister of one of the students, Chloe Brooks (Antonia Campbell-Hughes), suffered an injury that left her in a coma, also during a party at the college. Lewis' interest in the old case is renewed, possibly to the detriment of the new one, as he and Hathaway try to piece together who had motive and what happened the night of the murder.

""Wild Justice"" takes us into St. Gerard's college, a conservative religious school whose vice-regent Father Mancini (Ronald Pickup) will soon be retiring. Two conservative friars, Stephen Blackmore (Nick Sidi) and Jeremy Swain, and two liberal women, professors Caroline Hope (Ameila Bullmore) and Joanna Pinnock (Sorcha Cusack), are running in an election to determine his successor. The college falls under a cloud when visiting American Bishop Helen Parsons (Pamela Nomvete) is poisoned by a bottle of the college's wine at a picnic following a controversial interfaith colloquium. It looks like she may have been targeted for her liberal religious views, but a series of other murders follow, with methodologies straight out of Jacobean revenge plays, Caroline's area of study.

""The Mind Has Mountains"" finds the detectives back in academic environs when a young woman, Amy Katz (Florence Brudenell-Bruce), is bludgeoned to death while participating in a trial for an anti-depressant medication. Psychiatrist Dr. Alex Gansa (Douglas Henshall) is using a dean's lodging to conduct a week-long trial on 6 people, with his research assistant Bethan Vicory (Lucy Liemann). Unable to cope since her brother's death in Afghanistan, Amy fancied herself in love with Gansa. She was cooped up in the house with Adam Douglas (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), an unstable student who stalked her, Jack Collins (Jack Roth), who oogled her constantly, and Afghan war veteran Dane Wise (Sam Hazeldine), among others, while the drug trial was not going very well.

""The Gift of Promise"" begins as Andrea De Ritter (Elize de Toit), head of a gifted children's scholarship program, asks Grace Orde (Cherie Lunghi), retired head of MI5, to sign her memoir to ""Leon"" before sending the book to Leon Suskin (David Westhead) with a cryptic note: ""who killed Mary, chapter 8, darling"". Andrea is then found murdered. Leon's 15-year-old daughter Zoe (Lucy Boynton) is taking a course at Oxford with a professor named Donald Voss (Mark Aiken), who has taken her under his wing. Her classmate and Andrea's lover, Elmo Woodeson (Matt Orton), dies under mysterious circumstances, and the bodies keep piling up. Lewis and Hathaway believe that the deaths may be related to a 1980s IRA murder mentioned in Orde's memoir.",1318118400,8,3862,5.244336569579288

4586141,5,B00560317S,"I prefer Lewis to the old Morse.  He has a lower middle class approach and a deceptive genius that makes everyone underestimate him, but his sargeant and the Chief Inspector understand just how good he is.  Great cast..great scripts.",1318032000,,233,4.948717948717949
4586142,5,B00560317S,"This series actually does get better and better with its complex mysteries, its spectacular settings, its superb musical score, and its outstanding cast, both the continuing characters and the supporting players, which, in each episode, present us some of the luminaries of the London theatre as well as film and television (This set includes Juliet Stevenson, Sian Phillips, Ronald Pickup, and Anna Chancellor).

The mysteries may be formulaic, but what a formula! They are elegant old-fashioned 'who-done-it?' puzzles that are nevertheless convoluted enough to keep us guessing, as we follow Robbie Lewis and James Hathaway gladly through the lanes of Oxford (and the camera focuses, for our benefit, on a carved gargoyle or gives us a closeup of one of the colleges' many gothic spires) to the gloriously picturesque scene of yet another ghastly crime in the hallowed university city that one might think to be the murder capital of the UK.

An essential ingredient of the formula is the ensemble cast of continuing characters: Kevin Whately as Inspector Lewis, Laurence Fox as Sergeant Hathaway, Claire Holman as Dr Laura Hobson, and Rebecca Front as Chief Superintendent Jean Innocent (What an ironic choice of a surname for a hardbitten Chief Superintendent of Police!). Their interaction--their humorous exchanges, their misunderstandings and tensions, as well as their mutual respect as professionals--represents the 'sand' that the brilliant writers have thrown into our eyes to distract us from solving the mystery until the last 'aha!' [or 'oh no!'] moment. In fact, Lewis, Hathaway, Hobson, and Innocent interact so beautifully that one can easily believe that they have become longtime colleagues, about whom we, the viewers, have come to care, as we would care about old friends.

I find myself laughing with Lewis and Hathaway at their little running jokes; hoping for the best as the romance between Robbie and Laura threatens to blossom; sympathising with both Lewis and Innocent, for different reasons, as each tries the other's patience; and even shedding a tear or two at some of the poignant moments that occur from time to time in the exchanges between Lewis and Hathaway.

I attribute my feelings of empathy to the remarkable abilities of Whately, Fox, Holman, and Front. Considering that the majority of their dialogue is devoted to the questioning of sundry suspects (Lewis and Hathaway), the enumeration of gruesome details about the current corpse (Hobson), or the barking at her wayward detectives because of pressures from budget cuts, Whitehall or the Chief Constable (Innocent),  we are actually glimpsing only fragments of their 'lives'--fragments that have progressed gradually from episode to episode, providing the bread, as it were, for dozens of delicious murder sandwiches (slathered with dollops of ketchup).

To appreciate the subtlety of these performances, one must watch ""Inspector Lewis"" from the first episode. And the Inspector Lewis mysteries are so rich and complex that one can enjoy them again and again (PBS has thoughtfully provided closed captioning so we won't miss a word of Lewis's gruff Geordie--or Hathaway's silken Cambridge--accent).

I'm sending out three hearty cheers: to ITV, for continuing this outstanding series; to PBS for sending us the original uncut UK edition, and to Amazon for bringing it to us at such a reasonable price.",1316995200,13,3396,5.324626865671642
4586143,5,B00560317S,"Many other reviews precede this and I won't attempt to define this edition, merely add my opinion.
The chemistry between Lewis and Hathaway continues to solidify. Now a true team, they elevate this series a bit more. The filming and direction remain perfectly suited to the locale. The tension and attraction between Lewis and Doctor Hobson is being stretched a bit too long but it still works. I wish Rebecca Front would be allowed a bit more involvement, perhaps an episode with her in the lead? A talented actor who needs a bit more freedom, she seems to have slid back a bit this season.
Attracting a fine cast of supporting talent is always a treat and I loved seeing Hattie Morahan with her wide range of expression in the last episode.
It's not Morse. It stands on it's own merits and I think the late John Thaw would agree and in all likelihood, become as big a fan of the series as am I.
The series is just slow getting out on DVD but I love the UK versions so it's worth the wait.

4586144,5,B00560317S,"After viewing Season four (4) of ""Lewis"", I came to the realization that I am enjoying this series as much as I have enjoyed the series of ""Morse"" that was so intently acted by John Thaw.  Indeed,  I did sense Morse's ""ghost"" hovering around this season of ""Lewis""; however, as I have always felt,  Lewis (wonderfully acted by Kevin Whatley) along with his young and mysterious (and very keenly astute to ""today's"" technology) partner Detective Hathaway( very brilliantly acted by  Laurence Fox) are  really very good at solving the very well written mysteries in Season four (4) of ""Lewis"" on two (2) discs with four (4) episodes that are about 1 hour and one-half each.

  Lewis and Hathaway have certainly settled into a superb team solving some ""nasty"" murders in this season four (4).  They ""play"" off each other so very well.  Lewis, not being ""up to"" the latest technology and getting a little frustrated with same and how police and detective work ""is done now"", is gently ""nudged"" into ""today"" by his partner detective Hathaway--I adore the character of Hathaway because he is so knowledgeable, efficient and so very helpful to Lewis while, at the same time, remaining very mysterious--I am always asking ""what is this guy ""all"" about? The character of Laura Hobson is ""on hand"" as a very good pathologist and a potential ""love interest"" for ""Lewis.

All in all, I really enjoyed Season four (4) of ""Lewis"" and really look forward to future seasons.

Be advised to remain alert during all of each episode because the audience is not ""spoon-fed"" clues,  I found that each episode was wonderfully challenging in trying to determine ""who done it?""",1316822400,4,1653,4.860714285714286

No cuts, smoother story line, no need to snip into a particular time slot. The characters get better each year. We are also eager for this series to continue!

4586147,4,B00560317S,"The Inspector Lewis series continues with 4 new episodes that are identical to the U.K. releases.  Beginning with Series Three PBS has been shipping the U.K. versions (for Region 1 US/Canada DVD players) without trimming 10 minutes off the story line and, most importantly, without the sneering PBS host irritating everyone before the opening credits.  These episodes continue the slightly melancholy but beautifully produced police procedural first viewed almost twenty five years ago with the ""Inspector Morse"" mysteries.

Lewis, once Morse's lackey D.S., is now a Detective Inspector and has his own sergeant,  James Hathaway.  Inspector Lewis, while more mature and now in charge, is pretty much the same character he played in ""Morse"".  Hathaway on the other hand is very much a younger, Cambridge educated version of what we might imagine Morse was like early in his career.  Like Morse, Hathaway is brilliant but flawed, so the critical dynamic of character remains the same in both series.  And, like in ""Inspector Morse"", the university plays a pivotal role just as important as the lead characters themselves.  While the Morse mysteries were elementarily more Gothic than ""Inspector Lewis"", the conflict of old religion intruding into the modern world is still an occasional thematic treatment.  As of yet we haven't been treated to story lines from the Greek classics, Italian opera or Wagnerian excess, but give it time. They did do a nice murder mystery involving the Romantic poets in seasons past, so Morse's legacy of the erudite policeman lives on.

Initially I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of Lewis' character development and kept wishing him to become more of a prototypical lead rather than just a member of the ensemble.  However, after 20 episodes I've now come to the conclusion that the producers have made reasonable choices and have produced a credible successor to the Morse mysteries.  If Lewis suddenly became a brilliant, dashing detective it would ring false and be obvious to all that his character was manufactured to fit the role rather than be a continuum of the Colin Dexter novels. However, as a sequel to the personality driven ""Inspector Morse"" it falls a bit short and can appear lacking in comparison. The on again/off again romance between Lewis and Dr. Hobson (nicely played by Clare Holman) is realistic and touching but, again, can be seen as a timid and indecisive device if the writers don't bring it to some sort of resolve.  Holman played the same role in the last couple Morse mysteries.

In all, ""Lewis"" is a treat for mature audiences and allows Morse to live on in ways that an annual viewing of the Morse episodes never could.  However it can border on being a bland and pretentious police procedural rather than a compelling personality driven detective series such as it's predecessor.  Whether it goes on to the long term success of ""Inspector Morse"" will largely depend on the quality of it's writing and the ability of the production team to create a narrative greater than a series of individual plots. Recommended, particularly if you're familiar with the predecessor to this series.",1316131200,12,3153,5.055984555984556
4586148,5,B00560317S,"More of what we love about Robbie Lewis, D.S. Hathaway and Laura Hobson, with no annoying introduction from Masterpiece Mystery or PBS!  The quality of the recording, both video and audio, is excellent.  The plots are intriguing.  And most of all, the relationships between the trio of main characters develop over the course of the episodes, giving ever more insight into the complexities of their personalities.  There is a new ease in the Lewis-Hathaway team, which only enhances the enjoyment of being in Oxford with Inspector Lewis!  While these episodes can stand alone, watch the earlier series first in order to appreciate the awkward, slow, and sometimes bittersweet road to a working relationship between Lewis and Hathaway, as well as the awakening of romantic feelings between Robbie and Laura.  There are so many layers to these episodes (the beautiful visuals of Oxford, the music, the characters and plot) that they can be watched again and again with no loss of enjoyment!  Getting this set early has one down-side, i.e., a longer wait for Inspector Lewis 5 (Season 6)!

The existence of his sidekick Sergeant Hathaway, who seems bright, adds to this impression. This episode begins with the discovery of a body of a man whose head was beat in with a blunt object. Lewis and Hathaway have to figure out how he got on a bus when he was killed some distance away in a church.

Since his death, DS Lewis his partner has gone through one crisis after another. His wife was killed, his partner died, but on the bright side he was promoted to DI. He is still with the Thames Valley Police Department, and  their turf is still Oxford. His new partner is a junior partner, Detective Sgt. James Hathaway, played by Laurence Fox,  who is the epitome of DI Morse! They have the same sort of class rivalry, but it is upended.

In this series, they deal with altered identities and crimes of retribution. DI Lewis is still having difficulty dealing with his wife's unsolved murder, so this is s 'come to momma' series. DS Lewis is much darker and his life is more complicated than the more frivolous Lewis we knew of yore. The murders in this series are incredibly complex, the stories much more updated and modern. DS Hathaway is from public school and Cambridge, so he seems to fit right in with the characters in these episodes. He smokes, was an athlete and once studied for the priesthood. He is tightly controlled , and he does not reveal much if anything of his background.

DI Lewis and DS Hathaway are the epitome of opposites attract, and they make the best pair of detectives. Masterpiece is known as giving us the best in performances, and once again, they deliver!
