8205587,5,B000SK5Z0C,"If you want to give WEW a try, this is the best volume I've seen. The events on this disc are  'Diva Destruction', 'No Rear Entry', 'Square Circle Seduction' and 'No Ho's Barred'.
 My favorite matches were Hell's Belles vs the Madison Girlz, all Tai 'Killer' Weed matches, all Angel Orsini matches, and all Mercedes Martinez matches.
 I also liked April Hunter, Persephone, Simply Luscious, and Lolipop.",1317859200,2,403,4.985074626865671
8205588,4,B000SK5Z0C,The wrestling is lighthearted and fun.  If you are a hardcore wrestling fan then this is not for you.  However if you like diva's wrestling in the wwe or in tna then this DVD was made for you.,1215388800,5,192,4.026315789473684
8205589,3,B000SK5Z0C,"The only thing worth watching as wrestling matches go, are the 2 matches with April Hunter. Yes, I know it inclueds the GI Ho thing and the lesbian stuff on it, but this is a wrestling company. If I want to see anything else I will go elsewhere.

Overall according to price this double set DVD comes with four PPV events for WEW. There are only a couple of matches worth your time, including a fatal 4 with the former wrestler Jazz on it. Also the matches involving Tai Killer Weed are okay and the extreme match is also cool.

Yes, I enjoyed watching the famous G.I. Ho doing her stuff with the referee, but since I want to watch wrestling, it bothers me that sometimes they are too busy promoting the sex part that WEW actually forgots about wrestling.

I recommend you buy this DVD only if you want to take a look at WEW or have curiosity for the price this DVD is worth you won't spend much but you will get a couple of good matches.

Not the level of wrestling on the WWE or anything, but at least enjoyable at some point.",1212192000,10,1027,4.224489795918367
