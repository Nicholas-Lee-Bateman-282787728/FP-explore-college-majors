8402620,3,B003QTBSUI,"The film attempts a spoof of Vampira with Slutpira (Izzie Harlow) who is the mistress of ceremony for 4 schlock (comedy + horror) segments. The segments demonstrate some cleverness, but falls short of genius. The low budget aspect was used as a plus for the feature, but wasn't. The features build up for a twist which weren't bad, yet somehow managed not to entertain. For those who have grown tired of Hollywood's hard bodies invading films, this will be a breath of fresh air as it appears they hired directly from the cellulite factory. The sound quality in the second feature was choppy.

Might have been fun if I was 16.  Outtakes on the same par as the features.",1431043200,,669,4.61344537815126
8402621,5,B003QTBSUI,"I went in with lowered expectations as I usually do with indie horror films, yet this one definitely surprised me! The comedy was great and the blood 'n guts weren't too ""fakey"" like you get with some indie horrors. The only real problem I had was with some of the credit fonts/animations, they were a bit over-the-top at times and one segment in fact went too fast for you to fully catch everything. Yet that was it, the only problem I could really think of. If you're into horror comedies, I definitely suggest this!",1390867200,3,518,4.5212765957446805
8402622,3,B003QTBSUI,it was ok movie you got four different titles which have there own little horror show. each show there horror in there own way that will surprise you in the film.,1353024000,2,162,4.258064516129032
8402623,3,B003QTBSUI,"Well as far as the horror and gore aspect, don't expect too much. However if you like a good comedy horror, this is near the top!! I couldn't stop laughing at how blatantly stupid all 4 of the short stories were in the film. Slutpira is just the icing on the cake. For those who love the cheesy, definitely get it. Otherwise save yourself some cash!!",1312934400,2,350,4.318181818181818
8402624,5,B003QTBSUI,"Faces Of Schlock is a collection of four short films weaved together to create one full length film. It's sort of like Creepshow. And in between each short film there is a hostess named Slutpira. The scenes with Slutpira are all fun and cool. There is plenty of gore and nudity (including bush!) in this film. My favorite short film included is One Foot In The Grave, which is hilarious and original. If you are a fan of independent films, supernatural horror, or slasher flicks, you should definately check out Faces Of Schlock. It's a treat!",1293148800,13,543,4.666666666666667
8402625,5,B003QTBSUI,"If this movie were shown nationwide on the silver screen, I would leave the theatre satisfied with a big ol' smile on my face.  I can't say that with many monster-budget hollywood films. It's not a perfect made film, but it is a heck of alot of fun to watch, and that's how I rate films.  If you are a fan of low-budget horror films with comedy, gore, and boobs, you should definately check this movie out.",1285632000,13,406,4.259740259740259
