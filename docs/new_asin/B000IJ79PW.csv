8145908,2,B000IJ79PW,"Specifically regarding the two disc set from Timeless Media Group for Passport to Danger starring Cesar Romero as Steve McQuinn, a U.S. State Department diplomatic courier. This series is similar to Dangerous Assignment or the Third Man and each episode is in a different city. Disc 1 features episodes titled: Geneva; Monte Carlo, Prague; Rome and Tangiers. Disc 2 has: Teheran; Casablanca; Budapest; Sofia; and, Turkey.

Passport to Danger was a fairly high-budget program with many sets. The scripts were fairly good. Unfortunately, the prints or videos used as a source for this collection are fair at best. All episodes are slightly faded and slightly soft. However, the greater problem is the digitizing or authoring: all the episodes have stutter frames or sporadic erratic images. It isn't major but certainly noticeable.

Also, the menu on disc one is poorly authored and you cannot  sequentially access episodes. The Critic's Choice DVD presents better quality versions of episodes: Geneva; Rome; Tangiers; and, Turkey. If you can find the Timeless Media collection for $3 or $4, it is worth such because Cesar Romero is enjoyable but, in my opinion not as good as Michael Rennie in the Third Man.",1215993600,11,1207,5.1479591836734695
