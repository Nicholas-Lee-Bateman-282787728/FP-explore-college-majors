1670025,5,B00005V4XW,I did not expectt his film to be funny at all. It was hilarious from start to finish. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend this movie as a pick up in troubled times!,1002844800,,172,4.088235294117647
1670026,5,B00005V4XW,"Barry Levinson has come through again with a great comedy that is really a very well made character story not unlike his previous work in Good Morning Vietnam or Wag the Dog. This is one of the few really good movies I've seen this year. This movie succeeds on the levels of comedy, characters, and technical achievement. Highly recommended.",1002585600,23,341,4.796610169491525
1670027,5,B00005V4XW,"I went to see this movie last night at one of the Seattle Sneak Preview venues.  I have to say that this was the best film I had seen in a long time.
Joe (Bruce Willis) and Terry (Billy Bob Thornton) are convicts in the Oregon State Prison.  On the spur of the moment Joe decides to hijack a cement truck and make good his escape.  Terry, a certifiable hypochondriac, goes along for the ride.  These two bank robbers become endearing figures to the audiance as they wreck havoc from Oregon, through Nevada into California.  Kate (Cate Blanchett) joins up with them as a permanent hostage while she tries to escape her boring life and marriage.
This movie is incredibly funny and quirky and I rate it a must see for Bruce Willis fans.  (p.s. there is some similarity between the comedic style and main character [Bruce] in this film and the film classic ""The Hudson Hawk"", also starring Bruce Willis!)
I also must mention an cameo apperance by the ever lovely KTLA Sky Cam reporter, Jennifer York.  She is only on screen for 10 seconds, but she does add a bit of grace to the film.",1002585600,47,1080,4.451776649746193
1670028,3,B00005V4XW,"The Sleepover Bandits are two of the most successful robbers on the West coast, hitting several banks in Oregon and California with effciency while keeping their identity concealed.  That is until a woman comes into their life, making things complicated for them in what turned out to be a messy love triangle.
Billy Bob Thornton really steals the show as the eccentric and quirky Terry, he has some of the best lines in the movie and a lot of physical comedy to go with it.  Cate Blanchett also shined as Kate, she did a good job portraying the disappointed and stressed out wife looking for some excitement in her life.  There really isn't much to say about Bruce Willis, his character Joe is the typical tough guy which we've seen him play numerous times, luckily his performance is a bit better than in the disappointing Whole Nine Yards.
Unfortunately, that's about the only good thing about Bandits, everything else are just mediocre.  The plot is so messy and aimless one would often wonder what's the point of the movie, the direction by Barry Levinson was average at best with the way he handled the flashback scenes.  But with all the flaws in the film, I still had a great time thanks to the good chemistry and interaction between the characters, and hilarious situations they often find themselves in.  Oscar material this is not, but if you're looking for a fun night at the theater, try Bandits on for size, you just might like it.",1002585600,12,1445,4.669291338582677

1670083,5,B00005V4XW,I love this quirky movie. Billy Bob is a hoot!,1506124800,,46,3.7
1670084,2,B00005V4XW,Couldn't finish the movie as it stopped working not even halfway through. I did get a refund but am so bummed I'm afraid to order another used DVD.,1505952000,,147,4.285714285714286
1670085,4,B00005V4XW,"A movie about bandits robbing banks?  Well, in a way Bandits is that.  It happens to be more about the couple of guys who are the bandits.  That makes it more than a crime caper.  This movie pulls you in but hardly due to criminal behavior as it quickly becomes a story of the relationship between two disparate prison escapees.  In this way the movie rises to something different, and better.

First theres two interesting main characters who play the escapee bandits.  The creation of these characters through intelligent and witty writing brings makes their union especially good.  What really brings the two to life is the portrayals of these two by Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton.  They raise excellent writing to a high level indeed through their individual talent and pure chemistry.  Part of the synergy between the two is certainly their often opposite approaches to life.  Williss smoothness is accentuated by Thorntons nervous brainy take on their situation.  Its like mixing oil and vinegar and with some added spices a great union results making each better.  The great enjoyment of this movie is seeing their diversity coming together in snappy dialog and brilliant answers in the form of their actions.  The added spices are quite well realized with their mentally affected driver Harvey played gloriously off-center by Troy Garity and a great lost and lonely female love interest Kate  played by the often scene stealing Kate Blanchett.  With Willis and Thorntons roles being played out so well its a high praise that Garity and Blanchett keep up so well.  As a viewer the criminal thing is just a vehicle for some quite special characters to unfold around.  As a viewer you relish their interplay much more than than the crimes everything revolves around.  I won't spoil the actual story other than to say its a very good palate in which all involved paint a modest masterpiece of characters you invest in and root for.  The ever present thread of comedy is the string that ties it together for pure entertainment.

Great colorful characters, a good story (sure theres plenty of holes and not a one that matters), witty and smart dialogue, and nice music seal this deal, director Barry Levisnon wrapped up one fantastic ride!",1505520000,,2247,4.891534391534392
1670086,2,B00005V4XW,The chemistry and dynamic between Wills and Thornton is forced. Billy Bob's character is annoying in the extreme. Blanchett does a great job but cant save the silly forced dynamic here. Lacks authenticity and the comedic routing doesn't land.,1505433600,4,242,5.230769230769231
1670087,5,B00005V4XW,"Great movie. I watched it probably 10 times over those 15-16 years. More often recently than before. Do not get me wrong, I like other movies. But only very few I watched several times. This one is special somehow to me. It has a mood, it has a rhythm, it has great music score. Finally, it has a great cast with the perfect chemistry between them. For a very long time, I could not understand what makes me watch this movie once in a while even though I remember almost all dialogs. Today I got it! It is a sense of freedom, a sense of being an outlaw. Unlike classic westerns that describe a life long time ago, this is about current (almost current) times. Bandits live it in a modern world full of strict rules in which we live. We - not bandits - abide by these rules. How to keep up a credit score high, what to eat to minimize payments on life insurance, what renovation to do to the house to maximize its value, etc, etc. Bandits are not like us. They do not care about all this. They somehow care about more mundane things such as how not to get caught. That leaves plenty of time for them to interact with each other. It turns out they are much better with this than most of us. Bandits really are friends. It is not a love story by all means. Even though they had sex but it is still not about love. These are friends who play together. Their playtime is a little bit dangerous and adventurous -- robbing a bank -- but it is a play none the less. During the movie, something tells you that you would love to be there, to play with them if not only the consequences of being caught... Right. Gosh! I have to pay my electricity bill, I totally forgot.",1504569600,,1660,4.190625

1670109,3,B00005V4XW,"Fun, especially like the way they wrapped it all up. Pretty good for a free movie, if you have prime. I would give it more stars, but it dragged in the middle. If you're looking for a caper movie to kill an evening this was a fun. We debated three or four stars, but settled on three.",1503014400,2,284,4.0
1670110,2,B00005V4XW,"The characters and acting are very good, Billy Bob especially.

It's the story line, very dull, seen it many, many times before, at about the 80 minute mark I started looking to see how much longer there was to go.
I stopped watching after an hour and forty minutes. Did I miss an amazing ending? Guess I'll never know...

The only twist to this tired tale is the ""two men one woman"" angle, but this can only carry a sub narrative NOT the main story.

1670323,4,B00005V4XW,"I liked this 2001 crime comedy. It is not a masterpiece, but a very entertaining thing. I spend a nice, relaxing moment watching it. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Joe Blake (Bruce Willis) and Terry Collins (Billy Bob Thornton) are two convicts, serving time in Oregon State Penitentiary. Blake is a tough, strong, menacing heavy and a man of few words when Collins is a neurotic, talkative, extraverted hypochondriac, but they are still nevertheless best friends. We never learn why they went to prison in the first place, but it is certain that they serve a rather long stretch, even if they don't have blood on their hands. One day they escape and as they don't have any money they decide to rob a bank. It turns out that they are good at it... Then they meet Kate Wheeler (Cate Blanchett), a wealthy housewife, who hates her life and her husband - and then things will never be the same again... I will say nothing more about the story.

This film is a comedy, which can be even watched in family, as there is no real violence, no sex and no strong language. It is the story of a gang of bank robbers who don't actually hurt people - which means it is pure fiction. There is a lot of humour, based mostly on dialogs. The film is never vulgar - jokes fly definitely higher than in most recent films. Actors are excellent, with Billy Rob Thornton giving an especially strong performance - his character of absolute hypochondriac was probably a prototype for Melman the giraffe from ""Madagascar"" (just shorter)... Cate Blanchett gives a great show, including a great kitchen dance and a singing moment which will live in infamy (Kate Wheeler is convinced she can sing - but she is wrong...). Bruce Willis is just being Bruce Willis and he is also doing a great job.

The reason why I give this film only fours stars is that things get a little bit weaker in the last 15 minutes and the ending of the last big heist is really entirely artificial and forced. However, it is still a very entertaining thing, which I enjoyed a lot and I can guarantee that it will give you a lot of merry laughs. I think I will keep the DVD for another viewing in the future.

1670414,5,B00005V4XW,"What's not to like in a movie shot on the Pacific Coast, with a great soundtrack, four great actors and twinkly turns from the supporting cast.  The movie is a comedy but starts like ""Reservoir Dogs"" so that made my husband leave the scene. Along the way we have a not so smirky Bruce Willis, a toned-down Billy Bob Thornton and an amazing Cate Blanchette.  The buddy movie ( ""Butch Cassidy"" riff) is told in flashback from the point of view of an ersatz John Walsh of ""America's Most Wanted"". Each of the capers has a separate set of flummoxed and not-so-flummoxed bank managers.  One of my favorite scenes is the wife of one bank manager explaining to the duo the nature of cataplexy. A grace note to Joe and Terry's prison escape is the Steve McQueen clip from ""The Great Escape"" added to one of their home invasions. This sets a tone of bittersweet doom.  Added to the mix is the  fumbling Harvey the possible failed stuntman and his pining for the elusive Claire, a girl in boots.  Shades of ""American Graffiti"". The twist at the end has been set up for you but is absolutely  fabulous in light of all preconceptions about the characters. I think the movie missed making money in theaters because its release date was October 2001 and no one wanted to watch a gun after 9/11, especially the

There are a few moments the delivery of dialog falls flat momentarily, but it's forgivable. As with many movies of that era, the use of God's name in vain repetitively is offensive.

1670522,5,B00005V4XW,"The film begins with a typical action film ambiance and with typical action film scenarios but something incredible happens before you know it. The action film turns from being serious in character to being totally absurd and pathetic. Once the viewer realizes that the drift has changed to the grotesque, one is either deeply in or rapidly out. I was tempted to stop watching it because the transition was silly and I had no idea whether it was going to be consistent or not. However, because the humor was successfully consistent I was captured by this weird comedy altogether. It appeared to be that this pathetic film turned to be extremely funny. Once you get attached to the characters and/or to their weaknesses and follies you become more and more curious as for how this bizarre film is going to end. This company of fools really nailed it! I have never seen Bruce Willis so funny in my life. Bruce here, in the most unlikely role ever made me laugh out loud and shed some tears of laughter owing to his strange relationship and absurd interaction with his semi retarded partner. I was really happy that this film took that humorous turn for I haven't had such a good laugh in a very long time. It is probably one of the top ten funniest films I have ever watched in my life. I definitely recommend it to all lovers of a good comedy.",1422403200,,1342,4.526748971193416

1670603,5,B00005V4XW,"I have owned this movie for several years.  I break it out every now and then and I never tire of it!!  This is truly one of the funniest movies I've ever experienced.  The script is brilliant and director Barry Levinson seems to just set the three stars loose to do their magic. Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett ingeniously play three very quirky, unique people.  They all three slide into these rolls as if they were telling their own stories.  I would advise watching this movie several times to get all the hilarious one-liners and all the weird little nuances of each character.  Even the supporting cast is just wonderful!!  There are too many great things about this tale to expound on here, but one of my favorite little tidbits is when Terry suddenly awakens saying, ""Chickens and ducks!!""  The first time I watched the film, I almost missed it.  It's a total scream EVERY TIME!!  Terry's extreme hypochondriac tendencies could become tedious and wearisome, if not so perfectly under-played by Billy Bob Thornton.  It's cute how they work into the film one of Billy Bob's real-life phobias-----antique furniture. Kate's attraction to both men is played so well, it seems perfectly normal. In Cate's first scene we see her cooking a gourmet meal for her husband.  She is playing rock and roll music and does the greatest exuberant and wild dance I have never seen. I have never witnessed Cate Blanchett perform any role which was not done with brilliance and style.  This woman can slip on a character like a well worn, comfortable coat and make you believe she is that character in every shadow and turn.

1670625,5,B00005V4XW,"I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in 2001, and I just recently watched it again. It was better than I remembered it. Although it is a little long, and can seem to drag on at times, I think that it is worth it in the end.

This isn't the type of movie that you can appreciate if you are doing other things while watching it, so I suggest that if you decide to watch this movie, do it when you are able to devote your full attention to it.

It is a fun twist on the bank robber movie, with likable characters.",1399766400,,525,3.943396226415094

The three (or four) main characters are as different from each other as they could be, and all totally stick to their characters and interact with one another like a well oiled engine.

It is about two prison inmates - one who acts strictly on impulse, and the other who relies on excessive logic -  break out of jail and rob banks. Mix them with a wealthy, bored housewife who becomes intrigued by the bandits' lifestyle and eventually ends up sleeping - and needing - both men - and you have a very funny conflict. I am no fan of the director whose other films I found dull, but this one is a keeper It might have been interesting if the two male leads had switched roles.",1393372800,,563,4.311320754716981

Brought me back to the days of Bruce and Cybill Shepherd; prior to his shoot-em up bang bang days.
I forgot that he started out in comedy. Thornton was hilarious. This movie even had the wife of Don (the character from Mad Men). She was majorly young, hardly recognized her.",1392249600,,362,4.338235294117647

1670702,5,B00005V4XW,While this went a bit long at times the banter between B.B. Thornton and B. Willis was spot on .  The show was funny! Almost heartwarming at times.

They are very polite bank robbers and go on to become iconic figures, picking up Kate (Cate Blanchett) along the way who forces herself into the gang as a ""hostage"" and becomes part of a love triangle. She has similar issues and hobbies as Terry making the quirky characters the highlight of the film.

Blanchett excels in a film where no acting is required. The humor was not a knee slapper, but did make me smile.

Slightly seedy dudes and an unhappy wife bumble through one bank robbery after another, yet they wiggle past the grasp of the police every time. The characters are likeable, neurotic and even loveable. It was nice that even though it had a PG-13 rating for sexual situations, language and violence, I did not feel pelted with sex, f-bombs and blood/gore.

Billy Bob is an overly bright hypochondriac who is also a bank robber and wants desperately to have a love life but Bruce always gets the girls. There is a lot of action that isn't predictable and keeps us guessing.  A wonderfully funny dance sequence that I still
giggle about when I think of it. This movie is true escapism and honest guffaws.",1389916800,,481,4.593023255813954

1670974,3,B00005V4XW,"In Bandits (2001), Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton star as two eclectic escaped cons, engaged in a string of notorious bank robberies, that captures the imagination of the public, and the heart of a wayward housewife played by Cate Blanchet.  The crime adventure/comedy directed by Barry Levinson (The Natural, Rain Man), has a few moments of excitement, but the focus is more on the particular relationship of the three principle characters.  If you are looking for a kinetic crime thriller, this is not it.

Joe Blake (Willis) and Terry Collins (Thornton) are doing time in prison, when Blake decides to make an impromptu escape attempt in a cement truck.  After getting clear of the police, the pair decide to turn to bank robbery to raise some cash, and recruit Harvey Pollard (Troy Garity) an aspiring stunt man, to become their getaway driver.  The robber's method of operation is to visit the home of the manager of the bank they plan to rob, stay with them overnight, and then accompany the manager to work the following day, and loot the bank.  The success of this method, earns the robbers the nickname the ""sleepover bandits"".

While on his way to rendezvous with his partners, Collins meets an agitated Kate Wheeler (Blanchet) who provides transportation to a cabin in the woods.  Kate is on the run from a troubled marriage, and she and Joe find common ground discussing the lyrics of Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse off the Heart, and almost immediately become lovers.  Choosing to leave her past life behind, Kate becomes a member of the gang, but things get further complicated when Terry and Kate also get romantically involved.

The non-linear story is told in a series of flashbacks, many which feature comic Bobby Slayton as Darren Smith, the host of a news program called Criminals At Large.  Smith is reporting the death of the Sleepover Bandits during a bank robbery, and airing segments of his interview with Collins and Blake, conducted after they forced their way into his apartment.  Eventually real time events catch up with those in the flashbacks, and the film comes to a close.

Bandits is a lively offbeat crime drama that is mostly interesting because of the interplay between the three lead actors.  Billy Bob Thornton is adept at playing a jumpy, nerdy type, while Bruce Willis is capable of being great at any kind of role.  Cate Blanchet's character Kate, who can't choose between her two lovers, is the factor that adds some sappy romantic elements to the goofy crime spree.  Like a magician's trick, the ending is creative, though not very convincing, but then nothing that happens was meant to be taken seriously anyway.",1319846400,,2661,4.88
1670985,4,B00005V4XW,"The DVD extras explain that there were lots of problems regarding the development of this film. Levinson admits he didn't know what direction to go... The result is a terrific, crazy road trip, full of insane behavior and endearing characters. Theatre of the absurd comes to mind, but the characters are more realized than that. Willis, Billy Bob and Cate are a great group of talent, but I most enjoyed Troy Garity as the biggest dreamer in the bunch, a real sweetheart. Where is he now? He's Jane Fonda's son, but I haven't heard of him since...  Based on true events, which makes the mind boggle. I had fun watching it, but it was quite disjointed regarding plot development.",1313884800,,678,4.697478991596639

1670987,5,B00005V4XW,"This 2001 two hours and three minutes film is advertised in USA Today as ""Flat-out funny,"" and it is. Willis, Thornton, Blanchett, and the supporting cast act very well and we come to like their characters. Willis with wild hair is impulsive and a womanizer. He generally acts without thinking, as when he is in prison, sees an opportunity to escape, and does so despite a rain of bullets, which could have killed him. Thornton is a hypochondriac. He constantly complains, which we see as humorous, about having some medical problem. His largest fear is that he has a brain tumor. He and Willis are close friends and he is the thinker of the pair. Willis wants to buy land in Mexico and live in a paradise. Thornton suggests that they rob banks by going to the home of bank managers the night before the bank opens, stay over, and force the manager to open the vault in the morning. They are successful, and the newspaper calls them ""The Sleepover Bandits.""

Blanchett is a dissatisfied wife of a very neglectful husband. One day when she is driving away from her house, she smashes into Thornton, recognizes him as one of the Sleepover Bandits, and insists upon joining them. Both Willis and Thornton are sexually attracted to her, and this causes funny complications.

We are told in the beginning of the film that Willis and Thornton die in their last holdup. We see them in the bank surrounded by many police before there is a flashback of their career.  But there is a surprise ending.",1291161600,,1490,4.636363636363637

1670989,1,B00005V4XW,"This movie could have been a lot better. There could have been a concise, fast-moving plot, and everything!
There wasn't.
I laughed TWICE throughout this thing, and both times were thanks to Cate Blanchett: the first, when she was dancing around in her kitchen to 'Holding Out For A Hero'; the second, because one of the wigs she wore in a disguise reminded me of Agent Spalko from Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
The framing device of flashbacks (Bobby Slayton? Really? REALLY?) added too much time, as well as nothing to the 'surprise' ending (who REALLY thought our beloved angry Joe and hypochondriac Terry would get it in the end? C'mon, now).
Basically, if you're thinking about renting this, make sure that you have absolutely NOTHING else you want to do with 123 minutes of your life. If I could have given it minus stars, I would have; it gets one for Cate Blanchett (who looks even better with red hair).",1266969600,,912,4.670807453416149
1670990,5,B00005V4XW,"""Bandits"" is such an abundant movie because it's a comedy, an action picture and even a drama and a love story. Shown in flashbacks, ""Bandits"" tells the story of two fugitives, Terry Collins (Billy Bob Thornton) and Joe Blake (Bruce Willis) who cook up an elaborate scheme to rob a string of banks. Along the way the guys meet a lonely and despondent housewife trapped in suburbia-Hell, Kate (Cate Blanchett). The movie is so much fun because all of the characters are multi-faceted. There was something very sensitive about Joe and I couldn't tell if he was the leader of the group or not. At first it seemed like he was in charge but as the story went on it got more difficult to tell. The movie doesn't take itself seriously and is the type that you laugh at and feel good about. It reminded me very much of one of my very favorite movies ""Quick Change"" because the dialog was not just real but extraordinarily funny. It wasn't done in a silly way though, a lot of it was very subtle and deadpan. If you're like me you'll find yourself routing for Joe and Terry.

1670991,4,B00005V4XW,"I've reviewed this film once before for this site, under another name, and so writing this review and not sounding like a complete copy cat is going to be hard (I challenge you to find my previous persona).

Really, my sole reason for seeing and or owning this movie has to do with Bruce Willis.  I've been a fan for a LONG time and really consider him one of our most underrated actors.  Sure, he has a lot of fans and makes a lot of movies, but not many consider him a great `actor', but his comedic timing is on point and his dramatic delivery is remarkable (just watch him wince in internal pain in `The Sixth Sense' or dance comedic circles around the entire cast of `The While Nine Yards').  So, when `Bandits' dropped I was anxiously awaiting its arrival.  Having seen it numerous times I have to now agree with many who claim this movie to really be a woman's show.

Cate Blanchett OWNS this movie.

When we first meet Kate Wheeler she is cooking dinner and winds up making musical (and comedic) magic with the pots hanging in her kitchen.  I was instantly smitten with her sensual chemistry with the camera.  She engages you effortlessly and really sinks into the slinky comedic organism that is Kate.  Wheeler gets wrapped up in the life of crime when she meets `The Sleepover Bandits', escaped convicts Joe and Terry.  She soon finds that this life on the run is providing her with everything her current marriage is depriving her of; freedom.

I'll refrain from given away too much of the film, but the love triangle angle is obvious, yet refreshingly handled.

What I love so much about Blanchett's performance is that she takes a character that we've seen before and actually makes her make sense.  She breathes so much charismatic light into this character that you completely understand WHY these two men are drawn to her and ultimately fall in love with her.  She is not only stunning (truly stunning) but she is naturally delightful.  Her presence just lights up the whole screen and brings out the best in her co-stars.  Willis is not as sharp as he has been before, and Billy-Bob is probably funnier than he has ever been (his neurotic, near Woody Allen persona is instantly infectious and riotous) but he still can't bring Cate down from her high podium of greatness.

This film has some flaws, but they are masked by hearty performances and a well rounded script that layers the flaws with enough laughs to steal your attention.  It's a great little comedy that provides a nice little escape from reality and serves up plenty of laughs.

And of course, there is Cate the great!",1266278400,2,2599,4.608695652173913

1670995,3,B00005V4XW,"Joe Blake (Bruce Willis) and Terry Collins (Billy Bob Thornton) have just busted out of jail and within minutes rob decide to rob a bank to get some quick cash. But they aren't your regular hot headed bank robbers, they are calm and passive... and effective. After their quick heist they hide out and begin to make plans for the future, plans that will need money. And since they are bank robbers, they decide to use that skill to get that money. They come up with a scheme to rob banks before they open in the morning. To do that, they go to the bank managers house at night and they basically let the manager know they are going to rob the bank and then they stay the night with him or her until it's time to rob the bank... hence the name ""The Sleepover Bandits"". Then one day, Terry is hit by a car driven by Kate Wheeler (Cate Blanchett). She freaks out and tries to help him, but then gets caught up in Terry and Joe's crazy world, mainly because she's bored with her life and needs some action. The media is in love with the duo, as well as the public. A blessing and a curse, because now they are not as frightened of them, leading into some troublesome incidents. Incidents that are getting them close to getting caught. With a million dollar reward on their capture, they must come up with a plan to stay hidden forever, before they are finally caught... or before their little gang implodes from the inside.

I have some very mixed feelings about this movie. I'll lay it down like this. If this movie ONLY had Bruce Willis and Billy Bob's characters, as well as Troy Garity's character (their driver who wants to be a movie stunt man), then I think this movie could've been great. But with Cate Blanchett's character it becomes less about the heists and a little more to do with a love triangle. An absolutely dumb love triangle. Yes Cate is very pretty and I could see her causing a love triangle, but did we really need this? She makes the duo become a total mess at times. When the movie first starts out, it seems like it's going to be a lot of fun, because the duo are very good friends with one being a cool and smooth Alpha Dog kind of guy (Bruce Willis) while the other is a very smart, but a huge hypochondriac  (Billy Bob).  Then Cate gets thrown in and steals the heart of Bruce, to only steal the heart of Billy Bob later. And most of the lovey dovey parts just seemed so out of place for me. I was much more into the slick idea of the bank heists that they were pulling.

But that is really my only complaint. Other than that, the movie is pretty darn good. Much better than the first time I remember watching it. The heists are cool. The jokes between everyone are funny. And watching Harvey (Troy Garity) run around with flaming hands was a hoot... yeah I said hoot...wut up. With a cool twist of an ending, the movie does entertain, as long as you can get ignore some of the more unbelievable stuff and also not care about the love triangle.

Definitely give this a rent if you haven't seen it. It might just surprise ya.

P.S. - I loved the line that Terry tells Kate when she comes to his hotel room one night. ""Kate, there are guys who leave, and there are guys who get left. I don't think it's any mystery as to which category I fall into."" It really made me feel bad for Terry. Billy Bob is such a good actor.",1242086400,2,3341,4.261829652996846

If the film wasn't as charming and likable, I'd probably have a difficult time suspending disbelief. But then I found out the story of the ""Sleepover Bandits"" was actually based on a real duo of bank robbers. Of course, this is nowhere close to a biopic and most of the story is obviously fiction, the concept of these two guys sleeping over the bank managers' houses and robbing their banks the next morning was based on truth. Why these managers didn't call the cops while the two guys weren't watching or why they didn't try to strangle the two guys in their sleep--I don't know. The truth really is stranger than fiction. But the bandits did have an interesting gimmick: they only robbed banks, since the money belonged to the government; they never snatched money from people's pockets. There's actually a scene in the movie in which they bust out of prison and rob a lady's car.

The ending was surprising, so I won't give it away...but this is just one movie that I can watch over and over and laugh every time!

1671003,4,B00005V4XW,"I usually watch films alone or with one other person--just my little quirk.  BANDITS was the rare film that I watched with several other people after a pleasant dinner at the home of one of them (the best cook of all, fortunately!).  As an ""evening's entertainment,"" the Bruce Willis/Billy Bob Thornton caper was just right, for the most part.  But in the back of my mind, I'll admit, I kept wondering what kind of impression the film would have made in a less convivial setting.

BANDITS has lots of genuinely funny moments--and an equal number of ones that fall flat.  But it's such a likeable bit of fluff overall that you can (at least under the right circumstances) forgive it its flaws.  Willis and Thornton could be accused of doing shtick, I suppose, but it's masterful shtick at least.  Yes, I'd have to agree with those who find Billy Bob's Terry Lee character just a little too damn neurotic (and dysfunctionally hypochondriac) to actually pull off a series of bank robberies and daring escapes.  But at least in the mood I was in while watching, my attitude was more along the lines of ""Hey, it's an ""action comedy"" not Ibsen.""

I will let the debate over Cate Blanchett's being cast as Kate Wheeler, the frustrated LA hausfrau who escapes her confining marriage to join up with hese two self-styled latter day Robin Hoods.  This argument will likely continue for as long as people are still checking this movie out for the first time.  For those doubters out there, I say, look beyond he impeccable American accent (and it IS that) and see her performance for the marvel it is.  It's always fun to see a gifted dramactic actor getting the chance to let her flaming red hair down.  (Have her and Tori Amos stand in field, and you could use them to land airplanes.) It's also nice when said gifted dramatic actor can pull said knock-off role off without appearing to be overtly slumming.

But the movie still suffers from the too-long--and maybe a little too cute for its own good syndrome.  The longueurs do start to set in well before the film's actual end.  You may have heard or read that the film has a delightful twist at the end.  Well, you're likely to see it coming, if you've been paying any kind of attention to the plot at all.  Which doesn't mean to imply that it all suddenly falls together and (just as suddenly) falls into place.  Just how smart are these guys supposed to be anyway?

You are likely to enjoy this flick if you view it as just that, a MOVIE MOVIE. It was only AFTER seeing it with my friends the other night that I went back and read some of the rather mixed criticism that the movie received upon its release (and since!).  And, ironically, for once I'm less on the side of the film crit establisshment than on that of the easy-to- entertain masses).  I can well see the point of those who complain that this movie doesn't quite achieve what it sets out to do (as either a caper film or as a latter day screwball comedy), but still, as an evening's entertainment, it was just fine.",1182816000,2,3025,4.511926605504587

Now, after having watched this film numerous times, I realize that what does it for me is not Bruce but the magic that the wonderfully talented Cate Blanchett brings to this movie.  As Kate Wheeler, the bored and unsatisfied housewife, Cate infuses enough warmth, charm and charismatic insanity to make her character the most likable and memorable of the bunch.

The story follows Joe Blake (Bruce Willis) and Terry Lee Collins (Billy Bob Thornton) as they escape from prison and set out as `The Sleepover Bandits', kidnapping the bank managers the night before the heist in order to rob the bank minus the hassle of alarms and security.  Their plan is to steal enough money so they can open a resort in Mexico and live normal lives.  Along the way they pick up Joe's cousin Harvey (Troy Garity), an aspiring stuntman, to drive the getaway car.  It's only when they run into Kate Wheeler that things get complicated.  Initially Kate is drawn to Joe for the mere fact that he's everything her husband isn't.  He's strong, attentive and interested in her.

After a series of events beyond anyone's control (like a car wreck and a police pursuit) Kate ends up hiding out with Terry and not Joe, and this leads to her attraction to Terry because of his sympathetic and gentle aura.  She can't help but fall in love with him.  When the three of them are reunited this love triangle causes conflict within the group and compromises their relationship as well as their plans.  Hilarity can be found throughout the film, whether it's focused on Terry neuroticism or hearing Terry threaten to kill anyone who tries to call the police.

Cate Blanchett, as beautiful as I've ever seen her, completely steals the show here.  She has one of the best character introductions I've ever scene, just watching her sing and dance in her kitchen, banging on pots and pans as if they were instruments and she were a star.  She illuminates the screen and truly makes you believe that these two men could be that head over heals for her.  Bruce Willis is charming but somewhat stale here.  He doesn't bring that same fire he normally brings to a role, but I still love him even with the bad hair.  Billy Bob provides plenty of laughs, especially when he's flopping on the bar-room floor, but he still can't hold a candle to Cate's commanding presence.

`Bandits' is funny and charming and will provide entertainment to any age group.  It may not be the most effective comedy/crime drama but it hits plenty of marks and is deemed worthy of multiple viewings.

The trick here is to make things that are so improbable that they necessarily succeed because no one is expecting such antics. This of course goes against the grain of modern policework based essentially on profiling. If thieves or criminals become unpredictable, hence impossible to profile, they will escape any attempt to arrest them. In other words this is the best pedagogical film for would-be criminals of the after profiling era. But that has already been done. The originality of this film is the general light tone that dominates all along. These bandits are entertining themselves in this boring life of theirs and they are entertaining us at the same time because bankrobbery is show bizz and nothing else.

1671045,3,B00005V4XW,"""Bandits"" is not the best movie ever made, but it is made with such skill and talent that it rises head and shoulders above the rest of the dreck out there.

Joe (Bruce Willis) has anger-management issues. Terry (Billy Bob Thornton) is a hypochondriac. In prison, they have formed a friendship that each seems to rely on. One day, Joe impulsively decides to break out, using an unattended cement mixer. Terry quickly jumps in and they are free. After they have eluded the cops, they quickly form a foolproof plan to rob banks. They will visit the bank manager at home, the night before, stay with them, and then rob the bank the next morning. Joe enlists the aid of his slow-witted cousin, a young man interested in becoming a stuntman, to be their driver. The first such robbery goes off without a hitch and they quickly become known as the Sleep Over bandits. The threesome split up and agree to meet two weeks later at their next location. En route to the meeting, Terry runs out of gas. Walking to get more gas, he is hit by Kate (Cate Blanchett). She insists on taking him to the doctor and when she figures out who and what he is, she decides to go along for the ride, to escape from her oppressive marriage. Joe is very interested in Kate and the three form a strange sort of relationship.

Written by Harley Peyton and directed by Barry Levinson, ""Bandits"" is a strange little slice of wonderful. The film tells the story using a strange mixture of styles. At times, we think the story is told in flashback, using a climatic bank robbery in Century City, Los Angeles, as the catalyst. Other times, the story seems to be part of a documentary on an ""America's Most Wanted"" clone. This strange mix works, most of the time, creating a strange sense of pacing that helps to reveal the characters and keep us laughing at their eccentricities.

Bruce Willis' portrayal of Joe is the least flashy and least interesting. Joe is the strong, silent type and Willis does this well, but he doesn't have a lot to work with here.

Billy Bob Thornton plays Terry with an abandon that we haven't seen from him. Terry is a hypochondriac and he plays the character to perfection. He masterfully avoids crossing over into cartoon territory and manages to keep the character believable and interesting. Sporting a series of ridiculous wigs as disguises and constantly `coming down with something', his character just seems completely different from the type of person he normally plays. Slightly effeminate, high strung, always nervous, he is also extremely funny. I roared with laughter when Terry wakes up and shouts ""Rabbits and beavers"" at the top of his lungs in a small cabin. This is obviously yet another phobia of his and the point is illustrated quickly and bizarrely.

The first time we see Cate Blanchett, Kate is replacing a light bulb in her refrigerator. As she puts in the blue light, her features are washed in a soft, blue light that only serves to make her already stunning features even more beautiful. The only reason I can think of for this moment is that Barry Levinson was equally captivated with her looks. Can't blame him. Blanchett is easily one of the most beautiful actresses working in film today. Beyond that, she is also an excellent actress. She effortlessly creates the role of a deeply disillusioned American housewife and makes it seem so real. She is also very funny, but her role is more serious, providing a catalyst between the two men. Once both men have fallen in love with her, there is an especially good scene. She knocks on Terry's door. He smiles expectantly, they share a few words. She says good night. Then she knocks on Joe's door. He smiles expectantly, they share a few words and she says good night. She goes to bed alone.

""Bandits"" is an excellent comedy for adults to enjoy. The actors are adults and do things adults would do and say funny things adults would do. What a refreshing thing to see. We can laugh at the situations these adults get in as they travel down the West Coast, from Oregon to Los Angeles. Even more refreshing is that the film doesn't rely (or even contain) any `bathroom humor'. We aren't expected to laugh at someone drinking beer with something added to it, or at people acting dumb.

If anything, ""Bandits"" suffers from the unique pacing it establishes early on. As the film progresses, the mixture of styles and pacing wears a little thin and one of the plot machinations becomes very obvious, slowing things down a little. But this is a small price to pay for an overall excellent film.",1113264000,6,4560,4.650124069478908

Whether she's dancing along to HOLDING OUT FOR A HERO, or unable to sing along with heartbreaking TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE HEART, Blanchett proves her star status by showing us all the aspects of her character's personality.  She can be tender, feisty, sexy or coy, and she makes her character a pivotal point of interest.  Bruce and Billy Bob, however, are excellent as the two Sleepover Bandits, whose gentlemanly charm has made them kind of national heroes in the public's warped eyes.  Thornton's neurotic hypochondrias is funny and his nervous optic tic adds dimension.  Willis shows a sensitive side too, and Troy Garity as their mentally challenged stuntman friend is perfect.  Director Barry Levinson lets us down a little in the middle of the picture by slowing the pace a little too much, but by the end of the movie, we are back with the main plot and its predictable yet clever ending is satisfying.  BANDITS is a well done movie, and thanks to its talented cast, particularly Oscar nominee Blanchett, it soars.",1109462400,,1402,4.8125

Actors aside, the multi-layed flashbacks of the script are thrilling and clever, with a doozy scenario of the suavest outlaws you've seen in a while.
The romance (triangular, no less) is interesting and the dialogue sports several quotable quips. 75% into the movie, the romance dragged for a 5-6 minutes, but that is forgiveable.

It is well acted and cleverly scripted, with dozens of situations and conversations that are very funny. Of course, disaster threatens at the end, but, because we know this is a comedy, we expect that it will be avoided in some way, hopefully in a surprising but fairly plausible manner. Although viewers who pay attention will be able to guess the actual happy ending correctly, this ability will not detract from their enjoyment any more than it did if they correctly foresaw the ending to the film DAVE.

1671062,4,B00005V4XW,"Anything Barry Levinson touches turns into gold, you might say he's got the Midas touch... With the cast that includes Billy Bob Thornton and Bruce Willis, this was almost destined to be a great film. Neither Thornton, nor Willis are known for their comedy, but this movie is funny. Although it is usually billed as comedy/drama, it actually overlaps several genre: comedy, action, adventure, drama, and suspense.
Thornton and Willis are escaped convicts who go on a spree, robbing banks left and right by taking the bank manager hostage the night before robbery and then using his key to access the vault the next morning, before anyone else has a chance to get to the bank. Their road-trip is facilitated by a series of car jackings, during one of which Thornton's character, Terry, picks up a bored, unappreciated housewife, Kate, who becomes a partner in crime.
A romance soon develops. First, between Joe (played by Willis) and Kate and later between Terry and Kate. This strange love triangle is made even stranger by the sporadic presence of a stunt man who helps Joe and Terry with their robberies.
Billy Bob is in one of his best roles here, portraying an intelligent, witty, hypochondriacal and neurotic criminal who is the ""brains"" behind the bandits' robberies. Willis also turns in a good performance, and so does the supporting  cast.
This is not a laugh out loud movie, but it is witty and entertaining, and I did root for the bandits, especially in the very end as their lives were in the balance and seemed about to end. Although the experience portrayed in the movie is a bit farcical, I definitely recommend this as a witty and entertaining movie.",1068508800,2,1666,4.825174825174825
1671063,5,B00005V4XW,This movie is great! It is losely based on a true story about 2 bank robbers who escaped from prison and began sleeping over at the bank managers houses the night before they robbed the bank so that they could get a meal and a place to sleep. That is what Joe (Bruce Willis) and Terry (Billy Bob Thorton) do - sleep at bank managers houses and then rob the banks the next morning before the banks even open. Along the way they pick up a stunt man who drives the getaway car and a mentally unhinged woman on the run from her marriage (Cate Blanchett). Billy Bob Thorton is hilarious! Probably the funniest role I have ever seen him play. he plays an obsessive compulsice hypochondriac with a scroll of diagnosis'.

1671064,1,B00005V4XW,"There have been enough heist films to do a weeklong twenty-four seven film festivals with no repeats. Playing at 4 am on Tuesday morning, you'll find Bandits, a take on Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, with post-Sopranos psychological drama, but light and fluffy as any comedy. The real gift of a lot of crime pictures is their ability to make us care about the con men who feature. The good crime films bring enough charm and righteousness to the criminals to make us root for them. So if a film in this genre is to succeed, it must make us like the heroes.
Bandits on the other hand, features Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton as two convicts doing time in the pokey. The former is sort of a zen redneck who fluctuates between incredible smoothness and hippie vapidity. That's either the character or Bruce himself, it's hard to tell which. Thornton, on the other hand, is an uptight, anal-retentive hypochondriac who prizes himself for his brains.
One day in the yard, Bruce Willis steals a cement mixer, and gets Billy Bob to jump in with him at the last minute as he rams the gate while prison-guard ammo bounces like hail from the vehicle. A high-speed chase ensues in which the fugitives evade the law, switching up cars every two-minutes of filmtime. In need of money, they hold up a bank and escape with a lot of loot.
At last, they have a moment to breathe, having successfully escaped another round of police. ""What will we do?"" asks Billy Bob. ""I have a cousin in Mexico,"" says Bruce. Like the proverbial Canadian girlfriend, we never meet this cousin, but the two bank robbers hang their hopes on going south of the border at the end of their capers to buy a nightclub and run it in style.
But first, they need more money, and so they begin a brilliant scheme of robbing banks by kidnapping the bank manager the night before the heist, sleeping in their generally nice houses, and then going to work with upper management early in the morning to empty the vaults before the bank even opens for business. The scheme works for them, and, in fact, they gain national fame as the ""sleepover bandits."" As usual, the nation falls in love with them. Since the nation does, the viewer doesn't have to. I didn't feel the compunction myself. Nothing is to keep the pair from running off after a heist or two, thus ending the crime spree and the movie. The movie, therefore, has Willis behave as a spendthrift so that they have to keep robbing more banks in order to bankroll their escape from the country. This continued crime spree necessitates, in turn, extremely sluggish law enforcement.
Director TK uses the good trick of simply not having any scenes with cops in them in order to forestall the conclusion that the police are simply not trying to catch these guys. The other thing is that a red herring, a new plot, rather, is introduced in the form of Kate Blanchet as Kate.
Kate is a wild-hearted woman married to a man who is so insensitive as to be unmistakably fictional. She runs afoul of Billy Bob when he tries to carjack her and she plows into him. Threats of violence do not dissuade her from getting involved with Bruce and Billy. With nothing left to lose in life (after all, if your marriage is passionless, what else is there possibly to live for?) Kate is not afraid and winds up in romantic involvement with the smoother side of Bruce Willis.
Willis has another friend, too. This guy drives their getaway car, but he's an amateur special effects stuntman. Which proves to be a very handy hobby later in the movie. Billy Bob is unhappy that all these other people are getting involved, and he gets antsy and whiny until a heist separates the quartet and Billy ends up with Kate, and not just as two passengers in a stolen car. Kate somehow finds Billy's sniveling highly attractive. Being a confused woman, she confuses self-pity and neurosis with sensitivity. She decides that Billy is actually a sweet guy, not a hair-trigger nut with bad luck in clothing. The script doesn't delve into her demons that cause her to fall in love with Billy, though.
Instead, it delves into what happens when the love triangle's sides all meet. Friction, that's what. But it's a happy ending whereby Kate convinces the two bandits that she can't choose between them and wants them both. Nothing graphic happens between the three. That would put this movie in the ground-breaking realm of a pic like Y Tu Mama Tambien. Instead, the relationships cool way off, but remain in a generally triangular shape.
Anyway, how can a movie spend so much time (and I mean so much time) on relationships when it has a big finale to build up to? And yet, this film manages that, and more. Bobby Sleighton does a lot of camera time as the host of a popular reality teevee show about criminals. He actually is kidnapped by the sleepover bandits and given an interview at gunpoint. This lets a lot of backstory and exposition come out in stylishly shot MTV/Blair Witch looking footage. The movie actually spends quite a bit of time on television, which is just so interesting to note how influential television is. Come to think of it, what could have helped Butch Cassidy more than if it had taken place when there was television and the two robbers could have seen their faces on a store-window television just before jumping off that cliff?
Incidentally, do I live in the wrong town or what? I have not seen televisions in a store window in about 20 years in any town in the United States. I'm travelling to Hong Kong, Bangkok, Denpensar, and Singapore later this month, and I'll keep an eye out, though.
Finally, something big and exciting happens. It's not as clever as the end of The Sting, but few things are. Instead, we get a sort of ars poetica, a statement on the art of filmmaking embedded within this film. You could look at it that way. Or it could just be the easiest path to a happy ending for these characters that at least the U.S. of the movie itself cares about.
In so many words, I guess I'm saying that I thought this movie deserves a lot of credit for trying.",1061769600,3,6075,4.564102564102564

1671068,5,B00005V4XW,"Of course, the ""hometown boy"" is Baltimore's own Barry Levinson, director of such Baltimore movies as ""Diner"" and ""Tin Men"" and though Baltimore does not play any part in this movie, this film is great.
Joe (Bruce Willis) is working on anger management. Terry (Billy Bob Thornton) carries around his own Merck Manual to self diagnose his various ailments. Kate (Cate Blanchett) is stuck with an unfeeling fish of a husband and sings Bonnie Tyler songs. This improbable trio come together to make this film terrific. There is no false note, no wasted scene, no gratutious camera mugging - it all flows together to make a wonderful trip.
Joe and Terry become the ""Sleepover Bandits"", as their modus operandi is to basically take the bank manager's family as hostage the night before the heist. By using that method, they can rob the bank without worrying about police or gung-ho security guards. Along the way, Kate hits Terry with her car and winds up taking him back to the robbers' headquarters. She decided she doesn't want to go back home and goes on the run with the bandits. Somehow along the way she falls in love with both Terry and Joe. But there's a big problem - now the bandits are seen as kidnappers and the police are looking for them. They decide to try a different approach for a robbery, one in which they stick up the bank in the more traditional manner. Since they both love the same woman _and_ they are not using their tried and true pattern, many things go wrong...

The entire movie is very entertaining.  Most people don't associate Bruce Willis with comedy yet he is very good at it.  Just look at ""The Whole Nine Yards"".  Anyway, Cate Blanchett co-stars with the two bank robbers as she toys with both of their emotions.  Something that carries on until that very special ending I've talking about.

The Terry Collins character tried to come across as a nonchalant, clever, yet paranoid sort of guy, but Thornton's acting was annoying and un-endearing. Blanchett, as 'poor me' Kate Wheeler, wants to claim a sense of pity from the audience, but never manages to pull you in and doesn't seem to be much more that a shallow-thinking ditz. This role was not worthy of her talents and was disappointing to watch. Bruce Willis was the only positive aspect of this movie.

It's actually FUNNY! Billy Bob Thornton is terrific as the Bandit with a soft spot, and a serious germ issue.
Cate Blanchett once again shows her acting talent which is showcased just as well here as in her other movies.
Even Bruce Willis, whose last comedy was the horrendous 'Whole Nine Yards' livens up here and even allows jokes at his seemingly one dimensional personality.

1671085,4,B00005V4XW,"I don't really know quite what I was expecting when I sat down to watch 'Bandits', but what I saw certainly wasn't what I had expected.  Rather than follow the straight story of two bankrobbers (Willis and Thornton) who both fall in love with the same woman hostage (Blanchett), this actually follows a much funnier farce that thankfully never takes itself seriously.  This is made abundant right from the opening scene where the anti-heroes break out of prison in a cement truck.  Quickly they establish themselves as the 'sleepover' bandits, who take the bank manager hostage the night before the robbery then get their cash before the bank's even open.  However, things get complicated when they take on Blanchett, who clearly relishes her role as glamorous hostage a great deal more than singing 'Total Eclipse Of The Heart' in her kitchen waiting for her boring husband to return.
The best choice this movie ever made was in its at times hilarious characterisation.  Willis plays the strong guy who's really a big softie at heart, Thornton is wonderfully neurotic and constantly paranoid, whereas Blanchett excels again in a ditzy role that's about as far removed from her epic performance in 'Elizabeth' as you can get and there's a great character in the getaway man, who's determined to make it big as a stuntman.  If there's never really anything new here then you soon forget the movie's shortcomings for its sheer enjoyment factor.

One could see how both male characters would fall in love with her. The movie had that ""ODD COUPLE"" sense to it, with Willis playing the hot-headed slob, and Billy Bob playing the neat-freak intellectual hypochondriac. Thornton found the sweetness within the fussiness, and Willis had less of a stretch for his role of macho-felon. Willis took the back seat to both of his co-stars; something he seems to be very generous about. He gives one the impression that he would be fun to work with.

Joe & Terry break out of prison and become the successful ""Sleepover Bandits"" (loosely based on a real-life situation) who take down a number of banks in sunny California with style, grace, and little to no bloodshed.  Charming criminals!  Rich woman Kate (Cate Blanchett), a bored, somewhat wacky & wealthy woman gets involved in one of their escapes, and joins them in their chosen career.
While Bruce successfully plays Bruce, Billy Bob is outrageous and outstanding as a neurotic hypochondriac...and is true to the role in mannerisms, dress and speech. He's hilarious and memorable. Both Terry & Joe, of course, create conflict by falling for Kate, and she switches personalities easily to fit what each of them wants. I'm a Cate Blanchett fan, but she's a little too regal for this role...the filmmakers needed someone ditzy that you would not expect either guy to fall for...a Renee Zellwegger type.
You've gotta love odd comedy (kind of like the movie ""Tremors"") to really appreciate the film, but, if you do, you will find it very entertaining -- the DVD has great extras, especially the edited scenes and a hilarious alternate ending.

The characters reach out and engage the viewers, making us genuinely care for them and their neuroses. While not a cerebral film per se, neither is it complete fluff comedy; the interpersonal relationships are multi-layered, the dialogue is witty and often subtle, and there are many things to be picked up in subsequent viewings.

Needing money to make their getaway complete, they return to doing that which they know best, bank robbing, while dreaming of getting enough money to open a nightclub in Mexico. Along the way, they pick up Harvey (Troy Garrity), a would be stuntman and Joe's relative, as their getway driver. Together, they rob banks without physically harming their victims and have devised a creative way of going about the bank robberies that causes them to be dubbed the ""Sleepover Bandits"" by the media.
During their successful crime spree, they separate at one point. One of them ends up comandeering the car that Kate (Cate Blanchett), a bored and neglected housewife, is in, driving off with her to their rendevous point. Kate takes to this like a duck takes to water. Before you know it, she is hot and heavy with Joe. Then she is left for a time with Terry, and, before you know it, she is hot and heavy with Terry. An unusual love triangle is born. Kate also joins them in their quest for cash, as a willing participant. Just when it seems that the end is near, however, and all is lost, a twist in the turn the film takes, will take the viewer by surprise.
Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton are excellent in their respective roles. Willis is the epitome of cool under fire and totally laidback, while Thornton is wired up and almost in Rainman mode. Cate Blanchett does her best with her role, giving it her all. While her American accent is good, however, she seems a bit like a fish out of water. She is simply not ditzy enough for the role, as too much of her innate intelligence shines through. This is not her fault. She is simply miscast in the role. Patricia Arquette or someone like her without Ms. Blanchett's sharp edges would have been a much better choice. The film, while funny and entertaining, flags a bit in the final analysis, failing to be all that it could be.

This is a film which is pure 80s, there is no action, and little of anything, in fact imagine rain man all over again.

Finding out that this is based on a true story, that there really were sleep-over bandits, that someone really did rob a bank with a magic marker, and hearing how director Levinson let these very talented actors loose to improvise and keep the best moments intrigued me.  Troy Garity who plays Harvey, the wheel man stunt man who steals the scenes with his charming stupidity, is Jane Fonda's son.  So if you watch the film and enjoy it, be sure to check out the bonus materials on the DVD version.  To see the alternate ending with Cate Blanchette pregnant is a hoot.

These three have previously demonstrated a remarkable range of acting talent and they all feed off each other throughout the production.

However, the film becomes tedious as we are continually forced to hear about Cate's love for Billy Bob and Bruce, and also about Thornton's hypochondriacal complaints.

Instead of real characters, it gives us itemized lists of neuroses and life issues that never gel into real characters.  The humor in the movie, such as at is, derives entirely from these unbelievable quirks.
Too bad. Barry Levinson was at one time one of the great creators of unique and memorable characters, such as in Diner, Tin Men, Avalon and Rain Man.

1671125,3,B00005V4XW,"""Bandits"" opens with the promise of a terrific, ""Butch Cassidy""-esque odd-couple adventure, and ends with a poor excuse for a conclusion. Sure, it's clever, and so is much of the film. But it seems that director Barry Levinson is so focused on wit that he forgets to check for loopholes and lulls in the story.
""Bandits"" concerns escaped convicts Joe and Terry (Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton, respectively). They wish to open a new nightclub in Mexico which they will call ""paradise"". Their plans are extravagant, and they propose to pay for it by robbing banks. They find a creative way to do it: stay over at the bank manager's house the night before, take care of business in the morning. In comes Kate (Cate Blanchett), a woman depressed with her boring life and looking for adventure. Eventually, she becomes part of the team.
Above I mentioned loopholes. Yes, unfortunately they are abound in ""Bandits"". The story just keeps trotting along, leaving the viewer in the dark. For example, Terry supposedly has several medical conditions. we're led to believe it's a brain tumor, and then we're told it's not. So what is it? ""Bandits"" neglects to tell us this, just using Terry's anonymous medical problems as ways to get itself out of a tight spot. There is another subplot concerning a sort of angel woman in pink boots. Whatever her metaphoric symbolism is supposed to be defeats me, but she is used whenever it is dramatically convenient (note to Barry Levinson: this is called manipulation...)
Although it wasn't stellar, I was pleased with the acting in ""Bandits"". Bruce Willis is one of those ""genre"" actors that burst out of their normal type of roles (he went from action movies like ""Die Hard"" to dramas like ""The Sixth Sense""). He does a good job in this film, mixing ex-con toughness with a touch of charm. His chemistry with Billy Bob Thornton is entertaining, yet there is an uncomfortable distance between the two that creeps up on them during some scenes. Cate Blanchett is also interesting as the over-the top Kate; caught in the middle of a love triangle (which, by the way, never works).
Is ""Bandits"" too clever for it's own good? No, I don't think so. But too much attention is given to cleverness. The script is solid, but it seems like that was the only thing that any work was done on. During any ""action"" scenes, the camerawork seemed like it was done on a five year old camcorder. It also seems that the actors weren't given any tips by the director; each actor gives his/her own raw interpretation of their role without much direction. ""Bandits"" doesn't seem like a finished product; instead it seems like a dress rehearsal for something much bigger.",1022889600,2,2684,4.774193548387097

Parts of this movie seem to drag (yes, there are some funny parts, and Cate (Kate), Bruce (Joe), and Billy Bob (Terry) seem to work very well together, but there's a lot of repetition and not a lot of action until the second half of the movie) and I was bored, but I felt rewarded for sticking with it when the movie was over.",1022544000,,644,4.119047619047619

1671128,4,B00005V4XW,"""Bandits"" is one of those quirky comedies that require a bizarre sense of humor to enjoy.  The script is clever with an incongruous love triangle between escaped convicts and bank robbers Terry (Billy Bob Thornton) and Joe (Bruce Willis), and their captive turned accomplice Kate (Cate Blancett).
This is not a film to be taken seriously and the bank robberies are more slapstick than dramatic.  Terry and Joe kidnap bank managers the night before, have a nice dinner with the family and then go to work with them the next morning to rob their bank, earning them the nickname ""Sleepover Bandits"".  Before long, they are so famous that the bank managers treat them like honored guests.
Director Barry Levinson's (Good Morning Vietnam, Rain Man, Wag the Dog, Sphere) forte is presenting human stories, though he doesn't have much of this type of zany comedy on his resume.  He is excellent at character development and presenting the finer points of relationships and that is evident here, though the characters are all wacky.  Many of the bits are funny in a peculiar way, but a good number are just goofy and miss the mark.
The best comedy comes from Billy Bob Thornton, who makes Terry into a hyper neurotic, paranoid hypochondriac.  Just about everything that comes out of his mouth is comical, and he delivers it with such an ironic sense of seriousness that it doubles the effect.  Anyone who has ever had a friend who was into self help books will find Thronton's performance to be a scream.  Willis again plays the macho straight man with his usual ease.  This is a character that he can play sleepwalking; he has played him so many times.  Willis seems far more tongue-in-cheek than Thronton, and it is hard to tell whether he is incredulous as the character or of the character.
Cate Blanchett rounds out the cast with another loony character, a lonely housewife looking for excitement and fulfillment.  Blanchett has such outstanding range that almost any project she attempts produces terrific results.  To make Kate believable, she has to conjure a character that can be attracted to two men who are utter opposites, yet somehow she pulls it off.
This is a strange story full of peculiar people and it is great fun if you aren't hoping for anything approaching reality.  I rated it 7/10.  It is good light fare for viewers with a twisted sense of humor.",1021593600,5,2364,4.79064039408867
1671129,1,B00005V4XW,"I guess I just don't get it, but this is definately the worst movie I've seen in a theater since... well, I can't even think of the last time I saw something this bad in a theater.  I laughed exactly once, and spent the rest of my time contemplating walking out.  After seeing it all the way through, I wish I had walked out.
First off, Thorton's character was not funny.  He's a good actor, and he did the best he could with such a dull script, but he simply does not work as the ""comic relief"".  From the moment his character was introduced as the goofy guy (to Bruce Willis's quiet, serious guy), I knew I was in for painful gags.  I just didn't know quite how painful they would be.  The jokes are forced at their best, and nauseating at their worst.  The running gag about him being a hypochondriac just makes it that much more infuriating.  I have to say that the one time I did laugh, I laughed out loud.  So if the movie had been 5 minutes long, I probably would have enjoyed it.  Unfortunately it was (I believe) a bit over two hours, and I was bored senseless.  The pace is excruciatingly slow, and I simply did not have the patience.
As far as the characters themselves, I just couldn't bring myself to believe them.  Three fine performers trying to do their best with three impossibly unconvincing characters.  I don't mind non-believable characters in a satire (be it self-satire or a satire of something else) but this one tries to be more than just a comedy.  It's a crime-drama and a romance as well.  And it takes these elements seriously, which was a huge mistake.  If you are easily irritated by formulaic, obvious comedy, consider yourself warned.

1671142,4,B00005V4XW,"Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton do an excellent job in their roles as criminals. Its the quirkiness and the ability to give their characters a new dimension that made the movie great in my opinion.
The plot is a typical one where bank robbers plan for the big heist coupled with an incidental love story. However, this love story happens to be quite fun because both men fall in love with one of the girls they kidnapped. She is a desperate woman looking for some type of adventure to get out of the home as a typical housewife. She ends up loving both of the men as each love her but are jealous. So, the love story serves a strong purpose and is possibly the best part of the movie.
I can't say enough about Billy Bob Thornton. His ability to make a quirky character believable is amazing. Bruce Willis is cast in a role he is best suited for, the down on his luck flashy character. It works!

I love Mr. Thornton and his acting chops but like what other reviewers had stated, his character's neurosis makes me want to slap him as the movie progressed.  Ms Blanchette is as usual a very reliable actor but her character seems so unbelievable in real life.  Who could feel for an emotionally unstable and needy woman, no matter how boring her marriage is?  I mean to ditch her hubby and sleep with two guys simultaneously?! When the audience can't relate or root for the characters, it's hard to get into a movie.
You may say ""but this is a comedy, not a drama based on real life story"".  True.  However, when characters are so far away from reality and so one-dimensional, only the jokes remain interesting.  And the jokes in this movie are so far apart and a few.
I think the problem with this movie is that the filmmaker can't decide what kind of movie this should be.  Take, for example, Charlie's Angels, it's a total fantasy but it's the intention of the filmmaker to make it consistently a fantasy.  Bandits wants to be many things at the same time that it lost its hold on the audience's attention.

1671183,4,B00005V4XW,"""Bandits"" is hard to classify and is a bit more unusual than it at first appears to be. As a comedy, it isn't all that funny. As a drama, it isn't that engaging. As a romance, it dances too much around its menage a trois theme. And as a crime caper, it isn't especially original or exciting. Yet, oddly, as stirred together by director Barry Levinson, these elements, weak as they are individually, work together to make a very entertaining movie. Of course, it doesn't hurt that it stars three enormously talented actors who would be fun to watch just doing their grocery shopping.
Joe and Terry [Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton] are doing time in prison. One day the impulsive Joe commandeers a cement truck and smashes out of prison, taking the nervous, neurotic Terry, who's also a total hypochondriac, with him. They have no choice other than to revert to their old profession, bank robbing. These are no ordinary thieves, however, because they go out of their way not to harm anyone. Soon they are dubbed The Sleepover Bandits and are all over national TV. They also manage to accidentally pick up a hostage, a bored, frustrated housewife named Kate [Cate Blanchett], who turns out to be crazier than Joe and Terry combined. To make matters even more complicated, she falls for both of them, and they respond, much to the detriment of their friendship.
Each actor works his magic. Thornton shows a heretofore unseen comic ability. Blanchett continues to carve out memorable characters. Here she reveals a spirited wild side that I look forward to seeing again. As for Willis, I continue to believe he is our most underrated star. Though this role is no stretch for him, he still gives Joe characteristics that make him unique.
One personal reservation: It occurred to me while watching `Bandits' that a reason the comedy elements may not work as well as expected is because there are is a lot of gunplay in the movie. To me, guns are inherently menacing. It doesn't matter that the characters waving them are unlikely to use them. I have a hard time thinking of someone as being witty and adorable when he or she is pointing a loaded gun in someone else's face.  I'm not sure how to respond, and that represses my laughter mechanism. I'm not sure if this reaction is peculiar to me or not.",1017964800,,2299,4.676543209876543

The decision to watch this movie wasn't one I made, but I've been raving about it to anyone who will listen ever since.
Billy Bob Thornton is hilarious as the hypochondriac who is a rather reluctant prison escapee and even a more reluctant bank robber.  As good as the scenes with Thornton and Willis are, the screen really lights up with the appearance of Cate Blanchett as the unhappy housewife who accidentally gets involved with our two bumbling robbers.
I laughed myself silly while watching this movie!  I enjoyed it so much I had to watch it again the next day and enjoyed it even more.  The only complaint I had was that the interview sections with Willis as Joe and Thornton as Terry seemed to interfere a bit with the story.  That said, on the second viewing, the interview portions made perfect sense.

They play bank robbers who never usual violence in their activities thus the public love them. I won't spoil the plot twist but for movie fans you should see what is coming. The movie was promoted as action comedy but it doesn't have enough funny moments nor actions.

The cast is wonderful and the director is respectable(good morning vietnam, Avalon).  Billy Bob in particluar is coming off of his incredible performance from ""the man who wasn't there"" and he is mildly entertaining in this one.
The problem with the movie comes in many forms.  It's hard to watch a woman leave her home and use both these men throughout the film while they dimwittingly put up with it.  I don't intend to put out any spoilers, but the fights between our non-heroic leads are laughable and silly.  They start out crashing through a window in a fight in one scene, only to in 2 minutes become friends again, like old times.  The movie also trys to convince us that adultery is okay, as long as the husband is the way he is in this movie.  The second problem with this movie is it's incredible amount of induced boredom.  About halfway through the film, my filmgoing partner and I just sat there begging for this movie to end in any form possible.
Despite my rantings, there are indeed a couple of funny moments- like bruce willis pony tail.  The ending is clever but it's also a bit of a stretch.  There are some great shots, such as when Cate Blanchett's character opens the fridge and you are exposed to a great blue color that surrounds the picture.  The idea of the movie is great as well:  celebrity bandits having fun and being fun.  Unfortunately, this movie is anything but fun and enjoyable, and I highly reccommend you rent another film by Barry Levinson, or Billy Bob, or Cate, or Bru...well, maybe you should be more selective with Mr. Willis...",1017360000,6,1716,4.583606557377049

The acting in this movie is pretty good, as always, but the characters are totally unlikable : one is an annoying hypochondriac, the other is one of those strong and silent types. The script was just BAD, BAD, BAD !!
I can't understand why this movie is promoted as a comedy. There were 2 scenes in the whole movie that made me smile. No one as laughing during the entire movie. I think it would have been better it they would have advertised it as a romantic crime-drama.",1016582400,8,724,4.451127819548872
1671189,5,B00005V4XW,"I saw this movie in theaters three times, and I laughed out loud every time. Told in flashback, Bandits showcases Billy Bob Thornton (Terry) and Bruce Willis (Joe) as a bumbling Bonnie and Clyde, robbing banks and gaining notoriety along the way as the ""Sleepover Bandits"" (for their technique of ""kidnapping"" bank managers and their families the night before a robbery). With Terry's neuroses and Joe's gusto, the two form an unbreakable bond as the brains and braun behind this humorous train of robberies. Along the way, they are subjected to Joe's simple-minded cousin, Harvey, and their kidnapped love interest, Cate Blanchett (Kate). The foursome keeps the film believable, as the robberies themselves become less and less likely to succeed due to Joe and Terry's rising fame. In the end, Harvey's stupidity never costs them the bundle, Kate's hysteria works in their favor, and the two friends come out of it as close as they were when they stole a cement truck to escape prison in the film's opening sequence. The characters are all exaggerations of personality quirks, but the genuine bond between them creates a net of believability. From the love triangle that emerges between Joe, Terry, and Kate, to Harvey's obsession with a girl in ""pink boots,"" Bandits truly holds up as a unique comedy on many levels. The plot is creative enough to hold any viewers attention long enough to fall in love with one (or all) of these characters, and the dialogue is witty enough to keep even repeat viewers chuckling. Check out Bandits, and see one of the funniest movies to come out in recent months.",1016496000,5,1599,4.904059040590406
1671200,4,B00005V4XW,"Bandits comes across to me as a film that is so close to being great, that where it fails, it pulls the rest of the movie down with it.  All the potential coupled with everything that succeeds indicates the greatness of this film, but because of all of this, the flaws--however minute or inconsequential--stand out more abundantly.  And so inevitably, the most generous praise I can bestow upon it is that this film is above average in every respect, and yet just shy of where a more honed production would have rendered it.
The script, first off, is clever and subtly humorous where necessary.  The direction is apt, expertly combining the modern tendency for rampant cuts and high-octane fury with the more traditional, emotional aspects inherent in the story.  The characters themselves, however, can be both a blessing and a curse.  While Willis' and Thornton's characters are intended to be opposites, there is not equal attention given to develop them.  Willis--despite perhaps a small intention to keep his character distanced from the audience--is never allowed to explore the character to his internal depths.  Thornton, on the other hand, is an elaborate--if verging on too eccentric--gentleman who the audience quickly comes to relate to and enjoy.  And so, when Cate Blanchett's character enters the film--and with the greatest performance of the cast--one finds it hard to comprehend her torment as she feebly tries to overcome her emotions towards both gentlemen.  The concept of the love triangle itself is well thought out and interesting, however its implementation left a little to be desired.
The film that ensues in the end, though, is a complex story that necessitates well-developed and intimate characters, but the film--and also, the male leads--fail to stir up the audience's compassion as required by the subject matter.  A better production could have turned this film into an entertaining exploit into the criminal mind, not to mention the ennui of the traditional housewife, but instead it exposes mundane characters in a promising setting.  Little work would have been done to turn this film into a bona-fide gem.  Fortunately for us, though, there is evidence of this potential in the nonetheless entertaining film that we were given.  Despite its faults and shortcomings, Bandits does not seem like a waste of two hours.  It is fun, it is humorous, it is entertaining.  But, alas, it is also not developed as extensively as it could have been.",1014595200,,2475,5.091584158415841

1671206,2,B00005V4XW,"The movie depends on the three players' acting ability to produce chemistry.  That succeeds, but not completely.  One problem is director Barry Levinson's habit of making a film overlong, as his previous works like ""Sleepers"" would testify.  It takes 40 minutes for Cate Blanchett's character to appear and spark on screen -- dancing in kitchen (don't miss this hilarious scene).  Probalbly, even those who love the film would agree that she shows up too late.  And though Bruce Willis shows his unexpectedly off-beat and tender side; and Billy Bob is amusing as a nervous guy (especially when we imagine some part of his characterization might have come from his own), it is, after all, ""a good-lookin' guy and an itchy guy.""  It is too simplistic to sustain the whole movie, which runs almost two  hours.  It is very regrettable since Willis's character certainly has more potentially dangerous side (see how he snatches a shotgun from a boy, wanna-be hero), which could have been used more effectively with a deft director's skill.  Considering these flat characterization, it is understandable that for all some of the amusing dialogues -- like, ""Kate is an iceberg waiting for the Titanic"" -- some viewers complain that Billy Bob's character is a little irritating.
However, to me, whether you like ""Bandits"" or not wholly depends on the idea of 'gentleman outlaw in modern times.'  If you can't buy the idea of two bank robbers sleeping over at prospective target's house, our interest in film soon dies.  Outlaws such as Black Bart, Butch & Sundance, or Plunkett & Macleane all lived in the past.  I wish crinimals could be so gentle and charmimg when I have to meet one.  But I just can't believe it, having seen too much of Tarantino.  Sorry.",1010793600,,1751,4.8915254237288135

1671208,2,B00005V4XW,"There's very little to laugh about in Barry Levinson's ""Bandits,"" which wants to be comedy, caper, and romance all at the same time. Employing the talents of a superb cast and gaining the anticipation of audiences with a humorous theatrical trailer, the film is a striking disappointment, wasting the talent of those involved, while the trailer spoils the film's miniscule funny moments.
Beginning, appropriately enough, with a bank robbery, the film then segues into the past, where a TV news reporter is being held hostage and forced to do an interview with Joe Blake and Terry Collins (Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton), known as the Sleepover Bandits. From there, the remembrance of events goes even further, to the day that Joe and Terry escaped prison in a cement truck and began a robbing spree devoid of violence... who needs violence when you have comedy, right?
Wrong. The film possesses a small amount of comedic charm, which only begins to pick up once they are joined by repressed housewife Kate Wheeler (Cate Blanchett), whose husband seems more intent on having her as a dutiful wife than as a lover. She immediately takes a liking to Joe, but complications soon cross their path. Dissention soon sets in, and the movie seems intent to draw out moments that should have some emotional meaning, but are surprisingly flat.
The cast for ""Bandits"" is first rate, no doubt, but that may be one of the things wrong with it. Both Willis and Thornton give credible performances, even though Thornton's character is constantly irritating and becomes a pest, and Willis's subtle humor goes by without so much as a chuckle. Blanchett, as always, shines beyond measure, playing the housewife-gone-bandit to perfection. It is my belief that the film relies heavily on their talents, so much in fact that it loses focus from other key elements of the film.
That's not to say that ""Bandits"" doesn't possess a good story; the plot behind the cast borderlines on entertaining us, but never seems to take off as it should, as it trips over its own style of recollection storytelling. Perhaps this premise may have had more effect on me had there been any reason to develop an interest in it, but with the absence of humor on any level, and increasing twists that serve to add to an already lengthy running time, there's nothing of interest throughout much of the film.
A surprise ending, predictable yet enjoyable, cannot save ""Bandits"" from suffering under its own weight. Those of you who have seen the trailer would do better to enter the movie five minutes before it ends; for those of you who haven't, take this as fair warning. One almost wishes that the performances of Willis, Thornton and Blanchett could be extracted and grafted into another, more pleasing experience. But so it goes.",1005868800,2,2794,4.88421052631579
1671229,4,B00005V4XW,"This was a really good movie.  The comedy between Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton for at least the first hour and a half really kept the movie going.  Subtle little jokes like when Billy Bob's character looking like Neil Young from an earlier 70's album was really funny to me, although it may have been lost on a younger audience.  What I thought the movie could have been lacking, which would have made it better, would have been more movie time about the victims who the robbers left behind.  The two kids at the beginning should have had a bigger part in maybe trying to cash in on their own fame, which was nothing more than having accidently asscociated with the ""sleep over bandits.""  But, how the hell did they keep going to all of those hotel when their faces were all over the news?  Oh well, it was a really funny movie, and it was a new twist on the same old bank robber theme, I would highly recommend this movie.",1005868800,,930,4.3468208092485545

Their clothing selections alone will have you on the floor doubled over in laughs.  They are bandits on the lam working their way down the west coast of the USA to get to Mexico while continuing to rob banks en route.  Everything is going well until they run into the hyper neurotic Cate Blanchett who becomes their mututal love interest.  The movie loses a little bit of its steam with this subplot as Thornton and Willis were riffing off one another beautifully without tossing in another major character.  I was reminded of the also unlikely comic duo of Robert DeNiro and Billy Crystal in ""Analyze This."" In that hilarious movie the romance element was kept as a very minor aspect of the story and did not interfere with the magic going on between Crystal and DeNiro. I think Barry Levinson would have had another 5 star movie on his hands if he'd done the same.  As it is, he's made a very enjoyable night's viewing 4 star movie.",1004918400,2,1088,4.577319587628866
1671231,4,B00005V4XW,"I write this having read no one else's review here. I am always delighted to see which major ideas they have arrived at that I'd missed and, sometimes, vice-versa.
I liked this movie. I enjoyed it thoroughly. And I wondered why, in the beginning, we are told ""how it ends."" See the movie and see the skill in writing and plotting a story, and in the structure of sequences.
It's a delight, a diversion. No more, no less, and ""what's so bad about that?"" The delights include the story ideas and some delicious witty dialogue. As well as sensitivity to the human condition, especially in a love triangle, provided by ????? Peyton's script. In fact, the writer tricks--well, no spoilers here.
I am sure the key actors -- Willis, Thornton, Blanchett -- had fun making the movie, as did the usually dead-serious director, Barry Levinson.
Willis gives us his best humor since his TV work on ""Moonlighting."" Thornton surely has an Oscar-nominated performance.
These two actors are no better than Robert Redford and Jim Gandolfini who were in THE LAST CASTLE, and whose understated performances I felt were reduced by rotten direction. Here three fine actors and one terrific director show us the difference a good director, or a more-aptly chosen director, can make.
Finally, about 3/4 of the way through, those of you interested in fine still photography or cinematography or just in looking at beautful women, watch for the utterly stunning shot of Ms. Blanchett, back-lit against a dark ground, her red-orange hair with yellow interior blowing against the light, glowing like astronomers' photos of the sun's eruptions.

Bruce willis was on top of his game, Cate Blanchette was a surprise as a comic actress, and Billy Bob Thornton was amazing in his role as the hypochondriac brains of the operation. The movie was paced just fast enough, punctuated with romantic breaks and incredible seconds of silent hilarity.

1671234,5,B00005V4XW,"They don't want to hurt anybody, they just want the money; and so it goes as a pair of non-lethal outlaws cut a swath down the West Coast and provide escapism at it's best for the audience in ""Bandits,"" a funny and entertaining film directed by Barry Levinson, starring Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton and Cate Blanchett.  After a spontaneous escape from the Oregon State Penitentiary, Joe and Terry (Willis and Thornton) need cash, so they make like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde-- make that ""Clyde"" and Clyde-- and proceed to do what they do best:  rob banks.  They have a long-range goal in mind, but not much in the way of day-to-day planning, so they just kind of wing it as they go.  And though they want the money, they really don't want to inflict any serious bodily harm on anyone, so they come up with a way to circumvent any untoward opposition; to wit, they simply go to the bank manager's house, spend the night with him and get on with the robbing first thing in the morning.  Soon dubbed the ""Sleep Over Bandits,"" they are well on their way to effecting their goal when they run into the proverbial unforeseeable element, and her name is Kate (Blanchett), a woman in a state of flux who becomes their hostage-- or is it the other way around?  It's the question that Joe and Terry are going to have to answer if they want to get on with things; but as always happens-- especially in the movies-- when a woman becomes involved, it's just not that easy to figure out.  In fact, as Joe and Terry discover, it's down right complicated.  And it's just the hook the audience needs to really get involved, and for everyone concerned it becomes a wild and hectic ride into that cinematic sunset.
 As he's proved in numerous films before, Levinson certainly knows how to tell a story, and he has a great cast of actors with which to do it in this one.  Most importantly, he knows what works, how to present the material most effectively and how to get the best out of his stars.  And he keeps it all moving without a hitch; the two hours you spend with this bunch veritably flies by and leaves you wanting more, which in itself says a lot about the entertainment value of this film.  Make no mistake, this is definitely a romanticized take on some ""bad"" guys, but suspend disbelief at the door and go with the flow; these are characters you're going to like-- even care about-- and they're going to give you an exciting time out from the rest of your life.  Not a bad deal, especially when it's done this well.
 In Joe, Willis creates a character that can only be described as a ""good"" bad guy, more like Robin Hood than Dillinger.  He brings a tough, determined edge to the role, giving Joe a kind of focus and discipline that defines him, and he comes across as menacing without the menace.  Willis conveys the fact that Joe may not know everything, but he knows what he wants and is going to do all he can to get it.  It makes for a convincing portrayal of an average guy who has fallen into extraordinary circumstances, to which he reacts in a very real and credible manner.  Joe is believable, which makes the film easy to embrace and enhances the fun.  A good job by Willis, and though Joe is essentially a variation of Jimmy ""The Tulip"" Tudeski, the character Willis played in ""The Whole Nine Yards,"" this guy is all Joe, and that's what counts here.
 As Terry, Billy Bob Thornton continues to demonstrate his versatility as an actor; can this possibly be the same guy who played the disturbed Karl in ""Sling Blade,"" or the nerdy and wanting Jacob in ""A Simple Plan?""  The answer, of course, is yes, and it underscores what a talented character actor Thornton truly is.  As the phobia-prone, hypochondriac Terry, he infuses a dry, subtle humor into the film that works incredibly well opposite Willis, and it makes the characters different sides of the same coin.  It's a complex character that Thornton delivers with facility and care, and he succeeds in making Terry likable and memorable.
 The real highlight of the film, however, is-- hands down-- Cate Blanchett, who plays the repressed, lonely and frustrated housewife, Kate, with a vitality that brings her brilliantly to life.  Blanchett lets her hair down and immerses herself in the role, and her very presence on the screen is absolutely vivacious.  The first time she appears on screen is a shot looking out at her from inside a refrigerator she is opening; a pale, blue light falls across the close-up of her face, and though is passes quickly it's one of those ""moments"" that instantly become indelibly etched in your mind's eye forever.  Because in that split second you realize that something special has just transpired-- that the movie has just been catapulted to the top rung of the ladder.  And because of Blanchett, Kate just as quickly becomes the central character in the film, and it's simply a terrific performance by one of the most gifted actors in the business.
 The supporting cast includes Troy Garity, January Jones, Rocky LaRochelle, Jaye K. Danford, Anthony Burch and Bobby Slayton.  An engaging and thoroughly enjoyable film, ""Bandits"" is like a ""best of all genres"" movie, because it's a mixture of action, drama, comedy and suspense all rolled into one-- and it's done perfectly.  Levinson presents it in such a way that it draws you in from the beginning, and the performances are all as good as it gets-- the stars simply shine in this one.  It's the kind of movie you can watch time and again and never tire of seeing.  It has it all, including a great ending.  And that's the magic of the movies.",1004486400,5,5599,4.582748244734202

1671238,4,B00005V4XW,"This movie was worth it just to see Bruce Willis portray his charcter so convincingly.  In fact, he seems so connected to it that it's almost as if he is not acting.  The same is true to a lesser degree with Billy Bob Thornton, whose hypochondria is amusing at first, but becomes a bit tiresome. Cate Blanchett, on the other hand, is very impressive in the way she develops her character from an unhappy and repressed housewife into a true outlaw..... there were quite a few times when she reminded me of Anjelica Huston, both of them being extremely gifted actresses who are not afraid of looking foolish or even unglamorous.
The plot is not all that original, but there are enough new angles to make it entertaining.  There's a lot of humor, both in the dialogue and physical humor.  My only complaint was that the action slowed down unnecessarily about three-fourths through, but the ending redeemed this problem.  I've noticed this tendency in other recent films.  They start out with a good hook, grab the viewer and maintain a hectic pace, then it's almost as if the director feels compelled to insert a low-key hiatus before an action-packed finale.  Or maybe they have a hard time editing it that far into the film, knowing that the audience won't get up and walk out at that point anyway.
Still, these are minor complaints. This is a very good movie with some excellent acting, and sure to entertain all but the most hypercritical viewer.",1003363200,4,1447,4.695652173913044

Bruce Willis is a very good actor who is usually reliable, Oscar nominees' Billy Bob Thornton and Cate Blanchett usually deliver and Barry Levinson is a wonderful Oscar winning director who we can usually count on for a good film. That is why Bandits, a mundane attempt at an action comedy, is so dissapointing. It starts out strong enough, with the two main characters escaping from prison in an unconventional way. The first thirty to forty minutes makes for a very good and entertaining film. Then, the film shifts gears from buddy heist comedy to love triangle comedy, and most films that use love triangles generally are not that good. Cate Blanchett is a good actress, but she is not funny and comes off as annoying as the woman torn between Willis and Thornton. You don't understand why she would want either one of the idiots. Willis is just okay in this film, although he doesn't have much to do but to wear a pathetic wig that makes him look like he stepped out of a bad eighties movie. Thornton is surprisingly funny as a hypochondriac who is also the brains of the operation. He keeps the film from sinking too much. The film, as directed by Levinson, seems disjointed, sometimes it seems extremely bland, and too cheesy(there is no other word to describe it). The ending is pathetic and has been done before, as has most of the other scenes in the movie. If you're looking for a good bank robber movie, go rent Steven Soderberg's Out Of Sight starring George Clooney, or wait for the casino heist comedy from Soderberg/Clooney called Ocean's 11.",1003017600,,1658,4.681506849315069
1671274,3,B00005V4XW,"Sadly, it only goes to show that your movie is only as good as your script, and such is the case in Barry Levinson's latest schwing 'BANDITS'.
First off, everyone, including the director has been and done better than this. Willis has been better in numerous films (""Sixth Sense"", ""Die Hard"", etc.), Billy Bob Thorton is funnier when he's not trying to be funny in ""Slingblade"", and Blanchett is absolutely royal in ""Elizabeth. Levinson, for the record, has also done better (""Bugsy"", ""Toys""). 'BANDITS' is a sad use of such talent. Thank you Harley Peyton (for nothing), for your lousy script...
The plot plods about, one buggerlery after another. A careless lull in the action followed by a humorous retort by Thorton, probably 'Bandits' only saving grace. Inevitable as it sounds, destiny catches up to Terry and Joe. Then of course, there's a semi-enjoyable ending, but I won't divulge that in case you want to see it.
Appealing in its humor to a general audience (and NO ONE is KILLED in the movie, AMAZING!), 'Bandits' seems like an great concept mistreated by a wreckless feat of writing. Definitely no ""Bunnie and Clyde"" or ""The Sting"", 'Bandits' is a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't see it"" movie. I forsee it damned to the dusty video rental shelf very soon.",1002931200,,1274,4.769230769230769
1671275,5,B00005V4XW,"Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton have both acted their guts out in this movie. It was hilarious from start to finish, with a brilliant, non-cheezy ending to match. When you start off this movie you think you know how it ends, but you don't! Anyway, that aside, the acting by all of the characters, Cate Blanchett included was brilliant, and the story line was intelligent funny, and kept you hooked all the way thru. Plus, I think I'm in love with Cate Blanchett after this movie. She was just brilliant too. The funniest robber movie I've seen in a long time.",1002931200,,563,4.529411764705882
1671276,3,B00005V4XW,"Bandits has an all-star cast of great actors. So, naturally I thought it would be a great movie, but I was wrong. Bandits was, in a way, very true to it's name, because at some parts it felt like it stole my money. It had it's moments, but most of them were silly. Cate Blanchett was one of only good parts of the movie. Billy Bob Thorton was also funny, but his character kind of got silly, and redundant. Bruce Willis was also funny, but he acted the same way he did in The Whole Nine Yards. The script at times was funny, but it was too long. I found myself looking at my watch a lot. I also felt like I was in a music video with the frequent music montages. Without most of them, the time could have been cut down. But there were some surprises and some funny moments. If you are bored see this movie, it might make you laugh, but it make you even more bored...",1002931200,,865,4.064327485380117
1671277,5,B00005V4XW,This movie is hilarious and simply all-around great to watch. It's a joy. Billy Bob Thorton is brilliant and I think deserves an OSCAR for his performance.
