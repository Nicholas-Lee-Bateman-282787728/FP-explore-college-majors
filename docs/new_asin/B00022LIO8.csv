2056868,5,B00022LIO8,"Watching Ken Burns' ""The Dust Bowl,"" I learned of this film, and watched it via Netflix. King Vidor was one of Hollywood's greatest, and he brought his incredible skill set to ""Our Daily Bread,"" a perfect depiction not only of Hollywood's ""classic"" era, but also of cultural sensibilities during the 30's.

It is one of the few films I've seen that have elicted from me tears, outright laughter, and spontaneous applause at the end, even though I was watching it alone! I immediately bought DVDs for family members.",1359331200,5,515,4.8522727272727275
2056869,5,B00022LIO8,"Let me net it out for you. Would you invest $7.98 and 12 minutes to enrich the team building culture in your organization? Of course you would.

So here's the plan.  Order the 1934 DVD, King Vidor's Our Daily Bread.  Give your staff team (or department team) the movie synopsis--but just show them the last 12 minutes.  In my opinion, it's the best video clip on team building ever produced.

Named one of the 10 best films of 1934 by the New York Times, King Vidor's Our Daily Bread depicts the deep depression-era cultural discouragement of the time, but lands on an upbeat solution.  No need to waste your time on the entire 73-minute film--often termed as a propaganda piece for the idea of a socialistic community. (Any inferences to today's economic recession are purely coincidental. Note that I'm not recommending the film's message, but you can use this closing scene as a powerful team building tool.)

Buyer beware! The black and white DVD is very, very poor quality--but (my opinion) that adds to the gritty framing of a robust dialogue on team building.  I'll screen this 12-minute memorable clip at a board retreat in two weeks.  I use it in my Management Buckets workshops and other team building days with clients. It never, never, never fails to evoke a spirited and uplifting discussion about the nature and wonders of a well-functioning team.

I call the clip ""The Cadence of Team Building,"" because the background rhythms of shovels, picks, axes and sweat rise to a symphonic explosion of unbridled exhilaration and celebration. (You'll understand my over-the-top rhetoric when you view it. It's amazing.)

Suggestion: preview it first, of course, and then ask two or three others to prepare discussion questions for use after your team views the clip.",1282521600,,1772,4.912751677852349
2056870,3,B00022LIO8,"After reading the reviews of the Alpha print, I purchased the Synergy one.  It is a little washed out, though not nearly as bad as the Alpha one sounds.  The vhs copy I made from TCM is somewhat better.  Also, there are no menus.  The movie starts with the FBI warning, and proceeds right into the film.  At the end, it cycles right back to the warning and starts over again.  Furthermore, although you can navigate forward and backward between chapters, they are not well placed.  Sometimes, the chapter puts you into the film in the middle of a word!  Nevertheless I am very happy to have this film on dvd.  I would rate the Synergy version as approximately acceptible if you love this film.  Also, having a dvd makes it easier to use in a history class.
I just did some research on this film for a grad project.  King Vidor was unable to obtain funding for ""Our Daily Bread.""  Banks did not want to fund a film that portrayed them in a bad light.  Vidor mortgaged everything he had to make it.  He made his money back, but not a great deal more.  Studios did not want to help with distribution.  Vidor finally got help from Charlie Chaplin to get it released through United Artists.  Vidor acknowledged his debt to Soviet filmaking for the film's finale, the desperate completion of an irrigation system to save the crops.  Put into the context of the rest of the film, it doesn't seem corny at all.  ""Our Daily Bread"" is subtitled ""Inspired by Headlines of Today.""  It certainly was.  It makes a good introduction to Depression America.  It wrestles with the problems people faced and the changes in attitudes some went through.  It does it in a reasonably entertaining manner.
By the way, I agree with the reviewer who noted that it is worthwhile to view Vidor's 1928 silent classic ""The Crowd.""  The two films complement each other well.",1247788800,9,1843,4.548780487804878
2056871,4,B00022LIO8,"Boy, is this film interpreted differently, depending on which critic is discussing it. Overall, however, most of them - including me - like this movie and find it interesting.

Today's critics like to use this film as a boost for socialistic or Commununstic causes, but that's baloney. One could easily do the opposite and use this film as an analogy to the early Christians, too - people who banded together pooling their talents and possessions for the good of the whole group.

This was a simply of story of America during the Great Depression with a bunch of people out of work, so they try to make a living by turning themselves into farmers and making a go of it together.

Tom Keane and Karen Morley star in here, playing husband-and-wife. Morely played a very upbeat, sweet lady who was joy to watch. Keane's acting was strange. At times it bordered on raw amateurism. He also looked, with the wild expressions, as if he were back doing a silent film.

The rest of the cast was solid, from the Swedish farmer to the tough guy who turned himself in to the police to help the rest of the group. Overall, a good film and worth watching, whatever your politics.

However - as others have pointed out here, this DVD is not worth your money. I can kick myself for trading my VHS copy, incorrectly assuming this DVD would be an upgrade in transfer quality. It wasn't.",1238630400,,1368,4.544715447154472
2056872,2,B00022LIO8,"Like the other reviewer, my rating is for the very poor quality of the DVD, not the film. The problem is, this film was produced by United Artists in 1934, so it is in the public domain - an orphaned work of art. United Artists was created as a counter to the studio system that ruled Hollywood from 1920 until 1950. The good part was that the artists owned their creations and had creative control over their works. The bad part - many copyrights expired and, if the films still exist, often exist with no clear owner and in bad shape.

To really appreciate this film you need to view King Vidor's 1928 silent classic ""The Crowd"". Both movies are the stories of John and Mary Sims. In the 1928 film, John is done in by his own mediocrity and dreaming during prosperous times overflowing with opportunity. Just six years later the couple by the same name is done in by the Great Depression. Although the two couples have the same name, this is not a sequel. It is King Vidor making a statement on the desperation of the times and how much difference just six years have made in the lives of average people. John actually shows quite a bit of leadership in this film versus ""The Crowd"". At the beginning, John and Mary are on the verge of being thrown into the street as John cannot find work. Mary's uncle saves the day by allowing them to move into and work a farm that has been foreclosed upon but that nobody wants due to the bad financial times. John, who says he could write a book about what he doesn't know about farming, is helped out by a Minnesota farmer whose own family has been kicked off their farm and is passing through. Pretty soon John gets the idea of turning the farm into a cooperative with people of all professions - plumbers, electricians, masons, etc. - joining in and setting up a system of bartering.

John Sims is voted the leader of the group, but there are obstacles along the way - a drought that threatens the crops and an ex-flapper who wants to lure John away from the cooperative and tries to convince him that it will never amount to anything.

This film is particularly relevant since the U.S. economy is facing challenges similar to those of the Great Depression again. The dollar is becoming the new Peso, oil hits new highs every day threatening to turn suburbs into Shruburbs, and real estate parallels the story of the original stock market crash - assets traded on margin for unrealistic value. Since clicking a mouse isn't a trade that translates into growing grain for ""our daily bread"" I can't help but wonder where we're headed. Few people have the practical skills that were abundant in the 1930's.

I recommend the out of print VHS copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Our-Daily-Bread/dp/6303046401/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Our Daily Bread</a>&nbsp;by Kino, if you can find it. That copy is watchable. Let's hope someone puts out a high quality version of this film on DVD soon.",1210291200,10,2975,4.726396917148362
2056873,5,B00022LIO8,"This movie comes from the Depression Era - it is a Historical Work at this time.  It portrays the World Views of  people living in the depression and how alone they were after loosing their income, homes and property.  They were just migrants traveling around in dilapidated cars looking for shelter and willing to live in 1 room cottages without running water.  The outhouse was most likely the community latrine.  Their clothes were washed in a tub.  It also demonstrates the simplicity of making movies - no frills and they still sold and no movie soundtracks for added income.  All of these people were also very thin...their meals in every day life even as movie stars were meager.  This is a window in the past that was only 85 years away, a place were very few of us could exist today.",1462665600,2,792,4.567375886524823

2056881,4,B00022LIO8,"a truely unique film for US. it's hard to imagine now it was even made in the US these days. During the height of the Depression, a man and his wife leave in their car to drive across America in search of survival, with few skills and a lot of moxie. They come to a camp where the man realizes that if they could unite with all the other desparate families around them, they have everything they need to prosper on their own, and so they do, with a great deal of hardship, with everyone pitching in and sharing what they have with each other. For the most part anyway as not everyone is perfect or willing to pitch in. There's one particular line I remember where the camp members are trying to decide around a camp fire how they should govern themselves. One man stands up and announces that what they need is a God fearing democracy, only to be put down by another with the line, Ah, that's what got us here in the first place. So they set up a communal farm with the original man in charge, with a taciturn John Wayne type character as his chief enforcer. They run into a severe draught that threatens to destroy everything they've put together, but manage to come together to dig a long irrigation ditch with all the rythm of a railroad gang to bring water to their thirsty crops. the final scene of joyous celebration in the mud is like something out of Woodstock. the acting styles and a fair number of the lines are rather hokey at times, but if it suits you, it's ok by me.",1363651200,10,1481,4.274021352313167

But for the times in which this was created, pushes boundaries of ethnicity (not race). Little glimpse at what many American's now lambaste as ""socialist."" Working together cooperatively, for mutual gain, mutual progress, community benefit; not just one single greedy corporation or one greedy capitalist. The story? During the depression a married couple accept the government's offer of free land to farm. The couple realizes that if they can work together with others, everyone will benefit. Enter a Floozy who wants to tear the couple apart. A drought threatening to ruin a bumper crop of corn. Will the husband run off with the floozy? Will the crop wither and die in the sun? Will the community effort end in recrimination and dissent? (If you like documentaries, you'll enjoy this film.)",1462838400,,970,5.031055900621118
