3782219,1,B001RXDM1I,"How is it in the modern era of television that a company is too lazy to include captions or subtitles on a disc? I've been mostly deaf all my life and have always had to use captions. Over 95 percent of the media created these days, I have no problem with... this even had captions when it was broadcast on TV (its required by law), but there are none here.

3782220,5,B001RXDM1I,"Take this as the Indiana-Jones-themed adventure film that it is, and sit back and enjoy it.  There is no need to consider this as a 'message film' (even if the theme concerns matters of faith and 'control of the truth,' both vitally important human issues, to be sure.)  If such questions are raised that provoke conversation, it is a credit to the screenwriter (or to the author of the book this adventure is based upon).  But I honestly don't feel that any such 'agenda' lies behind this film, and reviews that focus on religious or historical questions are missing the point.

Mira Sorvina is a talented actress and manages to pull off the leading role here with humor, intelligence, and lots of energy (it's a physically challenging role!)  The relationship she forms with the FBI agent assigned to the case (Scott Foley) works well and avoids coming across as 'caricature, which is a credit to both actors' abilities with a script that could easily have gone that way in less-talented hands.

If there is any 'message' to be found here, let it be the portrait of the simple, kind man that Omar Sharif plays near the end of the film. ""Joy is joy, life is life..,"" he says, and he offers up an example of 'simple truths' to live by.  Nice touch.

This is a thoroughly enjoyable mini-series, and one that is suitable for family viewing.  Yes, there is some violent content, but it's mostly the black hat vs. white hat kind, and is much less than much of the regular TV fare these days.  Good acting, great sets and scenery, and lots of adventure -- what's not to like!",1242432000,10,1570,4.575
3782221,1,B001RXDM1I,"The Last Templar, based upon the book by the same name, is another sad, too long (3+hrs.), bad acting, intellectually sordid, and historically repugnant, conspiracy theory movie made for TV. I don't sympathize for all those who played in the movie, they obviously needed the money, but they read the stupid script and thus became typical Hollywood idiots. The bad acting and mellow drama got so horrid I had to start fast forwarding through the movie in order to find out what the so-called ""big"" secret was the historically inaccurate myrmidon Templers were trying to hide. OOH I get it...the ""Jesus gospels,"" explaining how he was just a man and all that miracle stuff, virgin birth, being hounded by the Pharisees, being followed by nine men to include a mathematician, a lawyer, and a doctor, who gave up their lives for three years to follow him around the countryside and then to finally be tortured and nailed on the cross by the Romans was just a joke. Oh ya and that the Catholic Church is a monstrous organization and Christianity is fake...Get real. The turbid producers or mendacious script writers, in order to make the movie palatable or easier to keep the popcorn down, put in, `oh religion and faith in god is ok because it makes people feel good.' How hypocritical. This movie is as laughable as the Da Vinci Code. Even Tom Hanks couldn't save that movie and only destroyed his credibility at being a real intelligent actor (whatever that means). I hope no one took that movie seriously.  I really liked the part where the Templar Knights after surviving their ship being sunk from an unbelievable storm, dressed in full armor and sword, came walking out of the sea. These guy could Swim! But that's not the only movie fault, glitch, hiccup, or mistake in the film. If it weren't for the on sight location shots to see where not to vacation, or to catch some of the plot to see where the white knuckle intrigue was headed, I would have fast forwarded through the whole movie. Then again if I had known a little more of the plot, I wouldn't have watched it at all. Glad I never read the book someone gave me. If you want to waste your 3 plus hours of your life, intellectual perception, enjoy propaganda fiction, and get a distorted picture of history, rent it.

On a more enlightened note, it would be more accurate to rationally fictionalize that the Last Templar movie is sponsored by multiple atheist organizations which produced this slap stick historically fictional movie and who actually have a propaganda agenda to flatulence.  Now a movie about an atheist organization conspiracy within `Holywood'...that would be a great Film!!! I wonder if it would make it to the Sundance Film Festival? I wonder if Tom Hanks would play the lead role?",1242172800,4,2763,4.728215767634855
3782222,2,B001RXDM1I,"Based on all of the positive reviews I read on Amazon, we rented THE LAST TEMPLAR and were thoroughly disappointed--so much so that I wondered if we had watched the same movie!

I cannot fault the cast of solid actors that included Scott Foley and Victor Garber but Mira Sorvino portrayed her character like a sorority girl run amok instead of a seasoned archaeologist. And, the director actually shows a talent for staging action sequences. That said, all of this talent simply could not overcome entry-level writing and cliched, sometimes awkward plotting. At the core of this half-baked attempt to meld Indiana Jones with The DaVinci Code is the now-familiar story of the main character coming to grips with faith.  As someone who believes in God, I found TEMPLAR's treatment of this theme badly mishandled and embarrassing. The film is around four hours in length and feels twice that long.",1241740800,3,894,4.953333333333333
3782223,4,B001RXDM1I,"Having previously read (and enjoyed) the book, I wasn't too sure what the movie might bring.  I was pleasantly surprised.  A female Indiana Jones-type archeologist and an FBI agent team up to discover why 4 thieves dressed as Templar Knights of old rob a prominent gallery on horse-back.  A fine rollicking adventure movie in the spirit of Jones.  My only disappointment (if you can call it that) was insufficient emphasis on the twist at the end.  If you haven't read the book this fantastic development is almost lost in the need to wrap up the story.  The script does let the actors down in a couple of places, but the action sequences were well composed.  Overall - I thoroughly enjoyed.",1240617600,46,691,4.708333333333333
3782224,1,B001RXDM1I,"First off, let me put in a disclaimer. I really like Mira Sorvino. Not only do I think she's smoking hot, but I like her as an actress as well. I liked her in good movies like 'Mighty Aphrodite', and in bad ones like 'Mimic'. And I think 'Replacement Killers' is a four-star movie, one of my all-time favorite action flicks. I was even glad to see her as a guest star on 'House' last season! Despite all of this interest, I have to admit that I couldn't even get through the first 15 minutes of this TV mini-series. Such a shame - Mira still looks fantastic, but the lame dialog and cheesy directing meant I couldn't even get past the opening action scene. What a waste...",1238198400,10,672,4.299212598425197
3782225,5,B001RXDM1I,"I agree wholly with John's review. The Last Templar will delight and entertain as long as you take it for what it is - an interesting story in the vein of The DaVinci Code that will provide both laughs and adventure. If you have an open mind, it may even get you thinking.

Compared to the novel on which the movie was based, the character of Tess is funnier, wittier, and more enchanting on screen than on page. This is due in part to the wonderful portrayal of the character by Mira Sorvino who more than ""surprises as a credible intellectual"", as fellow reviewer Scott expressed - Sorvino is a Harvard alum who graduated magna cum laude and speaks fluent Chinese and French. She IS a credible intellectual cast in a part that allows her to show that side of her personality. Scott Foley, who portrays Agent Sean Reilly and of whom I've seen less work, was more of a surprise to me, playing the devout Catholic with humor and a touch of whimsy.

Having been raised Catholic but no longer practicing, I found the debates between Tess and Sean about religion to be very interesting and reminiscent of those between my mother and I. The overall theme of exactly what the Templar treasure is will garner your attention, but play second fiddle to the chemistry between Foley and Sorvino.

(Major plot spoiler warning) The one criticism I have is that the film version doesn't explain the treasure as successfully as the novel does. In the novel it is very clear that the treasure is a faked version of the gospel of Jesus, with the intent that it be used to unite all religions. In the film, the ending Templar scenes make the viewer aware the document was falsified, but the reasoning for doing so is never made clear, nor will the viewer necessarily catch this fact the first time through.

For those who criticize the film as being just more of the same Catholic bashing that appears to permeate the media, I ask that you really look at the character of Sean and what his beliefs say, the character of Tess and how her beliefs change over the course of the film, and the character of DeAngelis, who is shown to be operating by himself with no support of the Church or Vatican. As Sean intones in a conversation with Tess, there's nothing wrong with doubt - it's dismissal that's the problem. Give this movie a chance. Watch it with an open mind. You'll be glad you did.",1235347200,104,2369,4.515151515151516

3782228,1,B001RXDM1I,"If amazon had a ""negative"" star rating, I would use it.
Researched this movie thoroughly and ordered it because the content sounded interesting and it was rated TVG. Just returned it to amazon because it is not a family-friendly flick. This review is for the conservative parent who wonders if this movie is for their family.
Previews: One for a rated R movie (explicit wordage), one for a rated PG13 (including explicit sex scenes). No option to skip previews and go straight to menu.
Foul language: Includes but is not limited to ""s-o-b"" (full wordage) and ""f***ing"".
Violence: Several brutal on-screen murders.
Sex: Actress wears numerous skimpy outfits; semi-clothed but very obvious sex scene between the lead actor/actress.
Spiritual content: Plot involves search for the ""real"" treasure of the Knights of the Templar. Many references are made to their devotion to the church, and the viewer keeps watching, waiting for that redemptive moment to dawn. But the ""real"" treasure turns out to be a faked copy of  ""the Gospel of Jesus Christ -- just a man,"" as one actor says.
The Knights of the Templar continue to fascinate, and this could have been a really great movie. But it's just a waste of talent (there are a couple of good performances) and time and resources (the viewer's).

3782232,2,B001RXDM1I,"A low budget film made for tv which starts out fine,with what looks like a promising lost artifact adventure.
I love Mira Sorvino and the price was under $10 so I grabbed it up.
Other reviewers cover most of the basic information but leave out a few things.
SPOILER ALERT-
The early action sequence where Mira chases after one of the ""templars"" and not only knocks him off his horse,breaking some bones in the process even though he is wearing chainmail while only breaking one of her high heels(!) is preposterous.
I didn't realize anthropologists jousted on a regular basis.
It is a movie,and she is the lead,so such things must be allowed.
This aired in two parts I believe and while part one is good fun preposterous adventure,the end of the second part turns into a ""finding Jesus"" moment for the main character.
The actual treasure is a let down-it is essentially fake.
Old yes,real no.
Mira actually lets it be destroyed after all she went through to find it.
The last templar is also a let down,essentially the rather weak ""villain"" of the movie proclaims himself such before his comeuppance.
There are actually multiple villains in the film but only one proclaims himself the last templar.
Omar Sharif is only in the tail end of this movie to more or less help Mira get in touch with her spirituality.
He does get a few good moments,but what a waste of a great actor.
Mira is essentially rewarded by God for destroying the so called treasure-Scott's character comes out of his coma.
This end sequence slows the movie to a grinding halt and it stops being anything remotely resembling an adventure film.
Really,the entire tone changes and you feel like you are watching a completely different animal than the one you started with.
If you are very religious you will enjoy,but I prefer my scientists more science-y.
I'm going to re-watch ""Hooten and the Lady"" to wash the taste of this out of my mouth.",1495324800,2,1909,4.684523809523809

3782254,3,B001RXDM1I,"Probably the most glaring flaw of this rather over-long but somewhat entertaining religious-mystery in the same vain as the Da Vinci Code is its depiction of Turkey which looks more like Saudi Arabia in the film. (Turkey is a relatively plush and green landscape with some brown rolling hills, but not like the Sahara desert of Iraq and Saudi Arabia.) According to the back-story, the Templar Knights of the Middle Ages were on the verge of extinction in the late 13th century. (At dawn on Friday, 13 October 1307, many Templars were arrested on trumped up charges, and many were executed which destroyed the Order of Templar Knights.)

The Templars have in their possession a document purportedly revealing the location of ancient Jewish-Hebrew treasures uncovered beneath the ruins of the ancient Jewish Temple of Jerusalem which was destroyed by the Romans in 66 CE. The master of the Templars ordered the document to be taken by a special envoy of knights back to Turkey. Jerusalem is under siege from Saracens who were conquering part of Jerusalem which was under the control of Christian Crusaders and Byzantine Eastern Orthodox. (Islam would permanently take control of Jerusalem and the Near East in the 15th century, only a few decades before Columbus' voyage.)

Fast-forward 700 years. At a special exhibition at a museum in New York, artifacts of ancient and early medieval Christianity are on display. One of the artifact-finders is an Indiana Jones type, Tess Chaykin (Mira Sorvino). According to the story, her father had found the Cross of Constantine which he supposedly held on his deathbed when he converted to Christianity in the mid-4th century, an artifact which just happens to be on display. In the film, the ornate Cross itself looks like a Latin Cross in the style of many centuries later, more akin to those of the time of Charlemagne, circa 800 CE and later, not like the Cross Constantine would have known. Constantine's Cross looked more like an ""X"" with a ""P"" on the top, called the ""Chi Rho"". This is just one example of many little ""flaws"" in the film which would certainly cause the raising of eyebrows of many-an historian of Early Christianity.

Then four guys on horses dressed in Templar garb with helmets storm the exhibit and snag several of the artifacts, including the Cross and some sort of 13th-century decoder with metal gears about the size of your average box of corn flakes. Again, such an artifact would have only been conducive no earlier than the Renaissance in the late 15th century, not as early as the 1200's as suggested by the film, another one of the film's interesting ""innovations"". Tess subdues the ""Templar"" with the Cross but the others get away. Turns out the entire escapade was masterminded by Bill Vance (Kenneth Welsh), a fellow archaeologist and friend of Tess' father. Turns out he only wanted the decoder because of a secret document he found which is in ""Templar Code"". However, Vance's accomplices are being killed by an assailant whose motives are as of yet unknown. FBI agent Sean Daley (Scott Foley) is hot on Tess' trail, at first suspecting she's behind the murders of the ""Templar"" thieves of the museum. We also learn Daley is a devout Catholic, and because the artifacts belong to the Vatican, he turns to a Monsignor in the diocese of New York, played by Victor Garber, who interestingly enough played Jesus in the film version of the hippie-religious musical ""Godspell"", produced in the early 1970's.

The film then becomes similar to ""The Da Vinci Code"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", and ""National Treasure"" where the codes lead to other secret messages which in turn lead to other places. All the while, we get flashbacks to the small band of Templars of the late 13th century and what they were trying to accomplish. The trail leads Tess and Agent Daley to Turkey where the messages claim they hid a secret artifact in a Byzantine Church. One of the film's strengths is we see the episode in flashback of the Templar's adventures only as the next clue reveals what they had done. Part of what makes the whole thing work is a memorable performance by Mira Sorvino. Although I'm sure she wasn't nominated for any awards for this film, we run with it largely because of her. I thought Foley's performance as the FBI agent seemed a beat inconsistent, where he's portrayed as a devout catholic while simultaneously seeming uncaring about the Templar artifacts.

So much of the film has elements which mirror the Da Vinci Code. Bill Vance is very similar to the character of Sir Leigh Teabing, scholar of Early Christianity and the so-called Priory. Vance is portrayed as the foremost scholar of the Templar Knights. The enigmatic and silent assailant is a cold assassin, similar to Silas of the Da Vinci Code, although in ""The Last Templar"" he's black instead of an albino. Tess has elements of both Indiana Jones and Robert Langdon, and of course she's coupled together with a member of the opposite sex who's an FBI agent, similar to Agent Sophie Neveu of the French police who gets together with Langdon. Overall, the story seems to be about archaeology versus faith which has become a hot-button issue in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, particularly in the wake of the discoveries of known Christian gospels found in Egypt in the 1940's. The theme is a decent one, although I am not sure I bought the overall point of view of the story which is revealed in the final climactic scene. Similar to Leigh Teabing, Bill Vance becomes a rather enigmatic character who seems at odds with who is by film's end.",1467590400,,5591,4.8258602711157454

3782260,3,B001RXDM1I,"This is a TV mini-series but I saw it at home, all at once, an almost three hour experience that I do not want to repeat.  What we find enjoyable or even acceptable in a mini-series does not necessarily translate well into a standard movie experience.  I ordered out the move because I wanted to see more of the work of Mira Sorvino, an Oscar winner and a really top flight actress.  Sorvino  is asked by director Pablo Barzman (40 TV credits)  to focus her mega watt personality on her co-star Scott Foley (many TV roles).  Her character, a top level archaeologist, likes his character, an FBI guy, and she presents an absolutely adorable face to him, we guess to entice him.  Well, when she puts her mind to it, she is irresistible, no question about it.  But that is it.  In every situation, she focuses on the FBI guy and that is pretty much it as far as her acting assignment is concerned.  She can do much more.
  Oman Sharif has a small but very important role at the end of the film as a sort of wisdom figure.  I admit that he made me cry in the best written and best acted scenes of the whole long movie.  Well established character actor Victor Garber has a pivotal role as a Catholic Church official which he completes with his usual skill.

3782280,5,B001RXDM1I,I truly enjoy Mira Sorvino and Scott Foley as the leads in this movie along with their excellent supporting cast. This story was highly suspenseful and had many twists and turns in the plot with a surprising finish. I enjoy Mira as an archaeologist who has unofficially retired only to find a challenge she cannot refuse! Scott Foley is an FBI agent involved in the case where she and he meet at the beginning of the story and they keep crossing paths as the plot continues to push them towards each other right through to the ending. I definitely think this was a worthy buy and encourage you to check it out! :-),1430784000,3,614,4.442477876106195

But-- I did not see any chemistry between Tess and the FBI agent and Mira Sorvino was a little too bubbly at times.  It took me a good portion of the first part of the movie to get over the picture of Mia Sorvino in a sexy party dress, running in expensive high heels, grabbing a staff and leaping on a convienent police horse to gallop down the streets and into the park on a horse to subdue a bad guy jousting him with a staff off his horse while yelling for them to stop and bring that back.

The woman in the movie was arrogant and flippant - and really wasn't up to the part.  There was no ""connection"" to the FBI guy - no charm - no electricity - and that was so well presented in the book.  They altered the story in several parts and I'll say it was a budget issue because they didn't do the parts that would have cost a lot to film - the storm at sea, for example, was skimmed over and then they were rescued.  At several points, I lost interest altogether and got up and walked away.  All in all, it's lucky I gave the movie one star.  Read the book instead.",1358467200,2,706,4.065217391304348

3782346,2,B001RXDM1I,"To describe this movie, I would say, imagine the Brendan Frasier movie ""The Mummy"". It kicks into an adventure to uncover something that has been lost for centuries while other people try to stop them from discovering it and keep it hidden. Only before the good guys open The Mummy's tomb, they decide, ""You know what, it was buried for a reason. God's will closed this thing for a reason, and we shouldn't mess with god. Let's leave it and go home born again Christians"". That's pretty much how this movie goes. A woman is on the hunt to find lost writings from an ancient race of people known as the Templars while a priest and his hit-man henchman are on their tail to stop them from discovering a lost chapter of the bible that could reveal that Jesus was just a man and that religion is a sham.

The movie sucks you in until the end of the movie where the woman who discovers the writings becomes a born again christian and doesn't want to read the writings and decides the world should remain believing in what they want to beleive. I felt cheated, because the movie was going nicely as a believable story, and all of a sudden the writer thinks what he/she has written is sacrilegious and begs for forgiveness with the fear of god inside him/her and quickly changes the outcome in favor of religious nonsense.

If Indiana Jones suddenly figured ""Nah, better not go there, let god sort them out"" then you would have a very anti-climactic movie, right? Well, this one managed to be just as anti-climatic as possible. Sure, there are good and bad people in the world, but saying it in a bad ending is not the outcome people watching this film want to see. It's like how Chuck Norris was cool in the 80's, then suddenly became ""Walker Touched By an Angel Words Solve Everything without the need for Violence Texas Ranger""... it's like Bruce Lee selling perfume, Batman showing up and saying you must always put the toilet seat back down... Luke Skywalker ramming the Jedi religion down your throat by knocking on your door and asking to come in and talk about a higher midiclorean purpose, Super Mario going into a Mushroom Kingdom temple to beg for forgiveness for stomping on goombas and making a million koopa-troppas homeless without a shell... it's just not what you want to see.",1354320000,,2286,4.573170731707317

Well, this is another one of them and actually not a very good one of them.

3782349,4,B001RXDM1I,"This is a unique perspective on a movie made from a book. I am in the middle of reading the book right now, and decided to check Amazon's lists because it seemed such a natural for being made into a movie. It was. So I ordered it, and it came, and I watched it. Right in the middle of reading the book.

First, there are a lot of changes, so I don't know if the second half of the movie tells me all that much about the second half of the book. Since I've long accepted that a book has to be changed to put it on a movie screen, I tried not to be disappointed. Objectively, the movie is well made and exciting, even if it over-simplifies the rather amazing complexity of the book.

The first of two main characters is Tess Chaykin (Mira Sorvino), an archeologist who is way too pretty to be taken for an archeologist in that short cocktail dress in which she first appears, all glitter and fancy high heels. She's at the museum in New York to attend the opening of the Treasures of the Vatican exhibit when four horsemen dressed in Knights Templar costumes ride their horses right up the steps and into the museum. What are they doing? Causing mayhem, of course, but rather different mayhem than in the book.

The second main character is FBI agent Sean Daley (Scott Foley), who was there to protect the treasures and is therefore responsible for what happened when the Four Horsemen smashed display cases and stole gem-encrusted gold artifacts, including one which Tess's archeologist father had discovered. Naturally, she couldn't let them get away with that.

Again, nowhere near the same as the book, but it did simplify into a few minutes what took a lot of time and the involvement of several people in the book. Sorry if I'm harping on the differences; they sort of stand out at times.

One of the people injured in the melee was Clive Edmonston (Anthony Lemke), apparently connected with the museum or the exhibit or something (not obvious to me), and spends the rest of the movie with his broken arm in a cast that supports his arm up at shoulder height and bent forward, braced against his side with a wide leather belt. Does he need a baby-sitter? OK, Tess's precocious 10-year-old daughter Kim (Rebecca Windheim) will look after him while Tess and Sean go off chasing (1) the treasure of the Templars and (2) the villain that masterminded the raid on the museum.

Ah, but is he a villain? And who is the shadowy character that's trying to kill him? Who does he work for, and why? These were things I knew from the book, but it did not lessen the impact of the story one bit. When a reservoir in the book was traded for a valley of volcanic ash, I knew I couldn't count on the ending at all. Personally, I'm looking forward to finishing the book.

Enjoy this movie. It really is very entertaining.",1336608000,,2808,4.461988304093567
3782350,4,B001RXDM1I,Take note of the running time.  This is a long movie.  I like Mira Sorvino so I liked the movie more than the average person would. The action isn't super heated but it's at a pace that still keeps you interested in it.  Throughout the movie the Templars are used as a tool which by the end of the movie has Tess uniting her scientific mind with a mind of faith.  All in all a good movie.,1335916800,3,388,4.0
3782351,1,B001RXDM1I,"I honestly do not know where to start with this trash. It is based on the novel by Raymond Khoury, who must be kicking himself for allowing his name to be attached to this Dan Brownesque tripe. It supposedly starts with four `crusaders' riding into a Vatican Exhibition in modern day New York, they behead a police officer before riding into the building and stealing a load of priceless artefacts.

Then our heroine Tess Chaykin (Mira Sorvino) grabs a Crozier and a police horse and charges off to joust with one of them. This is whilst the NYPD stand around doing nothing - yeah right. Then the FBI gets involved in the shape of Sean Daley (Scott Foley). What develops is a plot that is so implausibly bad that it will make your eyes water. This is all about the Knights Templar and their hidden treasure which has been oft speculated about. We have a tale of three Templar's back in 1291 escaping from Jerusalem via a river, Jerusalem is land locked and has no river. They then watch it burn from the sea. Yep they had pretty good vision in those days as its is some 30 odd miles from the coast.

Then they get shipwrecked but manage to make it to shore in full chain mail where they bury something that will undermine the entirety of the scriptures and therefore Christianity. Then back to modern day and the hapless Ms Sorvino who gets emotionally attached to the FBI bloke and heads off to Bodrum in Turkey which despite claims from the Turkish Tourist Board that is lush, green and a modern city, turns out to be a desert where people can not even speak Turkish. They uncover more plot and find out that the Vatican is involved and a rogue archaeologist puts in another appearance to add some excessive `ham' to the whole proceedings.

This was made for TV and was shown in two episodes, that is why it is in two parts on the DVD and you need to go back to the menu to see the second part, but trust me it aint worth the effort. Even if you suspend belief it is still a wafer thin plot, the acting is below average to over the top shouting. The plot holes are excessive, we even have a Jeep that explodes after being hit by another car - I mean come on guys. Then there are the tame rats, some pointless padding and the historical gaffs just make for an excruciating experience. Only plus is that Omar Sharif puts in a good performance for about ten minutes of this three hour dross,. Yes it is three hours long and requires nerves of steel to get through the lot; luckily I rented this and had to watch in two sittings with a few beers for stamina on the second round. This is really one of the most tedious experiences of my life, do your self a favour watch `The Da Vinci Code' instead, this is that bad.",1332374400,,2714,4.328094302554027

I found the movie to be overlong but entertaining just the same.  I didn't attempt to ""make sense"" of its plot because I knew going in that wouldn't be a consideration (in the end, I had to overlook the ending....both of them).  Amusingly, if anyone comes off poorly during the course of this movie it's the FBI, not the Catholics.  Consider: the bad guys outwit them continuously, an old coot outwits them, Mira's character outwits them; this was a terrible endorsement for the FBI any way you look at it (or, maybe just that agent, played by Scott Foley?).
I wasn't that crazy about the flashbacks; they kept intruding and mucking up the flow of things.  There were also too many plot devices that felt exactly like plot devices (the kiss you knew would be coming, the ceiling falling in at that exact moment when it obviously stayed in place for hundreds of years, the agent having a `Poe' moment....).  Still, they handled it well enough making it quite watchable.  I do wish though that Victor Garber would stop specializing in villains, it's getting to the point where I see his name in the credits I automatically assume he's the bad guy.  In this case, a gun toting killer Monsignor!

Yes, denizens of Amazon-com, welcome to the not-so-wonderful world of ""The Last Templar"". I just finished watching the first episode, and I'm somewhat sceptical about watching the rest!

Tess Chaykin isn't very convincing as feminist vigilante. I mean, she's no Lisbeth Salander, is she? The constant flirtation between Ms. Chaykin and Catholic choirboy Sean Reilly is embarrassing, to say the least, and please note the name of the priest: De Angelis. You're kidding, right? But then, the religious fanatic in ""End of Days"" was named Thomas Aquinas!

And why is the hired assassin a Black man? I thought Canada would be politically correct by now...

Thank God I'm not a Catholic. I would have been even more annoyed by ""The Last Templar"" if I had been. Perhaps I would have attacked the New York Metropolitan wielding a sword and a somewhat knightly outfit? Being of the feminist persuasion, I was more annoyed by Tess dressed in sexist garb chasing the virile knights on horseback. That's feminist? Sheesh. Looks more like a comic flick from the old fifties.

I'm intrigued by the high ratings this production has gotten on Amazon. Can't people tell the difference between a good show and pure bunk? But then, I suppose you *could* appreciate ""The Last Templar"", if you take it as a turkey. Pun intended.

It's a terrific adventure with some thoughtful undertones, well-filmed and with top performances from all involved. After reading the book I decided to revisit the movie on DVD, and my initial impression held true. That said, I do have three caveats: (1) At nearly three hours, it's about a third longer than necessary; (2) two scenes where Sorvino's character turns into an action heroine (the joust at the beginning, and the subterranean smackdown with the menacing thugs) just didn't ring true; and (3) the nature of the Templar's secret should have been spelled out more clearly at the end.

Garber, as always, nailed his character, making me wonder once again how such seemingly nice guys can play to their dark side so convincingly.

3782368,1,B001RXDM1I,"""The Last Templar"" abounds with clichs - from the front cover and throughout the whole series of episodes it is a collection of what is the current fashion in film. Mira Sorvino as the lead character Tess Chaykin was annoying as an actor. Her hair was all over the place, she had an awful smile and did not do the role of a ""go get 'em"" archaeologist any justice. It was also very contrived. For example, how can an FBI agent all of a sudden jump on a plane with absolutely no preparation to follow Tess Chaykin. It is all very well to have a little bit of artistic licence but it was all taken too far in this case. No eye candy, no special effect and poor acting - a waste of time watching it.",1271376000,,695,4.117647058823529
3782369,1,B001RXDM1I,"Dismal, appalling, woeful, weak, pathetic are all words that could be used to describe this pitiful excuse for a movie. I cannot believe I made it to the end of this unjustifiably lengthy ordeal without either falling asleep or turning it off. I guess I just wanted to see where Omar Sharif fitted into it, after all he is on the cover. Finally in the last 15 minutes or so of this abomination he does turn up, but even he cannot coax it back from the depths of mediocrity. He must be getting desperate for roles in his later years, otherwise why would he sign on after reading such a pantomime script. I'm sure the only reason that he got featured on the cover art was in the hope that his presence might shift a few more copies. This was obviously made to cash in on the success of Dan Brown's novels and their movie adaptions and while National Treasure got away with it by virtue of a decent budget, actors and storyline this can boast none of those redeeming features. The female lead is not even remotely believable as the bimbo Archeologist and the majority of the remaining cast are more wooden than the ark. The villains of the piece are about as menacing as my dead Grandmother and there are such obvious set flaws that even a child would spot them. How about the perfectly preserved town hidden beneath layers of easilly shovelled lava that looks just like sand. A place buried so deep that shafts of sunlight can beam in from every angle. There are of course the brave knights who wander the desert in blazing heat and swim vast stormy oceans in full chain mail and armour with swords at their side. Instead of our intrepid Templars it is the viewer who is left with that sinking feeling. I must admit that I have never read the book as many other reviewers here seem to have done, but it would have to be better than this. I give it one star for Mr Sharif.

She finds assistance from a variety of people that may not seem likely champions for her cause. One such partner in her adventure, played by Scott Foley, does a nice job of being an opened minded religious person.

3782371,4,B001RXDM1I,"The finest part of this movie is the last 15 minutes or so, with Omar Sharif as a hermit on a tiny Greek island who rescues the shipwrecked hunters of the legendary Templar Treasure. The smooth Sharif hasn't lost his stuff, and at the end of the film we were disappointed that he did not play a a leading or greater support role. His fees must still be high...

We bought this DVD for the kids to watch and ended up sitting attentively all the way through it, actually enjoying the distraction. It is a typical actioner of the Indiana Jones sort, and has to do with a hunt for the fabled Treasure of the Templar Knights. All sorts of shenanigans by corrupt Church authorities who send an assassin to stop the hunt, a greedy old archaeologist who wants to be credited with finding the ""treasure"", the discovery of a false gospel document discrediting the Church, and a daring young archaeologist who beats them all (and falls in love...). I must say the story is leaky: the stretching of historical facts, muddling religion/faith with superstition and legend - seems to be a necessary combination to make such a film in the first place. If you like this type of story, the film will amuse you quite a bit.

The action parts of the movie were filmed in Morocco, even though the treasure hunt has the two seekers in Turkey digging up an old Byzantine church. The Moroccan scenery is quite obvious - Marrakesh market square with all its snake-oil vendors, acrobats & jugglers, and fortune tellers, for example. The acting is pretty good, but Omar Sharif takes the cake in this one. We give it a 4-star rating.",1265846400,3,1605,4.569444444444445

  (a.) five people on horses riding into a metropolitan museum with a hundred guests and police and make off with half a dozen priceless protected/secured artifacts in 10 minutes using only swords;
  (b.) or a church in the middle of a non-volcanic desert region being buried in lava (with no damage) and a 125 lb skinny archaeologist digs through it with a shovel!!;
  (c.) hugh shafts of light beam down through holes in the desert but most of the church shows little or no sand/dust in it;

LIke when the village is covered with volcanic lava or ash that is red and looks like sand, really!!!  And the Vatican would really hire a hit man to enforce its will, unbelievable.  Christianity is really the reason that the world is full of wars?  NBC should be ashamed.  I felt that I was deceived in purchasing this movie, and I threw it in the garbage where it belongs..",1510012800,,587,4.1415929203539825
