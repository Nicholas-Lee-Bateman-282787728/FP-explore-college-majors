6647670,2,B00NE0ZQMA,"The only redeemable quality to this movie was the overdue outcome of the neighbor, Darla. I couldn't stand that character. Movie was gross, gory, and silly.",1414800000,2,156,5.038461538461538
6647671,2,B00NE0ZQMA,"WOW!
Supposedly this film is based on real life events.  If the real life characters were as dumb as the characters in this movie - humanity is doomed!
Not only was the acting a joke but the decisions these characters made were beyond ridiculous.

I just can't get over the fact that this movie has any 4 or 5 reviews - and I enjoy a cheesy movie every now and then.",1414800000,9,366,4.140845070422535
6647672,2,B00NE0ZQMA,"Yeah, I didn't like the acting. When she said she would release an entire ""clip,"" I pretty must stopped carrying where this movie was going. The correct term should be a magazine. I watched five minutes after that and realized she shouldn't even be holding a gun at all not even as an actor, lol. Pointing it at her friend, warning shot at her friend, yeah... this girl needs to take some shooting courses especially if she's traumatized from a previous event and wants to protect herself.",1414627200,,489,4.632183908045977
6647673,4,B00NE0ZQMA,"Cleverly written and acted with gusto. A devilish good time, nasty and gory action but never quite over the top, so it maintained some credibility. Somewhat surprising yet inspired ending. A bit campy at times so only 4.5 stars but as long as your are not too squeamish and are open-minded about what twisted torture could be, see it.",1414540800,6,334,4.677966101694915
6647674,1,B00NE0ZQMA,"Amateur acting, poor scripting and generally unwatchable. Some people might see it as a comedy but not me. Also was too talky at times with lots of preaching. Ugh.",1414108800,,163,4.655172413793103
6647675,5,B00NE0ZQMA,"""Killing Mr. Right"" is a straight-up fun independent horror film from Houston, TX.  It pulls no punches and goes straight for exciting, funny, and sexy story-telling.  The performances are fantastic, and the special effects are executed with glee.  ""Killing Mr. Right"" is a true joyride of violence, comedy, grindhouse retribution, and clear narrative.  Very original.  You will never see a stun stick the same again- or acid based products. High Recommendation.  Just don't show it to Grandma- unless Grandma listens to White Zombie and smokes Marlboro Reds.  Well done.",1413849600,9,571,5.348314606741573
6647676,5,B00NE0ZQMA,"I was expecting some twists and turns in this movie, but this was a real roller-coaster ride. I feel the need to take a long shower after watching this but I don't want to be alone right now. A true horror film that relies more on the story than the special effects. Loved it.",1413849600,13,276,4.12962962962963
6647677,5,B00NE0ZQMA,Killing Mr. Right by Kerry Beyer. The acting in this film was phenomenal. This is also another one where you can't say much without spoiling it. Pretty wicked twist and turns. Amazing film. Elizabeth Jackson won the The David Hess Memorial Best Performance at the 6th Annual Blood Bath Film Festival 2014! I highly recommend it. -Remy,1413763200,13,334,4.87719298245614
6647678,5,B00NE0ZQMA,"This is an intense psychological thriller, which shows the depths of depravity to which one can be made to go by virtue of the circumstances at hand.  Fast moving and truly terrifying in places.  Definitely not for the faint of heart or for tender viewers.  Excellent script, and performances by Elizabeth Jackson as ""Jessica"" in the lead, and Kerry Beyer as ""Mark"" as her nemesis.  Don't watch this alone . . . . .",1412380800,9,415,4.5675675675675675

6647681,1,B00NE0ZQMA,"The thought was there, but poorly executed.  I know the funding is lacking for Independent so I think they did the best they could.  The story was OK.",1462838400,,150,4.321428571428571

6647683,1,B00NE0ZQMA,"I didn't finish watching it because it was so bad. The idea could be a good story, but everything about this movie was bad--from the acting, to the very poor taste in evey aspect of the story. So amateurish it could have been done as a home movie.  Perhaps it was?  The actors were not chosen for their skills; perhaps they were family members???",1461801600,,346,4.390625

6647688,3,B00NE0ZQMA,Better than I thought it would be. Very low budget but it was ok. The plot sort of got away from the director at the end I think. All in all pretty good.,1446076800,,153,3.6666666666666665

6647694,4,B00NE0ZQMA,"Overall I liked this movie- it was a little slow to start for me, and a little talky at times, but I didn't mind because it set up the characters. The second half of the movie, I enjoyed more as some quirky and campy characters were introduced- there was definitely some comedy mixed in with it, and I liked that. The pimp and his big man toy had me laughing as well as the psychic neighbor and quirky cops. I watched it to the end and liked the ending (sometimes I don't make it through independent type movies).",1431734400,2,513,4.244897959183674

6647704,5,B00NE0ZQMA,"Horror indie Killing Mr. Right brings on the craziness immediately. A chick has a flashback dream of being abducted and raped by a guy in a hood and mask. When she wakes up, she meets her roommates fianc&eacute; and is convinced hes the guy who raped her! Before long, shes got him tied to a chair and is all ready to give him a taste of her rapists medicine.

But this isn't an hour and a half of her torturing him. Theres plenty of implied pain, but were not subjected to anything overly-graphic; its very downplayedalthough the implications are pretty extreme. However, it avoids exploitation because the tone is mostly tongue-in-cheek thanks in large part to the quirky performances of the actors. The plot takes wild twists and turns, moving at a fast clip and keeping you wondering where this could all possibly be heading because it goes to places you totally wouldnt predict.

If you're an indie horror junkie and prefer well-crafted low-budget horror over big budget mainstream stuff, definitely check this one out.",1423612800,5,1024,4.845714285714286
6647705,4,B00NE0ZQMA,"Definitely a must see.  A bunch of no-name actors, but good acting.  A handful of unexpected twists throughout.  Once you get past the opening credits, the movie moved along at a decent pace.",1422316800,2,191,4.7272727272727275
6647706,3,B00NE0ZQMA,"Killing Mr. Right was wrong in so many ways. You could see that the story itself had the potential to be really good, but for some reason it didn't quite make it. Maybe it was the bad acting, or the fact that the characters were un believable, or that the dialouge between the players was just corny when they were trying to have witty banter.  It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but there will be no need for repeat performances. If you like a lot of blood and gore, mixed  with a silly circus of performers then this one will be right up your alley.",1421971200,,558,4.205607476635514

6647709,2,B00NE0ZQMA,"I cannot recommend this movie. It's predictable and, therefore, not suspenseful. It's not scary either.",1419206400,,103,5.933333333333334
6647710,4,B00NE0ZQMA,Gruesome horror with enough twists and turns to keep you wondering how long can all this go on? The male lead actor who also wrote and directed it does a professional job; the female lead lacks that something that makes the difference between an experienced actress and still learning.,1419206400,,285,4.836734693877551
6647711,1,B00NE0ZQMA,"it starts off well and then becomes corny.  A shame, the acting by Mr. R. is pretty good and the premise had such good potential.  Just a bloody, gory mess....literally.",1418688000,2,169,4.6
6647712,3,B00NE0ZQMA,"This is a black comedy that will keep viewers awake, shocked, disgusted, and laughing.  I am not sure if the terrible acting is part of the satire.",1418515200,,147,4.444444444444445
6647713,1,B00NE0ZQMA,"As others have said, the acting came off as rehearsed, and did not feel real at all, and the characters did not have depth.  The movie felt flat, and as such removed any suspense the plot may have been trying to build.  We didn't find anything funny or scary with the film.  An unfortunate waste of time.

For those interested in watching this, I'd recommend Hard Candy instead.",1416960000,,378,4.514705882352941

6647715,2,B00NE0ZQMA,"Vengeance, torture to the extreme, murder, bad acting. I can't describe this movie any other way. Yes, there were some twists, but they were so absurd, it was almost laughable. The only part of the movie that I liked was the dark humor at the ending. Waste of money.",1415577600,4,266,4.448979591836735
6647716,4,B00NE0ZQMA,"Really enjoyed this flick. A very good story with some nice twists and very good acting.  The female lead was great.

The production was well done using minimal locations and has a high technical standard for an indie film.

Check it out you won't regret it.",1415404800,2,258,4.565217391304348
6647717,5,B00NE0ZQMA,"Horror films are very polarizing, people either love or hate everything about them, so I recommend watching the Trailer and Behind the Scenes footage to see if this movie is for you. I rarely watch a movie twice, but I enjoyed seeing this one as much the second time as the first.  It is truly a psychological thriller with constant twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat until the end, even during the second viewing when I knew what was going to happen.  Multi-talented Screenwriter/Director/Co-Producer/Actor Kerry Beyer effectively utilizes Film Noir features and quick cuts to heighten suspense, interspersed with well timed comic relief replete with situational and verbal irony. The actors adeptly rise to the challenge of believably and seamlessly transitioning between abrupt plot turns and between drama to comedy and back.  Award-winning actress, Elizabeth Jackson, demonstrates her range in bringing the psychologically complex main character Jessica to life, and she and her nemesis Mark played by Beyer engage in an intense, unrelenting cat and mouse game. Enjoy!!",1415318400,3,1092,5.264367816091954
6647718,2,B00NE0ZQMA,"I watched this because I was curious... the movie was rated almost 50/50 love and hate. I have to agree with low raters on this one,,The acting came off as stiff, rehearsed, and almost comical it was so over done.  It was so forced it seemed like overkill (pun intended).  The two room mates, the boyfriend, the nosy neighbor, first cop.. all of them.  The roommate who had been traumatized was the worst.. she was trying to come off as crazy  or suffering a psychotic break from PTSD but it was not believable,. Trust me you will not not miss anything if you bypass this movie.",1415059200,5,578,4.4245283018867925

8677547,4,B00NE0ZQMA,"I've started watching and then had to turn off so many awful low budget horror or thriller Prime movies lately that I was skeptical going into this one. Not only did I not turn this one off right away, I actually got engrossed. While there were a few spots where the acting was a bit amateurish, it was never distractingly bad, and for the most part the characters and acting were engaging. I look forward to seeing more from Liz Jackson, Kerry Beyer (who I was just surprised to see was also the writer and director! It's very rare to find a low budget movie starring, written, and directed by the same person to actually be any good, but he handled all 3 jobs well and was very nice to look at) and Amy Morris (her scene was brief but memorable, her character had the potential to be obnoxious and cheesy but she made her likable). The writing was surprisingly good, and managed to keep you guessing whether the main character was right or really delusional. I really liked the conversation's near the end (starting around the ""mindfuck"" comment). With this subject matter I was half expecting to be disappointed by a Lifetime reject, but good writing managed to keep the familiar elements from making the movie seem stale.

There were several elements that could have been more polished, but overall it was entertaining and worth watching.",1491523200,2,1342,4.662447257383966
