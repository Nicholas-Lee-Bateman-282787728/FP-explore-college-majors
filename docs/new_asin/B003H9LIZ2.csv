4124771,5,B003H9LIZ2,This was the best season of Earth Final Conflict with Season 2 being next best.  After that the series loses its way and never really ends properly.  But if you want to begin the journey Gene Roddenberry intended Seasons 1 and 2 would be good to watch as long as you do not mind never getting to the end. The new V series reminds me of how Earth Final Conflict started out.  Will be interesting to see if it loses its way also.,1293667200,,427,4.120481927710843
4124772,3,B003H9LIZ2,"I was so happy to learn that Earth Final Conflict was finally being released on DVD.  The Season One release was great - excellent sound and picture quality, cast interviews, an interview with Majel and Gene Roddenberry's son, and other extras; so when Season Two was released, I didn't hesitate to order it.  I wish I hadn't.  There are no subtitles or closed captioning available on the set, and the sound quality is so poor on some of the episodes that it is difficult to understand the dialogue.  There are no extras either.  I'd hoped for interviews with some of the cast who were not included in Season One - people like Leni Parker, Anita LaSelva, Robert Leeshock, Kari Matchett.  Not a one.  The only reason I gave this set a 3 is that the show deserves it even if the set doesn't.",1284336000,36,789,4.475524475524476
4124773,5,B003H9LIZ2,"(Warning: Contains E:FC Spoilers)

Don't be fooled by the box cover.  I don't know why they chose to have Kevin Kilner (William Boone) on the cover.  I guess maybe because Boone's fate was the cliffhanger of Season 1.  But rest assured, this is not some sort of ""alternate version"" of Season 1 that's repackaged as a misleading ""Season 2,"" as some fans had speculated, including myself.  Trust me, this is Season 2 for real, just as advertised.  The back of the box mentions Liam Kincaid, but shows pictures of Kilner (Boone).  Ironic, considering Boone is already ""dead"" by Season 2 and makes no appearances until Season 5.  So yes, the first episode of Season 2 is ""First Of Its Kind,"" Liam Kincaid being born.  The rest of the episodes of Season 2 follow.

A lot of E:FC fans were turned off when the series changed direction, when they killed off Kevin Kilner (Boone's) character, and brought Robert Leeshock (Liam) to replace him.  I for one, having had only seen a few episodes of Season 1, joined the series in Season 2, fell in love with it, then watched it to the end during its normal run on television, including the ""abysmal"" Season 5.  When Season 1 on DVD was finally released, of course I bought it to fill myself in on Boone's story.  I can see how a lot of people would be pissed off that they axed Kevin Kilner (Boone) from the series.  However, I must say that Liam Kincaid's story arc, of him being a ""man who's more than human,"" having Shaqarava in his palms (for Season 2 at least), having supposedly 75% Jaridian DNA, having precognitive powers, and his relationship with Augur, Lili, Doors, (as well as others introduced in Seasons 3 and 4) made for a good show.

I must say that E:FC would be nothing without the Liam Kincaid story arc.  He carried the series from Season 2 to Season 4, until his departure in Season 5.  He was so popular, he was brought back for the series finale.  Liam Kincaid, Ronald Sandoval, Da'an, and Zo'or.  These are the players to watch out for, the major movers and shakers whose interplays determine the future of Earth.  Liam's relationship with Da'an was the strongest in Season 2, and it was very entertaining to see him use powers such as the Shaqarava, which can, among other things, fire lethal blasts, revive recently slain allies, deflect Jaridian Replicant energy beams, expel Dark Matter (getting way ahead of myself there).  If you asked ten people who would win in a fight between Boone and Liam...perhaps you should watch and see for yourself, to judge Liam's powers.",1283126400,36,2535,4.626398210290827
4124774,5,B003H9LIZ2,What can I say that I haven't said in the preview for season 3 it's a great show anybody who's not watched the talion invasion of Earth thelies  the conniving Andy Andrews the aliens told to get what they wanted and all along showing that they were our friends too bad they no longer make the show or you could it's hard to find the show if you see this I am recommending of all Gene roddenberry's work by it today,1470700800,,414,4.111111111111111

4124782,3,B003H9LIZ2,"I shouldn't dock it a whole star for not having surround or captioning, but I'm gonna.. Otherwise, this was even better than season 1. The FX improved enough to be notable. The story ideas are interesting. It's a neat idea, and I enjoyed it when it was new. It's still fun, but in retrospect, I can see some limitations in the direction. Might be hard to go back to if you didn't watch this when it was actually on air.

Specific to the version I acquired: Kind of annoyed that this (Canadian release) version had no subtitles. Audio channel is kind of quiet relative to other DVDs/Blu Rays I have also. Neither of these are deal-breakers, but just be aware.",1441929600,,658,4.483333333333333
4124783,5,B003H9LIZ2,"This is the third and last time I'm rewriting this. First off, there is one Episode that is in Fullscreen (Say's so on the disk) but that's not an issue since we've had three seasons in Fullscreen; the rest of the Episodes are in Widescreen.

OK, so after three seasons of the Taelons kicking our butts in almost every Episode, finally we start getting revenge in Season 4. The problem is, I started to feel sorry for the Taelons. In any case, Season 4 feels very dark but in a good way. Even though many say that Season one is the best, Season four is now my favorite.

All the confusion about Sandoval and Liam's erratic behaviors are answered in Season four and the situation is finally coming to a head. I can't wait to see Season five. I mistakenly started watching Earth: Final Conflict and Andromeda at the same time so I'm gonna finish out my last two seasons of Andromeda and end my run with the last Season of Earth: Final Conflict.

I've pretty much run out of Sci-Fi at this point. I've seen all the Stargate, Lexx, Star trek,Sliders, Babylon 5, Terra Nova etc. I don't know what I am going to do without Sci-Fi as there isn't much of it anymore on TV. Suppose I'll start on Falling Sky's but there really isn't much left for me to watch. I'm in a bit of a Pickle.

To end this, you should get Season four as I doubt you'll be disappointed.",1440547200,,1352,4.311023622047244

4124806,3,B003H9LIZ2,Picture was fine on EFC S2 but the sound was ok at best with some words spoken softly and I was needing to rewind my DVD player to rehear the words again sometimes. I don't know if this was because of the editing done when the show was 1st made or if the sound and some words was a result of show being put on DVD but I recommend raising your volume on your TV to hear Earth Final Conflict Season 2 better like I did.,1370390400,,417,3.86046511627907
4124807,5,B003H9LIZ2,"I was one of the many fans who really liked this series. I want to purchase all of the episodes. I always thought that the talons were a little too effeminate for the series' success, but all in all, I understood what Gene Rodenberry was trying to get across to the audience, so the bisexual look of those aliens only enhanced the series for me. Leni, Anita and the rest of the characters were a blessing to watch. I hope to see a new version of this series. How 'bout it Eugene?",1369872000,,479,4.217391304347826

4124813,5,B003H9LIZ2,"Although none of the actors were familiar to me, they were superb.  The series concept was well-thought out and the sets and special effects were great.  Often, sci-fi movies/series can be cheesy with sub-standard music and dialogue, but it's easy to get caught up in and remain fascinated by this series.  What's really good is that since there are so many different plots going on in the series,the intro to each episode connects what's about to be shown with what has already transpired in that plot line.

As for the sound problems I luckily have a blu-ray player that can enhance voice levels and it works well on this DvD. See if your DvD or blu-ray player has this option as it might help with the low voice audio.",1350518400,7,340,3.927536231884058

video quality is good as well as sound esp for a tv show from this time frame. It is a shame that the original show was not show in hi-def but that would have been hard considering when it was shoot.  I'm not 100% sure but it does look as if the video was cleaned up for DVD.. All in all the only negatives i have for the DVD set is the lack of special features, which is probably because of the delay to DVD, and changing of studios.
