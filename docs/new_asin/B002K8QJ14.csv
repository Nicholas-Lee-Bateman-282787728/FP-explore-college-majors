8371763,5,B002K8QJ14,Bought for a last minute stocking stuffer for husband.  Very funny and looked for him on comedy central and haven't seen him!  Very hilarious stand up!,1381622400,,151,4.769230769230769
8371764,5,B002K8QJ14,Gerry Dee is hysterical! My husband and I love this stand-up comedy show DVD and we quote from it often.  We've watched it several times.,1354147200,,137,4.48
8371765,5,B002K8QJ14,"I've seen a lot of different specials on comedy central and I watched part of Gerry Dee's on TV; I was immediately hooked.  After purchasing the whole show I've come to the conclusion that Gerry Dee is one of the funniest comedians I have ever seen and I wish he would film another special.  I'm so glad I purchased his show digitally because now I can watch it on any computer and I do watch it multiple times.  Every once in a while I feel like laughing at some stand up and this is the best way to do it.  His act is clean, appropriate, full of truths about life and totally hilarious.  Would(and have)recommend(ed) this to anyone that likes stand up comedy. A++++",1336780800,2,667,4.346774193548387
8371766,5,B002K8QJ14,"We first saw this on Comedy Central and had it recorded on our DVR.  After upgrading to a new DVR system, we lost our recording.  Thankfully we were able to buy this from Amazon.  It doesn't matter how many times we've seen it, we still laugh every time.  It's my ""go to"" program for when I've had a bad day or when everything else on TV makes me crabby.",1321833600,,354,4.086956521739131
8371767,3,B002K8QJ14,I purchased the DVD in hopes of something really funny. Some of the DVD was really funny and other parts okay. Clean cut for all family members.,1293494400,,144,4.37037037037037
8371768,5,B002K8QJ14,"Gerry Dee cracked me up with his reality-based notes on life.  You can tell he has been a teacher, a waiter, and whatever, because his insights are on the money!  Great fun!",1280707200,,173,4.375
8371769,5,B002K8QJ14,We have been looking for this DVD and everywhere else it was selling for 60+!!!!  I knew Amazon would have a good deal and I wasn't wrong.  He is hilarious and relatively a clean comedian.  It's refreshing to know there are still comedians out there that can be funny without being offensive.,1254268800,2,292,4.576923076923077
