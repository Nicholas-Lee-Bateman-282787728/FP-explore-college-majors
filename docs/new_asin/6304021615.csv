758561,5,6304021615,"Battle Hymn is a story about Colonel Dean Hess (Rock Hudson), a pilot stationed in Korea. But this is a Douglas Sirk film, so you know there's a lot more to it than that, and things aren't always what they seem. The movie manages to combine a warm and endearing stroy with a hidden plot that will please all the Sirk fans.
There's a moving death scene that rivals Greta Garbo and Robert Taylor in Camille for most romantic of all time. And this is man to man, not your convential sort of deal, by no means. Rock Hudson looked so at home running his fingers through the sergeant's hair and whispering comforting words about ""the abundant light"". Talk about swoon-worthy!
Battle Hymn can be summed up perfectly with this quote from the film: ""Perhaps, through the agony of war, I have finally done what I was never before able to do. In reaching beyond myself, I have found myself."" The quote signifies many things on many levels, and can be equally as disturbing as it is inspiring. You'll have to watch the movie to find out what it all means for yourself. Oh yeah, and it also helps if you know about Douglas Sirk and what his objectives were when making a movie. Then it will all become clear. Such genius. Such revelations.",968371200,3,1226,4.477678571428571
758562,5,6304021615,"Being a service man myself. I can only say, speechless.  They just don't make movies like this any more.  Or is it that they don't make men like this who we can write books about or even make movies about.  Alas, this is  not true.  The US Military still has the same quality of personnel, as  yesteryear.  Roughnecks along with the folks who just don't know any  better.  Just like the Sgt in the movie, the one thing that counts is that  his hart is in the right place.  Anyhow, it's a very patriotic movie that  will touch anyone who has served, was a spouse, or a dependant of the  military.  A must see flick.  THANK YOU COL HESS!

Rock Hudson did an amazing job portraying this in the film based on actual events.  You have a clear understanding as to why his life took the course that it did throughout the film.

Another important element of this movie that stood out for me is that all the fighter pilots were of equal value, as if skin color didn't exist. That was very impressive & very refreshing to see and yet this is a film made in 1957.

The opening credits thank the US Airforce, Army, Texas and Arizona Air National Guards. A General talks about the war in Korea and the actual P-51 flown by Colonel Dean Hess from West Hampton Ohio. Hess was a minister there. We see a scene from WW II where a mistake results in a bomb hitting an orphanage and killing children. Hess rejoins the Air Force. We learn about his family history. Hess is now in Seoul Korea. He will train new pilots at an old air field. Hess makes changes to repair this base and make it more operational. Ten P-51s arrive for training. They celebrate Thanksgiving with turkeys. Hungry children scavenge for food. An observation plane sees a military target, a convoy of trucks. The P-51s fire on these targets. Then they attack a lone truck! ""War is full of accidents."" Winning is everything. ""You're grounded."" An enemy agent is shot and killed; she had a grenade.

The children are becoming a problem on the base. A Buddhist Temple is a refuge for children orphaned by the war. Colonel Hess will send more there. One Sergeant knows how to requisition supplies. ""Just chew, don't swallow it."" His men learn about Hess' past. Hess calls home about the news. The children are sprayed with DDT. There is an enemy attack! One P-51 is shot down. Hess evens the score. At night they learn for an enemy attack with tanks. Can they fly from a rain-soaked field? [P-51s could use a dirt field.] They drop bombs and rockets on the enemy. One pilot is wounded. ""There's nothing to be afraid of."" Hess is transferred. Will they see a better day? [Not if there is an enemy attack.] Can the children be evacuated in time? Hess tries to transport the children. The children walk along the highway. ""No luck."" There is a problem along the way. Five transport planes land on the dirt road to rescue the children. Its like a miracle. They arrive at the Cheju-Do orphanage. There is a happy ending.

This is a good story about saving the innocent victims of warfare. Did it appeal to an audience that wanted to see some good from the war? This era had many other movies that dealt with WW II in the Pacific and European battles without the outlook from earlier movies.",1331942400,,2203,4.572151898734178

""Battle Hymn""
(Universal Pictures, 1958)
-----------------------------------------------
Rock Hudson stars in this military melodrama as Dean Hess, a retired American pilot who became a priest after wrestling with his own violent actions in World War Two. He re-enlists for the Korean War and seeks redemption on the frontlines: but is he a man of peace, or a man of war? Don DeFore costars as Hess's rough-and-tumble second-in-command, who thinks Hess is too much of a sob sister -- will he still have what it takes when he has to pull the trigger? Predictable but fun, in a corny, old-fashioned way - nice cinematography, too! (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Movie Reviews)",1330732800,,713,5.5504587155963305

758776,3,6304021615,"""Battle Hymn"" is roughly based on an actual event -- the rescue of a bunch of orphans during the Korean War, who were saved from the advancing North Koreans when they were packed into U.S. cargo planes and flown to safety.
Rock Hudson is not given much of an opportunity to display his acting ability (of which he possessed more than he was given credit for during his lifetime), but he does a workmanlike job with the lines he's given.  He portrays an actual U.S. Air Force officer who was in civilian life a clergyman. Hess was involved in the famous ""Kiddy Car Airlift"" -- although, according to detractors, possibly not to the extent shown in the movie.

The story itself is rewarding and for die-hard Hudson fans who would be happy merely to watch him declaim the telephone book, it's probably worthwhile.",1271462400,4,810,4.6573426573426575
758824,4,6304021615,"When one thinks of the films directed by Douglas Sirk, the mind instantly recalls his series of lush, Technicolor-soaked melodramas (""All That Heaven Allows"", ""Magnificent Obsession"" and ""Written on the Wind"").  Often forgotten though are the two outstanding wartime dramas - ""A Time to Love and a Time to Die"", and BATTLE HYMN (1957)...

Based on a true story, Sirk regular Rock Hudson stars as Colonel Dean Hess, a former WW2 pilot traumatised after accidentally bombing a German orphanage.  In an effort to make amends, Hess becomes a minister but is still haunted by his wartime experiences.  When the Korean War breaks out, Hess enlists for a training camp in South Korea but soon finds an even greater purpose, assisting En Soon Yang (Anna Kashfi), a lovely half-Indian half-Korean woman, in caring for and housing over 400 homeless Korean orphans.

Robert Mitchum was originally slated to play the role of Hess, but his controversial 1949 drug-possessions charge--something which his reputation and career never quite recovered from--blackballed him from the project.  Martha Hyer, playing Mrs Hess, does a fine job, during a period when she was really riding high on a series of superior roles (which also included Barbara Lamont in ""The Best of Everything"", and Gwen French in ""Some Came Running"").  Aside from Hudson, the best performances come from Anna Kashfi as orphanage mistress Soon Yang, Dan Duryea as the comical Sergeant Herman, and Philip Ahn as Lun-Wa, an elderly drifter who is called into helping the orphans.

I'll probably always slightly prefer Sirk's underrated WW2 drama ""A Time to Love..."", but on it's merits this is a fantastic film.  Perfecly balancing breathtaking aerial battle scenes with the human drama of the orphans, BATTLE HYMN isn't your typical war movie, making it far more accessible for a wider audience bracket.  Even if war movies aren't your cup of tea, I guarantee you'll find the story completely fascinating.

The DVD is sadly virtually bare-bones except for the trailer.  Recommended.",1263254400,5,2036,5.173780487804878

758826,4,6304021615,"The producers wanted Robert Mitchum to play the leading role for this movie, but the real Dean Hess did not want someone who was convicted for marijuana use to portray him in the movie. So, Hudson got the part.  I found it a touching film that portrayed the early days of Korea.  The Mustangs had the correct markings and the aerial sequences are good.  The enemy Yaks were actually T-28 trainers.  War is filled with tragedy, and the killing of civilians in this movie brings that fact home.  It is an enjoyable '50's era war film about a war that seems almost forgotten today, which is unfortunate. The airlift rescue of the orphans gives a happy ending to the movie about a war that did not end the way Americans were accustom to.",1221955200,2,733,4.481203007518797

However, this war melodrama is not as good or entertaining as their previous collaborations, the grand-scale soap operas ""Magnificent Obsession"" and ""All That Heaven Allows"".  Probably because its based on the true story of a war hero, Sirk doesn't push genre conventions as he did on his better-known melodramas.  Still, Battle Hymn is a very good film, with more emphasis on human relationships, especially ""white male guilt"" (a favorite theme of Sirk), than war.  There is also the suggestion of interracial desire between Rock Hudson and Indian-born actress Anna Kashfi (who would become better known as Mrs. Marlon Brando), who plays a beautiful and noble foreign woman who helps Hudson take care of hundreds of orphans (while his white wife waits back home pregnant).  Her attraction for Hudson, of course, is very nobly repressed throughout the film.",1138406400,7,1076,5.196531791907514
758830,3,6304021615,"""Battle Hymn"" is the story of a minister (Rock Hudson) who returns to train Korean soldiers to fight after he feels he has lost his calling. Of course he finds redemption and his true faith when he becomes involved with a group of Korean orphans and a young Korean/Indian woman that cares for them. Despite several brilliantly staged action sequences this film is not so much a war saga as it is a tale of introspection and finding courage in religion to carry on.  The reason is simple; the film's director is Douglas Sirk - known for his soppy, sloppy and gushy melodramas that ooz treacle over substance,  like ""Imitation of Life"" and ""Written on the Wind"".  The blend of both adventure and drama is seamless. ""Battle Hymn"" is an intelligently-crafted and inspiring without being stoic or preachy.
THE TRANSFER: Overall the picture quality is nicely rendered but the ravages of time have not been kind in a few spots. Age related artifacts are present throughout - sometimes glaringly so. Black levels are often weak and fine detail is lost in the darkest scenes. Digital anomalies are not an issue for a generally smooth visual presentation. The audio is nicely presented - if somewhat dated.
EXTRAS: None.
BOTTOM LINE: ""Battle Hymn"" is finely wrought melodrama tinged with the prerequisite of combat that all war films have in common. The DVD is admirably realized but is not reference quality. Still, it's definitely worth a look.",1085443200,9,1436,4.877049180327869

He and his men become involved with a group of Korean orphans and a young Korean/Indian woman that cares for them.  While the war rages on, Hudson begins to find his way back to God, while also trying to protect the orphans.  I initially believed that this was a war-action film, only to be surprised that, although there are several good fighting sequences, this was a more personal story of finding faith.  Surprisingly, it meshes together well with the action.  Hudson is earnest in his portrayal of the real life colonel, and he is well supported by Dan Duryea as one of his men/sidekick.  There are some great lines about faith, and some of them made me think, especially the belief that God allows things to happen for reasons that may not be clear to us now, however bad they may seem at the time.  In light of what has gone on in the world lately, this is a comforting thought.

758832,4,6304021615,"A tribute to the essential benevolence of the US Army, and a justification of necessary warfare, 'Battle Hymn' was made with the full co-operation of the army (which allows for some spectacular airfights and picturesque bombings).  It is introduced by an endearingly stolid miltary mandarin, General Earle Partridge of the US Fifth Air Force, posing against the eloquent priapic might of a grounded bomber.  This is a propaganda film that shows the army as decent saviours of the world, protectors of the innocent; it displays the urgent need for heavy armaments and the engagement in warfare with totalitarian threats to that innocence.
The film is directed by Douglas Sirk, who has been for the last three decades the test case for the possibility within the monolithic global Hollywood industry of inserting a critical voice, of working within the system but producing films that go against the grain.  Sirk's major legacy is a series of Universal melodramas from the 1950s, in which he took a despised, 'female', corny, conservative genre, and created the most devastating critiques of 50s America we have, with its mindless and mind-destroying conformism, its patriarchal repressions, its racism.
the films, being 'women's pictures', naturally focus on the domestic, on the interior lives of socially imprisoned characters.  'Battle Hymn', on the other hand, is a war film, male-dominated and set in the wide-open desert spaces of Korea.  Nevertheless, Sirk finds a way to 'domesticate' this macho genre, with his feminised, camp soldiers; with his preponderance of cramped, interior shots.
there is a conscious opposition in this film that goes to the heart of the American 'problem' that would explode so traumatically in Vietnam.  In the 1950s, when this film was made, America was led by a grounded military man, fetishised the family, and encouraged socially adhesive religious values.  And yet Dean Hess, a  vicar, a man of god, a family man, cannot live in this America.  America is no longer fit for American men, primed by the Second World War, to live in.  His marriage is sterile - only when he leaves does his wife become pregnant, and does he find the possibility of family in the shape of the teacher and Chu.
In an America so brightly optimistic and confident as Eisenhower's, any trauma cannot be spoken publicly.  Any 'illness' must be taken outside and dealt with there.  Hence the profusion of US military activity in the 20th century, a doomed attempt to atone for guilt and failure, which only results in the mass murder of foreigners.
'Battle Hymn' is quite a provocative film, with a hero and his sidekick called Herrmann and Hess, with two graphic bombings by the army of an orphanage and of fleeing refugees.  The film is called 'Battle Hymn', and is an attempt to unite the conflicting US ideals of religion and militarism - Hess flails around wildly for the assurance that his murderous actions are not his fault, but part of God's will, sanctioning further brutalities.  He is often ironically compared to Christ, when he is actually a mixture of the antiChrist and Midas, killing everything he touches.  The only way he can save lives is to 'sacrifice' others.
'Battle Hymn' does not equate war with religion (a deus ex machina is epically ironic), but exposes the pathology of the army: the predominantly dull mise-en-scene matching the grey uniforms.  American military imperialism is mirrored in the attempts to Americanise the Korean children, teaching them to eat 'candy', swallow Christianity and sing English.  Any native rituals don't exist as examples of an alternative or older culture, but as theatrical expressions of Hess' moral progress.
the film also points to Sirk's great 'race' masterpiece of three years later, 'Imitation of life': in real America, segregation would have prevented Hess and Maples befriending one another.  Here, they are made equal in the army, united by baby-killing and its justification by God.",1002585600,10,3968,5.106646058732612
758833,4,6304021615,"Once again, Hollywood has taken a true story, changed or omitted facts and passed it off as the real thing.  Despite that, this is an inspiring and poignant movie and as another reviewer here said, this is the type of movie they don't make any more.
  The stoic Rock Hudson plays Colonel Dean E. Hess, a real life WW II fighter pilot who comes to Korea to train the first ROKAF pilots in American aircraft and tactics.  However, there are some glaring inconsistencies in this movie and what happened in real life to Dean Hess.
  For one thing, Hess already had a degree in theology and was in graduate school when he became an aviation cadet in the Air Corps during WW II.  He received his ordination and elected to return to the Air Force and make it his career postwar.  It was not as the result of Korea itself or any deep spiritual problem.  From what I read, when he bombed the orphanage or hospital in Germany during WW II, he did not have the problems portrayed in the movie.
  The Anna Kashfi character, En Soon Whang was an older women in her 50s and not a beautiful, half-Korean - half Indian teacher.  She was Korean and had lost two sons in WW II and in Korea.  She had already helped start and maintain an orphanage.  Then Major Hess helped out, along with many other Americans and the kiddy lift did happen.  But not like in the movie.
  This movie is inspiring because it does show the power of faith as well as Hess's value to a fellow pilot and long-term friend who he helps at the hour of his death.  That was perhaps one of the most powerful parts of the movie, because his friend, a typical fighter pilot, has no foundation on which to stand.  As he says to Hess, ""I realize I was afraid to live and now, I  don't know how to die.""  The minister in Hess the pilot finds his real calling, and pastors to his dying friend.  He makes the transition from this life to the next easier for his friend and the other pilot is able to die peacefully.  It is at that point that Dean Hess finds himself, by stepping outside himself.
  I saw this movie for the first time more than 25 years ago on television and was very taken with it.  It was at a time before I renewed my own faith.  Dean Hess's pastoral counseling to his dying friend had a big impact on me because I had an inordinate fear of death and dying.  His words had the effect of helping me conquer that fear and later, led me back to my own relationship with God.  Perhaps that is the real (but hidden value) of this movie.
  There is also another dimension to this movie that should be mentioned.  The aerial sequences are extremely well done.  Viewers who are fans of the North American P-51 Mustang will benefit from several scenes of combat flying that show the plane in its best light.  In this part of the movie, Hudson manages to convey the competence of Hess as a leader and pilot.  He is an excellent manager and teacher and his success training the ROKAF pilots is evident in later scenes.
  Finally, one of the things the movie doesn't point out is that Colonel Dean E. Hess remained in the Air Force after the Korean War and not as a chaplain.  He retired from active duty in 1971 as a full colonel and he spent the better part of his career as a fighter pilot.  He was a man of God to be sure, but he was also a pilot and that is where he made his largest contributions to the service.

7859018,5,6304021615,"well this review is as biased as they can get.  I bought this DVD because it's one of the few remaining feature films in which my Dad co-starred that I only had on VHS.  Besides that, it is one of the better films he was in.  And this was the film, while shooting, my oldest sister Penny would go with my Dad to the studio and entertain the Korean orphans and from that point on she vowed to go to Korea to volunteer at their orphanage.  My Dad and sister co-authored the book, ""With All My Love"" based on her experiences and letters written home.  To top all that off, my Dad had written a letter to then President Kennedy about her experiences.  He got a hand-written letter back from Jackie Kennedy thanking him and saying, ""Jack has been thinking about creating a government program that would allow thousands of people to volunteer overseas.""  This was around 1960, so the rest is history...and ironically, years later, one of my positions in the Reagan Administration was Director of Public Affairs for the Peace Corps.  I should note that Isaac Schwarts is a pseudonym, I'll now reveal my real name: Ron DeFore",1492646400,2,1117,4.55

7859020,5,6304021615,"I bought this because of the connection to WWII and the Korean War. It is an extraordinarily unique ""war movie."" Essentially it is a story of redemption, beautifully told. Rock Hudson plays a very damaged man who after having to dispose of a bomb which has become caught up, dangling as it were, from the wing of his P-51 while returning from a WWII mission. It ends up falling on and destroying an orphanage, killing several children. Unable to live with himself, he becomes a preacher after the war but, deciding he can make somehow make amends,  returns to war when the Korean conflict breaks out. He finally finds redemption and the story of how he does is heartwarming.",1478736000,2,674,4.663865546218488
