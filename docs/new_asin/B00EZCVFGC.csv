5958648,3,B00EZCVFGC,"Only with 4.44 will we know if it was truly worthwhile to diverge this much not only from the original series' plot but the plot of Rebuild up to here.

As it is the movie's pacing is overall very slow and dull with a spike at the beginning and towards the end. In between felt depressing just for the sake of having a depressing aesthetic -- that is to say the sadness looked pretty but meant little in the context of the films that preceded it. I understand it may be tricky to convey much when you shift the story so many years into the future, but it is almost as if that concern was ignored and they intentionally kept the pace at a snails crawl for most of the film.

Bottom line, if you are a fan of the story, I would say you are likely better off waiting till 4.44 before watching this. Personally, I still only have a copy of 1.11 due to my doubts after viewing this film. Otherwise, if you are more a fan of great animation this has all the top talent behind it.

For the sake of discussion, take a look at the original trailer for this film. Look exciting? Well, almost none of those clips are in this film. Also, to feed the Anno itch - if you haven't seen his film Ritual that should do'er. It even has a few spots of animation. Otherwise Kare-Kano is very good up to the point Anno quit (around episode 15 iirc).",1368057600,12,1327,4.155642023346304
5958649,5,B00EZCVFGC,"This is probably the most polarizing Evangelion output since the last two episodes that forced director Hideaki Anno to create The End of Evangelion. 14 years after 2.22 and the changes are jarring. The audience almost feels like Shinji, confused and troubled about basically destroying the world. And with 3.33, the bodies only stack up even more. It's dark and strange and alot of people were disappointed. Personally, it's my favorite Evangelion feature yet, and that's saying alot considering how much I love EoE and 2.22. A lot of people seemed to be confused: The Rebuild movies are NOT remakes. With 1.11, things start off pretty much exactly how they do in the original NGE series but by the time we get to 2.22, we began to see the diversions. It's almost like a different world but with a constant twinge of dreadful nostalgia. Some have even theorized that after Shinji rejects Human Instrumentality in EoE, he gives the world another chance to emerge from the LCL, the primoridial soup, and start over. And that's where 1.11 begins. This theory opens up even more questions but it also would explain why there are similarities as well as vast differences. It would also explain the subtitles of each Rebuild movie. You Are (Not) Alone, You Can (Not) Advance, You Can (Not) Redo. The ""(Not)""'s represent options for differences but also indicate the inevitability of some events. I hope I haven't caused more confusion. Anyway, 3.33 is a truly brave dive into the future and, whether people like it or not, it's pushed the envelope as far as anime goes. It casts a huge shadow and I hope 4.44 is just as amazing.",1367798400,104,1623,4.779359430604982
5958650,5,B00EZCVFGC,"I've only seen the preview for the movie with English subtitles, but I anticipate this to be every bit as good as the original series once it is released in English sub.",1366761600,,169,4.3125
5958651,5,B00EZCVFGC,"What's to be said about the ""Evangelion"" franchise that hasn't been already? It's a classic, it redefined what we expect from anime, and it set a standard that arguably no mecha anime has even come close to touching. But what a precarious position this puts the reboots in, then. Should we treat them as a separate entity, unrelated to the original franchise, and thus something new and fresh? If so, then Hideaki Anno's original 1996 classic and its brilliant follow-up, ""End of Evangelion"", have already been surpassed. With ""Evangelion: 3.0"", Gainax has bested itself and turned out one of the most groundbreaking, brilliant films ever created. Shocking, jarring, and powerful, it's a tour-de-force that simply cannot be ignored.

Picking up fourteen years after ""2.0"", the penultimate entry in the ""Rebuild"" series starts off with protagonist Shinji waking up from a mysterious coma. The world has essentially ended, the Third Impact NERV tried so desperately to prevent come and gone. However, all is not lost. Most of Shinji's old ""friends"" have reformed into an organization dedicated to destroying NERV, and preventing a Fourth Impact, which would harvest the souls of every living being on the planet. Torn between old alliances and his commitment to NERV, the young man holds the fate of the world in his hands, then fumbles it in a dramatic fashion. Will he come out triumphant, or will he return to cracking under the pressure like he historically has?

While there's a lot left out of the above summary (no spoilers here), I can assert that as a long-time franchise fan, this entry did not disappoint. It is the first complete divergence from the source material in the ""Rebuild"" series, and as such, it was the more decidedly risky project. After all, Gainax is tampering with characters we've known and loved for almost two decades. Thankfully, it pays off dramatically. These interpretations of the established cast are positively brilliant, and I daresay a vast improvement on their past depictions. Seeing hotheaded teenager Asuka as a somewhat haggard 28 year-old is fascinating, as is becoming acquainted with the conflicted and emotionally-scarred Misato, now the captain of a large flying battlecruiser.

The biggest improvement upon the original story, however, is the character of Kaworu. Originally around for an episode or two, and made a bigger deal by the yaoi community than he really was, the young man has officially become a fleshed-out character. He is no longer a one-dimensional deceptive pretty-boy; he is complicated, his intentions ambiguous, and his care for Shinji's wellbeing truly genuine. Unlike his original version, I seriously cared for him in ""3.0"", and what he goes through was seriously traumatizing to watch. Hats off to Gainax for this bold narrative decision. There are other characters who become more important, as well as the introduction of characters only mentioned in the first series, but I'll leave those as surprises for viewers.

Animation-wise, the film is dazzling, with artistry on-par with giants such as Studio Ghibli, and excellent usage of CGI that blend seamlessly with the 2D characters. The EVA units themselves look great, with more attention paid to their inner workings and mechanics than in previous entries. Special note should be paid to the climax, in which viewers are introduced to a new ""EVA Unit 13"", which is one of the most creative mechanical designs to ever grace the franchise. From action to simple scenes such as Shinji and Kaworu playing the piano, the operative word to describe the work put into this film is ""big."" Everything about the production values is larger-than-life, and it is truly one of the best usages of money ever sunk into a film.

Wrapping it all up is the exceptional soundtrack. Instead of playing it safe with established songs from the franchise like the past two entries, ""3.0"" decides to play with viewer's expectations. Aside from brilliant new compositions, the score sometimes starts off with the familiar strains of a famous piece of background music from the series, then blends it into an entirely different piece altogether. It really helps to establish this as its own individual thing, and it's nice to see even the composers embracing the fact that this is a new, experimental piece.

Everyone involved, really, should be commended. When compared the original series, this new interpretation and its predecessors improve upon it almost every aspect. When compared to most anime coming out these days, it is head-and-shoulders above the ""competition."" No matter which way you slice it, Gainax has crafted a new masterpiece. ""Evangelion 3.0"" is a powerful, thrilling and occasionally traumatizing thrill ride, and something every anime fan should experience. It has forever changed my standards for anime, and I know that it will be hard going back to other things being released in this day in age.

Ironic, really, that ""Evangelion"" has, in fact, become the new ""Evangelion"" for this generation...

5958652,3,B00EZCVFGC,"The DVD is great, picture, sound, subtitles, etc. Unfortunately, it's not the best of Evangelion. As much as I love the ideas in the Rebuild movies (and getting more Kaworu!), this one seemed really off the rails. I'm starting to think that after 4 comes out, I'm still going to like the original series, Death, Rebirth, and End more than the Rebuild  no matter how wacky and ungrounded the originals ended up being.",1507334400,3,416,4.698630136986301

5958657,2,B00EZCVFGC,"I couldn't get passed the middle of it. (Thank God I didn't waste 20 bucks on it!). The beginning had alot off action -too much happening really. Then the part where the viewer is supposed to feel as confused as Shinji (suspense and intrigue) was poorly executed! Then he plays piano and gets butterfly's in his tummy for his gay friend -thats supposed to be dead. None of this makes sense, but rather than cause me to feel more interested in solving the missing pieces, I just felt bored and upset. There's almost no display of bold concise aesthetic movements/emotional outbursts that made the original serious soo nice to watch. The overall feeling I got was hopelessness! The movie just felt hopeless and I had to just stop it right there in the middle. Few movies make me do that...I feel like rewatching the original series again.

My biggest issue with this movie is that some bits of dialogue are practically inaudible. As another reviewer stated you have to crank your volume up all the way to hear certain parts of the movie.

5958663,3,B00EZCVFGC,"This was a very frustrating movie. And I actually can't tell whether people who have watched the original series and EoE or people who haven't would be more confused by this movie. Subpar subtitles don't help. When they say things like ""Adams' vessel"" (as opposed to ""Adam's vessel""; note the placement of the apostrophe), it makes it sound like there's a guy named Bob Adams or something who will cause 4th impact.

I spent nearly the entire movie wanting to yell at baka Shinji. Seriously, when both your allies and your opponents are telling you not to do something, you shouldn't be surprised when things go south on you when you disregard everyone's advice.

Now, having said all that, it's still a fun and interesting movie in a lot of ways, so if you're thirsty for some Evangelion, it may be worth buying. And obviously it's a must-watch if you plan to see 3.0+1.0 if/when it comes out (supposedly August 2017, but I'll believe it when I see it happen).",1497657600,,961,4.647058823529412

5958673,2,B00EZCVFGC,"I give this two stars only for its overall production value. The writing of the movie is spectacularly bad. Much like some of the later episodes of the original series, it's chock-full of pretentious, self-aggrandizing pseudo-religious nonsense and slack-jawing, eye-rolling plot contrivances and dialogue.

If this was the ONLY problem, I would probably give it 3 or 4 stars, however, the single worst part of the movie is just how disjointed it feels from its predecessors, both in overall quality and in the way it continues the story. And no, I don't mean that they advanced the setting by 14 years. For starters, the supporting cast (especially Misato) behave completely out of character seemingly for nothing more than a deus ex machina to drive the plot forward. It reminds of the jarring shift between X2 and X3. Secondly, the new character Mari is completely subordinated and adds nothing to the overall plot, making one question why she was introduced to begin with. Numerous major reveals were laid out in a completely emotionless way with little to no build-up. The list goes on and on.

This movie is fairly different from the other movies and radically different from the series. Some people hate it. This movie introduces a whole lot of things without explaining anything, so that may be a turn-off for some people. I think this was purposely done so that we can feel how one of the main character's feels throughout the movie. It is hard to say how it compares to the rest of Evangelion. Once the fourth movie comes out and ties things together we will see. There is a decent bit of focus on Shinji and Kaworu in this, which may appeal to some people and not to others. I would definitely still recommend that you see this movie if you are a fan of the Evangelion series, just know that it is different and that you will have a lot of unanswered questions.",1484265600,,890,4.367469879518072

5958701,3,B00EZCVFGC,"Evangelion is....well, it is what it is. It is well known that it pushes boundaries in terms of what is acceptable in Anime, and it is littered with flaws. Aside from the usual confusing plot, poorly explained worldbuilding, the characterization for most returning characters is unclear and generally hostile to both the viewer and Shinji himself. Unlike previous films, essentially every scene involves Shinji in some way, also causing him to become somewhat of a Character Black Hole.

The art style is more gorish then before and reminscent of the End of Evangelion, though not completely there quite yet. It is stunning in its horrifying beauty

Now the crux of this review. Evangelion 3.33 is essentially a retelling of Episode 24 from the original series in a different scenario. What this means is that the only real character interaction in the entire hour and a half movie is between two young males. Roughly half a hour is spent just focusing on these two interacting with each other. It can be quite boring if your not into....well, it's a mainstream Yaoi Movie is what I'm trying to say here. Evangelion 3.33 is basically one of the first mainstream movies focused almost exclusively on Boy's Love, a kind of fantastical perception of homosexual love between two usually teenage males.

It can be difficult to watch, and honestly it is rather boring through most of the movie. If your not into the Yaoi Genre, it can be difficult to endure this. The Final Fight Sequence is acceptable, but again, due to lack of character interaction between the combatants not nearly as engaging as expected.

It is passable...but only barely. Watch only if your a Yaoi Fan or a Hardcore Evangelion Fan. This is NOT a movie that can be watched casually.",1480377600,7,1749,4.859060402684563

5958728,4,B00EZCVFGC,"It's kind of funny how wide the gamut of opinion runs on all of the Rebuild of Evangelion movies, but especially this one. A lot of people seem to come to exactly opposite conclusions about it. The nature of this film series is that you're going to have wildly differing reactions to it depending on whether you've seen the original TV series, and how deeply you dove into it. Because the films so far have barely scratched the surface.

I personally found the first film to be okay, and the second to be disappointing. The first was a basic retelling of about the first half of the story from the TV series, but missing some of its charm, while the second began to change things and really tried to pack way too much action into 2 hours. That left no room for character development (the new characters were utterly useless to the plot), while it ended where the TV series and ""End of Evangelion"" ended, but with two films still left in the pipeline! It actually made no sense whatsoever - nothing was explained in the slightest, and a bunch of weird stuff just ""happened"" out of nowhere. This was a case where knowing the TV series was both a help and a hindrance - without knowing the deeper plot from the series, you'd have had no idea what was really going on, and it'd have seemed like just a bunch of giant robots fighting because that's what giant robots do. On the other hand, this more superficial reading might have made more sense.

But I had no idea where they planned to go from there. There was no more plot left to borrow from the TV series!

The third film - this one - starts to sort of go back and explain what actually happened and where all this came from, while also introducing more new characters and changes to the overall plot. It's not a flashback - it's set after the events of Evangelion 2.22 - but there are long expository scenes about what really took place in 2.22 and before, and why. Some of the explanations seemed a lot more dramatic in the TV show, where we saw them happen rather than just being told in exposition, but at least the explanations are here. There's also a lot more character development - Asuka and Misato now have real deep-seeded anger towards Shinji, while Kaworu and Shinji develop a close relationship. Rei is, well, Rei, but like happened in the TV series, she's obviously not the Rei we knew in 2.22.

The series has also finally returned to touching on some deeper themes as the TV show did, although with only a couple hours to do it, it's not nearly as subtle about it. There's a fairly obvious men vs. women theme going on here - I can't give away more as it involves a ""shocking twist"". And Kaworu's and Shinji's relationship definitely has more of a gay subtext than the TV series did. The series had it too, but it was more of a ""are they...?"" thing - it seems a lot more obvious here. This is extremely subversive for mainstream anime in Japan, and while nothing explicit happens between them, Hideaki Anno seems to be pushing their relationship as far as he can without marking this a Yaoi anime. If you take both of these themes together, there's a definite exploration of gender and sexual identity issues in this film that looks a lot more intentional than it did in the TV series. (I would argue that this was one of the central themes of the TV series, with the whole Adam/Lilith thing and the women in the series being deceived by the men throughout the entire show, but those who wanted it to be just a giant robot anime probably didn't see it.)

And there's a lot more humor in this film than the previous two, which was one of my main disappointments with the earlier films. The TV series was funny! The dramatic parts were always balanced by the lightheartedness of the characters. That was missing from 1.11 and 2.22 - it's back here, with a bunch of ridiculous moments interspersed into the overall seriousness of the plot. I still miss beer-drinking, Daisy Dukes-wearing Misato - that Misato is *not* back - but Asuka's sarcasm has returned and Mari is her equal at it, and there are some new characters who provide some comic relief too.

For the most part, I feel like this film sort of puts the film series back on track. It still makes no sense to me in the context of the plot how there could even be a third film at all (again, this film would be post-""End of Evangelion"" in the original timeline), but I see what they're doing. Essentially the series *is* hitting all the same plot points as the TV show, just in a different order. It's almost like Hideaki Anno said ""what if the ending happened in the middle - how would all the characters react to that?"" And so far, at least, they're reacting as you would expect them to. That said, the entire Rebuild series is really confusing in a lot of ways; it's like a puzzle you need to put together. The TV show was sort of the same way, but the structure of the show made it easier to follow.

The more free-form structure of the films means a lot of stuff is happening that's not even necessarily explained within that particular film. And now that it seems a little clearer to me what Hideaki Anno is doing, there's still a lot more to go back and explain in the fourth film.",1467158400,2,5212,4.417273673257024

5958731,1,B00EZCVFGC,"Perhaps one of the most anticipated and then most disappointing movies I have ever seen. After the first two movies set up some great character development and was actually making Shinji into a like-able hero this movie really falls flat on its on its face in multiple categories.

- First and foremost the storyline makes no sense. All character development from the first two movies is literally thrown out the window. Shinji who was making great progression as a like-able character is now reduced to crying pile of emotions. There are many direct contradictions in the characters as well such as Misato who at the end of 2.22 was cheering shinji on to save Rei but now for whatever reason hates Shinji for what he did. The third impact has happened even though it was pretty clear that Kawrou stopped it at the end 2.22 when he speared Eva 01. Rei's story and character has been tossed out the window as well. A 30 second conversation between Shinji and Misato at the beginning of the movie would have rendered this whole episode obsolete but the script dictates that neither of them are smart enough to ask the most obvious questions.

- Animation quality has taken a big step back from where it was. In the previous two movies the animation style of the Eva's gave them a feeling of their bulk and weight being thrown around. They have moved onto to a different style of cell shaded graphics but the weight and feel of the eva's is completely gone. Their movements seem more robotic and have lost that heavy organic feel that they used to have. Action in this movie is very limited compared to the first two.

- Overall this movie was just a huge disappointment. The first two had set us on course for something truly spectacular and then this just brings us crashing back down in classic evangelion style. It may be worth watching for hardcore fans of the series but overall I would say this movie has put the final nail in coffin for this movie series.",1466208000,3,1960,4.578347578347579

5958734,5,B00EZCVFGC,"Evangelion 3.0 Q You Can (not) Redo the 3rd film In the tetralogy as directed by Hideaki Anno was from the start of the film a real kick to the heart. Everything that ended 2.0 has since been moved over for a 14 years later story that takes place In one of the more depressing futures to come about. That's the only piece of Information I'll give. But wow.. I loved Evangelion 2.0 but this.. this was like living the life of Shinji, feeling all those emotions coming at you all at once slowly questioning and finding out what happened after 2.0's events Is really heartbreaking. And just as Shinji did, you feel lost, confused & responsible.

I won't be dividing this review Into sections as I did the other two, because you can probably guess I loved every aspect of this film from beginning to end. So this review will be a tad shorter.. what I can say though Is Hideaki Anno Is one hell of a director, (even though he served as chief manager of the films) he took me and made me a fan of his series, one from nothing to everything. On a side note, I'm more than confident In his abilities to handle Godzilla.. hell I was confident just reading his bio when he was announced. But anyway, the 3 films have Impacted me greatly. As a movie watcher, a movie reviewer.. hell even as a person. While the series Is a sci-fi series with little grounded reality the films still managed to sink In and really display a message of a multitude of meanings. Quite the feat for an animated series on my end. Every minute of this film I was kept In stitches as to what was going to be discovered next, finding out what happened to Rei, finding out who this Kaworu Nagisa guy was (who had been teased at the end of both the 1.0 & 2.0 films) & most Importantly finding out what Shinji's father has been up to throughout all 3 of these films & when It Is revealed most of the questions asked throughout all the films Is answered and you're left with an answer that really shakes you, It really shook me I know that. The film as the other 2 handled the drama perfectly & while there was minimal action In this flick the opening and ending scenes were bursting with beautiful visuals and jaw dropping fights leading to the ""To Be Continued"" screen.
Which surprised me, It was stuck In my mind that there were only 3 films, but the term ""tetralogy"" never stuck as a term for ""4"". I didn't want to look too far Into the films to avoid spoiling them.

So, what are my hopes for Evangelion 3.0 + 1.0 ?
Well, I honestly just want Shinji to be happy, I want to see him come full circle as a character and truly grow and see life through to It's full abilities. Same for Rei, Asuka, Mari and the rest of the crew. They're all such likable characters It's hard to hope for anything but happiness for them. With the mixture of drama and action In there as well.

Evangelion 3.0 You Can (not) Redo Is a beautiful film, while I still favor 2.0 the most out of the 3 so far, I cannot deny the sheer awesome and beauty of 3.0 either. I give Evangelion 3.0 a 5/5 I loved every minute of It.. even when I was In the state of a horrible mixture of sadness and confusion.",1466035200,,3136,4.240802675585284

5958742,4,B00EZCVFGC,"As the third installment of the Rebuild Of Evangelion 4-part movie series, this chapter completely removes itself from the original Neon Genesis Evangelion storyline and catapults it into a totally alternate storyline. The established plot that the first two movies were adapted from is given a fresh take with a radically different look at the Eva world.

 Taking place 14 years after the end of the previous movie, the Third Impact was pre-empted with the arrival of Kaworu from the moon who impaled the awoken Unit 01 with the Lance of Longinus. Now, Asuka and her Eva partner, Mari(introduced in the last film), are retrieving Unit 01 containing Shinji. During this whole time, none of the Eva pilots have aged because of some side-effect. Shinji awakens to find that Unit 01 has been used as the prime engine for a new airship called Wunder operated by WILLE, a group of ex-NERV members dedicated to stopping SEELE's attempts to bring about the next impact. Misato is now captain of this ship, and places an explosive collar on Shinji that prevents him from ever piloting an Eva, but he's rescued by Rei in Unit 09. Shinji is taken to the remains of NERV headquarters which is only inhabited by his father Gendo, Prof. Fuyutsuki, and Kaworu. Gendo needs Shinji to co-pilot the new Unit 13 with Kaworu to retrieve the now two Lances of Longinus. Showing mistrust in his father's work after he learns that this Rei is really another clone of his dead mother, Shinji befriends Kaworu after he removes his collar and puts it on himself. The two operate Unit 13 two get the Lances from Central Dogma embedded in the remains of the 12th Angel that was stopped in Evangelion 2.0, and merge them with Unit 13. But Asuka and Mari interrupt their mission to stop a possible Fourth Impact. During the battle, all the Eva units are destroyed, and Kaworu gets his head blown off. This leaves Asuka, Shinji, and the ""replacement"" Rei to rendezvous with WILLE.

 As part of this Evangelion remake, the third chapter takes some serious risks in shaking up the status quo with the characters and situations. The downside though is that not much changes with most of the previous cast who were around during post-Third Impact, not including the fact that some of them didn't physically age at all, or were in stasis during that time. A lot of questions remained unanswered, which obviously leaves room open for in the final movie, but stuff like what happened to the other cast in the missing 14 years is left mostly unexplained(least of all what happened to Pen-Pen!). This movie does expand the characters a little more as far as their goals and their ability to adapt to the ever-changing world they live in, either always fighting for their beliefs or just struggling to stay alive. Since the series director and creator Hideaki Anno is now working on the new Japanese revival of Godzilla, its hard to say when exactly we can expect Evangelion 4.0 to wrap all this up, but hopefully it won't be left with as many question marks like the last Eva anime did.",1463961600,2,3047,4.7218045112781954

This is a review by someone who has never seen the original Evangelion anime series in it's entirety so that might also play a key role in this review. In my opinion this is a pretty good follow up to 1.11 and 2.22, this movies show's us first hand the after effects of shinji's actions in the ending of 2.22 inadvertently causing the near 3rd impact and all, he's been unconscious for 14 years and everything he knows and loves has been either killed or turned against him. Instead of watching Evangelion 3.33 it felt more akin to Eureka Seven particularly the flight scenes which was a good thing for me because I like Eureka Seven.

I was so incredibly angered by this movie that it took me 3 different attempts to finish it because I kept getting enraged by what I saw and needed to turn it off. This is NOT the Evangelion I was expecting. Sure, there were a few interesting ""improvements"" and ideas, but I can't help but feel, why fix what's not broken? The original FAR surpasses this feature, even with the older animation. There are some things you just can't replace. Evangelion's core plot, chilling details, and constantly intriguing/growing characters are just that. This retelling of the story, is a complete miss and changes far too much (in my opinion).
I just couldn't wrap my mind around why the creators would feel the need to completely reshape the characters (and add some new, random, overly sexualized character that doesn't fit into the timeline... still makes no sense to me), the plot, and quite frankly, everything everyone loved about the original has been changed. The best comparison I can give you ladies and gentlemen, is imagine that someone made a remix of your favorite song to the point that that piece of music is so redone that it is completely unrecognizable and has completely lost it's identity. Such a shame... and hence my frustrations.
So if you've seen the original series + the movies, read the manga, and want to see even MORE Evangleion (and watch a plot that has NOTHING to do with the original), by all means, purchase this set. But if you've read the series and want to relive your memories of the old anime series, this is NOT what you're looking for.

I purchased this DVD from Walmart a short while back when I saw it on the shelf. Being a fan of the franchise with the platinum box set of the series, I couldn't pass on it. While there are differences in how events unfolded and the development path (and names) of certain characters, it's very true to the original core elements of the story while adding in additional flare and more engagement leading to essentially an all new post-3rd impact event line. This film was so good I've ordered the blu-rays for the 1.11 and 2.22 installments so I can learn more about how this story plays out up until this lines 3rd impact. While you don't have to watch the first films or see the original TV series, I'd recommend one or the other before you pick this title up.",1458086400,,955,4.494252873563219
5958786,5,B00EZCVFGC,"It's been a long time waiting for this release but this time we can't blame Funimation for dragging it feet when it comes to the third Rebuild Evanglion film blu-rau.  Although they didn't help themselves by giving us lame excuses for the delay, all they had to say was that Anno and Khara were unhappy with the first draft of the English dub and decided to take their time getting it done.  But after seeing the finished product you have to wonder what all the fuss was about as there weren't any great changes from the first English subtitled release. I guess Funimation didn't want to piss Khara of and took one for the team by never blaming Khara because they were dragging their feet.

Funimation has given us a very nice package that comes with a slipcase and a large enough booklet that needs to be kept in the slip and not the case, it's not a first class like a Japanese release but it's very nice indeed.  What sucks is that it looks nothing like the first two releases (to be honest it does look a bit like 2.22 but not completely) so they don't look like they belong together when you put them on your shelf.  It's like Funimation is planning for us to double dip when the fourth film is released together with the first three in a box set which will look all very nice and even.  Cheeky bastards they are, you don't think?  You also have to be careful and get the first printing of the 3.33 blu-ray, because just like 1.11 and 2.22 when they sell out the set will resort to just plain package that might not even include the booklet which is what happened to 1.11.  Once again, cheeky bastards.

The transfer is acceptable but the audio is exceptional. Some people are upset at the volume level being low but there is a solution to this problem which I'm sure all normal people know what it is and I don't have to spell it out; but if I do abandon ye all hope.  What stands out with the audio is its separation, to some people it might be to much but it really brought me into the film so much more.

i am slightly disappointed by the lack of any significant extras; yes we do get a booklet, Rebuild featurette, and a million trailers but such a polarising film I expected more.  But this is nothing new when it comes to the majority of anime releases.

If I had to choose only one word to describe the film it would be - frustration. Frustration at wanting to know what the hell is going on.  When it's finally explained it lifted a weight of my shoulders and I really got into the movie.  A second viewing was even better.  Surprisingly a lot is explained so I have a hard time understanding people who hate the movie for being confusing and not following from 2.22.  It's all there, you don't need to be a genius to work it out.

Yes, it is a WTF movie but a good WTF.  It reminds me why I love anime and its uniqueness - just like the TV series.  This is a movie that needs multiple viewings to grasp all that's going on.  There is a lot of information presented all at the same time and it makes it harder to watch with subtitles when there are three people talking at once, then there is also the visual information that's presented .  This is where the dub helps.  Now, if I had a choice of only having one or the other I'll take the subtitle version, but we don't, and after watching an anime firstly with subtitles the remainder I will watch with an English dub.  Not going to turn this into sub v dub, but the reason why I enjoy dubs is that it lets me watch the show as the animator intended.  And that's all I'll say about that.

So don't be scared to watch the show and don't let the nay sayers convince you that it's a pretentious disaster, it's not - just listen, watch, and use those brain cells that you have been gifted with. It's all there.",1458086400,2,3772,4.240559440559441

This movie takes the foundation of the previous two, blows it to bits, and uses the crater as a landfill. Almost all character devolpment has been thrown aside, only implying (loosely) that things have progressed for everyone but Shinji.
The pacing is like watching tree sap flow and the storytelling is all in the subtext.

It just feels like a hollow set up for 3.0+1.0. The creators couldn't fill the space between 2 and 4 so this just tries in vein to fill the gap. Maybe the final film will add some context and make this better, but for now its just a bitter dissapointment.

Good stuff: The art direction looks great as usual, and the packaging is wonderful.

No really; Jeff H. does swear and drops ""F-bombs.""  It's just extremely very, very rare that he does.  Jeff H. is so well mannered.
And Jeff H. was totally justified for uttering one of his rare profanity laced comments.  ""Evangelion: 3.33"" is a totally WTF anime rebooting and/or reinvisioning of ""Evangelion"" but its totally, totally totally way off the established tennants of the Evangelion anime universe.

That being said, the movie is good. There is a pretty heavy shift in tone and direction from the previous movies, which some may find jarring, and this can be more or less considered not as a third film that can stand on its own as much as the ""Part 1"" of the finale. In fact I would say the biggest negative would be the fact that, unlike the previous two films which did leave at cliffhangers but also had relatively satisfying conclusions, this one does not.

This is the equivalent of letting George Lucas be in charge of the Star Wars prequels with nobody raining him in. None of the new concepts are explained and the movie drags on for what feels like hours with nothing to show for it. Rabid fan boys will love the usual fan service of their underage female characters that make appearances - but people who love Evangelion for its flawed character models will find no love for this movie.

Everything from the prior rebuild movies is completely thrown out, including any character development. Nothing about the new world is explained and what has happened to everyone is also not explained. Every question you have can be answered with, well, because reasons. This is not just a bad Evangelion movie and the all time lowest moment in Evangelions history (runner up goes to Evangelion 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance), it is a bad movie in general.

I can not explain my disappointment more, do not buy this. Acknowledge it did not happen and chalk it up to Fan Fiction. Crazy enough, without even reading any, I am sure there is better Evangelion Fan Fiction than this. Truly, it feels like poorly made Fan Fiction put into film form and money thrown at it.

Also, the story was all over the place. Too many things were introduced with poor character development and poor story telling overall. Shinji never grows emotionally; he's still the same nave and irritating character he was in the prior films ... it would've been good to see his character grow at least a little.

5958825,2,B00EZCVFGC,"I'm a big Evangelion fan. The prior movie, You Can (Not) Advance, was absolutely fantastic. This one left me very disappointed.

This movie doesn't have what makes Eva great. There is some action, but it's mostly nonsensical. It's STUFF HAPPENING! rather than any sort of choreographed drama. I don't feel the peril of the characters; I don't feel elation when they succeed or disappointment when they fail. It was simply emotionless. It also had a bit too much deus ex machina.

There is no character development. Shinji's level of idiocy is hard to believe, even by Shinji standards. As a character, he goes through the motions because the script says so, not because his decisions are consistent to his character. Asuka, one of the greatest characters in anime, is completely wasted. She, too, is run through the motions, but there is no dynamism, growth, or even worthwhile interactions with any other characters. She could have been anyone because her personality, her character, was absent. That's true of everyone else, too. Misato, Ritsuko, Mari (such a disappointment--I loved her character from the prior movie) were all placeholders--empty, bland, indistinguishable, irrelevant, and forgettable. Gone are all the insightful, fun, & awkward interactions between them. Even Gendo was not important. They tried to give Rei some depth & development, but it's weak. Kaworu is fleshed out, and that may be the only positive.

In the end, I don't care about any of them. I don't care if they live or die. I don't care if instrumentality occurs. The only one that even feels like a person is Kouzou. It's definitely a typical second act, and maybe that's why it doesn't work well.

5958833,1,B00EZCVFGC,"The audio was terrible. Throughout the first action sequence it is impossible to decipher half of what is being said. The rest of the movie's audio is a tale of near silent dialogue and deafening everything else. The music was mediocre leaving a lot to be desired (original series music was far better). The animation was of the same quality of the previous two films though Shinji's & Kaworu's face seem absurdly blank throughout their time in Unit 13. In addition the backgrounds seem blank compared to 1.11 & 2.22 and seems rough, this may have been on purpose. Closed captioning does not work on the Xbox One or PS3, not sure about other systems.
After watching 3.33 I had to go back and watch 1.11 & 2.22 (both excellent) to figure out what the hell was going on since the ""rebuild"" has deviated so significantly from the original series. The story line seems discombobulated and has fallen down the rabbit hole just as Episode 25 & 26 did. I prefer Episode 25 & 26 and The End of Evangelion over the self loathing drivel that has been produced in 3.33.

5958846,3,B00EZCVFGC,"I'm honestly not really sure why I'm even writing this. If you watched the first two films and cared at all, you're getting this. If you're like me and watched Evangelion during its original series coming to fruition, you'll watch it and...Well...Maybe not as fondly.

Look, a few key points out of the way.

First, watch the first two films if you haven't in a while, or you'll be completely lost from the get-go. There is no backtracking, nothing in the way of ""THE STORY THUS FAR"", nothing even close to that. Moreover, this story has almost nothing to do with the original, so thinking you'll be okay if you can recite the original's script isn't really good enough. It's its own thing.

Second, this isn't even really in the spirit of Evangelion, at least not the kind I'm used to, because it's in almost no way a character-driven story. In fact, there's virtually no character development at all, or even any scenes that have character development. Everything is kept vague to an overdriven maximum, particularly when it comes to motivation and emotional development. It's just not there.

Third, and this is to both put your mind at ease and enforce your assumptions, this is one big Kaworu showcase. Some have said there are homosexual overtones between the two, and those people are wrong. There aren't. At all. There never have been, unless you're destructively ignorant when it comes to what Kaworu represents (by the creator's words, if you need them). It's 100% ""Shinji makes a friend who actually seems to overtly care about him, and is able to show it"", which is essentially the same theme the television series had. Arguably even less so because the TV series had a bath scene that isn't comparable to anything here. Seriously, it'd annoy me to death if they went the fangirl-service route, and they didn't, they resisted that and kept the integrity of their relationship at its core, so I'm glad about that.

Fourth, this film is to Evangelion as Man of Steel is to the original Superman comics. Or Chrono Cross is to Chrono Trigger. Or Master of Orion 3 is to Master of Orion 2. Okay, I spent a good three minutes trying to think of good examples, and that's the best I can do, but the point is it's super-different in virtually every way that means anything to anyone, even if it technically has the same universe involved. I mean, you know, with some liberties, of course.

Going with that, I'd still recommend seeing it, if you really want a recommendation, but with a lot of trepidation and a freaking massive amount of caution in your expectations. The fact is, they won't match. Whatever you wanted to happen in 3.33, it almost certainly does not. Whatever you wanted to see more of in 3.33, it almost certainly does not happen; or if it actually does, is not presented in a way that you wanted.

It's pretty, it's got some cool scenes, and it's worth at least a view, but the fact is that it feels like dead filler between 2.22 and whenever 4.44 happens. When you almost completely lack character development like this, you're really taking away from what makes Evangelion cool to begin with. And, naturally, if you do take the characters away (or at least, almost all of them in favor of a couple), you'd sure as hell better make what's on the screen worth the sacrifice.

And, well, no, that sacrifice doesn't feel worth it. It's Evangelion in image, for the most part. Not so much in spirit. Or creativity, for that matter.

And, perhaps most importantly, it's not as good as 1.0 or 2.0. Not even close. Something just went wrong here that didn't really happen in 1.0 or 2.0, primarily in the way of story and presentation, but you could take that to many levels.

I already am sad that I didn't see more of Touji's sister, because I thought she was going to...Get more of a chance, I guess, to be a character. For someone who is presented as important at first...I mean, the whole film feels like that, really. In short, it's ""Here's the characters. Now watch as we don't do a thing with almost any of them. Now, here's some more Kaworu and Shinji, sans substance.""",1454544000,5,4094,4.626721763085399
5958847,5,B00EZCVFGC,"Fantastic as usual.. No wonder Studio Ghilbi hired Anno to replace Miyazaki.

The movie itself was great though I had a few issues with it. The action and animation are beautiful as could be expected. The story has completely diverged from the anime at this point, which for me makes things more interesting. My main issue is that it feels incomplete without the next movie. 1.11 and 2.22 were satisfying experiences by themselves, after seeing them I was content with waiting for the next movie. With 3.33 I feel like I need to see 4.44 to get that satisfaction, and who knows how many years it's going to be till I get that. To be more specific, 3.33 just makes everything so much more confusing, I'm sure I'll make sense of it and appreciate it when 4.44 comes out, but for now it just feels really unresolved. The other thing is that Shinji is at an all time low, usually I'm okay with his tantrums because I feel like they are very realistic for someone in his situation, but in 3.33 Shinji is, as Asuka puts it, just a brat. I was waiting the whole movie for his moment of redemption but it just never came, and he was given opportunities too. Again I assume that moment will come in 4.44 but until then I'm just left unsatisfied.

So final verdict: Good movie, but we need 4.44 now!",1454544000,7,1462,4.274368231046932

5958852,4,B00EZCVFGC,"Overall, it was good. Yet, I would rate both 1.11 and 2.22 as five stars, those movies are absolute gold.

We have waited a long time for the English release of 3.33, and I can't help but feel underwhelmed. There were plenty of great things in this movie, but there were also just as many things that leaving you asking questions and wanting more. Without spoiling anything I just like to hit on a couple of them. First off, the starting scene with Asuka and Mari really feels like some tacked-on, pointless action scene that has nothing to do with anything in the movie going forward. Another glaring item that left me underwhelmed was the end. I've seen some reviews call this a cliff hanger, I think it is nothing of the sort; it is literally just people walking away.

All in all, out of the 3 rebuild movies so far, this unfortunately takes 3rd place. It's a good movie, not as good as the two before it, but good none the less. Parts of 3.33 feel like they were rushed and simply lack the depth I have come to expect from the rebuild series.

I will be watching this several more times in the coming months and may update this review depending on how I feel after it sinks in (I just watched this last night for the first time)",1454457600,,1233,4.329004329004329
5958853,4,B00EZCVFGC,"First off let me express my sigh of relief for finally owning this movie in English. I have been patiently waiting for this release for the past 2 years. Now on with the review

The Rebuild of Evangelion series has been an interesting project for director Hideaki Anno. Since the release of 1.11 nearly a decade ago..fans of the original series have been scratching their heads wondering where this new re-telling will take us and for awhile we have seen many appreciated attempts of revitalizing the franchise; as well as a couple of missteps which might have tainted the series as a whole. In contrast to Evangelion 1.11 and 2.22, Evangelion 3.33 is comprised of a brand new plot that completely takes our beloved characters into a whole new direction. The movie takes place roughly 14 years after the events of the previous movie and shows the viewers all of the destruction and repercussions Shinji has left behind when he initiated the third impact from 2.22. This movie is much much darker in tone compared to 2.22 and I can honestly say that I believe this movie is an essential part of the entire rebuild series.

Shinji as a character in 3.33 has annoyingly reverted back to his whiny ""I don't know what to do"" persona we all know him for, even thought ir completely wastes the character development he had much  2.22. 14 years have passed and humanity ceases to exist. The original members of NERV besides Fuyutski and Gendo have disbanded and created their own organization, WILLE, whose purpose is to destroy the remainder of the EVA series created by the mysterious Seele. EVERYBODY shuns Shinji away, blaming him for all of the wrongs with the world at the moment and for the most part treat him like trash for the duration of the movie. The only person who willingly accepts and befriends Shinji is Kaworu, the mysterious boy from the previous movies. (If you know the series you know Kaworu's role in this movie). The premise and setting of this new movie is interesting, and I like that they attempted to finally stray away from the original storyline from Neon Genesis Evangelion. The animation is by far some of the best in all of anime and the sound design is top-notch as well.

While there is no denying this movie's technical achievements, the overall execution of the story left a lot to be desired. I can't help but feel a sense of emptiness after completing my first viewing and I was left with 100 more questions than I originally had at the end .22. First of all, this film is currently the shortest of the Rebuild movies running at a little more than 90 minutes. This movie could've easily benefited with at least a 2 hour running time. This movie relied too much on visual effects and less on exposition, especially in critical plots where the creators should've fleshed out the characters more. We get introduced to an entirely new roster of characters during the first 20 or so minutes of the film who have no back story and or known affiliations with the original characters, with the exception of one particular girl. Most importantly I felt this film merely skimmed through very very important plotlines inspired from the original series. At the end of the day, there was just A LOT of missed opportunities that it just annoys me to no end knowing this film could've been much more than what it is today.

Fortunately we have one more film left. I just hope that the last film is at least, AT LEAST 2 hours long and unequivocally wraps up the story of this tetralogy. There are just way too many unresolved questions this movie has opened up; although I am intrigued to know what the last movie has to offer. Hopefully we don't have to wait another 3-4 years from now just to see it.....In the end this is an enjoyable movie, but be prepared to be yearning for closure after you finish watching this :(",1454457600,6,3837,4.62848751835536

5958856,3,B00EZCVFGC,"Just bought this Blu-ray at my local Hastings today and am mildly impressed. First off this movie is actually only an hour and a half long (shorter than its two predecessors) and the movie itself is fact-paced. A lot of characters are introduced early in the film and don't reappear until toads the end. Overall, it is OKAY. It lacks the ""vibe"" I would say of the last two, instead of Shinji fighting angel after angel to protect the world he finds himself lost in a post-apocalyptic world that the himself helped to create (the film does a poor job of explaining that too). It ends with a respectable cliffhanger but makes one wonder what to expect in the finale, and if it's up to the task to complete the epicness that is Evangelion.

The second film is my favorite by far but I am happy that this third film is finally available for U.S. fans. I've waited well over 2 years and some have waited much longer. NONE of the preview scenes from Evangelion 2.22 are in this film and make me curious if Hideaki had something else planned entirely and moved to this or if thee intentionally screwed us.",1454371200,2,1098,4.462686567164179
5958857,5,B00EZCVFGC,"Things I thought about between my first viewing and my subsequent rewatch:

-Shinji is 14 (yes, he's existed for 28 years, but he's only been conscious, that we know of, for 14). His actions remain less mature than other characters. When he is presented with hope to ""redo"" the past, he wants it, and is blinded, even by pleas to stop. I don't think that's so unbelievable considering what he's facing: He knows he caused many deaths, including the likely destruction of his classmates. He's seen what happened to the world after his accidental awakening of Unit-01 in Evangelion 2.22. He wants desperately to gain back his support from Misato. I think his actions, even while you may be screaming at him to stop, are believable.
-Anno must have wanted us to be in Shinji's place throughout this film, as we lack information. Many people have complained about this in their reviews, but to truly be in Shinji's shoes as much as possible, we have to face the unknown without exposition. Sure, others could have provided it, but it is so obvious that the end of 2.22 (and what has happened in the last 14 years) has traumatized the survivors. Even Misato, who used to always say that the rescue of a pilot was the top priority, is quoted by Asuka as now thinking that completing the mission is more valuable than saving people. We're without any explanation until Kaworu and Fuyutski enlighten us somewhat. Some serious stuff happened, and the already unstable Shinji can't handle it. Ritsuko seems somewhat sympathetic at first, and Misato cannot bring herself to kill Shinji when she has the chance.

Overall, the film is gorgeous. There are scenes of intense beauty, even within the apocalyptic landscape of the virtually lifeless Earth. The battles continue the Rebuild tradition of being top notch, and we're treated to enhanced Eva forms and the animal-like new Beast Mode for Unit 02-Dash.

Kaworu and Shinji bond, much like they did in Episode 24 of the TV series, though with differences. Rei, or should I say ""Tentative Name: Ayanami Rei,"" goes from thought-free drone to stepping toward individuality. True, Shinji didn't save Rei in 2.22, and this is a clone (who knows what number, as 14 years and many unknown events have passed). These character moments make the darkness (and there is SO much) of this film slightly brighter.

I get that it's polarizing to fans, as they hoped the traumatized Wunder crew would tell Shinji more, but in keeping with NGE tradition, their personal wounds prevent them from doing what's right all the time. I love this movie, and I think it's a masterpiece of Evangelion, of storytelling, and of anime in general. A must-see, with 1.11 and 2.22.",1454371200,10,2689,4.839130434782609

At this pint I don't know when the final installment is set to release, but I will not be surprised if it is another few years before we get to see the conclusion of this reimagining of the Evangelion story. The production value is as high as the previous installments, but the story arc is not as self contained, it seems that the character of Shinji has reverted to the insecurity of 1:11 You Are {Not} Alone, and all the other characters seem to be in the same place we left them, with no real back story provided for the interim 14 years between this movie and the previous two.",1454371200,4,803,4.214285714285714

EDIT: Feb 9, 2016

Finally watched it last weekend. I found it to be pretty enjoyable, but I'm not the hardcore Eva fan I once was. The most noteworthy thing about it is that it's sort of like finally getting a full blown sequel to EoE. (Which is ironic considering none of the events of EoE are ever shown anywhere in Rebuild.) Rebuild 1.0 was a slight re-imaging of the first big chunk of the TV series, 2.0 was a jumping off point where they added some striking new elements that had nothing to do with the original TV version of the story, and now 3.0 is basically ""What happened after Third Impact,"" in an alternate reality in which apparently Third Impact wasn't entirely successful. I had a good time watching it, it was interesting. The worst thing I can say about it is that it features what may be the ugliest airship in the history of anime. I'm aware that a lot of Eva fans hated 3.0, and maybe someday I'll bother to find out what the consensus gripes were and see if I agree with any of them.",1454371200,,1591,4.31438127090301

So these movies are a reworking of the original series and movies. 3.33 takes some elements and then skews far from the original source. Shinji is still Shinji, just a pathetically messed up character. Asuka is still Asuka, badass that acts more than thinks. Kaworu has more depth and screen time.

This movie is a major departure from the first two, almost as if it's a fan-fiction storyline. I think everyone could see this coming after what happened in 2.22's finale... It's a love/hate feeling, because you're so intrigued by this new world you're thrown into, trying to piece the puzzle together, but there is no down time that satisfies the roaming mind, just more blurry and vague dialogue caked on.

Plot spoilers ahead:

Why go to the effort of recovering Shinji at the first just to put an explosive collar on him and tell him that he will be doing NOTHING? Lot or resources could have been saved just leaving him where he was.
When the guy that tells you what has to be done and why starts saying ""This isn't right, no, wait, don't do this, something is wrong,"" why would you go ahead and do it anyway?
Why didn't that guy that told him something wasn't right use his dual-control capability to stop or at least interfere with Shinji doing it when he could have?

5958879,5,B00EZCVFGC,"They went a really absurd direction with the third film, but I liked it. It's quite different from the show, and I'm glad they did that. I'd rather have two different interpretations than a rehash of the original with updated visuals, so I'm interested to see where they take it with the final film.

As for this pre-order thing, you've probably heard by now that Studio Khara intervened and wanted to have direct input on the Western release (http://www.funimation.com/forum/faq.php?faq=faq_fun_general_1#faq_faq_funshows_13). Luckily I saw the English version when they had limited theater runs last year, and it was well done as usual. Honestly, I've never liked the fact that they went with Spike Spencer for Shinji. Although I think someone else would be better suited for the role, the rest of the cast is perfect. While I generally stick with the subbed version, both are quite good. So yeah, we're waiting forever on this thing, but if you're a real Eva fan, you'll have found a way to see this movie by now. I'll happily wait for the official western release, especially considering how we will ultimately get a better product because of Khara's influence. Unfortunately that communication seems to be taking a terribly long time.

All that said, reviews should focus primarily on the product and the film itself, not the timeliness of the release. This certainly doesn't deserve low ratings just because we don't have the physical copy in hand right away, and there's no reason you shouldn't have seen this yet.",1434672000,8,1521,5.031746031746032

5958900,5,B00EZCVFGC,"As a relatively new Evangelion fan (I only discovered this anime a few years ago), and after watching all of the original anime, I am greatly enjoying this Rebuild series. 1.11 and 2.22 were very accurate when compared to the original series up until the end of 2.22. This, in my opinion, is where they struck gold for the second time in this franchise. I say this because the original series was excellent until End of Evangelion which made me furious, although I did understand the message Hideaki Anno was trying to express. The end of 2.22 starts a completely different story line which I believe will end in a much more satisfying way compared to End of Evangelion. I saw 3.33 on the big screen and was amazed by the beauty of the animation. As for the story line, there are many questions and concerns, but I am sure they will be answered in Evangelion: Final, we'll all just have to be patient. If you're a diehard Evangelion fan, like I am becoming, and even if you weren't a fan of 3.33 the first time you saw it, it is a must have for any anime collector. If you didn't like it and found the story to be like Swiss cheese with plenty of holes, I recommend reading as much as possible on the wikia page. I did and it helped me understand the very complex and intricate story behind the Evas, Angels, Nerv, and the many other objects, organizations, and characters of this series.

5958904,2,B00EZCVFGC,"I own the original series, EoE, 1.11, 2.22.  I will not own this one.  I may not even watch the 4th.  Granted I've only seen this once with no time in passive reflection/analysis, but this movie doesn't deserve it.  FYI, If you've seen the teaser after 2.22, nothing below really counts as spoilers.

The focus is on Shinji Ikari.  Other characters exist, but are sidelined to a point where no development or depth is possible.  Asuka exists, but only to shoot/hit things and call Shinji a brat (though both are easily the highlights of the whole movie).  Mari has a couple lines and hums a song in the beginning.  Misato gives orders during battles and is angry at Shinji.  That is the complete complexity allowed of 3.33 Misato.

So let's talk about Shinji.  I've had my issues with the angst-ridden adolescent throughout the series, but with his age, background and situation in mind it was more or less understandable (albeit still annoying).  He had his reasons and seemed to be growing in the Rebuild movies.  Unfortunately for all he's fallen completely off the wagon to the point of dangerous and psychotic stupidity.  I can't really rant completely without spoilers here, but I'll say that I found myself flipping off the movie screen with both hands and literally dropping my jaw at the decisions the writers have this kid make.  I mention his writers because at this point the character is so broken and terribly executed that it's hard see him as a character anymore.  If I did, I'd hate him.

So in closing, the only way they could have saved this movie was to have an intelligent and productive character like Misato or Asuka or Mari put a bullet through Shinji's brain matter.  It doesn't function anyway and would do better decorating a NERV headquarter's hallway.  Then we could all look forward to a 4th movie with screen time to spare for characters we like, or at least can understand to some degree.  And if I missed a valuable point or significance somewhere in the plot (that was difficult to type without quotation marks around it), if I don't care about the characters involved, none of it matters anyway.

P.S. I give it 2 stars because it looks good, and they only ruined Shinji.  The others were possibly saved by their relative absence.",1408406400,9,2265,4.707379134860051

i must pre-order

UPDATE: a source [very] close to the US / English / DVD dub process stated that as of late September the ""State of the Dub"" was acceptable to Anno-San [director / notorious perfectionist / creator of this ""rebuild""] so IN THEORY the toads at FuniMation [you now I love you guys... c'mon] SHOULD have the robots in a row for Christmas 2014 release, but they are REALLY cutting it close; as of now - 12.01.2014 - there is no release state stated anywhere and tho as ASIN [Amazon Sales Information Number?] has been assigned along with a UPC on FuniMation's site, without an ISBN it is doubtful that even the Amazon Overlords have a concrete date for ""discs in hand""...

ORIGINAL: The United States distributor of this title - Funimation - has repeatedly delayed the release; claiming Theatrical Demand [which is nonsense]. This is not / and can not be the US release - no way, no how.
This is a [Gainax / King Road at a guess] JAPANESE Domestic Market release [they are mostly ""No Region"", FWIU]; that's what ""fulfilled by"" means... Amazon is likely buying these in bulk from a seller IN JAPAN and then reselling them; at what degree of markup, who knows.

They'll never allow this to be published, but do the research and kudos to yo if you can 1) give 52.for what looks to be a SUPER continuation of this GREAT ""rebuild"" and 2) understand Japanese [lucky Weeabo, you]... just sayin'

5958911,4,B00EZCVFGC,"UPDATE 10/2015: The official release has been scheduled for early 2016.
------
Firstly, the official English-Language version with the Funimation dub has NOT yet been released.  It was supposed to be released early spring, but has been delayed for unknown reasons.  If you're wanting to buy something you can watch right now, proceed with caution.

I was fortunate enough to see it during the limited theatrical screening last winter, so my review is based on that.  Takeaway points:
-This is a major departure from the storyline we're familiar with from the previous Evangelion iterations.  There have been some previously (like the addition of Mari) but these changes are HUGE.  Whether major changes are good or not is up to the individual viewer.
-This is very Kaworu-centric.  For those who are fans of the Kaworu character, this is the movie they've been waiting for.  Otherwise, ""fawning gay Kaworu"" might annoy viewers.
-Along with that, we have Shinji psychology.  People had noted that in the earlier movies, Shinji held himself together better than he did in the series.  But here he does have his breakdowns.  Perhaps it was saved for this one because Kaworu is present.
-Lastly, the pacing is a lot slower.  This will probably disappoint viewers who enjoyed the action in the first movie, then the awesome action in the second, and had themselves hyped up for even more action in the third.  Considering that the four films are meant to comprise a story arc, it makes sense.  We had the setup (1.11) and initial challenges (2.22), then the calm before the storm (3.33), and presumably 4.44 will lead us to the climax and denouement.  This film really should be taken in the context of the whole.",1403568000,153,1708,4.902439024390244

1.11....awesome.
2.22....awesome.  Saw it in the theater.

3.33...garbage.  (Technically I'm talking about 3.0 as I saw it in the theater.)  If you'll recall the ""scenes from next time!"" at the end of 2.22...you'll see none of those scenes.  This movie is slow, obtuse, and has completely eclipsed Kojima for nonsense writing that is supposed to be ""brilliant"" or ""philosophical.""  Why do Japanese writers think that lots of words, exposition, and nonsense makes something mind-blowing?

No...adding words doesn't make something philosophical.  Pretending something is philosophical doesn't make it philosophical.  Clearly Hideki Anno lost track of what he was trying to do and instead went for psychobabble hoping that enough people would want to love Evangelion to make it a fitting entry.

I will see 4.0 in the theater because, well, I have to do so.  I'm compelled by my love for the series.

There are a few battle scenes in this film, but story has taken such a severe departure from the series that you have absolutely no sense of what is at stake. You know who won, but you don't know why it's important. This lack of explanation drives this chapter to be more akin to a Michael Bay film that you watch for the explosions and big flying things, and less like a fight for survival the remnants of humanity.

There is also some inexplicable fan-service that literally serves no purpose in this chapter, and the plot advancement seems very shallow. It's an uninspiring connection between the phenomenal 2.22 and whatever 4.44 turns out to be. If there is any depth to this chapter, we won't know about it for another year or two.

 This movie was just released on Fri Jan 10. in select theatres around the states. I went and saw it the only theatre in Utah that was showing it.
  Now, I consider the original series  and first two installments of the Eva rebuild Series one of the best groupings of anime ever produced. The first two 1.11 and 2.22 were works of anime Art. Epic in every sense of the word with 2.22 being the most beautiful and badass of them all. However... 3.33 was a Let down, which is hard for a die hard Eva fan like me to say.  I did not know what to expect from 3.33 as the original series ended after the third impact with ""The end of Evangelion""  Also amazing.  But 3.33 struck me as a Story that had no clear direction. The pacing was extremely slow and riddled with Character plots that were fragmented, nonsensical and outright needlessly confusing. Literally everything has changed since the 3rd impact but Absolutely nothing gets explained to anyone, and everyone hates everyone now. /sigh
  Everything in 1.1 and 2.2 that made them so great  was absent in 3.33.  No Epic battles showing off the grand scale and raw power of the Evas. ALMOST everything with the Evas felt miniaturized and Weak.  In fact the legendary Unit 1 only makes a 5 second appearance throughout the entire movie and not a complete appearance at that. you get to see one of its eyes as it destroys and Angel. Well, we assume its an angel as ""it's pattern is blue"" but you never get a good look at it, and what you do see looks like it was rendered using the Minecraft engine.
  Ahhh I am so Dissapointed its hard to put it in words. They Strayed too far from the Grandous Powerful Elements that made the others so great. I DID like the first 5 minutes of the movie and the story line with Kaworu and Shinji. Albeit they may have taken the Odd Kaworu ""maybe he's gay, maybe not"" idea to a new level but thats ok, just be prepared for it.  All in all a let down for me as you can tell. I gave it two stars for the first 5 minutes, Kaworu/Shinji story line and for the simple reason that I am hoping it is just a set up for 4.44 the ""Final"" that will make everything ok again. Go ahead and watch it, or buy it to complete the three that are out so far, but keep your expectations low and pray for Eva Redemption in 4.44.  Thanks.",1389571200,18,2342,4.252821670428894
5958927,4,B00EZCVFGC,"This review was originally published @ [...]

Allow me to preface this review with a very true, but opinionated,  statement. Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the greatest anime titles of all time. If you have been with Pixcelation for a while, youll recognize this opening statement from a previous article, where I also claimed that  Code Geass is on that list. Lets just say I have a long list of greats when  it comes to anime.

 This is why, when I discovered that the Alamo Drafthouse Vintage Park  location in Houston, TX was showing the title last night, I just had to  attend. Receiving press passes to the screening, I knew that it was going  to be a ratherimpactingnight, if you get the reference. So myself,  along with Pixcelations Video Technician Frankie Broussard, attended  the screening, and by the end of it, we were both able to laugh at how, over a decade after the original series release, the series still cant begin to make much sense in the slightest. Yet, thats not necessarily a bad thing.

ATTENTION: This review could perhaps contain spoilers for anyone who has not seen the Rebuild of Evangelion movie series. If you care about spoilers, Id recommend you go watch them right now and then come back and read this. Its okay, well wait. Not really.

The film starts 14 years following the ending of the second film, where Shinji Ikari single-handedly caused the Third Impact, which is a world-ending apocalypse scenario which pretty much obliterated the entire human race, excluding main characters. Nearly everyone in the main cast has changed in appearance or attitude, including Misatos more commandeering nature, Asukas missing eye, and Ritsukos REALLY short hair. Like, seriously, I went halfway into the film not knowing who she was until someone referred to her by name. Gendo Ikari, the epitome of adult angst, now sports a cyclops-like visor over his eyes instead of normal glasses. I guess its to emphasize the time-skip, but it wasn't that big of a deal in all honesty. Oh, and Shinji now has a collar around his neck that will explode if he ever awakens inside of an EVA ever again. Whatever that means.

Despite the time-skip, the EVA pilots all look the same as they did 14 years ago. Yet, not once do they truly explain why they do. The only thing that is said about it is that they have the curse of the EVAs and they left it at that. Literally, that term is never brought up again in the course of the film.

So, after Misato more or less gives Shinji a giant middle finger for causing the Third Impact (of which he wasn't even aware until half-way through the film, might I add), Rei Ayanami (or is it?) rescues him from Wille, which is the organization that was founded after NERV was disbanded by the government, and pretty much aims to destroy the remnants of NERV. Rei takes Shinji to the practically destroyed NERV base, where, in Evangelion fashion, Shinji has about 30 minutes of self-loathing over the destruction of the world, and it doesnt get any better when he meets Kaworu Nagisa, who tells him that he pretty much caused everyone on Earth to be killed.

Then, Gendo Ikaris assistant basically lays out the situation for Shinji, though even when they do that its still confusing as hell. Apparently, Shinjis mothers original name was Yui Ayanami, and (as most of us guessed) Rei is a replication of Yui, and there are a whole bunch of Rei clones, but were not entirely sure why. All we know is that Gendo wants to initiate the Human Instrumentality Project, which fans will remember as the horrifying, gruesome, depressing events of End of Evangelion. Or, if youve only seen the TV-series, youll recognize it as the final two episodes of introspection and ending with a big Congratulations.

After a bunch of painfully awkward fan-service moments involving Shinji and Kaworu, the final (?) battle begins. Kaworu tells Shinji that in order to restore the world to its former state, they need the lance of Longinus and the lance of Cassius, which are believed to be held in Central Dogma (which is never really explained, by the way), and so they board the Evangelion Unit 13, which is the first dual cockpit EVA, to go retrieve them. By this point, Kaworu has taken Shinjis collar for himself, shouldering the burden for him. How sweet of him.

Then, apparently Wille decides to crash the party, because as usual, they know something Shinji doesnt know, which Kaworu soon realizes, and tries to convince him not to grab the lances, because apparently they're not two separate lances, but rather the same lance, and pulling it out will start the Fourth Impact for some reason or another. So Shinji pulls them out, confident, and unbelievably ignorant, that hes saving the world. Then all hell breaks loose, which involves Asuka and Rei beating the crap out of each other in their EVAs, and when I say that, I really mean THEY START BITING EACH OTHERS HEADS OFF. Its pretty gruesome.

Finally, as could be expected, it is revealed that Kaworu is the 13th Angel, though he also claims that he was the 1st Angel as well. He stops the Fourth Impact by stabbing the Evangelion 13 with the spears, and then exploding (remember, he had the collar, and I guess he was awakening inside of an EVA). Shinji goes through another few minutes of self-loathing in a fetal position, and Asuka grabs him and takes him off into the distance, followed by Rei. The End.

ATTENTION: Spoilers end here.

So, there you have it. Yet again can I say that I am legitimately confused by the story of Evangelion. But as Frankie and myself both understood last night, true Evangelion fans WANT to make sense of it, because they feel like it will make them much smarter in comparison when they can look at their friends and say What? You didn't understand this? *Scoff* I TOTALLY got it! But in reality, we all tell ourselves that theyve got one more movie in the series, hopefully itll all make sense and mark off all of the confusing moments until we see the ending.

We would like to thank the Alamo Drafthouse at Vintage Park for providing us with press passes to the film, and encourage anyone in the area to check out their screenings. They are one of the only theaters that Ive ever heard of that shows specialty titles like Evangelion and other anime films. We would also like to thank FUNimation for delivering yet another exceptional English dub!

Evangelion 3.0: You Can (Not) Redo earns an 8.5/10 for its beautiful imagery and animation, but its story is severely lacking and unbelievably confusing. Then again, it IS Evangelion, so I don't know if it CAN make sense. I guess well find out when the fourth and final film in the Rebuild series releases.",1389571200,6,6690,4.689419795221843

5958931,5,B00EZCVFGC,"I borrowed the Japanese version from a friend last week and I absolutely fell in love with this film, so much that I had to pre-order this release from FUNimation for Feb 18, 2014. If you have seen Evangelion 2.22, it is worth noting that everything that appears in the ""PREVIEW"" of Evangelion 2.22 during the end *has none of those scenes reappearing in 3.33.*

Instead of the film taking off right after the events of 2.22 (when Shinji Ikari and Rei Ayanami are supposedly still in Unit 01 after getting plunged by the spear (which is shown in the preview of 3.33 at the end of 2.22), it is set 14 years into the future. Shinji is no longer the Shinji that shows backbone and strength from 1.11 and 2.22 (though if you see the movie, you'll understand why). Everyone's attitude toward him is different. Lots of questions the viewers have about a lot of scenes are left unanswered throughout the film.

(SPOILERS) Quick Summary:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This movie focuses on how the Third Impact has affected Shinji and everyone else both physically and emotionally over the course of 14 years. Shinji is responsible for the mass extinction of the entire planet, which is the plot. During the first half of the movie, he tries to discover why everyone's attitude is completely changed, until he is told that he is responsible for the Third Impact. Once he is told of everything that occurred when he tried to save Rei (which he failed to do as well) he goes into a state of depression. Kaworu (the person who was seen sitting on the EVA in space in 2.22), who becomes Shinji's only friend, convinces him that the two of them can fix everything that Shinji caused, which inevitably results with Shinji repeating the events of the Third Impact.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Animations done in the movie are much better than the previous titles. The music implemented in this film aren't as good as the previous titles, but still good, just more intense than before.

Overall, I loved this movie. I understand why people disliked this film. There was just so much change that altered the story so heavily. What I believe Hideaki Anno (writer and director) tried to do was to show how the Third Impact would affect everyone over time instead of instantaneously, which was why I loved it. However, this film will either be much stronger or much weaker, depending on how the 4th and final installment of the rebuild series turns out.",1385683200,5,2554,5.045023696682464
5958932,2,B00EZCVFGC,"How do you make a sequel to a series that basically ended in the apocalypse? Well, apparently you ""retell"" the entire story, move a few key plot points around, render the beautifully poetic message of the original finale moot and then go about explaining what exactly happened AFTER the world (sort of) ended.

You Can Not Redo is what became of the White family after Breaking Bad ended. It's what Holden Caulfield grew up to be after he quit sulking and just got a degree in business. It's completely, utterly pointless, and it may as well be fan fiction for all I care.

With the original (though somewhat reimagined) plot of Eva being successfully retold by the first two movies, 3.3 is essentially where the rehashing ends, and the full blown sequel begins. Granted this sequel is only applicable to the rebuild of the series, since ""remixing"" the original story arc and disregarding ""The End of Evangelion"" is necessary in order to keep things going, but for the most part the idea is the same: the world as we know it has ended, and humanity is once again left with the burden of forging ahead. It's here that we not only get a new version of what EXACTLY happened to the show's characters after 3rd impact (partially) occurred, but what became of the world itself. The ambiguity of the original conclusion has been replaced with a gigantic, meticulous mess that the viewer is left to watch get cleaned up.

So here we are. 3rd impact was a botched, poorly implemented apocalyptus interruptus that put the fate of the entire world in the hands of a seriously angsty 14 year old boy. We knew that. What we didn't know however was that Shinji's decision to pull Armageddon out of the oven when it was only halfway baked has resulted in a desolate shell of a planet that's even worse off than it was before. A place where most of NERV has defected to battle their former employer, Eva units act as airships, nobody likes Shinji and Asuka has an eye patch. Also this all occurs 15 years in the future. Cool? Cool.

Why exactly any of this needs to be told to us is beyond me, not so much because I don't like the plot of the sequel itself (which I don't), but because we simply don't NEED a sequel in the first place. At all. The entire point of the original series was to dissect what it means to find your place in the world when you have so much baggage you don't even know how to love yourself. It was a deep, mech driven self help exercise that also happened to be really fun to watch. And it ended on a pitch perfect note.

This, on the other hand...I don't even know what this is. It's an interesting ""what if"" at best, which I guess is more than I can say about the first two movies, but that doesn't change the fact that the whole thing is a convoluted waste of everyone's time.

All that said i'm giving 3.0 a star for the animation, since that aspect of the film is definitely well done, and with the impending release of 4.4 maybe Anno will finally be able to move on with his life life and do something new. I just hope we let him.",1385683200,18,3047,4.384070796460177

5958934,5,B00EZCVFGC,"Of the new evangelion movies that have been released, Eva 3.33 is by far the most provocative, revolutionary and complex. This new instalment courageously and completely deviates from the original plot, and the changes occurring in this movie are so daring and unexpected, that it will surely incite disappointment in the fans that expected something different. But for those, like me, who embrace a well executed apocalyptic vision, it comes to defy our notion of what evangelion is capable to do.
I really believe that Eva 3.33 is mostly about Shinji Ikari, in the sense that we are capable of identifying with his confusion and desperation. At the beginning of the movie, Shinji is awakened from a profound sleep that lasted 14 years and we see him trying to communicate with Misato(now captain) and with everyone that is currently under her command. Misato only answers his questions in a crude and dry manner and the rest of the crew ignore him as well, and when they actually look at him, it is with anger and resentment in their eyes. At this moment, Shinji can't understand why he is receiving this kind of cruel treatment. We sort of have an idea though, but we can still understand his utter confusion and anguish in that particular scenario. Also, while the movie progresses, we truly do care for him, and when he tries desperately to make things right  we can only hope that he actually vindicate himself to the world. I believe the movie succeeds in making us care about Shinji and, in my humble opinion, that is most important thing, because at the end, Shinji is the heart of this film.
Another aspect of this movie that most people seem to take for granted is the wonderful invention of the AAA Wunder. A miracle of engineering, the Wunder is a gigantic airship that uses the Eva Unit 01 as the main engine. And numerous screenings of this film will reveal how rich and detailed are the technical requirements necessary in order to make the AAA Wunder work. This is a delightful, imaginatively rich, and inventive fresh addition to the new eva series.
Maybe one of the reasons why I like this film so much has to do with the fact that I don't care about not having enough character development. Why should I? When I have already witnessed enough of it in the series where it has been taken to psychological extremes: the desperation, alienation, sexual frustration and in another note, the emotional pain that plagues the air at end of the original series and in the end of eva. Maybe many of the fans believe that the characters will have a different development, one that will be more gentle and agreeable. But I'll argue that this is not the strength and appeal of evangelion. If eva wants to inflict the same psychological impact, its characters must be flawed in their core and be traumatized by nightmarish events. Because, only the spiritually broken people deserve to inhabit this post-apocalyptic world.
Eva 3.33 gives us enmity, rivalry and hostility between their characters. Most of them are tired, bitter and angry(and with good reason). In this particular instalment, the negative emotions of its characters cast a different shadow",1385596800,4,3161,4.810661764705882
5958935,4,B00EZCVFGC,"Fourteen years have passed since Third Impact was unexpectedly thwarted, yet the Angels continue their attacks against mankind. Shinji Ikari is salvaged from Evangelion Unit-01 and finds that things have changed, but not for the better: the world has been utterly devastated, his former allies from NERV have become hostile toward him, and Rei Ayanami, the girl Shinji risked everything for, is nowhere to be found. As he attempts to adjust to this strange new world, Shinji befriends the enigmatic Kaworu Nagisa. Together the pair learns the terrible truths behind the Angels, NERV, and the Evangelions. With only Kaworu to support him and the entire world against him, Shinji must now fight to bring balance to the world around him.

Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo is a film about personal redemption. It is a film that is centered on the element of understanding one's own past wrongdoings and being able to confront those wrongs in an attempt to free oneself from the past. It is a film about honestly taking a step towards understanding the world around you and how one's past actions can greatly affect those you care for. But it is also a film showcasing how one can easily fall back upon the same actions that led to those past transgressions in an attempt to address the problems they face in the present. It is also a film that delivers substantially more questions than answers.

For those accustomed to the universe of Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995), or are simply familiar with the previous two films in the Rebuild series, You Can (Not) Redo is a film that largely departs from such familiarity with considerable awareness. Unlike the television series, The End of Evangelion (1997), or Rebuild films released prior, You Can (Not) Redo presents a new take on the universe of Evangelion as a whole, inserting new elements within its narrative and expanding the scope of the series as whole. From the opening moments of the film, we are thrust into a foreign world in which we have absolutely no understanding of, with longtime fans and mere newcomers being equally as puzzled. We as viewers are similar to Shunji Ikari's current predicament--he awakens to a world unlike the one he left, with the people and places he once knew now changed, lost, or simply forgotten.

With such a premise, it would be a complete understatement to say that You Can (Not) Redo is a very, very dark and bleak film. It is also a slow and methodical viewing experience, particularly during the middle portion of the film, easing us as viewers into a world of increasing unfamiliarity. There is very little action throughout a majority the film as well, with most of it occupying the opening and concluding portions of the film. If the conclusion of Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance (2009) was just a glimpse of the chaos to come, then You Can (Not) Redo veers completely into the dark recesses of the Evangelion universe. The film is pretty much devoid of any of the humorous elements found in prior films in the series, especially as seen in You Can (Not) Advance, but then again, this film is loosely based upon the final episodes of the television series, which consisted highly upon the philosophical and introspective interactions of its characters. Gone are the days of innocence: no humorous verbal battles at school, cooking bouts in order to gain affection, or gratuitous fan service on part of the female cast. Here we find the characters less sympathetic and overall well adjusted to the dire nature of their existence, both as individuals and members of humanity. These characters have been through a quite lot while Shinji was gone--much of what remains unknown to us as viewers--but it is expressed through their approach towards Shinji and his surprising reappearance. Rather than be joyous at his return, they despise him, looking to him as a burden and the source to their unnecessarily elongated battle to save the world.

With this in mind, You Can (Not) Redo is a film that spends a majority of its time focused on the plight of Shinji Ikari. Like stated earlier, it is a film primarily dealing with the element of redemption, with Shinji being the one to question his role as an Eva pilot and how his own selfish actions led to the destruction of what he held most dear to him. The film spends much of its time within the sparse and isolated landscape of NERV's GeoFront, which was heavily damaged when Shinji initiated Third Impact in the conclusion of the previous film. Seemingly in a way to physically exemplify his atonement, it is in this barren, secluded environment where Shinji contemplates what he has done given the aftermath of Third Impact, witnessing firsthand the physical destruction brought about by own deeds. Like the previous film in which Shinji viewed the destructive onslaught and aftermath of the Angel Zuriel, here we find the tables have indeed turned.

But as so much attention is given towards Shinji's current predicament, many of the film's other characters do not fair too well in terms of being influential factors within the film's narrative. Given the rather significant departure from the traditional narrative structure brought about by the two previous films, the lack of character development is even more pronounced in You Can (Not) Redo than even those films. Previously key characters such as Misato, Gendo, Mari, Rei and Asuka are provided little to any time for actual development here, instead being delegated to estranged positions of affronting Shinji off at any available opportunity. Other characters are strangely absent from the film as well. This is certainly surprising to see, but it further establishes the bitter and cold world Shinji finds himself in, even if we want more from the characters we have all grown accustomed to through the prior films.

Unfortunately, the narrative of You Can (Not) Redo can't exactly be viewed in a similar vein. Given the time-leap of fourteen years, the narrative find itself in a perpetual state of catching up to inform the viewer as to what is actually going on, which is helpful, but writer and director Hideaki Anno also decides to throw in so many new plot elements that the end result will simply compound upon the confusion of the average viewer. It is not that the film is difficult to comprehend; it is rather the amount of information that one will need to decipher through to completely understand the entirety of it. Unlike the previous two films, You Can (Not) Redo is a film that will require more than one viewing in respect to the massive narrative scope that Anno presents, an audacious approach that one can imagine will make for a difficult and perplexing viewing experience for many out there.

This approach also does not alleviate the film from running into, shall we say, ""awkward moments,"" specifically on part of the viewing audience gaining some simple understanding as to what is actually going on. I use the term awkward here to signify several moments within the film where Shinji, by simply pursuing to ask more questions than he does, could resolve so much and avoid a ton of rather unnecessary expository sequences (an unfortunate approach that permeates most of the film). Simple inquiries such as repeatedly asking what transpired during the fourteen years when he was trapped in Eva-01, why is NERV deemed an enemy now, and how come a practically inoperable NERV headquarters can still function with little-to-no staff, would have been beneficial in more ways than one in explaining to us as viewers some fundamental elements of the plot. These and similar questions could have all been answered if Shinji would have just inquired more from the individuals he interacts with, instead leaving much of us in the dark for a remainder of the film. This aspect of the characterization of Shinji may have been warranted given his current perplexed state of mind in parallel to that of the viewers' own, but it does not necessarily help out in terms of having a more focused narrative. Also, looking intently at the character of Kaworu, an individual that has been continually promoted as a significant figurehead within the Rebuild film series, remains just as mysterious and allusive by the film's end as he did in the previous films. One would hope for him to finally develop more as a character here, but he doesn't appear as dynamic as a character as we would initially perceive him as, which doesn't necessarily help in establishing his role as a prominent individual within the Evangelion universe.

But characterization aside, the animation of the film remains a highlight. Like the actual narrative of the film itself, the visual quality of You Can (Not) Redo is also very dark as well, offering a stark contrast to the color palette of the previous films. Whether this is viewed in the decaying interiors of a destroyed GeoFront, to the elaborate and bizarre inner workings of Central Dogma, to the skyward battles of the Wunder, the look of the film is impeccably polished to say the least. There is also a brilliantly animated piano sequence that is shared between Kaworu and Shinji that is sure to appease piano enthusiasts and classical listeners alike. Out of all the films released thus far though, this film utilizes CGI the most, which may be a hit or miss with some viewers. Despite this approach though, Studio Khara is quite elaborate in their construction and detail of all the CGI sequences within the film, doing an overall wonderful job in regards to implementing them into the film. The opening space battle and final battle within Central Dogma are absolutely phenomenal displays of their technical prowess, continuing the tradition of being a studio that can truly deliver superb animation alongside an aesthetic experience.

Another striking element of the film is the music. Composer Shiro Sagisu, a man well known for his work on the Evangelion series as well as other popular anime series and films, delivers a fantastic score that is both unique and fitting given the awe-inspiring nature of You Can (Not) Redo. While the two previous films offered a reinterpreted range of music that stemmed mostly from the original television series alongside several compositions from past Anno-affiliated animated works, the score for You Can (Not) Redo consists of primarily new arrangements that nicely encapsulates the emotional mood of the film. With thunderous drums and powerful choruses, one can see that Sagisu truly surpasses himself here in terms of musical ability, delivering an astute reflection upon the grandiosity of the film itself.

Considering the substantial changes that are within You Can (Not) Redo, one cannot deny the impressive interpretation of the Evangelion universe that Anno has established with this film. While many of the characters don't receive as much development as one would hope, one can view this film as essentially all about Shinji coming to terms for his past transgressions. This approach will certainly alienate some viewers, perhaps even discourage them from fully enjoying the film, but it is an approach that provides a uniquely compelling outlook towards how we may cumulatively understand the series as a whole. While some viewers criticized Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone (2007) for appearing simply as a rehash of the original television series, one can predict that some viewers will criticize You Can (Not) Redo for quite the opposite reason--its interpretation of the original series is entirely too different. There is much material here to contemplate and debate though, which is something that Evangelion fans have a particular knack for. For better or worse, Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo remains a broodingly tragic, surreal, and emotional experience, even if its complexity may get the better of it at times. Let's hope that the final film will provide some answers to the numerous questions raised within this film, in turn offering adequate closure to one of the biggest anime film series in the last decade.",1385510400,7,12044,4.978638847491307
5958936,5,B00EZCVFGC,"FUNimation that is, who released Evangelion 1.11 & 2.22, and are scheduled to release 3.33 in February of 2014.
This however is a Malaysian release, Japanese audio with Malay, Chinese and English subtitles.  Furthermore, it's really the 3.0 theatrical cut--
Well, thing is, the FUNimation releases are a few minutes longer than their 1.0 and 2.0 theatrical counterparts, with some visual improvements, thus the double digits, each two discs; movie & special features.
This thing, almost twice the price of either of FUN's, is one disc, with no extras.
Why then do I five star love it?
Well, it's Evangelion; I got to see it early and it'll be interesting to compare it with the real 3.33 version; and did I mention it's Evangelion?
Or rather, the Rebuild of Evangelion, an intended four-part remake of the TV series (Neon Genesis/Shin Seiki Evangelion to give its full U.S./Japan titular due; shin seiki means new era, century, etc., the official transliteration being Gospel of a new Century); the fourth part (yet another new conclusion*) is slated for a 2015 release, in Japan that is, but given the erratic production history of this often troubled franchise I'm not holding my breath.
*Darn, I've again forced myself into a bit of a tangent--but s'all good, y'all.
The rushed and budget-restricted, not to mention annoyingly confusing two-episode conclusion of the TV series (I'll spare you the details) was a bitter disappointment to the production staff, particularly producer, writer and director Hideaki Anno, and worse, utterly despised by the series' many fans, who weren't shy about making their feelings known to Anno, et. al (when displeased Japanese anime fans tend to be worse than a pack of rabid Trekkies, as Leiji Matsumoto found out when he killed off most of the beloved Space Battleship Yamato cast in the second movie).
This resulted in two 2-part movies:
Death & Rebirth; Death is a clips condensation of series episodes 1 - 24 with new linking scenes, while Rebirth is about the first 3rd of the second film (a sort of bonus preview I suppose).
Originally to be titled Rebirth, the second film's two all-new parts, billed ep. 25 & 26, were intended to replace the series' final episodes with a more 'real world' (not mention more sane) conclusion.
Still unsatisfied, Anno decided that the only way to tell the 'real' story of Evangelion (essentially the Apocalypse rendered in SF terms and involving the heavy use of Christian, Shinto and other religious allusions and symbolism often too archaic or abstruse for the average viewer to 'get') was to start from scratch, thus the Rebuild, for which, to assure freshness, Anno chose to employ a whole new studio and staff (probably to the great relief of the originals).
And thus endth today's sermon; thank you, Brethren, and take care; I'm off to watch something simpler, like Satoshi Kon's Paranoia Agent (n'yuk, n'yuk!)",1385337600,6,2895,5.0062240663900415
5958937,5,B00EZCVFGC,"Music - The OST is great as always, just not as good as the previous installments. the intro is the amazing drum beat familiar drum intro  that I only know as EM20 =[ native to 2.22. The credits theme is Sakura Nagashi which was featured on the teaser trailer and will warrant sitting through the entire credits.

Animation - The animation is great, almost so much so it could carry the film alone; amazing CG in the beginning will have you hooked. Pacing and animation quality just droops in the middle though for heavy dialogue  in order to keep us viewers somewhat oriented on what the heck is going on.

Story - a truely dark, open-ended and tragic Mecha that lives up to the name ""Evangelion"". The a 14 yr gap between this and 2.22 along with progressively convoluted endings makes 3.33 a prime showcase of Anno's relentlessly confusing yet mesmorising storytelling. It also makes this film a true ""love it or hate it"" experience with questions left unanswered and no garauntee that they will be in the next film.

Characters - Kaurowu's deep devlopment and interaction with Shinji was a major plot line in the film, and its highlight; his sincerity brightens up the series to guide you through the dark and dismal story all the way to the end. I'm so glad Anno had a chance to rebuild his series, as Kaurowu deserved so much more screen time than he got in the original series.

Awe Factor - by far the most convoluted ending (and begining for that matter) so far in the rebuild, but more traditional to Anno's ""WTF"" story-telling. Almost every character is emotionally screwed up and is just an experience watching them and their turmoil.

SUB/DUB - The performances were all great in my opinion (still preferred Japanese ofc). I've had the chance to view the dubbed 3.33 premeir and meet Spike Spencer/Mike Mcfarland. Based simply on the fact he has been voicing Shinji for 15 years now, he does the job better than anyone else could; but you can tell (and he said it himself) voicing a 14 yr old conflicted, emotional, mentally unstable rejected introvert is no easy task and thus will always be a little grating on the ears. Aside from Shinji, you can tell the rest of the cast  were seasoned and very comfortable with their roles; Kaurowu excelled as a lead and new cast member. Actually kind of excited to own this dub.

DVD - I'll update as soon as I rip open this package.

Overall - 1.11 and 2.22 attracted as many new fans as possible with the classic ""flashy mech battles"" theme, only to be psyched out with 3.33, as Anno seemingly loves to do. Seasoned EVA fans will enjoy this visual/mental beating (in a spectacular new BD format at that), but those who hoped  the straightforward cast/plot and fast paced mech battles of 1.11 and 2.22 were going to last will be dissapointed.",1385337600,24,2796,4.616935483870968
5958938,5,B00EZCVFGC,"Evangelion 3.0, in my opinion, is the most enjoyable of the three rebuild movies so far in the four part movie series. I guess one reason is because it was a film I wasn't expecting. In the last two Rebuild movies, most fans of the original series, like myself, already knew what to expect as their stories unfolded. The first rebuild move 1.0 covers the first 6 episodes of the original T.V series. The second movie does seem to take a different direction in some parts of the story, but overall uses the same plot elements from the latter half of the T.V series to help tell its story. While the movie was good, it didn't seem to work as a film, since it was treated more live its T.V counterpart, and the pacing of the film seemed to be too fast as the director was trying to add too much information into the film, which failed to set an overall tone. Evangelion 3.0 however, sets a tone for its audience right away that is so effective and mesmerizing to the viewer where he or she cant look away from the screen for a second. *Warning: the rest of this review contains spoilers to the film's overall plot. If you want to avoid spoilers, try to avoid the rest of this review if you'd like. What I will tell you though is that if you are one of those people who prefer answers right away and value a lot of character interaction, this may not be the movie for you. This movie leaves you with a lot of questions for you to think about and to guess as to what happened in the story. Some of the behaviors of certain characters are also different that the viewer may not like due to the events that take place in the film, which needs to be addressed for those who hold some of the characters dear to them. So without further ado, here is the rest of the review...........

The story takes place 14 years after 3rd impact was avoided. Our main protagonist awakes inside a dark ship, where he finds his former guardian, Misato Katsuragi, as the captain of an anti-Nerv organization called Will-E. Their goal, as stated by Misato later in the movie, is to stop her former organization Nerv from preventing future Impacts from occurring. However what's so striking and captivating about the opening scene is how everyone seems to have a sense of hatred for Shinji. As he starts to ask questions about the past, he is treated with silence and looks of disgust from everyone on board. The environment feels as if Shinji is on the lowest level of Dante's hell itself. Was Shinji's desperate act of heroism to save Rei in the last film, the real reason as to why the whole world is wrecked beyond repair? Who knows?

After the battleship Wunder successfully defeats the angel in the ocean. Shinji is again treated like crap from everyone on board. Even Asuka, the one girl he seemed to care for, has an unknown grudge against him, as she attempts to punch him through a glass wall. Did Shinji's actions alsso seem to have a bad impact on her. Once again, who knows? The fact that we as an audience know so little about the past and the effects it had on the people around him, icrease our intrigue in the film, as we demand to know these answers. Later on, Shinji is rescued by the woman he believed he saved, Rei, and is taken back to the old ruins of Nerv. These ruins seem to be hell itself, as there is no lush of life, or anything inhabiting the old headquarters. They seem to be decaying in structure, and are stained in red. However one area of the ruins seems to be full of life, as it contains a boy, a piano, and a plant full of life.

Shinji quickly quickly befriends this boy known as Kaworu, as they bond by learning how to play the beautiful tune ""Ode to Joy"" Shinji also tries to talk to Rei, but seems to have no chance, as she doesn't remember anything about Shinji or what she did in the past. This leads to Shinji relying on Kaworu, as he appears to be his only chance at finding peace. However Kaworu cannot hide the truth of Shinji's past actions, as he shows Shinji the horrifying aftermath of the 3rd Impact he started. While Shinji does seem to be affected drastically by his actions. Kaworu later offers him the chance to redo the past by joining him in piloting an Eva.

The most tantalizing element of this movie is the lost hope and despair Shinji feels as he is revealed little by little about how much worse he has made the world. The tone is captured just right, and the pacing is just perfect as it lets the movie tell the story itself through Shinji's perspective. Add to that a great musical score composed by Shir Sagisu, along with great camerawork and lighting, this film is a fun and engaging experience for any fan that wants something different. While the film leaves many questions unanswered, it does help set up for an exciting fourth and final installment.",1385337600,8,4794,4.401352874859075
5958939,3,B00EZCVFGC,"Buyers should know that this is NOT the official English release. It's only in Japanese with (adequate) English subtitles. The audio isn't too bad, but the video quality is a bit poor. It gets pixel-ly In some scenes and almost comes off as boot-leg. I expected as much when I ordered it, but didn't care because I wanted Eva NOW. The official English release isn't due until early- to mid-2014, so unless you're like me and can't wait, and/or you don't mind dropping thirty-some dollars for a lower-quality, bare-minimum package, I recommend waiting till then.

As for the story, it took a dramatic departure from the series and is very much a new Evangelion. At its heart, it still remains a character-study and shows many of our beloved characters in a new light. Toss in the enormous amount of incredible (if not somewhat disturbing) imagery and the amazing soundtrack, and you have yourself some entertainment more than worthy enough for your time.",1384128000,5,953,4.882716049382716

Additionally, the radical difference in price between this and the rest of the 3.33/3.0 discs available should give you a clue to the nature of the product.  This is a disc distributed by a Malaysian company.

If those things scream certain phrases ""footpants,"" ""kneebelt,"" anything like that, then maybe this isn't the DVD for you.

This is a much quieter film that the second one but the animation here easily is the best of the three.  In terms of the story, here certain flaws in the series are dealt with as well as building up something brand new.  While, overall, the films feel like a Cliff Notes version of a legendary tale, it's still a good introduction to a classic.",1377561600,2,429,4.405063291139241
5958949,3,B00EZCVFGC,"1st off I won't warn anyone about the language thing as it is clearly states it. So regarding the film itself and the bonus stuff you get is pretty standard fare. The transfer is decent but the movie it's self seems like it was rushed, it's full of plot holes and to me very short and not as exciting as the previous 2 films. I'm a 3rd gen JA and I only buy Japanese releases for Japanese films etc as I collect them. So I can't compare them with western versions of the film but I assume their the same in clarity etc. I also don't buy imports off of Amazon US. I use Amazon JP or other direct from Jpn E-stores and or retail stores for my Japanese stuff. Too many fakes and stuff here in the US or they charge way too much.

I also collect firearms and would never buy serious things like optics Eotech and Aimpoint in fact some reps actually said Amazon was one of the tops in counterfeit Red dot sights and you would get no warranty etc. So like those type items on Amazon this goes for movies and music or anything for that matter. Too many fakes or counterfeits. So be ware people there already are bootleg
DVD's of this film for sale on here. Why Amazon doesn't clam down on these bogus sellers? I don't know but they should.

Anyway pardon the little detour but again this film is ok but I wish they would redo it and knowing these anime guys they love to do redo's as again it feels rushed, kinda short and I really hope the last film in the series is better than this one. Imho this one is the 1st bad apple in the series yet. This 3rd film feels like a rush job. So if your not a collector just get the standard version or wait for the US release as its kinda pricy here I got my copies (I always buy 2 if their collector sets) for $20 cheaper.",1376870400,3,1755,4.084057971014492
5958950,5,B00EZCVFGC,"First of all, and just in case more people need to know about it: THERE IS NO ENGLISH SUBTITLE OR AUDIO TRACK IN THIS EDITION. Meaning, Japanese language and Japanese subtitles, that's it. So if you're not fluent in Japanese and/or not a huge fan of the series, you might want to wait for the FUNimation release.

That being said, the movie in itself is eye candy to the maximum exponent. The story moves even more away from the original series (1.11 kept it together pretty well, and 2.22 already deviated a lot from the original), but it is a welcome change, especially considering that...

HUGE SPOILERS BELOW!!!!!!!!!

These movies seem to take place AFTER the events of The End of Evangelion, meaning that this is not a retelling of the original series but rather a proper sequel.

END OF SERIOUSLY HUGE SPOILERS!!!! KEEP READING!!!

Included in this edition is the Blu-Ray in the usual high quality box (wider than the two previous movies), the Blu-Ray with the movie, a CD with the soundtrack and a very nice 32-page artbook.

Still, before purchase please consider that this is for fans only, or for people with VERY fluent Japanese. If you're neither, wait for the US release.",1376352000,11,1185,4.728155339805825
5958951,4,B00EZCVFGC,"First, yes this version is obviously a bootleg of some sort.  That was the reason I purchased it because based on descriptions of the plot line for Evangelion 3.33 I wasn't ready to put down $75 on what seemed to be a poorly plotted installment of the series.  Sadly, I found that my poor expectations were realized.

I give this version 4 stars because this bootleg is a reasonable value for your money. It was $25 when I purchased it and the price has gone down since. The packaging and the disc are reasonably professionally done. Its features are VERY BASIC. It is Japanese w/ english subtitles.  The DVD menu only has 2 options: 1. Play Feature 2. Subtitles.  It should be noted that after I used the DVD menu option to set the subtitles I had to use the subtitle button on my remote to actually see them. (I was on a PS3)

*Warning Some minor spoilers*
However, watching the film validated my reason for buying a bootleg.  I was terribly disappointed in the plotline for 3.33 and I would have been VERY UNHAPPY if I had spent $75 for this episode.  The whole 14 years later idea seemed like a bad idea, but not impossible to pull off with good writing.  Unfortunately, they didn't meet the bar.  The storyline is actually 14 years after events which would be the equivalent of ""End of Evangelion"" in the reboot. We never got to see those events and the references to what happened are cryptic and sparse.  Actions in the plotline happen without explanation of any type of purpose which makes them seem random. There is no rationale given for rescuing Shinji from space given the situation. There appears to be little character development in Asuka's character given the 14 years that have elapsed. People who really ought to know better inexplicably treat Shinji in a manner which seems designed to produce the worst possible results even after they've gone to enormous lengths to rescue him.  No real attempt is made to explain the critical new political alignments in this new world. After a while it all becomes moot because events are no longer driven by rationality and instead they are driven by the demons of Shinji's tortured psyche.  We've all seen where that goes in the original series.

This episode was made less than comprehensible by bad writing.  If you intend to shift the entire world order then you need to make a reasonable and clear attempt to explain how we got from where we were in the last episode to where we are now. They failed in this effort.  After the end of this I still didn't understand what was going on and who the major players were. I could obviously do a lot of speculation with very little supporting basis, but that shouldn't be where the viewer is after a film.

If I had been rating this only based on the film and not the version I would have given it 3 stars. But like any other devotee of the series it was inevitable that I was going to buy this film so I am happier to have spent less money on it.  I can hope that the next installment gets better.

Thanks.. Hope this is helpful to someone.",1376006400,13,3045,4.493647912885662

It feels like this movie was rushed, and while the animation was spectacular in some scenes, the plot breaks apart into completely unexplained scene after scene, with cryptic dialog and mysterious new terminology appearing mid-sentence, likely to never be touched on again.

A lot of things happened and I'm not sure of what most of it was supposed to mean.  It feels like they let Anno get his hands too firmly on the reins again for this one.

The most frustrating part of this movie is that with a one minute exposition scene here and there, they could remove all confusion for the viewers and Shinji.  Instead...you get the movie here.  Its an OVA! These exist to make the fans happy revisiting familiar characters, themes and situations, and to clear up murky plot points for a feel-good experience.

8610810,2,B00EZCVFGC,"I'm so torn on this edition of the new Neon Gen movies. On the one hand the animation is great. Extremely high quality visuals with a really good frame rate. The movie looks gorgeous with vivid explosions and detailed desolate landscapes. The shots are all framed extremely well and the backgrounds are all vivid and highly detailed. The scene where Fuyutsuki is playing go with Shinji sends chills down my back every time I see it. Scenes like that are why I enjoyed 3.33, but there are problems everywhere. The animation may be awesome but the sound quality is trash. I literally would have to crank my system when people were talking only to be deafened by an explosion that was 20 times as loud as the dialogue. Seriously, who mixed and mastered this movie? The sound is only a minor gripe when compared to the story though. So much has been changed and not for the better. Like the fact that the Eva pilots stay 13 years old makes no sense and seems tacked on to explain away an inconvenient plot hole. Then there is the fact that literally 10 minutes into the movie a simple conversation with Shinji would have basically rendered the rest of the movie pointless. Instead he is thrown in prison, mistreated, and emotionally abused to the point that I can't even blame him for dipping out the first chance he gets. Then there's the rest of the movie which I'm sure made sense to somebody at some point in time, but to me it just comes across as a jumbled mess. Sure the original Neon Gen had a weirdly incomprehensible plot, but if this was an attempt to untangle it into something reasonable then wow did they fall flat on their faces. Finally there is the issue of the sequel which has been in production forever. I'm not convinced we'll get a fourth movie to tie everything together and as it stands its not worth recommending the movies because the story just never ends. Maybe its a curse on Neon Gen in general. I don't know. I strongly recommend the first two movies as a mix of nostalgia and exciting new story elements with amazing animation and great sound. This movie.... I dont't know. Maybe my opinion will change if the fourth movie ever comes out, but for now save your money.",1510617600,2,2195,4.517587939698492
8610811,2,B00EZCVFGC,......Ok seriously... I just can't with this movie. I'm a hardcore Eva fan and this movie hurts every part of my soul.,1509580800,,118,4.409090909090909
