7724814,3,B01DUTUSNQ,"Two directors  Paul Duddrudge who is responsible for the concept of the film (written for the screen by Paige Cameron) and Nigel Levy  are part of the problem of this slight film: if two men are directing a story about several dysfunctional mother/daughter relationships they could easily be the reason the film is so confusingly disjointed.

To write a review about the stories in this film would inevitably result in spoilers, if enough facts were strung together to make sense of this m&eacute;lange. About all that is safe to state is that the story is focused on a rock photographer Rigby Gray (Selma Blair) who is riding a career high when an unlikely and unexpected pregnancy forces her to turn her lens inward and see her relationship with her estranged mother with fresh eyes.  Through a series of photographs documenting motherhood in all its varieties, she considers what it means to be maternal.

Sounds interesting but what gets in the way is the lack of connection between the girls and their mothers  most were either abandoned at birth (or threatening to repeat that gesture with a D&C) or were lied to by their mother about their birth mother, or they're searching for a face to face with a child they haven't seen for years. And to say more would ruin what little suspense there is in what is termed a comedy (!).

At times frustrating, at times touching, the actors include (no spoilers here) Selma Blair, Susan Sarandon, Eva Amurri Martino, Christina Ricci, Sharon Stone, Courteney Cox, Mira Sorvino, Paul Wesley, Christopher Backus, Paul Adelstein, the very promising Luke Mitchell, Alexandra Daniels, Dave Baez, and many, many more.

Some good thoughts, here, but too dissociative to pull off a meaningful film. Grady Harp, August 16",1470960000,,1755,4.925423728813559

As for this movie, itself, it left much to be desired.  I thought with this kind of cast it would be better than average but I was disappointed to say the least.  I would not suggest a purchase unless you just want to waste money.  The viewing is probably best left to renting at one of the $1 a night kiosks.",1470441600,4,551,4.269230769230769
7724819,5,B01DUTUSNQ,Okay I thought this movie looked interesting based on the trailer but in reality it was much better than the trailer made it sound. It wasn't just about conflict but it was about healing and about different kinds of mothers both natural and adoptive mothers. It was a solid representation of what makes being a mother so special. I even got tearful a few times. Made me miss my mom. And now my kids are adults so I miss being the mom. It made me remember the fools old days when I was raising my own children. It was just a good movie with better than usual acting. I loved it!,1468281600,5,577,4.207207207207207
7724820,5,B01DUTUSNQ,"We were looking forward to a delightful film, given the cast and were not disappointed! Yes, not all is happily-ever-after, but such is life and this film depicts more reality than a farce like Mother's Day. But the relationships are very real and the writing and acting are finely honed. Please get a DVD for yourself and a friend - everyone should make sure to watch ""Mothers and Daughters""!",1466640000,3,393,4.7101449275362315
7724821,3,B01DUTUSNQ,"""If I'm gonna do this then I need to know what I'm really capable of."" Four stories of the relationships between mothers and daughters are explored in this movie. The stories involve deception, adoption, abortion, re-connection and of course love. This is a hard movie for me to review, mainly because I am a man, and a father. Not saying that I can't relate to this movie, or these stories, but because it had the feel of a Lifetime type movie and it just isn't my thing. This was better quality, and had a better cast than most of those type of movies but the overall idea and feel felt like it could have been on that channel. The acting is actually really good and everyone plays their part perfectly, which really adds to the emotion the movie is trying for. Even though the movie wasn't aimed toward me it wasn't bad, but a movie that women, mothers and daughters, will love a lot more than me I think. Overall, has the feel of a higher budget Lifetime movie that, for me at least, wasn't a hardship to watch. I give this a B.",1464998400,3,1032,4.324742268041237
7724822,2,B01DUTUSNQ,"Two similarly-themed movies with the title ""Mother's Day"" were racing to theaters at the same time, in hopes of capitalizing on the holiday for dear ol' Mom. The first and starriest was last week's awful and casually racist film by Garry Marshall, the third and hopefully final entry in his unholy series. The other, which features recognizable but less bankable stars, was forced into the bland title of ""Mothers and Daughters"", and also tells multiple interconnected stories about the joys and pains of motherhood. While it's certainly the classier of the two films, it's also so dry and forgettable that you'll be begging for anyone to say something offensive.

It's like somebody has some kind of personal vendetta against Moms with all the crappy movies being made about them. Directed by Paul Duddridge and Nigel Levy, Mothers and Daughters could have been plucked from the Lifetime Movie ""rejection"" pile. Each story is either wildly heavy-handed in its message, unbearably clich&eacute;d, or woefully unsatisfying. The cast is a collection of talented actresses you wish were in something much better. Selma Blair gets the centerpiece role as Rigby, a hip Manhattan photographer on the verge of a big career break shooting a famous rock star (""Agents of SHIELD""'s Luke Mitchell), until she discovers she's pregnant. D'oh! Decisions decisions! Does she have the baby, or get an abortion? Or does she enter into an awkward romance with her hot married doctor (Quinton Aaron), who seems to have no problem flirting with his patients?

Other stories are little more than extended vignettes, and as such don't go far beyond needs of the plot. Sharon Stone plays Nina, a titan of the fashion industry, who can't stand how her talented daughter Nina (Alexandra Daniels) is wasting her life as a waitress. Courteney Cox is Beth, who is forced to reveal a bombshell of a family secret to Becca (Christina Ricci) that threatens to destroy all of their lives; Mira Sorvino is Georgina, who has a new line of haute couture"" bras ready to launch, a supermodel boyfriend, and a secret connection to another character in the film. It's not hard to figure out who it is, honestly. Nothing is very complicated here. You'll spend most of the time wondering how there can be such an incredible lack of diversity in a multi-tiered film like this with such an expansive cast.

While most of these brief little stories hold little emotional depth, another shows the potential of what the film could have been. Susan Sarandon (who was just in the far superior maternal comedy The Meddler) and her real-life daughter Eva Amurri Martino bring real dramatic weight to the complicated relationship between a mother who is trying to get back in the life of her estranged daughter Gale who split when the family rejected her ambitious boyfriend. In one brilliant, contentious interaction (with Sarandon on FaceTime or something) everything the film has to say about the mother/daughter bond is captured, as Gale pleads for her mother's support while pushing her away at the same time. Who knows if Sarandon and Amurri were channeling some of their own past grievances but the authenticity of that brief squabble is the realest thing ""Mothers and Daughters"" has to offer.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mothers-and-Daughters/dp/B01F4L0FMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mothers and Daughters</a>",1463788800,3,3413,5.258715596330275

8756941,3,B01DUTUSNQ,"This is a story of the relationships of five mothers and daughters that are not perfect. They all live in the same apartment building and this is similar to the semi-anthology films that take the names of holidays and try to come across as something clever and with a heart warming message. This film is no different.

Rigby (Selma Blair) is a photographer who loves black and white so it always looks artsy. We don't see much of her mother. Georgina (Mira Sorvino) is a bra designer.  Gayle (Eva Amurri Martino) left her parents to help her man  Kevin ( Paul Wesley) follow his dream. Layla (Alexandra Daniels) is a designer who wants to do things on her own and not take a handout from her mom (Sharon Stone). And Rebecca (Christina Ricci) well....her relationship to her mother is just so messed, it is not believable, although I am sure someone will tell me it happened to them.

The problem with the film is that it tries too hard to create feel good situations by creating faux drama, it felt forced. We never get attached to the characters long enough to feel anything with them.",1480982400,,1086,4.553846153846154
