7840556,5,6303196187,"""Misa Criolla"" is an absolutely beautiful moving work of art that combines both classical and Latin American folk traditions, blending them into one solid ingredient that feeds and nurtures the soul.  Ariel Ramirez is truly an important contemporary composer of our time.  His beautiful music, coupled with Jose Carreras' mesmerizing vocals make this truly a magical, mesmerizing work of art that transcends the ages.  I highly recommend ""Misa Criolla"" to all who enjoy amazing music.",1008892800,2,484,5.426666666666667
