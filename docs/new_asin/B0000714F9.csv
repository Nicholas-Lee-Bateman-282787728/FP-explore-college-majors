1798577,4,B0000714F9,"Not the best of the ""all-Master"" season but notable for a couple of things.  It's the first off-world trip for the Doctor since his exile to Earth at the beginning of the Pertwee era and, therefore the first TARDIS ride for his companion Jo Grant.
It's also the first time we see the Doctor meet the Master in an alien setting. The tables are turned since the Doctor doesn't have the automatic authority of UNIT behind him and must try to convince the locals that the Master, who is impersonating a government official, is up to no good. To them the Master is the one with credibility and the Doctor is the one who seems dubious.

Like many six-parters it's stretched a bit thin in the middle but overall it's great fun.",1314576000,7,720,4.446969696969697
1798578,4,B0000714F9,"This is the Doctor's first time traveling in time and space since he was exiled to Earth by the Time Lords at the end of ""The War Games"". I was hoping this would be an epic space opera like ""Frontier in Space"". It wasn't, but instead we get a really good story about big business willing to do anything necessary to make a profit even if it means the murder of innocent colonists. Okay, so in real life big businesses don't murder people, but it does show how these greedy corporations are willing to go to great lengths to make money at the expense of other people. We've seen recently how they've ruined the economy and people's lives. So I can really connect with this story plus it's action-packed and adventurous too. One can't help feel though that the Master and the Doomsday Weapon are just secondary plots in the story when they should have been the main plot. After all, wasn't that the reason the Doctor left Earth in the first place?

THE PLOT:

The Time Lords discover that the Master has stolen secret files containing the location of the Doomsday Weapon and decide to temporarily release the Doctor from his exile on Earth so that he can deal with it. After making repairs to the TARDIS's dematerialization curcit, the Doctor decides to test it out. Jo, being her first trip in the TARDIS, is amazed on how it's bigger on the inside than the out, and still doesn't quite believe that it can travel in time and space. But before the Doctor can even operate the controls, the TARDIS dematerializes and he realizes that it is the Time Lords. They've sent him on a mission without his permission. Isn't that how it always goes?

Arriving on the planet Uxarieus, the Doctor and Jo are met with a group of starving colonists who are being driven from their homes by the evil Mining Corporation who want to mine all the vital minerals from the planet. The colonists refuse to be bullied, and after two deaths occur, they decide to fight back. The Doctor decides to help them while also trying to find the Master before he can unleash this Doomsday Weapon upon the universe.

Not the best Dr. Who, but still highly enjoyable. Highly recommended!",1267660800,,2152,4.567357512953368

1798580,3,B0000714F9,"The Doctor gets a reprieve from his exile on Earth, only to do the bidding of the Time Lords. Landing on a planet with Jo Grant, the Doctor gets involved with some colonist close to starvation . Meanwhile, IMC, the ruthless mining corporation from Earth, is trying to remove the colonist from the planet. A very early politically correct/socially aware Who serial. It's also very padded and dull, but still fun. There are some silly-looking natives throwing spears and stones and a mud-fight. Captain Dents's hair-style is way cool...NOT! Not really much to say about this one, but it is far more interesting until the obligatory appearance of the Master arrives. Still, it's got it's moments.

1798581,3,B0000714F9,"This story is typical of most 6-parters in Dr. Who, strong through the first 3 episodes but then dragged out as if it were really intended to be a four part story but they had to stretch it out.
As I have been collecting Dr. Who videos since the Mid. 90's, and I'm hoping the BBC will release the rest here by 2004, buying or not buying this video was not the question.
The biggest thing that stood out was the photocopied wall in the Doctor's TARDIS, which looked cheap.
Unless you're a collector like myself, I wouldn't recommened this one.",1043625600,4,542,4.376237623762377
1798582,4,B0000714F9,"The Master is at it again.  This time, he has stolen the file of the Doomsday Weapon from the Time Lords.  In order to deal with it, a small group of Time Lords, presumably the Celestial Intervention Agency later mentioned in the Deadly Assassin story, use the Doctor to deal with it.  The Doctor and Jo, who happen to be in the TARDIS testing out a new dematerialization circuit, get whisked off to Uxarius, on 3 March 2472.
They meet a group of colonists, headed by Robert Ashe, who are having such horrible luck, that ""unless things improve drastically, [their] colony is in grave danger of starving to death.""  Since their arrival a year ago, they planted subsistence crops in order to reclaim worn out soil, but the crops shoot up, wither, and then die.  They also live in an uneasy truce with the local race of Primitives, whom they give food, not helping their dwindling food supply.  Not only that, but two colonists are killed by giant lizards.  The Doctor and Jo promptly give their help as usual.
As if they didn't have enough troubles, a detachment from Interplanetary Mining Corporation, headed by the cold-hearted Captain Dent, arrive and claim mineral rights, in conflict with Ashe's claim that Uxarius was classified for colonization.  An Adjudicator is sent for, however, they normally favour IMC in disputes.  The hot-headed Winton, Ashe's deputy, favours an attack on IMC to drive them out, in contrast to the more diplomatically-minded Ashe.  On the side of the IMC, there's the mineralogist Caldwell, who begins to question some of IMC's methods of getting their bottom line.  The Adjudicator does come, and guess who it is?
Things heat up between the colonists and IMC, whose role in the colonists suffering may be connected.  Then there's Norton, a survivor from another colony attacked by giant lizards and Primitives, whose behaviour in Episode Two becomes definitely suspect.
Colony paints a grim picture of Earth back home, ""no room to move, polluted air, not a blade of grass, a government that locks you up if you think for yourself"", a place where people don't live like human beings but like battery hens in floating 300 story islands.  An unflattering picture is painted of corporations.  Dent says in true fascist, corporate style, ""What's good for IMC is good for Earth.""  As for the colonists, he doesn't care the least about their hardships.  All he cares is about the profits they'll make in gutting Uxarius of duralinium.  It's also an interesting look at the leadership styles and decision-making, Ashe, Winton, and Dent in particular, and why they either succeed or fail.
Other things:  Mary Ashe says that ""there's no animal life, just a few birds and insects.""  So, uh..., what exactly does that make birds and insects?  Apart from that, Helen Worth stands out as Mary, as does Nicholas Pennell (Winton), Bernard Kay (Caldwell), and John Ringham (Robert Ashe), who also appeared as the ruthless Tlotoxl in Who story The Aztecs and the no-longer available The Smugglers as Blake.  Another in-joke was a reference to how the Spanish ambassador was mistaken for the Master, as Roger Delgado (the Master) was himself half-Spanish, half-French.
Some padding is apparent throughout this six-parter, but it's a thoughtful story on the reaction against post-industrial urbanization (the colonists) and the ruthlessness of corporations (IMC).",1043452800,4,3375,5.023339317773788
1798583,3,B0000714F9,"Jo Grant (the Doctor's assistant) is taken on a trip in the TARDIS for the first time  (in a wonderful sequence that encourages the viewer feel her excitement).  The planet they arrive on is seriously drab though,  and once they've arrived, the story begins to ramble a little over the course of three hours.  (Amazon.com has already provided a tidy plot summary, so I won't detail it here.)  Even by DOCTOR WHO standards,  the effects and sets are amazingly cheap.  It's reccomended only to the serious enthusiast of  that peculiar genre of ""British Telefantasy"".  But the story is solid,  the characters are easy to get attached to,  and it won't insult your intelligence.  It's a diverting three hours or so,  even if it doesn't wind up being DOCTOR WHO at its best.",1042848000,9,769,4.734848484848484

Intrigue, murder, and deception abound while the Doctor and Jo uncover an awesome power buried deep within an ancient city...
Spoilers follow.  This Jon Pertwee story is not remembered for much beyond it being the first Third Doctor story where the character leaves Earth.  As a change of pace, 'Colony In Space' may have been refreshing when it first aired, but in comparison to other Doctor Who stories (most of them set on other worlds), there is not too much in this padded 6-parter that stands out.  The plot involving scheming mining officers and the bland colonists is insufficient to fill out over 2 hours of story, but a few actors, particularly those playing the chief miners, gamely put their all into their limited roles.  The plot gets more interesting once the ever-reliable Roger Delgado again shows up as the Master (posing as an Adjudicator), but only slightly.  The final storyline about the struggle to control an ancient doomsday weapon is cliched but necessary to give this story an extra bit of kick.  Jon Pertwee, Katy Manning and Delgado are as delightful as usual and obviously the foremost reasons to purchase this video, one of the last Pertwees not yet released commercially.  For all the roundabout storytelling with characters escaping from capture only to wind up imprisoned again to kill time, and the campy aliens and robots, fans of this show and these actors will probably enjoying seeing 'Colony In Space'  again for the first time in a long while.",1036108800,11,1681,4.996415770609319

1798636,4,B0000714F9,"This is the Third Doctor's first off-Earth adventure after being exiled for a time there by the Time Lords, and Jo Grant's first trip in the TARDIS. They end up in Earth's future on an alien world where settlers have established a space colony while the planet in question has been targeted by the evil Interplanetary Mining Corporation (IMC) for exploitation. The Doctor tries to resolve the conflict between the settlers and the jack-booted thugs from the IMC, when the Master arrives disguised as an interplanetary arbitrator! Then there are the primitive remnants of an alien race, who once seemed to have had advanced technology, and have the ruins of a mysterious underground city . . .

All in all it is a pretty decent six part story, and the Third Doctor gets off earth for the first time. The alien planet turns out to essentially be filmed in a muddy clay quarry, but the character-driven story manages to overcome the issues with the location. This single DVD is pretty light on extras, essentially the main feature is a single making-of segment.

1798690,5,B0000714F9,"I was every pleased to have found a rare VHS copy of this classic Jon Pertwee Doctor Who episode. Jon was one of my favorite Doctors, even if the critics called him ""fancy""; but when you're a sci-fi loving kid, and Doctor Who comes on the television, no one was better than Jon Pertwee. R.I.P., Doctor Number 3!!!",1362614400,,313,4.413793103448276
1798691,4,B0000714F9,"While hard core Doctor Who Fans of the John Pertwee Era and Doctor Who in general may consider this a substandard story by certain measures, I find that it is in many ways and ideal introductory story for those wanting to learn more about the Classic Doctor Who Series for several reasons:

First, by being the first Jon Pertwee Story where he actually uses the TARDIS to visit another planet and escape Earth where he has been stranded by the Timelords.  As such, it gives such viewers a little background on the time machine vehicle and the somewhat adversarial and uneasy relationship between the Time Lords and the renegade Doctor.

Secondly, the story shows how the Doctor Who I believe built its core audience for a Science Fiction Series not based on special effects (which due to limited production budgets are sell known to be sub-standard) but by examining the interplay of relationships between groups with different motivations.  In this case, a group of well-meaning colonists just struggling to survive on the planet versus a group of greedy miners representing a firm who are just trying to obtain the rich minerals beneath the surface to fatten their wallets.  There are also a group of primitives and true residents of the planet to be dealt with who have their own struggles.  These three groups are pitted against each other throughout the story as a power struggle for the planet ensures.

Third, the story also gives the newer viewer a very good look at the multi-faceted Doctor, who against a backdrop of double dealing and backstabbing that ensues throughout the story, showcases all his of his varied skills, from his physical combat preferences (Venusian Karate) to his scientific, investigative and even diplomatic skills, all of which are necessary to bring about a successful conclusion in favor of the good guys.

This story also introduces to such an audience a venerable Doctor Who Villain in the form of ""The Master"", an evil Time Lord who has a long history with the Doctor and has his own more far reaching interests on the planet in the form of controlling a ""doomsday weapon"" in which he can then subjugate the Universe for his own purposes.

Of interest to hard-core Doctor Who Fans may be the character of ""Caldwell"" as played by Brit Actor Bernard Kay, who popped up in several Doctor Who Stories under different, earlier doctors from both the William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton eras.  Kay previously appeared as ""Saladin"" in ""The Crusade"" and also appeared as important characters in ""The Faceless Ones"" and p ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"".  In this story, he plays a Mining Engineer, who has a conscience which does not allow him to go along with the ambitions of the other miners which means killing off the Colonists, even though this would be in his own best financial interests.  At key times, he assists the colonists which helps to turn the tide in their favor and he ultimately stays with them at the end, helping to repair their much dilapidated equipment which helps them build a fresh start on the planet.

Again, perhaps not the strongest story in the Doctor Who, John Pertwee Era but I think a valuable story for the right audience.",1356134400,3,3189,4.829357798165137
1798692,4,B0000714F9,"Coming at the close of the Third Doctor's second season, otherwise kmown as the ""Master's season"", this adventure on another planet at the behest of the Time Lords was a much welcome change to the Earth Bound Unit stories of the previous year and all of the second.  One can see why Roger Delgado's Master was such a delightful villain and foil to Pertwee's Doctor.  Just as Willaim Hartnell gave the Dr Who universe its first great adversary in the Daleks and Patrick Troughton added the Cybermen as its second, Jon Pertwee adds the villainous Time Lord in the Master.  As usual the Master lies and cheats to gain access to an ancient weapon of an old civiization that has regressed to a primitive state and has no idea or could care less what the end result will be if it is unloosed on the universe.  The Timne Lords send the Doctor to this planet to stop the Master but he along with Jo Grant, land knee deep in a conflict with a group of colonists and a mining corpration who are intent of throwing them off of their claim to the planet.  The ""Doomsday"" weapon is a nice analogy to nuclear weapons of the time this story was conceived and produced and the usual interplay between the Doctor and the Master is cleverly done.  The Master appeared in all five stories of the Third Doctor's second season and had not gotton stale in the slightest.  In total, the Master was the central foe of the Doctor in six out of eight stories at the time.  Undoubtedly if the Who audience did not enjoy the character, he would not have appeared so often.  All in all, this is great fun to watch and by this time the writers, production staff and the actors had rounded in to good form.  Tom Baker's Doctor which introduced Dr Who to the United States market via PBS is much better known but Jon Pertwee shows n this DVD just why Dr Who was so popular when Baker took over the role.",1332633600,,1871,4.36599423631124
1798693,3,B0000714F9,"I was disappointed in the quality of the picture and sound. How ironic that the ""Special Features"" out-takes reel of 16mm film that they discovered and transferred was far superior in clarity than the actual footage now seen in the episode. What a shame.

One problem I noticed with the sound was that the constant wind sound that was playing in the background sounded quite different in another episode. At first I thought it was just poor original materials, but later, while working on my own film on my computer, I think I figured out what was going on. The wind sound, I think became distorted after the sound was put through a computerized filter. When I was experimenting on my film's sound I discovered that if too much background noise is filtered it makes it sound funny. I think sound was filtered out too much on some of the scenes which makes the wind sound totally different.

I enjoyed the making-of documentary that was included, however, I DO NOT like the commercials for the so-called new Doctor Who. I have chosen not to watch the re-engineered Doctor Who for a reason, it's awful, and I really don't like them advertising for the new garbage on DVDs of the ORIGINAL and far superior Doctor Who. It just doesn't mix and they should respect the old and new series and not try to have documentary or advertising cross-overs on either series' videos. That'd be like having William Hartnell documentaries on the ""Special Feature"" section on Series Seven of the new one!",1329868800,5,1484,4.703846153846154
1798694,5,B0000714F9,"I mainly purchased this one because the master is in it (Roger Delgado). He doesn't show up for the first few episodes but that's ok. The story features Jo's first trip in the Tardis and the first appearance of IMC.

The Time Lords realize that the plans for The Doomsday Weapon are missing and they suspect The Master so that secretly send The Doctor and Jo, without their consent, to the planet of Uxarieus in the year 2472 where they discover colonists from earth, natives of the planet, a mining corporation, giant insects and, as you can guess, The Master. This story isn't well regarded in fandom, which is a shame as I think that it's actually pretty good. Part of this might have to do with the fact that the print that was around for so long wasn't in very good quality. The Doctor Who Restoration Team have done a great job of restoring this as it looks much better than it has in a long time. As always, a nice set of extras round out the release.",1323820800,3,903,4.380952380952381
1798696,3,B0000714F9,"""Colony in Space"" was the first Doctor Who story to allow the Doctor to leave Earth after being exiled to the planet by the Time Lords at the end of season six, so these episodes could have been something really special. Instead, ""Colony"" is a solid, workmanlike production that had to meet the usual challenges posed by England's unpredictable weather and the BBC's budget constraints, but it's nothing remarkable.

The Master, who escaped with his TARDIS fully operational at the close of the previous adventure, ""The Claws of Axos,"" steals the Time Lords' secret file on the  Doomsday Weapon, so the Time Lords shanghai the Doctor and Jo to the planet Uxarieus to stop the Master from seizing control of the device. So much time had passed since the Doctor last needed the TARDIS (almost two years) that the production crew had forgotten how it was supposed to work: when it takes off for Uxarieus with the Doctor and Jo inside, it simply blinks out of frame rather than making its usual slow dissolve.

On Uxarieus, colonists with a rightful claim to settle the planet struggle to eke out a meager existence while representatives of the Interplanetary Mining Corporation secretly sabotage their work in hopes of exploiting the planet's rich duralineum deposits. Meanwhile, the colonists' leader, Ashe (marking the return of John Ringham, a veteran character actor who had appeared previously on Doctor Who in ""The Smugglers"" and ""The Aztecs""), is trying to keep peace with reptilelike humanoids that live in the ""Primitive City"" beneath the planet's surface.

Actually, the city isn't ""primitive"" at all but the remains of a once advanced civilization that slipped into decline after building the Doomsday Weapon. The Master soon arrives posing as the Adjudicator assigned by Earth to resolve the colonists and miners' dispute. Determined to find out what the Master is really up to, the Doctor has to play it cool: the Master has credentials (faked but credible) while he has none.

""Colony in Space"" gave veteran script writer Malcolm Hulke ample room to explore weighty political issues of particular interest at the outset of the 1970s: people vs. corporations, and the corrupting effects of advanced weapons systems capable of destroying planets. For all its potential, though, the production never quite breaks out of the creative constraints placed on it by the BBC.

As usual, exterior shooting (which required explosives) took place in a quarry: this time, the china clay pits of St. Austell in Cornwall. Heavy rains and bitter cold turned fight scenes into mud wrestling matches, and the actors, often scantily clad, were miserable between takes. To help the miners get around the forbidding landscape, the production was able to borrow two Haflinger 4x4 flatbed trucks on condition that they be returned undamaged. In one scene, one of the trucks is overturned by a giant boulder rolling down a hillside. In the final shot, viewers never see the rock actually hit the truck (which means, with cutting, the effect could have been faked), but the styrofoam boulder (filled with stage weights) made an enormous dent in the truck's side requiring costly repairs.

Set designs for the interior shots inside the Primitive City, for example, are uniformly serviceable, but the costume designs for the Uxarieusans are execrable, seriously detracting from the story. (The mask for the Guardian is so bad I couldn't tell whether the part was played by an actor or a puppet.) The customary making-of documentary in the Special Features menu focuses on the work of first-time director Michael Briant, and therefore doesn't explain the reasons for the production's lackluster design.",1322265600,,3685,5.121464226289517
7973676,4,B0000714F9,"An above average Dr. Who story featuring his arch nemesis, ""the Master"".  There are several plots going on at once, and they come together fairly well.  The effects are cheap and laughable, but creative.  Some of the acting is a bit ""over the top"".  I could not wait for the Doctor to escape from earth, and loved Jo's amazement at seeing the inside of the TARDIS for the first time.  I loved the interior TARDIS design and the very rough exterior.  This story includes the Master, the Time Lords (they hijack the TARDIS), and the Time Lord Matrix.  We get to see future earth colonies, aliens, ""monsters"", robots, Doomsday weapon, the Master's TARDIS and its interior.  The Brigadier plays a very small part at the beginning and the end, but I will never forget it.  There are many memorable moments in this story.  There are some disappointing moments, such as the ""primitive future"" look of the colonists and the master alien which is basically a not-very-functional puppet.  Roger Delgado is the best Master, he seems to be the Doctor's equal in intelligence and only loses because he has chosen the side of evil.  The newer incarnations of the Master are very poor and inadequate in comparison.  The ""bad guys"" in this story is not only the Master, but include the mining corporation and its liaison, Captain Dent, as well as the Master's assumed identity as ""the Adjudicator"" -- a kind of dual enemy role. In spite of this, the Master ends up being very impressed by the Doctor's convictions and fortitude.
