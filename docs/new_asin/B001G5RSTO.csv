In the Night, Down in Black, Bring Me Everyone, I Hunt Alone.........they're all good, but the highlight is definitely an extended version of ""Into the Arena"" from their 2002 album Above All.

If you like GREAT rock and Roll then this DVD is for you! And check out their albums too, starting with ""Latest Version of the Truth"" and then ""Above All"".

But, regardless of what 3 different website's product descriptions state, the sucker is most definitely PAL so it was time to break out the old portable DVD player!! Kinda aggravating but at least I have ONE player that will play it. That fact, plus the rather steep price, are a couple things to factor into your descision.

To me it's WELL worth the $35 I paid!!

The setlist on the DVD is:

In the Night
Down in Black
Accident Blackspot
Bring Me Everyone
Haunted By Myself
Into the Arena
My Disorder
Black City
I Lied
I Hunt Alone
Monday Warrior
6:36
Double Nature

There's also backstage footage, a promo video and the video for Double Nature.

There are several songs I wish they had played the night this was recorded, and I wish the videos for Down in Black and Parasite were also on the DVD but, you can't have everything and that certainly doesn't detract from a 5-star rating!!

So do yourself a BIG favor and get into this band...NOW! Watching the 2 above mentioned videos on YouTube or their website is a good place to start!!",1236988800,,1584,4.510489510489511
