8508158,1,B0071BY246,Do not other. This is a poorly produced product with interviews from people who did not even know her. Boring!,1469232000,,110,4.55
8508159,1,B0071BY246,"This DVD about Elizabeth Taylor is incoherent and badly written. The screen shows images that don't relate to what is  being said by the announcer. The program jumps around incoherently from unrelated images to different times in Elizabeth's life. Many images are repeated again and again. Many of the comments are incorrect. In addition, women on a park bench are interviewed, but no sound can be heard. They move their lips, but no words can be heard. Total waste of money.",1343779200,,475,4.864197530864198
8508160,1,B0071BY246,"A ridiculous, homemade production narrated by 3 nobodies--this video looks as though it were slapped together by a seventh grader. I don't understand how the producers got the rights to use clips and images from her films (perhaps they didn't.)

This is clearly a disgusting attempt to make money off of Elizabeth Taylor's death. When I purchased the DVD, I seem to remember the reviews on here being positive--I don't know if it's possible for people to remove their reviews?

With a little extra effort, this video could have been garbage...at the moment, it's sub-garbage. Save your money, do NOT buy this trash!!",1339200000,6,616,4.970873786407767
8508161,1,B0071BY246,This is awful! A very amateurish production.  There are clips of Taylor's movies shown without audio and they don't relate to the narrative.  Commentators are unknowns giving their opinions while sitting in a public park or backyard.  The film starts off with a slanderous comment about Taylor's father being envious and taking her money.  The truth is she had a trust fund as required by law and had a close relationship with her mother and father until their deaths.  I imagine this is a shoddy attempt to rip off Elizabeth Taylor fans.  Amazon should pull it from their offerings. I returned my copy for a refund.... it's that bad.,1338076800,10,634,4.770642201834862
8508162,1,B0071BY246,I waited for this dvd for 2 month's and was excited when I received it. But what a disappointment it is. There is nothing new or interesting on it. It is poorly narated by 3 fans who are awful. The editing and photography is so bad pathetic more likely. But the most curious thing is they don't have Elizabeth say anything. NOT ONE WORD even in the clips of her movies no Elizabeth. This Great Lady doesn't deserve this mess.,1337558400,6,425,4.325
