8416657,4,B0018QVHRU,"toxic narcotic is a good hard-core band from boston. ignore the previous review this other person wrote. Maybe they thought they were shopping on the disney channel. Hey, know what you buy before you buy it, and if its not for you, don't trash some one elses cool band. So get into your volkswagon, put in your wilson-philips cd and go to star bucks were all the other ""safe-people"" hang out, you belong there. And don't ever listen to my music again, because you don't deserve it, yuppie !",1452816000,,490,4.51685393258427
