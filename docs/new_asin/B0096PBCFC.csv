5274006,5,B0096PBCFC,OH FOR THE DAYS WHEN THEY MADE MOVIES LIKE THIS !  GOOD STORY  LINE AND WELL ACTED.  DESERVES TO BE RATED A CLASSIC.  THE FAMILY CAN CERTAINLY HAVE A POPCORN AND MOVIE NIGHT WITH THIS ONE..,1380672000,3,189,4.166666666666667
5274007,4,B0096PBCFC,"I have been a fan of Rhonda Fleming since the 1950's and therefore any film with her taking a leading role makes for good entertainment. An adventure film of this era wasn't dependent on the acting of the participants for box office appeal. It transported as did other films of the same genre, the audience for a little while at least away from the austere post war years.",1372032000,3,372,4.485294117647059
5274008,3,B0096PBCFC,"I was a little disappointed with this purchase.  The film itself was a pretty standard
pirate tale.  Certainly not a bad film, but also not one of the better ones of the genre.
Rhonda Fleming is lovely as always, but the whole affairs comes off as pretty lightweight.

Of more concern was the poor quality of the film transfer.  I have ordered quite a few of the dvd-r
burn-on-demand studio archive titles and have found very inconsistant quality across the board.
Some transfers appear clean and crisp while others appear faded with poor resolution.  This might
be acceptable if these titles were sold cheaply, but at close to $20 a disc, the studios need to do
a much better job.",1370476800,8,681,4.641666666666667
5274009,4,B0096PBCFC,"The Golden Hawk is a good old fashioned pirate movie, with a little less action than usual

5274010,3,B0096PBCFC,"The Golden Hawk is an okay pirate movie, based on a popular novel. I don't think I could sit through it twice.",1361059200,6,110,4.045454545454546

8536830,3,B0096PBCFC,Love it when a film is in the Maureen O'Hara section I stick it in there and nope it isn't  that and it's possibly the worst transfer you will ever see.  I know Amazon is probably using a 16 mm to dvd converter.  I can't afford one of those  they are well over $1000 might as well order a pinball game.  But hey I don't have the best vision in the world but that is beyond blurry.  ie for those of us who remember.  we used to have projector movies.  occasionally the protector would focus on a hair instead of the film.  fairly sure thats what happened here.,1433721600,,559,4.101851851851852
8536831,3,B0096PBCFC,"""The Golden Hawk"" is a preposterous movie in many ways -- especially if you're looking for historical accuracy.  Then again, this is a swashbuckler, and historical accuracy isn't the point -- it isn't even a good idea, necessarily.  That said, Sterling Hayden is utterly ridiculous as a French!!! buccaneer -- a more American-looking and sounding actor there isn't.  Still, he has fun in the lead rle of Captain Kit Gerardo (strange name for a Frenchman, that), and I had fun with him, not taking any of this seriously.  The story is engaging-enough, especially with a nudge of help.

I love swashbucklers.  There are many great ones, but there are also plenty that are rather poor (low budget) creations which can be helped enormously with a little bit of editing. (""Pirates of Tortuga"", for example, is a terrible film as is, but at 1.3X playback and with 15-minutes of edits it changes from a D- to a B film.)  I made my own edit of ""The Golden Hawk"", playing back the movie at 1.3X (something many DVD players will do) while copying it to a DVD-R (I should say a second DVD-R, as the original is also a DVD-R) and cutting a dull dance sequence that occurs from 31:04 to 35:02.  All this enabled me to squeeze the 82-minute film into a superior 59-minute one -- a much more enjoyable one.  It's amazing what a difference the faster pacing brings.  I highly recommend watching the film at 1.3X at the very least.  It takes a D-grade film and raises it to a C or C+.

The picture quality of this Columbia Choice Collection release is insulting.  The picture is very soft and sometimes even out-of-focus.  You're likely to have an as-good-or-better copy from Turner Classic Movies or a broadcast channel like GetTV or This!  The sound is fine, but Columbia should be ashamed of itself for not putting a better print on this expensive DVD-R.",1412726400,6,1840,4.635802469135802

8536833,4,B0096PBCFC,"What more can you say than that name.  She conjures up visions of flame red hair and an angelic face.  I will say that there are better pirate movies out there (Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk, The Black Swan, Captain Horatio Hornblower (not really a pirate movie in my book, but a period piece to be sure), and others).  For me having Rhonda in this flick makes the movie.  She brings her own spitfire passion to the film, which makes it better.  IMHO",1389744000,2,448,4.349397590361446
