Movie was so good I went to work telling co workers about it. I even lent it out, haven't got it back yet.",1366502400,,275,4.2075471698113205
8701584,4,B00473YW14,"Let's see how odd we can make characters and relationship. Phoenix lives in an apartment she once lived in as a child. Her mother killed herself in the same place. There is a bad coke deal that goes down and Angel shows up shot at Phoenix's place (with 5 kilos of coke), a one time boyfriend, until he lost her to the lesbian who lives down below. He has seen a movie where a bullet was removed from a leg with a hot knife, so he wants Phoenix to do it. Phoenix's sister calls her and needs help. She sleeps around quite a bit and is suicidal. She had just killed a man (John?) by shooting him multiple times in the head using a stuffed teddy bear as a silencer. She tells her sister he killed himself.

The guy who dispose of the bodies sells them to a Chinese food place which uses them to make General Tso's chicken. The man who is killing everyone to try to find out where Angel is located is the incestuous brother of the lesbian. Phoenix and the lesbian are attempting to find a buyer for the coke on their own, while Angel is having sex with the psychotic sister. Once the psychotic sister finds out the neighbor is a lesbian, she goes and visits her... but hey! She is HIV so things never happen.

There is a certain comedy element to the interconnection of the characters and the story, but it is told in a sober fashion so we don't laugh.",1304726400,,1348,4.22093023255814
