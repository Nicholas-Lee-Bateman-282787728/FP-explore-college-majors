5787163,5,B00DBE6WNQ,"These mysteries are appropriate for anyone who can read the subtitles... or who understand Italian. Even so, you'll be sure to pick up a bit of the language as you listen. The characters are believable, the acting is great. My favorite is Marshallo Cecchini--Don Matteo's police officer friend. Will you watch these again? Certo!",1377907200,7,329,5.111111111111111

5787171,4,B00DBE6WNQ,"As  someone who is studying Italian, I've found this series to be one of the easiest to follow. In addition, the acting is first-rate and the scenery lovely. The ensemble of characters is also very engaging. I did not give this series a fifth star only because a few plot devices seem too often repeated, e.g., the arrest of the wrong suspect (or two) based on flimsy evidence, and the high-maintenance girlfriend of the police captain. I intend to see all the episodes as they are, overall, very enjoyable and the dialogue has helped my studies of the language.",1406419200,2,562,4.6767676767676765
5787172,5,B00DBE6WNQ,"Father Matteo is portrayed as humble, caring, extraordinarily intelligent, and deeply sincere. He is carefully presented as a priest in all stories (doing priestly duties in every show) who is drawn into being a detective by caring for people in need. In addition, all the primary characters interact so beautifully. They show human flaws as well and we see them struggle. I have found myself caring about each one as if they were a personal friend. The Italian culture is carefully shown as well. Gubbio, the small city portrayed, is like any of a thousand Italian older towns or the old centers of Italy's cities.

Don Matteo during my 16 years living in Italy was tremendously popular. Even now, It's  reruns are still being shown weekly. My last viewing was during my last week living in Italy July 2013.

I have purchased every episode available, not to prevent the loss of my Italian but to watch old friends. When I watch I am in Italy once more.

Learning Italian? The English subtitles are effective in helping.",1393545600,,1020,4.778409090909091
5787173,5,B00DBE6WNQ,"The plots of Set 5 are wonderful -- as usual for the Don Matteo series.  The DVD manufacturer, however, has yet to produce a high quality product.  The first set 5 I ordered had serious skips, which after a lot of efforts, clearly were a problem of the DVD and not the player.  This has happened with other Don Matteo DVDs.  Amazon, however, replaced the DVD easily and quickly.

As for the episodes, they are always great fun.  The masterful blend of comedy and seirous topics, the interplay of interesting and quirky characters, and the charm of the location make Don Matteo a delight.",1381017600,5,587,4.596153846153846

8591248,5,B00DBE6WNQ,"Super Duper. Very creatively written.  My only complaint is so many of the actors are such high-strung characters who get angry and all worked up so easily.  That isn't exactly stereotyping the Italians as overly emotional, but it does make one wonder if there is a high blood pressure problem there?",1518739200,,300,4.862745098039215

Perfect it you want to brush up on your Italian, but there are English subtitles so even if the language doesn't appeal to you, you will still enjoy this show. The characters are very believable; they start to feel like people you know. The acting is outstanding. Good humor. Good story lines.",1440201600,,347,4.4375
