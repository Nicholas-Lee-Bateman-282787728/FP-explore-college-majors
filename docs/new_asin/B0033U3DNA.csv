4065501,5,B0033U3DNA,"Loved this tale of a Slovenian girl moving to the capital and becoming a call girl to pay for her new life and lifestyle - until, of course, complications arise in the form of a dying dignitary and frightening pimps.  This beginning part of the story is thrilling and will put you on the edge of your seat but it's the next part that really holds the heart of the film.  Alexandra returns to her little hometown to escape the dangers of her city life.  We see her interact with her father (delightfully acted by Peter Musevski), an aged rocker trying to pull his life together after his wife left him for a man she was having an affair with.  Nina Ivanisin as Alexandra goes deep into the role, keeping up a strong and unfazed facade as everything around her is volatile and threatening.  Very cool and a perfect final scene!",1307923200,,825,4.437086092715232
4065502,4,B0033U3DNA,"I REALLY LIKED THIS MOVIE. NINA IVANISIN PLAYS A CALL GIRL NAMED ALEXANDRA. HER REAL NAME IS SASHA. WHEN ONE OF HER CLIENTS DIES OF A HEART ATTACK SHE CALLS THE AMBULANCE BUT THEN FLEES THE SCENE. ALEXANDRA USES HER CALL GIRL MONEY TO PAY FOR A NICE FLAT AND GO TO SCHOOL TO STUDY ENGLISH.

SOON THE POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR THE CALL GIRL WHO LEFT THE SCENE AND SO ARE PIMPS, LOOKING TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF HER AFTER SHE FLEES FROM  THEM TOO. NINA IVANISIN IS GREAT AS THE CALL GIRL. SHE IS PRETTY AND MANUPULATIVE AND PETER MUSEVSKI IS GREAT AS HER SWEET AND CARING FATHER WHO TRIES TO RESTART HIS OWN FADING ROCK BAND, AS HE TRIES TO LIVE AND CARE FOR HIS DAUGHTER.

ALL IN ALL I REALLY LIKED THIS MOVIE. I THINK IT DESERVES A WATCH.",1303084800,2,731,4.0979020979020975
4065503,4,B0033U3DNA,"A 23 year old Slovenian girl, originally from a small town there but now studying at the university in the capital of Ljubljana, supplements her life as a student with stints as a prostitute (to show how distasteful her job is, the filmmakers have all her clients to be fat and/or old). One of them is a famous politician, and when he dies of a heart attack when he was in a hotel room with her, she flees not before telling the police. She is soon searched by the authorities and by the news media as the mysterious Slovenian Girl. She is also on the run from two sleazy, violent pimps, who want her to work for them instead of independently. A former boyfriend is stalking her also, and her mother back in her hometown doesn't look too happy when she shows up for a visit. Only her rock musician father and a female friend (who are obviously ignorant of her side job) are there supporting her. And all of the time she's having money problems, including coming with money to pay for a loan she incurred in to buy an apartment.

To me the movie works best as a showcase of the general aimlessness of many young people today, especially in the developed world. Without any spiritual or political belief, many young people today seem to fall into nihilism. The main actress is pretty, but it seems to me to be way too surly to be a prostitute. Shouldn't she at least feign she is a sweet girl in front of her clients (this is not a criticism of her acting, she clearly has been told to play her that way by the filmmakers). Alas, this surliness of her makes the audience not care too much of what happens to her. Still, this is an interesting, well made film, though not very emotionally involving.",1301184000,14,1696,4.3841269841269845
4065504,4,B0033U3DNA,"This is a very good film that presents the hardships and difficulties in being a call girl. Alexandra (Nina Ivanisin) is a twenty-three years old college student who lives with her father. She attends college in the capital of Slovenia. She is scarce on money. Alexandra wants to have a nice flat, but it is too expensive to keep. She falls further and further behind on payments. No matter how many clients she has, it is not enough to keep up with the payments. Her academics suffer as well. She becomes desperate to the point here she has to manipulate a professor to give her a passing grade for an exam. She lies to everyone: her clients, her professors, the bank teller, her friends, and her father. I feel for her poor father. He distracts himself from the dullness of his life by trying to start up his old band. His wife, Alexandra's mother, left him for a man she had an affair with. All the actors were all right. Her father's friends were quite stupid and goofy.  Alexandra looks quite homely though throughout the whole film. As if she needed a good night's sleep, or a shower. She was very defiant and sort of drained. Rather lifeless must say, but I will blame that on all the disgusting men she had to work with. She sure smokes up a chimney.  All in all, the film was a good simple portrayal of the classic call girl profession, aka prostitute.  I feel bad for these girls who choose this profession to compensate them-selves for money.",1288310400,35,1453,4.496212121212121
4065505,3,B0033U3DNA,"(special thanks to Film Movement for providing me with a screener!)

Prostitution is often described as the world's oldest profession. At various points in history its been banned, praised and made into a form of worship. These days it simply is what it is, and for at least some people, it's a viable way to make money.

One of those people is featured in this latest release from Film Movement. The film is a drama about a young woman, Alexandra (Nina Ivanisin), who has escaped small town life and is now a student living in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. She wants to have a certain kind of lifestyle and that lifestyle requires more money than a student might normally have. So like many attractive people before her, she figures that she might as well start selling sex to get the life she wants.

At first things seem to be going quite well for her, and she's soon raking in enough money to buy a small condo. But right at the beginning of the film things take a dark turn as a German member of the European Parliament, and would-be customer, dies of a heart attack. She's got the presence of mind to call for medical help and then scoots out of the hotel. Soon the hunt is on for her, which doesn't stop her from continuing to work, something which eventually captures the eyes of a couple local pimps. Things go downhill from there.

I liked this movie, but didn't love it. It wasn't anything terribly spectacular. The main character isn't that sympathetic or as interesting as the story wants you to think she is, though her father, a former rock musician trying to get back into the game was quite interesting. I'd actually rather like to see a movie just about him, since I think that could be really fascinating.

I did get some vague feelings about the sense of quiet desperation with which she leads her life, but there were many times when I wanted to smack her upside the head and say, ""Hey, wake up and join reality!"" I was pleased at the outcome of the film, which seemed to me to be fairly realistic and well-suited to the story. I was also quite fascinated to see Slovenia, a country about which I know a little, but not much. Ljubljana itself looks like a very nice city and the small town she comes from seems quite lovely as well. I also really liked the fact that the film didn't seem to take any position one way or the other about the morality of prostitution. It just presents it as a fact of life and then deals with it. That was nice to see.

Ultimately I can't really give a recommendation on this one. It was interesting enough, and not bad, but it's not one that I'm likely to watch again.

== Short Subject ==

This month's short subject is called Honor, and it centers around a woman (Mad Men's Elizabeth Moss), who recently lost her husband in Iraq. A former friend of his comes to visit her one day with a stack of letters and as the two people talk a dark secret is soon revealed.

Again as with the main feature, I liked this short, but I didn't love it. Neither of the two characters really got or held my attention, and the central story didn't really interest me. The secret that's revealed and some of the emotional toll it's clearly taken on Moss' character was fairly interesting, but in a movie this brief there's not that much that could be done with it. It's not a bad short, but not anything worth taking a lot of effort to see.",1283817600,13,3382,4.3984
4065506,5,B0033U3DNA,"I saw ""Slovenian Girl"" (as this film was titled at the time) in January of 2010 at the Palm Springs International Film Festival.  It is spot-on about post-Soviet life in Eastern Europe, where the vacuum created when the Soviet lifestyle was replaced by capitalism is filled by amoral activity aimed at material gain at any cost.  The Slovenian actress in the title role is amazing -- able to show her duplicity and manipulating ways merely by a look in her eyes.  The supporting cast is equally good.

4065629,4,B0033U3DNA,"There is no point in my writing of the storyline as most everyone else has already done just that.  But needing to add my two cents... This movie is not titillating as the title might lead you to suspect.  Rather it is an interesting study, as a film novel, of a girl who has made a series of bad choices without thinking of consequences and learns a life lesson.  The outcome is more fortunate than what could have possibly happened, and it was well acted out - I think the cast well chosen and the story well played.  My time was not wasted and as long as you're not looking for sexy scenes or a date flick, I suspect your time will not be wasted either.  I liked it enough to pick up a copy for my own library, although you may wish to rent it before dropping harder change, just in case your taste isn't as mine.

4065634,1,B0033U3DNA,"Alexandra is a manipulative and messed up girl.
It is a poor career choice to be a call girl, I guess, but on top of it she makes many other bad decisions which come back to haunt her.
Some of them really shocking like when she had a choice of completing one of her  ""calls"" or not.

A lot of films from former communist block are very dark and very depressing and this one is a perfect example of this trend.
There is no uplifting message, no satisfying resolution, just a sad story of a loser.

Filmed in harsh colors, unflattering angles and blunt close-ups, it is neither visually appealing nor emotionally satisfying.
Unless you have a need to to feel that ""my life is better than hers"".

the cast is full of absolutely grotesque actors (amateurs?) and the only good looking one is the villain.

Would not recommend it nor watch it ever again.

4065635,5,B0033U3DNA,"A Call Girl, also known as Slovenian Girl, is a dark slice of life drama following a young student named Sasha (also known as Aleksandra) who doubles as a call girl to make extra money. One one hand she cherishes her relationship with her wannabe rockstar father, and on the other she is desperate to satisfy the craving of moving fast in the big city. Caught up between exams, clients, and debt Sasha is forced into rough situations that inevitably impact both of her lives.

Nina Ivanisin is remarkable as the guarded yet determined Sasha. Her mysterious and depressive-like state is offset by her astounding beauty. She's scarily convincing as both the loving daughter and the working girl. Nina and the rest of the cast provide much realism that enhances the film and make it seem believable.

Though there are several scenarios in the film, we don't have a single plot, nor a straight forward conclusion. Sasha faces large loan payments, pressures to do well in school, threats from street pimps, and personal relationship issues. Essentially, we're given a glimpse into the Solvenian Girl's struggles, and left uncertain but with a slight amount of hope.

While the film is about a call girl, sex is only a small part of the picture. The film accurately portrays the differences between big city and small town life, in addition to the many challenges and decisions a young adult faces in taking on the real world. Additionally, finding that the film's director was inspired by real life Slovenian girls, young students using their bodies as means to get ahead, only made the film much more emotional for me.

The beautifully shot scenes in the opposing Slovenian towns are well enhanced by an excellent soundtrack and the engaging performances. The film made me fall in love with its Slovenian girl, and very curious about more Slovenian films.

4065636,5,B0033U3DNA,"I came across this film in my local public library.  I picked it up because it was from Slovenia and so far I have not seen any movies from the Film Movement series that is from that part of the world.  Set in the capital of the Slovenia it is a story about young college girl who lives away from her small town and her father who seems to be her only family.  Her mother has left the family and has somewhat comfortable life she is unwilling to share with her daughter.  Their relationship is the one of the mutual dislike.

In a countries that have always been poor, having an apartment of one's own is a life long dream.  It is not surprising that Alexandra, movie's heroine, takes a leap of faith when she buy beautiful one bedroom apartment in the heart of the city, new construction.  To pay for it she turns to working as a call girl in between her college classes.  She is sure that with her smartness and looks she will beat the system and be able to provide herself with a comfortable life.

Alexandra resents her mother, but in a lots of ways she is just like her mother.  She uses men for money and false sense of her own security and comfort.  Alexandra is as manipulative as she is smart.  She is determined to succeed at all price.  I am not sure that Alexandra is a kind of a girl that can be liked, but she sure is strong willed and determined.  I truly enjoyed this movie and I would strongly recommend it.",1317600000,,1424,4.225925925925926
