7667255,5,B01BT5K7FM,"Mr. Herriott has produced an entertaining and educational video regarding his travels through Iceland. An insightful and introspective journey through a country unknown to most Americans. I highly recommend this dvd, for either entertainment or educational purposes.",1459382400,,266,6.216216216216216
7667256,4,B01BT5K7FM,"I always like Squatch's humorous and down-to-earth take on his ventures. It was nice to see the variety of experience of biking, hiking, and sightseeing in Iceland. You get the full scope here. Unfortunately, the year Squatch went was a very late thaw that thwarted plans for the hiking I was most interested in seeing. He did the best with what he was able to visit and it gave me my first concrete knowledge of a place I hope to visit someday. I recommend this one:)",1458777600,,468,4.453488372093023
7667257,5,B01BT5K7FM,"Once again I invited Scott Herriott to our den to entertain my family.  And once again he delivered.  What a fun movie!  Scott has the unique skill of finding the most interesting (abs quirky) folks and while adventure touring by foot, bike, or car weaves it all into an entertaining film.  Do yourself a favor and buy this DVDs. And you know what it wouldn't hurt if you check out his other DVDs too!  You will not be disappointed. Scout's honor!",1458086400,,447,4.469135802469136
7667258,5,B01BT5K7FM,"Beautifully shot film of the stark landscape of Icelamd. Hiking, biking; it's the type of trip most people can only dream of. This is a must-see for adventurers!",1458000000,,161,4.785714285714286
7667259,5,B01BT5K7FM,"I love Scott Herriott films. They are always very entertaining, and always fun. His latest one is about a jaunt around Iceland last summer. It's full of great sights, quirky, interesting people and his trademark humour. Iceland is beautiful and Scott captures it in all it's brilliance. Highly recommended.",1458000000,,306,5.26530612244898
7667260,5,B01BT5K7FM,"A quirky, lighthearted, and often hilarious, film about an amazing trip across Iceland.  Mostly done backpacking and cycling, this film shows you places and people that most tourists will never get to see.  The breathtaking views, the wonderful people, and even some 'rare' wildlife.  Scott does a wonderful job on this film.  It will make you seriously want to visit Iceland for your own next adventure.",1458000000,,404,5.075757575757576
7667261,5,B01BT5K7FM,"At times really funny, but 100% of the time beautiful.
So many gorgeous shots of this stunningly beautiful country. If you've been to Iceland, are contemplating going, or (like me) are a fan of Scott Herriott's hiking/travel films, you'll truly enjoy this!",1457568000,,256,5.119047619047619
7667262,5,B01BT5K7FM,"What an amazing adventure, and a fun movie. This movie is not for everyone. If you're expecting a big budget Hollywood movie- this is not it. If you enjoy a movie that explores the local people, places, food and the beautiful scenery; this movie is for you. For an independent movie the production quality is great. My wife and I loved the movie. Because of this movie we put a visit to Iceland on our bucket list.",1456876800,,414,4.3896103896103895
7667263,5,B01BT5K7FM,"Enjoyed watching 72 days in Iceland. Awesome views of the backcountry and made me want to visit Iceland and see for myself. Scott's humor reminds of Seinfeld. I recommend the movie if you want an ideal what Iceland looks likes in the raw backcountry. You just might see an Artic Fox, very cute.",1463961600,,294,4.566037735849057
7667264,3,B01BT5K7FM,"Good but different film, just like a home movie with friends. It gives you a non -tourist idea and otherwise scenery not seen by most.",1462579200,,134,4.4
7667265,5,B01BT5K7FM,As always I was completely delighted with a Squatch adventure! I think the thing that I enjoy the most is the feeling that I was on the journey with him! The scenery in this film is amazing. Not knowing much about Iceland I found myself captivated by both the scenery and the locals.  His sense of humor as it winds itself throughout the journey tickles me! Thankyou Scott for another epic adventure!!,1461456000,,401,4.569444444444445

8751342,1,B01BT5K7FM,"It kept skipping, plus the narrator was not professional and was quite insensitive to Icelandic customs. Very disappointed. The quality was very poor for $15.99. I wish I could get my money back.",1514937600,,195,4.9393939393939394
8751343,4,B01BT5K7FM,"Pretty good film, seems like a bit more of a home movie.  You don't get the feel 72 days passed though, but some of the scenery and folks interviewed helped you get a feel for what it would be like to visit Iceland.",1482364800,,215,4.0

8751347,4,B01BT5K7FM,An idiosyncratic road trip in a beautiful place. In some ways his hiking companions are more interesting than the filmmaker/main character. But in general it is a fun evening.,1466553600,,175,5.068965517241379
8751348,2,B01BT5K7FM,"We didn't enjoy this - it had a few interesting moments but for the most part, it wasn't what we had hoped to see. Having traveled in Iceland, we were looking for something with more of the scenery and flavor of the country and less of the travelers' jokes and oddball museums. A few quirks go a long way. We were also amazed that he could bike the entire ring road and show hardly any of the spectacular sights along the way. Not for us.",1466208000,5,438,4.1647058823529415
8751349,4,B01BT5K7FM,Amazing journey with an amazing couple. Lot of hiking with some beautiful sights.  Wore me and my wife out just watching. I give anyone credit for doing something like this; most people just do 2-4 weeks of vacation with no goal in mind.  I need to workout!  :),1464998400,,261,4.395833333333333
8751350,5,B01BT5K7FM,"I thoroughly enjoyed learning about Iceland through this documentary. No, it is not about an average person's trip to Iceland, but what a totally interesting way to see the country! The scenery is so beautiful, and the interviews with other hikers, travelers and locals were very interesting to me. Oh and Scott's sense of humor is a definite plus. I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in seeing Iceland, or for general travelers, hikers and cyclists.",1464652800,,464,4.961538461538462
8751351,3,B01BT5K7FM,"Not the most exciting travelogue, but I still found myself watching until the very end.  It reminded me of 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' which is one of my favorite movies.  I'm always impressed with those who take on such an adventure.",1464134400,,240,4.558139534883721
