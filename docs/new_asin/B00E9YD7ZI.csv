5899392,5,B00E9YD7ZI,"Bryan is the man. A veteran, accomplished shooter and engineer/scientist who is single handedly changing the long range shooting community. Bryan's contributions have made the physics of external ballistics accessible. He mathematically proves and then physically demonstrates the effects of variables and factors that determine the probability of (hitting the target for) any given firing solution. He breaks down the importance of these factors in priority for shooters to address in incremental steps to dramatically improve and the fine tune their ability to consistently make first shot hits at extreme distances. He is COL Cooper for the ELR community.",1438732800,3,658,5.656565656565657
5899393,5,B00E9YD7ZI,"Bryan Litz ""Putting Rounds on Target"" is a great idea on DVD.  Being able to watch and go through the set up is about as good as being there.  Not quite but a big help getting set up and insuring your equipment is functioning as needed.  Bran Litz has a way of explaining in a class room and then on the range and shooting.  This DVD is worth the money especially being new to the sport.",1434153600,,387,4.052631578947368
5899394,5,B00E9YD7ZI,Very informative,1427414400,,16,7.5
5899395,4,B00E9YD7ZI,"Very good for shooters at all stages of learning.  If you really want to learn why things happen the way they do when your shooting,  Or just improve your current skills this is for you.  Its easy to understand with very basic knowledge every shooter should know.  Great and laid out very well, it takes you through step by step.  I had first bought  his book when it fist came out some years ago and it has severed me well.  This video series helps explain those same items in a more comprehensive and visual way and that is much easier for myself to understand then algorithms and diagrams in a text book  I have been studying this subject now for many years and still learn every time i go shoot, this is a great foundation for distance shooting.

I would say however they are pricey for videos, they are worth the money it would have just made it an easier purchase if they were 10 bucks less.",1426550400,7,897,4.323353293413174
5899396,5,B00E9YD7ZI,"Amazingly informative, almost a must for anyone looking to become proficient in bullet building, and long-range shooting. This guys a wizard!",1397088000,3,141,5.761904761904762
5899397,3,B00E9YD7ZI,"Great information, but.... a real sleeper. low budget dvd. Brian is extremely smart but the dvd throws out allot of wonky math formulas , way over my head.",1394064000,2,155,4.571428571428571
5899398,5,B00E9YD7ZI,"Fair disclaimer, I've read Bryan's two books, so I was excited to see the DVD released. In linear form, Litz introduces simple processes to bring the shooter and her rifle to the point of development where long shots are feasible.

Whether the viewer desires to improve his competitive scores or to ethically get that elk at 700 yards, this DVD set will help get him going in the right direction.",1392681600,11,396,4.6571428571428575
5899399,5,B00E9YD7ZI,"This is great info straight from the man himself. Any avid long range shooter needs this info. I am too lazy to read his acclaimed books and prefer to be handfed. With a one year old running around, the DVD was best way to get the basics from Bryan. Will be getting his app for my cell, Applied Ballistics. Very cool stuff and he shows how to use it in the video. You don't have to be a 1000 yard shooter to need this info. I am shooting ar15 and 300 Weatherby in the 100-500 yard ranges most the time. The info in the DVD set is very helpful to me. Whether taking a 300 yard shot or a 1200 yard shot, the principles are the same. Watching this DVD makes me want to find a longer range though. Ha ha. DVD is divided into sections that focus on various aspects of precision long range shooting. His advice on rifles and equipment was very well thought out as well. I may have to break down and buy his books. The info is not the same cookie cutter crap I am used to in other precision/sniper oriented books. Brian is not tacticool, he is the real deal.",1386288000,20,1051,4.106796116504855
8603053,4,B00E9YD7ZI,"Just received them yesterday and watched them through once. Very informative and advanced. Covers all the topics in depth to be a precision long range shooter. Whether you're new or a seasoned long range shooter, theres something for everyone in these videos. The delivery of instruction can be spritzed up a bit, as its a little dry. Im gonna need to watch these videos a half dozen times and do some studying before I can retain it all. YouTube offers a lot of instructional videos for free, but its nice to have mostly everything you need compiled into one source. And convenient if you're looking to do some studying when internet access isn't available. Looking forward to progress. Happy shooting everyone! I rated 4/5 stars because it was a little expensive and dry for my liking.",1520899200,,787,4.794117647058823
8603054,5,B00E9YD7ZI,Brian is the man.  If you are a math person then you will grin the whole time.  If not then you can still at least know that there is an actual reason for everything that you don't understand.  The opening drills are critical and make the videos worth it alone.  5 for me.,1504915200,,272,4.0754716981132075

8603062,2,B00E9YD7ZI,"In the process of reading and studying everything I can find on long range shooting, I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately I found it not very useful. It started off well enough and gave some good info on how to do a ""tall target test"" so you can discover the tracking performance of your chosen scope, but after that the video trailed off into stuff that simply was not informative or useful. There is a video series on YouTube called ""Sniper 101"" that goes into WAY better detail than this video ever even touches on and that was disappointing because I actually paid for this, whereas the YouTube education was essentially free except for the large amount of time I invested watching it. The last thing I wanted to point out was how disappointed I was at the extent to which he relies completely on his ballistics program for pretty much everything, so a large part of the video is just showing you how to operate his ballistics program. That's all fine and good, but it doesn't really teach us anything about how all this works so we can derive our own thoughts and techniques.",1440720000,9,1089,4.532994923857868
