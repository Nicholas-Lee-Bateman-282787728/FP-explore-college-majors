8353734,5,B0026UV7CC,Wow talk about a great deal. Two biblical movies for the price of 1-The Robe and The Passion of The Christ. This was my first time seeing The Robe and I thought it was a wonderful movie. The 1080p picture is nice and crisp for a 1953 film. Audio was pretty good too. I enjoyed the special features too. Nice making of. And a feature on Cinemascope Widescreen as The Robe was the first. Passion of The Christ is another great looking movie in High Def. This is my 2nd time having this wonderful film on High Def as I have the DVHS version as well. And that one looked great too. The Blu-Ray one is even better as its in 1080p oppose to the Dtheater version being 1080i. Well anyways a great price for 2 awsome Blu-Rays.,1243555200,8,718,4.2101449275362315
