The film was directed by German born director Lommel who made a bunch of shot on video films like GREEN RIVER KILLER and ZOMBIE NATION that many people seem to really dislike. This early directors effort from him has a different and better directing style than his latter video works. In the beginning, a child is tied to a bed by his mother's boyfriend after he's caught witnessing their strange sexual games. His sister cuts him loose, and then he stabs and kills the man with the reflection being caught in the mirror. So when he grows up, he's now disturbed. Then that mirror is still hanging around, so when it's broken, it unleashes the ghost of the psychotic, evil boyfriend who can only travel and kill around the areas where the broken glass shards of the mirror lie. He's invisible, and some of the stuff he does is force a girl to plunge a pair of scissors in her throat and kill a kid by slamming a window on him when he pokes his head in; the window scene is on YOUTUBE. After that beginning stabbing, it does deliver a somewhat slow pace until the mirror is broken. Then the pace picks up, and it delivers some effective death scenes and gore. However, with the exception of a little nip slippage when that girl is killed with scissors, it doesn't deliver the sex and nudity that is present in those late 70s and early 80s slashers. The films locations in the countryside are good, and the film is different compared to all those other retro slashers. I like the suspense it builds up and the way the broken mirror pieces become spread throughout. Made with an English speaking cast, the directing and eerie music is a combo style of both American and foreign German horror that may or may not appeal to many. It combines both the slasher and supernatural genres and adds a mixing of both American and foreign film styles to create one of the more unique retro horrors. I personally think it's a classic.

The 88 films Blu-ray looks great. The interview with Lommel is good. You also get the TV spots and a little booklet. If you like the film, this is great disc to buy.",1465776000,3,2200,4.445544554455446
