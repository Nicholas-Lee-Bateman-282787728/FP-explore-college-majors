8433043,5,B004KKYA7U,"Until the NBC put in the 'time slot of death' (Saturday nights). Very good series and quite different. Really pushed to envelope on the topics from Immigration to School Shootings, Medical Insurance and Automotive recalls. Even the internal plots were really starting to develop and get interesting when the network killed the series. I am not even sure what to compare it to, kind a mixture of Suits, Fairly Legal, The Closer/Major Crimes and even White Collar. If you like those series, you should like this, but again it is very different and the themes are very heavy (may be a reason why NBC canned it).",1355356800,2,608,4.745283018867925
