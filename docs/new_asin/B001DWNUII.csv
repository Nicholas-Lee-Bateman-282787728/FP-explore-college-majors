3540732,5,B001DWNUII,"I have seen Jeff 2 times this year and saw the Christmas stuff both times.  He was AMAZING.  It was the best show i have seen live period, bar none!!! Achmed is my favorite character but Walter and Peanut are both great though.  This is going to be a must get DVD without a doubt.  If you enjoy the DVD's, you must get out and see him life, it is fantastic.  Also, Guitar Guy is a Riot!!!!",1220832000,7,389,4.0
3540733,5,B001DWNUII,"I was at the taping of this at the Pabst Theatre in Milwaukee, and I almost died laughing. I definitely recommend buying this! A great way to start the holidays!",1220745600,7,161,4.4
3540734,5,B001DWNUII,"Just saw Jeff Dunham last night doing much of the material on this DVD.  It is hilarious.  I don't know if it will feature Jeff and Brian Haner (guitar guy) trying to crack each other up on stage, but last night it was priceless!",1220659200,7,229,4.181818181818182
3540735,5,B001DWNUII,"I saw this live in Minnesota a couple weeks back and I left with tears I had been laughing so hard! He is truely amazing and I cannot wait for this DVD to come out and for him to come back to Minnesota! We drove 3 hours to watch him preform this christmas show and it was completly worth it! I recomemend seeing him live as well as buying his DVD's, you won't be let down! Plus Guitar Guy is such a great addition to this specail, it is worth more then they are charging! It's a must buy!",1220572800,35,488,3.9393939393939394
3540736,5,B001DWNUII,"Jeff and the gang were here in Knoxville earlier this year and were testing out material for the new christmas DVD. Achmed has his rendition of several christmas carols as did Walter and Peanut. This wasn't the ""final show"" of the recording but we did see a lot of test material to see what fans thought was the best so I am anxious to see what made the cut! I look forward to getting this!",1220400000,36,390,4.213333333333333

3540740,5,B001DWNUII,"I haven't received this yet, but I know it'll be just as amazing as his other two cd's.  I'm looking forward to viewing it.",1219795200,4,123,4.125
3540741,5,B001DWNUII,"I've seen Jeff-fuf 3 times now (his live show, that is) and I never cease to be AMAZED at his talent!! You REALLY believe there's MORE THAN HIM onstage!! The last show I saw included previews of this upcoming special and we are all in for a TREAT!!! Achh-med singing ""Jingle Bombs"" is sure to make the Christmas charts this year!

I LOVE guitar guy! (Brian Haner). Not only is he an extremely talented guitar player - he is also extremely FUNNY. He and Jeff play off one another quite well, and obviously enjoy one another alot. They'd have to with the amount of time they spend together on the road.

Peanut, is my all-time FAVORITE character. As he says - ""When you go PURPLE, you NEVER go back!""

Whatever DVD you decide to pick up, you will NOT be disappointed. Jeff Dunham is one of the most talented comedians of our time. You will laugh till you cry!",1217980800,82,857,4.377358490566038

Since I don't like some of his other puppets (the redneck and the old man especially) that colors my review.

The product itself is as advertised. And I can say that as far as Achmed's bit, it was wonderful.",1448064000,,398,4.293333333333333

3541065,5,B001DWNUII,"I have recently discovered Jeff Dunham.  He is an amazing comedian and ventriloquist.  My whole family loves him and his characters.  It's hard to choose - Peanut is extremely happy and laughing, Jose Jalepeno  on a stick is his sidekick, Walter the old man is always grumpy, Achmed the dead terrorist is not so scary I love his eyes, bubba is a redneck,  AJ is achmeds half dead son, Then  put them all together and celebrate christmas like never before.  It had us laughing through out the whole tape.  I recommend this to anyone who needs to be cheered up and to have a good laugh.  I now own all of his shows that are on dvd.",1400630400,,629,4.3076923076923075
3541066,3,B001DWNUII,"I have most of Jeff Dunham's videos and even saw him at the Tacoma Dome. That being said, his jokes are getting rather repetitive and stale. Yes, he does have a bit of fun with the Christmas theme, but its still mostly a rehash of jokes from previous videos and performances. Its fine if you simply want a hard copy. I suggest saving the money and watching it on youtube.",1400371200,,371,4.314285714285714

I initially went to amazon.com and couldn't find it, so, I went to Jeff Dunham's website and ordered it there, just to find out I was getting it from amazon in a round- about way.

3541102,5,B001DWNUII,Love the comedy watch it more for his ability to cast his voice . The choice of characters is enlightning,1390780800,,105,4.3
3541103,5,B001DWNUII,"Jeff Dunham displays such an incredible talent his shows always keep me in awe. Of course, the ability to throw his voice and to quickly jump between characters is mind-blowing but his humor is so relevant and funny it keeps even the biggest skeptic coming back for more. This Christmas special is no exception. Dunham along with guitar guy engage and interact with Dunham's puppets to create a bizarre, hilarious surreal world of fun. The relationship Dunham has with each of the charactyers he has created is nothing short of amazing and is the foundation for the success he has onstage. Although, Dunham's work must be incredibly exhausting, this fan is hoping Dunham is working even harder on new bits and characters and I am looking forward to what comes next.",1390348800,,765,4.847328244274809

3541123,5,B001DWNUII,"As much as I don't like puppets...this is somewhat exceptional and  my brother was happy enough to own a DVD. He loves Christmas as well, so the double theme works well.

3541141,4,B001DWNUII,I didn't think this one is nearly as entertaining as his earlier dvd's.  The earlier dvd's had me laughing till tears ran down my face.  This one just didn't have the same effect.,1384992000,,179,4.393939393939394

3541160,2,B001DWNUII,"I was expecting it to have a real holiday theme but it was very lacking. The Achmed the Terrorist part was funny but the rest of it was very disappointing. I have always liked Jeff Dunham's work but his stand up alone jokes were not funny, and talking about his daughter getting her driver's license just didn't get it, and it really lacked any Christmas holiday appeal. I expected it to tie in with the holiday theme and be funny. I think more thought could have been put into actually making it give a holiday feel and the jokes should have tied in with that. But the Achmed part was a good. I wouldn't advise anyone not to buy this, but buy it knowing that it is not going to be a holiday classic, in my opinion anyway. I hope Jeff Dunham comes out with a second holiday one, but one with a lot of Christmas jokes and feel to it. Keep us laughing Jeff.",1381536000,4,855,4.1878787878787875

3541316,5,B001DWNUII,"One of the funniest things I have ever seen in my entire life. I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe, my face and stomach hurt and I had to stop the DVD for a visit to the Ladies.
Achmed is still my Numero Uno--with ""Poliosis"". Walter was edged this time by Peanut for my Numero Dos. (You have to see the ""Nyquil and Red Bull"" skit to believe it.) Bubba J was hilarious. The Guitar Guy sent the whole thing over the top. Waaay over the top.
I've watched it several times since receiving it a few weeks ago, have loaned it out to friends--with the threat of ""Poliosis"" if I don't get it back. I'll probably need to get another DVD in a few months because I've worn this one out.
This is for anybody who needs a little bit of laughter in her/his lives. Correction: so much laughter you'll be sore the next day. Put this on your Christmas Wish List. You gotta have it.",1352592000,,864,4.179640718562874

3541319,5,B001DWNUII,"We love Jeff Dunham. We have almost all his DVDs. This may be his best.
Anyone with a teenager will love his opening monologue, when he talks
about his teenage daughter filling her gas tank for the first time.
His routine with Achmed and Guitar Guy is hilarious.

Peanut, Walter, Achmed and Jose (oh yeah, Jeff too) are laugh out loud funny. Your going to laugh so hard, you just might pee yourself. Jeff does such a good job that you forget that his buddies aren't real. I now own all of his DVDs and can't wait for the next one. Jeff is one talented guy!",1347321600,,459,4.111111111111111

3541323,4,B001DWNUII,"I am a huge Jeff Dunham fan and always will, but I think it would be fair of the DVD people to allow the people to have a choice between a bleep and unbleep show.  The special is still very funny and I give it four stars of course only taking away the one star because of the bleeps.  I also enjoy the puppets singing made the show even funnier.  So if your into the comedian Dunham and willing to put up with the bleeps then get this DVD and enjoy it for yourself or with people you care about, and make yourself a better Christmas with the DVD.",1338681600,,546,3.9908256880733943

Bought ""Spark of Insanity"" and that is a dvd I would recommend but this Christmas special was not that funny.  There were a few parts with Walter and Achmed the dead terrorist that were somewhat funny but most of the other parts of the program were dull and I didn't appreciate the sexual content of some of the performance.  I wish I had my money back.",1338681600,,423,4.329113924050633

Walter, an old curmudgeon with a face like a prune, refuses to say anything nice about Christmas.
Achmed, the dead terrorist, sings Jingle Bombs.
Bubba J, a beer swilling NASCAR fan, sings Road Kill Christmas.
Peanut, who is something alien, I think, ""helps"" Jeff read ""Twas the Night Before Christmas."" He also cracks up Guitar Guy completely.
Jose Jalapeno in a stick, tells how Christmas is celebrated in Mexico.",1336867200,,508,4.906976744186046

I was not happy.,1326326400,,248,3.8823529411764706
3541333,5,B001DWNUII,The extra footage not seen on Comedy Central makes this DVD so worth the price. It is classic Jeff Dunham. So hilarious!!!  It'll keep you laughing in stitches from beginning to end.  You have GOT to see this DVD!!!,1325980800,,215,4.487179487179487

What Amazon doesn't say is this is a censored copy from Comedy Central; I don't buy a DVD to get a ""bleeped"" version.

I saw several of his shows back then and they were a blast to watch.
Walter's the best <3. However out of all his DVDS that I have in my collection, it's definitely not his best. Maybe it would be more fun to watch it during the Christmas season. Overall, I had a few chuckles here and there, but not hysterical laughs in Arguing with myself dvd or sparks of insanity.

So I bought the dvd, and he was right, there was a lot left out.  I was much more satisfied with this than the one they showed on TV.  I'm not really much of a Bubba-J fan, but his skit was pretty good.  Achmed was good also, and as always, Peanut!",1273104000,,420,3.8488372093023258

3541393,5,B001DWNUII,"Jeff is a master at bringing humor into your life. If you have not spent the time discovering him you have been at a loss. He will touch a wide range of topics while making us laugh at ourselves and all around us. All of his characters come from all areas of life and his genius mind.
Walter is an old man with an aged warped outlook of what he sees around him while Peanut(being the young one)whose innocence will bring tears of laughter to your eyes. Achmed, the terrorist, will make you think you will die from laughter. This disk is a wonderful start into this master Comedian/Ventriloquist/Artist who,by the way, creates and makes his own characters. If he comes to a city near you just one do one thing for yourself...Go see him",1246752000,,734,4.444444444444445

3541403,1,B001DWNUII,"Allow me to begin by saying I used to be a Jeff Dunham fan.

I owned several of his recordings and loved to share them with others when entertaining. I was more than excited when I had the chance to preorder my copy of this DVD last year. That was, until I watched it in a diverse group of company the week before Christmas during a holiday party.

Mr. Dunham has apparently lost his gift of humor. What was once proven as true brilliance on his part, Jeff thought less of our joy of his wit and filled this DVD complete with racially offensive material, religiously offensive jokes and just plain dirty filthy junk. Now mind you, I know his work and I am not offended by awkward humor. But this DVD managed to single out every human being on Earth and knock them down to dirt level as you could even see by the faces on the audience and a few badly edited ""boos"" in the sound.

I hope that Mr. Dunham learns a lesson from this and makes good on a new set of jokes for next time.",1241395200,2,979,4.1421052631578945
3541404,3,B001DWNUII,"It's not the uncensored one and does not have all the special features that my friends copy does, most notably the bloopers. I believe it said in the description that it was the uncensored edition and that it did have the bloopers.",1241049600,,231,4.523809523809524

3541410,3,B001DWNUII,"It really shows on this disc that when you put out a good DVD, and then a terrific and hilarious next one you would consider a classic, you just can't keep up the pace with what people expect.

This X-mas one is OK, it has it's moments, but if you try to compare it to his other two shows, it is not quite up to scratch.

If you are a new Dunham fan, and have not seen him before, you could start with this one, then go onto the other 2 to see it just get funnier and funnier, but if you have seen the other 2 already, don't have too high a hopes for this one having you on the floor laughing like before.",1238630400,2,605,3.832
3541411,5,B001DWNUII,"A necessary purchase for any Jeff Dunham fan.  Even though I have both previous DVDs, I still laughed until I couldn't breathe.  Quite a bit of material here that was not shown on the Comedy Central broadcast.

A note of caution; if you are a fan of the political correctness movement, you'll probably find some of the material a bit offensive.  Lighten up and enjoy a good laugh.",1237766400,,380,4.544117647058823

Yes there is a small amt of bad language but he is very clean compared to some.",1237248000,,304,4.490909090909091
3541416,5,B001DWNUII,"Fans of Mr Dunhams multiple personalities will really enjoy this offering. The clear fan favorites from his previous two DVD releases are all back, with their unique takes on Christmas. The special caroles from Achmed the Dead Terrorist are hysterical. The addition of a second, human element to the show lets Jeff flex his comedic chops and timing, by doing his level best to crack up the ""Guitar Guy"".  The bonus features on the DVD let you actually see Jeff's lovely wife and his two younger daughters. His sixteen year old is probably absent in protest of the huge laugh her dad gets at her expense in his opening monologue. What can be said about Jeff Dunham?  How about ""More? PLEASE???!!!""",1237248000,,696,4.743801652892562

3541424,5,B001DWNUII,"Jeff Dunham is the most amazing ventriloquist I have seen. He gets you so into the dummies, that you just about believe that they are real. I had already watched Jeff on YouTube and decided I had to vote with my money and purchase his dvd. It is hilarious, of the ten people I had watch it with me, two of them spewed their drinks while watching it! That should be a new comedy rating! But Jeff is great and I would suggest that anyone that likes humor would like this. It does contain some adult content and language, so I don't recommend it for children. Too bad, I think he could come up with some good children humor with these dummies that could expand his fan base.",1236211200,,671,4.25

3541441,3,B001DWNUII,"Be forewarned...this DVD is not nearly as good as Jeff's first two DVD specials.

This clocks in at 90 minutes, and it does drag.  The sets were far too elaborate, and were not necessary.  In fact, the sets detracted from his skill as a ventriloquist.

We do see Jeff's family in this special...and it may have been nice for him; it wasn't necessary for us, the TV audience.

When viewed on Comedy Central, it is even worse due to the cuts made by CC due to time constraints.

Stick with his first two DVDs.  They were homeruns.  This effort was maybe a double at best.

I'd rate it at 2 1/2 stars.",1234137600,,598,4.267857142857143

The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it is censored.  It would have been nice if the dvd gave you an option to watch a censored or non-censored version.  You won't regret getting this and you will get much enjoyment and use out of it!",1232409600,,373,3.933333333333333

3541470,2,B001DWNUII,I have enjoyed Jeff Dunham and thought this would be a fun DVD.  I was very disappointed with it.  It definitly was not one of his funnier shows.  There were a couple laughs but mostly I found it stupid and stale.  Sorry Jeff you need better material.,1232409600,,251,4.276595744680851

3541472,1,B001DWNUII,"My oldest daughter's fiance' introduced Jeff Denham to my family. She asked for his DVDs for her birthday. After watching several excerpts, I refused because of his language. When I saw this DVD advertised as being for the whole family, I thought I'd give it a chance. What false advertisement that was (Or is that really what families today like?). We turned it off after the first 5 minutes. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. If you want good clean humor, go with Aaron Wilburn.",1232323200,4,483,4.5
3541473,5,B001DWNUII,"Jeff Dunham is the most talented comedian of our time and his Christmas Special is extremely funny. Walter and Bubba J sings Christmas Carols. Achmed sings ""Jingle Bombs"". Peanut helps Jeff tell a Christmas story. The guitar guy(Brian Haner)is an extremely talented guitar player. You will laugh till you cry!
We also highly recommend Jeff Dunham's Spark of Insanity and Arguing With Myself you will not be disappointed. Well worth the money if you enjoy laughing.",1232323200,,464,5.118421052631579

3541476,2,B001DWNUII,"I saw part of Achmed the Dead Terrorist and for the most part liked it, except for the part about giving people gifts that blow up and blowing up Santa Claus and the Christmas tree.  I rented the dvd because the cover said ""great for the entire family"", but I must forewarn parents that attitudes portrayed and some words, though considered ""mild"" by some, may be offensive still for Christian parents who hold higher standards.  I found the humor crude and disappointing, because I was hoping for family fare, which it is not!  Jeff Dunham mocks his daughter, making severe fun of her intelligence when he was relaying the story about her filling up her vehicle with gasoline for the first time.  There is sexual innuendo and lots of hells and damns and ""frickins"".  Crude references about urinating on people and drinking beer constantly.  If there is a bright side, at least I only rented it rather than bought it which would have been a waste of money.  Parents beware, it is NOT family fare!",1232236800,,996,4.6571428571428575

Of course, this should be viewed by people over 18 years old as it does contain some bad language but it is not too offensive.

I first saw Spark of Insanity but my teacher meant to show this one first. I only know 2 of the puppets. Walter who is always the opening puppet is one of my favorites. My friend can do a better version of him than I can. And I also know Achmed the Dead Terrorist. I'm not sure if his arm was supossed to come off before he asked Jeff to hold him. I do my own where I ask Walter how his New Year was and he says ""When the clock struck 12, I burped and fell asleep"".

This video contains material not seen on the Comedy Central special, so you are in for a great surprise!!  His stand-up in the beginning is funny as h*ll (especially if you are a parent to a teenager - you will definitely relate).

I have watched Lewis Black and other comedians specials on Comedy Central and you expect the language to be censored, but when you see the dvds, they're unedited. This one had all the bleeps in, just as if you were watching it on television. That was annoying and ruined it for us when we watched it. Had I known this in advance, I would not have purchased it. I could have recorded it on my dvr with the same result. I will think twice before buying another one of his dvds if this is how they're producing them. As good as the show was, it was disappointing at the same time.",1230854400,,655,4.248

3541558,3,B001DWNUII,I really like Jeff Dunham's humor but the Christmas Special is not for watching with little kids.  I wouldn't even let my 13 year old watch it.  The humor is very sexual.  I thought his Comedy Central shows were funnier.,1230768000,,220,4.45
3541559,4,B001DWNUII,"I really enjoyed Jeff Dunham's Christmas special.  If you are a fan of Jeff then you will love this DVD.  The work he does with his puppets is truly special.  Walter especially always keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The reason I gave this DVD four stars is just for the fact that it does not live up to Spark of Insanity.

If you are a first time Jeff Dunham fan then I suggest you get Spark of Insanity.  It is a better special.  However, this DVD is very good.  If you are a Jeff Dunham fan and have seen is work before then enjoy Christmas Special, I just don't think you will walk away laughing quite as much as Spark of Insanity.",1230595200,,639,4.056

3541567,3,B001DWNUII,"I purchased this DVD for my dad as a Christmas present because he's a big fan of Jeff Dunham. And I figured this DVD would be as good as Arguing With Myself and Spark of Insanity.
Well, sorry to say that that wasn't the case. I thought that it was ok, but it was dull and boring.
There were some times where I did laugh and my dad laughed. But the DVD was just boring. Jeff probably spent more time talking about his daughter in the intro than the puppets did onstage. I just couldn't help but yawn at times.
And what was really the big problem for me with the DVD were the BLEEPS whenever the puppets said something bad. I can understand why that's convenient when there are kids around, but when there are just adults watching, those bleeps aren't necessary. The DVD would have been better without the bleeps, seriously.
Overall, the DVD was ok, but it wasn't that great. Arguing With Myself and Spark of Insanity were simply way better than this DVD.",1230336000,,953,4.389830508474576

After he was through watching the DVD, he asked his grandfather if he would make him an Achmed...yeah, right!  Just this past weekend he was walking around quoting the different characters...Peanut, Bubba J and Achmed.  We have also watched this with my 80-year-old father.  He also enjoyed it.

I have watched all 3 of his DVD's and liked them so well I gave them as Christmas presents to most of my relatives and friends.

I haven't seen the bonus features yet, but the main feature almost put me to sleep in spots.

The theme is dark for a Christmas special, and much of the material is more adult oriented. Some things that really bothered my twelve year old was the recurring references to drugs, sex and swearing. Don't get me wrong-there's some funny stuff for sure, but this is better suited for the grown-ups.

Overall, you're better off getting the CD called Don't come home for Christmas. It has a lot more music, only one bleeped swear and no drug references (except beer).",1229040000,,562,4.509803921568627

I am so glad that I previewed it first.  It definitely is not family fare.  There is a lot of swearing and off-color jokes.  I guess whoever produced this dvd figured that by bleeping out the worst offending vulgarities it would qualify as family entertainment.  I do not agree. Both my husband and I shut it off before it was over.  We were very disappointed with it and feel like we threw our money out the window. This dvd will go in the trash.,1228867200,3,589,4.27027027027027

What you saw on tv was a watered down version of the actual show and not nearly as funny as it really was.  Jeff's opening act was completely cut and each character's set was heavily curtailed.

My only real gripe with the dvd is that it doesn't do away with the bleeping.  Not that it's a major issue; its just annoying to buy something that's been censored like that.  But I guess they're trying to keep it as family friendly as possible.

I bought this on Amazon, based on the title (""Family Fun"") and all the rave reviews.  I sat down to watch it with my husband and our 10- and 8-year old kids.  I WAS MORTIFIED.  First of all, Jeff finds a way to offend every minority and women.  Second, many many words are bleeped out, but even so, little is left to the imagination.  And finally, the skits that included Guitar Guy were completely UN-funny, but he and Jeff were cracking up over themselves (either they were stoned, or they were banking on the idea that laughter is contagious).

More than anything, I was disappointed.  I had been looking for a fun Christmas DVD - the idea of a ventriloquist doing a Christmas program was appealing, but I guess even puppets aren't sacred anymore!  I wish I could return the DVD.  I feel like I was duped!

Jeff Dunham is extremely talented, and perhaps some might find his humor amusing (if they live in a red state!) but for me, it was a complete waste.",1228694400,5,1051,4.38860103626943

Was sad that the content was so often sexual/racy. He's such a funny and talented guy - I don't think he has to go down that road. Maybe it was the venue he was hosting that prompted the material.

There are a few complaints, and this is why I only gave it four stars.  As many have said, I wish they would not have bleeped out the profanity, it takes away from the performance.  Also, I had to turn the volume up really loud in order to hear it.  No, I don't have any hearing issues, but it seems the sound quality of the DVD is not the greatest.

3541818,2,B001DWNUII,"Dunham is outstanding, but this special seemed to fall flat for me. Achmed wanted a hug ... The guitar guy segment, while amusing, was not as good as the YouTube clip where you could tell it was fresh.  Walter's time was short and I tend to think he sets up the other puppets for success. Reading the x-mas story with Peanut was ok...

I just couldn't get a common thread through it all ... There was no lotion to link the act together or blue frickin prius to make fun of.

So, for me, it fell flat as several short acts instead of something of a story from different points of view. And that scaredy cat Achmed was just disturbing.",1227571200,7,633,4.258333333333334
3541819,5,B001DWNUII,"I haven't seen the DVD yet as I just ordered it so this is more of a comment on other comments. But, personally I think it's very sad that people can't seem to enjoy good comedy without swearing or *dramatic gasp* heaven forbid with some bleeps in there. It's not like you don't know what the words are and the profanity isn't the 'meat' of the joke it just accents it. Most of the 'bad' reviews I've seen are not because it's not up to par with Jeff's other stuff but because you can't hear the profanity. There's some horrible horrible horrible comedies out there and I say if bleeped profanit really is the worst part of the DVD then that's pretty awesome.  I must be insane but I don't need swears for something to be funny to me. It's pretty sad that you actually need to hear that profanity to make the DVD 'good'.",1227484800,,820,4.290322580645161
3541820,3,B001DWNUII,"As others have mentioned, Jeff's other two performances were more enjoyable. This special seemed rushed, with no transitions between characters, and too much time was spent filming Jeff trying to contain his own laughter. As these skits were performed at several test venues prior to filming, I didn't find Jeff's reactions to his own jokes entertaining.

Much was made of the audience's reaction. I get that Jeff is popular, but I don't want to see the audience whoop and holler for 20 seconds in anticipation of Achmed stating he has a song. Or whenever Jeff introduces a new character. Yet Jose Jalapeno's skit felt like it was cut off almost mid-sentence.

I found the ""bleeping"" of censored words irritating and erratic. For example, A**H*** was bleeped, but B***h wasn't.

It's a much more commercial endeavor in that one of the ""special features"" was an exhortation to go online to view the Dunham store. The other features weren't noteworthy. One clip shows audience members asking ""Santa Walter"" pre-selected questions. One shows Jeff and his family members launching T-shirts into the audience with some air cannons. One shows some prep work that goes into the photography session and a green screen introduction. It could have been interesting, except it was more of a montage of two second clips of some of the people involved.

It was ok. If this is your first Dunham DVD, you'll enjoy watching it. If it's not, you may be disappointed in how rushed it feels and how the jokes lean more towards the snarky side.",1227484800,4,1524,4.895348837209302

Jeff brought out his main charadcters and they are wonderful. I wish he had added Melvin the Super Hero having an encounter with Santa.
Guitar Guy is wonderful and it is great to see Jeff try to break him up. The DVD is worth it just for the Achmed bits about his diseases.

His previous disks have so much funny stuff about real people, and all kinds of people, so we could all relate. This one tends to really target, with mean/almost angry humor, specific groups of people. The only part of this disk I really enjoyed was when ""Guitar Guy"" was on stage and cracking up.

3541834,3,B001DWNUII,"I caught by Jeff Dunham by his amazing multiple puppet control and ends with wine drinking trick, since then, Jeff Dunham became my first most respected comedian, which can be found in youtube or metacafe.  Arguing with Myself (AWM) and Spark of Insanity (SOI) never failed me, it is brilliant, impressed me so much that I can watch it over again and again and I still won't get tired of it, that's how good AWM and SOI are, 5 stars I gave to that DVDs.

I preordered the triple pack Blu-Ray version of Jeff Dunham trilogy, plus Don't Come Home For Christmas (audio CD), despite the fact that I've owned the AWM and SOI DVD.  However, I have cancelled it, and I tell you why.

First, in Very Special Christmas Special (VSCS), the actual runtime is 85 minutes, that is the minus some of the draggy part (eg JD try to hold his laugh, I accept it if it is a test material, JD should have well prepared for this before the recording), not-so-funny Christmas songs (Roadkill Christmas, The Night Before Christmas), basically it is boiled down to less than 30mins of worth of actual material.

Second, the performance is censored with the annoying beep!  But Amazon.com is cleary stated this DVD as ""Unrated"".  It cought me in surprise and it is an extremely serious flaw that made all the punch lines no longer enjoyable.  I wonder what is Jeff Dunham going to say or explain about this.

Third, Jeff Dunham sets an extremely high standard in AWM and SOI, just that VSCS just couldn't achieve the previous standard has been set by the two prequels.

Fourth, the performance is unpolished.  We don't expect Jeff to hold his laugh on his own joke (This is a finalised recording, not test materials);  The whole thing is extremely rush and short; cheatsheets were used.

This version is NOT RECOMMENDED as the main problem of this release is censorship is imposed by annoying beep - WHAT THE *BEEP!*, which killed the entire performance and punch lines are dead.

if you don't mind the censored beep, it is a good buy for you.

if you are a first timer to Jeff Dunham, I recommend you try Arguing with Myself and Spark of Insanity first.

WHY!?  is there a total different edition that i can get that doesn't have the stupid bleeps in it?  maybe with more special features besides the little clips of making of...the making of part would have been so much better if it wasn't small snippits and quick cuts.,1227052800,,372,4.36231884057971

3541837,4,B001DWNUII,"Ventriloquist Jeff Dunham's latest DVD features his big three -- Walter, Peanut & Achmed -- for a light-hearted adult comedy that breaks up the stress of holiday season.

Filmed before a live audience at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, WI, the show doesn't cover a lot of new territory but die-hard fans won't be disappointed because Jeff incorporates new jokes into his famous group of adult puppets.

If this your first experience with Jeff's ventriloquist comedy, you should also try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jeff-Dunham-Arguing-With-Myself/dp/B000E5LEXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jeff Dunham - Arguing With Myself</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jeff-Dunham-Spark-of-Insanity/dp/B000S6LS66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity</a>.

Now for the bad news:  It's not uncensored!!  There are plenty of swear words in this special and being a comedy fan, I like to have my comedy be as filthy as possible.  But that request was both fulfilled and unfulfilled.  Plus I couldn't help but notice that there was a sticker on the box that said ""Fun for the Entire Family.""  I DON'T THINK SO!

The only fault I can find with this presentation I have is the censor (bleeps)that were inserted. Why didn't they offer a choice like the last dvd to turn the bleeps on and off? It may be fine for tv, but if I buy a dvd, I prefer it to not be censored.",1226793600,,413,3.9879518072289155

3541849,5,B001DWNUII,"PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE CONCERT MATERIAL THAT IS ON THE DVD!

I had the great opportunity to take my girlfriend to a Sold-Out performance of Jeff Dunham this past Sunday evening in Reno, Nevada, and let me tell you, I am still laughing and my sides are still hurting and it has been 24 hours since the show.

Jeff came out and entertained the audience for almost two solid hours of continuous hilarious performances from Walter, Achmed, Peanut, and Bubba Jay. This is simply the most fun I have had in a very long time.

The routines were so well done and the characters so life-like that it is easy to forget that they are not real and merely the product of a comedic genius. Dunham is so talented that he could very easily be perhaps the greatest ventriloquist of all time.

It would be remiss of me to go into a lot of detail concerning the routines, but suffice to say that if you look on YouTube under ""Jeff Dunham Jingle Bombs,"" you will find one of the funniest scenes from this DVD. But hey, don't take my word for it, just pick up Jeff's first two DVD's;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jeff-Dunham-Arguing-With-Myself/dp/B000E5LEXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jeff Dunham - Arguing With Myself</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jeff-Dunham-Spark-of-Insanity/dp/B000S6LS66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity</a>, and see for yourself the brilliance that is Jeff Dunham!

What an experience if you've never seen him live.  I want to go again!!  Only this time I'd love to have seats closer than what we had (we were in that balcany).  I can't think of another comedian I'd drive the distance for and stay over night to see than Jeff!  For the idiot that rated him one star what can I say... DUMBASS as Walter would say!!!
