8205799,2,B000SLPVZU,"While I liked the fact there are ""Lots and Lots of Playful Penguins,"" I was really bothered by the rapid editing.

Much of this video only shows the penguins for 5 seconds then it cuts to another scene for 5 seconds, and so on and so on.  I would not be surprised if watching this video could cause someone to go into seizures because the editing is so rapid.

Other than that, the photography is nothing special and there is no real reason to own this video.  It looks like it was made to be used as wallpaper for parents who want to plop their toddlers in front of the television instead of spending time with them.

Unless your kids suffer from ADD, I cannot imagine anyone enjoying this video.",1386115200,,697,4.3307692307692305

8205802,5,B000SLPVZU,"Penguins have always been one of my favorite animals.  Maybe it had something to do with the way I first walked, but I've always liked penguins.  In the past few years there have been a slew of movies featuring penguins: e.g. MARCH OF THE PENGUINS, SURF'S UP, and HAPPY FEET and as a result children seem to like penguins more than ever.  LOTS AND LOTS OF PLAYFUL PENGUINS is a children's DVD that was not only made just to entertain kids, but to also hopefully help them learn something.  The DVD has a format of  ""music videos"" featuring mostly live-action footage of penguins that are broken-up with educational bits about each of the seventeen different species of penguins.  The music videos aren't real music videos, but are fun and upbeat original songs (most of which were written by James Coffey) playing against footage of live penguins. The opening music video is a bit different as it features animated penguins moving and dancing to the song ""Party Like a Penguin"". The educational segments that are woven beaten the various musical chapters discuss 2-3 penguins.  The average size and weight of each penguin is given along with lots of other trivia about each species.  In addition, these segments also have an audio component that allows viewers to listen to the different cries and calls of the different penguin species.  About halfway through the DVD, there is some footage of an actual ""penguin parade"" taking place in Australia.

Special features on the DVD include an option of just playing the educational bits and an old-time cartoon about four sibling penguins whose curiosity leads them into fiery trouble.  I'm glad the option of playing the educational bits is included. It's a nice option for older children who probably aren't as interested in dancing all the time.  Also, if used in a classroom as part of a lesson plan it allows for a teacher to spend time on the educational parts of the DVD without having to fast-forward through the music and dancing.

Overall, LOTS AND LOTS OF PLAYFUL PENGUINS is a great children's DVD. It's better than just turning on the television because it gives young children the option to sing and dance along with penguins, while at the same time giving them the opportunity to learn about penguins. The structure of the DVD is well-paced and it's clear that the makers are aware of how the minds of children operate.  Highly recommended for children who enjoy penguins are those who seem to have an interest in nature.",1267488000,,2482,4.82311320754717
