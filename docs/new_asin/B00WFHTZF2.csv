8713122,1,B00WFHTZF2,If you are going to do a science program you should first under science. I could only stomach so much of this program before I had to turn it off. I think it was near where the narrator said that the proton had a positive charge and that neutrons and electrons had negative charge.,1486252800,,281,4.222222222222222
8713123,5,B00WFHTZF2,"This documentary is for the agnostic and existentialist.  It presents both sides, science and religion, posing philosophical questions about the existence of the universe.  The science is accurate.  It asks questions such as what is the point of knowing more and more about all of God's particles because the question of why we have these particles (and not others) will still be there.  What if knew everything about every fundamental particle?  Would that stop war?  Would that stop religion?",1472428800,,494,5.189873417721519
8713124,1,B00WFHTZF2,"I'm not sure how this ""film"" made it past post production. At one point it states that ""protons, NEURONS, and electrons make up atoms"". What editor let that one slip by?  It also stated (at least calling the neutron a neutron this time) that protons, neutrons, and electrons ""orbit the nucleus of an atom"".  Really?? Two of those comprise the nucleus.  I had to turn this error-laden junk off not 1/2 way through. Copious errors, no proofing, and horrible engineering through the small portion I could stand to watch. Music over-powering the speech of and Obama segment...please tell me this was some high school production team's project that somehow made it through to a hand full of streaming services?",1466553600,,705,4.907563025210084
8713125,1,B00WFHTZF2,"Not even psuedoscience, it is so bad. A high school physics class debunks this movie. If you are smarter than a 5th grader, you'll see through this garbage. I watched it on Hulu, as much as I could stand. But the filmmakers have posted it on YouTube, also.

At 16:00, the narrator claims the neutron has a negative electric charge. Derp. I suggest you jump to there so you don't have to suffer through 16 minutes of crap about ""undying faith"" and how bad things are.

Naturally, comments are disabled. What a shock. They haven't disabled up/down votes, yet.

I can't link to YouTube, but you can look it up there.",1462060800,,613,4.504504504504505
8713126,1,B00WFHTZF2,"I had to turn this off halfway through. When I got to the part where they claim that neutrons have a negative charge, and that they along with protons and electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom, I could feel my intelligence radically diminishing. I fear that had I left this on much longer that I may have ended up with scientific a understanding normally reserved for politics; which, is what this ""documentary"" appears to be, less of an educational / speculative piece and more of a politically biased opinion piece of one persons misunderstanding of science and the world around them.",1452470400,2,587,4.764705882352941
8713127,5,B00WFHTZF2,"Wonderful education on what evidence was discovered by the Hubble.  Jun 18, 2007 - Hubble has picked up galaxies that are 10 billion light ... This is sort of like saying it has seen that far.  Jun 18, 2007 - Hubble has picked up galaxies that are 10 billion light ...

8713128,1,B00WFHTZF2,"Who ever wrote the script doesn't even have a middle school education in science. ""The protons and neurons are made up of even smaller particles."" ""The protons, neutrons, and electrons orbit the center of the atom."" Ouch! Couldn't take it anymore. Absolutely horrible.",1447113600,2,268,5.255813953488372
8713129,1,B00WFHTZF2,Silly drivel about vegan diets disguised as science.,1443830400,2,52,5.625
8713130,1,B00WFHTZF2,"If I could I would give it zero stars. It came across to me as a B level propaganda movie supporting a vegan diet and little to do with particle physics.
He is trying to use religion and physics as a reason that you shouldn't eat your pet cat. No joke there.",1441411200,4,258,3.980769230769231
