8505322,5,B006W39O3I,"As with all of their DVDs, this is a great performance from fairly early in their career. Some tracks I had never heard before like ""Never Too Late"". There's a nice little acoustic interlude of Let's Go Crazy, Love Light, Teardrops in the Rain and a totally reworked folk version of a.ri.ga.tou. that is just awesome. And I always love it when JungShin gets to spend some time in the spotlight like Love Revolution. I guess this DVD is out of print and can be a little difficult to find, so snap up it while you have the chance. The only thing missing in English subs. It's a shame Warner Japan doesn't seem to think it's worth having them on any of their releases.",1427241600,,665,4.370967741935484

JongHyun fans will be specially blown out with his impressive talented performance.

The only problem, in my opinion, is that this DVD should have eng subs for non-japanese viewers as their korean DVDs have.",1335657600,3,266,4.782608695652174
