8447810,5,B004XZQYFS,"Lee Morrison is one of the leading combatives instructors in the UK, this video was a collaboration between Lee and America's top combatives expert Kelly McCann. McCann only does the intro, but he offered Lee the opportunity to do a super high quality film at his facility in collaboration with Paladin Press. If McCann promotes somebody, I don't need to worry about if they are the real deal. Lee covers predominantly stand-up fighting drills in this video, with the assistance of 2 Marines. His methods are highly aggressive and he emphasizes speed, offense, and control, as well as max situation awareness. He keeps the techniques simple and effective. Lee knows that of which he speaks and is highly skilled. This is not a conventional martial artist trying to adapt ancient  esoteric skills to modern street scenarios. This IS COMBATIVES, based largely on the culmination of western hand to hand combat and the simplest, most effective Eastern techniques (mainly Ju Jujitsu and Judo) developed for Allied commandos in WWII. It is one of the most effective, ever evolving systems available.

Lee worked many years as a doorman in the UK, a very rough profession in Europe, and he knows what works. He's ridiculously fast and he's battled and been bloodied in the real world; he can do more than his share of damage...no armchair expert. He also emphasizes simplicity and aggression, rather then 1000 techniques and waiting for the attack. Don't hesitate on his vids. They are well worth the money. This is his first directly American video set. He has many of lower production quality, but still of ultra high quality content, available from the UK. I'd recommend any of them, but I'd probably get this set first.

Also, At the end of the video there is a quick skit of Lee demonstrating proper response, control, and escape from a bar scene. It was a nice little cherry on top. Morrison, like McCann, is a true professional and warrior. He is not well known here yet but I believe with the start of this American offering, he will be. He is a fountain of knowledge, buy the vids and soak some of it up.",1324166400,9,2107,4.782967032967033
