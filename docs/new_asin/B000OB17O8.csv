8389678,4,B000OB17O8,"I have thoroughly enjoyed watching this selection of events in Lord Krishna's boyhood with my family.  The prequel film in the series, ""Krishna: the Birth"" was a well-animated and detailed synopsis of events leading to Lord Vishnu's incarnation as the infant Krishna. However, the events portrayed were, necessarily, of a violent and perhaps largely political nature that children under 10 would not sit through well or even understand.  This is not true of ""Makhan Chor"" (the Butter Thief).  My sensitive 5 year old and her friends were --mostly-- not bothered by the portrayal of the daemons here, although the subject matter of Kansa's talk of infantocide is something I have skipped in the DVD scenes much of the time. The story is still very complex for a younger child to grasp, but even younger children can appreciate the cuteness and coyness of the baby Krishna, the adorable songs, and Krishna's precocious pranks, as well as his abiding love for his mother.
  The film is in Hindi with English subtitles optional, and as though my family understand the spoken language only partially, we are still able to follow it well and the littler ones learn and sing the songs. Our DVD box featured a removable Baby Krishna cardboard wall sticker which the young kids seem to love.

  I would recommend this for children ages 5 to 10 who have Indian Hindu families or who have interest in Vedic stories.",1207526400,2,1404,4.869747899159663
