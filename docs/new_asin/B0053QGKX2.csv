8455606,5,B0053QGKX2,I bought the DVD years ago when my oldest was just two years old. My plan was to watch it with her when she was older. With the start of a new school year we've viewed it again. Only this time her younger sister who is 6 joined us. I cannot emphasize to them enough what a gift it is to have access to quality education and adults who will shepard their growth.,1378598400,2,361,3.958904109589041
