3078482,5,B00127R2YC,"The series starts off with loads of action and is basically revolving around main character, Train and his exploits with the Chronos organization that he works for.  Throw in a couple characters (Sven, Renslet) that he comes to know and care for and an additional one that he likes but not really in that way.  Things only get that much more interesting.  It's great to see Funimation and Gonzo come up with this excellent anime series.

Also of note is the character Eve as she is central to this story and comes into their lives after an accident happens. She grows to be a major addition to this cast of ecentric characters that also include other sweepers and numbers (numbered characters of the Chronos organization that Train is a part of).

Great start, middle and ending as well.  It really makes for an all around, well rounded, hilarious yet touching series that should be watched as soon as you have the chance.",1224115200,2,922,4.660493827160494
3078483,5,B00127R2YC,"Black cat was quite a surprise. I certainly wasn't expecting to thoroughly enjoy it from beginning to end. My criticism of anime is sometimes a bit severe. It feels as though I'm picking through the trash to find a really great series much of the time. Well, I definitely found a keeper in Black cat. The main characters were all awesome. There was always something exciting going on. I doubt many, if any, will be disappointed with this purchase. This is a great price too.",1217808000,2,474,4.588235294117647
3078484,5,B00127R2YC,Black Cat came as a huge surprise for me! I had just finished watching Deathnote and was in search of something new when I stumbled upon this... I figured I'd give it a try and boy was I glad I did... The storyline has several great plot turns and the humor is top notch! Overall one of the best series I've ever seen!,1217030400,,318,4.063492063492063
3078485,5,B00127R2YC,"I got to say it was a great series, plot, art, voice acting just awesome, no real extras, but alittle to fast on the episodes ploting. Funimation does it again by picking another great series and great actors for the series. It is great don't get me wrong but the series ended to fast for me. I think they could of done at least 4-8 more episodes for the right closure of the series. But that's how most of the anime is now and then, they just get a short time to make the series. So I'm not to mad about it. This is a awesome series and anime and the manga is great too.
Well when you watch the first episodes you just get hooked it was just man I couldn't stop watchng it. I just got this series a week ago and watched the whole series in one day. On my only day off man. I couldn't stop watching it. I didn't even go shoot pool and drink with my friends like I do on my day off. Man was they mad dude. :P.

Anyways Train is not like Samurai X ok. If Everybody wanted to say someone was copying someone. Everyone has a idea of

1) A girl and guy meets, boy and girl don't like each other, later boy and girl slowly fall in love.

2) Boy and girl long time friends and find out they was in love.

3) Boy and girl meet and girl falls in love with boy, Boy doesn't like girl but later realize he loves her more than he know.

4) Boy and girl fall in love and have to fight to stay together.

5) Boy and girl fall in love, girl dies or boy dies, then wants revenge or saver on one self.

Ok you get it now right. Many series have the idea but the ploting of how and what happens in the time of all this is what makes it great. I was glad to see Saya for a short time in the series. It was sad to see what happened to her. But understand this is not like samurai X just because it go's a different way of the idea. She is always with him in his mind and heart so you start to feel the pain more with him through out the series. It makes you understand truely what was happening to him and how he felt, even if he never said anything you can tell. As well the idea of what she did in the time she was with him. Even after she is gone. It is alittle sad only on that. Nothing else really is sad in this series to me. I fell in love with everyone in this series and it was sad to see it end. I'm glad to see the anime of a manga set which is not yet complete to come alive. So check it out and it's not Kenshin dude, you just don't know what your talking about dude. Train weird name but he is so kwel man alot of the characters was so kwel, but he was just the best man. I like the name Black Cat too. ;p later

THIS IS WELL WORTH TO WATCH AND THE MONEY, BUT I WOULD BUY IT SOME WHERE ELSE TO. SORRY AMAZON BUT I DO BUY MANGA FROM YOU. ;P",1211673600,3,2733,3.7824561403508774

They've been able to make a new version without destroying the original plot like so many anime have before. If you don't mind the changes it's great to see the action in fluid motion along with the original black and white panels. This is a great addition to any anime collection and I look forward to watching this series many times to come.",1207008000,3,425,4.325
3078489,5,B00127R2YC,"If you are a red blooded male you will like this series. When I bought this set I was a little apprehensive because I had not heard anything about it. However, after the first couple of episodes, which build the storyline, this show starts to really pick up the pace, and it never slows down. If you have enjoyed series like Rurouni Kenshin and Outlaw Star then you'll love this, as it is, in my opinion a combination of the two at least with regard to the themes it has. For fans of shonen anime with epic battles and valuable lessons, the Black Cat box set is a must see.",1206316800,17,573,4.218181818181818

3078604,5,B00127R2YC,"Not every anime has a great beginning. Monsters first episode was very good but there were no signs of that becoming a classic until the fourth episode. Triguns first episode was underwhelming to say the least, filled with over-the-top gunfights and a Whos the real Vash? plotline that quickly turned dull, but the second episode, for me, was what really kicked off the series. From the first episode, from the very beginning, you can tell that Black Cat is special, but this animes plot, on the surface, is one of the most generic imaginable. Young hero witnesses a loved one being killed and the hero embarks on a fury-filled journey for revenge (Tell me you haven't heard that one before), but theres so much more to Black Cat than what youd expect from a summary like the aforementioned one. Black Cat is an action-oriented anime with major focuses on comedy and drama, and even a hint of romance.

Like the plot, Black Cats four central characters appear as cookie cutter models often seen in other anime. At first glance, the protagonist is the brooding young adult, Sven is the cool guy, Eves the quiet one, and Rinslets the kind but loudmouthed young woman. Theres more to these characters than the models will lead you to believe, especially for Train Heartnet, the protagonist. Codenamed Black Cat, Train is an infamous assassin for the shady organization Chronos, cold-bloodedly taking lives with Hades the handgun, until he is influenced by the beautiful Saya, an experienced sweeper (bounty hunter), to sever ties with Chronos and his lifestyle of bloodshed. At the series start, Train is a certified loner, his hobby gazing thoughtfully at the moon, drinking cold bottles of milk while awaiting his next assignment. A self-described stray cat roaming, Train, in his journey, is revealed to have more layers to his character, at times a carefree traveler with an often-hungry stomach, and in fights a confident challenger with strength, agility, and marksmanship on his side. Train Heartnet is an interesting character in a show filled with them.

Sure, Trains an amazing protagonist, but what really elevates Black Cat overall is the focus on the other characters. Eve is the blond-haired android of few words, a lover of books and fireworks, someone whos filled with kindness but isn't afraid to fight either. Sven Vollfied is my favorite character, a veteran sweeper with an eye-patch, green hair, a secret power, a tragic past, a really laid-back personality, a briefcase filled with weapons, and a gentlemans code he really doesnt want to break. Rinslet Walker is Black Cats sole weak spot in characterization, a gifted computer hacker with a personality eerily similar to Dragon Ball Zs Bulma, a character lacking in depth, uniqueness, and screen time. Creed Diskenth, the main villain, is without a doubt Black Cats strongest showcase of characterization, a combination of Dragon Balls General Blue, Knives Millions, and Legato Bluesummers (the latter two of Trigun fame), a genocidal, sadistic, flower-bearing God-wannabe whose obsession with Train borders on the homosexual. Black Cats cast, infusing an overdose of comedy into the anime, is among the greatest models of characterization ever assembled.

Daia no Hana, Black Cats opening, electrifies, the theme song, reflective at times and fast-paced at others, a phenomenal way to introduce the upcoming episode (the second opening, while good in its own fashion, isn't as memorable as the first). Black Cats soundtrack is also a sight to behold (or rather something to hear), Trains theme song highlighting your favorite former assassins entrance to the battlefield, and Sayas song making me want to punch Creed in the face for what he did in episode 6 (This anime even has opera music in particularly dramatic fight scenes and while it might be downright bizarre in other action titles, it definitely works for Black Cat. This animes soulful 2nd ending theme is one of the most emotional Ive ever seen, up there with the closings in Bartender and Coyote Ragtime Show.

The final four episodes of Black Cat was dedicated to the Eden Project Arc, a brief saga where villains that formerly fought for good decide to use Eve in a plan to change the world. The Eden Project Arc, while very good in many aspects (throughout the series, Brandon Potter, the voice of Sven, showed that he was a great actor but in this saga, his brilliance was highlighted), was ultimately a random plot twist and a weird way to end the series. Compared to many well-known anime, Black Cat is different. For one, the overall quality is much better in Black Cat than the others, but its Black Cats reputation that sets it apart. Black Cat is considered a mainstream anime (Lots of anime lovers have heard of this and there was even a spinoff videogame in Japan for the PlayStation 2), yet in the most important aspects it is not. There are some anime that surpass Black Cat but most of them don't have the charm, the warmth, the emotion, and the uniqueness that this one has. Black Cat is truly animes lone wolf, and there isn't a higher compliment that I can give to it.",1436227200,,5121,4.930475086906141

There is some shonen silliness (like the main character blocking bullets with side of his gun, and a guy who fights with a scarf) but if that's not a turn off, it's totally worth it. I knew nothing about the show before watching, and completely enjoyed it. The dialogue is solid and witty, the characters feel real and believable, and the show is paced well.

3078791,5,B00127R2YC,"It was 2008 and I had just finished watching the Darker Than Black anime which later became one of my favorites. When had an intense need to look for another anime series that would be just as great or maybe even more so. The parameter was set and was really in the mood for some action and a darker take in anime. A stark contrast to what currently has my attention in an anime series which is comedy and slice of life. Still at that time was looking for some action maybe some shounen. Black Cat came across and it was Shounen Jump anime. I wasn't sure how good it would turn out but once I saw a few episodes knew this was one phenomenal anime. The animation was so incredibly good but even the story. The characters too had their own subtle unique traits that made you truly care about them and just the overall story. It was quite the luck that FUNimation released a SAVE Edition of Black Cat which made me getting Black Cat one of my all time anime series favorites very affordable.

Black Cat is all about , Train Heartnet, an assassin known as Black Cat that has always completed his assigned list of kills until he meets a woman bounty hunter named Saya who he deeply begins to care for who teaches him that if his heart is not in killing he shouldn't try to force himself. He begins to change his life around but because of his new decision his old life brings danger to his new one. Still even in such a dark world he lives in he eventually meets his new family.

One of the top reasons will recommend this series to anime fans is due to the fact that the anime series has such a good soundtrack with the Opening Theme Song and Ending Theme Songs. Voice acting is very fitted to the characters in the English Dub in the voicing.

If your an anime fan that likes anime with substance and good animation and good story such as Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion than Black Cat is a good choice. The series is very affordable so that's a plus!

A very good investment for anime watchers!

3078956,1,B00127R2YC,"I bought this after watching the previews that were shown from some other anime (Bleach I believe), however, I did not like the story line.  You have a kid (the title character, Black Cat) whose parents were killed by an assassin at which point he is raised by the same assassin and of course becomes an assassin himself. The female that causes Black Cat to change his assassin ways is killed like 2 seconds into the series so there was not an opportunity to see how transition from the assassin way of life to regular civilian plays out.  Anime deals with complex social and interpersonal themes with regularity, however, this was not one of its better fares in my humble opinion.  On a side note, the animation was solid.",1381190400,2,723,4.589147286821706

Obsessive really. The last four episodes are all new content-not in the manga at all. You'll either like or dislike it. Anyways I recommend this if you like action and fun characters.

3079072,5,B00127R2YC,"It was long before I brought the series - I love the anime, I watched it online so many times it wasn't even funny how I knew every word, every battle and when it went down during a part of the series. But when I had the money I when out and brought it as soon as I could!

Black Cat is about a Earth just like our but with Sweepers and lots of them! Now Black Cat (a trained killer by a group called: Chronos) aka Train Heartnet learns what it means to be free - with the help of a girl name Saya (but I'm not going to give to much away) but with his friends Eve, Sven, and Rinslet they might just win against this war Creed (main bad guy) has created. Of course there's more to the story but I'm not giving it away!

There are twenty - four episodes and it seem you got a good bang for your buck. Now this is the S.A.V.E. series so you know you can't watch it on your computer the picture isn't that great so just stick with a DVD player if you have it but I still watch it on my computer and it stop in a few places threw out but other then that - I love the CDs!

Now it seem like it doesn't have much to offer but it does! There isn't many feature but a few looking into (like text less songs to the opening theme and both (two) ending). The anime will keep you laughing, it really funny but has very series parts were it will nearly have you in tears (or at least during the funny parts). You can feel like you can be within the story it self at many of parts and it's hard to put it down once you start mostly during the opening themes and then you have the happy tune ending theme (I'm talking about the first one) then you have the sad, calm ending for the second.

I give this anime five out of five - it awesome, good voice actors, nice plot even thought it was (or feels like it was) rushed at the last episode but it was a nice ending. The character look great maybe even hot by the fangirls. Anyway, Black Cat is a must own for any anime fan! Go out and buy it!",1351123200,,1975,3.881188118811881

This anime has plenty of action and comic relief. The animation is great and so is the soundtrack. Both English and Japanese voice tracks are pretty good. I think this anime had a little too much filler in it, but not enough to hurt the series. All of the characters are cool and very likable. The story is also kind of unique.

To see how Train's character grows is an amazing tale that will keep your eyes glued to the screen. It is very addictive to watch, you wouldn't want to stop until you have seen every episode.

I really enjoy watching Black Cat and would recommend it to any anime fan out there. The animation is breath taking, I keep getting lost in the emotions embedded in the eyes of the characters. You can see exactly how they feel just by looking at their eyes and there are the classic 'humour' scenes here and there that will make you laugh even if you are having the worst day ever.

The anime is short, but still brilliantly done from my point of view. It is a must see.",1347062400,,831,4.253164556962025

He is a master gunman and an emotionless, cold blooded killer, until the sweeper (bounty hunter) Saya enters his life and teaches how to feel again. He leaves Chronos and becomes a sweeper, trying to mend his past mistakes. Unfortunately, his past won't leave him alone, and he learns that a former co-worker of his has decided he wants to rule the world, and he wants Train to join him.

A few years ago I read all 20 volumes of manga (yes, on the computer, I am buying them now to make up for it) and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. So when I found out that the anime was getting a legal release, I was excited. I bought the set and watched it with my sisters. It was entertaining to watch, though at 24 episodes, they couldn't fit the content of all 20 volumes. Normally anime adaptions of this length cover between 6-8 volumes of the source materiel. Rather than just covering the first few volumes and leave it hanging, the TV writers took the important storyline and rewrote it to fit into 20 episodes (the last four episodes were obviously written when the writers were drunk or on drugs and had no business being included). I thought this was a wise move on their part, but I did miss the depth that manga gave to the characters and story. Train is extremely likable character. Like several popular heros before him (Vash, Kenshin), he has the sort of split personality thing, where most of the time he is a goofy, lovable, harmless seeming guy, but when threatened he becomes calm and competent. This leads to both good comedy and good drama. The characters are all interesting, and Creed is pretty good bad guy.

My sisters and I all enjoyed this anime, so I would recommend it. But it is a little confusing at times, and for some reason filled with fillers (excluding the end arc, they aren't that bad). So it hovers between a 3 and a 4 star rating. I settled on 4 in honor of the original manga.

I watched this series in Japanese, and the voice actors did a great job. The soundtrack did a good job of setting the mood. The art and animation were well done.

3079188,5,B00127R2YC,"No spoilers!

I am an avid anime fan, I've watched a little less than 800 hours of anime (quite a lot) but this one really has a special place for me.  It is honestly in my top 8 favorites of all time, and I would definitely put it in my top 4 of short anime (less than 2 seasons).  There is a lot to like.

I think what really did it for me was how positive the anime was, almost the whole way through.  I'll avoid throwing in spoiler, but the character growth for almost all characters is consistently positive.  There are very few shows like it.  I'd say it's like YuYu Hakusho in that respect.  It's a very positive and inspiring anime that really really put me in a good mood every time I watch it. There are few anime that have that kind of effect I think.

I think its themes also put it aside from other anime as well.  Most (or many) action based anime are concerned mainly with becoming stronger, and an obsession with achievement and success.  Black Cat is more about freedom, becoming free thinking.  It also brings a contrast of being cold vs. friendly and loving.

The plot is also very interesting and exciting, and the story has a great amount of depth.  The characters all have a lot of depth as well.  It does a good job of putting in just enough back story so that you can understand and identify with the main characters, without any filler.  All flashbacks are for emotional effect.  One of the benefits of the really short anime is that they do not usually have (much) filler.

I think that's about as far into it as I will go without spoiling it too much.  It is a very exciting plot, secret organizations, elite characters with unique strengths, and a conspiracy theory in the background.

Also has one of the best replay values of any show I've ever watched! Worth having on DVD, I would watch it many times.  It's also only 7 or 8 hours total so it is definitely a good one for movie nights with friends.

ONE LAST THING -- be sure to watch the subbed version, not the English dub.
It should be ""I've come to bring you bad luck.""",1330387200,4,2055,4.283116883116883

He was correct, but amazon proved him wrong. I didn't do anything about this though because I was too busy watching this awesome series that I fell in love with just becuase of the name.

I am a cat lover and so Train instantly made my heart go doki doki. Anyways the story is about Train and how he's part of this organization in which he goes around and assasinates bad guys. He never misses and always completes his mission in a timely manner. So what's the actual story line? That comes in when a new cat arrives in town by the name of Sven. He's a gentleman who smokes and always seems to be broke and he's out to help some girl with long blond hair who happens to be Train's next target.

So what's so big about Black Cat that sets it apart from any other awesome anime adventure? I don't really know, I just love the name and love the series. Black Cat brings to us a series of awesome killings from huge buff dudes with green afros, to our main bad guy who has a sword that no one can see. The entire show is all about Train getting revenge and us watching this and learning about him. It brings to the plate a full serving of humor that could make soda come flyign out of your nose, but don't worry the show has it's serious moments as well.

As one of probably only a few handful of people left who doesn't actually download or watch anime online, I was browsing Amazon looking to add some more anime to my collection, I ran across this one. It seemed interesting enough, so I thought I'd give it a try. Let's just say, when I sat down to watch it, (please excuse the awful pun, 'cuz I just can't help myself) it sunk its claws in & damn if I didn't end up wasting an entire Saturday in front of my TV because of it. Very few anime series have had that effect on me.

Train Heartnet (aka Black Cat) is an eraser (assassin) for Chronos. He is number XIII. He does what he's told, when he's told & thinks nothing of it. That is until he meets Saiya & it causes him to rethink his beliefs & way of life. Sven has the misfortune to keep crossing paths with Black Cat.  Eventually they team up as partners to end the evil that is Creed Diskenth, his group the Apostles of the Star & other various villians. I really don't want to get too detailed in my review, as I don't want to ruin it for those who of you haven't seen it. Let me just say this: The story line is GREAT, the action is AWESOME, the heroes are heroic, the villians are deliciously villianous (Creed is an especially sick & twisted evil piece of work)& you will laugh your ass off (or, if your sense of humor in no way resembles mine, chuckle heartily) in several places. This is an anime that both guys & girls will enjoy.

This collection consists of four DVDs with six episodes on each disc, housed in a clear plastic DVD case that is a bit thicker than a standard DVD case. The discs are arranged as two on each side with the discs overlapping a bit. It's NOT my favorite set up, but I suppose it could be worse. Textless beginning & ending songs & trailers are the only ""extras"".

In short, I loved this series so much that I went back on Amazon & ordered the first run individual DVDs with the starter box. I definitely recommend this series for those who are just getting aquainted with anime, are fans of action anime, or those who just really don't have a lot to do & just want to take it easy & spend the day watching an really good anime.",1271721600,48,2220,4.155813953488372
3079276,3,B00127R2YC,"In a world that is just slightly different from our own, he's one of Chronos' Numbers, an elite assassin who's known for the XIII branded on his chest.

Kentaro Yabuki had a pretty cool idea when he used that for his action/comedy manga ""Black Cat,"" all about the ex-Number's adventures as a sweeper (bounty hunter) and his attempts to save the world from his former partner. The anime is a mixed bag -- the overall story arc is scrambled up enthusiastically, but it's full of action and wild comedy (the white cat and his kisses!) and some thoroughly likable anti-heroes out to pay the bills.

Sweeper Sven Vollfield is about to nab a notorious gangster when Train Heartnet, the notorious ""Black Cat,"" bursts in and kills the man and escapes before anyone can react. Elsewhere in the town, Train reluctantly befriends a perky young sweeper named Saya, who starts to make him change his views on killing and subservience. Just in time, since he's been ordered to kill a human bioweapon -- a little named named Eve, who Sven is determined to protect.

Then Train breaks away from Chronos, declaring that he won't serve anyone. The Numbers attempt to kill him, and his ex-partner Creed attempts to lure him away -- saying that he plans to rule the world instead of Chronos. And to get Train, he'll kill the person Train holds dear.

Some months later, Train is roaming with Sven and Eve as a newly minted sweeper, hunting down assorted bad guys for cash (but never killing them). Unfortunately Creed's organization ""The Apostles of the Star"" is giving criminals Tao water that gives them superpowers, and organizing a deadly company that is nearly unstoppable. The Numbers and Train are both determined to hunt down and take out Creed before he can hurt anyone else, but the Apostles of the Star are a match for the Numbers.

""Black Cat"" deviates pretty drastically from its original manga -- the over-arcing storyline is scrambled up and parts are removed, the characters are given bucketloads of angst, Train's motivations are dumbed down, the moral greyness is wiped clean, and the entire start of the series is radically different. And due to some random filler episodes (Train and Eve help a bunch of homeless kids?), the last fourth of the series unravels as it tries to cram way too much into too few episodes. And it even adds on an extra anime-only arc at the end, which is hideously anticlimactic and out of place -- and changes the grand finale drastically.

Despite those flaws, ""Black Cat"" is a colorful action anime. There are brilliant acrobatic fight scenes, using weapon ranging from unbreakable guns to invisible swords, corrosive skin to a razor-sharp floating scarf -- and these can be pretty harrowing when they're personal for Train. The battles can get so explosive that one episode has an entire castle crumbling out from under the characters, but there are long stretches of contemplation and flashbacks.

There's also a lot of angst in here, and a dark undertone runs through most of the series' characters -- even the perky ones have something unpleasant in their lives. Fortunately this is offset by a healthy dose of comic relief, usually from Sven or Train (""Everyone's in a panic over a stupid pet lizard, DAAAAAAHLING!""), and some straight-faced humor from Eve due to her limited experience with... well, just about everything.

Train is a hero with a mildly split personality, since he seems to be either the angsty abused gunman, or a delightfully goofy bounty hunter who can easily eat his own weight in food and milk. And the rest of the main cast is similarly colorful -- the future-seeing Sven, quiet and solemn Eve, and the flirty thief Rinslet. Creed serves as a pretty creepy villain -- he's megalomaniacal, arrogant, and has a massive gay crush on Train. The Apostles and the Numbers are somewhat patchy, but there are some standouts-- the elegant and smart Charden, teenybopper Kyoko, the flirtatious Jenos Hazard, and the beautiful master of disguise Lin Shaolee.

I'll keep this review short and simple.  If you really like the Black Cat, then this is a must own for you.  The series I got contains four discs, I am not sure how many this will contain.  There 6-8 episodes per disc, and there is a ""play all"" feature that allows you to watch one episode after the other without having to stop it and hit play again.

All the episodes are great, the sound quality and picture are amazing.  I am not sure what else to say here, except that if you really like Black Cat, then this is a must own for you.",1253577600,,637,4.056

3079336,3,B00127R2YC,"In a world that is just slightly different from our own, he's one of Chronos' Numbers, an elite assassin who's known for the XIII branded on his chest.

Kentaro Yabuki had a pretty cool idea when he used that for his action/comedy manga ""Black Cat,"" all about the ex-Number's adventures as a sweeper (bounty hunter) and his attempts to save the world from his former partner. The anime is a mixed bag -- the overall story arc is scrambled up enthusiastically, but it's full of action and wild comedy (the white cat and his kisses!) and some thoroughly likable anti-heroes out to pay the bills.

Sweeper Sven Vollfield is about to nab a notorious gangster when Train Heartnet, the notorious ""Black Cat,"" bursts in and kills the man and escapes before anyone can react. Elsewhere in the town, Train reluctantly befriends a perky young sweeper named Saya, who starts to make him change his views on killing and subservience. Just in time, since he's been ordered to kill a human bioweapon -- a little named named Eve, who Sven is determined to protect.

Then Train breaks away from Chronos, declaring that he won't serve anyone. The Numbers attempt to kill him, and his ex-partner Creed attempts to lure him away -- saying that he plans to rule the world instead of Chronos. And to get Train, he'll kill the person Train holds dear.

Some months later, Train is roaming with Sven and Eve as a newly minted sweeper, hunting down assorted bad guys for cash (but never killing them). Unfortunately Creed's organization ""The Apostles of the Star"" is giving criminals Tao water that gives them superpowers, and organizing a deadly company that is nearly unstoppable -- they can breathe fire, manipulate blood/wind/gravity, regenerate instantly, splinter concrete, and even open rips in space/time.

But the mad Creed is still determined to have Train at his side. The Numbers and Train are both determined to hunt down and take out Creed before he can hurt anyone else, but the Apostles of the Star are a match for the Numbers. With his friends' help, he'll stop them.

""Black Cat"" deviates pretty drastically from its original manga -- the over-arcing storyline is scrambled up and parts are removed, the characters are given bucketloads of angst, Train's motivations are dumbed down, the moral greyness is wiped clean, and the entire start of the series is radically different. And due to some random filler episodes (Train and Eve help a bunch of homeless kids?), the last fourth of the series unravels as it tries to cram way too much into too few episodes. And it even adds on an extra anime-only arc at the end, which is hideously anticlimactic and out of place -- and changes the grand finale drastically.

Despite those flaws, ""Black Cat"" is a colorful action anime. There are brilliant acrobatic fight scenes, using weapon ranging from unbreakable guns to invisible swords, corrosive skin to a razor-sharp floating scarf -- and these can be pretty harrowing when they're personal for Train. The battles can get so explosive that one episode has an entire castle crumbling out from under the characters, but there are long stretches of contemplation and flashbacks.

There's also a lot of angst in here, and a dark undertone runs through most of the series' characters -- even the perky ones have something unpleasant in their lives. Fortunately this is offset by a healthy dose of comic relief, usually from Sven or Train (""Everyone's in a panic over a stupid pet lizard, DAAAAAAHLING!""), and some straight-faced humor from Eve due to her limited experience with... well, just about everything.

And the entire series is graced with shadowy, elaborate animation full of glowing roses, dark rooms, moonlit rooftops, harsh sunsets and rainy duels. Even dark nights include a luminous soft light.

Train is a hero with a mildly split personality, since he seems to be either the angsty abused-killer-since-he-was-six gunman, or a delightfully goofy bounty hunter who can easily eat his own weight in food and milk. Sven serves as a good counterpoint -- an ex IBI agent with a magic eye and a perpetual ulcer over their bills. And the quiet, solemn Eve quickly grows from a ""killing machine"" to a naive little girl experiencing the world for the first time, along with enough books to overflow a library.

Creed serves as a pretty creepy villain -- he's megalomaniacal, arrogant, and has a massive gay crush on Train based on his prowess as a killer. The Apostles and the Numbers are patchily characterize, but some of them stand out -- the elegant and smart Charden, teenybopper Kyoko, the flirtatious Jenos Hazard, and the beautiful master of disguise Lin Shaolee.

3079339,2,B00127R2YC,"Pros: Great animation and action scenes. Nicely drawn and animated.

Cons: Lack in action and in honesty, it bored me so much I think I skipped a few episodes towards the end and watched the last two episodes. Watched the first 15 episodes and I couldn't take it no more but I can't just not watch the anime after getting it so I forced myself to finish it.

I admit it has good artwork and action scenes but the anime bored me near to tears. It was highly predictable and the ending so very typical. I was expecting a lot of action but was very disappointed.

This is just my personal opinion and as with all of my reviews, if you're looking to get some sort of long essay of a review that gives you all the character names and what year they were born and how many eggs they ate for breakfast and such, I suggest you read on to the more long winded reviews.

I just find it boring personally, that's all. Watch the first 5 or so episodes yourself, this is probably a hate it or love it anime. I just didn't enjoy it much.",1240704000,,1023,4.151515151515151

3079341,3,B00127R2YC,"I caught Black Cat on the funimation Channel. They play this anime 24/7. I've seen this series about 3-4 times now. I did enjoy watching Black Cat, it was a pretty good action anime, but it really has that run of the mill been there done that vibe to it. So let me break it down for you.

First you have ""Train Heartnet"" probably the worse anime name, but atleast his alternative is a bit better as Black Cat. Train is the typical gun slinging hero. He's invincible when he has his gun in his hand, and no one can touch him. As soon as you grabs his piece and starts firing away nothing in his sights are safe. Hmmm this sounds like someone else I know... let me think... How about ""TRIGUN!"" Ah yes, I've seen this all before. There's a gun slinging bad guy, and a specialized organization of marksmen and assisans with unique abilities are out to get the gun slinging hero. Yes, been there done that. Matter of fact there  really aren't too many differences. People in this anime are as scared of hearing the name ""Black Cat"" as people in ""Trigun"" were affraid of hearing ""Vash the Stampede"". Too many similarities... just too coincidental.

Then we have the other characters.

EVE, who is the quiet put super powerful little girl. Now her character is kind of new because of her abilities, but the reserved quiet girl/ ultimate killer routine has been done over to death. Although the spin in black cat is that Eve does not want to fight, she just wants to be a normal girl. That is what sets the tone apart, so really she is a likeable character.

Then we have Rinslet Walker. She is the much done over materialistic glamour girl with a loud mouth and a passion for money. She is pretty much ""Bulma from DBZ"", although she is a theif so she reminds me alot of ""Rose Anderson"" from Solty rei(wich is an awsome Anime btw!),actually she is alot like Rose only slightly less chatty. But, we have all seen this type of character before. Just because Rinslet is so cliche, her character is really predictable.

Next we have Sven Vollfied, Now he should be the main characters best friend and come to aid him with his gun (in this case a briefcase) when needed, but Sven is actually like a dual main character. I like Sven alot and he really makes the show worth watching. He is not as powerful as Black Cat, but he has 100% more personality which makes him that much more interesting to watch. It feels at times in the Anime that Black cat takes a back seat to Sven, which I think is a good thing.

Then lets add in Kyoko, She is the quirky girl with an rediculous crush on the main character black cat. She will stop at nothing to gain his love and affection. He is all she dreams of, and she will do anything to be by his side. Pretty much she is the ""unwanted"" admirer in any anime.

Last but not least the Evil Villian ""Creed Diskenth"". This guy is every evil villian ever. He is a phsycopath, he has a passion/hate for the main character, he runs an organization that plans to take over the world, he will stop at nothing to achieve his goal, which includes him expirementing on his own body. All I can say is seen it! seen it! seen it! Nothing is new about this guy. I can't even hardly began to compare him to villians from other anime's because the list would just be too long. He is that Cliche. The one thing I can say that's different about him is that he has a sword with an invisible blade, but I'm quite sure someone on ""Bleach"" has the same thing.

 I think by far the thing that mostly makes this anime easy to forget or look over is the fact that the characters or so very unoriginal. They really don't stand out at all because you've already seen them in shows 100 times before. The only memorable characters that stands out is Sven & Eve. The only thing that sets this anime apart from being every other anime ever is it's plot.

 The plot basicly is another dual one. On one side we have the Organizations of Assasins trying to come after the main character because he left their group. They either want him to come back, or they will stop at nothing to kill him. SEEN IT!

 Then we have the good guys rescuing a girl from the bad guys only to find out that this girl has been misstreated by life, so the good guys go out their way to show her how great life can be. SEEN IT!

How about this? There is an evil group of rebels with unique abilities that want to take over the world, and they are lead by a mentally unstable phsycopath. SEEN IT!

Ok, lets try this... The little girl they rescued isn't just a little girl but she has a unique ability that the bad guys are after because her powers can be used to take over the world. I'm not even going to go there.

Now the new interesting element added to the plot is the heavy science fiction with the nano technology. That is something new and interesting, and does stand out quite a bit in this anime. I give Black Cat the points for doing something different along those lines.

Overall Black Cat is an OK anime to watch. It's not bad, but it's not exactly something new. It doesn't really stand out, and there aren't really  that many highlights about it just because it's ideas have been done to death. It's worth watching if you come across it by chance. As far as buying it, if the price is right sure, but I wouldn't go out my way to get it.",1237852800,,5317,4.277888446215139
3079342,5,B00127R2YC,"""I'm here to bring you some bad luck.""
...he's also here apparently to bring us some awesome entertainment.

I expected the series to be bad.  I saw trailers that looked really awful, and things that look cliched... but, I was pleasantly mistaken.

The series is amazing.  It has a rich and broad cast of a variety of characters, nods to other animes, such as Trigun, Evangelion, Outlaw Star, Dragon Ball Z, and Ranma 1/2, and though there are alot of typical anime cliches in it, they are all executed to the highest quality.

The main characters do seem to be invincible though, and for some reason, ungodly amazing.  Its a common thing in anime, and it does make things a little less believable sometimes, like, why is X person so damn important that this is happening?  It also can bring down suspense, but not to the point where you care.  I can honestly say, that even though that may be a rather annoying point, I didn't even really notice until I read someones review and thought ""oh yeah... that IS true."" so yes, its true, but, it doesn't matter too much, if you ask me.  It doesn't seem to really HURT the series a great deal.

The story is well thought out and goes together fluidly, not a single string left unwoven, and the ending is amazing, unexpected, and thrilling to the last moment.  The series is flawlessly both hilarious, and also heart warming and touching, without any missteps.  Though the beginning could have been built up better, its really a minor complaint, in a series that does not stop delivering!  I have not a single complaint with the series, except why isn't there more!!!

Pros:

Nods to other clasics, something a true Otaku can appreciate
BEAUTIFUL art, and creative and unique animation style
Great story, leaves nothing out
TONS of rich and interesting characters
Plot twists and turns
Really interesting villain and hero
Funny and fun to watch but also heart warming and beautiful

Cons:

beginning could have been done better, but, that's really minor

3079345,5,B00127R2YC,"Every once in a while a series will come along that will capture your attention so much that you will neglect food and sleep in order to devour the series.  This is one of those anime's.  This was one of those rare animes that I finished the same day I started it.  Here is my usual rundown of the series.

Pros:
- The characters (specifically Train, Sven, and Eve) are all likable and bring their own strengths to the team.  You will form a connection with each and every one.
- Almost every character in the series are dynamic and show some sort of character development.
- The characters all have minds of their own, even if they are part of an organization, they are not slaves of that organization.  They will not blindly follow orders that goes against their beliefs, morals, and in many cases passions.  This is a rare thing that separates this series from many others.
- Constantly keeps you guessing as to who the real ""bad guys"" are.  Many time's individuals are just fighting for what they believe in.  This makes it difficult to just categorize them as good and bad.
- Plenty of political intrigue with many different organizations including the Sweepers, Chronos, and the Apostles of the Star.
- Very similar and in my eyes surpasses Get Backers seasons 1 and 2
- Absolutely never devoid of intertwining plots and action.

- Cons

- After watching it in one day...I was tired the next
- Although there were a few casualties, many of the main characters were ""invincible"".  This is very common throughout most anime's, but it lowers the suspense slightly.

Without a doubt one of the best series I've ever seen.  If you have the funds, GET IT NOW.  You will not regret it!",1230508800,3,1684,4.548172757475083
3312979,5,B00127R2YC,"The series starts off with loads of action and is basically revolving around main character, Train and his exploits with the Chronos organization that he works for.  Throw in a couple characters (Sven, Renslet) that he comes to know and care for and an additional one that he likes but not really in that way.  Things only get that much more interesting.  It's great to see Funimation and Gonzo come up with this excellent anime series.

Also of note is the character Eve as she is central to this story and comes into their lives after an accident happens. She grows to be a major addition to this cast of ecentric characters that also include other sweepers and numbers (numbered characters of the Chronos organization that Train is a part of).

Great start, middle and ending as well.  It really makes for an all around, well rounded, hilarious yet touching series that should be watched as soon as you have the chance.",1224115200,2,922,4.660493827160494

3312982,5,B00127R2YC,"I got to say it was a great series, plot, art, voice acting just awesome, no real extras, but alittle to fast on the episodes ploting. Funimation does it again by picking another great series and great actors for the series. It is great don't get me wrong but the series ended to fast for me. I think they could of done at least 4-8 more episodes for the right closure of the series. But that's how most of the anime is now and then, they just get a short time to make the series. So I'm not to mad about it. This is a awesome series and anime and the manga is great too.
Well when you watch the first episodes you just get hooked it was just man I couldn't stop watchng it. I just got this series a week ago and watched the whole series in one day. On my only day off man. I couldn't stop watching it. I didn't even go shoot pool and drink with my friends like I do on my day off. Man was they mad dude. :P.

Anyways Train is not like Samurai X ok. If Everybody wanted to say someone was copying someone. Everyone has a idea of

1) A girl and guy meets, boy and girl don't like each other, later boy and girl slowly fall in love.

2) Boy and girl long time friends and find out they was in love.

3) Boy and girl meet and girl falls in love with boy, Boy doesn't like girl but later realize he loves her more than he know.

4) Boy and girl fall in love and have to fight to stay together.

5) Boy and girl fall in love, girl dies or boy dies, then wants revenge or saver on one self.

Ok you get it now right. Many series have the idea but the ploting of how and what happens in the time of all this is what makes it great. I was glad to see Saya for a short time in the series. It was sad to see what happened to her. But understand this is not like samurai X just because it go's a different way of the idea. She is always with him in his mind and heart so you start to feel the pain more with him through out the series. It makes you understand truely what was happening to him and how he felt, even if he never said anything you can tell. As well the idea of what she did in the time she was with him. Even after she is gone. It is alittle sad only on that. Nothing else really is sad in this series to me. I fell in love with everyone in this series and it was sad to see it end. I'm glad to see the anime of a manga set which is not yet complete to come alive. So check it out and it's not Kenshin dude, you just don't know what your talking about dude. Train weird name but he is so kwel man alot of the characters was so kwel, but he was just the best man. I like the name Black Cat too. ;p later

3313101,5,B00127R2YC,"Not every anime has a great beginning. Monsters first episode was very good but there were no signs of that becoming a classic until the fourth episode. Triguns first episode was underwhelming to say the least, filled with over-the-top gunfights and a Whos the real Vash? plotline that quickly turned dull, but the second episode, for me, was what really kicked off the series. From the first episode, from the very beginning, you can tell that Black Cat is special, but this animes plot, on the surface, is one of the most generic imaginable. Young hero witnesses a loved one being killed and the hero embarks on a fury-filled journey for revenge (Tell me you haven't heard that one before), but theres so much more to Black Cat than what youd expect from a summary like the aforementioned one. Black Cat is an action-oriented anime with major focuses on comedy and drama, and even a hint of romance.

Like the plot, Black Cats four central characters appear as cookie cutter models often seen in other anime. At first glance, the protagonist is the brooding young adult, Sven is the cool guy, Eves the quiet one, and Rinslets the kind but loudmouthed young woman. Theres more to these characters than the models will lead you to believe, especially for Train Heartnet, the protagonist. Codenamed Black Cat, Train is an infamous assassin for the shady organization Chronos, cold-bloodedly taking lives with Hades the handgun, until he is influenced by the beautiful Saya, an experienced sweeper (bounty hunter), to sever ties with Chronos and his lifestyle of bloodshed. At the series start, Train is a certified loner, his hobby gazing thoughtfully at the moon, drinking cold bottles of milk while awaiting his next assignment. A self-described stray cat roaming, Train, in his journey, is revealed to have more layers to his character, at times a carefree traveler with an often-hungry stomach, and in fights a confident challenger with strength, agility, and marksmanship on his side. Train Heartnet is an interesting character in a show filled with them.

Sure, Trains an amazing protagonist, but what really elevates Black Cat overall is the focus on the other characters. Eve is the blond-haired android of few words, a lover of books and fireworks, someone whos filled with kindness but isn't afraid to fight either. Sven Vollfied is my favorite character, a veteran sweeper with an eye-patch, green hair, a secret power, a tragic past, a really laid-back personality, a briefcase filled with weapons, and a gentlemans code he really doesnt want to break. Rinslet Walker is Black Cats sole weak spot in characterization, a gifted computer hacker with a personality eerily similar to Dragon Ball Zs Bulma, a character lacking in depth, uniqueness, and screen time. Creed Diskenth, the main villain, is without a doubt Black Cats strongest showcase of characterization, a combination of Dragon Balls General Blue, Knives Millions, and Legato Bluesummers (the latter two of Trigun fame), a genocidal, sadistic, flower-bearing God-wannabe whose obsession with Train borders on the homosexual. Black Cats cast, infusing an overdose of comedy into the anime, is among the greatest models of characterization ever assembled.

Daia no Hana, Black Cats opening, electrifies, the theme song, reflective at times and fast-paced at others, a phenomenal way to introduce the upcoming episode (the second opening, while good in its own fashion, isn't as memorable as the first). Black Cats soundtrack is also a sight to behold (or rather something to hear), Trains theme song highlighting your favorite former assassins entrance to the battlefield, and Sayas song making me want to punch Creed in the face for what he did in episode 6 (This anime even has opera music in particularly dramatic fight scenes and while it might be downright bizarre in other action titles, it definitely works for Black Cat. This animes soulful 2nd ending theme is one of the most emotional Ive ever seen, up there with the closings in Bartender and Coyote Ragtime Show.

The final four episodes of Black Cat was dedicated to the Eden Project Arc, a brief saga where villains that formerly fought for good decide to use Eve in a plan to change the world. The Eden Project Arc, while very good in many aspects (throughout the series, Brandon Potter, the voice of Sven, showed that he was a great actor but in this saga, his brilliance was highlighted), was ultimately a random plot twist and a weird way to end the series. Compared to many well-known anime, Black Cat is different. For one, the overall quality is much better in Black Cat than the others, but its Black Cats reputation that sets it apart. Black Cat is considered a mainstream anime (Lots of anime lovers have heard of this and there was even a spinoff videogame in Japan for the PlayStation 2), yet in the most important aspects it is not. There are some anime that surpass Black Cat but most of them don't have the charm, the warmth, the emotion, and the uniqueness that this one has. Black Cat is truly animes lone wolf, and there isn't a higher compliment that I can give to it.",1436227200,,5121,4.930475086906141

3313288,5,B00127R2YC,"It was 2008 and I had just finished watching the Darker Than Black anime which later became one of my favorites. When had an intense need to look for another anime series that would be just as great or maybe even more so. The parameter was set and was really in the mood for some action and a darker take in anime. A stark contrast to what currently has my attention in an anime series which is comedy and slice of life. Still at that time was looking for some action maybe some shounen. Black Cat came across and it was Shounen Jump anime. I wasn't sure how good it would turn out but once I saw a few episodes knew this was one phenomenal anime. The animation was so incredibly good but even the story. The characters too had their own subtle unique traits that made you truly care about them and just the overall story. It was quite the luck that FUNimation released a SAVE Edition of Black Cat which made me getting Black Cat one of my all time anime series favorites very affordable.

Black Cat is all about , Train Heartnet, an assassin known as Black Cat that has always completed his assigned list of kills until he meets a woman bounty hunter named Saya who he deeply begins to care for who teaches him that if his heart is not in killing he shouldn't try to force himself. He begins to change his life around but because of his new decision his old life brings danger to his new one. Still even in such a dark world he lives in he eventually meets his new family.

One of the top reasons will recommend this series to anime fans is due to the fact that the anime series has such a good soundtrack with the Opening Theme Song and Ending Theme Songs. Voice acting is very fitted to the characters in the English Dub in the voicing.

If your an anime fan that likes anime with substance and good animation and good story such as Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion than Black Cat is a good choice. The series is very affordable so that's a plus!

A very good investment for anime watchers!

You have a kid (the title character, Black Cat) whose parents were killed by an assassin at which point he is raised by the same assassin and of course becomes an assassin himself. The female that causes Black Cat to change his assassin ways is killed like 2 seconds into the series so there was not an opportunity to see how transition from the assassin way of life to regular civilian plays out.  Anime deals with complex social and interpersonal themes with regularity, however, this was not one of its better fares in my humble opinion.  On a side note, the animation was solid.",1381190400,2,723,4.589147286821706

Obsessive really. The last four episodes are all new content-not in the manga at all. You'll either like or dislike it. Anyways I recommend this if you like action and fun characters.

3313569,5,B00127R2YC,"It was long before I brought the series - I love the anime, I watched it online so many times it wasn't even funny how I knew every word, every battle and when it went down during a part of the series. But when I had the money I when out and brought it as soon as I could!

Black Cat is about a Earth just like our but with Sweepers and lots of them! Now Black Cat (a trained killer by a group called: Chronos) aka Train Heartnet learns what it means to be free - with the help of a girl name Saya (but I'm not going to give to much away) but with his friends Eve, Sven, and Rinslet they might just win against this war Creed (main bad guy) has created. Of course there's more to the story but I'm not giving it away!

There are twenty - four episodes and it seem you got a good bang for your buck. Now this is the S.A.V.E. series so you know you can't watch it on your computer the picture isn't that great so just stick with a DVD player if you have it but I still watch it on my computer and it stop in a few places threw out but other then that - I love the CDs!

Now it seem like it doesn't have much to offer but it does! There isn't many feature but a few looking into (like text less songs to the opening theme and both (two) ending). The anime will keep you laughing, it really funny but has very series parts were it will nearly have you in tears (or at least during the funny parts). You can feel like you can be within the story it self at many of parts and it's hard to put it down once you start mostly during the opening themes and then you have the happy tune ending theme (I'm talking about the first one) then you have the sad, calm ending for the second.

I give this anime five out of five - it awesome, good voice actors, nice plot even thought it was (or feels like it was) rushed at the last episode but it was a nice ending. The character look great maybe even hot by the fangirls. Anyway, Black Cat is a must own for any anime fan! Go out and buy it!",1351123200,,1975,3.881188118811881

3313683,4,B00127R2YC,"Train Heartnet is an assassin known as ""Black Cat"" who works for the mysterious organization Chronos. He is a master gunman and an emotionless, cold blooded killer, until the sweeper (bounty hunter) Saya enters his life and teaches how to feel again. He leaves Chronos and becomes a sweeper, trying to mend his past mistakes. Unfortunately, his past won't leave him alone, and he learns that a former co-worker of his has decided he wants to rule the world, and he wants Train to join him.

A few years ago I read all 20 volumes of manga (yes, on the computer, I am buying them now to make up for it) and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. So when I found out that the anime was getting a legal release, I was excited. I bought the set and watched it with my sisters. It was entertaining to watch, though at 24 episodes, they couldn't fit the content of all 20 volumes. Normally anime adaptions of this length cover between 6-8 volumes of the source materiel. Rather than just covering the first few volumes and leave it hanging, the TV writers took the important storyline and rewrote it to fit into 20 episodes (the last four episodes were obviously written when the writers were drunk or on drugs and had no business being included). I thought this was a wise move on their part, but I did miss the depth that manga gave to the characters and story. Train is extremely likable character. Like several popular heros before him (Vash, Kenshin), he has the sort of split personality thing, where most of the time he is a goofy, lovable, harmless seeming guy, but when threatened he becomes calm and competent. This leads to both good comedy and good drama. The characters are all interesting, and Creed is pretty good bad guy.

My sisters and I all enjoyed this anime, so I would recommend it. But it is a little confusing at times, and for some reason filled with fillers (excluding the end arc, they aren't that bad). So it hovers between a 3 and a 4 star rating. I settled on 4 in honor of the original manga.

I watched this series in Japanese, and the voice actors did a great job. The soundtrack did a good job of setting the mood. The art and animation were well done.

I am an avid anime fan, I've watched a little less than 800 hours of anime (quite a lot) but this one really has a special place for me.  It is honestly in my top 8 favorites of all time, and I would definitely put it in my top 4 of short anime (less than 2 seasons).  There is a lot to like.

I think what really did it for me was how positive the anime was, almost the whole way through.  I'll avoid throwing in spoiler, but the character growth for almost all characters is consistently positive.  There are very few shows like it.  I'd say it's like YuYu Hakusho in that respect.  It's a very positive and inspiring anime that really really put me in a good mood every time I watch it. There are few anime that have that kind of effect I think.

I think its themes also put it aside from other anime as well.  Most (or many) action based anime are concerned mainly with becoming stronger, and an obsession with achievement and success.  Black Cat is more about freedom, becoming free thinking.  It also brings a contrast of being cold vs. friendly and loving.

The plot is also very interesting and exciting, and the story has a great amount of depth.  The characters all have a lot of depth as well.  It does a good job of putting in just enough back story so that you can understand and identify with the main characters, without any filler.  All flashbacks are for emotional effect.  One of the benefits of the really short anime is that they do not usually have (much) filler.

I think that's about as far into it as I will go without spoiling it too much.  It is a very exciting plot, secret organizations, elite characters with unique strengths, and a conspiracy theory in the background.

Also has one of the best replay values of any show I've ever watched! Worth having on DVD, I would watch it many times.  It's also only 7 or 8 hours total so it is definitely a good one for movie nights with friends.

ONE LAST THING -- be sure to watch the subbed version, not the English dub.
It should be ""I've come to bring you bad luck.""",1330387200,4,2055,4.283116883116883

3313687,4,B00127R2YC,"Okay I'm going to start off by saying that I ordered one-day shipping on a Sunday and got it on Wednesday...when it said that it would arrive on Tuesday, when I pointed this out to the UPS man after my dog attacked him, he said that it didn't say anything like that on the package. He was correct, but amazon proved him wrong. I didn't do anything about this though because I was too busy watching this awesome series that I fell in love with just becuase of the name.

I am a cat lover and so Train instantly made my heart go doki doki. Anyways the story is about Train and how he's part of this organization in which he goes around and assasinates bad guys. He never misses and always completes his mission in a timely manner. So what's the actual story line? That comes in when a new cat arrives in town by the name of Sven. He's a gentleman who smokes and always seems to be broke and he's out to help some girl with long blond hair who happens to be Train's next target.

So what's so big about Black Cat that sets it apart from any other awesome anime adventure? I don't really know, I just love the name and love the series. Black Cat brings to us a series of awesome killings from huge buff dudes with green afros, to our main bad guy who has a sword that no one can see. The entire show is all about Train getting revenge and us watching this and learning about him. It brings to the plate a full serving of humor that could make soda come flyign out of your nose, but don't worry the show has it's serious moments as well. I will say that I don't reccomend watching this one in front of your parents due to the fact that a busty girl seems to flaunt her chest openly with low cut dresses and other ways, even if there is no real nudity, my parents got ofended.",1308441600,2,1770,4.127536231884058

3313689,4,B00127R2YC,"Train Heartnet is an assassin known as ""Black Cat"" who works for the mysterious organization Chronos. He is a master gunman and an emotionless, cold blooded killer, until the sweeper (bounty hunter) Saya enters his life and teaches how to feel again. He leaves Chronos and becomes a sweeper, trying to mend his past mistakes. Unfortunately, his past won't leave him alone, and he learns that a former co-worker of his has decided he wants to rule the world, and he wants Train to join him.

A few years ago I read all 20 volumes of manga (yes, on the computer, I am buying them now to make up for it) and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. So when I found out that the anime was getting a legal release, I was excited. I bought the set and watched it with my sisters. It was entertaining to watch, though at 24 episodes, they couldn't fit the content of all 20 volumes. Normally anime adaptions of this length cover between 6-8 volumes of the source materiel. Rather than just covering the first few volumes and leave it hanging, the TV writers took the important storyline and rewrote it to fit into 20 episodes (the last four episodes were obviously written when the writers were drunk or on drugs and had no business being included). I thought this was a wise move on their part, but I did miss the depth that manga gave to the characters and story. As a shonen title, I expected it to be the formulaic fight-really-powerful-bad-guy-win-then-fight-even-more-powerful-bad-guy repeat, with little else involved. But the storyline really added depth to the characters and Train is extremely likable character. Like several popular heros before him (Vash, Kenshin), he has the sort of split personality thing, where most of the time he is a goofy, lovable, harmless seeming guy, but when threatened he becomes calm and competent. This leads to both good comedy and good drama. The characters are all interesting, and Creed is pretty good bad guy.

My sisters and I all enjoyed this anime, so I would recommend it. But it is a little confusing at times, and for some reason filled with fillers (excluding the end arc, they aren't that bad). So it hovers between a 3 and a 4 star rating. I settled on 4 in honor of the original manga.

3313772,5,B00127R2YC,"What can I say? This is one hell of a anime series! As one of probably only a few handful of people left who doesn't actually download or watch anime online, I was browsing Amazon looking to add some more anime to my collection, I ran across this one. It seemed interesting enough, so I thought I'd give it a try. Let's just say, when I sat down to watch it, (please excuse the awful pun, 'cuz I just can't help myself) it sunk its claws in & damn if I didn't end up wasting an entire Saturday in front of my TV because of it. Very few anime series have had that effect on me.

Train Heartnet (aka Black Cat) is an eraser (assassin) for Chronos. He is number XIII. He does what he's told, when he's told & thinks nothing of it. That is until he meets Saiya & it causes him to rethink his beliefs & way of life. Sven has the misfortune to keep crossing paths with Black Cat.  Eventually they team up as partners to end the evil that is Creed Diskenth, his group the Apostles of the Star & other various villians. I really don't want to get too detailed in my review, as I don't want to ruin it for those who of you haven't seen it. Let me just say this: The story line is GREAT, the action is AWESOME, the heroes are heroic, the villians are deliciously villianous (Creed is an especially sick & twisted evil piece of work)& you will laugh your ass off (or, if your sense of humor in no way resembles mine, chuckle heartily) in several places. This is an anime that both guys & girls will enjoy.

This collection consists of four DVDs with six episodes on each disc, housed in a clear plastic DVD case that is a bit thicker than a standard DVD case. The discs are arranged as two on each side with the discs overlapping a bit. It's NOT my favorite set up, but I suppose it could be worse. Textless beginning & ending songs & trailers are the only ""extras"".

In short, I loved this series so much that I went back on Amazon & ordered the first run individual DVDs with the starter box. I definitely recommend this series for those who are just getting aquainted with anime, are fans of action anime, or those who just really don't have a lot to do & just want to take it easy & spend the day watching an really good anime.",1271721600,48,2220,4.155813953488372
3313773,3,B00127R2YC,"In a world that is just slightly different from our own, he's one of Chronos' Numbers, an elite assassin who's known for the XIII branded on his chest.

Kentaro Yabuki had a pretty cool idea when he used that for his action/comedy manga ""Black Cat,"" all about the ex-Number's adventures as a sweeper (bounty hunter) and his attempts to save the world from his former partner. The anime is a mixed bag -- the overall story arc is scrambled up enthusiastically, but it's full of action and wild comedy (the white cat and his kisses!) and some thoroughly likable anti-heroes out to pay the bills.

Sweeper Sven Vollfield is about to nab a notorious gangster when Train Heartnet, the notorious ""Black Cat,"" bursts in and kills the man and escapes before anyone can react. Elsewhere in the town, Train reluctantly befriends a perky young sweeper named Saya, who starts to make him change his views on killing and subservience. Just in time, since he's been ordered to kill a human bioweapon -- a little named named Eve, who Sven is determined to protect.

Then Train breaks away from Chronos, declaring that he won't serve anyone. The Numbers attempt to kill him, and his ex-partner Creed attempts to lure him away -- saying that he plans to rule the world instead of Chronos. And to get Train, he'll kill the person Train holds dear.

Some months later, Train is roaming with Sven and Eve as a newly minted sweeper, hunting down assorted bad guys for cash (but never killing them). Unfortunately Creed's organization ""The Apostles of the Star"" is giving criminals Tao water that gives them superpowers, and organizing a deadly company that is nearly unstoppable. The Numbers and Train are both determined to hunt down and take out Creed before he can hurt anyone else, but the Apostles of the Star are a match for the Numbers.

""Black Cat"" deviates pretty drastically from its original manga -- the over-arcing storyline is scrambled up and parts are removed, the characters are given bucketloads of angst, Train's motivations are dumbed down, the moral greyness is wiped clean, and the entire start of the series is radically different. And due to some random filler episodes (Train and Eve help a bunch of homeless kids?), the last fourth of the series unravels as it tries to cram way too much into too few episodes. And it even adds on an extra anime-only arc at the end, which is hideously anticlimactic and out of place -- and changes the grand finale drastically.

Despite those flaws, ""Black Cat"" is a colorful action anime. There are brilliant acrobatic fight scenes, using weapon ranging from unbreakable guns to invisible swords, corrosive skin to a razor-sharp floating scarf -- and these can be pretty harrowing when they're personal for Train. The battles can get so explosive that one episode has an entire castle crumbling out from under the characters, but there are long stretches of contemplation and flashbacks.

There's also a lot of angst in here, and a dark undertone runs through most of the series' characters -- even the perky ones have something unpleasant in their lives. Fortunately this is offset by a healthy dose of comic relief, usually from Sven or Train (""Everyone's in a panic over a stupid pet lizard, DAAAAAAHLING!""), and some straight-faced humor from Eve due to her limited experience with... well, just about everything.

Train is a hero with a mildly split personality, since he seems to be either the angsty abused gunman, or a delightfully goofy bounty hunter who can easily eat his own weight in food and milk. And the rest of the main cast is similarly colorful -- the future-seeing Sven, quiet and solemn Eve, and the flirty thief Rinslet. Creed serves as a pretty creepy villain -- he's megalomaniacal, arrogant, and has a massive gay crush on Train. The Apostles and the Numbers are somewhat patchy, but there are some standouts-- the elegant and smart Charden, teenybopper Kyoko, the flirtatious Jenos Hazard, and the beautiful master of disguise Lin Shaolee.

Fortunately this is offset by a healthy dose of comic relief, usually from Sven or Train (""Everyone's in a panic over a stupid pet lizard, DAHLING!""), and some straight-faced humor from Eve due to her limited experience with... well, just about everything.

Train is a hero with a mildly split personality, since he seems to be either the angsty abused-killer-since-he-was-six gunman, or a delightfully goofy bounty hunter who can easily eat his own weight in food and milk. Sven serves as a good counterpoint -- an ex IBI agent with a magic eye and a perpetual ulcer over their bills. And the quiet, solemn Eve quickly grows from a ""killing machine"" to a naive little girl experiencing the world for the first time, along with enough books to overflow a library.

Creed serves as a pretty creepy villain -- he's megalomaniacal, arrogant, and has a massive gay crush on Train based on his prowess as a killer. The Apostles and the Numbers are patchily characterize, but some of them stand out -- the elegant and smart Charden, teenybopper Kyoko, the flirtatious Jenos Hazard, and the beautiful master of disguise Lin Shaolee.

""Black Cat"" pads itself with filler (Train's background takes seven whole episodes?) and then rushes through its ending, but it's still an enjoyable action anime.",1245628800,9,4417,4.891711229946524

3313836,2,B00127R2YC,"Pros: Great animation and action scenes. Nicely drawn and animated.

Cons: Lack in action and in honesty, it bored me so much I think I skipped a few episodes towards the end and watched the last two episodes. Watched the first 15 episodes and I couldn't take it no more but I can't just not watch the anime after getting it so I forced myself to finish it.

I admit it has good artwork and action scenes but the anime bored me near to tears. It was highly predictable and the ending so very typical. I was expecting a lot of action but was very disappointed.

This is just my personal opinion and as with all of my reviews, if you're looking to get some sort of long essay of a review that gives you all the character names and what year they were born and how many eggs they ate for breakfast and such, I suggest you read on to the more long winded reviews.

I just find it boring personally, that's all. Watch the first 5 or so episodes yourself, this is probably a hate it or love it anime. I just didn't enjoy it much.",1240704000,,1023,4.151515151515151

3313838,3,B00127R2YC,"I caught Black Cat on the funimation Channel. They play this anime 24/7. I've seen this series about 3-4 times now. I did enjoy watching Black Cat, it was a pretty good action anime, but it really has that run of the mill been there done that vibe to it. So let me break it down for you.

First you have ""Train Heartnet"" probably the worse anime name, but atleast his alternative is a bit better as Black Cat. Train is the typical gun slinging hero. He's invincible when he has his gun in his hand, and no one can touch him. As soon as you grabs his piece and starts firing away nothing in his sights are safe. Hmmm this sounds like someone else I know... let me think... How about ""TRIGUN!"" Ah yes, I've seen this all before. There's a gun slinging bad guy, and a specialized organization of marksmen and assisans with unique abilities are out to get the gun slinging hero. Yes, been there done that. Matter of fact there  really aren't too many differences. People in this anime are as scared of hearing the name ""Black Cat"" as people in ""Trigun"" were affraid of hearing ""Vash the Stampede"". Too many similarities... just too coincidental.

Then we have the other characters.

EVE, who is the quiet put super powerful little girl. Now her character is kind of new because of her abilities, but the reserved quiet girl/ ultimate killer routine has been done over to death. Although the spin in black cat is that Eve does not want to fight, she just wants to be a normal girl. That is what sets the tone apart, so really she is a likeable character.

Then we have Rinslet Walker. She is the much done over materialistic glamour girl with a loud mouth and a passion for money. She is pretty much ""Bulma from DBZ"", although she is a theif so she reminds me alot of ""Rose Anderson"" from Solty rei(wich is an awsome Anime btw!),actually she is alot like Rose only slightly less chatty. But, we have all seen this type of character before. Just because Rinslet is so cliche, her character is really predictable.

Next we have Sven Vollfied, Now he should be the main characters best friend and come to aid him with his gun (in this case a briefcase) when needed, but Sven is actually like a dual main character. I like Sven alot and he really makes the show worth watching. He is not as powerful as Black Cat, but he has 100% more personality which makes him that much more interesting to watch. It feels at times in the Anime that Black cat takes a back seat to Sven, which I think is a good thing.

Then lets add in Kyoko, She is the quirky girl with an rediculous crush on the main character black cat. She will stop at nothing to gain his love and affection. He is all she dreams of, and she will do anything to be by his side. Pretty much she is the ""unwanted"" admirer in any anime.

Last but not least the Evil Villian ""Creed Diskenth"". This guy is every evil villian ever. He is a phsycopath, he has a passion/hate for the main character, he runs an organization that plans to take over the world, he will stop at nothing to achieve his goal, which includes him expirementing on his own body. All I can say is seen it! seen it! seen it! Nothing is new about this guy. I can't even hardly began to compare him to villians from other anime's because the list would just be too long. He is that Cliche. The one thing I can say that's different about him is that he has a sword with an invisible blade, but I'm quite sure someone on ""Bleach"" has the same thing.

 I think by far the thing that mostly makes this anime easy to forget or look over is the fact that the characters or so very unoriginal. They really don't stand out at all because you've already seen them in shows 100 times before. The only memorable characters that stands out is Sven & Eve. The only thing that sets this anime apart from being every other anime ever is it's plot.

 The plot basicly is another dual one. On one side we have the Organizations of Assasins trying to come after the main character because he left their group. They either want him to come back, or they will stop at nothing to kill him. SEEN IT!

 Then we have the good guys rescuing a girl from the bad guys only to find out that this girl has been misstreated by life, so the good guys go out their way to show her how great life can be. SEEN IT!

How about this? There is an evil group of rebels with unique abilities that want to take over the world, and they are lead by a mentally unstable phsycopath. SEEN IT!

Ok, lets try this... The little girl they rescued isn't just a little girl but she has a unique ability that the bad guys are after because her powers can be used to take over the world. I'm not even going to go there.

Now the new interesting element added to the plot is the heavy science fiction with the nano technology. That is something new and interesting, and does stand out quite a bit in this anime. I give Black Cat the points for doing something different along those lines.

Overall Black Cat is an OK anime to watch. It's not bad, but it's not exactly something new. It doesn't really stand out, and there aren't really  that many highlights about it just because it's ideas have been done to death. It's worth watching if you come across it by chance. As far as buying it, if the price is right sure, but I wouldn't go out my way to get it.",1237852800,,5317,4.277888446215139
3313839,5,B00127R2YC,"""I'm here to bring you some bad luck.""
...he's also here apparently to bring us some awesome entertainment.

I expected the series to be bad.  I saw trailers that looked really awful, and things that look cliched... but, I was pleasantly mistaken.

The series is amazing.  It has a rich and broad cast of a variety of characters, nods to other animes, such as Trigun, Evangelion, Outlaw Star, Dragon Ball Z, and Ranma 1/2, and though there are alot of typical anime cliches in it, they are all executed to the highest quality.

The main characters do seem to be invincible though, and for some reason, ungodly amazing.  Its a common thing in anime, and it does make things a little less believable sometimes, like, why is X person so damn important that this is happening?  It also can bring down suspense, but not to the point where you care.  I can honestly say, that even though that may be a rather annoying point, I didn't even really notice until I read someones review and thought ""oh yeah... that IS true."" so yes, its true, but, it doesn't matter too much, if you ask me.  It doesn't seem to really HURT the series a great deal.

The story is well thought out and goes together fluidly, not a single string left unwoven, and the ending is amazing, unexpected, and thrilling to the last moment.  The series is flawlessly both hilarious, and also heart warming and touching, without any missteps.  Though the beginning could have been built up better, its really a minor complaint, in a series that does not stop delivering!  I have not a single complaint with the series, except why isn't there more!!!

Pros:

Nods to other clasics, something a true Otaku can appreciate
BEAUTIFUL art, and creative and unique animation style
Great story, leaves nothing out
TONS of rich and interesting characters
Plot twists and turns
Really interesting villain and hero
Funny and fun to watch but also heart warming and beautiful

Cons:

beginning could have been done better, but, that's really minor
Main characters on ""God Mode"" so to speak.
I wish it didn't end!  its so good!

This is one of those anime's.  This was one of those rare animes that I finished the same day I started it.  Here is my usual rundown of the series.

Pros:
- The characters (specifically Train, Sven, and Eve) are all likable and bring their own strengths to the team.  You will form a connection with each and every one.
- Almost every character in the series are dynamic and show some sort of character development.
- The characters all have minds of their own, even if they are part of an organization, they are not slaves of that organization.  They will not blindly follow orders that goes against their beliefs, morals, and in many cases passions.  This is a rare thing that separates this series from many others.
- Constantly keeps you guessing as to who the real ""bad guys"" are.  Many time's individuals are just fighting for what they believe in.  This makes it difficult to just categorize them as good and bad.
- Plenty of political intrigue with many different organizations including the Sweepers, Chronos, and the Apostles of the Star.
- Very similar and in my eyes surpasses Get Backers seasons 1 and 2
- Absolutely never devoid of intertwining plots and action.

- Cons

- After watching it in one day...I was tired the next
- Although there were a few casualties, many of the main characters were ""invincible"".  This is very common throughout most anime's, but it lowers the suspense slightly.

Without a doubt one of the best series I've ever seen.  If you have the funds, GET IT NOW.  You will not regret it!",1230508800,3,1684,4.548172757475083

This show is definitely worth Owning.

Overall Rating 4/5
The show starts with the lead a bit grim on the dark side as an assassin. But soon, everything changes and the whole show mellows to an adventure story of the good guys gang vs the large bad organization.

People with powers, one liners, and solid action sequences really make this a show worth owning.  The gang travel around as sweepers, bounty hunters, to clean up the those that would dirty the streets.  It isn't too complex. But if you do something right, thats all you need.
