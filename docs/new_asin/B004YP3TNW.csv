8448700,5,B004YP3TNW,The first opera about a First Nations politician. Hopefully this opera will be revived by COC.,1416096000,,94,4.9375
8448701,4,B004YP3TNW,"Harry Somers' mostly atonal opera about the Canadian Metis Rebellion's leader Louis Riel makes for a gripping theatrical experience. ( I must confess that I was prejudiced to like this DVD because the face of a very dear friend, a chorister, now deceased, was used for closeups several times in the Church scene.)
Mavor Moore's libretto in English, French and Cree Indian has to cover a lot of historic material, and the somewhat Brechtian television staging and design manages to sustain interest even though Riel himself is the only character that is fully developed psychologically. (Brilliant singing and acting from Bernard Turgeon.) The rest of the mostly male cast offer entertaining vignettes as historic Canadian figures. The score's most famous number, called 'Kuyas' on a Cree text is sung by Riel's wife Marguerite as a lullaby to their young child, is superbly sung by Soprano Roxolana Roslak. (It drew titters from the audience when I saw it in Toronto in the 1970s because it is awfully loud for a lullaby!- 'Kuyas', which Somers allowed could be freely transposed for any vocal range for concert/recital usage is really virtuosic.)
The picture quality, except for a couple of grainy moments is very good, and the sound recording is excellent.
There is a libretto and intelligent liner notes, although it is somewhat odd that CD format packaging was chosen for a DVD. (The friend who bought this for me in Toronto had to be told that it was in fact a DVD !)",1321488000,5,1472,4.892
8448702,1,B004YP3TNW,"It was very fast service.  I just should have checked it out more, I wasn't expecting an opera type movie.  Which was probably my mistake not the sellers.",1315785600,,154,4.464285714285714
8448703,2,B004YP3TNW,I was disappointed in the music and acting - -  too stiff and poor performance. Much of the singing is in French which I cannot understand (my fault) which was somewhat of a surprise even though it was the language of the era.,1315612800,,226,4.255813953488372
