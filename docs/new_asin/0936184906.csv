172202,5,0936184906,"A must have excellent academic, thorough and entertaining culinary resource for all home cooks and professional chefs who desire to be a step above the rest, and not wasting their time in the kitchen reinventing the wheel. Regardless of which season, America's Test Kitchen takes the guessing out with detailed step by step instructions on how and why a certain ingredient, recipe and equipment is used along with a sleuth of informative factual and scientific tid bits explained in an easy-to-understand manner. Every season covers an array of primal and sub-primal meat cuts, fabrication, best cooking methods, equipment and product testing, ingredient taste tests, authentic to modern variation on many made-from-scratch global and regional soups, salads, appetizers, entrees, desserts, sauces, rubs, marinades and seasonings. Buy the whole collection and you will never be disappointed.",1272153600,2,890,5.649253731343284
172203,4,0936184906,"There are no recipes included on these DVD's - of any season - until Season 9.  Season 9 does have recipes.  Presumably they will be included in future editions, as well.  Clearly they wanted to sell the recipes either in the companion book or online, so it is to their credit they have started including the recipes on the DVD's.

There are many parts of episodes missing from the DVD's that were part of the actual season.  The web site has all the episodes listed with each and every recipe they did:  [...]

I have all of the DVD sets, and there are many, many of the recipes that are not on the DVD's that are listed there for the actual shows.  Although they say:

AMERICA'S TEST KITCHEN:  THE COMPLETE x SEASON  All 26 episodes

This is rather misleading, because they are not complete.

That being said, the shows are excellent.  I found the quality of the production to be very good.  The recipes are great, the episodes are fun to watch and they are often humorous.  I personally would prefer more cooking and less equipment and product taste testing  - that just does not require a video.  I can read about that.  It is helpful watching and learning from someone who is cooking, though.  I don't learn anything from equipment/product testing that requires a video.

I would recommend them in spite of these issues because they are very helpful, instructive, and fun to watch.

You can get all old seasons on their web site for 50% off and with quite reasonable shipping costs.",1262995200,5,1487,4.553030303030303
172204,5,0936184906,I love to watch America's Test Kitchen.  I am not quite as particular about everything as they are which is why I do not get their magazine any more...too many details.  But I do like to watch them cook so this is a good set.  I actually bought it for my mom for Christmas.,1226966400,,273,4.018518518518518
172205,4,0936184906,"If you're reading this review, you're probably already a fan of America's Test Kitchen.  If you haven't seen it yet, watch it on PBS before you buy.  I personally enjoy this show more than any other cooking show, but it may not be to your taste.

The DVD includes all 26 season four episodes:

Salad 101

Summer Tomatoes

One-Pot Wonders

East Coast Seafood

New Orleans Menu

Freedom from Red Sauce

Quick Classic Pizzas

Pot Roast

Maple-Glazed Pork Roast

Truck Stop Classics

Chicken in a Skillet

Chicken in a Pot

Steak and Potatoes

Steak Tips

Stir-Fry 101

Asian Noodles

Italian Classics

French Food in a Flash

Tea Time

Sunday Brunch

The Pancake Show

Cookie Jar Favorites

Summer Berry Desserts

Easy Sheet Cakes

Lemon Cheesecake

Showstopper Desserts

The DVD menus are all easy to navigate, although I would have liked to move from one episode to the next without exiting to the main menu.  Each episode is divided into chapters, with each chapter being a different segment of the show.  This nice feature makes it easy to find reviews of red wine vinegar, for example.

The only serious defect in the DVD set is the sound; it seems to me that the gain level is too high.  The result is that the voices occasionally sound distorted, which I haven't heard while watching the episodes on TV.  Still, this is a minor quibble with an excellent set.  I know I'll be watching these over and over, and many of the recipes will find a spot in my repertoire.",1126742400,21,1467,4.6156862745098035
