5666133,5,B00BQI4498,"My two year old LOVES anything dinosaurs and Dinosaur Train is one of his favorites. It does a great job of actually teaching all the types of dinosaurs and lots of facts about them. We love all the characters and the fun songs too! As for my purchase, all the Dinosaur  Train DVDs freeze my DVD player and after asking PBS they say it's not their DVDs but it still happens if I don't take it out as soon as it's over.",1409788800,2,418,4.097560975609756
