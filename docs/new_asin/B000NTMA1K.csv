2780791,3,B000NTMA1K,"I thought that this DVD was very well done. The animation is different from the typical Franklin story, even his other full-length stories. The characters are ""more animated"", for lack of a better description. For example, instead of the usual stone-faced Bear character, he makes funny faces. The music is also different-not annoying like the other full-length stories. Franklin and Harriet are not whiney, spoiled, and annoying like they usually are.
The problem lies in the story itself. Granny is dying of some unknow ailment and it seems that Franklin must find this magic talisman to save her life. That's quite a bit of pressure on a child, I would say. My daughter did not like that at all. We also get to hear Granny's story of hiding this talisman in a time capsule when she was a child, which is fine until you see the forest around her small pup tent erupt in flames, and watch as it creeps closer to her family's cabin where her parents are sleeping. She escapes to a row boat on the lake and watches and waits till the fire is gone. Then she sums up the story by saying that ""she lost everything in that fire"", and then went to live with some other family member. It's a pretty gruesome way to make the time capsule a challenge to find for Franklin! I wonder what the authors were thinking when they wrote this story line. I thought that killing off parents was just a favorite Walt Disney device. My daughter does not want to watch this again, it upset her so much. And even though it is a very well-done cartoon, I can't say that Franklin is one of my favorites, so it's not likely that anybody else will be watching it again either.",1200009600,23,1649,4.48172757475083
2780792,5,B000NTMA1K,"I was also, a bit surprised at some of the mature areas of this
film, but I felt it had a tender manner of dealing with the situations.
Perhaps this Franklin isn't meant for super small children - yet I didn't find
it offensive at all.  My daughter really likes this dvd.",1194048000,3,271,4.211538461538462
2780793,2,B000NTMA1K,"My oldest, now 4, has been a Franklin fan for as long as he's been allowed to watch television. He loved the movie, which is why I gave it two stars. My personal rating would be a one at most.

Why?

Mature themes your average preschooler isn't ready to handle -- or, at least, I'm not ready for him to handle. Granny's parents dying in a fire when she's a little girl, Granny almost being trapped by the fire while sleeping outside in her tent, Granny later appearing to be near death. I'll take the hit for having to explain what happened to Mufasa in ""The Lion King,"" but this is no ""Lion King""!

The depiction of Franklin in this one seemed to get away from the sweet, slightly whiny turtle in past movies, cartoons and books. They seem determined to turn him into Super Hero Franklin. I prefer the flawed Every Turtle. And in other Franklin works, there's always been a moral or values lesson. Not here.

This is the new movie in the house, so, of course, the kids are into it right now. But I can't wait to get them back to ""Franklin and the Green Knight."" That's one of the sweetest kids movies I've ever seen.",1193011200,3,1117,4.304761904761905
2780794,4,B000NTMA1K,"My daughter loves Franklin, so naturally, she loves the movie! It's a very sweet tale; a must for Franklin fans.",1181347200,,112,4.65
2780802,5,B000NTMA1K,I was very happily surprised when I received Franklin before two books that I had ordered several days prior. I am still waiting for the other books.  Thank you so much for the fantastic service. I will definitely buy from you again!!!,1364515200,,235,4.595238095238095
2780803,5,B000NTMA1K,My daughter loves it. She hadn't watched it for a few months and took it out the other day and watched it again.,1362614400,,112,3.9130434782608696
2780804,1,B000NTMA1K,"I generally like the Franklin videos because they usually communicate good values in the context of situations that kids run into in real life, only Franklin's a turtle and not a person.  While there are rarely ever any themes of spiritualism in Franklin, with such themes this movie is fraught.  The Turtle Lake Treasure turns out to be a talisman in which resides the life force of all turtles that Franklin must use to heal his sick grandmother.  And, in finding the talisman, he must receive guidance from a witch, who, upon hearing she's a witch, Franklin is reassured by his mother that ""she's really just a healer"".  So, unless you are raising your kids to be little pagans, this video is not for you, and definitely not for your kids.",1348272000,9,742,4.641221374045801
2780805,1,B000NTMA1K,"We LOVE Franklin, but this is NOT a typical Franklin story. If you love sweet Franklin stories don't buy this one!  My son gets very absorbed into any video he watches and I regretted letting him watch this one.  The characters did not have the same sweet personalities they normally do and the story was really, really strange!  I must echo ALL the other one star reviews!",1336435200,5,373,4.537313432835821
2780806,1,B000NTMA1K,"Received as a gift for my son's 4th bday. Glad I watched it with him! ""Dumb"" this, ""dumb"" that, death by fire, a seance and a talisman, and a dying grandma... Cra-zy! We finished it, wrote the thank you note and threw it. There are so many better choices for children- do your research.",1332115200,7,286,4.314814814814815
2780807,5,B000NTMA1K,"This is a favorite with wonderful lessons. Franklin and friends once again teach the meaning of love, family, friendship, and love",1319328000,,130,5.238095238095238
2780808,1,B000NTMA1K,"The movie is way too mature for young kids. It has a grandmother who is dying. And she also tells the story of her parents burning to death in a fire when she was a child and they went camping... why on earth they would make a movie for young children with that in it is beyond me... now any kid who watches this will never want to go on a camping trip with their parents for fear they will die!!! If you want a movie for your child, pass this one up and move to the next one you see. It can't be worse than this one.",1309910400,4,517,3.7962962962962963
2780809,5,B000NTMA1K,"It was a very good story for our daughter, 4 yrs, to watch especially since she lost her Nanny last summer. We have done a lot of talking about her being gone...when she brings it up to me. It is a shame that other parents cannot use this film as a teaching moment...maybe they have a hard time with death. I understand that it was unexpected from a Franklin show, but use these moment to teach not run away from life's uncertainty. Teach them that life is precious!",1305331200,2,466,4.306818181818182
2780810,5,B000NTMA1K,"I have to disagree with some other reviewers who think this movie is to gruesome or mature for preschoolers.  Me and my daughter have watched this movie several times over the past 3 years and love the movie.  It teaches that no matter how impossible a task as long as you work together and don't give up you can accomplish anything. Just like people shield their children from bambi cause his mom dies.  Thats your choice.  But to bash a movie because it's more of a serious story than your child can handle doesn't mean other children can't handle it.  It's a great story, a great theme and a great moral lesson of never giving up.  I for one think calling the movie gruesome due to a fire or grandma getting sick is a little overkill.",1269388800,6,737,4.382352941176471
2780821,2,B000NTMA1K,"I failed to read the reviews completely before buying this DVD for my 4yo son, who normally loves Franklin, and I regret buying this.  I totally agree with the other reviewers who commented on the mature story lines:  granny reliving the story of her parents dying in a fire upset my son so much that he did not want to watch the rest of it.  I convinced him to keep watching, saying that when movies have a sad part, a happy part is to come, but then there were some sad/scary sub plots as the gang went on the hunt for the time capsule -- Snail gets carried away by a bird and almost eaten!  I guess it has a happy ending, but at this point, my son did not want to finish it!  The animation is definately different, as well as some of the voices, but this doesn't really make a difference for those who are used to the tv show.  Might be ok for kids a little older.",1264982400,4,867,4.070588235294117
2780822,5,B000NTMA1K,"My children, now ages 4 and 5, love this movie!  They first watched it over a year ago, and they still ask to rent it from the library.  Now I am buying it for my daughter's 6th birthday, as she still loves Franklin movies and books so much.  The movie does include a dying grandmother, and it tells how the grandmother's parents died in a fire many years ago, but it doesn't scare my children.  Instead, it moves my children to think and feel deeply, and have sympathy for others.  In the end, Franklin is a hero and the story has a happy ending.",1257984000,,547,4.221153846153846
2780823,1,B000NTMA1K,"I thought this movie was pretty morbid and was missing the careless and normally heartwarming story lines that you expect from Franklin. It starts out nice with Franklin's Auntie coming home for a visit as she's normally out traveling the world as an archeologist and there's a nice family reunion. But the major part of the movie comes next with Franklin's very sad Granny who spends most of the beginning of the movie grieving the loss of her parents as a child. We even get to see a flashback as she tells Franklin and her daughter's Godchild where she watches her parents die in their home as it succumbs to flames from a forest fire. ""Granny"" the little girl then has to paddle out to the middle of Turtle Lake to save herself as she collapses in tears as she realizes her parents are gone. I find it hard to believe that this was necessary. Then Granny has an ""accident"" where falls into a coma and is unconscious for pretty much the rest of the film. Because of how morbid I found this movie, I threw the film out before my daughter could watch it. If you want to give this movie a chance, I recommend watching it before allowing your child to watch it.",1253318400,6,1160,4.4

It is a cute movie and my 3 1/2 year old enjoys watching it over and over.  if you are familiar with the Franklin cartoon, the cartoon graphic style is a little different and the faces of some of the characters are different, the older style cartoon is visually more pleasing.",1239494400,,303,4.490909090909091

2780827,4,B000NTMA1K,My son saw this on TV and began to demand to see it again.  I had to buy the movie and he really enjoys it.  It is a fun story about team work and friends and family helping each other.  There is a sad part about a fire involving Franklin's family.  This was very hard for my 4 year old to watch and I usually skip it.  I would caution to be aware of the fire part as I had to sort of reinvent what happened so that he would not be so worried about fires.  It does offer a good opening to discuss fire safety...,1221782400,,511,3.7735849056603774

Franklin has to deal with his Granny almost dying, and you find out her entire family except her was killed in a forest fire. It's a fairly dark tale. It does have some cute touching moments, but I wouldn't let children under 10 watch it. Franklin is a wonderfully sweet show and I love the animation.
