8429930,5,B000VJE1K0,"I wasn't quite sure what I'd be getting with this. I feared it might be edited highlights or cheesy voice over. But this is the actual ESPN broadcast (minus the commercials) of the May 1987 Winston 500 with Bob Jenkins calling the race. It's really neat to see how ESPN's coverage has evolved since the 80s, and seeing all those old graphics again really takes me back. I've watched up till Bobby Allison's big crash into the catch fence on lap 22. They don't skip anything. They show the EMS crews responding to the injuries in the stands and the cleanup while the race is red-flagged. This is not hi-def image quality so it probably wouldn't look good on a 50"" TV, but pop it in your computer or a smaller TV and prepare to go back in time and watch Bill Elliott leading the field in the Coors Ford, Dale Earnhardt in the Wrangler Jeans Chevy, Rusty Wallace in the #27 Kodiak car. Plus Nascar legends Bobby Allison, Cale Yarbrough, and Buddy Baker.",1364860800,2,950,4.4655172413793105
