8179044,3,B000NJXBJU,"This video is a re-do of an earlier one that I've had from the 1980s. It is useful as an introduction to a conversation now takiing place about ""historical trauma.""  As a teaching tool, it could be use to talk about historical trauma experienced by blacks in combination with a short segment on Native America historical trauma (genocide, boarding school, stigma from stereotyping and misrepresentation).  Other videos on this history ought also be considered: ""Slavery by Another Name,"" ""Traces of the Trade--A Story from the Deep North,"" and Our Spirits Don't Speak English--Indian Boarding School.""",1356912000,2,601,5.315789473684211
8179045,5,B000NJXBJU,"I use this video as part of any training, lecture, or presentation I do on African Americans, cultural competency or Diversity. I've used it with a number of diverse audiences - professional mental health practitioners, early childhood educators, business organizations, and with both Black and White participants. This short video provides an excellent structure for 'courageous conversations' on the impact of racism on both Black and White Americans. More importantly Ken Hardy's video gives members of the Black community the framework for the conversations we need to have with each other. I highly recommend this video. It is worth every penny.",1303257600,2,650,5.445544554455446
8179046,5,B000NJXBJU,"This is an excellent summary of links between contemporary African American Culture and oppression.  It highlights the practices of slavery and how the effects can have lasting generational effects upon a group.  For those who may be puzzled, impatient or curious about why African Americans tend toward certain responses to certain societal issues, this well-edited presentation sheds light on the matter and invites the viewer into an empathic position.  I consider it a ""must see"" for any social service person working with African Americans today.  It raises excellent questions and describes experiences that can be discussed with Black clients, friends and colleagues as a way of creating meaningful dialogue between races.",1192665600,11,729,5.54054054054054
