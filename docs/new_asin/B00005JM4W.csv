1483248,3,B00005JM4W,"You can't review children's movies like they're real movies, just on the target audience entertainment value. If you don't have young children you have NO reasson to sit through this one. If you have to take kids to the flicks, this one is just ok. Minimal bad language, nothing too scary, a couple of poop references. Daddy Day Care is as predictable as..as..as a kid's movie. There are no surprises to be had as the story unwinds. That is not a negative, just an observation on how just about all the movies for kids are lately.
Eddie is a big shot marketing man, loses his job and has to get creative in how to make a living. He starts a daycare as an alternative to the snooty pre-school college prep academy run by the villain in the story, Anjelica Huston. No one stands out one way or the other
My five year old thought it was just ok. It's a little long for that age, and the jokes are not really aimed at him. He liked seeing the daycare kids ruining the house in the early part of the movie, but some of the humor was too subtle for him (and not that funny for Mom and I) Parents can usually find an awww scene where you are shown how wonderful it is to have children. Those were also a little sparse. My 9 and 12 year old passed on coming with us and after sitting through it I think they'd have been a little bored.
I'm waiting for Eddie Murphy to make a good funny adult movie again. It has been a looong time since Beverly Hills Cop.",1052784000,4,1447,4.189964157706093
1483249,5,B00005JM4W,"Eddie Murphy hasn't made very many good movies lately. In fact, he hasn't had a hit in about two years. I sure hope that changes with DADDY DAY CARE. In the movie, Murphy's character is laid off from his job trying to market health food to kids. While sitting in the park with his best friend and former co-worker watching their kids play on the playground, he is struck (with some prompting from another parent) with the grand idea of starting a day care center in their home. Thus Daddy Day Care is born. Their business grows and the local mistress of the only other reliable day care in the area plots revenge. However, good triumphs in the end.
Before watching the film, I had read a couple of negative reviews about the movie in some local papers. The critics were complaining that the target audience of the film was too young to understand much of the movie. I disagree. The target audience of this movie is not youth. Instead it is anyone who has ever worked with children. As a former preschool teacher, I found this movie hilarious, yet emotional uplifting. I could relate to almost everything that the workers of ""Daddy Day Care"" faced and it reaffirmed my belief in the importance of working with children.
I was able to most able to relate to the character that Steve Zahn played. He has the best part in the entire film. Also, I found eery similarties between the evil director in the movie and the director of the child care center where I was employed as a teacher. It's a sad to say, but many youth workers loose sight of the children they work with and see them as objects instead of the special, unique people they are.
Kids of all ages will probably like this movie (there were a crowd of high schoolers sitting in the theatre and they laughed quite often at the antics on screen). Parents will probably enjoy it as well. However, anyone who has ever worked with children will probably find it the most enjoyable. Highly recommended and one of the best comedies to arrive so far in 2003.",1052524800,10,2007,4.501369863013698
1483250,4,B00005JM4W,"Question: What happens when you pair an advertising executive with a group of ambitious, yet run-amok preschoolers? Why, you get a somewhat disorganized (dis)array of chaos that is ""Daddy Day Care"". When Charlie Hinton (Eddie Murphy) is fired from his job as an ad exec, he has to look for another job. Hinton has some difficulty at first in finding a secondary type of employment, until he stumbles upon an opportunity at managing a day-care center. Together with a buddy (played by Jeff Garlin), they decide to tackle this new direction together. But, little did they know they would have their hands full; in the form of some hard-to-handle preschoolers! These two men have trouble adjusting to their new surroundings, until a third party named Marvin (Steve Zahn), who, psychologically, has a way with kids, is brought aboard, and all of a sudden, the wheels are set in motion. There are a few obstacles our three men have to encounter, those being a headmaster and assistant from an exclusive private preschool - who do everything in their power to put ""Daddy Day Care"" out of business through attempted sabotaging of all facilitated activities. These suspected violations are brought to the attention of a mild-mannered social worker (played briliantly by Jonathan Katz, who, along with Murphy, both steal the show). Ah, but Charlie Hinton & Co. get the last laugh - as they put the mettle to 'Ms. Cruella DeVille' and her assistant, as these two get real lessons on how a day-care center should be run. All this, including a non-toilet trained toddler (who, in the words of Don Adams, ""missed it by THAT much"") and his gang of merry misfits, makes ""Daddy Day Care"" a facility worthy of checking your kids into - the variety aged seven to seventy.

1484232,2,B00005JM4W,"I believe this is the first time that I'm truly disappointed with a comedy film starring Eddie Murphy.  The thing is, his character is completely bland throughout the movie.  No, he's definitely NOT his typical outrageously goofy self like in, for example, the Nutty Professor- for Daddy Day Care, he completely abandons his goofy personality and focuses on being a normal father trying to take care of a bunch of children.

The storyline is, as you can probably guess, about Eddie's character having to start up a day care center for the neighborhood children.  Occasionally the biggest day care competition in town will stick their nose in Eddie's business and try to shut down his semi-illegal operation (usually involving a stuck up overdressed snotty woman making an appearance) but the thing is, it's never treated like a serious threat.  It just feels like a normal day on the playground.  There's never anything *compelling* to grab the viewers.

Daddy Day Care misses the mark the ENTIRE time.  The storyline is bland, the laughs are completely missing, and Eddie's character is downright boring.

The only possible examples of funniness are found in the goofy things the kids are doing (such as one of them running around dressed up as a superhero, another one playing with a TV remote, and for the most part, kids running around acting like typical kids).  The problem is that there's nothing of interest going on while we're being forced to watch said children run around the house screaming and misbehaving.  The only positive quality I can find about these segments is that it's somewhat cute and adorable.

I really don't get the appeal of this one, unless you're someone who believes children are so adorable that featuring kids *alone* can save a comedy, and there's no need for any kind of interesting storyline or a need to laugh at anything else.  Me however, I was very disappointed.  I expected a LOT more out of Eddie Murphy seeing as how he's responsible for some of the funniest films I've ever seen.",1294099200,,2025,4.865889212827988

1484234,2,B00005JM4W,"Daddy Daycare is a fluffy vehicle for Edie Murphy and his new hairstyle (so weird, it looks like Batman's cowl). It is so light the whole edifice is made of cotton candy. It punches all the right buttons: set-ups for obvious jokes, touching moments with parent's and cute kids (not an ugly kid in the whole film!), plenty of eye-candy with improbably lovely and slender d-cup mothers dropping off their wee ones into Eddie' care, etc. etc.

The plot (if there is one, and I'm using the word charitably here) is that Eddie is a high-powered advertising executive married to his high-powered attorney wife, who is now a full partner in her law-firm at the tender age of 18 (...oppss! I'm sorry, that's the age of the actress playing her!). Eddie losses his job, and his hapless jovial chubby sidekick does as well. Suddenly, the bills don't stop coming in, money is tight, and childcare choices in the area are:

The EVIL WASPY PREPPY SCHOOL! THAT TURN KIDS INTO OVERMEN ROBOTS! Which is run by Angelica Huston, who reprises her role from ""The Witches"" (her acting in this is indistinguishable from that outing). Angelica's sidekick assistant is a nerdy girl (we can tell she's a nerd, she's wearing glasses!) with hair in a severe bun but who also sports a d-cup (don't worry, by the end of the film she's in a tight ""Daddy Daycare"" t-shirt, hair down like a hippie, and bouncing gratuitously for the boys, you'll get to see `em!).

So Eddie and his pal set up their own day care center in Eddie's home. Hilarity ensues. Potty jokes!

Beset with regulatory inspections by a sympathetic government official, they enlist the aid of their former office mate-copy boy who (surprise!!!!) has a magical way with children because of his own warped Star-Trek nerd infested immaturity! With the three of them Daddy Daycare is soon a screaming success!

So Angelica Houston pulls out the big guns (nope, not her assistant's chestmeat) and starts subverting their success. Hilarity ensues!!!

Soon, all the clients and children have abandoned the rules-based repressive uniformed school run by Houston and joined the loving, colorful, free-form, nurturing, spacious, profitable, Daddy Daycare of Murphy and his pals. As the white children leave Angelic Houston's school they all change into various absolutely racially and typically pure examples of all the colors in the rainbow children from a United Colors of Benetton ad. Angelica Huston doesn't even have to touch them with her wand to do it. Absolutely no mixed-race children appear in the film whatsoever, so don't be afraid!!!

The hugs-all-around ending is the dads stay home with the kids at their shining new $20 million dollar day care facility while the moms go off to their executive jobs in their chauffeur-driven jetpacks. Anytime anyone needs any money it just magically flys out their rear-end and into their wallets. Huston is reduced to a government job at which she performs poorly and in public, which everyone can ridicule. Eddie Murphy smiles for the camera with his super-nova white teeth and our eyes pop from our heads as our molten brains leak out the sockets and into our laps. The liberal Hollywood machine refills the empty cavity with Zombie goo and we scoop pabulum into our gobholes as we surrender our free will to the Matrix. The end.",1285545600,,3308,4.896428571428571

While we loved him in Dr. Doolittle and Dr. Doolittle 2, his preoccupation with fatherhood seems to be muddying his professional choices. Perhaps he has his eye on filling Bill Cosby's shoes, one day...but, while I love Eddie Murphy, he's no Bill Cosby. And that's a good thing. He's Eddie Murphy!  I don't know if it was the acting, the direction, or WHAT, but this movie just didn't do it for me. While there were funny moments (Siobhan Fallon Hogan as ""Peggy"" was hilarious), the funny moments do not fully redeem this work. I was rather disappointed to see the depths to which Steve Carr would stoop to make us laugh. Potty humor, flatulence and sugar-highs are devices used by uncreative, low-talented individuals who are trying to fit in with real artists. Honestly, there was nothing in this movie that Michael Keaton didn't already do in ""Mr. Mom,"" and Keaton did it much, MUCH better, in my opinion.  All in all, while it was enjoyable, I found it to be a sad rip off of a much better film...a real disappointment that not even Anjelica Huston could salvage. Okay, okay, the movie was fun and it did make me laugh, it had some touching moments and was well enacted.

1484337,4,B00005JM4W,"Eddie Murphy has had tons of set backs over the years. He's been in a few films that seem more like they were made by yes men than made by people who want to see him be funny. You know what I mean, the type where his buddies say ""Oh Eddie you are so funny"" even when he isn't. Fortunately that trend has begun to change and this movie helps that transition.

The story focuses around Murphy as a father who works in an advertising agency. Assigned the task of making veggie flavored cereal popular with kids, his team doesn't fare well. So much so that the campaign (which he said would fail) is dropped as is the team.

Out of work, fortunately his wife has just rejoined the work force so their bills are paid but barely. In reflecting on the costs of his son's day care, he gets an idea. How difficult can it be to deal with taking care of kids all day and get paid to do so?

Along with his also fired buddy, Murphy starts up Daddy Day Care. At first with mothers questioning the ability or motives of a man watching children, the endorsement of a lady friend ends up in his getting enough kids to get going.

On day one, the rude awakening begins. Everything from discovering that yes, it can be dangerous to allow children to eat sugar filled snacks, to how much damage one child not properly potty trained can inflict is discovered. By days end, Murphy is exhausted and has a new respect for mommies everywhere.

The pair eventually gets the hang of things and it all comes together. As that happens, it begins to affect the competition, a rigidly run near Nazi prep school for the day care set run by Angelica Huston. With the prospect of losing customers, she sicks the licensing board on Daddy Day Care.

This is only the first volley fired as Murphy rises to the challenge. The struggle goes back and forth as parents trust him and move from Huston's establishment. A final showdown is inevitable and the laughs along the way, as well as several touching moments between Murphy and the kids (as well as with his own son) make this movie not only fun but family entertainment as well.

While some critics lashed out at this film, I found it to be laugh filled as well as offering a perspective on male parenting that is rarely seen these days. By films end you actually find that these kids aren't all that bad. And neither is Murphy's career. Let's hope it keeps going for a long time.",1205366400,,2396,4.382882882882883

1484340,3,B00005JM4W,"Eddie Murphy's career has been hit and miss for many years.  After a lull in the 90s, he went from being an action / comedy star to being king of the remake.  He also found his nitch among family oriented comedies (with or without special effects make up), and this was one of them.

Eddie Murphy and his hapless friend were laid off from their jobs in marketing.  Eager to get back into the work force but wanting to still care for his son as his wife has returned to work, Eddie opens a day care center in his home.  He and his partner, also a father looking for the same thing, suddenly find themselves chasing after a bunch of hyper kids who they have no idea how to handle, entertain or discipline.  In a main subplot, Angelica Huston is the head mistress of a prep school nearby, their rival trying to shut them down.

The typical gender role reversal is always funny, especially to see men trying to care for children when they are so used to being in control of everything else and how little they really know about themselves, their kids, or anything.  It was also funny to see how there were some kids whose parents are absent, like Crispin's mom who just wants to dump her bad child on someone else while she keeps her face free of lines and wrinkles.  As well as the parents who just don't understand their kids (the one who wears his Flash costume at all times, the one who speaks Klingon, the one with seperation anxiety, etc.).

1484341,3,B00005JM4W,"I think the general feeling here is that `Daddy Day Care' is good clean fun for the family, but nothing extraordinary, and with that I'll have to agree.  The first time I saw the film I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  I laughed when I was supposed to laugh and when the credits rolled it was a satisfying movie experience.  I've always been a fan of Eddie Murphy, despite the fact that he has a problem with picking thankless material, and so watching him is pure slapstick, sarcasm mode, still maintaining the funny while watching his mouth, was a delight.  That said, upon my second viewing I started noticing the flaws I hadn't seen the first time around, and then last night, upon watch through number three I realized that `Daddy Day Care', while funny in its own right, is not a perfect film, but then again, not many films are these days.

So, as Charlie and Phil, Eddie Murphy and Jeff Garlin work really hard to deliver the laughs, and for the most part they work, thanks in large part to Murphy's generally comic presence.  They interact well together, if not albeit oddly, but it's really Murphy, and only Murphy who shines within the circle.  So, Charlie and Phil and partners, business partners, but when their health food division is abolished and they are left without jobs they soon find themselves in need of some money making alternatives.  After enrolling his son in a prestigious pre-school known as `The Chapman Academy' Charlie gets the bright idea to open his own day-care where parents can drop their kids off for fun and for much less money than `Chapman' is demanding.  At first their idea is laughed at but soon it becomes a phenomenon.  The kids enjoy it, the parents trust it and soon `Chapman' begins to boycott it.

Angelica Huston is one of the big redeeming factors for `Daddy Day Care'.  She's deliciously evil as `Chapmans' head mistress so-to-speak and you can tell she really enjoys playing this role.  Sadly her role is close to wasted and left as merely backdrop entertainment.  The film's main focus is, of course, the dads and their dilemma, but for me the film could have explored a little more the side plot of `Chapmans' main baddy.  As a whole though, it really is entertaining.  The toilet humor is a little tired, and the stereotypical children, from the ill tempered, the mischievous, the outcast, the sick one, yada-yada could have done with some revamping, but that's not enough to make me turn away.  Steve Zahn is funny, a little bit at least, but he's never been my cup of tea so I can't say much.  There are some memorable scenes and some forgettable ones, but at least the overall experience won't feel like a bore, a waste or a disappointment to you or your children.",1183939200,,2719,4.652719665271967

Please note:  This review is for my viewing of the this movie in the PSP UMD format.  I have not reviewed this movie in the DVD format.  Amazon does not offer a spot for reviews in the PSP UMD format, therefore, I am placing my review here.

First of all, I should point out, I'm a HUGE Eddie Murphy fan, back to his days on Saturday Night Live.  To the best of my knowledge, his professional career began on Saturday Night Live, with Joe Piscopoe, and even the lady from Seinfeld, (can't remember her name.)

So, you might say, I'm a little biased.  But if you see my other reviews for movies like 48 hours, and Another 48 hours, you'll see, that I don't let my biases cloud my judgement.  And my feelings after seeing this movie, are that Eddie Murphy is one of the most hilarious individuals on the face of the earth.  And this movie showcases his talents, to no end!

I really enjoy his interaction with his little boy, his wife, and the other kids and adults.  He is very versatile, and clever.

I would recommend this movie.  It rocks!

1484407,4,B00005JM4W,"Daddy Day Care just wants to make you laugh, and make your kids laugh too.

Eddie Murphy's best film in some time has him back in the warm and cuddly family-friendly mode. ""Daddy Day Care"" really is fun for the whole family as two suddenly unemployed fathers (Murphy, Jeff Garlin) decided to open up a pre-school.

The message - and it's there but only gently underscored - is that fathers ought to listen to their kids. Charlie (Murphy) is a business executive on the go who tries to make up lost time with his son, but doesn't really pay attention. When unemployment makes him the chief care provider after mom (Regina King) goes back to work, he's not sure what to do. Then he hears mothers complaining about the lack of affordable, quality day care and realizes there's a market niche to fill. That he understands.

The plot provides a rival pre-school run as a college prep academy by the tightly wound Miss Harridan (Anjelica Huston), but the story is really about the fathers finding out just how hard it is to mind a group of youngsters all day. It takes the arrival of a state inspector (Jonathan Katz) to make them realize the responsibility they've undertaken, and the addition of a third teacher - the airhead mailroom clerk from their old office, goofily played by Steve Zahn - to get them on track.

The comedy works both high and low. There's plenty of slapstick, such as the scene of the little boy not quite potty trained who ""missed"" the toilet in a scene already played to death in the ads, but there's also some clever writing as well. One of the best jokes, not to be spoiled here, revolves around one toddler who seems to be spouting nothing but gibberish. The set up and payoff show that some thought went into this, and it's not merely a series of pratfalls.

As he's hit middle age Murphy has mellowed, and his family friendly comedies, like ""The Nutty Professor"" and ""Dr. Doolittle"" show a desire to shift gears. A streetwise, fast talking Axel Foley (from ""Beverly Hills Cop"") is funny in his 20s. In his 40s, it starts getting to be a bit sad.

Jeff Garlin adds able support as Murphy's partner, thrilled that he's grabbed the kids' attention when he starts playing the guitar and singing, and even funnier when he realizes he's run through his entire repertoire. Steve Zahn's mail-sniffing, ""Star Trek"" loving Marvin is hilarious, while Jonathan Katz is nicely nuanced as the state inspector who's there to enforce the law but doesn't want to be a bully about it. The kids, as expected, are adorable, each with a comical mini-drama of his own. Stick around for the outtakes during the closing credits, for a wonderful moment with Khamani Griffin, who plays Murphy's son.

Here's a comedy with black and white performers which doesn't turn on one of the white characters pretending he's a rap star or a ""gangsta."" Instead, ""Daddy Day Care"" just wants to make you laugh, and make your kids laugh too.",1140134400,3,2927,4.649903288201161

I found this movie amusing, especially when their rival, the lady from the other day care, decides to stuff things up for them, because of her lack of students.

But, I guess it was cute and interesting and a little funny. The movie's simply about a dad that puts up a daycare center...in his house. So in the daycare, there's his little kid and many other little kids. The movie has some really cute little children and a good cast, but.. Well, the movie just didn't do it for me. The people that say this is hilarious..well... I guess they didn't see Office Space or the Farrelly brothers' movies. This isn't what I call funny. Maybe it's funny for little kids when a little kid kicks Eddie Murphy in his leg but that's not what I call funny. So, I hope I made my point that this movie was too babyish to me and not that funny and kind of boring but I guess kids will like it a lot.

Oh, and the only funny thing was ""i missed"" which a kid says after going to the toilet. A great look on Murphy's face and great music. But besides that..well let's just say it was cute.",1120348800,,1085,4.070093457943925
1484432,4,B00005JM4W,"Daddy Day Care is reminded of movies done long ago that were made for the whole family to enjoy. This a kiddie movie that kids, grown-ups, and teens will enjoy. It delievers the message in what most family movies do that family is important.

The kids are joyous, the script is decent, and the star cast does great in making this funny-family flick come to life.

The movie is Mr. Mom meets Kindergarden Cop. It starts when Eddie and a co-worker are laid off. When they can't find a job after a couple of weeks the two men decide to open a day-care center for some quick bucks. The two guys in that time aqquire a lot of kids and learn that it's hard to manage children especially when they are on sugar highs or bored. Quickly they recieve complaints from the headmistress at Chapman Academy a pretigious pre-school that dosn't like losing buisness to a fly-by-night to make a quick buck day-care. Quickly a rivarly grows between the two places and when the two Mr. Moms decide they want Daddy Day Care to a permanet establishment all hell breaks loose. But, then the guys get asked to do a job only problem they like what has become of Daddy Day Care and the connection they feel with their kids and the other children. So now the men have to make a career and life choice- daycare or career that offers lots of cash?

You can tell that Eddie has chemistry with the kids and he reminded me of how Arnold Swchwangger was with his kiddie cast in ""Kindergarden Cop."" The kids are charming and each of them really sparkles on screen and they are simply adorable in the interviews in the special feature portions of this DVD. I wanted to adopt all of them and take them home with me and I can't wait to see these budding youngsters in upcoming movies. Steve Zahn delievers a studded performance as the Trekkie and he too seemed to have a connection with the kids. I love Steve Zahn and I can only hope to see him in more movies to come. I loved watching this movie to see the real on-screen connections with the children. It's a comedic movie that's not over the top or too drawn out going for a million ridiciolous laughs as possible which you normally see in comedies.

With no negative language, offensive behavior, or nudity it's a movie I watch with my kids more than once and is a rare treasure to see. It's an entertaining kiddie comedy. All in all this one of those movies to rent or buy for family movie night!",1112572800,,2416,4.386160714285714

The movie had me laughing and the interaction between the kids and adults was funny.  Eddie Murphy is a little more subdued than usual, and Jeff Garlin is good as his friend and partner.  Steve Zahn is great as Marvin, the Star Trek geek who has a winning way with the kids; and Anjelica Huston--well, this talented Oscar winner proves she can do pretty much anything and be fun to watch.  Regina King (Ray) is pretty much wasted in the role of Eddie's wife, but the script doesn't give her much to do.  It's certainly not destined to be a classic, but it provides fun entertainment.",1109203200,,720,4.5
1484434,3,B00005JM4W,"Eddie Murphy seems to be trying to make a name for himself in the family film arena.  He did a pretty good job with ""The Haunted Mansion,"" but ""Daddy Day Care"" falls a little bit flat.  Murphy doesn't utter one curse word(an amazing feat for the foul-mouthed comic), but you almost wish that he'd say one or two bad words to remind folks that he was once the king of potty-mouthed humor.

As family flicks go, this one is pretty funny for all ages.  However, there are plenty of other kid-friendly films out there that will have a wider appeal than this one.  Murphy is funny here, but Steve Zahn and the boy who plays Murphy's son steal the show.  Receding rockers ""Cheap Trick"" make an appearance at a charity event to salvage the day care center opened by Murphy and his pals.  The majority of the supporting cast is used simply to give Murphy and the gang something to react to with silly faces, silly songs, etc.

In summary, this film will probably not offend anybody in the family.  However, it probably won't impress many family members either.  If you have small children, you might give this a try.  If you don't have kids, consider this a one-time rental.",1108252800,4,1166,4.504761904761905

1484477,1,B00005JM4W,"This was one of the worst movies of the last decade. I don't know how such an inane idea came up at a meeting of movie executives, but apparently they thought it would be a great idea.

Eddie Murphy's character loses his job and starts a day care with buddies. They all run around and laugh and make cookies. Heartwarming. But oooooh, there's a scary villian- someone who wants to educate children! Oh no!!

The head of a world-class school is made out to be a villain and a ""witch"" for daring to educate the children in her school, then villified again for reporting the bad conditions of Daddy Day Care. They were not up to the state regulations, but to report these fun-loving people was just too wrong, apparently.

So the apparent moral is that you should not learn, and that it is wrong to teach children. The ones who did not want to ""shove knowledge down these kids' throats"" (an actual quote from Eddie Murphy's character) ended up with a thriving business of crappy, ignorant children. The woman who had worked hard at teaching five languages to the children at her school lost her business and her livelihood and was forced to become a crossing guard.

The main problem is, it is hard to find any at least a daycare that is trustworthy to even leave your kids and not to worry at all if it is safe enough and cheap!
So back to question to unemployment. What do you do? Open an excellent daycare yourself! Open a business up! The only problem is you have a very strong and able competition, from an established day care who looked like preschool.

Out of all of the movies that Eddie Murphy has made this is one of the more enjoyable ones that even my kids can sit down and watch with me.

How wrong I was.
First, the movie is 90 minutes of non-stop non-laughs.  Every cliche (the missing Tarantula which ends up crawling on Jeff Garlin's head, Anjelica Huston's evil dictator role at the rival day care center) has been done before and been done better.  The kids aren't likeable either, except for the young man who plays Eddie's son, who's only likeable because he hardly talks.
I'm not kidding, not one of the four of us watching the movie laughed once during the entire viewing, and we did get through it, although there was talk of shutting it off.
Someone I know says that Eddie went from the edgy characters such as Axel Foley and Reggie Hammond to these cream-puff roles because he wanted movies his own kids could watch.

1484532,3,B00005JM4W,"If you like watching kids running wilding in your room or playing footbal in your yard, then you will love ""Daddy Day Care.""  This is not to imply any sarcasm.  The kids are in fact the most precious existence in this film, but is this not supposed to be an Eddie Murphy film, is it?
Like his previous ""Pluto Nash"" disaster, Eddie is the least funny presence in this so-so comedy.  He is Charlie Hinton, who recently lost his job.  With his pal Jeff Garlin, he accidentally starts a day care center for kids, including his own named Ben.  His ""Daddy Day Care"" center gets popular among the town, but the owner of posh preschool Chapman Academy, villainess Anjelica Huston (who hams it up like in ""The Addams Family""), doesn't want them to be successful, and makes her sabotage plans.
The film never avoids clithed moments, but that is not a big problem.  Director Steve Carr (previously working with Eddie in ""Dr. Dolittle 2"") follows the formalua of family picture, and as this is a family picture, you don't need anything that might possibly offend adults or scare kids.  You should know that rule.
But it is Eddie Murphy's film, and the problem is, anyone can play Charlie's role.  ""Nutty Professor"" clearly succeded owing to Eddie's tour-de-force performance, but no such magic here.  In other words, why Eddie?
Having said that, I admit the film has good moments as some of the supports are wonderful.  One of them is underrated Steve Zahn, whose acting is funny enough to raise the film several notches higher even without now-clithed ""Star Trek""-related gags.
But the most wonderful are the kids; you might say your own kids are as cute as they are, and, right, but you cannot deny the charms of these fourteen kids.  My three stars go to them.

Eddie was funny, and his clueless partners (especially the geeky character of Marvin) were excellent.  I LOVED the Star Trek jokes.

In one scene where the kids are running amok, he joins in the fun and runs all over the house.  He practices his fake (not sure if it was real) klingon words.  He also plays the games included in the DVD edition and they don't require a computer.  The DVD edition is not for sale here.  We rented it from Netflix and we won't be returning it until we buy it.

1484566,2,B00005JM4W,"A DVD collection contains movies worth watching over and over again. Daddy Day Care isn't a movie worthy of being found in a collection of DVDs. If I were a critic, I would give this movie two stars only because of it's originality and because it contains developed characters, conflict and resolution. Otherwise, I found that the story line was dragged out and that it should have contained more humor and better actors.
 At the beginning of the story, Charlie (Eddie Murphy), and his wife(Regina King) take a tour of and enroll their son, Ben (Jonathan Katz), at Chapmen Academy Preschool, a strict private school for young children. Charlie is a marketer for a new brand of cereal, Veggie O's, targeted to kids. His wife finished law school just before their son was born and, after raising him for a few years, is now going to pursue a career as a lawyer. Charlie's cereal fails. He and his partner, Phil (Jeff Garlin), lose their job. After he and his wife look for a cheaper alternative to Chapmen Academy Preschool, they realize there are no decent alternatives. Charlie, then, comes up with the idea of Daddy Day Care. Charlie, Phil and later Marvin(Steve Zahn) run a daycare out of Charlie's home. At the beginning of their business, the children are out of control and they provide no structure for them. But, since it is a fun place for kids to go, more parents enroll their kids. Conflict arises between Chapmen and Daddy Day Care when Chapmen loses enrollments to Daddy Day Care. Chapmen sends Child Protection Agencies back and forth to make sure regulations are carried out, in hopes that they would be shut down. Chapman's attempts to shut Daddy Day Care down fail. At the end, Daddy Day care uses the money made, at the fund-raiser they held, towards a building for the business.
  The plot is the most important part of the movie. The idea of the story was good but the plot began to drag in the middle. The repetition of arguments in the conflict faded my interest. There wasn't much humor to keep my attention. The only part that made me laugh out loud was when the little girls put makeup on Phil and he didn't know it until he saw himself in a mirror after he opened the door to the regulations agent. The best part was the end, during the fund-raiser. Kids might like this movie because there are kids in it. But, I don't think very many kids will even find this movie funny.
 Actors can make or break a movie. Eddie Murphy was the only well known actor in this movie. I didn't recognize any of the other actors. Eddie Murphy is a good actor in comedy movies but he needed another good actor to support him and strengthen the humor. Jeff Garlin did fairly well but the movie would have been funnier with Eddie Murphy and Jim Carey running the day care.
 I was disappointed after watching this movie because I really wanted to see it. I work at a daycare and I love children. I begged my boyfriend to watch it with me and then I fell asleep on him trying to watch it. Daddy Day Care is definitely not a movie I would watch over and over. You wouldn't find it in my DVD collection.",1070323200,5,3102,4.483185840707964

Even though a lot of the movies he's made in recent years have sorta been dull (but always funny), his artistic choices I'm sure reflect his maturation into full adulthood, fatherhood, and family-themed values.  Having said that, Daddy Day Care continues in that vain.  It is, however, an extremely enjoyable film and is supported (as usual in all of Murphy's films) by a wonderful and talented cast.  Especially the real stars of the film: THE KIDS!!  The casting directors are to be given alot of credit for finding some of the cutest, naturally funny bunch of kids that I've ever seen paired together in one film in a long time.  You'll laugh over and over again every time you see the scene in which Eddie's partner's son has a ""gaseous"" episode in the backyard, or the reaction of the kid with separation anxiety when first offered ""the bribe"", or...and so on and so forth (too many to name here).  The kids are HILARIOUS!  Eddie plays well off of them, as they do off of him and the rest of the cast.

But, I was pleasantly surprised when even a half hour into the movie, I was laughing and no longer dreading the rest. Eddie Murphy is funny and, although it is a regular old comedy, his acting has somehow improved. The boy that plays Murphy's son is hilarious! Some kind of comical-kid-genius. The story is about 2 guys who lose their jobs in advertising, and a friend, who start a day care out of their homes (well, actually just Eddie Murphy's home)
The kids will love the silliness and the jokes of the other kids, and the adults will like the heartwarming story about a father finally getting to know his son and the funny jokes.  I recommend watching it with the whole family!",1068249600,2,972,4.491525423728813
1484570,2,B00005JM4W,"""Daddy Day Care"" is a one-joke comedy that wears out its welcome in almost world record time.  The cookie-cutter premise involves Eddie Murphy and Jeff Garlin as two recently laid-off fathers who decide to open up a day care center in their neighborhood.
Once the setup has been established, the filmmakers shift into automatic pilot mode for the 92 achingly boring minutes it takes for them to spin out their story. The plot consists of little more than endless variations on a single theme: how two grown men cope with the problems and vicissitudes of dealing with preschool-aged children.  If the humor doesn't work, the sentimentality near the film's end is even less effective, as the moviemakers move in for the emotional kill, trying to bring some profound ""meaning"" to a basically hollow, studio-generated enterprise.
Angelica Houston provides some much-needed vinegar as the cloyingly named Miss Harridan, the uptight owner of a rival day school who spends most of her time trying to sabotage the efforts of the far more benevolent Daddy Day Care which has begun to usurp most of her privileged clientele.  Unfortunately, the role has been conceived as such an overwritten and overwrought caricature that even the talented Ms. Houston is unable to do anything even halfway effective with it.
This is another one of those movies in which Murphy gets to show his cushy, ""soft"" side, fine for the family trade, I guess, but not very inspiring for his legion of devoted followers.  Though ""Daddy Day Care"" may be unobjectionable as ""family"" entertainment (despite its over reliance on scatological humor), it is really lowest-common-denominator filmmaking - uninspired, unimaginative and unmitigatingly unimpressive.",1067126400,,1721,5.247272727272727
1484571,3,B00005JM4W,"This film is pretty self-explanitory form the title. Two dads (Murphy & Garvin) with little or no parenting experience get together to form a cheaper daycare alternative. They get in way over their heads initially, but after they are joined by Marvin (Zahn) they begin to relate to the kids and their issues.
The story is somewhat predictable, but still manages to entertain with comedy. Steve Zahn by far gives the best performance of the film.
Overall family fun.",1067126400,2,465,4.89873417721519
1484572,5,B00005JM4W,"As a co-owner of a daycare, and being male, I was really interested in catching this movie.
First of all, the kids are really cute.  Especially the kid who plays Ben, Eddie Murphy's ""son"".  But the entire cast of kids did a fantastic job.
I love Eddie Murphy so I wasn't surprised to be entertained by his antics (he has the best facial expressions in everything he does, very likeable).  But I also wanted to applaud Steve Zhan who did fantastic as a Star Trek geek.  I guess he stood out for me because he reminded me so much of myself especially when around fellow Trekkies.
As a daycare provider, I did find some things entertaining.  I've heard the horror stories from parents looking for a daycare, so the scene of Ben's parents trying to find a new daycare was quite funny.  The scenes of the house being destroyed... oh, there is no way around that with a group of kids.  You've got the inspector who we need to deal with on a regular basis (of course, we had to pass inspection BEFORE opening unlike this movie, but it was fun to see the interaction with the inspector).
One of the things that made me go, ""yeah right"" was the competition aspec.  No, I'm sorry, Day Care is not a cut-throat business.  Actually, there is a lot of business to go around and there seems to be no dominate player that nobody can raise a candle to.  That idea was very laughable to me, and I'm sure to anybody else who catches this movie.  But the plot would be thin without this aspect, so I can somewhat understand.  But I should deduct a star for the very idea...
...But I won't, and only because of the one thing I appreciate most about this movie.  Other than some brief questionable parts, this was a fairly clean movie that you can feel comfortable having the entire family watch.  Bravo for making a family movie, more need to be made.  It was nice to watch a movie and not grimace or have to turn it off because I'm sitting next to my son.  Hopefully some of the Hollywood Execs take note as the success of this movie.
I would recommend this to anybody.",1066348800,19,2050,4.355263157894737
1484573,5,B00005JM4W,"Movies that play kids in leading roles opposite adults are typically funny.  Eddie Murphy = very funny.  Therefore, this movie should be FUNNY ... and it is!  If you don't laugh during this movie, then you must have had your funny bone surgically removed.  It is getting less and less surprising to see Eddie Murphy in family comedies (i.e. no bad language), and I find it refreshing.  Eddie is every bit as funny without the gutter humor as he is with it.  Two thumbs up for the new, family-friendly Eddie Murphy!  Murphy is a perfect choice for this film, and the half-pint supporting cast is every bit as funny as the funny man himself.
About the plot ... Murphy and his friend are ad execs, working on a cereal campaign that is destined to fail, although they don't see it coming.  Not surprisingly, they lose their jobs when the campaign goes sour.  Murphy lives in a beautiful house in the suburbs with his adorable son and wife, who is a stay-at-home Mom (a refreshingly functional family vs. today's norm).  Their son was supposed to be starting preschool at the elite Chapman School, where Angelica Huston is the pompous and cut-throat head mistress.  Chapman becomes too expensive for Murphy's family as he becomes a stay-at-home Dad while Mom goes off to work.  Having trouble finding a new job, he gets the bright idea to start a day care center ... Daddy Day Care.  He enlists the help of his partner from work, and eventually Steve Zahn as well, and starts his own day care in his house.  The kids that he babysits in addition to his own play off Murphy beautifully, and lend very funny antics to the film.  When Murphy's day care becomes successful, despite several pitfalls along the way, Huston attempts to derail Daddy Day Care in an attempt to squelch what she begrudgingly realizes is stiff competition.  At the pinnacle of Daddy Day Care's success, Murphy is offered his old job back.  He must make a choice between his previous wealthy, powerful position and his son's desire to keep Daddy Day Care open ... therein lies the essential ""moral of the story.""  This movie will make you laugh and leave you smiling whether you're 5 or 35 ... well worth the purchase.  In fact, I'd say that adults will enjoy this movie more than kids, but it is at least safe to watch with the kids.
In terms of the DVD itself ... The Special Edition (the only edition I've seen) contains both regular and widescreen on the same disc, which is always nice.  The extras on this DVD are great -- they give you an opportunity to watch these funny kids in real life, and to see how incredibly bright and talented they are at such a young age.  The featurette is impressive graphically, and kids will probably enjoy it, but I have no idea what it has to do with this movie.",1065744000,,2769,4.542338709677419
1484574,2,B00005JM4W,"I really thought that this was going to be a funny film judging from the previews. But, sadly the trailers contain the funniest parts of Daddy Day Care. Eddie Murphy sleepwalks through this mess, cracking an occasional joke here or there but this is by no means vintage Murphy. The character development is slim to none and we hardly get to know lest care about any of the children or adults involved in the film. Eddie Murphy must blindly throw darts at scripts and take roles because he could not have read this thing and actually been excited about it. Daddy Day Care is a great premise ruined by a horrible script and lack of enthusiasm by it's main players. Not Recommended.",1065398400,,679,4.573770491803279
1484575,3,B00005JM4W,"I have mixed feelings about this one. It was good in the sense that it was clean and good for the whole family to watch. I didn't notice anything offensive in this one, plus it was rated ""PG"". It was fairly entertaining, but the plot was quite predictable. It could have been ""Mr. Mom"" almost. I thought some of the characters were overdone, especially Anjelica Huston's role as a competing daycare owner. And I thought some of the humor was lame, like the kid that always kicks adults in the shins or in the groin. That's for cheap laughs, but I don't think it's funny. Plus, I have a personal opinion about daycare not being the best for kids, no matter how fun it happens to be. But overall, it's a good pick if you want a movie that the whole family can watch together without anyone getting too bored.",1065312000,,806,4.38
1484636,2,B00005JM4W,"...but I jus' couldn't kid myself. Eddie Murphy is my favorite comedian hands down an' although his work has become significantly tamer an' less appealing to us old school fans in recent years, I still tend to enjoy any movie he's in jus' based on his charisma an' prescence. But, maaaan, is this movie awful. Before even seeing it, I had a bad feeling that this was goin' to be one'a his lamest movies yet. An' guess what? I was right. In fact, I was dead-on. Even looked at as a typical cutesy lil' kiddie movie where the toddlers kick people in the shin, burp, an' say disgustingly adorable things, this is jus' NOT FUNNY. Steve Zahn was the only actor that breathed any sort'a life into his scenes an' is the only reason I gave the movie two stars. In fact, the ONE truly hilarious exchange in the movie is when Steve's character is smitten with one'a the kids' mothers an' is sayin' all the wrong things (""I'm your daddy--I mean, no, I'm not your daddy. I'm your baby's daddy--I mean, no--""). Eddie is completely wasted here, an' the only time I found myself laughing at him was when he an' Jeff Garlin were in the broccoli an' carrot outfits respectively an' having a mock wrestling match for the children. An' even that laugh was a lil' struggled. I'm not tryin'ta put anybody down here, but I don't even see how dedicated fans'a Eddie could get even a chuckle outta this.
If you want to see sumpin' funny an' more adult-oriented from Eddie Murphy, then check out his stand-up material an' any'a his classic '80s movies. If you lookin'fa sumpin' from Eddie's recent years, then check out 'Life' or even last year's 'I Spy'. Those joints are hilarious in my opinion. But skip this mess; is' an embarrassment to Eddie's career an' I hope jus' 'cause it made good box-office receipts he doesn't stick to this kinda material. He's way too talented for this bullcrap.",1065052800,,1869,4.565476190476191

1484639,3,B00005JM4W,"It is still kind of amazing to think of the way Eddie Murphy's career has changed. Did anyone expect the Eddie Murphy from movies like ""Beverly Hills Cop"", and especially, ""Raw"", be doing movies like this?. Or any of the family/kid friendly films his career now consists of?. I am not complaining, since he does it pretty well, but it's still an odd thing to realize. This latest film from Eddie is a pretty standard, routine type of film, but it isn't without it's share of charm, cuteness, and a few good laughs. Eddie plays Charlie, who works in the market division of a food company. He and his pal Phil(Jeff Garlin from HBO's hilarious ""Curb Your Enthusiasm""), are laid off after their idea of a cereal made of vegetables doesn't get too favorable a vote from kiddie testers. Now that he is without a job, his wife(played by Regina Hill, formerly Marla Gibbs' daughter on ""227""), takes on the role of breadwinner. Charlie looks after his own son Ben, and after a meeting with a harried mother at the park, he gets an idea. He and Phil decide to open up their own day care for the neighboring kids. It's first met with some trepidation(two guys!), but it catches on. The thorn in their side is the evil Anjelica Huston, as a competitor whose own business is more like boot camp than a place to take your children. Usually, when you work with a bunch of cute little kids, you can forget being the main attraction. Thus so it is with Eddie and everyone else. The kids are cute and funny and make the movie. This isn't a slap in the face to Mr. Murphy tho, because he is still charming and appealing in his role as the harried dad. Jeff Garlin is just as equally likeable as his best friend Phil. Also on hand is Steve Zahn. This guy is always funny and appealing, even when the movies he is in sometimes aren't. He plays Marvin, a Star Trek geek, who ends up being the third helper at the day care. Party Of Five's Lacey Chabert, looking even cuter, lends her efforts to the proceedings as Huston's assistant. Speaking of Huston, one wonders why she is even in a film such as this. Whatever the reason, she really makes the character and is watchable(however nasty she is)every second she is on screen. There is a sense of her role in ""The Witches"" here as well. The movie is filled with the expected toilet and potty humor, but some if it works. It has the heart and warmth that you would expect, and yet, it doesn't seem forced or overly sugar coated to the point of cavities. It's sweet, it's cute, and it is very likeable. There isn't a single inventive thing in the plot or in the humor, and that may leave some viewers cold, but it takes what it has and makes it, surprisingly, somewhat pleasant. ""Daddy Day Care"" may be a write off the second the credits end, but it's an okay trip getting to those credits. A good family film.",1064707200,,2836,4.403809523809524

I could hear him groan, ""Oh no! How long is this movie? It's about what?"", but by the end of the showing even he was smiling.
 Eddie Murphy does an excellent job of playing Charlie, a man who lost his job when his 'Veggie-O"" cereal line did not make the production line.  After being dismissed he and his friend Phil decide they will open a Day Care Center! Ah.......now the fun begins as the Dad's take on the everyday antics of the little ones and the wrath of one Mrs. Harridan, owner of a more 'uptown'  Day Care Center that seems to be losing it's student to ""Daddy Day Care.""Angelica Huston, who plays the part of Mrs. Harridan, does an outstanding job as the villian in this flick.
  There were quite a few chuckles from many scenes in this movie  and the children were absolutely adorable! Reminded me a little of the movie ""Three Men and A Baby"", only this was three men and 14 babies and more!  I enjoyed this movie, it was clean, fun and left you with a good feeling!  Good job to all the actors, even the little ones!",1064361600,14,1144,4.2592592592592595
1484642,4,B00005JM4W,"When I saw a trailer for a PG-rated Eddie Murphy movie, I didn't think I was going to like it.  Let's face it:  Murphy's comedies as of late have been hit-or-miss.  But people actually recommended it to me, so I gave it a shot.  Now I must admit that I enjoyed it very much.
Murphy plays an ad-exec named Charlie who loses his job after his account for ""Veggie-O's"" cereal fails.  After weeks of an unsuccessful job search, he and pal Phil (played gregariously by Jeff Garlin) decide to start their own day care center out of Charlie's home.  Not only must they deal with a group of hyperactive kids, each with their own personality quirks, but they also face competition from a very snobby private pre-school owner named Miss Harridan (Angelica Huston).  Both Charlie and Phil soon find joy in parenting after their initial frustrations, thus reiterating an important theme of fathers as role models.
While many kids in film can be annoying, the tykes in this film are quite funny in an over-the-top way.  Even funnier are the grown-ups' reactions to them.  Observe the scene where Charlie is kicked by bratty Crispin.  Or the infamous ""bathroom scene.""  Both Murphy and Garlin's almost cartoon facial expressions are priceless.
It should also be noted that Angelica Huston makes a fantastic villain.  Her character starts off relatively tame, but as she performs dastardly deeds to save her school,  she becomes a wicked stepmother type with a voice to match.
Overall, this film is likable.  It's not genius by any means, but it's a nice comedy you can watch without any deep thought.  Plus, it's clean and entertaining enough to watch with your kids.  And it's ALWAYS good to find something to keep them occupied.",1064275200,2,1716,4.805460750853243

In the 80's Murphy gave us strong African-American characters like Reggie Hammond, Billy Ray Valentine, Axel Foley and Prince Akeem. But that was a long time ago. And it's a shame to see him trade a hard edge for movies like this.
It's so sugary it is literally sickening. It's about as subtle as a brick in the face too. Annoying kids who are obviously reading phonetically off oversized cue-cards held off camera, David Newman's worse than generic 'family movie' score, clockwork predictability and toilet humor (how many more family movies are going to milk fart sounds for all their worth?) are all you can expect from this film.
