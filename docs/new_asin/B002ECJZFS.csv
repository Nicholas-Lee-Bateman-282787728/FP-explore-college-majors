8367545,5,B002ECJZFS,"Like the other recent care bear tv-series releases (in the new look and style) it is more of the same, which is good. But don't buy this for the 'toy.' Consider the little figure a throw-away, since that is what you'll probably end up doing. It's a soft-foam figure, and my daughter easily (though unintentionally) tore his head off. And the character is random. They show here Funshine but we got Tenderheart. So buy it for the dvd and consider the toy a bonus until destroyed. At least the price is reasonably.",1254960000,5,512,4.576086956521739
