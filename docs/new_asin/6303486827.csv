7849556,2,6303486827,"I am going to compare this to the other Amityville movies, as far as I've seen.  The first two were good- I mean, the graphics were bad and all, but what can you expect from the 70s?  The storylines were interesting, and there were some good techniques and all that fun stuff.  I hated the third one, despised it, it was so horrible and demeaned the whole series.  This one didn't demean the whole series.  It wasn't very good, but it wasn't nearly as horrible as the third one.  If you haven't seen any of these, see the first two, and skip the rest.  None are as good as those.",1026000000,,579,4.209090909090909
