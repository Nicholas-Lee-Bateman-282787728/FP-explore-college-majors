8411438,4,B003ZZQ5YW,"Very cute film with Kareena Kapoor and Shahid Kapoor (sometimes listed as Kapur).  Story line is almost exactly the same as the Hollywood film Serendipity with John Cusack & Kate Beckinsale, which makes the ending a bit easier to follow.
Generally, if you like Kareena and/or Shahid, then you'll likely enjoy this film.  Supporting cast is also good, though the focus is really on the main characters.",1338681600,2,401,4.970149253731344
8411439,3,B003ZZQ5YW,"I bought this movie being a fan of Shahid and Kareena's after seeing them together in ""Jab We Met"". (Which incidentally, blew this one out of the water.) I expected the same amount of on screen chemistry with the love scenes, and it didn't quite work. They are both very good actors, but it's as if they had very poor direction.

I had a really hard time following the script, and different city location changes, as well as the large cast of ""friend's"" characters that each of them had. The plot kind of jumps all over the place, and it's difficult to understand where the relationship is going. There is not much build up to her announcing in the beginning of the movie that she's in love with him, other than one totally lame, and unnecessary song number. There is no awesome dance number from Shahid to speak of, and that's what he's famous for. I've seen all his other movies as well, and this one was pathetic. The music itself is not engaging or charming (other than the very first opening number), and it doesn't make you want to watch the fantasy song numbers again. Let alone buy the music on cd from the film.

The funniest part of the movie for me was when he dresses in drag to get into the girls dorm with his friends. But who wants to see the hero fall in love on site with the heroine in a love-type scene while he's in drag? Somehow it seemed like they were both trying, but didn't quite make it to the satisfied romantic ending that I was hoping for. When I sit down to watch a two hour long romance movie, I want to feel romanced, and it was lost in this. Shahid's character in the beginning is not someone anyone would want to fall in love with, and it's hard to believe him in that type of role as he's so different in real life.

It's lacking in the script department. It's really as if the entire production were basically thrown together for the sake of ""art"". Like the writers and directors were trying to make it too cinematically different, and it's too hard for the viewer to follow. The entire ending with them finding each other again in ""fate's"" different locations drove me crazy as it just kept going on and on, and I started to wonder if the film would ever end. (You know it's a bad sign when you find yourself longing for the clock to move faster so that the movie can be over. Especially when you are watching it with yourself!) I just kept waiting for it to get better..but the better part never came.

Basically boils down to this for me; too little romantic believable build -up, and too much angst in climax, too little make up romance in the last two scenes to win the viewer over. They obviously tried to re-create ""Jab We Met""-but without the witty engaging script and depth of characters, or cute song and dances to move the plot along.  And the results? They managed to produce one big flop. A huge disappointment, and totally frustrating for me. If this movie had been available to rent on-line first, I could have saved myself the time, effort and money -and simply skipped buying it.

If you are into overlooking all the basic rules of filmmaking, and willing to sit through two hours of miscommunication, and desperate soul searching, while wandering around through every on screen train station, hotel lobby, and airport in India pointlessly- then by all means, buy this movie.

But if you are looking for great songs, great dance, a great script, and great romantic entertainment; then buy ""Jab we Met"" instead.",1336521600,,3463,4.478605388272583

8411441,4,B003ZZQ5YW,"Milenge Milenge was a good Bollywood romantic comedy - heavily dependent on fate or destiny.  Although the plot is nothing new, the actors brought fresh interpretations to their roles.  I was never quite sure of how it would all turn out - which for me makes this a very fun movie.",1299369600,7,281,4.490196078431373
