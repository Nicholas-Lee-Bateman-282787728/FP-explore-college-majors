7905171,5,B000007PAE,Amazing actually I was excited to see it for sale as I was 9 years old and was in that movie and am now 66 years old so my kids will have it when I'm gone from this world:),1453420800,,172,3.4358974358974357
7905172,5,B000007PAE,"Saw this movie at the Winona Drive-In when I was maybe 10 years old.  I pretended I was Tommy Jo every minute I was outside on our farm.  Was fun to watch it with my 19 year old career 4-Her.  After watching it this time, guess maybe that movie was responsible for getting my parents motivated to start Winona Wranglers 4-H Club a few years later in 1970-1971.  And here I am, still 4-Hing!",1420588800,,390,4.22972972972973
7905173,5,B000007PAE,"Great ,uplifting story of a farm family  . Wonderful acting. Grandma and Grandpa will enjoy seeing the old movie stars of their time. Cattlemen and livestock exhibitors will love seeing the old showrings and show styles they have only heard about .Really nice to see a girl as the main character in a livestock movie. Several really good moral lessons explored. Kids of all ages who love animals will really enjoy this story. If you lead a 4-H , FFA or Junior Cattlemen's group or your child belongs to one, this is a great movie for them. It portrays  the dedication and family support  needed to be a junior exhibitor well. Suitable for all ages.",1410134400,,648,4.6173913043478265
7905174,5,B000007PAE,I saw this film as a young teenager and never ever forgot it. It was great to see it again some 50 years later. A little cheesy by todays high tech standards but still great fun.,1393286400,,178,3.9722222222222223
7905175,3,B000007PAE,"First of all, be advised: The DVD pictured (""VCI Vault Classics""), which is the same as I bought from an Amazon Marketplace vendor, is a DVD-R. I'm seeing more of that these days, unfortunately.
Now, about the film itself. This low-budget, independent production was shot mostly in and around Katy, Texas, and has the low-key charm and color of that sort of film. The filmmakers were trying for something in the Disney vein (the story is reminiscent of ""So Dear to My Heart"", and the title sounds as though it were modeled, perhaps unconsciously, on ""Lady and the Tramp"", which it does not resemble), but a misjudged story and script effectively quash that attempt. Some story highlights: A tomboy wins a calf (Champ) and begins grooming it for a championship; she lies in a mud puddle all night with him and comes down with polio the same day as a result; she goes from being bed-ridden to ship-shape in what appears to be just a few days; she enters Champ in a Kansas livestock exposition, Champ loses, she weeps bitterly, and Rex Allen sings her a song informing her that animals cry, too; she enters Champ in a Chicago show and gets the sniffles (which is pneumonia), and when she finds out that Champ, who wins the ribbon because the preacher sings a song in front of the judges, will be sold at auction for the beef, she goes into a coma and is hospitalized; to save her life, her family brings the animal into her hospital room; she wakes up immediately, looks at him joyously, and, during a series of cuts back and forth between her face and Champ's, you can see (if you look hard) that the filmmakers kept adding glycerin to the hair below Champ's eyes: He's crying, too! Let me tell you . . . that ending is a jaw-dropper.",1345507200,,1732,4.519108280254777
7905176,4,B000007PAE,"I saw this movie in San Francisco when I was about 12 and the story stuck with me all these years.  Even though I was mistaken in my memory thinking that Roy Rogers was the singing cowboy, it still was a good story.  It exemplifies the love of a person and an animal and solidifies the reason for family.  It is a story of courage and challenges.  Even though in today's world it might be considered a bit sappy or corny, it is a touching story of personalities, old habits and traditions, and beliefs. I am happy to see it on DVD because it is a lighthearted, G rated movie that I would like to share with my students, especially because it is outdated in costume, vehicles, electronics, and the like. They take so much of what they have for granted, I would like to show them a different lifestyle.",1341964800,,800,4.3133333333333335
7905177,3,B000007PAE,"Believe it or not, I also saw this film in its theatrical release when I was 9, at The Fox (a palatial theatre) in Stockton, CA.  It was a companion feature for The Parent Trap.  Anyway, I thought it was pretty touching at the time, but have to admit that upon viewing it again as an adult it is pretty corny.  If you're the nostalgia type, the opening sequence of a small town parade in the 1950's alone makes it worth it.",1077235200,2,423,4.134146341463414
7905178,2,B000007PAE,"Tomboy and the Champ tells of a teenagers dream and love of animals.  The Fat Stock Show and Rodeo is an experience in itself and to realize the fun and excitement they bring.  I saw this movie when I was about 9 when the whole town of Katy, it seemed like, rode in a caravan to downtown Houston to see the premere of this show with the stars.  What excitement to see the different parts that was shot in the town and then placed into the movie.  It was an experience that I will never forget! My Grandfather was in the movie as well as my mom and brothers and seeing us for the brief moment was neat.  To see the town now and how it has grown with the highway, mall, and such is what I like to see.  This movie would be more for young kids, I would think, who have dreams and to see that anything is possible if you set your mind to it.  Being at the Astro Dome with the rodeo is not anything in comparison to seeing the show of the kids' champions in the Houston Coliseum and being so close to the events and the stars.  What a movie!",1007510400,6,1036,3.995145631067961
7905179,1,B000007PAE,"I have never met another person in my nearly half century of life who saw this movie in the theaters when it first came out.  I was a child of five sitting on the front row and the star who plays the press agent in the  movie came out on stage afterwards and asked me to dance with him in front  of the packed house at the wonderful, old Metropolitan Theater in downtown  Houston.  ""Tomboy and the Champ"" is the story about a little girl  who overcomes obstacles to raise a champion angus and features a cameo by  the cowboy singer/star Rex Allen.  The movie itself is pretty simple and  silly at times with somewhat weak acting and dippy interjected songs, but  nowhere will you get a better feel for life in the 1950's in Texas.  You  will see many Houston landmarks which have either been outgrown or torn  down (just like the Metropolitan where I viewed this film).  The story line  includes a bout with the outdated disease polio.  Sickly sweet, but  definitely a walk down memory lane for retro buffs and any  ""child"" who had the opportunity to experience the Fat Stock Show  and climb on the rails at the old Houston Coliseum to shake hands with a  rodeo star.",943488000,4,1167,4.415094339622642
