The DVD also helps you to show your son that different feelings can come with the new brother or sister, but anyway he are going to love the new member of the family.",1142812800,2,363,4.126760563380282

7987498,4,B00008WJB4,"In Arthur's Baby,Arthur has another sister,(D.W was bad enough)and D.W thinks she is the best at the subject. In D.Ws Baby,D.W's parents are paying much more attention to the the new baby than to her,so first she tries to make her parents think the baby did something bad,so she said to her mother that the baby destroyed a building,then she put slice of baloney in the CD player,then she put her father's new shoes in the dishwasher. But D.W just got in trouble for that. So she tried to run away,but thought that it was sad to not have every single one of these,father,mother,sister,and brother,not that D.W liked brothers,and she thought that she couldn't let Arthur teach the baby how to do things. That teaches that when a baby comes,your parents have to pay a lot of attention to it,and you have to put up with it. A good buy.",976579200,4,832,4.553333333333334
7987499,5,B00008WJB4,"We try to keep the TV to a minimum, although that has changed since having our second child.  My 3 year old watches this over and Over and OVER again - she just had a baby brother of her own and can relate to it I guess.
We  have a number of other videos, but 9 times out of 10 she'll ask for the  Arthur one - if she could type she'd give it 5 stars.",942624000,12,351,3.5921052631578947
