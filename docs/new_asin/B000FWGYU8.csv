8127506,3,B000FWGYU8,"You need to know some of the German post war history in order to appreciate this movie.
The film is like a comedy version of the RAF terrorist group in West Germany.
I liked the movie, but I do not think it is as good as some of Fassbinder's other movies.",1444953600,3,255,4.019607843137255
8127507,5,B000FWGYU8,A wonderful movie by Fassbinder taking on a critical look at the German Terrorism of the 70s. Would recommend this for all people interested in New German Cinema.,1332547200,2,162,4.821428571428571
8127508,5,B000FWGYU8,"This is one of Fassbinder's last films, and one of his most provocative and controversial.  As the other reviewers have noted, this was made during a time when West Germany was dealing with many homegrown terrorist groups, and Fassbinder's films skewers both the left and the right, and sees their so-called political struggle as BS.  The tag line for this film (on some posters) was ""I don't throw bombs.  I make films.  RWF."".  I love the fact that Fassbinder quoted 2 films in this film, Robert Bresson's The Devil Probably (it's playing on the TV monitor at the beginning of this film), and Tarkovsky's Solaris.  The Devil, Probably reference is really potent, as Bresson's film (made in 1977) was tremendously controversial at Cannes and in France.  It was about a teenager who pays someone to kill him, and the French government felt that it was glorifying suicide, and attempted (unsuccessfully) to have the film banned.

This film is one of Fassbinder's most interesting films, showing (along with Mother Kusters Goes to Heaven) that political factions are essentially the same in their quest for power, and that only the names change once in a while to keep things interesting.  It's nice to see a filmmaker stay clear of politics, as I feel once an artist goes political, they become shrill and myopic in their point of view, and it lessens their art.  It also has one of Fassbinder's most audacious soundtracks, with layer and layer of sound (mostly news casts being heard throughout the film) that can confuse the viewer a bit.  It's still fascinating, as all Fassbinder's films are.",1190160000,13,1595,4.892193308550186
8127509,5,B000FWGYU8,"perhaps fassbinder's best (which is saying a lot)... it starts what i consider to be fassbinder's finest period of his career. This is a comedy but not without its share of social commentary, political spoof, and cinematic homage.. Fassbinder unveils the hypocrisy of political movements and the viscious circles that lay beneath the desire for changing things in a revolutionary manner.. Fassbinder clearly identifies with those who want change but uncovers the fundamental absurdities of these political hypocrites.. This is a common Fassbinder theme - realizing a problem but having no way of fixing it without undermining your original intentions.. history in this light is doomed to repeat itself infinitely.. this is one of fassbinder's most brilliant achievements in the realm of social and political commentary.. It is also one of fassbinder's most personal works - this movie and 'in a year with 13 moons' were almost single handedly crafted by fassbinder himself - acting as camera man, director, writer, and co-editor..",1168819200,6,1030,5.364197530864198
8127510,4,B000FWGYU8,"Fassbinder takes on the Baader-Meinhoff crew shortly after their demise; in this satirical ""thriller"" bourgeois nihilists terrorists are in fact unwitting tools of the state security apparatus, who stagemanage the revolutionaries kidnappings and assasinations to justify subsequent erosions of civil liberties. I guess that makes this timely. (Though I will say the rhetoric and delusions of the would-be revolutionaries will sound awfully familiar if you've ever hung around anti-globalisaton/anti-Wal-Mart/anti-free trade G-8 protestor types.)

Icy and mordant, this film is a detour from RWF from his Sirkian tear-jerker mode. Third Generation is more a riff on Godard's La Chinoise, ten years later, where the utopian dreams of the 60's have now degenerated into nihilism and narcissism.",1152489600,11,791,5.878260869565217
