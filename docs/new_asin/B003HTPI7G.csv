4690631,3,B003HTPI7G,Wife was not impressed with this one. Geena does play an excellent drunk disfunctial paretn in this one. But man these folks are have the worst problems.,1354665600,,153,4.703703703703703
4690632,1,B003HTPI7G,"Unlike the movie, let's keep this short and sweet. This movie was miserable to watch. It pulled out all the stops to be quirky and interesting, but in the end, it was about a group of repulsive characters, not being funny.",1354147200,,222,4.439024390243903
4690633,5,B003HTPI7G,This is one of those movies that you didn't hear much about and yet it slipped through the cracks and onto video before I even knew it was out there. My family and I have watched this movie over and over...can't watch it too much,1331942400,3,229,4.111111111111111
4690634,4,B003HTPI7G,"..between a black comedy and a straight drama.  There are some laughs along the way.  The degree to which this guy's life is accident-ridden is what gets you chuckling in a few places, though it wasn't as funny as some I've seen in this genre.  For a much funnier black comedy around seriously dysfunctional families, it's hard to beat Almodovar's very twisted but touchingly hilarious ""What Have I Done To Deserve This"".  All the same, ""Accidents Happen"" is a fairly well-made picture with good performances all around, not least of which is given by the main star Harrison Gilbertson who puts in a great turn as Billy.  Reminded me of some middle-school friends I grew up with.",1302566400,2,679,4.769230769230769
4690635,4,B003HTPI7G,"This was a well produced video that held your interest.  No guns blazing, no fighting, sex or drugs (well except for the one joint  and an alcoholic son). It was just a well made and acted movie with some black humor that never seemed to end. In the credits I could not believe it was made in Australia, everything said and looked like SURBURBAN AMERICA. Good video, see it, buy it keep it. Not a block buster but it kept you interested with a tear or two near the end, along with humor.",1290038400,2,487,4.225806451612903
4690636,4,B003HTPI7G,"I saw this film yesterday at a regional film festival in Dubbo NSW.  It is one of several Australian films (yes, it was shot in suburban Sydney!) in recent years, aimed at the American market.  But it remains thoroughly Australian in its quirky, almost black humour at times.

The film revolves around the central character of Billy Conway and his dysfunctional family (in fact, all the characters seem a bit that way inclined...).  It recounts his misadventures and disasters, from the opening scenes where he plays under the hose sprinkler on his front lawn while the next door neighbour accidentally incinerates himself, to the car accident which kills his sister and puts his dynamic & mischevious older twin brother Gene into a vegetative state.  When he takes up with Gene's 'partner-in-crime' Doug, son of a neighbouring family, they accidentally kill HIS father as well... The lovely Geena Davis plays a convincing and at times heart-rending role as Billy's sharp-tongued mother Gloria, ably backed by some wonderful emerging new talent in 14-year old Harrison Gilbertson as Billy, and Harry Cook as the also-ran 'other' twin brother, Larry (whose performance is loosely reminiscent of Gabby Millgate's character Joanie in Muriel's Wedding... ""Muriel, you're awful..."").

The ensuing trail of accidents & disasters (""I'm not exactly a good luck charm,"" Billy tells Doug at one point) are actually woven between some moments of genuine pathos and depth.  The consequent collision of guilt, truth and self-discovery prove to be just what Billy and his family need to move on.

There are also some humorous cameos, like the two policemen... who become more of caricatures as the film progresses.  And never underestimate the potential of a bowling ball....

Quirky comedy, coming-of-age movie, nostalgia trip... this film crosses over between several classifications.  It was a pleasure to watch, evoking as it did considerable laughter, some tears, and a good deal of hope... and some profound moments to boot.

I was surprised at the R rating, despite a couple of graphic scenes... perhaps the innate black humour was not understood by the classification board as well as the audience I watched it with.

It is the debut feature from Australian writer/director Andrew Lancaster.  Accidents Happen was also runner-up in the Audience Award at the 2009 Sydney Film Festival and was included in the Official Selection of the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival.

I look forward to seeing more of some of the previously unknown new talent in this film.",1283126400,5,2545,5.173170731707317
8471635,5,B003HTPI7G,"I actually worked on this film when it was filmed in Lane Cove (Sydney) Australia and met Geena Davis and Harry Cook.  Loved it,. wanted a hard copy for my collection,",1459209600,,167,4.387096774193548
8471636,1,B003HTPI7G,Terrible movie,1434499200,,14,6.5
8471637,5,B003HTPI7G,"This is an exceptionally thoughtful, well written and spectacularly cast film. An Australian production featuring an American family retold from literal narrative of the authors autobiographical story of loss and adolescence. The music is well chosen. Geena Davis is brutally derogatorily verbose. Well worth watching more than once.",1387584000,2,333,5.958333333333333
8471638,1,B003HTPI7G,"I almost turned this off after five minutes, but it was so horrible that I couldn't stop watching it.  I didn't find any humor in it, and apparently when the writer didn't know what to do, he just killed off another character.  The only highlight of the film for me has been telling my friends and family about how stupid it was.  As I was telling someone about it this morning, they were laughing after the second death.",1377993600,,421,4.371794871794871
8471639,2,B003HTPI7G,"I wonder what the director wants us to take away from the ending?  I almost turned it off the first few minutes the film was so poor.  However, I continued to watch thinking it would get better.  I was wrong.",1371513600,,208,4.15
8471640,4,B003HTPI7G,"It is so good to finally see Geena Davis back on the big screen! Davis has always been one of my favorite actresses, showing a quick wit and a calm demeanor that has led to some tremendous films. In the new direct-to-video dramedy, Accidents Happen, she proves that she may have been on vacation for a while, but she hasn't lost a thing. In this film, Davis plays the mother of sixteen year old Billy Conway, (Harrison Gilbertson), who always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The film starts with a childhood accident that destroys his family and really defines just who Billy is. After a chilling, but hilarious opening, the film jumps to a sixteen year old Billy and what's left of his family. His mother is crazy, his brother's a drunk, and his father just isn't around anymore, so it's up to Billy to deal with the trials and tribulations of a boy who is growing into a man. Davis is listed as the star and she has some amazingly funny lines, but the story is really centered around newcomer Harrison Gilbertson, who gives one the best performances by a teen actor that I've seen all year. Gilbertson very clearly shows us how Billy is seeming unaffected by what happens to him, he's strong, and seemingly ready to deal with anything, but on the inside, Billy is much different than he appears. The character was a deep one with many levels and Gilbertson takes us through them all with ease. I loved this film, because while it's dark and depressing at times, they also joke about these things that you're not supposed to joke about. Just when things seemingly become to much, that humor creeps back in and makes you love how wickedly fun this film is. If you want to see something different, that will have you going back and fourth between laughter and tears, then this is the film for you. I went into this film expecting nothing, just looking forward to seeing Geena Davis again and what I got instead was one of the best movies I've seen all year.",1368921600,,1974,4.486111111111111
8471641,4,B003HTPI7G,"This is a story about dysfunctional families in early 1980's suburbia.  The movie focuses first and foremost on a young kid named Billy who battles with rebellion, growing up and trying to avoid making the wrong decisions with no luck.  His Mother is played exceptionally by Geena Davis who is truly the rock holding this little sleeper movie together.  It's great to see her working in a movie again since 2002, but if only it were a big blockbuster hit.  Watching this you remember why she is considered one of the greats.  This is by far no blockbuster, but a movie about people and their difficult lives.  It's not totally dreary and nor is it a comedy.  It falls almost comfortably somewhere in between.",1363651200,,708,4.661290322580645
8471642,3,B003HTPI7G,"There's nothing much new here.  Several teenage boys have to deal with death, divorce, injury, and police.  The performances were fine, but the script needed work.  It's not enough to pile tragedy on top of tragedy.  Note to all producers: I'm getting tired of every late 70's car being showroom clean and waxed and every 80's house having 3 lamps in every room.",1361145600,,362,4.698412698412699
8471643,4,B003HTPI7G,"I have watched this movie several times.  It is funny, scary, and has a great ending.  I would definitely recommend it.",1360800000,,119,4.619047619047619
8471644,5,B003HTPI7G,"This is a excellent comedy and well put together.  When looking at it.  Just about every scene reminded me of something that happened to me in life.  I normally don't look at the arts in this way.  But, this movie just stuck out there in my face for real.",1357603200,3,255,4.142857142857143
