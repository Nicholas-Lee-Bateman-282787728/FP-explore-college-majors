8398709,3,B003KHJJ20,"I do like this DVD. I think it lacks direction though. It almost seems as if Sab Grey is behind this project. It focuses on Iron Cross a lot  ,which  is fine cuz I am a huge I.C. fan. Good interviews with members from a lot of Oi, hardcore and ska bands. If you are a SKIN you'll enjoy having this in your collection, but I would not pay more then $10.00 for it. I paid a little more than that and felt I wasted some cash.",1363046400,,422,3.839080459770115
