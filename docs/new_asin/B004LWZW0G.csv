4412337,5,B004LWZW0G,"Prior to watching BILL CUNNINGHAM NEW YORK, my unexamined assumptions about him - a Times fashion photog - were that he must be a man who spends his days and nights hanging around fabulous people and documenting all the fabulous things they do. In short, not typically my thing. However, after watching BILL CUNNINGHAM NEW YORK, what emerges in this terrifically edited film is a deeply profound and beautiful study of a TOTAL artist working within the grayer than ever world of journalism. This is one of the most carefully and delicately plotted documentaries I've seen in some time and the ending of this film is ... devastating! Yet, even with the rather dark and sad turn that this film takes toward the end (you'll have to see it), you'll walk away from this doc feeling buoyed by the spirit and character of this remarkable and remarkably unusual man. This is a classic and he is a class act.",1314489600,57,899,4.660377358490566
4412338,5,B004LWZW0G,"Bill Cunningham New York snuck up on me and made me feel so many things... First,  If you love NYC this is a must see film.  I had no idea who Bill Cunningham was, however his story changed my life.  Bill's passion for fashion on the streets of NYC is the premise of the film.  It will prompt you to find your passion and live it!!  Can't wait till it is out on DVD.  I will buy it the day it comes out and share with friends who didn't get a chance to see it in theatres.",1314144000,13,472,3.814432989690722

4413105,5,B004LWZW0G,"One of the most beautifully directed and edited documentaries about any individual. The deeply private, intensely committed subject brought honor and taste to the world of popular fashion and dethroned some of the press moguls that had stultified the field.

What a wonderful man and what a superb documentary study if what one individual can accomplish in an utterly crazy world.

One of the finest non-fiction films I have ever seen.

Bravo, Bill!",1476403200,2,449,5.123287671232877
4413106,5,B004LWZW0G,This documentary gives those of us outside of New York City a small glimpse into the world of fashion through the eyes of a well known and favored photographer to some of New York's most well known icons.  To hear in an interview from Anna Wintour how her admiration of Bill Cunningham overflows exemplifies his influence and acceptance into the fashion world.  Learning about his philosophy of never accepting even a glass of water when he attends events to photograph the fashion reminds you of how to truly follow your passion and gives meaning to Bill's motto of not accepting money but rather his love of what he does provides him with such pleasure.  Getting to know a sliver of who this man was is heartwarming and his genuine passion and love of what he does is incredibly inspiring.  Well done and uplifting this documentary will warm your heart.  He is funny too.  We should all be so lucky to know someone even close to this type of man.,1476316800,,948,4.579881656804734

He was something of a genius savant and as he days in the film, you may think fashion is frivolous and useless, but it is an essential part of life, a part of who we are, a search for some beauty in our everyday life, that makes life bearable.

In today's  world, with humans around  changing  from light to darkness, from goodness to badness, from peace to violence , made me think that we have to look for beauty in nature, in people, all around.

4413667,5,B004LWZW0G,"I've never lived anywhere near New York, but I read the NY Times every day and always looked forward to Bill Cunningham's photos. He didn't just concentrate on socialites--most of his photos were of regular people, even teenagers--and the great way they put clothes together and had fun. Life is hard enough these days, with so much bad news and sadness. Smiling at Bill's pictures of people who dare to express themselves however they want through fashion seems silly, but it's just a tiny part of the day that makes me feel that things aren't all bad, and there's still fun to be had. I was so sorry to read of Bill's recent death, but we'll always have his photos to look back on and smile at. Thanks, Bill.",1468195200,,710,4.511627906976744

4413735,5,B004LWZW0G,"A warm and wonderful documentary about Bill's life on the street in New York City, always searching for new ways humanity expresses itself through its attire.  That he survived so long on his bicycle in the streets of Manhattan is a miracle; that he brought us so much color and life, is something we should always treasure.  Although monk-like and very private himself, he brought himself and his viewers great pleasure from capturing the freedom of expression of others.  The other half of Bill was feeding the egos of society people at charitable events - which he chose not by the names attending, but the quality of the event.",1467676800,,631,4.770642201834862

Lovely film - he seemed childlike/naive  and loved what he did. By the book Catholic upbringing seemed to stunt him in some aspects.
I liked that he was not in to the 'scene' - just the clothes - no matter who wore them. I do wonder if some NY-ers costumed-up because they knew he was out and about there.
No kitchen! Kind of kooky - but material things did not matter to the gentle soul.

I loved how it actually made Mr. Cunningham  vulnerable through his introspection [which he allowed to be shown]. His dedication to capturing the raw / unfettered beauty of fashion [or as he puts it, 'personal style'] is so refreshing and makes me respect the dedication to his craft all the more. It amazes me how highly respected he has remained in the industry since the 60s (I mean, being besties w/ Brooke Astor?!?!? AMAZING!!!!). I have always been curious about his 'chosen uniform' - being such a lover of fashion and yet his explanation made total sense to me (highly respect that). Ever the utilitarian, his resolve to getting everywhere in NYC via his bicycle (29 variations, I believe he said), even though it has been stolen time & time again, makes one respect his drive and resolve to remain a 'free spirit' w/o all the trappings the fashion industry has repeatedly offered to him on a silver platter.

4415165,3,B004LWZW0G,A unique experience.  Beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder.  Fashion is such a personal choice but Cunningham managed to capture the uniqueness of ordinary people with extraordinary taste.  To truly enjoy Cunningham's work the viewer must have an open mind.  Capturing that special picture was more important to Cunningham than his own safety.  Cycling through NYC in all kinds of traffic to capture that special image was truly incredible.,1455580800,,446,5.138888888888889

It is also an opportunity to see how one person is living his life. Cunningham is wonderful. He feels comfortable in all mileus of society without comprising his own values. I thought some questions asked by the interviewer were irrelevant and intrusive. In this day and age, the only person who should ask someone about his or her sexual preference is a potential suitor or possibly a physician. Despite that, it's a wonderful film on an individual who has dedicated his life to seeking beauty.

4415546,4,B004LWZW0G,"On the one hand, it was interesting to see the legendary Cunningham at work, and there were many intriguing revelations: Cunningham's continued use of old school film, the fact that the NY Times doesn't develop that film, Cunningham's rooming at Carnegie Hall and his use of a bicycle...The film is well constructed, though I do believe it becomes a bit repetitious in content and tone; indeed, quite often I felt like I had seen the sequence I was watching just a few minutes before. I find the fashion world shallow and self-important on the whole, though there are outposts of true art and talent and appreciation, and it is evident that Cunningham himself is just such a bastion. However, at the same time, the documentary oddly never captured a real person, but rather a persona. The photographer is devoted to his work and subject, and yet one sees behind the mask of a chuckling, earnest gent for only a few seconds, when he is bent over and pondering the answer to a question about religion. In that single moment, we get a sense of a serious person, though that is conveyed only by a silent pose. Anyway, despite the repetition and sometimes self-indulgent mood, this is a worthwhile profile of an icon.",1417478400,,1212,4.721698113207547

4415596,5,B004LWZW0G,"This is a delightful film about a delightful man (albeit, an unusual one).

As the film tells his story, it becomes more and more engaging.  The photos are wonderful.... You'll want to have the ""pause"" button handy.  Some of the best shots fly by.

He manages in a very non-threatening way to engage with and photograph everyday people in their ""everyday"" fashion (not so much!), while documenting the trends of the day through many decades.  He also snaps great photos of celebrities:  JFK Jr and his wife Caroline, Princess Diana (you'll hardly recognize her.... She looks so normal.).

Bill has a humility and childlike enthusiasm about getting paid to take pictures of fashion that is refreshing.  My only gripe is that this world is so clogged with snobbery and egotism, I'm not sure that clothes can even be considered an original art form anymore.  To be fair, Bill weeds out the impractical and the copycats and jumps to what middle class women can actually wear.

4415726,5,B004LWZW0G,"Bill Cunningham New York is a richly colorful study of a man who has been a cemented presence in the streets, sidewalks, and corridors of Manhattan's social and fashion world for nearly fifty years.

Watching and listening to Bill Cuningham recount life stories among, and with, a perfectly staged gallery of friends, fans, and favorite photographic subjects, many of whom are no less memorable in their own right, creates an unusual envy of his seemingly higher than imaginable sense of contentment with what his life and career has been almost from start to finish.

He's a remarkable, but very simple and pared down individual who has found a way, quite accidentally perhaps, to grow on everyone who has known him.

Director Richard Press stays connected to Cunningham through the film in ways that allow us to see a life retrospectively and in current space without barely noticing the passage of time. Almost as if we are watching an archival figure visiting from history just to entertain us for awhile.

In one of the later moments of the film, after Press asks two pointed and personal questions of Cunningham, we witness a man who finally loosens an emotional screw of his inner soul. What we then hear, and see on camera is a unique, and rare reckoning of a man realizing that he is comprised of both the utter simplicity of drive and enthusiasm to being connected to his work, and the complexity of guessing what else there might have been.

That moment, and all that precede it form an entertaining, and ultimately deeply touching portrait.",1383782400,,1552,4.841509433962264

Bill Cunningham has developed a life style that is as much an art as the fashion world (and its implications)  he is devoted to. In life and art, he has cut through the superficial to reach the fundamental. He is the Samuel Beckett of the fashion world. His weekly NYT feature is as engaging today as it was 30 or 40 years ago.

4415876,5,B004LWZW0G,"You don't have to know anything about Bill Cunningham or fashion industry to enjoy this documentary. ""Bill Cunningham New York"" is about someone who has been doing what he likes best for more than forty years with unstoppable energy and firm belief. The film is not just about fashion; it is also the passion for what we believe in.

The film chronicles the daily life and work of a New York Times photographer Bill Cunningham (born in 1929). Every day, rain or shine, he takes pictures of the passers-by in New York - to be precise, their street fashion like clothes, hats and shoes. Whether the wearer is a celebrity or not does not matter. He only takes photos of what he likes.

There is something strangely infectious about his personality. The way Bill talks about what he does, takes photos on the streets and rides his bicycle through Manhattan (and bumping into a taxi ... yes he does) in itself is as fascinating as the street fashion he captures with his camera. According to Bill, ""My dear, it's not work, it's pleasure.""

Most of the interviewees including Vogue editor Anna Wintour have interesting things to say, but even without them the film would have been a delightful and intriguing one with nice and happy Bill Cunningham. There are some amusing moments that look like scenes directly out of Woody Allen comedies (like Bill taking photos at his own event).

And apparently she did it on point, which was probably a bit uncomfortable for a hefty lass.  It's outrageous that whoever runs Carnegie Hall can't allow its current residents to leave of their own accord before turning the place into rental office space.  Surely Manhattan Island can provide enough offices without destroying a cultural treasure.  I hope people attending concerts in Carnegie Hall aren't seeing Xerox machines and file cabinets pushed off to the side of the stage to accommodate the performances.  And I'd like to suggest that the NY Times allow Bill to bring his bike inside so that maybe they don't have to buy him so many of them.",1367971200,,787,4.843283582089552

4416102,5,B004LWZW0G,"I don't imagine people really associate me with fashion. I aspire to look respectable and thanks to my three fashionable sisters and my mother I have some vague instincts about fashion which seem to serve me well enough, but I couldn't articulate why. At age 83, Bill Cunningham, a street fashion photographer based in New York, has had a sense of fashion all his life. After watching the truly delightful documentary film about him, Bill Cunningham New York, what I really aspire to do, more than be fashionable, is to love life as much as Bill Cunningham loves it.

Although he has a sense of fashion, you wouldn't know it by looking at him. Usually he's seen on the streets of New York with a plain blue jacket he buys two or three at a time for $5 a piece, a pair of plain khaki-colored pants, and comfortable black shoes, with a camera hanging from his neck and a cheap bike in tow (he's had dozens stolen through the years while about his business). Bill Cunningham is known for capturing cutting edge fashion as caught by his camera's eye (he still uses film and won't switch to digital) on the streets of New York. He authors two weekly fashion columns for the New York Times. He's a legend in the New York fashion scene, and therefore across the world. Rather than wearing it himself, though, he's known for finding and displaying the trends on the street, never regarding the station of the wearer, and often focusing on the clothes completely, cutting out everything but the most interesting piece he finds. He loves the eccentric and the new. Indeed, he never judges others and seems to find the most uniquely dressed people in the city. And he has fun. All the time.

But I wouldn't be telling you all of this because of the clothes. The reason I get interested in Bill's view on clothes is because of the love he exudes for his job and the sheer dedication and focus he has on this one thing. Taking pictures is all he does all day, every day. And he scoffs at the idea of doing anything else. Bill Cunningham New York is by far my favorite documentary, and its because the way the filmmaker, Richard Press, highlights the joy of someone completely dedicated to his work - including its rewards and its costs - that you want to keep watching. Bill Cunningham is the type of guy who might say his work is never finished. He feels the immediacy of his routine and by watching him you might wish you could try on his shoes as he attacks life with energy and fervor. In part, this is because of the benefits you see from his dedication.

Through obsessively flinging himself into his work, which he enjoys without end, Bill has been able to successfully avail himself of those carnal desires that so many of us find so difficult to recuse ourselves of, either through excess or desire: wealth, food, and sex. He doesn't care about money. Decades ago when he sold his magazine, Details, he was hounded by the purchaser for weeks afterwards to cash his check from the sale. He says when you take money then you lose freedom. He laughs, ""Money is what's cheap. Freedom's more expensive."" Although he spends most nights taking pictures at high society functions and charity balls in New York, he never partakes of the free gourmet food. Never married, when asked if he has ever had a romantic relationship he replies, ""It just would never occur to me to think of it."" He bypasses these things with seeming effortlessness. It does seem, however, that in avoiding those desires he may also have missed out on a few of life's most rewarding experiences. Later, when he opens up, you wonder if he is thinking the same thing.

Still, it is tempting to follow his format when you see all the things in life he avoids, crossing himself in everything else except for his work. He is a lean, mean, fashion-finding machine. But don't think his love for fashion is about fame or stature or acclaim. He's had opportunity for all those things and waved them aside without a second thought, just so he could get one more good shot. He's on speaking terms with the editor-in-chief of Vogue and international ambassadors, but seems to regard them the same as anyone else. We get an outside perspective on Bill from a cast of Bill's admirers, from industry experts to subjects of his photography; from neighbors to colleagues. You might say, if this were a different type of film, that it seems a bit one-sided, but the closest to negative feelings towards Bill I think anyone could have might be indifference.

One high point in the movie comes when, after much persuasion by friends and colleagues, he reluctantly accepts a lifetime achievement award in France. You get the feeling this a prestigious occasion. But he's in his same-old blue jacket accepting a medal from a worldwide leader in fashion during Fashion Week in Paris. True to form, in his acceptance speech he spouts pure gratitude and humility. He says its not about the celebrity or the spectacle. It's about the clothes. He says, ""It's as true today as it ever was..."" And then in one of only two parts in the film where he really opens up emotionally his voice cracks as he says, ""He who seeks beauty will find it."" And in that moment you know he means it and truly seeks after it as much as you do for whatever it is that you find most true in life. And you really love him for it.

The other time is when he's asked about religion. A Catholic by upbringing, he still attends church every Sunday. He briefly mentions his family, saying they were simple and that although they didn't really understand his penchant for hats, they were good people. He still holds to what they taught him. His attendance at weekly mass is perhaps his only break from work in life besides sleeping. After getting choked up and hesitating for half a minute he says, ""I think its a good thing."" His responses to this question and others about his military service (he thinks its a duty and was proud to do it), love (he wouldn't have thought of it), and money (no need for it), all point to a practical man with traditional values that has a set of principles but would shy away from ever imposing those on others. He does what works for him. And after watching, you're a bit more dedicated in finding what works for yourself.

Bill Cunningham became a part of the city.  His society column and ""Out on the Street"" captured both the doings of all the philanthropy and the street scenes of the city.

His ""Out on the Street"" column is as good a fashion history of anything produced in the last 50 years.

Fascinating man.  Completely absorbed in his work and a deserved legend.  A complete iconoclast.

Fascinating ethics too, especially in the bizarre worlds of celebrity and photography.  Even when he shoots 2-3 society events a night he won't take any food or water from the hosts.

Well worth seeing.

For a person who was so often in the public, remarkably guarded.

4416312,3,B004LWZW0G,"This is a complicated film to rate. I give the filmmakers 4.7 stars for production, 1.3 stars for the intended message, and 5 stars for the unintended message they left me with.

Re: production, the director/production team unearthed some wonderful old footage and tied it in with the new footage elegantly and even powerfully. They picked interviewees who were colorful, both literally and figuratively. They tied strings of narrative through the documentary in order to make it less like a dry profile. And most impressively, they knew what to leave out: they didn't show Bill Cunningham living in his new apartment, and they didn't show Bill Cunningham at church. Those would have been obvious things to do, but they didn't do it, and I applaud them for that.

But in terms of thoughtfulness, in terms of helping us understand why any of this matters, the filmmakers left something to be desired. If the film had ended after the first 60 minutes, I would have given it exactly 1 star. That's because in the first 60 minutes, interspersed between interviews with ultra-status-conscious people who were out to convince the world (and themselves) that they were unique little flowers, the filmmakers were giving us little nuggets of junior varsity wisdom. They were appealing to our inner-adolescent with lessons like ""follow your passion"" and ""express yourself"" and ""be nice to each other.""

The final 24 minutes, though, were very interesting, much less adolescent-y, and, at times, moving. We start to get glimpses of how this is more than an obsession for Bill, how it is all-absorbing to the exclusion of all else (including romantic relationships), and we start to get glimpses (albeit somewhat unconvincing ones) of why it matters to him:

* ""The wider world that perceives fashion as a frivolity that should be done away with in the face of social upheavals and problems that are enormous-- the point is, in fact, that fashion is the armor to survive the reality of everyday life.""
* ""I don't think you could do away with fashion. It would be like doing away with civilization.""
* ""I just like fashion as an art form of dressing the body. If we all went out looking like a slob like me, it would be a pretty dreary world.""
* ""I'm not interested in celebrities. The cut, the lines, the colors... that's everything.""
* ""It's not work. I'm just having fun.""

There is something about the philosophical nature of these quotes or the way he expressed them that made them not 100% convincing. They seemed more like rationalizations than reasons. But then, in a speech he gives at a ceremony in Paris, we finally get the real reason, and we know it is the real reason because he can't contain his emotions.

""It's as true today as it ever was--he who seeks beauty will find it.""

It's a touching moment and one that defines the film. Or ought to have defined the film. Every decision about what to include or exclude in this film ought to have been based on that single line.

And that's where the filmmakers fall short. For them, the climax of the film is a different moment, the one where they try to penetrate his private life, asking about his sexuality and his religion. They are just trying to deliver the juice, the gossipy details that we all desire to know. But they do not ask the much more important questions:

* If it's beauty he's seeking, why doesn't he find it elsewhere, in music or food or any aesthetic other than clothing? In particular, why doesn't he find it in people (rather than just on their clothes or their bodies)?
* Why is he so unreflective w/r/t his one-dimensionality? When asked if he has any regrets about not having romantic relationships, his response was along the lines of ""no, I never had the time to consider it."" Really, Bill? Never while you were out riding your bike? Never while you were in a dark room processing your film did you wonder whether there wasn't more to life than what you were doing?

The filmmakers paint Bill Cunningham as a wise, loveable, almost martyr-like figure, someone who devoted his life to his passion. An American hero. Bill Cunningham is more complicated than that. He's a man who has been greatly influenced by Catholicism - you can see it in his morality, his relentless work, his asceticism, and his concern for aesthetics - but his asceticism has seeped into his aesthetics so that he seeks beauty in only one form. The filmmakers are right about the admirable and honorable parts of Bill Cunningham, but they miss (or don't pay enough attention to) the other parts.

And, even if you don't think or care much about NYC, you'll be fascinated by this insider's look at this one-of-a-kind, impassably dedicated, deceptively complex man.  How this film from Richard Press didn't get an Academy Award nomination  is beyond me.  [Oh, right: Harvey Weinstein didn't back it.]

For dedicated readers of the New York Times, there's the thrill of finding out what goes into compiling and editing Cunningham's iconic ""On the Street"" pictorial montage each week.  A few viewers might find that look into the editing process tedious.  But I suspect most will find it fascinating.  We see Mr. Cunningham pick a theme and then work through the week at assembling his vision with John Kurdewan, a production artist and layout editor for the Times.  I loved the film's focus on the work and relationship between these two: Kurdewan's technical chops (and extraordinary patience, good humor...and a bit of mock exasperation!) together with Mr. Cunningham's artistic vision (and trademark doggedness - into his 80s now, he still obsesses over the finest detail).

If there's a single word to sum up Mr. Cunningham, it is ""unimpeachable.""  We see this characteristic most clearly demonstrated in his approach to his other signature column: Evening Hours.  He is pounded with hordes of invitations.  He flips through a stack on his desk.  Yet, he only picks the events that he deems worthy.  Throughout his entire career, he's never taken a single cent (other than his Times salary) to cover these events.  It's plainer than that: he's never taken so much as a sip of water at these events.  This isn't a casual decision.  Mr. Cunningham makes it clear that in taking this line, he maintains his freedom.  At his most serious, he intones, ""Never take the money."" Riveting stuff.

My favorite scene among many: Cunningham in Paris attempting to get into an important show.  Were you not to know the man, you'd probably have the reaction that the gatekeeper does: Cunningham continually flashes his pass, continually gets overlooked.  He never pulls rank.  He never pulls the ""Do you know who I am?"" card.  Throughout, Press keeps his camera trained at a distance.  Cunningham is either unaware or doesn't care.  Finally, another person affiliated with the show intervenes, pushes the clueless security personnel away with these words: ""Please, he's the most important man in the world.""

That Cunningham is indeed that man (in this world) and remains his singular, ascetic self makes this the most fascinating of tales.  I'm so glad that Richard Press captured the story before Cunningham's unique career comes to a close.",1331596800,2,3224,5.616977225672878

Nominated for a Spirit Award for Best Documentary, 'Bill Cunningham New York' is an entertaining and enjoyable film about a fascinating eccentric who no doubt belongs in the pantheon of all-time great NYC characters. 'Bill' initially worked as a fashion columnist but has now been at the NY Times for many years primarily as both a roving photographer and fashion maven/columnist.

'Bill' is now in his early eighties, and has been seen bicycling around the city for years. Director Richard Press found some footage at the NY Times, from over twenty years ago, which featured Cunningham talking about his work, and he hasn't changed a bit. Bill lived for years in a very small apartment above Carnegie Hall where he kept all his negatives and photos. There are some interviews with some of his neighbors and friends, extraordinary in their own right.

  What's great about Bill is that he is full of energy and loves his work. His main thing is photographing people (mainly women) who are dressed in a way that impresses him. Bill only photographs those who he's drawn to--he appears to be an excellent critic when it comes to fashion. Even though he often covers big society events for the NY Times, he's never drawn to the cult of celebrity.

  Despite his great talents, Bill is completely modest in his personal life. He hardly has any clothes and seems to delight in wearing the same windbreaker wherever he goes. He has no interest in food per se and basically indicates that he's asexual. Bill becomes emotional only when he discusses his devotion to his Roman Catholic faith (attending church every Sunday appears to provide him with an 'anchor' as otherwise, he is constantly 'on the run').

  There is no doubt that Bill Cunningham is a beloved character. This is evidenced by the birthday party thrown for him by NY Times staff as well an award given to him in Paris as a man of letters. You'll also get a peek at how his columns at the Times are put together, with the able assistance of a production assistant.

4416469,5,B004LWZW0G,"I just saw ""Bill Cunningham New York"", a documentary movie about a person previously unknown to me, and what an exuberant work it is! The brilliance is in the editing, so that we gradually move from an outside perspective to a sense of what might be driving this extraordinary individual. A written description might give the impression that he is perhaps slightly autistic but, watching him interact, you realise he is a highly focused and driven person, with a good nature, joyful disposition and wonderful sense of ethics that is doubly wonderful because it is never imposed on others.
For me the two key take-outs were firstly, a celebration of New York and Paris, the two great cities that most embrace liberty. Thinking of my own hometown Melbourne Australia and its tut-tut brigade and rigorous policing, Bill could never pull this off here. I mean, you can't even ride a bicycle without a helmet. He'd have been arrested thousands of times for photographing, jay-walking or weaving in and out of traffic. And the people he films - those individuals who define ""the edge"" in all its glorious variety - again the movie enables us to develop a vivid sense of New York's vibrant imagination. Liberty - such a celebration!
The second point is perhaps more striking. This movie is much like the wonderful ""Into The Wild"" from a few years ago in that both chart a the true story of a man who completely forsakes the materialistic life and in the process achieves near-total freedom. The remarkable thing about Bill is that he manages to pull it off while living in the midst of a highly individualistic, hedonistic, materialistic environment. He is vigorously engaged with it but seemingly unaffected; he never seems to criticise, his photographs are invariably kind. And he takes ""conflict of interest"" to a whole new level; the movie undoubtedly will challenge the comfortable assumptions we all make. While ""Into The Wild"" charts a young man's journey into an unmaterialistic life, in ""Bill Cunningham New York"" he reached there many decades ago and we are left to wonder about his journey. What we do see is the daily existence of a highly productive, unmaterialistic and essentially free person, we see that it is real and possible.",1322956800,5,2238,4.907651715039578

I knew nothing of BC before seeing this, and am now certainly a fan. I care little for fashion but I know a wonderful person when I see one, and it's a treat to hang out with Bill for these 85 minutes.

I had just watched the Joan Rivers doc before this, and what an incredible contrast in New Yorkers. Her total self-absorption and selfishness is the polar opposite to Bill's amazingly pure spirit. This guy could be loaded from selling his stuff, but instead lives an almost ascetic life in an apartment 95% full of his work, and fine work it is. He denigrates his photography technically, but he captures feelings as well as he does clothes, and his shots have real life and spark. The man is an artist.

And what a human being! I was most of all impressed by his riding a simple cruiser bike around Manhattan almost 24/7. They make it seem basic here, but man, that's no mean feat. Plus he eschews all the perqs of his lifestyle, the food and booze and all else that's right at his fingertips. The guy just loves to shoot quirky, strong, elegant clothes and people, and few do it better.

This is an absolutely delightful film, not only becasue we get to share Bill's daily delight in leading the life he's chosen, but for the reminder that the best and happiest lives certainly don't need to be ""normal"". Bill has no family (except everyone in New York, it seems) and has never had a lover, he reveals; his breakdown talking about religion is interesting, as he clearly he gets what he needs from his spiritual life, and more power to him. His joy speaks for itself.

All in all, a real treat and one of the most pleasant films I've seen in a long while. If only we all loved our lives like Bill Cunningham...what a wonderful world it would be!",1322870400,3,1760,4.386503067484663

4416472,5,B004LWZW0G,"Deeply touching and inspiring, Bill Cunningham shows us what it means to have a dream and live it up. Against all odds in the world of fashion, his genuine, graceful and humble characteristics truly stand out. The movie leaves you with a dream-like state where anything is possible, would highly recommend it.",1318896000,,309,4.961538461538462
4416473,5,B004LWZW0G,"I came across this doc film clicking around on Netflix streaming late one night. At first it seemed puzzling why anyone would make a documentary about an old guy who works for the New York Times riding a bicycle around and photographing street fashions. But I quickly got drawn into the film and understood how the filmakers had chosen this unusual man.

Bill Cunningham, now in his 80's, has worked for many years as a street photographer, riding precariously around Manhatten on his bicycle and snapping (film) photos of what people are wearing. In an age when there is so much corruption in all walks of life, what comes out in the film is Cunningham's unique sense of personal integrity. In a city obsessed with status, he seems to care nothing for status or celebrity or personalities; he is only interested in the clothes, the ideas. When he attends society and fashion functions in the evening, which he does almost every evening, he declines to accept food or drink; it would compromise his ethics. Indeed here is a man who has no apparent vices and minimal personal life. He lives frugally. He strives to be honest. He strives to do no harm. He cares little for his comfort. He has simply made a life of observing how people in New York express themselves through fashion; it is enough for him. ""I have tried to play a straight game"" he says about his life.

One might not be surprised to hear that a medieval monk or pure mathematician or a scholar of ancient languages had such an ascetic and, one may say, spiritually refined existence, but in the New York fashion world! And so he is a beloved fixture in New York. An inspiring documentary, which affirms how one can live in the everyday world and yet hold to an ""impeccable path.""",1318636800,35,1744,4.604501607717042

8435186,5,B004LWZW0G,"I found this a stunning, deeply thought-provoking, and inspiring documentary. One of the best I have ever seen in my life, and I watch a lot of documentaries. That is because the subject matter of the film, Bill Cunningham, was such a supreme person and artist, that watching him is seeing a piece of art walking around--or biking around and taking photographs, as the case might be. I hesitated before watching this, thinking it might be stuffy and pretentious fashion stuff, or that it would be boring ""artsy fartsy"" stuff. I could not have been more wrong. This is a powerful and beautiful documentary that will be ESPECIALLY meaningful to you if you have the following interests: 1) extraordinary people 2) fashion 3) New York 4) art and, 5) a life well-lived.

Bravo to the creators of this masterpiece. And Bravo to St. Bill Cunningham!",1507420800,2,842,4.8068965517241375
