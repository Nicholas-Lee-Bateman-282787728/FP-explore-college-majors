This is Japanese soft pron with simulated sex act and plenty of nudity including MF sex, FF sex, forced grope and rape. And don't worry , if you miss the rape scene, our warrior has a nightmare about it.

8247398,5,B0012RD3YU,"I bought this DVD at amazon.com on 3/31/11. I own 154 Chinese movies and 98 Japanese movies, and several from Japan are about ""Kunoichi"" = Ninja Girls. At the beginning of several Kunoichi movies, there are theories about the derivation of ""Kunoichi"", one involving the number of holes in bodies of men and women. I also ordered an ""Asian Beauty"" pinup DVD of Matsushima Kaede (In Japan and China, surnames come before given names, so she is Miss Matsushima), and I follow her on Twitter. Matsu-Shima means Pine-Island in Japanese. She writes her given name in Hiragana phonetics, so I can only guess at its meaning. My favorite Kunoichi is Komatsu Miyuki (Small-Pine Beautiful-Blessing) in ""Kunoichi Ninpo Cho San: ..."", second is Koda Risa in ""Twin Blades of the Ninja"", third is Kiuchi Miho in ""Kunoichi: Deadly Mirage"" and fourth is Matsushima Kaede in this film. I also own some ""Lady Ninja Kasumi"" films. Competition is tough among these sexy Kunoichi. Ninjaken means Ninja Sword. (Kendo is Way of the Sword using bamboo swords or shinai. Kenjutsu is Art of the sword using steel katana.) This movie has more nudity than ninja action, but that's fine with me when such sexy girls as Kaede (or Miho, Risa and Miyuki) are in nude scenes. I just consider such movies as more for my pinup collection. I own 20 outright Japanese pinup girl films. I could count this one as #21, I suppose.",1366243200,2,1389,4.767634854771784

8247400,3,B0012RD3YU,"In the tradition of ""Kasumi: Lady Ninja"" and the ""Ninja Vixens"" franchise, comes a ""pink"" film by director Yoshikazu Kato, called ""NINJAKEN: the NAKED SWORD"". If you expect a film with a lot of action packed sequences then you will be disappointed. ""Ninjaken..."" is an exploitive, highly erotic tale of female ninjas who use the best weapon they have at their disposal--their womanly wiles and their curvaceous bodies. This film stars AV-star, super sexy Kaede Matsushima--so do I have your attention, my fellow men?

In a time of warring states, the female ninja Murasame (Kaede Matsushima) is assigned to assassinate the rogue clan lord Daizen Osakabe who has aligned himself with the Tokugawa to betray the Taiko. Despite the odds, Murasame nearly succeeds but in the end, is almost captured and badly wounded. She flees the Daimyo's resident ninja, Akatokage, and collapses, regaining her consciousness within the walls of a mysterious convent for women. However, this ""Aitokuin"" convent is headed by a woman-loving abbess named Jokyo is not all that it seemsto be, the convent is only a front for a woman-trafficking brothel. A sinister plot threatens to take control of Murasame's future. Now, Murasame must use all her skills, both as a female warrior and a woman to escape a deadly web of sexual slavery and deception.

When watching a low-budget exploitive flick, one has keep the expectations low. I was expecting an erotic film full of campy action and gore; and this film isn't action-packed at all, but relies heavily on the erotic elements to stay aloft. The plot is almost none-existent as the script revolves upon just how many sequences of graphic sex it could fit in 75 minutes. The fight sequences are laughable and the story is too hollow. Honestly, the only way to appreciate this film is by comparing it to other Japanese erotic films of this kind--just how does it measure up?

Well, if you're curious just how many exploitive scenes there are on this film, then the movie stacks up well and exceeds ""Ninja Vixens"". The sex scenes are very erotically charged and there are quite a good number of them. The scenes are also long and arousing--Kaede Matsushima is an AV idol and a nude model, so it is always fun to see her in an exploitive film. The supporting cast is mostly made up of beautiful Japanese women; Hiromi Suzuki, Kyoko Kazama and Mari Yamaguchi and none of them are shy to shed their clothes.  There is no full frontal nudity but the only thing covering up Kaede Matsushima's (and the other women) sensitive female parts is a man's hand while he treats himself. Oh, there is no ""blurring"" in the crotch areas, so you get to see all the ""action"".

The film also has its share of silly ""punch lines"" but delivers them with a straight face. I cannot divulge any of them but let's just say that it expresses something about a weapon, pleasure, and a hole to hide a small dagger. There are a lot of girl-on-girl action and sexual torture that is a little disturbing but at the same time, exciting. Kaede Matsushima's ""training"" sequences may be the film's biggest draw. The scenes are very graphic and trumps on most softcore films. So why did I spend 75 minutes to watch this? I was curious as to how Matsushima can handle herself in a non-AV affair.. (right!)

Japanese feudal tales have often told of female assassins who use their sexuality as a weapon, they are dispatched to murder feudal lords; this film is just part of that premise. ""Naked Sword"" is low-budget affair, with a plot which is almost none-existent--and I still await a great film that would explore the world of a female assassin than one that focuses on eroticism and exploitive elements. Female ninjas played a huge part of the feudal wars, and deserves a better movie than one that borders on porn. I guess it may take longer for us to see a sexy, suspenseful female ninja film; this film doesn't deliver any action or thrills at all--but as an erotic, exploitive ""pink"" flick this film will not disappoint. If you want some pervy kicks, then this film may be for you, plus, it does have Kaede Matsushima.
