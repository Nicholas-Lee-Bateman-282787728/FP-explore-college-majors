Great stuff!",1202083200,4,258,4.733333333333333
1959060,4,B0000YEERQ,"Tommy Lee Jones plays Steve Daley, a CIA officer tasked in the early 1960s with handling Yuri Nosenko, a supposed KGB defector with important information on Lee Harvey Oswald.  ""Steve Daley"" is a pseudonym for ""Pete"" Bagley who recently wrote the book ""Spy Wars"" about the controversial Nosenko case.  The movie gives an accurate picture of a very complex affair that was never completely resolved to everyone's satisfaction.  This movie is the antithesis of a James Bond film of gun battles and car chases; instead, the battles are those of brains and will.  The movie seems to largely reflect the opinions of Bagley/Daley, who ultimately concluded that Nosenko was a false defector intended to mislead the CIA about possible Soviet penetration.",1178236800,10,746,5.140495867768595
1959061,5,B0000YEERQ,"Based largely on declassified transcripts, this is a very well-done reconstruction of the events surrounding a major scandal that ripped apart the CIA in the 1960s and 1970s. James Angleton was then chief of counter-intelligence, and after his close friend Kim Philby defected to the Soviet Union, Angleton grew increasingly obsessed with finding other Soviet moles in the highest ranks of U.S. intelligence. One defector (Golitsyn) played into the fears of the hawks by emphasizing the seriousness of the Soviet threat; another defector (Nosenko) insisted there was no serious threat. Following closely on the heals of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Kennedy assassination, the choice on whom to believe carried serious implications for U.S. security. In an unsuccessful effort to break Nosenko, Angleton and his staff put Nosenko into solitary confinement for almost three years--and though major inconsistencies were uncovered in Nosenko's story, he was never broken. In the course of the investigation, Angleton's drive to uncover the Soviet mole(s) in the CIA ruined the careers of more than forty people; the scandal that followed led to Angleton's dismissal, and the CIA's inclination to wash its hands of HUMINT (human intelligence sources) in favor of SIGINT (technology-driven intelligence). This opened the way for later Soviet infiltrations (Walker, Ames, Hansen), but also set an unfortunate precedent--the CIA's distrust of HUMINT--that seriously undermined U.S. security in the post-Cold War era.

8004534,4,B0000YEERQ,"Yuri Nosenko: Double Agent, 2003 film

This film is a dramatization based on transcripts of Public Hearings, Interviews and Published Sources. The opinions of the film makers fill in the gaps. Names have been changed. It begins with a scene from 11-22-1963 in Dallas. Then it changes to Geneva in 1962, where there is a diplomatic meeting. Yuri makes offers to make a deal. Steve reports to Langley. Yuri tells how they put a trace material on a suspects shoes then used a hound to follow his steps! This is an important source, if authentic. They learn of a KGB source in the CIA, and the use of false defectors. But George will be cultivated. Friday 11-22-1963 creates problems. Was there no research on Oswald, a Marine who defected then returned. Why wasn't he watched? [Still a good question, unless he was trusted.] George wants a meeting. Yuri translates to George.

There is a meeting at a movie theater. Yuri wants to defect. He has information on Oswald! Note the disguise. The FBI is delighted with Yuri, hes reliable. The FBI has their source in the KGB at the UN in New York. Yuri talks on his vacation in Hawaii. But not about certain details. Later Steve asks for details from an expert visitor. [Note his use of aftershave lotion.] Yuri is taken for a ride to a special prison. A polygraph tests his truthfulness. A shocking surprise! They will put Yuri on a strict regime - no reading material. You don't remember? They check his statements. How do you know? It was a lie, he exaggerated. There are conflicts with Hoover. Golitsyn doubts his authenticity. Nosenko remains in prison. He cant hold out forever. In September 1964 Chief Justice Warren says there was no conspiracy. Can they wear Yuri down?

Why did Yuri rise so fast? I lied about my rank. He is a Captain, not a Lt. Colonel. They have an idea who Yuri really is - a contract agent. There are two views about the KGB - very efficient, or incompetent. [Could both be true about any government agency, or a business?] Nothing to worry about? The questioning goes on using sleep deprivation. Im not Nosenko. What were your orders? Golitsyn finally sees Yuris picture and tells what he knows. Is this true? The years in captivity and stress affect Yuri. The psychology guys think Yuri was brainwashed. [Is that a medical diagnosis?] They have to dispose of this case so it does not ruin anybodys career! There is rioting in Detroit [the beginning of its decline]. Its very hot, no air, not windows. What can they do with Yuri now? A high-level CIA officer is now under suspicion.

They plan a new method of questioning. You lied to me says Steve Daley. Back home Steve looks over his old mementos. Nosenko was released in October 1967. Six years later in Daley is Rome. A new manager retired Angleton, Nosenko got his papers. Nosenko lectures at Camp Peary. Daley still thinks Nosenko is a phony. The House Select Committee investigates the JFK Assassination; they interview Nosenko. I don't remember. He tells about his bad conditions in prison. Mr. Collins talks about sick think and uses an old handwritten memo. Theyre out to get me. Daley testifies before the HSCIA. Later the FBI (under new management) decides that Fedora was a KGB agent all along. Nosenko got his citizenship and a job with the CIA. Daley made a new life in Europe.

One obvious mistake for Daley was to not make a schedule for questioning Yuri. It just went on and on, like an out-of-control project that wastes time and money but accomplishes nothing. Who oversaw his project? Who controls their budget? This 1986 BBC documentary is educational but not as entertaining as a James Bond action film. This is not meant as a demerit.",1410652800,,3682,4.684698608964451
8004535,5,B0000YEERQ,"This is definitely a must see.  Tommy Lee Jones is the best actor ever in my mind, so I am bias, but I loved it still.",1373760000,2,118,3.5384615384615383
8004536,3,B0000YEERQ,"This film is the story of the defection of Yuri Nosenko to the CIA at the height of the Cold War.  Tommy Lee Jones plays the real-life role of Nosenko's CIA case officer.  Essentially, when Nosenko defected there was a question as to whether Nosenko was a genuine KGB defector, or whether he was deliberately sent by the KGB to confuse the CIA within the ""wilderness of mirrors.""  Was he a genuine defector?  Was he sent over to discredit earlier Soviet defectors?  Was he sent over to help establish the bona fides of other defectors and sources, such as the FBI's prized ""Fedora"" source?  Each point of view had its champions within CIA.  Ultimately, James Jesus Angleton, the head of CIA internal security, determined that Nosenko was not genuine. Other CIA factions vehemently believed otherwise, leading to great dissension within the CIA ranks. Nosenko was kept in solitary confinement for several years, and hard-interrogated repeatedly.  He never broke.  Ultimately the CIA accepted his defection as genuine.  Angleton did not, and this contributed to his eventual forced-retirement from the CIA.

This film is a fascinating story of CIA internal conflict and politics.  It gives insight into the difficulty that the CIA faced as it went up against the ruthless and sometimes competent KGB.  The viewer can decide for him or her self what to think about Nosenko.

The DVD is not of terribly high quality.  The transfer contains some noise and imperfections, but it is not too bad.

Well worth watching for the espionage aficionado.  Recommended.  RJB.",1290902400,2,1559,5.0234375
8004537,2,B0000YEERQ,Great Film however in the end it seems to support Angleton's  view if this case. Tommy Lee Jones is always good of coarse.,1265328000,,122,4.304347826086956
8004538,5,B0000YEERQ,"Largely reflecting the pro-Angelton view of Edward Jay Epstein (""Legend""), who was a consultant on the film, it is as accurate as one can hope to get on the Nosenko mystery.  The recent film Good Shepard, which includes some of the same characters in composite, is laughable by comparison as history.",1234224000,2,300,4.882352941176471
