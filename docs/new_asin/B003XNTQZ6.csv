8408461,3,B003XNTQZ6,"This video is ok for someone who is trying to get their children interested in yoga. I personally felt like there were too many breaks in activity, but I think for a younger child this would be a good thing. My 9 year old enjoyed it, but got bored after the first time.",1375833600,,269,4.09433962264151
8408462,5,B003XNTQZ6,"Great video for kids, the animals, animal facts, the beautiful ocean, very relaxing and fun!  My kids love doing this video and I hear giggling and laughing the whole time!  Excellent product.",1356912000,,192,4.96875
8408463,5,B003XNTQZ6,"I am a mother to two kids who are 8 and 4. Both of them enjoyed watching and doing the yoga poses in this video. My 8 year old son has Autism and doesn't like exercise at all but got involved and even giggled while doing the ""Lions Pose""...Always music to an Aspie's moms ears! This DVD had very loving energy and great direction for beginners. BIG thank you to Sarah Starr!",1319414400,,374,4.208333333333333
8408464,2,B003XNTQZ6,"I am a kids' yoga instructor and unfortunately I bought 2 of theses DVDs, one for a gift and another for my own family. Susan talks the whole time giving adult type of instructions about the poses. My 7 year old commented: how can she take a breath if she is talking the whole time?! My daughter could not sit through it.
I found it very stressful to watch the video with so much talk. Kids do yoga mostly by imitation. Little instruction is needed. Or, at least, there should be an option to play the video with much less instruction and with relaxing music and sounds.
The images and exercises are good, but the only way I can see this video being pleasant is with  no sound and with some nice music in the background.....
I am sorry to be so blunt about this DVD. Sarah Starr could consider redoing the sound/instruction part using the same images. Another negative aspect is the fact that there are no chapters, and no easy way to avoid the wordy introduction. The visuals are good, but much more relaxed instruction is needed.",1317945600,,1031,4.455026455026455
