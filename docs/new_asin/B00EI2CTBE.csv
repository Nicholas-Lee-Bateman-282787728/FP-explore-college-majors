8605412,3,B00EI2CTBE,This is Kenny Rogers as The Gambler.  Based on the hit song.  Although the story of the movie is nothing like the song.  Kenny Rogers has a laid back acting style.  The movie is good.  Except for one part where the lady is shooting at the cowboys who are trying to keep The Gambler and hi friend form boarding the train.  Yeah right.,1490918400,,333,4.2063492063492065
