8206067,5,B000SNB5LM,"I've used this series, and this volume in particular, to teach children basic art skills. All of the DVD's in this series are fabulous, and this is one of my favorites. Children seldom learn how to use felt pens effectively, and this DVD teaches them the basic techniques. I've observed that children retain the knowledge of these techniques, and use it for all of their future artwork.",1493683200,,386,4.776119402985074
