8284936,5,B001BUK9EK,Good discussions. I own about 20 of the Roman DVD's now and found them all to be good ...most were excellent. This one is very helpful with Pirc and Modern..just wish he had put more emphasis on Black getting an advantage as I play these often but Forewarned is Forearmed. Cost is way out of line you can buy these for $16.95 AND not pay $9.50 shipping elsewhere.,1270771200,,363,4.352941176470588
8284937,4,B001BUK9EK,This DVD contains Roman's recommended way of playing white against the pirc and modern defenses.  Yes Roman has an accent and will make mistakes and say white when he means black and such but the lines he recommends are very good.  I am an USCF rated expert and have used many of his recommended lines successfully. The price is high.  I found mine for 19.95$,1235174400,2,359,4.492307692307692
8284938,1,B001BUK9EK,"As will ALL of the Roman's lab series I have seen, the production quality is VERY poor. It looks like GM Roman Dzindzichashvili sits down at home, in front of a chessboard, with a very low specification camera. Often he says the moves too quickly, and you don't have any written record of them. He also has a strong Russian accept, which some might find difficult to understand. This DVD makes most of the videos on U-tube look very professional indeed.

The ChessBase Fritz Trainer series, such as the DVD on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pirc-Defense/dp/B000RE7PXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pirc Defense</a>&nbsp;by Nigel Davies are of much higher quality. With the Fritz Trainer products, they normally run inside a chess application (ChessBase reader) which is optimised for viewing this sort of material. An obvious advantage is that there written annotations, and the moves and variations are in front of you. You can also flip the board to have black at the bottom. In contrast, the Roman's lab series are very amateurish.

There is also a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chessbase-Opening-Trainer-on-the-Pirc-Defense/dp/3935602383/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chessbase Opening Trainer on the Pirc Defense</a>. I've not personally seen that, but have seen a few of the Opening Trainer series from ChessBase. For me personally, they are nowhere near as good as the Fritz Frainer products, as I'd rather have someone explain the ideas on a video, than read them on the screen. The Opening Trainer seem a bit overpriced to me, considering the production costs must be minimal (no need for the author to travel to a recording studio, it can all be done at home).

This DVD is more like the Fritz Trainer series than the Open Trainer, but the production quality is so off-putting.

The material looks OK, but I'd much rather use a DVD where I can see the moves, can flip the board, can understand the speaker properly and not sit there infuriated by how amateurish the product is.

Hence I would forget this, and get the Fritz Trainer DVD on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-Pirc-Defense-by-Nigel-Davies/dp/B000RE7PXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the Pirc Defense by Nigel Davies</a>",1233360000,2,2329,5.878698224852071
