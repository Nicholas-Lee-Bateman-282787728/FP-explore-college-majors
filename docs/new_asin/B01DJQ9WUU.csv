7713188,5,B01DJQ9WUU,"I just purchased and streamed this film via Amazon Prime.  Since 1988, I had diverse symptoms and was finally diagnosed with MS in 1999.  I changed my neurologist in 2006.  He immediately ordered B12 and Vitamin D tests.  I was deficient in both and began a vitamin protocol.  What is really critical to the MS Society is this:  Years ago, a female Dr with MS did research on folic and MS which has really caught on.  However, without B12.....I have severe demyelination, loss of motor and sensory, etc.  A lot of damage has been done.  While MS is the cause, the new neurologist  showed me a report which listed all the problems a lack of B12 could cause.  I have progressive MS and symptoms no longer remit and relapse.  I was told that MS meds can only delay progress and will not improve symptoms.  However, the new Dr. felt differently.  Since I began the  vitamin protocol, my swallowing problems, skin crawling, nerve pain and fatigue have improved.  Brain atrophy has stabilized.  Numbness is still present, but improved. MS drugs were not achieving these results.  We have no choice but to take 1 toxic drug to slow the MS.  However, drugs to improve symptoms must be taken at very high doses, are additionally toxic often without results.  This movie is well done, critically important and I will share it with my MS community.  I now take 1 drug (Tysabri) and no other meds.  Just vitamins.  And I have symptom improvement.  There are probably some people who live unhealthy lifestyles and think B12 shots are a great fad.  This has done a real disservice to it's importance.  This film does an outstanding job conveying it's importance and who may benefit.",1459728000,9,1668,4.704861111111111

I can relate well to this film as I have a B12 deficiency and am still trying to find a knowledgeable doctor who will prescribe methyl cobalamin shots for me to take as needed. The book is fantastic and will travel with me to as many doctor appointments as it takes to get the solution I know I need. (Those red shots!) There is a documentary on the site: www.b12awareness which is extremely informative. Small sections from that documentary are shown at the end of this movie. I wish I could bring Mrs. Pacholok herself with me to my upcoming appointment with a specialist!",1459468800,7,676,4.641666666666667
8756056,5,B01DJQ9WUU,Very informative bio on a campaigning US nurse who is raising awareness of B12 deficiency.  As someone who has recently been diagnosed after several years of increasing ill health it amazes me that this condition is so under diagnosed by doctors worldwide.  I was unable to buy this DVD on the UK Amazon site so had to order from USA.  It's a must see story for everyone!,1489968000,,371,4.507462686567164
8756057,5,B01DJQ9WUU,"I thought this movie had an excellent message that the medical establishment would prefer to ignore. Filmed with a low budget, it will likely do much good for those who have serious health issues.",1477612800,2,196,4.794117647058823
8756058,4,B01DJQ9WUU,"I think the movie has a good message and it really hits home as to what B12 deficiency can cause.  The only thing that surprised me is that even though Sally is passionate about getting the message out, it does come across (at times) as a tad bit obsessive and honestly, I'm one of her biggest fans!  There are many good parts, but it was mixed--I especially liked the presentation in front of the seniors but didn't care for the scene that showed different patients (one after another) with their main symptom in large letters and writing a check mark next to it. That part seemed like it was overdone to me, but no doubt it was put in there to underscore the significance of all the symptoms.  I think the actors who played Sally and her Dad were good actors and a good choice for the film.  The main thing...if you see this, you will definitely have a deeper understanding of many of the symptoms that are involved with Vitamin B12 deficiency and even more, understand that there is hope if you catch it early.  I'm one of the lucky ones who did.",1477526400,3,1049,4.38659793814433
8756059,5,B01DJQ9WUU,"This really helped my husband get a more concrete understanding of how/why he is feeling the way he is.

It is definitely an eye opener.",1474243200,2,136,4.44
8756060,5,B01DJQ9WUU,Wonderful movie.  Brought to light that a lack of B12 will not only effect energy levels but will greatly effect appetite and cause digestive issues.  My daughter and I both take Superior Source No Shot B12 1000 mg. every day even before we saw this brand in the movie and this cured our digestive problems and waning appetite.  B 12 has helped both or our digestive issues tremendously.  Thank you for this movie on Amazon and thank you for carrying Superior Source B 12.,1469923200,2,472,4.583333333333333
8756061,4,B01DJQ9WUU,"Love the concept and the message, but it is a bit like a 'b' movie what with rather stilted acting and a very cheesy court setting at the end. Also a disappointing ending scene. But overall, it is well worth a watch to flag up the importance of B12 deficiency.",1469145600,,260,4.22
8756062,5,B01DJQ9WUU,"This lady is a hero fighting for a lot of people who are denied treatment and answers, thank goodness for Sally Pacholok",1468800000,2,120,4.5

8756064,5,B01DJQ9WUU,An excellent educative film on the devastating effects of a simple vitamin deficiency. Today because of worldwide epidemic of misdiagnosis this film should be shown  to every Dr & in every university.,1466640000,3,200,5.25
8756065,5,B01DJQ9WUU,"Brilliant film. Possibly every nurses dream to kick Dr ass, not take NO for an answer & risk being fired. Most would back off, but not Sally Packolok. While caring for her aging father, working long hours & curiously gathering her own evidence to prove, she had really struck on something very important & relevant to each & every patient, from ''the cradle to the grave'' . Within her quest of ambitions, she meets & falls in love with the man of her dreams, even though, she says she wouldn't date a doctor. This film is streamed so well, I couldn't go to the ladies room, didn't want to miss any of it. Hopefully in the future this film will become as big as Erin Brockovich.",1463097600,,678,4.388888888888889
