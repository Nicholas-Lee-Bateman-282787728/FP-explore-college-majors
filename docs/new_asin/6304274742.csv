The problem is the transfer looks so cruddy. It looks as old as the original. Definitely needs to be remastered. And there are no special features.

You can never replace Clark Gable. The movie was a nice ending to Gone with the Wind.  You always hoped Rhett & Scarlett would have a happy ending.,1503273600,2,324,3.8636363636363638

It works fine in my Sony blu ray player. It is broken up into four chapters on one disc. There is no scene selection or special features and the picture could be a little better but overall I am very happy I bought it.",1498780800,,435,3.9545454545454546

832065,5,6304274742,"My wife had Scarlett on VHS, but ever since our VCR died years ago she couldn't watch it. It was one of her favorites. When I saw it came out on DVD I got it in time for Valentines and boy was it a winner. She LOVED it! We never knew it was actually a TV series but the presentation in this DVD was very nice. I actually watched it with her for the first time, and realized I actually liked the story myself.

If you are not sure if this is the same movie you had on VHS because it is called a mini-series event: it is your movie. Just split into 6 (I think it was 6 anyways) episodes. To me, it was better that way because I could watch a couple of episodes at a time instead of watching the whole thing at once.",1495324800,4,713,3.8503401360544216

832100,5,6304274742,"As this is the sequel to Gone With the Wind, the book was written by a DIFFERENT author, and thus made a few decades later this different cast, it was a very good movie to me! I will admit that I would love anything that gave me an actual ending to Rhett and Scarlett's love affair, and some may not like it, but I truely enjoyed it. It can't be the same bc it doesn't have Vivian Leigh or Clark Gable, BUT to judge it based off the first movie is not fair and it should be judged based off the cast it has, the time it was made, and the story it was telling (since it was written by a different author). Overall very lovely ending and the mini series to me did it justice and ended as it should have.",1493596800,6,701,3.943661971830986

There were times throughout the movie when I would say, Scarlett would not behave this way, or Rhett would not behave this way.  It was a nice story if you thought of them as other people.  I would recommend this movie and I will watch it again.",1489104000,2,395,4.090909090909091

Happily enough, I noticed there were a few minutes extra scenes that had not been included on my old VHS copies! What a treasure.

832302,5,6304274742,"I am a Daughter of the South, and Adore GONE WITH THE WIND...But SCARLETT is absolutely FABULOUS!  It picks up where GWTW left off and takes us into the Most Amazing struggle----We see SCARLETT begin to ""find herself.""  ......  She sure did need to....she was a SPOILED BRAT!  But, in SCARLETT, the sequel, she slowly----but surely finds out that all of her plots and plans will not/do not work!  When she----for one brief moment through Amazing Circumstances---finds herself in Rhett's arms, etc.......she becomes Pregnant!  Divorced from Rhett----he finds another woman and marries HER---and SCARLETT finds out she is Pregnant!  SCARLETT ""flees"" to Ireland so no one will know she is pregnant.  In Ireland she meets her Irish ""kin""----the O'Hara's----and HER FATHER'S MOTHER (in her late 90's) whose name is Katie Scarlett O""hara, who SCARLETT is named for...........from there on the Story is PURE GOLD!  Honestly, I love this movie as much as I love GONE WITH THE WIND!  If you love GWTW----You will LOVE SCARLETT----Joanne Whalley-Kilmer is brown-eyed where Vivien Leigh is  not---but Joanne  portrays the same strength and temperment of Scarlett, as SCARLETT begins the process of becoming a 'REAL WOMAN.""  BETTER LATE THAN NEVER!!!!  And in the end, SCARLETT and RHETT get together with their Magnificently Beautiful lilttle girl, and their lives are one FOREVER!  A beautiful ending----Being a Georgian, and having admired and studied Margaret Mitchell----I would ""tend to believe"" that if Margaret Mitchell had lived---and her life not having been cut short by her ""untimely death""----that SHE would have written the sequel herself----and it would---more than likely---have been very much like Alexandra Ripley's Book.......I have a Signed Copy of Scarlett, and of course, read it----I actually closed up in my guest bedroom one weekend as soon as I got it and read and read and read!  My husband would come to the door and say:  ""How's it going Honey?""  I would say:  ""Fabulous!""  He would laugh and go and pick us up something for our meal times.....I didn't even ""hibernate"" for GONE WITH THE WIND!  No, it is not Exactly like the book-----and running true to form-----no movies actually are......that is the way of the Silver Screen.....This book and this movie are ageless and timeless......they cry out to you Read Me----See Me.  It REVEALS the POWER of TRUE LOVE!  IT NEVER DIES!!!!!!!!!!!!",1486080000,,2406,5.176165803108808

I would love to see Alexander Skarsgard dye his hair dark and play Rhett.  He has already proven he can do a southern accent.

It is very different from the book Scarlett, by Alexandra Ripley, which it was based off of. Very different indeed. But it was still a very entertaining movie.

I will admit when Scarlett is admitting to Rhett Butler her undying love at the end of ""Gone with the Wind"" and Rhett says ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."", I thought, go after him woman!!  ...What!!! That's the end of the movie?!!  I will admit, Scarlett deserved it, but I just spent over 3 hours watching.. for that?!

The movie ""Scarlett"" continues where ""Gone with the Wind"", left off...sort of.  It's a mini series done quite a few years ago.  The stars did a good job, but its only my personal opinion, I rather have seen the stars of the original movie do it.

It was good, but didn't seem to have the same magic of the original movie, but lets face it, they didn't have the budget either.  Some of the settings in the mini series are BEAUTIFUL.  And though I think the length of ""Scarlett"" could have been shorter, I did like the story and really liked the ending.

For those""Game of Thrones"" Sean Bean enthusiasts, though I always thought he was handsome, a gorgeous young Sean portrays an upper class in Ireland. (Spoiler) Don't expect him to be the nice guy.

I'm glad I finally got to see this movie and happy to have bought it.",1432771200,18,1229,4.3464912280701755
832889,1,6304274742,"What a terrible waste of money.
One may be forgiven for the absence of Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh in this sequel to the magnificent Gone With the Wind.  Neither Timothy Dalton nor Joanne Whalley are in their league, although both try very hard. Perhaps the greatest handicap for Mr Dalton is the choice of wardrobe provided by the costume designers. They should have been forced to watch GWTW. A small toupe would not have been out of place either.
What is appalling is the changes made by the producers to Alexandra Ripley's novel. The novel was apparently approved by the Margaret Mitchell heirs. The changes occur mostly in the second part and are sufficient to make me wish that I had ever purchased the 2 disc edition. I will not create a spoiler alert any further than I already have.

This is no David O. Selznick-Clark Gable-Vivien Leigh masterpiece but it's a surprisingly good follow-up both in style and appearance (and length!) and it keeps you on the edge in ways the original film doesn't!

A surprising (or not) and entirely unintended side story is the incredible hubris and lack of cultural sensitivity of Americans abroad.

The last 2 are ridiculous, the characters were totally changed to present a story that was more like the 1970's than the 1870's.  Lord Fenton is introduced in episode two, even though he appeared only in the last few chapters of the book and she becomes his lover.  He's supposed to look like Rhett, he resembles Ashley more. There's very little mention of her O'Hara relatives, building up Ballyhara and farming. She and Suellen become friends; her priest cousin Colum falls in love with her; Cat is just mentioned in passing; not the center of Scarlett's life; the Fenians and their cause are mentioned briefly, the circumstances of Rhett's marriage to Ann are different, Scarlett really doesn't mature at all. There's a ridiculous trial in the 4th episode which brings Rhett to her side. It's like the screenwriter got tired of reading the book halfway through and made up his own story, with no prior knowledge or understanding of the characters.  I've just finished watching and I'm disgusted.  As far as the acting/casting, no one can hold a candle to the originals, but they weren't bad.",1395187200,,1249,4.790697674418604

Although no actor can compare to Clark Gable's 1936 performance as the darkly handsome Rhett Butler, Timothy Dalton definitely holds his own and wins one over with his devil-may-care charm. Joanne Whaley-Kilmer's attempt to fill Vivien Leigh's shoes is another matter, but in spite of her lame Southern accent, this movie belongs in every GWTW fan's library of collectibles.

833497,1,6304274742,"Maybe, if I hadn't read the book, I would just think it was bad, but I doubt it.
The story is ridiculous, the music is terrible, the acting is worse. If someone told me they put a bunch of actors names in a hat and just picked them out as they went it might actually make more sense.
If it wasn't enough that they completely butchered the storyline of the book it's made from, but Dalton and Whalley as Scarlett and Rhett is a travesty! Scarlett no matter how broken after Rhett leaves is still a Young, virbrant woman (she was only about 19 when gone with the wind ended) Whalley doesn't talk, look or act like the character in the book or Vivien Leigh's portrayal of her.
And Dalton as Rhett, UGH!

833681,3,6304274742,"From the Damning-With-Faint-Praise Department: This sequel to ""Gone With the Wind"" is not as bad as it could have been.  And in fact, in several respects it is quite good, at least as entertainment.  I think Joanne Whalley and, especially, Timothy Dalton, make a pretty good pair of lead characters, as long as one doesn't expect Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable.  In fact, the best way to enjoy this sequel - and one can enjoy it - is just to accept it for the pulp entertainment it is and not pine for the original.

The story is intriguing with some nice twists and inventions, although there are a few too many over-the-top soap opera ""Oh, Come On, Now!"" moments, e.g. the the whole murder trial plot at the end. The 1939 classic was soap opera, too, but it was exalted soap opera and done with more style and flair than this one provides.  I liked some of the new characters, especially Sally, Mrs. Butler, and Grandfather Robillard (Sir John Gielgud exalts whatever he appears in).  The new Irish characters less so, particularly Scarlett's limp noodle of an Irish cousin.  Sean Bean's Snidely Whiplash bad guy is a bit much, although Bean does do good-looking villains well.

Some have faulted Ripley for jettisoning a lot of Mitchell's characters.  I don't have a problem with that.  Mammy and Prissy would not be nearly as effective in the watered-down PC treatment they would have to receive today.  (The painfully PC exchange between Scarlett and ""Pansy,"" Prissy's replacement, makes one shudder at how Mammy and Prissy would have fared.) And good riddance to Ashley, the most tiresome character in Mitchell's book; this version has him collapsing on his knees in tears at Melanie's funeral, which is ridiculous.  Over all, Ripley and the director were probably wise to strike out in new directions, based on hints in Mitchell's original.  (Mrs. Butler, Grandfather Robillard and Scarlett's Savannah aunts are all mentioned in Mitchell's book but do not appear.)

At least Scarlett's Irish grandmother knows somethin' about birthin' babies, even if the means are a bit unorthodox.

Still, taken for what it is, this is worth a watch.  Just make sure you rent before buying.",1375056000,,2180,4.883152173913044

That never happened in the book, quite the contrary in fact---Rhett's letter pleading for her to please leave after he admits he cannot stand the truth of his feelings is why she leaves, and her note to his mother is that she loves her; the angry confrontation is pure fabrication.

After Charleston the movie deviates almost entirely from the book story.  First Rhett does not divorce Scarlett while she is Savannah, nor does she leave America for Ireland with any expectation that he will. The story once she arrives in Ireland is completely different.  Firstly, Earl Fenton is not there when she arrives at Ballyhara, nor does he appear in the book until 4 years after her arrival.  She returns to America to sell here Atlanta real estate holdings some time after Rhett divorces her, but that has nothing to do with Suellen, and certainly has nothing to do with Fenton's growing violence as portrayed in the movie.  Rhett discovers where Scarlett is on her return trip to Ireland with a port call in Charleston where they see each other, him from the dock, her from the boat deck, as the boat pulls out to sea.  Rhett does come for her, but most certainly not with his new wife Ann Hampton in tow.  Scarlett proves remarkably successful in rapidly advancing up the ranks Anglo aristocratic society in Ireland.  That ultimately is how she gets Rhett back, as Rhett, an Anglo aristocrat himself, cannot stand the richest men in England and Ireland fawning over her while he's left out.  He makes repeated trips to Ireland, purportedly to buy horses, employing his friends to keep tabs on her. Lord Fenton, the richest man in England, takes note after her dbut in Dublin Castle and dance with the Viceroy (and Rhett), and when he moves in to court Scarlett, this after his wife Ann Hampton has died, it is the last straw for Rhett.  In the movie Fenton's role and character is completely misrepresented; his movie portrayal as a rapist is all wrong.  Fenton never displays any violence toward Scarlett (except a brief encounter on horseback which she rather enjoyed).  He displays supreme aristocratic arrogance viewing his marriage plans for her as an exercise in horse breeding (and tells her as much)---the plan being to mix his aristocratic blood with her quality strains and traits, which he sees in Cat her daughter, and produce an heir which he needs.  She agrees knowing she cannot conceive a child anyway anymore. But he certainly does not rape her or anyone else in the book; nobody kills Fenton; and of course there is no murder trial.  Rhett rushes to Scarlett after learning that she is to be married to Fenton, whilst Scarlett discovers from Moreland, Rhett's friend, the truth about Ann's death, convinced that he will come for her...

The movie is alternate sequel to Gone with the Wind, not one ""based"" on the book...The objective of the movie seems to be to create a role for Sean Bean to play another villain, thus necessitating the changing of the story to make a villain out of Fenton...Joanne Whatley plays an excellent Scarlett O'Hara and carries the story, in many ways far more credibly than Vivian Leigh (1939) who is a bit too young and for her role...Whatley displays the mature Scarlett O'Hara remarkably.",1281830400,,3677,4.798732171156894

The Scarlett book sequel was slightly different than expected by Alexandra Ripley but the movie was just way out in left field-not so much the story but just the actors...do watch it if your a fan just like I am but don't hold your expectations too high, in this movie Scarlett is not likable, not beautiful, and not endearing to us and the feeble attempt she makes at talking like a southerner is irritating...why the directors chose English actors is a mystery to me??? Timothy is handsome and big of course and he fits Rhett decent-not Clark Gable of course but still I know none of us expect either of them to equal Vivien Leigh or Clark but it would have been nice to at least seen a good attempt for a novel that was a sequel to such a phenomenal book like GWTW.",1278892800,,939,4.433526011560693

But honestly, Gone With the Wind was a cinematic and literary masterpiece. How many of those do we get? Not so many. I love GWTW, but after every time I watch or read it, I long to see Scarlett and Rhett reunited. Or at least to see Scarlett pursue him some more. Once she realizes she truly loves him, how can she just let him go? That's not the stubborn selfish Scarlett we know and love. So mainly I watch and read Scarlett to see her try and get Rhett back. It appeases the hopeless romantic in me to think they could still end up together. The movie itself is of course not on the scale of GWTW, but it's definitely enjoyable. I particularly liked Scarlett's adventures in Ireland, where she gets in touch with her heritage. So if you just can't let go of Rhett and Scarlett being together, watch it.

834086,5,6304274742,"I must admit, I had reservations about this film. With the Liberal media of the day being so against anything Southern, and GWTW having been so very race-relations friendly, I wondered if this movie really would take up where Clark and Vivien left it! I was more than happy with the choices of Joanna Kilmer, and Timothy Dalton. He makes a much better Rhett than he does a 007! The feel of this movie - it's so... immediate! Every aspect, every character, and every angle is extremely well planned. This movie makes you feel good about the South, and goes literally back to its Celtic roots. Several times the symbology can bring a tear, like when Scarlett is scooping dirt at the original Tara in Ireland!  Or meeting Katy Scarlett, the original, her grandmother, for the first time! Where do they get such great actors and actresses?

True, most of the Southerners are depicted as either over-moneyed socialites or with morals bad enough to shame Oscar Wilde... but it is such a break from Southerners being depicted as race-crazed rednecks that I barely noticed...  I know we will never get a movie about real Southerners like Thomas Jefferson, or Jefferson Davis (unless you count my film, The Great Sacrifice of President Jefferson Davis (2007) - Coming Soon to Amazon.com ), but in the interim, we'll take Rhett and Scarlett... again! When Rhett rushes home to see Mammy die, that's just priceless!  I give it however many stars I can, and am glad it is six hours long!

I also loved Timothy Dalton as Rhett, he is so dashing, and rakish, and handsome, and he has those classic, movie star looks, and I just loved his mustache!

 Scarlett helps Ashley and his business, over a promise she made to Melanie, and she finally realizes what her true feelings for Ashley really are!
 Scarlett tries to win Rhett back, and he of course is resisting, and Scarlett tries to make amends with her sister, who got mad at Scarlett over marrying her beau Frank Kennedy! And Scarlett gets to meet her father's O'Hara kin, and Scarlett also gets to meet her mother's very rich father, and Scarlett even meets Rhett's mother, and the Charleston society!

Scarlett and Rhett end up getting together, after a boating accident, and then she finds out that Rhett has left her again, and she then finds out that she is going  to have his baby! So she flees to Ireland, and builds a new life for herself, and guess who she meets in Ireland, someone from her past that she thought she'd never see again, Rhett and his new wife!

834268,4,6304274742,"I tried to watch Scarlett without comparing it to GWTW, as many previous reviewers had suggested, but that is easier said than done.  The story and characters are so intertwined, you can't help but think how they got to where they are in the current situation.  That being said, Scarlett impresses me as a movie that had a lot of work, planning, and thought behind it.  There is some actual depth to the story which traces Scarlett back to her ancestral homeland in Ireland and for me actually fills in a lot of the gaps in the original GWTW.  Also the settings and costumes are extraordinarily well done.  The colors and photography are outstanding, however, I wish this would have been filmed in 16:9 widescreen instead of the 4:3 television format.  Unfortunately in 1994, when this made-for-TV movie was made, few directors were thinking about HDTV.

My biggest gripe about the movie is Scarlett herself.  Timothy Dalton makes a convincing Rhett Butler, although you find yourself always comparing him to Clark Gable.  Actually, had Dalton been cast in the original GWTW, he might have actually made a better Rhett.  But it's too late and Gable is a hard act to follow.

Getting back to the character Scarlett O'Hara, I'm not sure Joanne Whalley was the best choice here.  She is a fine actress indeed, but she is no Vivien Leigh.  Sure, the character Scarlett is supposed to be assertive and aggressive and maybe even a little bossy at times.  But in the mini-series, Scarlett comes off as being a ""witch"" (spelled with a ""b"") which for me at least, was thoroughly distracting and downright annoying a good bit of the time.

I've read both the book GWTW and seen the movie numerous times and I would have never ever characterized the original Scarlett with the b-word.  Even though she could get a little self centered at times, you always knew in your heart that she was basically a good person and maybe just caught up in her own emotions and ambitions.

But Whalley, playing Scarlett, comes off as being downright sinister at times.  Calling the movie ""Scarlett"" couldn't be more accurate because throughout the entire movie you can perceive Scarlett thinking ""This is about ME and don't even think about getting in my way"".  I'm not sure it's the dialog that is at fault here.  I think it is more the way Whalley projects her lines and the little smirk on her face that says ""I'm number one here"".  I'm not willing to blame Whalley for this.  Maybe that's what the director wanted from her as an actress.  But to me this is the number one reason this is not the great movie it could be.

My second complaint has to do with some highly improbable circumstances.  For instance, Scarlett goes from being penniless to having the equivalent in today's dollars of about $10 million in the original GWTW then suddenly she is worth the equivalent of several billion dollars in the movie Scarlett.  None of this is explained fully in the movie and what little explanation there is, is not convincing to me.  I would not normally dwell on such a minor point except that Scarlett uses her vast new-found wealth to change the lives of the many people she comes in contact with.  Another highly improbable circumstance is when Good Sam goes from being a charming but uneducated field hand to a highly successful businessman.  Again, just not convincing to me.

Finally, the overly graphic sexual encounters were completely unnecessary.  I was amazed they actually got away with showing this on TV back in 1994.  The scenes add nothing of value to the movie and were probably added just to appease the investors and movie moguls.

Overall though, it was much better than I expected and I would recommend it as a must see.  If you can overlook the flaws, I think you will find Scarlett the movie enjoyable and entertaining and definitely worth seeing.",1207440000,3,3845,4.715142428785607

It is a long movie (however I was engrossed all those hours), and it has it's fair share of DRAMA, but it's a movie that delivers storylines that won't disappoint. Think over-the-top ""Soap Opera"" material! Joanne Whalley-Kilmer plays a convincing Scarlett with much grit and elegance.

834343,3,6304274742,"First of all there are a lot more cons than pros, but somebody did go to the trouble of adapting the book to the screen even if it was the small screen. For a hardcore Gone With The Wind Fan this movie may be too much to fathom. I've read GWTW and Scarlett twice. Now, this is the movie so I won't go into the book issues.

The pros: The costumes are pretty amazing. Timothy Dalton does a surprisingly good job as a rough Rhett Butler. The movie itself is entertaining enough and easy to follow. I wouldn't consider it a worthless piece of tripe and wasted celluloid space so it gets an average 3 stars from me. If you can sit through five hours of movie it's pretty ok. I will admit I liked the end of the movie better than the book. It expanded more on Rhett's relationship with Cat and life with Scarlett once they were reunited.

The cons: Well lets face it, there's no outdoing the original. Gone With The Wind is a classic and it's in the top 100 movies ever made list. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer grates on my nerves in the beginning and also Scarlett's emerald eyes didn't show up in this movie. Ever heard of color contacts people? Hello!!! But eventually after a couple of hours I got used to Joanne's Scarlett. The creative license the screenwriter and director took in adapting this movie from the book is ridiculous. First of all, the scene where Scarlett looks at herself in the mirror and is appalled at the vision and then breaks the mirror with the liquor bottle happens a lot earlier in the book... like before she went to Charleston to win back Rhett. But that's a small liberty and who cares when it happens. The biggest issues I have are in the latter half of the movie in Ireland. First of all old Katie Scarlett dies. Second there was an old ""witch"" who helped Scarlett give birth on Halloween. Third the whole Fenian brotherhood subplot was completely destroyed. Why include that if they were going to completely write it out when it was in the book until almost the very end!!! Fourth Colum didn't get killed by Lord Fenton. Fifth Lord Fenton was not the evil man they portrayed him as and he never raped Scarlett. Scarlett was NEVER on trial for murder in the book. That was taking interpretation beyond anything normal or right. I was really irritated at that... even yelling at the tv about how that wasn't in the book! I understand you have to leave some things out or the movie would be 10 hours long, but seeing as how it was 5 they should have stuck a little better to the story. Why completely change the plot?

Overall if you like period movies with sappy, suspenseful romance plots that are around 5 hours long then this is the movie for you. If you are looking for a true sequel to the original movie in the same splendor don't hold your breath. Even if you are looking for a movie version of the book don't expect much. In my opinion it's watchable - at least 2.5 stars worth but half stars aren't an option so I was generous.",1188000000,2,2957,4.382513661202186

834347,3,6304274742,"I am a huge, huge fan of ""Gone With The Wind"", and therefore had to really prep myself for this classic slice of early ninties TV Miniseries by completely abolishing my expectations, prejudices and memories of the indescribably brilliant prequel. ""Gone With The Wind"", I told myself, is an incredible motion picture, even now, some sixty eight years after its initial release. It's expansive, breathtaking, exciting, emotional, and absolutely riveting. ""Scarlett"", I replied, is a T.V. miniseries with that guy that used to be James Bond, and whats-her-name on a horse in ""Willow"".

And so, bearing in mind these limitations, I sat down to an altogether pleasant surprise: ""Scarlett"" is no ""Gone With The Wind"", but it does what it does with vim and vigour, and is a very, very entertaining (and oftentimes side-splittingly hilarious) way to pass six hours.

Basically: It's the day after the final scene of the original movie, and Scarlett shows up at Melanie Wilkes' funeral. She's still on her mission to recapture the affections of Rhett Butler, and must run a gamut of innumerable obstacles to get there, stretching from social disgrace, to the sale of Tara, to neatly sidestepping an incestuous relationship with her cousin - a Catholic priest - and becoming involved with a forerunner political group of the I.R.A.

True to miniseries form, the production design and sets are expansive and spectacular - from Charleston and Atlanta to Dublin and London, the recreation of the historic backdrop of  the original ""Gone With The Wind"" is painstaking, and rewarding: a shame that there isn't the same talent behind the camera to photograph the beautiful sets and costumes in ""Scarlett"". Still, what's there is beautiful and very true to form, and visually, ""Scarlett"" works reasonably well.

Acting-wise there's not a whole lot to stand out - Joanne Whalley-Kilmer isn't very good - bored and restrained - for the first ninety minutes or so, but then sinks her teeth into her role and is, for the main, a very watchable and likeable actress. Timothy Dalton, poor soul, is really dreadful as Rhett - his ""accent"" is the stuff of ridicule and he generally looks like he'd rather be anyplace else. Other principal nods go to Sean Bean as Evil Lord Richard Fenton, Rosaleen Linehan as the put-upon Irish housekeeper Mrs. Fitz., Colm Meany as Fr. Colum O' Hara, and John Gielgud as Grandfather Robillard.

Sidebar: As an Irish man myself I am used to American actors forcing foul accents when Irishness is called for, but here, the actors are Irish so the accents are authentic, and that's a nice touch: even if the acting is, in parts, unspeakably foul, at least the audio is authentic!

The minus points of casting come in the shape of Ann-Margaret as Belle Watling (Oh good Lord, she is appalling, it's like watching a slow-mo clip of a car accident with a big red wig on it) and bored, trite Annabeth Gish as repulsively ordinary Ann Hampton-Butler (although, given Dalton's reading of Rhett, maybe she's not so out of place after all?). When Ann meets her untimely demise (she dies of a nasty case of Plot), you feel relief and satisfaction - odd, since she's supposed to be a sympathetic character. Tina Kelleher as Mary Boyle puts me in mind of that ""Day In The Life Of An Irish Woman"" puppet vignette from the episode of ""Family Guy"", where Peter takes Chris to discover his Irish roots - Mary Boyle is the personification of everything pathetic, and so it's no surprise that her appearances on screen makes you want to vomit. Still, for entertainment value, her wild ramblings and attempted suicides can't be beat: this is real train-wreck acting wrought by a normally decent actress - she must have been in on the joke!

So why, with an average, unintentionally hilarious cast and sub-average direction, am I awarding three stars to ""Scarlett""? Well, it's a miniseries, and I like miniseries. It's a bodice-ripping, pot-boiling, totally chiaroscuro romp through six hours of implausible plot twists (Scarlett, at one point, resembles Saint TooraLoora of Ireland with a direct line to Jesus), hilarious historical inaccuracies, plenty of ""Mommie Dearest""-esque overacting, and enough large gowns to keep a platoon of Drag Queens in work until the end of time. It's a lot of fun, but be warned: should you choose to watch it you WILL be bored silly for the first hour and a half or so: it's not really until Rhett leaves Scarlett in Charleston that the action really quickens pace. If you liked the likes of ""Sins"" and ""Master of the Game"" then you might like ""Scarlett"", too. Give it a chance and it will entertain you: as a continuation of ""Gone With The Wind"" it doesn't work at all, but then, what could have? ""Scarlett"" is self-contained, but for what it is, it's very enjoyable.",1185321600,9,4790,4.875921375921376

Firstmost, the storyline of the film was very...let's say different, than the novel it was supposed to be painted after. Now the novel itself TO ME, didn't keep true to Gone With The Wind, but that's just my opinion. This movie however was 10 times worse. So many things happened in the movie that didn't happen in the book. And characters changed...and if I'm not mistaken, my most favorite scene at the end where they are looking for 'Kat' and Rhett finds out that she's his daughter...wasn't in there. Walking away on a hill? NO! Give me hiding on a hay loft. psh.

And the actors themselves omg. You got used to seeing Timothy Dalton as Rhett, but Joanne Whalley just didn't look the part to me. Her face was too thin, she was too thin...Scarlett was supposed to be curvy if you follow Vivien Leigh.

834503,4,6304274742,"I am a big fan of Gone With The Wind, so naturally I enjoyed watching Scarlett. This movie kind of takes up where GWTW leaves off, with the death of Scarlett's good friend, Melanie Wilkes, the wife of Scarlett's former object of desire, Ashley. Once again, Scarlett can't help but make a spectacle of herself as she comes to the aid of Ashley, who is distraught over his wife's death, to the point that Scarlett and Ashley's sister get into an argument at the gravesite. From there, and throughout the movie, it's one adventure after another for one of literature's most beloved characters as she goes from Atlanta, to Charleston, to Ireland and even England, while at the same time harboring her undying love for her ex-husband Rhett Butler, who has since moved on and remarried to a lady from his hometown of Charleston.  By the end of the movie, I think you have a better idea of just who Scarlett is and you see, not to give too much of the movie away, an evolution in this character as she discovers her roots and goes about restoring and forming family ties. This movie is filled with intrigue, bits of humor, romance, and even murder, and you'll love every minute. Joanne Whalley does an excellent job of reprising the role of Scarlett O'Hara Butler, and Timothy Dalton, one of the sexiest men alive, in my opinion, brings vivacity and spark to Rhett Butler that would make Clark Gable proud. The only drawback to some folks would be the length of the film -nearly 6 hours I believe. But, Gone With the Wind is a long movie as well, so if you can sit through that, you can sit through this, or watch it in parts.

The story is a very satisfying sequel to ""Gone With The Wind,"" and when its seven hours was over I wanted more.

834558,1,6304274742,"After reading Alexandra Ripley's incredible sequel to GWTW, I was eager to see ""Scarlett"" brought to life by a miniseries.  I was sorely disappointed.  The movie destroys the story.  Not only does it fail to bring the book to life, but it changes the plot and twists it into an unrecognizable, horrific mishmash of repulsion.  I was offended and disgusted by much of the story that was added on by the screenwriter and director.

Joanne Whalley, while a good actress in her own rite, was not my ideal pick for Scarlett.  She didn't have the fire or feminine wiles that Vivien Leigh portrayed so perfectly in GWTW.  Timothy Dalton was the best thing about the movie, but his story and the way he appeared to be in love with Anne Hamptom was uncomfortable to watch and goes against the fact that he is supposed to be in love with Scarlett always and forever.  Annabeth Gish as Anne Hampton was another very strange casting choice, in my opinion, but I  first saw Gish as ""Monica Reyes"" in the X-Files, so maybe that type-casts her in my mind.

The movie was beautiful to look at with amazing sets and locations and costumes.  But the beauty was not enough to make up for a script that should never have made it to the screen.",1171324800,2,1223,4.48868778280543

Joanne Whalley Kilmer is cast as Scarlett, which I thought to be a mistake, she doesn't embody what I believe to be the Scarlettesque attitude and demeanor. Timothy Dalton on the other hand I thought was brillantly cast but like most his films you like his character more than you are supposed to I think. He wasn't quite as hard as Rhett should be but nevertheless entertaining. My favorite casting in the film would hands down have to be Sean Bean in the role of Lord Fenton, that man just oozes creepiness and sex-appeal. Once again he plays a baddie. But so bad its good.

The scenery is just gorgeous throughout the film, WE SEE TARA AGAIN!! The costumes are sumptious, especially's Scarlett's masquerade costume that is just dripping with diamonds.

They made him too soft. In the book, the trial of when Scarlett is commented of murder doesn't even happen. Its like they didn't even try to keep it faithful to Gone With The Wind, let alone the book, Scarlett is portrayed as a strong-headed woman, in the movie during the end she is portrayed weak and ends up letting a man beat and rape her which Scarlett would never do and THAT didn't even happen in the book.

She wrote a masterpiece in the 1930's, then Alexandra Ripley bought the rights to her book by conning Margaret Mitchell's heirs to sell out the legacy of their relative.  Alexandra Ripley's novel was an embarrasing pile of mush, even worse than a Barbara Courtland romance novel.

Beautiful costumes and a good cast - but the script is a soap opera and very poorly written with too many cliche's.  The TV movie version is even worse than Alexandra Ripley's book. I would have given this movie zero stars - but gave it 2 stars solely for the world class acting of Sean Bean as the deliciously evil Lord Fenton.

Sean Bean heats up the screen as a sexy, feral villian along the lines of ""The Man You Love to Hate"" as an unsafe sex symbol.  Unless you are a Sean Bean fan, there is nothing worthwhile about this film.  The script is trite, cliche'd and very slow moving.  Sean Bean is only in Disc 1 and his character is eliminated and the movie slides downhill from there.

Disc 2 is overwrought with very boring, drawn out courtroom scenes...I was almost rooting that Scarlett would be hanged for the murder just to see an end to this movie!

I've always liked Joanna Whaley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton. They are excellent actors wasted in this pile of mush movie. Ann-Margaret's performance as Belle Watling is so bad I wanted to slap her.

This may not sound like it should be a problem, but if you're a fan of the novels you know that there is much emphasis on the beauty of her green eyes.  This was very important to me, as I'm sure it is to others.  Why they couldn't give the actress a pair of colored lenses is beyond my understanding.

There is simply no comparasion to Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, to try and do so would be impossible.

834737,3,6304274742,"The most difficult thing about watching this movie is to realize that you aren't really watching a sequel to GWTW, but an interesting attempt to sop the curiosity of original GWTW fans who wondered (hoped??) if Rhett would ever take Scarlett back.  This overly long epic (6hrs 40min) answers in the affirmative just like we knew it would.  Up front, lets dispense with the fact that Joanne Whalley-Kilmer is no Vivian Leigh and Timothy Dalton, for all his ego and arrogance, is certainly no Gable.

Having said all this, JWK does a fine job going from Southern Belle, to Irish Patrone ""The O'Hara"" and back again on several occasions with charm and flair.  Her best scenes were with Sean Bean, who was the arch villian, and unfotunately his long-anticipated death provided some of the overdrawn courtroom melodrama.  Dalton who did a credible couple of stints as James Bond sleepwalked his way through this flick - he could have phoned it in.  Jean Smart was superior and we should have seen her more often.  Remainder of cast was credible.  I gave it three stars because it was interesting enough to keep me through the entire story.  Color photography was stunning.  We saw this as the mini-series on TV first - and I think it probably improved in seeing it in two sessions - I don't know of anyone who could do the entire flick in one sitting.

In the First disc, if you read the book, just like Gone With the Wind, there are many things that had to be left out, or altered to keep a flow of the story, and Scarlett was just that, great, I mean it changed the story a bit here and there but was consistant.  When I placed the second disc in, the changes in the story were altogether dramatic, as if you were reading or seeing a different story altogether.  I did not like the turn they took.  Scarlett was a smart woman, fiesty and not to mention always got her way so the whole rape scene followed by the trial, leads me to believe that the director did not know Scarlett at all.  I understand that they wanted to take a completely different approach, but to change her altogether and make her a weak character saddens me.  I did like how they melded the relationship to reunite the sisters, but Scarlett was a phenominal feminist way ahead of her time so to reduce her to such a weak person, well, you just tried to sell me a Kia by the reputation of a Benz, and that is just wrong.  Even if I had never read the book, I refuse to believe the author wanted Scarlett to be such a winey brainless woman.",1146096000,8,1390,4.107011070110701
834858,3,6304274742,"Joanne Whalley-Kilmer (she later dropped Kilmer) is okay as a ""new and improved"" Scarlett.  You get the sense that Scarlett's a completely different person once Melly has died.  She's realized that she never truly loved Ashley, that the only woman who truly was her friend is gone, and the only man who truly loved her is gone as well.  It makes sense for her to be much more headstrong (and a bit more ruthless) than she was in Gone With The Wind.  But of course, she becomes a wispy little thing when she tries flirting back with Rhett (the severely miscast Timothy Dalton).

The 4-part miniseries is based on the novel Scarlett (by Alexandra Ripley), which is considered a non-canon sequel to Gone With The Wind (both the book and the movie).  It's pretty long, clocking in at 6 hours, though you perhaps can simply watch the first disc (parts 1 and 2) and be satisfied.  My grim and cynical side is saying pretend that Scarlett dies in childbirth at the end of part 2 to give it a sense of finality.

Quite honestly parts 3 and 4 are dull.  The story moves along like a bad soap opera, and it's a wholly different film than the first two parts.

The 2-disc DVD is okay, though the making-of featurette could have been longer.  Video quality is okay for a TV miniseries.  I'm surprised that this DVD is available.  For the longest time (from around 2002-2005), I always read that this was out of print (though I can't understand why).  Pick it up if you like, though only if you want to step into it with an open mind (read: don't compare it to GWTW, otherwise you won't be satisfied with it at all).",1143936000,4,1603,4.426621160409557

I think that in some ways, this story is more romantic than GWTW. Of course if you make comparisons, no one can replace Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, but I must say that Timothy Dalton had my blood pressure rising!!! The story line was very interesting and I feel that is certainly brought the original story to a conclusion after 55 years. Didn't we all want to find out if Rhett went back to Scarlett or did she marry Ashley?? The supporting cast was great with Julie Harris, Stephen Collins, Jean Smart, ....

I have not yet read the book, but already lost the interest although people said the book is better. I didn't expect it to be comparable to the original, but neither did I expect it to be SO bad. It is not even romantic. The plot is boring and unbelievable. The whole thing of finding roots in Irland and having an affair with Lord Fenton, and being raped and later accused of murder is totally ridiculous, not to mention Rhett married Anne.

The actors tried their best, but what could they do when their characters were created so? But still, Joanne Whalley's Scarlett lacks the beauty and strength, the only thing that could remind me of Vivian's Scarlett is ""I'll think about it tomorrow"", a line that defines the heroine but when used repeatedly, loses its meaning. Timothy Dalton's Rhett is dull and uninterestd in Scarlett despite some occasional scenes of him showing tenderness to her.

I would not recommend it. If you are so curious as I was, rent it. You will find yourself fast forwarding the tape to the last minute just to satisfy yourself with a happy ending.",1142640000,4,1356,4.57201646090535

834970,4,6304274742,"Still better than the movie version of GWTW!! It seems that many more people have read ""Scarlett"" then have read GWTW. In the book named Scarlett, we get to see Scarlett mature into a person who cares about many people besides herself. The movie version does not show this as well. I believe that a good part of the reason is that the movie condenses the book by several years, thus making Scarlett's tranformation less believable. For example, Scarlett grows emotionally a great deal during Cat's first year of life. The movie completely skips this whole year!! And, like everyone else, I saw absolutely no sense in substituting the whole trial story line for the book's story.

As to the actors.......I give all of then high praise for their portrayals of the characters. James Dalton does a WONDERFUL job as Rhett--far better than Clark Gable. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer does the best she can with the script that she's given. I did wonder, though, why she went through so many changes of clothes. Part of Scarlett's transformation was the fact that she gave up her love of clothes for native Irish dress. Perhaps it was thought that the audience would be lost without all the costumes to look at.

Finally, I must comment on the many criticisms of Scarlett played with brown eyes. Vivien Leigh had blue eyes, which I admit was closer. But who cares? And how may people noticed that Timothy Dalton had blue eyes? What?? Rhett Butler's dark eyes were always described in both books.

My advice? Enjoy Scarlett, the book. And enjoy the movie, as well. Just don't compare, and you'll enjoy both.",1130803200,13,1590,4.774545454545454

But the sequel would have been better if both vivian leigh and clark gable were still alive and when you had most of the production crew still alive. Because now the ideal of having the oringial cast in a production, well the only ones who are still alive are olivia de havilland and the two women who play scarlett's sisters in the original one.

835112,1,6304274742,"GWTW the book is a wonderful, captivating book. Mitchell's Rhett is a man every woman wants. A man who is self-made, financially successful, and full of wisdom. An older, sophisticated man who falls in love with a child. His desire for her is driven by his unconscious wish to take care, and guide her to reach her full potential. He sees a feisty girl who could grow to be his equal. And he longs to conquer her heart for she would make his life constantly interesting. Here is a man who is afraid of a boring married life. A man who is in a way naive himself for failing to realize that two feisty people make a bad couple. Fail to realize that a child will grow and change. Fail to realize that a woman's ability to change is unbelievably beyond a man's comprehension. He wants to protect her and keep her a child all the while forgetting that her ability to survive and change is what make him fall head over hill in love with her. He knows he is lead into his own trap - the one he has tried so hard to avoid (telling her he is not the married kind) to keep his ego in tact.

 Scarlett is a young girl who is coming of age - falling in love for all the wrong reason. She is thrust into hardship unexpectedly. Force to take the role of a leader, she revels in it. Whether Mitchell sufferred hardship in her life, I do not know. But in Scarlett, she painted a very precise and accurate picture of a girl who is force to become an adult and become so resilient she shuts out everything else except for her need to survive and her once beautiful daydream (in the blind love for Ashley). The value of her old days is so embedded in her that she fails to see Rhett in any light other than the one the society cast upon him. She see no light at the end of the tunnel so she keep on going while still wishing to return to the good old days of carefree and innocence. She see death, poverty and miseries around her. The men around her hold hopelessly to the good old days and sit tightly on their ego. She has not the time and leisure to explore love so she knows no better. One has to go through similar road to be able to convey it this well.

 I love the movie GWTW as well as the book. Years ago when I first watched it after reading the book, my love for it was due to seeing the beautiful stars and costumes. Now, seeing it again, I still love it. Except I wish the movie would show the times Rhett spent supporting, encouraging Scarlett to become a successful business woman and guard Scarlett during her second pregnancy. To me, it shows the depth of his love for her. Other than that the movie stays pretty close and painted a very good picture parralel to Mitchell's thoughts. She grow up at the end of GWTW in realizing the Ashley she fell for is the pigment of her once naive imagination. Realize that Melanie is her true friend albeit one who does not share her ways of thinking. Melanie was a noble woman - devoid of judgement and gossip, and fiercely loyal. She complements Scarlett perfectly. And Scarlett realizes that Rhett has been instrumental in her quest to financial success.

 In Scarlett the sequel, Scarlett nows can afford to contemplate about love. The book does a good job in showing her evolving into our so called ""good girl"". And showing us the love between Rhett and Scarlett still burn like fire. But the movie is a big dissapointment.

 Timothy Dalton does not make a convincing Rhett. He does not smirk, his eyes do not dance with light, instead he moped. That is so unlike Rhett. Rhett would not marry that dreadful Anne. I failed to feel for her though I did with the book's Anne. The book made clear that Rhett married her to make thing right by the society he was trying to make peace with. The costume for Rhett here is horrible. The untidy clothes, the colors - they are not in line with a dashing, sophisticated, worldly Rhett. Gable's wardrobe showed a man with impeccable taste afforded by his wealth built by his extensive traveling to the fashion capital of the world. The same cannot be said about Dalton's wardrobe. I think Pierce Brosnan would turn in a better Rhett with his smirk and light-leapping eyes. Rhett left not because he could not live with Scarlett. He left because he could not be sure that Scarlett loves him for him or because she lost interest in Ashley. The sequel would be better showing him still unsure until the end. All I see here is his sulking, making weak decisions.

 Joanne is not Scarlett. She lacks that charm that is the key to Scarlett. Scarlett would light up a room and charms the pants of the men in it. Her face is hard to look at at times. She fails to show the emotion that would showcase Scarlett's growth in the relationship department. Scarlett would not fall for Fenton. She would still be feisty when it come to business but evolve in the human relation department. None of that is seen in this movie. I would love to see more of her relationship with Cat.

 The only thing that is satisfying to a die hard romantic like me is the two getting back together. The porno and violent scenes are disgusting. All in all, I hope for a better remake - one that evokes romance and serenity not nonsensical violence.",1091404800,11,5195,4.344329896907216

I found it quite interesting to meet Scarlett's posh relations on her mother's side, and I was glad that Suellen had finally got herself a husband, she wanted one os much, poor soul.  The killing off of Mammy is of course a big mistake, but the author clearly doesn't know how to portray black characters convincingly, which is I suppose why the film suddenly shifts to Ireland, where Scarlett goes to discover her roots.  From here on it's downhill all the way.  Pure melodrama, and Sean Bean is so blatantly wicked he might as well wear a hat with 'villain' written on it.  If only Margaret Mitchell had written a sequel herself!  Naturally I want Scarlett to get Rhett back, who doesn't, but the way it happens in this film is just too silly for words.

835256,2,6304274742,"I love GWTW, personnally I think that it is one of the BEST movies of all time-- this is not up to par.  I have read GWTW by Mitchell and I read Scarlett by Alexandra Ripley and I must say that the original is by far better.
Now the Scarlett Miniseries was suppose to be the sequel to the GWTW movie not the book otherwise it would confuse those who've seen the original but didn't read the book, like Scarlett's other children by her first two husbands, I digress.  However, the screenwriter or even the director of this movie thought it important to put Suellen having a family, after all in the first movie you expect her to be an old maid!
Joanne Whalley as Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler is a like unbelieveable and I do agree with the other reviewers that said Terri Garber(Ashton of North and South) might have been a better choice, albeit type-casting.  Timothy Dalton as Rhett Butler is a good choice, I actually liked him as Rhett and seemed a better notice that in the sequel Rhett has a Southern accent.  Which from my understanding Clark Gable refused to play the part with the accent.
My overall opinion of this movie is blah at best, if you really must see it I recommend finding it at your local video rental store.",1083628800,14,1240,4.4493392070484585

Sure, its not as great as the original and was a trifle politically correct, but I LOVED seeing the beautiful costumes, handsome actors, and of course our beloved fibbing procrastinating Scarlett. The plot? Well, after reading numerous romance novels, I can't honestly say there is anything TOO original here, Scarlett and Rhett (played by hunky Timothy Dalton) eventually part because of a 'big misunderstanding,' but reunite after Scarlett is accused of a hideous crime.
Peeves? I really hated to see Scarlett grovel towards the end. I felt Rhett was just as much to blame for the divorce. Also, I felt it unrealistic that the maid and butler would stand by and allow Scarlett be assaulted with a fire poker. Please. Also, I wanted to know what happened to Mary. This is never mentioned, and I felt the authors should've come up with a better manner of getting Scarlett off the hook. I was really surprised that Scarlett (always a pretty decent judge of male character), would fall for Lord Fenton. Ech.

It would be very hard to follow in those foot steps, but this made for T.V. soap opera can't even be compared. It's embarrasing! Almost as bad as the 1972 stage musical. Stephen Mitchell, what are you thinking? First a Japanese stage show, then Leslie Ann Warren in a musical version in L.A., then Ms. Ripley's forgettable sequel, and now this? Whereever you are Mr. Mitchell, you are supposed to be giving your aunt's original masterpiece some diginty. But then you take to court ""The Wind Done Gone""? What are you thinking? Sorry, for those of you who know, for those who don't, I am not crazy. I digress! Even besides the sagging and unrealistic, and untrue to the characters plot, the casting, music, production values,(virtually everything the original paid such close attention to), fall flat. The leading lady does not embody the essence of the character she is portraying, and I can not help being disstracted by her un-period hair ( come on teased bangs in the 1870's?) and severe lack of fashion sense. Scarlett O'Hara wouldn't have been caught dead in some of those thrift store looking, we rented these from a high school drama department, sad excuses for costumes.  Walter Plunkett, you are a costume god! And could somebody have please popped in some green contacts for that woman! Some say Vivien Leighs eyes were blue, but hey it was 1939, they didn't have contacts then, and to tell you the truth I have seen the original probally at least 50 times and I have always thought they were green, at least they appear green most of the time. Hey, they gave Madonna contacts ( and capped teeth, which this Scarlett could have used as well )in Evita! Anyway, the lack of very important details, took away from anything positive this movie could have possessed. Did the producers even see the original? I blame them for really screwing up what could have been something great. Margaret Mitchell and David O'Selznick are rolling over in their graves.

Let's just leave it where Rhett left Scarlett at the door saying, ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.""  It's kept audiences guessing for over 60 years, and the magic of GWTW never faded.

But as the movie kept on going, its story line drifted further and further away from the book's. I don't want to spoil the 'experience' for people who were lucky enough not to see this movie yet, but let's just say that the only things in common the book's ending and the movie's ending are the fact that Scarlett is in danger, and Rhett saves her.

I must say the costumes in this movie were nice but the ones in the origional were spectacular. I suppose, though, that many times scarlett mentioned she felt she wasn't dressed appropriately, so that might have been the reason.

Fenton was too brutal, his character of the book never even peeped out, and his hair was supposed to be raven, like Rhett's.  Dalton played a spectacularly dashing Rhett, but a lot of his character was lost with the leaving out of the Landing, which disappointed me.  Scarlett was played impeccibly, but her character never grew up, never lost the vain self-centeredness that she so proudly shed in the book.  Also, Scarlett's success in Anglo society without Fenton left the plot lacking.  As did the abrupt ending, it left Scarlett with a tainted reputation and Scarlett and Rhett's reuniting dead.

The movie was also wonderful, and so I looked forward eagerly to seeing Scarlett, the movie.  I just couldn't believe what I was seeing when I watched it.  Having read Alexandra Ripley's wonderful book, and loving the way Scarlett changed and grew up in a very satisfying manner, I was nothing short of appalled and the butchery  committed in this dreadful piece of grotty trash.
It left me wondering, did anyone involved in this film actually read the book?  Either Scarlett or GWTW?  Or even see the movie of GWTW?  This was such an enormous departure from the characters of Scarlett and Rhett that by the time it ended I was squirming in my seat with discomfort and horror.
The first half was at least nice to look at, the scenery and the costumes etc, while one cringed at the dreadful dialogue and less than adequate acting of JWK and TD.  The second half however had me groaning out loud the whole way through...  The whole descent of the story from a voyage of self discovery, personal growth and reunion with a lost love to a tawdry filthy tale of rape and murder, terribly written, overacted and insulting not only to the characters of the books, but to both Alexandra Ripley and Margaret Mitchell.  If I had not known this was supposed to be Scarlett and Rhett, I would have thought it the worst kind of soapy sensationalist garbage and not fit to waste hours of my life viewing.  The peripheral characters got scanty attention at best, and completely and horribly rewritten at worst....  Fenton, a sadistic rapist?  Colum, Scarlett's cousin, in love with her?  Suellen and Scarlett best buds?  Sally Brewton a tall blonde gorgeous woman?

I was so very disappointed when I watched this movie, I stopped five times so I could calm down. It is so far off-base compared to the book, which in my opinion, made a better story and didn't sensationalize ANYTHING to the degree that this movie did. The relationship that Scarlett develops with her Irish family is underdeveloped, the relationship with Rhett is underplayed while she is in Ireland, and she comes across as a cold hearted witch.
I was excited when I first bought the movie, remembering the book I had read by Alexandra Ripley and I couldn't wait to watch the screen version. The entire movie is glossed over! It departs drastically from the book and leaves out so much. It turns Scarlett into a potential murderer, the victim a man who wasn't nearly so evil as he was portrayed in this horror flick.
If you want to see what would really happen to Scarlett, read the book. I think it comes much closer to what would have been reality, and what Margaret Mitchell would have done with the story, had she chosen to. I wondered as I watched the movie if Ms. Ripley had been shocked and disappointed as I had when I watched, and whether Ms. Mitchell was spinning in her grave.

""Scarlett"" is a lavish, epic film that ties up all the loose strings left by ""Gone With the Wind"", and while not combining all the original elements of ""GWTW"" and indeed a long film, it is an extremely entertaining and engrossing film. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer is excellent as the tempestuous post-Vivien Leigh Scarlett O'Hara Butler, bringing a freshness and originality to the role so unique that she succeeds in diminishing Leigh's emblazonment on the role. Timothy Dalton is excellent in his Clark Gable-follow-up to Rhett Butler, bringing a deep sense of humanity to the role lacking in Gable's performance. The story picks up right where ""GWTW"" left off, and we finally get to know what happened to Scarlett and Rhett. Through this engrossing tale, Scarlett sets out to seek Rhett's love again, make peace with her past haunts, and discover her true identity. Her journey takes her from Atlanta to Charleston to Ireland and beyond before she can succeed in winning back the man she always loved. All the other memorable characters are back too: Ashley Wilkes, Mammy, Aunt Pittypat, Suellen and Will, just to name a few. And there are some new faces, as well: Jean Smart is immensely likable as Sally Brewten, a wily friend of the Butlers with a heart of gold. Colm Meaney is great in his role of Colum O'Hara, Scarlett's Irish cousin. And Ann-Margret makes a memorable cameo as Atlanta's leading madam, Belle Watling, along with Esther Rolle in the part of Mammy.

835486,5,6304274742,"If you were as curious as I was about what happened between Rhet and Scarlett then this is a great movie.  It is a little different than the book, but it is still good.  If you have not read the book then you are in  for a real treat because the story will make you want to keep on watching  it(even if it is really long).",963187200,2,322,3.8333333333333335
835487,3,6304274742,"I have read both GWTW and Scarlett many times.  I would not say that this movie stayed with the book at all, but Timothy Dalton and Whalley-Kilmer both did excellent jobs of following in legendary footsteps (Gable and  Leigh).  You have to remember that movies are not books and the time that  it would have taken to fit the book of Scarlett into a movie would never  have worked.  The important thing is that the ending is basically the same.  If you have some sort of strange attachment to the book Scarlett then this  is not a movie for you, but if you can recognize good work without  comparing it to the book, you will enjoy Scarlett the movie.",957312000,2,649,4.38655462184874
835488,1,6304274742,"I don't even know where to begin about the butchering of Alexandra Ripley's amazing sequel to GWTW.  After reading the book, I was thoroughly horrified by the deviations from the book that the directors took.  Why  bother to say the movie was based on the book when in reality it wasn't?  Apparently the directors did not read GWTW either; as IF Scarlett would  ever forgive Suellen or come to like her!  This is a movie that would have  been better left un-made rather than expose the rest of us to such a shoddy  representation of a masterpiece.  No one could possibly ever follow up the  acting of Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable because they have burned permanent  pictures of what ""Scarlett and Rhett"" should look and act like  into our minds.  Scarlett in the new movie didn't even have green eyes, for  God's sake; in both books, her eyes were discussed at length and their  significance was noteworthy.
I have never been more disappointed in a  movie based on a book (except for ""A Civil Action,"" but that's  another story).  It's movies like this that ruin people's opinions of a  book, leading them to never read that book at all.  I think the majority of  people who actually liked this hideous version of Ripley's sequel have  never read GWTW or Scarlett, and have only seen the movies.  Both GWTW and  Scarlett are meant to be READ anyway; the depth of the characters can never  be conveyed onto a big screen with such a short amount of time!  The  history behind their families - Scarlett's mother and father and their  intricate lives that explain how Scarlett came to be who she was,  Scarlett's cousins and the Irish uprising, etc. - are lost in the  translation to the big screen.  At least, however, in GWTW the directors  stayed basically true to the story and left viewers with an accurate  portrayal of the book.
If I were Alexandra Ripley, I would change my name  and live incognito the rest of my life, rather than face the shame of what  those directors and actors did to my fantastic story and meticulous  research.
Trust me - if you are a true GWTW fan, just read  ""Scarlett.""  Don't even bother with this movie or you will fume  just like I am doing!  If you are the type of person who enjoys  soap-operatic displays that are totally unrealistic, and you have never  read either book, then you might enjoy this movie because you won't have  the initial bias.  But please rest assured that this movie is nothing like  the book and is indeed a very poor imitation/reflection upon it.",955584000,73,2506,4.570135746606335
835489,1,6304274742,"I was expecting a deviation from the book Scarlett, but never in my wildest thoughts did I ever imagine that the movie would be as altered from the book as it was.  And it wasn't changed for the better.  if it was just  the plot maybe I wouldn't be so mad, but I feel that the characters were  also changed in very drastic ways.  i cannot believe how much they  butchered a very enjoyable book.",950918400,3,394,4.1866666666666665
835490,5,6304274742,"Scarlett is a wonderful movie with all the romance and dreams of Gone with the Wind. Although a bit longer than the prequil, it shines as one of the most outstanding dramas ever made. Scarlett delivers to those of you who were hoping for a better end to Gone with the Wind. Scarlett continues to share her triumphs and loses, but copes with them as she always has. ""Tomorrow is another day,"" becomes the theme as Scarlett battles for her lost love, and regains her self confidence. This movie is based on Scarlett, the book by Alexandra Ripely, which I also strongly recommend (see my review there).",948672000,3,599,4.607476635514018

835544,5,6304274742,"I found Scarlett to be brilliant,vivid,and passionately captivating. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton did their predeccesors well...I found Joanne's portrayal of the ever entrancing Scarlett accurate,and far  more interesting than Vivien Leigh's. She added scope and passion to  Leigh's often cold and distant heroine...I applaud her. Timothy Dalton  truly amazed me...he was as good,if not better, than Gable. To those who  dislike Scarlett,I honestly cannot understand. Perhaps they are comparing  it to GWTW...and it isn't the same...no two films ever are. But it  does,without a doubt, quench the viewers thirst and finally and brilliantly  answers what we all have been asking since GWTW debuted...What happened to  Scarlett and Rhett? Watch,and enjoy.

835545,1,6304274742,This movie and book should never have been a sequal to Gone With The Wind as it was not in the same class as GWTW. The acting in Scarlet was just tolerable and the theme was totally unrealitic.  Scarlet rates in my  opinion right along side any Harliquen romance novel on the market today.  But had no business as a sequal to Gone with the Wind.,922665600,2,345,4.196969696969697

7867051,3,6304274742,"I can only give this 3 stars.  It is a good movie but some of the scenes don't ring true.  Ashley Wilkes would never have been at a costume ball shortly after Melanie's death.  Mourning for a spouse went on for at least a year.  Scarlett would never have gone up to Ashley's hotel room.  She had done many things wrong in her life, but she still clung to some Southern standards and Eleanor Butler would never have kicked her out of the house.  Colum's clerical collar is wrong for the Catholic church.  The collar they have him wearing is for Episcopal or Lutheran ministers.  Catholic priests have a block collar with just a white insert.",1524528000,,640,4.456896551724138
