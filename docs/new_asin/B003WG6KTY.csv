The ONLY training this would be good for, is with a sense of humor, getting the giggles in for the day. Everything in the infomercial was sad--we watched it until the end just to laugh at how inadequate and pathetic the ""training"" videos are--and by the way, they also sell a workout CD--of factory ringtones playing...yikes.",1441324800,,415,4.777777777777778

8407327,5,B003WG6KTY,"I highly recommend this video if you carry pepper spray or MACE. I would guess about 99% of people who carry pepper spray never practice with it or know how to effectively employ it. This DVD teaches you how. You'll learn how to use it at different distances, including very close up. It also teaches the different spraying techniques when it comes to fog vs. spray. In all, an excellent DVD!",1415145600,,392,4.535211267605634
8407328,5,B003WG6KTY,"I work late nights and have often thought about purchasing pepper spray.  However, I was very wary about using the pepper spray correctly (effectively without injuring myself).  This DVD helped me feel more confident using pepper spray.  The DVD includes the pro/cons to stream vs. cone pepper spray, drawing techniques, stance, how to protect the weapon, etc.  I really liked the demos, real-life scenarios, and drills.  Understanding the drawing and spraying techniques and the range at which to discharge the pepper spray against your assailant helped me fell more comfortable using pepper spray.",1280188800,,599,5.397849462365591
8407329,5,B003WG6KTY,"There is another pepper spray DVD on the market.  However, I will have to check this one out.  The ohter video that I bought only goes over technique.  Sammy takes time to explain what to do.  Also, what not to do. Then he brings out his students to perform the techniques in the form of scenario.  I have been on many martial arts sites that have inructional D V D's. I have not seen any OC spray videos for sale. Also, I have done a search on Amazon.com.  There were no DVD's about this subject.  Then, I checked yahoo.com for videos on pepper spray.  All I found were you tube clips.  He was right in his email he sent.  There is no material on self defense with pepper spray.",1279756800,2,679,4.1937984496124034
