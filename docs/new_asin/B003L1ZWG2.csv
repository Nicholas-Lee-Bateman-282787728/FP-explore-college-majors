4134571,4,B003L1ZWG2,"This movie was fairly entertaining, more than I hoped for (expected it to be pretty terrible). It has the cliche young college idiots who only care about smoking weed, etc. Their dialogue was often annoying in the beginning and barely has you paying attention. But once they get stuck up there, the challenge of getting down or staying there for 5 days is quite frightening. There were also some grotesque scenes that I haven't seen in other movies. Watch for the shock factor, but don't have ridiculous expectations. The only thing that bothered me was the lack of mist in their breath from the cold!! It was a pretty enjoyable film. Since the DVD is so cheap it's worth getting for me and the movie has replay value.",1285545600,4,718,4.6171875
4134572,3,B003L1ZWG2,"FROZEN is a film that doesn't fall easily into any particular category. With director/writer Adam Green's previous films some will say it's a horror story. Others will note that it seems more like a thriller. But this movie falls into a category all its own, one that touches on elements of both yet doesn't completely take on either.

Kevin Zegers and Shawn Ashmore play Dan Walker and Joe Lynch, two best friends since childhood who are now college students. This particular weekend finds them on a skiing trip with Dan's girlfriend Parker O'Neill (Emma Bell). The three are about to hit the slopes and hopefully along the way, become better friends. To date, Joe and Parker seem to be vying more for Dan's attention, now its time to develop friendship.

The day starts with the group trying to con the lift operator to give them lift tickets on the sly for far less than they normally costs. Cash in hand, Parker talks him into it and the three head to the snow covered mountain. Taking the bunny slopes (since Parker is still in the learning phase) they have some fun but eventually Joe and Dan (more experienced skiers) want to take on the regular course. Parker volunteers to wait for them but Dan wants her along.

With a bad storm on the way, the lift and mountain are in the midst of closing. But the three convince Jason, the lift operator, to let them go up for one last run. They are the last on the lift. A set of inconvenient circumstances results in a change of operators on their way up and the lift is shut down with them midway up the mountain, sitting in the lift high above ground. No one knows they are there. The cold is coming. And no one can hear their calls for help.

The movie crawls along in stages as the three go from feeling it's a quick mistake or malfunction that will soon be solved to realizing the only people who can save them is themselves. Sitting on the bench, bombarded at first by the hail storm that arrives, they talk anything to keep themselves from worrying about their situation. They eventually discuss solutions from climbing the cable (which is razor sharp) to dropping down and hoping for the best.

Eventually Dan makes the decision to drop and go for help. But it's much further down than they realize. Will he make it? Or will he do more damage than good? And is there more in the woods than they realize?

The movie is less about special effects and whiz bang storytelling and more a character study between the three people we see on screen for almost the entire film. Each one has their own reasons for being here, though they might not really be apparent. Each one has hopes and dreams. Each one is young and thinking about the future. But with every moment stuck on the lift in the freezing storm they each, along with you the viewer, worry that their future may never come.

This is a movie for actors. And while the Ashmore, Zegers and O'Neill might not be mega stars, this film can only add positive notes to their resumes. Director Green made the right choice in not using name recognized stars because their celebrity status would have taken over instead of their performances. With these three he brings out emotions and plays with them, giving you the chance to feel for them rather than recognize them.

Given that the film takes place on a lift in the middle of a storm, there are some painful moments as well. Frostbite has rarely looked so real and harmful as it does in this movie. There are small moments where you not only feel the emotional pain but the physical as well.

The pacing of the movie is slow but that's on purpose. This is not about gunplay or car chases. This is about isolation, desperation, hope and possibly surrendering to the elements. It runs the gamut from the best to the worst in human experience. But it isn't boring. In fact the only reason you might press fast forward on the remote isn't to move the story along but to avoid sense of unease as it progresses.

One thing is certain after watching FROZEN. You'll never want to convince a lift operator to let you make just one more run. And chances are you'll make sure you have plenty of warm items packed away in your car just in case something happens during the cold winter months.",1285459200,3,4234,4.494148244473342
4134573,2,B003L1ZWG2,"As it's been mentioned already, this is movie is exactly like Open Water, but on land and with wolves instead of sharks.  The movie could have worked as a land adaption of Open Water, but it starts off in the most off-putting way possible -- it has the typical, cliche obnoxious 20-something character types that NO ONE ever cares about and therefore makes you almost want to root for their demise.  This is yet another movie I had to edit via the FF on the remote because there's just so much boring, uninteresting dialog from characters that are stereotypes.

The film does strike a chord for me though, because I grew up snow skiing and occasionally the lift will stop to accommodate someone having a hard time getting on or off, and almost every time that happens, I can't help but think of the ""What if there's no way off but to jump"" scenario.  Although I can't ever recall worrying about wolves waiting for me on the ground.

And come on, out of the 3 of them, none of them had their cell phone with them?",1285459200,18,1012,4.419354838709677
4134574,3,B003L1ZWG2,"I received an advance copy of ""Frozen"" from the distributor for the website I write reviews for.

I'll be brief here: The movie is good with some caveats.  Adam Green both writes and directs, and his direction is better than his writing.

He definitely keeps the suspense going through several key scenes, so I'd give it a B to B+ for directing.

However, the script needed to be better.  As I said in my full review at the website, there are too many coincidences that strain plausibility.  Once you get to the part where the kids are stranded for good on the ski lift, it's fine, but getting them there took too many worst case scenarios for it to be totally believable.

Another draft of the script might have kicked my rating up a star.  Definitely worthwhile as a rental, but only consider purchasing because the price is so low now.  If you're still on the fence after reading this and my full review, just rent it.",1285372800,2,921,4.467065868263473
4134575,4,B003L1ZWG2,Very tense with some slow bits but this helped slow my heart rate back down! I was surprised that I enjoyed this as much as I did.,1285286400,,130,3.8518518518518516
4134576,4,B003L1ZWG2,"First, for an independent movie, I was very impressed with the quality. Scenery was great, the shots were great, the directing was great.

This is a survival movie, about 3 young people stuck on a ski lift. It was suspenseful, somewhat plausible, and I hope to see more of this director & cast.

There were some problems. First, the emotional scenes (the ""confessions"", the romance back-story, etc) were not good. The acting wasn't up to par. I was bored during those moments, & never cared about the development of the characters as much as the development of the plot.

And, there was SO MUCH they could have done with the plot, and they dropped the ball a little here. ---SOME MINOR SPOILERS BELOW--

There are many survival aspects that were ignored here (not knowing exactly where this happened). First, the extreme cold, which came into play ... but during the day, they were exposed to enough sun at high altitudes to get a major dose of radiation poisoning & dehydration.

Also, the snow seemed really groomed & packed, which didn't seem plausible at all, especially under a remote chair lift in a remote area of the park. I was expecting to see 6-8 feet of powder, and it should have been difficult to stand up in it (especially if they had thrown off their skis & snowboard).

And, as some reviewers have mentioned, the use of ravenous wolves was kindof a cop-out and stood out as the most unrealistic part of the plot. It became very reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Open-Water/dp/B00064AE0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Open Water</a>&nbsp;from a few years ago - which was a decent movie. But both movies devolved into a ""man vs. animal"" instead of a broader, more interesting premise of ""man (or woman) vs. nature"".

Overall, though, I give it a 3.5 stars and would recommend it to someone who likes survival, suspense, or independent movies, especially if you are a skier or snowboarder.",1285200000,,1956,5.037151702786378
4134577,3,B003L1ZWG2,"Three young skiers (Kevin Zegers, Shawn Ashmore and Emma Bell) are trapped on a chairlift, halfway up the mountain. The ski resort will be closed for the next five days, so chances are they have to remain where they are, out in the cold, until the next weekend, by which time they will have been frozen to death; or they have to do something to avoid the fate.

Like ""Open Water,"" a film about two hapless swimmers left alone in the sea, ""Frozen"" is based on a premise that is not exactly implausible. Writer/director Adam Green attempts to create a character-driven, suspense-filled movie based on the premise that I think is too simple for a feature film. In short the story goes nowhere.

For it is obvious that the three stranded skiers have few options to choose, and anyway they take one of them. Occasional gore and grotesque descriptions are not enough to sustain tension for 90 minutes. The three characters' back stories are not very interesting as, after all, we want to know more about what they will do, than what they are.

One great thing about ""Frozen"" is that the filmmakers actually shot the film among the snowy mountains (in Utah). No green screen or soundstage is used, and the on-location shots give the film an authentic look and feel. Otherwise, the film is average with its scenario that heavily depends on coincidences and wrong decision making on the part of the characters.",1285113600,2,1401,4.710204081632653
4134578,3,B003L1ZWG2,"Good B movie, with some great acting and some pretty good emotional factors. I'm not much of a skier myself but you do have to wonder how much attention people would get if they did ""happen"" to get stuck on one, which is the reason this movie isn't very realistic. I live in WV and never once has there ever been a story of someone getting stuck on a ski lift, pretty much in the history of the state. Even at the places we have here Snowshoe and Wisp, they always check and double or triple check and do up keep all year around to maintain everything and make sure no one is or would be stranded. All that aside the idea is clever, and its pleasant to watch. The falling, frost bite, climbing on the sharp cables are all very accurate and plausible, so you could really see yourself in the situation of doing what the kids do to try and survive. And the level of panic and emotion is set very well within the circumstances, so thumbs up for that. The one thing i hated about this movie is the wolves. Rarely do they hang around were people thrive, let alone a ski resort, or if they did they are very afraid of humans and would run at the site of you. Basically like a shark to blood they have the wolves come out after a minute or so when the first person is on the ground, due to the scent of blood. No. Not to give to much away but i think maybe they should have thought of something a little better than getting eaten by wolves, but it does add to the horror. So its not a bad movie, and not a great one, its just there. The music is very emotional for a survival picture and you can relate to how the final person is feeling when staring death in the face. And though its not the ending i wanted or expected its better than i thought.

Next time leave out the wolves who wouldnt come near you, especially to rip you apart and eat your entrails. lol",1284422400,5,1854,4.107438016528926
4134579,4,B003L1ZWG2,"We've seen so many thrillers in which the threat comes from something unnatural, be it a ghost, a zombie, or a masked serial killer that cannot himself be killed. This is partly why ""Frozen"" is such a refreshing experience - nature itself is the threat. Human beings are capable of withstanding a great deal, but there's always a breaking point, and this movie does a pretty good job of searching for it. It begs the question: What would you do if you found yourself in a similar situation? Is there anything that could be done? Or is it merely a matter of waiting to die? For something that very easily could have been a mindless shock fest, ""Frozen"" is instead an effective story where suspense builds from a fairly plausible situation.

As far as the plot is concerned, there isn't all that much to describe. In fact, it can all be summed up in one sentence: At a mountain resort, three college kids struggle to survive when they're left stranded on a ski lift. Everything depends on how the plot advances, and this includes character development, which is surprisingly strong. Dan (Kevin Zegers) and Lynch (Shawn Ashmore) have been friends since the first grade. Because of Dan's new girlfriend, Parker (Emma Bell), Lynch now feels that their friendship is in jeopardy; their skiing trips have traditionally been a Guys Only thing, and yet here she is, tagging along. For the first twenty minutes or so, Lynch repeatedly tells Parker, as nicely as possible, that she's in the way.

Hoping to get in one last hill before the ski lift closes for the night, the three smooth-talk their way onto the ski lift. Unfortunately, there are two lift operators, and the second one doesn't realize that the three skiers who have just descended are not the same three currently ascending the mountain. The lift is subsequently switched off. Dangling above a snowy slope on a bleak winter night, Dan, Lynch, and Parker remember, with horrific clarity, that the resort will remain closed for an entire week.

You can probably imagine what they now must face. Obviously, the cold, which quickly leads to frostbite in spite of their warm clothing. There's also the heat of the midday sun, which will probably lead to sunburn. And that howling off in the distance? I can assure you that it isn't coming from rescue dogs. So what can Dan, Lynch, and Parker do? Shout for help? Try to pull themselves across the sharp wire carrying the suspended chairs? Jump off and hope they don't break their legs? Throw their ski equipment to get someone's attention? Lose control altogether? Take your pick. No matter what they decide to do, it sure as hell won't be easy.

Had the characters not been properly developed, there would be no conceivable way to successfully make this last for just over ninety minutes. Writer/director Adam Green, who had previously directed the slasher homage ""Hatchet,"" goes in the right direction by giving each of the three leads some well worded dialogue, most of which focuses on memories and primal emotional outbursts. There are some good moments between Parker and Lynch, who eventually understand that hating one another will get them nowhere. One of the best scenes shows Parker tearfully panicking over the fate of her new puppy, who was left alone in her apartment. Stupid, you say? What would you think about if you were in her place? Exactly.

If there is a weakness to ""Frozen,"" it's that some of the suspense is wasted on scenes of overbearing makeup effects, which I can't describe for fear of spoiling the plot. What I will say is that movies like this work so much better when it relies on psychological horror; the idea of falling off, of freezing, of being attacked, of losing your balance, etc. is always more effective than seeing it. Of course, there would be no resolution if nothing physical happened, so maybe it's a moot point. Regardless, I felt the human scenes were stronger than the action scenes, where the characters were reduced to little more than infernal screamers.

The long and short of it is that ""Frozen"" is better than I thought it was going to be. In an age when horror movies are about little more than young people dying elaborate deaths, I realized that I actually cared about these skiers and what was happening to them. While it occasionally falls victim to conventional thriller tactics, it still tries for something more, getting under your skin not through visuals so much as through the overall situation. The idea of being left alone in a hostile environment with no resources is genuinely frightening. The idea of zombies eating your brains? Fun, maybe, but certainly not frightening. There's no chance of that happening in real life, despite Max Brooks' evidence to the contrary.",1266796800,114,4739,4.815724815724816

Some things were unrealistic, such as how they didn't use common sense to keep warm.  And the wolves were a bit much.  But that's part of the fun, I guess.  I'm not one for gore and splatter movies, so this was more believable as a potential Hitchcockian situation and to me more compelling that way.  You have to not be bored by watching the same scene setup for most of the movie.  In a lot of ways, it's more of an internal emotional movie:  what would you do if abandoned in a ski lift chair, at a great height, for a week in the freezing cold?  The Special Features will tell you that all the scenes were done realistically in the actual freezing cold on a ski lift on a Utah mountainside.

Too many flaws regarding basic human anatomy and it's response to outside stressors for me to get too into the movie.

4134842,2,B003L1ZWG2,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of Frozen released by Anchor Bay in 2010.

As a fan of Adam Green's 'Holliston' series I was expecting a lot more from this movie. I was very disappointed and feel let down after having higher hopes. I absolutely loved the 'Holliston' sitcom and am hoping for more seasons in the future. But this review is for 'Frozen.' I guess what drew me to the sitcom was the comedy. 'Frozen' does have a bit of comedy in the beginning but this is strictly a horror movie.

The premise of the movie is that a group of 3 friends (1 female and 2 males) get accidentally stuck on a ski lift when it closes down for the night. Actually it will be closed till the following weekend. They are located somewhere in New England. Upon learning the premise of the movie, I wondered what plot lines would follow. I could only really think of two possibilities for things to do. They could either jump down or climb up and over to the tower. I wasn't quite sure what else could lead to drama. Perhaps some bad guys come along and do all kinds of nasty things to them? Anyway.....essentially that's really all there is to the movie, albeit with wolves thrown in.
I don't think this movie was well thought out at all. What you get is your typical horror movie 'complete idiot' behavior. For my complaints see spoilers below.

Usually when I do reviews I sound much more pessimistic than I really am. That's because I like to start with the premise that a movie is excellent and give it the benefit of the doubt from the get go. Then I start subtracting for the bad stuff. The problem with this movie is that almost all of the scenes are either unrealistic or just not executed well.

***Spoilers Below***

Right from the get go there are some serious problems with the plot.
-Joe goes over to help a pretty girl who has fallen. Immediately they start flirting. The girl's boyfriend gets upset and Joe and the girl seem to be stunned that he is actually mad. She yells at her boyfriend and Joe goes off disgusted as if the boyfriend is nuts. Right......a guy goes skiing with his girlfriend and when she starts hitting on another guy he is crazy for being upset.....got it....
- Going on a skiing trip where nobody has money seems a bit of a weak premise, despite the weak explanation for it.
- The most simple, logical and obvious thing to do when getting stuck on the lift....they never think to try. That is yell like hell!!! Up in the mountains and high up your voice could carry for miles. In the still of the night, there is a very good chance that somebody would walk outside and hear you. Especially given the fact that there is bound to be a caretaker and groundskeeper around at some point every day. In fact a guy drives by in a snow vehicle but they are not able to get his attention. He would have to exit out of the vehicle at some point and he would hear them. But nope yelling would be logical and this is a horror movie so 'no being logical allowed.'
- Dan decides to leap and try to get help. The are at least 20 feet up and maybe more. Dan and his girlfriend, Parker look as if they are practically engaged. At the very least Joe should have been the one to leap since he was the single guy. Realistically Parker would have been the one with the best shot since she was the lightest and would have stood the best chance. But hey that would not have been the chivalrous thing to do even if we are in an age where women claim to be equal to men in every regard. Anyway, going this route first seemed idiotic. Why not try to go up and work your way over to the tower first? Because it's a horror movie, that's why.
- Aside from the fact that Dan's legs break in an unbelievable way, the acting afterward was terrible. Dan seemed to go back and forth between hysterical and perfectly logical. While it's perfectly logical to assume that Dan would break his ankles, I doubt that it would have been as horrific as they made it look from that height, especially landing on deep snow even if it is packed down. At times, the bones sticking up actually looked comical which took away from the horror of the moment.
- This might be nitpicking but A pack of wolves showing up almost immediately? in a populated area in New England? Now I'm sure there are some scattered wolves floating around the country. But I doubt very much that there would be a pack of hyper aggressive wolves in a populated area. These wolves showed no fear and attacked immediately with no caution. Even when there was only one wolf it attacked fearlessly. These scenes just did not look very convincing at all. I understand them attacking a badly injured Dan but Joe would have to be an idiot to get caught. Why not just climb back on to the ladder rather than run away if they were that aggressive?
- Ok, it's cold enough for frostbite. So don't you think it's a good idea to try to cover you face up better? How about some body heat. You know get close to one another. Joe and Parker act as if they have leprosy and stay on opposite sides of the lift. After Parker loses one of her gloves, you'd think she might have the intelligence to cover up her hand or pull her arm inside her jacket....but noooooo.....let's just leave it out and get frostbite.

***End of Spoilers***

Overall, I'm giving it two stars which really should be 1 1/2 or even 1. But I hate to give 1 star unless something is truly awful and I have seen a lot worse. So I'm giving it two stars or lets call it 3.5/10.
Perhaps I'm being more pessimistic than necessary, especially in light of the fact that there are plenty of positive reviews for this movie. A friend had told me that it was very scary and I had high hopes which weren't met. Just my two cents.",1499558400,,5726,4.325884543761639

At least others are creative enough to jump sharks. This writer just sat in a chair lift, probably high, and thought ""what if i bribed this guy to let me ski after dark, then he forgets about me and i have to jump off the lift but break my legs and no one is here to save my stupid ass so the wolves eat me alive.""  whoops scratch that, lets make the girlfriend bribe the guy in the lamest way possible.

4134853,5,B003L1ZWG2,"You don't have to be a skier to imagine how scary it would be to get stuck on a lift, in the bitter cold, for almost a week. Thats the dilemma the three protagonists in this Stephen King styled story face. Its a girlfriend-boyfriend couple, Parker and Dan, along with Dans third wheel best friend. Their decision to ride the lift one last time, despite the resort closing early due to an on-coming snow storm, becomes their doom.

Youd think theyd use their hats and hoods to protect their faces from the wind. Youd think the owners of a public ski resort wouldve long ago done something about their killer wolf infestation. Those are two major plausibility faults in a story thats otherwise terrifically realistic. The tension heads high about a quarter of the way in and only gives way to moments of desolation. The death scene near the middle is especially poignant.

4134875,5,B003L1ZWG2,"I think I've probably watched this movie at least five times before I decided to finally break down and buy it to add to my collection. You should be aware that this is not the same ""Frozen"" as the children's movie with the same title. The movie starts off a little slow, you have 3 friends taking a chairlift ride to ski and then things go awry when the chairlift stops halfway up the snowy Peak because they were never counted as legit passengers to begin with....I guess you could say they kind of bribed their way into the seats to begin with, which turned out to be a really bad idea.

It ended up costing them dearly in the end. I'm not going to give away spoilers but I will say that this has suspense, an element of surprise,  a little bit of drama  between the three friends and you have some gore so be aware of that as well. Overall I really enjoyed this movie. I watched it when it first came out on DVD and loved it so much....that is what prompted me to purchase it here on Amazon.",1483488000,7,995,4.171875

4134880,4,B003L1ZWG2,"Unless you think of yourself as a highbrow intellectual (yawn), I'd ignore much of what the critics said about this surprisingly entertaining indie film. My strongest disagreement with their reviews was in regards to the acting. While a few of the minor characters were on the amateurish side, this film very much focuses on the 3 main characters and the main cast does a perfectly good job of convincing us of their panic, fear,  and individual vulnerabilities in contrast to their initial confidence. Your best bet is to watch it knowing as little as possible - as we did - so that you can enjoy the feeling of surprise youll likely feel about halfway through the film. The 2nd half is definitely where the action is, and some of the first half dialogue could use some editing, but I'd just go with it. It's only an hour and a half long as it is. I'd recommend pausing after the predicament begins and asking each other what you'd each do in that situation because really, it seems possible that much of this story could really have happened - assuming they had left their cell phones in the lodge lockers.",1482796800,9,1108,4.595959595959596

4134896,3,B003L1ZWG2,"Plausible, fairly realistic film about a ski lift mishap due to a lift operator misunderstanding how many skiiers still left on the mountain on a night before the ski mountain closes for four days. This is the same premise basically as Open Water. Definitely a suspenseful movie, but it's formulaic, also: the slow beginning intentionally allows for you to connect with the characters so you can feel for them when the mishap occurs. A few little flaws here and there, like snow obviously tread on to the dirt/mud below from the film crew below the lift where the skiiers are stranded, but nothing major. The main thing that bugged me about the film is it was shot on some kind of film stock with a weird look, like the film that tv shows from the 80s were filmed on. So even though it's contemporary (2011), it looks like a film from the early 90s or late 80s. Also, maybe it's the piano music, but there is something very after school special about this movie, in the way it told the story, characters, etc. It's like a nightmarish after school special about the horrors of what can happen when you go skiing. But overall a worthwhile ride, in its tragic plausability and the horror of nature and things going wrong due to a combination of circumstances. It tries to do the resilient/strong woman thing like many horror and horror sci-fi films, but it doesn't really succeed, because the female ends up resilient not really from being resilient but by circumstance and chance. In other words, she has certain advantages because of the work that others around her do. Either way, it's a realistic movie, and there's one scene that's done very well that is very cringe-worthy. I'm not sure that its portrayal of wolves is totally accurate, though probably more realistic than, say, The Grey. Nonetheless, if you want realism and non-supernatural/non-killer horror, this is your movie.",1475107200,,1884,4.782208588957055

4134999,4,B003L1ZWG2,"From 2010 this film is about three friends who want to enjoy some winter sports at Mount Holliston. The three blag their way onto the slopes by bribing the guard  so they are not on the official manifests. After some not so great fun they decide to go up one last time before the slope closes for the week  this being a weekend only slope.

However, their guard is called away and the new guy thinks everyone is down from the mountain and shuts down the power. This leaves our three friends stranded on a ski lift with no way of getting help. What follows is how they deal with their life threatening predicament.

Now this was a film I was not expecting a lot from, however, once it got into its stride I was well and truly hooked. That is quite some achievement for a film which has basically three characters all stuck on a chair lift. The twists are not the stars here but the actual tension itself that keeps the momentum right to the end  this is one I can recommend and you may think twice about going snowboarding again.",1454976000,,1028,4.305699481865285

The actions the kids take and the reactions are what you can imagine the kids would act on. I cried through most of it especially when things began to get worse (as they always do in movies). It really gives you in-depth characterization on all three kids and you can just see yourself or someone you know in their position.

4135173,2,B003L1ZWG2,"Yes, some college kids are dumb but Frozen portrayal is just overboard in my opinion.

Frozen is starts with three friends waiting for their favorite ski lift operator but are soon disappointed and have to bribe their way on to the left.
Later in the day they try for one last run before leaving and in doing so seal their fate when their left is shutdown before they get to the top.

Since the majority of the movie takes place in one place the primary factor of the film is the acting and that is where is fails. The actors are cast well since they're young but because of their inexperience their acting is average at best and lead to a less suspenseful viewing.
The music is par for a teen thriller and some times seem a little forced with the mix of dramatic and sympathetic music.

Frozen isn't the worst thriller ever but not the best. I would only suggest watching with friends and trying to MS3K it while watching.",1434067200,,923,4.385964912280702

4135233,5,B003L1ZWG2,"If it's lonely at the top, imagine how it feels to be hanging 50 feet above, with no way down.

Lynch, Dan, and Dan's girlfriend, Parker, have spent the day skiing.  Or at least, that was the original plan except Parker doesn't know how to ski, and thus requires Dan's constant attention.  Meanwhile, Lynch, Dan's best friend since the first grade, makes no secret over his displeasure at what he considers a wasted day due to Parker's consuming most of Dan's time.

As they prepare to leave the mountain, Parker, feeling guilty over ruining the day for Lynch, manages to cajole the ski lift operator into letting her, Dan and Lynch have one last run down the mountain even though it's officially closing time. The three companions, gleeful over their little victory, exchange good-natured banter as the lift creaks and groans its way up the mountain.

When the clanging of the cables abruptly stops, the trio are left suspended in their chairlift 50 feet above the slopes.  The ski lift operator has forgotten about them, an awareness made worse each time their screams for help go unanswered.  Not one of the three has remembered to bring a cell phone, but this is a movie, remember?

As the consequences of their predicament become apparent, one icy degree after another, panic ensues, beginning with Parker who, in near hysterics, remembers that the resort won't reopen for another week, her dog is home alone, and she hadn't thought it necessary to tell anyone of her plans to go skiing that day

Evidently, the idea of letting someone know where they'd be going that day had escaped Dan and Lynch, as well.

The jarring implications of the situation ultimately compel the two friends to take desperate, if ill-advised, measures in their attempts to free Parker and themselves from a dire fate.

The brilliance of this film is not found in action scenes or through special effects. ""Frozen"" hews its artistry by allowing the subtle elements of nature to speak for themselves.  It creates a chilling scenario of possibilities regarding what might happen when people take nature - or even each other - for granted.

4135412,2,B003L1ZWG2,"No, not that Frozen, however this Frozen was also critically acclaimed, as one of the best Horror films of 2010. After seeing that it begs the question, were we watching the same movie? 2010's Frozen takes place at a ski resort, where three very unlucky skiers are stranded on a chair lift. Somehow, none of the cameras picked them up and none of the employees at the ski resort realized there were people stuck on their insanely high chair lift. There really isn't a whole lot you can do in a setting like this, so pretty much everything you'd expect to happen, does happen, with little in between. The setting is creepy and I'm sure that getting stuck on a ski lift is someone's worst nightmare, but a whole film just based on that? After the character introductions, this film turns into an hour of talking, with the occasional really bad idea thrown in, and that's it. The Following's Shawn Ashmore stars and he was alright, it's really hard to judge a performance when all the people do is sit in a chair and talk. I honestly don't know what the critics liked about this film and what prompted them to give it such a high rating, because unless you like watching people sitting around in a chair and talking, this film really has nothing going for it. Frozen is painfully slow and worse than that, it's predictable. If I haven't learned by now to ignore my fellow critics and just watch the films that interest me, I probably never will, but please take it from me, Frozen is a film that you can absolutely do without.",1416873600,,1523,4.501805054151625

The friends decide to slip past the chair lift operator and get in one last run down before the day ends and then sets up a really fun and suspenseful movie. Suspended high above in freezing temps, the 3 try to brave the elements and some of natures most fierce beasts as they try to make their way down and to freedom.

I got to thinking. I imaged the feeling if the thing shut down, and i remembered and started asking about the movie. since neither my gf. or her mother as we were all hanging out as a family. had ever actually seen it so called ""frozen"" and only could say what was rumored i had to find out what this movie was. it was actually pretty hard to find as i can see so many negative reviews and decided it wasn't much of a popular movie but i was still intrigued. going into this movie i was doubtful and wished i hadn't bought it. but after starting it, and going at it with kinda of a negative/sceptic vibe, i was amazed. I have no idea what some of this lame reviews were biased off of. It's scary, hits home, realistic horror ride. being up that high, imaging no one around, it shuts down, it's snowing, no one knows you're up there.. holy hell. my phoebic filled gf and i were antsy to say the least, to get to the ground again. This movie I thought was realistic, and graphic but not overly, just perfect, and actually decent acting. Do not believe some people. I guess i had the better reasoning for a realistic view, since i watched it right after pondering and thiniking overly if i were in the situation, and those wires are super sharp. i touched them. and realizing no bravado could prepare someone for something like that.

4135636,3,B003L1ZWG2,"While I enjoyed Frozen for its intense and gripping story, I also couldn't get past some rather unconvincing elements in the film. The actors are believable, but they do things that seem very abnormal. I will provide a list.

THE CONS
1) It's freezing out and yet the characters are sitting with there faces exposed and even have their coats zipped down to expose their bare necks!? Any normal person would cover as much of their bare skin as possible. A wool hat can be stretched down to cover most of your face and those ski jackets have huge over sized collars that will cover up half of your head. This really took me out of the film as it just seemed very unrealistic.

2) When the plow is right under them they do not react normally. If you believe you're stranded, you thrown things at the window of the plow which is right below you! HELLO! .....not a glove a freakin' ski pole right through the window!

3)Jumping from the Ski lift!? OK... The first thing I thought of was to climb the cable back to the ladder on the support pole. If you were to jump you would at the very least hang down by your hands on the seat or someone's legs, maybe even make some sort of rope from your scarves to make the jump 40 feet instead of 60 feet.

4) When the girl falls asleep, she has her bare hand on the metal bar instead of her gloved hand?

There are more little instances like these that keep this film from being as good as it should have been.

THE PROS
1) Intense moments with fairly solid acting.

2) Solid effects and fast paced story.

****SPOILER ALERT!****

3) People get eaten by wolves!

*****END OF SPOILER*****

I know that it's only a movie and I enjoyed it regardless of its flaws, but if the filmmakers had thought this one out a little better, this could have been one of the most unforgettable thrillers in a long time.

Open Water is a much more believable film and much better too, but if you like these types of films this one is certainly worth checking out.",1399507200,,1980,4.321621621621621

Sure, there are some believablility issues - mainly as to why none of the trapped characters zipped up the coats fully over their faces or pulled down their hats over the exposed skin (like anyonedoes on a cold ski-lift). I've heard folks say ""the lift chairs are put way at night"" - absolutely not, they are hanging their all season at most resorts. Anyway, once the action starts you really feel for the characters, as bad luck piles up shockingly.

As this was the kind of movie that doesn't really ask you to suspend your disbelief, that is, ""this could really happen!"", I struggled with the part about a pack of bloodthirsty man-eating wolves living on a ski resort unnoticed or tolerated. For those of you wolf experts who retort with ""wolves roam,"" I agree, they do. But then I have to believe that:

1) These particular wolves were roaming around Massachusetts and New Hampshire (where you don't see a lot of wolves), and
2) Roamed to this particular ski resort on the last day of the season, once, else at least the tracks of a pack of full-grown wolves would have been noticed as problematic previously, and
3) Were man-eating, and
4) Particularly partial to eating these yummy humans enough to hang around there instead of perusing the dumpsters.
5) Fluffy and photogenic. Man, those were some good-looking wolves!

Gave this 2 stars instead of 1 since at least I got to watch some idiots get eaten by improbable wolves. I'll add a star to any movie with the ""improbable wolf dining on moron"" factor.",1395446400,,1188,4.652380952380953

However, these college kids in ""Frozen"" start out with such vulgar mouths and disrespect toward other people, it is difficult to care what happens to them.  SPOILER ALERT:  Once they are stranded on a ski lift after it is turned off and everybody leaves for a week, they realize the seriousness of their predicament, and their personalities begin to show more compassion.  The film never really focuses or is able to make you FEEL the sheer height of the ski lift, so a lot of the fear is lost.  You DO realize how dangerous the low temperatures are, but so many people are afraid of heights that it would have been a valuable aspect of their dilemma on which to focus.  The acting is good, the cinematography is ok, the pacing is slow and the soundtrack is good.  For some reason it just didn't all add up to ""OK"".",1381190400,3,1004,4.394594594594595

Wolf attacks on living people are virtually unknown in reality.  but like the grey movie , they had to  have some kind of villain.

Very few films take us through a real original disturbing and masterfully crafted edge of your seat thriller/drama/horror adventure movie....All I have to say is... studios look and learn. I could only hope more films were this engrossing. As I watched I was so involved in what was going on, my popcorn and coke fell out of my hands. This is a really truly horrific scenario that is so real and could very much happen just about anywhere at anytime and without notice. The actors, Kevin Zegers, Shawn Ashmore and Emma Bell gave nothing short of outstanding performance and the direction is flawless. Saw Zegers in Transamerica and really like his choice of work... have been following him for sometime now and I look forward to seeing more work from Shawn Ashmore and Emma - all very gifted actors who really own their craft. Back to the film... I was inmerse from the get go till the end and you never see nothing coming which is exactly how I love my movie-going experience. The advertisements were right... this is the Jaws, pirahna, whatever opportunistic disaster movie you can think of, for a new generation. Highly, highly, highly recommended.... you will not be disappointed!!!!! It's an absolute gem of a film. Don't let anyone tell you about it - WATCH IT!!!!",1376352000,7,1363,4.755274261603375

Well appearently they do when they're college kids and the people in charge of operating the lift aren't so great at their job.

After that it's another movie with a small cast and mostly takes place in the same location. The characters are mildly interesting, but it's the athmosphere that really hooks the viewer to this film. The desperation of the cast and the odds against surviving the film are what truely holds the viewer to the movie.

#1 When you up that high and you can't climb down because there are no stage. The only viable option is to jump, but jump kills you because the fall.

If I was one of them the next question I would ask myself is it possible to jump without getting killed and how.

The fall will kill because your body accelerate while falling, if you fall without acceleration, then the fall won't kill you, simple physics - To make a parachute with what you got.

They could have taken off some part of their cloth and tie them together, the jumper would probably still get hurt, but even a small jacket when you hold all four ends while jumping, it would reduce the falling speed drastically, specially they're in a windy weather, the wind would carry him in a small amount distance horizontally.

It could be done.

#2 But it isn't just the fall, the next guy climb his way down, it's the wolves killed him.

Wolves are fake, period, I don't buy it. Wolves just don't camp around where a lot of human going up and down on daily base, to protect themselves being hunted. If you 2 minutes after you landed and the whole gang of wolves going at you, it's movie plot, noting more.

4135830,4,B003L1ZWG2,"Let me qualify this review: I believe that it is necessary for the viewer to have actually been snow skiing or snowboarding in order to fully appreciate the events that unfold in this film. I say this because I recommended this film to a friend who had never skied found the film boring and too ""talky"".

Yes, the pace of this movie is slow compared to the typical action thrillers that are cranked out with little thought to reality. But if you are looking for a fairly intelligent, well scripted, believable film that will have you second guessing the characters but wondering what you would do if you were in their shoes, then this is a helluva ride!

Three college students hit the slopes finagling their way around the lift ticket process. A series of unbelievable but probable situations leads to them being stranded on the ski lift at closing on a Sunday night. No problem right? They'll be found soon enough or at least by the next morning when the resort opens back up....right? Ahhh, but we're informed the resort is only operating on Fridays through Sundays.

What happens next is a slow process of agonizing drama and fear. I won't reveal much more, because it would really give the movie away.

This is film not unlike Cube (which freaked me out) or Deep Water (which wasn't as freaky as Cube - but similar premise).

In short, there are no good solutions for our characters - but the situations they face are ones we - in their shoes - must question and ask if we would be able to do any differently.

The dialogue is well written and the acting is fine. The production itself is top notch and I have to say the ending is fittingly unnerving.

This is not a film with a happy resolve.

I liked it so much I bought it (though not through Amazon as in this instance they were a bit more expensive).

I don't bother with DVD extras, so I won't review those.

This is a fine film but may not be for everyone.",1369094400,2,1918,4.423295454545454

4135833,3,B003L1ZWG2,"Ok from the get go this movie will not bring any suprises considering there is only so much a person can do if they are trapped in a ski lift chair. Either jump or attempt to make your way across the suspension wire above you to a vantage point where you can then make it to safe ground below. Both senarios are presented here. The first delivers what you might expect. Broken bones and no real way to go on further. The second is what I had a real problem with. One of the people stuck does indeed attempt to scale the wire above. But as the audience were supposed to swallow that this thick wire could cut through heavily padded winter gloves and then tear your hands apart. This idea simply doesnt work because the wire in question is pretty common and couldn't possibly cause such damage. Naturally the razor wire idea had to be written into the script or else our endangered survivalists could have easily escaped their peril much easier than what this film expects us to believe. In fact one of the three people subjected to this situation would have easily considered that option before attempting to jump some 60 feet below. Sounds like I didn't like this movie doesnt it? Well I did like it for what it was, but much of this story was pretty far fetched, that goes without saying. But none the less I found it very interesting anyway. Except for the predictable and weak character development and knowing the way this predicament could ever happen in the first place early on, I decided to suspend my expectations of a realistic story and just enjoy the ride. The result is pretty much what you could expect to see, but none the less I found this a somewhat interesting movie anyway.

Unfortunately, there are a few negative aspects that prevent this movie from becoming a classic. I realize that this is only a movie, but most of the characters' actions while stranded on the ski lift was highly illogical. Yes, they didn't expect to be placed in a survival situation, but you'd think they would have more common sense. I will refrain from adding any further details to avoid spoilers. Anyway, I was able to overlook these minor issues because the movie was otherwise well made. The biggest problem for me was the portrayal of wolves. The movie would have still been good (perhaps even better) without the wolves. It seems that the director wanted to have some gore and a greater sense of danger (if being stranded on a ski lift in freezing weather wasn't enough), and the wolves were the only way he could accomplish this task. I feel that a bear or mountain lion, while they would normally be hibernating during this time, would be slightly more credible. My last criticism would be the ending. I feel it would have been more effective to end the credits without knowing if all (or any) of the characters have survived. This movie is certainly as good, if not better, than Open Water.

This is one of those dumb 80-minute, crap-concept movies that might appeal to coma victims, brain dead teens, snowboarding losers, and mall rats, but it is ridiculously impossible to accept that these three moronic friends could even manage without tripping or killing themselves from the get go.

Three incessantly whining, narcissistic, teenage dummies decide to spend their night roaming around a ski mountain. Yeah, that same old setup.

Add the three most incompetent idiots on the planet, the most feeble ski lift chair ever assembled, the most belligerent wolves ever born, the most inexplicably sharp braided steel cable ever manufactured, and what do you get? A more than flawed survival ""thriller"" in the snow.

Perhaps I feel this way being a self-taught German Alps climber; the plot, idiotic and full of holes, the characters unlikable and numskulled; I legitimately wished for them all to die.

The idea of a pack of ""blood thirsty"" wolves on a ski hill, ridiculous. Wolves in fact hardly ever assault humans unless they are menaced. They are pack animals that govern their territory from other predators (wolves). They are more interested in human presence as observers as opposed to man eaters.

4136006,3,B003L1ZWG2,"This film is basically a mountain version of ""Open water"", definitely not as good but certainly original, a litle bit slow in some parts but quite surprising in others and even genuinely scary in a scene or two.

The story begins with two young guys and a young girl who took a weekend to go skiing. Because of a snafu (and also because of their own reckless stupidity) they find themselves blocked on a chairlift, high above the ground, alone in the middle of the night, with the perspective of spending the whole week there, before people come open the ski resort for the next weekend...

The story seems to be quite silly, but it is not half bad filmed and with the panicked - and not very clever - three people making some critical mistakes, their situation will become very dire indeed... The coming of a blizzard complicates things even more and gives to this film some pretty good moments. At one moment, the deteriorating condition of the girl, Parker (Emily Blunt), will force the two guys, Joe and Dan, best friends since preschool, into some pretty desperate moves - and it is indeed a tough thing for a man to seat still when the chilly wind rips slowly but certainly pieces of skin from the face of an attractive young female next to him... This kind of primal reaction explains a lot of heroically stupid things happening in ""Frozen""...

Now this is definitely not a great or a very good film and without much effort it is easy to find lots of plot holes, but with a beer or two (and also at least one cup of hot chocolate) it is quite watchable. There were many critics about the ending, but I personally found it rather good.

Bottom line, this is a rather honest little thriller, to see once and then sell on E-Bay. Can be good for watching with your girlfriend as it will probably induce her into cuddling in search of some warmth (this film REALLY can make you feel cold)...",1347840000,,1893,4.478260869565218

The story had a solid base but what it lacked was anyone who has ever been in the wild, cold, someone who had to make decisions in a life threatening moment.  For the remake, forget the tension between the new couple and the third wheel.  The dynamic of three skiers being stranded on a lift proved itself (except for in California where the Ski Patrol skies for 30 minutes after the lifts are closed to ensure this kinda event doesn't happen...  Perhaps the Ski Patrol doesn't do the same for smaller resorts in other states, sobeit...)...  I am an Eagle Scout and have been in many situations where decisions had to be made quickly.  When the lift stopped my first thought would have been to use the clothes that WE were wearing.  Tuck in your hair and tighten your hood...  Use your knit cap and cover your face...  The third wheel had a hood but never put it on!  He had it behind him the whole movie.  She could have tucked her hair in her coat, used her cap to cover her face, and drawn her hood and snitched her water-proof hood over her face for the entire movie.  The three of them could have use body heat until the morning and then tied their clothing as a rope to lower someone enough to safely fall to the snow below.  And the bigest WFT was why did she not protect her ungloved hand and hold onto to the biggest heat sink around her?...

She had it lucky. Now imagine being stuck a hundred feet in the air in a small chair, a nasty winter storm is blowing in all around you, and right below you a pack of hungry wolves are waiting to make you their next meal.

  That's the situation our three protagonists face when an idyllic weekend at a ski resort turns into a nightmare when they are abandoned midway up a mountain and the resort shuts down for the week. Directed by Adam Green (Hatchet) and starring Shawn Ashmore (X-Men, The Ruins), Kevin Zegers (Wrong Turn, Dawn of the Dead), and sexy newcomer Emma Bell (Final Destination 5, ""The Walking Dead""), Frozen puts a very human face on a very slow and painful way to die.

  When Hatchet became somewhat of an overnight cult success a few years back, it help establish Adam Green as a welcomed face to the horror genre and he has had a pretty good run in greasing some pretty iconic new names in the mix such as Victor Crowley. It was only a matter a time before he would expand his craft beyond the slasher movie. And what makes Frozen work is that it's a very believable situation that any one of us could one day face.  The casting of our three leads were pitch perfect. Ashmore and Bell really show the range of their talent as they carry the bulk of the last third of the movie on their shoulders. Bell, in one heart wrenching scene, brought me nearly to tears as she worried about the fate of her dog she left behind if she were to die. Add to it that neither her character nor Ashmore's particularly know or like one another (she's Zegers' new girlfriend tagging along on his and Ashmore's annual ski weekend and Ashmore is a bit jealous over the amount of time he rarely gets to spend with his best friend whom he's known since they were in kindergarten) helps add to the steadily mounting tension so that once Zegers is out of the picture, the film's overall emotional heart and drama really take center stage.

  And then there are the wolves. Forget the somehow supernaturally gifted wolves of the past summer hit The Grey, these four legged hell hounds of the forest are the real deal. They circle, communicate with each other, and are a very force to be reckoned with.

  Overall, Frozen is well worth the $10 - $15 asking price and packs a much stronger visceral punch than it's wider known and bigger budgeted successor.  A must see for any survival horror/ adventure fans.",1339718400,,2605,4.420502092050209

4136013,4,B003L1ZWG2,"Synopsis: Dan and Lynch are childhood friends. They've decided to go skiing on Mount Holliston in New England. Dan brings his gf, Parker, (who he's been dating for a year) with them, much to the chagrin of Lynch. The trio do some skiing during the day. But they are unhappy to find out the ski resort is closing early due to bad weather. So they manage to persuade the ski lift worker on duty to let them ride one more time. After the trio gets on the lift, he is the first ski lift operator is relieved by a coworker. The operator who is being relieved tells the new man there are three more on the lift. When the new man sees three people leaving the ski resort, he assumes that is the three his coworker told him about. So he shuts off the lift, leaving the real trio (the protagonists) stuck up on the lift. Unfortunately, it is Sunday and the resort won't be open again until Friday. That means the trio must find a way down from the lift that appears to be more than 30 feet off the ground.

I like this movie. It's one of the few horror movies that make me feel as if this could truly happen to me. Most horror is supernatural. For example, I don't think I'll ever be in Lt. Ripley's position in the movie Alien. However, I do feel it's possible I could find myself in the position of the 3 protagonists. I like both movies. The fact that Alien couldn't happen does not diminish its horror for me. However, watching a horror movie that feels like it could really happen to me adds a different dimension to my viewing experience. That's one reason I like it. Plus, I could understand the characters. They seem cliched, sure. But it's not like the U.S. is short of people who look and act like them. C'mon. Plus, I began to sympathize with them as they were talking about their past, their hopes, and their goals. I sympathized with their determination to survive. Yes, there were cliches but I liked the characterization enough to recommend this movie.

Now, I'll just address some of the gripes people had with this movie *SPOILERS*

1. ""How can the ski resort allow wolves to roam free on their territory? That's a poorly managed ski resort."" It's possible the wolves came from somewhere else and that was only a one time deal. If wolves come to the resort when it's closed all the time, I could still see it. The U.S. has wholesale cities that are ineptly run in some way or another. For example, Detroit is a city that is so poorly governed that people don't want to be there during daylight hours. San Antonio has a huge stray dog problem. There were stray dogs that managed to get through the gates of Lackland Air Force base and bite Air Force trainees. It's impossible to walk an hour through San Antonio and not see at least two stray dogs. The U.S. has such poorly managed cities. I don't think it's unlikely to see poorly managed businesses.

2. ""I'm an expert on the ropes they use on ski lifts. There's no way the ropes could be so hard they cut through your hands."" This was made on imdb. Another rope expert for ski resorts refuted this. Plus, the stuntman who did Lynch's stunts said they did cut his hands.

3. ""The mountains look like the Rocky Mountains, not mountains of New England."" I've never seen either the mountains of the Rockies or New England. Sue me. I didn't care. I agree, however, that it would have been smarter to set the movie in Utah where it was filmed instead of New England. However, movies do stupid stuff like that all the time. I just finished watching the Spanish-British horror movie called ""the Abandoned"". The movie was supposed to be set in Russia. But it was filmed in Bulgaria. In the movie, the filmmakers were trying to pass off obvious Bulgarian landmarks as Russian landmarks, which caused Bulgarian viewers to laugh scornfully. Just like ""Frozen"" ""the Abandoned"" didn't have any logical reason for setting the movie in a place that didn't further the plot. But, oh well, movies do this all the time.

4. ""Why did he try to jump from the ski lift?"" He brain was in panic mode. There are millions of examples of people doing stupid things while their brains are panicking.

5. ""If her hand was really that cold, she wouldn't put it on the ski lift."" Disagree. I've spent most of my life in some of the coldest States in the U.S. and parts of Canada. I've lived in both Dakotas. The Dakotas are easily in the top 5 coldest States in the U.S. One time I locked myself out of my house in Bismarck, North Dakota. In Bismarck, it gets so cold it makes my moustache hear feel like the strings on an electric guitar. Throw water on the ground, it'll turn to ice within 30 minutes. Imagine sleeping outside in this. When I was sleeping outside, I was huddled in a corner. I tossed in my sleep. My hat fell off and I woke up with my hair feeling so hard one strand of hair could cut carrots. So yes, I do believe when you're cold, tired, and miserable, you can sleep with your body exposed to the elements. So the character putting her hand on the sky lift metal is quite possible.",1334188800,3,5031,4.397422126745435
4136014,3,B003L1ZWG2,"<strong>Frozen</strong> (Adam Green, 2010)

The thing you are most likely to hear about <em>Frozen</em> is ""<em>Open Water</em> on a ski lift."" And that is not an invalid assessment of the movie; the two are at the forefront, I fervently hope, of a new genre of survival horror: endurance horror. (One could, if feeling snarky, also lump in the recent docudrama <em>127 Hours</em>.) You take a very small cast, you put them in a situation that pretty much defines untenable, and you see what they do.

Such is the case here. Green (<em>Hatchet</em>) gives us three skiers, Dan Walker (<em>Dawn of the Dead</em>'s Kevin Zegers), his girlfriend Parker (<em>The Walking Dead</em>'s Emma Bell), and his best friend Joe (<em>X-Men</em>'s Shawn Ashmore), who run a scam on the lift guy (<em>The Change-Up</em>'s Ed Acerkman) in order to get themselves on the slopes without paying for lift tickets. All well and good until the resort shuts down early because of an incoming front. They cajole until he allows them one more ride up...and then, through a series of mishaps at the bottom of the hill, the three of them are left stuck on the ski lift after everyone goes home. And the resort won't be open again for five days.

So here you are, stuck fifty feet off the ground in the middle of nowhere, you're panicked, you're exposed in the face of a winter snowstorm, and there are probably things you haven't even thought of yet. What are you going to do? Well, it stands to reason that the characters are going to find the stupidest possible ways to do things, and then try to do them. Which leads to all the expected problems, but unlike the <em>Open Water</em> crew, Green was willing to make his characters, and his audience, suffer some brutal indignities in addition to, you know, being stuck on a ski lift in sub-freezing weather in the middle of nowhere for, potentially, an entire business week. And while the situation itself is horrifying enough, it's the little things that really count, like falling asleep with your hand curled around a metal bar and then waking up the next morning and having to peel your skin off in order to reclaim it.

Make no mistake: this is an ugly, ugly movie, far more gruesome than was <em>Open Water</em> (though without getting into the gore-film realms of <em>Hatchet</em> and its sequel); unconfirmed reports state that at the movies Buttnumbathon premiere, someone actually did faint in the theatre during one shot. Even I had to close my eyes for that one. (Don't worry, if you're smarter than the characters, you will see it coming and be able to prepare yourself.) But if you're okay with the shocking-but-relatively-short scenes of intense violence, this is a pretty solid endurance-horror flick, worth digging up at your local kiosk if you've never checked it out. ***",1332979200,,2813,4.854166666666667
4136035,4,B003L1ZWG2,"I have to say that when I first started watching this movie, I was not sold on the characters but by the end I was. I am not going into plot since you can read the description yourself. What I will say is that I was at the edge of my seat for a good part of the movie.

I have read the reviews and everyone has a thought on how to survive and what they thought the characters did wrong. Yes the female lead puts her hand on the bar so the skin can get frozen. But how many of us would do the same thing, grab something in front of you for security while you are miles up in the air and fall asleep while you do it? The premise is young adults going for a a day at the slopes but get stuck not Man vs Wild!

The scene where she was talking about her puppy and when she has to urinate on herself were I thought great moments in the film. Why wouldn't she think about her dog, that is all they have up there...time to think. I thought the scene when she finally has to go the bathroom was so raw. On top of all that has happened-getting stuck, seeing your boyfriend in agony only to die, frost bite on your face...you have suffer the ultimate act of hopelessness and helplessness by having to pee on yourself. To me that was the horror part of this movie. You are at the mercy of things that you have no control over.

I thought everyone did a great job in this movie in conveying those emotions.",1330128000,,1393,3.985663082437276
4136036,4,B003L1ZWG2,"Adam Green? Shawn Ashmore? Emma Bell? Are you familiar with any of these names? No, me neither. Yet, these three, with one other actor, created a celluloid project, a movie featuring three fascinating character studies. Oh, but they are not the stars--they're just passing through. The environment will become the controlling force.

In Sartre's play, ""No Exit,"" three disparate characters torment each other. That's Sartre's Hell on Earth theory.

The premise of ""Frozen"" is the questioning by the three character studies: Will we escape? Will we get out of here? Is this our hell on earth?

You see, on Sunday morning, three people--two male friends, with one part of a couple--a threesome--go snow skiing for the day. The two men have been friends since first grade. (The undertone is that one is still in the closet about his homosexuality and his love for the other young man). The dilemma is the young woman, the steady girlfriend of the man in between. No one knows or suspects, except the audience, about the closet concept.

Yet the inciting event happens when the three are determined to beg another ride up the ski lift for ""one more"" turn downhill. They never make it to the top. Through misunderstanding and mis-communication, the trio are left up in the air and in the dark when the lift attendant is dismissed for the evening. However, not just the evening but the week. Not just the week....

There are three people in the lift where, normally, it is quiet and safe and almost cozy. Now the lift is in a total moonless night, with a storm approaching, and, unless a miracle happens, which will put three helpless young people all, all, alone.

For various reasons they lose gloves, ski caps, ski pole (a type of weapon) while dangling over the precipice of their situation. Which character will be sacrificed, for one always dies in a survival movie like this?

Now imagine YOU are one of these young people, college freshman age, and YOU get stuck on a ski lift half way up a mountain, then the motor stops, the lights are switched off, the loud speaker ceases. And it's just you and two friends dangling in the dark night....

The film is entitled ""Frozen"" for a not inappropriate reason.

Well, we both watched the rest of the movie and it was great. Very, very suspenseful and from then on at least, no sex, no nudity, not the worst language. Now, there is a scene or two which a younger child or one that is more freaked/grossed out might not enjoy it, so beware there.

Otherwise, I think this is a good movie for just about anyone. I plan to watch it again with my husband and older son. I kind of want to compare it with Speed (the movie with Keeanu Reeves) because it kept you wondering what was going to happen, how they were going to get out of their predicament. Also, there was really interesting character development as time went along. While a lot of the movie was these folks on a chair lift, it never got boring. It was like watching an episode of I Shouldn't Be Alive, but in full movie form.

I thought this was a very well done and suspenseful movie about three friends being trapped on a ski lift overnight and the terror that ensues as a result of them being exposed to the elements. Yes this move had a lot of that ""Murphy's Law"" element going on similar to the Final Destination movies where everything that can go wrong, does go wrong. But I thought it was done in very suspenseful, intelligent and believable way. The acting was outstanding and the characters conveyed desperation and terror quite realistically.

There are many nail biting and cringe worthy moments where the characters go through strong physical turmoil and torture as a result of being trapped in the permanent frost, with icy winds pinching their faces like sharp needles and skin frozen on the metal. What I liked was that everything happening to them made sense, like when you fall from that high up, you break your legs in the nastiest way. The POV shot they used for that was quite unsettling and my heart skipped a beat when i heard the crack and saw the exposed bones upon impact. This movie is pure survival of the human vs nature kind. The only thing that was a bit unbelievable were the bloodthirsty wolves. I didn't know wolves attacked humans, especially not in posh ski resorts  where they are used to the presence of humans and in fact are more scared of us more than anything. That just didn't seem very believable.

Other than that, this is a suspenseful and quite entertaining movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat at all times. I don't know why people always insist on psychoanalyzing characters in movies, accusing them of not enough depth in demeanor and conversations they hold. Who cares that their dialogues don't convey in depth analysis of Faulkner's works, they are a bunch of friends on a ski resort trying to get away from it all.

At first glance this movie looks like it's gonna be another one of those 20 something flicks with no real point. But it quickly proves me wrong. There is only about fifteen minutes of intro then this movie thrusts into the action and it's nonstop. Once Parker, Dan and Lynch get trapped on the sky lift you're in for an amazing ride.

I won't go into any spoilers because the film's twists is what makes it so good. It's a little gory in some spots and I found myself turning my head constantly whenever someone was in jeopardy because it seemed so real.

The acting is very good and I was impressed by Emma Bell with this being her first film. I think she has the makings of an A-list actress. What I really enjoyed was how the film kept raising the stakes. Every time you thought there would be a boring part coming up (because it usually happens between action) there was something else that happened! Either the trio was fighting amongst each other or their lives were threatened. One way or another these characters force you to put yourself in their shoes. You actually feel your heart pounding with theirs. You feel the fear they have and you feel the terror as if you are right there with them. This movie was amazing and even I am shocked I enjoyed it so much.

This movie will knock your socks off and you will be biting your fingernails at what happens next. Even the calm moments will send tingles up your spine. If you enjoyed films like Twister, Cliffhanger and Alive then you will definitely love this movie.

To make matters worse, it was Sunday night and the ski resort wasn't scheduled to open again for five days.  As this story unfolded, I found myself imagining how I would respond if it happened to me.  What would I do?

4136043,1,B003L1ZWG2,"I can't believe I wanted to see this movie; I am glad I waited for Netflix to stream the movie online before I went and spent money on it.

The plot is simple enough 3 college age kids are out at a ski resort. Two guys who are best friends and one of their tag-along girlfriends. They don't seem to bring enough money to pay for the ski-lift so the guys convince the girlfriend to flirt with the chair lift guy to give them a free ride. They take one and then convinced the guy to give them one last ride before he shut down for the night. The guy argues with them about it but they eventually change his mind and get on the lift.

My thought on this: you get what you pay for...next time listen to the guy who says they're closing up for the night. He may not appear to be the smartest guy on the block but he knows his job enough to keep it.

Eventually things lead to them getting stuck on the lift. After sitting there for hours one decides he's going to jump and it doesn't end well for him...breaks both legs, then the wolves' descend. First one and then they scare him off by throwing a ski board at it. It comes back with the pack and down goes the first victim of the movie. I'm not going to sit and debate the likelihood of this happening, I don't know much about wolves so I can't say if they'd attack a human under any circumstance.

After that happened, and the hailstorm, the girl (hunter) wakes up to find her uncovered hand is frozen to the metal chair-lift. Shouldn't this have crossed her mind if she had known their faces were already being covered with frost-bite then to lay her frost-bitten hand over the iced pole that it wasn't a smart idea?
After the second male wakes up he climbs his way up to the cables and makes his way down. Fights off the wolves and lives Hunter promising to come back for her. She falls asleep for an un-said amount of time and falls off the lift either on purpose or by accident I haven't exactly figured that out yet. She breaks her fall in half by pulling the chair down, still manages to hurt her leg but crawls and falls down the snow filled mountain.

The movie is almost over but I still don't have deep seeded care for the characters even after the death of two of them. I'm not a cruel person but I guess I just didn't bond with the characters all that well.

One of my employees sums up the experience. ""I wish I had those 90 minutes back"".  The best I can say is it's good for an occasional laugh on stormy days when we can't work.",1322352000,,440,3.9101123595505616
4136085,2,B003L1ZWG2,"Three besties go out skiing for the weekend. They don't want to pay full price, so they manipulate the lift operator to give them a round on the house. The kids felt like they didn't get enough that day. They convinced the operator to let them have the last lift. The operator guy felt the intense urge to piss. He left the machine in the care of another responsible guy. The kids are forgotten in the dark and no one can hear them in the vast cold abyss of nothingness. We are reminded at the beginning of the movie that these kids did not have their cell phones. They had no way of communicating to anyone once on the lift. It appeared that the kids would have spent a week on the lift without food, water, and shelter. After some research I found that a human can live a good while without food as long as the person is hydrated.  A person can last about 8-14 days without water depending on the person and how fast sweat, urine, and tears are leaving the body. You can live up to about 4 weeks without food depending on conditions like weight, temperature and exertion. SO with that in mind, we know that the kids had to face harsh weather conditions. By sitting the kids wouldn't be spending so much energy. I think they all would have survived the week. The biggest, most obvious mistake was jumping. There is no way to land safely jumping off of something that high. I guess he didn't study physics very well. I have no idea why the girl was scared to pee in her pants. You are stranded. Nothing matters but survival. Making wolves out to be monsters was unnecessary. Wolves do not attack people at random. Wolves are actually timid around people.  They would even leave their food to avoid a confrontation with people. Wolves will defend themselves when needed, but they aren't crazy man killers. What an awesome movie that misleads everyone about wolves. Overall, special effects were ok. The actors were a little less than average. You have to accept that these kids are weak idiots to move on with the movie. Otherwise you will be frustrated the entire time.

4136091,3,B003L1ZWG2,"I admit it: I'm a sucker.

  I realize this happened a while ago. I was about 12 years old, at the prime of my skiing days(right before I decided not to go pro and instead try to hit on women.) I forget what movie I was watching, but a preview came on for Aspen Extreme where these two fluorescent-clad guys were running around Aspen, Colorado, skiing off-trail, hooking up with hot, rich women, you know, good stuff that any pubescent heterosexual male would eat up.

  The movie sucked. Well, at the time it was awesome, but looking back, yeah, it sucked. But it was a skiing movie. I COULD NOT stay away. Granted, it wasn't as cheesy as Lane Meyer winning the big race with one ski, but at least Better Off Dead was meant to be that way.

  So, 15 years later, I get suckered in again, except this time it's a horror movie: Frozen. I expected big things, like, not wanting to ever go skiing again for fear of being mauled by a wendigo, or getting killed by a chair-lift operator who's jealous of my girlfriend. Sadly, all it made me want to do was head up to Vermont.

  The plot is pretty straight-forward: A guy goes skiing with his best friend and girlfriend. After hustling a chair-lift operator to let them ski without a lift ticket, the three get stuck on a chair-lift, and end up trying to survive because:

1) The mountain is closed all week during what seems like peak ski season, just because...

2) No one checks the chair-lifts after they are shut down

3) There apparently isn't a chair-lift operator at the top of the lift, which means the guy at the bottom is magically able to stop the lift when someone at the top has a problem getting off

4) There is nothing wolves like more than skiing

  Good times and hilarity ensue.

  Besides these plot problems, the movie itself is pretty intense. People die. Blame is placed. Pasts are dug up. People try to be heroes. While there isn't much violence in the film (just your average broken legs, wolf attacks, and a scene that makes putting your tongue on a frozen metal pole seem like fun), those scenes work well as a whole, because it makes the movie more personal. They are driving forces that keep the movie interesting in the dramatic department.

  Which leads to what this movie is: a drama/thriller, with horror devices. It's not a ""horror movie"". That's not a bad thing. Sure, the horror elements, while sparse, are cringe-worthy, but about midway through the movie, there's no real fear. It's kind of like that movie Alive: after you get past the realization of what's going to happen, you're not really scared. Maybe that parallel is meant to be in Frozen.

  I did have one thing nagging at me throughout the movie. One of the actors was familiar, but I couldn't place him. Turns out, it was Shawn Ashmore, Iceman from the X-Men series. You can't make this stuff up.

  I give this movie 3 out of 5 frozen Jack Nicholsons. It may seem high considering the review, but the effort was noble.",1313193600,7,2966,4.477611940298507
4136092,4,B003L1ZWG2,"Writer/director Adam Green (Hatchet), maintains that the central premise of his movie Frozen (2010) is quite realistic, where three friends out for a weekend of skiing, suddenly find themselves in a tough situation, and having to make some hard decisions.  If you haven't seen the film, major spoilers follow so bail out now if you don't want to know what happens.

After a day of skiing on the bunny slopes around Mount Holliston, Dan Walker (Kevin Zeggers), his girlfriend Parker (Emma Bell), and his best friend Joe Lynch (Shawn Ashmore), are taking the ski lift up for one final run.  When the lift suddenly stops moving, they are trapped some fifty feet in the air, high above the snow covered ground, as night falls.

Most of the rest of the film focuses on the activities in the ski lift chair, and the immediate surrounding area.  To give the film a sense of realism, the film was shot on location, with the actors actually suspended on a real ski lift, at a resort in Utah.  Besides a tale of survival, the film also examines the relationships between the three characters.  The dynamic at play concerns Parker not being an experienced skier, and getting between two longtime friends.  While the behavior of these individuals isn't always credible, shooting on location adds many realistic facets to the film, as the actors are subjected to being at altitude in the harsh elements.

It is a Sunday, and the group anticipates that resort will be closed for several days.  The immediate danger seems to be that they will freeze to death, and Dan decides to risk dropping to the ground, to try and get help. Unfortunately he breaks both his legs on the hard snow, and can't move.  When a pack of wolves arrives, a helpless Dan has no chance, and is killed, while his friends above listen to his screams.  After this emotional peak, Parker and Joe blame each other for Dan's death.  Joe decides that it is better to try to get down rather wait to die.  He bravely travels on the cable, which cuts into his hands and manages to reach a support tower which has a ladder down to the ground.  Fighting off the wolves, Joe races away on a snowboard.  Waiting for help to arrive, Parker is left in an unstable car, which eventually works loose and falls to the ground.  Suffering from frostbite she manages to avoid the wolves, and crawl and slide her way downhill.

The mixture of reality and fantasy produces a story that is dramatic, without going totally off the deep end.  The presence of the wolves might be a questionable element, but the use of real animals is quite impressive.  While the characters are not the brightest people around, there at least seems to be some thought behind what they do.  An exception is Dan's descent, as there were some ways he could have softened his fall, although he probably would still have been badly hurt.  All the talking that Dan does when injured seems excessive, but given that his time is short, is understandable why Adam Green gave him the lines.  Green generally keeps his dialog restrained and real, and doesn't have his characters engage in pointless conversations.  When the cast is reduced to two, Shawn Ashmore and Emma Bell, impressively take their performances to a new level.

Similar to recent films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Canyon/dp/B002LBKE02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Canyon</a>&nbsp;(2008), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thirst/dp/B0039ZF87I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thirst</a>&nbsp;(2010), Frozen is more a story of man against nature, rather than a horror or suspense thriller.  While not an action spectacular, Frozen is very competently told, and impressively real, rating a solid 3.5 stars.  In the commentary track and various making of featurettes, Adam Green does a thorough job of covering various aspects related to production, explaining the decisions that were made, and pointing out the realistic elements incorporated into the story.

I convinced him to stick with it because they had to give you background info so you'd know why things happened later.  We were so happy we stuck through the first 20 minutes.  Once it ramped up it really ramped up.  It was intense!!  It wasn't the ""gory, gross you out"" kind of scary movie so many people think of as 'horror' movies.  It was genuinely intense; watching through my fingers over my eyes intense.

I wouldn't buy this movie but it was great movie to see one time. It's not predictable as most horror/thriller movies can be.

4136126,1,B003L1ZWG2,"I'll start of by saying **SPOILER ALERT** even though so many of the other people who wrote ""reviews"" gave the entire movie away already, but I just might say something that hasn't already been said.

Five minutes into this movie I already was thinking that none of the six people who had speaking parts had any acting ability.  Knowing from looking at the DVD box cover that this was going to be a movie about people being stranded on a ski lift by ten minutes into the movie none of the characters gave me any reason to care if any of them died.  By twenty minutes into the movie I started wishing they would all die and the rest of the movie would become a documentary on the lives of New England wolves.

Even those who gave this movie more than 3 stars (How is that possible?  Are they all written by cast and crew?) agree that the three main characters are dismally stupid.

Here are my favorite worst scenes:

-  The movie is current day (2010) but we are to believe out of 3 young people only the girl has a cell phone and she would leave it in a locker at the lodge?  How possible is it that anyone of that age would ever go anywhere without a cell phone?

-  One of the characters decides to jump 60', with his legs extended straight down.  What would be the obvious thing that would happen?  DUH!

-  The lift cable is sharp enough to cut through gloves?

-  The ONE chair on the entire lift that decides to fall off on its own is the one she is sitting in?

-  She is 5' from a vicious pack of wolves that have a known taste for young skiers and they ignore her?

-  Although they have parkas they leave their faces exposed to the bitter cold?

-  And what's up with that Ski Cat that just happens to park under them?

Much (most?) of the dialogue is unintelligible because of the whiney sobbing of the characters, not that you would want to hear it anyway, it is completely sappy.  The cheesy scream scenes during the crunch part of the movie were worse than the most low budget daytime soap opera.  The final 5 seconds of the movie summed up how I felt about the first 93 minutes ... I just didn't care.",1310256000,6,2117,4.19106699751861

Maybe the fact that the wolves are shown to be what they are. Predators. If you read the writings of early explorers, trappers, colonizers etc... there are numerous cases of wolf attacks on humans. Read pages 434 and 435 of the book HISTORY OF THE WESTERN MISSIONS AND MISSIONARIES IN THE UNTIED STATES. The attack happened in the state of Kentucky. The book was printed in the 1850's. Father DeSmet was the author. This is just one of many such historical records of wolf attacks on humans. I am a huge nature lover but am baffled by the dishoesty of other nature lovers. A fact is a fact. Under certain situations healthy and non rabid wolves will prey on humans. This bull about wolves never attacking humans is a bunch of mularky.

4136129,2,B003L1ZWG2,"My thoughts (with SPOILERS):

- I give it 2 1/2 stars. It was a bit interesting and I didn't mind watching it, but I was certainly disappointed in the ending. The story is about potheads who cheat their way onto a mountain for a final ski-run. They accidently are trapped on the way up when the place closes for a week and forgets they are still on the chairlift. There's a big storm coming in...will the three friends survive?

- Why would the mountain close for at least five days when good-snow is falling? Was that mentioned in the flick or commentary?

- I wouldn't call this a horror movie, but one about survival (along the lines of ""Open Water"").

- At first I was annoyed with the lack of seeing the cold breath; but then, I learned that when it's so cold and you're almost freezing for real, you wouldn't be seeing the breath when your body is so cold.

- When Dan jumped from the chair, his legs are so broken I imagine his body would have gone into shock. Also, when he leaves the chair, it shows him ready to fall on his butt...but then you see he's on his way down directly onto his feet; I bet he could have made it.

- Joe should have removed his boots before climbing across the cable. He did speak of how they were so heavy. He shouldn't have kept them on the second time he attempt the cable. Also, maybe they could have protected his hands if he used them on his hands while going across the cable?  Lastly, once he made it to the ground, my didn't he snowboard down the mountain instead of just sitting on the thing?

- There was humour and camaradarie between the two guys, who are friends in real life, so that was neat.

- ""Vertigo"" has nothing to do with ""fear of heights"". It's the sensation of spinning/dizziness when there's nothing that would have made that happen. It usually caused by an inner-ear disturbance. So many movies/shows make that mistake.

- In one of the featurettes, we learn that Dan was going to be breaking-up with the girl at the end of the day. I wonder how that would have been incorporated into the story or modified it if that was added.

- Neither of the guys hung from the side of the chair, although it's depicted on the cover.

- The commentary mentions that there are two commentaries, one being more technical...but there was just one commentary. Also, on the package it mentions the actress being a part of the commentary; she didn't at first and I thought it was a mistake, but she'll appear right around when the group gets on the lift for the final time.

- The extras were neat and the last one is about 50 minutes on it own; it was the most interesting to me when you learned about the wolves being used and other things. Ultimately, for me, it was the commentary and extras that made this worthwhile. It was neat to here that the lift stopped somehow right when the director said something like ""This is where they should die."" Also, in a hidden 'Easter Egg', we learn that they found one of the chairs had a bullet hole in it -- where a man actually killed himself. They should have used that same seat! Heck,
they should do a cheapo, direct-to-DVD 'Frozen II - Frozener', but with a supernatural theme: stuck up in that chair with a killer ghost?

- The ending was completely dull. The girl made it to the road...someone picked her up eventually...and she was on her way to the hospital. I felt let-down somehow, like it was an episode of some TV-show ending. It would have been a neater ending if the wolves took her back to the forest and she didn't make it even if you thought she would...and then the car that would have rescued her would have come into view but would have been too late. Or if the car was on time and the driver saw more wolves coming for her...but the dude was too afraid to get out and help her.

- COMMENT ON A COMMENT FROM SOMEONE HERE: ""Oh yeah, fact that 3 people are on a slope with no cellphones made me laugh more than get mad.""

People complain about them not having a cell phone; in the commentary, you'll hear one of the actors - who is a skier - say that most skiers do not take the phone on the slopes, not only because of bad reception but mostly because they don't want to break their phone in a fall.
They leave it in a locker, just like they did in this movie and he does when he's on the mountain in real life.

- COMMENT ON A COMMENT FROM SOMEONE HERE: ""Why did they not tie all their coats and clothing together and make a rope. Even if it doesn't go too far down, it is still better than dropping the full distance? ""

Even the commentary jokes about this. You'll have naked people in the chair who would die  before the naked person on the ground. I bet those people in the chair, if naked, would end up with their butt's stuck and be even more-trapped!

- COMMENT ON A COMMENT FROM SOMEONE HERE: ""Further, to the most unlikely sequence of events that left them stranded is the obvious escape which is to use hands and feet to slide along the cable and, of course, never occurs to our potential victims.""

Even in the commentary, it talks of how dangerous those lines are and that even trying to slide on a chain would cut through the chain. So of course, it'll cut through some mere clothing and skin.

- COMMENT ON A COMMENT FROM SOMEONE HERE: ""Wolves may be pack animals, but they would not go out of their way to attempt to outsmart 3 humans and then lose interest in the female after taking down the males.""

The wolves already had much of their meal and were not finished when the lady went by. The woman wasn't even standing or sitting at the time, but was lying prone. It was as if the wolves were just warning her to stay away from their meal, which is what was mentioned in the commentary.

-----

In closing, there really wasn't much of a plot and it's not horror. The scenery and great shots got me the most interested, plus the commentary and good 'making of' featurette that was at least 50 minutes long made this worthwhile. For the movie, it's okay for just watching once. It's a story for a TV movie; I don't think there wasn't a lot of material to work with.",1306454400,3,6096,4.288327526132404
4136130,2,B003L1ZWG2,"***This review is full of hilarious spoilers, be advised!***

There is something about a film so bad it makes you laugh, mostly that it probably isn't worth watching and it certainly is not worth buying for more than $5.  Frozen is in that category, it's so incredibly ridiculous that you're left wondering why you sat through to the end and yet your stomach hurts from laughing.

The film has a simple plot: three college students are stuck on a ski lift after they beg the operator for one last run down the mountain.  Why?  Well, the girlfriend wasn't supposed to tag along and crashed the fun ""Guy Weekend"" and now feeling guilty they're headed out to try and salvage a day of dealing with the Bunny Hill.

I really wanted to like this movie; I found the entire concept to be really great: stuck alone on a ski lift in freezing temperatures knowing that if you can just hang on a few more days someone will be there to rescue you.  This is one of those stories that could hypothetically happen to anyone, and that's what makes it so chilling.  Instead of going for that creepy feeling of loneliness and playing it to the hilt we're met with the idiotic antics of children.

Now, you can say that young adults really are pretty daft in certain situations, so are adults.  No one is as stupid as these characters.  Jumping off a ski lift without first hanging down from the bars to give you that extra drop of height, jumping feet first, jumping at all when you know it's too high in the first place?  Not army crawling over the wire toward the ladder so that you can climb to safety, the ladder you must know is there because you've been skiing your entire life and using lifts?  Not huddling together for warmth?  Not zipping your jackets up over your face and ears when you know you're getting frostbite?  Taking off your equipment and throwing it at wolves?  Wrapping your bare hand around a metal bar and somehow managing to fall asleep like that?  Peeing in your own snowsuit because you can't be bothered to ask someone to help hold you while you lean over the side of the lift or at least hiking it up / down and peeing through the bars?

Those are just a few of the stellar moments and really they'd be excusable if we aren't presented with the knowledge that the two boys know how to ski / snowboard well enough to go on the hardest of trails and have a lifetime of knowledge about being on a mountain in the snow.  Actually no, throwing things that help keep you warm at wolves far below you thinking that will scare them off is not excusable no matter how distraught you are....

Which brings me to the title of this review: the multicultural wolf pack; was it that hard to actually find a proper pack of wolves?  Is it too difficult to present these animals appropriately?  Or was it not fitting because wolves would never (unless rabid) act the way they do in Frozen?  Seriously, you want me to stomach that wolves are going to go and eat a guy without stalking and harrying him to death.  Then you want me to believe they just hung around and waited so that they could within a 15-24 hour period eat another entire human being?  A bear would wait; a bear would -if hungry enough- have stalked them and eaten more than one full grown human being in a 15-24 hour period.  A bear, even though it would have been hibernation season, would have made a lot more sense than a mixed pack of timber and gray wolves on a human eating binge.

The characters are trite, but they're also very good portrayals of the surface level of a young adult's personality and character flaws.  I could have overlooked a lot of the movie had it ended before the second wolfing (ha!) down of a character and they just froze to death and were found when the resort opened back up.  That would have been really quite fantastic.  Instead our intrepid fools figure out when they should be dehydrated and going through serious pangs and weakness from hunger, how to army crawl over a wire.  Then he is eaten.  Now we're left with the girl, who is vapid, who manages to escape to the road.  I was hopeful at that point, ""Please let her die right here, let her succumb, it will make her managing to shimmy on her belly past the whacky wolves alright"" I thought to myself.  Then she was picked up by a car, survives, touching ending where as usual in cinema the girl lives when she should have been one of if not the first one dead, and it was over.

Needless to say it wasn't to my taste; there were too many glaring issues with the plausibility of such a simplistic plot to overlook.  I think Frozen could have been great; it could have been well worth the entire wolf debacle.  Unfortunately something that could have had that simple soul-touching horror of the everyday had a bunch of bunk injected into it and turned into something annoying and at times downright laughable.",1306108800,5,4862,4.434684684684685

The camera captures the isolation and danger. The actors portray the fear, the hopelessness and the desperation.

4136172,1,B003L1ZWG2,"Too bad it was marketed as a ""HORROR"" film.  That is my first problem with this movie.  At no time is it even close to being scary or horrific in any way.

***SPOLIER ALERT***

Let me start by saying that this is by far one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.  If you like movies about unlikable characters making ridiculous and improbable choices, with a few scenes of forced frights, poor effects, and cheap gore, then this is the movie for you!

First off, we meet our 3 main characters.  There are 2 douchebag guys and one idiot blonde girl who at no time reveal any redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Believe me, by the end of this movie you will be screaming at your tv ""Oh for crying out loud!  Die already!""  There are several ""talky"" scenes thrown in as attempts to get the audience to relate to the characters, but to no avail.

Secondly, I honestly can't remember the last time I laughed at a movie that wasn't supposed to be funny but was so bad I couldn't help myself.  Case in point, there is a scene where, after being stranded on the chair lift for several hours, the best idea these yahoos can come up with is for one of them to jump to the ground, and this is AFTER the guy in the snowplow has already come and gone.  At least if he would've jumped when the snowplow was there they would have been saved.  Sure he might've suffered the same broken legs, but at least after being treated at the ER he could've joined his friends for a drink by the fire!  Anyway, I digress...so the guy is lying on the ground, legs all busted up, and yet I found myself laughing out loud at how ridiculous it looked, not to mention how unrealistic it was.  Shouldn't have shock set in at some point??  And as if that wasn't bad enough, WOLVES show up!  And not just any wolves, but HUNGRY wolves...wolves who feed on human flesh!  Perhaps if there was one or two skinny, malnourished wolves who were obviously starving to death, this idea might have been easier to swallow.  But such is not the case...these are an entire pack of what appear to be perfectly healthy wolves.  At this point, I slapped my forehead.  Really?  When I find myself and those around me are laughing at a guy getting eaten by wolves, I know there is something really wrong with the movie.

Third, and I'll make this my last, I promise...these people are stranded on a ski lift for days, and we are to believe that they are in some sort of sub-freezing temps??  Maybe it's because I grew up in the upper Midwestern US, and have experienced real cold, but I found it very hard to believe because, even though they kept pointing out that they both indeed had frostbite on their faces, how did these people not think that maybe zipping up their coats completely and wearing their hoods might help them keep warm?  How about curling up with your legs closer to your body?  Or snuggling together for the body heat??  Not once did I ever feel like these people were cold, let alone freezing!  And it isn't that they chose not to do what they could to stay warm but that their survival instincts never kicked in to try and keep them from freezing to death??  And the part with the girl's hand freezing to the metal bar? Are you serious?!  Her hand is exposed to the cold all night and the only injury she sustains is her hand sticking to the metal a la the kid's tongue in A Christmas Story?!  C'mon!  These people never even shiver!

I agree that the acting was sub-par, but I often feel if the story is well-written, poor acting can sometimes be forgiven, especially in a ""Horror"" film.  But this was just a terribly written script.  I felt that my intelligence was completely insulted after sitting through the entirety of this movie.  Am I really supposed to feel for these people or believe any of what I am seeing?!  I literally came up with at least 5 simple solutions to their predicament in the first 5 minutes of them being ""stuck""!  I could even forgive the unlikely scenario that they are stranded without a cell phone in this day and age, but the numerous other plot holes were so gaping it was frustrating to watch.  I was exhausted by how angry I got by the end of this.  All the laughing certainly wore me out also.

This is worse than B movie stuff because it tries to be smart and stylish and it is really just one big joke from start to finish.  So watch if you must, but don't pay too much...luckily for me I watched it after a friend rented it, so all I really lost was an hour and a half of my life that I will never get back...",1299715200,14,4527,4.313981042654029

The plot, what there is of one, is three friends talk their way on one more lift ride at a ski resort. The employee that let them on is called away and the person who takes his place shuts down the lift stranding the three friends in midair.

They talk... a LOT in badly written inane dialog. I expect this was supposed to be a psychological thriller where we watch three people in an impossible situation come unraveled. Personally I was nearly bored to tears and hoping for an alien invasion or some cannibalism, action of any kind. I was, for the most part, sorely disappointed.

There's wolves that didn't act in any way like real wolves do. I don't want to give away the few bits of the movie that weren't boring dialog or bad acting or filler shots of trees. So I'll just leave it at that, there were wolves. Watch the movie if you want to know what they do, it's the only ten minutes or so that weren't utterly terrible... just unbelievable.

4136213,4,B003L1ZWG2,"Just got done watching Adam Greens ""Frozen"". This is the 2nd Green movie tat I have seen. The first was Hatchet, which was pretty bad. On the contrary, Frozen is much better. Unlike Hatchet, Frozen has a story that is more believable.

The plot revolves around three college kids, on a ski trip, who try to save some money by bribing the chairlift operator (instead of buying lift tickets). After a long day on the hills they convince the chair lift operator to give them one last ride. Then through some believable miscommunication, the ski resort employees turn off the lift, with the three kids still on the lift. I don't want to give out what happens, but the movie will keep you frozen to your seat till the end... pun intended.

Green has come a long way as a director. I liked the plot of the movie, the actors were good and their characters were likable and believable. I would compare this movie with the style of Eli Roths movies. Some parts made me laugh and some made me close my eyes.

As a fellow New Englander, I'm pleased to see that Adam Green has developed so well as a director. He has a real passion for movies and it shows. Give this movie a chance. It's allot of fun.",1298678400,,1189,4.3710407239819
4136214,4,B003L1ZWG2,"Frozen is more a psychological study than a horror film, though the scenario is undeniably horrific, as is the eventual outcome. Effective character development connects us with the protagonists as we follow them through events leading up to their isolation, dangling some 30 or 40 feet in the air on a rickety ski lift.

Early on I found myself cleverly thinking I knew how the film would play out, but I was wrong. The story is so well presented that I didn't even wonder how my girlfriend and I managed to sit for an hour and a half watching it unfold.

Trapped on a ski lift with no way down, and no one around, the characters are thrust into the unthinkable, and we see them working through the varied emotions that one might imagine to feel in such a situation.

Through it all I kept trying to think of what I would do to get myself out of it, but the answers just aren't that simple. The characters have very little to work with, and as their emotions twist their perceptions of the surroundings, and each other, we see just how very difficult it would be to think rationally for a solution to the problem.

There really is no easy solution, under the circumstances, and the circumstances come in a variety of forms. First, complete isolation, they are forgotten. Second, panic, anger and fear are compounded by subtle regression to more instinctive responses to the situation. Third, nature's cold shoulder.

Clever use of visuals and sound. Excellent cinematography, makeup and effects.

I'd watch it again.",1298419200,,1517,4.70566037735849
4136215,5,B003L1ZWG2,"It's rare nowadays to find a horror film that doesn't rely on extreme situations and ample amounts of gore to keep its audience in suspense. To that end, ""Frozen"" is a true rarity. Writer/Director Adam Green, who cut his teeth on the slasher-throwback, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hatchet/dp/B000WC389G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hatchet</a>,"" oozes as much love for Alfred Hitchcock as he does for any of the myriad of directors who tackled the beloved ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th/dp/B0002JP572/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th</a>"" franchise back in the day and it shows. ""Frozen"" is a good ol' fashioned nail-bitingly intense experience that will leave you yelling at the screen long after the credits have rolled.

In the film, three college buddies (Emma Bell, Kevin Zegers and Shawn Ashmore) take to the ski-slopes to forget about reality for the weekend but soon find stress where they least expect it. On one last late-night round of skiing and snowboarding, the threesome find themselves stuck on a ski-lift. It seems nobody knows they are up there and since screaming won't suffice, it becomes rather apparent that they'll be stuck up there until the next weekend when the ski resort re-opens. As small-talk turns to panic, and panic turns to action, things only go from bad to worse when a storm starts looming overhead and a swarm of wolves gather at their feet. Could things possibly get any worse? Of course they can. And they do.

Green pulls through with what is undoubtedly his finest film to date, but it helps that he is aided by an able cast and a real setting (no green-screens here, folks!). Our three characters not only ooze chemistry, but make the sort of dumb decisions that make them relatable without being completely unlikeable. You'll scream at the screen because even though they are being irrational at times (put your gloves on backwards, you dummy!) you like them and want them to survive. Bell in particular shines as the token female. Her revelation about the inevitable fate of her puppy not only raises the stakes, but shows off some major talent that is likely to go places in the future.

Considering the low budget, the film looks great. There is ample atmosphere and at no point does the film lose credibility. It's a solid hour and a half of old-fashioned suspenseful torture. Green's script plays it old-school without giving way to clichs and the end results pay off. Sure, there are some internal logic issues, but not enough to bring the whole down. In the end, the film presents a tense and realistic situation and keeps you glued to the screen until the bitter (?) end. All around, from the writing to the cinematography to the acting, this is about as good as it gets for modern horror. For lack of a better term, you won't be left in the cold with ""Frozen.""",1298332800,,2920,5.156118143459915
4136216,4,B003L1ZWG2,"Frozen, starring Emma Bell (of The Walking Dead), Kevin Zegers (of Dawn of the Dead) and Shawn Ashmore (of the Ruins, and X-men), is a 93 minute surprisingly tense and tragic film. Directed and written by Adam Green who also did Hatchet.

 It's a simple set up. 3 friends, Parker and Dan (boyfriend and Girlfriend) and Joe, who is Dan's best friend go snowboarding/skiing on Mt. Holliston in New England. Parker can't snowboard, but Dan is so sweet he spends the entire day with her on the Bunny slope for beginners; Joe on the other hand is frustrated that he can't ski down the big run and blames Parker for how lame this weekend has turned out to be. Classic third wheel syndrome. Dan manages to convince Parker to bribe the lift worker to let them ride all day for way less than the lift tickets actually cost. At the end of the day when they decide, after Joe complains at every opportunity, they grab their gear and head for the lift again. Only to find that its shutting down, Parker bats her pretty eyes and they are on it, but they are the last ones. The lift guy, and his coworker exchange words and an oversight happens and the lift is shut down for the night, actually for the whole week, which is worse!

So these three, are stuck at the highest point on the lift, in the freezing cold. No lights, no food or water, and with faces exposed to the elements it doesn't take long for frostbite to eat away at flesh. It's the typical ""how are we going to get out of this"" scenario, but of course with the extra added bonus of freezing to death, razor sharp wire to cross, a jump that comes with probable broken bones, and wild animals.

I really liked this movie, I love simply shot, decently acted isolation horror films like this. It depended a lot on the interaction of these three, and I wasn't disappointed. It used Gore in the right places, and tenderness at others, it was funny and heart wrenching as well. Completely worth a look, doesn't get 5 stars from me, but I still really enjoyed it.",1298246400,3,2007,4.401617250673854
4136217,4,B003L1ZWG2,"Dan (Kevin Zegers), Lynch (Shawn Ashmore), and Parker (Emma Bell) are spending a relaxing weekend at a local ski resort.  Itching to get off of the ""bunny hill"" and try some ""real"" skiing, the trio decides to bribe the lift operator into letting them take one last run before the slopes close for the week.  The operator quickly pockets the $100 offered by Emma, and they are soon on their way up to the top of the main hill.  However, on their journey up, the lights shut down, the chair lift stops moving, and the resort shuts down until the following weekend.  Suspended 60 feet above the ground, there is no way to get down.

Left totally alone and with the prospect of severe weather moving in, the group struggles with what they should do.  Frostbite is beginning to take its toll, and the onset of hypothermia has begun.  An approaching maintenance vehicle leads to the prospect of rescue, and Dan, Parker, and Lynch begin throwing their gear at the vehicle, hoping to attract the driver's attention. Unfortunately, it's all for naught, as the vehicle drives away, leaving the three still trapped on the lift.  Dan decides to jump down and go for help, but he breaks his legs and is left immobilized.  To make matters even worse, a pack of hungry wolves has moved in.

Down to two, Lynch decides that the best option would be for him to try to proceed, hand over hand, suspended from the bottom of the lift cable to the nearest lift tower and climb down the ladder to the ground.  After much exertion, Lynch makes it, but once again, the wolves are waiting.  Left alone and hanging from a now-broken lift seat, Parker jumps herself and manages to evade the wolves, but will she make it to safety, or will the wolves catch up to her in the end?

At first, I was expecting ""Frozen"" to be more on the lines of a traditional horror film, but after I got into it, I realized that it involved more psychological terror rather than blood and guts, and I liked it.  It was frightening watching Dan, Lynch, and Parker ride up the lift and then see all of the lights go out and the chair finally stop.  I've ridden on a chair lift before, and I would be really scared if it stopped moving and didn't start again.  Granted, the scenes with the wolves are rather bloody, but I enjoyed the psychological aspect very much.

I liked this movie.  I thought the story concept was interesting, and the acting is very good.  The scenes immediately after the lift stops are truly frightening, too.  If you're a fan of psychological terror, then be sure to watch ""Frozen""; it's really scary.",1298160000,,2577,4.512931034482759

But that's what I liked about it. Because it wasn't what I had expected. There are no scenes with the ppl loosing limbs or anything that you might typically associate with a horror film.

The performances were pretty good actually, my fav being the guy who played Lynch.

I will not explain every detail of this movie. But, the reason why it is so intense. Is because, it seemed so real. The way the guy broke his legs and got eaten alive by wolves.

4136221,5,B003L1ZWG2,"Frozen is a surprisingly exciting suspense about three teenagers who insist on taking just *one more* trip across the ski lifts.  Of course on this final occasion, it's growing increasingly dark and windy outside as a snowstorm is about to move in, but the teens ignore the obvious dangers and take the trip anyway... and what happens, rather predictably, is that they are totally screwed and become stuck.

The storyline really had me totally glued to the TV screen.  Of course a question you're probably asking yourself ""How can you base an entire plot around three people being stuck on a ski lift?""  Well, before the movie came on, I asked myself the same question.  Oh trust me faithful readers, I DID ask myself the same thing!  The answer?  By dragging out a few scenes for an extended period of time, such as when they sit and discuss childhood school memories and whatnot.  These segments take up quite a bit of time, though never enough to make me lose interest in what's taking place, however.

Some segments seemed totally unbelievable to me.  Would the wolves really catch up to the location so soon?  And would they attack when there's three people in distance?  The answer is...  I don't know.  I don't know enough about wolves to really confirm that one.  From an animals point of view, you'd think three people being around would send off a signal to back off and leave everybody alone, but I can't really say for sure that's entirely accurate.

I have to say the best performance goes to the teenage girl who's always feeling worried, concerned, and regretful.  The other two boys were kind of acting like total clueless idiots the whole time.

What in the HECK happened to the guy controlling the ski lifts?  Did he just completely forget about the teens?  Instead of making certain nobody was riding on the lifts, apparently he forgot all about them and instead turns his focus on another completely different segment.  Weird!

Overall, for a great piece of gripping suspense, perhaps Frozen borders on the cheesy side because the ski lift really isn't THAT high off the ground, but who knows- I've never actually been on a ski lift myself so perhaps there is quite a bit of danger.  Er... this isn't what I originally intended to say.

Oh right, for a gripping slice of potentially-fictional suspense, you really can't go wrong with Frozen.  And how appropriate I'm writing a review for this movie RIGHT in the middle of a severe icestorm in southeast Pennsylvania (where I live).

This film operates on the premise that every possible thing (and person) that could go wrong will.

The dialogue is mostly filler and, at times, inane.  After one of the characters finds out the result of trying one of the options above and the rather disjointed bodily results because of it he is amazingly coherent and conversational.

While it does a good job cinematically of tapping into that fear that arises anytime a person goes up on a chair lift (just like the fears arise when taking off in an airplane), once rational thought sets in it becomes clear that it is ultimately an exercise in incredulity.

The movie was all but over when the wolves became the main threat in the film...

These people are SO stupid.  One jumps with legs extended in a straight position and ends up with compound francture in both legs. That's before he get's eaten by wolves.  The two left start bickering and don't for one minute try to think out a practical reason on how to get down.  The second male crosses the cable by hand and because it is so sharp it rips his hands apart.  Finally, he makes it to a lift support and ladder, goes down, then starts down the mountain only to be eaten also by wolves.  The only female is left on the lift quickly getting frostbite only to have the seat rip from the cable and fall with her hanging on.

I was impressed with Shawn Ashmore and Emma Bell as well. This film should NOT be put in the horror genre, more like a suspence/survival thriller. Independant filmmaking may well be the only way Hollywood can still come up with semi-new ideas.

This is not a bad movie, but fails to deliver true emotion and hopelessness that movies such as ""Open Water"" have done successfully. It does stay interesting for the most part and is worth one view rather than a ""must own"" category. It also adds the element of dangerous wildlife to the mix, but I will let you see how that plays into everything. A good 3 star movie.",1295308800,2,717,4.311111111111111

Shawn Ashmore and Kevin Zegers are quite convincingh but it's Bell's turn that sticks with you long after viewing.  Her concern over her puppy's fate and her humiliation over wetting herself is heartwrenching.

A riveting, all-too plausible story that has both rich character development and grisly horror. Frozen is a taut horror-thriller that will have you cringing, screaming at the screen, and hoping for an impossible rescue.

Frozen is a gripping tale, expertly carried off by three actors in extremely tight surroundings. In just 90 minutes, we come to know them as people, care about their survival, and mourn their fate. Though their actions prove ill-fated, they seem logical in such a desperate situation; we can imagine doing the same, having the same ideas racing through our minds as we are freezing to death, blown about by the wind in a tiny cocoon of cold steel.",1294876800,,823,4.795774647887324
4136248,3,B003L1ZWG2,"While I enjoyed Frozen for its intense and gripping story, I also couldn't get past some rather unconvincing elements in the film. The actors are believable, but they do things that seem very abnormal. I will provide a list.

THE CONS
1) It's freezing out and yet the character are sitting with there faces exposed and even have their coats zipped down to expose their bare necks!? Any normal person would cover as much of their bare skin as possible. A wool hat can be stretched down to cover most of your face and those ski jackets have huge over sized collars that will cover up half of you head. This really took me out of the film as it just seemed very unrealistic.

2) When the plow is right under them they do not react normally. If you believe you're stranded, you thrown things at the window of the plow which is right below you! HELLO! .....not a glove a freakin' ski pole right through the window!

3)Jumping from the Ski lift!? OK... The first thing I thought of was to climb the cable back to the ladder on the support pole. If you were to jump you would at the very least hang down by your hands on the seat or someone's legs, maybe even make some sort of rope from your scarves to make the jump 40 feet instead of 60 feet.

4) When the girl falls asleep, she has her bare hand on the metal bar instead of her gloved hand?

There are more little instances like these that keep this film from being as good as it should have been.

THE PROS
1)Intense moments with fairly solid acting.

2)Solid effects and fast paced story.

****SPOILER ALERT!****

3)People get eaten by wolves!

*****END OF SPOILER*****

I know that it's only a movie and I enjoyed it regardless of its flaws, but if the filmmakers had thought this one out a little better, this could have one of the most unforgettable thrillers in a long time.

Open Water is a much more believable film and much better too, but if you like these types of films this one is certainly worth checking out.",1294790400,3,1970,4.352459016393443
4136249,1,B003L1ZWG2,"There are some gruesome and suspenseful moments that qualify this as a thriller more than a horror.  But overall the plot seems too unrealistic. No park would shut down that fast.  It would take hours with clean-up staff, etc.  And, come on, the resort is really closed all week to the employees?  No regular staffers to handle phone calls, upcoming reservations or other business tasks?  The last staffer to go doesn't notice an unclaimed car in the parking lot?  No cell phones?  Really?  In this day and age?  Man eating wolves in New England?  And, it seems like these 20 somethings didn't have patience or brains.  Just wait until morning at least & get a fix on your surroundings before making stupid impulsive decisions.  Zip up your clothes and use huddle techniques to conserve warmth.  These college kids seemingly can't think or use their brains!

So many things I'd love to comment on, but won't because it would create spoilers.  Overall, it's a cheesy film with some taut moments.  If the obvious matters to you then this film will drive you nuts at how completely that is overlooked.  Maybe fun to rent on a slow rainy day to watch with friends just to pass some time.

4136250,3,B003L1ZWG2,"As an avid skier, I identified very throughly with the plight of the three hapless protagonists in Frozen. Sure, they were all pretty bad actors (the boyfriend especially) and they weren't given a whole lot of good dialogue to work with. Their peril however, made up for it completely and set this film apart from the myriad tiny-locale suspense films recently (Buried, The Ruins, Panic Room). This film, it should be noted, is by no means a technical success. The opening scenes look like they were shot by college students. There aren't any special effects (thankfully no CGI) really, save a couple bloody, bloody wounds- which looked great. Ultimately, this is a film that relies heavily on the cold tension of its situation and all sorts of natural, organic elements to pin you to your seat. There is no killer or anything like that, despite a strange scene early on where the camera focuses on a MISSING PERSON poster...what was that all about? Inside joke?
  Compared to say, The Ruins, the film isn't super-gory, though I did cover my eyes once or twice. If you aren't a fan of frostbite or broken bones, stay far away. Really I am at a loss for why I liked this flick so much (maybe it was the really stark but cool credits?). Bad acting. Bad writing. Little emotion. And yet I've ridden chairlifts that stopped halfway up a deserted precipice and thought, ""My God, if we were stuck here overnight that would be the worst thing in the world."" Frozen takes those fears and wrings every last bit of horror out of them.

Yes, the cable is razor sharp...so use the ski pole with your hands gripping a couple of inches apart to zip-line down to the pole with the ladder on it.

Fantastic! I love these ""what do you do in this situation"" types of stories. This premise is unsettling enough. The writers should not have added the wolves into the story. Should. Not. Have. Done. That.

In this day and age of sophisticated audiences, there is not one human being on the Earth who still acribes to the ""big bad wolf"" mentality. There is enough scientific data to disprove wolves attacking people in the wilderness. The story completely jumped the shark at that point and left me very disappointed. The writers needed to have more faith in their initial story because they really didn't need another ""villian"" to spice things up.

If they HAD to add an villian, a bear is a much more plausible choice because bears WILL attack and kill people.

Anyway, good story - could have been so much better minus the ""wolves as baddies"" ploy. I know too much about wolves in real life. I didn't buy it for a second and it detracted from the film.",1294185600,4,1127,4.597014925373134
4136333,4,B003L1ZWG2,"This is going to be a short review, at least for me, because I want to be very sure not to spoil any significant plot developments.  FROZEN is a neat, creepy little thriller with a very simple plot but very effective technique.  If you want a low-key heart-pounder and something a little offbeat...check it out.

Three friends, Parker , her boyfriend Dan and his best friend Joe are out for a day of low-budget skiing and snowboarding.  They bicker a little bit, because Parker is a newbie and Joe resents not getting to really enjoy some tricky hills because she's holding them up.  Thus, they beg the lift operator to let them go up one last time as darkness is falling.  Through circumstance and miscommunication, the lift is shut off just as the three friends reach the highest point.  And then the ski area shuts down for the week, leaving the friends stranded in the freezing cold, possibly for 5 days.

What will they do?  No cell phones.  No way to catch the ear or eye of anyone.  Just frostbite, cold, lethargy and death staring them in the face.  Naturally, grievances are aired and both the best and worst of each person is revealed.  Extreme choices will be made, and not all will go well.

That's it...you're getting no more details from me.  If this plot sounds a little like OPEN WATER on a ski-lift, I can't argue with that.  But the dynamics are handled differently...and there's more these 3 can TRY to do to help themselves.  I appreciated that although in hindsight many of their decisions could have been better, no one acted like complete idiots just so bad things could happen.  They acted with relatively believable logic, particularly considering the extreme stress.

Writer/director  Adam Green has constructed a nifty, scary little tale and handled it well.  He had, clearly, a low budget, but for the most part, it is not noticeable.  There's little need for special effects, and the when they are used, they are sparing.  Once in awhile, I wish the editor had cut away about a quarter second sooner, as a few of the cheapie seams showed.  But not enough to detract.  What Green does well is keep the prime location (a dangling ski lift) interesting and foreboding.  Although the friends are trapped in the great wide open...they are really trapped in a cramped, uncomfortable and completely exposed lift.  Green's script is serviceable as well.  The film is a brisk 90 minutes, but it is still certainly padded with some ""character development"" type dialogue of the ""I remember when I was a kid"" variety.  Without it, the film would not be feature length.  With it, it's occasionally clunky.  This is a failing of this kind of film all the time...they are damned if they don't develop characters, but they often fail to do a smooth job of it when they try.  This film doesn't completely succeed either...but it's better than most.  The desire to do a good job all round and NOT insult the intelligence of the viewer was much appreciated by me.

The three stars, who must carry the film, are okay.  None are fantastic thespians, but again, each is just slightly better than one usually gets in such a film.  Emma Bell (recently featured in THE WALKING DEAD) is Parker, and she captures the peppy spirit of the girl when things are safe, and the abject terror when things go wrong.  As Dan, Kevin Zegers (who I remember from his small role in the excellent DAWN OF THE DEAD remake) does well with the most two-dimensional character.  Best of all is Shawn Ashmore (""Iceman"" in X-MEN), who has to take an initially unlikeable character and make us care about him.

FROZEN is not as flat-out terrifying and brilliant as THE DESCENT...but its straightforward approach and surprising effectiveness recalled that wonderful film.  FROZEN will not rock your world, but it will provide a chill or two.  A pleasant surprise!",1294185600,2,3842,4.725903614457831

Being trapped on a chair lift is something that anyone who's ever ridden on has pondered.  If you have, you probably have as many theories as I do about how you would extract yourself from that situation.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers lack the creativity to figure out how to make even this good idea last a mere 93 minutes.  Instead, after a genuinely tense 30 minutes or so, the film introduces wolves.  Yes, wolves.  Because being trapped on a chairlift overnight in a blizzard isn't really that scary, so we need to introduce a way to possibly be eaten.  At that point the film, which up to there had me engrossed in it's tension, totally lost me.  A pack of wolves?  On a ski resort?  In New England?!

From there on out the movie just becomes more and more tedious and boring, and every time it gets the most extremely boring, the wolves show up again, as the plot devices that they are.

So if you accept situations presented to you and you can sustain the belief without asking any nagging questions, then it's a movie to pass time with. But there are certain junctures where the characters made certain decisions that seem to serve stretching a movie out to 90 minutes.  Are these kids just young and inexperienced?  For the amount of times one boy boasts of experiences from the past semesters, we are to believe they are college kids.  But either the quality of college education isn't what it used to be, or the Darwin awards are at work here.

I watched this movie with two 40-something guys, and they were basically tearing their hair out throughout the movie.  There's no sense of urgency at advancing nightfall, frostbite, hypothermia.  When the sun is up and it is warm, people chat and talk.  Decisions are made to act only near night time when the mercury drops.  Jackets are not zipped all the way to the top, up to the full length of the zippers.  Hands are left bare, out in the open, when they should be tucked inside to retain warmth.  People should cuddle to sustain body heat. None of this takes place.

If I knew it was going to be five more days before the resort opened.  I would say ""everyone, take off your jackets and pants  (they are the tough synthetic material ski apparel are made from these days that don't rip easily).  Tie it end-to-end and let one person slide halfway down the makeshift ""rope"" to the bottom.  Take a leap, tuck-and-roll.  Pull the shirts / pants back up, put the clothing on, throw the guy his clothes on the bottom, and the guy goes for help. End of story.",1292716800,17,1719,4.525974025974026

They don't think about zipping jackets or to jump from a distance & try landing on your back instead of your legs.  These are just young people out for a good time and are immature not thinking about any consequences for their actions.  It has slow parts but I do recommend this movie if you can rent it cheap and just can't find anything else to watch.  It may be a little too graphic for some in places but not gorey.  Just shows details of injuries which those who are very squimish may want to close their eyes in parts.  It's not very original but nowadays what movies are?  If you watch the movie with the concept that these are immature young people and not 'survivalists' then I think you'll get more out of it.

4136383,4,B003L1ZWG2,"The plot is quite simple, three young people are stranded on a ski lift on Sunday evening and face a multi-day ordeal in freezing temperatures. This is a horror movie but very familiar, natural sources of the horror: extreme cold, great height, and hungry wolves. No lunatics with chain saws, no superhuman mutant psychopaths in ski masks, simply Mother Nature at her worst. In most such movies, the young victims can be counted on to make all sorts of idiotic mistakes and illogical moves, but in this one the beleaguered trio behave much like ""normal"" people (i.e. you and I) would in this situation. Another plus is that the film does not exploit bloody violence, nudity and gratuitous sex, foul language, or any other of the cliches inevitably found in movies of this genre. I found the female lead, Emma Bell, to be attractive, wholesome, humorous, and quite likable. Indeed, the viewer quickly becomes involved in the plot and with all three actors, sharing in their suffering, sacrifice, and (minor) triumphs.

The plot is reminiscent of Open Water and relies heavily upon close ups of the three stars, their dialog, and interaction. This requires a good script, capable actors, and a completely realistic environment, which is provided (in spades) by filming at night, in freezing temperatures on a snowy mountain in Utah.
I think about half of the suffering evident in the actor's faces and voices was real and not ""acting"" at all. This must have been quite an ordeal to produce, and in my opinion it was worth it, because the viewer shares completely in every realistic, harrowing, agonizing second.

4136385,3,B003L1ZWG2,"In 2003, a little independent movie entitled OPEN WATER opened in theatres. That movie cost less than a million dollars and ended up raking up more than thirty-million dollars in the U.S. alone.  Though the idea of a small group of people being stranded in a harsh environment has been along for decades, OPEN WATER pushed the idea to the extremes.  What would you do if you were unexpectedly stranded in the middle of the ocean with only your scuba gear? The movie attempts to examine what people would actually be capable of and the challenges and horrors they might face.

OPEN WATER is mentioned because FROZEN is basically an artic or winter version of OPEN WATER.  The plot of the movie revolves around a group of three people:  Joe Lynch (Shawn Ashmore), Dan Walker (Kevin Zegers), and Parker O'Neil (Emma Bell).  Walker and Lynch have been best friends most their lives and Parker is Walker's latest girlfriend.  Walker and Lynch have been planning this snowboarding trip for nearly a year and Lynch is a bit upset that Walker decided to bring her along.  Lynch doesn't like Parker and though it's never implicitly stated Walker seems like he's probably going to break-up with Parker after the weekend.  The trio uses Parker's feminine charms to get all three of them onto the ski-lift for a bribe.  That's the first strike against them because there's no official record of them being there.  Late at night, the group goes for one last ride on the lift.  However, there's a severe blizzard heading in and the ski lift operator trades places with someone else. A bit of miscommunication ensues and Walker, Llynch, and Parker suddenly find themselves alone, stuck on the lift, in the middle of an oncoming blizzard.  They soon realize that the lift won't be open for at least five more days and they have been abandoned.  What follows is an examination of human survival.

FROZEN is labeled and marketed as a horror movie, but it's really more of a suspense film.  There are some moments of gore, but not as much as there could be.  The filmmakers were wise in that regard and don't show any of the most horrifying moments (though there is one that can distinctively be heard).

The acting in the movie is very well done which is a very good thing because the movie spends almost all of its time with the three main characters.  Had the acting been bad, FROZEN would have been a terrible movie.  As it stands, it's not too bad.  The idea it presents is an interesting one and the movie attempts to portray in a realistic manner the inherent problems and dangers of each of the solutions to the characters' dilemma.  FROZEN isn't for everyone.  There's a lot of talk that outside of the situation would seem banal, there isn't much action, and for horror fans there isn't much gore.  Still, the movie does have some strong acting and good character development.  I wasn't expecting much out of the movie before I saw and afterwards I found that I had enjoyed it.

The DVD includes a four-part making-of featurette, the trailer for the movie, commentary with the director and three stars, and deleted scenes.",1291593600,5,3113,4.697416974169742

A somewhat unique take on the horror/suspense/thriller genre. There were genuine moments where I felt for the main characters and their plight. The first time watching this movie really grabs you, subsequent viewings a bit less (as you already know the outcome) but it still remains a striking story even after multiple viewings

Video:
very good. Lots of fine detail to be seen, especially in the snowy landscape. There are some scenes at night but delineation remains strong with very good black levels. No detail gets lost because of overshadowing blacks.

Audio:
I thought I was there! The lossless audio track really uses the seperate channels effectively to simulate the sound of wind blowing through the room or the sound of animals coming from a certain direction. People with a home theater will enjoy this one!

I was pretty impressed overall. The production values were impressive. I had expected low-budget type effects, sets, etc. and it was much better. The acting performances were convincing and I can't say anything negative about them at all.

The story line overall actually does hold up to reasonable scientific scrutiny, save for a couple of minor elements that with a little tweaking would be almost flawless. It's a fairly realistic hypothetical plot and clearly someone thought out possible criticisms before they finished writing it.

Overall, I'd say it's a pretty good film. I'll probably buy this one. It was worth the rental and kept my attention. That said, this is probably not the movie for everyone. It's a little gory and will make you cringe a few times. Not everyone enjoys the suspenseful style of being stranded and waiting to die of the elements either. For some, it might be lacking in more substance to the plot, which admittedly can be a little sluggish here and there, but not for long. And there will always be the nay-sayers that are determined to believe it's impossible or they would have a perfect, fool-proof way out.

I hope the following isn't a spoiler, but as you can guess from the cover of the DVD, three people are stuck on a ski lift hundreds of feet in the air.

The moment the film turns stupid however, is when they start throwing their winter clothes at the bypassing vehicle to get its attention. They could have thrown their skis or trecking polls... but no, they throw their gloves.

After an hour or so of sitting up there one of the guys gets this great idea to jump down. Naturally he breaks his legs and doesnt bleed out... which I found hilarious and medically impossible. The shock alone and normal bloodloss from a break that severe would have you dead before the wolves would come. (never mind the freezing temps, and how blood loss would cause your body temp and blood pressure to drop quickly)

I guess you could say I was bored after that... the constant screaming and crying was best watched with the mute button on.

I figure the movie is good for a date nght or cheap thrill, when you hope to console your scared girly by putting an arm around her. Thats why I suppose I give it two stars... as for the rest of it, it didn't hold my attention.",1290729600,2,1285,4.319502074688796

For anybody who has snowboarded or skied, the topic always comes up about how would you get off the lift if you were stuck. This movie goes through this whole scenario. It puts you on that ski chair, at night, knowing that nobody will be there to save you. It does a very good job at it, and throws out many situations that could happen.

I think the negative reviews comes from the fact that many people want to movie to seem as real as possible. There were many things that went wrong, which would seem to be impossible for it all to happen in real life. However, you have to understand that the directors wanted the movie to be interesting and to throw in many horror situations.

Since you really feel for the characters, you will sit back and say why don't they do this, or why did they do that. Like when they let their faces be exposed to the cold instead of covering up. But you have to understand, they could not make a movie where they had their faces inside their jackets the whole time. The director had to make obvious decisions to make the movie more appealing.

Frozen is low budget and it's obvious from the start. The writing is mediocre at best, fortunately the acting makes up for it a little. Ashmore, Zegers, and Emma Bell have a lot of chemistry and their dialogue kept the movie going through the not so interesting parts.

You might be wondering how I could possibly give a good review to a movie where I have criticized several key aspects. The answer lies in the suspense. This movie, while unrealistic is not impossible. This adds an element of suspense that you might not find in a cheap slasher movie.

DVD Extras *****

I thought this was going to be your average B-movie, and I love B-movies. Although at times it felt like a feature-length very special episode of ""I Shouldn't Be Alive,"" I admired the filmmakers' premise and their determination to make a (literally) chilling movie. The three young leads, especially Parker, acted their parts credibly and with realism. There was quite a bit of existential dialogue and relationship discussions, but when you're freezing to death on top of a ski lift and death is all around, life gets reduced to its essentials. Survival, connection, love. Dan, his girlfriend Parker and ""third wheel"" buddy Joe lynch are the unlikely trio that must survive being stranded on a chair lift after the entire ski mountain shuts down for the weekend. It's ""Wind chill"" on a ski lift, with ominous atmospheric music, creaking ski equipment and a treatise on the perils of smoking.

And, of course, there are wolves.

I did find an ""Easter Egg"" in one of the DVD menus, and enjoyed the commentaries as well as a real-life ""ghost story"" on set.",1289865600,,1083,4.8432432432432435
4136419,5,B003L1ZWG2,"Frozen... what is there to say that hasn't been said? Well, firstly, I am seeing a few five star ratings- this is the scariest thing about Frozen in my opinion. The movie Frozen follows a group of young adults (and I use the term adult sparingly) who are on a weekend retreat to ski and snowboard. This trip soon goes from fun to frightening when they play a trick on a lodge employee and are later left stranded many feet in the air awaiting rescue from what will be a weekend affair in the air.

The negatives start from the very beginning. The acting is believable- but the scenario and cliches that are toyed with that spoil the 'plot' of this film. It all is just so terribly over exaggerated. The worse part is just that they keep piling thing after thing up and making it more and more ridiculous as it goes on- making it impossible for you to 1: Take any of the movie seriously and 2: Keep a straight face. Honestly, I saw this only because I knew how terrible it'd be. The price of the ticket is as much as a blu-ray. That alone is enough of a sign that this movie is nothing other than utter failure.

I'm trying so hard to not spoil anything but it's so hard. The things I wish I could convey in this review are just... oh goodness.

Honestly, I am going to leave it at this: If you have 15 dollars that you don't need or want another funny movie in your collection, or are a big fan of cheesy horror- then buy this. Honestly, despite how terrible this movie was, it did exactly what was intended. It entertained me to no end. So, if you have some time to waste and money to go along with that time- please... do yourself a favor and get this movie.",1289692800,3,1660,4.197492163009405
4136420,5,B003L1ZWG2,"After the successful run of ""Open Water,"" a small-budget and smart film in which the main characters are subjected to unimaginable situations in real life, it was expected that some moviemakers would think about similar scenarios to tell a good, frightening story. ""Frozen"" follows this pattern, and brings us another gruesome and penetrating story that will surely stay with you for some time after you leave the theater.

Joe (Shawn Ashmore), Dan (Kevin Zegers), and Parker (Emma Bell), Dan's girlfriend, are three friends that decide to go skiing during the weekend. However, the weather is getting worse, and it's not such a good idea to do so after all. But they insist. For their apparent good luck, they manage to convince the gatekeeper of the mountain lift, who warned them about the incoming storm, to allow them to have one more ride. The gatekeeper tells them that he would grant them one more ride only, and they happily accept. Everything is going well until, you guessed, due to a tragic mistake, the mountain lift stops in the middle of nowhere, and they are stranded in their chair lift, about fifty feet high from the ground. Once they realize that the chair was not moving anymore, they try to figure out a way to get help. They have to think and take action fast, because it is dark, cold, and the storm is on the way. Add to this the fact that it is Sunday night and the ski resort would be closed for the next five days. Ah, and there are hungry wolves on the ground, too. Mix these ingredients and you have a rollercoaster of fear.

Ably directed and written by Adam Green, ""Frozen"" is ingenious, captivating and scary. It puts you on the spot, and makes you ask yourself what you would do if you were ever caught in that situation. The remarkable Blu-ray edition of the film features audio commentaries by Green, Ashmore, Zegers, and Bell, as well as cinematographer Will Barratt and editor Ed Marx. It also includes deleted scenes, making-of documentaries, and more. (USA, 2010, color, 93 min plus additional material)

4136421,4,B003L1ZWG2,"Freddie Kruger doesn't scare me.  Neither does Jason Voorhees or any of the other boogiemen that populate the Cineplex.  Sure they can make me jump once or twice, but they do not haunt my dreams long after the movie has ended.  What scares me is something that could actually happen.  Thankfully I do not ski because Frozen would have kept me off any chairlift for the foreseeable future.

The plot is simple, three friends sneak their way on a chairlift one more time to get another run in before the mountain shuts down only for them to get stuck halfway up the mountain when no one realizes they are still on it.  Making matters worse it is Sunday and the slopes do not reopen until Friday.  Then the movie asks, ""What would you do?""

The movie has some slow spot and surprisingly most of them do not come on the chairlift that makes up eighty percent of the movie.  What Frozen does a good job with if feeling the same fear that those three on the lift are feeling especially as they mull over their decisions, each more dangerous that the previous one.  Much of this comes from some excellent casting, most notably Emma Bell who was a great find.  If you are a fan of the horror / suspense genre, Frozen is a must see, unless of course you plan on going skiing ever again.

The DVD also comes with a few interesting behind the scenes featurettes that shows that yes, this movie was film on location at a real ski resort during winter, and that the actors were really up there without an aid of green screen.  One of the featurettes even gives you a weather report for each day of filming just to show how cold it got.",1289001600,,1622,4.348837209302325

As I watched the movie I could vividly remember just how cold I was, especially on one of the lifts, and I was only on it for about two hours.  I don't know if you could actually live as long as these kids did in zero, sub-zero temps and blizzardy conditions but..

All in all, this was a very well done movie.  The character studies were done very well and the interactions were very true to life - girlfriend, boyfriend, long time buddy of the boyfriend.

It just goes to show you that you don't need huge budgets, major special effects or computer graphics, zombies, vampires or other kinds of make-believe monsters for a story to be scary.  Mother nature and human nature are scary enough!",1288915200,,787,4.3561643835616435

If the ski slopes operated only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, what would happen if you were stranded on a ski lift on Sunday night and the operators would not be returning until the following weekend? This is the premise behind ` Frozen' Three friends take a ski trip to a remote mountain in New England ( Utah, actually), throughout the weekend these skiing enthusiasts never get a chance to do some real skiing, so on Sunday decide to go for one last downhill trip. The life operator due to a shift change forgets about these friends and thus they are stuck on the halfway point on the life with no one to help them. The film then follows their struggles and fight for survival against wild life and nature's brute fury.
I liked this movie because there is a minimal amount of CGI and locations, the entire action takes place on a ski life, this could have been boring and tedious but these actors do a fine job conveying first the anguish, depression and ultimately fighting to surviving very well. Infact during the final scenes, the events become so drastic and tragic, that you may well find yourself rooting for them to win.

Adam Green is a good filmmaker from what I have come to gather, some people love him others not so much. You may remember a little Slasher movie maybe you have heard of it, a kick back to the days of Slasher glory called ""Hatchet"". I have heard both sides on that film from those who like it and those who don't, as for me, that is a review for another day. Maybe you have heard of ""Spiral"" or a really good one he produced called ""Grace"", that one was really good. Either way this new one of his is actually different then what you would expect from the creator of ""the next icon of horror"" [hope I got that quote correct].

Two childhood friends Lynch [Shawn Ashmore] and Dan [Kevin Zegers] along side Dan's girlfriend Parker [Emma Bell] go snowboarding and skiing over the weekend like they do it seems all the time. Of course the girlfriend kinda invited herself because she wants to be involved in everything Dan does. Naturally this does not sit well with Lynch who misses the old days of him and his buddy just hanging out, good old fashioned guy time. When a girl who works at the resort that normally lets the guys ski for free is not working that day Parker is sent in to persuade the guy to let them go up the mountain. It eventually works and they spend the day going down the easy slopes for Parker.

By the time the place is getting ready to close they decide they want to make one more run, this time down some real slopes. Lynch is upset he had to make his way down the easy ones all day. The same guy is there and decides they make one more run, after they go up he is called off and a different guy takes over. That guy mistakes another group of three that come down as them and shuts the ski lift off. The three are calm at first but soon panic surfaces as they realize they are stuck 30-60ft off the ground.

This is actually a very good movie and does a great job making you feel what these people go through. Writer/director Adam Green did an excellent job here from shooting this to pulling off the tension of the film. But with that said I think his biggest strong point here was the script, these three feel like real people. From the ""oh they will get it running"" to the strong feeling of panic these are real people. I honestly thought the characters and dialogue were very spot on; I really think this is how most people would react. Even from what Dan does to afterwards realizing ""we can climb the cable and make it to the ladder"", when people panic the do the crazy first thing that comes to mind thing first, like jump. It is afterwards usually that in hindsight you realize there were other options, I liked that here.

The actors were very good in this as well as they played easily off one another, especially after they were stuck. It is from this point on that the bond between the three really showcases. The relationship between boyfriend and girlfriend and boyfriend's best friend is great, I have actually went through his kinda thing with my girl and best friend when they first met. All three were great here but in my opinion show stealer award goes to Shawn Ashmore as Lynch, really liked his performance here.

From the wolves to the tension everything was really good here except one thing, the ending. I really thought it would have been a much better ending if what happened did not, as in the opposite happens. To read any further would be a spoiler so turn back now, you have been warned. Now for those who have seen it feel free to give me your take on this and leave a comment. As you [reader who has seen this movie] know both guys fail to make it by the end of this movie but both die trying to save the others. Dan is first when after his jump he breaks his leg and is eventually eaten by the wolves. Lynch is next trying to save Parker [whom he really didn't get along with at first] as he cuts his hands to shreds climbing that cable and making it to the ladder. Of course after he boards down a little [slowly] we find out the wolves got him as well. Now all that is well and good I suppose since this that kinda movie, but why does Parker make it.

She did nothing to help the entire movie really and one could even argue that she kinda caused this. Now I wouldn't really say that because Lynch [even though it was just for his friend] did agree to her coming but I can see the case. Any way she doesn't even have to jump a horrible amount of ft or climb to the ladder on razor sharp cable. No she gets to jump off at a much safer distance after the ski lift can't hold her weight any more [even though two more even heavier people are no longer on there]. Then she makes her way down the mountain and even stumbles across a pack of wolves eating Lynch, one even face to face. Do they attack her like any creature would being not only surprised by someone falling next to them but also to protect their kill, no they let her walk on. Then she falls onto an icy road with her head sticking out there ready to be run over, and no the person does slide on the ice but only to turnaround and get her.

What ever the reason for the ending that is really my only complaint with it, other than that I do highly recommend this movie. The DVD has some great special features so check those out as well, and enjoy the flick. Adam Green I think will be making a huge hit some time in the future [I mean that in a mainstream top of the charts box office way, he has already achieved that on an independent level] if he keeps making films like this. I say go ahead and get this movie it is worthy of your collection, but try out the rental, it may lead you to seeing his other films.",1288483200,2,5638,4.199445983379501

4136457,4,B003L1ZWG2,"Long after viewing Frozen I'm still feeling its effects, so I'm compelled to write this review. The plot of ""Frozen"" is pretty simple as far as thrillers go. Three friends go on a snowboarding trip where they happen to get stuck on a ski lift. The ski resort is closing for the week and it just so happens to be Sunday night so basically, they're screwed. As the hours pass, and the weather worsens, the poor saps are forced into making drastic and ultimately deadly decisions in order to survive. Much like ""Open Water"" before it, ""Frozen"" is able to pull off being very simple but compelling which is central to its charm. While watching ""Frozen"" you can't help but put yourself in the characters shoes because the premise, while not probable is not imposable. I really enjoyed ""frozen"", while the plot maybe too simplistic and predicable for some, it had just enough emotional substance to keep me watching. I found myself guessing what would happen to the characters but kept watching just to see it unfold, so I think the film succeeded in what it was attempting to do. So, ""Frozen"" is definitely worth viewing. It won't dazzle you with special effects or keep you on the edge of your seat but it has just enough action and some pretty nasty scenes to make it a solid thriller.

4136459,2,B003L1ZWG2,"Thriller and horror films never accurately portrayed smart people doing the intelligent thing in any given situation and, despite all the hype and hoopla, the film Frozen doesn't really bring anything new to the table.

The premise of the film is simple, predictable, and unrelenting in its ability to have the characters do the absolute worst things possible in a survival situation beyond sneaking up a ski lift right at closing time.  Idiots.  Just to make sure I wasn't being to harsh on the film I brought along an expert witness, a former USAF Pararescue Jumper with an emphasis in arctic survival, to rate the realism of the film or, in this instance, the severe lack thereof.

He found error after error and not just the plain stupidity of the characters but in the lack of realism of the survivability of humans against a winter setting with natural wildlife.  Errors included how much quicker frostbite would have settled in to how Frozen depicted a grossly uncharacteristic portrayal of wild wolves and coyotes.

Regardless of the poor quality of the film itself I feel as though I should throw it some charity and comment on the decent acting jobs of the rather obscure casting crew that got stuck doing this high school film.  I may never had heard of them, but at least they didn't bog the script down any more than it did already.

I saw this film originally at Sundance in Jan 10. The director warned us before the film began, that if anyone in the audience felt sick, or needed to leave during the screening - they should do so immediately. Apparently they had numerous incidents of this happening during the premiere and at other screenings. I am not faint of heart - and I simply LOVED this movie. So much so that I desperately tried to see it again and marked my calendar for the DVD release. I am hosting a screening of this in my home on Saturday night.

4136540,1,B003L1ZWG2,"Let me cut to the chase. This movie is mostly awful... boring dialogue making it really bad. But it IS realistic.  How you ask? By portraying the vapid stupidity of the typical 18-20 something of our world today. Having lived in New England I can attest that the average 20 something there is an idiot... but then again, I've seen similar stupidity elsewhere so locality is of little consequence.  Of course if kids grow up in the north country it can often be a different story where they have some native smarts.  These kids in this movie are clearly flat-landers without a clue.  Unfortunately in our world today, the typical kid learns stupidity in school (for example, they know all about sex and drugs but can't walk on the correct side of a back country road).

What sets this movie apart is that it really explores the complete empty-headedness of this age group today. From failing to properly protect their faces from frostbite, to thinking that a guy in a snow cat would look almost vertical into the darkness to see if anyone was dangling on a chair, to failing to use the items at hand to lessen the drop so as to make a descent from the chair more survivable; all of these things demonstrate how DUMB the typical 20 something is today. Their dialogue, all centered round their narcissistic selves, only highlights how empty the gray matter is between their ears.  At one point I fast forwarded through this empty dialogue in order to reach some decision point to bring this futility to an end. These three, if the story had been real, would have been hands down favorites for Darwin Awards.

All I can say is, if you have teenagers, please teach them some real world skills instead of relying on the worthless ""educrat"" system to do so.  Otherwise your kids will end up like these idiots.",1287360000,9,1802,4.609375
4136561,4,B003L1ZWG2,"This is an ""Open Water"" stranding in mid-air. Rather than being left behind in the ocean by a scuba-diving excursion boat - the main characters in this movie are left dangling on a ski lift. The temperature is plummeting; there's a storm coming on; other dangers of the wild circle beneath them.

I didn't find this movie to be quite as affecting as ""Open Water,"" but it still held my interest and did a good job of delivering some literal chills.

As I was watching the characters' dilemma, I wondered how much of the atmosphere was CGI-generated. The extensive commentaries and bonus features on this DVD answer that question and are worth listening to.

It turns out that a lot of the action is authentic. The people involved in making this movie didn't feel that any actors could credibly simulate being cold to the bone. So they scouted an abandoned ski lodge and ski lift operation and partially reactivated the works. As a result, the actors didn't have to ACT their pain and peril all that much.

Many of the scenes that critics of this movie scoffed at as being the most obviously fabricated - were actually the most genuinely experienced exposures. For example, some critics based their pronouncements of ""Fake"" on the fact that the actors' breath isn't visible as they exhale into the cold. But those moments when viewers don't see clouds of ""smoke"" rising from the actors are just the moments when the actors truly are dangerously cold. The Director reminds us how the steam coming from our mouths on a cold day is generated by the contrast between our warm breath and the surrounding cold. The cold condenses in midair the warm moisture we exhale. However, as people get colder and colder, as their body temperature goes down, the very breath they exhale becomes almost as cold as their surroundings. No contrast in temperature - no condensation.

Some of the goriest, most frightening scenes in the movie were in fact artificially staged and provoked though. I won't ruin the surprise by mentioning exactly what those scenes involve, but suffice it to say they set back the reassurances of most animal rights advocates by a century. I don't believe that such situations actually have occurred, at least not with the concerted ferocity depicted.

But for the most part, this movie realistically puts you in the shoes (or in this case the ski boots) of the characters, and will probably leave you with a tingly dread of ""what if this kind of thing should ever happen to me.""",1287360000,,2486,4.769767441860465

Bribing the ski lift ticket man for just one more ride up the mountain at the end of his shift. Then when the ski lift ticket keeper takes a break to use the restroom, the man relays the message to his shift relief that there's three more skiers on the mountain, and not to stop the ski lift. When the new ticket man sees three skiers, he assumes those were the last skiers and turns off the ski lift, and abandons the mountain for the next five days due to terrible storms ahead. Needless to say the three young adults are stranded on the ski lift way in the air, and no one in sight to help them. Knowing they will be stuck there for the next five days, one young man decides to jump down off the lift, only to break both his legs, and stressing out the two remaining stranded man and woman.

4136565,3,B003L1ZWG2,"Frozen

When a suspense film elects to keep everything realistic, that is to rely on real world conditions and threats over supernatural ones to create the horror and fear, one of the risks taken by the filmmakers is believability.  In Frozen, the low budget effort detailing the experiences of thee college aged friends trapped on a ski lift, potentially for a week, the situation and feeling of being trapped is well done, but the way the kids get into the situation stretches credibility beyond thin. Their hounding by a pack of wolves and poorly writen dialouge further weakens the effort as a whole.  The film is, as many of these cheaper creations tend to be, over acted, too situational, and appears molded out of a set of conditions (I can get us access to a ski resort ski lift, we have enough money for a crane, and my buddy knows this guy who has trained wolves - what could we do with that?) rather than being a fully created story first. Anyone who skis regularly will be sharing looks of ""that would not happen"" throughout the first half hour of this film.

Despite the absence of ski patrols, following basic protocol, seat lifting, and a myriad of other oddities in the set up, once you get the archtype characters stuck on the lift, you get a stretch of story-telling that is very effective.  The need to escape leads to desperate actions, and it is in these moments that you finally connect with the human inside each character. You don't really need to bother to know the names of the victims here. They are played as types. The Boyfriend, his Best Friend, and the Girlfriend - who has changed the relationship between the males with her very presence. Go ahead, place your bets, which one will go first?  If you can't pick it, you have not watched much TV. Of course the first one down does it the dumb way and really gets hurt.  This section of the film is the best 30 minutes, enough to lift the film from a ""don't bother"" to a ""maybe you should"".  Once the wolves show up, however, the plot doesn't thicken so much as freezes. Silly angry moments (did they choose the actors rejected from 90210?)  and a very big ""Maybe the should have tried that first"" moment makes the final 30 of this effort a head scratcher, though the last one's method of escape is a nice moment of irony worth the wait.  If you are a guy who has a gal who is a little too terrified by horror film, this has enough fearful moments in it to get some ""hold me"" hugs, making this a good ""date"" film if you've been together for a while.

I would not recommend the film as something you should own, but as a rental - it's ok.  If you expected some rad skiing and boarding however, you came to the wrong ski slope.",1287187200,6,2704,4.407630522088353

I would give you a synopsis but in theory you've made it this far so you know the gist: two guys and a girl worm their way onto a ski lift as the park is closing for ""one last ride"" and the park then closes for the week with them still on the lift, suspended high in the air during a storm.

When I saw the previews for this movie earlier in the year I wanted to see it since I enjoyed Open Water and I saw this movie as one in similar plot to that.  I'm allergic to cold temperatures (no, I am not kidding, I am) so this is my own personal hell and would be a living nightmare for me.  Sadly unlike Open Water I didn't feel like I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie nor did I ever really believe they were in danger.

My major gripe is that NONE of them ever look that terribly cold.  I don't know who the heck dropped this ball but it was the first of many.  If you are in fact SO cold that the idea of waiting until morning is so unbearable that you contemplate jumping to your possible death for the slim chance that you can find help then I would hope that you would zip up your coat the entire way and maybe even toss the hood over your head too for good measure.  It also appeared that not only was the outside jackets mostly unzipped but also the lining as well..?!!?  I get that would have been hard to film actors who had their faces covered but at least when they slept they could have burrowed in.  Call me crazy but I may even cuddle with those beside me - even if I didn't like them - for that whole body heat thing.  When sleeping you also tend to curl into a ball when you are cold to conserve body heat - especially curling your extremities in.  You don't naturally stretch out and make the vulnerable extremities more susceptible to the elements.  I think if they had done these things - even if it didn't change the rest of the movie - I think I would have been more involved in the story and would have had a higher opinion of it.

The storyline itself is somewhat bumbling and awkward.  The nail biting scenes are all too quick and the web between is filled with awkward conversation that doesn't make much sense.  Granted, I can't imagine anyone in that situation would be a great conversationalist however it was severely lacking.

There is quite a few ""holy cow I can't look at this"" scenes and for the gore fans that will be straight up your alley.  It's more cringe worthy than real gore but it will make you take a breath in and probably look away.  I wouldn't recommend this for the weak stomached.

My final gripe is that the back cover pretty much gives away most of the movie - which is a complete buzzkill.  Why do all of this build up if the entire time you are waiting for the pictured scene on the back to happen - which is within about 5 minutes from the end of the film.

The entire dialogue, including when they sit in the stranded lift for half the movie, revolves around their self-absorbancy. Boring!!
The point of the movie, as we all know from the beginning, is that since we started with three characters then two must die so it's just a matter of being entertained by how.
Unfortunately the potential hook is deleted into special features and what you do get to see of the two victims is a brief cheap scene of some dogs eating some slaughter house tidbits and a couple of really cheap prosthetics.

Further, to the most unlikely sequence of events that left them stranded is the obvious escape which is to use hands and feet to slide along the cable and, of course, never occurs to our potential victims.

It's really hard to feel connected to a story in which the events are so contrived; acting so shallow; and dialogue just sophomoric time filling.",1287100800,12,1105,4.72020725388601

Adam Green creates a nice plot and wonderful setting that most viewers will be able to relate to. However, I do have a major issue that took some of my enjoyment out of this movie. When trapped somewhere in a cold climate, I'm pretty sure that you and I would do a much better job of attempting to keep ourselves warm and prevent things such as frostbite, ect... For example, we would be covering to best of our abilities all exposed extremities and keeping those coats zipped up as tight as possible. We absolutely wouldn't leave our hands out while we get a little sleep. I couldn't help but think about that throughout the movie.

4136601,3,B003L1ZWG2,"I really liked this movie, and I would have loved it had it not been for a few cold weather details that took me out of the moment.

First, the good: if you are afraid of heights, this movie has plenty of tension in it for you. The very idea of a ski chair lift makes my palms sweat, so my anxiety level started nice and high. I also love the use of the small cast and tight sets and shots that are typical of this kind of thriller. If Open Water and its sequels are your cup of tea, I think you will enjoy this movie in spite of the issues I'm going to discuss a little further on. The script is mostly good. The cast is competent and attractive. The themes the movie deals with are relevant, especially to young people who are just entering their first serious adult relationships: the places our old friends occupy, the tension between the old friend and the new girlfriend (the image of the three of them on the lift with the boyfriend in the middle was very effective for me). The cinematography and the sound editing are great, and the pacing is excellent. Unlike Open Water, where once you realize you're stuck in the water, you're pretty much reduced to sinking or swimming, the characters in Frozen are stranded on a chair lift and have several options, none of which is particularly good.

However, the film would have been much better if someone with some input had any real experience with cold weather. The film is supposed to take place in New England. That's not exactly International Falls, MN, but it does get very cold out here from time to time, and people know, for example, to pull up their hoods, pull down their hats, and zip up their parkas all the way. I guess that would have somewhat been a waste of the good-looking young actors, but I knocked off two stars for totally unrealistic responses to cold weather. Maybe that's harsh, but if I'm supposed to believe that the cold was the most pervasive danger they faced and the main reason for not staying still, I don't want to see them leaning their bare faces up against metal bars.

Other than that, I really enjoyed this movie, but the flaw was significant for me.",1287014400,2,2142,4.417721518987341
4136602,3,B003L1ZWG2,"Frozen has a terrific premise, no doubt about it.  Horror films have come to a point where we've really dug into most of our fears.  We've had deaths by dreaming, camping, spelunking, road tripping, drowning, skinny-dipping, baby-sitting, watching TV, the wind...the list goes on and on.  When the genre was first conceived, directors had a somewhat easier time dealing with fear because it was such a new medium.  Now that we're in the 21st century, it seems like almost everything's been done.  I can almost imagine writer/director Adam Green's thought process.  He sees a picture of an empty ski lift and like any good writer imagines, ""what if it stopped and I were stuck up there?""  It's a deceptively simple premise that I'm sure avid skiers wonder, from time to time, when the ski lift inevitably stops briefly, leaving them dangling hundreds of feet in the air.

What now?

The problem with films of this ilk is that once you get to that premise...what do you do?  Open Water had a similar situation, stranding two people in the ocean.  It's a terrifying start...but what do you do after that?  In Frozen, three friends go on a skiing trip and immediately Green sets up some interpersonal conflicts.  Dan and Lynch are two best friends and go skiing all the time.  But Dan has started dating Parker and he spends less and less time with Lynch, much to Lynch's dismay.  When Dan brings Parker with him to what's normally a ""boys retreat,"" Lynch is obviously put out.  The first 40 minutes of the film sets up the characters, providing more background than I expected and grounding them in reality.  Then they get stuck and it's here where things start to falter.  At this point, I imagine Green sitting back at his computer, looking at the script and saying, ""...what now?""

Frozen is Green's second film, after the enjoyable but not as awesome as he or some internet sites (*ahem* Ain't it Cool) have called it, Hatchet.  I enjoyed Hatchet better, even if Frozen is a more professionally-filmed and capable movie.  The problem with Frozen is that at the point where someone jumps (oh come on, you know someone has to) and breaks their legs, there's really no place to go.  Obviously no one wants a repeat of what happens to the poor soul who jumps...so we're stuck on the ski lift for the rest of the time until we get to the obligatory ""well I guess it's time to end this.""  Instead of building tension and the scares, Frozen becomes surprisingly inert right when it should be getting good.  To pass the time, the characters partake in preposterous and inane conversation.  And all I wanted was a Crowley-esqe figure to come in, axe a'swinging and just off them.

Competently filmed but surprisingly inert, Frozen is pretty average. But I give Green credit for trying.",1286928000,4,2777,4.70954356846473

I watched this one the other night, and while there were some suspenseful moments(most of which were wondering what Mr. Darwin was going to do with this hapless trio) it fell flat on too many levels.  I normally love horror movies, and I also watched ""Hatchet"" recently, and liked it alot more....simply because it didn't seem to masquarade as something anything more than it was.  Not so with ""Frozen""...

The actors, while decent, were decidedly clueless.  I won't get into all the things they could have done vs. what they did in fact do.  Is this what colleges are producing these days.  I guess they took the Incomplete in ""Common Sense particularly when your a$$ depends on it 101"" that semester.  Why would that clown think he could jump and not injure himself to the point where he would be immobile thus negating the point of him jumping off the lift to begin with?  Oh and I love the ""Don't let her watch!"" repeatedly as the wolves are attacking....you are about to get eaten alive by wolves my man, would YOU really care about who is seeing it or their fragile psyche cracking?  I doubt it.  Oh, and the wolves....like some others said, these are the smartest wolves going(far smarter then these three people).  And, they are inconsistent, they spend most of the movie hanging around and basically attacking as soon as any opprotunity presents itself(okay, fine), then in the end, the injured girl crawls away, even after being noticed by at least two wolves that couldn't have been more then 10 feet away, that weren't feasting on the second guy....ahhh wtf?  I thought for sure as she was just getting to the road they would appear in masse and drag her off to be devoured, and I think that would have been a much better(at least consistent) ending.  It would have been like Jaws swimming off and leaving Brody on the mast of the Orca after attempting to eat Hooper and definitely eating Quint. Oh well....

There was one actor in the film that definitely had its redeeming value, and that was the environment.  You did get that stillness and isolation that is key for a movie like this.  But that was the films biggest and best quality.  By a mile.  But I think we can all think of a number of horror films that utilize this well, and give you a better story and characters as well.

4136604,3,B003L1ZWG2,"With an abundance of over-the top gore and exaggerated effects, this type of film conveys real-life horror,without reliance upon supernatural, serial killer or monster plot lines. For these 3 people this is the worst thing that could have happened during their casual ski trip, and as an onlooker, I was sad for their plight. The simple fact that they were threatened by the elements and the physical height of their predicament, made their fear palpable, and realistic-two factors that are marks of every-day horror, for me. Though one theorizes how you get out of a situation like that, which is natural, their hopelessness and idealism (we can jump to get help) clearly represented a natural and human response to a situation that left them no other choice.

*Spoiler*

The scene where the boyfriend is torn limb from limb by wolves, after having jumped to escape the situation and attempt to get help was just aweful, and for the two people caught in the ski-lift at physically dangerous heights, to have to endure the sight of that situation was horrible. The extras were interesting as the film maker explained how the physical obstacles impeded them at times, and were interesting as no green screens were used, in order to create the most realistic terror possible.

The story was interesting and horrifying, but unfortunately a little more character development may have made me get more attached to these characters.

4136606,4,B003L1ZWG2,"Quite a few of these movies have been popping up lately: a horror / thriller film where characters are left stranded in one central location and the chills come not only from anything outside trying to encroach in but also the paranoia and the mental and emotional breakdowns of the characters. The Ruins I felt did this really well as it not only provided the gore and things you'd expect but provided some nice character moments of people losing sanity. Frozen goes for this kind of storytelling as well and actually did something that made me get interested in the film: the characters, or rather, character but I'll leave that for later. Watching Frozen knowing that director of gore-filled ""Hatchet"" Adam Green did this makes it kind of surprising like wow, more to this guy than gross stuff and while a couple of things hurt the film, I still found myself getting kind of tense as things get worse and worse.

The film centers on 3 characters, Dan (Kevin Zegers), Joe (Shawn Ashmore) and Dan's girlfriend Parker (Emma Bell) going to a ski resort on a Sunday to hit the slopes. Not wanting to spend the money on the ski lift, the 3 eventually talk the lift operator to let them on with a money bribe but thanks to Parker's escapades on the bunny hill, the trio never got any ""real"" ski time so before it closed, the 3 decides to take one last chance to ski the mountain but thanks to a misunderstanding, power shuts off, lights go off and the mountain won't re-open until Friday. It's too high up to jump off, wires connecting the chairs are too sharp to cross and the weather is dropping fast. Add to that, howling's heard off in the distance...

One thing that tends to be slightly hard to pull off in horror movies is to actually care about the characters. Sure in cases like slasher movies or movies about monsters, the characters are just there to show off how creatively they can be killed, but in a movie like Frozen, it's mandatory that we care about them since the gore will be relatively minor and there's no figure brandishing a sharp...something to fear. Frozen does it pretty well but mainly in the case of one character: Parker. Whether it's just my guyness not wanting a pretty girl to die or whether Emma Bell did a really good job making me care but I actually wanted her to survive the whole ordeal. The problem is with the other 2 is that they either have a certain personality or they do the ""lazy"" way of character building which are telling life stories. You know the ""back when I was 11, my father..."" type stories where instead of the actor providing a real feeling that this is a person, they just say some backstory and we're supposed to go ""oh now I sympathize with this person"". Ashmore does pretty well, same with Zegers but I actually wanted the character of Parker to live through the whole movie.

One thing the film doesn't do so well is the weird little things you'll be shouting at the characters in frustration. One character loses their glove and instead of sticking it in her pockets, she keeps it free to be put anywhere on a metal chair that's extremely cold. Characters suffer frostbite on their faces yet they don't zipper up their coats. One tractor operator is about to rescue them until he's called back but then a heavy ski equipment lands on his tractor. Something metal, so instead of going outside the tractor to figure out what the hell hit his vehicle with all that snow and frozen trees around...he keeps backing up. One character decides to jump...straight down onto his legs rather than let his side take the impact or least curl up, and even takes his skis off. They're might be more but that's something I noticed throughout the movie: those weird little contrivances that characters either don't do or they're just not possible. And there's one minor annoyance involving the wolves and considering what the film seems to be hinting could be the main character's fate, funny how they use the easier method.

Frozen is the kind of movie that you put on with a partner and you just let the film have fun freaking you out but when you decide to really pay attention to the film, a lot of things could get on your nerves. Not a complete indie triumph but it works pretty well. Just too bad I think Adam Green loves his gore too much to at least try to progress as a filmmaker.",1286755200,,4333,4.5229591836734695
4136607,3,B003L1ZWG2,"I didn't hear of this film until recently - but after seeing the trailer (followed by some very positive reviews) it interested me. Unfortunately, the film was just disappointing and never seemed to go anywhere.

The basic idea is a group of friends go to a ski resort, get stuck on a lift (and will be there for 5 days) and try to get out.

From the trailer, I was expecting some twist or SOME horror elements - the coverart even says ""A brilliantly conceived gut-wrenching horror film"" and ""A vicious, scary and horribying experience... Frozen is Hitchcock with teeth"" - after watching it, I definitely wouldn't call it a horror film. From the director of Hatchet and producer of Saw? I liked both and decided to give it ashot.

The movie runs just 93 minutes, and within the first 70 minutes only one thing happens. The majority of the film are the 3 stars sitting in a ski-lift talking about nothing (Whats your favorite cereal?) - I have a high tolerance for these things, and even enjoy bad movies, but usually something happens. In this film, that really wasn't the case. I never really cared about the characters, and with a movie focused on caring about them, that's a bad thing.

My thoughts after watching the movie were ""That's it? Its like the director sat around and came up with that idea in 5 minutes."" Turns out I was wrong - In watching the 90 minute featurette included on the disc (yep - same runtime as the movie!) the director admits to coming up with the idea in 20 seconds, and I don't doubt it. They also admit to making it ""on the cheap"" (which I also wouldn't argue with - it seems like they shot it all in one weekend).

For the blu-ray itself, the picture is ""OK"" - the colors seem a bit inconsistent (changing from shot-to-shot sometimes), there isn't a huge amount of detail other than  in closeups, and the picture is filled with grain throughout (I normally have no problem with grain, but found it distracting in this one). For a movie shot almost entirely in daylight, I didn't expect to see so much grain.

Audio was decent (Dolby True HD), but nothing special. Extras were also good (a 90 minute featurette if you care to sit through it).

Overall, I just didn't care for it. I enjoyed some parts, but with all of the nonsense in it (~85 minutes talking about nothing, ~5 minutes action, ~3 minutes credits) I just wouldn't want to sit through it again. Probably a rental at best - I know I left disappointed.",1286582400,4,2446,4.493243243243243
4136608,3,B003L1ZWG2,"Frozen is an interesting real-world horror tale from writer/director Adam Green (Hatchet, Spiral), in which a trio of college students (Kevin Zegers, Shawn Ashmore, Emma Bell) find themselves trapped on a ski lift.  Facing the peril of either freezing to death or risking deadly injury by dropping down to the ground below, Frozen can basically be described as being more similar to Open Water than anything else.  That aside, that's not saying that there isn't anything to admire here.  The three stars of the film are quite good, and Green manages to inject enough solid dialogue into the script to keep you interested in the characters and the goings on, but the pacing of the film is what really ends up bogging it down.  Not to mention that by the time a voracious pack of wolves make their presence known, the authenticity of the film's logic just gets thrown out the window.  Still, Frozen is worthwhile terror for what it's worth, and you could always do much worse than this.",1286582400,3,984,4.764705882352941
4136609,2,B003L1ZWG2,"First let me say that I am one of those people who can fall upstairs.  Trees and rocks have been know to find me when I walk or ride a bike.  I also live in Kansas, the FLAT part of Kansas.  This means that going down a snow covered hill very fast has no appeal to me. All this made it hard for me to get excited about the movie FROZEN.  I teach  film studies and our next assignment was to be a film critic.  We discussed the duties of a film critic and so on, so I decided to use this film as the film for them to review.  Since the film had a very short run in theatres and hadn't been seen by the kids, I thought it would be a great one for them to use.  The bottem line is this I found myself watching the film closer looking at how it was made,ie. camera angles, music, set, fx, and watching the reactions of my students.

 It was a new experience for me, I was taking notes in the dark about the movie on one pad and notes about the kids' reaction on another pad.  Thank Heaven the movie was only 93 minutes long.

First thing I noticed was that I didn't ""click"" with the characters.  Their opening dialogue seemed strained and fake.  The male friend compaining to his buddy that the girl was taking away from their guy time just fell flat.  Now if I can not find something in the characters to like then I have no emotional reason to care what happens to them.  This first part got a chuckle and snickering from the kids.  It seemed that a lot time was taken in the first part of the movie at talking about feelings and the male friend finding a girl.  I know that the scene where the boys ""make"" the girl get the lift guy to let them on is a set up for later, but this scene and the way the guys ""shamed"" the girl into doing it seemed sleazy.

The dialogue is the main thing that ""killed"" this mvoie.  For example, when they first realize that they are trapped on the lift, what do they talk about?  The different ways to die!  Another time is when the boyfriend is spread out on the ground with his legs 90 degrees from his body with a bone sticking out of his leg, what do they say?  Are you alright?  The effect is one of out and out laughter by the kids.  This mistake underminds  the guy on the ground and what is about to happen to him.  The two in the lift don't just ask this stupid questin once but several times even when the wolves are busy with the boy friend.

The music does nothing to help the movie.  The back ground music is classical in nature and does not fit what is happening on the screen.  I found myself aware it when I should have been paying attentin to the movie.

I may not ski but I do known about snow and cold and so do my students.  This was judged to be the greatest mistake of all in the movie.  The movie takes place at night  during bad snow snow storm and we all noticed the following things:
1.  When the characters talked, the was no puffs of ""smoke"" that would be there if warm breath met cold air.
2.  At first when they were trapped and the night turned into a blizzard they didn't shiver.
3.  The scene when the male friend tries to climb the cable that there was no ice on it.  There was ice on everything else but not here.
4.  They didn't try to huddle for warmth.  Come on now.
5.  There is a wind and their clothes don't move in it.
6.  The girl is the only one to get frost bite.  Why?

But not all was bad.  The director of the movie, Adam Green, also did the movie Hachet.  My kids said this was gross horror mvoie and they liked it.  The scene where the boyfriend jumps is the one scene we watched two or three times because the first part and first reaction was the strongest part of the mvoie.  We noticed that this was well done at first.  The kids said oh the blood but there wasn't any.  The director wisely stage this in such away that the kids' imagination added to the scene what wasn't there.  this was very effective.  But on second viewing things began to come out.  One was why didn't the guy faint?  When looking at the position of the guy the second time the kids noticed that the body and the legs were not in proportion  and at wrong angles.

The action scenes are well done and exciting.  The kids responded to these.  It was the parts in between that they hated.  And this is the director's fault.  He also worte the film.

The end!!!!!  Well I can not repeat the words that the kids said about the end.  they felt that they had spent 93 minutes of exciting action and dumb dialogue and they got that ending!  I don't even want to tell you the ending.

So I would not rent this movie.  If some else rented and asked you come see it...well if is that or taking out the trash, you might want to think long and hard before making decision.

SPOILER ALERT!

1. Why would anyone in their right mind want to ski when its almost dark and it's almost closing time?
2. Why did they not tie all their coats and clothing together and make a rope. Even if it doesn't go too far down, it is still better than dropping the full distance?
3. If you see it's high like that, jump towards a tree and maybe the branches will break your fall? Obviously dropping straight down without any ideas...is a bad idea??
4. When the snow plow came, they should have immediately took off their snow skis/boards and throw it down to get attention. But noooo, they waited till the guy was backing up and looking away.
5. When the other guy, Dan Walker? The third wheel guy. Why does he try to climb up on the slippery ice covered metal seat....with his hard plastic snow boots which has no grip???
6. Him trying to climb the cable like that?? You usually climb ropes by getting ur legs around the rope and pulling yourself with your hand. I dunno, they did mention it was sharp, but him climbing that was just stupid to begin with but the idea was the best one they had at that point.

TO BE UPDATED WHEN I FINISH MOVIE.
K FINISHED!

7. Huddling together for warm would be a good idea they should have done, instead they sorta all stayed separated even though on a small chair.
8. Could they not have buried part of their face into their coat? I'm usually able to. This would have kept their face from being exposed as much as possible.

4136641,5,B003L1ZWG2,"After viewing Adam Green's noble attempt to recreate the slasher genre of the 80's with Hatchet, I was pleasantly surprised to find out about his new film Frozen.  This movie essentially gives the viewer a harrowing take on the worst case scenario of being stranded on a ski lift, 60 feet above the ground.  The movie slowly builds, which is always a positive for this kind of suspense, and creates enough tension to chill your bones to the lift.  I loved the way the characters in this movie interacted with each other and the realistic way they began to break down over the course of this movie.  I really feel that this movie is one of the best horror/suspense films in the last couple of years because of the way everything from the acting, directing, the locations and the music come together fluidly.  This film does a wonderful job and incorporates the viewers fear for the lives of the characters into the picture.  The extras included on the DVD are excellent because they give a glimpse of how arduous the shoot was and the difficulties they overcame to create this stylish thriller.  Rex Reed gave the film a rather impressive review and as a film buff that is rather interesting because he was one of the original critics to fully support the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Although this movie was given a limited release in theaters I hope that positive word of mouth will create enough buzz to sustain the life of this picture on home video.",1286409600,,1459,4.6498054474708175
4136642,3,B003L1ZWG2,"If you let your fears runaway with you a bit then the idea behind Frozen might make for a pretty decent horror film.  Certainly the idea of getting stranded in an harsh environment and being left with few choices if you really wish to survive could make for a film with a ton of tension, but for me this particular film starts to come back towards the original Halloween where rather than being scared by the film I find myself laughing at how stupid the subjects of the film are as they keep making dumb decisions or live with the results of the dumb decision that started the whole plot off.  That's not to say that others would feel that way, it's just my own way of reacting to these types of films where I tend not to find the tension and horror that others do, and really it's why I tend to avoid these types of films.  In rare circumstances I might actually be frightened by a film like this, but really I tend to look more towards comedies, action films, and things like that as I get much more entertainment value from those kinds of films.

Personally, I'd recommend renting this one first.  If you really like it, or have friends that you want to share it with, perhaps a purchase would be recommended.",1286409600,,1213,4.349557522123894
4136643,1,B003L1ZWG2,"I had the misfortune of seeing the premiere of this DVD at a hostel in Belgium.

This is one of those dumb 80-minute, crap-concept movies that might appeal to coma victims, brain dead teens, snowboarding losers, and mall rats, but it is ridiculously impossible to accept that these three moronic friends could even manage without tripping or killing themselves from the get go.

Three incessantly whining, narcissistic, teenage dummies decide to spend their night roaming around a ski mountain. Yeah, that same old setup.

Add the three most incompetent idiots on the planet, the most feeble ski lift chair ever assembled, the most belligerent wolves ever born, the most inexplicably sharp braided steel cable ever manufactured, and what do you get?  A more than flawed survival ""thriller"" in the snow.

Perhaps I feel this way being a self-taught German Alps climber; the plot, idiotic and full of holes, the characters unlikable and numskulled; I legitimately wished for them all to die.

The idea of a pack of ""blood thirsty"" wolves on a ski hill, ridiculous.  Wolves in fact hardly ever assault humans unless they are menaced.  They are pack animals that govern their territory from other predators (wolves).  They are more interested in human presence as observers as opposed to man eaters.  The dialogue and tonal shifts were not very convincing.

I was unpleasantly rewarded with an inadequate 90 minute snow flick.",1286409600,21,1422,5.086206896551724
4136644,5,B003L1ZWG2,"'Frozen,' from the director of 'Hatchet,' Adam Green, is nothing like anything he's ever done before - and yet will still keep you glued to the end of your seats, your heart pounding, the ending something you HAVE to behold.

Well, yes, all that is true, but it's also once the main storyline kicks in! My God, that takes some time, trust me. But, when things get moving here hold on, as much as our trio do to their ski-lift chair, for it's gonna be a cold, sometimes bumpy ride!

Shawn Ashmore, Kevin Zegers and Emma Bell star as three friends who take a skiing/snowboarding trip one weekend. They spend most of the day on the bunny hill and right before the place gets ready to close, they convince the chair lift attendant to give them one last ride. Due to an impending storm, and the fact that it's the last ski day of the week, they are allowed one last (quick) ride.

But, on their way up the mountain, they are left stranded in the chair lift with no one around as the operator shuts things down for the night - and the resort too! Quickly frostbite starts to kick in they all have to decide if it's better to stay put up there or should someone jump down to get help?

Whilst up there they chat about the worst case scenarios of death, inclusive of 9-11 when people jumped from the building that were on fire. But, you can easily guess which one will make the heroic jump to the frozen-packed snow below ... and, thereafater can easily guess what will happen to his legs upon hitting the ground!

Not to mention the smell of blood then attracts a hungry pack of wolves and you have yourself the first death of the film! Hey, don't worry, I won't give any more away, but just know that this really is an edge-of-your-seat what-will-happen-next film that will have you rooting for the characters in no time; caring for them, even.

'Frozen' is definitely a great film, with great acting, great direction and above-decent dialogue. And, for those interested in how they did this made-entirely-on-location film, check out the four (4) featurettes. They are SO informative that it's like watching another version of the film you just watched, considering the fourth featuretter goes on for 52 minutes alone!",1286409600,,2212,4.55919395465995
4136645,4,B003L1ZWG2,"I was skeptical.  It seemed like the typical teenage horror story.  Three college friends, two of whom are romantically involved, try to scam a cheaper ride up the slopes for some skiing/snowboarding.  Then they are chased by a slasher in a goalie mask, blood gushes, sex ensues...  Well, none of that happens.  What a pleasant surprise.  Frozen is a bit of a cautionary tale about having a little respect for, and perhaps fear of, the power of nature.

As I referenced above, the three friends scam their way onto a lift for one last run on a Sunday night, right before the slopes close for a week.  A storm is coming, and everyone wants out.  Due to some very believable circumstances, the ski lift is shut down with them on it, and everyone leaves, for a week!  They are left with trying to figure a way down (it looks like about 50 feet or maybe more) and then a way out before dying of hypothermia.  They face many natural hazards (I don't want to give anything away), but best of all, no man-made or supernatural enemies.  This is purely believable, and that adds to the terror.

In all, this is a minimalist, one set piece with a very small cast.  The performances are very good, if not spectacular.  The gore is kept to a minimum, and the R-rating is largely for language.

While this doens't have the supernatural element of the Ruins, and certainly less gore than the Ruins, I think that Frozen will likely appeal to viewers who enjoyed the Ruins.",1286323200,,1457,4.5038167938931295

Field Medicine training, Emergency Medicine and Cold Weather training had me watching it from a perspective of someone who would think of these things first.
Now, after reading some negative reviews, they have some valid points but I suggest you rent first and decide if you want to buy.
1 - 3 people are on a ski slope and no cellphones? Did I miss something? LOL
2 - Wolves may be pack animals but they would not go out of their way to attempt to outsmart 3 humans and then lose interest in the female after taking down the males? Sexist wolves is what one reviewer said. I laughed but he was right.
3 - Yeah, these kids are STUPID. Case closed.
  I cringed at the broken leg from the first person dropping/jumping. I perished the thought of what a wolf could do if it ever DID attack while I was down. Not a likely thing to happen but nothing is impossible. (Sort of a SPOILER) I cringed again when the person gets hit by a falling cart while trying to escape.

The kids, who were all above-average on the attractive meter, were strong enough actors but there wasn't enough going on to let them really show their talent. The script was slow in places, but the dialogue was seemingly spot on as to how kids talk these days (I work in a high school so I listen to  kids all day.) I liked the wolves, but there was just something missing in the plot. I kept hoping the chairlift operator was going to rear his ugly head and do something sinister, but there were no real characters for me to hate. I think we were supposed to hate the wolves, but they were only doing what hungry wolves do in the dead of winter.

4136696,2,B003L1ZWG2,"Sometimes there are movies that are good. Sometimes there are movies that are bad. Sometimes however there are movies that are so bad, they become good. Frozen is one of those films. It went from horribly dull and slow moving to hilarious in very unintentional ways. This movie is definitely one of those you ""MST3K"" through in order because even though it is meant to be a thriller, the would-be scary or shocking parts are done in such a way you can't help but laugh at the awfulness.

The first thirty minutes of the film is just standing around talking. It's meant to give the main triad of characters personality and back story so you care about them when they are trapped on the ski lift of doom. It fails and because you know the characters are going to be trapped on the skilift for most of the movie, it's hard to care about anyone else that comes up in the film. The writer and director seem to know this and so these characters are given such little personality than it really just feels like walk-on actors reading lines rather than characters in a film.

Once on the ski-lift things get better and then they plummet drastically down into campy b-movie awfulness. I did have a single ""Oh ^&%^&*!"" moment in the film as it did a great job of showing what happens when a person plummets from rather high up. This however is the work of some nice special effects and camera work than any acting talent or emotive reponse to the characters.

From there it all goes downhill thanks to the Wolf pack. Yes my friends, a pack of wolves are the would-be force of nature here. By the end of the film though, you're outwardly routing for the wolves since none of the main characters are likeable and it's hilarious that these wolves are not only acting completely outside everything that is known about the species but also because the film shows them to be smarter than the three kids trapped on the lift, right up to the point where you expect them to stand on their hind legs and get in a huddle in an attempt to figure out how to climb up to the lift. It's that bad.

The two worst/best scenes in the movie are when the wolves eat their first human and he's screaming ""Don't let her watch! Don't let her watch!"" Now, not only is the acting here so poorly that you have to laugh at the reactions and intonations of all three characters, but since any predatory species goes for the neck as soon as the prey is downed, what little suspension of disbelief this film has is utterly lost here. The other awesome scene is where another main character fends off a wolf with a ski pole and then snowboards down the mountain with the pack of wolves in hot pursuit. Now this is hilariously bad on so many levels, I don't know where to begin. Whether it's the wolves waiting for him to climb down the lift (which is not something they do. These are wolves, not buzzards, and it just adds to the ""smartest wolves ever"" motif that runs through the film, but even after one of the wolves is stabbed and they can tell this human will put up a fight, they chase after him on his snowboard. All I could think about was, ""Can your heart withstand the bone-chilling terror of the SNOWBOARD CHASE SCENE?"" Of course later on you get to see who wins between the wolves and the other main male character and well...the end result is hilarious and impossible there as well.

Finally the movie has the wolves totally not interested in the female character. Sexist wolves? They only like male meat? It's so hilariously bad to see their reaction to her that once again, it's hard not to laugh. Frozen is just such a bad film on so many levels, but at least it's bad in a campy, corny, cheesy sort of way that lets you laugh at it from beginning to end. The comedy is unintentional, but oh my, is it there.",1285891200,12,3783,4.390870185449358
4136697,4,B003L1ZWG2,"Remember a few years ago a flick called ""Open Water"" came out about a married couple left behind during a scuba trip, they find themselves left adrift, miles from land and surrounded by hungry sharks?

Well ""Frozen"" is kind of like the winter version of that tale.

The basic man vs. nature story is that 3 college friends get stuck on a ski lift after a series of mis-communications by resort staff. To make matters worse, the resort is set to close down for the week, and on top of that ""some weather"" is moving in.

For a film like this to work the viewer has to like the characters and the actors have to really do a good job, because let's face it, we are basically watching 3 people sit on a ski-lift for 90 minutes.

The good news is that ""Frozen"" actually pulls this off. Genre favorite Kevin Zegers (Wrong Turn, Dawn of the Dead & The Hollow) and Shawn Ashmore (The Ruins) do a really good job, but it's Emma Bell who steals the show playing Zegers' girlfriend. All three actors do a great job of pulling the viewer into their plight and because you care for the characters, as the situation grows worse, the scenes get more and more tense as the film plays out.

I'm not sure if ""Frozen"" is a movie you would re-visit often as once it's seen and the fate of the main characters is known, I'm not sure what the draw would be to go back for a second viewing. Still this is a definate horror must see - a new film that isn't a remake or reimagining or a sequel...that alone makes it worth supporting if you are a horror fan.",1285891200,,1531,4.247422680412371
4136698,5,B003L1ZWG2,"The premise couldn't be more simple: Three people stuck on a chairlift at a ski resort. From this very simple premise director Adam Green concocts a gut-wrenching survival thriller. It's a very primal man versus nature tale. Now, there a handful of contrivances that are required for the central conflict to emerge, however, Frozen is so thoroughly successful overall that I am more than willing to overlook these contrivances. Some people are apparently not willing to overlook them. My feeling is, if you can't suspend disbelief, why even bother watching movies at all? Nearly all movies strain credibility at some point. It's very often a necessity in order to tell a good, thrilling story. Having said that, I feel that Frozen is an unabashed homerun. It's a film that sets out to do one thing: unnerve you and keep you on the edge or your seat, and does it extremely well. It gives us three characters who are tolerable if not likable and who I found it quite easy to sympathize with. They are well-written characters who seem like real people, not stereotypes. I was truly emotionally invested in their survival. The three actors play their parts very well indeed. The success of a film like this pretty much rides on the actors, and they do a great job carrying the film. There are moments in Frozen that I found to be unbearably intense. Particulary the scenes involving the Dan character and his leap from the chair. So intense were they that I had to stop the movie and catch my breath. It has been a long time since I've been this affected by a horror movie.

I disagree that Frozen is not a horror movie. It is very much a horror movie. It is truly horrifying. It is more terrifying than any movie I have seen in recent memory. I was also more emotionally engaged by Frozen than any horror movie I can think of in years. That says a whole lot right there. What was the last horror movie you saw where you actually felt sorry for the characters? Where you desperately wanted them to survive? Where you were almost angry at the filmmakers for putting them through such hell? Frozen provoked just those kind of reactions from me which are very rare.

Now of course there will those audience members who say that the film is ""too far-fetched"", ""too unbelievable"", etc. I have never skied in my life (and after seeing Frozen, very likely never will). I don't know how plausible this scenario is. In fact, I'm quite sure that it's not possible for people to be stuck on a chairlift as depicted in this movie. I'm quite sure that the things that happen in this movie are very very unlikely to ever happen in real life. But I don't care. It doesn't matter. Frozen is a fictional horror movie. A movie that seeks to entertain, frighten, excite, make you gasp and keep you on the edge of your seat. And it does that extremely well. I must also give director Adam Green props for shooting on location and completely avoiding CGI. How refreshing to see a film in 2010 that doesn't resort to godawful CG effects. The wolves are real wolves. The gore effects are actual physical makeup effects. Just another reason why the movie rules. Frozen is one of the best horror movies of the past decade.",1285804800,5,3193,4.580419580419581
4136699,3,B003L1ZWG2,"Imagine getting stuck on a ski lift and the mountain resort closes down. This is what happens to the three young people in this film.  It's a long drop if they jump off--which one does, with bad results, to say the least; there are wolves all over the place; no one is around to hear them yell; they lack the strength and leverage to climb up to the cable and try to make it all the way back to civilization; and so on.

You will feel the frostbite on your face as they try to figure out what to do.

Not a whole lot of story here, and quite a bit of R-rated language that gets tiresome, but for what it is, it is fairly effective.

NEED MONSTER'S OR KNIVE CARRYING PSYCHO'S. MAN AGAINST NATURE, FEAR, OR THE  MERE CIRCUMSTANCE OF GOING THROUGH
A HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE IS WHAT I LIKE. WE ALL KNOW THE PLOT. but what i liked was the character development,
the 3 main character's, and great scenery, with some height scenes which i am always afraid of. i don't know
why so many people did not  like this. i am not gonna analyze and pick apart what is wrong with this movie,
i wnated to sit back, get into it, and feel excitement but at the same time be entertained. i liked this
movie alot. just forget about why did  this happen. clear your mind watch it and you will be amazed that
it is very good",1285632000,3,771,4.260273972602739

8399270,2,B003L1ZWG2,"First off, you probably wouldn't watch this expecting a blockbuster but there are some decent things about this. I just found too much of it very frustrating and unrealistic - even under the assumption you need to suspend a little reality.

**POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD**
PROS -
-The acting is not as bad as you would think. Its on par or even a bit better than expected for a B thriller.
-Surprisingly, the set-up for how the main characters get into the situation is actually somewhat believable. I expected this to be one of the most contentious issues, but it actually made a great attempt at being plausible.
- A unique idea that is pretty thrilling in its concept.
CONS-
- Some of the most frustrating decision making or lack thereof.
*examples* - The cold temperature is the number one enemy, yet the characters never fully zip their coats up and sufficiently cove themselves despite being extremely cold. Hell, one guy never even puts his hood up.
One bright fellow decided to jump as a way to go get help, never listening to the friends saying no. Never once did he look at the 30 plus feet fall and think it was going to end badly.
When the wolves come, the attacked character doesnt use any of the fallen ski equipment or even a fist to TRY to do something. Even if in vain, we can assume most people would try to fight to the death. He basically says, don't let me girlfriend see this, and he lays down. Boo
- There are wolves. Right in the midst of a popular ski area no doubt, and they show up within literal moments of someone showing the first sign of being on the ground. Remind me not to ski there if this is likely.
- Girl loses glove. Girl never bothers to even put hand in pocket. Somehow said girl falls asleep with hand on cold rail. I cant even go further into this. You wouldnt believe me.
- Ski lift seat is mysteriously coming unbolted at the most inconvenient time. This is a cheap trick. It is terrible.
- In the first moments of being stranded, before the place shuts down, one trapped character actually shushes the other when calling for help. They never bother.
- The most obvious rescue mechanism was tried absolutely last resort and done so awkwardly it made me cringe.

This is a great flick if you wanna start it and work into making out during the movie because you don't wanna miss something.
Other than that its just a time waster.",1528156800,,2368,4.441379310344828
