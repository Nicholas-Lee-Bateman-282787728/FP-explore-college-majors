8198538,5,B000R343JO,"I left Britain in 1981 so was not lucky enough to be around when the new comedians came along.  I first discovered Peep show , then Armstrong Miller  and then this ABSOLUTE masterpiece of irreverent humour.  Monty Python on Steroids.  The sketches are slick and quick and very VERY funny.  Not for the faint heart..those easily offended by language and PC  should avoid.
Just the one season  but oh so funny.  Their parodies of British TV are spot on and wonderfully silly. David Mitchell is an excellent staight...ish man  but Robert Webb is Brilliant.. his speed and timing are amazing. His wanna kill with poison character is so wonderfully manic  made me laugh out loud. Too bad there weren't more series  BUT the guys are out there in Peep show, Mitchell Webb look and Situation  THANK goodness these two are a MAGICAL evening of offensive genius.  LOVED IT.",1293580800,2,863,4.75
