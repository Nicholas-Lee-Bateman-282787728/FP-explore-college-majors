I'm not sure whether it was due to bad blood or legal issues at the time, but when Paul hit the road in 1984 in support of his self-titled solo album, he stuck to new material only. My thought is that he wanted to shed that image and strike out in a new direction. Those familiar with the first Di'anno album know that Paul took a more pop oriented direction -- a 180 from his Iron Maiden material.

I'm not sure of the background of the band members, but they sound really tight and come off as capable musicians.

When I purchased my copy, I knew this performance would only be showcasing the new material from 1984. I actually enjoyed this album and was looking forward to seeing how Paul looked and sounded after two years away from the stage. He appeared to be a little heavier, but was in very good voice. Oddly, he wore a leather outfit that didn't really fit the music, but the guy was in the midst of a transition and was trying to get his bearings. He also looked quite uncomfortable and unsure of himself on stage as he ran through the new songs, almost as if acknowledging to the audience ""I know you want to hear some Maiden songs, but c'mon, give the new material a chance...""

Paul has stated that he was pretty messed up on drug and drink at this stage of his life, affecting his ability to make rational decisions, among other things. I think that's how he tries to explain away this pop rock period of his life, but I really think he was looking to make a name for himself as a solo artist and was looking to put Maiden behind him. And can you blame him? After the guy leaves, the band hires Bruce Dickinson, releases ""The Number of the Beast,"" and moves to a whole new level of superstardom. You know that had to hurt.

It appears there were plans for yet another album with this band, as Paul introduces a new song by the name of ""Spiritual Guidance."" But this wasn't meant to be, as he scrapped this band shortly after the tour and put together the more successful Battlezone. And during this portion of his career, and much to the delight of his fans, he made a point to add his Iron Maiden material back into his set. Come to think of it, after this tour, he has never played any of the ""Di'Anno"" album songs live again. Some would say this is a good thing, but heck, I enjoyed it.

I think that's why this DVD is so interesting. It is a definite Di'Anno oddity.",1197849600,2,2509,4.307203389830509
