1668885,5,B00005UWAT,"I know people will argue but not other season of Sailor Moon is better. Yes I think this season is even better than Moon-S-SuperS-and the last season Stars. All season are great but this has the best story line. S-SuperS-and Stars are all the same except for different bad guys and a different ending. In S-SuperS-and Stars the bad guy is doing the same thing: looking for pure heart crystals, dream mirrors, or star seeds. It's the same thing every episode. Bad guy attacks person their crystal/mirror/or star seed appear and then the bad guy realizes its not the one they are looking for and then Sailor Moon kills them and the next episode is just the same. Don't get me wrong, I love all the seasons but everyone has to admit that is what happens in almost every episode until the end.
Sailor Moon R leaves you with a curious feeling. And even though I'd seen all of the seasons before I saw R I was still liking the mystery of Rini's parents (even though we know who they are). The season just gets great by this tape because the scouts go to the future and many secrets are revealed. One secret is why everyone is still alive 1,000 yrs later. Plus I think one of the episodes is great (probably a lot better in the true uncut japanese version and not like the Pioneer version on DVD that they say is uncut) but I don't think little kids would like it, and they shouldn't since the show in japan was made for teenagers.
Anyway this tape is an awesome tape. You even finally get to meet Sailor Pluto in true form.",1016150400,7,1517,4.363957597173145

7955561,5,B00005UWAT,"Sailor Moon R is my favorite season

In the first 13 episode of the season, during the Doom Tree part of the season, I enjoyed the story most of all. I found the relationship, the love square, going on between Serena, Darian, Alan, and Anne to be amazing. I had never seen anything like it before in my life, mostly because I was young when it started. It was probably what made me think Love Triangles and Love Squares where a great idea for writing in my own future.

The second half of the season was great but it had several episodes that I found unappealing because the story line of those episodes was lame. Still, over all, the whole season was amazing, the entire story lines, both of them, for start to end were great. The Crystal Tokyo part of the story was amazing to.

I would suggest that everyone watch this season.",1372550400,,829,4.37012987012987

7955565,1,B00005UWAT,I love sailor moon in its orignal japanese form not the edited version. I like uncut dubs not edits. In America This is a kid show. In Japan its an older teen anime for kids 15+ or 13+. Sailor MoonR is finally availble in japanese with subtiles. I ignore sailor moon dubbed and watch the amazing subtile version. Usagi is the BEST.,1078012800,5,331,4.354838709677419
