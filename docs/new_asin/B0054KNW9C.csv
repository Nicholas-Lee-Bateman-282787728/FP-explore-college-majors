8456778,4,B0054KNW9C,"First thing you notice:  this DVD is based on a REALLY old VHS.  I can't find the original date of recording, but the glasses and video editing styles put it at late 70's, early 80's.  That said, Irish flute playing is much older than that, so everything on the DVD still applies.  The instructor, Mickie Zekley does a fine job introducing the basics of embouchure, holding the flute, fingering, and breath control.  Coverage of the essential embellishment techiques for Irish flute (or penny whistle) playing is well done.  Mr. Zekley runs through the basics (strikes, cuts, rolls, etc) and then gives applications of these techniques in the context of a tune.  I found being able to SEE the techniques being performed to be very helpful in helping me get a handle on how to properly approach these embelishments.  For somebody just getting into playing the flute/whistle in the Irish style, this DVD is useful indeed, and happens to be the ONLY video I am currently aware of.  For more advanced players, give it a pass.  You'll learn nothing new.

The biggest annoyance with the video is that when they transferred from VHS to video, the kept it in full mono, with all the sound going to the right speaker.  I would have ""copied"" the right channel to the left in order to fill both channels.  Video quality is passable, being limited by the VHS transfer.  You will be able to see the technical demonstrations just fine.

There is also no printed music to go along with this DVD, but the tunes are covered in slowly and in pretty good detail, so most people should be able to keep up with it.

Recommendable to the beginning Irish Flute Student.",1316476800,4,1646,4.663194444444445
