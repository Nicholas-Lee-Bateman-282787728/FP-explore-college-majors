8564260,5,B00B8VPJCO,"Two rich and psychotic brothers setting up the perfect sacrifice. One an escaped highly intelligent mental case. The other, his little brother,  a graduate student / teacher's aid on the field trip from hell or to hell depending on your POV. See you in part II (Phychopathic Canadians)...hehehe :-)  FYI: I am a huge fan of NYPD BLUE, GRIMM, 21 JUMP STREET AND GOODFELLAS...Plenty of good Actors and Actresses in this film.",1482624000,,423,4.861111111111111

8564264,5,B00B8VPJCO,I bought this movie because I am into that kind of flick. What I got was great acting and a great plot. That is all I am going to say I give nothing away.

8564265,3,B00B8VPJCO,"This is an excellent and scary serial killer movie, the killers are brothers are really creepy scary and have spooky eyes very pale almost no color grey eyes rimmed in black remind me of a look of someone demonically possessed like seen in horror movies. Hate the ending. But don't let that stop you from giving it a try lol",1373068800,,324,4.416666666666667
8564266,5,B00B8VPJCO,"Great Film,.... Excellent acting... Awesome filming... Fantastic scenery. What can i say but this was a well made horror thriller movie. i found this film very surreal, creepy, aerie, and gory. The main actor/killer had the creepiest eyes and expression. you have to watch very close to everything that goes on in this film for it all fits nicely together at the end. The male and female actors in this film did a excellent job and they are very attractive and very pleasing to watch. the killing scenes were a little hard to watch and very disturbing. this is a film where  you sit on the edge of your seat and are ready to jump any second with alot of surprise and suspense. i really liked the main detectives... the blond was quite attractive and did a really great job with her acting. i found this film to be a little like the Hannibal Lecter films... very creepy and bizarre... highly recommended... should be liked by both guys and gals... never a dull moment.",1372982400,,967,4.557471264367816
8564267,2,B00B8VPJCO,"Premise: A bunch of sex crazed college students staying in an house as a class project. An escaped nut from a mental institution. A cop that captured him years ago. An FBI agent sent to take over the case. Oh yeah, the house the kids are staying in??????.........guess who use to live there? There is another plot twist but I will not spoil.

Acting: The students, typical young actors more likely hired because they look better nekkid than for their acting ability. The cops are better. The crazy escapee, Silas Weir Mitchell (Monroe from Grimm), plays a silent killer named James Bennet.

Scenery/Background: For a house where noone lives, it is clean, the grounds are well kept and there are even a live potted plant. The windows are clean, no cob webs, etc. Its a nice looking house. The cop station is basically empty rooms with a few desks and computers. It's rare to see any other cops in the station.

Family friendly: Not a family movie. Topless female nudity and several sex scenes. No blood and guts. The murders are more implied than seen.

The character development surrounding the killer was interesting enough to keep me watching. However, the movie just kinda dead ends. I did not realize the movie was over until the credits started to roll. I had to 'rewind' the 20 minutes of the movie because I thought I missed something. I didn't. I get the impression they just ran out of money and was unable to finish the story. I dunno.

Overall, a total of 2 stars. I like Monroe from Grimm so I wanted to like this movie. Even for a B movie, it had some potential but it just fizzled out. I feel 2 stars is the most I can give. Sorry Monroe.",1372636800,4,1652,4.493333333333333
8564268,1,B00B8VPJCO,"Again, we are subject to film distribution companies and others attempting to repackage old stuff as new and breathe new life into an older film.

This film is nothing more than a re-packaging of the film Circle (2010) also available here on Amazon, for quite a bit less.  Buy that and enjoy the film.

This is a pretty good film, and Silas Weir Mitchell does not disappoint as a genius psychopath.

I am sure Indican Pictures re-released this hoping to cash in in Silas Weir Mitchell's fame from Grimm.  He's a great actor, but this sort of stuff is disingenuous without full and fair disclosure to the public of what they are buying.",1364774400,9,635,4.584070796460177
