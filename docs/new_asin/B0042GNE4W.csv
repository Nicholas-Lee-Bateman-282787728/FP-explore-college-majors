8413678,5,B0042GNE4W,"I guess I belong to the minority but for me Clinton Carpenter's completion of Gustav Mahler's incomplete Tenth Symphony is a revelation. Whereas Deryck Cooke provided a bare minimum in his orchestration leaving much to the audience to fill up in their imagination getting them thinking what it might have been had Mahler lived longer, Carpenter tried to 'realize' the score using his own imagination and conjecturing. Surprisingly, the result is far more inspiring than expository, and for this reason Carpenter's is more successful than others by Cooke, Wheeler, Mazzetti, Barshai, in keeping the listeners keenly aware of the greatness of Mahler's last composition.

Granted, Carpenter's orchestration oftentimes comes across as too thick and overly expressionistic, a la Alban Berg. But why not? I take it seriously that Mahler's late orchestration was thin and effective. But it's probable that the composer might have moved away from it and ventured into a new territory such as what Carpenter put on the sheets.

What's most important is that regardless of the version, the conductor and orchestra must have a total conviction and it is in this respect that I wholeheartedly recommend the recording under review by Shui/Singapore Symphony Orchestra. Lan Shui is a conductor to keep an eye on. He has keen ears for large-scaled orchestral pieces, e.g., Wagner, Bruckner, Mahler, Strauss, and his grasp of structural integrity of the huge pieces is second to none. Furthermore, he can make many details come out crystal clear while maintaining balance and dynamics intact, not sacrificing the romantic flairs the slightest bit (his recent Richard Strauss cycle with the same orchestra in Singapore was as good it could get and drew a huge accolade from the critics and audience alike).

The Singapore Symphony Orchestra is, to say the least, phenomenal in their ensemble, tonal refinement, and panache charging themselves up all the challenges that this notoriously difficult score calls for. In particular, the brass section is on a par with that of Chicago Symphony displaying an impressive combination of lung power and precision. Based on this recording, I am not sure if I am hearing CSO or VPO!

A great recording of the great score to treasure then, it gets my full heads up.",1399161600,,2286,5.1702702702702705
8413679,2,B0042GNE4W,"I wish I could have enjoyed this as much as the other reviewers did, but there is too much to not like as far as I am concerned. Putting the positives first, the sound and video are fabulous- everthing you would expect from a Blu-ray, and the only reason I am not giving this recording 0 stars. This is a fine orchestra, and the conductor might be a very good conductor, but he needs to live with Mahler for a few more years before he is ready. Clearly he is out of his element here. The opening tempo is so slow that it is nearly unrecognizable. In fact, the entire piece is so slow that it is a real challenge just to stay focused on listening. The rest of the issues I have are with the completion itself, and, of course, this is a totally subjective thing. I have listened extensively to all of the available completions, and,for me anyway, the Carpenter is, by leaps and bounds, the least desirable of all. Mahler was always obsessed with clarity in his orchestrations. He would have a fit were he to heaar this. The Carpenter completion is so incredibly dense as to render the work, in many places, unrecognizable. Take for example the drum stroke that ends the fourth movement and begins the finale. There is a very well documented anecdote regarding the origins of this drum stroke, and, should you want the hear what it is SUPPOSED to sound like, listen to any available Cooke recording. In this performance, you MIGHT be able to hear it if you listen very carefully and turn the volume way up on your stereo. Knowing what this drum stroke signifies, and expecting to hear it in this performance, I was dumbfounded when it did not appear. Its absence takes away 90% of the emotional impact of the music. The other 10% is removed by the lack of passion in the performance. The finale contains some of the most heart wrenching and passion filled music Mahler ever penned, but the scoring is so dense, and the conductor so un-passionate that it fails terribly. I was really, really disappointed with this performance. Other than that, it was fine.",1350518400,3,2053,4.536388140161725
8413680,3,B0042GNE4W,"This is primarily a technical review of the Blu-ray version, as others have commented on the musical merits of this Clinton Carpenter realization of Mahler's 10th.  Any Mahler on Blu-ray is most welcome, but especially the seldom performed 10th which has been ""completed"" by musicologists in various versions.  I found the video to be slightly soft compared to the highest quality Blu-ray discs.  Part of this may be due to the 1080 interlaced lines, according to the liner notes, instead of a 1080 line progressive scanned recording.  What I found more disturbing was that many shots were out of focus, really inexcusable for a professional recording.  I am not just referring to the frequent artistic use of unfocused images here.  For example, closeup shots of soloists would be focused instead on a foreground or background subject.  I estimate that 10 to 15 percent of the shots suffer from this.  Now, if you are viewing on a small screen or the DVD, this may not be as noticeable.  I also found the sound to be a bit disappointing, even though it is specified as DTS-HD Master Audio.  The sound does not recreate a live performance well.  First, the imaging or location of instruments is very amorphous. Part of this may be due to the unusual layout of the orchestra with violins and violas spread across both sides, cellos in the middle, and basses on the left (a more conventional layout is used in the ""Five Elements"").  Also, the surround channels are very subtle.  Second, the dynamics are very subdued.  I thought this was a fault of the recording but in the included interview, conductor Lan Shui states that he purposely limited the dynamics of the instruments for a softer sound.  As an example, in the final movement, the bass drum beats here sound like the soft murmurs of a dying heart.  In other performances I have heard, Wigglesworth with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales (Cooke version, hard to find BBC CD), and Barshai with the Junge Deutsche Philharmonie (Barshai version, Brilliant CD), the bass drum strokes sound like fatal stabs to the heart.  Lan Shui has worked with Leonard Bernstein in the past but this performance is more along the lines of Bernard Haitink - very laid back, you are not going to see him jump up and down on the podium like Lenny.  If you are not familiar with the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, do not worry, they play very well.

The extra on the disc, ""Five Elements"" by Qigang Chen, is a short but fascinating piece with many percussive effects reminiscent at times of Stravinksy.  I found the sound on this piece to be more dynamic than on the Symphony.  Oddly, the producers put an artistic frame around the video of the first four ""Elements"" but remove it for the last.

Overall, I am happy to have this disc even though I do find faults with the recording and the interpretation.",1317686400,,2841,4.7317073170731705
8413681,4,B0042GNE4W,"I bought this because it was the only DVD available of Mahler's 10th in any 5-movement version.  Carpenter's completion seems to me too busy.  Where Deryck Cooke was in many passages content to spin out a long Mahlerian melodic line over a spare harmonic base, Carpenter insists on adding cadences within lines that don't need them; this shortens the breath of the music and trivializes it.  The quotations from other Mahler works just sound silly and plastered-on.  The drum strokes in the finale have little impact.  They are supposed to be muffled, but probably not really soft.

That said, I very much enjoyed the performance.  Maestro Shui evokes a genuine Mahler sound from his players.  The violins swoop and slide with abandon, just as they might have done under Mahler's direction.  The string sections carry this work, and his players give their all, especially in the solo passages.  The woodwind solos are also expressively played.  While the orchestra overall is not quite up to the competition on CD, they acquit themselves honorably.

The video direction seems overly fond of the ceiling of the hall, especially at climactic moments, but it so attractively done that the fault is easy to forgive.  The interview with the maestro is fairly shallow and contains one egregious error.  The Five Elements is interesting and well performed.

I recommend this video, at least until a Cooke version comes along, which may not happen for some time.  It has zero regional coding, and I was at first unable to play it on my DVD player.  If this happens to you, search the Internet on the brand and model number of your player with the phrase ""remove regional coding"".  There will probably be one or two ways to set it to accept a zero.",1314316800,3,1739,4.8175675675675675
8413682,5,B0042GNE4W,"There is no such thing as a ""completion"" of Mahler's Tenth: you can only ""complete"" a fragment if you provide the missing parts of the autograph, and the composer himself was unable to complete his final symphony. There are, however, several ""performing versions"", among these most frequently heard the final of three by Deryck Cooke, less often Remo Mazzetti's and Joe Wheeler's efforts. Much has been written on this topic. I will only add that I like Cooke III (my favorite is Gielen on CD), also certain aspects of Mazzetti, Wheeler and Clinton A. Carpenter (the latter available in a fine CD recording by Andrew Litton and the Dallas SO), and that all complement each other. I still have minor doubts about Carpenter. Where Cooke does too little, Carpenter does a bit too much: his score is at times quite ""busy"" for late Mahler. Silence, desolation and the slow, quiet unfolding of solace, as we know from the quasi-finished parts, are quintessential to the work. They seem occasionally crowded by Carpenter's array of voices, especially percussion. This said, give Carpenter's version a listen and decide for yourself. Now to the performance. In splendid video and audio (uncompressed, detailed and transparent), the DVD documents a 2009 concert by the Singapore Symphony Orchestra under its music director Lan Shui in the beautiful Esplanade Concert Hall. Lan Shui is a superb musician, his Asian-Western orchestra a first-rate ensemble very much in accord with his deeply moving and powerful approach to the score from beginning to end. Note the careful attention to Mahler's ""quotations"" from his other symphonies, note also the virtuoso playing of all principals. The stunning, highly idiomatic reading of ""what might have been"" is now, next to Gielen's, my first choice Mahler Ten. Could this perhaps be the auspicious beginning of a new and most welcome Mahler cycle on DVD? The disk also has a (dress rehearsal) performance of the contemporary Chinese-French composer Qigang Chen's Five Elements (1998). This is intriguing music, but I am not qualified to comment on it.",1301097600,7,2084,5.132352941176471
8413683,5,B0042GNE4W,"This is a landmark recording in so far as it represents the first dvd/blueray release of a completed Mahler 10th. symphony. Most Mahler fans will be familiar with the Cooke completion in a whole array of cd releases, but as Lan Shui explains in the interview included here, he prefers the Carpenter version. Certainly, this version is much more aggressive in its extra orchestration, especially brass and percussion.

I agree with Charles Eccles that it's all a bit much in the final adagio, but that's because the Cooke version is very sparse in its ""ornamentation"". Had we not heard the Cooke, we might have been less critical. It's still a very moving experience. I personally like the huge octave upward portamento surge just before the end in some Cooke recordings (ignored by some conductors, notably Rattle).This is also missing in this Carpenter completion.

Portamenti (string slides) are a hallmark of Mahler's works, and any performance worth its salt will use every opportunity marked in the score to embrace this effect. This performance takes it to the hilt, and the results are marvellous! I think I enjoyed this opening adagio more than any I've heard recently. The three scherzos are all very well done, with just the right sardonic touch.

This is a very good orchestra, and Lan Shui is a conductor I'll be looking to hear and see more of. The sound and video are impeccable, great dynamic range and really effective dts surround. I chose the blue ray version, because it was only three dollars more than the regular dvd release (I got it from 'import cds' - and in only 3 days, I might add!)

As a side note, I don't know why EuroArts deems it necessary to charge a 50% premium for its blueray vs. its dvds. This is just plain greedy! This Avie blue ray was only $20, as opposed to EuroArts releases being north of $30!

Anyway, buy this disc! If it's successful,  maybe Avie will put out more from this terrific orchestra and conductor. To those who have been disappointed in the blueray releases of some of the Abbado Mahler series because of the lousy sound, try this one! You're gonne love it, especially if you have a decent surround sound system. Every little instrumental detail is evident.

It would be nice to get a Cooke completion on dvd from a first class orchestra and conductor, but I'm not holding my breath. You'd think that the centenary of Mahler's death would  provoke a whole slew of new Mahler video relases, so let's hope 2011 will produce just that.",1297641600,4,2491,4.723502304147465
8413684,4,B0042GNE4W,"My four stars are awarded for the quality of picture, sound and performance, which are all marvelous. The Singapore Symphony cannot quite match the Lucerne Festival Orchestra for virtuosity or passion but they more than hold their own against most other recordings of this symphony (none, however, recorded on DVD or Bluray).

My only quibble is with the Clinton Carpenter completion which, to my ears just does not sound like Mahler - especially in the final adagio. The more commonly recorded Cooke version(s)sound more of a whole: the spareness of the orchestration conveys the anguished tenderness and regret of the last movement better than the lush Max Steiner-like treatment applied by Carpenter. The result is to make this movement a bit bland, not helped by the conductor's decision to edit the Carpenter version by playing down the percussion. Here the bass drum thuds at the start of the adagio hardly register at all, and lack impact.

So, enjoy this version for what it is, but we really need a DVD/Bluray of the Cooke version - ideally from Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic.",1296691200,3,1090,4.983516483516484
