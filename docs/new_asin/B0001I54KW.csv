8012965,3,B0001I54KW,"You expect an instructional DVD to show an item once slowly, then at normal tempo and then in a live situation (Play Along) - Right ? - WRONG.
Too much Yak, frustrating short snipets of the patterns result in frustrating rewinds.
For example in the timbales section on basic pattern we get yak (2mins-50secs) and (8secs)example of the pattern at full speed. On the Bongo Martillo yak(45 secs) and (13 secs) example.
Bongo Tuning (A-La, G-Sol or F-Fa) with an octave different (Macho to Hembra).
It covered Maracas, Guiro, Bongos (Martillo y Bolero-Son Martillo?), Bongo Bell, Timbales (Cascara, 2-3Clave, Guajira-slow Guaracha-Mambo, Cha Cha-Guajira, Ababuci (5-7-9 strokes), Closed Roll (5-7-9 strokes)

Tip:
Word of advice if your set is new and of real skin, soak them first and then tighten, else you might get a split/tear developing along fault lines.

I was tempted to give a 2* but the inclusion of the pamphlet with sheet music and some timbales exercises partly made up.
My advice - save your money and get his excellent book+CD instead 'Play Bongas and Hand Percussions'ISBN:0757910653.
Richie, edit out some of the yak and put it into the pamphlet. Synchronise the pamphlet notes with that of the book (Martillo for example), add Repique and soloing tips for the Bongos.
Add a lot more to the Timbales (maybe Ralph Irizarry might do one ?)and Bongos ( Solos, repiques, Play Along etc).
Show more variations and exercises.
Beef up the Play Along section with inshots for each of the instruments in question, have a continuous play/repeat loop for these parts.
Get the menu sorted, why does the menu have to flip back to the top menu when you are playing a particular submenu (you then have to keep going to the next and next menu list to get your submenu item !!
PS: I love the shirts, any idea where we can get some ?

I would recommend  Kalani's Ultimate Hand Percussion: Ultimate Bongo Jam ASIN: B000EU1OPQ DVD and for Timbales (books & CD)
'The Art of Playing Timbales'[MimFilms]0967309824, 'Tito Puente's Drumming With the Mambo King' ISBN: 0634019562 and 'Changuito: A Master's Approach to the Timbales' by Quintana & Silverman ISBN: 0769214355",1144540800,6,2161,4.9449035812672175
8012966,1,B0001I54KW,"I first order this title last summer and was suprised that the DVD didn't played.  I noticed there wasn't any engraving in the DVD.  It was just a blank DVD.  Amazon gracefully replaced it for another one but this one also ended up being blank, no engraving on the DVD and wouldn't play.  I order Close up on Congas Vol. 1 by the same company and series and this one played.  Which conviced me that this title wasn't being made properly in the factory.  Is there anyone who did buy this DVD that was playable?  I would be carious if any one else had the same problem.  I tried emailing to the company and producer but never received any reply.  So be careful with this title.  I would recommend the ""Close up with Congas Vol 1' DVD.  Very good and informative.",1142035200,2,760,4.319148936170213
