6373959,3,B00JKTFQWE,"It's was nice with fine acting, the writer did quickly bunch together a lot of back story lines. But the message is the most meaningful  part of the movie.",1407715200,,155,4.344827586206897
6373960,2,B00JKTFQWE,Very slow moving play and some of the acting skills weren't very good.  I didn't like the ending much either.  It could have used a little more humor and excitement both.,1407715200,2,170,4.451612903225806
6373961,5,B00JKTFQWE,"Full of laughs with a deep meaning behind it,a must watch:-)",1407283200,8,60,4.545454545454546
6373962,2,B00JKTFQWE,Started off really slow.picked up in the middle but still could have been more energy from the actors. Play had a nice message but it took th last 30 mins to really get to it.,1406505600,,175,4.0285714285714285
6373963,2,B00JKTFQWE,"Not really all that, it's okay I just keep falling asleep on it",1406332800,,63,3.923076923076923
6373964,2,B00JKTFQWE,"I was not aware that this was a play and not a movie. I was a waste of money, couldn't understand the grandpa. I would like a refund.",1406332800,,133,3.7857142857142856
6373965,2,B00JKTFQWE,I'm watching this now I'm 10 minutes in and I don't like it! The pastor grandfather is not funny at all.... Him flirting with his granddaughters is not funny.... I see no since of communication or connection between anyone on the first scene Cynthia Kaye McWilliams reminds me of Boris kudjoe wife Nicole ari Parker.... But where's the audience.... ThIs here.... Needs a laugh track because keke and Cynthia is messing up my mood they just arguing but I'm only on the first scene,1405555200,,479,4.714285714285714
6373966,4,B00JKTFQWE,"Unlike the first reviewer, I thought that the storyline was strong and it was a good play. The characters were well played, by the actors and the message was a strong one. Angie blames every one for her misfortunes except for that no-count bum of a fiance. Angie's bitterness for her past keeps her from perusing her dreams of becoming a singer. She even rejects her son of giving his life over to GOD and being active in the church, but the story has it's twists as well. I don't want to tell you too much. We need to support struggling artist that are trying to give a positive and deep message into their work.",1405555200,13,613,4.339130434782609
6373967,1,B00JKTFQWE,"I hope Sheen/Michaels Entertainment finds a way to sue them for the theft of the movie name (copyright infringement). I guess once Zalman King died, they thought they could use the name. This movie is awful. There's nothing like using the name of their diety(who frowns on profitting in his name) while thieving the name from another, much better movie.",1405296000,,353,4.9
6373968,1,B00JKTFQWE,"I have to be honest here tried to  hang in there  to watch this but I couldn't  , because it was just  that boring, from the very beginning I do think that KeKe Wyatt is a good actress, but this movie just didn't do it for me.",1464307200,,226,3.74468085106383
6373969,4,B00JKTFQWE,I enjoyed the message  the signing with the mother and daughter was out of sync but would recommend it. And just going to church but not in a  relationship with God wow when she mentioned that a lot people today think it's all about going to church(building) and when parents try to live there dreams through kids. Good message.,1462320000,,328,4.5423728813559325
6373970,5,B00JKTFQWE,kids need to know their fathers  unless  the woman don't know  or  for some reason trying to hold on the a wolf in sheep's clothing,1461369600,,131,4.12
6373971,1,B00JKTFQWE,"I was very disappointed in this movie.  It was boring and poorly done.  I enjoy movies with God's true message and that's why I ordered this movie.  I thought with a title like, In God's Hands,  that it should be good,  but I couldn't stand it!  The actors appearances are appauling and the acting does not appeal to me in the least.  I really tried to enjoy it and watched it through but I was so glad when it was done.  It was a total waste of my time and money.  If it wasn't that the postage to return it would cost nearly what I paid for the movie,  I would most certainly return it.  But I won't waste my time ever watching it again. The singing wasn't bad but I didn't buy the movie for the music.",1458000000,,704,4.028985507246377
