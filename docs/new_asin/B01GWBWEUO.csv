I bought this from a different supplier so it will not appear as a verified purchase on amazon. However, I feel that I must warn potential purchasers that this version of the movie has been re-edited to remove about 13 minutes of running time for such obscure reasons as one of the characters saying the word 'damn' under his breath. The ""reasoning"" for each deletion appears to be driven by the extreme religious views of the producers of this appalling version of a truly beautiful, loving and inspiring movie when seen in its unexpurgated form as is supplied by amazon separately. The full 104 minute movie has been approved by the 'Dove Foundation for family viewing and I heartily concur especially when viewers take the trouble to play all of the deleted scenes to truly flesh out the wonderful story. I give the producers credit for refunding my purchase price but strongly advise everyone to avoid wasting your time and money on this truncated version.",1485475200,,1097,5.458823529411765
