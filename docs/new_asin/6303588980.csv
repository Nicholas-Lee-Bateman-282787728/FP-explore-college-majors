This movie will keep anyone riveted to their chair during the entire play time and the suspense will keep muscles taut and neck hairs  twitching until the last scene.

687519,5,6303588980,"""See No Evil"" is a suspense-thriller not unlike many films made by Sir Alfred Hitchcock. Not as skillfully executed but suspenseful nonetheless. I saw this film on tv back in the 1970's and was transfixed. I never forgot those boots with the stars on them. The film has old school pacing. It was made in 1971 so that should come as no surprise. Life was a little slower paced back then as were films. Mia Farrow is very convincing. Her character is very sympathetic. This film requires a viewer to be empathetic. Sociopathic personalities will not enjoy this film. There are a few coincidences story-wise but they are not completely unreasonable. Overall, the film still works.",1464393600,3,677,4.844827586206897

687523,1,6303588980,"I saw this as a kid and thought it was just an awful ripoff off Wait Until Dark.  It has not gotten better with time.  1.5 hours of Mia Farrow crying, groping, falling down stairs, falling in mud, stepping on broken glass, all with zero suspense since we know she will be rescued.

Why all these 5 star reviews?",1460073600,,311,4.237288135593221

687837,5,6303588980,"Really a feat that this suspenser is so satisfying to watch after 40+ years. Modern thriller/horror filmmakers could learn a valuable lesson by watching this film. Dated yes, but still packs a punch. I don't think it's giving away much (since it happens in the first scene) but the fact that the killer slaughters an entire family because they splashed water on his boots as they drove by in their car is just too funny to me. Most random motive ever. Only adds to the charm of this movie.",1413676800,,489,4.50561797752809

687842,4,6303588980,I originally saw this when it came out in the 70's.  Having told my daughter about it we watched it together.  She was mesmerized.  It's dated but riveting and suspenseful.  Mia Farrow is stupendous !,1400025600,,200,4.628571428571429
687843,2,6303588980,"Good performance by Farrow, but the film is a little far-fetched , with no explanation of the killer's motives.  Decent time-waster.",1395360000,,132,5.285714285714286
687844,4,6303588980,"I remember watching this with my mom on TV around 1972-73, and being scared out of my wits.
So I re watched it 40+ years later and I must say it held up well.
Sure, it's long and drags in places, but it there's an eerie, wet curtain of dread that pervades throughout that I love.",1395187200,,279,4.0
687845,4,6303588980,"Fragile, waiflike, and tentative, Mia Farrow was absolutely perfectly cast in ROSEMARY'S BABY, and spent much of the next ten years (until she met Woody Allen, who gave her more varied parts) playing the prey for Satanists, murderers, witches, and ghosts. In one of the more beautifully done of these victim stints, she plays Sarah, a woman who comes to live with her aunt and uncle and their daughter after she is blinded in a horse accident. Early in the this film, she returns from a day of riding to their beautifully appointed mansion in the autumnal English countryside: the utter silence in the house and the low camera angles suggest something is not right. The director, Richard Fleischer, takes him time as we watch Sarah navigate through the house's many halls and rooms, making coffee for herself in the kitchen; we see broken glass  (which she narrowly avoids stepping on, through pure luck) on the floors, but we still don't know what's wrong until she's in bed, and we see her beautiful cousin's corpse sprawled out unnaturally in the bed next to her. All the family have been slaughtered.

This scene is so scary and carefully done that almost nothing could compare to it... and for  long time, nothing in the film does. Fleischer films everything beautifully, though, and scarily shows the killer (who wears star-embossed cowboy boots) only at a low level, so you don't find out who he is until the end of the film. Unlike WAIT UNTIL DARK (its clear direct inspiration), the film does not act to empower its blind heroine so much as to use her handicap as an opportunity by which she might be subjected to all sorts of nasty spills and mishaps: of course eventually she does step on that broken glass in the kitchen, and also runs through the wrong door leading into the cellar, rides a horse into a low-hanging branch, tumbles down a steep muddy hillside... it all gets to be a bit much. (The biggest suspense in this long middle section is actually whether the terrified Farrow will stumble in her panic into the many priceless vases and fragile objets d'art her relatives have somewhat tactlessly left on the side tables in all their long hallways.) The film does have a great final sequence, though, involving Farrow washing off in a bathroom.",1393372800,2,2264,4.741116751269035
687846,5,6303588980,this is an edge of your seat picture mia farrow is excellent as a blind girl with no idea of what is happening until she gets into big trouble won't tell anymore so  i won't spoil it for you but if you like suspense this is the movie for you. its comparable with 'see no evil'  with audrey hepburn,1390003200,,297,4.016949152542373
687952,5,6303588980,"Modern horror/suspense film makers could learn a thing or two from films like this! Very little actual violence is shown, yet the suspense is unnerving at times! We see the aftermath of violence that has taken place, and that as the blind woman innocently moves among it chills!
This terrific cult classic still holds up over time! A blind woman alone in a house of murder vs a crazed murderer looking for something he lost...
Must see!",1384300800,,436,4.675324675324675
687953,5,6303588980,Watched this movie whin I was very young.  I have always remembered it and so wanted to see it agan.  It was such a great treat to see it on Amazon and be able to watch it again.  It holds up and is still very good.,1383350400,,215,3.630434782608696
687954,4,6303588980,"Mia Farrow stars as Sarah, an English horsewoman who was recently blinded. When she comes home after rehabilitation, a mysterious maniac starts stalking her family and she must fight the unseen killer for her life.

There are several shockingly scary scenes that definitely made me gasp; one feels Sarah's helplessness and terror. I found it odd, however, that in some of the most dramatic moments, there was no music. Some scary music would certainly heighten the intensity.

Farrow is convincing as a blind woman but has affected a little-girl voice and bleating scream that gets old fast.

Another negative is that the killer's motive is so incredibly insignificant, I was left scratching my head and wondering, ""Is that it?""

It's a good story with a pretty setting in a horsey manor house. Despite its few flaws, I was entertained and frightened.",1382832000,,851,5.01418439716312
687955,2,6303588980,"Mia farrow used the same acting techniques in ""See No Evil.""  I would have liked to see more of the killer throughout the movie.  All I saw were his boots for the most part.  I would rearrange the story to show the murder of the girl's family and how the murderer became a murderer.  The end reveal takes the ""fright and horror"" out of the movie.",1381708800,2,346,4.196969696969697

687958,4,6303588980,"Really like this thriller - atmospheric and creepy. Sure, Farrow overacts a bit and makes weird noises ... but then, I've never been visually impaired, had my family slaughtered and been left to fend for my life blindfolded against a mad serial killer. So who am I to judge her acting.

Definitely worth a watch.",1371945600,,312,4.672727272727273
687959,4,6303588980,"""See no Evil"" has some truly wonderful moments within it but it's ultimately a generally entertaining little movie, but nothing more. Mia Farrow has fallen victim to some sort of an accident while riding a horse which seems to suggest she some how unfortunately lost her eye sight as a result of the ordeal. She returns home for a visit, and this is when we are treated to the best parts of this movie. As Mia's Character learns to find her way around and re-adjust to life in a world of darkness, she characterizes these aspects so well that it really makes us think about how it really must be to suffer the scourge of blindness. She is quickly associated as a person with a great sense of will and determination, so when she is asked by one of the other characters in the film ""What's it like?"" we nearly expect her to say ""It really isn't so bad, you get used to it"". Instead she declares ""It's bloody horrible"". I really admired the script for allowing us to see this plight in a more realistic manner. Mia Farrow lovingly creates a wonderful performance. She's superb and believable as a vulnerable blind woman in peril. She has always had this earthy, doe like quality to her. She's so sweet and innocent that she fits well into these characters being pursued in horrible ways because she is so delicate that the audience wants so badly to reach out and help her. Not a great movie but farrow's performance is very worthy.",1371772800,2,1429,4.5
687960,5,6303588980,"I haven't seen this movie since it came out in 71'. It isn't the same as I remembered, but I enjoyed it. I think that part of the reason is because Mia reminds me of her mother in this movie.",1370995200,,191,3.8
687961,5,6303588980,"This is an oldie, but goodie. I remember being scared to death by this movie as a kid. Of course, horror movies have changed quite a bit in the last 40 years. You youngsters may get bored. Movie buffs will like it. A blind Mia Faro is the ultimate victim.",1361232000,2,255,4.12

688051,5,6303588980,"I loved this movie.  The cast is excellent, the performances are first rate, the plot is excellent and the pace is very suspensful.  It deals with a blind young woman ( Farrow ) who returns home to find her family has been murdered.  How and when she realizes the evils took place...and how she deals with it...are the focus of this first rate story.  Highly recommended!",1360108800,3,371,4.575757575757576
688052,4,6303588980,IT TAKES YOU BACK TO A SIMPLER TIME IN MOVIES.  MUCH MORE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE MOVIE WAS IN THE ACTING RATHER THAN TECHNOLOGY.  IT WAS THE SUSPENSE AND DRAMA  OF THE MOVIE THAT I ENJOYED.,1359504000,,188,4.027027027027027

688054,5,6303588980,"I first saw this waaayyyy back in the early 70s when I was 16 years old. Its scariness lingered throughout my life (I'm now in my 50s!), and when my youngest son, who's 14 wanted to watch scary movies for Halloween night, I remembered See No Evil and Mia Farrow's excellent performance. Except for the very end, which seems rather abrupt, this is truly a classic and doesn't rely on gratuitous sex (no sex at all, in fact) or explicit language to keep you on the edge of your seat. A surprise ending in who the true killer is is the coup de grace. Enjoy!",1353456000,3,554,4.285714285714286

688058,5,6303588980,The best Hitchcock movie never made by Hitchcock. It is also I think the best movie Mia Farrow ever made. She gives an outstanding and believable performance as a blind girl. While she is out visiting with her boyfriend her family back home is murdered. When she comes home she thinks her relatives are out of the house. In fact they are dead all around the house. It is not until the next day she makes the grizzly discovery of her family being killed. At the same time the murderer realizes he has left behind an important piece of evidence at the house that will connect him to the crimes. Now he has to go back to the scene of the crime to retrieve the evidence and Mia Farrow has to run for her life to prevent becoming the killer's next victim. As the movie progresses the suspense slowing increases. The movie does start a little slow but once you get into the story it does indeed pick up the pace.,1324339200,3,906,4.304093567251462

It had an impact on me, and I found myself looking back over the years and appreciating it more and more.  See No Evil has the ability to transport the viewer into its strange eerie world with a sense of realism and terror.  I love the simplicity of the storyline, the beautiful English setting, the acting, and the the overall creepiness! I still have a mad crush on the boyfriend too....DREAMY!!! Another fave English suspense film that was on late night TV was ""And Soon the Darkness"" with Pamela Franklin.  Unfortunately it is difficult to find.",1260748800,2,636,4.4655172413793105
688133,5,6303588980,Excellent film.  People forget what it was like to see a good mystery/thriller without a lot of CG and bad acting--here is one!  The tension is palpable with Mia Farrow's exemplary performance.  You can feel her fear.,1236384000,2,217,4.8108108108108105
688134,5,6303588980,"I saw this movie as a child in Cali, Colombia in English with Spanish subtitles. It made a huge impression on me and I went to see it several times. Sara, played by Mia Farrow, is a young woman who has recently lost her sight. She is still learning how to operate as a blind woman in a sighted world and is visiting her aunt, uncle and cousin on their country estate. While she is out on a date with her boyfriend, her family is brutally murdered. When she returns home, she goes about the business of getting ready for bed. The audience sees what she cannot: the bodies of her aunt, uncle and cousin. The suspense begins there, when you know she will inevitably discover their bodies, as she does. The panic she feels is palpable and sets the tone for the rest of the film. The killer has inadvertently left an identifying calling card behind, one which she discovers by accident, just in time for him to come back and search for it. The race is on as Sara eludes the murderer in an attempt to avoid the fate her family met. Throughout the film there are visual clues to the killers identity but the culprit is still a surprise. Great suspense without the gore that is so often part of horror flicks nowadays.",1196812800,6,1210,4.3584070796460175
688135,4,6303588980,"British film of the Vietnam era with Farrow stealing the show  in her role as a blinded girl recovering her place in the world. She's just beginning to re-connect with a former boyfriend when a mass murderer goes on a rampage, killing her entire household in beautiful,rural England. While the motive for the murders remains a mystery, it's Farrow who finds the corpses, a full 18 hours after their demise. It seems quite a ""stretch"" that the muderer, given several opportunities to kill Farrow too, especially at the end of the film,fails to do so. But, Farrow's incredible perfomance,surpassing that of Audrey Hepburn in ""Wait Until Dark"",has the power to overcome most of the weak points in the film's script. In summary, it's now a difficult film to locate, but one well worth the search.",1194566400,5,792,4.866666666666666
688136,3,6303588980,"It may have been scary back in 1971, but this slow paced thriller gave me a bit of a yawn and I needed to reach for the fast forward button to get to the good bits. This film reminds me of another english thriller called FRIGHT which is about a baby sitter.

Mia Farrow is convincing as a blind woman who returns to a house where her auntie and uncle have been murdered, but she does not realise straight away.  The killer returns to collect an item he left behind and she must fend for her life.

Has been done better in alot of other films. You could easily give this a miss. In fact, I just saved you 90 minutes of your life. You can thank me later.",1184112000,2,652,4.038759689922481

Mia Farrow (Rosemary's Baby) is Sarah, a blind woman who is staying w/ relatives in the country for some rest and relaxation. Well, she is rudely interrupted by a local maniac (we only get to see his legs and distinctive cowboy boots) who slaughters her family while she's out. Sarah returns home, unaware of the carnage around her. She walks through the big house, right past the dead bodies! Sarah's blindness works extremely well to heighten the tension.

Who would have thought she, being blind, could miss stepping on glass scattered in the kitchen on several trips through the room. And why would they put her in a bed when she is coverd in mud and clay without at least wiping some of the goo off her?And by the end of the movie, you'll wish someone would shoot the guy in the cowboy boots if he doesn't quit strutting.",1122249600,7,542,4.122641509433962
688139,5,6303588980,"When this movie first came out, I never dreamed the day would come that I could actually own any movie.  It was one of my favorite thrillers, and it showcased Mia Farrow's talent as a serious actor. I had to keep going back to the theater to see it again. There was something really terrifying about a helpless blind woman being alone in a house with her dead relatives scattered here and there.  The bath scene was the spookiest....What is especially satisfying is the fact that it can still hold its own as a thriller. It is just down right scary. In spite of the fact that the hairstyles and wardrobe are obviously dated, it gets five stars from me for a movie worth owning and watching again and again.",1094169600,16,706,4.423076923076923
688140,5,6303588980,"This is a classic suspense thriller from the hands of a very talented and skilled director! Mia Farrow's performance is very convincing and she OWNS this role! This takes us back to a time in cinema when a movie could be suspenseful and terrifying WITHOUT the use of gore and loads of profanity! Being a fan of slasher films, I can appreciate the time and effort that was put into crafting this wonderful movie. This film, from 1971, could lend a number of fine themes/techniques to modern day filmmakers. If it hasn't inspired other directors in some way or another, IT SHOULD HAVE!
I thoroughly enjoy the theme of a blind woman in peril!  I realize that there are other films with similar themes...but this is a classic thriller that is well directed...well acted...and beautifully shot!
This film has beautiful cinematography and a fine music score! There's much to enjoy about this film! If you haven't seen it, by all means, WATCH IT!
Highly recommended! This is an excellent movie!",1068076800,,987,4.805882352941176
688141,4,6303588980,"Newly Blinded woman (and an orphan too) recently discharged from the rehabilitation center, comes to spend the weekend with her Aunt and Uncle on their estate.  She wistfully pets the horses she knows she will never ride again.  She spurns the boyfriend she can never marry now (despite his proposal). She seems to get off on the wrong foot with the new gardener who hangs around the stables.  And they all have such charming English accents !  Life like this could go on forever until  ...
A madman ransacks the house and kills all the occupants (what a surprise) !
When our intrepid heroine returns from spurning the aforementioned boyfriend, she wanders blithely around the house almost but never quite tripping over her dead relatives.  Sadly for her, the killer realizes that he left behind incriminating evidence so now he must return to finish what he started.  As she  realizes the danger she is in, a race for survival begins
While slow in some spots it does have quite a bit of action.  It was suspenseful and there were enough suspects wandering about the place that the mad killer is a surprise.  If you like to watch helpless women be chased around the English countryside by a serial killer then this movie is well worth your time.",1054080000,13,1245,4.695852534562212

7851174,5,6303588980,"I owned this on VHS years ago, but it was a copy of a copy of a copy taped off late-night-commercial-filled TV, so the quality was bad, and the station that ran it had the unfortunate habit of playing bizarre music starting about 4-5 seconds before they showed a screen-still of their station logo before going into commercials, which was a mood-killer.  Even so, I loved this movie, and the chance to own a quality version, uncut, no commercials or bizarre music. was too good to pass up.  It isn't bloody and gory, it isn't a scare-a-minute, but it is suspenseful, and I still love it almost 40 years later!",1522281600,,609,4.527272727272727

If you are looking for a thriller that's more about suspense than blood and gore, this is a great film to check out.",1506297600,,254,4.521739130434782
7851179,5,6303588980,"Mia Farrow is brilliant in this horsey horror. Set in Berkshire, England, in 1971, it doesn't go too deeply into equestrian detail, but the detail shown is essentially accurate. Her character has had a head injury from a horseriding fall and at present she cannot see, and soon she becomes drawn into a series of murders. Gorehounds although this is a PG there is plenty of blood, although not all of the related action is onscreen. The English location and the interiors will win you over if you enjoy this sort of film making. If you enjoy this title try Slaughter and the Halloween-themed Mischief Night.",1504224000,,607,4.735849056603773
