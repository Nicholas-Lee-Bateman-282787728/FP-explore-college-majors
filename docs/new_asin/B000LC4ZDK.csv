2702475,5,B000LC4ZDK,"This is a great set.  Fox made this an economical set by putting 4 films on 2 double sided discs....which I think is quite fair--these films aren't as famous as the Chan and Moto films and probably won't sell as well.  Despite that, these films are wonderful programmers.  Those who only know Lloyd Nolan from his later TV work will be quite surprised by his range in these films.

Fox still offers DRESSED TO KILL(1941), another film in this series, separately.  I suspect it will turn up again when they release Volume 2 of this series.  I personally think DRESSED TO KILL is one of the best in the series and highly recommended.",1175212800,12,631,4.539823008849558
2702476,4,B000LC4ZDK,"First off, I must warn you that I've only rented disc 1 of this, but I would guess that the second disc isn't going to be a drastic change in quality, so I'm going to comment now since I'm full of enthusiasm.

I checked MICHAEL SHAYNE out because I've been enjoying the Mr. Moto movies that Fox has been reissuing.  Like the Moto movies, Fox has done a great restoration and remastering job on these.  But the real appeal is the movies -- full of humor, snappy dialogue, and solid performances, this is truly a superior B-movie mystery series.

Lloyd Nolan plays Shayne as a smart-aleck, with an insanely acute sense of comic timing, especially with his throwaway one-liners.  But Shayne also portrays an intelligence that you get the sense that he's just playing the fool so that you don't notice how far ahead of the game he is.  (In fact, the mysteries always seem to have bewilderingly convoluted solutions that might leave you scratching your head during the end credits.)

A real fun set of pulp pictures.",1174694400,53,1011,4.646067415730337
2702477,5,B000LC4ZDK,"This series of movies was a contemporary of the Chan and Moto films.  This is a reliable set of B movies with good writing and lots of good characters.  One distinguishing feature of these films comes from the writing.  While the character and first feature are based on the stories of Brett Halliday, many of the films were based on or written by some of the best pulp writers of the day.  Good workmanship is apparent in all these films.  Lloyd Nolan does a very credible job as the lead.  True, he may not be Humphrey Bogart, but is very watchable nonetheless.  If you like a good, quick mystery or a fan of Chan or Moto, get this set.  You will not be disappointed.",1170374400,106,669,4.338709677419355

2702569,5,B000LC4ZDK,"The good: Enjoyable stories with a very likable detective and interesting plots.

The bad: Most episodes didn't have the end cast credits so you need to search for it on the internet. Otherwise, trying to remember those minor character actors you recognize, but can't put a name to, will drive you crazy.

The really bad: DOUBLE SIDED DISCS. You won't want to borrow this set out because they are twice as easy to damage if your friends are not as careful as you are.

The disappointing: No Volume 2. Only Volume 1 was issued back in 2007. There are discs selling with only one episode on them, but they cost any where from 4x as much to 11x as much. Not a wise investment if you are on a budget.",1483574400,,696,4.338461538461538

2702597,5,B000LC4ZDK,"I have a fantasy where the major studios take great care to release their old movies on DVD (even B-Movies).
The dream started to come true back in 2007 when Fox Home Video released the ""Michael Shayne Mystery Collection, Volume One"".
Then my dream was shattered.
There never was a Volume Two.
Instead Fox released the remaining three films starring Lloyd Nolan in dribs and drabs.
The situation is even worse with the five Hugh Beaumont films - only one is available on DVD.

LLOYD NOLAN AS MICHAEL SHAYNE:
1940: Michael Shayne, Private Detective *
1941: Sleepers West *
1941: Dressed to Kill **
1942: Blue, White and Perfect *
1942: The Man Who Wouldn't Die *
1942: Just Off Broadway ***
1942: Time to Kill ****

* ""Michael Shayne Mysteries, Volume 1"" REVIEWED ON THIS PAGE
Back in 2007, four of the seven films were packaged in a two DVD boxed set.
All films had subtitles, and the box included several interesting featurettes about Michael Shayne.
I have been patiently waiting for Volume Two, but it is not to be.
Instead we have had to buy individual DVDs of:
**&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dressed-to-Kill/dp/B0009X75CO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dressed to Kill</a>&nbsp;(with subtitles),
not to be confused with the 1946 Sherlock Holmes movie of the same title
***&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JUST-OFF-BROADWAY/dp/B00OTAD9WI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JUST OFF BROADWAY</a>&nbsp;(DVD-R, no subtitles)

**** ""TIME TO KILL"" has not been released yet, though Amazon has assigned a stock index number to it:
ASIN: B005QCH5MI
Apparently it will be a DVD-R without subtitles.
Under ""DVDs & Movies"", type ""Time to Kill 1942"" on the  Amazon search bar.
""Time to Kill"" may be the most interesting film in the series.
It was adapted from a Raymond Chandler Philip Marlowe novel (""The High Window""), two years before Marlowe debuted on film under his own name (in ""Murder My Sweet"", 1944)
Hard to believe, but in the 1940s, author Brett Halliday outsold Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett as a writer of detective fiction.
Wise-cracking Private Eye Michael Shayne was featured in 69 novels published between 1939 and 1977.

The seven Lloyd Nolan movies were produced by Twentieth Century Fox's B-Movie division
The Fox series ended in 1942, but four years later it was revived by PRC (Producers Releasing Corporation) for a series of five films with Hugh Beaumont (better known as Beaver Cleaver's father).
PRC was strictly Poverty Row.
Even Monogram looked down on PRC.
The Lloyd Nolan movies are great fun, and even the Hugh Beaumont PRC films are not without their charms.
You just have to like B-Movies.

HUGH BEAUMONT AS MICHAEL SHAYNE:
1946: Murder Is My Business
1946: Larceny in Her Heart
1946: Blonde for a Day =&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blonde-for-a-Day/dp/B0081LCRJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blonde for a Day</a>

These beauties were knocked out 3 or 4 a year, sometimes. Each detective, of course, had his modus operandi, just as every singing cowboy did. Some were good at small clues, had connections in the obscure corners of society, were high class, were low class. We first meet Shayne having his office furniture repossessed. In another film he tricks his fianc into giving him $1000 he needs to buy a steamship ticket so he can pursue the stolen industrial diamonds, by pretending it is the down payment on their home to be. She thinks he's having a fling with the client, always a dame, and calls the cops on him. He solves the crimes by barging on ahead and winging it, by having a quick wit and a readiness to try anything. He does not gather everyone together and explain what ""really happened"" at the end, thus exposing the guilty party. It's fun to watch him get out of scrape after scrape by the skin of his teeth, and I enjoyed all 4 movies. The prints were restored, so were easy to watch.

2702790,5,B000LC4ZDK,"If you are a Shayne dame you are dazzling to the eyes, soft to the touch, and just a bit smarter than Michael Shayne, but you do have one weakness. You have eyes for Michael Shayne, and when you are not looking, he can step right into that blind spot of yours and fool and trick you in more ways than you know. If you want to wear his wedding ring, you have got to catch him between cases. Because Mike has his priorities: cases first, dames second, and marriage a distant third. If Mike has just solved a case, you have got to act fast, very fast, because he'll forget about marriage at the drop of a body.

Sometimes, you'll find Mike exasperating. If you are mad at him just when you think you have hooked him, or you have discovered that he has been cavorting around with another dame, or you uncover another untruthful story he has told you, hey, just throw a few things at him, what the heck, he is the forgiving sort, he won't be mad at you, he'll just write it off as something a crazy dame like you just does.

If you are a bad guy or gal and Mike is on the job, you'll wish you had chosen another career.

If you are a police detective, your puffed-up dignity is going to be deflated, when Mike is on the case.

These are great movies with many fun scenes. My favorite scene is when Mike rings up his fiancee from a store pay phone in Blue, White and Perfect. You have to see and hear this one. Great stuff!

Twentieth Century Fox reproduction quality: excellent. Fox included an interesting extra on paperback artist Robert McGinnis.",1253232000,2,1544,4.273972602739726
2702791,5,B000LC4ZDK,"It is too bad more people don't know about Lloyd Nolan as Michael Shayne. He was brilliant in the part, both comical and tough, but never too much of either. He played the part as an everyman who sometimes got himself into more trouble than he could handle, and in every corner of his life from work to women. Often the two mixed. This inexpensive set features four of Nolan's films as Shayne, and they're well worth the buy.

The set starts off with Michael Shayne, Private Detective, an appropriate introduction to the series. Shayne is hired to babysit a reckless millionaire's daughter. On the job, he tries to play a little trick on her, but it backfires big time. Soon the girl's playboy boyfriend is dead, and Shayne is fingered as the prime suspect.

The Man Who Wouldn't Die concerns a rich heiress who has recently married. Shayne is hired to impersonate her husband in order to protect her. It seems that late during the night, an intruder tried to murder her in her sleep! Furthermore, the suspect has long been dead.

Sleeper's West is the best film of the series, a tightly crafted mystery that unfolds in 74 minutes. Shayne is aboard a train carrying an important witness to a murder case; it is his job to see that she is protected. However, some of the passengers would like to get at her, whether it be to scoop her or to bump her off. In fact, she isn't too keen on being cooped up herself, so Mike has a lot of job on his hands.

Blue, White, and Perfect rounds out the set. Shayne is supposed to be settling down with a job as a welder so he can get married, but he quickly finds himself on a case. Some industrial diamonds have been stolen and the smugglers are hiding the loot in designer dresses bound for Hawaii. Thus, Mike follows them and runs into a few friends along the way.

Additionally, there are a few featurettes with hokey gimmicks, but they are very informative. One disk has a trivia game and others contain trailers and restoration comparisons.",1250467200,2,1983,4.497222222222222
2702792,4,B000LC4ZDK,I hesitated ordering these movies since I had never seen them. But I was pleasantly surprised.  I am a big fan of this kind of old movie with a mixture of humor and mystery.  I enjoyed the stories and the acting.,1237939200,2,212,4.146341463414634

Being a big mystery fan I purchased sight unseen.  Well worth the splurge.  If you like Mannix, Naked City, Peter Gunn or noir in gereral then I'd recommend checking out this first set of Michael Shayne.

My biggest gripe is that Volume 2 is taking so long.",1234742400,6,432,4.545454545454546

2702795,5,B000LC4ZDK,"As far as fictional detectives go, Michael Shayne is not really well-known nowadays; in fact, most of the books featuring him are out-of-print.  The Michael Shayne movies are also almost forgotten, and Lloyd Nolan, Shayne's portrayer on screen, is not one of the most remembered names of 1940s cinema.  However, as shown in the Michael Shayne Mysteries collection, these little B-movies are enjoyable little gems.

This two-disc boxed set has four movies, and though titled Volume 1, there is (as yet) no second volume with the remaining movies.  Shayne is a private eye with a quick, light wit and the hard luck to always need some money.  He is introduced in Michael Shayne, Private Detective, in which he is retained as a babysitter for a young woman with a gambling habit.  Shayne's plot to break her of the habit involves faking a murder, but this goes haywire when the faked murder turns out to be a real one.

In The Man Who Wouldn't Die, Shayne is hired by a rich young woman who suspects there is a ghost in her house.  He poses as her husband and ferrets out the non-supernatural culprit.  Sleepers West, filmed a decade or so before the more well-known Narrow Margin, has a similar plot:  Shayne needs to escort a reluctant witness on a train, where there are various other goings on going on.  Finally, Blue, White and Perfect has Shayne on a cruise ship out to stop the smuggling of stolen industrial diamonds by an enemy government; this last film also has a pre-Superman George Reeves.

All these movies are short (the longest is 77 minutes), and filled with a humor that moves the story right along.  I had never been all that impressed with Nolan in other movies I'd seen him, but here he is just great and he carries all the films.  In addition, each film has its own little extra featurette (or in one case, an interactive trivia guide); my favorite is a short documentary on Robert McGinnis who illustrated many of the original Shayne paperbacks and serves as a reminder that book cover illustrations are not nearly as interesting as they used to be.  Yes, none of this quartet of movies are Oscar contenders, but this set will be a lot of fun for its viewers.",1227398400,2,2180,4.625974025974026
2702796,5,B000LC4ZDK,"Over the past 18 months, I've watched each of the four films included in this set twice---because I obviously enjoy them. They are not the best written or best produced films ever made by a long shot, but they are some of the best 'pre-Noir' detective/mystery films ever made.

Lloyd Nolan was perfect as Mike Shayne, a combination of hard-boiled (when he needed to be) and thoroughly human (though his humor and wit).

At the low price for four films, I would heartily recommend this set.

My only 'problem' is that I have waited over a year now for 'VOLUME 2'. Granted, another Shayne, DRESSED TO KILL, has been released separately and will probably not be included in a future set, but there is NO indication at all that more 'Shaynes' will be forthcoming.

Is the difficulty in packaging only the remaining two Lloyd Nolan Shaynes in a set? Is it that there are two studios involved and sets cannot be made that include both Nolan's and the later Hugh Beaumont films? Is it that Volume 1 did not sell sufficiently to generate a second and even a third set???

There are two more Lloyd Nolan films and five Hugh Beaumont vehicles. A couple of the Beaumonts are as good as the Nolan efforts, and while the remaining three are weaker and a bit uneven, why not release them to bring the series to completion???",1227139200,11,1310,4.5574468085106385

2702820,4,B000LC4ZDK,"Michael Shayne (Lloyd Nolan) is a short, spunky Irishman (with a hint of New York chutzpah), an ex-cop who is now a private detective.  He's usually low on cash, fast with his fists and knowledgeable about local low lifes.  In other words, a typical 1940s private eye.

This series isn't well known, but it's worth discovering.

The prints in this release are first-rate, and the writing and acting are a step above the usual B level.  At the same time, some of the Shayne movies seem to run out of plot -- or perhaps they just ran out of money -- before the end, so don't expect total perfection.

The best of the this bunch is ""The Man Who Wouldn't Die.""  The plot borders on the ridiculous, and the ending is forced and unbelievable, but the atmospheric ""ghost house"" is wonderful.  ""Michael Shayne, Private Detective"" is probably the second best.

This four-pack is well worth your dough.  The only complaint I have is that the four films are stuffed onto two disks, front and back.

2702823,4,B000LC4ZDK,"The Michael Shayne movies (based around Brett Halliday's fictional super-sleuth), are some of the most enjoyable B-movies, starring Lloyd Nolan (best-remembered for playing Doc in ""Peyton Place"") in the title role.  This box set features four classic films from the original franchise.

MICHAEL SHAYNE, PRIVATE DETECTIVE (1940): Cash-strapped Mike is called on to help keep an eye on a gambling-addicted debutante (Marjorie Weaver); an assignment which soon dissolves into murder and mayhem.  Co-starring Elizabeth Patterson and Walter Abel.

BLUE, WHITE AND PERFECT (1941): While promising to finally settle down with his impatient fiancee (Mary Beth Hughes), Mike instead cashes in her check for the downpayment on their house, and boards a cruiser headed for Hawaii, where he's soon mixed up with a former girlfriend (Helene Reynolds) and a jewel smuggling operation.  Co-starring George Reeves.

SLEEPERS WEST (1941): Boarding a train with a mystery blonde (Mary Beth Hughes) who's due to be the surprise star witness in an explosive murder trial, Mike hooks up with a wisecracking reporter (Lynn Bari), and uncovers a whole mess of trouble!

THE MAN WHO WOULDN'T DIE (1942): Familiar faces Marjorie Weaver and Helene Reynolds return as different characters in arguably the most entertaining Mike Shayne film in the set.  Mike is called upon to pose as the husband of serial-bride Weaver, whose homecoming is marked by murder, blackmail and a death-defying gunsmith.

This top-value DVD boxset will be relished by classic movie enthusiasts.  These entertaining murder mysteries (with their liberal doses of one-liners and light humour), are a great alternative to the more traditionally-themed Noir titles produced around the same period.
