8192368,5,B000PMAL8Y,Absolutely LOVE it. It's hard to decide between the nine beautiful fires which one to watch sometimes. This DVD Is a must for Christmas and the Holidays. The Aquarium (8) Scenes are stunning and Beautiful to watch also. I just bought this DVD as a Christmas gift for a dear friend because she loved mine so much.,1418428800,,312,4.491228070175438

8192370,5,B000PMAL8Y,"I just got this one a few days ago and I really liked both of the DVD's in this set. I am not in the least regretting that I own them.  They are two totally different subjects so I'll give my review of them separately.

Fireplace TV Jukebox - there are 9 different kinds of fires, from a small intimate fire all the way to a roaring fire. I love the crackling  and popping sounds of the fire especially when it's cold in the house. It's only Sept now, but the house temperature was in the low 60's yesterday morning. I put the fireplace DVD in and even though I KNOW it's not a real fireplace, it made me feel warmer - I'm guessing it's my mind hearing the sounds of the fire - whatever it was - I really enjoyed it and replayed a few times in a row. With Fall and Winter coming on, I know I'll play more of the fireplace DVD's then - I also have Fireplace XL and Fireplace XXL as well as a couple other fireplace videos by Tony Helsloot, so I have a good assortment of different kinds of fires to listen to and be mesmerized by as the weather gets colder.

Aquarium TV Jukebox - This disc has 8 different videos of various fish.  I love watching fish and coral is one of my favorite things to see - the colors are so vivid, so I watched this disc a couple of times too. It has some fish I've never seen before (Discus Bubbles), and many other kinds up to, and including, sharks and rays. I especially liked the tropical tanks because of the coral, but I also was taken back to my childhood when a tank with goldfish video started. I haven't had goldfish for many years now, but watching them swim made me think of long ago and remember that carefree time fondly.

As for the sounds of the Aquariums video, there's a good selection, you have a couple of different (and beautiful)  music tracks to choose from, as well as waves, waves with music, and my personal favorite - North Sea waves. That's something I'd listen to even if there wasn't any video. The sounds of the waves along with the bird sounds takes me to a  peaceful and relaxed state. You also can have a whimsical bubble sound if you prefer that.  All put together, the only thing I could think of to make this even better would have liked to have had even more coral and plant backgrounds.",1410566400,2,2253,4.208816705336427
8192371,2,B000PMAL8Y,I wanted a fireplace and aquarium for my flat screen and didn't research very much before purchased this. I am sure there are better ones on the market. It will do in a pinch.,1231200000,3,175,4.176470588235294
