3512278,4,B001CGBRYE,"While this is not my very favorite film of African animals, and you might find the information rather rudimentary, it is beautifully filmed and a delight to watch.  My ten year old grandson missed seeing a ""kill"" when we were on safari, so this should satisfy him (while perhaps be off putting to the squeamish).  This would be a good addition to your dvds on Africa.  Any with David Attenborough, of course, being first in line.",1316995200,2,429,4.618421052631579
3512279,3,B001CGBRYE,"Interesting but shallow. It presents seven African animals in a normal length film, therefore it dedicates not much time to each of them. Video quality is good. I have seen better films on African animals.",1272931200,4,205,4.885714285714286
3512280,5,B001CGBRYE,"The picture is beautiful.
There are a lot of actions. It shows the lives in 24 hours of Africa's 7 strongest animals. They are: Elephants, rhinos, buffaloes, hyenas, leopard, cheetahs and lions. What makes it different than other DVD of the same kind is it depicts how these 7 animals clash in 24 hours.
The only thing I don't like is it's only 50 minutes long.",1262995200,8,361,4.484848484848484
3512281,5,B001CGBRYE,"We  have been on 3 safaris in the south of Africa,  this DVD is an accurate presentation of what we have seen in person.",1256256000,5,120,3.9583333333333335
3512282,4,B001CGBRYE,"I'm a fan of wildlife and nature videos, specially the HD kind. So this Blu-ray was a pleasant addition to my nature and wildlife collection. The narration is good. The documentary shows an interesting storyline for each of the seven animals. It was sad to see the mother hyena, trying to scavenge food for its cubs, killed by the dominant male lion for no reason. It was intriguing for me to watch & learn for the first time that a lion would track and kill another animal (a female hyena in this case) not for food but just out of spite. Also, I didn't know that buffaloes were capable of scaring away lions to protect their young. One learns how the leopard, which itself is a powerful predator, has to hide its pray out of reach of lions and hyenas. The picture quality and sound were good but not great considering that I have a full HDTV (1080p) with HDMI connections and blu-ray. Overall the documentary is a good learning experience about wild Africa and how different species co-exist.",1251763200,12,994,4.558659217877095
3512283,5,B001CGBRYE,"This movie is worth buying.  The capuring of the animals really bring out the blu ray technology.  I enjoy the background African music.  This was my first Nature Blu ray purchase, and surely I am not disapointed. Again, this is worth getting!!!",1239062400,3,245,4.785714285714286
8287578,5,B001CGBRYE,"Beautifully filmed, great background music, lots of action and stories of magnificent animals well told. A bit gruesome at times. One of the best Xive TV animal documentaries on Amazon Prime that I've seen so far.",1506384000,,213,4.944444444444445

8287585,3,B001CGBRYE,"This video was not able to catch any hunting scene in whole. You will see the chase starts, and then the predator already had the prey pinned down. To connect the broken hunt, there are several flashes in the middle, which were cut from different hunts, and some were even shoot from a chasing camera behind a random prey. At the age of YouTube where amateurs can record the entire hunt uninterrupted, this professional video cannot do its homework left me feeling cheated. The 50 minute length is also too short. At $25 price, the disc is overrated and only deserves a 3-star.",1381449600,,577,4.611650485436893
