8245308,4,B0012E2HCC,"Alex Kovalev was my favorite hockey player when growing up and watching the Rangers.  The DVD is broken down in two sections: On Ice and Off Ice Workouts with elastic bands.

Kovalev shows some pretty good on ice training methods.  The advanced methods may require watching a few times. Wish they did a better job with the camera views.  I think they should have added a few different views to watch from so you could see everything easier.

The elastic band training is good if you have the equipment and a buddy.  I went out and got elastic bands and do my own workouts with other videos, but good to see the different ways to work out.

Check out youtube for some sample clips.

Overall glad I got the DVD + proceeds go to Children's Gift of Life Foundation, which helps children who have heart disease",1324339200,,805,4.465753424657534
8245309,4,B0012E2HCC,"The exercise part of the video was alright.  The hockey skill training part of his video was good too.  I like the individual skill training drills.  His are just like that and simple.  I watch this over and over again and I practice.  On the 2nd DVD, there's a Russian documentary on him.  I never knew much about Kovalev but after watching the video, I find he's an interesting person.  I also thought it wonderful that the profits from the video go to a heart related charity.  Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase",1256342400,,521,4.526881720430108
8245310,3,B0012E2HCC,"It is a great supportive material for people who play hockey professionally and recreationally.

The only problem is I had to return my purchase because of the DVD quality. Every 10-15 seconds the picture just freezes throughout all session. I thought something was wrong with my DVD or I got defected DVD so I returned it hoping that a replacement would help and it didn't!!! Same problem!! All my other DVDs work perfectly but this one. I had to return it indefinitely :(",1236556800,,473,4.698795180722891
8245311,4,B0012E2HCC,"Not knowing what to expect from the video, I was very pleased with the content of the video.  Alexi offers simple, to medium, to advanced on-ice training techniques.  I would recommend the video for any coach or player.",1215820800,,219,4.7368421052631575
