1783864,4,B00006L93J,"I loved ""Guns and Kills"". It's basically a movie that revolves around four guys who are assassins. You get a glimpse of their daily life and you get to see how they kill people. These four guys are actually average joes. You've seen their personalities at work, school, or even at home. They just kill people, and they're actually quite lovable.

The movie seems to take everything in moderation. The action is nice, but doesn't get your blood pumping like Tarantino. The content of the film is thought-provoking, but not too though-provoking to make it one of those art house films like Di-Duk's (""3-Iron"", ""Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... And Spring"") works. The humor frequently appears, and it's delightful... But I can't really call ""Guns and Talks"" a comedy.

I've read a lot of complaints about the pacing of this movie. I found it satisifactory. If the pace were to be slower or faster, I would've have a lower opinion of this movie. The pace is what makes this movie so good; it lets you explore the characters a little bit, and interpret each scene slowly and carefully. To give you an idea about the pace, it's probably about the same as ""Lost in Translation. Those who like their movies a little bit faster, go watch Chan-Wook Park's revenge trilogy (Sympathy for Mr. Vengence, Oldboy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance).

One major thing to be warned about: The humor is more funny if you understand Korean. I have a good grasp of the language (elementary grade, and a few swear words) and the culture. If you're clueless to both elements, YOU'LL STILL FIND THE MOVIE FUNNY. However, you probably won't find some things as funny as others do.",1154390400,,1649,4.758741258741258
1783865,5,B00006L93J,"This movie has the feel of a boy band going assassin.  Where the motives for the hits seem to be a little selfish and mediocre, the antics of the characters and the dynamic of their live-in work relationship fits the tone of the story.  The humor and light hearted dialogue don't really put one in the mind of a bunch of cold hearted killers but of collage dorm mates working together on a tricky final exam.

What more can I say?  I loved it!",1140825600,,443,4.238095238095238

1783867,1,B00006L93J,"This movie SUCKS. Extremely slow pace, boring, uninspired acting. Totally lame and weak.",1126224000,2,88,5.846153846153846
1783868,4,B00006L93J,"Very entertaining, good-spirited, and generally lighthearted.

It is not weighed down by an overt pursuit of thematic ambitions that are usually associated with assassination movies, so, while it lacks the punch of something else with any apparent ulterior motive (maybe the recent Assassination Tango would be a good example), it floats free... I was able to laugh without wondering why or feeling guilty about it... and while confronted with the characters sometimes ambiguous feelings about their jobs at times, it's kind of matted over with a general feeling of good cheer and ""hey, let's not get too serious"".  Stylistically it's not as admirable as other films in the similar genre and spirits like Leon (though it does make a cheeky reference to it).

Overall, though it leaves me not wanting to dismiss it as fluff or some ""feel good movie"", I can't help but feel that it is... so I'll call it very enjoyable ""borderline fluff"" comedy.",1092528000,2,943,4.993630573248407
1783869,5,B00006L93J,"I've seen good Korean movies, and I've seen VERY good Korean movies... this one is VERY good. The idea of the movie isn't too original, but it doesn't matter because the actors are great (i.e Shin Hyun-Joon) and there's plenty of great humor. This movie made me laugh harder than almost any ""comedy"" I've seen.
There's not much camera trickery, but the movie is still very stylish and looks good enough. Even tough the movie is about killing other people (well... that's not the POINT of the movie), I found this movie to be fun, heartwarming and smart. It's not like the Tarantino (or Tarantino-wannabe) movies, where every character is a very ANNOYING person and you can't relate to ANYONE on screen.
I recommend this movie to ANYONE, who enjoys action and humor in one shiny package.....",1057363200,6,790,4.773722627737226
1783870,2,B00006L93J,"I purchased the korean version of this film, under the impression it was a like a korean ""Tarantino"" or ""Guy Ritchie"" movie.  Needless to say, it was not.  While this ordinarily wouldn't be a problem, the film you do get simply doesn't hold up.  The ""stylish cinematography"" I was told to expect wasn't very, and the action sequences just didn't feel very solid.  It's got an amusing moment or two, and the three-way time lapse cut was pretty unique, but this doesn't save barely on par acting built on a mediocre script.  Go watch Lock Stock again.",1052956800,3,549,4.618556701030927
1783871,4,B00006L93J,"When I bought this movie on DVD (Korean version that is), I thought it was going to be some hard action movie. But it wasn't, however the movie was excellent.
A combination of Quentin Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie. The Dialogues where excellent and sometimes funny. And one of the coolest special effects I've seen ...... The movie also has some funny moments. But I don't think the subtitles are as funny as the spoken language. ....
I really enjoyed the movie, and for people that enjoy tarantino (without most of the violence) will enjoy this movie",1037145600,4,549,4.729166666666667

7971123,5,B00006L93J,Very funny movie.  It would have made a very entertaining  tv series.  BBC should pick up the storyline.  The actors are very good.  English subtitles  are great.

7971125,4,B00006L93J,"Guns and Talks really is a fantastic film. First off, let me explain the main reason that people have a negative reaction to this film. There are two reasons that people don't like movies. The first is that the film is really just not very good. The second is that the film wasn't what was expected or doesn't fall into the respective tastes of the viewer. Guns and Talks falls into this second category.

When I was looking to buy the film and reading official reviews around the net, many reviewers likened the film to Tarantino and Guy Richie. Unfortunately, the similarities are only in the concept. 4 assassins that are friends and live together struggle with the conflicts of their job and their personal lives and all the shenanigans that ensue. Sure, I could see QT of GR pitching it. But that is where the similarities end.

You don't get the trademark QT dialogue or the hyper-stylized, ultra cool GR universe. It's far more low key than that, and also a bit more straightforward. People have been disappointed because it didn't have ultra-slick camera work and larger-that-life characters like a Woo film. But this film isn't trying to do any of those things. Reviewers just like getting their reviews quoted, so by sticking some popular movie titles or director names in their review, it gives the review a better chance of being used. Ok, enough about that.

The movie is very good. It is funny. There are some memorably funny moments, despite reading the subtitles or listening to the dub. The humor does translate well. There is a lot of subtle humor that you have to be paying attention to catch, it's not just a bunch of sight gags. They do some interesting things with the voice over, as well as using multiple screen panels to show lapsing of time and potential actions. Very creative.

The story itself is interesting and we see the 4 main characters interact with each other and their jobs, all the while hiding pieces of their personal lives, some mixing business and pleasure, and how their friendships make them stronger. It's also nice to see how the different personalities affect how they perform their assassin duties. They all have their own style.

There are some great scenes. The Hamlet scene is truly magnificent. The music mixed with the imagery and the action is just an absolutely fantastic scene that will stick with you long after the movie is over. It's not so big as to overshadow the entire movie, but it is a standout. This is the movie that ""The Big Hit"" could have been if ""The Big Hit"" wasn't so bad.

The Koreans have really been on a tear making some great movies. From ""The Host"" to the Vengeance Trilogy (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Oldboy, Lady Vengeance) and this film, Korean cinema has really stepped up in the new millenium.

So if you're looking for an action/comedy that really is funny, has some cool action, is a great story, but never takes itself too seriously, this is one of the best.",1216684800,2,2946,4.675675675675675

There are 4 guys in this movie-but most of its about the two brothers (the narrator of the story is the younger brother while the elder brother is like the leader of the group) and the others in the group are kind of ignored-especially the sniper.  This movies as a whole doesn't take anything too seriously and you'll love the characters and the story.",1157068800,,591,4.444444444444445
