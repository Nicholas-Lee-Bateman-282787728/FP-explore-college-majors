4526795,5,B00525AK8U,"My baby girl looooooves yo gabba gabba. This dvd in particular is her favorite, i have no idea why but i'm not complaining. I bought all the YGG DVDs and she won't take her eyes off of it when it's on. She's such a sweet baby and she's learning a lot from this annoying yet educational dvd. So i really advise parents to own a couple YGG dvds because your child will learn a lot from the music and repetitiveness that this dvd  provides.",1322784000,2,437,4.2023809523809526

He really listens to the show.  It makes him dance, happy, etc.  I couldn't believe it.. I like it because it has all the things that I always talk to him about.  Like not biting friends, eating, be quiet and picking up.  He loves the music of picking up and cracks up.  It has been very hard to grab his attention.  But you guys did it.  Keep up the good work and bless your heart.  I have almost all your dvds.  I'm hoping you will make him talk some day.",1392422400,,606,3.9583333333333335

4526854,3,B00525AK8U,"My 14 month old isn't CRAZY about this show, but he seems to like it somewhat. He really loves Elmo, Barney and The Teletubbies, so I was hoping he would love this show since it has puppet characters and some music. However, this DVD definitely doesn't hold his attention like the other shows I mentioned. The show itself is a little strange and looks like it's out of the 70's. He does like the sections that have the puppets, the ""DJ"" character and the songs that they all sing. But when the show breaks into the small cartoon segments, he doesn't like it at all. Animated things don't really entertain him. Since I spent money on it and it gives us a little break from his other favorite shows, we'll continue to watch it every once in a while.",1381104000,,747,4.381294964028777
4526855,5,B00525AK8U,"We went to Target last weekend looking for a video for our 14 month-old-son, who has to sit still for 15 minutes several times a day for his breathing treatments (he has asthma).  I was looking for The Wiggles, on a recommendation from a friend, but this was all they had.  ""Ok, so we'll buy this DUMB video"" I muttered to my husband as we picked it up and walked away from the video isle.

We turned it on when we got home, and it seemed like the standard kid fare, creepy characters that look like failed Halloween costumes, stupid songs that got stuck in our heads all week long, cropping up when we were at work, prompting us to text each other lines from the show throughout the day so we could laugh and wallow in the misery.

A week later........

WOW.  That's all I can say.  I actually LIKE this show.  I mean, I really like it.  And my son?  Yeah, he's glued to it.  He has never ""asked"" us to watch TV before, which has been beyond fine with me, but now he actually points to the TV and asks, getting excited when we turn it on for him.  Today he is sick, and this video has played in a never-ending loop, keeping him entertained all day long while he feels yucky.  I never in a million years thought I'd approve of a show so wholeheartedly as I do this one.  The songs are fantastic, the colors are bright and the characters aren't too annoying.  There is just something about this show.  The music is just great.  I love the celebrity appearances, too.

The show even has story time, which includes stories such as ""Argyle the Octopus"" which is cute beyond words.

I highly recommend this!",1379203200,10,1602,4.297658862876254

(I ordered 3 Yo Gabba Gabba Videos at one time.) They came crammed in a box that was too small and the edge of the dvd cases on top and bottom were crushed. The cases are those new eco kind that are flimsy. But it doesn't matter really to me that isn't why I bought them, I bought them for the show on the dvd (which was fine) and the show is great! My son loves Yo Gabba Gabba and his eyes were glued to the screen and he was bouncing around as soon as it started playing. This is a great show because our son likes it and daddy and I get the songs stuck in our head but they are not as bad as other shows. This is one of the best toddler shows I think ever made and I even find a new episode interesting. Great music, musicians and art. A wide variety of popular and current bands and artist make guest appearances and the artist, Mark is the guy from the band Devo (Whip It!). Great show for the kids and you won't mind it either.",1341532800,,1077,3.9
