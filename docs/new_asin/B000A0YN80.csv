8324922,4,B000A0YN80,"None of Russ Meyer's movies having the word ""Vixen"" somewhere in the title are as good as his earlier black and white productions, which thankfully omit both the slapstick humor bits and the psycho-type over-the-top violence,a lamentable and ludicrous trend of those later movies.  Lorna is quite good, but Mudhoney remains his best movie overall: fine acting, a good script, distinctive characters, and the director's reliably excellent eye for visuals, camera angles, and a rapid cutting/editing style that is close to that of Orson Welles.  Notwithstanding those remarks, it nevertheless remains true that you can't go wrong with any Russ Meyer movie for its freshness, for the surprises, for the kinds of scenes you could never see in a traditional movie made ""by committee"", as it were.  And the trademark big boobs are there to always remind us of the fact that they are indeed indisputably powerful and wonderful female forces of Nature.",1458172800,2,944,5.1568627450980395

Nicknamed King of the Nudies, Russ Meyer is famous as a soft-porn director. However, his brilliant 1975 Supervixens features two outstanding scenes that appear headed for sex  and then Meyer frustrates the audiences expectations by NOT culminating them with eroticism.
A WWII veteran, Meyer sprinkles whimsical references to Germany and Nazism throughout Supervixens. The film opens with German marching music playing as a truck winds through a road in a desert. This truck is a tow truck for the Martin Bormann Super-Service (Super before names is another whimsy throughout this film) gas station and auto repair shop. This Martin Bormann (Henry Rowland) has little in common with the brutal Nazi but is an easy-going boss to handsome attendant Clint Ramsey (Charles Pitts).
Clint is the Significant Other of SuperAngel (Shari Eubanks). Her name is ironic as she is more devil than angel although she is, like all female characters in this film, attractive and voluptuous.
SuperAngel calls the Martin Bormann Super-Service and demands to speak to Clint. Martin tells Clint there is an ultimatum from the fuehrer that he must go home or SuperAngel will destroy their house.
Clint rushes home. He and SuperAngel live in a tacky house among a jumble of similar homes. Infuriated by her demands, Clint bitterly yells at SuperAngel. However, they are soon passionately kissing.
After lovemaking, she accuses Clint of infidelity.
Clint heads to his truck.
The insanely jealous SuperAngel grabs an axe. She uses it to demolish Clints truck. As she axes the vehicle, she screams, I wanted a Cadillac!
Cop Harry Sledge (Charles Napier) breaks up the domestic brawl. SuperAngel is immediately attracted to her muscular, macho rescuer.
When Clint drives home after the fight, his truck has been restored to its pre-axed shape.
SuperAngel orders him away. Although Clint does not know it, the audience soon learns that SuperAngel has company  Harry Sledge.
In frustration Clint picks up the axe and slams it into his truck. Unable to pull it out, he drives away with an axe stuck in the hood!
Perhaps the axe is prominent because it reminds us of we are often painfully cut off from each other  and from parts of ourselves.
The scenes between SuperAngel and Harry are horrifying and that horror has a special depth. Los Angeles Times reviewer Kevin Thomas astutely noted, We are able to see how both are tragically trapped by their sexual stereotypes: As a sexpot SuperAngel is expected to demand nothing less that perfection from her lovers; as a he-man the sheriff must be the ultimate in virility.
Suspected of SuperAngels murder, Clint flees into a series of misadventures until he and Harry meet in a truly bizarre ending that is endearingly comic and apocalyptically violent.
Supervixens should not be seen by children or by those offended by film violence, nudity, or simulated sex.
While it is not for everyone, Supervixens wittily combines drama, melodrama, humor, surrealism, and comedy to create a genuine cinematic treasure.",1401926400,,3057,5.1202404809619235
8324925,5,B000A0YN80,"This one has it all--lusty buxom women, action, humor, and even a plot (but not one that would interfere with the rest of the movie).  No one else did it like Russ Meyer.  Lots of fun, unless you're a prude or an extreme feminist.  It cost a lot, but it's worth it.",1380672000,,265,4.0576923076923075
8324926,4,B000A0YN80,"Sexploitation King Russ Meyer's first successful feature after his big Hollywood break out Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, mixes a universe that can come out of the trashy, clever mind of Myers himself.

Supervixens is a fast paced, surreal, sexy, part murder mystery/on the run camp/dark comedy that stars an all to gorgeous Shari Eubank as Super Angel, the ferocious and mean spirited vixen that drives her husband Clint Ramsey to the end of his wits. A crooked and evil sheriff Harry Sledge (played by films own producer Charles Napier) attempts an affair with Supervixen but her wicked taunted pushes him to the point of murder. Poor Ramsey is framed on the run from the law on a surreal journey of continuous journey of equal parts Vixen of all shapes and sizes and also equal part bad luck, from beatings, muggings and unwanted advances from voluptous goddessess starring a Myriad cast of Super Eula, Super Lorna, Super Cherry, Super Soul and Super Haji (Faster Pussy Cat Kill, Kill)

Clint Ramsey's luck turns around when he meets a woman quite like Super Angel in appearance (also played by Shari Eubank)but only all she is all too sweet as a gas station/restuarant owner. Ramsey finally finds love until the evil Harry Sledge enters their life again to bring a climax of cartoonish dynamite throwning violence that could only be taken slightly serious in the entertaining Universe of Russ Meyer. 8/10",1362787200,,1409,4.891213389121339
