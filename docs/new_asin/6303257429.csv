613429,5,6303257429,"I saw it on the Space channel last night and loved it, it is so good, way ahead of it's time.  Horror at its best.",923529600,,114,3.56
613430,5,6303257429,"I will include some further reflections below my original review of 3/9/99, below:

Based on -- and admirably expanding on - M.R. James' story ""Casting the Runes"", this remains one of the finest supernatural movies ever made.  The screenwriter, Charles Bennett, was a Hitchcock veteran and it shows in the tautly  structured plot.  Niall MacGinnis is superb as the urbane villain, and the  film has any number of classic sequences: the seance scene, the scene at  the Hobart farm, the Children's Halloween party and whirlwind scene, the  scene in the woods -- even the controversial special effects of the fire  demon actually work (although it's debatable whether the film would be  better without) -- the only special effect that doesn't come off is the  scene where Dana Andrews is fighting purportedly with a large wild cat --  obviously fake.  But that is a tiny flaw in what is a classic of the genre.  Eerie, atmospheric, and highly recommended.  Another bit of trivia:  this  is the film referred to in the opening song of The Rocky Horror Picture  Show (""Dana Andrews said prunes / gave him the runes/ and passing them  used lots of skills"") and also in the scene where Janet collides with  atree branch in the ""There's a Light"" number.

Further reflections:
If anything I damned the film with faint praise, as I neglected to mention so many other interesting elements. Such as the specific Hitchcockian elements-- the suave villain, the villain's daffy but kindhearted mother (one is reminded of the mother in STRANGERS ON A TRAIN), the scene where the hero is in a den of the ""bad guys"" (the ominous scene where Holden visits the Hobart farm and confronts Rand Hobart's mother) are some that immediately come to mind. There are some interestingly erudite elements in the script: Holden works with two of the late Dr. Harrington's colleagues, Professor O'Brien and Dr. Kumar-- from the two furthest fringes of the Indo-European world, the Celts at extreme west and the peoples of Northern India on the extreme east-- and each of them is more attuned to the possibilties of the supernatural than Holden himself from the purportedly more sophisticated center of Indo-European culture-- more sophisticated perhaps, but also stubbornly closed-minded. It is interesting, too, that the eerie music which is running unbidden through Holden's head (after he unwittingly accepts the runic parchment) is mirrored in folk tunes from Ireland and India, both about the supernatural.  (And that the tunes could objectively exist is a proof of sorts that what is going through Holden's head is more than a coincidence.) The wonderful seance scene, where Holden is almost offensively skeptical, is mirrored later by a sort of ""scientific seance"", where Rand Hobart's spirit, it could be argued, is roused from catatonia by hypnotism, sodium pentothal (the ""truth serum"") and methylamphetamine (stimulants).

Karswell, brilliantly played by MacGinnis, admits to his mother that his motivation, and the motivation of his followers, is fear. Well, in metaphysical circles it is also said that fear, fundamentally, motivates those who follow the ""lefthand path"" of black magic.  This fear is shown in a number of clever ways: in the ""prelude"" scene where Professor Harrington begs Karswell to ""stop it"", Karswell asks in an affectedly casual manner whether Harrington still has the parchment. On hearing that it was burned-- and seeing by the clock it is uncomfortably close to 10pm, when the demon is due to kill the last holder of the parchment (as well as anyone else nearby, evidently), Karswell still tries to seem nonchalant, but rather too quickly urges that Harrington had ""better go home""... a first time viewer may not catch this, but MacGinnis wonderfully conveys Karswell's dread and desire that Harrington be as far away as possible when ten o'clock rolls around.

The film is full of wonderful things like this. Even little touches: when at the Hobart farm Holden opens his wallet to abstract a form, the Runic Parchment seems to almost jump out on its own, and the people at the farm all gasp and rear back-- Mrs Hobart saying, ""He has been chosen!""  When Holden asks, ""Chosen for what?"", all she says is, ""Let no hand be raised to defend him!"" And leaving, as the door slams on him, he sees Kabbalistic symbols drawn on it, reminding one the the blood smeared on the doors in the Bible Story of the Death of the First Born in Egypt-- to deflect the angel of death! Holden then visits nearby Stonehenge- where he sees that the runes on the Parchment he has are indistinguishable from the ancient ones on that monument.  And as the scene shifts back to London to the wry arpeggio of an oboe, we see a cat stealthily moving along a windowsill on a facing building-- the cat pursuing prey, no doubt, precisely as the demon is pursuing Holden. This is just a small sample of the attention to detail, large and small, that makes this picture so fine.

Note should also be made of the wonderful cinematography-- brooding and atmospheric and beautifully black and white--- and the score, which-- if at times is a tad overwrought-- at best is splendid. Indeed, the ""demon motif"" composed for the film is creepy and memorable, and is woven through the beautifully instrumented score very skillfully-- such as the moment right after receiving the parchment, in the British Museum, where his vision becomes blurred-- and again not long after in the corridor of his hotel. Also, the sound that accompanies the appearance of the demon is a wonderful cue that ""something wicked this way comes""-- like some flesh-crawling prickling stridulation.

It should also be noted that the screenplay, which is loosely based on MR James' story ""Casting the Runes"", is actually very much better than James' story itself.  The cast is almost uniformly excellent, though Ms Cummins is a tad stiff at times. A minor flaw, though, like the not very convincing encounter between Holden and the watch-cat at Lufford Hall-- minor flaws in what is a great film irrespective of genre, and of the genre itself, one of the greatest!

PS as Columbia Tristar have put the truncated US version and the 13-minute-longer original British version on the same disc, opt for the latter, under its original title NIGHT OF THE DEMON-- among the 13 minutes cut for the American version is the visit to the Hobart farm, not only a great scene, but a pivotal one.

James, this is an unusually literate horror film.  The demon effects  (added later) detract only slightly from the film's effectiveness.

Night Of The Demon is classic 50s horror, one of my favorite pop-corn and late night flicks. Jacques Tourneur was an excellent director, got a decent script, and excellent performances from the cast, even Dana Andrews (although he was really miscast, being too old for the part he plays). If Tourneur had been given free rein, the movie would have been even better. Despite the interference of the producers, he still made a good movie. So before the American release, the producers chopped up his work, deleting so many scenes that the plot is virtually indecipherable, and retitled the result.

I think the secret of the film's success is the ""flat"" performance of Dana Andrews as an annoyingly supercilious American scientist. He forms a perfect combination with the edgy emotionalism of other characters, especially Niall MacGinnis as the diabolical bad guy. Suspension of disbelief is critical to horror stories. For me, that happened by identifying with Andrews' character as his initial skepticism gave way to curiosity and finally terror.",1496966400,6,619,4.961538461538462

613714,3,6303257429,"""Casting the Runes"" is one of M.R. James' most collected ghost stories along with ""Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad.""  It is a tale of a man who unwittingly angers a sorcerer, assumed by some M.R. James scholars to be based on the self-styled 'Great Beast,' occultist Aleister Crowley.

An older, more down-at-the-heels Dana Andrews replays one of his most famous roles as the detective in ""Laura"" in this B-film version of ""Casting the Runes.""  Instead of the cynical detective, in ""Night of the Demon"" (1957) we have a cynical psychologist who denigrates believers in the supernatural until he himself is handed the runes by a cheerfully devilish Niall MacGinnis.

Interestingly, according to Wikipedia, ""The film's production was turbulent due to artistic differences between producer Hal E. Chester on one side and Tourneur and writer Charles Bennett on the other. Although the original plan was not to show a literal demon, producer Chester inserted a monster over the objections of the writer, the director, and lead actor Dana Andrews.""  I also think it was a mistake to show the demon, especially in the first few minutes of the movie.  My first thought was how badly that monster needed a trip to the dentist.

One of my favorite characters, not in the original short story by M.R. James was the sorcerer's doddery old mother, played by Athene Seyler, who specialized in this type of role in many British films from the 1930s to the 1960s.  She is especially funny in the sance scene (also not in the original story).

Other than the demon, this is a stylishly noir film with genuinely spooky moments.",1478908800,4,1619,4.858181818181818

NIght of the Demon is one of the best British horror movies right up there with Wicker Man as they both have unique British elements to them which are central to their stories. At the time a lot of American faded stars would appear in British films as to appeal to the American Market which was fair enough.

613899,4,6303257429,"I first saw ""Curse of the Demon"" when I was a kid, back in the days when local TV stations used to run 11:30 p.m. programs (after the news) entitled ""The Late Show"" and, in this case, ""Chiller Theater.""  Well, this was one movie I never forgot; it scared the hell out of me.  I never forgot the runic symbols, the slip of paper, the first killing by the demon (this occurs early, and you know it's coming before it happens thanks to the rules of the genre we all learned subconsciously), etc.

I had long wondered how it would be to re-see this movie again.  Often, when one re-watches an old movie that made a big impression years ago, there is a big disappointment--""not like I remembered it.""  Not so, in this case.  Even now, as I watched it (I chose the longer British version, and that is definitely the way to watch this film), I still found it riveting.  The script is tight, and the plot moves at a brisk pace (for a 1957 movie).

But, the real star of this movie is the director's noir-ish visual style, which harkens back to his earlier peak period when he made movies for Val Lewton.  Tourneur really knows how to light scenes, where to place his camera, and generally excels in his use of visual resources.  Pictorially, this is a fascinating film, and it's the visual style that really gets under the viewer's skin.

A few drawbacks: the demon looks rather cheesy, especially in the shots when he fills the screen; if the producer had listened to Tourneur, the demon shots would not have been in the movie.  Also, Dana Andrews seems a bit stiff at times, and his character's stubborn refusal to wake up to the power of evil in front of his eyes becomes rather irritating (which causes some audience identification problems with his character being so bull-headed)

However, this remains a good example of a supernatural horror movie.  For those of you who have vague memories of this movie from way back, or for those who are curious about this film but never saw it, the answer is an unequivocal YES--don't hesitate.",1449446400,3,2031,4.528767123287671

613957,5,6303257429,"I love horror movies. I'm particularly interested with the older horror movies which required substantial work on the part of the director to create atmosphere as special effects were much more difficult to create without substantial amounts of funding. Jacques Tourneur was a master at creating great horror movies with very limited budgets, as well as being responsible for the film noir classic ""Out Of The Past"". He directed ""Cat People"" and ""I Walked with a Zombie"". The ""monster"" in Curse of the Demon is kind of hokey which was added by the studio after the fact with objections from the director. Jacques Tourneur had never wanted a depiction of a monster to keep the film within the original scope of the idea, but the movie really works well anyway. Dana Andrews over acts to some degree which brings a real charm to the movie for me personally sort of like William Shatner. The character I find most interesting is ""Doctor Julian Karswell"" played by Niall MacGinnis. He was a European character actor of great note during his career. He just helps create an aura of menace. He is an Aleister Crowley type of character in this film and really plays the character to great effect. Anyway, a great horror movie with lots of tension unless you are into more modern ""gore porn"". If you love old horror movies this one is a ""must see"" in my opinion.",1443916800,,1354,4.69327731092437

614157,5,6303257429,"Night of the Demon, 1957, by the great noir director, Jacques Tourneur, is a genuinely frightening horror movie, starring Dana Andrews(Laura),and a host of British actors: Peggy Cummins, Niall MacGinnis, Reginald Beckwith, Athene Sayler and Maurice Denham. Dana Andrews as the stubborn rationalist,American psychologist,John Holden, who has come to England to find his associate Henry Harrington has died, following a curse from occultist Julian Karswell(MacGinnis). Based on M.R. James story, Casting the Runes, rewritten as Night of the Demon. There's a strong hint of black magic in the build up in suspense and eerie nature of some of the scenes, pace, energy, plotting of the story, and characterisation of the actors. Dr Holden's brash scepticism is made to look ridiculous. Some scenes stand out: the summoning of the storm, the experiences of Holden in Karswell's library and the woods, and the rousing of one of Karswell's victims from a hypnotic trance. The cross-over scene with the runic parchment on the last train journey between Holden and Karswell, is especially good. MacGinnis brings to this fearsome tale a show-stopping performance. The cinematography is excellent, so that it's easy to see a demon in every dark corner or shadow. The Clifton Parker score is first rate, heightening the fear, with sound effects by Charles Crafford. There's superb use of location shooting at the British Museum, Stonehenge and Brocket Hall in Hertfordshire, with a clever use of a stretch of the London Midland Region railway-line.",1418688000,,1535,5.347107438016529

The first is his use of shadow and light in black and white films. He seems to achieve a depth and richness that transcends the limited medium. Next, is his ability to cause a distinct atmosphere of building, even haunting dread and doom. CURSE OF THE DEMON (82 min.) -as well as the British, uncut / full-length version, NIGHT OF THE DEMON (95 min.)- is certainly a perfect example of both of these artistic means. As a movie about demonology / witchcraft, COTD is frightening enough. When the director is able to bring out such darkness and impending death through his techniques, the result is masterful! Skeptical psychologist, Dr. John Holden (Dana Andrews) faces off against devil-cult leader, Doctor Karswell (Niall Macginnis) in a classic ""science vs. the supernatural"" tale.

614259,4,6303257429,"Do you believe in demons? Do you believe that there is a supernatural world overlaid with ours, filled with horrors and wonders that the human mind can scarcely grasp?  Well, Dr. Holden doesn't... until he's cursed by a vengeful sorcerer, and has only a few days before a demon messily kills him.

So goes ""Curse of the Demon"" or ""Night of the Demon,"" depending on which country's edit you're watching -- the British one is a bit longer. It's a hauntingly suspenseful movie loosely based on an M.R. James short story, with the trappings of demonology and witchcraft draped over a solid suspense story. If only you didn't actually SEE the titular demon, it would be one of the best horror movies of the 50s.

Dr. John Holden (Dana Andrews) arrives in England for a conference on superstition, only to find that his colleague Professor Harrington (Maurice Denham) has just died in a bizarre ""accident."" Harrington was planning to expose Dr. Julian Karswell (Niall MacGinnis) as the leader of a cult, and his niece Joanna (Peggy Cummins) believes that Karswell did something supernatural to kill her uncle.

As a professional skeptic, Holden doesn't buy any of this. But when visiting Karswell's estate, he ends up irritating the self-proclaimed witch... and Karswell declares that Holden will die in three days' time.

Holden refuses to believe that he's actually been hexed, but he's haunted by feelings of cold, strange mists, and a mysterious parchment with runic symbols on it. And as the time ticks down to his predicted death, he begins to suspect that Karswell may have actually summoned a demon -- and his only chance of surviving the hex lies with a catatonic murder suspect.

""Curse/Night of the Demon"" is a prime example of just doing everything in a movie well. It sounds like a pretty cheesy premise, but director Jacques Tourneur inserts a real feeling of foreboding in almost every scene. Everything is slowly building to a climax, and you're on the edge of your seat, wondering if Holden will open his eyes and realize what's going on before it's too late.

There are some dry patches, such as when Holden discusses demonology and superstition with his peers, although these lend the movie an air of authenticity. But the movie is most effective when Andrews and Cummins are darting through a nightmarish maze of secrets -- consider the comedic yet eerie seance scene, or the haunting moment when the catatonic man is hypnotized.

Andrews is a bit stiff, and not entirely plausible as a scientist. But he's able to hold his own as a grim, steadfast cynic who gradually comes to believe that maybe, sorta, kinda, there are supernatural forces out there. He has amazing chemistry with MacGinnis, who has a fey, jovially evil attitude. And Cummins makes a good counterpoint to Holden as a smart, sensible woman who doesn't discount the possibility.

However.... we should have either never seen the demon (which looks pretty goofy) or only seen it at the very end. This would have left it ambiguous whether the supernatural threat real or whether Holden is being gaslighted by a murderous Karswell. Reportedly the idiot producer demanded that the demon be seen, despite the best efforts of Tourneur, writer Charles Bennett (who said he wanted to shoot the producer), and Andrews. It's a shame, because ambiguity would have made it truly brilliant.

""Curse of the Demon / Night of the Demon"" (watch the longer British edit) is an underrated, moody little horror gem, which could use an ultimate cut to smooth over its occasional flaws.",1400198400,2,3545,4.913043478260869

614317,5,6303257429,"Psychiatrist Dr. John Holden travels to England for an international scientific conference, where a colleague, Henry Harrington, plans to deliver an expos on devil cult leader Julian Karswell. Upon arrival, Holden learns that Harrington was killed the night before in a freak auto accident. Holden, who debunks paranormal phenomena, decides to delve deeper into Harrington's research, hoping to expose Karswell's phony supernatural power--which he believes is simply the result of autosuggestion and mass hysteria, and is being used as a ruse to stop people from looking into the man's affairs. After the investigation leads to a rare book on the occult, ""The True Discoveries of Witches and Demons,"" Holden is warned that if he doesn't stop digging, he'll die on October 28th at 10PM. It's then that he discovers a piece of parchment that has somehow ended up in his possession--on which is written a series of indecipherable runic symbols.

Based on M.R. James' short story ""Casting the Runes,"" this excellent British film was released in North America (with a shorter running time) as ""Curse of the Demon."" The smart, suspenseful story has a film noir feel, which benefits from the stark, moody cinematography by Edward Scaife, and the deft use of music and sound effects. For the most part, director Jacques Tourneur (""Cat People,"" ""I Walked with a Zombie"") leaves the terrors off-screen, but the infamous demon itself--which is used extensively in the marketing material--appears early on in the film. Many feel that this takes away from the story, and there's some dispute as to whether or not Tourneur shot these scenes, or they were added after the fact by the producer. The screenwriter, Charles Bennett (""The Man Who Knew Too Much,"" ""The 39 Steps""), was also against this addition, and other changes that were made to his original script. Regardless, the story still delivers quite a few chills to this day, with some humorous moments that alleviate the dread over Holden's pending doom--despite his firm belief that nothing supernatural is going on.

Although Dana Andrews (as John Holden) is given top billing, it's really Niall MacGinnis who's the standout here. His portrayal of Julian Karswell is at times charismatic, sinister, and even sympathetic. He is often shown with a deck of cards in his hand, as if dealing the fates of those around him. Whereas Holden is a disbeliever to a fault, Karswell discusses his use of white and black magic as if it were nothing out of the ordinary. This ongoing debate over science versus superstition, and the real versus the imagined, really adds to the story.

Thanks to the demon scenes, and how it was marketed, this film has historically been treated as a B-movie--but it really rises above such trappings, and is one of the top horror/suspense films of that era (and certainly worthwhile viewing by those, like me, who are jaded by what modern filmmakers consider to be ""horror""). There are also some great scenes of Stonehenge; this was shot back when the area was undeveloped, and the prehistoric monument still seemed like part of the natural environment. (There's one scene that shows ancient runes carved into the face of one of the stones, but these do not actually exist.)

An interesting bit of trivia: this movie had an impact on writer/actor Richard O'Brien, who referenced it in his opening song, ""Science Fiction/Double Feature,"" from ""The Rocky Horror (Picture) Show"":

""Dana Andrews said prunes gave him the runes, and passing them used lots of skills.""

Those who have seen ""Night of the Demon"" will get the reference, so if you haven't yet had the opportunity, do so! If you have the option, definitely watch the original British release over the American edit.

614368,5,6303257429,"Any suggestion of watching this eerily effective little gem might well be dismissed by those brought up on CGI; after all it's in black and white, made in the fifties and featuring no-one likely to ring the bells of recognition in the heads of many of today's viewing public. However, those `in the know' will readily recommend it for its literate script, some highly effective acting, from such stalwarts as Liam Redmond (Professor Mark O'Brian) and Athene Seyler (Mrs Karswell), brilliant direction (by Jacques Tourneur) and editing and some very novel camera work.

Niall MacGinnis usually receives all the acting plaudits, though, and he does provide a good turn as the evil but strangely affable Julian Karswell, a wizard whom Dana Andrews's character, American Psychologist, John Holden, has crossed the Atlantic to `debunk'. He plays Karswell as a kind of naughty boy creating mischief when he doesn't get his own way! Athene Taylor, as his mother, spends a lot of her time `tut tutting' over her boy's mischief making suspecting no doubt that it'll all end in tears!

Basically, Karswell is a kind of high priest to a devil worshipping cult whose activities are being investigated by Professor Henry Harrington (Maurice Denham) who elicits the help of Holden. Karswell takes exception to this meddling in his affairs and unleashes the eponymous demon to deal with his enemies. The `love interest' is played by Peggy Cummins as Joanna, Harrington's feisty niece.

The whole thing is a bit quaint, quirky and, not surprisingly, other-worldly, and this is not only due to the subject matter: it evokes the kind of Britain still suffering from the effects of rationing and the Second World War. One example of its quirkiness is a very entertaining s&eacute;ance sequence featuring a regular of British post-war cinema, Reginald Beckwith, as the medium. Having said that, it still sends shivers down the spine at some points due to an unnervingly creepy undercurrent just beneath the seemingly prosaic surface of the narrative.

The story is a modern adaptation of M. R. James's story `The Casting of the Runes' and was released in America as `The Curse of the Demon with a shorter running time. As such it is not really a double bill since the films are essentially the same!",1383609600,,2279,5.005277044854881

With approximately 15-minutes whacked in the U.S. version, ""Curse of the Demon"", there is a very noticeable difference because important details that make the movie more understanding are left on the cutting room floor in order to shorten the total content to 82-minutes without any explanation for the editing! Since both versions are released as a ""Double Feature"" ... on one DVD disc ... I highly suggest you program the ""Night of the Demon"" first, in order to absorb the original, complete story. Either way, it's a very good motion picture consisting of outstanding performances by the entire cast.

Hmmmm. How to describe it? Engaging, different, pretty creepy, and very well-done. Filmed in England by a British studio, released by Columbia Pictures, it's kind of a ""Hitchcock-style movie"" meets ""Thriller"" TV show blend. The casting is impeccable, and never goes too over the top. Dana Andrews is an often under-appreciated actor, and perfect here as a convincing ""everyman"" whose skepticism about the strange goings on gets progressively more challenged. In the same way that the great Michael Rennie was ideal as Klaatu in ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" (not a well-known actor, hence all the more believable as a visitor from another planet), the British cast is superb and they lend authenticity to the production. The 95 minutes fly by. I think you'll really enjoy it. The sound  and picture are excellent.

Because blood and guts and slime and chopping people up into little pieces or some idiot running around in a people suit or some deranged character in a mask may startle me, but it doesn't horrify me.  I do not leave the theater looking over my shoulder or afraid of dark places.

I thought Halloween had a really good bit when Jason, supposedly dead, sits up behind Jamie Lee Curtis, but a single scene does not a movie make.

I saw this movie when it first came out in 1956.  It was on a double bill with The Curse of Frankenstein, the movie I originally wanted to see.  I did not stay for Frank, my grandmother and I left after The Curse was over.  It scared me then and it still has the power to give me cold chill bumps.

There is no blood, there are not body parts flung about, there is no idiot in a mask or one with pins sticking out of his face or any other part of his body, there is only true terror and atmosphere and a something that might or might not be there.  There are no gross out scenes, there is only pure terror, because you can never be safe.  You cannot hide, a gun does nothing, you cannot run, you cannot be saved, you can only outwit the Black magic or die.

The demon is one bad looking monster.  It does nothing more than kill and terrorize, it does not have philosophical discussions as does Crowley in Supernatural.  I really believe that it is a demon.

It is the perfect horror movie.  It builds tension, it is in black and white and that is so evocative of the situation.  The ""walk through the woods"" scared me the first time and the last time I saw it, which was two weeks ago.

The ""bad guy"" is almost sympathetic, and his mother is a darling, the ""hero"" is a little ""slow"" to get it, but when he does you wonder how he will ""win"" how he will keep the demon off his back, literally.  And the ending is not a ""Oh, come on"" it is a good ending, it never fails to be a satisfying end to a really scary moment.

This is the movie I judge all horror movies against.  And except for COTD I have yet to see one that always scares me.  And I never watch it in the dark.",1382400000,17,2146,4.071599045346062

This movie's assets include fine acting and intelligently written dialogue amid the machinations of a truly misanthropic and psychopathic antagonist. With all of these ingredients simmering in the same cauldron, the result is having a film that is truly enjoyable. One that is far more nuanced than expected.

There has been much discussion among the reviewers about the portrayal of the demon. Of course, it is simply a matter of opinion whether this entity should be shown realistically - or instead to allow the viewer to conjure the demon's appearance in one's own imagination.

The demon actually appears on screen three times. During the first and third times, this monster is shown in detail and is primed to kill. But it is portrayed abstractly during its second appearance when it has been conjured by the occultist - this time encountering Dana Andrews' character in the woods.

Thus, the viewer can simply compare one's reactions to these three episodes. Which one(s) inspires greater fear? Is the demon more frightening when shown realistically or not?

I, myself, found the second episode far more titillating, since during this time Andrews' character is fleeing from the unidentifiable unknown. And the unknown can comprise the most horrible thing imaginable. Others have already disagreed, but this particular discussion reflects the effectiveness of the film and the fervid interest of its fans.",1379980800,2,1603,5.349206349206349

This movie is a comfort to those of us who are tired of modern horror films which try endlessly to outdo each other with gore, butchery, and sadism, not to mention computer-generated action sequences.

It's a straightforward account of witchcraft, desperation, and disbelief.  Dana Andrews is perfectly cast as the stalwart skeptic out to debunk Doctor Karswell (Niall MacGinnis), the leader of a so-called cult.  The `cult' is never shown, but a reference is made allowing that it's his followers who financially support the bad doctor in a lifestyle he's come to enjoy and isn't about to give up no matter what.  People who threaten to expose him have a habit of turning up dead......in the nastiest way possible.

It seems there was a bit of trouble with this film during production.  The producer Hal E. Chester wanted a full-fledged monster shown during the course of the film, writer Charles Bennett, director Jacques Tourneur, and actor Dana Andrews did not.  Guess who won.  And in this case, I'm glad the producer prevailed and the `demon' gets his due.  The dissenters wanted it left up to the audience whether the doctor was indeed capable of real magic or was it fear-induced deaths from over active minds.  I think it helps that the audience is fully aware of what the doctor is up to, even if the the skeptic (Dana Andrews) is not clued in until the last possible moment.

I love every aspect of this film including the monster.  My only objection is with the horrific artwork (or lack thereof) on the cover of the DVD.  It looks slapdash and gives a poor accounting of how elegant the film is.

A better 50's horror movie does not exist! ""Night of the Demon,"" British title. ""Curse of the Demon,"" American title, is one of the greatest horror films ever put to celluloid. The story of an American psychiatrist, Dr. John Holden (Dana Andrews) who travels to England to debunk wizard, Dr. Julian Karswell (Niall MacGinnis) of his status as a true disciple of magic & Satan. The only problem is that Dr. Julian Karswell may very well be the real deal, & he resents any outside interference with him & the cult who surrounds him out of fear.

""Night of the Demon"" has all the creeping goose fleshed atmosphere to spew at it's viewers in massive slices of dread! A better crafted film of the supernatural, nary exists. The duel of wills between Dr. John Holden & Dr. Julian Karswell make for a test of endurance, Dr. John Holden's endurance that is, as one unexplained event happens after another. The clever cinematography, special effects, musical score, & intelligent script make for a supreme game of eerie chess, that will have you enthralled, engulfed, & emerged in it's enticing grip. This is even helped further along by the magnificent acting done by Niall MacGinnis, as the seemingly benevolent, level headed country gentlemen who owns a very large parcel of land, ruling over it in a magnificent mansion. It is his great acting that really makes this film come to life, though Dana Andrews as Dr. John Holden, plays his role as a stubborn non-believer & debunker of the supernatural like a snapping turtle clamped on your finger that carelessly bumped it's mouth. The two are this film, as conflict builds into battle, as battle builds into war, a war of reason against the unreasonable. A war of reality verses the surreal, with a take no prisoners attitude.

Helming this marvelous masterpiece of malevolency, is a director who has been noted for his apt handling of horror films, Jaques Tourneur (""I Walked with a Zombie & ""The Cat People), he steers this macabre opus right into your deepest fears, the fear of not knowing what is real & what is not. The fear of seeing something in the corner of your minds eye that could be the difference between sanity & insanity. Tourneur pulls all the right switches & strings to make ""Night of the Demon"" one of the pinnacles of it's Satanic sub-genre & the horror genre as a whole, influencing countless horror films & horror directors afterwards.

If there is a glitch to this film, people feel it is the presences of the ""Demon"" it's self. It was said that the movie studio insisted on a monster being in the film, while Tourneur insisted that the unseen is much more disturbing than a full fledged monster in your face. The studio won out. I myself feel the ""Demon"" is a asset to this movie, though the effects are dated, they were handled tremendously, the ""Demon"" looking frightfully great to me as a child in the 60's watching this film. Even today, I think it was the right choice. You only see it in two frightfully eerie scenes. The beginning of the movie & the end. It perfectly compliments what this film is trying to purvey, fear! If they had used it more, no doubt, it would have hampered the eerie effect of the film as a whole, but it's used so commandingly sparingly, like pushing a doomsday button, that's it's impact can't be understated!

As I said earlier, there is two versions of this film, the British, ""Night of the Demon, & the American, ""Curse of the Demon."" The British is the superior film, & runs 13 minutes longer. This is the definitive version, trust me.

""Night of the Demon"" is a great movie anytime of year, that is night time of year, with the lights off, & your imagination on!",1350950400,,3693,4.63914373088685

614574,4,6303257429,"There are already over a hundred reviews of this release, so let me toss just a few words into the haystack. There's of course been enough discussion concerning the actual appearance of the demon in the film -- the objections to it by director Tourneur and screenwriter Bennett, and the insistence of producer Hal Chester that it explicitly be in the film, both at the beginning and the end. I have a mixed view. Given the conception of the creature, I can see an argument for its inclusion. The execution, however, leaves quite a lot to be desired. In addition, I don't have much objection to much of the cutting that produced the American release -- that initial scene on the transatlantic flight just goes on far too long and isn't funny, if that was the intent. In any case, I'm one of those who truly loves the mood that this film establishes. Niall MacGinnis steals the show as cult leader Karswell, and the Tourneur's style, documentary in nature at times, only reinforces the claustrophobic sense of lurking evil. I do think in some ways the film could be better: Fleshing out Karswell's coven would have helped, and one or two more instances of supernatural intervention, such as the impromptu thunderstorm, would have enhanced the sense of helplessness and foreboding. Still, for a film that in its opening appears set for a shoddy, shameful ride down Low-Budget Boulevard, there's a wealth of nuance and detail, thanks to Tourneur and Bennett, who later remarked that he would willingly shoot Chester.

614600,3,6303257429,"Night of the Demon is the British version; Curse of the Demon is the American release. The only differences I could see were a couple of places where very trivial plot elements were shortened slightly, and one scene was cut out. The scene was Dr. Holden going to get permission from the family to question a man who was charged with murder in a cult-like crime, and had since become entirely catatonic.

Handsome Dr. Holden (Dana Andrews) is an American psychiatrist on his way to London to a conference on parapsychology. A charming young woman on the plane (Peggie Cummings) annoys him while he's trying to sleep because she has her reading light on so she can write letters. Later he learns that she is Joanna Harrington, the niece of the colleague he was there to meet, with whom he had collaborated on an investigation of the evil Carswell, leader of a satanic coven.

Holden is the complete skeptic, and is searching for rational answers to the mysteries that have plagued Dr. Harrington. But Harrington is dead when he and Joanna arrive; they recognize each other when they meet again at his wake. Harrington was electrocuted when he backed into a utility poll that brought down live wires, but Joanna says the police told her that his body was horribly mutilated, as if by an animal. ""The only thing is, they can't tell me what sort of animal."" The audience knows, because they saw it happen: it is a burning demon of the rather classic sort.

The tension in the story is between Holden's skepticism and the audience's knowledge, as well as between the believers in demons who are most of the other characters. Karswell predicts the date and time (the 28th at 10:00 p.m.) of Holden's death, and predicts he will suffer doubts and fears that increase over that period of time. Of course, Holden has a naturalistic explanation: like a voodoo priest, Holden is trying to literally scare him to death. Actually, if he weren't such a courageous and rational American Man, it might have worked. It comes close anyway.

614645,5,6303257429,"Jacques Tourneur, director of both CAT PEOPLE and I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, delivers this top-rate psychological thriller from 1957 that is just as shocking and powerful today as it was at the time of its release. NIGHT OF THE DEMON follows Dr. Holden as he arrives in London for a seminar in which he hopes to disprove the existence of witchcraft in modern society. It is here that he quickly incurs the wrath of a local warlock, who places a demonic curse over his head just as he had done to Dr. Holden's friend just a week earlier. Holden refuses to give in to the same superstition and fear that seized his friend's heart in an icy death grip, but as the date of his supposed death draws nearer, he grows increasingly alarmed by the odd occurrences that are unfolding all around him.

It has long been debated whether or not Tourneur originally intended to reveal demon to the audience rather than subtly alluding to its presence, which may have been a decision that was influenced by the film's producers under the same circumstances that occurred in CAT PEOPLE. In spite of this possibility, the towering beast that steps out of the smoke in NIGHT OF THE DEMON has become one of the most frightening and memorable creations in classic Horror. Its earth-shattering appearances at the beginning and end of the film are fearsome spectacles of special effects and costuming.

While NIGHT OF THE DEMON does function as a chilling creature-feature, Tourneur succeeds on a much larger scale in creating a brilliantly-crafted mystery that builds itself around the themes of auto-suggestion and mass hysteria. By placing the medieval ingredients of black magic and demonology into a modern, real-world setting, he is able to contrast superstition and science, leaving it up to the viewer to decide whether the unfortunate victims have given in to hypnotic suggestion and fear, or whether the gates of hell have literally opened to unleash one of their fiery spawn. Had the physical embodiment of the beast been removed entirely from the picture, it may have proven to be even more effective in this regard.

The exceptionally spooky atmosphere and spine-tingling mood that can be found all throughout CAT PEOPLE and I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE are ever-present in NIGHT OF THE DEMON. Tourneur's dark forests are drowned in ethereal lighting and a creeping mist that recall the Gothic settings of the Universal classics. An increasing sense of dread permeates from each of the characters as simple coincidence begins to give way to fate. Dana Andrews and Niall MacGinnis are superb opposite one another, one being the skeptic and the other being the true believer. Their final confrontation aboard the train offers a clever exchange between the characters that is rife with humor and suspense.

Jacques Tourneur proves, once again, that he is a master in his field, and NIGHT OF THE DEMON is one of the greatest accomplishments in the genre.

614646,5,6303257429,"Night of the Demon is an excellent horror film that still works more than 50 years after it had its first run. It's filmed in noir style and adapted from the M.R. James story ""Casting the Runes.""

The hero of the story, Dana Andrews, is a stubborn American psychiatrist determined to help debunk a genteel and charming occultist (Niall MacGinnis) at the behest of an English colleague.  Unfortunately, before Andrews' arrival, the colleague has been killed and when Andrews meets the occultist and shows his utter disdain for the man, Andrews becomes the next target for demonic retribution.

Most of the film works incredibly well, masterfully weaving the elements of the occult into the ordinary and mundane elements of everyday life.  Yet hidden in the shadows, only after a few subtle glimpses, we see that horror can strike anywhere, anytime.

The actress who plays the murdered colleague's niece is charming, spunky and sinks her teeth into the part.  If there is a weakness, it's Andrews.  A lot of the time, he comes off as a bit of a stiff and an arrogant know-it-all.  It's only at the end he finally gets it and puts the smack-down on the occultist with a clever bit of subterfuge at the end of the film.  However, the tour-de-force of the film is Mr. MacGinnis.  He paints an intriguing portrait of a charming man, the apple of his mother's eye and friend to all the village's children, who is completely evil, though he does not delight in commiting evil. He simply sees its use as a means to an end to protect his power base and his income stream.  One could say he uses a similar thought process as the CEO of an oil company that knowingly cuts corners and, as a result, fouls a country's major waterway and says, ""I'd like my life back,"" uncaring about the misery and suffering his own avarice has caused others.  Thus, his evil is 'banal' and more frightening as a result because, at times, it appears understandable, even reasonable. As for the briefly seen demon, although it's lame by today's standards, it still works due to its nightmarish appearance.

Folks, I can safely say that Night/Curse of the Demon was one of the best horror films of the 1950s. There is a reason that Richard O'Brien glorified this film in the song ""Science Fiction/Double Feature"" that opens his homage to these movies, ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show.""  He did so because this film is a classic, like ""Forbidden Planet,"" ""King Kong,"" and ""When Worlds Collide.""  Also a final note, a sound bite from this film (said by an entranced medium during a seance) is used to open the Kate Bush song, ""The Hounds of Love.""  So there's another pop culture reference for you to investigate to your hearts content!

614689,3,6303257429,"Night of the Demon (Jacques Tourneur, 1957)

While it seems, these days, that Jacques Tourneur is most remembered for his detective films (Out of the Past is a perennial entry on critical 100-best lists), he was a wide-ranging director who was also responsible for one of the finest war-era horror films, Cat People. After Tourneur broke with Val Lewton in 1944, he generally stayed away from horror, preferring to make mysteries, noir thrillers, and the odd western, until 1957. That year he teamed up with Hal Chester, who'd co-written an adaptation of an M. R. James short story and was looking for a top-notch director. He got Tourneur, and the resultant pairing gave the world Night of the Demon, cited by many as one of the scariest horror films ever made.

The movie begins with an opening shot of a stone circle accompanied by a cheesy voiceover. Having some problems in the scare department here. Things get worse when the movie spends ten minutes detailing a plane trip taken by our hero, scientist/skeptic John Holden (Dana Andrews, probably best remembered these days for back-to-back excellent performances in Laura and State Fair in the mid-forties), where he meets the lovely Joanna Harrington (The March Hare's Peggy Cummins in one of her final big-screen appearances). Holden gets to England for his conference, and through a rather convoluted series of events, is brought into contact with Karswell (Lust for Life's Niall MacGinnis), the very head of the cult Holden plans to denounce at the conference. He discovers, however, that there may be something to the cult business, and that it may have to do with that lovely girl from the plane...

There's an odd balance to this movie; once you get past all the annoyances at the beginning of the movie, which drag along stupidly, Tourneur picks up the pace and the acting goes to pot. Andrews is solid, and Cummins and MacGinnis are both serviceable. Everyone else here ranges from barely competent to outrageously bad. (Lewton could pull good performances out of a rock; Chester was the producer of the Joe Palooka series of movies. Do I need to continue on with that comparison?) And while this movie in no way compares to the genius of Cat People or Out of the Past, what saves it from being entirely unwatchable is that Tourneur is still a fine director, no matter what he's on about. There are some startling shots in this film, and if you're able to appreciate shots for what they are, outside the confines of the film that contains them, then there is some good to be had here. Be warned, however, that this is not a Lewton film. In fact, the producers insisted Tourneur show the monster, when he'd planned a more Lewtonesque film in which the monster itself would never be seen. Would that we'd gotten that movie instead. ***",1263513600,,2799,4.8029045643153525

For atmosphere, suspense, and true horror it has seldom been excelled.  All performances are topnotch with Dana Andrews being very convincing and sympathetic as the American skeptic who comes to London to expose a Satanic cult which he believes is a fraud.  But the finest performance in the film is undoubtedly that of famous British character actor Niall MaGinnis who gives great depth and dimension to the role of the professorial Satanist villain.  What MacGinnis achieves with his beautiful and cultured voice, alone, is quite astonishing, and really he and his remarkable mother set the tone for the whole film. And that tone is amazingly reminiscent of the best of early 20th century horror films which so well employed the talents of other greats, like Claude Reins and Colin Clive.  ----- Evil here is connected with sophistication, with musty leather bound books, and the venerable  reading room of the British Museum, with runes written on parchment,  and ancient secrets that can and have been unearthed by those greedy  and unwise enough to seek them.  The imposing and beautiful house of the villian, the elegant hotel where the principles meet, the lonely roads on which they drive in and around nighttime London --- all of these  are beautifully explored in shining black and white film to sustain a  mood of delicious dread.  A haunting melody, the sound of footsteps following Andrews, the highly charged cries of a tormented ghost speaking through a medium -- all this conspires to make this one of the scariest old films you will ever see.  But the crowning glory of the film is the demon itself.  It's well known, of course,  that the film as originally conceived did not include shots of the actual demon, and that even the cast was surprised to discover the fully realized monster in the theatrical release.  But, oh, what a demon this is.  It is huge, hideous, and utterly terrifying  with monstrous  fangs and  claws, relentlessly pursuing its victims who have not the slightest chance of escape.  I just loved it.  So you get the best of both worlds, really, a film of subtle suggestion, suspense and fear on the one hand which might have worked wonderfully without a real demon; and then this perfectly capitol monster on the other hand, who descends on his victims in the midst of terrifying sound effects and boiling smoke.  --- Of course the film has a strong moral point of view.  The villains are indeed evil; and the good people who resist them are truly good.  Dance with the Devil and you will be damned.  --- The whole thing, in the final analysis is tremendously entertaining and a far cry from some of the chaotic, vulgar  and utterly nihilistic ""horror"" films of today.  I've seen this film probably half a dozen times, and will no doubt watch it many more times -- and as often as I can with some one who has not seen it before ---- but I  will never, never watch it when I'm alone.

614691,4,6303257429,"""Night of the Demon"" is a classic horror film that can now be watched in its complete uncut version. Based on a rather bland British short story by M. R. James, ""Passing the Runes,"" it has all the elements of a film noir.  For those of you familiar with the lyrics of ""Science Fiction, Double Feature"" of the Rocky Horror Picture Show (and who isn't), the reference to Dana Andrews getting the ""runes, and passing them used lots of skills,"" refers to this film, the only one in the song that isn't science fiction. This film ran afoul of art vs. profit, and in the end producer Hal E. Chester had his way over the objections of writer Charles Bennet and director Francois Tourneur who both didn't want the demon's appearance to be actually shown, but left up to the audience's imagination. To make certain there would be no doubt , he chose the most obvious depiction of demonic clich he could find: horns, wings, claws and fangs. There are some problems with the film, however. Niall MacGinnis as Dr. Julian Karswell doesn't come across as a hard-core demon worshipper. With his love of throwing children's' parties and passing out candy and ice cream to the kids, he seems like a nice old codger who stumbled across a knack for raising demons and now he's stuck with it. Too sweet also is Athene Seyler who in the role of Karswell's mother, provides the comedy relief (she is a riot in the sance scene). You just don't get the impression that the people involved with this ""devil cult"" are evil, just trying to make the best out of a bad situation and trying to make skeptics believe that demons exist.

From the outset of ""Night of the Demon,"" when the uncle is racing his car at breakneck speed down a dark, tree-lined street in the woods, his shifting headlights illuminating the tunnel of overarching leaves, you feel you're in for a thrill ride of a film.  And you will not be disappointed.

The director, Jacques Tourneur, has crafted a classic tale of the supernatural.  He uses the full complement of noir ingredients--dusky, shadowy streets and drastic camera angles--to convey a tone of eerie dread.

The rational mind of Dana Andrews's Dr. Holden tackles the evil supernatural juggernaut conjured by Professor Karswell--and guess who wins?  Who does win?  It's never really clear whether Professor Karswell, the ringleader of the devil cult, is killed by the demon or by a train that runs him over.  In the end, was Karswell actually killed by his overactive imagination that panicked him into running into the path of the onrushing locomotive?  The ambiguity of the ending is artistically satisfying.

One of my favorite scenes is an obscure one of a dim-lit road, shot from above, with a cat skulking along a building's first-story ledge as Dr. Holden's car careers around the corner below it.  The scene reminds me of that famous set piece in ""The Third Man,"" wherein a kitten commences to wash its face at the feet of Harry Lime, who appears in the film for the first time, as he stands in the nocturnal shadows in a doorway overlooking the street.

""Demon"" is a must-see for horror buffs, and for anyone who enjoys outstanding films, for that matter.

614695,5,6303257429,"I first saw the Night of the Demon when it was made back in 1958 and rate the film at five stars. I thought it was a great film with very respectable special effects for the time. No question that by today's standards the scenes of the demon at the beginning and end were poor. But the pace, great atmosphere and basic story made up for the dated special effects. I think those younger horror movie buffs who watch this film for the first time today will enjoy it.

Did everyone (or anyone) notice the monofilament pulling the parchment through the train and along the tracks during the final scenes? I watched the very clear DVD on my large screen HDTV and couldn't believe that I saw this ""error"" for the first time. I did not notice it in the theater back in 1958. Every once in a while a great old horror flick can suffer at the hands of HDTV.

When I first saw this movie during one late Saturday night showing with my Mom I was about 10 years old and horror movie standards were very different. Mom did not approve of the film and only saw it because I had requested it. I remember her watching to see if it bothered me (no chance).

No matter how many times I went into SETUP and hit subtitles OFF, the subtitles could not be removed - and the only DVD menu available was in Japanese, and that isn't even available when the selections come up, you have to hit MENU to get to it.  Whoever remastered this forgot to address this issue - as a result, I was forced to watch this with Japanese subtitles.  The ""interactive menu"" promised on the back cover was nowhere to be seen unless you can read Japanese.

As for the film itself, as reviewers below have pointed out, ""Curse of the Demon"" is the American version of the British film, ""Night of the Demon."" The British original, IMO, is nearly indistinguishable from the slightly shorter American version, and the extra footage makes absolutely no difference to the context and story that I could discern.

""Night/Curse of the Demon"" comes to us via director Jacques Tourneur, whose earlier works, like the 1940s ""Cat People"" and the film noir classic ""Out of the Past"" (with a young Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer), guaranteed a lasting place in cinema annals for Tourneur and his sometime collaborator, Val Lewton (Lewton did not work on ""Night of the Demon"").

""Night of the Demon"" is based on the short story ""Casting the Runes"" by M. R. James. It follows a now tried-and-true formula (though one less familiar at the time this film came out): a thoroughly modern and sceptical man (Prof. John Holden, played by a much-aged Dana Andrews, showing the effects of years of alcoholism), who has utterly rejected the idea of the supernatural, is suddenly confronted with the real thing, and takes a dangerous journey to belief.  In fact, Prof. Holden's initial presence on the scene is for the express purpose of debunking, with his English friend Prof. Harrington, the claims of supernatural power asserted by one Prof. Karswell (Niall MacGinnis, an underrated character actor who played roles as diverse as Levin in ""Anna Karenina"" and a leprous priest in ""The Nun's Story""). But the film opens with the death of Prof. Harrington under circumstances that leave the viewer in no doubt as to the reality of Karswell's power.  Rather, the film follows Holden's progress toward the truth after he arrives in London and is met with the news of Harrington's death.

Prof. Harrington's niece, Joanna, (Peggy Cummins)contacts Prof. Holden when he arrives in London - she has not accepted the official account of her uncle's death (electrocution via telephone wires falling on his car) and enlists Holden's help in uncovering the truth.  But as she and he do so, they are dogged by a thickening sense of indefinable horror that, at last, neither can deny. As Holden and Joanna move through the eerily lit, smoky confines of London to the equally eerily lit countryside outside the city, the atmospheric terror builds at a steady pace.  A confrontation with Karswell at his country estate (obtained, like the rest of his luxurious lifestyle, through terrorizing the local farmers with his powers), marks one turning point in Holden's perceptions, and the mental breakdown of a local farmer who defied Karswell's power marks another. Block by block, the wall of assumptions that protected Holden (read: modern society) from acknowledging the reality of the supernatural begins to crumble, until Holden is forced to match wits with Karswell on Karswell's terms in order to save his life.  The last ten minutes of the film literally crackle with suspense as this duel builds to its conclusion.

Dana Andrews was reputedly extremely unhappy with the last few minutes of the film, which appear to try to soften the finality with which the supernatural is accepted as ""real"", and as a result distanced himself from the film afterward.  Viewers may make up their own minds as to that.

Regardless, the film bears all the stylistic touches that made other Tourneur works like ""Cat People"" and ""Out of the Past"" into the cult classics they are today. ""Night/Curse of the Demon"" most definitely deserves its place beside them.

But beware the remastered DVD with its Japanese subtitles!  You'll be just as well served by buying the American original.",1202256000,5,4253,4.934173669467787

the gourmet feast at 96 minutes, and ""Curse of the Demon,"" the serviceable
American ""fast-food meal"" version at 82 minutes.  Watch ""Curse"" first,
and then see what a richer film is ""Night.""

  There has been much discussion through the years about the demon being
shown so explicitly.  Even though obviously fake, it looks terrifying,
with bat wings, a huge maw, and hell-smoke pouring out, but so punctual!
The demon, variously called ""Seth-Typhon,"" ""Moloch,"" ""Baal,"" or
""Asmodeus,"" has provided a scary image on which to hang the film's
publicity, down to this day.  Also, some critics have complained that
Dana Andrews sometimes seems inebriated, but observe that his character
is frequently taking drinks!

  Just as in a Hitchcock thriller, there is a scene of goofy humor
as the seance gets underway.  The women sing a sappy song called
""Cherry Ripe"" because ""the spirits like it.""  Then the medium barks
a fierce greeting as ""Crimson Eagle"" ""from an obscure part"" of the
U.S.A.  Then he becomes hearty ""Mr. MacGregor"" with an incredibly
thick Scottish burr, then a little girl who has lost her doll, finally
channeling Professor Harrington.  Fans of the Kate Bush song ""Hounds
of Love""  will recognize his outburst which follows.

  Also like Hitchcock, the movie builds carefully to a breathtaking
climax.  Notice how passing the runes to the wary villain plays like
a high-stakes game of ""Simon Says.""  The finish will leave you with
a chilly shiver as the last express train hurtles by, whistle shrieking
like a lost soul falling into Hell.  It's a great creepy entertainment
with lots of ominous shadowy places, eccentric British players, and
a fantastic music score by Clifton Parker, but too scary for very young

614743,5,6303257429,"Night of the Demon/Curse of the Demon is one of the greatest films of the 1950's. A cult classic that holds up to repeated viewings. The film is based on the M R James story 'Cast the Runes' and features Dana Andrews as John Holden, a sceptical psychologist who scepticism begins to ebb away after he meets Dr Julian Karswell.

Karswell is played brilliantly by Niall MacGinnis and there are a number of marvellous scenes between Holden and Karswell. Perhaps the best being a scene in the London Library. Of the remaining cast Maurice Denham is deserving of mention for his small but crucial role at the start as Professor Harrington. There is a marvellous scene at the beginning of the film when Harrington visits Karswell. Its beautifully written and played by the two actors.

Although it is often quoted that the director Jacques Tournier did not want the Demon shown in the film at all, but bowed to pressure from the producers, the Demon when it appears is a remarkable special effects creation for 1957. Tournier was probably right but it doesn't spoil the film that much.

This double bill DVD version contains two different versions: The American cut called 'Curse of the Demon' which ran to 82mins and the British cut 'Night of the Demon' which ran to 95mins.

Both versions are contained on this DVD, with the English version the better for those twelve minutes, but in truth there is little significant difference between the two, and if you are a conniseur of 1950s horror films you will find both equally fascinating.

Based on the short story ""Casting the Runes"" by M.R. James, DEMON offers the tale of American psychologist John Holden (Dana Andrews) who travels to a conference in England, planning to debunk a devil worshipping cult led by Karswell (Niall MacGinnis.) Unfortunately for the professionally skeptical Holden, Karswell's powers are genuine: he has successfully translated an ancient text and, through runes written on parchment, casts a curse first against Holden's collegue and then against Holden himself.

DEMON was directed by Jacques Tourneur, who worked with producer Val Lewton to create a series of memorable and distinctly noir-ish horror films at RKO in the 1940s: CAT PEOPLE, I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, and THE LEOPARD MAN. All three films created a sense of unease and scream-aloud fear by implication and suggestion, and although DEMON is much more explicit in its effects, Tourneur brings the same sensibility to bear on DEMON, endowing it with remarkable authority and power in spite of several distinct flaws.

Chief among these flaws is the script, which can best be described as somewhat abrupt in terms of dialogue, and leading man Dana Andrews, whose performance is remarkably unsubtle even in a decade noted for a lack of cinematic restraint. Film lore also has it that Tourneur lobbied against showing the demon on screen, and given the fact that the visual is hardly inspired this clearly would have been the better choice. None the less, DEMON has jolts and jars aplenty, not the least of which is Karswell: Niall MacGinnis' performance, with its mixture of the commonplace and the flatly evil, is remarkably fine. The film also sports a host of memorable set pieces: the storm, the flying parchment, Dr. Holden's exploration of Karswell's mansion, Dr. Holden's run through the night forrest, and the final train sequence, to name but a few.

Although it is not well known today, like Tourneur's films with Lewton, DEMON has cast a very long shadow in terms of influence, and it is very difficult to imagine such films as ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE CHANGELING without both this film and those that proceeded it. Recommended.

Jacques Tourneur was already the recognized master of restraint in the horror genre by the time he directed this British production in 1957.  His earlier collaborations with producer Val Lewton generated a series of minor masterpieces, including ""Cat People"" and ""I Walked With A Zombie.""  Not content to direct a standard episodic thriller, Tourneur's films are imbued with a certain intelligence and respect for the audience.  ""Night of the Demon"" is no exception.  Charles Bennett's and Hal E. Chester's  thoughtprovoking and thoroughly frightening screenplay forms the framework on which Tourneur hangs several remarkably well directed sequences.  And, his work with actors Dana Andrews and Peggy Cummins yields fine, workmanlike performances; however, he gleans brilliant work from Niall MacGinnis and Athene Seyler in supporting roles that are richly drawn and invested with real humor.  This is not to say they are comic relief, these characters are indeed tragic and evil.  Nearly everything about ""Night of the Demon"" is perfect.  The production is first rate and its artistic merits are undeniable; from Ted Sciafe's black and white cinematography to Ken Adams production design, the care with which this tale is wrought is evident.  Based on M.R. James' story ""Casting the Runes,"" the film deals with an investigation into the witchcraft related death of a colleague by an American psychologist (Andrews).  Aided by the dead man's niece (Cummins), the doctor must determine whether the power of a local magician (MacGinnis) to conjure up ""demons"" is truth or fiction; and if that power was used for murder.

614794,5,6303257429,"""Curse of the Demon"" [aka: ""Night of the Demon""] is one of those rare horror films that contain all of the elements of horror I believe make a horror film truly a classic: The suggestion of horror and the nuance of terror. The first time I viewed this film; I knew right from the opening scenes that this was my kind of horror film. Everything about this film is exceptional. From the opening scene of Stonehenge, where the films narrator calmly lures the audience into the picture with the possibility that there are unknown forces in the universe, to the eerie music playing in the background, this black and white 1950's horror classic is a must see. It's the type of film where you don't need to see gore, as the director knew what REALLY scares an audience: The fear of the unknown.

In my opinion this is the greatest horror film [from the West] to come out of the 1950's. I have not seen all of the horror films from this era, but for the time being, this one remains my favorite horror film of the 1950's. The films main protagonist is a psychologist named Dr. Holden (Dana Andrews). His main field of study is parapsychology, and his main interest is in debunking the occult and any other paranormal activity: Especially those who claim to have paranormal powers. Dr. Holden is extremely scientific in his research, and believes that those who do practice the occult, or claim to have psychic abilities are either charlatans, or mentally ill. He will soon discover just how wrong he has been, as he is about to confront the most dangerous adversary he has ever encountered in his many years of research.

Enter Dr. Julian Karswell (Niall MacGinnis), the films antagonist, who is a practitioner of the occult. MacGinnis gives an outstanding and stellar performance as a man whose charming personality and outward appearances belie the fact that he is not only a dangerous practitioner of the occult, but that his powers and ability to harness the dark and evil forces within his grasp are mere child's play to him. Dr. Holden will soon realize that Dr. Karswell's powers are more than just smoke and mirrors. When something happens to a friend and colleague in England, Dr. Holden heads off to Europe to investigate. His friend was doing an article on Julian Karswell, exposing Karswell as a fraud and charlatan. However, this friend is too late in discovering the truth. When Dr. Karswell approaches Dr. Holden, who is conducting his own seminar in exposing frauds---with Karswell as the main topic, Dr. Karswell tries to persuade Holden not to do this, but to no avail.

The films creepy and heavily nuanced atmosphere gives the viewer a terrifying look into the unknown, as the narrative flows with convincing clarity in showing Dr. Holden attempting to come to terms with both his scientific beliefs, and the reality that what is occurring in his present predicament may not have any scientific explanation. We see Dr. Holden conflicted with his own logic, and yet amidst this is his all too human fear in fighting off the terror of an unknown entity, which he feels is awaiting him. The camera shots and angles are maximized to the fullest in capturing terrifying scenes behind every tree, hallway, and street corner. As Dr. Holden begins to learn more about his adversary, he comes to regret ever meeting the man. My only complaint with the film is the Demon, which is a bit dated in terms of special effects. When I first viewed the film, I thought it should not have been used. And in fact, the film is so heavily nuanced with great scenes of horror and terror, that the Demon was not really necessary.

Moreover, I have since learned that it was initially not going to be part of the film originally, however, it was decided on a last minute decision to use the Demon. Nevertheless, this does not detract from the eeriness and creepiness of the film. In fact, this film holds up extremely well, considering it was released in 1957. [As many films lose that special appeal after many years] Not so with this picture. The films atmosphere, especially at night is terrific. The director of this film, Jacques Tourneur, did an absolutely fantastic job in giving the film the nuances and chilling sense of terror that one does not find in too many films of this genre. I will not nit-pick the little flaws in the story, as the film as a whole more than makes up for any flaws [Demon in particular]. This film is highly recommended. A classic!

614796,5,6303257429,"Though I'm quite a big fan of the horror film from the late 60's and on I don't really have that much of a taste for or knowledge of the genre prior to then.  Nevertheless, there's definitely some good stuff, and 'Night of the Demon' is about the best of it, probably my favorite horror movie, pre-'Night of the Living Dead'.  (Though 'Carnival of Souls' does come close.)  'Night of the Demon' has got the same basic feel as most of your B&W horror movies from this era, but the craftsmanship is well above the norm, with eerie music and cinematography along with a first-rate plot and solid acting.  (The few visual effects are, needless to say, quite dated, but they work for a modern audience better than just about anything else from the era, and are still kinda neat, in their way.)  All in all, this is a first-rate slice of atmospheric horror, and it ought to appeal to discerning fans of the particularl style regardless of their especially preferred era.

The film centers around Dr. John Holden and Julian Karswell.  Holden is an American who has flown into London to attend a paranormal psychology symposium.  He is, of course, a total skeptic who quickly runs afoul of Karswell, the apparent leader of a local cult and reputed magician.  Holden plans to do an expose on his group, so Karswell retaliates, eventually claiming that Holden will die exactly at 10 PM a few nights later if he does not back off.  Holden is unconvinced, but proceeds to investigate the scene, with the assistance of Joanna, a believer and the niece of one of Harrington's prior victims.

`Night of the Demon' tips its hand almost immediately with a demon attack shown early in the film.  This was done, I believe, due to studio interference, and while it was probably unfortunate at the time, I suspect it actually helps the film for a modern audience.  It kind of undermines the tension of the film, arguably, since there could be some debate as to whether or not anything supernatural is actually going on were it not for this scene.  For a modern audience, however, I suspect the final demon appearance is bound to be anticlimactic, so I think it's best to deflate this inevitability immediately and prevent this disappointment, just allowing the atmospheric middle section to work well on it's own.  And work it does.  This is one legitimately eerie movie, as Holden slowly sees the demon's presence manifested thru inexplicable music and the vague sensation that something is there.  There are a couple of particularly effective scenes, such as when Holden flees from Karswell's home in the middle of the night trailed by steaming footprints and a mysterious vaporous cloud, and the later hypnosis-induced interview of a now catatonic former cult-member.

If the film has a major problem it's Holden himself.  He's a self-possessed, arrogant jerk who's nowhere near as clever as he thinks he is and maintains incredulity well past the breaking point.  Niall MacGinnis's  Karswell is a much more entertaining personality, charming and playful but, of course, with a real dark side.  Joanna, the female sidekick, of sorts, is kind of bland, though she provides for better audience identification than our leading man.

It's difficult to describe the film much further with out giving too much away, but suffice to say that the investigation into the cult and the curse is sufficiently absorbing, and the background of the film is more convincing and well-established than it would generally be in a 50's horror or sci-fi film.  Finally, the climax is well staged and executed, and makes the most of the limited fx of the age.

Yeah, I'm done I guess.  First-rate low-key horror here.  Check it out.

It seems that a cult lead by a Julian Karswell based on ancient runic symbols and involved with devil worship in to be the focus of the meeting.

Andrews learns that symposium leader and colleague Henry Harrington has been killed by a bizarre electrocution at a time fortold by the creepy Karswell.  The skeptical Andrews accompanied by Harrington's attractive niece Joanna played by Peggy Cummins is invited to Karswell's estate.  While there he comes to believe that Karswell actually may have some sort of connection to the supernatural. A campy winged demonic creature that emanates from a patch of smoke, apparently summoned by some ancient writings on a piece of parchment appears and threatens Andrews while walking through the woods on Karswell's estate.  This same demon had appeared just prior to the electrocution of Harrington.

Karswell then predicts Andrews' death as he has secretly passed to him the accursed piece of parchment which will summon the demon.

This cult film made in 1957 is head and shoulders above the average Hammer productions which followed both in terms of atmosphere and lack of melodrama. There are several stand-out moments including the eerie ""Demon through the woods"" and the ""storm-conjuring"" by the evil Doctor-Magician in the guise of a harmless children's clown. The locations (British Museum and Stonehenge included) are  excellent and add to the story greatly.

If you're like me, you heard this reference to Jacques Tourneur's Night of the Demon in Richard O'Brien's lyrics to the song ""Science Fiction Double Feature"" before you had a chance to see the movie starring Dana Andrews and Peggy Cummins.

I'd read about this film for years and it is good, but not a masterpiece, and certainly not as good as Tourneur's films with producer Val Lewton - - Cat People and I Walked with a Zombie.

The actors are great. Here Dana Andrews's smarminess works. Andrews is a scientist who refuses to allow the possibility of the supernatural. (""I'm not open to persuasion."") The contrast between the prim Englishwoman Peggy Cummins plays in Night of the Demon (""You think I'm gullible"") to her role as Annie Laurie Starr, the low-class American thief and killer who goes Gun Crazy with John Dall, is almost unbelievable. Niall MacGinnis is perfect (though the devilish goatee might be too much) as a covenmaster who's more terrified than his victims. (""He really ought to be married, but he's so fussy,"" his mother says in the code of the period.)

I think the movie has two problems. One, we never find out what the devil-worshippers are trying to do - - they're not trying to bring the Antichrist, or sacrifice a virgin, or get revenge on a town that burned a witch centuries ago, or any of the usual things. The members of the Brotherhood just play a game of Satanic tag - - they pass a scroll of runic script to unwitting victims who then die horribly, killed by a ""demon"" that looks like a bad Godzilla picking up tiny people in Tokyo. (The demon was supposedly added by the producers over Tourneur's objections - - easy to believe when you compare this film to the suggestive creepiness of Cat People and I Walked with a Zombie.)

Night of the Demon is The Ring from the era of Stonehenge.

All throughout though (not just in the first and last scenes where we see the demon), the movie shows too much, like when a housecat turns into a huge predator.  There are also quite a few of the cheap scares that have become inevitable in horror movies since the slasher era (I like slasher movies, just not the cliches). A hand falls on a shoulder - - it's a friend. A door opens suddenly behind the hero - - it's his colleagues' hotel room. Two monsters jump from behind a tree - - it's kids with Halloween masks.  Boo!

I guess ""Boo!"" is the point of any horror story, and a lot of the time you're perfectly content with that, but I just expected more from Night of the Demon.",1120780800,2,2552,4.459227467811159
614880,5,6303257429,"This film is one of the all-time GREAT horror films, DESPITE Dana Andrew's wooden performance (many of his character's reactons seem much too ""laid-back"" for the more-than-obvious dangers building-up against his character)--generally credited to Mr. Andrews' unfortunate alcoholism.  The controversy over the monster I think is silly.  It is a well-designed monster, and it IS scary, so what's the beef?  As I understand it, even Tourneur came to accept the wiseness of using the monster in the end, despite some elitist reviewers' protestations to the contrary.  This is a FILM, after all, not a radio show!  RECOMMENDED HIGHLY, despite Mr. Andrews's lackadaisical performance.",1112400000,4,678,5.543689320388349

A retelling of ""Casting the Runes"" by M. R. James, for its time this film was downright terrifying (especially the amazingly nasty British release).  Witchcraft, demons, supernatural winds, and one of filmdom's best onscreen villains ever( Niall MacGinnis as Mr. Karswell).

After watching this I couldn't stop thinking about it.  So many scenes still cause chills, and the demon is just freaky.  For any one who is affected by atmosphere in Horror movies be prepared to sleep with a light on after watching this one.

I've seen hundreds of Horror movies and most of them have one thing in common, they just aren't scary.  Curse of the Demon was released in 1958 and it's scary even today.  From it's very ominous opening monologue to its hellish ending you can't go wrong with this movie.

But don't let that put you off.

614922,5,6303257429,"I can't think of enough superlatives to describe this film.  If you love intelligent acting, plotting, scripting and if you love the supernatural literary genre but are disappointed with almost all horror films, this is probably your film.  If writers like T.E.D. Klein, Robert Aickman, and L.P. Hartley are your cup of tea, you are almost certain to love this film.

Niall MacGinnis playing Karswell is perfectly cast.  His performance was so good that I find it a great pity he didn't act in more films. One in which he did play the lead role was the early 50's film ""Martin Luther"", and he did an outstanding job there, as well.

The rest of the cast are all terrific in their roles, also. Dana Andrews, for example, plays the rationalistic scientist flawlessly, as far as I'm concerned.

This is a very rare film, in that I've seen it at least five times, and probably more like seven times, and still love it as much as ever.  Part of the reason for this is that Tourneur does not at all insult your intelligence, events move quickly, and in each scene there's a lot going on on the surface and just below it.  (I must add that generally even films that I enjoy a great deal usually lose, for me, much of  their appeal the second time I see them.)

This film mixes wonderfully all sorts of things, including humor,  with a supernatural tale, that will leave the refined  connoisseur of the genre absolutely spellbound.

One is immediately struck by the startlingly effective cinematography--the pristine black and white textures, the gloom-filled night scenes, the sumptuous tones.  The acting is remarkably natural for a piece from the 1950's, and the story is taught, well-crafted, and thoroughly engaging.

614925,5,6303257429,"This film was released in 1957 as the B movie of a double feature, the A film being Revenge of Frankenstein.  As if to show the relative status of the two films, Frankenstein was in color, whereas Curse of the Demon was in b/w.  I went with a friend who found Frankenstein scary and Demon silly.  My reaction was exactly the opposite.  As we walked home after the movie she teased me about having ""the parchment.""  It sent chills through my body then and it still does today.

Of all the horror movies that were cranked out in the fifties, this one was the very best of the lot.  It was the cliche then to not show the monster until almost the end of the picture, but in this case we see the demon up close and personal at the very beginning, when it descends on and mangles the electrocuted corpse of Professor Harrington, who committed suicide by grasping a downed power line rather than be killed by the monster.  The film makers have been criticized for reversing the cliche in this case, but the device works.  Thrice again we hear the noise that always accompanies the monster's appearance.  The next time we see nothing but expect Dana Andrews to be swiftly devoured at any moment.  The time after that we see the ball of smoke in which it customarily appears.  On the last go round the monster disposes of the sorcerer who called it up, leaving his smoking and mangled corpse beside a railroad track.  We assume the sorcerer is now in hell, but as Dana Andrews is made to say at the end of the film, ""sometimes if is better not to know.""  Indeed.  He must be a pretty compassionate man, considering that it was the sorcerer's intent for him to be in hell instead.  But the significance for us viewers is that the film makers are not going to tell us whether Karswell's soul is the demon's toy or not, even though the seance scene earlier in the movie implies that this would be the case.  It is for them to know and for us to figure out.

Pretty compelling stuff.  Some subtleties that fifties reviewers either did not notice or could not refer to:  Peggy Cummins plays Joanna Harrington, niece of the deceased Professor Harrington, who is determined to get to the bottom of her uncle's death.  Dr. Holden (Dana Andrews) wants to go to bed with her, but her interest in him is merely to have an ally in her confrontation with the sorcerer Julian Karswell (Niall McGinnis.)  One can certainly understand why she would want one.  This makes her, more than Holden, the main character of the drama, although that is not apparent to most viewers.  The plot would not move forward without her.  More than his scientific cynical interest in proving Karswell a crank, Holden's lust for Joanna is what keeps drawing him to her until through the association he discovers that Karswell is for real and intends to kill him with black magic.  Karswell, on the other hand, is clearly a homosexual, a wealthy middle aged man who lives with his mother, nary an available female in sight.  What the screen writers were doing with this is not clear, unless it is to make sense of the scene in which Karswell kidnaps Joanna at the end of the film.  As a homosexual Karswell neither wishes to make love to Joanna nor even to talk to her.  Instead he hypnotizes her so he can endure an intolerably boring train ride in silence.  This may have been fifties prudery or the screen writers may have been saying something here.  The train ride does set the stage for the final confrontation between Karswell and his intended victim (Holden, played by Andrews), and, in turn, between Karswell and the demon, which must kill one of the two men and clearly does not care which it is.  Unlike Harrington before him, Karswell lacks the courage to commit suicide by throwing himself in the path of the train, and is alive and conscious when the demon mangles him.

The usual fifties horror cliches are here.  There is a seance scene in which the unfortunate Professor Harrington is called forth from hell to say he is still being menaced by the demon.  There is a hypnosis scene in which Hobarth relives his encounter with the demon.  But these scenes are so well done and contribute so much to the plot development that we do not recognize them as standard horror movie fare for the period.  The film makers have managed to freshen them up so that we shudder and do not groan.

The trailer is not on the DVD, so for the benefit of horror fans, here is a recap by someone who saw it in its first theatrical release.  The same voice which introduces the movie says: ""Do not laugh at supernatural demons from hell, because THEY DO EXIST!""  Then a train roars by and the words ""Curse of the demon"" appear on the screen.  Not the best preview ever done.  By telling the audience not to laugh, it got twitters from every direction, and it conveyed nothing of the bone freezing, teeth rattling terror the thing produced in 1957 in kids who knew they would have to walk home in the dark after the show was over.

Watch it.  And leave the light on when you go to sleep.  You might want to hang a cross over your bed.  And by all means sleep tight.",1094947200,7,5115,4.463362068965517

Night of the Demon - UK release 95 Mins

Curse of the Demon - US release 83 Mins

Anyway - Dana Andrews plays a very rational psychologist who becomes embroiled in a murder mystery, hints of witchcraft, ancient runes and so on. Of course, out hero is much to sensible to subscribe to this nonsensical mumbo jumbo, but as he becomes more involved, he begins to realize he may have been mistaken. The genuine angst, and fear of the characters is almost tangible in places, and a tight script, more than ably directed by Jacques Tourneur (Cat People, I walked with a Zombie etc) keeps you glued. Ok, the demon looks a little silly, but this WAS 1957 folks, give them a break! The main point is that there is a good story, that still gives you some chills. The ever present human fear of, ""it couldn't be? .......could it?"" that had audiences squirming in their seats back in 1957, is what makes the movie work.

The odd thing about the DVD is that the British version, though actually several minutes longer, seems identical to the US version, and I know this film from childhood's ""Terror in the Night"" broadcasts. In other words, this may be the unique case where the US distributor cut the film without actually losing anything. The producer's intrusion - inserting the demon in the beginning sequence - is easily dealt with : just close your eyes at the obvious moment. Too bad they couldn't cut it in one of the versions to fit the original intentions. This film has the rare quality of cinema wit, which is to say it's not really in the dialogue, but the actor's facial reactions and actions and even editing; very rare for this genre. And that is in spite of Dana Andrews' rather hungover-looking performance. Tourneur is an underrated director; check out his ""Cat People"" films - particularly the subtle and superior 'sequel' 'Curse of...', and his late work on several episodes of the original ""Twilight Zone"". As for the monster (maligned elsewhere on this page), he's quite effective, particularly the sounds he generates - and the way he does his work at the end is horrifyingly hilarious.

614928,5,6303257429,"The distributor advertising this DVD as a ""Double Feature"" stretches the truth a bit. ""Curse of the Demon"" is merely the shortened American version of the British film ""Night of the Demon."" The American version runs thirteen minutes shorter and is by far the weaker cut of the film, if still a fine piece of work. It's a nice feature to have the complete American cut on this disk for the sake of comparison with the original, but this is hardly a ""double feature."" And there's no reason to watch the edited, shorter version when you have the superior British original of one of the seminal horror movies of all time on the same DVD.

""Night of the Demon"" hit theaters in 1957 and marked a turning point in macabre cinema. Director Jacques Tourneur had made some important 1940s horror films (""Cat People,"" ""Leopard Man,"" and ""I Walked with a Zombie,"" as well as the film noir classic ""Out of the Past"") that moved against the grain of the gothic fantasies that Universal produced during the 1930s. With ""Night of the Demon,"" Tourneur cemented the idea of the modern horror film, where the terrors of the gothic, demonic, and supernatural appear within the realm of the modern, everyday world -- the essentially rational setting of the contemporary times. The success of this film would eventually lead to such movies in the following decades as ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Exorcist,"" which took place in the recognizable contemporary world, where the invasion of supernatural forces seemed all the more ghastly.
The screenplay comes from the short story ""Casting the Runes"" by master Victorian ghost story writer M. R. James. (You can find this story in an excellent and currently in-print volume of the same name.) In the story, a professor and practitioner of the black arts, Karswell, has found a way to send demonic forces against his academic foes by passing them a slip of paper covered with magical runes. The movie expands the premise: Karswell (Niall MacGinnis, who played Zeus in ""Jason and the Argonauts"") leads a witchcraft circle and uses his rune-tracker to send a demon after his opponent, professor Harrington. After Harrington's death, his American friend, psychologist Holden (Dana Andrews), comes to America to learn more, but scoffs at the idea that anything supernatural could lurk behind Harrington's death. Unfortunately for Holden, Karswell feels threatened enough to decide to send his murdering monster after the American.
Tourneur brilliantly films the movie in a split style, dividing between realistic, bland daytime scenes, meant to have an almost documentary feel, and increasingly warped and bizarre nighttime scenes as the curse of the demon moves closer and closer to Holden and it becomes harder for him to deny the truth of what is occurring. The demon itself is a point of controversy among film students. Tourneur was famous for keeping his horrors hidden, and some people believe that he never planned to show the demon at all, but the producer forced him to shove it up front. The appearance early in the film of the full demon might have been an error (it would have worked better to save it for the finale), but its materialization at the end is pretty incredible and it's hard to believe that Tourneur wouldn't have wanted the ending any other way. This is (excuse the pun) one hell of a demon. Designed by Ken Adam (who would later create the sets for most of the James Bond films, as well as ""Dr. Strangelove""), the monster looks like it leaped from the freakiest medieval woodcut representation of Hell. The special effects and sounds accompanying it are also eerie and disturbing.
Andrews is a bit stodgy in his part, but Niall MacGinnis makes up for it with his scene-stealing role as Karswell. MacGinnis is both a bumbling, whimsical British professor (complete with a doting and scolding mother), and a cold-blooded sorcerer -- often both in one scene. The ending of the film, involving the passing of the runes, is both funny and incredibly tense, leading to one of the most stunning climaxes in horror films. Peggy Cummins as the love interest is delightfully perky and intelligent, much more so than female leads in most horror films.
The only extra on the disk is the inclusion of the American cut. However, the film is in perfect condition, and is finally shown in the original aspect ration of 1:1.66 (a typical European screen format infrequently seen in the U.S.; it's halfway between the shape of a TV screen and the typical 1:1.85 that most American movies are shot in today). ""Night of the Demon"" is essential horror film viewing for anyone who wants to understand the development of the genre into its current form.

My first comment is this matey, I think it was wise to show the demon at the beginning of the film, as so many of you have objected to. It was wise because otherwise I may not have made it to the end of the film when they showed the demon again. Yes, it looked fake, but it was effective.
The film starts out waaaaay too sloooow. So at least by showing the demon you know you may get more action.
My second comment goes a little something like this, I laughed my little clover leaves off during the seance. When the ""medium"" starts speaking in tongues and moaning like he is going downhill on a bike on a bumpy road. I don't mean to offend the fans of this movie, but that scene was too much camp, too funny, when the little child's voice started, I almost choked.
I got a bigger laugh though when the central character, Dana Andrews goes to Stonehenge, and my friend said ""Oh he's at Stone hedge.""
I had such a good time watching this film.
Let me see, I do have a good point of the film. During the doctor convention, it was kind of spooky, you know? There is a bunch of students sitting watching a doctor and his patient. The patient is comatose because he had once seen the demon. The doctor shoots the patient up with ""amphetamines"" (um hum we know what he pimping in that needle). The patient jumps up and runs into the audience, then runs and jumps out of a window to his death. Well it takes him 2 times to get out of the window, the first time he just runs into it and falls down.
Oh I did laugh again during the big finale, when the demon shows up again, picks up the ""satanic cult leader"" and starts smacking him around. Whew.

As Dr. Holden begins his investigation, he is approached by Karswell who lays a curse on him, however, the skeptical Dr. Holden continues to dig deeper with the help of Dr. Harrington's niece Joanna.  Together they are about to reveal something dark and secret.  Night of the Demon is an horror film that still can keep an audience in suspense even with the old special effects that where used at the time of making of the film.  In the end, the film provides a moment to ponder the scientific method and other things that humans believe the scientific method cannot confirm.",1049587200,2,1058,4.691891891891892

Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

NIGHT OF THE DEMON (95m 39s): A sceptical American psychologist (Dana Andrews) travels to London to expose a notorious witch (Niall MacGinnis) who curses him to die at the hands of a fantastic demon...

CURSE OF THE DEMON (81m 35s): A re-edited version of the above, shorter by 14 minutes, with a couple of scenes rearranged for the US drive-in market.

Directed by Val Lewton's erstwhile protege Jacques Tourneur (CAT PEOPLE, I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE), and written by frequent Hitchcock dramatist Charles Bennett (YOUNG AND INNOCENT, FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT), NIGHT OF THE DEMON is based on the story 'Casting the Runes' by M.R. James and was fashioned as an A-grade shocker (on a B-grade budget) which challenges the notion of unreasoning acceptance/denial of supernatural forces. Dana Andrews (WHILE THE CITY SLEEPS, BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT) plays the blinkered American cynic - cast adrift in a foreign country - who refuses to acknowledge the validity of the demonic threat made against his life, despite all evidence to the contrary, though Bennett's script makes it clear that the movie's central 'villain' (a powerful and charismatic performance by scene-stealer MacGinnis) is afraid of the repercussions which might result if he lifts the curse and relinquishes his magical lifestyle.

Both Tourneur and Bennett were reportedly horrified by the post-production tampering imposed by producer Hal E. Chester, who re-edited the picture for its 1958 US debut, retitled it CURSE OF THE DEMON, and added a monstrous demon to all existing prints on both sides of the Atlantic. Despite the reservations of fans and filmmakers alike, this fearsome-looking creature - which makes a brief appearance at the beginning and end of the movie - generates an authentic jolt of cinematic horror in a film which otherwise prides itself on visual ambiguity. Bennett's script foregrounds the human drama, and Tourneur's first-rate cast (including Athene Seyler [THE QUEEN OF SPADES] as MacGinnis' frightened mother, and Reginald Beckwith [NIGHT OF THE EAGLE] as a dotty psychic) plays it completely straight throughout.

There's at least half a dozen powerful set-pieces, including Maurice Denham's terrifying encounter with the eponymous beast, Andrews' confrontation with MacGinnis during a children's birthday party, and an episode in which Andrews is followed through the deep, dark woods by an unearthly, invisible... 'thing' (I'll say no more). Ted Scaife's atmospheric black and white cinematography makes a virtue of the bleak English landscape, and veteran technicians George Blackwell and Wally Veevers contribute some brief but memorable special effects. The final sequence - set within the claustrophobic confines of a late night train, as the hour of Andrews' death approaches - is a small masterpiece of nail-biting suspense.",1049414400,15,2906,5.418141592920354

614986,5,6303257429,"I just received this as a gift having shamefully neglected it in DVD form. I saw it years ago but just never picked it up again. I'm dumbfounded at how thoroughly entertaining this film is.  It's presented in a beautiful print for one thing but the best thing is the film itself. It's an absolutely engrossing account of an American psychologist Dr. Holden (Dana Andrews) who's an avowed skeptic of the supernatural and his encounter in England with Julian Karswell---who's an avowed practitioner of the Black Arts. Karswell is evil personified yet throws parties for children on his estate dressed as a clown while his mother dishes up home made ice cream!  He immediately tries to scare off Holden (who's investigating a colleague's strange death) by summoning up a hell of a storm. But Holden isn't convinced so easily. It will take the full summoning of a demon from hell to even halfway convince Holden that there are powers beyond that of mortal man. There is much to enjoy in this film.  The demon itself is terrifying as it comes bounding in slow motion out of a cloud of smoke and fire to rend its' intended victims to shreds.  The acting is first-rate and the direction by Jacques Tourneur keeps things tight and moving. There's not a dull moment in this film because it's more than just a horror movie.  It's a great excercise in suspense and sheer terror.  Much of the credit for that goes to Tourneur for filming this as a film noir and keeping the terror happening at night. I would have to couple this film with ""Burn Witch Burn""---another British supernatural horror tale that needs to be on DVD. It too takes skepticism and gives it a good shake. ""Curse of the Demon"" is a masterwork of expert filmmaking and a collector's treat.  Don't miss it.",1040601600,6,1762,4.664516129032258
614987,5,6303257429,"Lost amid Hammer films' color horror films and black & white grade Z monster movies, Night of the Demon was a rare bird; it's intelligent script, sharp direction and strong acting make it one of those underappreciated classics of horror cinema. This supernatural thriller is among director Jacques Tournier's best films.
Once again Tournier demonstrates that it's what we don't see that can be truly terrifying. Yes, the monster ultimately looks a bit chessy by today's standards (it doesn't help that the image of the monster was added at the insistence of the film's producers over Tournier's objections). It's clearly a puppet but the film's powerful and sharp script overcomes many of the weaker elements of the film.
Dana Andrews is a stoic hero and does a decent job but, it's the marvelous performance of Niall McGinnis that really sparkles. He's got an imp's quality and clearly relishes every bit of screen time he's given. Even though he's the villian, he's the most memorable performer.
The transfer is sharp and looks great. It's the first time to my knowledge that Night of the Demon has been presented in its correct aspect ratio. A pity that they couldn't locate the trailers for both versions of the film as it would have been preferrable to the trailers included (for such forgettable films as The Bride). An audio commentary from a film scholar or Tourner expert would have helped the film or, perhaps, any stories from any surviving film crew member or performer (although that's unlikely as the film was made over 40 years ago I'm sure they could have located someone). Also, an audio or video essay on this fine film documenting it's history (or, perhaps, even a copy of the original story/screenplay) would also have been nice.
Still, it's nice that Columbia did such a nice transfer (particularly when compared to the bare bones DVD's of Horror of Dracula and Curse of Frankenstein that Warner has released within the last year). I also like the fact that the British version and US version is included. I grew up watching the US version was impressed with this classic film when it would show up on late night Creature Features programs.",1037836800,2,2161,4.875

James's story, ""The Casting of the Runes"", I saw this originally on TV in the 1960's when local stations provided all youthful ghost & ghoul freaks a chance to develop their cinematic tastebuds for good; well, if not good at least fun cinema!  On another note, I always found Dana Andrews a much better actor than perhaps he was given credit for, and he's in full command of his role in this.  Niall McGinnis (who?) is terrific as the Aleister Crowley inspired evil occultist.  Do yourselves a favor, make some popcorn, gather the kids, and grandparents and curl up for a cozy family valued evening to watch ""Curse of the Demon""!",1035244800,3,656,4.637931034482759
614989,5,6303257429,"I am a sucker for old B&W horror films, and Jacques Tourneur was the best, rivalled only by maybe Mario Bava.  Both men understood that shadow and light and the grey/silver play in between could set the mood as no colour film movie could.  The black and white film could be lensed at such lower light settings, they achieve spooky shadows and the looming sense that something could be hiding in them as no modern colour film ever could.
And Night/Curse of the Demon is the genre at its best.  This movie takes a premise that demons can be called forth and 'sicked' upon a person by the mere passing of a slip of paper of runic symbols - and proceeds to make believers of the audience.  The only sour note in the wonderful production is the monotone perform by Dana Andrews who seems determined not to take the role serious.  It is quite a shame it could not have had an actor with the deftness of Ian McShane give breath to the doubting thomas professor.  Still, even Andrews lack luster performance cannot sink this marvellous film.
Andrews plays a parapsychologist who has come to England to debunk a witch-cult.  Once he arrives, he finds the man who asked him to come has been killed under very mysterious circumstances.  His niece is convinced he was killed by Carlson, the head of the witch, for she finds a reference in her uncle's diary saying Carlson passed him the slip of paper with runic symbols and then he found his diary had all the pages torn from them after a certain date - the date Carlson said something would come for him.  Andrews is a confirmed doubter, but even his faith in logic is rattled has he comes face to face with people of the Auld Ways.  He also have been passed a slip with the symbols and Carlson has informed him his time allotted nears - and his diary is found with all the pages torn from it.
It is horror films at their best, Jacques Tourneur the master showing how it was done.  Be sure to keep an eye out for his I Walked with A Zombie - another masterpiece despite it stupid title.",1032393600,5,2025,4.387700534759358

When the dvd of the British cut came out, I figured it would be demonless.  I was misled.  The ridiculous, stuffed demon appears in this cut as well, and most of the other changes seem centered on a reordering of some of the scenes in the middle.

615013,5,6303257429,"This is a slick cat-and-mouse-game movie.  Dana Andrews, perhaps best known for the beautifully filmed murder classic Laura, plays American pscycholigist John Holden, who journey's to England in order to debunk a so-called Satan-worshipping cult-leader.  Instead, he finds himself pitted in a pscychological and spiritual war against a real-life head of a devil cult.  At stake is his soul.
I've heard Dana Andrews described as ""the aging leading man"" when refering to this role, but he looks and performs in top shape.  The entire supporting British cast is wonderful, led by Niall McGinnis, who plays the part of cult leader Karswell as a genteel, likable middle-aged man, even fearful at times, but determined in his evil beliefs and acts.
The movie begins with the ""accidental death/murder"" of a fellow pscychologist of Holden, which leads to his staunt investigation into the cult and its leader.  As he nears the truth, his owned cursed life begins to take on a distorted, frightening twist.  He is on a countdown to his own murder(litterally predicted hour and second by his nemisis), by a horrific fire-demon that will tear his soul from his body and carry him to the depths of hell.  The movie really picks up pace in the last act, where Dr. Holden and his investiative team interviews an ex-cultist accused of murder while under hypnosys.  The horror coming out in the man's testimony, and the following panicked-mad flight into death, leads Holden on his own near-panick flight, to do a final battle of wits with Karswell.
This DVD includes both the shortened American version, ""Curse of the Demon"", and the longer (better) British version, ""Night of the Demon.""  Both are presented in widescreen.  The source print shows little wear or damage, for being such an old film.  This is a wonderful, bump-in-the-night thriller.

Since not that many people are familiar with the movie I was pleasantly suprised to see it released on DVD.",1031097600,,503,4.154639175257732
615015,5,6303257429,"An underrated classic finally on DVD!!
This is a truly great horror film based on the short story ""Casting The Runes"" by M.R. James. The movie mainly uses concepts from the story and isn't a direct adaptation of the story - kinda like Roger Corman's Poe movies. The names Karswell and Harrington are the only ones that appear in both James' story and the movie. It was directed by Jacques Tourneur whose Cat People (1941) is probably more well known. Unfortunately, the studio mettled a bit and forced Tourneur to show the demon way too early in the movie.
Dr. Holden arrives in England only to discover that his colleague, Professor Harrington, has died under mysterious circumstances. During Dr. Holden's research into what happened, a curse that involves the use of Runic symbols is discovered. Karswell is the leader of a local religious cult.
This DVD contains both Night of the Demon (UK version) and Curse of the Demon (US version - 13 minutes hacked out). Both movies are letterboxed. The image quality is great. There were a few points where it seemed the audio might be slighted distorted, but I'm not sure if it would be noticeable to the average viewer. It's not distracting. Something you'd have to be listening for.
The close-ups of the Demon are great considering that this movie was made in 1957. The wide shots are not as impressive.
The version of Curse of the Demon on this DVD is not as complete as the version that has been on AMC. The version AMC aired was closer to the UK version - with only a few minutes missing and the ""Curse"" titles at the beginning. I do prefer the UK version and would recommend skipping Curse of the Demon unless you just want to compare how the versions were edited. Just select Night of the Demon to see the complete, unedited version. I wouldn't call it a Director's Cut since he would want to cut all shots of the Demon from most of the film.
I did find one little quirk with this DVD. Once you select a version, you're locked into it until you stop the DVD. Each movie has its own menu. Once you select a movie from the first menu, you are stuck on that movie's menu with no way to back out to that first menu. If your DVD player remembers where you left off when you hit Stop like mine does, you'll have to clear that memory to switch movies. With my player, I just hit Stop an additional time, and that makes the player go back to the beginning of the DVD when I hit Play.
The two trailers are for Fright Night and The Bride.
I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys older horror movies and/or movies based on the supernatural. This is a personal favorite.",1029456000,29,2621,4.4625

Getting tired of years of ridicule, he found it for rent as a Laser Disc and brought it home.  I loved every minute of it, and plan on buying this DVD as soon as it it released.  Even though it has nothing to do with H.P. Lovecraft, Curse of the Demon managed to capture the feel of his stories better than any adaptation I've seen.  Re-Animator?  It's fun, sure, but nothing like the story.  Unnameable?  A bad, two-hour adaptation of a decent two-page story.  The Dunwich Horror?  I despised the Dean Stockwell version where the horror of the Outer Gods was reduced to acid tripping hippies.  Curse of the Demon?  Near perfect.  I understand the audiences' need to see the monster at least once, but if Lovecraft had written it, we would have heard the screaming, seen the shadows, and mentally dwelt on the dreadful claw marks on the corpse--listening to them declare the victim hit by a train, while knowing that a train could never do that to a person.  I also thought this was much better than the same director's Cat People (which was wonderful).",1025395200,2,1145,4.473429951690822
615017,4,6303257429,"I've always had a soft spot for 50s/60s Brit shockers that didn't come from Hammer: this is among the best of 'em. As fog-haunted and spectrally lit as the bulk of DEMON is, its most unnerving scare comes in broad daylight: Karswell's garden party being interrupted by a momentary tornado. When a horror movie can rattle you in natural light, somebody's doing something right!
Another good omen is a film where the villain is hands-down the most engaging and interesting character. I don't mean to invoke creaky truisms about the Appeal Of Evil with that remark, either: Niall McGinnis hardly seems villainous at all here - he's cautious and canny, of course (as anyone who can conjure up fifty-foot demons must of necessity be) but otherwise a jovial, good-natured and charming fellow one wouldn't mind playing a game of chess with (no side-bets, though!). And compared to dour dipso Dana Andrews - the stone-faced 'hero' - he looks that much better besides. Andrews by this point was well on his way to pissing away his career via alcoholism. The sad thing is you can clearly see it in his late 50s/60s performances. (At least here, he mostly seems hung over...which works to the role's advantage. Check out WHILE THE CITY SLEEPS from 56 when he was REALLY in his cups. He damn near staggers through that entire picture!)
Given his decided lack of charm & warmth as Holden [and compounded by the character being written as a skeptic so uberskeptical he seems at first simply boorish, and by the film's climax, a complete knucklehead]  I do think DEMON could have been a lot more satisfying had the Andrews character learned too late the truth of the situation by being torn limb from limb by the titular beastie. It would've added a satisfying closing-the-circle frisson to the tale while essentially sending the same message to the audience: mess with the Devil and you get the horns. The payoff  Tourneur does give you is a bit of a cheat, as Karswell gets 'lawyered' into his demise, so to speak, whereas Andrews' Holden emerges from his near-fatal ordeal having learned nothing from the experience - not even the literal truth of Leo Durocer's maxim that God watches over fools, drunks and third basemen. His last line, ""Maybe it's better not to know"", kinda says it all.
Oh, and for the record, I'm not as aesthetically offended by the visualization of the demon as some other Amazon scribes are, having seen that spiky-headed, big-nostrilled bad boy on a FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND cover as a lad & thinking surely this was the coolest monster ever. Could've done without some of the sound effects, though - particularly the sound of wheels squeaking throughout the Demon's two scenes. Most likely these were unintentional, but I keep 'seeing' two crewmembers lugging him forward on a dolly every time I hear it.",1024963200,7,2821,4.8264462809917354
615018,4,6303257429,"Jacques Tourneur also directed the original 1942 _Cat People_ starring Simone Simon as well as _I Walked With A Zombie_. Tourneur makes wonderful use of the shadows and anything hidden. He knows how to move the story along without too much fluff to distract you.
All of the cast give wonderful performances especially Niall MacGinnis who plays Dr. Karswell. Dr. Holden is heading to a convention in the UK to discuss the supernatural - which he doesn't believe in. When he arrives, he discovers that a colleague had died. The colleague was going to expose Dr. Karswell's religious group. However, Karswell doesn't like the idea of he and his followers being exposed to the public.
The sance scene is the only part I didn't care for. It seemed a little too merry at first for this type of movie. It seemed like the psychic involved was being indirectly made fun of. That may not have been the intention. In a way, the scene might have been used to break the tension a little except for when the last spirit spoke which was the serious moment and primary reason for the scene.
The director originally had the demon hidden in the first few scenes, but the studio forced him to reveal it immediately. ...according to comments from AMC's airing of the movie. Once again you can blame a studio for meddling in a director's work.
_Curse of the Demon_ is very loosely based on the short story ""Casting the Runes"" by M.R. James. Mainly just a few concepts and names were used. The entire process of using the runes appears to be the same in both the movie and the original story. Karswell and Harrington are the only names in both so you can imagine how much was changed. The story was written in 1911 so things were updated for the movie.

(no doubt not your typical feline.) in the most outstanding scene, one of the best ever filmed in the horror genre, a former member of karswell's cult snaps out of a catatonic trance and jumps out of a high rise window when the lead whoever he is and a doctor tell him that it is ""the night of the demon"". it is so jolting that it produces a physical reaction in the viewer. this movie is a must.",1017014400,,1280,4.517241379310345

I'd like to thank the other Amazon reviewers for some very sound advice.  It's a terrific film.  An older Dana Andrews is in England investigating the paranormal and the occult when he gets mixed up with a cult leader who tells him he will be killed by a demon on a particular day, a day which is three days away.  Despite mounting evidence, Andrews doesn't believe him, although we the audience are convinced very early on.  But will Andrews see the light before it's too late, and could he do anything about it anyways?  The film has a creepy quality to it, not only because of the frankly presented subject matter, but also because of the darkly lit black and white photography.  There's nothing like b&w to really add atmosphere in a story like this one.  The performances are all good, especially the villain, played by Niall MacGinnis in a quietly threatening way.  Highlights for me were the children's party, the hypnosis scene, and the climax.  The mood and tension builds as the film progresses, and remains strong to the very end.  I guess I should put in my two cents about the demon's appearances.  I think it worked well at the end, but I would not have shown it at the beginning, instead hainvg the smoke and the sound of it without a visual image.

Make no mistake: although the production is black-and-white and the screenplay is sometimes under-stated (effectively!), this is a film that will be immensely pleasing to anyone who has interests in fantasy, science fiction, Druids, or the supernatural. Be sure to pay close attention to the final conversation -- it nicely indicates our relationship to such a reality!",1000771200,3,683,4.896551724137931

Based on a wonderful story by the master M.R.James. The plot itself is absoutely perfect, although the movie itself shows a low production budget (such as the hero fighting an obvious stuffed panther). In spite of that, the direction is fantastic. Whether or not the Demon should have been shown is a controversy, but I think it's better that it was even if it looks hokey.",998524800,2,514,4.65934065934066
615065,5,6303257429,"There is really only one thing significantly wrong with the 1957 horror classic ""Curse of the Demon"" is that the producer insisted the ""demon"" had to make its appearance at the beginning and ending of the film.  The better move would have been to leave the appearance of the monster up to the audience's imagination as director Jacques Tourneur intended, but you know producers.  Still, ""Curse of the Demon"" (originally released in England as ""Night of the Demon"") is a great horror film.  The film is based on ""Casting the Runes"" by M. R. James, with a literate screenplay by Charles Bennett and Hal E. Chester.  The story deals with a curse cast by an evil magician, supposedly based on the self-proclaimed English sorcerer Aleister Crowley.  The tone for the film is amply established in the opening sequence where a terrified Professor Harrington (Maurice Dehnam) comes to the home of Dr. Julian Karswell (Niall MacGinnis).  Harrington the scientist had led an expose of Karswell's devil cult and made the mistake of telling the sorcerer ""Do your worst.""  Now he wants Karswell to call off the demon, but, of course, it is way too late for that now.
The protagonist in this story is Dr. John Holden (Dana Andrews), a noted American psychologist who comes to England to help with the investigation of the cult.  Holden does not believe in the occult, but then Karswell slips him a parchment marked with runes and learns the rules of our little game: whoever holds the parchment will die on an appointed day UNLESS they can pass it on to a WILLING recipient.  Sounds like big time fun, right?  Holden tries to hold on to his skepticism, but in due course he becomes a true believer.  Allied with Joanna Harrington (Peggy Cummins), daughter of the late professor and Holden's obvious romantic interest in the film, the pair try to turn the tables on Karswell.
The star of this film is Karswell as portrayed by Niall MacGinnis, who manages to give nice shadings to his villain.  When Holden first meets the man trying to kill him at Lufford Hall, Karswell is dressed up as Dr. Bobo the Magnificent entertaining the local orphans.  He even gives Holden a chance to recant his disbelief and when the psychologist becomes even more insulting Karswell summons a cyclone to take the American down a peg.  One of the best sequences involves Holden breaking into Lufford Hall only to be attacked by the wizard's demon familiar.  Andrews manages the passage from disbelief to understanding and horror adequately, but Karswell steals every scene.  Even with the cheesy monster, ""Curse of the Demon"" is a classic horror film featuring a first rate script, solid performances, and artful direction.  This may well be the proverbial best horror film you never heard of.",990576000,60,2757,4.844349680170576
615066,5,6303257429,"Jacques Tourneur's ""Curse of the Demon"" is one of the all-time classics of fantasy film, comparable in its way to Jean Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast"" and  Steven Spielberg's ""E.T"" (different as the colors undeniably are). As the evil warlock Karswell, Niall MacGinniss does exactly what performers who play supernatural figures almost never do -- he persuades you of his reality by the force of absolute conviction, expressed by understated acting (rather than by the scenery-chewing excesses that stupid thespians think they are entitled to engage in because ""it's only a fantasy."" Anyone who saw Gary Oldman in the early scenes of Coppola's ""Dracula"" will know exactly what I mean). When Karswell says to Dana Andrews: ""She [Andrews'girlfriend] thinks that she's alive; she is. She thinks that she can reason; she can. She thinks that you're going to die tomorrow night at 10 o'clock; you will"" -- by God, you believe him. Among the uniformally excellent cast, Athene Seyler, as Karswell's increasingly anguished mother, and all of the actors who play the members of the devil-worshipping farm family deserve special commendation. When the matriarch of this decidedly odd clan says, in an absolutely even voice, ""I am not concerned with his [her dead son's] guilt or want of guilt"", and then, a moment later, when Andrews shows the telltale parchment that marks him for death, points at him and says ""He has been chosen! Let no man raise his hand to defend him!"", your blood temperature should be around 10 degrees below zero. This, by the way, underscores the main reason why intelligent film viewers love this movie: all of its key moments are based on a combination of superior writing and first-rate acting, and not on a wearisome array of special effects that inevitably remind one of a pack of bratty children trying to get one's attention at the end of a long day on the job. (Art thou listening, makers of the ""Mummy"" franchise?) Unfortunately, in the Hollywood of today, it's easier to sink Atlantis or to show a desert's sands coalescing into a gigantic face than it is to write a good scene. If there really were warlocks like Karswell, they could probably get the world's moviegoers to sign their souls over to Beelzebub in a New York minute, as long as they promised to conjure up a few more scripts and casts as good as this one.",988934400,6,2347,4.85286783042394

615068,4,6303257429,"Jacques Tourneur's ""Curse of the Demon"" (1958) is a worthy companion piece to the director's ""Cat People"" (1942) and ""I Walked With a Zombie"" (1943). Rich in atmosphere and characterization, this British chiller remains among the best of the genre. The Demon's brief appearance was inserted by the producers against Tourneur's wishes, yet it succeeds as a terrifying image. For years, we have been stuck with the 83-minute American version, which was 12 minutes shorter than the British release. However, the video reissue of ""Curse of the Demon"" now features the original 95-minute print  a wonderful surprise, since Columbia did not mention this upgrade in its VHS packaging. The result is a must-own for horror buffs.",980640000,12,720,5.206896551724138
615069,4,6303257429,"Director Jacques Tourneur put together a horror film that scares you without showing you a whole lot.  Instead of blood and gore, Tourneur builds incredible tension and suspense from the very first moments.  Dana Andrews plays a skeptical scientist who journeys to England on a mission to debunk the belief in the Devil and the supernatural.  Instead he butts heads with a wildly bizarre cult leader that puts a curse on him.  With the help of a young woman, who believes her uncle was killed by the cult leader's curse, Andrews fights to stay alive.  Don't expect razzle dazzle special effects, but do expect a few good scares from this well constructed horror/suspense.  To tell more would give away too much of the plot, but the tension builds from the picture's midpoint right to the end; it just doesn't let up.  Much like Hitchcock, Tourneur creates real terror by setting a mood.  We are terrified because the characters are, not because we see heads and limbs chopped off.  Suspense and horror buffs will find this film quite enjoyable.",977184000,3,1044,4.820224719101123
615110,5,6303257429,"What a discovery this film has been for me! A smart, tightly woven plot centering on the investigation of a Satanist's quest for revenge against doubters and his detractors, is at the core of this timeless B&W film. The only thing dated about this work is that the suspense and thrills are built up with subtlety and smarts and not by a senseless exhibition of gore and violence, although we do start the film with a rather jolting scene that will leave the viewer gaping. Good acting, intensely moody scenes, and terrific special effects (far better than today's CGI) drive this movie to its stunning conclusion.
I see here, on this page, some discussion regarding the effects and the appearance of the Demon, and have to say that unless you're looking for glossy, high tech critters, I'm certain any serious fan of horror will be more than pleased with what he or she gets in this film (please don't harp too long on the rubber demon. it's not really worth it when put within the context of the entire film. plus... it ain't really all that bad). We do still, in fact, see some of the effects highlighted in ""Curse of the Demon"" being used in today's cinema.
This movie has made it into my top 10 and gets 4.5 stars from me.",970704000,7,1226,4.502242152466367
615111,5,6303257429,"I love Jacques Tourneur and ""Curse of the Demon"" is one of my favorites.  Tourneur directed B films, worked within a restrictive system,  and had to deal with measly budgets.  And yet he created some of the finest  movie gems out there, films that are much more creative and substantial  than the ""A"" features I'm sure they played with.
""Curse of  the Demon"", which I saw again on AMC the other night, begins with  these words: ""It has been written since the beginning of time, even  unto these ancient stones, that evil, supernatural creatures exist in a  world of darkness.  And it is also said man, using the magic power of the  ancient runic symbols, can call forth these powers of darkness - the demons  of hell.""  This is strong stuff, accompanied by a terrific music score  and Tourneur plunges us right in the story.
Professor Harrington has  come to believe that the person he is investigating, Karswell (well played  by Niall MacGinnis) is not the charlatan he has promised to expose at an  upcoming convention of the supernatural, but the real deal.  He rushes to  his palatial country house (which has been paid for by his followers), and  begs him to ""call it off"".  Harrington apparently had involved  Karswell in a public scandal and had taunted him to ""do your  worst"" - a big mistake.  Karswell, using the power of the runic  symbols, did precisely that and now Harrington is extremely sorry.  Unfortunately, ""some things are more easily started than stopped""  and Karswell tells Harrington he will do what he can (which is nothing).  Harrington drives off only to be attacked and killed by the demon Karswell  called forth.
Dr. John Holden (Dana Andrews) soon arrives to follow up  on Professor Harrington's work.  He is even more skeptical than Harrington,  and states that demonology and witchcraft has been discredited since the  Middle Ages; he's written a book on the subject.  Holden meets up with  Harrington's niece (Peggy Cummins) who isn't so sure and feels he may be in  danger.
What I really like about ""Curse of the Demon"" is how  the characters debate the supernatural.  Dr. Holden likes to say that all  good scientists are from Missouri (the ""show me"" state).  He  believes in logic and science, but we know right away that science won't  help when chemical analysis of a calling card that Karswell gives him (with  mysterious disappearing ink) turns up nothing.  A distinction is made  between Eastern and Western beliefs.  When Holden asks the Indian, Dr.  Kumar, if he believes this stuff, without a beat Kumar says he does -  absolutely.
""Curse of the Demon"" is well written by Charles  Burnett (who wrote a couple of Hitchcock films and received an Academy  Award nomination for ""Foreign Correspondent""), based on a  scholarly story by M.R. James (or so I'm told, I've never read James).
The film looks great.  And the direction is subtle and artful; Tourneur  has never received the acclaim he is due.  He has, however, been ripped off  from the likes of lesser directors like Paul Schrader.",965865600,3,3031,4.814453125

My teenage kids still jump when certain parts are shown, even though they  have watched it as much as I have. This makes the movie one of the classic  suspenseful thrillers from the '50's. Dana Andrews is one of my favorite  old time actors and he doesn't disappoint in this one. I really don't care  what the critics say about this movie. It is entertaining, suspensful, and  in my opinion very well acted. The special effects are secondary to the  story line and the characters.

615114,5,6303257429,"I rented this movie one night based on a great multitude of great reviews it had received online.  As I popped the tape in my VCR, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Imagine my surprise as I began to watch one of the single greatest horror/suspense films ever made.  Everything in this film works, including the ""controversial"" appearance of the demon at the  beginning and end of the film.  The performances are quite noteworthy,  especially that of the actor who portrayed Karswell.  Niall MacGinnis does  a great job in humanizing his character and makes sure that Karswell is  leaps and bounds beyond the average evil villain in most horror films.  Probably my favorite aspect is the fact the film has a film noir quality to  it, which suits it fine, since it is a cross between a detective film and a  supernatural thriller.  It's one of the few films I've seen recently that  has made me yell at the characters when they do things  that may be  understandable, however they are a bit on the unintelligent side.  By the way, if you are a fan of  this movie, be sure to check out Hammer's The Devil Rides Out, recently  released in a widescreen edition by Anchor Bay Entertainment.  It contains  a similar occult theme, as well as the same level of sheer intensity.  Oh,  and I don't want to forget the fact that it stars Christopher Lee, is  directed by Terence Fisher, and has a screenplay written by Richard  Matheson (based on Dennis Wheatley's novel).",957225600,63,1456,4.6156862745098035

Dana Andrews portrays Prof. John Holden, who travels to England to attend a parapsychology symposium and to expose a devil-worship group led by Dr. Julian Karswell ( played by Niall MacGinnis, who also played Zeus in Jason and the Argonauts). Dr. Karswell tries unsuccessfully to get Prof. Holden to desist, and subsequently invokes an ancient curse on Holden, where in two weeks time he will meet a horrible death at the hands of a terrible fire demon. Fear of the unknown is the central theme of the film, and is skillfully employed by director Jacques Tourneur. Tourneur masterfully builds upon Holden's impending doom throughout the film, and Holden's skepticism slowly turns to anxiety over his fate. The film is well-written and well-acted by Andrews and MacGinnis primarily and leaves the viewer with a sense of terror.
