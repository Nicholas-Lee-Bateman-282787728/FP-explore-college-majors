For $20 plus these days you can get a whole season of other TOP shows.

Even Season 1 had all the episodes for this price.

What gives?

I would only buy it if I was on the show, but otherwise for 1 show, NO WAY !!!",1199836800,10,259,3.5714285714285716
2815983,1,B000PC72JA,"Elsewhere on Amazon they have a 3 disc collection of Dirty Jobs, 494 minutes, for $17.

This one seems to be one disc, one episode, for $22. It is significant that they do not have the number of discs or running time like they do with 98% of the DVD's Amazon sells. I assume it was the manufacturer and not Amazon that left it off, because Amazon seems concerned with customer satisfaction.

My wife likes the show and I would like to buy an entire season, like any other tv show on DVD, for a reasonable price. If I somehow bought this one by accident I would be furious.",1195084800,14,572,4.238532110091743

And Mike Rowe has one of the best chests i have seen on a man. He isn't big and bulky like a body builder. He is just nicely muscled so he can do the jobs he is doing on tv.

This show is awesome!  I love every bit of it.  The jobs are real, the dirt is real, the jokes are corny, and sometimes brilliant.

Mike Rowe is a genius, and the people who film this show are so dedicated that he has to mention them from time to time.

2816062,3,B000PC72JA,"First off let me say that the only reason I am giving this product 3 stars instead of 5 is because it is not all of Season 2.  Dirty jobs is a fabulous show, and the episodes contained in this package are wonderful, five star material.  However, for some reason a large chunk of Season 2 is missing - at least 9 episodes (about 30 jobs) are not included in this collection, nor are they available anywhere on disc (boo Discovery!).  So, if you are as big a fan as I am and are looking for the following episodes, you will unfortunately not find them here:

Cheesemaker
Avian Vomitologist
Turkey Farmer
Alligator Farmer
Mushroom Farmer

2816066,5,B000PC72JA,"""Dirty Jobs"" is one of the most compelling shows on television. It's not the funniest, it's not the most dramatic, and it doesn't have the biggest budget, but it is the most down to earth. Affable host Mike Rowe does always dirty, occasionally disgusting, and sometimes completely terrifying jobs around the US, and in the process brings his audience to a greater appreciation of the toils and travails their fellow citizens endure to make civilized society work.

Season two is one of the best to date, with some of the most original and unspeakable jobs. While many are merely dirty (""Runway Painter,"" ""Reef Ball Maker,"" etc.) some are terrifying to people with certain phobias, while Mike seems free from all fear. For me the single most terrifying episode is ""Bridge Painter"" which combines the worst that claustrophobia (fear of confined spaces) and acrophobia (fear of heights) have to offer. I am not especially prone to either disorder, but one look at that episode made me better understand my limitations. Other episodes of note in the collection are ""Snake Researcher,"" a job that is among the most distasteful imaginable, ""Steam Ship Cleaner,"" which is much, much dirtier than it sounds, and ""Vomit Island Workers,"" which demonstrates some of the most unsavory aspects of working with nature.

Despite temporary employ in these unsavory jobs, Mike never takes himself or the situation too seriously, and never condescends to the workers who genuinely make their livelihoods performing these jobs. He is smart, funny, and always entertaining. It's unusual that you can get so much knowledge, dirt, and fun in a single show, but Mike Rowe and company make it look effortless. There is never a dull moment in this DVD set, and I recommend it highly.",1240963200,3,1758,5.017123287671233
2816067,5,B000PC72JA,"Our young son, and me and my husband love these videos. Mr. Rowe is one of the gutsiest guys out there, and original in his dirty jobs that he takes on. Great, great shows.",1235174400,,172,4.088235294117647
