1479025,5,B00005JM3G,"I won't go on and on about how wonderful a show King of the Hill is.  If you've seen it, you know.  I just love Fox Sunday evenings, with KOTH and Simpsons back to back!  (Malcolm in the Middle is good too, but I'll miss Futurama!)  Anyway, I was really pleased with this set because not only do I get all the hysterical shows from the first season, but the extras are great too.
Each episode has some short deleted scenes, which are fun to watch.  It's interesting to see the scenes and think about how the tone of a scene would have changed completely if these little bits had been left in.  Also, the commentaries are well above average.  There's other fun stuff, too, like a Barenaked Ladies video.  And the packaging is really attractive too!  Each disc comes in it's own little case, and the three cases fit inside the slip cover...I like this better than the usual ""fold-out"" style of box sets, like the Simpsons sets.
So if you're a fan of the show, the bonus materials alone are nearly worth the price.  Truly one of my favorite boxed sets!!  BUY IT!!!",1062979200,2,1061,4.38974358974359
1479026,4,B00005JM3G,"Since I agree with the majority of the reviews here,I'll keep my praise short and sweet. I think KOTH is a great show,and so I bought this dvd collection as soon as I laid my eyes on it. Any fan of KOTH or Mike Judge for that matter,will love this set. There are also alot more extras in this dvd set,than with the Futurama set. For instance intros on the dvds by Hank,Bobby,and Dale. Interviews and commentaries by the diffrent voice actors was also great. Man,the lady that does the voice of Luanne is a hottie! Erhmm... well the do's and don'ts list of drawing the Hills was interesting and makes you realize how much detail really goes into animation.
The only reason why I give 4 stars,is because it would have been nice to have 2 or 3 full seasons...I would have even paid alot more to have more KOTH.13 episodes just doesn't seem like all that much esp. after watching the Family Guy dvd set. Still though this is a great set,and I look forward to buying future installments.",1060041600,2,982,4.430939226519337
1479027,5,B00005JM3G,"I purchased this DVD a couple of days ago, and have watched it multiple times.  Season 1 piles the humor on thick and deep.  You get 13 wonderful episodes, including the pilot, which is probably the best overall show fox has ever aired.  Hank is suspected of child abuse when Bobby gets a black eye, and a social worker from L.A. comes around causing trouble.  The 1st episode is GREAT, GREAT, GREAT.  The extra features are nothing to scream about, but they are servicable.  Don't purchase this DVD for the features; it pays for itself with including the pilot episode.  Lots of great one-liners are littered throughout the episodes...
""That boy ain't right.""
Enjoy!!!!!!",1059004800,,672,4.842105263157895
1479028,5,B00005JM3G,"The first season of KING OF THE HILL introduced us to an endearing Texas family helmed by the always well-meaning if narrow Hank Hill.  He's a good ole boy who wishes the world would stop to smell the propane every now and then.  Too bad he's constantly undermined by his sassy big-footed Spanish-mangling wife, shinless and cranky veteran father, his wig head kissing son, and LuAnne who has come to live with the brood from a broken home until she gets her beauty license or finds a decent boyfriend.
Living in Texas I felt like I knew these people as neighbors.  The ingenuity of this series stems from being an animated reality show where nothing happens too fast.  THE SIMPSONS may be yellow satirists living in fast-moving fictional Springfield (what STATE?), but here are their flesh-colored ironic slow-paced counterparts who seem to be living in the all too real Arlen...TEXAS!  Comparing the two seems unfair.  Apart from the obvious animation and on FOX there is not much the two have in common.  The tones are completely different.  And despite tackling sex education, child abuse, adultery, and many other touchy subjects ... everything is handled in a very family friendly way.  The characters are so pure-hearted and always mean well!
The DVD set is a 3 disc affair with great presentation and extras.  You get a half hour documentary on the origins (which shows each voice cast member much to your surprise!).  Then there are commentaries with creators, producers, and SURPRISE - the characters themselves.  You couldn't ask for a slicker package!  This is one to own.
Yep .... yep ..... yep .... (yep)!",1058745600,,1619,4.886446886446887
1479029,5,B00005JM3G,"This DVD set is the first I have ever purchased and I was pleasantly surprised at all the extra goodies that come with the very humorous and well done 13 episodes of the first season.  Judging from other reviews I've read, I probably will not find as many extras on other DVD sets.  Each disc is extremely easy to navigate, which is a big benefit to me because I had never operated a DVD player before.  The extras include promos, deleted and extended scenes (some with just sketches and audio), the Making of King of the Hill with the creators, voices, and animators, a Barenaked Ladies music video starring Dale Gribble, and commentaries on selected episodes by co-creator Greg Daniels, director Klay Hall, and some of the characters.  The commentaries I found to be a little boring and not well rehearsed.  The best commentary was of the episode ""Shins of the Father"" by Peggy and Bobby Hill.  The voice of Peggy does an excellent job bringing her character's personality into the commentary with very funny results.  The commentary of ""Westie Side Story"" by Dale and Bill is also very good.  The characters seem all too real.  Another interesting extra is the ""Do's and Don't's"" list used by the animators for drawing the characters correctly.  Every detail is scrutinized including the eye movements, finger placement, the proper color to use when liquid spills on clothing, what should be seen through windows, Dale's cigarette positioning, etc.  Much time and care is taken into this program to make it as realistic as possible, and it definitely shows in this DVD set. And, of course, the episodes are great including my favorite ""Hank's Unmentionable Problem.""  This series had it right from the beginning.  Hank, himself, would be proud of this set, ""I tell you what.""",1057795200,14,1778,4.867109634551495
1479030,5,B00005JM3G,"While I have the DVD, I have yet to be able to watch it yet, so my commentary will here will be reserved for the episodes themselves.
If you already love King of the Hill, then I probably don't need to go over why this series is so great, but for the uninitiated, or those on the fence, I will try to explain what makes one of the, if not the most, well made and writen show on television today.
Unlike the souless ""Family Guy"" and the Simpsons of today, King of the Hill is more about characterization and subtle humor than anything else.  There may not be as may laugh out loud moments, but thats not what its shooting for.  The humor is not nearly as contemporary or absurdist as the previously mentioned shows either.
The characters of KOH are not vehicles for running gags, but rather they are they gags themselves.  In this way the show is a lot like the greatest sitcom ever, Seinfeld, in that what is happening may not be inherently funny, but it is funny because it is happening to characters we are familiar with and have developed an understanding of.
There is a also lot of commentary in the series about normality, middle class America, and relationships between fathers and sons.  In a nutshell, the show is about Hank's trying to achieve American ""normalness"" with every fiber of his being, his son Bobby's constant attempts to be anything but, and his wife Peggy's seemingly unending quest to prove herself better than everyone at most everything.  Few shows have ever touched upon these subjects as poignantly as KOH, and few have developed such an effective characterization of its main ""actors"" as well.
Unlike most other sitcoms, the characters in KOH are not caricatures (save perhaps one or two), but rather are at times complex and flawed.  In short they are very human, despite the animated medium.
Provided you are willing to give the series time to grow on you, and are not looking for rapid-fire thoughtless humor that will seem outdated in two years, then you should not be dissapointed in King of the Hill.
As far as animated series goes, I'd rank KOH slightly below the peak earlier years of the Simpsons, slightly above Futurama, and light years ahead of Family Guy and, sadly, most of the current Simpsons episodes.  Luckily for us KOH still does not seem to have started the downward spiral of most long running shows, lets just hope it stays that way.",1057795200,5,2385,4.624113475177305
1479031,5,B00005JM3G,"Taking place in a far more realistic universe than The Simpsons or the wild, out-of-control Family Guy this show is a little bit more mature and refined. The humor is more grown-up and characters more dense.
King of the Hill is way past cool from the very first episode and I am so happy that the first season has been released on DVD. I had no hesitations in buying it right away. It's well worth the money and I eagerly await Season 2 (please make it soon).
The extras are pretty cool, with commentaries on certain episodes, loads of funny deleted scenes, a pretty good documentary and a music video. We really couldn't have asked for a better start to King of the Hill on DVD. Bring on the rest!",1057449600,6,698,4.376923076923077
1479032,5,B00005JM3G,"The phrase you most often hear in connection with KING OF THE HILL is ""It grows on you."" When it first appeared, a lot of people (including me) were surprised that it wasn't as outrageous as co-creator Mike Judge's ""Beavis and Butthead"" or as fast-paced as ""The Simpsons"" (which co-creator Greg Daniels used to work for). But once you get used to the characters and get to know their quirks, it becomes clear that KotH is one of the best sitcoms on TV: funny, surprisingly touching, and with a great cast of characters.
The first season of 13 episodes is a great introduction to the show. The character designs and voices aren't quite as polished as they would become, but the actual animation is probably the most visually imaginative in the show's run, and in terms of storytelling and characterization the show hit its stride right away. Some of the best episodes are ""Plastic White Female,"" still one of the best episodes about Hank Hill (Mike Judge) and his son Bobby (Pamela Segall); ""Shins of the Father,"" which demonstrates the strength of character of Peggy (Kathy Najimy); and ""Luanne's Saga,"" about Hank's relationship with his niece Luanne Platter (the show lost a lot in season six when Luanne started to be absent from most episodes).  And the first season offered some of the show's most memorable comedy moments, like the botched threatening phone call from neighbor Dale Gribble (Johnny Hardwick), the first entrance of Dale's ""son"" Joseph (Brittany Murphy) and Hank's first meeting with obnoxious neighbor Kahn (Toby Huss).
The 3 disc set will include a ton of extras.  There are audio commentaries on eight episodes: Two by co-creator Greg Daniels, two by director Klay Hall, and four in-character commentaries by some of the voice actors.  There's a new half-hour ""making-of"" documentary.  There are examples of early design sketches and basic animation poses for the main characters.  And best of all, there are deleted scenes from all the episodes (including the alternate ending to ""The Company Man"").  And who can resist the chance to hear Peggy dubbed in fluent Spanish? Buy with confidence, and hope that Fox releases the rest of this excellent series.",1056412800,54,2178,4.96978021978022

I've always loved King of the Hill, so when I cancelled my cable TV, I no longer had the chance to watch it.

1479520,3,B00005JM3G,Well I am 16 and I love King of the hill this is my second time I have ordered from Amazon and well I was excited to get home from school because I had seen that it had gotten delivered so When I got home I got it from the mailbox and went back inside and started to open it and I heard something rattling in the box so I was thinking maybe it's just the plastic thing that has a disc on each side so I opened up the box and took the big air bubble things that it came with out and picked up the first season and I heard the rattling come from that case so I opened it carefully thinking by now maybe it was a disc that came off its holder and when I got it open guess what there it is the second disc of the first season had came off its holder and had been sliding around and the third disc also has a straight line scratch on the outside of the disc and on the fifth seasons case the part where u put you fingers to open it there was a little piece of plastic broken off but other than that the fifth and second seasons came okay but now my parents got to take me up to vintage stock so i can get a couple of discs cleaned.,1453939200,,1126,3.7552742616033754

They all have some depth and their own quirks that make you love each one in their own way. If you haven't seen King of the Hill, then you better get started.",1445904000,,490,4.010204081632653

The first and second episodes played great, then it sent me back to the main menu because no more episodes would play, checked the next 2 discs and to my dismay only the first episode on each disc would play. So that was pretty disappointing, but Amazon does have a great return/refund policy so I took full advantage of it and opted for a replacement to try my luck with. So in summary if you're willing to take a chance and you're a fan, give it a shot! (Maybe your lucks better than mine)",1426464000,,665,4.285714285714286

1479752,5,B00005JM3G,"King of the Hill is extremely funny, because it's humor is subtle. Texas is not part of the south, but a person doesn't have to be from the Southeastern portion of America to be a redneck; however, it certainly does help. If, you're a true Southerner, then you'll know in an instant that Hank Hill, family, friends and foes aren't true rednecks. They're rednecks in the same sense Hank's wife, Peggy, is a Spanish teacher; however, this is a very well written and produced show that borrows all things Redneck without insulting Texans or true Southerners. The show has been on for years and years, so I doubt, I'll be telling anyone anything new. I own every season of King of the Hill. I wish, they'd do a 90-120 movie, as sort of the crowning jewel to the show. In my opinion, you cannot go wrong buying any season of this show.",1420329600,,830,4.467105263157895

1479848,5,B00005JM3G,"Get this. You'll never regret it.

While there are wonderful episodes in each of the 13 seasons, this is easily the best. King of the Hill never got better or more consistent than it was here.

Here, apart from a few silly, weak endings (always an issue), it was as funny, sweet, brisk, lively as a new puppy and dang near perfect. The characters and situations were believable, the scripts universally creative, richly funny and touching, the art and animation choices daring and complex, the music spot-on. The show had personality to spare. The writers hadn't yet sent characters like Bill and Luanne to comic extremes of stupidity or turned Peggy bi-polar and, daringly, they allowed Hank to get angry and in interesting ways that showed the depths of his character.

Season 2's a different show. Not a bad show. (Quite a good one in fact.) It's just different -- more conventional and stylized and bit weaker at its core.

There's simply nothing like Season One.",1404432000,,967,4.807228915662651

1480030,5,B00005JM3G,"Having lived in Texas for some years, this show was a great comfort to me when I had to move out of the state. I can vouch for the humor and characterizations you see in these episodes - some of it isn't so far from reality. The show is sometimes just this side of ribald, but almost never in poor taste. As far as humor is concerned, there's a good balance of characters, from the uptight ""Boy Scout"" Hank to the paranoid Dale to the puzzling Boomhauer. Bill is sometimes over-the-top fatuous, but he's such a gentle soul that you don't really mind his slobbish antics. Bobby's kind-hearted obliviousness to life is a sweet counterbalance to Hank's occasional tirades. This show had quite a lot of guest voices over the years, but they rarely felt like a forced presence, and the temporary characters were usually strategic and appropriate to the plot.

Like many other reviews have said, adults will get a chuckle out of this show, but preteens and smart middle-schoolers will also enjoy it (although some ""Beavis & Butt-Head"" alums were also involved in this show, ""King of the Hill"" is pretty tame and actually holds up to multiple viewings).",1372118400,,1146,4.701492537313433

1480033,5,B00005JM3G,"I just started watching this show full time last week. I have caught a few episodes in the past but never got quite into it. I am not writing this review to convince anyone to watch it but rather to point out how good the show is. For me, the show resonates with me because the show's characters go living their day to day lives in a most funny way. The tone of the show is very serious, but I can't help laughing at every turn of the show. I am sure this show will offend many women (like my wife) but it's what makes the show funny. It speaks the truth about the difference between the sexes in our society; women are constantly being put down in the show but I feel like the creator pokes fun at the female audience so they can strive for more equality and now end up like the main character's wife.
I hope you really give this show a chance. I think it will take more than a few episodes for it to grow on you. But once it does, you won't be disappointed I promise.",1369785600,,969,4.025906735751295

1480118,4,B00005JM3G,"In 1997, Greg Daniels and Mike Judge the creator of Beavis and Butthead, debuted their new animated series King of the Hill (KOTH) on FOX.  Following the everyday life of a man named Hank Hill (voiced by Judge) and dealing with many real life issues, KOTH would become one the cool family based animated comedies from the 1990's.  Critically acclaimed and in tune with FOX, the series would eventually run for 13 seasons, producing 259 episodes.

Hank Hill lives in Arlen, Texas, with his wife Peggy (voiced by Kathy Najimy), his son Bobby (voiced by Pamela Segall), and his niece Luanne Platter (voiced by Brittany Murphy).  Hank is employed at Strictland Petroleum selling ""propane and propane accessories"".  Three of Hank's closest friends from high school are his neighbors, Jeff Boomhauer (also voiced by Mike Judge), Dale Dribble (voiced by Johnny Hardwick), and Bill Dauterive (voiced by Steven Root).

A midseason replacement, Season One contains just 13 episodes, most of which are very well written and uniquely quirky, as KOTH deals with subjects and situations on the domestic front, and also in the workplace.  In an era that saw the rise of political correctness, KOTH does not back away from controversy, exploring some offbeat subjects and edgy topics.  Living in Texas, holding generally conservative family values, health issues, and the propane business, are just some of the diverse factors that are in play.

KOTH jumps into the fire from the start, as in the pilot episode a completely innocent Hank is being investigated by a child protective agency, for possibly abusing his son.  Already suffering from a narrow urethra, Hank's constipation is explored in the hilarious episode ""Hank's Unmentionable Problem"".  In ""Keeping Up With Our Joneses"" 12-year old Bobby gets caught smoking, which eventually leads to his parents, both ex-smokers, taking up the habit again.  Hank's crusty father Cotton Hill (voiced by Toby Huss) is introduced in ""Shins Of The Father"".  Cotton's abrasive personality, prejudice, and lack of respect for women, is offensive, and becomes a bad influence on those he meets.  In ""Westie Side Story"", Hank and his friends are not sure how to react when a Laotian family moves into their neighborhood.  Luanne is training to be a beautician, and has no idea that Bobby is using her hairstyling model of a woman head, to practice his romantic techniques in ""Plastic White Female"".

While not everything works, and some may find the subject matter offensive, King of the Hill quickly developed an appreciative audience.  Taking a look at life in middle-America, and with its own particular vernacular, many found KOTH's point of view fresh and funny, kind of like a 90's version of The Beverly Hillbillies, and I tell you whut, that's not bad company at all.  The 13 subtitled episodes are on three discs, and contain some nice extras including lots of deleted scenes.",1322956800,5,2911,5.079831932773109

Truthfully there are some episodes that are not funny. If you haven't seen all the episodes give it another chance. I think this show is more dry humor than anything. Which is why i think some people don't get it.

Now when is FOX going to release seasons 7-12?",1306368000,,437,4.265060240963855

I believe that both shows are equally funny and of equally good quality,albeit in different ways. The thing I find funniest about this show is Hank's straight-laced conservatism in the face of the insanity around him as well as Peggy's well-meaning but usually misguided endeavors as a substitute teacher.

1480199,5,B00005JM3G,"I've been a fan of King of the Hill practically since it first aired on Fox. Quite apart from the voice acting, the stories are often hillariously funny, though unlike The Simpsons they don't resort to the same bizarre, out-of-this-world plots seen on Halloween shows.
  The first season is rather scanty with a mere twelve or thirteen episodes, but they're all well worth watching. In the pilot, Hank Hill, voiced by Mike Judge (and who sounds, incidentally, almost exactly like Tom Anderson from Beavis and Butthead except with a more robust voice), comes off as quick-tempered, even managing to find himself on the radar of an overzealous social worker determined to put Bobby, Hank's hapless son, into a better home.
  The adventures and misadventures don't stop at the pilot. Peggy's Sex Ed class, Peggy finds herself in the unlikely position of Sex Education teacher, much to Hank's chagrin. In Order of the Straight Arrow, the guys take the Boyscouts of Arlen on a disastrously ill-fated camping trip. Other highlights include Hank's got the Willies, in which Bobby inadvertently introduces the Hills to country great WIllie Nelson, Westy Side Story, which introduces us to Kahn and his wife Min and daughter, Kahn Junior, and let's not forget my personal favorite, Hank's Unmentionable Problem. And of course there are the classic moments of Hank catching Bobby smoking and deciding to punish him by making him smoke every cigarette in the carton and, in doing so, inadvertently addicting the entire family, all save Louanne and Ladybird, to Nicotine. Another classic is when Hank and Peggy catch Bobby practicing his kissing skills on a manequin head brought home from Louanne's beauty school.
  All in all, King of the Hill's first season is well worth watching. The extras on the DVD's, the commentary done by both showrunners, directors and some of the characters themselves (though it's not available on all episodes), is well worth taking a listen to. It's truly unfortunate that only the first two seasons feature any extras, but I still plan on owning at least the first six seasons, which are apparently the only ones currently available on DVD.",1255564800,,2162,5.042016806722689

It is kind of neat to see all the early animation, wow how they have come so far in 13 seasons, to back season 14 will be there last, FOX is cancleing them and replacing it with American Dad a show I would not let my Kids watch.",1225584000,,481,3.7254901960784315
1480201,5,B00005JM3G,"King of the Hill is one of the greatest animated adults cartoons for a number of reasons

One, the show's been around for YEARS now, and guess what?  The quality of the writing hasn't lost a step the entire time.  How many shows can we say THAT about?  Even South Park and the Simpsons, as much as I love those shows, hasn't been able to keep up the same kind of enjoyable consistency over the years.

Two, the storylines are so simple, and yet, THAT'S exactly what makes the show so appealing.  Just a Texas family that well, lives like Texans.  Nothing fancy, and there's a lot of realistic and accurate things in the show that gives King of the Hill a very family-oriented feel.  So in a way, it's also a childrens show (except they mention sexual content sometimes).

Third, over 200 episodes!  It's great when a good show gets to experience their full potential.  Over 200 episodes (and counting) should please anyone who likes the quality of the writing.

The only problem with Season One is the same problem ALL animated shows have- the animation doesn't look as polished as it would soon appear just a couple years later.  The writing is highly memorable anyway though, and that's the most important thing to remember.",1212105600,3,1226,4.62037037037037
1480202,5,B00005JM3G,"The DVD set about the Hill family who live in Arlen, Texas and their friends and relatives.  I didn't know that right off the bat that Hank Hill's father, Cotton Hill, was already a war veteran and verbally abusive. Of course, I love Peggy Hill who is the substitute teacher of the year and very proud of that. She tries too hard but always for the right reason. In the show, Peggy is the voice of reason and conscience. Then they are Hank's friends who gulp beer and talk on the street like Bill, the lonely divorcee, the guy who believes who aliens and conspiracies but refuses to acknowledge his wife's affair with John Redcorn, the Texas native, as anything more than business or that his son is not his but John Redcorn. Then there is Boomhower, the stud bachelor, who gets all the girls. Peggy and Hank Hill have one son, Bobby, because of Hank's narrow urethra. Peggy's niece, Luann, stays with them. Poor Luann, her mother is in prison and a father nowhere to be seen. It's not outrageous or too crazy to believe but I love this show because it has a lot of heart too.

I love the extra features and deleted scenes on every DVD. I enjoy the behind the scenes and the layouts of every character. This first season really does service. It was great to see the voices behind the characters especially Mike Judge as Hank and Dale; Kathy Najimy as Peggy; Pamela Adlon as Bobby; Brittany Murphy as Luann; Stephen Root as Bill; and others. The first season is short with only thirteen seasons and returned for a few more seasons before succumbing to cancelation.

1480205,5,B00005JM3G,"Even though King of the HIll is not as prominent as such animated shows as THe Simpsons and Family Guy. King of the HIll is still a gem of of primetime cartoon shows and this season started it all. Created by Mike Judge, the creator of Beavis and Butthead, this shows goes for subtler humor than B&B. The show is about Hank Hill a normal man reacting to strange world including his family, neighpbors, and town. The animation of this season is not as good as later season but the comedy is still there and funny to anyone reacting to a world that doesn't apply to their standard paradigm.",1155340800,3,588,4.4036697247706424
1480206,4,B00005JM3G,"The first season of ""King of the Hill"" is not the greatest season, but it was still very good in my opinion. I only consider one of the episodes in this DVD as one of the best ""King of the Hill"" episodes (The Pilot). Despite this, I found that most of the episodes found in this DVD were relatively entertaining and funny. The show itself is basically a satire the residents of Southern Texas, and one of the things that I found funny was that the characters are actually based on real people. I admit that some of the characters in this show are really annoying, specifically Peggy and Bobby, but disliking and disagreeing with a character is what makes a show fun to watch.

I also want to point out that people from foreign countries who aren't familiar with Texas can misunderstand this kind of humor. Another reason that some people don't like ""King of the Hill"" is because it uses smarter humor. This show does not rely on stupidity to be funny, like many other comedies do. For instance, ""Family Guy,"" though a bit funny, is so mind-numbingly stupid that I can feel my brain shrinking every time I watch it. ""King of the Hill"" is not like that and is entertaining without being idiotic.

My episode ratings:

1. Pilot: 10/10, excellent way to begin a series

2. Square Peg: 6/10; a bi ridiculous, but still funny.

3. The Order of the Straight Arrow: 7/10; funny, but a bit annoying.

4. Luanne's Saga: 8/10

5. Hank's Got the Willies: 8/10; though this episode is extremely funny, a couple parts are pretty dumb

6. Keeping Up With Our Joneses: 9/10; very funny

7. Plastic White Female: 5/10; a bit boring

8. The Company Man: 7/10; relatively mediocre episode, though parts of it are pretty entertaining

9. King of the Ant Hill: 9/10; pretty funny

10. Westie Side Story: 10/10; very good

11. Hank's Unmentionable Problem: 5/10; I didn't like this episode very much and I found nothing funny about it.

12. Shins of The Father: 7/10; amusing to watch, a great introduction to Hank's father.

13. Peggy the Boggle Champ: 5/10; I found this episode a bit stupid and the Boggle Tournament kind of annoyed me.

Every episode was somewhat entertaining, even the dumb ones, and I would recommend this series/show to anyone. It was definitely worth the money I've spent on it and has provided me with a lot of entertainment.",1154736000,7,2329,4.602905569007264
1480207,1,B00005JM3G,"I am not a snotty reviewer who just likes giving 1 star reviews.  I was hoping maybe someone could explain to me why this show is funny.  I have watched several episodes (mostly because it comes on after Malcolm in the Middle, which i deem to be a far superior show even if its losing steam after 7 seasons) and maybe cracked a smile through a few of them, but i have never, to my recollection ever laughed.  I am not too picky with what i watch (except for reality tv which i think is the worst thing to hit america since 9/11) and like many different kinds of shows ex: Frasier, Seinfeld, Simpsons, Family Guy, Malcolm in the Middle, Lost, 24, Prison Break,and that 70's show.  But in my humble opinion in order for a show to go on you have to stop trying to be so damn smart (unless your the brilliant Arrested Development, which was unfortunately canceled:() and start trying to be funny.  And also the show has way to many touching moments.  The simpsons had them but didn't use them too much, and they only work once in a while because no one really cares if a cartoon dad loves his son no matter what, its a frikkin tv show.  Anyways, if someone could please politely explain what is so funny about this show, i would appreciate it.

ps.  I have looked over all  6 seasons out on dvd and from the amount of reviews i have seen no one else really gives a [...] about the show.  I wonder how its still on the air?",1145232000,8,1418,4.214814814814815

1480272,5,B00005JM3G,"Initially aired following the 1997 Super Bowl, King of the Hill discovered an instant audience niche that has the followed the show loyally ever since. The brainchild of Beavis and Butthead creator Mike Judge (also known for the hit movie Office Space), King of the Hill is a unique animated series in that it doesn't rely on ""cartoon"" suspension of reality or outlandish antics. In fact, the show would arguably be just as successful if it were not animated at all. Nevertheless, it's Mike Judge (voice of Hank Hill) and his unique brand of humor that make King of the Hill a must-see TV series...

Set in the fictional town of Arlen, Texas, King of the Hill follows the life and exploits of Hank Hill and his traditional nuclear family. Hank is a red-state propane salesman who loves beer and apple pie, but he's constantly inundated with modern liberalism and grapples with the demands of political correctness. Hank is joined by his wife Peggy (a substitute teacher), his son Bobby (an awkward pre-pubescent youth), and a trailer park-like live-in niece named Luanne... Providing added comic relief to the series are Hank's off-the-wall friends Bill, Boomhauer (who is inaudible), and Dale (who believes everything is a government conspiracy)... Hank's Laotian neighbor Kahn (whose daughter Bobby is quite fond of) and his family live next door, providing Hank with a continuing dose of culture shock...

The King Of The Hill (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere in which we meet for the first time the various characters involved in Hank Hill's life in Arlen, Texas. Bobby gets hit in the eye with a baseball, prompting a social worker to launch an investigation into filing possible child abuse charges against Hank. Meanwhile, Hank's niece Luanne, an aspiring beautician, is forced to move in with Hank and his family after her mother is put in jail for stabbing her father... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Square Peg"" in which Peggy is forced to teach sexual education class, and ""Hank's Unmentionable Problem"" in which Hank becomes constipated and (much to his chagrin) receives numerous opinions on how to cure it...

Below is a list of episodes included on the King Of The Hill (Season 1) DVD:

Episode 1 (Pilot)

Episode 2 (Square Peg)

Episode 3 (The Order of the Straight Arrow)

Episode 4 (Hank's Got the Willies)

1480273,5,B00005JM3G,"""King of the Hill"" is one of those rare shows that comes into everyone's life and resonates with them for the rest of their life. I think it's an amazing show. I know it's animated, but so what, so is ""The Simpsons"" and ""Family Guy"", although I wouldn't put those two brain-dead shows in the same category as ""King of the Hill.""

""King of the Hill"" is simply put...a realistic sitcom, but only it's animated. It could very well be with live people. The situations all of these characters get into are nothing out-of-the-norm. They have common problems just like everyone else. In my opinion, this is the ONLY show Fox has put on that is remotely enteraining. All of their other sitcoms, especially ""Malcolm in the Middle"" are a poor example of the station's need for airing the mundane.

Having said all of that, this first season is hysterical. I have the first three seasons and all are wildly entertaining. Check this show out! You will not be sorry!",1112486400,13,953,4.6
1480274,5,B00005JM3G,"This show is a hell of alot better than the ""The Simpsons"".  It's not gay!!!! This is actually funny!!! Yeah I said it!!!  My favorite 2 episodes from season 1 are the pilot.  The other is the one where Hank's father arrives for Bobby's B'day.  In  the pilot  we get introduced to Hank Hill and his family wife Peggy, son Bobby and his niece Luanne.  I'm sure we all know what the plot and the other 13 episodes are about.  This show is from the man who created ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" Mike Judge.  That's one of the main reasons I like it better than the Simpsons.  The other is that it is funny!!!! The cast is alot better than the gay ""The Simpsons"".  Yeah I said it again!!!!! I hope this show goes alot longer. IT ROCKS!!!!!!!",1110931200,,730,4.255474452554744

1480276,5,B00005JM3G,"Yes - EVERYONE knows about the Simpsons.  What most people don't know is that the for the last 7 years, Hank Hill and company have been riding shotgun on Sunday night.  The show is laugh out loud funny.  This first season was hysterical.  The characters are three dimensional and the plots are good.

Picture a nice guy in his late 30s from small town in Texas.  Grew up in a divorced family - raised by his war hero father - a man that is four feet tall because the Nazis blew off his shins.  He married his high school sweetheart and lives next door to his best friends from high school - two fellow football players (a womanizer on disability and an army barber whose wife left him) and the team's manager (a conspiracy theorist exterminator whose wife is having an affair with an indian spirit healer).  And one asian neighbor that was kicked out of Anaheim.  He has a son who really isn't that athletic and loves fruit pies more than sports.  The son's best friend - the nutcase's son - look ALOT like the indian spirit healer.  Sounds depressing at first.  The son's girlfriend is the asian neighbor's daughter.  Sounds confusing?  Nope.  It's perfectly executed and - by the end of the first season - you feel like these could be real people.  (Note for my family - I KNOW THEY AREN'T REAL!)

BUT - in the first two or three episodes alone - you come to love these people.  They make you laugh :)

1480312,4,B00005JM3G,"Best:
1) A cartoon show about a normal family is refreshing for a change. People who find ""The Simpsons"" or ""Futurama"" (or """"The Family Guy"") too wild should appreciate this leisure comedy.
2) Some of the episodes (mainly the first six) are extremely hilarious.
3) There are a few episode commentary tracks and behind-the scenes shows.
Worst:
1) This season is short - only 13 episodes (as compared to the usual 22).
2) The commentary tracks where the actor's use their character voices aren't very entertaining or informative.
Recommendation:
This series is a must-have for anybody with a sense of humor. The first few episodes should get you hooked.",1075248000,5,651,4.981651376146789
