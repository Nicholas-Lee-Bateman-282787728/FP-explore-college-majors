8473247,1,B004YDTD84,"This workout was 11 minutes. As another review pointed out, that's it.

Unless you want to pause the DVD to add in more reps, or run through the workout 2 or 3 times, the program as it's presented is pretty useless.

Not worth the money - try ""Baby Bells"" by Lauren Brooks for a more comprehensive kettlebell workout that will get your heart rate up and leave you pleasantly sore the next day.",1420329600,2,393,4.36986301369863
8473248,1,B004YDTD84,"I'm so disappointed! I'm five months pregnant and moderately fit, and this dvd was such a waste of money for me. It's 11 minutes of exercise. That's it. You can play it several times, but even so it's SO EASY that it didn't feel like a workout at all. No challenge, no variety, and I can't believe I paid so much for such a short workout. Not worth the money. I like Lindsay Brin or Suzanne Bowenn's pregnancy workouts much better.",1415491200,2,431,4.333333333333333
8473249,5,B004YDTD84,"I am pregnant and I received this video as a thoughtful gift about a month back. I am not usually a fan of working out at home, alone, but I decided to give it a shot. It is the best thing a pregnant lady who wants to keep her body moving could ask for. Jessica focuses on attainable movements and exercises that not only keep me moving, which can be quite difficult at times, but it also help me feel like I got a workout. It has been very helpful in getting me a little extra burst of energy, especially in the mornings. Some days I wake up dragging, but without fail if I can force myself to turn it on and do the workout, I feel so much better.",1309305600,,648,3.9923076923076923
8473250,5,B004YDTD84,"I'm so excited to have found this prenatal (& postpartum) workout!  I've delayed getting back into shape after the birth of my daughter and I just tried this video and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!  Jessica doesn't commit the typical trainer faux-pas (not keeping things even on each side) which is my biggest pet peeve from on other videos I've tried.  I love that I can get a full workout in a half an hour (during one of my baby's naps!) but if I only have time for one set, can just run the 11 min workout through once and sneak a quick workout in my day.

Best of all, after doing this workout, I have so much energy and don't feel like I need my typical morning nap. :)  I look forward to continuing to use this work out for my postpartum recovery and hopefully well into my next pregnancy if I'm so lucky!  Thank you Jessica for giving us something new to do in addition to the standard yoga!",1308528000,,890,4.205882352941177
8473251,5,B004YDTD84,"I tried this video for the first time at 20 weeks pregnant, and I was able to do it twice through while breaking a good sweat. I got my heartrate up and felt comfortable with all the movements. I'm making every effort to keep training throughout my pregnancy, and this video will help me accomplish this.",1306195200,,304,4.446428571428571
8473252,5,B004YDTD84,"Bought this for my brother's wife on the advice of my trainer, she loves it! She likes the focus on keeping her core (and back) strong and maintaining her cardio fitness as her weight increases.",1304553600,,194,4.571428571428571
8473253,5,B004YDTD84,I am so excited to try this product out and relieved there is finally a DVD available for a woman who is pregnant and athletic and wants a workout that is more than just simply stretching... This prenatal video is the perfect combination of cardio and resistance training all in one fast easy to do routine!,1304294400,2,307,4.5
