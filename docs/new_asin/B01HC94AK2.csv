This set was lent to me by a friend to assess as a compilation of discs that he knew I was already very familiar with.

Review

This box brings together the complete Barenboim recordings available on Euroarts at a much reduced price compared to the individual issues. All except the pair of Liszt recitals from 1985 and the Bach Goldberg Variations from 1992 have been reviewed by quite a number of listeners including myself and those reviews can be read under their individual disc titles. All 13 concert and recital discs are still available. The documentary is also separately available, copyrighted 5 years ago in 2011.

So much for the general introduction: Daniel Barenboim has been a popular and main attraction for the concert-going and record collecting public for a great number of years. Many of those supporters will have already bought a few or several of these discs and will therefore be unlikely to find this box set a financial attraction despite its competitive pricing. In particular, the Beethoven and Mozart concerto discs are also available on Blu-ray and have received particularly encouraging reviews from previous purchasers including this reviewer.

Clearly therefore, this box is not primarily aimed at previous enthusiasts, many of whom will have already have purchased at least some of these discs. That assumption has been confirmed in answering comment from Euroarts. The main audience must therefore be assumed to be those starting out on this endlessly fascinating journey of musical appreciation and for those this may well be a very attractive musical and financial proposition. This is despite the lack of the Blu-ray options where they are otherwise available. If such a purchaser were to buy the individual DVD and/or BD discs they would find it far more expensive.

The documentary is in the form of extended conversations, examples of interactions, rehearsals and performances centred around Barenboim. It could be described as a guided tour by Barenboim through the places that are historically, musically and geographically vital to him. The documentary is well-planned and executed and not for a moment does the interest level flag. The playing time of 90 minutes gives a clue as to the detail of the coverage but time still seems to fly past. The film by Paul Smaczny is of very high quality both in terms of content and technicalities.

The otherwise un-reviewed Bach Goldberg Variations are given a sensitive and generally period-aware performance by Barenboim. This is true despite some subtleties of touch that would be hard to imagine being possible on period instruments. The recording is accompanied by a 10 minute introduction by the pianist. Despite its obvious attractions it is still likely that Bach enthusiasts might prefer the alternative Euroarts 2008 live performance by Evgeni Koroliov on DVD. Koroliov has spent his artistic life presenting this work and has achieved an unusual oneness in his empathy with the Variations despite being played on a modern piano. It would be idle to pretend that his recording does not have visual (HD) and audio (stereo and surround 5.1 in Dolby and DTS) advantages to match the artistic qualities.

The two Liszt recitals from 1985 are both of high musical quality and are both very well-played. These focus on the Suisse and Italian Annes de plerinage as well as operatic transcriptions of Verdi and Wagner. There is some significant doubling with the program of the 2007 La Scala recital but the musical delivery is equally good in both cases. Those who favour a more extrovert style may prefer alternative performers but others will be well satisfied. The comprehensive set of Mozart piano sonatas are very rewarding and have no visual competitor at present.

The 2000 Buenos Aires concert, the 2001 documentary, the 2007 Beethoven concertos and the 2007 La Scala concert are all HD recordings by the ever-excellent Paul Smaczny team offering both stereo and surround sound formats. These would constitute a personal selection of highlights from this collection. The majority of the remainder are good examples of SD stereo sound and visuals of their periods and are Metropolitan Munich products from 1986-1992.

It is worth noting that the Brahms concertos are also included in the recent complete Brahms symphonic works (BD and DVD) conducted by Welser-Most with Bronfman as pianist. That is clearly not a direct competitor but is a superb product throughout. Barenboims remake of the first concerto with Rattle in Athens is also available (BD and DVD) and also well-worth investigating.

Overall then, this 14 DVD disc box set should give good value to collectors at the start of their collecting lives. Playing time is a generous 24 hours.",1472169600,,4870,5.246786632390745
