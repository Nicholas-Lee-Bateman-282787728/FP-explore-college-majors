8504239,5,B006TXDSQK,Sins Of Jezebel was released in 1953. A Campy trashy tale starring George Nader. I liked this a lot.  Fans of George  Nader will like this the most.,1465084800,,148,4.25

8504242,2,B006TXDSQK,"Very disappointing. No closed caption. So I mailed to give to my sister. I let her have it. I hope someday, you will put closed caption. I know this is very old movie. Except that is a good thing that have DVD.",1402531200,,210,4.023809523809524
8504243,3,B006TXDSQK,"THE SINS OF JEZEBEL is another old Hollywood Biblical epic made in the tradition of Gregory Peck's ""DAVID AND BATHSHEBA"" and Yul Brynner's ""SOLOMON AND SHEBA"".  Unfortunately, Paulett Goddard does not make the best Jezebel.  I have seen other movies that she has appeared in, and it seems like she is the same in SOJ as she is in other movies that she has made such as ""KITTY"" and ""THE WOMEN"".  The difference being that they have just changed her costume and hair and put her in sets that depict a different time, the rest of Paulett Goddard's acting is the same.",1398816000,,564,4.509803921568627
8504244,5,B006TXDSQK,I always liked the old Biblical movie. I enjoyed watching a movie done on the turbulent period of the kingdom of Israel and the Great and powerful ministry of the fiery Prophet Elijah in standing against the evil of Ahab and the paganism of Jerzebel.,1383436800,,250,4.5777777777777775
