3665117,5,B001KEGR70,i bought this product because my instructor is in it  on the USA/kajukembo part  i loved this series and i hope they continue it.  it's nice to see things in a positive light for martial artists,1252886400,,194,4.333333333333333
3665118,5,B001KEGR70,"These guys are awesome. One of the best purchases I have ever made. I was always a Human Weapon fan, and people used to tell me about this show, and because I never saw it, I always just wrote it off. Thankfully I caught a rogue episode on the military channel, and the next day ordered the dvd set. I still love Human Weapon, but this show could be even better. The hosts/fighters are not only very personable, but they fight for real, no light sparring, real fighting, totally put there hearts and bodies into the fight. The only thing that pissed me off about this series, is that there wasn't a second season. I really wish they would have been able to do several seasons of this show, what more is there to say, it's great!",1251936000,,728,4.321167883211679
3665119,3,B001KEGR70,"I should preface this review by saying that Fight Quest was a great show. Much respect for Doug and Jimmy for their hard work and training! I think in a lot of respects it was better than its History Channel counterpart, Human Weapon. The hosts seemed to train harder, fight harder, and the show in general was focused more on fighting, as opposed to bits of history and computer animated techniques.

The problem with this DVD is that *a lot* of material got cut from every episode. I have no idea why Discovery thought this was a good idea, it steals a lot from the show. The stick training scenes in the Wing Chun and Kalarippayattu episodes were completely removed. In some cases, you lose a feel for the intensity of the style. The Kajukenbo episode was particularly hard hit in this way. They seemed to cut most of the training sequences, which are the meat of the show.

Bottom line, be aware that the quality of this DVD is not what you got watching the show on tv.",1246752000,24,973,4.430167597765363
3665120,5,B001KEGR70,"Ever since I was a kid I've always been fascinated by the martial arts. (thanks Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!) My parents enrolled me in Karate when I was in middle school and I've studied off and on for years. So needless to say I was drawn to this show when I caught an episode while channel surfing. The show follows two fighters(jimmy Smith and Doug Anderson) as they travel around the world and practice the native fighting style for five days. At the end of the five day training period they have a traditional sparing match with a advanced student of that art. The show takes them all over the world to places like India, Japan, Mexico and Brazil where they learn both hands and weapon based styles. Both Smith and Anderson are skilled in their own rights. Anderson was a army bodyguard and Smith has fought pro MMA so when they get the snot beat out of them(and they often do) it's a true testament to the effectiveness of the arts they are studying. The styles they study and places they travel to are as follows.

PHILIPPINES: KAILI- A weapons based fighting style involving lighting fast strikes with knives and sticks. The guys get some nasty lumps and bruises.  Plus we get to see Anderson get baptized in chicken blood! That's right..chicken blood.

CHINA: KUNG FU- The guys hike deep into the mountains of China to learn the ancient art of Kung Fu. They receive both a physical and spiritual education and the episode really gets into the history of the art.

JAPAN: KYOKUSHIN KARATE- A very brutal style of Karate. The training leaves Anderson almost enable to compete and both guys get knocked out several times. Very fascinating episode

SOUTH KOREA: HAPKIDO- A style thay incorporates dazzling kicks and throws. The boys endure intense training and face true masters of the art.

FRANCE: SAVATE- A variation of Kickboxing that involves blazing fast footwork and devastating head kicks. Nether of the guys are good at kicks and it shows as they fight some of the top flight ""Savatetors"" in France. Their trainer is pretty mean(but funny) in this episode.

INDONESIA: PENCAK SILATE- A very strange style that has unorthodox strikes, throws and weapon techniques. The guys are put though some of the most brutal training yet(sprinting though waist high water, punching trees for minutes at a time, running up hills with someone on your back) Anderson injures himself while training and doubts if can compete.

MEXICO: BOXING- through out the show both Smith and Anderson display impressive striking skills but both look like amateurs when they spare against some of the best boxers in Mexico City. Not only that, they must train in a environment 10,000 feet above sea level.

BRAZIL: JIU-JITSU: The boys go to beautiful Rio(lucky!) where they are trained by the legendary Rickson Gracie(undefeated) in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, a style that uses joint locks and leverage to defeat opponents. Anderson leans a valuable lesson when he is beaten by a girl that is much smaller than him. It's skill and discipline. Not size and strength that matter.

ISRAEL: KRAV MAGA- I've always heard of Krav Maga but I've never really seen it in action. After watching this episode I'm very impressed. Krav maga is a style that the Israeli army learns to disarm and kill their enemies as effectively and quickly as possible. using pure aggression, throws and nasty strikes, Krav Maga is one of, if not the deadliest style shown on the show.

USA: KAJUKENBO- the best thing I can compare this style to is a mix of MMA and just strait up street brawling. Anything goes in this episode and the guys must train by fighting up to 5 people at a time. Fight hard, Take out your enemy and live to tell the tale.

THAILAND: MUAY THAI- A type of kick boxing that allows knee and elbow strikes(In Muay Thai a punch is considered the weakest strike you can throw) Vastly popular in Tailand, Muay Thai is considered the national sport. The boys learn that is can be as poetic as it is deadly while they endure brutal training and an in depth education to the style's spiritual side.

INDIA: KALARIPPAYATTU- A sword and shield  as well as a striking style, Many people believe that the ancient art of Kalaprppayattu is the architect of many eastern fighting styles. Definitely the most exotic style shown on the show, it was fascinating to watch it in action because it is rarely practiced outside of India. A shocking accident occurs with a sword in this episode.

HONG KONG: WING CHUNG- A style of Kung Fu that emphasizes speed and street brawling. The guys learn how to use fast strikes to defend themselves against multiple foes. It's really amazing to see how fast the masters strike and in turn, how difficult it is to strike them back. Smith gets head kicked off a boat in this episode. Pretty funny.

""Fight Quest"" is very entertaining and there's a lot to learn by watching it. The season is 13 episodes that each run at 43 minutes so you get an in depth look into each style. Anderson and Smith are very humble and professional through out the show and provide excellent commentary during their training. They are in no way cocky meat heads that think they can beat everyone. If you're a martial arts fan or practitioner this show is for you. I was introduced to arts I've never heard of or seen and got a better understanding of the ones that I knew. ""Fight Quest"" is a thinking man's fight show.",1245456000,27,5388,4.703821656050955
3665121,5,B001KEGR70,"Jimmy and Doug are two young American men traveling the world submitting themselves to the pain and discipline of various martial arts.

They make a great team.  They are both very humble and respectful.  They both make fine ambassadors of the U.S.A.

These shows are very inspiring to watch.  Watching their work ethic, and the training, motivates me to get up and train hard myself.

This is a great series.",1244332800,2,409,4.771428571428571
3665122,4,B001KEGR70,"I am a fan of Fight Quest, and anyone who has watched the show or is interested in martial arts will definitely be  entertained by this show.
Excellent show as it goes into the culture of all the martial arts, the training, the hard work. Doug and Jimmy are also excellent hosts and they give good perspectives to each fighting style.

All the episodes from the series are on this DVD set, but my only disappointment is that there are no subtitles in the DVD, and no bonus features.

Otherwise, i highly recommend this purchase.",1243728000,,528,4.536842105263158
3665123,5,B001KEGR70,"I previously purchased and reviewed the first Fight Quest 5-dvd set which contained all of the aired episodes of Fight Quest.  Although nice to have, I found it somewhat disappointing.  This dvd set is the one to get!  Don't even bother with the other one.  The bonuses with this set are the 3 unaired episodes.  I found the Muay Thai and Wing Chun episodes to be 2 of my favorites of the entire series and was disappointed that neither of them aired before Discovery Channel cancelled the series.  I won't rehash my comments from my other review, but will only add that of the 2 series, Human Weapon and Fight Quest, it is Fight Quest I found to be more enjoyable and will probably watch repeatedly for entertainment value.",1237420800,7,724,4.573643410852713

That's how the show draws you in and they know how to keep you there. These guys are tough, have great personalities, are relaxed on camera, and know how to fight! This is definitely a series that will draw you in and have you shouting at the final match like you were there yourself. That's the highlights of this DVD. And here's the but...
For each episode, there were some 60 hours of footage filmed and cut down to a 43 minute show. So imagine my shock when there were NO special features. No deleted scenes, no interviews, no nothing. They even keep the episodes censored by bleeping out the swear words.
So while the lack of extras is a sore spot, these guys are worth watching and the series is worth owning!",1236556800,13,943,4.552941176470588
3665125,5,B001KEGR70,"I loved this show. It jumped on Human Weapons' coattails, but I still think it was a much better show with more likable hosts.",1236297600,,126,4.291666666666667
3665126,4,B001KEGR70,"The DVD that I've been waiting for has finally arrived and I can't help but be happy. Every episode from the first season is on it, including a new episode that I have not seen before, which was the Wing Chun kung fu episode. I only have two problems with this DVD. One, I would have liked to seen a few things that were left out, such as the demos for Kyokushin karate at the end of the episode, which they took out. I also would have liked to see the deleted scenes that did not make it into the final cut of each episode, such as Jimmy training the shaolin monks how to play basketball or Doug talking about the bond he has with his Hapkido master and how his teacher shared, with him, the definition of Hapkido. Other than that, I recommend this DVD to anyone who can't get enough of Fight Quest!",1235692800,7,800,4.167741935483871
3665153,3,B001KEGR70,"If you love to watch fights, this is not the show for you.  If you want to learn specific techniques from multiple martial arts in detail, this is not the show for you.  This show is just a good (but brief) overview of several different martial arts.  Since each would take years to master individually, don't expect much in that regard, but if you're trying to decide which martial art to pursue, or if you're just curious about the differences between styles, this should be a good starting point.  The hosts are likable and good sports.  Instead of a bunch of macho arrogance, they always show respect and friendliness to their opponents, even when they just lost to them.",1360022400,,675,4.638655462184874
3665154,5,B001KEGR70,"I love to watch it, verry good stuff.
I love this show! i started watching it online and couldn't stop until i finished the whole season and then i had to buy it! makes me want to travel and learn kickass martial arts styles. i saw the history channel's version called human weapon which was a similar premise but the two main subjects were less likeable than jimmy and doug.",1342396800,,375,4.371428571428571
3665155,1,B001KEGR70,"Seeing this series on TV i couldn't understand what the point of the show was. 2 MMA fighters train for 5 days in another country's martial art only to have a fight at the end. Most of which they would return to their old fighting techniques any way and not use what they were taught(Wing Chun ep. for example).
Some of the history of the martial arts they explore is incorrect which is probably the biggest part of why you would watch something like this to begin with is to get some insight into different cultures and their martial arts.

I would have to recommend instead of this the 'Kill Arman' series is a better find.
Still the 5 days training with a fight at the end. But the guy doesn't know martial arts and has to rely on what he is taught.
It shows a much more realistic view of how you would really train at a school and shows a fuller view of the martial art itself.",1330732800,4,881,4.21301775147929
3665156,4,B001KEGR70,"The cinematography is, as is the case for most Discovery Chanel works, very good. The martial arts selected were also very good. The two actors/athletes were ""fun"" and very willing and able to take a beating. The show glazes over the history of most of the arts they covered and made a few inaccurate statements, but over all, it was both entertaining and informative. Having been involved in the martial arts for over 35 years and having martial arts history and traditions as one of my hobbies, that is saying something.

The two athletes study the art of the week, each from a different master with different training ideas. They learn the basic ideas of the art and then they fight using what they know. Obviously they are NOT given time to really learn anything, but you do get to see the basic principles of the art being studied and you get a feel for the training methods. This is NOT a MMA, free-for-all bash or street fighting series nor is it a how to be a fighter in 5 easy lessons show. If you are looking for insight into other styles or are just fascinated by the worlds martial arts, then this an amazing series. It is a shame it came to an end so soon.

Note: The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is that at times, the athletes get a bit campy, the history is NOT 100% all the time and, as petty as this may be, the athletes always refer to the martial arts they are studying as sports. Not all of the arts are sports. In fact, many are no hold bard, save your butt in a street fight combat arts. So, while I really like this series and recommend it to ALL martial art and combat enthusiasts, it could have been done a little better.",1313712000,,1655,4.284345047923322
3665157,4,B001KEGR70,"Jimmy and Doug, the two hosts of this series make this a real armchair treat for us who can afford to view this in the comforts of home.

  The production values are high, and the photography is beautiful.  The only downside I see is that there is thus far no Blu-ray offering for this series, otherwise I apreciate the hosts giving their all for that one week leading up to their big fights in the host countries.  I also enjoy that the two Americans are at all times sincere and respectful of the countries they are training in.  It's a refreshing change up from 'other' series that have a similar theme.",1305504000,,606,4.414414414414415

3665159,4,B001KEGR70,"This show follows the same format basically as Human Weapon, except that (at least according to the hype) they only train for five days and then they both have to fight in a match with fighters proficient in that particular discipline.  While they were some different martial arts profiled in this series that haven't been profiled before in other series (kajukenbo, wing chun, hapkido, Brazilian jujitsu, and boxing, which is not a martial art but a sport, although it can be effective for self defense under certain circumstances), not a lot of history or culture was profiled in these shows, the producers evidently preferring to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience.  Of all these series that have aired (Deadly Arts, Human Weapon, Fight Quest), Anderson has the best attitude of all the hosts I've seen, preferring to suck it up and deal with it even though he does comment on the differences between what they do and what they are asked to do.  Whether this is due to personal habits or his time in the military is unknown.  Another refreshing aspect is the courtesy and respect shown by both hosts towards all their instructors, which was not always evident on Human Weapon.  I have to say that Smith is the bigest whiner I've seen on any of these shows, constantly complaining about what he's not used to and making excuses when he fails to come up to scratch.  It just reinforces the fact that most MMA ""fighters"" are athletes rather than martial artists who don't have a clue unless you're fighting according to ""their"" rules.  As I stated in my review on Human Weapon, these types of shows are good in that they introduce viewers to many different types of martial arts rather than just karate, taekwondo, or kung fu, but at the same time I would have prefered to see a little more (accurate) history and culture than was shown in these episodes, and frankly I would also like to see more weapons work.  This series is worth having for general reference about martial arts and is a little better than Human Weapon, but it is still lacking in many areas.",1275436800,2,2083,4.6876712328767125
3665160,5,B001KEGR70,"Fight Quest may have surpassed History Channel's Human Weapon several ways. First, both hosts fight. Second, one trains in the modern/urban area while one goes to the roots of the arts. Third, while they are there to learn, they are there to fight and they know it and embrace it. While it lacks the technique portion of HW, it never really intended to go to that area, choosing to showcase the modern and classical interpretations of the arts and cultures of where ever they were staying. I never got the feeling like these guys where grossed out to be where ever they were, and with HW it seems like they're outside their comfort zone. Well worth the price and valued addition to my collection.

3665161,4,B001KEGR70,"This is a solid DVD set. I have watched most of the episodes now, and was impressed.

The guys train boxing in Mexico, Jiu-Jitsu in Brazil with a Gracie camp, Muay Thai, Kali, and Krav Maga to name a few.  All of which were highly entertaining.  This may not be a ""how to"" DVD, but rather a peak inside each of the different styles.

I would not advise using these as training DVDs, as some of the stuff they do is pretty brutal, and I'm thinking this was done for entertainment purposes.  Thats not to say that this is all fake, I believe what they were doing, and even use some of the things I saw in my training, but my advice is not to beat training partners into a pulp everyday!",1256515200,,684,4.151515151515151

8314793,5,B001KEGR70,"Outstanding show for all Martial Arts students and fans.  These two athletes are very fit, and also very nice guys who are not only eager to learn each of the world's different styles they train in, but they also show high class and respect doing it too which is missing in the modern MMA system. I liked these two guys and I found myself rooting for them at each bout they engaged in.

 There were styles showcased in this series I had never heard of, and of course styles that I have known about for many years.  The only episode I had problems with was the ""Krav Maga"" showcase, the instructors from that system viciously just went over the top pounding one of the show's stars to the point of not making any sense other then just to show how tough they are.  Beating some one to teach them something in the form of students learning through training and sparring is one thing, because learning real Martial Arts like athletes do in other countries requires toughing the student up and getting a an a$$ whooping to build the body and form discipline character, but just beating the snot out of some one is completely pointless and injuries the student.  I agree with the Israeli method of doing what ever move works, and blending hand to hand combat with modern weaponry like a handgun or an M-16 rifle, but their system does not have any deeper philosophy and comes off to raw and brutish unlike the more refined scientific and mechanical ""human body"" based systems showcased in the series.

 We have some awesome styles that are very applicable to the street self defense world such as ""Kajukempo"" a Hawaiian based system.  Those warriors from their two California based were awesome and had a lot to teach.  They show an exotic art from India I was impressed with, and they feature some really hard lined styles of Karate from Japan, along with the awesome ""Hapkido"" school in Korea (which is an art that blends the strikes from Tae Kwon Do with Japanese Aikido and Jujitsu joint locking defenses).

  There is another show just as good with some scientific animation to show the physics behind martial arts, ""The Human Weapon"" that should be viewed with this fine series.  Some episodes are free on youtube, others you will need to purchase the DVDs.  A + and two thumbs up.",1431129600,,2281,4.597530864197531

This is relatively the same format as the History Channel's ""Human Weapon"" except that both guys fight, and it has more of a ""reality TV"" bend to it. H.W. was superior and of a higher quality production. Still, very interesting. Great video to have in your library to review various ""moves"" from a variety of martial arts. They visit most of typical Asian countries like Korea (Hapkido) China (Kung Fu) & Japan ( Karate) and even do Savate in France, Krav Maga in Israel, & Kali in the Philippines.
One interesting thing I've observed is that the training in some of these places is detrimental to the fighter. They train so hard in draconian fashion that by the end of the week the fighter is so beat up he is limping. What good does it do too train so hard and be injured or less than 100% for the match? Being a karate practitioner I've point sparred in a few Kumite tournaments - being healthy seems to trump technique more than often.",1397520000,,999,4.4945054945054945
