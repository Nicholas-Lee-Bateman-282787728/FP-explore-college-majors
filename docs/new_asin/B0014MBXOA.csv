8256047,4,B0014MBXOA,"Although much-hyped as a horror film during production, 'Deathwatch' obviously shifted tone substantially in post-production towards a depiction of the everyday horrors of the Great War and seems all the better for it. Although there are vague similarities to Michael Mann's disappointing 'The Keep' and its truly dreadful British rip-off 'The Bunker,' this is both more ambitious and successful than either. A more accurate comparison would be to John Ford's rarely revived 'The Lost Patrol,' where a group of soldiers lost in the desert turn on each other as their situation worsens.

The production design is for the most part impeccable: unlike the studio-bound and cliche-ridden 'The Trench,' this offers one of the most realistic screen recreations of trench life at its worst, rats and all. Where the opening battle sequence never quite seems intense enough, the mundane realities of surviving daily life in what is little more than an open grave leave a lasting impression.

There are problems: some of the attitudes are wrong for the period, as are occasional lines of dialogue (such as references to then-nonexistent holiday camps or contemporary slang such as 'plank'). It's not even remotely frightening, and only begins to chill with its oddly touching ending (which bears more than a little similarity to a famed Bruce Joel Rubin script, the title of which would ruin the ending for anyone who hasn't seen it). But, unlike most British efforts of recent years, it is a real film with ambition and a sense of scale that is well worth a look.",1209340800,2,1554,5.06640625
