I think for the u.s., dvd disk are regional coded at 1. So i have a dvd of spiderman and his amazing friends that won't play on any of the 3 dvd players that i have. So thank you for sending me a product that i bought that doesnt work. I probally will not be ordering from this site again. Thank you.
