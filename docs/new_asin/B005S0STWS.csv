4862301,5,B005S0STWS,"The Lovely Angels are a hoot. This is a cop-buddy anime with two girl protagonists who tend to do more damage than the bad guys do.

This is one of the later OVAs where the models had changed slightly. Specifically Kei with that all-red 'do - I liked the earlier version better. BUT, the stories are still hilarious if contrived. Remember always, these are Japanese and they are written to Japanese sensibilities. Some of the things they get worked up about make us, well this, Americans go 'Huh?' where the Japanese in turn totally ignore things that make us Americans go 'What're they ignoring that for?'

So, I do indeed recommend the series. All of it. It's funny - enjoy.",1363046400,2,676,4.625

4862304,4,B005S0STWS,"If ever there was a Japanese franchise begging for a Hollywood movie version, it would be this one.  Two shapely babes in battle bikinis catching bad guys and blowing up everything around them in a comic orgy of destruction - what's not to like?

Kei and Yuri are the Lovely Angels aka the Dirty Pair, two ""Trouble Consultants"" for the FUTURE organization known as the Worlds Welfare Works Association, or WWWA, or 3WA (whew).  Their job is to solve various problems that seem to crop up on various worlds, usually (but not always) through deadly (and destructive) force.  In this collection of ten OVA episodes you will see Kei and Yuri (among other things) surf a gas giant, chase a ""Terminator""-looking robot ""Black Magic""-style on Halloween night, marry into the mob, perpetually annoy their boss Chief Gooley, play roulette with asteroids in a space casino and... become space truckers?  These episodes are great, mindless fun, good for watching after a long day at work or school or whatever, and what makes them even better is that they are truly episodic which means that you don't have to commit to watching them all in sequence - just sit down and pick a random one out for your viewing pleasure.

How does this new release from Nozomi/Right Stuf compare to the previous one from (the now defunct) ADV?  Well, it's a mixed bag.  First let's look at the positive.  Simply put, the video upgrade is *awesome*.  The picture on this release is much nicer than the old ADV discs - the colors are more vivid and the image is sharper; the old discs look hazy and washed out in comparison.  This might have something to do with the fact that this new release comes on three discs and not two like the previous one - more room for higher quality video, perhaps.  Also on a related note for those who care:  Nozomi uses the original Japanese language credits instead of replacing the text with English like on the ADV edition.  Audio-wise this release has the same options as the previous one, with both the original Japanese and English dubs.  The English track is the same ADV dub from the previous release, meaning stiff acting and gratuitous swearing - but hey, freedom of choice, right?  At least it sounds (ironically enough) slightly better than the old ADV discs.  The Japanese track sounds the same as the previous edition, with no audible upgrade.  Speaking of Japanese, the subtitles are new - this has a different translation than the one used by ADV, so Nozomi is not being lazy on this.  The subtitles look nice (there are no hardsubs) but I did notice one or two typos.  Last but not least, this new Nozomi Dirty Pair set, unlike the previous one from ADV actually has some special features!  Clean opening and ending sequences and a few liner notes compliment the normal Nozomi/Right Stuf previews, meaning at least a *little* thought went into these discs, unlike ADV's barebones set.

Where this set falters though, especially compared to the earlier ADV one, is in the packaging.  Surprisingly this comes in a single 3-disc DVD case and not a cardboard/thinpak combo like the previous ADV release.  I say this is surprising because Nozomi is usually a little classier with their packaging - see their releases of ""The Irresponsible Captain Tylor,"" ""Revolutionary Girl Utena"" or even the ""Dirty Pair"" TV Series... all have nice cardboard cases with thinpaks.  I wonder if they consider this a lesser release just because it's an OVA?  Anyway, the 3-disc case is one of the ones where two of the discs are layered one on top of the other, necessitating the difficult removal of one disc to get to the other and increasing the chance of scratches.  I.  Hate.  This.  Nozomi, multiple-disc DVD cases do exist that are much easier to use and utilize ""pages"" that can be flipped to access discs - see the two&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sean-Connery/dp/B004BR7XLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sean Connery </a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/007-Collections/dp/B004TJ1H1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">007 Collections</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/some-of-the-DVD-releases/dp/B000FTC1GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">some of the DVD releases </a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/of-Night-Court/dp/B0025KVNOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">of ""Night Court""</a>.  Another gripe with the case for this is that it is cheaply made - one of the spindles was already broken when I first opened up the case and now the first disc won't stay in place.  I will have to order some DVD cases from Amazon to correct both of these problems.  ADV's presentation of the ""Dirty Pair"" OVAs was much nicer, with a sturdy cardboard box housing thinpaks with some nice artwork.  Unfortunately, Nozomi's presentation says ""Bargain Release"" - there isn't even a cardboard sleeve for this - and I think Yuri and Kei deserve better.

In the end, I can recommend this DVD set for both veteran ""Dirty Pair"" fans and Lovely Angel newbies - for those new to the Pair these episodes will give you a good time and whet your appetite for the movie and other series while the old fan will appreciate the considerable video upgrade on these discs.  However, be prepared to be disappointed with Nozomi's packaging and put down money to replace the case when it inevitably breaks (or you get frustrated with trying to pry the discs from the annoying spindles).  So it's not perfect.  But you'll still get ten episodes of two girls in bikinis kicking butt on three discs of fun and mayhem.

Actually, now that I think about it, ""Dirty Pair"" would also make a great live-action TV show - think about it:  two feisty girls with guns in the future blowing stuff up and quipping about it all the way.  Are you listening, Joss Whedon?",1325635200,23,5873,5.192144373673036

Kei and Yuri are the Lovely Angels (or more disrespectfully, the Dirty Pair), a pair of ""trouble consultants"" working for a private corporation, the World Welfare Works Association (WWWA or 3WA), which helps member solar systems deal with planetary-scale problems by dispatching agents like them (for a small fee). Depending on how you look at it, they are either the 3WA's best agents or their worst: because though they always solve the case, solving the case often involves collateral damage on a Biblical scale. It's worth noting that said damage is never technically their fault, but this is usually small comfort to the victims.

01: Prison Uprising.  We Hate People with Grudges!: After a prison uprising leaves a bunch of lifers in charge, Kei and Yuri are sent in to try and rescue the warden before a unit of space marines recaptures the prison (and possibly kills him in the process); unfortunately, said warden is more interested in taking revenge on the prisoners than in escaping.  Collateral damage?  One maximum security space prison shot to pieces (in fairness to the Dirty Pair the space marines were far more numerous and equipped with far heavier weapons so they did ALMOST as much damage as Kei and Yuri did), all of the guards, several prisoners, and a number of marines killed, one warden finally rescued after the girls have had enough.

02: No Thanks!  No Need for a Halloween Party: Kei and Yuri are dispatched to arrest a spy stealing military secrets; unfortunately, nobody informed them that the military secret he was currently stealing was a Tactical Robot Weapon prototype.  Thus after completing their mission with their usual skill and aplomb (they crash land the villain's shuttle craft into a city park fountain), they accidentally activate the weapon and now have less than an hour to find and deactivate it before it goes into berserker mode.  Trouble is that this is Halloween night so the TRW, which looks like a terminator, doesn't exactly stand out from the crowd, and on top of that a gang of thieves have chosen tonight for a series of robberies while wearing costumes.  Collateral damage?  One shuttle craft crash landed, one city park fountain damaged, one Tactical Robot Weapon unleashed, several cars wrecked, one armored car robbery foiled, one jewel robbery foiled, one art museum robbery foiled, one art museum leveled, one bank vault blasted open, one bank robbery foiled, one subway train dragon danced, several buildings blown up, one fireworks display repurposed, one TRW not returned intact to the military.

03: We're Not Afraid of Divine Judgment.  It's Like Magic?!  The God's Challenge:  Kei and Yuri are hired to investigate the murder of 300 employees and the subsequent disappearance of their employer's own investigators on a planet inhabited by an odd religious sect that has recently suffered a hostile takeover... from a new god.  Collateral damage?  A large number of people and one cow killed, one truck crashed, one religious satellite blown up, one false god struck down, one array of weather control satellites gone berserk, a whole lot of bad weather for the foreseeable future.

04: Who Cares if They're Only Kids!  Playing War Games Warrants a Firing Squad?!: For no discernible reason a bunch of spoiled brats, all children of high level government officials, take over a government base that just happens to be the hidden site for a doomsday weapon called the vibration cannon, which is capable of destroying the whole planet and damaging other planets as well.  Kei and Yuri are called in to save the situation WITHOUT harming the children....  Well, it's either them or sending in the military with orders to shoot to kill.  Collateral damage?  One air car blown to pieces, two security cams shot, several security bots blasted, one doomsday weapon activated, several unruly mouths taped shut, one load bearing column shot out, one warehouse mech battered into submission, one bunch of brats who escape the punishment they deserve.

05: And So, Nobody's Doing it Anymore: Kei and Yuri are sent to recover a 3WA agent who has become addicted to gambling.  The game is Meteor and involves betting on where on a grid overlaying some sort of planetoid body a meteorite will land.  The game gets more interesting when it becomes apparent someone has figured out how to cheat at it.  Collateral damage?  One casino space station trashed, one city meteor showered, one form of gambling ended, one expense report murdered.

06: Are You Kidding?!  Shocked at the Beach.  Wedding Panic!:  In a story that gleefully parodies&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Graduate/dp/B00079Z9VO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Graduate</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Godfather/dp/B000NTPDSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Godfather</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Castle-of-Cagliostro/dp/B00UN7FHCG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Castle of Cagliostro</a>&nbsp;Kei and Yuri are sent to take down the Castino crime family, whose wealth and power is built on counterfeiting; unfortunately, things get complicated when Yuri falls in love with the younger Castino son and agrees to marry him!  Collateral damage?  Several graves desecrated, one counterfeit master disc absconded with, one counterfeit printing operation bombed, one church blown up, several minions shot, blown up, and flying carded, one true love sacrificed.

07: Revenge of the Muscle Lady!  Is a Woman's Spirit the Beauty of the Ring?:  A former 3WA trainee has become a producer of a dangerous new performance enhancing drug so Kei and Yuri are sent to take her down as a matter of honor.  Collateral damage?  One flying security bot shot, several minions shot, one minion face sat, one security door torn out of the wall, one window broken, one drug manufacturing space lab wrecked on takeoff, one 3WA black mark not attributable to the Dirty Pair erased.

08: That Little Girl Is Older than Us.  The Preservation Was a Success.  Sleeping Beauty: Kei and Yuri find a cold sleep capsule containing the only survivor of an unsolved terrorist attack that killed 832 people twenty years ago, and set out to solve the case with the help of this newly rediscovered witness.  Collateral damage?  One air car shot up, one impounded spaceship blown up, several factory robots unmanufactured, Kei's personal gun destroyed, one factory damaged, one villain almost rescued.

09: Red Eyes Are the Sign of Hell.  Chase After the Killing Squad!: Someone is (or five someones are) trying to break up peace talks in a civil war that has lasted thirty years so Kei and Yuri are sent in to learn just who is trying to lengthen the war.  Collateral damage?  Several rebels killed, five kidnapped soldiers killed, one arms shipment returned but not for a refund.

10: No Need to Listen to the Bad Guys.  We Are Space Truckers!: In the Dirty Pair's trucker parody episode (they were required by law back then) Kei and Yuri pretend to be space truck drivers in order to find who is killing and threatening them.  Collateral damage?  Two space trucks destroyed, two space fighters destroyed, two spaceships blown up, one police station headquarters cargoed.

Nozomi Entertainment and Right Stuf! deserve a lot of credit for doing a nearly perfect job of re-releasing an anime classic by marrying remastered video with the ADV English dub along with the original Japanese audio and English subtitles as options, all at a reasonable price.

8484534,5,B005S0STWS,"i still own the original ADV set and this is just as good with better lightning and texture .

this classic anime series packs some amazing action girls as they head out on many missions to try fix up problems ...err well atleast they try there best but due to reckless actions and unintentional mistakes that leads them in hot water and there chief gets all the headache for there actions .

enter Kai a hot headed ( with red hair to boot  )  tomboy with an attitude and alot of courage to do her stuff her way & yuri a very beautiful silky haired girly girl who takes smarter decisions thru her actions  and mughi there fluffy helpful companion  rare species of space cats

now as for this set compared to the Original  adv set i see the quality is fairly better overall as i finished the 2nd disc , JPN voice acting is still as good with Kai still being the best of the bunch and the USA Dub is good and worth your time .

great to see there is some love for the Dirt >< ....... erm ehmmm ...... lovely angels after all these years  and i still wish there some continuation after the FLASH series of this original casting  , just like space adventures cobra .

and the 80's soundtrack and BGM is still vivid and LIKE TOTALLY RAD  ( LOL ) , please don't think this is a hentai show just by the tittle cuz its not , this is some prime time girl power and ass kicking space chicks ( in space bakini mind you ) that is more akin to anime like your under arrest  and a flare of charlie's  angels .",1440374400,,1495,4.106896551724138
