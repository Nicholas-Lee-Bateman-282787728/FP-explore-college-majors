8712959,2,B00WEAKVEO,"Not very good. Don't know it if was poorly subtitled or the story really was as poor as it came across. Could not watch the whole thing, and I'll watch just about anything.",1465689600,,172,4.242424242424242
8712960,3,B00WEAKVEO,"It's ok.  Is a little confusing at the beginnig, since  it doesn't want to spoil the story with a coherent process.  Never the less, it's entertsining",1464998400,,150,4.6923076923076925
8712961,3,B00WEAKVEO,"Some people will like this. It's a revenge movie, which I like, but it is one choppy execution of whatever idea this film thought it was supposed to be. All brooding with maybe 2 fight scenes, that were lame. Lots of musing about our roles as good citizens and how much one is supposed to tolerate in this life ie: I'm a decent man with a wife and child, I stay out of trouble but my family is taken from me by violent gang members: it is wrong to hunt them down and whack them? No, it's not. It's wrong to brood about it and when you get the chance to whack them you go on philosophical soliloquies. It is a film trying to be something it's to disorganized to be. 3 stars is generous. But others will like it.",1460332800,3,710,4.078571428571428
