8672484,5,B00MI6DIH6,"I bought this set for my son (4). It comes with 3 dvds. Packing and shipping were better than expected (from Germany).
Each DVD lasts around 1hour.
I wanted to know what episodes came in the box, but couldn't find that info until now. I added pictures with that info.
We also bought the starter box2.
Thanks.",1481587200,,308,4.421052631578948
