8180863,5,B000NQRR48,This was a gift for my aunt for Christmas. She laughed when she opened it but was surprised how many different people/shows are on it and she thought that was cool. She hasn't had time to watch much because there are 10 hours worth but she said it's funny.,1484179200,,256,4.244897959183674

8180865,4,B000NQRR48,"I bought this collection for my folks and for the price you cant beat it. Over 10 hours of the best comedy skits from the golden age of television. Milton Berle, Sid Ceasar, Jack Benny, Lucille Ball, Abbott and Costello, Jackie Gleason and Carol Burnett are just some of the great comedians that appear in this collection.  Also some of the funniest skits from the Honeymooners, I Love Lucy, Allin the Family, the Carol Burnett Show, Soap, and Taxi just to name a few. There are also some really early comedy appearances of George Carlin, Jerry Seinfeld and Gary Sanders. A must buy for fans of comedy.  My only criticism is that the picture quality isn't the best which probably is due to the age of alot of these shows and some duplicate material which is why I gave it 4 stars.",1334707200,4,780,4.485915492957746
8180866,1,B000NQRR48,"This so unbelievably bad it's astounding.  The major problems are:

1.  The editors must figure that TV comedy dies in about 1950.  Mostly a collection of very old kinescopes of the beginnings of movies and TV.  Skelton, Berle, Benny, Gleason, Burns & Allen and Lucy.  All great, but the quality of most of these cuts are real bad.

2.  No closed captioning.  Coupled with the bad sound quality, many bits are impossible to hear and understand.

3.  But the most grievous complaint I have is the repetition.  I didn't count them all.  But, in 6 DVDs, there were at least 4 versions of ""Who's on First"", 2 of Lucy ready to give birth, 3 of Lucy and Ethel in the candy factory, and that's just the ones that come to mind.  What possible justification can there be for this?  These DVDs were made as a set by the same people at the same time.

And by the way, you can find this collection for about $20 less at other places, but it isn't even worth that.

Stay away!!!!",1202601600,18,966,4.337078651685394
