2906236,5,B000TK8NUA,"I am a self-taught motorcyclist since 1989, with years of real-time riding experience on 15 different bikes. I found great tips watching this DVD, & believe any rider can learn something new from Jerry Palladino's coaching.

The production values are superb, with just the right amount of non-corny humor sprinkled thruout.  It's inspiring to watch people handle larger ""baggers"" with total confidence.  Jerry points out mistakes along the way, which makes u feel like ur a member of the class.

Who hasn't watched someone nearly ""dump"" their bike making slow-speed turns? Or dragging their feet in parking lots, a too-common sight.

This DVD was worth every penny and I highly recommend it to both novice and experienced rider alike!",1198368000,24,734,5.1344537815126055
2906237,5,B000TK8NUA,"""Need to Know"" techniques for ALL motorcycle drivers!
I have been riding motorcycles for 40 years. From Mopeds to full blown ""Dressers"".... I WISH I had learned these riding techniques 40 years ago!
Tight turns, quick stops, weaving through obstacles, You NEED to know how to  drive you cycle with confidence & control, this training video is a MUST! Easy when you know how and Jerry makes it easy!
 While there are may motorcycle drivers out there many of them are not very good ones.. This video will give you a way to become one of those 'good' (and safe) motorcyclists on the road (it might even save your life!). Invest a few bucks and then invest a few hours of your time. You WILL become a better bike driver. I did.
 I now drive with more confidence in my driving skills than ever before.
 Thanks Jerry!
 Just my .02 cents.

2906269,3,B000TK8NUA,"Officer Palladino does a great job of detailing the principles of the low speed turn, which has always been a difficult maneuver for novices and experienced bikers alike.  Unfortunately, the monotonous, amateur production methods and his futile attempts at humor look like something out of the 1940's, so it's pretty hard to sit through the whole thing without nodding off. Future viewers of ""Ride Like a Pro"" might want to first make a pot of strong coffee and break their video sessions into several segments to avoid an unplanned nap.  Though I can't find fault with the basic information, I find that it could have been presented a lot more succinctly and professionally. I would also say it's a bit pricey for what it is--if you do well with books, there are cheaper rider skills manuals covering the same principles.",1328572800,,822,4.864285714285714

It's great to be able to pop in the dvd and get a quick refresher on these skills. I ride everyday. In traffic to work and in groups on the weekends, about 10,000 miles a year. I use what is taught in this video constantly. And every time I watch it, I pick up something new or realise a bad habit I've started.
We spend big bucks on shirts, and decals, and patches, and little flashy pieces of chrome, but this might be the best money you can spend on riding next to an Experienced Rider Course.

2906276,5,B000TK8NUA,"This is a really great DVD.  I am new to motorcycling, and have read as many books as I could find, plus have scoured the internet for knowledge as well.  I had taken the MSF basic course years ago, but never bought a bike, and recently took an extra practice course, and bought a bike the next week after.  I had a lot of confidence because I had done real well in the extra practice course.  The bike I bought though was much more powerful and heavier than the bike I rode in class.  All the confidence I gained I lost on my first day out with this new big bike.  I tried to remember and focus on all the lessons I had read and done, but it didn't help.  3 days out and this bike was still more in control of me than I was of it.
  So I found this DVD, got it, watched it all the way through, Cut some tennis balls in half like he reccomends, went out with the practice guide, practiced, rode, practiced some more, went home and said dang I suck, but tried it again the next day.  The second day was a lot easier, and the third much better still.  I still haven't gotten through a lot of the exercises, and I imagine it will take me quite awhile to get through them all.  But my confidence has increased dramaticly.  I now feel totally in control of my bike, and can't wait each weekend to go out and practice some more.
  He lays out the DVD instruction in a very logical and confidence building way.  His advice is very practical and common sense based.  I am now glad I bought a bike that rocked my confidence so greatly.  Had I bought a starter bike I may have never come across this DVD.  He says when you are done with all the exercises, you will be in the top 2% of all motorcyclists, and I believe him.
  If you are interested in improving your skills, are willing to set up courses as layed out in the practice guide, and are able to put in the time to practice, then this DVD is a must buy in my opinion.",1308268800,2,1916,4.056

Mr. Jerry Motorman Palladino is funny and very entertaining to watch.  You learn and laugh at the same time.  He crew of people that are in the video follow his joke and they all make this video great.  He even makes fun of his wife as she misses some turns.

2906288,5,B000TK8NUA,"Ride Like a Pro V on DVD

The host of this DVD (Motorman) is a very engaging speaker. He breaks down the key skills needed for each exercise right away and in layman's terms. While the initial exercises were intuitive, the latter portion of the DVD (mainly the advanced lessons and the Motor Officer Course) began to seem more like cone challenges albeit they do reinforce the previous skills. He did not cover a whole lot about counter-steering or anything above 35 MPH.

There was minimal acting, mostly just Motorman talking. The key takeaway from Ride like a Pro V is that you must use the clutch friction zone, throttle, and some rear brake to keep the bike upright and controllable for low speed (under 15 MPH) maneuvers that one would encounter on the road. I haven't read about these skills being reinforced in any of the popular motorcycle riding literature, including Proficient Motorcycling. Motorman brings out Marianne with a bicycle to demonstrate the effect of dragging the rear brake while applying forward movement, which I thought is a very nice touch.

Overall: 5/5 stars, worthy addition to one's library for improving motorcycle skills.

UPDATE: I used the skills taught in this DVD to help with passing the Motorcycle Safety Foundation's Basic RiderCourse. It takes some practice, but the walking pace exercise and figure 8 are important to passing some of the low speed tests to obtain a motorcycle endorsement.

I also purchased Hahn's Maximum Control, which contains the same concepts found in Ride like a Pro, but is contained in a book. The instructors/authors of Maximum Control are also Motor Officers, so it isn't a surprise the same concepts are reinforced.",1300406400,2,1688,4.971631205673759
2906289,5,B000TK8NUA,"A picture is worth a thousand words, but a video is worth 10,000!  I had already put to use some of these techniques, as learned from the excellent book, ""Maximum Control:  Mastering Your Heavyweight Bike"", by Pat Hahn.  The friction zone, and riding the rear brake, were familiar to me.  I have not, yet, made it to the parking lot to practice, but I have a bagful of tennis balls waiting to be cut in half, for markers, and I have a parking lot to use -- now I just need the weather to warm up...

This video covers many of the techniques found in its sister book, ""Maximum Control:  Mastering Your Heavyweight Bike"", but as it is full-motion video, it really goes much further in teaching the techniques.  Some folks learn better by reading a book, some by a live instructor, some by flogging their way through it, by themselves.  Me, I like to combine all three techniques.  If you have the cash, I recommend Pat Hahn's excellent book, in addition to this video; if money is tight, then I would suggest the video, over the book, unless you learn much better from books, as opposed to videos.

Mr. Palladino injects a little humor into the instructions, which goes a long way towards keeping it lighthearted, and enjoyable.  The B&W video segments of students making mistakes, is actually quite helpful, though sometimes I cringed as I watched their nice bikes kiss the pavement.  If you pay close attention to directions, take your time, and give yourself some leeway (in other words, stay relaxed...), I believe most riders will avoid dumping their bikes while practicing.

I will be sharing this video with my riding friends.  It is worth every penny, in my opinion.  Cheers!",1299110400,2,1681,4.670068027210885
2906290,5,B000TK8NUA,This is definitely one of the most talked about videos over at the HarleyTalking.com discussion forum.

2906293,5,B000TK8NUA,"Even an experienced rider occasionally gets that ""Oops- I'm in over my head"" feeling.  This video goes a long way to teach and show ways to drastically improve control of your bike.  It is not a substitute for anything else you may do to keep growing your skill set, but I find it hard to believe there isn't something extremely valuable here for just about every rider out there.  Even if you have ridden for several decades.

The exercises are instructional even if you do not have a great practice bike with crash bars and 100% protection against dropping your prized motorcycle.  A few of the practice set ups will have to wait until I personally can figure out how to put crash bars on my current raked out chopper.  But by just studying how they are done I have found a couple of practice roads that are slow enough to use as improvement training roads...

Some things like counter steering seemed unnatural for me personally until I modified my bike to get a perfect fit and feel...  You know the litany of bars, seat and pegs...right?  Now I can feel exactly how counter steering moves the bike over in the lane and makes taking corners a total blast.  If you don't fit and balance perfectly a lot of things don't work out right on a motorcycle.  Apparently most guys only give a little thought to getting the bike set up right but for me it is critical as a bad feeling bike drives me nuts...

This video doesn't go into that very much but the instructor at least mentions that some set ups don't fit and even hints that some bikes just don't match certain rider shapes and sizes.  Anyway enough about fit.  The video kicks ass in teaching how to handle basic maneuvers that bring grief to a lot of riders.  And by getting good at cornering and looking out, heads up and pre-planning where the bike is to go you will un learn bad dangerous habits and replace them with good safe and fun new habits.

Getting the basics right sets you up for confidently riding any motorcycle. And it certainly doesn't hurt intermediate to advanced riders to refresh the basics every once in a while. Jerry Palladino's approach is very personable, and he sprinkles a liberal amount of excellent tips throughout which will help in tight situations.  He also clearly advises what exercises are suitable for various skill levels.

2906297,5,B000TK8NUA,"The people that produce this film clearly know what they are doing. They things they do with a big  touring Harley are incredible. I've riden since 1974 an like most people, I thought I knew how to ride. No so.

This film takes you back to the basics and gives you some ideas to try to make you a better rider. I try all the ideas every time I ride. I don't practice in a lot, I just try to ride better eash time out. For me, letting the bike do it's job is the hardest. The look where your going to go really takes a lot of work to get down into a habit.

I practice the friction aspect pretty hard including coming to a complete stop with the ""friction method"" and trying not to put my feet down. I am sometimes rewarded with scraping turns which tells me that I am getting the basics down.

This film is just to get the average riders more experiened rider's perspectives and a place to aim for in their techniques. The film give a pretty good idea what things to do and not do. I however believe that it must be supplemented by the actual advanced course with live instructors to yell at you.

Finally I recommend it to all the riders I know. Naw, I don't need that, I've been riding 30 years. Ya, OK buddy. Me, I want to be a technically perfect rider. You can't get that by doing the same thing for 30 years. Riding is about progression. It's about telling your bike what to do. You just have to learn the subtle inputs that give the bike an idea about what you are trying to accomplish.
