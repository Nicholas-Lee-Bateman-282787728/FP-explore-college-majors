7570579,5,B019EC9RBM,Awesome psychological thriller!  Lots of little nuances that keep you thinking long after the movie was over.  Exceptional acting and quality for a low budget film!!

7570580,1,B019EC9RBM,"I never write reviews. Not ever. However, this film compels me to write one.

Please do not watch this. It is very clear to me that the filmmakers and/or their friends have written positive reviews on Amazon and IMDb to push the sales of this Vod. Trust me when I say that it is 1) mediocre, 2) there are no twists you don't see coming as the other reviews have said, and 3) there is no plot. None. No really, there isn't one.

Please don't waste your money. There is a reason this is a 72 hour rental for $4.99. Go see Star Wars again.",1452816000,3,536,4.095238095238095

7570583,5,B019EC9RBM,Absolutely loved this twisted thriller! Beth Riesgraf (Leverage) kills it as Anna the agoraphobic recluse who after the loss of her brother finds Intruders breaking into her home. There are twists and turns around every corner of this film and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a little suspense in their video library!,1452816000,4,327,4.963636363636364
7570584,4,B019EC9RBM,"This thriller is about a girl named Anna (Beth Riesgraf) who is an agoraphobic who spends her days taking care of her terminally ill brother in their old family home. The two seem to have a strange relashionship, albiet a loving one..

The acting was quite polished (Beth Riesgraf) being the stand out. As for the story, although some may think implausible,wasn't that far fetched. So we as the viewer aren't left thinking ""yeah right"".

  After her brother dies some thugs find out she has a lot of cash in the house.

Three of them break in and terrorize her until she turns the tables on them in a most unexpected and downright bizzare manner. The film also stars (Rory Culkin) as her daily delivery boy.

I found this film to be entertaining and surprising. There is some bloody violence but nothing really gory. The entire film takes place in the house but there are some interesting aspects to the architecture. We find out during the film that not only is Anna agoraphobic but she also has some deep seeded issues stemming from a very bizzare childhood that lends to her psychosis!

Bottom line, its good for a rental and interesting enough to watch because it's pretty original. 3 &1\2 Stars...",1452816000,18,1202,4.668246445497631

The random characterization failures of Annie, going from shrill murderer to a fragile teacup at the interval of a mere camera angle, made this film a chore to watch. Is she evil, is she mentally challenged?

All in all, the plot, the character setup, and the overall backbone of the movie were terribly thrown together, making this nothing more than a 90 min piece of sub-par, mind numbing, entertainment. (If you could call it that)

The trailers did a good job in painting this as a potential diamond in the rough, but this movie, does not take the cake. Acting was also quite a bummer.

I would give this 2.5 stars but there were enough unique aspects to the story, mainly the various mechanisms like the collapsing stairs, remote controlled doors, etc., to raise it up to 3 stars - watchable but not worth a second look.

I am really, really tired of seeing movies about pedophilia and/or incest being used as the cause of mental illness and violence. I know it happens far more than anyone knows - I know that better than most people. And I know the damage it can cause. But it doesn't cause every person it happens to to become a homicidal maniac.

This could have been a really good story, but it lacked focus. The three intruders stumbled around like the Three Stooges. Anna was alternately practically helpless when being attacked, then the next time one of them came at her, she kills him. And why in the world didn't she take the money with her when she left at the end? Why leave it to burn up in the house? With her agoraphobia, the police and firefighters would be looking for her body in the house for a long time, long enough for her to get away. I guess the writers wanted her freedom from her agoraphobia to be the focus. Well, folks, it doesn't happen that way. Just ask anyone who has had a mental illness. Recovery is a slow and painful process and there are setbacks - for every step forward, two steps back. Hollywood is so fond of instant cures, but that very seldom happens in real life. Not saying it never happens, but the percentage is miniscule.

There isn't a whole lot of blood and gore in this movie but when it does happen, we get long, lingering camera shots. I could have done without that, but it's certainly not nearly as bad as a slasher film or most horror films.

My main take from all this: I'm glad I only paid $3.99 to rent it. Wish I'd waited until it was free with Prime.",1498435200,2,1836,4.356725146198831

What could have been a nicely uncompromising, twisted little movie ended up as something much less - motivations were diluted dialogue veered towards cliche and the movie as a whole just copped out about 2/3rd of the way through. I had all kinds of half baked theories as to why it was all happening... and all of them were more original than the actual explanation. but that probably says more about my deviant mind than the movie.

As we all know, scenes are acted out of order yet a good director will make the emotions of a character flow from one scene to the next as if in time. In this case they were too jumpy, erratic. It caused a distraction. As far as I am concerned the acting was good. I believe the actors may get a bad rap in the end however.

You get the who and what from the trailer, just not the why, so i don't think it wouldve changed the star rating im giving. Its just a bland let down. It hits the second act with strong purpose, and you think this girl being victimized is going to flip the switch to calm, twisted psycho mode, like they portray in the trailer.

I really only know her from Leverage prior to this, where I was generally amused by the paradox of her being the worst actor in the cast while playing the most interesting character.
Not sure if she's been working on it or just decided to bring her hidden A-game here, but she knocks a complicated role out of the park, showing a range that's matched by John Goodman in 10 Cloverfield Lane and....little else in the horror field in the last few years, actually. I hope she gets more chances at small budget, small scale horror in the future, it really does make her shine.",1470355200,,720,4.4961832061068705

  The premise to this flick is ludicrous, ""girl is nice, girls is raised by brother after molester daddy dies, molester daddy inspired the kids to build a torture room for molesters, omg, these poor saps that came in to rob the grieving child have no idea what they're in for.""

It's not handled too poorly, but it's a premise that, to me doesn't make for a solid ""revenge/tables turned"" kind of scenario. Too many of these movies are coming out now and trying to ride on hyperviolence carrying them the full run and not story.

My advice is to steer clear of this one, there are MUCH better revenge films out there if you're looking for a cheap thrill.

7571558,5,B019EC9RBM,"There will be spoilers, spoilers there will be. So if you don't want to read them, just know that I really liked this movie, and highly recommend it.

SPOILERS!!!

I enjoy watching and reading about strong women. If they happen to kill someone, well, Im sure there was a good reason. And if they do it in a different way other than using poison, I have to give them mad props. I knew there was more to Anna, thanks to the description, but I was afraid she was going to be timid throughout the whole movie. But when she started killing, I saw there was nothing to worry about.

Beth Riesgrafs (Anna) acting is superb. I first remember enjoying her in Leverage. She was quirky, with just a hint of darkness that would peak out. The casting people must of saw her there too, because she does a great job of looking sweet, and then you see a bit of something not quite right appear.

The movie was a bit slow at first, but they had to establish some back story, and dramatically show you photos of Anna and her dad, so you knew something was up with it. When the men finally break into the house, thats when things get fun but not for them. The house is one giant trap, and they all end up in the basement, where even more horrors await. I had thought at first that they were keeping the dad in the basement, but Im glad the movie went a different route.

Im not going to spoil any murder scenes, although I hate when animals get hurt in a movie. Kill all the people you want, just not the animals! And the final reason as to why Anna is killing is not a big surprise, since, to me at least, it was pretty obvious when you saw the second bedroom in the basement.

But I still highly recommend it, and make sure to keep an eye on Annas facial expressions/transformations. It only enhances the terror in the story more.",1466467200,,1813,4.240579710144927

The movie gets 3 stars from me because it was a bit too rushed. I wasn't asking for a huge amount of blood and gore, just that the storyline could've been explored further and not flung into the mix or near the climax. Plus, the trailer was misleading.

7571676,5,B019EC9RBM,"Intruders (previously called Shut In, which would have been a much better title) was an enjoyable film which combined elements of suspense, thrills and a few surprising plot twists that elevated it from the standard home invasion genre. Though some of the twists were disturbing, they worked.
Riesgraf was stellar, deftly moving between multiple emotions making her take on Anna both sympathetic and hateable. Cinematography was tight and aided in drawing the viewer into the story. Set decoration was for a large part believable, though a few situations seemed contrived. The hair was all over the place, particularly that of Ms. Riesgraf's character, Anna - changing from perfectly coiffed to stringy, then back to coiffed. Note to hair people: continuity does matter! There were times I watched Anna's hair for mistakes more intently than watching what Anna was doing. Wardrobe was mostly good. Anna's bizarre lace dress (an uninspired and blatant ripoff of a famous designer) had multiple continuity issues - even changing floral patterns periodically through the scenes in which it was used. The dress also shifted from form fitting to loose in many scenes. Makeup was ok, though inconsistent, as some characters faces changed from shiny to matte between scenes. Anna's brother seemed overly made-up, particularly in his final scenes. The muffled sound recording quality of Kesy's character bothered me somewhat and I do wish Culkin came across less mousy as a lead. Other continuity issues were mild distractions, particularly the placement of a chest freezer, which moved between shots. I was torn about the ending, but will not reveal why, because spoiler.
In conclusion, I was entertained and never really bored with the film so, five stars. I will watch again and update my review.",1463788800,3,1791,5.222222222222222

The synopsis doesn't really explain either...the main character is afraid to go outdoors, the mystery of the film is WHY..she is not a strong character particularly.

It's better to piece reveals throughout or at least give hints.  But the real problem with this film is that it doesn't have anyone to root for. Anna is a psychopath, the intruders are all one dimensional low-lifes, and Danny is too whiny and passive to root for. So who does that leave? Anna as a protagonist doesn't work because we never really know her motivations and she does too many things that don't make any sense.  And for someone who has built a torture chamber that she lures unsuspecting pedophiles too, she is very unprepared for these three brain dead criminals that stumble into her ""trap"".

7572056,3,B019EC9RBM,"Spoiler Alert!
Intruders is a home-invasion thriller. The victim, Anna (Beth Reisgraf), is an agoraphobe, a person with an abnormal fear of being in public places or open areas. Shes been afflicted with this condition since the death of her father, ten years earlier, and cant even step onto her front porch without suffering a debilitating panic attack.

On the day of her brothers funeral, three thieves break into her house, looking for a large cache of money. Not the brightest bulbs, they are good at posturing but short on advance planning. After they tie Anna up and start looking for the cash, they encounter a series of hidden rooms and booby traps. What at first appears to be a movie about a helpless young woman victimized by frightening criminals turns out to be much more, with Anna not nearly as helpless as she seemed. The house, in a way, becomes a character as it transforms from a typical residence into a virtual chamber of horrors. Revelations about Annas family history explain this unlikely metamorphosis.

Though Intruders has a promising premise and starts well, it turns out to be a hybrid of the Saw movies with a touch of Wait Until Dark tossed in. Director Adam Schindler makes his feature-film debut with Intruders and manages to craft a gripping 90 minutes, despite the films limited budget. Intruders could easily be the dark flip side of Home Alone.

Martin Starr (Superbad, Knocked Up), generally known for comedies, conveys real menace as one of the home invaders and manages some darkly humorous observations as events take consistently unplanned turns. Anna is a complex character, and Ms. Reisgraf conveys the characters disabled vulnerability, later revealing her ingenious, gruesome ways of compensating.

Bonus extras on the DVD release include a behind-the-scenes making-of featurette and audio commentary with cast and crew.",1456444800,22,1867,5.091503267973856

The day of the funeral as she hides in her home 3 intruders break in seeking money and this is where the fun begins.

As I said above, it was good with plenty of traps and blood and some gore to make things interesting but when the truth is revealed it was kind of a let down.

The problem I had with it was not the predictability of the characters or plot but the fact that that the antagonists were not particularly unlikeable.  The main character had her foibles and past, but what seems like a rather common, albeit frightening home invasion, was met with a strange dichotomy of venom and overacting.  The format was flimsy and the home, what with its trap doors and rusty dungeon contraptions, was just plain silly; as was the final scene where our heroine was suddenly and miraculously healed.

7572555,4,B019EC9RBM,Pretty good. The trailer shows the main plot twists and originality of the script. Don't watch the trailer. Just rent the movie and enjoy it.,1453593600,2,141,4.68
7572556,5,B019EC9RBM,This is a fascinating and suspenseful movie with a twist. It becomes obvious that the three crooks broke into the wrong house. The movie moves along very well and maintains the suspense continuously. This is a gruesome movie and definitely not for the faint of heart or for any kids. The underlying story is a sad one but explains the what and why. I thought Beth Riesgraf's acting was superb and excellent. She really gets across the sadness and fear and determination of Anna. She really carries the movie.,1453593600,2,508,4.719101123595506

Suffice it to say some robbers invade a home where they find an agoraphobic woman who has not left the home in ten years. The plot twists begin once they learn all is not what it seems. Solid cast and worth watching. The ending though is a little over the top when the characters have an unlikely conversation about the psychology of their actions, the writer's way of explaining the plot to anyone that didn't keep up. Still a good film.",1453507200,,533,4.287128712871287

It falls into horror cliches by mid way and just should have had a tighter script to avoid that.  The poster is very misleading, with weapons of axes machetes etc. Not representative of the film at all.  It's a disappointment because it could have been so much better.  Wait for netflix",1453248000,2,440,4.64935064935065

Not normally a scary-movie person, but this psychological thriller ticked all the right boxes: well-acted, well-shot, and a great script with some excellent twists and turns.

The characters are all flawed, which makes them all interesting and the dialog is sharp and doesn't fall into the traps and tropes usually found in the genre.

8744899,4,B019EC9RBM,"I read a review that her timid behind change into a something different.  Tis not so.  From the beginning with not leaving since daddy died and the dolled-up room, one can tell there were some daddy issues.  Something leading to abuse.  She is still frightened throughout the film but finds valour in knowing that he brother said he will always be with her.  Therefore, she attempts to do what he would in this case.  However, frightened little Anna is still in her. The film develops well. The part which seems ridiculous is that the petty criminal goes from needing money to instant profiler within minutes of her handing a book/binder. Uhhh...
I disagree with seeing a part two happening.  She is ostensibly too fragile to carry on something like this on her own. She may have become a sociopath due to circumstance but, unlike her brother she is not a psychopath.",1536883200,,867,4.701986754966887

8744904,2,B019EC9RBM,"It's a movie that tries to deny that men are stronger than women, and therefore are often dangerous to women. Notice that in the movie all the men are either ill or of indeterminate sex orthe villainseither physically massive or stupid or cruel and raging. A woman who's trapped in the hands of this second group of men would normally be helpless and doomed. This movie goes to very great lengths to turn that familiar table.

However, to do that it had to postulate an unbelievable past for the family. I think this forced development is the great weakness of the movie.",1536624000,,571,4.598039215686274
