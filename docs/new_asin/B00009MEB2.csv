8220937,1,B00009MEB2,"I have to come out and say that sometimes I seriously hate it when creators try to keep a series fresh. Uncountable sequels and remakes DO NOT keep a series interesting; needless to say, if you're on a fourth installment to a series, then you're more than likely going to mess the whole installment up and need to stop where you are immediately. This much can be said for films and modern video game sequels, anyway; For hentai though, it's a completely different and painful matter.

The Demon Beast Invasion series at one unmentioned point in time decided to pick up where the sixth part left off by literally digging a few graves and resurrecting a myriad of zombies as their fuel for the future installments.
I was actually impressed with the sixth and supposedly final installment of Demon Beast Invasion: there I was sitting with two sequels sided with the original - both being nothing short of bland - stuck in the middle of two dreadful 4th and 5th installments. Then along came part 6, carrying the wish list I sent to tentacle hentai series long ago in hand as it introduced truly new ideas and genuine attempts at revitalizing a series without sacrificing too much in the process by focusing on the parts in the series that actually matter.
Demon Beast Resurrection on the other hand decided to go back to the roots of bog standard tentacle hentai in general by introducing new and shocking ideas to the series that would actually be new if they weren't inspired by the previous works of the original creators. Did you ever see the last few episodes of the Twin Angels series? Remember all the BS you had to put up with including less tentacle scenes that ended in incredulous and tasteless climaxes that were all so short lived you could re-tie your shoelace and miss them? Remember how a single shot of a sex scene from another hentai was used to make up for the apparent lack of artists?
Expect that in Demon Beast Resurrection. A lot of it.

I'm going to avoid the plot because describing it only entices the insurmountable incredulities and contradictions the creators clearly overlooked including continuity, factual errors and common sense. But it's easy to do in this case as the plot to the Demon Beast series has repeated itself a total of four times with little variation: The demon beast has some how survived death (again) and fueled by his blind Oedipus Complex continues to sexually pursue his own mother while occasionally having his way with a few random young ladies along the way. In the end of it all, the eternal dark haired handsome hero of the series makes love to a beautiful young woman (who may or may not be his own lover) that somehow appeases Buddha and kills the demon beast temporarily. That's all the Demon Beast series has been about ever since episode three which Resurrection decides to base itself off of as it involves the adventures of IMO agents BB and Dee who apparently survived the end of that episode.

All of this sounds like a good attempt at building off of old undeveloped characters, but it never happens. They're no longer stoic robot women in tight skimpy clothes, true, but now they're women in tight skimpy clothes who spend most of the episodes crying or  blasting female possessed victims of the Demon Beast into mush.

Which leads me into what really irritated me about this one: This is the only hentai I've seen that takes the hatred of women to a whole new level. Themes of misogyny in hentai can be slightly forgiven seeing how the media itself pretty much means `perversion' in Japanese, but hentai has tried to cover so many sexual perversions that it's hard not to find a series so cluttered and carried down by so many sexual issues it doesn't bury itself in its own crap.
Purgatory introduces a sexual issue that sounds quite promising on paper: add groups of attractive young ladies who spend their time chasing each other on motorcycles while wearing tight, leathery biker duds and encountering a tentacle monster. Ladies, motorcycles, tight clothes and tentacles! That sounds like a pretty unique combination, right? Is there any way it could be messed up?
No matter how you personally intended on answering that last question, I all ready have your answer for you: Purgatory finds a way to mess it up... the WORST possible way.

I should just say that DBR: Purgatory flat out hates female groupies and apparently female groupies on motorcycles because they make up the entire body count in both episodes. When they aren't being horribly murdered in repulsive and highly improbable ways or being possesed and gunned down by high powered laser rifles that even military contractors would stay away from.
Worse, the biker girls in this anime aren't even admired by anyone: they get in frequent trouble with the law seeing how they reportedly disturb the peace by driving in residential zones (despite the fact they're only shown driving through public highways), none of the main characters show any sympathy towards them and the main character they pursue through the anime could give a damn about them. Yet they all seem to collectively by nice young women who just have a need for speed and an admiration complex. What did motorcycle girls ever do to deserve bodily, sexual mutilation? What did they ever do to deserve getting vertically impaled by stupid non-sensical hentai creatures with one too many hydrostatic limbs that just appear out of bloody nowhere!
Even the idea of hot young women riding motorcycles is a big lie. All we see in a few shots are possessed naked women riding through public areas of a city with goofy evil expressions on their faces. Of course this is a hentai taking place in Japan so naturally there aren't any police chasing after them for indecent exposure, but that's it. The anime doesn't go anywhere with it!
You'd think the creators would do something imaginative like a scene where a motorcycle gets possessed by the demon beast or something of the equivalent and makes love to its female rider when she starts it up and it sprouts tentacles. Hell, that sounds better than the ENTIRE hentai! Could you imagine a hentai monster with a throbbing tentacle wang fueled by 2000 ccs and 300 HP? And it would ride itself around taking the woman on a fast paced thrill ride as they literally race into a simultaneous climax?? That sounds GREAT!

I will give credit where it's due, however: Purgatory introduces one new, unique and tragic character to the series who is interesting enough to keep us hooked and sympathize with, but she feels completely out of context. She feels more appropriate for an anime based around street racing or any sort of drama not involving tentacles; she would be the one saving grace in this dark part of the series, but loving a story for only one character in it is not a story worth savoring.

I can't recommend this title in the slightest, even you are a fan of the original Demon Beast Invasion: The continuity between Demon Beast invasion part 3 and Purgatory is almost entirely shattered, the story is a complete cop-out with zero amounts of twists, intrigue and reason and the sex is almost entirely dependent on animated human encounters rather than a bounty of tentacles. Consider the `Not for Kids' warning label a warning for the human species because Demon Beast Resurrection Purgatory isn't Purgatory... it's Hell.",1225497600,2,7368,4.773333333333333
