2523370,3,B000EMGF3U,"As others have said Ian McShane is fun in the lead role, and Patrick McNee makes for an entertaining (if slightly wooden boss cum side kick in two of the stories).

Things have changed a bit from the books but I'd guess that is mostly to do with the Irish/Canadian influences on location filming!

The style of filming and music is rather dated now but that doesn't detract from the entertainment too much.

What does detract from enjoyment is the DVD transfer quality. It looks and sounds as though it has been produced from an old VHS recording. Do you remember the slightly wobbly audio on VHS prior to the introduction of NICAM ?? Well that is what the sound often sounds like. The pictures are grainy and in 'Blood Sport' there were obviously some tape tracking issues or tape damage as there are a few brief episodes where there are distortions and interference typical of a poorly tracked VHS tape.

Overall I have given it 3 stars because the stories are worth watching but the audio and visual quality of the DVD transfer pulls down the score for me.",1113436800,5,1059,4.557894736842106
2523371,5,B000EMGF3U,"three Dick Francis novel to telly-movies McShane did in a joint Ireland/Canada venture. So you are getting three full length movies in this set. Upfront, this is mainly for McShane fans rather than Dick Francis fans. They will be grumped because of the changes in the books. However...
McShane is gorgeous as Francis' David Cleveland, Jock Club Investigator, who becomes involved with three mysterious outside of the track.
In the Frame - Cleveland helps an old friend who has been robbed and his partner's wife is killed. The only trail to solving the murder is a painting that may be a forgery.
Blood Sport - a multi-million dollar stallion was stolen and never seen again. Why would someone steal a horse they could not race or breed?? David is drawn into the mystery in Canada, where he must ride to save his life.
Twice Shy - finds David helping his nephew's guardian. Her husband was killed in a rock climbing accident, and now someone is harassing her. Kidnapping, ransom and a special code of picking winners lead David on a merry chase.
Any McShane fan will wish to add this super buy to their collection.",1071705600,11,1114,4.717948717948718

I don't apologize for that; he made that role.  He was absolutely brilliant and 100% convincing.  He's also fun to watch as David Cleveland, a Jockey Club investigator in these 3 Dick Francis mysteries.  Cleveland is a far cry from the booze-swilling, whore-mongering, potty-mouthed Swearengen, but he still has the ""lady's man"" thing going on.  These mysteries are a bit dated (hairdos, clothing styles), and a bit corny, but they're enjoyable enough on a rainy Sunday afternoon when the track at Aqueduct is too sloppy to watch on TVG.",1239840000,,686,4.771186440677966

2523417,4,B000EMGF3U,"Four stars may be a little generous, but these are good entertainment.  While a close inspection of the novels' main characters over the course of these three stories would be unlikely to yield serio-comic actor Ian McShane, exactly, you need to remember that this is the movies. The silver screen with booming sound, with (British-) Hollywood cliche writ large. Which by definition means license.

There are similarities in both versions of each tale--the written and the filmed--enough to make the latter effort worth watching. Often key scenes are re-located, possibly for the sake of budget or regional availability of preferred actor. Likewise the screenplay often omits what I consider crucial links in plot development (though a veteran of the related novel may grudgingly connect the dots well enough).

The point of this little essay, with its somewhat kvetching praise, is to encourage you to enjoy this video production. But enjoy it as three pretty good films with intrigue and plausible character development, not as really accurate renditions of the novels whose titles they bear.",1168560000,5,1094,5.275862068965517

Upfront, this is mainly for McShane fans rather than Dick Francis fans. They will be grumped because of the changes in the books. However...McShane is gorgeous as Francis' David Cleveland, Jock Club Investigator, who becomes involved with three mysterious outside of the track.

In the Frame - Cleveland helps an old friend who has been robbed and his partner's wife is killed. The only trail to solving the murder is a painting that may be a forgery.

Blood Sport - a multi-million dollar stallion was stolen and never seen again. Why would someone steal a horse they could not race or breed?? David is drawn into the mystery in Canada, where he must ride to save his life.

Twice Shy - finds David helping his nephew's guardian. Her husband was killed in a rock climbing accident, and now someone is harassing her. Kidnapping, ransom and a special code of picking winners lead David on a merry chase.

But these are wonderful miniseries adaptations of Dick Francis's entertaining novels -- In the Frame, Blood Sport, and Twice Shy -- each episode like a full-length movie, filmed chiefly in Britain and Canada.

Ian McShane is an inspired choice for the sleuth character, David Cleveland. He is incapable of uttering a line that does not have a substratum of irony lying beneath it. And these admirably smart TV dramas not only give McShane the scope to develop his talent but permit the lean jockey character, his boss, his babes, the bad guys, and even the horses all to have their place.
