4594794,4,B00579YI1G,"My family took the Meek cut off with Meek in 1845, so I've been looking forward to seeing the movie.  One of my ancestors died on the trail and they sit in one of the few marked graves from that trip.  It's an Indy film for sure. I would be annoyed at the open ending except I know how it ended in real life so I don't have to wonder.  Names of real families in the wagon train were used in the movie.  But there were 200 wagons that broke off to follow Meek, not three.  Oh well, I love the scenery and all the beautiful sunset shots and some of the realism such as harvesting dead bits of  sage brush for fire wood.  I like that the female point of view is a major element of the film.  But I wonder at the sound quality, I have to have the captions on because I can't hear a lot of it... I think it was on purpose to show that the women could barely hear what the men were saying when they were making decisions but I'm not sure.  There are also a lot of scenes that are too dark to view on my computer screen.  I saw all the stuff I was missing when I hooked my computer to my TV.  One warning though, the film does use the ""N"" word in one scene near the start.  It caught my youngest child's ear and I had to do some explaining to him so he could understand why the word was used and that he is never to use that word.  I've watched the movie three times and I see something new each time I watch it.  I think I could watch it many more times and still see something new each time.

The movie starts and ends in the middle of the actual journey that was made.  So that middle part is examined in great detail.  I like the detail; I don't mind that the film did not tell the whole story.  The film did give you the feeling you were really there in the desert thirsty and hungry and confused.  The people who really went on the journey said that no words could ever express what a terrible experience it was.  The movie gives it a good shot... with a few more actors there could have been some deaths to add to the drama and realism but as I understand it most of the 20+ deaths happened after they reached the Dechutes and had plenty of water, it seems that typhoid fever from drinking stale water is what really killed most of them, but it did not kill them until after they had already procured a steady supply of water.  My Ancestor and three others are buried near a major water crossing.  The movie ends well before that particular crossing.

Clearly the film is just trying to capture the feeling of being there lost in the desert and it not trying to show the entire journey.  If I did not already know the story well I might have been disappointed by the film.",1316131200,7,2672,4.045714285714285
4594795,2,B00579YI1G,"I often enjoy art house movies, admire the slower pace of foreign films and dislike Hollywood action blockbusters, but this film felt like I could have walked the Oregon Trail in less time than the film took.  There are many beautiful shots--but virtually nothing happens; many scenes were shot at night and are difficult to see; there is a lot of mumbled, inaudible dialogue;--and it does not end--it just stops.

I also dislike movies which con you by claiming to be based on a true story and using real people's names--but then tell a wholly fictional story.

The film is about people walking in circles--and that is what the director did as well.

It is fashionable in certain elitist circles to snobbily denounce those who favor films with a clear beginning, middle and end as requiring spoonfeeding, etc. Nonetheless, this film could have been just as beautiful and far better, if if it had an end, instead of taking a very long time to just wander aroudn the middle.  It is not that a viewer wanting a clear ending is seeking an easy answer; it is that a director who does not provide an ending--after spending an hour on the simple question of which of 2 guides to follow--is taking the easy way out, as well as cheating the audience.",1316131200,5,1242,4.627272727272727
4594796,2,B00579YI1G,"If you're looking for an action packed movie, you'll be disappointed with Meek's Cutoff.  My family was looking forward to watching a great Western. Critics rated this movie highly; it wasn't shown in our area so we waited patiently until we could rent the movie. We watched it on Time Warner tonight & I must admit we were disappointed. The movie moves along very slowly; however, as I watched the movie, I reminded myself that covered wagons moved slowly.

Showing the blackness of night, the lonely expanse of the way West, the  thirst of the pioneers & livestock,  the dirt that doesn't get washed away from their faces, body & clothes, etc. & obstacles that  covered wagons faced, Meek's Cutoff  depicts how slow, monotonous, dangerous & physically taxing a settler's life on a wagon train was.  Many times the audio is very, very hard to hear. We had to turn our sound system up full blast & still could barely hear some of the conversations. Thank goodness for closed captioning (which at times was removed from the screen too quickly read).

I didn't research the movie until after we watched it & found that it is  loosely based on an actual 1845 event. I wish the movie followed history more closely. The movie didn't make it clear to me why 3 families decided to break away from their Wagon Train to pay/follow Meek, who said he knew another way around.  Historically, I learned that 200 wagons with 1000 pioneers made the choice to break away from their wagon train. Meek was paid to lead them  along an unmarked shortcut that would hopefully bypass a rumored Indian attack.

Definitely not a Western in the style  I'm accustomed to watching, Meek's Cutoff depicts life on a wagon train more realistically.  Yes,  I felt the pioneers' hardship, thirst & anxiety; yes, I felt like I was in the middle of a desert in the blackness of night; yes, I wondered what decision I would make & who would I follow, and yes, I felt the realism of not knowing when I would find life sustaining water. However, for me, the movie was too slow, had too many totally black or almost totally black scenes when only dialogue could be heard, too many walking scenes  &  many times we  barely heard the conversations & this was with our sound system turned all the way up.  And, the ending...well, it just ended.  I understand wanting to depict the stark realism of what the settlers faced, but I don't have to be hit over the head with it the entire movie.",1315180800,3,2448,4.583908045977012
4594797,4,B00579YI1G,"""Is he ignorant, or is he just plain evil?"" Three families decide to
start a new life in 1845 Oregon. They hire master guide Meek
(Greenwood) to lead them along the Oregon Trail. When a shortcut turns
out to become dangerous Emily (Williams) begins to openly question his
abilities. This is one of the rare westerns that have been released in
the last 10 years. A good one, almost a great one. While this movie
does have it's slow moments the scenery and acting (an all star cast)
more then make up for it. This is one of the independent movies that I
talk about when i say that big budget movies that are crap get more
publicity then the little ones that need it, and are 1,000,000 times
better. This movie also has two of my favorite underrated actors in it,
Bruce Greenwood (in an Oscar caliber role) and Will Patton. This is one
great movie. Overall, not only one of the best westerns in the last 10
years, but one of the best movies period. Watch this, it's awesome. I
give it an A-

Would I watch again? - Probably",1314316800,5,1020,4.3125
4594798,5,B00579YI1G,"The film opens with a shot of men slowly pulling wagons and oxen across a shallow river. Later a woman, fearful after encountering an Indian, slowly loads a musket taking minutes to fire just two shots. At one point a broken wagon axle is fixed by slowly cutting and narrowing a log only so that they can continue to walk across the open plains of the west as the sun bears down upon them, their water supplies dwindling and the threat of Native attacks growing. To guide them through it all is a ragged looking man who boasts about his past experiences while the rest of the group contemplate killing or abandoning him due to suspicions of his ignorance or evil as they continue to wonder helplessly into the unknown, lost and fearful. All these actions and observations are seen through a very subtle but meticulous lens making ""Meek's Cutoff"" a minimalistic western that is less about the journey, or its outcomes, but rather the experience, the uncertainty and the sense of distress in uncharted lands.

Some of my favorite films focus less on telling a conventional or defined story but instead are simply examinations of a time and place and the people that inhabited them; ""Meek's Cutoff"" is exactly that. It transports you with its meticulous detail to setting and aesthetics, along with its slow burning and ever growing tension filled pace, to the unexplored territories of the West, where people left their homes with the dreams of making something for themselves. Many died and the passage was harsh, it was about survival and challenged even the toughest of men which is exactly what Kelly Reichardt set out to portray here. Her film is an examination of complex human issues seen through the eyes of its characters. It is a bold move by a talented director in a time in which it seems that unless there is an explosion to mesmerize the crowd or layers or obvious exposition slapping the audience across the face then people will not give something their full attention or even bother seeing it. Luckily for those of us looking for more there are still directors willing and more importantly able to dabble in the world of delicate, enigmatic and challenging film making.

What might especially turn some off here, which in fact is the films most important and damn near perfect aspect, would be the ending. Though some might call it ambiguous, as it ends abruptly, the truth is the ending is already written in history. There are not many possible outcomes to their journey and one can easily assume which is bestowed upon them, but it is that acknowledgement of the unknown, the troubling sense of uncertainty of which path to take, who to trust, North or South, what will be over the next hill; these were the decisions left in the hands of those brave, downtrodden or perhaps dumb enough to risk their lives, and the lives of the ones they loved, to travel West.  It is in knowing this that makes the final shot so incredibly powerful and all too fitting for a film whose characters faced the same chances of their stories or lives being cut short as the rest marched on, thirsty, hungry and timidly into the vast unknown.

On top of all this is a wonderfully eerie score and beautiful cinematography in which the narrow frame creates a further sense of claustrophobia and helplessness among the open plain. Lastly there are the fantastic performances, especially by Michelle Williams and Bruce Greenwood, all of which making it easily one of the best and definitely one of my favorite films of 2011.",1313539200,6,3517,4.741830065359477
4594799,5,B00579YI1G,"This is the most realistic film about travel across the old West that I can remember ever seeing. I'd recommend having at least one LARGE glass of water while you watch, so everything is SO dry! This is the old West as it presumably REALLY was, with not much excitement or pleasure for a group of people following the Oregon Trail to a (hopefully) better life. Don't expect a shoot-em-up or movie with a lot of excitement; just sit back and be glad it wasn't YOU in this story! Good acting from the entire cast; Bruce Greenwood is a little scary in a standout performance.",1313539200,4,572,4.457142857142857
4594800,3,B00579YI1G,"Meek's Cutoff is an ambitious film trapped by a budget too low to properly realize it. The film is based on an actual event that took place in 1845, although it bears little semblance to those events.

The plot, here goes;

Seven, count 'em, seven settlers (not including the fetus inside the pregnant lady) in three, count 'em, three wagons cross the forbidding Oregon desert trusting their lives to their incredibly hairy guide Stephan Meek (played by Bruce Greenwood). It's clear from the get-go that Meek has no clue as to where they are at, much less if they are heading in the right direction. But since any decision they make could be just as bad, they decide to keep following Cousin It...I mean, Meek until they run across one, count 'em, one Native American who may know the right way...or not.

On the plus side, the framing of the landscape, the sparse dialogue, and solid acting elevates this effort above the average ""indie"" fare. Lead by the really fine Michelle Williams (who bears a strong resemblance to Renee Zellweger), the rest of the cast follow admirably, especially the aforementioned Greenwood, Shirley Henderson (best known as ""Moaning Myrtle"" from the Harry Potter series), and Rod Rondeaux who plays the Native American in such a way that we have absolutely no clue what his intentions, if any, he has.

Indeed, the very subject matter of how people react in this particular type of situation is enough to generate a palatable tension as they press on into the wilderness. There is also a strong attention to the ""details"" of frontier life. The gathering of wood, the keeping of fires, the attention to the water supply that helps set the proper mood.  Speaking as a amateur historian, there was nothing terribly out-of-place about the clothes, tools, and firearms we see on the screen (the flintlocks were certainly appropriate). I do question the all-metal handles on the buckets and perhaps the general style of the woman's clothing as being more post-Civil War. But even if I'm right, such things tend to get overlooked anyway and it certainly didn't stand in the way of my enjoyment of the film.

On the down side, the limited budget undercuts a great deal of that very tension. Settlers in 1845 didn't cross the street with only three wagons, much less the 1,500 miles to Oregon. But even putting that historical error aside, the party is so small that even if they had stuck to the trail and caught every break, it's almost impossible to see how they could make it. All it would take is some bad weather or running across the wrong type of folks (in effect, bandits) or sickness which would wipe them out.  So given the odds, our band of intrepid heroes is doomed from the start and the film becomes a waiting game to see what unfortunate event will eventually do them in.

Also, one sub-plot of a child's discovery of gold is dropped almost as soon as it's brought up and the other characters' reaction to this claim, particularly Meek himself, is impossible to believe. Even if you're stuck out in the middle of nowhere, far from any known source of water, it would take only a few seconds on horseback for any of the characters to verify the child's story. Yet no one does a thing save for one settler who sets up a ""marker"" so flimsy that a gentle gust of wind would topple it over.  And even though there was a reported ""discovery"" of gold made during the actual event in 1845 (something that has not been verified to this day), why include such a ""non-event"" in the film itself?

As for the ending, which has generated some controversy, all I can say is that it fits pretty well with what such a low budget film is capable of. So while I wasn't all that miffed, many in the theater I watched the film in were not so generous. Perhaps having invested so much, they were naturally disappointed when it didn't pay off in any direct way.  At least the theater staff could be glad that no one thought to bring a bag full of vegetables along.",1310083200,36,3977,4.611032531824611
4594801,1,B00579YI1G,"This is not a comment on the film itself; this is a comment on the Amazon product. The audio for this purchase isn't working properly. There is only audio for background or atmospheric sounds and no audio for dialogue, thus, the film is unwatchable.

4594802,4,B00579YI1G,"A couple of families (connected somehow but how I forget) hire a guide to take them to western Oregon in the mid-1840's to hopefully cash in on a gold rush.  Having conquered the Rockies, they are optimistic that the dry, rolling brushland of eastern Oregon will soon be behind them.  Their vigilant guide, having noticed an American Indian on their tail, captures him and tries to compel him to give up a nearby source of water.  The problem is, the Indian knows no English and the crude signing the White Americans try does not seem to register either.  Initially, the would-be settlers are a bit antsy that comrades from the Indian's tribe would attack.  This fear is unfounded - in fact, all they have done is simply add to their overburdened lot another mouth to feed, another glass to fill.  I'm a bit mystified by many of the reviews of this film.  It seems to have completely sailed by the minds of many that this is a horror/suspense film done as a Western.  You have kindhearted families following a guide who knows nothing, scared out of their wits that Indians will attack them, rape them and kill them, only to find that there's no one around, no water around and that even the Indian seems to be making his peace.  That leaves only the settlers with virtually nothing left off of which to survive.  When the camera fades, you know what will happen.  The same kind of scenario took place time and again when would-be-settlers headed West - it's just that they never lived to tell us.  I believe this film is trying to get that across.",1499731200,,1547,4.5451263537906135
4594803,1,B00579YI1G,"It's impossible to write a spoiler to this movie because literally, nothing happens.  A small band of settlers meanders through desolate terrain stopping at nightfall to discuss whether or not their guide really knows where he's going.  They eventually pick up an Indian and start following him, stopping each night to discuss whether or not he knows where he's going.  That's it.  The movie slowly and monotonously drags you to its end answering none of these questions.  You are left with the band of settlers still wandering through desolate terrain, still wondering if the Indian or the guide either one knows where they are going.  The irony of the frustration at the movie's ending is not that you wish you knew what happened to the characters, because the dialog is so minimal and uninteresting that you never feel invested in them.  The frustration comes from realizing you've just spent almost two hours waiting for something to happen and nothing ever does.  Not even the scenery is interesting.",1498089600,,1005,4.976047904191617

The plot is ill-defined, characterizations are well-portrayed but little leadership as it teeters on the brink between boredom and bereavement for having wasted the money. Not really a movie; more like an animated documentary  about traveling Westward on the Oregon trail with a hired guide whose credibility is doubtful more to the audience than to the characters and we meet a Paiute Indian and unbeknownst to us seems to tell the characters where they can find water.

4594807,5,B00579YI1G,"I've seen all the films made by director Kelly Reichardt and writer Jon Raymond, including the very acclaimed Wendy & Lucy. My favorite is Meek's Cutoff.

Many commenters here seem to be expecting a more typical cinematic experience, a typical unrolling of typical plot with typical thrill-ride climax and some kind of comforting denoument. If that's what you're looking for? Meek's is not going to be your cup of tea. Go rent Pretty Woman or something.

If you're in the mood for something more contemplative, unusual, and slow-paced, Meek's might be for you. For me, sense of place in a film is like its own character, it's more important than the usual MacGuffin plotline complications. Here, the desert of Eastern Oregon holds its own as a co-star. (""Man vs. Nature"", my high school English teacher would say.) The grinding dailiness of the pioneers' lives is allowed to unfold in both beauty and tedium. One feels that the desert will go on forever. The women will work themselves to the bone, often for inscrutable reasons: does it really matter if the bonnets are starched white and clean in the middle of freakin' nowhere? Why does everyone build their own fire?

Michelle Williams' performance is a stunner. She's a unique leading lady of our times, layering vulnerability with a range of roles she inhabits physically and vocally. Not quite Methody enough to be a Streep, but definitely not stuck in playing herself-in-various-period-costumes or herself-as-various-big-cartoony-archetypes, as some of today's top female actors do. Here she is tough, sharp, and beaten, all at once. Wonderful on the screen.",1491609600,2,1616,5.113636363636363

Meek takes the three families away from the main wagon train, seeking a quicker way to reach their destination, thus, the title, ""Meek's Cutoff.  While hailed as a director ""masterpiece"" by some critics, don't get roped into this boring directionless film.  I found it to be completely useless.  I wasted nearly 2 hours watching this drudgery limp along scene after scene.  One critic compared the tension of this film to a Hitchcock classic.  Ha!  It's nowhere close to a Hitchcock comparison.  I found it boring, no driving plot line, and scene after scene of their wagon train rolling on by with no dialogue but that of a squeaky wheel hub.  The characters are without interest.  They have no personalities that are compelling.  They capture an Indian, and then don't know what to do with him.  They run out of water.  They are low on food.  The ending is abrupt and leaves the viewer wondering how any director could end a film this way.

As a viewer of all the great and not so great westerns, this is a true sleeper - literally.  I strongly advise you to not purchase or watch this film.  It will let you down and you will wonder, as I did, how a film can be this bad???

You have to watch this film closely. No one says anything much - just as well too: the volume on this DVD is set quite low.

It's an anti-hero film.
The mountain-man guides the party west to civilization, and gets lost.
He likes the female lead but she says that he does not understand women. She gets lost too as womanhood in the West is no one's

saviour, nor are they friendly to strangers, particularly.
But she sees an image of the kindred spirit in the Indian captive and saves his life.

There are a lot of textual and political juxtapositions in this film which take way, actually, the traditions of the Western and infuse it with a scenic gravity that flumoxed a lot of critics. It's a quiet film. Old America was probably really like this.
Such travellers really did, I'm sure, cross rivers holding bird-cages above their heads, with bonnets on and grim tones to their mien.

It's a film to watch many times - I've seen it twice already and once at the cinema.

The problems they encounter are just as I read - lack of water for themselves and the animals, lack of grazing land for the animals, the hot sun, dust, difficulty in maneuvering the wagons over and down inclines, having to get rid of personal possessions to cut the weight of the wagons, etc.

Where the movie disappoints is in the ending.  I won't spoil it for you; but you are left hanging.  For some, the movie will seem to drag; but it actually heightens the way it actually was.  Days of trudging hopefully 10 miles under extremely adverse conditions.

If you're interested in this era, watch it, but know that the ending will be less than satisfying.",1439164800,,1142,4.473429951690822

4594931,5,B00579YI1G,"I described ""Meek's Cutoff"" (2010) to a friend, ""For fans of independent films, it's 104 minutes of licking the icing off chocolate cake."" Director Kelly Reichardt redefines the Western genre with this somber tale of three families crossing the Oregon badlands together by covered wagon in 1845, but don't let the seemingly dull and uninteresting setup dissuade you from watching: the action isn't found in adjective riddled dialog or in tracking shots following bonnet-adorned women trudging in the dust behind creaking wagons, but in the unspoken complications of the characters' interaction and mounting mistrust of each other (and of each others' judgement) as their situation deteriorates from unpleasant and exhausting (imagine walking across the desert to Oregon) to urgent, life-threatening and desperate.

Many viewers will lose patience and give up in the middle of the second reel, complaining that the pacing is ""too slow"" or that ""nothing's happening"" or that ""it's not interesting at all."" But that is asking to have your cake and eat it too, and all at once. Meek's Cutoff does not reward its audience with immediate Hollywood-style gratification, or attempt to handhold impatient viewers by offering pat explanations and solutions, neither does it pander to the popcorn crowd by including gratuitous romantic side plots or Wild West-style gunfights and shootouts.

Could be ""real life troubles"" in 2015 don't quite prepare audiences for real life complications in 1845. Cell phones, connectivity and bank cards are essential if we're to feel empowered and in touch, but the downside to earbuds and tablet swipes is a rim shot-short attention span intertwined with a double latte splash of arrogant detachment.

Tension, fear and anxiety must be purposefully assembled, element by unsettling element, if our suspension of disbelief is to support the terrible weight of dread, or joy, that lies just over the horizon. Or does it? But certainly tomorrow will deliver the answer beyond the next ridge. Surely we'll know by the end of the day ... or will we?

IMDB.com - private users gave Meek's Cutoff just 6.5 stars. I'm giving it 9, and each one is solid gold.",1438732800,,2175,5.2057142857142855

It is okay to be a little creative with trying to recreate what the pioneer experience was like, such as having night scenes be totally dark.

Blindly following a leader without questioning their means or methods leads to frustration - and potentially- disaster. Placing all focus on  destination without consideration of how you get there leads- not  'living in the moment'-  isn't living - it is an endless torment.",1423267200,6,774,4.9689922480620154

My great great great grandparents came to Oregon in 1853 on a wagon train led by a man named Elliot who took them up on Meeks Cutoff...the cutoff was just a trail that had not really been prepared for wagons to traverse. This 200 person wagon train was bogged completely down in rocks, sinking sandy soil and wasted almost 2 months finally stopping at what is part of the McKenzie Pass leading down into a town named Lowell. One of the scouts trying to find the way down was riding a very pregnant mare and when they arrived at what is now Lowell, she gave birth to a dead foal. The scout was so starved that he built a fire and started to roast the colt. Some homesteaders there saw his smoke and went to investigate. The scout told them about the 200 person party that was stuck up in the mountains and starving and the people of Lowell sent riders into Springfield and Eugene Oregon and they mounted a rescue with 40 wagons of supplies and food and got those folks off that mountain pass and down into the valley....they were one week from becoming another Donner party when they were found. And if those kind folks hadnt gotten my family off that mountain...well I wouldnt be typing this right now. I will post a review after I have seen this movie.

4595010,1,B00579YI1G,"Opinions are subjective to each person and relative when it comes to genres of films, but when it comes to `Meek's Cutoff', Rotten Tomatoes states that the consensus of the critical community is, ""Moving at a contemplative speed unseen in most Westerns, `Meek's Cutoff' is an effective, intense journey of terror and survival on the untamed frontier."" While the film could to an extent be called contemplative and maybe even effective, an intense journey of terror and survival it is not. `Meek's Cutoff' is as pretentious as anything can be and maybe one of the worst films I have ever seen. While out-in-out crap like, `Disaster Movie' and `The Last Airbender' makes you feel sorry for yourself for ever having sat through it, pretentiousness like `Meek's Cutoff' and `Sucker Punch' just makes you mad because the overinflated egos of their directors are right in your face. Allow me to explain in intellectual terms how this is so. If there are spoilers, well: fair warning.

-The first and most glaring issue I have with this movie is that it doesn't need to be 104 minutes long. If you thought the `Hobbit' movies were bad, geez, you have no idea what you're getting into here. There is only enough story, plot, and character here for a 15-20 minute short film, at best. Watching this movie is a chore because at least 90% of the total runtime of this movie is just filler. I get that the film is trying to stress how monotonous and how much of a chore going west on wagons was, but even still, this needs an editor.

-These characters aren't characters because they are totally devoid of any actual humanity. They aren't human. They lack humor, warmth, and magnetism; they lack interests of their own, they lack anything COMPELLING about them. They lack humanity in everything but the absolute minimalist definition of the word 'humanity'. We only watch them because of their places on a wagon train bound westward and nothing more, and even then we watch them but we do not care in the slightest what happens to them.

Meek himself, probably the most interesting of all the characters here, is a stereotype with only 2 dimensions at best (you only remember his name because of the title). Michelle Williams' character only seems to get screen time from amongst the characters of the group is only because she's played by Michelle Williams. Paul Dano and Will Patton? Mumbled through most everything they said and ineffectual at most everything else. There was absolutely no reason at all for actors of their caliber to appear in this schlock. You might remember their faces, but you don't remember their characters.

To stress this point: THESE CHARACTERS RARELY, IF EVER LOOK EACH OTHER IN THE EYE (which, when watching the film for the first time, I thought to myself that not even the actors regard their characters as actual people worth investing in). This makes it look like these characters aren't actually trying to communicate with one another (despite the script) and this kind of problem is systemic throughout the film. They stare at items or give each other looks like they're staring beyond them, coming off less as exhausted and more as apathetic. They mumble AT EACH OTHER as opposed to talking with each other like actual people, reminding me of the worst of Mumblecore films. I don't know if it's the actors, the director, the script, or some combination thereof, but the result here is the flattest, most boring characters I've ever seen in a film.

Then, there's this: why does the film take the vantage point of the women, such ineffectual, such in-the-dark, such insignificant characters here that it boggles your brain? No, seriously, think about this. Why on earth does Michelle Williams have to be the main character? Is she or any of the other women really the character with the most advantageous viewpoint with which to tell this story? REALLY? Why not any of the men since they're involved in the decision making? Why not Meek? WHY NOT THE INDIAN??? I don't know, but it's almost as if the film chose the least capable of characters here in fleshing out this story just so it could say it has a feminist slant to it. It's almost counter-feminist because Michelle Williams has such a poorly realized character.

-The Cinematography is just bad, maybe the thing that irked me the most about this film.

First, there's the aspect ratio. Kelly Reichardt does not know how to go full frame and it does more harm than good. In terms of how the movie looks, it looks like a movie made for television. In terms of aesthetic, given that these characters are stuck in a vast and open expanse and are lost, a widescreen aspect ratio like 1:85 or 2:35 would've worked much better so the expanse they are in could overwhelm them. It is instead cut off by the bars to the left and right, diminishing any impact.

Instead, the aspect ratio comes off as a cynical calculation on the part of the director and maybe the producers in Post-Production to get more footage to shove into the final edit. What am I getting at? When a character is walking across the entirety of the frame or walking into frame, usually with about 10 seconds before they even appear in frame, to me, it comes off less that the aspect ratio was chosen for an actual artistic purpose and more that it was chosen just so they could crop out the parts of the frame where the actors started and stopped before/after the director called, ""Action!""/""Cut!"", thus giving the director up to an extra 15 seconds more footage on either end of a shot to shove into the final edit. There are 300+ shots in this film according to some estimates, and I'd reckon about half are shots just like or very similar to the one I described. If this was done to all 150 of those shots and the average amount of footage the director shoved into the edit was about 10 seconds worth, we're looking at about 1500 seconds worth. In other words: 25 MINUTES. 25 MINUTES OF USELESS FOOTAGE IN A 104 MINUTE FILM. Trying to then pass that kind of thing off as Art... How many times have I used the word 'pretentious' in this review?

Then, just because every now and then they decide to put someone in silhouette doesn't make the lighting any good. At night, it's too murky, too underexposed (to the point that in some scenes I thought we were following a different character than Michelle Williams). The lighting is flat in day scenes where the color lacks pop and the textures lack grit or softness. In some shots, there is no sense of depth because everything is too evenly lit. But, none of it is as bad as the framing, which is as uninventive and undecided as the characters themselves.

Just because you capture a pretty sunset on film doesn't mean that there's excellent framing. It only means that was a pretty sunset and nothing more. The Eiffel Tower is a majestic and beautiful work of Art, but with poor framing anyone can make it look like an uninspired piece of craftsmanship. That's what `Meek's Cutoff' does here. There's no dynamics to nearly every scene, as the actors keep dictating the pace of the shots. The best they got is the kind-of Mexican standoff with the Indian, Meek, and Michelle Williams. Otherwise, every character is either sitting, walking, or being a center-frame portrait lacking in characterization and nuance.

Watching someone from afar and seeing every mundane task in long take at a flat angle under flat/poor lighting is BORING. Yeah, the hands-off approach lends the feel of observation and thus gives the film its only high mark of atmosphere (yay for monotony!), but it does everything to ensure the lack of that necessary feeling of grit, does everything to ensure a severe lack of interest on the part of the audience, does everything to (ironically) undercut the feminist POV of Michelle Williams' character when we are observing her, and it does everything to ensure that the movie feels like it doesn't have a soul. Unlike a film like `All Is Lost', where you watch a character go through mundane tasks, the Cinematography here lends practically no sense of conflict. Conflict is the most necessary component of narrative storytelling outside of character, and this film has a severe deficit of it because of the Cinematography. In fact, the scene featured in the poster where Michelle Williams whips out a shotgun is only accidentally lended a sense of conflict, because in the end, nothing happens from there because the camera remained at a standstill from afar.

This all leads me to this: It's undisciplined, with no sense of purpose behind the decisions with regards to this shot or that shot because the only idea the filmmakers had was to try and drive home the monotony of this story. When you want to drive home the idea of monotony, why do you have a story with elements like racism, mistrust, or paranoia?

Sheesh, where's John Ford when you need him?

-The editing job this film has is among the worst editing jobs I have ever seen a film display. There is no drive to the film. No creativity with the rhythm. No sense of direction. NO SOUL. The editing reminds me of the short films I see film students make, in that they're edited by Directors who couldn't let go of the things that made a day on set feel worth it; it's the gratuitous attention to minor, mundane details on props, costuming, and the like, and the editing here is trying to cram all of it in. Like I said, this is a film that shouldn't have been 104 minutes long. It feels twice that length. The long uncut scenes come off only filler and nothing more. With actors driving the rhythm of these scenes, the film comes off as uneven because the actors pace different scenes differently. As such, with different scenes paced differently, the film comes off as badly structured. It is 40 minutes before a rogue element is introduced in the form of the Indian, and because of the way scenes are allowed to play out onscreen, that rogue element becomes a mute point.

-This film doesn't feel written, and I mean that in a bad way. It's like this film completely and utterly abhores the rules of Narrative Cinema. It wants to break those rules, but it doesn't know how and it makes the audience suffer for it. It's like someone making bad jokes because they're not funny. Yeah, it makes something unique, but it doesn't make it friendly. The dialogue is generic Art-House mixed with Mumblecore mixed with a bad Western. There's no feeling of structure, no meaningful characterization, nothing that constitutes writing in any meaningful way. The only positive aspect I can say it has is that it made the importance of water important to the viewer. Shame it had to waste its time meandering from idea to idea and from nowhere to even more nowhere.

Not only that, but the ending is terrible. You could say it cuts off meekly. It cops out, like the filmmakers were running out of film from their week's shoot and needed to come up with some sort of ending. HOW DOES IT END? They find a tree. The End. Nothing solved, nothing answered, hell, not even more questions are asked. Now the audience that finished sitting through it can seethe with rage at having spent the last hour and a half watching this crap. Any points the film is trying to make are suddenly rendered mute because it ultimately turns out there was nothing to be said. It hammers down the fact that this film is so vague about its ideas, so broad in its answers, that it feels like whatever screenplay there was just a short film to begin with...

A Short film... Like the kind someone makes if they want to submit it for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. A theory: The producers had this screenplay for a Short Film that'd be 15-20 minutes long showcasing the hardships and problems of settlers on the wagon trail going out west It'd just show settlers on the trail and their hardships: a snapshot of a time long since past. Maybe have a celebrity or two like Michelle Williams or Bruce Greenwood headline it so it gets the attention of the Academy voters. That strategy has worked before for short films that starred the likes of Paul Giamatti or Brendan Gleeson. But, then they realize that these shorts rarely if ever make their money back, so they decided to hire a few B-list celebrities like Paul Dano and Will Patton to fill out the ranks of the other minor characters and decided to stretch their short film screenplay into a feature length film without adding anything new or meaningful. They'd then make it in a week in a few desolate locations out west with some generic Western props and costumes on loan with a director that calls herself an artist and pass it off as an `Art film'. After that, they'd watch the Critical Community rave about it because they're afraid to look like idiots if they say they don't like or they don't understand it. It might not win an Oscar (because even they know better than to nominate trash like this), but it'd make back its small-for-Hollywood budget and have warm critical praise. WHY NOT DO THAT?

Because the audience didn't really figure into their ideas, that's why.

-So, how is the film pretentious? The better question is: how is it not? The only positives I can think of are the atmosphere and Bruce Greenwood, who is nearly unrecognizable as Meek. Otherwise it is simply poorly made, horribly padded schlock designed to make me angry. There is no reason this film should ever have been made as anything other than a short film. The film does nothing new and has nothing new to say. Yes, Indians were treated badly, not like `Dances With Wolves' or any other number of Westerns have happened to tread similar ground from the White Guilt department. Yeah, women on the wagon trail faced quite a series of challenges, but `Westward The Women' did it way back in the 50s, better and with more feeling. Any other number of Westerns have tackled the ideas of incompetence but this film only treads a path well trodden in that regard.

The film's greatest sin, though, is because of its overinflated sense of self-importance, `Meek's Cutoff' fails to make a proper emotional argument, like the speaker is more important than the idea. It wants to raise questions on a thematic level, but not offer anything in the way of answers, not even more questions. `Meek's Cutoff' is a film that is a mile wide and only an inch deep. At least with Terrence Malick, Nicolas Winding Refn, and other Art House directors their films don't serve as a platform for us to kiss their butts because they demand us to.

If from what I read about the film after watching it, like how this was supposed to be some sort of allegory about the leadership of President George W. Bush, why did it have to be so vague, so monotonous, and why do so when Oliver Stone certainly did it better in his flawed, but pointed film `W.', when in a SINGLE, brilliant scene, Stone depicts and brilliantly skewers the former President and his leadership skills when he leads his cabinet to nowhere and gets lost on his own ranch? I call poppycock!.

So, going into this, what did I want out of it? Well, let me tell you: I didn't want to watch something so poorly shot. I didn't want to see a story so poorly told that I'd be calling out one crap aspect of the film after another from the beginning to the end. I didn't want to feel like I wasted my time and I certainly didn't want to be pissed off. Instead, I would have liked to enjoy myself. It's the least I ask for with any given film, Art House or otherwise. 'Meek's Cutoff' is a sorry excuse for a film and everything I hate about Art House Cinema. It would be too soon if I ever watch it again as to say I hate this movie is kind of an understatement.",1416787200,4,15687,4.625134649910233

4595015,5,B00579YI1G,"The first ""rule"" you teach a young writer is that you should always start your story at the beginning and end it at the end. This may seem like axiomatic advice, but often young writers want to cram as much detail and back story into their work because they have not yet learned the craft of writing. However, good writing is difficult and often requires a lot of editing to pare down the text into something that actually resembles a story. Too much exposition is boring or, at least, unnecessary to the story at hand. Every detail, line of dialogue and scene must work to serve the story - anything else should be cut.

The second ""rule"" young writers are confronted with is that once you know the rules you can then break them. Meek's Cutoff is a master-class in the second ""rule"".

Meek's Cutoff is set in covered wagon times in the American west (Oregon country) and follows the travails of three families, a guide named Meek and eventually a Native American from the Cayuse people. These are the facts of the film and they are not in dispute. However, we are told nothing as to how these three families came to be settlers, where they came from or even what they hope to find when they reach their destination. The film drops us into the story as the small band is already far into their journey and already lost in the vast expanse of the American west.

The opening shot, and this is where writing students should take note, is that of a river or, more importantly, water. Water and the life it provides are the ultimate stakes that drive this film. Everything depends on these characters finding water be it their relationships to each other or the decisions they make in the course of the film. The premise of finding water seems straight forward enough too, however, Meek's Cutoff turns a fairly simple premise into high-art. Meek's Cutoff film mostly deals with the women of the group. The women wash the clothes, tend to the animals, collect kindling and do the cooking. The men - well, the men ""lead"" the group. Yet we do not get the point of view of the men here, we only see what the women must deal with. In fact even the dialogue of the men is muted as if we are hearing it from several yards away while the women stand back and must accept what the men decide. In fact we can barely hear the dialogue of the men most times unless they are telling stories of bravado or are complaining.

For an audience this inability to even hear many of the male characters dialogue could be frustrating, but it makes sense here. By not knowing what the ""plan"" is, we are forced to see the point of view of the women and this pulls us into their plight. The women here are mostly powerless and their fate is in the hands of their husbands and, more dramatically, in Meek, a rough and untrustworthy guide. Yet the search for water changes the dynamic of the group over the course of the film and the main character, Emily Tetherow, begins making the most important decision of who to trust, Meek or a captured Cayuse Indian. Their lives all depend on this decision and all other decisions are secondary.

This leads us to the end of the film. I won't give it away here, but suffice it to say that the film ends much as it begins and is the source of great confusion and controversy. Needless to say, many people will be confused or even angry with how Meek's Cutoff ends, but to end the film any other way would miss the point of the entire story. An old saying goes that water has no memory but it leaves its mark. So too do the characters of Meek's Cutoff and, more importantly, the real settlers who traveled a thousand miles across the open, untamed American west. We do not know the names of most of those settlers and their stories have been mostly forgotten, but they left their mark the way a tiny stream will one day carve a canyon.",1405209600,10,3844,4.41607898448519

4595019,4,B00579YI1G,"Meek's Cut Off is a revisionist western,in that it depicts the movement of emigrants west in America who are full of doubts,trepidation,fear of the unknown, ignorance of the future. To cap it all they are being led by Stephen Meek(Bruce Greenwood) their guide,whose been hired to shepherd them over the CascadeMountains. He has led them astray,and they start to distrust one another(there are 3 couples in separate wagons) and their guide. Their provisions are limited and they are short of water as they journey on the Oregon Trail. They seem to be wandering aimlessly astray,He boasts about his exploits and experiences,they mutter under their hats.

The revisionist western plays more emphasis on women and native Indians. Here the director Kelly Reichardt has placed the women in period bonnets and traditional clothes,stresses the daily labour and the monotony of that labour,the dry plains and the harsh conditions of the high desert,fetching wood,making fires,fetching water. The use of oxens and period wagons gives us a sense of the frontier culture. She shoots from a distance,not in close up, in 4:3 aspect ratio that turns the vast Oregon plains claustrophobic;what's emphasised is stillness, silence, unforgiving landscapes. She slows her material to a crawl and drenches her action in ambiguity, to the point that the entire affair quickly becomes engulfed in moral/ spiritual haziness. She flips the gender/power balance so that Michelle Williams takes the lead in challenging Meek,whose idea of a short cut,has taken them away from water and over mountains.

When things don't go to plan the group is forced to put their trust in a native American who they have captured to lead them on-either to water or their deaths. The unhurried pace produces edginess,the focus on labour and ritual evokes the menacing hardship,the carrying of baskets and birdcages over their heads when crossing rivers,produces images of trance-like ominousness. Meek wants to kill the untrustworthy savage, and this splits the group as Solomon(Will Paton), Emily's husband,says he may be their best chance of finding water. There is a battle to establish truth and facts in a world of prejudice ,ignorance and a hostile natural world. The female protagonists are focussed on and their underlying alliance with the native Indian to create the underlying dissonance,despite his muted smile at a wagon's destruction.

There are no stand-out protagonists in this film,but Williams is shown to have a complexity,compassion as well as distrust,towards the Indian-as evidenced towards a late-act rifle show-down. Reichardt could be said to keep her characters at too distant a remove to fully engage us. Authenticity is highlighted and theuncertatinty about themotivations of its characters elevates the film to an investigation into the unsettling nature of the truth, especially with the film's masterful closing image which has no resolution but leaves its questions hanging in the air.",1402185600,3,2973,5.375536480686695
4595020,2,B00579YI1G,"The Meek Cut-Off, or Meeks ""Trail"" was noteworthy only because of the grand scale of the enterprise: over 200 wagons and 1000 people followed Meek on that ill-fated ""shortcut.""  Many died.  And, if things had gone really wrong, ALL of them could have died.

But people died by the thousands on the Trail, so to get the true magnitude of this, the movie MUST show the numbers!  Ten people and three wagons???  Who cares about that?  So it failed, as it must, because even the 10 people themselves know that their fate is not that important.

Some non-historians here said it was ""realistic.""  Well, that is mostly incorrect.  The director, being from the east, apparently did not know that a TON of invasive species--cheat grass, Russian Thistle, etc.--have entrenched themselves in the 170 years since the Meek trail.  She shows them in the picture--and they would NOT have been there.  Kudos to at least the fact that the movie was shot in Eastern Oregon, but she needed to find the remaining grasslands to shoot scenes that approximate more nearly what the terrain would have looked like in 1845.  And these guys would NOT have had a bird!!  It did not take long after the train left modern-dale Vale before they were in real trouble, and people started dying.  People started throwing out everything that was too heavy, to make it easier on the oxen.  They most certainly would NOT have had a bird along.  Absurd.  And the dialogue is mostly silly too.  It is at least plausible (if fictitious) that Meek might have been hired by the British to mislead 1000 immigrants....but TEN???  Ridiculous.

No, this movie is not ""realistic,"" except for the fact that the movie was at least filmed in the right general region of the country.

It is an ancient juniper limb, carved ""Lost 1845  Meeks"" with an arrow.  It is a mute but powerful testament to the suffering of that Train.

4595028,4,B00579YI1G,"Reichardt is a philosopher, not unlike her predecessor Terrence Malick. She takes into the landscape with Western protagonists, their Manifest Destiny, their religion and their ignorance about the landscape, nature and the indigenous who know what they do not. What works so well in this film is the sense that it is that gathering trustworthy information for the survival of the protagonists is itself the dramatic problem. Who should they trust? An arrogant guide who despises natives and claims he knows the way to water and the plush Oregon valleys, or a native scout, who might or might not have nefarious intentions, who does not speak any English, and who seems to know where he is going? Where is he going? Will it get everyone killed, will it save everyone? Or does Meek the guide know better? The viewer who enjoys observing the human limits of what is knowable will delight in this film. It helps immensely that the acting and dialog is excellent, efficient and intense. Reichardt's film is for those willing to patiently think about the minds of the early migrants of the West who took great risk in their Western passage, and were willing to do so as probable victims of a great ontological conundrum. The Wild West, before the wars with indigenous peoples really got started, before states became territories vying for statehood, was a blunt hammer on the mind, smashing the Western migrants sense space, time, motive and certainty, even as politicians and entrepreneurs promised milk and honey for those who survived the journey. If you are looking for a shoot 'em up Western with score settling and neat moral endings, then consider expanding your taste to the more sublime.

4595031,5,B00579YI1G,"Meek's Cutoff is a Western movie but in no way should it be considered a normal Western of the old time Saturday Morning fare. It is a Western more along the lines of a John Ford Western in that it speaks to a condition of man by using a Western theme. It differs from both in that it is slow, quiet, and dialogue is often carried out with only firelight for lighting. Thus the movie is a far cry from John Ford movies in that there are no colorful, hammy characters and there are no sudden violent scenes.

This movie should not be considered historically accurate by any means. Some of the story of the Meek's Cutoff pioneers is portrayed here but on the whole the movie only loosely describes that story to make a larger point about the condition of man.

If anything it is an existentialist parable of modern conditions using the story of the Meek's Cutoff emigrants.

The emigrants consist of three families traveling through eastern Oregon using oxen and prairie schooners. They are guided by Stephen Meek a mountain man and Indian fighter who, presumably, knows something about the area they are crossing.

They find that the cutoff is not a short cut in the usual sense and Meek is unsure of where water can be found. The pioneers' store of water becomes drastically low.

Eventually they find and capture an Indian that had been shadowing the emigrants. They make him an offer, blankets for a clear path to find water. Of course, the white pioneers can't really bring themselves to fully trust this lone brave.

And why should they? Meek has had many negative dealings with Indians in the past. Others fear he is signaling to his tribe and leading him to an ambush.

The dwindling water, the silence, the inability to understand the Indian gives the movie a whopping tension. Indeed tension like in this movie can be felt in the real world. The lost emigrants on Meek's Cutoff are in a situation much like that of the Americans of the Obama Era. Americans have delegated guiding authority to a person of a background from a tribe of known negative history causing great concern. Additionally, there is no end in sight to the mounting problems, Americans keep plodding, but the economy remains stuck and no political idea has come about to lead Americans from the desert.

There is no support from a higher power.

This movie is filmed on location. The desert looks like the wild territory of 1845 and the styles are likewise from the same era. The women look wonderful in their bonnets and prairie dresses and one can see just how useful their clothing was. The firearms are also flintlocks-the producers didn't make the mistake to move technological inventions of the 1890's backwards several decades.",1382313600,2,2711,4.7025316455696204

I liked it, although I did sometimes feel there could be a bit more to it. Then again, I believe it takes a lot of courage for a director to make such a film when almost everybody seems to enjoy those stupid wobble camera techniques used in films like ""The Bourne Identity"".

Also, it is a very cool idea not to use subtitles when the Indian speaks whom the settlers encounter. Thus we, the audience, are in the very same position as the settlers, not knowing if the Indian is going to help them.

4595036,4,B00579YI1G,"""Meek's Cutoff"" (2010), directed by Kelly Reichardt, is based on the ill-fated journey of a wagon train of settlers in 1845 through the Oregon desert led by the frontier guide Stephen Meek. This slow moving, relatively plotless film, brilliantly recreates the boredom of the settler's life in the remote unexplored regions of the West. For something so mundane I was surprisingly captivated by the small details which make up this film as we see the settler's trudge through rivers and across desert, all the while watched from afar by a lone Indian who is eventually caught and kept alive with the hope that he can lead them all to water. This film isn't high theatrical drama, but it does depict the realistic drama of settlers who are lost and trying to survive in the bleakest of landscapes. In this sense the film tries to represent the realistic depiction of life on the frontier rather than representing life as entertainment for the audience. For this reason some may find this film lacking, but if one takes it for what it is then one may find value in its parched representation of a reality where lost souls saw their hopes fade.",1378339200,3,1140,4.733668341708543

4595042,4,B00579YI1G,"Meek's Cutoff (Kelly Reichardt, 2010)

I was less then impressed with Wendy and Lucy, Kelly Reichardt's debut film, but it did redeem itself during the final fifteen minutes, so when Meek's Cutoff appeared, I gave it a look. It features Rules of Engagement's Bruce Greenwood, one of Hollywood's great underutilized, and that is a fine enough reason to watch any film. But Kelly Reichardt has turned in something quite good here, impressionist and open-ended and very artfully composed, almost the diametric opposite of Wendy and Lucy, and I liked it a good deal.

Plot: three families are headed to California  in 1845 along the Oregon Trail, hoping to find their fortunes in the west. Seeking a shortcut, they have hired Samuel Meek (Greenwood), a native of the area, who claims to know a shortcut through the mountains. As time goes on, however, the settlers begin to question whether Mr. Meek knows a shortcut at all--or whether he's full of hot air. After wandering the desert for days with no water, the party comes across an Indian who claims he can lead them to water--stranding the party between keeping their trust in a man who has yet to earn it and placing it instead in a man who has always been painted as the enemy of the white man.

The following paragraph could be construed to have spoilers; if you are sensitive to that sort of thing, stop reading now, and just note that I am recommending you see this as long as you're a fan of the slow and arty.

I mentioned, in the opening paragraph, the two things about this movie that truly struck me: the composition and the ambiguity. The composition can be seen early on; there are some incredible shots in the first ten or fifteen minutes of this movie (including a fade so perfect I actually rewound and watched it six or seven times in succession), and things just keep getting better. That shot with the three wives (Brokeback Mountain's Michelle Williams, Ruby Sparks' Zoe Kazan, and Life During Wartime's Shirley Henderson) walking in a diagonal line across the landscape? That's artistry right there. It's also blindingly artificial, so if you have a problem with pretentiousness in your movies, you probably want to run away quickly. As well, the ambiguity of the thing seems to have led more viewers to frustration than anything else; at no point in this movie do we ever know, well, anything about what's going on. Is Meek a charlatan? We never find out. Does the Indian (who is never named, a very telling point) ever actually lead the party to water? We never find out. The end credits roll about three minutes before most people think they should. I found that to be a strength instead of a weakness, but it's still frustrating enough that I felt the need to shave a bit off the rating.

Still, Kelly Reichardt gets my vote for Most Improved Filmmaker, 2010 edition. If this is the quality of work we can look forward to from her, I eagerly await the next feature. *** ",1368662400,4,2944,4.671814671814672

The actors seemed to have been plopped down on the prairie and given some dialogue so that they would have something to say in the dullest way possible.

The problem for me with  this film was that I did field work in remote sections of Alaska and the lower forty eight.

4595054,4,B00579YI1G,"If you've ever harbored romantic notions of what life must have been like on a wagon train, ""Meek's Cutoff"" will disabuse you of those notions right quick. In fact, the movie takes all those glamorized Hollywood visions of life on the trail and tramples them into the dust. For here is life as it would actually have been lived by those 19th Century pioneers - dirty, dusty, exhausting, largely bereft of food, water, comfort and safety, exposed 24/7 to the harsh elements of nature and a succession of mortal dangers from beasts, accident and other hostile human beings.

The relentless heat and sun, the parched landscape, the begrimed faces, blistered lips and leathery skin, and the growing despair of those who have set out on this journey are all captured in stark, matter-of-fact and empathetic terms by scenarist Jonathan Raymond and director Kelly Reichardt, who bring a near-documentary feel and tone to the film. While the film is loosely based on a true event that took place in 1845, the characters and plot are barely incidental to the almost palpable re-creation of the experience (an aspect that will, undoubtedly, turn many people off to the movie).

Michelle Williams is probably the biggest ""name"" actor in the cast, which includes Paul Dano, Bruce Greenwood, Shirley Henderson, Neal Huff, Zoe Kazan, Tommy Nelson, and Will Patton.

More than any wagon-train movie I've ever seen, it is told from the point of view of the women, and unlike the vast majority of westerns that we grew up watching, it is more concerned with the small movements of survival and every-day life rather than big dramatic moments. Although the settlers are afraid of Indian attack, only one enters the picture, and he spends his time as a captive of the settlers; communication between the settlers and the Indian is never established, although the settlers hope he will lead them to water. Lack of water is the biggest threat the group faces, other than the incompetence of their guide, Meek, who steered them off the main trail to this cutoff.
Several reviewers have called this film slow and avant-garde. I would call it realistic and deliberate. The tension builds and builds as the group continues to trudge along. The settlers are so small in some of the long shots that you really get a sense of how vast the land is and how difficult this crossing must have been back in 1844, when people still didn't really understand what they were getting into.

This means that watching all the gritty (and stressful) drama is completely pointless because the viewer never finds out what happens to the characters. Period. Given that the entire movie is about what will happen to the characters in the end, having no ending pretty much means that watching this movie is pointless. Don't bother because it will just make you furious that you bothered to sit through the entire movie. If you want to feel needlessly frustrated, this is the movie for you.",1340582400,6,863,4.917808219178082

I have read a lot about the wagon trains that traveled West, and one constant theme is the awful boredom the travelers experienced day after dusty day.  I was very disappointed in the way it ended.  There was a time period during the late 60's and 70's when a lot of movies ended in the middle of the story, without a conclusion.

One thing that didn't seem true was how empty the wagons were.  I always thought they were loaded with supplies -- but maybe not, as perhaps the oxen would tire.

Also, there didn't seem to be much camaraderie. I wish there had been more about the relationships.

It was a sad, difficult trip, and yet we don't know much after watching it unfold.

I actually liked the fact there wasn't any background music blaring as there usually is in most movies.  Without the music, you could really feel how stark and bleak traveling West was during that time period.

Meeks is a hired Oregon trail guide who attempts to retain a leadership role.  His grasp and ability to influence deteriorates as the story progresses, but not without pointed attempts to confuse the group and solidify control.  The story for me became interesting by noting the control plays and power shifts as key decisions were made, and which characters played pivotal roles in those decisions.  I won't short-circuit anyone's desire to critique the movie in this way by giving my analysis here.

Whoever made this movie MUST have known something wasn't right. The editors that cut the film should have spoken up when they were doing their work. I don't see how they could have edited the film to get any kind of watchable product. 70% of the film is made up of scenes where they are walking through the dessert. Not much dialogue, no action scenes. The script probably had 5 pages of lines for the actors. It's nearly passable as a silent film. I fast-forwarded through much of the movie. It was almost as much fun as my last dental appointment and had nearly as much dialogue.
""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" was a great movie. It's been running on TV for years. This movie is not likely to EVER be seen on TV. The no-name production company that made this piece of crap is destined for obscurity, if not bankruptcy. They rented top-notch cameras and hired a great crew. Too bad the movie was so weak. I bet the crew was scratching their heads when the movie finished filming. They probably said to themselves, ""Is that it?"".

4595069,4,B00579YI1G,"I don't submit many reviews on here but I can't help doing this one since this movie is simply getting slammed unfairly by way too many people.  I will agree with a lot of what I've read on here; your appreciation of this film depends upon your tastes, film knowledge and exposure, and your own outlook on things.  I'm getting the feeling that many people gravitated to this film thinking it was a typical western, ala ""Dances with Wolves"" or something along those lines, which would explain why they found this movie ""boring"", ""a waste of time"", etc.  If this is what you're looking for, yes, veer away from this one...I completely agree.  If you're a lover of art, indie, or just plain different sorts of films, however, please do come in and experience this one.

Personally, I loved this film, and I watch a lot of mildly out there movies.  The western theme initially made me a bit skeptical since I'm not exactly a fan but I was pleasantly rewarded early on.  The beauty of this film is that you, the viewer, take the journey along with the characters, and in the end (w/o being a spoiler) the film is really about you, how you think, what you would do, etc.  It's quite fascinating, really, if you have the right mindframe for it.

The cinematography works well, the unique method of filming is quite interesting (check out the extras for the short ""making of...""), and Michelle Williams is, as always, a sheer joy to watch.  If you like films like ""Melancholia"", as much as it's kind of a strange comparison, you'll more than likely find this film fascinating as well.

4595071,1,B00579YI1G,"Frankly, the longer I watched this movie the more angry I became.  First, Meek's wagon train consisted of some 200 wagons and about a thousand people!  They had nearly 4,000 cattle/oxen with them!  About the only accurate aspect of the movie was that they were almost always looking for water.  [It takes  LOT of water for that many people and livestock!]  By the end of the movie, I actually got out a magnifying glass to see if someplace on the DVD cover it said it was one of a multiple-DVD set because it just stopped . . . no ending.  I guess the producers ran out of money.

What most made me angry was the movie's depiction of the Indian.  First of all, Stephen Meek (whose niece, Helen, died two years later from untreated measles during her captivity in the Whitman massacre) who had lived and traveled nearly twenty years in the Rocky Mountain areas certainly would have known sign language and how to get ideas across to Indians whose language he did not speak.  It is true that the group met a lone Indian, a member of the Warm Springs tribe.  But, he walked openly into their camp, was given food and then Meek asked how to get to the Dalles.  The Indian agreed, for a blanket, to guide them on the 5-day trek.  Along the way, they met more Warm Springs Indians, one of them being able to speak some English.  They led them to the Deschutes River, where the tribe was fishing, and showed the emigrants where there was a place to cross the river (which took two week for all to get across).  From everything I've read on it, the Indians they encountered showed every sign of friendliness, and did not deserve the way the movie's Meek and many of the others treated him.

In stark contrast with the Indian's help, as they neared the Dalles they sent a group to the Methodist mission there for help . . . . and were refused.",1329523200,25,1834,4.381656804733728

The plot is extremely simple: three families, crossing arid plains and threatened by lack of water, find they have hired a questionable guide who seems unable to lead them to the Oregon territory. As the tale is told, their situation is only vaguely described, even at the end. This may bother some viewers, but for me it magnified the intensity of the challenges faced by the characters. Some of the individuals emerge stronger for the struggles, others weaken and even collapse. The hired guide captures a Nez Perce Indian who seems, at least to a few of the settlers, to be more trustworthy than the guide himself. The pioneers struggle over who to trust knowing that the wrong decision may result in their deaths. The presentation of the movie is stark in the sound of the constant creaking of wagon wheels and the sight of endless hills on the horizon.

4595082,3,B00579YI1G,"There's a lot going on in MEEK'S CUTOFF, despite the simple plot: a band of pilgrims across the American West search for water. The film is incredibly deep, and the actors hardly seem like they're putting out effort (in a good way): the cast, led by Michelle Williams, Will Patton, Bruce Greenwood, and Paul Dano, give organic performances rooted in the landscape around them.  And what a landscape it is; the cinematography is utterly breathtaking, capturing the bleak despair and beauty surrounding the group.

The problem is, there's also a lot that's NOT going on in MEEK'S CROSSING.  Namely, action.  It's easy for your attention to wander; it shouldn't, because this a beautiful, thoughtful film, but it still does, meaning much of what the film has to offer goes unnoticed.  Kelly Reichardt's direction is somewhat lazy, yes, but that can actually be a good thing in some situations; I'm laying more of the blame on Jonathan Raymond's script, which delves deep into the gritty side of humanity, but doesn't offer much on the surface.  Still waters run deep, but rapids are much more interesting.  As such, MEEK'S CROSSING comes off as a failed experiment, though definitely worth your time and attention, if you can give it.

4595083,5,B00579YI1G,"This movie is, according to notes, based on the true story of a small group of pioneers heading west to Oregon. They follow a trail guide named Meeks, who takes them on a ""shortcut."" Although the movie doesn't state so anywhere, people who traveled west by Conestoga wagon were always looking for shortcuts -- finding shortcuts could save days or weeks, and that could save them from getting stuck in the Rockies when the first snows fell, and thereby perishing, as did the Donner Party. In this movie, Meeks is a big talker, full of tales of his accomplishments, but it is clear that he doesn't know what he's talking about. He has led this small group across barren land where there is no water. Neither the travelers nor their so-called guide know when they will reach ANY of the various landmarks that would indicate they are heading in the right direction. And then, they encounter an Indian.

They take the Indian captive. Meeks wants to kill him. The others think the Indian will lead them to water. Nobody in this small party speaks any Indian language at all, and they don't even know what tribe this particular Indian belongs to. (Turns out, if you read the credits, that he is Nez Perce.) They speak to him in English, he speaks to them in his own language. Neither knows what the other is saying . . . except, possibly, through intuition. Will the captive lead them to water, or will he let them die? The ending may seem ambiguous, but if you can read character in faces and actions, you will know how it ends.

For me this has the feel of a History Channel documentary with some help from Terrence Malick.  The opening sequence goes on silently for 15 or 20 minutes or so which I have no problem with given the setting. But the film lacks a purpose other than to see the hardship of frontier life.  The plot is simple and straight forward.  Three families hire a guide named Meek (an unrecognizable Bruce Greenwood) to cross the Cascades and deliver them to 1845 Oregon.

Meek says he knows a shortcut.  They get lost but encounter a lone Indian in the high desert.  Why is he alone?  We never find out.  In any case they capture him with plans to execute him for being...an Indian.  One couple believes he could lead them to water which they desperately need.  Most of the film takes the form of a conflict of moral principals with the Tetherow's on one side and Meek on the other.  The other two family's switch sides depending on the better argument.  I kept waiting for something interesting to happen.  Will the Indian prevail?  Does he have compatriots in the hills? Will he lead them to water?  Will Meek kill him?  Will the Teherows kill Meek?  Will Emily Tetherow (Michelle Williams) end up with the Indian?  Alas, the PG stamp keeps it all in check.

Apparently the canary died off-screen, so even that bit of action was considered too disruptive of the intended parched monotony.

I kept fiddling with the picture size but no, the package clearly states 1.37:1  The Amazon item description has it at 1.33:1. Either way it's ridiculous. There aren't that many square TVs anymore and even if you still have one that works you won't for long. It's almost the equivalent of buying something now on VHS. There won't be anything to play it on soon.

I'm giving this one star based solely on the fact that it's not in wide (now = standard) format but I can't add anything good about the movie. All I can say is I'm glad I didn't buy an actual ticket when this thing was playing. I have no idea why the reviews were so good.

But the real problem is the dilemma of believing a man who has failed them or placing their trust a Native American - a feared enemy -- who stumbles across the desperate families.

Director Kelly Reichardt perfectly captures the loneliness and harsh, unforgiving environment in this engrossing tale based on harrowing real events.  But why is it not presented in a widescreen format.  Finally, a strange, well-acted film that has a great sense of time and place but is somehow unsatisfying.",1319068800,,780,4.916030534351145

Well, the only way that could be was the director is related to someone in charge, they were all drunk or they never actually watched the movie. The best part of the movie was when the DVD froze up.

4595102,2,B00579YI1G,"The movie starts out real slow. We watch the mundane tasks of the pioneers as they load water, wash dishes, grind meal...There is no introduction of characters. In fact they remain fairly plain. We hear and watch much of the important conversation from a distance catching bits and pieces. 3 devout families have hired Steven Meek, a slightly crusty man, to guide them to Oregon. He takes them into a high plains desert where they wander for weeks.

The men suspect Mr. Meek is deliberately attempting to get them lost as Oregon is an area in flux and may go to the English, depending on how many Americans settle there...or not. There is an Indian that pops up from time to time. Steven scares everyone with his Indian stories. Eventually they encounter the Indian and you think the story will pick up, but surprise! It doesn't.

The movie ends abruptly. From Meek's words, the film appears to be some sort of metaphor for life and fate as to what path to follow and who to trust, although for the life of me I can't really figure out what it is. The movie won all kinds of awards and I haven't figured that one out either. It was extremely boring. The dialouge was boring. The drama was boring. The people were boring. After a while, the scenery got boring. The squeak of the wagon wheel drove me crazy. Why anyone would waste their time watching this film is beyond me. It isn't accurate history.

4595104,2,B00579YI1G,"While ""Meek's Cutoff"" promises much, ultimately it fails to deliver a satisfactory viewing experience.  From the first, I found the size of the group unconvincing:  pioneers just didn't travel in such small groups - it was far too dangerous.  Caravans often had hundreds of people in them.  And men wouldn't go off leaving their womenfolk and children alone, as happened on one occasion.  The film does exploit the vastness, and stark beauty, of the landscape very successfully, but that does not make up for the shortcomings of the plot.  The muttered dialogue among the men was irritating.  Why have people talking if you can't understand half of what they are saying?  When the film ended, I thought,""Eh?  What a cop-out!  All that tension and then - nothing!""  If the film was making some sort of existential statement, it was long-winded and, to my mind, pretentious.  Following viewing ""Meek's Cutoff,"" I watched a Buck Jones' western, ""Dawn on the Great Divide,"" made in 1930's.  It is in black and white, grainy, and the sound track hisses, but, it is great!  There was excitement, action and interesting interactions between the characters.  And white men were the bad guys, not the Indians.  In the end, western fans must make their own decisions, but I wouldn't recommend ""Meek's Cutoff"" to my friends.  I would show them Buck Jones in action!",1317340800,4,1354,4.920353982300885
4595105,1,B00579YI1G,"I suppose if you've never spent much time on a western prairie, most likely an asphalt jungle, that the visual brush and rock landscape and the sounds mostly of wind and insects would be charming. And it is for an hour, week or even a year but after that it will just drive you up a tree (if any can be found). And, that was the most accurate part of the movie. As far as the Meek mid-southern route that was supposedly  safer than the Northern, with it's potential encounters with the unwelcoming Native owners, it was a hot rocky, waterless region through most of central Oregon. Approximately 6"" of rain a year and no streams for a hundred miles.

So how does the movie portray a settler wagon train along the southern route - poorly, and inaccurately. Some examples: Three wagons with settlers (not likely); holding hands while walking in a rocky prairie then building a fire ringed with rocks (unlikely) and after it's died down pouring sand over it so that embers don't catch the desert on fire (unlikely). Oh, and the encounter and chase down capture of a lone Native (unlikely). All of which fits with the script which seemed staged for drama and impressive visuals. Not anything close to the large number of interesting true stories that good research would have found of the wagon trains that actually struggled on that route. Also the noble, pictograph drawing, chanting, walking off in the sunset Native is a racist stereotype.

This is a 90% fiction movie that pretends to be more.",1317254400,3,1494,4.673003802281369
4595106,5,B00579YI1G,"I finally had the privilege of watching this film the other night, and I must admit that I was love-struck.  I'm not even truly certain what I witnessed, but I know that it was brilliant.  Shortly after viewing it I jotted down a few notes for my blog.  They went a little something like this:

Surprisingly visual...emotionally compacted...ambiguously conclusive; masterpiece?  Probably.

The film centers on three couples and a guide, searching for water on the Oregon Trail in the 1800's.  The guide, the flamboyant Meek, is an enigma himself, joyful and confident yet elusive and seemingly shady.  He does not sway nor does he instill any sense of confidence in Emily, the strongest female in the bunch and certainly the most prominent `opinion' focused upon in the film.  Emily regards Meek as an ignorant liar who has conned her family and friends, and so she despises him with cold stares and harsh words.  When the group encounters a Cayuse Indian, things begin to shift as they attempt to use the Indian as a means to find water.  The group is indecisive in their view of the Indian (some think he's dangerous and want him dead, others think he's merely useless yet some feel confident he'll bring them to water).

Kelly Reichardt works wonders behind the camera here.  I've only seen one other film of hers, `Wendy and Lucy', and I must say that as much as I loved that film (and Williams should have been up for the Oscar), Reichardt really upped her game with her latest feature.  `Meek's Cutoff' is a stunning film.  As I mentioned, it's surprisingly visual.  I never would have guessed that cracked earth and dead grass could be so beautiful, but nearly every frame is a visual masterpiece.  Even the color of the dresses is like beautiful flowers on a densely colored canvas.  The pacing is also a joy because it milks the atmosphere perfectly.  Segments of no dialog allow the audience to feel the emotion dripping from sullen faces and truly take in the harsh reality of the surroundings.  Michele Williams (possibly THE actress of her generation) is the perfect `prop' for this sort of film because her face is her strongest asset. Certain actors portray such strength with a certain part of their body (Blanchett has her voice, Scott Thomas has her body and the way she can move it with such fluid force) and Michele Williams just has this face that makes such an impact.

She looks right through you; to your soul.

The ending may feel underwhelming to some, but the ambiguous nature of it actually serves the film well.  This is a character study, one that is elusive to the naked eye and so the way in which the ending falls (with that `tree of life' casting shaded comfort over the group) is a delicate touch that seals the deal in making `Meek's Cutoff' an unforgettably astute and unique viewing experience.",1317081600,3,2832,4.723014256619145
4595107,3,B00579YI1G,"There are many long stretches of this movie in which nothing much happens besides trekking across the wilderness totally lost.  This would stop some viewers from watching the rest.

The basic plot is that three families are trying to migrate somewhere and their leader has gotten them lost.  They capture a Native  American who may or may not know where there is water, which they are running out of quickly.  What becomes of them is not totally clear. The ending is ambiguous at best.

you can not hear some parts and can't see others. They gathered firewood 3 times and guess what Those were probably the most exciting parts in this movie. I still watched to the end thinking something has to come out of this, but no. The movie simply ends.

8460475,4,B00579YI1G,"RELEASED IN 2010 and directed by Kelly Reichardt, Meeks Cutoff is loosely based on the real-life story of vain trail guide Stephen Meek (Bruce Greenwood) leading three couples of settles and a boy away from the Oregon Trail and through the Oregon desert in 1845 where they find themselves lost and struggling to survive while they try to trail-blaze a new path with a Native along for the ride, who may or may not be for them. Michelle Williams plays the female protagonist while Will Patton plays the main male settler. Zoe Kazan, Shirley Henderson, Paul Dano and Neal Huff are also on hand as settlers.

This movie is similar in tone to 2014s The Homesman in its sense of boring realism and the harshness of what it was like to be a traveling settler in the Old West. People complain about the ambiguity but its the point: The movies not actually about the outcome of one particular group or another; it's about the awful vagueness that settlers had to face, which increased with each step that took wagon trains further away from settled territory until they went too far to turn around. They faced setbacks, illnesses, injured oxen, broken wheels and steppe fires, all of which exposed them to possible death before anyone so much as came close to Oregon City and areas nearby (Portland was founded in 1845). Over the next hill any settler might find riches and happiness in a new land or s/he could find suffering by way of thirst, disease, beasts and Native attack. The films successful in helping you experience this reality on the comfort of your sofa or recliner.

Meeks Cutoff is unconcerned with either the events that led to the settlers departing the Oregon Trail or what happens to them if they eventually rejoin it or pave a new way. The focus switches to their relationship with the Native (Rod Rondeaux). The events placed the pilgrims in an uncertain life-or-death situation wherein their collective facade of Christian European supremacy is threatened and evaporates in the parched landscape as they are forced to trust a heathen savage. (While Meek seems to exaggerate the torture tactics of Native Americans at one point, which understandably makes the other travelers seriously paranoid, it IS historically documented that many tribes used torture tactics on their captives, including other tribespeople).

If any of this trips your trigger, youll probably appreciate this Western. Yet the films lack of closure is frustrating because the movie sets up a plot with obvious stakes (Will they live or die? Will they find water or won't they? Can the Native be trusted or not?). The viewer should NOT have to look up the real events to find out what happened. If you can handle this kind of opacity, though, this is a worthy modern Western. Just don't expect any quick-draw shootouts, saloons, cavalries, sheriffs, stampedes, saloon babes, etc. because this is the farthest thing from that kind of Western.

8460476,5,B00579YI1G,"Certainly this movie is kind of slow, even boring at times (at least at first view) and then it came to me;  I imagine going across the plains was slow, boring and strangely mixed with fear and uncertainly. Most especially if you are lost  (that comes out early in the movie so I'm not spoiling anything).  The sparseness of the camera shots, the long held views, the lack of dialogue all draw the viewer into the wagon experience. This movie is so different than most westerns that I also was somewhat disappointed at first view but have come to enjoy the slow melody of it all. Another layer is how woman were not included in the men's decisions or discussions, this also is wonderfully portrayed. This is a soft, lyrical movie and so slow down and enjoy. One last thought; if you loved Silverado, which I hated, don't bother to watch this movie and frankly, spend more times outdoors in the quiet solitude of the Western expanse, preferably alone.",1511913600,,950,4.609467455621302
