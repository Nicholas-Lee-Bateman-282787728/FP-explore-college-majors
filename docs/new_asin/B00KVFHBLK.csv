6449124,3,B00KVFHBLK,Just wait for this if you are curious.  There are funny parts but many of the jokes are obvious.,1404000000,,96,4.052631578947368
6449125,1,B00KVFHBLK,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!  This is a terrible waste of time and money! I cannot believe that the cast of this film who have fine acting skills would perform so horribly and allow the film to be distributed. I rented primarily because of two main actors reputations. Do yourself a favor and skip this one until it's free.,1404000000,,320,4.423728813559322
6449126,5,B00KVFHBLK,Showalter/Wain. All-Star cast. Everything I expected it to be with a couple of extra surprises thrown in for good measure.,1404000000,28,122,5.15
6449127,2,B00KVFHBLK,"Had funny moments. Just wasn't that funny. I thought it would be better. Not sure why it was just so-so. Love the actors, but really glad I didn't see it in the theater.",1403913600,,169,4.151515151515151
6449128,1,B00KVFHBLK,"Parody of romantic comedies is a huge disappointment given all of the talent involved.  The idea was to do a meta romantic comedy that comments on all of the clichs of the genre while also indulging in them--it feels like two thirds of the movie features the actors talking in air quotes.  Unfortunately with his focus on being clever writer director David Wain forgot to bring any laughs.  Seriously, I've seen god-awful straight-to-video horror movies by The Asylum that were much funnier than this.

Not that it matters but if They Came Together really wanted to parody Hollywood romantic comedies then Amy Poehler is miscast--she isn't pretty enough to be a lead in an actual Hollywood romantic comedy and would likely end up playing the sassy best friend.  Paul Rudd, on the other hand, has the leading man good looks but he isn't capable of elevating weak material, which is what he's stuck with here.

Some people may be able to get on the same wavelength as They Came Together but I found it to be an unfunny drag that was torture to sit through--I actually stopped the movie several times and pondered whether it was worth trying to make it to the end or not.  It wasn't.",1403913600,,1180,4.644230769230769
6449129,5,B00KVFHBLK,"To put it simply, it's a hilarious parody of what a typical romantic comedy looks like. Amy and Paul have awesome comedic timing, and incredible chemistry.",1403913600,20,155,5.0
6449130,1,B00KVFHBLK,This was a horrible movie and I wouldn't waste your money or your time. I guess I should have known from as same as theater release.,1403913600,,132,4.115384615384615
6449131,5,B00KVFHBLK,"Sometimes a movie comes along and makes you seriously wonder whether somebody spiked your wine with mescaline.  This would have been one of those movies had I smuggled in a bottle of wine to the local Cinema-8 THX 3-D ULTRA or whatever the hell the movie theaters are called these days.  Luckily, because of the business model employed here, my wife and I watched this movie from the comforts of our couch via Amazon Instant Video with our own wine ON RELEASE DAY for only $6.99.  For the convenience alone - for avoiding paying a sitter, the shame of smuggling wine into a crammed theater and worry about getting ratted out, being able to watch the film in our PJs - we would have paid $16.99...  The delivery mechanism alone was worth 5 stars but you would probably rather read about the movie.

Look, They Came Together was a weird flick.  I still may have glanced suspiciously at my wife once or twice regarding the aforementioned psychedelics.  Weird, but deliriously entertaining and viciously funny.  A Rom-Com getting the Airplane! treatment while still managing to not go full-on parody.  The cast is ridiculous in a great way and because we went into this semi-blind, having seen Rudd promoting the film on The Colbert Report the night before, I'd rather not spoil the cast for you other than to say there were uncharacteristically brilliant uses of a bunch of really funny actors/actresses.  Again, the movie itself is a sendup of the romantic comedy genre with a weird gonzo twist.  Rom-com tropes are presented, deconstructed and often annihilated.  As Rudd said on Colbert ""It's a toothless attack but a vicious homage"" to the traditional romantic comedy.  This is not to say you won't see some bits developing, because unless you're among the most cinematically challenged viewers, some of this is almost TOO cute.  But that familiar formula only serves to lull you into a false sense of comfort and makes those very, very weird tangents all the more enjoyable.

This isn't a movie for everyone and some will bristle at the crudeness of a couple scenes - despite Rudd's assertion, there is most definitely some bite in this attack - but I'd be lying if I said I didn't thoroughly enjoy this movie because of those very unexpected, often head-scratching forays into the bizarre.  Probably destined to be critically panned and severely underrated amongst moviegoers accustomed to seeing films that merely live up to their expectations, I suspect this will find a pretty dedicated cult following in the very near future as it certainly lends itself to repeated viewings.  And this next time, I'll be fully prepared for the trip.",1403913600,67,2640,4.8702460850111855
6449132,4,B00KVFHBLK,"They Came Together is the most playful endeavor since Wet Hot. That quintessential off balance approach that Mr. Wain is known for is back in full force. Before going to bed, my wife and I looked at each other and said ""Hey..... Thank you"".  Then I walked out the door, stopped, and turned around and repeated myself.",1403827200,20,317,4.56140350877193

6449138,3,B00KVFHBLK,This movie makes fun of romantic comedies by using every.single.cliche ever used in romantic comedies to the extreme.  It's supposed to be funny but it's really just a whole lot of overacting.,1504915200,,192,5.0
6449139,5,B00KVFHBLK,I thought this movie was hilarious!!! You can't go in thinking it's just a romantic comedy. This movie is a PARODY on romantic comedies. Really funny movie. I highly recommend it if you're into satires.,1504742400,,202,4.8
6449140,4,B00KVFHBLK,"I can't believe this movie has such a low rating. Yes, it is very silly/zany, and I don't even love that kind of comedy, but I was actually laughing out loud (which is rare for me). It did remind me of Airplane and Top Secret! If you are a stoner, you may really enjoy this goofy/light romantic comedy with a great (former) SNL cast and lots of cameos by other actors. I almost didn't watch it due to the low rating, but I love Paul Rudd, so I decided to give it a try, glad I did.",1502928000,,481,3.9690721649484537
6449141,4,B00KVFHBLK,"This movie is definitely stupid.  But the actors are all so funny and enjoyable to watch, and they really get into the ""dumbness"" of their roles, that it makes it very enjoyable.  There were quite a few laugh out loud moments, and I can't remember the last time I've had even one of those in a real rom-com.  Christopher Meloni provides a fantastic cameo.  I was in a bad mood and this movie cheered me up.",1502064000,,406,4.302631578947368

6449143,1,B00KVFHBLK,"Imagine someone who thinks they are funny seeing the movie ""Airplane"" for the first time, and saying to themselves ""Gee, I bet I can make a movie  like that....""  Thus the movie ""They Came Together"".  This movie uses exactly the same techniques employed in ""Airplane"" and dozens of other genre spoofs, and demonstrates why simply assembling a movie like a piece of Ikea furniture doesn't work.  Sight gags, taking statements at their literal meaning, and the like are all here...and virtually all not funny.

I asked the person I watched this movie with to help me find the least funny part of what was a uniformly unfunny movie.  Our two candidates were 1) When Paul Rudd indicates a desire to have sex with his ""bubbe"" (grandmother) and she indicates a similar desire for him, or 2) The incredibly long gag about the person needing to have a bowel movement but trapped in his Halloween costume.  If you watch this movie you will likely have your own candidates to put forward.

There are a lot of good people in this movie, pretty much all wasted.  I've still not given up hope on Amy Poehler, who has demonstrated an ability to be quite funny on TV, but has not consistently been able to translate that talent to movies.  Kenan Thompson, Ed Helms, Bill Hader...wasted, wasted, wasted.

A good ""bad movie"" but a painful comedy...consistently unfunny and more than occasionally painful to endure.",1499212800,,1397,4.779166666666667

6449145,5,B00KVFHBLK,"Absolutely brilliant.  A zany spoof of Romantic Comedies, this truly sheds a different light on them. It is wonderfully scripted--very cringey, but us apposed to be. The ONLY part I really hated was the...well. I don't want to give spoilers..but I'll just say...Grandma. Other than that, this was a knockout. My abs hurt for at LEAST a day after watching this from laughing so hard. My friends and I quote it all the time. WATCH IT!!!!! :)",1498608000,,439,4.701298701298701
6449146,5,B00KVFHBLK,"I would watch again. LOVE the entire cast. I'm a big Paul Rudd fan. If you liked Wet Hot America Summer, you will love this.

6449147,3,B00KVFHBLK,"I totally see where they were going with this. It worked a few times, but it was almost too on the nose. It entered into Naked Gun territory many times but it wasn't consistent or really sold that way so much of the humor was lost.",1497657600,,231,4.043478260869565

6449150,4,B00KVFHBLK,This movie is a great satire of your favorite romantic movie tropes. I found it hilarious if a bit silly.  Just sit back and laugh at the silliness it's entertaining if you're a fan of cheesy romantic comedies.,1488240000,,210,4.526315789473684

6449154,3,B00KVFHBLK,"I usually read critical comments before watching or buying a movie to avoid a bad movie and waste of time. In this case, I am glad I did not do it but rather went by my instinct because of my trust in Amy Poehler's sense of humor. It really paid off because this movie is very funny and entertaining in a Marx Brothers sort of way. The love story is satirical or farce and it is not meant to be taken seriously. There are quite funny scenes mostly by Amy Poehler. Other actors are ok but some punch lines are awkward. Paul Rudd, in particular, was miscast IMO since he does not come across as a funny guy as in Bill Murray or Chevy Chase. So I thought a three star rating would be fair. I recommend this movie to people who can handle this sort of comedy since it seems quite a few readers here did not understand the farce and instead gave this movie an undeservedly one star ranking.",1484438400,,885,4.181286549707602

6449159,4,B00KVFHBLK,"Witty satire of every Romantic Comedy clich&eacute; you can think of. You may disagree, but I see echoes of many movies including ""You've Got Mail,"" ""When Harry Met Sally,"" ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" ""Fever Pitch,"" ""Wedding Crashers,"" ""I Love You Man,"" ""Annie Hall"" and even more surprising fare like ""Star Wars,"" ""All of Me,"" and ""Scoobie Doo."" (I won't try to explain all my perceived references but they make sense to me.) This movie parodies tropes that every movie seems to have: the obligatory ""meet cute"" scene, characters wistfully looking through photo albums, the hero's wacky boardroom speech, the ex-girlfriend who tries to seduce the guy to win him back, the female lead's wealthy and weirdly right-wing parents (every movie you can think of), and her wacky and dysfunctional brother (""Annie Hall,"" ""Wedding Crashers, etc.), and more. This movie's over-the-top style reminds me of ""Airplane!"" in some ways. It may not be to everyone's taste, but I found it amusing and enjoyable.",1483833600,,994,5.180124223602484
6449160,5,B00KVFHBLK,"If you are looking for a stereotypical romance movie that will make you laugh, cry, and believe in the power of love, then this movie is NOT for you.  If, however, you're a realist who loves to laugh, you've hit the jackpot.  Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd do a bang-up job, and there are tons of guest star appearances -- Colbie Smulders, John Stamos, Christopher Meloni, Bill Hader, and Ellie Kemper, just to name a few.

If you love slap stick, over the top comedy you will love this film. That kind of film just isn't my thing, and that is ok. Much like this movie is just ""ok"". Not great, not spectacular. It's most redeeming quality is that it is free currently on Amazon Prime. I think I would have rated it lower if I had to pay full movie theater ticket price, and a baby sitter bill.  But free is just my speed for an ""ok"" movie like this. If you have had a bad day and just need to laugh at something horribly contrived and stupid, watch it.

I actually like the romantic comedies this movie makes fun of.  They go after every movie cliche in the book.  It was sort of like a SNL skit but 2 hours long.  There is some vulgar language here and there and mild nudity and sex acts in shadow.  I don't like that...I like my movies clean so that I feel good after watching them, not guilty.

Don't waste your time unless you are teaching film and you want to show your students what a bad film really looks like.  What's makes matters even worse is that the capabilities of the actors, both primary and supporting, are all proven and worthy.  What a waste!  I am sure that everyone of them cringed when they saw the final cut and prayed all night that it would be destroyed. So what happened?  Two things... first, the script is horrible.  It tries to be a smart parody of romantic comedies, particularly those of Meg Ryan, but it falls flat. Actually I'm being kind when I say flat...it in fact sinks. The dialogue is stupid almost to the point of being annoying.  And the situations are just not funny, This is not a funny movie, but rather a sad movie.  Why, because just about everyone in it acts like a moron.  Secondly, none of the characters are worthy of liking.  You will actually root for all them to drop dead.  And calling them shallow or at best, airheads, would be a compliment. I believe that everyone who has actually watched this movie to the end deserves an apology from the studio and the director.

This goes on around five or six times. Even when I was 10 years old, I would not have found this funny, so I am guessing the writer is a 9 year old boy.

6449205,5,B00KVFHBLK,"At first I was shocked by the number of 1-star reviews for this movie.  Then I realized that many viewers may not have understood exactly what this movie is.  It's not a romantic comedy; it's an absurdist _parody_ of a romantic comedy.  That's its genius.

The movie takes the form of a flashback, where Rudd and Poehler are having a dinner with friends and recount the story of their courtship.  Like many parts of this movie, I suspect it's all ad-libbed.  Look here and elsewhere for little bits of ""did I really see that?""  Find the half second with Paul Rudd putting his entire mouth around the opening of his wine glass for bonus points!  It's absurd, it's hilarious, and it's one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time.

Like virtually all comedies should, this wraps up in less than 90 minutes and does not wear out its welcome.  If you are expecting ""Sleepless in Seattle 2,"" you will be disappointed.  If you're expecting something a little more in the direction of ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"" you will enjoy this.  At least rent it, people!",1474934400,,1061,4.614973262032086

The cast is wonderful; the writing is terrible. This is a ""spoof"" of every romantic comedy ever made from the Shop Around the Corner cloth, i.e. You've Got Mail, etc.. I get it. I get it. But it is the same joke, over, and over, and over again. It hits you with a baseball bat between the eyes. Others have said it much more eloquently than I, Andrew Gold for instance, but this film is a waste of time for a large portion of the movie public. On the other hand, if you can stand the heavy-handed satire in the dialog, then watching this collection of great comedy actors go through their lines may have a place in your heart. Roger Ebert used to call these ""Guilty Pleasures"", and for some of you, that may be enough. But when I think of brilliant satire I can point to Bill Hader's and Fred Armisen's Documentary Now series. That's satire. Come to think of it, what this film needed was Seth Meyers, as the Executive Producer. He would have sorted out the dialog and made this film funny.

Checking out the trailer, seeing that it was directed by David Wain (Wet Hot American Summer), and seeing the loads of supporting cast all-stars, I knew this was a not-for-everyone-but-absolutely-for-me type of comedy.

If you weren't a fan of Wet Hot's outlandish, over-the-top, drawn-out, and occasional so-bad-it's-hilarious humor, then admittedly you likely won't like this movie.

So I guess I'll put it this way -- if you appreciate parodies, this movie is fantastic. I was laughing out loud the whole time. So much that it was a little awkward, because I was by myself. When my fiancee came in to figure out what was happening I happily restarted it despite being 45 minutes in.

How is it possible that this man gets better looking every year? Sorry, back to the movie ... it's definitely worth watching especially if you like this type of humor.

6450047,5,B00KVFHBLK,"If a review could be a pitch meeting, I'd describe this movie - with genuine enthusiasm and appreciation - as the Airplane! of rom-coms.

It is an hilarious, silly, smart, knowing parody full of so many telling details and throw-aways that it's almost an embarrassment of riches. And - like the best of true parody - it's obviously made by talented folks who know and harbor at least some affection for (perhaps against their better judgement) the obvious cliches - and slightly more intricate tropes - of the genre they're sending up.

Whether we like it or not, many of us have incorporated Nora Ephron & Rob Reiner's romcom sensibilities setting the standard for a certain sort of demographic (this one most notably follows You've Got Mail, but makes references to others every ten seconds) actually, almost any movie with any sort of 'romance' ever set & filmed in Manhattan I could go on into our movie vernacular, and this one speaks to all of it in its own borrowed terms that missed nothing. The soundtrack, the camera shots and angles, the performances, the stock set of best friends and relatives, the settings, the cutaways, the UWS, the plot arc and, Oh my God, the dialogue & script a lot of affection and attention went into this film, and elevate it beyond a long sketch into more than a spoof.

Just as I did with Airplane!, I will definitely look forward to viewing this again because I want to catch everything that may have been too fast the first time - and because it's made by my kind of knowledgable film geek with a similar sense of humor and irreverent reverence.",1438473600,2,1588,4.644128113879003

Don't worry, I thought so too (disappointedly as well, seeing as though I'm a huge Parks and Rec, SNL and Role Models fan). Well trust me, THAT IS NOT THE CASE HERE :) .  This movie is absolutely the antithesis of that. This is a tongue in cheek parody of all that is impossibly perfect romantic comedy, brilliantly done by the great Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd. It is a hilarious smack in the face of googly eyed love brought together by an all star comedy cast, each with laugh out loud characters and masterful comedic presence.  Like a full length SNL sketch tearing down chick-flicks, this one surprised me sooo much for the better.  I'm giving it 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good spoof.  If you're a Poehler and Rudd fan like me (dare I say...Wet Hot American Summer) DO NOT miss this one. You won't regret it.

6450309,5,B00KVFHBLK,"I can only assume the plethora of 1 star reviews for this film are from folks that got an olive for a grape, expecting They Came Together to be a romantic comedy, as opposed to an edgy parody of a romantic comedy. I love straight forward Rom-Coms when done well, but it is easy for films in the genre to be stupid, and they are often bad in similar ways. So I appreciate how the laughable aspects of many Rom-Coms are mercilessly mocked in They Came Together. There are moments that made me laugh harder than I have in a long time, and I highly recommend this consistently funny film.

 If you're a fan of David Wain and other former The State members, if you enjoy Childrens Hospital and The Baxter, The Ten, Wanderlust, et alia, you'll find this film to be among their most solid work, only surpassed by Wet Hot American Summer.",1434240000,,830,4.383116883116883

I knew what to expect with Wain and Showalter.  I'm a fan of most of their projects.  I think most people see a ton of stars and expect it to be the stereotypical romantic comedy and while it is a very smart comedy Wain & Showalter have systematically dissected every element of a super sugar hollywood happy ending movie and turned it on its ass.  These guys did a great job with great actors to spoof the genre.

If you like David Wain's movies, you will LOVE this movie.  This is one of his best.  If you like goofy comedy, you will like this movie.  This movie gets real goofy.  It's essentially the movie ""You've Got Mail"" if that movie had been made by Mel Brooks.  If that sounds good to you, enjoy and then rate it the 5 stars it deserves.  If that doesn't sound good to you, or you don't know what that means, don't watch this movie.

6450414,4,B00KVFHBLK,"I  read through many reviews before watching this film, prepped for either like/hate, whichever came first.  The comedic scenes were very well put together, with the dialogue slightly skewed, but still entertaining. Doubtful if I would ever watch it again, but for a stress-free film evening, it was enjoyable. I would recommend it for those who have an IQ above 60.  That leaves people who have not yet matured enough to understand guile, double entendre` and pure farce.  This film will appeal more, perhaps, to those who have been around the block more than once;  in short, a more mature audience who have the ability to be a bit more tolerant of subtle and nuanced humor.

In short, there was lots of verbal sparring between Molly and Joel , (Poehler & Rudd), our dueling protagonists.  Lines flew fast and furiously,  as all their histrionics began to develop the story line.  I heard shades of quite a few familiar favorites, such as When Harry met Sally, Notting Hill, Music
& Lyrics, and others.  At first I really wasn't paying attention to the source dialogue, but then it became rather a challenge to recall which favorite was being spoofed.  Aside from one particular scene of echoing behavior, which was set inside a bar,  most of the pranks were spot on, with action firming up the dialogue for a fun and funky reveal.

I would not recommend this film to teens at all.  Even though I didn't catch any profanity, the entire story line is more suited, as I stated earlier, for the audience who has some idea of the concept of time and emotional growth. Teens today, IMO, lack the experience-based familiarity that comes with time and personal vulnerability.  Besides which, I believe most youthful persons would find this film either boring, dull, stupid or a waste of time.  Perhaps all of these, at one sitting.

I thought it was a decent film. It was pleasing to the memory-pool, mirroring some of my own experiences.  Confirms my belief that even in farce, love remains.  On top of the ""stinky poo-poo fish special"".  Toss aside the quirks, it would be boring. But Poehler and Rudd managed to work a bit of veracity into their performances, they had good chemistry, and they totally clicked for this viewer.  Just watch it. It isn't a time-waster. It's FICTION.  With legs.",1433203200,,2290,4.758883248730965

I would think the poster would be enough of a clue that this movie is one long joke: ""He Came, She Came, they Both Came."" Paul Rudd's silly face. The NYC skyline against a coffee shop scene. It's all so cliche and played that it should be obvious this movie doesn't take itself seriously. My wife and I really enjoyed watching it and picking up on all of the jabs at other movies, particularly 90s romantic comedies. I'll probably end up watching it again because I'm sure there were jokes that I didn't notice the first time. Rudd and Poehler are essentially an exaggerated version of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, or maybe Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore at times. (Yes, that's where the Sandler-esque potty humor comes from.) Bill Hader and Ellie Kemper are also very funny as the uncomfortable couple that has to sit through Rudd/Poehler's narcissistic characters telling this story for hours.

Rudd & Poehler are better than this.  I stopped liking their characters and started fining them annoying, like an SNL sketch that went on and on and on and on...

6450859,2,B00KVFHBLK,"I always thought it was odd that ""romance"" and ""comedy"" are so often paired together.  I tend to view romcoms as a parody of Relationship/ Romance stuff anyway, so a movie like this is kinda like a parody of a parody.  So.. how does one satirize a parody?  Answer:  With a lotta potty humor!

They came together is a lot like the recent years of Saturday Night Live-- it's not so much satire as it is a bunch of clumsy and obvious scenes with bright colors that will only appeal to the stupid or the stoned.  Hey, no offense-- some of my best friends are stupid or stoned :)  In other words, the movie is fifty percent likeable people with vanilla dialog and fifty percent over the top MacGruber style vulgarity and foulness.  As a rule, fans of romcoms don't like ""potty humor"" (god I hate that phrase!), and immature fools like myself who like vulgarity usually don't like romcoms.

6450982,3,B00KVFHBLK,"A movie that is outright making fun of the romantic comedy should be hilarious. Unfortunately this is not the case. Even if this is the best possible romantic comedy parody available, it's still going to traffic in too much winking and nudging. When Nathan Rabin wrote about The Last Action Hero, he explained that the reason that movie didn't work was because Arnold Schwarzenegger movies are fairly close to parodies of the action genre already. Making a parody of a parody is overkill.

While most romantic comedies are supposedly serious, the laziness inherent in the romantic comedy complete with the contrived meet cute, the break up, the inevitable reunion and the friends and ex-lovers is almost comical in its own right. When someone sets out to parody this kind of movie, they really have to go big or go home. And even that's not going to work.

Everyone involved in this movie is giving it their all. Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd are great comedic actors. The line about how the romantic lead should be Jewish but not too Jewish is a killer one. However, most of the movie relies on the audience recognizing the tropes such as when Paul Rudd spouts exposition or the best friend encourages or discourages depending on that part of the script. While the movie occassionally reaches Wet Hot American Summer levels of absurdity (such as the part where her parents test boyfriends by trying to seduce them and then turn out to be white supremacists), too much is standard sitcom whackiness.

I even watched all the special features - a fantastic 'making of' that is about 30 minutes plus at least 30 minutes plus of hilarious deleted scenes - and I almost never take the time to do so. Not only are Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler both completely in their element and on the top of their respective games (both as actors and as comedians) here, the supporting cast is a who's-who of modern comedy - Michael Ian Black, Ken Marino, Cobie Smulders, Max Greenfield, Bill Hader, Ed Helms, Kenan Thompson, Jack McBrayer, Jason Mantzoukas (yeah!), Christoper Meloni, Ellie Kemper... and plenty more that offer such great surprises with their appearances that I feel like it would be a spoiler to name them here.

Christopher Meloni has a very memorable scene at a Halloween party that is just crazy!

6450999,4,B00KVFHBLK,"They Came Together views more like a series of skits than a traditionally told story. At times the storyline doesn't flow smoothly between parodies of different movie key scenes the writing effort is in the gags more so than the overall story.  The premise is basically a series of flashbacks as to how a couple met then later decided to marry told in a restaurant table conversation with another couple.  Of course along the way there were plenty of things that went wrong, they broke up got back together and dated other people.  It's a quite disjointed movie, but the skits are quite fun and make fun of your mass produced chick flick romance film scenarios. If you're familiar with the original movies being parodied, this obviously helps.  I also enjoyed the large number of minor character appearances of main but not the  lead actors from successful TV shows.  Such as the woman who played Charlie's stalker neighbour from Two and a Half Men, the serious cop from Law and Order SVU, Robin from How I Met Your Mother, the annoying guy from New Girl and many others, even Judge Judy makes an appearance a few times in this film.

I had a long drive ahead of me, so why not rent a movie to keep me awake, a comedy that would make me laugh?  Oh wait, here's something available... let's choose an actor I've actually heard was funny, Amy Pohler.  Now I couldn't watch the movie while driving, so it had to be funny in a dialog sort of way.  Let me say that whatever these actors were paid, it was too much.  If they showed up for free, it was a waste of film.  I understand it was an unusual movie, but it was so ridiculous that it was a bore.  Others suggest it was a parody, but clearly it was just another unimaginative dud.  The dialogue was offensive and you got the idea that a 15 yr old boy wrote the scrip about his sex life.  I didn't care much for 15 yr old boys way back then, I sure don't care now.

  Is there a way to find someone creative in Hollywood?  They must surely be hiding.  About 45 minutes into this, I'd had enough and went back to the radio.

6451045,3,B00KVFHBLK,"Most movies are redundant.  Let's face it, how many times do we think ""jeez, this is the same movie I saw a year ago.""  Sure the actors change, special effects become more special, and you just know something evil is behind that door...or not.  I can't think of any genre guiltier of this than romantic comedies.  Director and co-writer David Wain gave us a taste of a satirical stab at movies with ""Wet Hot American Summer"" and more recently with ""Wanderlust.""

Here Wain has a couple of his regulars, Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler playing a couple having dinner with another couple (Ellie Kemper and Bill Hader).  They are exchanging the usual banter when Joel (Rudd) and Molly (Poehler) are asked how they met.  What we then see is a flashback to their story.  Using every clich and plot trick ever used, they restage how they were initially involved with others, meet cute, get together, break up, get back together, etc.  Of course this is all grins and giggles as Hollywood is continually skewered.

Some have compared this film with some of the Zucker brother's spoofs like ""Airplane.""  I would suggest, it is a little smarter and less laugh-out-loud-funny.  I suspect more than one movie goer has seen this movie and just didn't get it.  I don't want to suggest that there aren't some very funny scenes however.  One of the best has Joel coming home early from work to surprise his then girlfriend (Cobie Smulders).  She's been having an affair with one of Joel's co-workers (Michael Ian Black).  Joel is too dim to see all the signs that something is going on in the bedroom right now.

My guess is that all the participants had a hard time keeping a straight face much of the time.  Good editing helps.  I would grant that the movie isn't much more than an extended Saturday Night Live sketch but hey, it only clocks in at 84 minutes.

The Blu ray disc includes the usual 1080p encoding with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The overall look is excellent.  Colors are bold and accurate as represented in Molly's cutesy candy store.  Interior scenes are sharp and well detailed.  The exterior New York locations are well shot and are ""another character"" as the cast constantly remind us.  The audio comes from a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and is excellent if unspectacular.  Nothing stands out but that other character, New York, involves the surrounds during the numerous street scenes.  Dialog is clear and focused.  Subtitles are available in English including SDH and Spanish.  Extras include a commentary with Wain and co-writer, Michael Showalter, a featurette which includes some interviews, a table read, a trailer and 34 minutes of deleted scenes.",1416528000,,2655,4.786343612334802

6451077,5,B00KVFHBLK,"This movie is way underrated for what it is, and it's because people started watching it with misguided expectations.  ""Hey, this isn't a feature-length Parks and Rec episode!  Here comes my one-star rating wrath!""

This is a David Wain/Michael Showalter joint.  They have a core audience that has grown to love their particular comedic sensibilities.  For those in the know, this film fills the order nicely.  Is it to the caliber of Wet Hot American Summer or Role Models?  Not in my opinion, but it's a solid entry that can be most likened to The Baxter.  Whereas The Baxter focused primarily on one particular rom-com trope (the nice guy who ultimately loses the girl back to her meant-to-be partner), They Came Together is a top-to-bottom genre send-up.  Consequently it's much more sardonic than Baxter, which was actually a pretty genuine rom-com by comparison.  Nearly every line is over-the-top satire and, while never explicitly broken, the fourth wall is pretty thin due to inclusions like embarrassingly-obvious exposition.  I think a lot of viewers take that as a sign of a bad movie, because it totally is, but they don't realize in this case it's fully intentional to mock the lame exposition in bad rom-coms.  It's like when people on Facebook read a headline from The Onion and the satire is too meta for them to process, so they get mad.

Bottom line - if you've consistently enjoyed these guys' post-""The State"" offerings (WHAS, Stella, Wainy Days, The Baxter, The Ten, Wanderlust, etc) you'll get a lot of laughs and enjoy seeing familiar faces.  Also you have to love New York because, you know, it's almost like a character itself.

One more thing I want to say to people who have said this is a career-killer for Rudd/Poehler, that they can't imagine why they would be in a movie like this... hey, guess what.  They love this stuff.  This brand of comedy is right up their alley.  Do you really want to weigh your comedic sensibilities against theirs?",1414108800,3,1974,4.824404761904762

And if you are expecting a traditional romantic-comedy, it isn't that either.  It's a little more subtle than either one of those.  Like some other good comedies of late [shall I name Secret Life of Walter Mitty?] its humor is more subtle than the average American audience seems to expect.  Actually what it seems to do is take every tradition of a romantic comedy and basically make a mockery of it.  Sometimes it seems to even satirize its own satire.  But in the end, it is all in good fun.  It even has a more-or-less feel-good end, so it does, perversely, count as a romantic comedy---just one that alludes to maybe a dozen or more prior films and satirizes them somehow.  Poeler is fairly restrained as far as zaniness (except for over-the-top clutziness); Rudd is more his usual, reasonably charming self.  The specials on the Blu-Ray explain the film barely got made, it was really filmed using city streets and scenes, which means set up and takes had to be done very quickly, and the director originally conceived it as simply a story of the relationship between Pohler and Rudd-- but somehow, it just wasn't enough--that's when the idea was conceived of telling the entire story as a back-flash as the two of them meet [an even more dysfunctional] couple for dinner, who ask how they met.  Somehow this added just the right feeling of framing and depth to the story [plus introducing another zany couple].

This movie is not for everyone.  It is a dry humor and definitely more of an indie movie than a traditional Hollywood movie.  If you like t.v. and movies like A Very Brady Movie, Portlandia, Safety Not Guaranteed, and 30 Rock, you will probably like this movie.  The thing I didn't like about this movie is they could easily have made it PG-13 by taking out a few things that added nothing to the plot line.  But in the grand scheme of movies that Paul Rudd has starred in that he takes humor and raunchiness too far, this is one of his tamer movies.  There are some parts that are pretty cheesy and you kind of feel like the characters don't need to keep reiterating the joke over and over.  SNL does this at times.  But this movie was unexpected and I do plan to watch it with other people I know will appreciate it.  It's not a movie I would watch tons of times like some romantic comedies, but this is a movie you can watch with your boyfriend or husband and they will laugh because it smoofs all the things they probably hate about romantic comedies.

This is the first and only time I've felt compelled to write a review. I saw this in the theater as soon as it came out, because I'm a huge David Wain and Wet Hot American Summer fan. Not only were the employees of the theater criticizing the film, ""It was too aware of itself,"" but the other moviegoers barely mustered a chuckle while watching. OF COURSE it's aware of itself!!! It's a G-D parody!

6451184,2,B00KVFHBLK,"There have been several times where I've sat in a theater, watching a comedy, where--as one of the oldest people in the theater---I was often the only person laughing at a humorous situation.  The twenty and thirty-somethings just sat there, unless the joke was so broad as to be unmistakably meant to be laughed at---it was as if a ""Laugh"" sign was needed to cue them.  This film would seem to be aimed at that crowd.  If you have any movie watching history at all---if you've seen parodies like ""Blazing Saddles"" or ""What's Up Doc"" (both from the early 70's) or any of the work of the Masters of Old Hollywood (let alone Woody Allen), the level of art and craft displayed in this movie is going to seem less than zero.

That said, it does have its funny moments, it's just that those who find Will Ferrell funny will find more of said moments.  It seems that the SNL alumni are in a race to the bottom, to out-devolve Ferrell as an adult child.  That and the idea that the early part of the film feels like it was as much inspired by the art house/cable success of ""Portlandia"" on the part of other SNL alumni, and these folks simply set the idea back to its NYC roots.

It's a send up of romantic comedies, and starts as a double date between two couples, with one seemingly happily married couple asking their friends, newly together, how they met, and the story is told in backflash mode from there.  A lot of self absorbed comedians over indulging themselves while the adults are taking a call from the Coast is how much of the film spools out.  I realize that my interest in Amy Poehler was a five minute affair during her stint with Tina Fey playing Sarah Palin, and we were watching Tina, not Amy.

And then there's the race issue.  SNL has a few non-white cast members.  Romantic comedies are often almost entirely one race, depending on the audience intended for the film.  This parody's' whiteness pretty much demands comment.  There's only one main character who isn't white, and she plays the typical ""mammy"" role, as sound board to the idiocy of a spoiled white brat, offering sage advice with a dollop of black attitude.  Really? They couldn't have diversified the film a little bit more?  A bunch of SNL vets get together to make a film commenting on a genre of films, and they made no effort to make a racial comment with significant roles for non-white players?

So no, despite the real laughs at many points, I would not recommend this film to anyone I liked.  And I'm glad I rented it to stream instead of going to the theater to see it,",1410566400,,2558,4.452789699570816

6451206,4,B00KVFHBLK,"There is a plot synopsis on the back of the DVD cover, so it is hard to spoil the plot, which wasn't important. Raul Rudd plays Robert Hays in this spoof of Romantic comedies. There were lines which made me chuckle while there were boring predictable scenes like the one in the bar which was pointless and seemed endless. The scene with his grandmother could have been left out. Its crudeness lacked humor, especially since they did a similar scene just before that.

The dialogue was bad by design, especially the end speech by Rudd, which in reality would have never worked. While the film has hit and miss humor, it is no ""Airplane"" which was an iconic film.

I liked how they tried to work in metaphors which are overly used, especially in Indie films. I was amused by the film, had some chuckle out loud moments, and had some scenes making me look for the remote. No belly laughs. I thought ""Friends with Benefits"" was a funnier parody of romantic comedies, while being one. 3 1/2 stars

Worth renting for a laugh.

It would appear to me that the haters either never saw a chick flick or have and don't appreciate their beloved genre sent up.  If one hasn't noticed a lot of chick flicks are self parodies anyway.  Case in point ""Safe Haven"" and ""About Time"".  What director David Wain attempts in an economic 84 minutes is cram all the cliches of the form in and not unlike the film parodies of Brooks and the Zuckers and Abrahams some of the jokes work and some don't but you move on from the clunkers.  We have all the character types from the non-threatening Jewish hero, the klutzy heroine, the African-American best bud and the omniscient but jobless younger brother.  Add to that new archetypes like the boss who soils his costume at the Halloween party, the white supremacist parents, and the Irish bartender that is of no consolation.  Indelible scene from the film involves our lovers frollicking in the leaves in the park only for the camera to reveal a dead body in the pile.  Ultimately this is a success for Wain and his stars Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler.

After meeting at a bookstore the next day and discovering they both like fiction books and coffee they decide to give it one more try. I will start by saying that I laughed the entire way through and really enjoyed it. My wife on the other hand did not like it at all. This movie is an Airplane style spoof of romantic comedies. Every cliche from that genre is in here. The arrogant co-worker who thinks he's better then you. The un-trusting sister and the surprise son who loves the new boyfriend. The break up scene which leads to Molly marrying someone not right for her...etc... They are all in here and all are really funny when they come up. Since this is essentially a spoof movie there really isn't too much to say about it but I will say that I really enjoyed it and laughed a ton.

6451282,1,B00KVFHBLK,"This movie is a non-stop spoof of romance movies, making fun of plot elements and dialogue exchanges that admittedly have been overused, but it is so relentless that the spoofing itself is over-done and becomes almost a parody of itself; that is, a parody of how to spoof romance movies.  After a certain point it became predictable and even tiresome.  The humor was also raunchier than it needed to be to make the point.  My greatest regrets about watching this movie are that I spent almost 90 minutes of my allotted lifespan doing it and actually paid good money for the privilege.",1406764800,3,584,4.705882352941177

6451312,5,B00KVFHBLK,"Wow, so many people just really miss the joke here. The general reaction to this film reminds me of what people originally said of ""Idiocracy,"" another cult movie which casual and inexperienced viewers initially dismissed as so stupid and dumb. In reality, it takes a certain intelligence and taste to get that sort of humor, and this film is a perfect parody of romantic comedies.

The laughs comes as fast as possible. Whether in outright gross out gags, or sly plays on camerawork and editing, the film doesn't hold back in its range of wry humor. Fans are comparing it to ""Wet Hot American Summer"" because it has the same director, but really this movie is closer to ""Airplane!"" or ""I'm Gonna Get You Sucka."" Indeed, there are many ridiculously stupid moments in this film where the characters act like utter imbeciles. But that's because of its clever mocking of the genre's silliest tropes and cliches. The more familiar you are with the 90s works of, say, Julia Roberts and Renee Zellwegger, the more you'll enjoy this movie.

Throw in a plethora of guest stars, and this movie was a real treat. I also really enjoyed its lithe 83-minute runtime. Too many features today are 2 hours long with 30 minutes of boring fat. So this was a nice, light date movie, perfect for couples who don't want to sit on their butts for the entire date.",1406073600,2,1341,4.654008438818566

It's definitely not the kind of thing they've become known for. But screenwriters Wain and Showalter have made comedy like this their bread and butter, and they continue to own it here. This send-up of romcoms has the same exorbitantly sarcastic tone and intentionally poor acting of the ""Stella"" shorts and Comedy Central series. Those only ever had a cult following, so perhaps it's unrealistic to expect that tone to have mass appeal. ""We Came Together"" may not be for everyone, but it succeeds thoroughly at what it tries to be. If you are a fan of the screenwriters, and know what to expect, you should be pleased. It's not quite Wet Hot American Summer or The Baxter, but it's really enjoyable if you like this particular flavor of Wain/Showalter humor.",1405814400,,915,4.7974683544303796

Wain and Showalter seem to have a firm grasp on making war on laughter, which for me churns out a deeply rooted sense of how absurd it is to be alive, on a planet, floating in space without any definitive reason, and to be able to laugh about it.

It truly is making fun of every kind of person involved with someone who idolizes their cheesy romance story. There are little funny tidbits off to the side as well. In the opening scene Paul Rudd seems to really like his wine. Bill Hader is a hoot and there are a lot of comics who fill in some good laughs.

You have your next (cult) classic comedy. I haven't laughed this hard maybe ever. Will the film hold up on repeat viewings? I'm not sure. But this is just ingenious comedy writing. It's the wackiest film I've ever seen in my life.

Every single scene is a satire of something in an actual romantic comedy. Yet, that would get old quick if the scenes didn't have INSANE jokes too. Luckily, the scenes do.

This movie isn't going to be for everyone as I can see the rating is at like a 6.2/10. But if you like wacky humor and you liked the movies I listed above, I would give this movie a chance.
