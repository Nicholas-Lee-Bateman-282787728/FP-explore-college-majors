894226,5,6304520735,"The spawn series on HBO, is in my opinion the greatist series ever. A few years ago when i was in the hospital all i did was read spawn and watch this movie. I give this movie 5 stars because of its incredible story line and the creativity that Todd McFarlin brings to the screen.

894227,5,6304520735,At a time when animation has been exiled to Saturday morning and lighthearted Disney fare Todd MacFarlane's Spawn proves that this is a medium for serious storytelling. Spawn is not like anything you've seen coming out of American animation studios. It combines a gripping film noir style story with spectacular visual elements which the DVD format really helps to enhance. The only things wrong with this DVD is that it's a two sided disc making it difficult to handle and potentially easy to damage. Other than that this DVD is a must own!!,998784000,,542,4.838709677419355
894228,3,6304520735,"This is the first compilation of the Spawn animated series. Its a bit slow in its plot. But very aggressive in its grasp of reality. A fan of hardcore anime or spawn would like this very much. The first tape mostly tells the story of how Spawn came to be and what his mission is, as he sees it. In  comparison to the 2nd and 3rd tapes it is a bit slow, but still  entertaining a good start to an excellent series.",956275200,3,413,4.024390243902439
894229,5,6304520735,I bought this disc after I saw the live movie. This animated version is much better! If your a kid see the Spawn movie that would hook a kid aged 4-10. But this is what Spawn is really about an unwilling hero caught in a  cross-fire with heaven and hell. Trying to keep his sanity as he tries to  walk the path that will end his suffering. Spawn live action is like a  kiddie version of something that is not supposed to be. Spend your money on  this!,953424000,3,451,4.090909090909091
894230,5,6304520735,"I bought this DVD after watching the live action version. I had heard from numerous friends that this ""cartoon"" was amazing but I was  floored.

894231,5,6304520735,"Ive been a big fan of the spawn comic book since the very first issue.  Living in England its not so easy to get hold of the books, or this  animated series. The unrated version is fantastic, a really good move from  the book to the screen, all the darkness as been brought to us in this dvd.  The extra features such as the extra audio track that runs along with the  show by Todd is great, lots of interesting stuff here. I really recomend  this dvd to all spawn fans especially all of us in england who don't want to  pay a fortune for the vhs tapes of it. I cant wait for season 2.

894275,5,6304520735,"Al Simmons (voiced by Keith David) was a soldier who fought and killed for his country, his wife Wanda wanted children but suddenly Al was murdered. He got sent to hell as the dark lord Malbogia gave him a chance to be back on Earth again as a hellspawn warrior. He finds himself set 5 years after his death only to discover that his skin and face is horribly disfigured but has a special suit made of necroplasm including a mask he can make to cover his hideousness and has special powers including to control his chains as he is fighting evil to save the innocence. Guided by a kind former hellspawn now immortal man named Cogliostro (Voiced by Richard Dystart) as his guardian, Al searches for the woman he loves while being taunted by a wisecracking demonic Clown who knows how he got here and what is he now. Al discovers that his best friend Terry Fitzgerald (Victor Love) is married to Wanda and has a daughter named Cyan which is a shock to him as he will find out his origin soon enough. He befriends friendly bums such as Gareb (Michael Mcshane), Bobby (Victor Love and more as he has sworn to protect his territory from unwelcomed intruders. Al's former boss Jason Wynn (John Raft Lee) is trying to cover up for the sadistic child murders of a sick killer named Billy Kincaid who is a mad ice-cream man that is the son of a respected US senator McMillian (Ronny Cox) and helping out with gangster Tony Twist (James Keane) who wants to find out what has been killing his men as Detectives Sam Burke (James Keane) and Twitch (Michael Mcshane) are out hunting for the killers of the men.

An excellent first season to a groundbreaking animated series and one of the greatest animated shows of all time. Todd Mcfarlane created a very original and intriguing comic book in 1993 for Image comics and was selling like hot-cakes and became a comic icon for years spawing toys and merchandise then in 1996 they announced an animated series would be made but not as a saturday morning cartoon but a hard R-rated style adult animated series as HBO picked it up. It hit high ratings on May of 1997 including me when i was 15 as i have been a fan of Spawn since the first issue, this series blew my mind away. It's no kiddie show that's for sure as it has graphic bloody violence, some sexual situations, some nudity and language to some drug use but also adult themes of espionage, politicians and crime investigation to even solid storytelling. I love how it actually sticks to the source material and is faithful to the comics, Todd Mcfarlane being one of the producers make it worthwhile including excellent writing to Batman and Gargoyles style animation.

This DVD has nice extras like storyboards, interview with Todd Mcfarlane and trailer to live-action Spawn movie including bios of the characters such as Violator for example.",1309824000,,2834,4.6099009900990096
894276,5,6304520735,Great introduction to the series. After five years in hell Al Simmons is back to reclaim his life and his wife. But he soon finds out that things are not that simple.,1297641600,,166,4.21875
894277,2,6304520735,"In the audio commentary on this disc, Todd McFarlane says that he included a lot of violence and sexual situations in this first season to grab the viewer's attention and let them know what kind of show Spawn is going to be, and he isn't kidding. Also, this first season is overwhelmed with constant voiceovers by the Cogliostro character. He is constantly telling us what Spawn is going through emotionally, which is sometimes helpful in providing information on Spawn's past and present situations, but only until he starts repeating himself. Once you've heard about how Spawn is going through a deep inner conflict, struggling to regain his humanity, I promise you won't need to hear it again. Rather than hear him tell me about Spawn, I would prefer to see Spawn show us what he is going through on his own, especially with the wonderful voice work for the Spawn character by Keith David. These two aspects of this first season almost overshadow the basic themes and characters that make Spawn an interesting story to begin with. But luckily, the show's creators are more focused in the second year, and all the explanation and mood-setting done in this lesser first attempt set up what is a much better second season.",1146614400,2,1222,4.8238095238095235
894278,2,6304520735,"First of all, I've never read the comics

This movie could have been good if it wasn't for the terrible writers and director. The animation was well done and so was the story, but the movie became muddied down by gratituous, needless violence and sex...not that I'm against that, but there is such a thing as goign overboard and this movie did that.

The voice acting was well done also, espcieally with spawn himself.

It's too bad..this movie had the potential to be great",1144886400,,474,4.619047619047619
894279,4,6304520735,"If such a genre exists, you can think of this as 'tormented guy from hell noir.'  Al Simmons, once a federal agent with a talent for wetwork, is killed, goes to hell, and is offered a deal.  If he is willing to become a general in hell's army, he can see his former wife, Wanda, once again.  And so this delightful piece of animation begins.  Simmons is now Spawn, back on earth with almost no memory, and the more he finds out, the less he likes.  Perhaps the deepest blow is that Wanda has married Simmons best friend and now has the child that Simmons could never give her.

Spawn, desolate, confused, and torn between his own nature and hell's plans sulks in the dark alleyways where one the homeless are his company.  Or so it would be if the cover up of a child killing, illegitimate son of a presidential hopeful hadn't intruded in this dark no-man's-land.  Spawn, a super-powered killing machine takes out a small army of mafia clean-up men.  Soon this first confrontation turns into an escalating battle with the mafia, the senator, and clandestine government killers.  Spawn always wins the fights, but sometimes the price is too high.

Inevitably the struggle extends itself to Spawn's ex-wife and her family.  Cyan, their little girl, falls into the hands of the serial killer and he must ruturn to the fray or allow her to be killed.  At this moment, he must decide whether he will keep his deal with the devil or attempt to become his own agent.  But save the child or not, kill the child molester or not, Spawn's will always be an outcast of the human race.  He is something only a demon could love.

The directing team does a fine job of taking Todd McFarlane's original graphic stories and making an animated film from them.  This is American style animation, not Japanese, so expect strong illustration and use os stark shadows and edgy lighting.  Expect a love of violence and strong language as well.  This was written for a mature audience, and expletives are definitely not deleted.  I found this animated version much stronger than the film, but they're both a great deal of fun.",1134172800,3,2102,4.61455525606469
894280,5,6304520735,"Si has leido los primeros captulos del comic pues ahora los podras ver en vdeo, perfectamente adaptada, se ve la mano del maestro McFarlane, muy buen trabajo de adaptacin, solo falta mejorar las animaciones, pero de ahi en fuera todo Excelente!",1124841600,2,244,4.975609756097561
894281,5,6304520735,"I've read the comics and watched the cartoon and I say they're pretty much equal. Both for different reasons but the bottom line is this cartoon rocks! It's so dark, the voice acting is great, the story follows very closey to the original comic version (although there are subtle and rather minor changes), and the animation is great. If you like the comic, you'll probably like these episodes. On a side note, this cartoon in no way is represented by the pile of crap that was thrown on the movie screen how ever long ago. Let's hope the rumours of a Todd McFarlane supervised Spawn movie are true.",1124496000,6,599,4.555555555555555
894326,4,6304520735,"Well, I just wasn't sure what to expect.  For the most part, I enjoy all animations.  But when I saw this dvd on sale, I couldn't pass it up for the buck.  I am not a Todd McFarland fan.  Actually I ran into his profile on the Animatrix DVD.  Oddly they didn't show any of his work, since the extras cover anime.

So I guess this guy was to be compared to Peter Chung and maybe some of the other famous animators of our time.  Which to my belief was just how astonishing of a production quality the story was.  Spawn is your typical anti-hero figure.  For an american animation, it certainly has the so badly needed blood scenes, violence and realism that seems to be a void in this country.  Yes, I would compare Spawn more to Wicked City, or Demon City Shinjuku, more than Spiderman, Hulk etc..

Why?  Simple, McFarland is trying to enter the comic book arena, but doesn't realize that this DVD has lots of closeness to some of the Japanese animation.  The bloody scenes, the sometime adult violence, and of course a sidesick which in himself is a servant of the devil.  I immediately saw this clown character to the funny character in Wicked City.  It's a common myth in Japanese demon culture.  I'm sure McFarland wasn't aware of that when he created this character.

As for the DVD, wow 140 minutes seemed like a long time, but it was necessary to illustrate the story.  The part that really bothers me is that it's a double sided disk.  Why?  Obviously DVDs have plenty of space for one movie.  It's just a hassle to change it around during the middle of the movie.  VCDs ... are the same.

I do really enjoy Spawn as a story.  Too bad it's a superhero category.  It would be nice to add other elements like more creatures and realms.  But i'm debating on the second episode.",1114646400,3,1781,4.386503067484663

it shocks

makes you laugh a little

possibly puke out your guts (not literally) if you can't handle gore

it's not for the faint of heart

it's one powerful, gripping, shocking, funny at times, serious action animation movie. I read the comics. played with the toys. and more. Todd McFarlane is a genious with Spawn. in all Spawn is more the good guy. he's just living in one confusing situation between heaven and hell. this is an awesome movie and would recommend it for older viewers like 17 and up. that or ask parents permission first. and if you go out and kill people because you saw it in a movie people. then you yourselves need just as much help as the sickos out there. so enjoy the movies for what they are. but don't imitate what you see.

894328,5,6304520735,"I love the Spawn comics, and the animated series (but I hated the live-action movie). This is truly awesome. If you can stand the content, language, and yes even a little nudity, it is definitely worth watching. It has a lot of action, romance, and espionage, there is a lot of talking about political debates, along with shooting, chasing, and awesome visual effects. The story is kind of funky, but if you pay attention to it, youll start to understand it. Although not for all people, it is not a religious movie, I am a Christian, and go to church, but this is just too cool to stay away from. All 3 seasons are excellent, the 2nd isn't nearly as good as the others, but still good. So in conculsion, I say, skip Spawn the Movie, and go for Todd McFarlane's Spawn: The Animated Series!!!",1090454400,2,791,4.462068965517242

crying out loud!  Its one of the best comics ever made!
I have all videos.  There very good.  Espissialy the second season.  The first season was outstanding too.
This series is very ADULT orienteted.  With lots of graphic violence to make a 10 year old cry.  The series is awsome bottom line.  Its a damn shame they haven't thought of making a 4th season but there to busy with the comic and lot has gone on for the comic so were should they start for a 4th season?
the 3rd season left alot of people thinking what was going to happen next.  I doublt HBO will want a 4th I just think that.
Over all the spawn series is great.
I also wanted to mention....if people didn't know....this is not a movie.  Its episodes from the HBO series.  All the spawn videos are from the HBO series.  They just put all the episodes together to make it look like a movie.  I don't get how this is a collecters uncut mature edition.....THE SERIES WAS FOR MATURE AUDIENCES!  And now I see on the front cover its suppose to be
a uncut collecters addition.  Well anyways the series on Tv was
wasnt censored either I don't get why they said uncut collecters addition when the damn series was for adults on tv.  Well what ever, If you want to buy the tape on sale get it now cause the series is awsome.  But for the people who watched on HBO like me who taped it than don't get the tape.

894330,4,6304520735,"The origional, uncut Spawn, was most likely, the BEST animated film of all time. My name is Kenneth McFarlane, and I've looked up Todd's history, and realized what he went through. I have a game in creation. this started WAY before I knew about spawn, and when i found out that he was creating spawn in high school, i was astonished. I'm 16 years old, and I've come a long way with my story. If my findings are correct, Todd is a distant relative of mine, and if so...Final Darkness should come out, all too well.

894331,3,6304520735,"""Todd McFarlane's Spawn"" appears to be a cartoon remake of the 1985 film ""Commando"" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Al, a former Special Forces operative, awakens to find himself a dead, hell-spawned warrior.  Al battles evil foes (including some Special Forces operatives) and rescues his former wife's daughter.  Take Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""Commando"", add hellfire and brimstone, and you have ""Todd McFarlane's Spawn"".
""Todd McFarlane's Spawn"" is entertaining (some of the chain tricks *are* used during real life oil drilling), but I prefer Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""Commando"" (which features Arnold at his peak and young teen Alyssa Milano as Arnold's kidnapped daughter).",1051488000,,678,5.8979591836734695
894332,5,6304520735,"The movie was one of the worst I had seen in my life. I did not have high hope for the animated series but I was very much surprised. The dialogue and, bizzarly enough, the acting are a hundred times as good as the film and the plot and characters are also much more intriguing.
This is the first season of Spawn. And a great way for the uninitiated to get into it. There is no tedious exposition or any of that rubbish. Just a great set-up of characters and cool stories. But since this has stopped airing as of 1999 there has been no fourth season. It's a shame since the one thing I can be sure ofis that the story could have had one hell of a send-off when it finally climaxes.
It's more than likely in syndication somewhere so I'd start watching this if I were you. But be prepared. The violence is quite graphic and the overall tone of the stories ranges from kiddie fiddlers to satanic demons. Needless to say, it's not a cartoon for kids. It's an animated series for adults.
The DVD is in full screen format, as originally drawn and is in Dolby 2.0 surround. All three of the Spawn animated series DVD are flippers with 3 half hour shows on each side of the disc.",1038355200,7,1171,4.232142857142857

Just like the Heavy Metal series, there's plenty of gore, cursing, and nudity, to the point it's disturbing! It stays loyal to the comic, as in the characters are all drawn the same way, the plot's the same (unlike the live-action movie;but it's still good), and all the chracters' attitudes are the same. I believe it was directed by Todd McFarlane (creater), so you can see why. If it seems familar, you probably have amensia or have HBO, which this aired on for about a year or so.
