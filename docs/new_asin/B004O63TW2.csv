8436968,4,B004O63TW2,This examines the 100 or so years of oil production and the prices as well has how they occurred. Oil men share their experiences and Presidents (file footage) bemoan the increasing prices and aspire to direct blame. Occasional insight. Charlie Wilson mentioned.,1490140800,,262,5.261904761904762
8436969,4,B004O63TW2,"First: I'm in no sense any fan of the oil industry. (Best I can say, WRT morality, is that at least they're probably better than the coal industry.) But this video gives you an up-close view of the mindset and culture of that part of the economy. I thought the guy from the Sierra Club basically nailed it, early on, saying that these are not bad guys, they're just stuck in the old paradigm, the one from decades ago. This is what they're into, and naturally they're going to view the World in a certain way that fits with that. You are what you do.

I actually found it encouraging to see, near the end, some of those oilmen getting into renewable energy. Even they are starting to see what is getting more and more obvious.",1388361600,2,726,4.338235294117647
8436970,1,B004O63TW2,"I thought it was supposed to be about the energy crisis but it was 90% oil men laughing at the average person and environmentalist as being ignorant. I can tell you most of what they said were flat out lies. The people they interviewed make their money from exploiting oil so they are heavily biased. One claimed there were actually more caribou BECAUSE of pipe lines. Really? Care to prove that BS? All I hear from energy companies is if you let us drill in this pristine spot we'll do better than the last time. Just west of the nature reserve they are desperate to drill is prudhoe bay. I dare anyone that supports drilling in the nature reserve to take a look at pictures of that sewer. They destroyed it! Why are they so desperate to drill in Anwar? The pipe line is getting old and it won't survive much longer so they want to rush in and drain Anwar before the leaks in the pipe line make it uneconomical to keep pumping. Does that sound like they will be careful and protect the bay or are they looking to make a quick buck? I'm dead wrong? I dare you to look up the facts. The oil will make no difference on the domestic supply and odds are they will ship it out of country anyway. FYI that's why they want to pipe line from Canada. They plan to ship the oil out of country from ports in Texas. How is that going to help us? They kept whining about regulations and not being allowed to drill anywhere they wanted. Nation wide it's less than 5% of land that is restricted but for some reason they consider that 5% the most critical. Why? Because they can drill on the other land any time they want so they put all their effort into freeing up places they aren't allowed to drill. If you want to know what deregulated drilling looks like look at what was done in South America and Africa. That's the oil company dream, do what you want and never worry about cleaning up the mess. Is that what we want for our national parks???? They are the most profitable industry on the planet and all they do is whine about how they could make even more money if they could ram through deregulation!!! Avoid this documentary like the plague and look for one more balanced!",1366675200,,2166,4.311274509803922
