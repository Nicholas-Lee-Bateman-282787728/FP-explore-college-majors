1681585,3,B000060MWM,"Set in Latin America, ""SPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT 2002"" is the perfect antidote to, well, just about everything that's unsettling, disturbing and ugly.  There's no story here, just a bevy of impossibly beautiful and seemingly natural young women in exotic locations posing for the annual ""Sports Illustrated"" swimsuit issue.  Yamila Diaz-Rahi serves as on screen host in this slick production that tags along with 16 young women (including Josie Maran, Molly Sims, Heidi Klum, Shakara Ledars and Petra Nemcova) on their private photo shoots in Brazil, Guatamala, Costa Rica, Argentina and other Latin hot spots.  This easy on the eye 60 minute digital distraction makes the case that if beauty is only skin deep, that is, indeed, deep enough.",1023235200,5,743,5.279661016949152
1681586,5,B000060MWM,"This DVD covering the 2002 swimsuit edition is better than a plate of warm Mrs. Field's cookies.
Set in Latin America, we visit with the most scorching hot girls in the world on their personal photo shoots.  A majority of the models are latin as well.  Each chapter seemingly becomes better than the one before, and I found myself pondering which girl is really the most beautiful.  Is it possible to determine?  It's like trying all the fruits of the earth and loving each one for a different reason.  I had to start from the beginning more than once to see if they were all as equally talented as I remembered.  I even ran through the entire DVD in super slow mode.  It was my day off.
Is it too late to change my career to oil boy?  Will I ever have the good fortune to cross paths with Melissa Keller?  Does Petra Nemcova like the Yankees too?  These are questions I keep running through my head as I get ready for another day.  A day I will be sure to appreciate the simplest things in life (like a chili pepper bikini) thanks to this DVD.
On a final note, Yamila Diaz-Rahi does such an amazing job as SI's host, it would be a good idea for the producers at CBS to have her replace Bryant Gumble on ""The Early Show"", since a position will soon be available.",1019779200,5,1262,4.260504201680672

Yamila Diaz-Rahi, Vanessa Lorenzo, Isabeli Fontana, and Petra Nemcova are definitely my favorite.",1416787200,,314,4.7272727272727275

not only do you watch hot chicks but get to travel to different places.",1337472000,,156,4.233333333333333
7957496,5,B000060MWM,"Yamila Diaz-Rahi is my favorite model from Argentina, but the Xipolitakis sisters, Victoria and Estefania, are sexy too. Yamila is a wonderful 170 cm. tall Spanish-Lebanese lady with an 85/58.5/89 cm. figure born in 1975, and she is a great choice to be the covergirl of both magazine and video. I once had all of the ""SI"" swimsuit issues back to 1967, but some relatives took much of my property. I'm replacing some of my favorite issues, e.g. this one, and buying more of the videos. I recently ordered both the magazine and the video for 2002 from ""amazon.com"". This may be my favorite SI swimsuit video of all. Competition is close between it and the 1989 one. Yamila is my favorite girl on it, and she is really sexy in it in a T-back and a skin-tight bikini. Josie Maran, Petra Nemcova and Melissa Keller are sexy too. I won't list all of the models, just my favorites. Heidi Klum is in it, but she isn't my type.",1316044800,,919,4.443786982248521

7957499,5,B000060MWM,"In my opinion, the best DVD of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit is this one of 2002 : its segments, amalgamated by the leitmotiv of the latin atmosphere with its images , colours and musics, are disposed with order and well presented by Yamila Diaz .
The quality of the photography is excellent and better than in other DVDs of SI.",1041379200,4,326,4.5423728813559325
