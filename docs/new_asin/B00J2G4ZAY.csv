6316271,1,B00J2G4ZAY,No subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing. Not even closed captions. In this day an age of electronics? Selling it for more than a two cents is a scam!,1414195200,3,155,4.032258064516129
6316272,5,B00J2G4ZAY,"Waited years for this to be released on DVD. Couldn't be happier (unless of course, they had released it sooner). Until now I had to put up with my VHS recording of this movie (with commercials).",1407888000,4,195,4.444444444444445
6316273,4,B00J2G4ZAY,"Andy Griffith as Sheriff -- interesting casting?

Griffith made 3 TV movies with the idea that it might become a new series.  It didn't.  He plays a small-town sheriff in all three films.  This story is a little convoluted and not very satisfying when the ""mystery"" is solved.  The ending seems somewhat forced -- like, okay, let's wrap this movie up.

That being said, the acting is good, and if you liked the other two movies, you will probably like this one -- just not as much. The other two are Winter Kill (1974) and Deadly Game (1977 -- released same year as this one).  Both are better than this one.

For a guy who started out with a hillbilly comedy routine on radio, he turned out to be a pretty good actor, certainly an enduring one, who was able to constantly play essentially the same role(s) all his life.",1407801600,9,820,4.42

6316277,5,B00J2G4ZAY,If you like Matlock then I believe you'll like this DVD. It needs to be apart of your Library if you are a Andy Griffith fan.,1403049600,2,125,3.8461538461538463
6316278,5,B00J2G4ZAY,If you don't like Andy Griffith at the top of his game then I don't recommend this movie. The movie is a bit slow but that's the way the script was written. The cast works really well together and there is no one better suited to play a small town chief of police  Andy Griffith. After all he's been doing it since the fifties. If you like this movie I recommend you check out some of his other made for television movies.,1401408000,6,422,4.146341463414634

6316280,5,B00J2G4ZAY,"I hadn't heard of this movie of his, though if it's similar to ""Winter Kill"", I will probably like it.  The thing that made me curious after seeing the plot description is that Andy's character is Abel Marsh, the same as James Garner's character in ""They Only Kill Their Masters"".  It seems unlikely it would be a coincidence and maybe it's supposed to be a sequel, though the towns are different (Eden's Landing in the Garner movie and Jasper Lake in this one).  Just thought I'd make these comments for the folks who have seen the movie.",1464307200,,539,4.536082474226804

6316283,1,B00J2G4ZAY,"The copy I received, though brand new, skipped around terribly in 2 of my DVD players, making the DVD unwatchable. So a replacement copy was sent to me.

6316288,5,B00J2G4ZAY,"Andy Griffith stars as the sheriff when he discovers that something strange is going on in his town.  This series of three movies will leave you begging for more, but these were the only three he made.  If you like the JESSIE STONE series, these are along the same line and will keep you focused from the beginning to the end of the story.  They are not shown on television anymore, but the one time they did show them I watched all three.  It took me awhile to find them on line, but thankfully I did.",1437523200,2,502,4.197916666666667
