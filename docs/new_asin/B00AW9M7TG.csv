5513073,5,B00AW9M7TG,Dwayne Johnson goes to the limit for his son. Great movie. He produced as well with his ex wife. Its always good to reflect what's happening around us and it lets the viewer into the world of anti narcotics practices civilians don't normally see. Great job.,1361491200,2,257,4.608695652173913

5513280,4,B00AW9M7TG,"Snitch,"" we are told at the beginning of the film,  is based on true events. John Matthews (Dwayne Johnson) owns a construction company. His college-bound son, Jason (Rafi Gavron), agrees to have a friend ship a large amount of Ecstasy to his house. In no time, the police and federal agents swoop in and arrest him. Because of mandatory sentencing laws, he is looking at a ten-year prison term.

The only deal federal prosecutor Joanne Keeghan (Susan Sarandon) is willing to make is to reduce Jasons sentence if he provides leads to bigger fish. Because Jason is not part of the drug culture, John offers to infiltrate a drug ring with connections to a Mexican drug cartel.

To do this, he looks at the job applications of his employees, several of whom have arrest records. He singles out Daniel James (Jon Bernthal), who has a record for drug dealing but is trying to get his life together and look after his family. John bribes a reluctant Daniel to help him get an introduction to his former connection, and offers the use of his large semis to transport concealed drugs.

Snitch is a comfortable fit for Johnson, formerly known as The Rock.  His John is happily remarried with a young child by his second wife. He is an intelligent guy who runs his own successful company and lives a good life. When Jason is incarcerated, John feels helpless and realizes only he can help prevent his son from spending the next decade in jail. Johnsons size makes him believable as a man who worked construction for many years, and the actor conveys self-assurance and smarts required of running a business, hiring and supervising men, and making a profit. Hes a guy who can get things done, and this confidence convinces him he can accomplish a task others would find far too risk-filled.

Ms. Sarandon is effective as an ambitious politician who makes the deal, knowing she has nothing to lose and a lot to gain. Her political career could receive an enormous boost if her office brings down a major drug trafficker.

Mr. Gavron has little to do except run from the cops when they close in and look desperate when we see him with bruises and a black eye hes received in prison. He elicits sympathy primarily because, though hes not technically innocent, he was foolish enough to do a favor for a pal that could ruin his life.

Director Ric Roman Waugh has the touchy task of being true to Johns character and not portraying him as a cliched action hero -- the kind Arnold Schwarzenegger made a career of in the 80s. Most of the action involves his ability as a driver. There are some pretty neat stunts involving his semi and the assorted cars filled with bad guys who try to kill him, and these are made to look possible, given the dimensions and heft of the truck John is driving. In addition, when a crucial delivery is arranged, its Johns brains -- not his muscles -- that win the day.

Rated PG-13 for drug content and mild violence, Snitch deals with  moral grey areas. Though characters act in unlawful or immoral ways, their motivations are well meaning. A kid does a favor for a friend by accepting a drug-filled package. A father who hasn't been there enough for his son becomes a drug transporter. An ex-con trying to go straight is lured by a sizable bribe to give him a chance to make a new life for his family. A federal prosecutor follows the letter of the law, her political ambitions trumping compassion. Though there is social commentary, Snitch never disappoints in the action department.

Overall picture quality on this 4K Ultra HD edition is excellent, with exteriors especially sharp. The establishing shots of the city and surrounding suburbs look great, with vibrant details and even a sense of layers with foreground, middle ground and  background clearly delineated. The close-ups reveal practically every skin pore, which can be distracting for eyes accustomed to traditional Blu-ray or DVD. When the 4K is compared to the Blu-ray version, the 4K easily wins out.

Bonus extras on the 2-disc 4K Ultra HD/Blu-ray Combo Pack include the featurette Privileged Information: The Making of Snitch; audio commentary with co-writer-director Ric Roman Waugh and editor Jonathan Chibnall; and deleted scenes. A digital HD copy is enclosed.",1496793600,,4249,4.772479564032698
5513281,4,B00AW9M7TG,"Very suspenseful and entertaining.

In the extras, Director Ric Roman Waugh said he wanted to make a movie that was a throwback to certain 70s' movies in that the character development made you empathize with the characters, like them, and root for them. He succeeds. In too many movies, there's not enough character development or the good guys are so unlikeable, you don't really care what happens to them.

In one commercial before the movie, there's a sarcastic tone towards how many people are imprisoned in the U.S. Another commercial and the movie itself take a dim view of mandatory minimum sentences (""three strikes""). My feelings are mixed about this. I think treatment over punishment should be the preferred method when dealing with low level offenders, but there needs to be punishment for larger offenders and at some point for people who won't change their ways. Why wouldn't you try hard to change your life after the first strike? Why not even harder after the second? I'm tired of seeing on the news elderly people, sometimes veterans, being beat up by a lowlife thug looking for money for more drugs.

In the movie, Susan Sarandon gives a good performance as the U.S. Attorney, an ambitious conservative running for higher office who believes in mandatory minimum sentences. So there is an attempt to have a balanced point of view about ""three strikes"" laws.",1495670400,,1377,4.926724137931035

But after seeing him in some other things i started to respect him and finally got around to this.  I think this is his best film.  It encompasses so many thematic elements of film.  The drama, the action, suspense, romance, family elements...everything.  Also the directing and cinematography is so great.  The shots, the angles...the scoring...this movie really has it all...and its based on a true story if that matters to anyone.  But really this piece may be called ""Snitch"" and thus you wouldnt expect it, but it is a cinamatographic work of art.  Watch it.",1450569600,,709,4.653225806451613

Its more like a drama/thriller type. Its just hard to see his brawny, and gritty side go to waste when you know he can mangle the bad guys in this movie any which way he can like Walking Tall and Faster. Not to mention Fast & Furious.
Its based on true events on his son being involved in a drug connection. Long story short, he chooses to go undercover to help his son get out of jail sooner by assisting DEA bring down a big drug cartel. Its compelling and kept my interest.",1444694400,,675,4.044776119402985

Really don't like the wife and ex-wife (too whiney) but especially don't like the son who creates the whole problem because he is just plain stupid (and lazy!) based on his first scenes.  Mother walks in carrying groceries that SHE went out and bought, not this lazy little so-and-so!  She asks why he hasn't answered the ringing phone, his reply, because I'm ""skyping"" with my friend.  The phone is a few feet away from the laptop he is screwing with!  The rest of the supporting cast is good, especially Barry Pepper, an undercover agent working with the prosecutor, Susan Sarandon.  Dwayne Johnson's character is outstanding as the father and so is the ex-con who helps him carry out the devised plan.

5514345,5,B00AW9M7TG,"This is an action film about a man, Dwayne Johnson, a truck driver, who tries to help his son, but doesnt realize how involved he will get. The film does not contain much of the usual heavy-handed rough stuff we expect from Dwayne.
 Dwaynes son gets caught and charged with possession of and distribution of a controlled dangerous substance. He faces at least ten years in jail. He is offered half that time if he would help the government catch another drug seller. His son insists that he knows no one. His father, Dwayne, offers to help the prosecutor  who is seeking a high-level government position - to find a distributor.
Dwayne uses one of his employees, an innocent ex-con, to help him without telling him what he is doing. As the two work together, Dwayne, who one undercover agent says is well out of his depth, gets himself, his family, the innocent ex-con, and this mans family into trouble. He doesnt realize that the prosecutor is interested in a promotion, the drug dealer he deals with is handling much dope, but a larger criminal Mexican drug dealer wants to take control of his activities.
 Then he realizes the pit he is in and says There is no way I will let either side decide what happens and he acts on his own.",1416960000,,1235,4.5291479820627805

5514348,5,B00AW9M7TG,"A lovely movie! No, really, I mean it! This Movie is shockingly smart and even touching. As a parent, you will be touched to see just how far the father (Dwayne Johnson) in the story is willing to go to keep his son free from the wrong and long arm of the law. His kid does something stupid for a friend involving drugs and the police want to incarcerate him for 10 years. He's just a teen so that would mean an end to a bright future. His mother resents his father because after their divorce he wasn't exactly there for him in that paternal way. So the dad strikes a deal with the district attorney (Susan Sarandon) to deliver her drug dealers that she wants in exchange for his son's freedom. It all is a bit much toward the end but the thing that is most touching is the relationship between parent and son. I would recommend it whole heatedly",1416182400,,847,4.267080745341615

5514640,3,B00AW9M7TG,"Dwayne Johnson shines in the based-on-true-events crime drama Snitch as John Matthews, a determined father trying to save his estranges son Jason (Rafi Gavron) arrested for drug dealing. In fact, Jason is not a drug dealer, but one of his friends snitched on Jason to reduce his sentence.

A successful construction company owner, John uses his connections and resources to catch a drug dealer, so that an ambitious local US Attorney Joanne Keeghan (Susan Sarandon) would reduce his own sons sentence.

Snitch opens with an interesting premise, with an almost documentary-like feel of photography, but starts losing its momentum in the mid-section, where the film follows the generic conventions of crime drama. Snitch has one so-so shoot-out scene and one great car chase sequence, but is not exactly an action movie.

5514648,4,B00AW9M7TG,"In my opinion, this is one of the best movies Dwayne Johnson has starred in. Most of his movies are bubble-gum or unrealistic action flicks. This one, however, was a gritty drama based on true events. The fact that Jon Bernthal (Shane from the best show on TV - The Walking Dead) also had a major part in this movie made it even better.

Snitch is the story of an eighteen-year old named Jason who allows a friend to send him drugs in the mail. Unbeknownst to Jason, his friend has set him up and made a deal with the DEA to frame him and reduce his own sentence. Jason's father, John Matthews (played by Dwayne) can't stand seeing his sheltered son locked away for what he calls a ""stupid and nave mistake."" So, he does what any father with a lick of commons sense would do -- he helps the DEA go after a member of the drug cartel in order to free his son.

Jon Bernal (who plays Daniel, an ex-con who works for John Matthews), is unwittingly involved in Matthews' plan when he introduces him to a powerful player in the drug trade. I won't give away the ending, but needless to say, they both get caught up in the seedy world of the cartel. I would definitely recommend this to someone who's looking for an action film that is not over-the-top with Hollywood effects.",1396569600,2,1269,4.3277310924369745

I can't believe that if some one is possession of drugs like the kid in the movie can get more time in prison than a rapist, murder ect. that is ridiculous. this movie had a lot of heart and you felt for the characters. it was so real. what would a father do for his child. I guess deal drugs to set his framed son free. I think that the mandatory should be cut down. 10 years is ridiculous a month or two yeah but 10 come on. anyway this movie was amazing. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do",1391212800,,632,3.9069767441860463
5514719,1,B00AW9M7TG,Arrived in good condition but didn't play in my region as my player only play region B in blu-rays. Hope this helps.,1391212800,,116,4.318181818181818
5514750,4,B00AW9M7TG,I like action packed movie even better with Dwayne Johnson. Enjoyed the movie nice. To have good movies to watch on cold nights,1390953600,,127,4.565217391304348
5514751,5,B00AW9M7TG,Dwayne Johnson is a good actor in any movie he plays in and pleasing to the eyes. I enjoyed this action film and would recommend for any action enthusiastic.,1390780800,,157,4.448275862068965
5514752,2,B00AW9M7TG,"Just not worth the time to watch it - Again just IMHO - Poor acting by others, not much of a plot",1390694400,,97,3.4545454545454546

5514754,5,B00AW9M7TG,I just love the Rock aka Dwayne Johnson! I make it my business to collect most all his movies and this one made it to my list of favorites. Rock is a father and business man in this movie and his son is in some trouble  with the law so as any good dad would do he will do anything to help his son. Alot of action and truck driving stunts with alot of shooting and chase scenes. Rock can really handle that big rig! Great movie you will love it if your a Rock fan like myself!,1390262400,,475,3.8469387755102042
5514755,5,B00AW9M7TG,This movie was EXCELLENT! It demonstrates the love of a father's determination to prove his son's innocence at all cost. I especially loved the fact that Director/Producer incorporates true facts about the criminal justice system as it stands. The fine line between Politics and our Justice System clearly reminds the audience that things are not at ALL as they appear. It begs the question as to whether the current sentencing rules should be revise to better fit the crimes. Highly recommend this movie to gain a better understanding how sentencing laws really work in the REAL WORLD.,1389916800,,586,5.051546391752577

5514759,5,B00AW9M7TG,"This was a whole new side of Dwayne Johnson,  great job!!!  The story is one all too familiar in the American ""war on drugs"" & it epitomizes everything wrong with the way it's fought, tried, & treated.  Riveting movie !!!!",1389052800,,222,4.5
5514810,3,B00AW9M7TG,"my stupid machine is not working -- BUT I know I will love the movie, once I get a new machine -- basically, The Rock -- need I say more?? - he's the best!",1388966400,,155,3.588235294117647

5514812,4,B00AW9M7TG,The Rock pulls it off again in this action flick. It's predictable but still pretty good. Don't think the son was a good pick to play that roll.,1388793600,,144,4.178571428571429
5514813,5,B00AW9M7TG,Amazing. I am a big fan of his. I strongly feel that he and The Rock gave brilliant and believable performances. This movie deserves a lot more credit and praise than it has gotten. a truly realistic story and plot and no half naked women scenes and hardly any cursing. maybe none I cant remember. But that's what so cool about it. It didn't need any of those things to make it exciting.,1388707200,,387,4.315068493150685
5514814,3,B00AW9M7TG,"Dwayne is a great actor, but I really didn't enjoy this movie because the part he played is not really for him, look at his size, more action is needed.",1388448000,,152,4.1
5514815,4,B00AW9M7TG,"I thought the quality of everything in this movie was good (acting, visuals, action, etc), but near the end, the plot was not only predictable, it was clearly political and bordered on being conspiracy minded.",1388448000,,209,5.0
5514816,4,B00AW9M7TG,the rock is awesome in this movie.  loved it! def worth adding to your movie collection in my honest opinion,1388448000,,108,4.4

5514819,3,B00AW9M7TG,"While this movie isn't one of his best, it is still a nice vehicle. Good pace and action, story a bit irritating as far as how the justice system sometimes works. We found it very entertaining and good maybe a bit above average. Nice twists. Draws attention to mandatory sentencing without being preachy. Thoughtful movie.",1388188800,,322,4.872727272727273
5514840,5,B00AW9M7TG,"Snitch isn't a generic action film as some might have expected. Instead, it is a entertaining drama and thriller about a father doing whatever everything in his power to save his son.",1388102400,,183,4.75
5514841,3,B00AW9M7TG,I liked the movie but purchased for my collection and could have been a rental. Slow in parts of the movie but an overall fair-good movie.,1387843200,,138,4.346153846153846

5514843,4,B00AW9M7TG,The Rock does a good job but the story line seems to be lacking.  Was looking for more action but never came.  I guess I was looking for that fast action movie but this is not that.  despite this it was still a good heart warming movie.,1387411200,,236,3.978723404255319
5514844,3,B00AW9M7TG,"I bought this movie because of the price and I thought maybe the Rock has done a great movie.  I don't know if this movie ever made it to the Big Screen, but I think DVD sales was the best way to market this one.",1387324800,,212,3.7111111111111112

5514848,4,B00AW9M7TG,"I like watching The Rock in action, he makes a good action star he has the bulk, moves well and is able to deliver the lines. While this film is billed as an action film it does have more development than his usual films and he carries it off well.

It's apparently inspired by true events, although I have no idea how closely it relates to those vents, but the film tells the story of a man who's son gets arrested for a open and shut drugs trafficking case. In an effort to free his son he makes a deal with the DA to exchange hi sentence for bigger fish. Naturally things get out of hand and that's where the action element of the film comes in.

It's more of a thriller than all out action and unusually you don't get to see any hand to hand action that he's so good at. He plays the businessman in over his head well, but the film isn't carried by him alone, the rest of the cast are all excellent in portraying the range of characters on both sides of the drugs business.

The downside is that while it's a solid film, it's not particularly original and there's no real surprises along the way. That's enough to prevent this from being an excellent film, but it is a decent one.",1386892800,,1184,4.184210526315789
5514849,5,B00AW9M7TG,"I don't often give a review of a movie, and not sure how to with out giving away a plot. So I figured I will give a review about other important things, such as the writing and the editing and the cinematography. They are all done very very well. A complete all around well made movie. The plot felt real, not extra dialogue that likely would not feel like it would be normal. The editing between scenes was very very well done. I wish I was their on-set stills photographer, cause it would have been really neat to be a part of this production. And how can I not talk about the actors. Dwayne Johnson is a brilliant actor, especially in this film. He maintained a very defined character through out the entire movie. The supporting actor, Jon Bernthal, did an excellent job with his character. The entire cast really put on a great movie, it's one of the best movies I have seen in years...",1386806400,,891,4.373493975903615

5514905,4,B00AW9M7TG,"Snitch is great movie that was based on a PBS Frontline story about the culture of snitching within the federal penal system.  The movie shows Dwayne Johnson as a concerned father and not the tough guy we all come to expect.  The movie shows Dwayne Johnson's acting chops.  We movie is well done and had me interested the whole way through.  The supporting cast was also exceptional to include Susan Sarandon, Benjamin Bratt, Barry Pepper, and  Jon Bernthal.  Jon Bernthal who you will know from the Walking Dead.  I enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it.",1385769600,,570,4.814432989690721

The cause of all the chaos, the best friend, who was only in the introduction of the movie and then vanished.",1383868800,,344,4.149253731343284
5514944,3,B00AW9M7TG,First I have to say I am not very picky when it comes to movies. I don't watch horror flicks or many R movies unless they are a comedy. I bought this thinking it was an action movie and because I like Dwayne Johnson. even as the tooth fairy :-D. I purchased basically because of Dwayne. Have to admit it was a very good movie but kind of slow. Way more action in the last Die Hard movie. So if your looking for a fast paced action movie you might want to rent this one.,1383609600,,469,3.9473684210526314
5514945,5,B00AW9M7TG,this movie came super fast and on time.  great way to buy dvd's pretty much brand new and not a problem watching it.  will order more.,1383523200,,134,4.115384615384615
5514946,3,B00AW9M7TG,Thought the acting was good by Dwayne Johnson but a little far fetched that everything he did in the movie could be pulled off against a real life Mexican cartel and pretty much by himself.  The action scenes were good. The DA's whole attitude was pretty cold also and hard to believe that she could put a civilian at risk to help her solve crimes against the cartel,1383523200,,366,4.382352941176471

This film is based on a true story about a man who did what he had to do to help his son who ended up in prison. Recommended for fans of Dwayne Johnson. A little action mixed with a lot of heart results in a adequate action drama. What would you do for your family?,1382572800,,393,3.925

5515024,4,B00AW9M7TG,"Dwayne Johnson is growing on me. I remember decades ago when Howard Stern was mocking this WWF wrestler's attempt in becoming an actor. Like Dwayne wasn't already acting as a wrestler. Probably Arnold Schwarzenegger met with the same ridicule when transitioning his career from muscle building to acting. Anyway, Dwayne The Rock Johnson reminds me of Schwarzenegger. They both come off as lovable big hulking fellows out to rectify an injustice. These are simple formulaic movies; although Dwayne uses less guns and explosives, and has a better command of the English language. Then again Arnold proved language was not a barrier to perform successfully in vacuous action films. All that is required is tons of personality, which Dwayne possesses.",1382313600,,747,5.285714285714286

I would not be willing to stand, waiting in line to purchase a ticket at peak time; but I would see at budget time AND worth buying.
While in Walmart looking for the movie which was sold out, a tween recommended this movie. That means something when I am looking for a movie to watch with 12 yr olds. Buy it; and if you can get for less $$ than Amazon- it is a DEAL.",1380672000,,569,4.089285714285714

Even the FBI agents were pathetic, but then, I've never liked these Fan Belt Inspectors anyway.  Overall, it was an OK movie, but not something I'd pay to watch again.  Eddie was just plain stupid, but totally predicatable as the sawed-off little mouthy punk.  I was really hoping someone would seriously kick his ass, but it was Chris that got the ass-whuppin'.

What I got was Johnson in a movie based on a true story, playing a father trying to get his son out of prison by doing undercover work for the DEA against a drug cartel.

Johnson was excellent in his role as a trucking company owner. Also excellent was Jon Bernthal as an ex-con employee that gets roped into helping Johnson.

This is a drama movie with some killer action sequences in it and it kept me on the edge of my seat through the whole movie.

It makes you ask yourself the question ""Just how far would I go to help my child?""",1378252800,,726,4.201438848920863

5515421,3,B00AW9M7TG,"According to the preamble, this film is based on actual events.  Well, maybe, but I doubt those events included a well-staged car chase including a giant Kenworth semi, shotguns and blazing automatic weapons.  The basis of the film is an honest political point of how nave, young drug offenders can get years in the federal slammer.

In this case, we're talking about 18 year old Jason (Rafi Gavron) the estranged son of John (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) and his ex, Sylvie (Melina Kanakaredes).  John is remarried with a young daughter and is a successful owner of a construction company.  Jason is arrested for accepting a package containing a large quantity of Ecstasy to help out a friend.  Because of the quantity he faces a mandatory sentence of 35 years unless he can lead prosecutors and the DEA to bigger fish.  The problem is that he doesn't know anyone other than the friend who already ratted him out.

So daddy steps in and convinces the prosecutor and wannabe politician Joanne Keeghan (Susan Sarandon) that he will infiltrate the local kingpin dealer's gang and get the deal for his kid.  She agrees but the imminent arrest is stopped when the head of the Mexican cartel (Benjamin Bratt) can be captured in the near future.

While this is a fairly formulaic film of this type, we do get a different side of Johnson.  Gone are the usual head beating action scenes.  In fact in an early attempt to score some drugs in the hood, he gets his own butt beat pretty bad.  In another film, he would have had them for lunch.  Barry Pepper turns in a nice below-the-radar performance as the undercover DEA leader and Jon Bernthal proves there is life after TV's ""The Walking Dead,"" as a helpful ex-con and employee of John's.

The Lionsgate/Summit Blu ray comes in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It is shot digitally and everything looks very good.  Excellent contrast even with night scenes.  With only a couple exceptions the film looks sharp and well defined.  The audio is stellar with a DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 lossless mix.  There is one scene when John and Daniel (Bernthal) go get their first shipment from the cartel in El Paso.  When a rival gang attempts a hijacking a massive shoot out occurs as John maneuvers his 18-wheeler around and through whatever is in his path.  Bullets are flying everywhere and like John and Daniel, you feel like your in the middle.  Nice use of the subs and with the excellent musical score.  Extras include a commentary track with director Ric Roman Waugh and editor Jonathan Chibnall, a 50 minute ""making of"" doc, some deleted scenes and a trailer.  Subtitles come in English (some Spanish spoken), English SDH and Spanish.",1377302400,,2674,4.735930735930736
5515422,3,B00AW9M7TG,The movie is trying to deliver a moral message and made the government out as Big Brother with a Nazi twist (turn children / young adults against relations to save their own butts).

5515545,4,B00AW9M7TG,This was a good movie with adventure and emotion.  Events were a little predictable but Dwayne Johnson is easy on the eyes and scenes were action packed with the drug cartel and police double crosses.,1376352000,,200,4.714285714285714
5515586,4,B00AW9M7TG,"""Snitch"" is that rare action movie that dares to dabble in moral complexities. Dwayne Johnson plays the owner of a construction company whose semi-estranged, college-bound, 18-year-old son Jason (Rafi Gavron) is arrested for the possession and possible selling of drugs.  The catch is that the boy's sentence could be reduced if he agrees to set up someone else in a sting. When Jason refuses to be turned into a ""snitch"" just to protect his own hide, his dad decides to take matters into his own hands by recruiting one of his employees (the excellent Jon Berthnal from ""The Walking Dead""), who's on probation for narcotics trafficking and trying to turn his life around, to be an unwitting pawn in a scheme to finger a dangerous local drug dealer (Michael Kenneth Williams) .

An interesting story is enhanced by taut direction (by Ric Roman Waugh), excellent cinematography and editing, and a highly effective musical score by Antonio Pinto. Beyond the aforementioned actors, there is excellent work by Susan Sarandon as a federal prosecutor who's over-zealousness and political calculation often lead her to act recklessly with little regard for others` safety, and Benjamin Bratt as a cartel kingpin.

Inspired by ""true events,"" the Waugh/Justin Haythe screenplay is more concerned with character and conflict than with car chases and conventional action sequences, as a whole host of good or at least potentially good people are forced to compromise their integrity in order to game the system and achieve their goals. For John Matthews (Johnson), the goal is obviously to save his son from a hard stint in prison, while for Daniel James (Berthnal), the goal is a bit less clear-cut, which, in many ways, makes him an even more intriguing character than John.

To get a sense of just how good a movie ""Snitch"" is, compare it to another recent action film that deals with a similar father-and-son theme, the foolish ""A Good Day to Die Hard,"" with Bruce Willis all but leveling Moscow in an attempt to rescue his imprisoned boy.  John, on the other hand, remains an everyman character rather than a superhero - and that makes all the difference in the world.

By keeping it small-scale and restrained, ""Snitch"" succeeds where so many other action movies have failed.",1376265600,,2270,4.992063492063492

5515616,4,B00AW9M7TG,"SNITCH is compelling from start to finish. Fine acting--by Johnson and crew, but most especially by Michael Williams as dope salesman Malik, as well as Susan Sarandon and Barry Pepper as the self-serving Feds--with an excellent script is what really makes this film such a success. It's tense throughout, with not a moment wasted. While SNITCH is clean, with no nudity or serious gore (hence the PG13 rating), it's still realistic and far from corny. There are some hard-sells --chase scenes on the busy freeway without, miraculously, any innocent fellow travelers getting hit--along with some too-neat tie-ups. Still, SNITCH remains a thriller that possesses some depth with serious layers and isn't all just cheap violence.",1375920000,,725,5.3130434782608695
5515617,5,B00AW9M7TG,This movie has loads of action and stunts.  Dwayne Johnson has really come into his own as an actor. Well worht the time to watch.,1375920000,,130,4.2
5515618,4,B00AW9M7TG,"I appreciate the general thought of ""do whatever it takes to protect family"", so when they make movies with such a plot, I am willing to give it a shot.  Snitch is along that lines.  Kid gets busted on drug charges, dad does what he needs to do to get kid out of prison.

They intentionally kept the film ""low key"".  By that I mean very little gun play and light stunts.  The car chase towards the end of the film was their big stun tbudget moment.  It was respectable, but you can feel them holding back explosions and excessive over-the-topness to keep the low-key feel going.  And, I can respect that.  Not every film with ""the Rock"" needs to be over-the-top, especially one with a ""hidden"" message.

The message thing was sort of heavy handed in its delivery.  You see, this entire film is basically a public service advertisement to draw peoples attention to the draconic and flat out unfair laws regarding certain aspects of drug crimes.  It is these laws that the kid got wrapped up in and got 20+ years in hardcore prison.  They take every opportunity to bring it back to the forefront and make you notice it again.  While I appreciate films with a message, they overplayed their hand.  They shoved it at you at every chance and it takes you out of the story.  (For those curious, they do a decent job going in-depth during the special features on the laws in question.)

5515896,4,B00AW9M7TG,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

From an outsider's point of view it's very easy to label Snitch as just your average run-of-the-mill crime thriller. There's car chases, firefights, and some pretty intense moments, but Snitch is more than that. It's a tale that outlines the harsh reality of America's judicial system. How first time, non-violent drug offenders are still looked at as major criminals and are denied bail. It's an interesting take on this concept and one I wasn't fully expecting. However, this unpredictability is what really drew me in as the movie progressed and I found myself itching to see what would happen next.

You follow the story of John Matthews (Dwayne Johnson), the owner of a construction company who recently found out that his son Jason (Rafi Gavron) is being charged with distribution of narcotics. Although his relationship with his son is a rocky one, he knows his son well enough and doesn't doubt his innocence. Unfortunately, U.S. Attorney Joanne Keeghan (Susan Sarandon) informs him that there's nothing he or she can do to decrease his son's sentence. As a final act of desperation, John tries to personally go under cover which doesn't end well. This forces Joanna to agree to shorten Jason's sentence if John takes down a high-ranking drug dealer known as Malik (Michael K. Williams).

While the story being told is an intriguing one, Snitch suffers from some bad pacing and an anticlimactic ending. You see, John wouldn't have been able to meet Malik if it was't for an employee, and ex-con, by the name of Daniel James (Jon Bernthal). While I did love Daniel as a character and I thought his story was interesting, the inclusion of his personal life always seemed to bring the movie to a screeching halt. The transition between John and Daniel was never as smooth as it should have been and while Daniel's story may have added some relatability for some viewers, it was a little generic and unnecessary. A simple introduction and a brief overview of his history would have sufficed.

As far as the ending goes, I just found it to be unsatisfying. Part of this is due to the terrible pacing in the film's final 15-20 minutes, but how they arrived at the scenario didn't help either. The only word I can use to describe it is rushed. It's almost as if they realized that they were closing in on that two hour mark and decided they needed to wrap it up as quick as possible. As I already mentioned, the film's pacing up to this point was never perfect, but I truly believe that if they had cut out some of Daniel's side story they could have allowed themselves some breathing room for the ending. Part of me feels like they tried to cram too much stuff into one little package and it wound up hurting the final product.

Now this is a very rare occurrence, but I actually wasn't too fond of the casting in Snitch. With the exception of Johnson, Bernthal, Sarandon, and Williams, I found that majority of the cast was very... average. Barry Pepper, who plays Agent Cooper, was alright, but his performance wasn't terribly memorable. Then you had Benjamin Bratt, Melina Kanakaredes, and Nadine Velazquez who were all just there. They didn't leave a lasting impression and their presence never felt important. Rafi Gavron wasn't too bad, but he didn't get enough screen time to make much of a difference. Out of the entire cast Johnson and Bernthal stood out the most and they were great in the scenes that they were in together.

Finally, the score, composed by Antonio Pinto, was very well done. While most crime thrillers have these over-the-top compositions that are loud and, occasionally, obnoxious, Pinto's compositions provided a somber eeriness which seemed to fit perfectly with the tone of the film. There were a few rough spots where a piece felt slightly unfitting for its accompanied scene, but nothing that ruined the experience or detracted from the score's beauty. I was honestly really surprised at how much I enjoyed it and I look forward to listening to it as a standalone score.

Overall Score: 7.25/10 - Snitch is one of those crime thrillers that tries to go beyond the accepted norm of the genre. Unfortunately, it tries to take on too much at once which ultimately leaves the ending feeling both rushed and unsatisfying. Still, it's an enjoyable film from start to finish and the social commentary was a nice touch. I would recommend giving it a shot if you had your eye on it when it was in theaters.",1374451200,,4484,4.763191763191763

When the son does a stupid thing and gets in trouble with the law he steps in and does whatever it takes to help get his son out of jail as soon as possible.  What he goes through is scary and dangerous but he is committed.  In the end it all works out and his son is released.

USA
Director: Ric Roman Waugh
Writers: Justin Haythe, Ric Roman Waugh
Stars: Dwayne Johnson, Jon Bernthal, Susan Sarandon

Based on a true story, this is not your typical Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson action movie.  It is good, but it is good in a true life sort of way and not so much as an action thriller.  There is action, but it comes later in the movie.  The key stressed idea is the laws against first time offenders are unfair.  A young man is thrown in prison after he is set up and framed for a drug deal by his friend and the police.  Since he doesn't know anyone to snitch on to get off he is destined to serve out a ten year sentence.  His friend got off by trapping him in a deal he didn't even want to do, for distribution even when he never used the drug or sold it to others.  Johnson plays his dad as a large business contractor with Semi trucks.  He gets the DA to allow him to ""Snitch"" on the drug cartel by getting into their transporting operation.  Sad to think this is where our legal system has gone to try and look good to the public.  If they are hurting for busts this bad it is time we reform the laws and have them focus on other crimes.  Although I am glad I rented it, I don't feel this has any rewatchability so I won't buy it.

5516212,3,B00AW9M7TG,"Snitch is a movie about a father (Johnson) who goes undercover for the DEA in order to free his son who was imprisoned after being set up in drug deal.

The movie is a decent action flick for what it is and Johnson for once plays a bit more of a subdued role than his normal action roles which I think is a good thing. The problem with this movie is the plot holes that give premise to the story itself, including the numerous actions taken by both the father and the ex-con he partners up with that realistically would not have happened. Both the actions taken by the U.S. Attorney and DEA seem to be have been written without any consultation on what goes on in reality as both their actions would not have gone about in the way that it did in the movie. One of the glaring things they got wrong was US Attorney's are appointed and not elected like they portrayed in the movie and judges have discretion to go below mandatory minimums. I understand the message concerning election year politics playing a role in drug enforcement, but really..get the basic facts accurate. They open the movie saying based on true events of a documentary done a few years ago, yea sure right. This may be loosely based on something that happened but the actions that occurred in this movie, not hardly. I really wish movies would stop using the based on a true story line and then go so far from the true story it becomes ridiculous.

If you ignore the plot holes though, then this is an average action flick to rent and watch as for purely an action flick, I enjoyed watching it.",1373068800,,1565,4.393103448275862

Every time there was a road block, you could see it on his face and then see him come to a solution that got him to an even bigger problem that kept escalating until the big finale. Very well paced. I was frustrated along with Dwayne's character. He got really good actors that I haven't seen in awhile too which was good cause you could not tell if the character was a bad or good guy that way. I hope he continues making action films with good story-lines.",1372896000,,605,4.315789473684211

5516304,4,B00AW9M7TG,"I want to first start off by saying two things. I greatly appreciate all the feedback and helpful votes that I have received since doing my reviews on Amazon.com. It is the main reason I continue doing reviews. Last, I want to start a new rating system. As many of you know, my rating system is usually based on 1-5 stars. I have come to a conclusion that on some movies, I will continue to use this rating set up; while on movies such as this one, I will begin using a rating system on a scale of 1-10. So lets talk about the movie Snitch.

Snitch stars Dwayne Johnson as John Matthews. I think it is safe to say that Dwayne Johnson can hold his own as an action movie star (as evidenced with the 2010 film Faster).  Now I think personally, the day pigs fly is when Dwayne Johnson will be nominated for a serious movie award like a Golden Globe. But I gotta say, he did some REALLY good acting in this movie; i mean SERIOUSLY good acting in this movie. As a matter of fact, as a whole, the acting by everyone in this movie was good. Benjamin Bratt stars as the primary bad guy Juan Pintera. We also have Barry Pepper as Agent Cooper, Michael Kenneth Williams as Malik (good actor), Jon Bernthal as Daniel, and Rafi Gavron as Jason. The main and supporting cast were really great in film.

Now be mindful, Snitch is a MOVIE that is based on real events, but as a movie, it does pose a serious question: If Jason was your son, how far would you go, what would you do? This story really digs deep into the concept of putting his own life at risk to save his son, and for the movie as a whole, it works.

I have once again been astonished at the movies I have come to enjoy recently as of late. Snitch is a movie I really have a great deal of respect for. Is it the best movie I will ever see? Probably not. However on a scale of 1-10, Snitch gets a score of

8.5/10",1372809600,,1863,4.107142857142857

Here he played a drama driven action character well, and demonstrated that there is more to his acting skills than just the parts he has been given in the past.

Although there is some action, this is more a story of what lengths a man will go to in order to save his son from an unjust prison sentence due to the Draconian mandatory sentencing laws passed by Congress.  The movie is supposedly based on true events, although I'm sure some of the action was pumped up to make the movie more Hollywood.  There is plenty of excitement to be had from the story itself though, with no need for gun battles and high speed car crashes.  When Dwayne Johnson's character is sitting across the table from a drug dealer or when he's led to an out of the way meeting with a drug lord, the tension is palpable.  It's good to see Dwayne Johnson expanding his acting abilities.  You forget about the muscles and just see a man desperate to save his son.",1372377600,,829,4.421052631578948

5516460,4,B00AW9M7TG,"Other reviewers have thoroughly explained the entire plot, so I will simply focus on what makes this movie so much better than most people will expect. First, any movie starring ""The Rock"" is generally expected to fall into the old cliche of ""big, strong, former Special Forces father kicks and blasts the hell out of the mean old drug cartel to rescue his child"".....but that expectation is completely incorrect in this case. Instead, Dwayne Johnson (his real name being far more appropriate in this context), accurately and realistically portrays an ""average"" father, with no special physical attributes, who desperately tries to gain leniency for his way-over-sentenced son. He (very convincingly) displays fear and uncertainty, makes all sorts of mistakes, and in general behaves exactly like you or I would if we found ourselves stuck in an awful situation. At no time does he reveal even a momentary glimpse of his traditional ""superhero"" persona, and for that reason, this movie rises way beyond cliche into the realm of highly effective, realistic action drama.

Second, the entire cast is superb, ranging from Michael K. Williams (Omar in The Wire) to John Bernthal, Barry Pepper, Benjamin Bratt, and Susan Sarandon (as the self-promoting federal prosecutor). These fine actors were given roles befitting their exceptional acting skills, and they each made the most of it. The result is a very strong, convincing production that never loses your attention or your respect.

Third, there are some unconventional ""twists"" (see if you agree after you have watched the movie): John Bernthal's part is so complex and compelling that he actually rises to ""co-hero"" status with Dwayne Johnson, which you would never see in a traditional ""action"" flick, where all supporting actors simply serve to glorify the star. Susan Sarandon's character is, in my opinion, a villain equal to the drug cartel itself, since she selfishly puts an innocent man in a lethal situation simply to further her career. The drug cartel functions ruthlessly to further their own interests, as does she. That she is running for Congress, and will, no doubt win, sheds some unflattering light on what (some) people will do to succeed in politics.

Bottom Line: This movie is definitely worth your time and money, and you can tell from the overall excellent reviews that I am not alone in this sentiment. ""Snitch"" was infinitely better than I expected, and I am quite sure that you will be very pleasantly surprised by just how good it is.",1372204800,,2514,5.0823244552058116

The movie definitely delivered an intriguing story, a fair share of twists, and will keep you interested, and rooting for The Rock's Character until the end. AS others have mentioned that the Rock flexing his muscles in this film. However, I can appreciate watching The Rock step out of his action routine, and leaning more toward his skills as an actor to carry the film (The Rock has matured nicely as an actor since his debut, Scorpion King).

5516684,4,B00AW9M7TG,"What would you do for someone close to you? Point in question, what would you do to save your child? I doubt that anyone would say less than anything but when push comes to shove would you? That's the question faced by John Matthews (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) in SNITCH.

John's son Jason has lived with his mother ever since the divorce of his parents. When a friend insists on shipping him a box full of Ecstasy to hold for him the DEA breaks down the door and arrests him for possession with intent to sell. Mandatory drug laws (yes this is based not only on a true story but real laws now in effect) require that unless he co-operates by implicating someone else in the drug trade he could face up to 10 years in jail. Unfortunately the only person Jason knew was his friend who it turns out was caught before he could ship the drugs and set Jason up using this trade deal.

When John goes to DA Joanne Keeghan (Susan Sarandon) and asks for mercy she explains that there is nothing she can do, the laws are set in stone. Unless Jason helps catch someone else he will serve the full term. When John offers to take his place, to find a way to help them catch dealers she turns him away. Refusing to let his son set in prison for a good portion of his life, John sets out to find a dealer on his own. The result is his being beaten and nearly shot.

Keeghan decides to take John up on his offer but only if he can get her a major player. John owns a construction company and looking through the applications of his employees he finds that Daniel James (Jon Bernthal) did time for distribution. He asks him to do nothing more than introduce him to a major dealer and is turned down. The need for money supercedes Daniel's decision to become straight and he sets John up with Malik.

An initial run for drugs gets the attention of the cartel supplying Malik and they decide to use John themselves. When the DEA agent in charge (Barry Pepper) decides to bypass arresting Malik on the chance he can catch the cartel's main man in the states, John is left between the two warring factions of the DEA and the cartel with little thought to his safety or the release of his son. It is now up to John to find a solution that will handle all players involved in this situation and get him what he needs to have his son free.

Dwayne Johnson has come a long way from his early films that relied solely on his action and physical skills. Slowly he's been developing acting chops that might never qualify him for an Oscar nomination but will elevate him from little more than a muscle bound action star. In truth this film is more about acting than action with almost zero fisticuffs for Johnson with the action not beginning until the last half hour of the film. It doesn't disappoint though as the story itself is engrossing and quite frightening to consider if you have children.

The rest of the cast complements Johnson in the lead with Sarandon's portrayal of a DA seeking political gain at all costs making her someone to root for and detest at the same time. The best surprise of all is Bernthal who proves that the work he did on THE WALKING DEAD wasn't all he is capable of doing. As another father under different circumstances but caring for his son as well, his character is more sympathetic than the good guys.

The craftsmanship behind the camera is as qualified as that seen in front. The photography is well managed with cameras catching all the action and rarely (if ever) resorting to bouncing hand held shots or close ups during the few action scenes. Director Ric Roman Waugh, who directed the well made but little seen film FELON, does a great job here and shows promise.

All in all this was a good movie that deserves more attention than it received in theaters. That could have been because it was marketed as an action packed slam bang film when in truth it's a solid drama. Go in expecting what it really is and give it a try and you will be pleasantly surprised.",1371600000,,3979,4.382113821138211

About 95% of the movie is filmed with hand held cameras. So, when you get your popcorn, Milk Duds and soda pop, get some sea-sickness pills too. I know movie-makers claim that using the hand held is supposed to give the movie a more ""realistic"" feel. I agree, if your reality is that you live on a ship in choppy seas.

If the dark scenes didn't give you a massive headache, the camera work will.

The acting and story progression is very much second rate. Little suspense, very little drama, and almost no action until the very end. If you are choosing between watching this and some other new release, watch the other one. Dwayne Johnson fans will be somewhat disappointed with the lackluster entertainment that this movie delivers.

IMBD.COM gives it a 6.6....that is kind of high on MY scale. I am giving it a 4.0 on the TEN POINT Scale. And frankly, the three stars I gave it on here is only because it had the final action scene on the highway, which was, shall we say, explosive.

Part of the reason this is a poor movie may be that it is a joint USA/UAE effort. (USA | United Arab Emirates). The UAE is a strong democratic Arab state, and they are GREAT people! But they have not yet fully arisen to the level of Hollywood when it comes to major motion pictures.

This movie is unexpected good because of the characters' depth. It raises the question ""Will you BETRAY your friends to save your own skin?"" The son and the father handled this situation differently. They made me feel unsettled because people could betray their friends so easily.

There are some touching scenes too. For instance, the scene where the Rock visited his son in jail touched me. The teenager, in tears, admitted his wrong doing to his dad.

The big trouble is the Rock is not suitable for drama role. Case in point, in the jail scene mentioned above, the Rock was showing his love for his son but he looked puzzled not emotional! I think he's good for action role not drama.

5516761,3,B00AW9M7TG,"If there's one good thing to say about Snitch, it's that it's much better than whoever is responsible for its advertising campaign seems to want me to believe.  The poster features The Rock staring coldly past the camera, a flaming semi-truck careening through traffic behind him.  ""INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS"" reads the tagline, in a font all but ripped from the cover of Call of Duty: Black Ops.  Needless to say, expectations were not high.

 But despite the cynical, lowest common denominator advertising, Snitch turns out to be a surprisingly competent - if at times uneven - crime thriller.  Perhaps more surprisingly is that despite  Dwayne Johnson's B-list acting resume, he puts in solid performance, effectively tying the frequently unfocused film together.  His character, John Matthews, unexpectedly finds his son charged with distribution of narcotics, and threatened with prison under mandatory minimum laws.  The law, it seems, has no room for mercy where drugs are concerned, and Matthew's son faces no fewer than ten years in prison.  His only alternative is to help rat out other drug dealers, and being a victim of this himself, he refuses.

 Matthew's struggle to keep his son from being incarcerated eventually lands him in the office of opportunistic DA Joanne Keeghan, played by Susan Sarandon.  He offers to help aid a bust in exchange for the release of his son, and the film begins in earnest.  In order to get his upper-class, white-collar self into the criminal underworld, Matthews enlists the assistance of Daniel James, an employee at Matthews' construction company twice convicted of distribution of narcotics.  Despite James' desire to live within the law for the sake of his family, he reluctantly agrees at Matthews' promise of a heavy sum of money.  Jon Bernthal gives a great performance as James here, capturing the quiet desperation of a man only one step removed from destroying his life, but struggling to keep his family afloat.

 Were Snitch a less ambitious film, this might have worked.  But the movie has an agenda, and the more it tries to stick to it, the more muddled its plot, and indeed, its morals become.  The explicit goal of the film, much like the 1999 episode of CBS's Frontline it was based on, is to provide something of an expose into the failures of the war on drugs.  While this is a premise I can get behind, one anecdotal account is far from enough to prove the system is broken.  Furthermore, while Snitch displays the government as opportunistic, with a blatant disregard for the lives of the young children it is destroying in the ongoing drug war, our hero Matthews is no better.  His exploitation of James' less than clean past is not only hypocritical, but an insulting violation of employee privacy from the man we are supposed to be rooting for.

 Beyond that, the film never clearly establishes the tone it wants to have.  Early on, it is the dramatization of true events that it claims to be, but as its running time progresses, it devolves into an unbelievable action film.  The final 20 minutes are comically removed from reality, as Matthews takes matters into his own hands in an attempt to escape the mess he is in, culminating in an over-the-top chase sequence.  Fun?  Yes.  Believable?  Hardly.

 While Johnson's performance is more or less effective, the film struggles to find Matthews an identity, instead relying on the age old Hollywood trope of ""Dad works too much"".  I honestly don't know at this point if Hollywood actually knows of any other reason that a father and son can be estranged besides the fact that Pops spends too much time at the office. This weighs the film down with emotional baggage it doesn't need, when the situation Matthews' son is in ought to be enough motive for Matthews on its own.

 Snitch proves to be an effective vehicle for The Rock to stretch his acting skills, but it's far to schizophrenic to be a strong film.  Were it a straight documentary, or a straight action film, it may have turned out to be something more impressive, but as it currently stands, the whole is less than the sum of its parts.  Despite some of its more off-putting elements, though, I still found it enjoyable.

He cuts an unorthodox deal the federal prosecutor (Susan Sarandon) that would give Jason a get of of jail free card, if he delivered them a felony conviction. Dad employs the help of an ex-con (Jon Bernthal)in his construction firm to make the contact. As Dwayne gets deeper and further up the food chain, the federal prosecutor wants more.

Clearly Dwayne is in way over his head. We really don't feel the peril as much as we should because it is Dwayne Johnson who we have seen out run, out gun, and beat up armies of evil men.

The acting was decent, even from the support cast. The plot and dialouge needed some help. The film attempts to show that mandatory sentencing laws are unfair and judges should have more leeway in sentencing, but it doesn't inundate you with the theme so as to interfere with the film.

A good semi-family film for Rock fans. One you might want your teen to see. This is another story based on true events. This one is more believable as it doesn't include aliens, ghosts or zombies. The explode on contact cars are still hard to swallow.

5516825,3,B00AW9M7TG,"Drugs again. It seems that every action flick these days pivots around drugs: drug cartels, drug deals, drug deals gone bad, or drug addictions. To me, this is terra incognita, an unknown land, although I am certainly aware of the violence and devastation drugs have caused!

This time we have a father who volunteers to go undercover for the DEA as he desperately tries to rescue his son from prison where he landed after he was set up in a drug deal. (When Dwayne Johnson, formerly ""The Rock,"" does a film, it usually promotes family values. One reviewer made the astute observation that while Johnson still isn't an actor, he IS a movie star.)

We see:
  * Dwayne Johnson (""Fast Five"") is the father, completely out of his depth dealing with bad guys (he owns a construction company). The first thing that happens, he gets his behind whupped!
  * Rafi Gavron (""Celeste & Jesse Forever"") is the son trying to be a loyal friend despite his chum's betrayal...but prison's no picnic!
  * Jon Bernthal (""Rampart"") is an employee who has a prison record but is determined to go straight.
  * Melina Kanakaredes (lots of TV) is the distraught mother, frantic to get her son out of jail.
  * Barry Pepper (""Broken City"") is a DEA agent, smart, experienced ...and worried about an innocent schmuck being used by special interest groups.
  * Susan Sarandon (""Cloud Atlas"") is a District Attorney running for higher office. THAT is HER sole focus!
  * Michael Kenneth Williams (Omar in ""The Wire"") is once again, a thug, a ringleader, a killer and an all-around bad guy.

In a movie like this, directed by Ric Roman Waugh (""Felon"") we can expect spectacular vehicular mayhem and brutal gunfights, but surprisingly clean language and unrealistically sparkling white teeth. When is Hollywood going to learn? It makes me smile to watch the rating wars: no cursing or sex, so it gets a PG-13, even though the bullets fly and the body count is significant! Ah well... Amazon will notify me when this becomes available.",1362873600,6,2005,4.781976744186046
5516826,5,B00AW9M7TG,"Definitely the Rock's best film to date. And I don't say this just because his past movies have never received much acclaim (critical or popular), or even because he's my all-time favorite wrestler. I have never seen any of his solo movies, but I can tell from watching him in ""Fast Five"" that he is usually on-screen to show off his muscles and general persona of awesomeness. However, with Snitch, he is given the chance to play a character that is actually deep and emotional, much like the script. Sure, the movie has plenty of action. Of course the script is full of cops, drug cartels, and chase scenes. But this is not one of those stupid Redbox 'thrillers' starring someone who is way past their prime and just needs to retire. The Rock is at the top of his game here. He wowed me with his emotional intensity, as well as being able to hold his own alongside such phenomenal talent as Jon Bernthal, Susan Sarandon, Barry Pepper, and yes, Benjamin Bratt. But when talent like that is in some of those humdrum thrillers, they usually only have a cameo role because the star is the true attraction. Not so here. Each one of the supporting cast has a fleshed out role. We get to know them and enjoy their character's presence onscreen. This allows us to have the privilege of naming Snitch as a good Sarandon vehicle, a very good Pepper vehicle, a pretty good Bratt vehicle, and an absolutely excellent effort from Bernthal. I know that action films and comedies usually get looked over at the Academy Awards, but if my opinion mattered at all during the Oscar season, I would definitely nominate the Rock for Best Actor and Bernthal for Best Supporting Actor. Snitch truly is just that good.",1362787200,6,1696,4.600660066006601
5516827,2,B00AW9M7TG,"Snitch stars Dwayne Johnson playing a successful businessman, John Mathews. Mathews lives with his second wife and young daughter. Mathews also has an older son from his first marriage, who lives apart from him with his mother. Early in the film his son gets arrested for drug possession and Mathew's has to snitch on the cartel to lower his son's sentience.

  This film had so many opportunities to become an amazing experience. It could have been a great critique of our current legal and prison system, but no, that idea gets abandoned in the first act of the movie. It could have explored the dangers of the drug world and in a way it did, but due to Dwayne Johnson's monstrous size I never got the feeling that he was ever in any danger. It could have also been a great character piece about a man having to choose between the safety of his new family or the future of his son. On one hand if he chooses to help his son, he is putting his new family in danger of cartel retaliation. On the other hand if he doesn't help his son, his new family would remain safe, but his son will have to spend at least ten years in prison. But no. Dwayne Johnson's character never even thinks about the safety of his new family before deciding to snitch on the cartel. Later in the movie this is brought up, but he is already in the process of snitching and it is never mentioned again.

  Apart from missing these opportunities the movie also suffers from other problems. Once Mathew's character decides to snitch, he uses the help of one of his employees, Daniel, to get an introduced to the drug world. He offers him a great deal of money but refuses because he wants to get his life back on track and has to support his family. Later Daniel decides to take the offer and the reason for this is that his wife's (or girlfriend I forgot) boss makes her go into work late at night. That's it. Daniel decides to risk the ability to support his family just because his wife's boss is mean. Sure there's also the fact that Daniel's son is hanging out with the wrong people and he could use the money to move to a better neighborhood, but all we see of this is his son talking to them. He never does anything wrong and Daniel even tells him not to hang out with them anymore. If the movie would have shown that his son kept on hanging around those people after he was told not to. And if the boss was maybe sexually abusive. Then Daniel would have had a better motive to take the offer in the first place. Again another great opportunity for the movie to tell a great story that gets shoved aside.

  There's also the the issues of Dwayne Johnson not being a good enough actor for this kind of roll. Don't get me wrong I think he did a good job compared to his other rolls, but it was still amateurish at best. A great example of this would be in the ending were he starts screaming (POSSIBLE SPOILER) as his truck slides across the road with him inside (END SPOILER). The face he makes during this scene was so funny, my friend and I started laughing.

  This movie was by far one of the better movies that has come out this year thus far, but I still could not enjoy it because the problems mentioned above made the movie boring for me. Through out the movie I was hoping for Walter White to show up and make the movie better, but that never happened. Now Bryan Cranston would have been perfect for this roll. He would have not only fixed the acting problem, but also the problem with Mathew's character being to big physically to ever give any sense of him being in any danger. I am sure that alone would have risen my rating to 3 stars

  If you like dramas mixed in with some action and don't mind turning your brain off while watching this, then by all means go out and see it. You'll have a good time.",1362614400,3,3794,4.286713286713287
5516828,4,B00AW9M7TG,"Dwayne Johnsonian's new film Snitch is not nearly the generic action-thriller that I was expecting based on the generic trailers that seem so desperate to make you believe it is so. Snitch is surprising in a lot of ways, for one thing it is actually more thoughtful and has ideas and a point of view on current affairs regarding our legal system, it is more powerful than you might suspect and it is an exciting change of pace for a wrestler who wants to be an actor.
 Not to make it sound so trivial, this is to be fair Johnson's best work, as of yet. Though he isn't a fully capable dramatic actor, as of now, he is a lot better than you probably have a right to expected and here he gets to flex a different set of muscle than he usually does.
 Johnson plays John Matthews, a trucking company owner, who's estranged son, Jason (Rai Gavron) finds himself in trouble with the law, and I mean serious kind of trouble, like ten years behind bars kinda trouble. It seems that Jason foolishly agreed to intercept a package of Ecstasy for his best pal, under the mandatory sentencing laws he faces a decade behind bars just for doing so. Jason can't really turn snitch, he doesn't have the stomach for it and besides, he doesn't actually know any drug dealers.
 So John strikes a deal with a hard ass federal prosecutor (Susan Sarandon), that if he helps to sneer a bigger fish drug dealer that his son's sentence will be greatly reduced. But as stated in the great film noir Detour, fate is just waiting to stick it's foot out and trip you. So, John finds himself in one bad situation to one worst situation eventually leading him into the trusted inner circle of a cartel boss called ""El Topo"" (Benjamin Bratt) .
 Johnson may not be ascending to the first rank of acting talents, but he does manage an admirable job. Take Arnold Schwarzenegger for example, he has always had difficulty with playing ordinary-type guys, I always thought that was because he is so far from being an ordinary man that it lacks credibility, what it really was is that he lacked the skill to make it credible. Johnson isn't much more of an ordinary guy-type, but he manages to make us believe him because he succeeds in playing the role well.
 Unexpectedly Johnson is never better than when he's sharing screen time with talented old pros like Oscar winner Susan Sarandan and the underappreciated character actor Barry Pepper. I suspect these fine thespians are able to bring out the best in the big lug, who actually doesn't seem like a big lug at all in this one.
 The real acting high spot however is courtesy of the relatively unknown Jon Bernthal, who plays John's employee who he has help him with his introduction into the drug underworld. Bernthal is a strong and engaging actor, he is able to fully bring his character to empathetic life and I'm going to look forward to seeing him in future roles.
 Directed by former movie stuntman Ric Roman Waugh who relies, perhaps a little too much on the largely unappealing shaky cam for his action scenes. However, he seems to know his way around a tight dramatic script, which he co-authored. Waugh has directed before, particularly a movie titled Felon starring Val Kilmer and Stephen Dorff,  which I have not seen, but have heard good things regarding it and given his work here, I think he will be a director to keep an eye on.
 We are told up front that Snitch was inspired by a true story, just how much of it resembles reality is very little, I suspect. The story is preposterous, but it works as a very entertaining thriller with a well-written script from director Waugh and co-writer  Justin Haythe (Revaluation Road).
 For an actioner, the violence is surprisingly and pleasantly kept to a minimum in most instances helping to give the story a tad more room to breathe and thus credibility. Of course, Snitch has the obligatory car chase and it all comes down to a high speed pursuit and shoot out. However, this movie is more interested in character and ideas than habitual violence, in action movie terms it is more Copland than Demolition Man.
 Recently, a lot of action stars have appeared in tiresome and effete movies, but Johnson has found his way into one of the better ones. Efficiently made, well told with strong performances. As far as action flicks go, this is some thing special and of late, that's become all too rare.

5516829,5,B00AW9M7TG,"In our culture we praise and encourage men who ""act"" tough and masculine. But in this real-life story  we see a man who actually IS tough and masculine! A real man. Someone who is determined, decisive, relentless and brave! A man who could legitimately hide behind a thousand excuses but chooses not too! We can all learn a lot from Snitch: When the chips are down - are we going to do the impossible for someone we love?

If you get weak at the knees, watch Snitch and do all you can do! As the great basketball coach, John Wooden, once said: ""Do Not Let What You Cannot Do Interfere With What You Can Do.""",1361750400,16,607,4.269565217391304
5516830,4,B00AW9M7TG,"In Snitch, Dwayne Johnson stars as John Matthews, a trucking distribution owner that agrees to work with the federal government to be an informant after his son, Jason (Rafi Garvron), is sent to prison for the intent to distribute narcotics.  After striking a deal with the DEA, Matthews (undercover) partners with one of his employees, Daniel (Jon Bernthal), an ex-convict with connections to the drug world.  Barry Pepper, Michael Kenneth Williams, Nadine Velazquez, Benjamin Bratt, and Susan Sarandon round out this star-filled cast.

Now keep in mind, Dwayne Johnson has been one of my favorite athletes since the first time he won the Intercontinental championship - so I'm pretty biased here.  Regardless, to see The Rock come full circle from a young WWE superstar through this role in Snitch is an absolute accomplishment for him, and it's incredibly exciting for all of his millions and millions of fans.  Without question, this is by far the best acting performance from Johnson to date.  He's certainly no Kevin Costner, but he's getting better and better with each passing role.  For once, it's nice to see Johnson go a whole movie without getting into a overpowering physical confrontation of any kind - meaning it's nice to see a film where he isn't giving bad guys ""the rock bottom.""  In this film, he's actually given a chance to show off his dramatic side, as opposed to the constant wave of brute force.  There's never been any doubt that Johnson is filled with charisma, but if you add this less than disarming dramatic side to his resume, it creates even more possibilities for his future roles.

Part of what makes Dwayne Johnson so successful in this role is the cast he has around him.  Most notably, Barry Pepper continues to excell in the majority of his roles - with this role being no exception.  He brings a seriousness to the reality of the situation in this role, a trait that is relatively lacking from Johnson's character.  And, who doesn't want Susan Sarandon as a cast-mate?  Her effortless intuitions take a seemingly boring character and turns her into one of the key components of the plot.  It makes absolute sense for her to play a prosecutor running for Congress - and though her character is a bit ""catty,"" she'd still take in a boatload of votes.

This script essentially sends a watered-down message to viewers that if one of your family members does enough for the government, the government instantly let someone out of jail.  Obviously, the ""deal"" wouldn't apply to all crimes, but the underlying principal is the same - that being the government is somehow flexible just because your loved one is in prison.  While that premise is indeed comical at times, it still makes for interesting entertainment.  On paper, the premise of this film seems a bit tacky (even if it was a true story), but the acting execution is clearly the driving force behind the success of this picture.  Drug cartels are no stranger to film storylines, but this one stands out - not because of its story - but because of the emotionally-driven devotion to family and thematic message regarding what one father will do for his son.

In the end, this movie had my attention simply because The Rock was in the staring role.  It's a complete bonus to get a fast-paced, entertaining film with a well-rounded cast on top of him in the staring role.  In any event, you will absolutely - without question - get your money's worth out of this film.  Two hours will seem like 20 minutes.  Enjoy.

5516831,4,B00AW9M7TG,"I saw this film during an early screening last year. Gotta say it was good. This movie isn't really typical of the other Rock movies like ""Fast Five"" or ""The Rundown"". There's less emphasis on blow up action, and more emphasis on drama (though there is action).

The Rock's acting muscle is on full display though you got the feeling he has physically holding himself back in laying the smackdown (pun intended) to the villains in the movie.

Allegedly based on a true story the plot concerns John Matthews who goes undercover for the DEA who has (depending on your viewpoint) set up his son to take the fall in a drug deal. The Dea or more specifically the state attorney Joanne Keeghan (Susan Sarandon)offers Matthews a deal that will get his son's sentence relieved if John can take down a major drug cartel, so John does with any good Dad will do and takes the offer.

The Rock really does a good job of convincing us about his character. I mean everybody knows he's a wrecking machine, but here he downplays all of his physical attributes and is pretty convincing as an average joe who is really concerned about keeping his family together.

Throughout the movie, he does actually does get beat up pretty well in order for the drug dealers and drug cartel to fall for his act.

The movie is pretty well acted on all fronts, and the emphasis is definitely more on the drama than anything else and it does succeed at that level.

Benjamin Bratt plays Juan Carlos 'El Topo' Pintera who of the people in the cartel. Jon Bernthal (Shane from ""Walking Dead"") is very good in the movie too as the former runner who has been trying to stay straight, but now reluctantly gets called back to do another dirty deal putting his life at risk.

With that said, you can guess how the movie will turn out, but it's a very entertaining movie. It comes out very dramatic, and serious. It's a pretty good movie on all fronts.",1361577600,,1911,4.505780346820809
