5022042,4,B006W1C0C2,"I liked the male/female working out together. The routines for the kettlebell were intermediate to advanced. Beginners may want to try Pavel T., Russian Kettlebell Challendge, to learn proper form and introduction routines. After 30-90 days these routines will add interest and continued progress. The Indian Club training was too short; uTube has better routines and explaination. Generally, this was a very good training with kettlebells (their production crew did not help them with mic, re-takes, etc.).",1355011200,,507,5.597402597402597
5022043,5,B006W1C0C2,"I love this DVD.  Great variety of exercises, nice workout length with the option to make longer if you feel like it.  A must have.",1345939200,2,131,4.2
5022044,5,B006W1C0C2,"I purchased this workout directly from Lauren when she completed it; she can do no wrong as far as I am concerned.  (I have all of her videos except for the pregnancy DVD; I believe it is somewhat similar to her first video.)  I love the length of each kettlbell set/round in Kettlebell Lightning and they blend well together; I feel so accomplished after completing each one (takes about an hour an one minute, including the stretch and cool down).

Her partner on this one, Alex Verdugo, is great.  This was my introduction to him and I hope he does more work with Lauren or something on his own.  Both of their cues and instructions are clear and encouraging.  I rotate this workout among several others that I have; I'm always glad when it's time for me to complete it again.

Five stars indeed.

(Note:  I haven't tried the indian club routine, but I might purchase some clubs for my birthday; a good reason to try something new...)",1343952000,6,937,4.529761904761905
5022045,5,B006W1C0C2,"Lauren does it again!  She and Alex deliver jam-packed, high energy workouts that will NOT disappoint.  This is my 3rd Lauren Brooks' DVD, and while I LOVE the other two, this one  ""takes the cake.""  The music, length of workouts, ambiance, and verbal support by Lauren and Alex are wonderful.  I especially love the fact that you can target your upper or lower body, OR choose to do a total body workout.  I also enjoy the new moves (by ""new"", I am referring to moves that are not on Lauren's Ultimate Conditioning DVDs).  The main workouts are about 15 min. each, which a perfect fit for busy styles.  This DVD was the first time I had ever heard of Alex Verdugo, and I think he did an outstanding job.

There is an introduction to Indian Clubs (they look like a caveman's club) on this DVD, as well.  If you are interested in something new, this may be a great way of learning about another workout.",1329177600,22,902,4.412121212121212
5022046,5,B006W1C0C2,"Like all of her outings, Lauren has delivered yet another accomplished workout dvd, this time sharing the instructing with Alex Verdugo, a fellow RKC - credentialed instructor. The dvd packs 6 workouts,where others barely give one. The workouts are: Upperbody Lightning(Lauren); Lowerbody Lightning(Lauren); Kettlebell Lightning for Extreme Fat loss(Alex); Mental Toughness(Alex); Lightning Abs(Lauren); Indian Clubs(Alex). Lauren and Alex instruct and give pointers throughout the workouts and their energy and commitment are infectious. The workouts are based on rounds, usually 4 for most. There are over 30 Kettlebell and bodyweight exercises, so there's something for everyone. A beautifully-realized and inspired dvd outing. Kudos to Lauren and Alex for this awesome addition to the Kettlebell world.",1327622400,26,806,6.078947368421052
8505272,5,B006W1C0C2,I have tried a lot of different Kettlebell workouts and this is by far my favorite!  Each workout section is short but tough and effective. Do as few or as many as you want to get the workout YOU want!,1453852800,,201,4.025
8505273,5,B006W1C0C2,Excellent and effective! Especially for a seasoned veteran of the Kettlebell wars.,1409875200,,82,5.916666666666667
8505274,5,B006W1C0C2,"Lauren and Alex are very professional and the production is well produced!! This DVD is for the Intermediate KB user. There is no warm-up, so I advise to warm up the muscles before starting. This is my first Lauren Brooks Dvd and I must admit she knows her stuff!! Highly recommended!!",1392163200,3,285,4.607843137254902
8505275,3,B006W1C0C2,"If you follow the workout on this DVD, you'll do fine.  There is no problem with the workout.

That said, the workout isn't very interesting, and neither is the DVD.  I had higher expectations.  This DVD actually reminded me of home made exercise VHS tapes that were so popular in the 1980s.  Very amateurish and dull.  I used it twice, got bored, and moved on to other things.  Free YouTube videos are more informative and interesting!

Not recommended.... but no harm if you buy.",1368748800,6,481,4.642857142857143
8505276,3,B006W1C0C2,"This was ok, not enough variety for me not to get bored with it after time.  Does give you an example of how to workout all body parts.",1366329600,4,135,3.8214285714285716
8505277,4,B006W1C0C2,"Great DVD. Terrible sound. You sent me two at seoerate times and then I wen to the source On The Edge Fitness
and it was just as bad.",1363046400,2,133,3.7857142857142856
8505278,5,B006W1C0C2,"This is not my first Lauren Brooks DVD.  This is definitely a more advanced workout.  If you are just starting kettlebells I recommend ""The Ultimate Body sculpt.""  Both are excellent workouts.  Lauren does a good job of providing instructions on how to use the kettlebell safely.",1360454400,,279,5.0
8505279,4,B006W1C0C2,"I bought this DVD a couple of months ago and didn't get around to using it until today.  Oh my what I have been missing!
First, let me say I do not like that this DVD does not have a warm up section on it.  It has a cool down but not a warm up.  I completed my own warm up before the dvd started.  That is one of the factors that caused me to give this dvd 4 stars instead of 5.
I like that you can do a full body workout or you can just focus on upper or lower body.  However, when you complete the whole dvd it seems that many of the moves are repeating.  Yes there are many different moves but I can't tell you how many swings and snatches are in this dvd because there were so many of them!
Also, I like how each move is only performed for 30 seconds and then you move onto the next workout move.  It makes it seem so much more manageable.  I also like how you are constantly moving from one move to the next with short breaks between segments.  Overall, this is a great dvd!",1358640000,15,979,3.855
8505280,4,B006W1C0C2,"A no nonesense routines and instructions. DVD assumes some familiarity with kettle bells and movements.
Due to holidays, i have not used it routinely.",1357862400,,150,5.291666666666667
8505281,5,B006W1C0C2,I enjoy Lauren Brooks. Everything she has done I have been impressed with and she is just awesome. The workouts in this DVD are short but they are tough. Very clear instruction and easy to follow. You can do the workouts more than once or blend different ones together. I really enjoy the clubbell instruction at the end with Alex too. I cant wait for her to come out with her new DVD and I hope to see more of Alex. He is very good as well.,1357689600,,441,4.080459770114943
