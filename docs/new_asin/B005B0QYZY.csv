4642865,4,B005B0QYZY,"I grew up watching these movies, yes the acting is bad, yes the plots are predictable, yes the effects are cheesy BUT they are so much fun to watch and laugh at. All that is missing is the Mystery Science Theater 3000 crew adding their own wonderful commentary.",1357516800,,261,4.458333333333333
4642866,5,B005B0QYZY,"Late at night, many many years ago, I found the first Subspecies movie being played on USA's ""Up All Night"" with Gilbert Gottfried. If I hadn't had spent the entire day & early night getting hammered, I might have changed the channel. I'm glad I didn't! Subspecies is the premiere title (in my humble opinion at least) of all the Full Moon franchises. It's got the best production value, plot line, and cutest girls of all the F.M.V. movies. Plus it's got Angus Scrimm from the Phantasm movies as the King Vladislas of the Vampires, which is totally cool.

I think Radu might be in my top 5 all-time greatest evil vampire characters in film. He's utterly unrepentant and evil. He kills his father (the King of the Vampires), tries to kill his foppish human-loving brother Stefan, and creates a group of small demonic creatures by breaking off his fingers.

The main story revolves around three college students, Mara, Michelle, and Lillian. It also revolves around Radu and his lust for the Bloodstone, a mystic object that drips the blood of saints. It allows vampires to feed without having to kill humans, which suits the bouffant-haired Stefan just fine. (He looks a bit like Rick Springfield in 1982) Eventually Radu transforms Mara and Lillian into vampires, and attempts to do the same to MIchelle, who Stefan is now in love with. Stefan is forced to transform Michelle to save her from Radu, who Stefan ends up staking and beheading. Luckily for the sequel, Radu's miniature minions are able to resurrect him.

The later Subspecies sequels aren't nearly as classic as the first in my opinion. However, this particular release has them all in case you're a geek for collecting movies like I am.",1355443200,4,1701,4.798634812286689
4642867,4,B005B0QYZY,"I have been looking for this series for awhile so was happy to find all 5 movies in one set.
My guilt pleasure: really bad B horror movies - this fits the bill.",1353974400,,160,3.878787878787879
4642868,5,B005B0QYZY,"I had to give this 5 stars because the films are well worth it, these are really well done films even though they were straight to video back in the day, probably the best B-movies I've watched. Pretty much the story follows Radu killing his father in order to get the Bloodstone (which holds blood of the saints) and his failing attempt to turn his 'pretty one' Michele into his fledgling.. That's the plot mostly and then you have the spinoff film Vampire Journals which is about a good vampire on a mission to kill the evil Ash and the bloodline. These films are simple but really well done. The Radu makeup til this very day is still creepy (very scary when I was a kid) and the special effects were good for the time. I highly recommend these to any horror fan or vampire fan.. But be warned if are into the Twilight saga or any weak vamp crap like that than these films aren't for, no sparkly sissy vampires in the Subspecies world haha. Anyways check them out and you won't be dissapointed.",1349481600,2,997,4.394594594594595
4642869,4,B005B0QYZY,"Let me just begin by saying that I used to rent all of the Full Moon films during Full Moon's heyday, and I shall probably always have a soft spot for many of these films. It's a wonderful time to be a Full Moon fan as so much is available right now for so little. With that said, let's cut to the chase.

Who would enjoy these films?  Anyone who enjoys low budget horror or low budget vampire flicks.

What are the production values like? These films were produced in Romania with the first one coming fairly soon after the fall of Communism. Make no mistake, these are not big budget productions, but they did manage to get quite a bit out of a limited budget due to lower costs, and you cannot beat the real backdrops and castles used no matter how much one might spend on sets. That being said, by today's standards, the special effects are more often like special defects.

What is the quality of the DVD like? Not much better than the VHS recordings I used to rent, but perfectly serviceable. These are low budget films from the 90s and were intended for straight to video. That being said, the quality is comparable to TV series on DVD from that time, which to be perfectly honest is about as good as one can expect.

How are the films themselves? Subspecies is a little slow paced, but part II and III are quite good, with IV starting to taper off again. Vampire Journals is rather slow paced, and is the weakest of the lot.",1330992000,21,1432,4.3283582089552235
4642870,3,B005B0QYZY,"Ah, vampire B-movie schlock. Not big blockbusters starring Anne Rice vamps or Stephenie Meyer sparklepires, but lower-budget affairs splattered with blood.

One of the best examples of the genre is ""Subspecies,"" a movie series with a genuinely creepy villain and lots of atmosphere. ""Subspecies The Complete Chronicles"" brings together all four ""Subspecies"" movies -- plus a delightfully goofy spinoff film, ""Vampire Journals"" -- following the vampire Radu's pursuit of a pretty but utterly useless American girl.

""Subspecies"" introduces us to the evil, ghoulish Radu (Anders Hove), a vampire who murders his own father to gain the mystical Bloodstone. Three grad students are visiting nearby in a small Romanian village, and Radu takes the opportunity to attack them. But his sensitive brother Stefan and an elderly Romanian man are out to save the day!

""Subspecies II: Bloodstone"" has Michelle (Denise Duff) escaping to Bucharest with the Bloodstone, and calling on her sister Becky (Melanie Shatner) for help. But Radu is determined to find her -- and now he has his dusty ""mummy"" to help him. ""Subspecies III: Bloodlust"" has Michelle back in Radu and Mummy's grasp, transported back to the remote castle. As she's educated in the ways of the vampire, she begins to slip into darkness... and Radu begins to fall in love.

""Subspecies: Bloodstorm"" deposits Michelle in the care of a very creepy doctor who claims to be able to cure her vampirism. Meanwhile, Radu descends on one of his fledglings, the music-loving Ash (Jonathon Morris) at his casino in Bucharest, seeking a place to stay while he reclaims his ""pretty one.""

And ""Vampire Journals"" is TECHNICALLY a spinoff, but except for the character of Ash, it has little in common with the other movies. Tortured vampire Zachary (David Gunn) is determined to kill all vampires of his bloodline, including Ash. But when Ash targets a beautiful pianist, Zachary will risk everything to save her -- including his life.

""Subspecies"" is a pretty cheesy piece of work -- lots of naked boobs, goopy blood and hilarious death scenes (head-stab to death! Dismemberment! Decapitation!) permeate the series.  However, it's a fun kind of cheesy. It's the kind of cheesy that you want to get popcorn for, rather than scoffing at -- and it's definitely more hardcore than ""Twilight.""

The movies do have their ups and downs, though. ""Subspecies"" is a fun, fun movie; ""Bloodstone"" and ""Bloodlust"" have their flaws (Michelle's total uselessness, mainly), but they are still entertaining little horror movies with the same overall tone. There's lots of Romanian castles and clubs, rural festivals and vampire attacks, and director Ted Nicolaou keeps each movie flowing from one to the next.

The problem is ""Bloodstorm,"" which is an abomination in every way -- continuity, characterization, tone and even makeup are hideously disrupted. What about ""Vampire Journals""? Well... it's pretty awful. But it's fun in its pretentious neo-gothic/romantic Anne-Ricean style.

The characters, however, are a mixed bag. Hove is a deliciously disgusting villain, with his stringy fingers, ghoulish face and drooling mouth. But he also manages to inject some pathos into Radu in ""Bloodlust,"" where we see the vampire starting to grow sad. Shatner is quite good as a strong, independent heroine who just wants to rescue her sister, and Morris is quite elegant as Ash (even if he always sounds like he's swooning).

Sadly, Denise Duff's Michelle does little other than cry, scamper around whining, crying and hanging around Bucharest clubs in increasing gothic clothing. You'll get tired of her fast; the character is much better when played by Laura Tate. Stefan is possibly the wimpiest vampire in existence (he's immobilized by a NET), and ""Mummy"" may actually be a mummy that someone dug up and put on puppet strings.

""Subspecies The Complete Chronicles"" brings together the good, the bad, and the grotesquely ugly in this series. Three movies are good, one is horrendous, and one is a campy funfest -- definitely worth watching for fans of cheese.",1329782400,6,4081,5.185410334346504

Here's the thing, they're great! Full Moon was the Hammer Films of my youth. They hold a special place in my little black heart.

The one series that stands out most to me is Ted Nicolaou's Subspecies. Thus far there are five films
Subspecies
Bloodstone: Subspecies II
Bloodlust: Subspecies III
Bloodstorm: Subspecies IV
and The Vampire Journals ties into them. There is rumors that a part 5 is in the works (Ted, if you read this, please say this is true. The fans desperately want it!)

The films follow the vampire Radu (Anders Hove) through the beautiful Romanian setting as he tries to capture, the equally beautiful, Michelle Morgan (played by Denice Duff).

This collection is well prices and worth every single penny! All five films on five discs complete with the behind the scenes segments on each. The transfer, picture, sound is all very well done. If you're like me and remember these gems, this is well worth the price. All of these films are cult classics. I should know... I'm one of the cultists!
