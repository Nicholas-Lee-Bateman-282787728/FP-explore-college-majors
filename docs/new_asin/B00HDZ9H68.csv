Unlike many of my Fanfare colleagues, Ive never before reviewed a live video performance of a concert, although I have reviewed a couple of opera videos. So, I was at a bit of a loss as how to proceed, given that 99.9 percent of my listening to recorded music over the years has been without any video component to contend with. As I got into this fascinating program of music by Keith Kramer, I began to realize that the visual aspect did provide interesting information in many places. For one thing, Kramer utilizes many special effects in certain of his pieces. One that is quite novel occurs in The End is an infinite beginning, a work scored for soprano saxophone and bass trombone. At several points, the trombonist is instructed to slap the mouthpiece with the palm of his hand (obviously not when the instrument is up against his lips!). This action produces a momentary plunking sound of indistinct pitch. In another place the trombonist blows through his instrument while it is muted. Without the video, it is unlikely I would have guessed the method of production of these effects.

In other places, the performance is just fun to watch. One such place occurs in Insurmountable, when pianist Joseph Satava swirls his hands around on the strings of the piano to produce an unusual strumming effect. Perhaps the most interesting discovery made possible by having the video came in Indelible, a work scored for solo cello and string quartet. The solo cello part was masterfully played, and in a mere audio recording, I would have given profuse kudos to cellist Sebastian Stoger-DeMayo for his superb artistry. But what I saw in the video caused my mouth to drop open: This cellist is but a boy, and checking the biographies after watching the recital, I found out that he was a mere 11 years old in 2010 when this recital took place. This young man will surely go on to a major career in cello performance if he keeps up with his instrument (not all prodigies do, of course).

As long as Im discussing the video aspects of this DVD, I should mention that while the videography is reasonably well done, there were only one or two cameras involved. The images went back and forth between close-ups and wider shots, but they were all taken head on, with no side views or the like.

Inasmuch as I and other reviewers have discussed Kramers musical style, as well as most of the specific works heard in this concert in previous reviews (see, for instance, 31:6, 32:1, and 35:4), I need not recapitulate detail about these things here. Suffice it to say that he writes in a most imaginative and expressive atonal style, with a generous smattering of avant-garde effects. The one work that stands apart from the others presented here is Indelible, which is quite chromatic but nevertheless distinctly tonal. Obviously, Kramer has not chosen to put all of his eggs in one stylistic basket. In the others, one hears skillful use of various elements, including an impressive use of silence in The End is an infinite beginning, or the mysterious mood in Cathartic. The latter is rife with ghostly sounds that would give some listeners pause before they listened to the work with the lights out. Since Kramer doesnt sound much like anyone else I can think of, its difficult to say, If you like so and so, youll really get into this. For the adventurous, though, this music ought to bestow many rewards to the listener. The DVD includes bonus tracks with texts, performer biographies, and two additional videos of pieces not performed on the 2010 concert in Merkin Hall in New York from which most of these performances derive.",1453766400,,3664,4.765354330708662
