3831795,5,B0021BSOHM,"No it isn't. I know people who absolutely hate this movie. But there are fans of this movie - including me - who accepts it flaws and all. I have to say any horror movie that takes place in an Old West ghost town is good in my book. Plus it's an early 80's slasher. I can't hate 80's slashers. Anyway before I gush too much I want to get to the best feature on this disc. The audio commentary. The director explains what happens and who is doing the killing in this sometimes confusing movie. I used to get what happened in this movie when I was a teen renting this movie over and over from the video store. But I hadn't seen this movie over 15 years and I just watched it again recently and I was a little confused over who the killer was. The director explained who it was and why they were doing the killing. It may be a little far-fetched but it made me appreciate the movie even more. The story is about a group of vacationing water rafters who happen to take a little excursion to a deserted ghost town in Texas. They decide to stay overnight (big mistake because it is a spooky old ghost town). Soon they are being killed off one by one from some mysterious killer. Bad or good, you decide. For me I am going to stay away from any deserted Old West town at night.",1304553600,7,1270,4.125
3831796,1,B0021BSOHM,"'Scream'  (1981), is supposed to be a slasher or thriller, but I didn't find it very thrilling. This movie is just plain boring.  It lacked, in that the suspense lead-ups to the ""scary parts"" were exaggerated to a point where I lost interest, and the gory parts were very quick with minimal viewing.

In my own personal opinion, if the viewers were given more clearly graphic scenes to wet their appetites, it might not have been such a bad or boring movie. Sorry, but I rate this movie from 1-10 as 1. ""Awful"".  A low budget movie. Though this movie was released in 1982, it is definitely a very 1970's type movie.",1247356800,2,615,4.464285714285714
3831797,4,B0021BSOHM,"Godawful movie that I was very much looking forward to seeing on DVD, particularly for the director's commentary.  Unfortunately, pre-orders were so low that the release has been cancelled.  So, in a futile gesture, I will now pre-order it.

As for the film itself, so many adjectives apply.  Dreamlike, boring, nonsensical, fascinating, impoverished, dull, misguided, spellbinding, asinine, inspirational...",1244160000,8,408,5.982758620689655
8348876,5,B0021BSOHM,I always liked this movie. Have the VHS and I wanted to get a copy on DVD. A good ghost story and something to watch.,1519084800,,117,3.72
8348877,1,B0021BSOHM,"Up a lazy river by the old mill run.  That lazy, lazy river in the noonday sun.................
A group of people set out on a rafting trip and end up in a ghost town (accent on GHOST).  The first night, at the stroke of midnight, three of the group are quickly killed by an unseen something.  One is hanged; the other two are cleaver-ed to death.  The survivors hope to escape the next morning only to find their rafts are missing.  Since walking out would make way too much sense, they spend another night allowing the ghostly presence to hack up three more people.

This is the weirdest non-slasher slasher-flick Ive ever seen.  The killer is never shown but close-ups of its deadly implements are.  The entire cast excels in staring off into space without moving a muscle, just standing and staring or sitting and staring.  The dialog is minimal and uninspiring.  When a salty old sea dog shows up in the middle of the night, he too just sits and stares before slowly-slowly-slowly muttering, I was a sailor you know..........for 40 years.  Like they needed a nonsensical bedtime story!!!

This unconvincing ghost story lacks originality, suspense, and coherence.  And its a lousy film transfer to-boot!
If you enjoy watching people wandering around in the middle of the night, doing precious little to protect themselves from a bone-idle ghost, then this non-horror horror-flick is for you.  But!!!  There isn't a power on earth that could persuade me to watch this muck again!  On a scale of nothing...........this is minus nothing.",1456099200,2,1538,4.857692307692307
8348878,1,B0021BSOHM,This movie is sooo bad it will piss you off. The script is obviously written by someone who has not yet reached puberty. The actors stand around mumbling lines that are ridiculous considering the circumstances. With no nudity or gore I don't know why it is rated R.,1455321600,,265,4.541666666666667
8348879,5,B0021BSOHM,Five stars. A really terrible movie but my wife is in it. What else could I do?,1453766400,2,79,3.7058823529411766

8348881,4,B0021BSOHM,It's very low budget but it is good maybe for a rainy day when nothing is on. People stranded in a ghost town and guess what one by one there picked off. Give it a try I didn't like the first time but second time around I did.,1425600000,,226,3.7291666666666665
8348882,2,B0021BSOHM,"Dumb horror movie with poor acting, characters, story,( It takes place in a ghost town ) and a ending that didn't reveal who the killer was, or why he did the killings.",1411776000,,168,4.28125

8348884,5,B0021BSOHM,"One of the most boring horror films is still interesting because it contains plenty of WTF? moments. Made in 1981, but not released until 1985. Doesn't that tell you something?",1385683200,,176,4.9
8348885,3,B0021BSOHM,a descent film it gets the job done without boring you not much gore or any originality to the killings just a good way to waste an hour and a half,1383350400,,147,3.774193548387097
