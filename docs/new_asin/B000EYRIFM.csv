8115844,4,B000EYRIFM,"This workout is from the WHFN series, led by Heidi Tanner who is one of my all time favorite instructors from the Firm.  It has plenty of weight work but also a few cardio portions.  You will need an assortment of weights, a tall step, dowel or stick and a yoga block is also used. I didn't have a yoga block which worked fine, I just subbed a lighter dumbbell.

I found this to be a solid workout overall, somewhat therapeutic actually. It was designed to use heavier weights and everything is worked well.  But for some reason, it really dragged for me.  I also found it to be somewhat similar to Metaboost in terms of some of the exercises, even though Metaboost might be deemed a lighter weight workout.  Being that I enjoyed Metaboost more, I likely won't reach for Pump as often.  Metaboost is slightly shorter in length so perhaps that played a role as well.

Heidi Tanner does a great job here as always.  I will give Pump 4 stars, but there are other WHFN workouts that I prefer over this one.",1451692800,2,1002,4.372972972972973
8115845,4,B000EYRIFM,"Just tried this video, my third from the WHFN series. I loved the first one I tried, Upper Body Burn with Keli Roberts, but more recently, I tried Metaboost with Heidi Tanner, and it just didn't click with me. Therefore, I was apprehensive about giving Heidi another go, but happily for me, I liked this one much better--it reminded me more of Heidi's From the Ground Up, an older FitPrime that I also enjoy.

Anyway, back to Push. It begins with nice warm-up that runs through a sequence of moves several times, similar to what Keli does in UBB. Next it's to the floor for core work, but you're also getting some leg work in with pelvic tilts, or bridge. The abs work, while thorough, wasn't all that intense, but we'll see how it works over time. Next comes triceps work; Heidi uses a yoga block, but I highly recommend a heavy dumbbell instead--I used 1 8#, and I definitely would go heavier next time. Similarly, Heidi gives you the option of holding one heavy dumbbell for all of the leg work, like the leg presses on the box which are next up, but I actually used two dumbbells and held them on my shoulders rather than at my sides like Heidi does; doing this, I really felt these moves, especially given that they are performed at a slow, steady pace.

Before you repeat the leg work on the other side, you'll do your first cardio segment, which includes fun, simple steps, some punches, and optional jumps. After the Dominant-side leg presses (Heidi doesn't always cue which side, so you have to remember on your own to start on the Non-Dominant side first) comes a unique push-up series that has you go from push-ups into an elbow plank and back again--it sounds easy, but it's quite tough, and you're getting in some additional core work as well. Then more cardio, this time with a 5# dumbbell (which was plenty heavy here!) to do some overhead presses combined with leg balances and extensions; this segment really got my HR going, and I DID use the stick. Following this was lat work with a unique twist, literally--Heidi adds a shoulder rotation.

Dips are next, and I would recommend moving the step out of the way even though Heidi says to leave it for balance. Again, I skipped the stick and added weights, which made these tough. After another short cardio segment--this one a bit more dancey in nature and fun as well--the dips are repeated on the other side. The ""step kiss"" move is a squat where you bring your butt down to just touching the step; Heidi adds a shoulder rotation to this move as well. The ""hemisphere leg extension"" is another deceptively tough move: leaning over with your back flat and your hands on the box, you move one leg out to side and up (again, remember to start on the ND side), circle back and down, then bring the leg back up and around--Heidi does a lot of reps, and I really felt these!

""Floor kiss"" was similar to a move which I've seen called ""woodchop"" in other videos: you reach down to one side in sort of a twisting lunge, then reach back up, twisting to the other side. I believe that this is a functional fitness move, one of several that are woven into this workout. After repeating the ""step kiss"" on the other side, Heidi finishes with a nice stretch, first standing, then on the floor--my one complaint here is that the stretches are not held equally to both sides.

Overall, I definitely enjoyed this workout; I think I'll like it even more as I become more familiar with it. It definitely has a lower body emphasis, and if you increase the resistance, you should feel quite challenged. Furthermore, you are working hard enough most of the time to derive cardio benefits as well--my HR was in my target zone for at least half of this workout (it might have been more, but I forgot to turn on my HRM right away!). If you enjoy aerobic weight training-style workouts, don't mind a fair amount of equipment shifting, and like Heidi as an instructor, I would definitely recommend this video.",1142812800,6,3952,4.5371669004207575
