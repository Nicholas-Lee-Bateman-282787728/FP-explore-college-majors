8238981,5,B0010X8NLY,"Mushi are living organisms in their purest form. Ginko is a Mushishi, a man that studies the Mushi. Not everyone can see Mushi. Those that can are either scared of them or fascinated by them. Ginko travels the country helping people who have encounters with the different varieties of Mushi.

Each episode of this series is a different story. Ginko's travels lead him to many people that need his help. I am blown away by this anime. The animation, music, and plot are all superbly done. I can't say enough good things about Mushishi. I hope you check it out. It's great that Funimation put this title in the SAVE edition. I think that's the cheapest way to buy the complete series, so I would go that route instead. It's a steal for the money.",1354752000,,744,4.511111111111111
8238982,5,B0010X8NLY,I just Mushi-shi disc #6 in the mail today. I have seen disc 1 & 2 of the series so far. This anime makes you really think. the epiodes are very stand-alone. The series deals with the supernatural but done in a way not to freighten the veiwer. The main cather comes off as cold but polite.,1267660800,,289,4.087719298245614

i finally completed mushi-shi and i must say i've really enjoyed the series from begining to end it was such a beautiful anime the background and music was breath takeing i couldn't help but being engrossed watching it.

the main character of the show is Ginko who is a mushi-shi master he's a rare person who attracts mushi everywhere he's constantly wanders researing different kind of mushi and helping people that are dealing with mushi.  Ginko carries a mysterious wooden box wherever  he gose. the box contains souvenirs old letters medicine details of most of its contents remain enigma.

Ginko has a strange apearance with his unusual white hair and green eye colour are the result of an incident involving mushi that happend when he was a child. as a result of this wherever Ginko vist where people have mushi problmes once he cures them he move on he cant stay in one place to long becuase he could attact other mushi plus Ginko smokes constnlty in order to repel the mushi which are endlessly drawn to him.

 episode 20 that i really like it was abouta women called TANYU KARIBUSA she the forth-generation scrible of Karibusa family. she bears the mark of generation, cursed to drown in a sea of written characters. The forbidden sealed away withen her body mushi masters come to vist her and tell her mushi-shi stories which she writes and stores away in scrolls hidden away in a serect room which the mushi-shi cant escape there a women who is a mushi-shi master to the karbusa family she has watched and taken care of Tanyu Karibusa since her birth.

Ginko cames and vist Tanyu Karibusa to tell her mushi-shi stories plus to read the scrolls that contain mushi-shi stories and she ask him when her leg gets better that she can walk on it she would like to travel with thats unless by that time she dies of old age.... Ginko said he would like her to travel with some day if not he dosent die of old age or is killed by a mushi-shi. i like that episode.

episode  21 which i found creepy is about a women called AKI who is a mother that gives birth to  child  who was born with abnormal figure which hides under the house then  six weeks later her and her hasband find a baby under the house she knows its  her own son she grows up to what they see as a normal healthy boy but delvopes a green disease they write to Ginko for help but when he arrives he cant help their son and have no choice but to kill him. Then more of the strange Childern start to appaer and delveople very quicky that they can talk and they aslo learn very quickly each one of the developeing the same green disease has the first child AKI hasband writes to Ginko and tells him and he returns to kill them but the childern becuse there dangerous end up burning the hole house so that Ginko cant kill them. The Reason that i found this epsiode creepy was because the childen where crossed eyed.

overall i enjoyed watching the hole series and the box set is beautiful and each vol comes with a lovely book and post cards i recomend Mushi-shi  you get extra features on Vol 6 of  Mushi-shi proudction site tour which is in japanese but with english subtitles alot of work was put into doing Mushi-shi also a actor/ director commentary also the last epsiode you get to see Ginko as a young boy, i hope there's going to a sequel of Mushi-shi i would like to see more of Ginko finding more Mushi-shi.",1210809600,3,3413,4.417862838915471
8238984,5,B0010X8NLY,"I've been seriously watching anime for a couple years now, and of all the series I have watched, this one has been the most gratifying of all. Its tone is almost zen-like, the animation and artwork are beautiful, the episodes are fascinating and disturbing, and I found that as I finished each DVD, I felt uplifted and simply happy to be alive. The series centers around a man who travels Japan helping people who have ""mushi trouble"". Mushi are defined as the essence of life itself, which is neutral, but which can cause people all sorts of problems in various situations. Ginko, the main character, seeks to help people and mushi to co-exist peacefully wherever possible. Because the series is episodic in nature, we only slowly learn about the hero, his past, and his personality. The care which the producers put into this series is apparent in each story. I highly recommend this series.",1207872000,,893,4.805194805194805
8238985,5,B0010X8NLY,"I recommend all the Mushi Shi series.  The messages are powerful about the connections we have to all life forms and, even if those life forms seem to ""cause"" maladies, it is because we are out of balance with them.

In this volume, we get to address personal judgements against others, arrogance in knowing what is best for the environment, and the awakening of senses.

Keep those volumes coming and save the next one for me!",1206489600,,427,4.592105263157895
8238986,5,B0010X8NLY,"Mushishi is an absolute masterpeice. It's a fantasy/drama unlike any you'll ever find, and it's my favorite anime.

Each episode tells a different story. I thought I would be bothered by this, but I wasn't. This adaptation is very faithful to the source material.

Mushishi evokes many different emotions while viewing it. Some episodes may have a really nice ending, while others can be really sad. The beautiful background music amplifies these effects.

The music is very serene. Listening to the OST, something I do everyday, is the best way to relieve stress. It really works wonders for the anime, especially when considering the quality of animation maintained throughout all 26 episodes.

I have yet to see an anime series animated as beautifully as Mushishi is. Everything was so well done, you can tell they spent a lot of time translating this from the manga. The Mushi are reminiscent of the creatures you would find in a Hayao Miyazaki film, the Kodoma of Princess Mononoke perhaps. They have a certain magical aura, a mystifying presence, that makes you want to see more and more of them.

I suggest you buy the DVDs, which come in a very nice package with lots of extras. This is an anime which should be seen by anyone who enjoys anime.

This DVD, the final volume, contains episodes 23-26.",1203292800,6,1306,4.808035714285714
8238987,5,B0010X8NLY,I can not recommend this series enough its been fantastic from the start. I can't explain it but it just leaves you with such a good feeling after viewing each episode. I look forward to this final volume! 5 stars,1198800000,,213,4.35
