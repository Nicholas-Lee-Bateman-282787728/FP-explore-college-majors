3514327,4,B001CO32HQ,"Unless you are already familiar with this film's history and backstory, I would suggest you watch the extra featurette ""Secrets De Tournage"" included on the disc before watching the actual film.  Watching the film first without this information will be a bit confusing if you do not already know the history between the director and the film's ""missing"" actor, Johan.
A great period piece that was way ahead of its time.  In FRENCH with English Subtitles, but that does not get in the way of enjoying this retro cinematic experience.  Explicit in spots but done so more to show DESIRE rather than just a sex act.",1225238400,24,612,4.754716981132075
3514328,4,B001CO32HQ,"an excellent movie or documentary ??  not sure. the extras are just
about better than the movie .  this was more of a search for someone to
play johan, than a record of his love for johan.
as always,  the french really know how to make a movie",1225152000,9,243,4.020833333333333

8288296,2,B001CO32HQ,"I guess this movie could be considered a classic by some due to the graphic gay content (fisting, etc) in a movie made in the 70's. If you are the type to collect stuff for it's historical value go for it, but it's terrible as movies go. Really bad picture, sound, acting, story, etc. I'm not going to throw it away, but I probably won't ever watch it again.",1424736000,,358,4.202898550724638
8288297,1,B001CO32HQ,"The French certainly improved in the genre as years went by, but this early effort is horrible. The main story line is weak at best. The photography that other critics raved about is awful. If the jumping back and forth from black and white to color film had some symbolic significance, it did not help drive the plot or improve the picture.
 Touted as a great achievement in early gay film, it was made on the heels of several far superior films and years after them. This is a poor showing even for a 20 something film maker.
 Character development is weak and at no time does the viewer feel drawn in or emotionally involved with any character. The acting, a term I use simply to label all that jumping around, is odd, and unconvincing.
 It is not worth your time even as a film historian.  This film is a pass.",1420588800,,814,4.370860927152318
8288298,5,B001CO32HQ,"Very nice story.  I would watch this over and over again.  Thank you for making this movie!
Wonderful scenery and setting.",1398211200,,122,4.761904761904762
8288299,5,B001CO32HQ,"This is pure genious!  I positively LOVE IT! Besides being uniquely creative and very unusual.  So refreshing to hear some NEW sounds in music. ""OUT OF THE BOX"" MUSIC. This is ""Only"" the tip  of the iceberg for Johan, a musical and artistic genious.",1397001600,,249,4.613636363636363
8288300,4,B001CO32HQ,"It is a romantic story where a blur line between shooting a movie and its creators' lives is near invisible presented with kaleidoscope of events reflecting real producer's affairs terminated.

This work is a visual artifact of the seventies of the twentieth century, the epoch of the sexual revolution and broadening the public acceptance of sexual expressions either in private or ones broadcasted, created with exhibiting a beauty of human bodies and variety of forms sex gratification is about.

A movie is much soft then modern&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/9-Songs/dp/B000BGH29K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">9 Songs</a>but explicitly funny-playful as life and lust are.

Nice to watch.",1297123200,3,734,6.32
8288301,4,B001CO32HQ,"I really enjoyed this film but part of the reason is that I was in Paris about the time that this film was set. I was therefore able to empathize with the weird clothes that the actors wore, the ancient cars, etc. I liked the way that the film jumped around from scene to scene with minimal links. So like life. I also liked the way that male sex was displayed without any sort of embarrassment or censorship. So unlike a US film. I am always amazed that US films will show the grossest and most horrific violence but once one gets to sex then it is censorship time. I am not a great fan of the French but some things they get just right.",1253145600,5,638,4.112
8288302,5,B001CO32HQ,This movie is awesome for the art.  The 'behind the scenes' is better than the movie but this movie is hot.  The men are beautiful and there is a lot of nudity so it's at least worth a rental. Awesome.  Check it out.,1249948800,6,216,3.9767441860465116
8288303,1,B001CO32HQ,"""Johan"" is touted as ""a French classic, complete and unseen since 1976."" Supposedly it was too hot for even the French when it was released-- yep, there is a lot of badly photographed explicit sex. I wasn't sure if the sex was real or faked but who cares. Where to start? The plot is impossible to follow-- if you can call what happens a plot. There are a lot of shaky camera movements. Even if Phillippe is attempting to make a movie about his affair with Johan and is an amateur at best, some of the footage should be in focus to show the contrast between the two films, to showcase the director Philippe Vallois' prowess as an artist; shouldn't it?  Now and again the film goes from badly filmed black and white to badly filmed color. A woman wanders in from time to time. A lot of cruising and anonymous sex takes place. There is a black and white sex scene, that is, black man on white man sex. Oh, don't forget the barebacking. But in this instance it is two naked man on horseback. A drag queen or two shows up. Someone who says he only sleeps with his twin rejects advances from other guys in a sauna. One character describes himself as a sadist. I am obviously a masochist since I watched this dog to the bitter end, all hour and a half of it, complete with music by Anton Bruckner. I kid you not.

Save your money. Walk the dog, take a nap or do your yoga. Life is too short and precious to spend an hour and a half on this movie.",1237420800,6,1440,4.194945848375451
8288304,2,B001CO32HQ,"I whs hoping for something more interesting. It was hard to follow. It was more like a documentary, than a drama. Maybe i will have to watch it again to get the idea of it. Better luck next time.",1234224000,3,195,4.0256410256410255
