8380263,5,B002TJR92M,"I ordered 8 sets of different cartoon collections from Thunderbean. This is the first set I have viewed completely and I am so glad these people have gathered these films together, it must have been quite a chore.  I am 65 and remember these T & J cartoons from when I watched them on TV in the early 1950s, especially the Magic Mummy.  I am amazed at how exact my memories of these cartoons are.  Along with the Fleischer studio Van Beuren did some amazing things with cartoons and music. The bonus material, especially the Waffles and Don cartoons are great.  What a wonderful set for someone that remembers these from childhood and for those that have never seen these early examples of the crazy ideas the animators had beck then.
The picture quality is as good as can be expected from old prints, some look really good, but none are the crappy versions on most PD collections.  The Sound is good, if noisy in some places.  THANK YOU THUNDERBEAN!",1381276800,2,950,4.5588235294117645
8380264,5,B002TJR92M,"It is indeed refreshing, when a fellow cartoon fan, has his eyeballs treated to such a fine collection as this! Seeing these Tom & Jerry Cartoons all together in one collection is a classic animation fan's, dream come true. So many of these Van Buren cartoons have popped up on numerous low quality transfers, as part of shoddy discs, that seeing them here restored from the finest elements possible, is worth anyone's time and money. Reasonably priced to boot! You and your family (Even thou black and white, the kiddies love these!) will harken back to the days when cartoons were done by hand, not by moving a computer mouse. From the first cartoon to the last, you will be entertained and maybe just (Gasp!) educated about a long lost art form.",1315267200,,748,4.674242424242424
8380265,4,B002TJR92M,"Thunderbean has done a wonderful job restoring the animation of Van Beuren for future generations. Regardless of tight budgets, the New York studio produced some bizarre and underrated cartoons - particularly those featuring the musical antics of Tom & Jerry. The long-awaited ""Complete Animated Adventures"" includes the duo's 1931-33 output in the best existing condition. Apart from an occasional misfire such as ""Plane Dumb,"" the Tom & Jerry shorts maintain a good batting average. ""Wot a Night,"" ""Piano Tooners,"" ""Pots and Pans,"" ""Joint Wipers"" and ""The Tuba Tooter"" are standouts in this two-disc set. The special features and bonus ""Waffles and Don"" cartoons provide value for money.",1310601600,,689,5.4485981308411215
8380266,5,B002TJR92M,"The Van Beuren studio was a crazy place, where cartoons seem to have been written and animated at random. As a result, they have a crazy charm that no other studio can approach.
Long before the cat & mouse duo, Van Beuren created their Tom & Jerry, two human characters who evolved from an earlier pair, Waffles the Cat and Don Dog. Oddly enough, Waffles & Don, though they only appeared in a few cartoons, have more clearly defined personalities than Tom & Jerry. However, in short, Tom (formerly Waffles) is tall and skinny, somewhat timid, too; Jerry (Don) is short and round and more daring. They can do most anything - being cartoon characters they can abandon the laws of physics at will - and the results, while no threat to Disney's supremacy, are a lot of fun. Thunderbean once again has done a fine job assembling all the Tom & Jerry cartoons - with the Waffles & Don cartoons thrown in!",1296691200,2,897,4.50920245398773
8380267,5,B002TJR92M,"I'm a big fan of early sound cartoons, and am often frustrated in my search for good, clean prints of them.  I'm happy to report that these restorations from Thunderbean are far and away the best copies I've ever seen of these forgotten Tom and Jerry shorts.  As others have said, anyone with even a casual interest in early animation simply must see these.

What you're getting (and for a very attractive price) is all 26 of Van Beuren Studio's T & J shorts, plus 4 bonus ""Waffles and Don"" (sort of a primitive animated Abbott & Costello meets Felix the Cat duo), and a handful of essays and promotional materials from the vaults.

For the uninitiated who may not have seen a Van Beuren Tom and Jerry cartoon, you're in for a treat.  These were the anything-goes days of cartoons, where characters were exaggerated, inanimate objects sprang to life, and music was a major theme.  And while their humble antics paled next to the more-polished efforts of Disney or other major studios, these rough-and-tumble little gems have a unique charm that really sets them apart.

It is also unlikely that better prints will ever surface, so place your order now and support this labor of love from Thunderbean.  Highly recommended.",1268611200,15,1221,4.753554502369668
8380268,5,B002TJR92M,"These are black and white cartoons that are fun and naively un-PC. They are genuinely ""anything can happen"" cartoons - which is what cartoons should be.

A well packaged set with informative extras. A bargain.",1260748800,7,209,4.9714285714285715
8380269,5,B002TJR92M,"I received ""The Complete Animated Adventures of Van Beuren Studio's
TOM AND JERRY"" animated films on DVD and was thrilled, it is a real
treasure. These cartoons are a great example of rubber-hose-arms-and-legs animation, an excellent study for all cartoonists and
animators everywhere. It shows animation can have great storyplots
and music added together with simplicity and imagination and lots
of whimsy. Original films like ""WOT A NIGHT"" and ""ROCKETEERS"" and
""PIANO TUNERS"" and ""PENCIL MANIA"" and ""TIGHT ROPE TRICKS"" and
""JOINT WIPERS"" and ""POTS AND PANS"" is tops human TOM & JERRY
animation at its most excellent. Viewing this is great for school
teaching of animation, for inspiration of making animation yourself, and can show you more information than a dozen animation
books put together. Make effort to get this DVD, or you will forever regret it.----- Cartoonist Luisa Felix, Hoboken, New Jersey.",1260403200,9,907,5.305555555555555
