4482619,4,B004VI8LF8,"Not a perfect film, but kept my interest. Good chemistry between the two leads and interesting backdrop of class differences, immigrant experiences, and victimization of young women in Argentina. While the lead characters are two young women in love, this is treated in a matter of fact way, rather than as the central point of the film. Stylish and engaging. Well worth watching.",1312761600,16,380,5.0476190476190474

8443393,5,B004VI8LF8,A very nice movie about Love and what some people are willing to go through for the Love they have for another. It was very entertaining. Kept me hoping the two in Love would make everything workout in the end where they would be Happy and be together. If you enjoy a story about Love you will like this movie.,1397347200,,310,4.183333333333334

8443395,4,B004VI8LF8,This was well written. I wanted to fast forward to the end so I could know what happened. This was a great love story that dealt with a great deal of issues. People do crazy things for love and these two definitely did.,1347235200,,219,4.116279069767442
8443396,5,B004VI8LF8,"people looking for a happy lovey dovey movie will probably be disappointed with this film but i thought this movie was fantastic!  if you don't like reading subtitles, this movie isn't for you either.  this is not your typical lesbian film about two girls who meet, fall in love, and live happily every after.  the lead ladies are already in an established complex relationship and carries on as such.  the movie starts out after a crime has been committed but does not follow the events that lead to the crime in a chronological order.  so you have to pay attention. there are parts of this movie that was powerful and yet disturbing.  the acting is phenomenal.  a must see!",1332806400,7,675,4.621848739495798
8443397,4,B004VI8LF8,"It was a little slow and there were parts that I wish were better developed like the relationship between lala's father and the other girl (forgot her name), it starts off with the present and goes back to the past to tell the story of how it got to where the movie started off so you have to really pay attention or you will be lost.",1320969600,5,334,4.075757575757576
8443398,4,B004VI8LF8,"I actually really enjoyed the movie enough so that I am ordering the book. Many layers of exsistence play out in this movie,and it's this layering that gives it the flavors. There are some disturbing faucets to this film but these are events based from real lfe experiences. The end though is similar to the ending of The Wildside with Anne heche,Joan Chen and Chritopher Walken. Overall I thought a very good movie.",1314057600,7,416,4.712328767123288
