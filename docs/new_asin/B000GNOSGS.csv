2615587,5,B000GNOSGS,"The Devil and Daniel Johnston

Reviewed by Steve Fesenmaier Sept. 21, 2006

I finally saw the last of three major films made last year about someone from West Virginia. I wrote in this column that the WVIFF should show them - ""Dear Wendy,""

""The Heart is Deceitful Above All Else,"" and ""The Devil and Daniel Johnston."" As far as I know, none of the three films have been shown anywhere in the state.

Daniel Johnston grew up in the northern panhandle of WV, near Chester and New Cumberland. He also spent time in Weston State Hospital. I was contacted by the director of use of the facility, and referred him to Pam Haynes at the WV Film Office. I also told him that Ralph Coon had used the facility when he filmed ""Whispers from Space"" about UFO expert Gray Barker. I wondered how the place was shown in this film.

The scenes in Weston are extremely poignant because the film has audiotapes of Johnston talking about his experiences there including his obsession to write a song on Mountain Dew.

I kept thinking of Robert Gates' great film about Michael Weber, ""Communication from Weber"" which is about a similar man with extreme mental problems. In the case of Weber, he died from brain cancer. In Johnston's case, he is still alive and apparently doing better now that he lives with his parents in rural Texas. Johnston moved to Austin, Texas while he worked for a traveling circus, actually ending up on the streets as a homeless person. It was while living in Austin and working at a McDonald's that he first became a legendary underground musician.

He won a songwriting contest that included many ""normal musicians."" The film states that more than 150 artists have sung his songs including many well-known ones. I myself did not enjoy most of the songs he sings, finally enjoying the last song as the credits rolled. I always wondered if his supposed musical friends were just exploiting him as a freak, or genuinely enjoyed his strange, poorly played and song music.

Besides constantly thinking of Michael Weber, I also recalled several films by the reigning genius of American documentary, Errol Morris. His films, especially ""Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control"" and ""Dr. Death"" reminds me a lot of this film about a madman who stills does interesting things.

Johnston is also a well-known outsider artist and made the cover of the NY Times Art Section recently for his work at the Whitney Museum in NYC. Curb Cobain made Johnston's art famous when he wore one of this t-shirts on TV and during his performances. He definitely has the ability to create disturbing, unique images and he is shown selling out at an Austin art show even before it opened.

Besides Weber, other WV nutcases made famous recently including the departed Hasil Adkins and Jesco White of ""Dancing Outlaw"" fame as well as The Amazing Delores who shared her obsession with angels and demons with Johnston. We all know from the WVPBS series, ""A Different Drummer"" that there are many eccentric geniuses living in The Mountain State.

Besides showing Weston State Hospital, the film shows several bridges with ""Welcome to West Virginia"" signs. I enjoyed seeing those since I have driven back to WV from trips west, finding real comfort in finally crossing the river back home.

All mental health professionals should see this film. Watching a man's life that desperately needed good psychiatric help but failed to get it for decades is revealing. I wrote my MA thesis for library science on ""Cinema Anti-Therapy - the films of Dusan Makavejev, Werner Herzog and Les Blank."" The idea is that people with severe mental problems need understanding, not harmful manipulation, and some films will help show how understanding can go a long way to providing help. This film is definitely a prime example of this thesis.

The DVD of this film may have the best extras of any film I have seen to date. Indeed, one of the most poignant scenes is shown as an extra. It shows Johnston finally meeting the love of his life, the object of hundreds of his songs, decades latter. She notes that she had never seen the film footage that he took of her until the making of the film. Here are the extras on the DVD -

# Deleted Scenes

This profile is Mr. Johnston is highly recommended. The film techniques are first class and hopefully all of our state's many filmmakers will watch it and study its A+ art. I doubt if WV's filmmakers will find many other subjects who have documented with film and audio tracks so much of their crazy lives, but if they have, and they have become other mad geniuses around the world, I hope to see more films like this one. I also hope that Robert Gates will transfer his 16-mm film ""Communication to Weber"" to DVD so that more people can see it.

2615588,5,B000GNOSGS,"Iconoclastic musician Daniel Johnston's life story is a documentary filmmaker's wet dream-a tragicomic Grimm's fairy tale version of the American Success Story that plays like a cross between ""Dig!"" and ""The Grey Gardens"". Johnston's prolific self-produced and self-promoted mid-80's basement tapes were famously championed by Kurt Cobain in the early 90's, helping make the previously obscure artist a ""household name"" of sorts in underground music circles. From an early age (and to this day) Johnston appears to have suffered that all-too-familiar balancing act between musical genius and congenital madness that has haunted the likes of Brian Wilson, Syd Barrett, Roky Erickson and Joe Meek before him. The filmmakers weave a compelling tale with a series of almost apocryphal stories about how Johnston, like Chance the Gardener in ""Being There"", stumbles innocently and repeatedly into the Right Place At The Right Time, slowly building a word-of-mouth cult following until an ill-advised tryst with hallucinogenic substances sends him (quite literally) spiralling into complete madness when, believing himself to be Casper the Friendly Ghost, he crashes a private plane after wresting the controls from his father. The story becomes even more surreal, as Johnston is finally ""discovered"" by the major labels, who engage in a bidding war while thier potential client is still recovering in a mental ward. The rest, as they say, is History. The film also briefly examines Johnston's drawings and paintings, which strangely recall the work of Henry Darger (recently the subject of an equally fascinating documentary called ""In The Realms Of The Unreal""). By turns disturbing, funny, sad and inspiring, this one is a must see for music fans. The DVD includes a plethora of extras sure to please the artist's more hardcore followers.",1158710400,2,1835,5.442105263157894

Daniel Johnston

One of the most wonderful things about being alive is; you learn something new everyday.  Entire worlds exist out there that you have no clue about one day, and the next, you kind find yourself entrenched, imbedded, absorbed and overwhelmed within its confines.  Such is the situation you may find yourself in after experiencing THE DEVIL AND DANIEL JOHNSTON, one of the most heartfelt, absorbing and amazing documentaries I have ever seen.  Since seeing it, I have entered the world of Daniel Johnston and have a feeling I may never truly leave.

I was first drawn to this film by an image...a full-page ad for the movie in The Village Voice.  It consisted of a primitively drawn cartoon showing a singer, guitar in hand, with his head sliced open to the elements in a clean circular cut, burst of air shooting out, performing in the center of a crowd filled with similar head-sliced-open look-alikes, all watching his performance, arms raised in concert-goer glee.  Little did I know that this startling graphic screaming at me would be the first of many hundreds of like-minded images that would dance before my eyes, mind and heart (not to mention my ears) in wondrous, magical ways I almost forgot where possible.

The quizzy lay before me, begging an answer. ""Who in the hell is this Daniel Johnston?"" If you are like me, by the time you find out, your perceptions may never be the same about all the ingredients that constitute art, life, love, heaven, hell, right, wrong and...madness.

THE DEVIL AND DANIEL JOHNSTON tells the true story of a man who is filled with so much joy, so much life, so much talent, so much energy, so much unbridled creative spark and imagination...that he literally and figuratively loses his mind trying to share it all with us. The process and the pain involved in his need to express his feelings are so intense, dangerous and utterly devastating, that his very life and sanity must always be in a state of flux in order for us, his audience, to receive the blessings and gifts of his immense genius.

Sound familiar? Think Van Gogh. Think Plath. Think Morrison. Think Kerouac. Think Cobain. Think tortured artist...and you're there.

There is no denying that the connections between art, genius and mental illness have always been there...always been fascinating...but never been fully explained or understood.  Let's face it, try as we might, no one, be they relative, lover, scientist or doctor, can ever be inside these people as they go through the process that leads to their creations.  What truly makes those synapses fire is still a mystery.  It is the mystery that makes them fascinating.  We can now add Daniel Johnston to the list.

When Daniel was a young boy, his folks knew right away that he was ""different.""  This difference manifested itself in all kinds of artistic endeavors bursting with creativity; like making short Super 8 films, learning, writing and playing music, drawing and performing.  Daniel, like so many great artists, began his journey by absorbing all that he loved (The Beatles, Cartoons, Comic Books) and then finding ways to regurgitate it out in a form he could call his own.  His folks actually worried about what Daniel would contribute to society since he seemed more obsessed with his creative projects than he was with school, church, or chores.  For some teenagers, this is a normal path that leads to growth in other areas. For Daniel, it was his M.O. 24/7 365. In short, it was his life.

What neither Daniel nor his parents knew was that a horrible genetic tick, bi-polar disorder, would eventually rear its ugly head and cause Daniel, his family, and his friends...to truly suffer for his art.

THE DEVIL AND DANIEL JOHNSTON is the story of Daniel's artistic journey through creative joy and madness.  Through a combination of current footage, vintage performances, home movies, and dozens of recorded audiotapes from Daniel's life, director Jeff Feuerzeig brilliantly allows us to become enmeshed in Daniel's inner and outer world.  A world where one is perpetually exposed to the brilliant ramblings of man/child in a state of wonder about it all.  I just cannot begin to tell you how struck I was by this film and its subject.  The fact that I had never heard of him before makes me wonder about all the other fabulous things out there that I'm totally clueless of.

What is so striking...so beautiful...is the purity of Daniel's creative soul.  As much as he wants to ""be famous"" he goes about it in a way that under normal circumstances would never have seen the light of a mass audience. For many years, he used to perform his songs by recording them live on to a little cassette recorder (what they call ""low-fi"" recording) and then he'd hand out his ""albums"" to just about everyone he met.  The melodies, lyrics and exuberant performances on these cassettes are so touching and heartfelt, that you will ache with melancholy and wonder as you listen.  Daniel's songs...from unrequited love ballads to life-affirming statements of pure joy are undeniably works of genius. It is beyond stupefying that these mini-masterpieces are being created by this kid alone in his room or garage with a little cassette recorder, accompanied by primitive chord organ, piano or guitar playing...and all while he slowly is going mad.

In the mid-eighties, by a combination of luck and determination, Daniel found himself in the right place at the right time and received some exposure on MTV's The Cutting Edge.  It was here that he tasted his first bite of success and recognition.  It was also here that he began his descent. We see Daniel go from a thin, spunky kid to an overweight (he became HUGE) gray-haired, older beyond his years, medically challenged, bi-polar mess.  The contrast is striking.

The film is peppered with testimony from supportive friends (each with fascinating Daniel stories to tell) and his loving parents, brother and sisters, which allows us to get a glimpse of what it must be like to have one such as Daniel in your midst. While his personal history makes for a fascinating story, it is Daniel's art...comprised of his poetic songs and his drawings that tell their own fascinating story. A story that is both a heartbreaking statement about the sorrows of mental illness and a triumphant celebration of how obstacles, no matter how difficult, can be overcome.

Now in his mid 40s, Daniel Johnston still struggles with his demons, but thanks to better medication, he is now able to be out and about much more often, traveling, and performing. He is also actively producing international exhibits where he continues to sell his vibrant and intimate sketches.

He is a beloved cult figure, whose work is recognized for its brilliance by some of the most well-know artists of our time. (Author's Note: What is truly striking is when you hear his work performed by other artists. I did this by downloading the album THE LATE GREAT DANIEL JOHNSTON off itunes, where you get to hear both Daniel's original versions of his songs and the covered versions. I highly HIGHLY recommend doing this!) He has recorded over ten full length albums, and his supporters have included Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain, who was often seen wearing a Daniel Johnston t shirt, Matt Groening, The Butthole Suffers, Sonic Youth, noted Minutemen/FIREHOSE bassist Mike Watt, David Bowie, Tom Waits, Beck, The Flaming Lips, and, hopefully do to this film, an ever-growing international audience.

From kid in his room singing alone into a cassette player, to renowned artist whose expressions have earned him worldwide recognition and critical praise, the story of Daniel Johnston is one that will move you in ways you never thought possible and open up entire new avenues of joy and wonder as you discover more and more about him and his unique world.

And to think, a few weeks ago, I'd never even heard of the guy.  Isn't life wonderful?",1154649600,25,8051,4.886113152094048
2615591,5,B000GNOSGS,"I saw this film early last spring and have been perplexed why it never showed up on Amazon's list of movies that were appearing in theaters.  I found this frustrating because this is one of my favorite movies of 2006 so far and one of my favorite documentaries concerning a musical figure.

Daniel Johnston is widely known as one of the great untutored songwriters in America, extremely raw and unsophisticated while compelling and original at the same time.  He is also known as an artist who has had to struggle for most of his adult life with severe mental illness.  No documentary ever made allows such access to a person's psyche as this one does.  Why?  Beginning as a young teen Johnston began recording his own life on video and tape.  There are literally thousands of cassettes that provide an unprecedented portrait of Johnston.  He not only recorded his own thoughts, but would secretly tape conversations with others.  It is entirely possible that we have a larger record of Johnston's life than any other public person.  Drawing on these vast materials and given complete access to them by Johnston and his parents, director Jeff Feuerzeig has assembled a comprehensive, compassionate, yet disturbing portrait of a fascinating individual.  The opening credits display these disturbing words by Johnston:  ""There is a devil, and he knows my name.""

The film tells Johnston's story from his early teens to his move to Austin, Texas in his early twenties where he suffered his first mental breakdown, on to adulthood and his ongoing struggle with severe mental illness.  Although he quotes his own conditions from an earlier edition of the DSM, Johnston seems to struggle with a number of psychological problems, including severe bipolarity, narcissism, and schizophrenia.  He was raised in a strongly religious fundamentalist household, but while the strong religiosity found there helped shape the nature of his future mental problems (he constantly frames the world in demonic terms, as a struggle between God and the devil), they do not seem to be the direct cause.  Whatever propensities he had as a teen were brought to the surface by heavy drug use while in Austin, Texas.  He has never really been healthy since that first breakdown, though he has often been able to record and perform.

Throughout the narrative of his life are snippets from various cassettes.  He truly has provided the soundtrack of his own life.  For instance, in an ill-fated trip to New York to record with the aide of members of Sonic Youth he was arrested for defacing the Statue of Liberty with religious symbols.  He was secretly taping this as well as arguments he had with people while walking on sidewalks in New York.  There is a ""You are there"" feeling with this film quite unlike anything else I've ever seen.  The film recounts many harrowing incidents in his life, none scarier than the time after appearing at the South by Southwest festival in Austin when he seized the controls of his father's plane and sent it into an uncontrolled dive.  His father was able to regain control of the plane only at the last second to enable a controlled crash landing in a forest.  Miraculously, they escaped with only minor injuries.

The film details Johnston's emergence as an alternative rock icon, helped in large part by Kurt Cobain's constant wearing of a Johnston T-shirt over the last few years of his life.  People have continued to discover his music, though it must be confessed that it is very much an acquired taste.  Johnston is at best amateurish in both his guitar playing and keyboard work, and his singing is raw and unpolished.  The songs themselves are primitive and sometimes feel unfinished.  Nonetheless, there is an undeniable appeal in many of the songs, and emotional honesty that is bereft of artifice.  Many will prefer the raw recordings by Johnston himself, though some might like more the versions of his songs recorded by his friend (and very briefly girlfriend) Kathy McCarty, DEAD DOG'S EYEBALL:  THE SONGS OF DANIEL JOHNSTON.  She appears prominently in the documentary and remains a part of his life, having married his oldest friend.

Overall the tone of the film is somewhat despondent tempered with hope.  Johnston, though irredeemably self-obsessed, is oddly likable.  And all in all, one can't help but think that given the severity of his problems, his life has turned out better than perhaps anyone else in his condition.  His parents, though he criticized them for their religious obsessions early in his life, are unquestionably profoundly caring.  Instead of having Daniel in an institution, they have cared for him themselves, forcing him to take his meds and enabling him to have a rich if demanding life.  Unfortunately, they are both around eighty and there is great concern for what will happen to Johnston as they age.  Although Johnston is best known as a musician, he has never made much money through his music.  He has, however, established quite a reputation as an untutored artist, and his drawings now fetch substantial amounts of money.  His parents have been putting the money into a trust fund for him.  Their goal has been to provide him with a house and sufficient funds to pay for nursing care for the remainder of his life.  As long as he takes his very large number of meds he is semi-functional.  Thanks to his art, it now appears that there will be enough money to take care of his needs.

Although I saw this in the theater I am very much looking forward to getting the DVD.  Many of Johnston's songs deal with love and heartbreak, and most of these concern a woman he met in college and fell hopelessly in love with.  This was, however, an unrequited love, but it nevertheless provided the impetus for his songwriting.  In an interview with the director following the preview, Feuerzeig revealed that after one of Johnston's concerts he saw her for the first time in over twenty years.  They caught this on tape and it will appear as an extra on the DVD.

I give this disc my strongest possible recommendation.  You will never see a documentary that delves so deeply into one person's life as does this one.  As sad and disturbing as most of it is, it nonetheless ends as happily as it is possible for someone with the world of troubles afflicting Johnston.",1152662400,78,6319,4.851540616246498

2615606,5,B000GNOSGS,"Had somehow read about this almost by accident today, had vaguely heard
of Daniel Johnston's music years ago, I'm sure I saw him back in 1985 on IRS
The Cutting Edge on MTV, since I watched that show religiously at the time,
but I haven't yet caught up with his albums, but I shall, in any case, my library
gracious had this in their vast collection, so screened this and most extras
tonight.  A very moving experience by turns touching, moving, hilarious, and
terrifying and wrenching.  I put this film and the fabulous DVD of it, right up there
with the documentary on Roky Erickson from several years ago, both equally
worthy of their subjects, and each one's life and music and triumphs over
illness and all sorts of things.  Whoever said this film was ""staged"" doesn't
know what they're on about, it's clearly not.

Look, I'm going to say right now that the mental health system in the good ol'
USA (or anywhere) is a broken evil nightmare.  And the justice system and courts
are even worse.  They don't care about you as Gary Null would say on his
Pacifica radio show, and has often of late, and they'd sooner have you a zombie
or 6 feet under.  You can take that to the bank. Sometimes medication is
great for certain people, and sometimes it makes them feel deathly ill and
like zombies, and sometimes the MDs don't even know what they're doing and
misdiagnose people and mis-prescribe meds, and worse. My advice would be
to, if you can, stay far away from all of that as possible, if possible. Thank God Daniel has has
friends and family and particularly his parents, and fans, to have helped him
through his own travails and nightmares and out the other side to where he
is now.  Same goes for Roky Erickson, who I caught live in concert a couple
of years ago in Brooklyn at Southpaw and it was a great show, with the Fleshtones
and Peter Zaremba, ironically, opening!  I'd also briefly met Maureen Tucker of the Velvets after
one of her shows in NYC back around 1998 or so, at the Knitting Factory (which
is now in Brooklyn rather than downtown Manhattan), so it was great to see
that she'd also worked with Daniel at a certain point, apparently.  I could be wrong
but I think a joint tour of Daniel with Roky Erickson would rock!  After hearing some
of Daniel's songs like ""True Love Will Find You In The End"", I kept thinking of something
like Erickson's masterpiece ""True Love Cast Out All Evil,"" which is on the Erickson box
set as well as re-recorded for his last studio CD a couple of years ago.  And hey,
they're both in Texas!  I also loved Daniel's art and drawings/paintings/comics:
that flying eyeball reminds me for some reason of Lovecraft's classic horror story
The Haunter of the Dark, with its final fatal appearance dispatching Robert Blake (Robert
Bloch?) by an ""avatar of Nyarlathotep"" (his dark God of the Cthulhu Mythos) and its flying ""three lobed burning eye"", etc.
Not a three eyed burning lobe, a THREE LOBED BURNING EYE!!!"" Lets get that straight.

Anyway, will be catching up soon with Daniel's music and art, this film demonstrated
that I need to come up to speed with him and his work.  Not immersed enough yet
in Johnston's music to comment much further, but this film and DVD are just
amazing, and well worth seeking out and screening it all. I often go by sheer instinct
on tracking down new films like this that I might've overlooked, and often have since
most of these documentaries and indie features don't play on LI NY where I live,
some do, most in NYC if at all, and often for very brief engagements these days,
so, I find I have to do extra homework these days to catch up with certain works,
and this was clearly a key one.  Very glad I did, I agree with another reviewer

It would have been nice had the director instead of playing a Johnston song in the background with interviews if he just complimented the content with Johnston playing live.  I give it five stars because I'm a huge Johnston fan, if you are unaware of his work or just interested it's probably three stars.  The content though is interesting even if you are not a fan because it brings light to the very under discussed mental health awareness so over looked in prior generations.  Daniel Johnston is a love it or leave it songwriter.  Whether you love it or leave it his impact on many of the musicians you love is apparent in this film and the insight it provides from a mental health prospective is gold (including how religion and strict upbringing has made a huge impact on Johnstons mental health).

2615619,5,B000GNOSGS,"Another great independent film covering one of a multitude of great topics (deliberately?) overlooked by the mainstream movie moguls.

I think two great sub-plots make this movie a must-see.  One is a very strange but true tale that includes a rather unique explanation for (then) recent historical events.  The other is a heart-warming tale of loyalty about a very unlikely source for heart-warming tales of loyalty.

The first is the true account of account of Johnston as a human canary in a coal mine detecting not coal gas, but foul spiritual ether.  Johnston spins himself into insanity while simultaneously sounding a strange and ominous warning again and again: The Devil is coming!  The Devil is coming!  Most dismiss Johnstons bizarre behavior as merely the primary psychotic break that signaled his descent into madness, and the death-knell of his once extremely promising career.  But could it have been something else?  In eerie Close Encounter fashion, Johnston begins repetitively cutting out the same peculiar shape that matched the symbol of the Devils return burnt into his damaged mind.  One day, while watching the news on TV, Johnston sees the same exact symbol on the news that he had subconsciously been driven to obsessively reproduce again and again.  It was the now infamous (but largely conveniently forgotten) stylistic letter E for the criminal energy conglomerate Enron.  Almost as interesting was Enrons response to Johnstons letter telling them that he knew they were of the Devil.  Instead of taking the Procter and Gamble approach to defamatory Satan-association by threatening to crush him with a libel lawsuit, the boys at Enron responded with a Yeahwhat are you going to do about it? attitude in their written response to Johnston.

The second sub-plot runs concurrently throughout Dan Johnstons tragic tale: the strange undying loyalty of Johnstons music agent.  Johnstons agent remains supportive of Johnston throughout his ordeal, never stops believing in him, and never stops promoting his music long after any other talent agent would have thrown him under the bus.

The movie not only documents yet another great poet/musician lost to the horror of mental illness and a society that throws them on the trash-pile, but possibly one whose sensitive artist psyche made him more prone to see things that others couldnt.  And maybe Johnstons sensitive brain was ravaged by a reality it simply couldn't contain.

2615633,1,B000GNOSGS,"I don't know which was more unbearable-- listening to Daniel Johnston's insufferable music, or listening to the insufferable Austin hipster crowd praising his music.

The latter, I think. The usual stupid hipster conceit of shocking-the-bourgeoisie with incomprehensibly bad art. In one clip, Hipster A praises the musical genius of the pathetically untalented Daniel Johnston; in a later clip, same hipster unwittingly gives away the game by breezily mentioning how understandable it was was when the musical community howled in disapproval when Johnston won some sort of critical honor in a magazine. If his genius is so very apparent, Hipster A, why should anyone cry foul when he's praised by the music intelligentsia? (Hipster A, of course, likes to think that only a few perceptive individuals --such as himself-- are capable of understanding such lofty, hard-to-fathom art. Hans Christian Anderson recorded the phenomenon 170 years ago in The Emperor's New Clothes.)

It's telling that when Johnston finally got a big record deal, his record sold about 500 copies. Even the hipsters don't really want to listen to the stuff in the privacy of their own rooms, where no one can admire them for their outre taste.

Daniel Johnston also makes for a good Hipster icon because of his mental instability. As all good hopeless-romantics know, genius & insanity are inseparable, practically the same thing. When the two concepts become virtually synonymous, we can leapfrog all the hard work required of genuine creativity just by emulating insanity, since that's so much more easily accomplished.

This was a worthwhile documentary not for its musical content, but as a sociological study of the late 20th century hipster.",1290211200,8,1721,5.293040293040293
2615634,3,B000GNOSGS,"Daniel Johnston obviously has fans - and so does The Devil and Daniel Johnston - a documentary about Johnston's art and his life. I watched the film and I liked it. But my enthusiasm for the film is - at best - lukewarm due to my dislike of Johnston's music.

The film is strongest when it discusses Johnston's early years and his personal struggles. He grew up in a small town in West Virginia in a fundamentalist-Christian family. Daniel's family did not know what to do with their artistic son. At an early age, Johnston began make video and audio recordings and the filmmakers use those tapes to great effect in the film.

As an adult, Johnston drifted around the U.S. and eventually landed in Austin, Texas. Austin's thriving music scene and large bohemian population seemed to be an ideal fit for Daniel. Unfortunately, Johnston soon developed bipolar disorder and he has spent large parts of his life in institutions.

The tales of Johnson's illness are sad. The documentary includes an amazing audiotape that Johnson made after he got caught repeatedly drawing the Christian fish symbol on the Statue of Liberty. The viewer particularly feels for Johnston's elderly parents who still take care of him and despair that he will ever lead an independent life.

Johnston's music has legions of fans, including some of the biggest names in the music industry. His music simply isn't my cup of tea. My wife and I watched the film together and we could not believe that people raved about Johnston's tuneless, simplistic songs and off-key vocals. Of course, that's just our opinion - each viewer will have to decide what to make of Johnston's music.

I still recommend The Devil and Daniel Johnston, but I came away from the film with a sad feeling. Clearly, Johnston walks a lonely, troubled road through life.",1289520000,2,1812,4.832258064516129
2615635,1,B000GNOSGS,"This film succeeds at portraying Daniel's mental illness -- specifically bipolar disorder (which borders toward the end of the film on schizoaffective or schizophrenia) -- and what happens when you idolize and encourage a manic person to ""keep going.""  Daniel is manic, grandiose, delusional, scared, unsafe, etc. And the more shows he plays at and the more deals he signs and the more drawings he draws and the more people who ask for his autograph and the more people who idolize him through this film, the sicker he gets. I'm surprised that pop culture hasn't killed him already, from barely eating or sleeping, not drinking water, not taking his medication, being so delusional and afraid that he wrecked an airplane...these are not just artistic concepts that are interesting to study. They are physiological human needs.

I don't care what others think about Daniel's music or drawings. I am glad that some people genuinely enjoy them, and I would hope that they felt empathy when they listened. I do care about what I feel is a cruel, exploitative group of people surrounding this guy. His manager seems almost more sick than he is, and anyone who ""gets"" this illness should know better than to encourage someone to make himself THIS SICK for your entertainment. Wow.

I'm actually MOST interested in why the hell this poor guy has been made into some hipster cult icon.

2615639,4,B000GNOSGS,"Daniel Johnston is never going to be a big name.  Most people will only hear of him through Kurt Cobain and/ or Sonic Youth endorsements.  Many of these people will pretend to like Johnston, or will actually like him, but more for the story.  And Daniel Johnston's is a story like none other, and this is the most fitting documentary of his story.

I was trying to explain to my wife what, exactly, made Daniel Johnston a great talent.  Sure, he's obsessive and prolific.  But to many, the songs are still unlistenable.  The best way I can explain it is that the songwriting is strong, even though the singing/ guitar playing is not.  He is, however, a strong piano player.

Anyhow, this documentary will have you laugh and it has the potential to move you to tears be it from the oft sad occurences, his father's tear-jerking remembrances, or the uncertain fate of an American eccentric who is so dependent on other people.

Are the Brian Wilson references warrented?  Yes.  But Daniel Johnston is a budgeted, masking-tape Wilson.  This documentary shows that, no matter what the odds, the situation, Daniel will always persue art in one form or another (be it cartoon, paint, music, film, etc.)

2615640,5,B000GNOSGS,"When I started watching this, I didn't really know much about it.  I vaguely remember seeing a trailer for it awhile ago, but that's all.  However, as the film progressed and more music samples were played, I realized that the documentary's subject, the creative but troubled Daniel Johnston, was the same Daniel Johnston who did a song that I've liked ever since high school, a song that still--over ten years later--has a place of honor on my ipod.  I just never realized that the person who did that lovely ditty was a severely afflicted manic-depressive who hung out with the likes of Sonic Youth and the Butthole Surfers.  His story is as amazing as it is depressing.  In particular, listening to his ever-patient parents recall disturbing stories of increasingly erratic behavior as his illness progressed is absolutely heartbreaking.  I think one of the aspects of the film that most resonated with me was the seemingly unconditional love they felt for a son they easily could have had institutionalized and made less burdensome to their lives.  So in that sense, at least, the film does impart a more optimistic sense of filial happiness and is a testament to the strong emotional bonds between parent and child.  Moreover, the documentary also serves as a showcase for Johnston's music which really does deserve a wider audience.  His music and his singing voice aren't really conventional by any means, but his songs are absolutely sincere and that's more than I can say for most popular artists who are making music today.",1205625600,16,1533,4.933852140077821
2615641,4,B000GNOSGS,"This is an award winning 2005 documentary that focuses on the art of Daniel Johnston.  I was first introduced to Daniel Johnston's work in the early 90s after his album cover for ""Hi, How are You?"" appeared on Kurt Cobain's tee-shirt.  I was in High School and Nirvana was one of my favorite bands.  This documentary actually covers that same discovery and evidently I wasn't the only one who came upon Johnston's work in this way.  Overall, I don't think he's Bob Dylan or Neil Young but his lyrics are incredibly unique and in my humble opinion much of his earlier work is bordering on genius.  As it turns out his visual art is also appreciated and that is covered here as well.  This documentary covers pretty much his whole life and the few times his work has flirted with mainstream recognition.

Daniel sang with a bizarre and casual boy-like high voice that was vulnerable, raw, and consistently uncertain.  He sang these unusual and seemingly uninfluenced lyrics that came from nowhere.  Like many great singer songwriters his music makes it plainly obvious that a song is better delivered from the voice that wrote it.  He sings lyrics that don't seem to make sense but he means it, so they have to at least makes sense to him, right?  His music is definitely not for everyone and many will wonder how this man gained any recognition whatsoever.  If you enjoy Daniel's music and put him on a level most will not understand then I'd also like to recommend Jeffrey Lewis in addition to Daniel's early work.  Some of Nick Drake's emptier later work is comparable to Daniel as well.

But enough about all of that, this is a review of a documentary.  As a documentary the film is very well done.  I can't think of anything it covered that it really didn't need to, nor can I think of anything that it didn't cover that it should have.  Except for maybe the reunion that Daniel has with his muse (a wonderful extra on the DVD itself).  Daniel basically fell into the music scene from obscurity due to a cult following and then we see him develop from an inspired and unique artist to a chubby and awkward manic depressive.  You get the idea that he had some success based on his exceptional character and general way of thinking but that he lost his mind forever after taking some hallucinogenic drugs.  I'm certainly not pretending to be an authority on the subject but having worked in a mental facility as well as watching my best friend fall apart in the same way that Daniel did, I have to say that this seemed completely likely and understandable to me.  It seemed like the template was there for him to go crazy and after it happened it destroyed his future and his relationships with almost everyone around him.  It is both an extremely sad story and incredibly interesting at the same time.

We almost begin to get an understanding of how songs like ""Casper the Friendly Ghost"" or ""True Love Will Find You in the End"" developed in a mentally ill mind, yet still managed to draw a listener's interest.  Fundamentally he had a way of expressing himself like so few, but when expressing himself became more and more challenging it can peak only the interest of those few who still strive to understand what the artist is feeling.  The whole Daniel Johnston package is interesting to me and this film puts it in an honest enough frame to enhance that interest further.  I would highly recommend it.",1192406400,5,3407,4.599337748344371
2615642,3,B000GNOSGS,"Somewhere in the last two decades, films about rock became indistinguishable from documentaries made for public television, and that is no compliment. Perhaps the music described lacked quality, or the subjects portrayed weren't terribly compelling. Where the crying need for amanuenses, explicators, authorities, critics, chroniclers, narrators and the talking heads all saying so little has arisen is a mystery, but it nauseates. One often longs for a return to the time where the film stock furnished all the explanation necessary...Pennebaker or the Maysles for example. However, the many reels of paid footage, expertly shot, are lacking in surveys of the Ramones, of Johnston, of garageland and Geek USA. In their place we have interlocutors---armchair historians guiding us through a story like any D-Day skirmish, peppered liberally with first-hand accounts from the I-Was-Theres.

Jeff Feuerzeig himself has a solid track record, having worked in videos and documentaries for years. He directed the film Half-Japanese: The Band That Would Be King and incidentally produced one of the best records of the 90's: a haunting, mysterious debut by the young Lys Guillorn, long unreleased, that was also the late Robert Quine's last session. He wrote and produced an incisive work on the jazz vocalese master Jon Hendricks. Feuerzeig's not the problem; Daniel Johnston is. Devil is an honorable attempt at conveying him.

In the early 80's, Austin had no train station. Its main stop was just a small Amtrak kiosk unlike the majestic structures of San Antonio, Dallas and Houston, and lacking their forbidding scale. The capital was distinct from the rest of Texas cities, filled with individuals matching another definition of Texan: cool, contemplative, bohemian, often sporting large eyewear. This was the Texas Daniel Johnston found and, as an outsider, would help define.

The ""outsider"" term, as cast by the Chusids of the music world, is fraught with problems, prone to ugly myths collapsing in on themselves. Since The Devil and Daniel Johnston focuses far more on his music than his art, we find Austin's affectionate embrace of the Savant-Makes-Good to be the picture's locus and Johnston's career high point.  His unraveling, and the long dispassionate account of it, forms the substance of this disturbing film.

Johnston is no genius, far from it. His work is marked by simplistic repetitions and formal gimmicks. Musically, for all the manic volume of output, his yield is meager. He has a number of lovely songs, of brutally forthright compositions--""Fate Will Get Done"" and ""Walking the Cow"" are fine contradictory examples--but there remain ""outsider"" artists, before him and since, possessed of the ability to truly destroy worlds. Of late the resurgence of interest in the incendiary force of nature that is Ghedalia Tazartes (not a Texan, not even American, and lacking t-shirt distribution..quelle horreur) is one example of dozens. As for inspiration, there is a wide gulf between intermittent flashes and all-consuming effulgence, and I wager his legion of defenders who might make their way through a Johnston box set would be winnowed down mightily five discs or so in.

If Kurt Cobain would call Johnston ""the greatest living songwriter,"" one should recall context and the late guitarist's tireless promotion of everyone he knew...his two favorites were Shonen Knife and the Vaselines--not the least for being lovely, technically sloppy, and not American. Comparisons to Robert Johnson, however, are nothing short of idiotic. Louis Black and the other sycophants need not be detailed here.

Johnston devolves from a lovable kid with issues into an ugly manipulator early on, and his force of personality draws in so many of the bespectacled bohos and jazzbos mentioned above, Texan or otherwise--Jeff Tartakov, Steve Shelley, Jad Fair, and the truly wonderful Kathy McCarty, among so many other kind and decent people cast into the turbulence of his wake. His long-suffering parents and their testimonies are the most poignant of all. On a personal level I found Fred Wiseman's Titicut Follies less upsetting than The Devil and Daniel Johnston...the subject is a vortex...prone to eliciting contempt.",1187827200,11,4228,5.358433734939759
2615643,5,B000GNOSGS,"This film is fascinating and mind altering, not just because Daniel Johnson is creative and talented and documented his whole life with tapes and drawing, making the portrait of him even more complete and unique.  I admire him for staying with his vision no matter what.  It could be he's compelled to do so and can't stop himself, but many artists and musicians have potential == they just don't allow it to take over their entire lives. That's why Johnston creates ground-breaking work and they don't. Is it healthy?  Probably not, but I guess that's why lots of pioneering creators in the past weren't necessarily likeable or politically correct either. The film is a metaphor for every creative person who has been criticized and ostracized by friends and family -- the fact that his friends and family came to understand his genius and quirks and tolerate them and help him continue to create his art and music is inspiring.  The other side of the story is his mental illness which is sad and a challenge, but the film also shows that mental illness doesn't have to stop creative output and in many ways it inspires it.  The balancing of manic depression with staying stable enough to continue producing his material is what makes this absorbing.  Johnston is direct, open, and willing to present his dark side.  What makes him Johnston affecting is he's just himself, which is why his art and music also reaches out to people.  Those who don't understand his work are BORING and probably missing a few brain cells and chromosones, but what can ya do?! Those who throw stones are empty shells.",1187395200,,1598,4.7644927536231885
2615644,5,B000GNOSGS,"Feuerzeig's riveting, always fascinating look at this volatile, self-taught wunderkind is as heartbreaking as it is inspiring. From an early age, we discover, Johnston kept confessional audio and video diaries of his life, and the director uses these to fill out the portrait of his likably out-there subject. Surging with fire-and-brimstone paranoia inculcated from his Bible-thumping parents, Johnston is both childlike and unremittingly self-destructive--and downright fearsome when he's off his medications. Yet his music is charmingly twisted and often near-brilliant. Ultimately, ""Devil"" is a compassionate look at the addled soul of a truly gifted outsider artist.",1185321600,3,671,6.0
2615645,2,B000GNOSGS,"Viewed as a deliberately clumsy parody (a la the Rutles) of an utterly untalented version of Bob Dylan, this movie almost works as a comedy.

Seen as the story of a man attempting to overcome serious mental illness despite repeated obstacles, it's not bad, by turns poignant and grimly amusing.

As the hideously pretentious dissection of the ""undiscovered genius"" Daniel Johnston is claimed to be, this film is nothing but 110 minutes documenting the long, deliberate exploitation of a deluded, pitiful, tortured human being.  When we see him take a guitar onto the stage during a concert despite the fact that he does not know how to play, we should get it.  The concert audience doesn't--they give him a standing ovation.  When we see him on and off stage with what appear to be alcoholic beverages near at hand, and are informed that Johnston often discontinued his medications before performances ""to improve them"" (leading one to wonder about both the medications and Johnston's handler), we should get it.  And after nearly two hours of being beaten over the head with a shovel by Johnston's art (most of which resembles student notebook doodles) and his music (which only occasionally approaches garage band standards and is filled with delusional ramblings, often clearly originating with parents who tried to force fundamentalism on him), we should get it.  A lengthy concluding scene in which a medication-bloated Johnston capers in a drool-stained t-shirt to the sound of one of his own songs should get it for us.

The artist has no clothes.  How the film makers could have possibly not ""gotten it"" seems almost beyond comprehension.  In light of the significant amount of money being made by various people from Johnson's work, that they apparently do not hardly seems an innocent mistake.  One begins to wonder if promoters will start trolling the art therapy sessions at state hospitals in search of the next ""genius"" to immortalize on film.  No doubt there are others, like Johnston, who will be happy to produce, so long as their every scribbling is greeted as a work of genius.

Johnston seems a decent man, tormented by a disease of which there is far too little understanding and far too little help.  If I took anything away from this film, it is the hope that he will find peace, and that he will be, as he deserves to be, left alone, to dream the more pleasant of his demented dreams.  He has my sympathy.  The filmmakers do not.",1182470400,24,2453,4.84652278177458

He couldn't sing a note, he certainly didn't play his guitar well, and his songwriting sounds like typical mediocre teenage ramblings. Throughout the film, it's taken for granted that he's some kind of genius. At the beginning of the movie, someone introduces him as the world's greatest singer/songwriter. What an insult to millions of musicians with 100 times the talent.

The major flaw with this documentary is they don't start spilling the beans until about halfway through. So you're watching, watching, waiting to find out what's so special about this guy, and all you have is a guy who makes films, writes music and draws, and happens to be a little eccentric. So what? Unless you know the rest of the story beforehand, you're going to wonder 'why are they making a documentary about someone so unremarkable?' You'll give up, probably about 1/2 an hour into it. They tease you with hints that 'something's not right' from time to time, but it's unacceptable to wait until the latter part of the film to let you know the full story. And really, unless you're actually convinced that he has any talent, you won't really care.",1181865600,18,1363,4.702928870292887
2615647,5,B000GNOSGS,"I'm not sure if I'm in the minority of coming to this without knowing a durn thing about Daniel Johnston.  It would just seem that I am oddly attracted to stories about oddities and their own forms of genius.

But, if Ron Howard's bastardization of John Nash's story for the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Beautiful-Mind-Widescreen-Awards-Edition/dp/B00005JKQZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Beautiful Mind (Widescreen Awards Edition)</a>&nbsp;is to be taken as a model, portrayals of mad genius are often too complex to be told very easily.  The depth and manifestation of Nash's schizophrenia was grossly oversimplified and whitewashed for the sake of the Hollywood dollar (for example, I tend to think that Opie Cunningham quivered in his socks at the thought of a movie hero who explored a whole range of sexuality and fathered an illegitimate son and so conveniently left that fact out), and the Brian Wilson tale is so overtold and hackneyed that it took Barenaked Ladies to revitalize it.

When it comes to mad musical geniuses, I tend to want to experience them as directly as I can (so if you don't know the canon of Wesley Willis, score yourself&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wesley-Willis-Greatest-Hits/dp/B000000FAL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wesley Willis - Greatest Hits</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wesley-Willis-Greatest-Hits-Vol-2/dp/B00000I7R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Wesley Willis - Greatest Hits, Vol. 2""</a>&nbsp;before you crawl any further under your rock), but I saw bits of this movie on a movie channel one morning in and out of the sleep I should have been getting more regularly, and I became intrigued and so made a concerted effort to watch the whole thing through the next time it was on.

In all, this is a wonderfully deep and complex story of a manic man with a vision and more than a little obsession.  Probably the indie scene's version of Bob Dylan--an intriguing songwriter who may be served better when others are doing his songs to really bring out the best side of his inventions--Daniel Johnston's journey through madness and despair, through the abyss of unfulfillment up to what might not be necessarily regarded as the heights of the music industry, but a touching kind of calm with recognition.

Nicely handled in this documentary is the avoidance of pity and the push for pathos.  Daniel's family is loving, but obviously also somewhat befuddled and maybe even a little irritated with him, and this documentary is brave enough to allow Daniel to come off as both a sufferer and inflicter of suffering.  His existence in and out of hospitals, his manic moments of violence and recorded delusions make him both repulsive and sympathetic.

A very telling moment of the film is when a long-time supporter of Johnston's helps to have him committed, and in reflection talks about how he had been one to idealize the mad geniuses of history, yet when he had one on his hands, he wanted to be rid of him just like anyone else did.

This would seem an obvious comment to make for a documentary, but this one works on the realities of Daniel's gifts and burdens, to present the struggles of his life rather than idealize and avoid the difficult moments in favor of a streamlined yet false Ron-Howard kind of feel.  Some of Daniel Johnston's actions are scary and unnerving (just wait until you hear the tale his father can't tell without bursting into tears), and the extent of his delusions are unsettling, but to also know about the woman he pined for years for and the people who stayed with him (including his family) despite his worst or disconnected actions is touching.  And there are also moments of pure lunacy and humor too--Gibby Haynes from Butthole Surfers giving an interview while at the dentist's, for example, or Daniel Johnston's singalong concerts.

If you want to see a good and deep dive into the life of true mania and pureness of vision, pick this movie up and give it a try.  As long as you're not looking for Hollywood whitewash and are willing to accept the oddities of life, you will get out of this at least a little touched.",1181088000,7,4248,5.309985096870343
2615648,2,B000GNOSGS,"If any documentary signifies the total decline of American music more than ""The Devil and Daniel Johnston"", I haven't seen it.

Daniel Johnston is a man living with manic-depressive illness.  He is also a musician whose abilities make Anton Newcombe (Brian Jonestown Massacre) look like all four Beatles wrapped up in one.  Yet somehow, Johnston is celebrated as a reclusive genius on par with Brian Wilson, and he commands the respect and adulation of the uber-hipster elite.

The movie introduces him as ""the world's greatest singer/songwriter"".  I call him a real-life Chauncey Gardner.  I felt like I was watching a movie about a Bizarro-alternate universe, and just kept thinking of P.T. Barnum.  I wonder if there is some Barnum-type figure behind the scenes foisting this poor, sick man onto the underground suckers.

I guess if someone tells me something long enough, eventually I will come around to believe it.  There really is no difference between the person who buys a John Mayer album and the person who thinks Daniel Johnston is the new Dylan.  They've both been sold the same bill of goods, cloaked however differently.

The movie was well-done, don't get me wrong.  Hence it is bumped from one star to two.  The story was interesting, but it needed a counterbalance of someone, anyone listening to a Daniel Johnston song and then saying, ""He stinks!""  That would have provided some much-needed reality to this movie, which breathlessly (and I assume with a straight face) compares this guy to Lord Byron and Sylvia Plath.

I guess the movie did its job, because it filled me so full of rage and bile that I was compelled to write all this.  But come on!  This is the best the American underground can do?  This is the guy we're presenting to Paris, Berlin & Barcelona as the Ultimate American Original?  The man who will launch the next musical movement?  You've been HAD, Thurston Moore!  You're a S-U-C-K-E-R, Mo Tucker!

Who is this guy influencing?  A documentary filmmaker, apparently.  So Cobain wore Johnston's T-shirt a few times.  BIG DEAL!  I never heard Nirvana cover a Daniel Johnston song.  Maybe they did, but was it good enough to go on any of their albums?  Maybe they just liked the story.

I can appreciate the theme of the genius laboring in obscurity, a talent never to be truly discovered until well all after his death.  Daniel Johnston is not that talent.  He was in the right place at the right time and acted weird enough to get on MTV for like 15 minutes.  Well, then you KNOW he's good!

No, Daniel Johnston is in fact devoid of any musical talent.  Why?  Well, he can't play a musical instrument AT ALL.  The songs I heard were repetitive and broke no new ground lyrically or rhythmically.  Yet because of his past, and the fact that he is bipolar, he has instead become the ""greatest living singer/songwriter"".  Proof positive that Americans are now addicted to watching the beautiful train wreck, and that Charles Manson was born far too soon.

No, Daniel Johnston is celebrated because he is truly insane, as opposed to Britney-crazy.  Flash your crotch, shave your head, get a (gasp!) tattoo, and boom!  You're nuts, especially if you're not pumping out product.  But if you try to crash your dad's single-engine plane at 20,000 feet because you think you're Casper The Friendly Ghost, well that's taking things to a Whole New Level.

Somewhere, Barnum lurks.  This guy's the REAL DEAL!  He could MURDER YOU right before the encore!  You're MISSING OUT if you don't buy one of his Captain America doodles!  Two hundred cultural elitists from Austin and New York City can't be wrong!

The movie contains a lot of little truths, and those truths make for an interesting story.  But here is the Big Truth.  He has the musical and artistic abilities of a clever 8-year old.  Only he's in his late 40s and has bipolar illness.  Maybe I can get a documentary made about me one day.  Only I'm not on medication.

Perhaps Daniel Johston is a pure American product.  Perhaps we can reserve a new category for the CD racks called ""crazy"", and lump him in with Syd Barrett and Brian Wilson.  It would help the A&R people and the art dealers, and would help determine the marketing strategy.",1177632000,24,4228,4.755862068965517
2615649,4,B000GNOSGS,"Daniel Johnston is one of the few tortured artists who can rightfully claim that title.  His struggles to control his manic-depression (exacerbated by LSD and hallucinogenic drug use), to live independently of a well-meaning family alternately concerned with and targeted by him, and, sadly, to battle Satan, all prevented his music career from ever leaving the ground.  He had real chances to make it, too, as depicted by DADJ: a vocational embrace by members of Sonic Youth in New York, an appearance on MTV in its earliest days, and an unbelievably dedicated manager fighting in Daniel's corner (Jeff Tartakov, aptly compared by an interviewee to Woody Allen in Broadway Danny Rose).

At the very least, had circumstances worked out differently, Daniel Johnston's songwriting ability could have put him in the pantheon of great lyricists alongside Dylan (whose voice isn't much better than Johnston's, incidentally).  I know there are recordings out there of others performing Johnston's work, and I think that well will- and should- be drawn from for years to come.

I find Johnston's music is tough to listen to, frankly, even taking the lo-fi production into account.  His visual artwork is technically interesting, particularly to those interested in cartoons and literal depictions of good and evil, and belies the ease with which Johnston draws or paints it.  The man's real genius, though, lies in his exhaustive documentation of his own life, which had to have been extraordinarily challenging during his frequent descents into madness.  Document he still did, however, including tape recording his own vandalism arrest (for drawing Christian fish all over the Statue of Liberty).  Director Jeff Feuerzeig clearly pored lovingly over a wealth of this material in order to make DADJ, and skillfully edited tapes, journals, songs, interviews and paintings into this touching and reverential documentary.  Johnston's tale needed to be released to anyone interested in his music (even indirectly, as he has influenced countless popular musicians), in mental illness, or even in a good story with classic, tragic themes.

Real moments of genuine pathos are caught on film, and they're all compelling.  Daniel's father tearfully relates the time his son threw the keys from the Cessna airplane the elder Johnston was piloting, forcing a crash landing into trees.  There is a poignant reunion between Daniel and Laurie, his unrequited love and muse of hundreds of his songs, after 26 years of separation.  It is very touching, and Daniel is as serious as a heart attack when he repeatedly asks her to marry him.  There are some funny moments, too, mostly of the surreal, drug-fueled variety, but Johnston's life seems accurately portrayed as both formerly and presently painful.  [In a review for Grizzly Man, I referred to that documentary as the greatest depiction of mental illness I'd ever seen on film.  I would have to throw DADJ into the ring as a contender, particularly the scene with him talking to Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers (excerpted through the film- catch the unabridged version in the extras).  It is as tough to watch as it is fascinating.]",1173312000,4,3171,5.184313725490196

2615654,5,B000GNOSGS,"""The Devil and Daniel Johnston"" is a moving study of a singer-songwriter-musician-illustrator-artist who almost loses his career - and indeed his very life - because of manic depression.  Director Jeff Feuerzeig's sensitive documentary explores Johnston's early years with his fundamentalist Christian family through his later years as a psychotic singing storyteller hell-bent on casting out the devil in his many disguises.

This movie reveals the artist's many sides:  impetuous youth running off to join the carnival; independent filmmaker yearning to be a star, director, producer, and distributor; historian responsible for recording audiotapes of his childhood; visual artist documenting his thoughts and feelings into comic book-style drawings; idealistic performer hoping to be the next John Lennon; folk singer obsessed with heartfelt lyrics about his first-love; and psychiatric patient taking his meds, receiving his therapy, and dreaming of release.

Johnston's parents and friends provide a loving - though unflinching - look at the man through in-depth interviews with the filmmaker.  The film blends vintage performances, current footage, grainy home movies, photographs, drawings, and recorded audiotapes to present a layered look into Johnston's personal history.  His artwork, rooted deep in his childhood pain, has been displayed in galleries and museums around the world, and his music has attracted an international cult audience including Matt Groening, Sonic Youth, David Bowie, Tom Waits, and Beck.  Even so, Johnston's mental illness has prevented him from achieving the level of fame he always desired.

2615655,2,B000GNOSGS,"Like a few of the reviews here, I originally thought this was a mockumentary.  As soon as I heard Daniel start singing I was laughing so hard I had to pause the DVD.

Genius? In a room of mental patients maybe.  The fact that Daniel cannot sing and can barely play the guitar make me wonder why people admire him so much. I think the funniest thing in the entire movie is that TWO major labels were actually in a bidding war for him. and his album went on to sell less than 6,000 copies!  I'm sure the guy that signed him is flipping burgers at Wendy's now.

As a film, its not bad.  I think Daniel is a relatively good pop artist in the Keith Haring vein more than anything, but as a singer-song writer, I'm sorry he is god awful.",1168387200,10,731,4.112676056338028
2615656,4,B000GNOSGS,"I first became exposed to Daniel's music after hearing M. Ward's version of 'To Go Home"" on the album ""Post War"". I researched his story to find out that I had come to the game quite late, as he had been recording since the early 80's. Better late than never.

Some may be familiar with his art, adorned by the likes of Kurt Cobain on a T-shirt. All should know the whole story behind this misunderstood genius and this DVD is a great place to do that.

Although mentally challenged, Daniel has the ability to compose songs that reach straight into the heart and squeeze the emotion right out of you. His lyrics seldom rhyme and his melodies simple, yet the end result is as powerful as anything put out by music's most legendary performers.

In addition he also is a prolific artist.

2615660,5,B000GNOSGS,"I don't know who will be more enthralled by this documentary film - long-time fans of Daniel Johnston or those being exposed for the first time to his tragic genius.  I can only speak for the latter, a brand new fan who has found what I consider to be a kindred spirit.  The Devil and Daniel Johnston may sound like some kind of Faustian melodrama, but it is in fact a searingly honest and unabashedly intimate look inside the mind of a tortured genius, a chronicle of madness examining Daniel Johnston's life-long internal war between self-accomplishment and self-defeat.  Famed for his art as well as his music, Daniel Johnston has lived a life of almost mythic ups and downs, and his story is equally inspirational and heartbreaking.  Some folks won't connect with his art or his folk-based songs, but I don't think anyone can watch this film without being moved by the man's emotional story.

From childhood, Johnston was an iconoclastic individual dedicated to art and music, surrounding himself with comic books and musical paraphernalia, including his own music studio with a piano and boom boxes.  It was here in his basement (and later the homes of both his brother and his sister) that he recorded his first songs for a cottage industry of self-made tapes that would serve as his foot in the door to a musical career.  Johnston taped more than just his music, however.  From 8mm movies made with his brother to audio letters to friends and associates to recordings of his mother haranguing him to home video of his early days in the Austin music scene, an almost unprecedented wealth of personal material was available for this illuminating documentary, including films of the inspirational girl who got away (and married a mortician, appropriately enough for this story).  His early songs are about as raw as they come.  Like a Bob Dylan, Johnston doesn't have what you would call a pretty voice; he also is far from a master of guitar.  The passion of his music, though, is of the rarest kind, making it easy to see why he became such a cult icon.  This is extraordinary, soul-baring music.

What makes Johnston's art and music especially poignant, however, is the history of mental illness that shapes it so powerfully.  A manic-depressive (I guess you're supposed to refer to it as a bipolar disorder these days) with delusions and a sometimes debilitating obsession with Satan, Johnston has hit many lows in his life, many of which came in the immediate wake of great success.  He has, among other things, wandered off by himself in New York City, proselytized crowds with the imminent threat of demonic assaults, attacked his manager with a lead pipe, caused a plane crash he and his father were lucky to survive, compelled an elderly woman to jump from her second story window and break both her ankles, and walked away from a dreamy recording contract with Elektra because he feared that the guys from Metallica would, for their own Satanic purposes, murder him.  As you would expect, he has spent considerable time in mental institutions over the years.

What is most inspirational, besides Johnston's ability to come back and continue with his music and art after walking through so many emotional minefields, is the love and support of his family, especially his parents.  Basically unable to get along on his own, Johnston now lives with his parents; the effects of all his medication have obviously affected his physical health and his voice, but the genius is still there.  Thanks to good friends (including the long-time manager he fired for no good reason), his early music was never forgotten, and he is still producing new songs and drawings - and even touring internationally to a limited extent.  Large numbers of his songs have been recorded by a myriad of artists, including Pearl Jam, Gordan Gano, Beck, and Sonic Youth, and this film is sure to bring new fans into his fold.  Success has always been a double-edged sword for Johnston, but hopefully it will help provide the means for his care after his aging parents are gone.

Forget about music and art for a minute.  The Devil and Daniel Johnston is one of the most intimate looks at mental illness you will ever find, as few individuals have documented their entire lives to such an extent as Johnston has.  We get to see and hear many of the pivotal events that shaped his entire life, from childhood to the present day.  That makes this film an utterly fascinating psychological case study, no matter what you think of the man's artwork and music.",1167091200,5,4537,4.808236808236808
2615661,4,B000GNOSGS,"This film takes a strange arc.  For those who watch it and are not intimately familiar with the man or his music (like me) the movie is really weird.  Here is this guy who is introduced in the first concert clip as ""the worlds greatest living songwriter"" despite the fact that he has severe mental problems, can only sometimes sing on key and barely play the guitar.  The first 90 minutes of the film shows this in great detail while giving few full-on examples of the music that makes DJ such a legend to some.  It all becomes a little confusing and tedious.

But then finally with about 10 minutes to go comes the uninterrupted song ""True Love Will Find You In The End"".  Then parts of ""Casper"" and ""Devil Town"" and suddenly the movie and the music come together and everything begins to make sense.  This is the only movie you will ever see where the closing titles are the best thing in the film and more than worth the price of admission.  I've played the ending sequence set to ""Held the Hand"" over and over.  The song and accompanying video sums up Daniel Johnston better than any reviewer could in 1000 pages of text.

The closing closing titles and song (""Some Things Last a Long Time"") almost out does the previous sequence and brings this excellent film to a bittersweet end.  You now know who DJ is and why he is so revered.  You may not be convinced that he's the equivalent of Dylan or Lennon, but you'll be left wanting to hear more.",1165104000,2,1448,4.402255639097745
2615662,5,B000GNOSGS,"This was an excellent emotional ride for me.  I think you kind've have to want it so to speak to get it.  It didn't take much effort on my part at all to thoroughly enjoy this film more than once.  The person, friends and family, as well as the music and artwork.

I have a friend of mine who also happens to be a manic depressive, cartoonist/artist, musician, and writer.  He turned me onto this dvd.  He told me about watching it several times over the past couple of weeks.  So, I rented it.  I'm from Austin, TX. so much of the material hit home for me in more ways than one.

My friend was already a fan of Daniel Johnston back in 1990 when I met him.  This friend was a roomie/co-worker for awhile and he came home one day with an autographed page of artwork he got from Daniel at Sound Exchange on 'the drag' here in Austin.  It was interesting and looked alot like artwork my friend was already doing.  He proudly displayed it up on the wall.  My friend had brought a package of typing paper and a pen to SoundExchange for the event shown in the film.  Daniel gladly drew him a cartoon.  Then my friend left the pack of paper and pen with Daniel and Daniel continued drawing/autographing for others as seen in the film.  We often went there for cd releases or in-store performances and bought a great deal of our music collection there.  Once my friend got his cartoon and autograph he headed home wanting to give others a chance for the same great feeling he walked away with.

My friend identified with Daniel almost 100%.  There were so many similarities.  He basically said this is the equivalent of a story about my life and ""my condition"".

Fast forward to many years later and my friend now lives out in Los Angeles and we talk alot and share ideas for music, movies, artwork, as we always have.  I rent the movie.  It hits me so hard I immediately rush out and buy the dvd as well as a few of the early 80's albums and the greatest hits cd that came out not too long ago.  I enjoy it all.  The story of Daniel Johston hits an emotional note with me.  The music is great!  I enjoy the artwork quite a bit as well.

The dvd and the extras are great.  I feel it was a magical presentation really.  I've found that I too can watch this over and over again.  Many emotions are covered in Daniel's music and artwork.  And his condition is one that I've had first hand access to.  Daniel seems like someone I've known for decades and yet I do not know him and I'm glad I found this little dvd.  Each time I pull it out, it's going to hit me with all that it has to offer.  I watched it again tonight and enjoyed it just as much as I did the first time, and I've seen it several times now.

This dvd and the cd's I do have (by Daniel) just make me want to go out and get more, as well as check out Kathy's album as well.  And a few others.  I also really enjoyed getting to see a sneakpeak into the family.  They were really great.  The subject matter is enjoyable enough.  But the film itself is a work of art and bravo to the film makers and all involved.  Thank you.",1164758400,,3077,4.145762711864407
2615663,4,B000GNOSGS,"If you are browsing this Amazon site, and just strayed into this page, you might be thinking now: 'Who is Daniel Johnston?' There could be many answers to this question-- great musician, great artist, genius, etc., but the truth is, you don't have to know much about Daniel Johnston and his works because 'The Devil and Daniel Johnston' is an interesting documentary, a portrait of one person whose life has been full of inspirations and troubles.

The documentary consists of seemingly endless records about Daniel Johnston, numerous cassette tapes and Super 8 reels recorded by Daniel himself. Born in a religious family in California, in 1961, Daniel got interested in art while he was a teenager, and develops his unique style of music and drawings.

But what is remarkable about this documentary is that director Jeff Feuerzeig successfully recreates Daniel's life after he runs away from his home. Even though you are not particularly impressed with his songs, you just cannot stop watching the extraordinary life of this singer-and-song writer who repeatedly suffers from mental illness, his obsession with the devil.

The film includes Daniel's concert footage, but mainly is composed with the recorded cassette tapes and interviews with his family, friends, and other people surrounding him. It is regrettable that we can rarely hear from Daniel himself, but his inner voices can be heard through the tapes that recorded his songs. (Daniel frequently recorded his own conversations. One of them is recorded, possibly with a hidden recorder, when he was caught doing graffiti at Statue of Liberty.)

The film does not try to make him look a very charming fellow. One interviewee, who recounts one bitter episode about Daniel, really looks like a characters in one of Woody Allen masterpieces (which you will see in this documentary), and though the film makes it clear that his parents love Daniel, it is painful to watch his father crying before the camera, remembering one incredible event that happened while he was flying with his son.

Roger Ebert said in his review (3 stars out of 4) that his 'music does not seem to deserve quite the level of praise he has received.' Is he really as great as Brian Wilson or Bob Dylan? Frankly I am not sure, but the film is not about his music or his celver lyrics; it is about what made his music, and certainly there is something touching in it that reminds us of the presence of humanity.",1163635200,3,2442,4.91747572815534
2615664,5,B000GNOSGS,"Daniel Johnston is the epitome of what eccentricity truly means to this world: something so original that it has no social influence, no correct answer, and no category. Something so different that there is no way to accurately put it into words. The few people who create this uniqueness are typically ""outside the box"" in all senses and may be deemed ""crazy"" by the ""inside the box"" public. Daniel Johnston is an amazing example of how such peculiarity creates incredible public interest but may still frighten those who refuse to stay open-minded.

 Diagnosed as severely manic depressant and ""mentally insane"", Daniel has lived his life in a world we can only vividly portray through music and art. Rock Stars such as Kurt Cobain, Sonic Youth, and Pearl Jam have idolized him; his own friends and family have been terrified of him. The Devil and Daniel Johnston explicates an upsetting and yet captivating tale of a life that Daniel Johnston believes he has ""sold his soul to the devil for"". It is a story that is long overdue in its explanation and not to be missed by anyone interested in something fascinatingly rare. I highly recommend it.",1163376000,2,1147,4.846938775510204
2615665,4,B000GNOSGS,"""The Devil and Daniel Johnston"" is filmmaker Jeff Feuerzeig's tribute to the cult singer/songwriter whom he adores. Daniel Johnston's unstoppable creative impulse stuck with him through decades of mental illness, producing thousands of songs and works of art that have earned him a cult following on several continents. His songs have been performed by 150 artists around the world. One has even been featured in a Target commercial. ""The Devil and Daniel Johnston"" is the story of Dan's work, his life, his illness, and the people it affected. Beginning with his conservative Christian roots in New Cumberland, West Virginia, Feuerzeig follows the emergence of Dan's prolific creativity and that of his severe bipolar disorder to his explosion onto the Austin music scene in the 1980s, through his life-threatening bouts of mania, to his current relative success and stability.

Daniel Johnston documented his own life obsessively, so we are often able to understand it as he did, through home movies (the snowflake effect is mold), extensive audio diaries, drawings, and song. Interviews with his parents Bill and Mabel Johnston, brother Dick Johnston, sister Margie Johnston, best friend and fellow artist David Thornberry, tireless manager Jeffrey Tartakov, and figures from the Austin music scene fill in the gaps and provide a perspective on Dan's fragile mental state. Kathy McCarty, who gave Dan his break opening for her band ""Glass Eye"", and Austin Chronicle editor Louis Black recount Dan's stellar and controversial rise in Austin to win the 1986 Austin Music Awards' Songwriter of the Year and Best Folk Act. Dan's straight-laced, religious parents, to whom he always inevitably returned when he couldn't function, convey an acceptance and devotion to their son which, though not uncommon in parents of disabled children, is nothing short of heroic.

So why all the fuss about Daniel Johnston? Only his fans could tell you that. Though he is impressively prolific, I find him only a moderate songwriting talent. His lyrics are childlike, as if they are the early work of a talented writer. Daniel Johnston did not develop emotionally or socially past his youth. His work is self-absorbed and directed inward. He writes (and draws) about what goes on in his own head. I'm sure that's a result of his illness, and bipolar disorder is not Daniel Johnston's only problem. But imagine 30 years of songs about one's own mind. I'm glad Daniel has found an audience. He needs the income. But I have no idea why people think Daniel Johnston is a songwriting genius. I saw better songwriters every week when I worked in a recording studio. Even as ""outsider art"", Daniel's paintings are mediocre. His fans seem to think that Daniel's mental illness has inspired great art, when it has obviously prevented him from developing artistically. But whatever one thinks of his talent, ""The Devil and Daniel Johnston"" is a captivating and heart-rending picture of a man and his family trying to make a life in spite of serious mental illness.

The DVD (Sony Pictures 2006): Bonus features include 11 additional audio diaries, 6 deleted scenes, and a ""Daniel and Laurie Reunion"" (8 min) where Dan met his muse Laurie for the first time in 26 years. ""Legendary WFMU Broadcast"" (15min) was hosted by Daniel via telephone on WFMU's Music Faucet 2nd Year Anniversary Special. Dan takes phone calls, voices characters, and sings. ""Sundance World Premiere"" (7 min) is question and answer sessions and interviews with the press at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, featuring Daniel and director Jeff Feuerzeig. ""Cinema of Daniel Johnston"" (5 min) is 3 short films that Dan made as a teenager. There is an audio commentary by director Jeff Feuerzeig and producer Henry S. Rosenthal which takes us through the sources for their material, recreating environments for the film, creating footage to match Daniel's audio, interprets the film, and introduces us to the people in it. Feuerzeig and Rosenthal's effusive praise of Daniel's every creation is simply bizarre. Subtitles for the film are available in French.",1161993600,,4097,5.148648648648648
2615666,5,B000GNOSGS,"First of all, who is Daniel Johnston? He is a mentally ill individual, conceived by loving parents who wanted nothing but the best for their son. Given what they were dealt, Daniel's Mother and Father did as fine a job as any could have with raising their unique and wonderful child. One hopes that nothing but good days lie ahead for Daniel and his family.

This documentary does an excellent job highlighted this area of Daniel's life, and it alone makes it worth watching.

Now to the meat of this review---the MASS MADNESS of Daniel's followers.

I sat through the first thirty minutes of this documentary thinking, ""This HAS TO be a joke right?"" Then I recalled Charles Mackay's book from 1841, ""Extraordinary Popular Delusions & the Madness of Crowds"".

One can only assume that the documentary makers didn't consider this angle, since they themselves were also mad, as were those who became enamored with Daniel's ""music""---his manager, other musicians, and the untold number of fans who followed.

Here we see on display, an entire segment of our population so devoid of common sense that they cannot discern the difference between Music (as a true art form) and the noises and incoherent lyrics coming from a mentally ill individual.

What starts as a trickle, when Daniel grabs the ears of a few infantile musicians (of whom they too believe themselves to be artists), culminates in an orgy of madness with 3,000 people packing an auditorium to cheer the absorption of his angelic ""music"".

Although these ideas were mere fog in this reviewer's mind throughout much of the documentary, they became concrete after hearing that Kurt Cobain was also a fan of Daniel's music. Note: Cobain committed suicide at the young age of 27.

As with all cycles of mass madness however, they result in a hard fall. Enter Atlantic Records. They too fall prey to the spell, and it results in them investing in a project that yields 5,800 units sold.

Thus ends another chapter in ""Extraordinary Popular Delusions & the Madness of Crowds""---The Devil and Daniel Johnston.",1160265600,6,2063,4.905172413793103
2615667,5,B000GNOSGS,"I first heard Daniel Johnston a few years ago when I was in high school. Kurt Cobain turned me onto lots of music, including Daniel. At first I thought it was terrible, just another artist that pretentious people enjoy. Oh, how naiive I was. This documentary will show you why Daniel Johnston is one of the most important songwriters/artists alive today. He puts all the pain, ugliness, and humor of his life into his art. And what a life he has had. The whole story is almost mythological, really. The best part of the doc. is how well Daniel managed to record his life over the years using tape recorders, cameras etc. The filmmakers must have wet their pants when Daniel handed that stuff over. I mean, he recorded EVERYTHING. I originally saw this doc. in a theater and I must say, it is equally parts hilarious, moving, and tragic. Now I can watch it in the comfort of my own home. THANKS AMAZON!",1160179200,3,901,4.5
2615668,3,B000GNOSGS,"I can understand why a lot of people are put off by the excessive use of the word ""genius"" to describe Daniel Johnston. I do, however, think he's much more deserving of the label than um-teen other pop culture figures to whom it's commonly applied. I think he certainly demonstrates an exceptional degree of creativity, and as for whether you think what he produces is good or not, well, that kind of comes down to personal taste, doesn't it? But I'll agree that he's not Mozart or Joyce or Van Gogh or Einstein. Fair enough.

But while his work (and I mean specifically his music...I consider myself pretty ignorant when it comes to visual art) may lack sophistication, it absolutely does not lack emotional power, and I think it's a real shame that the movie fails to convey it.

For those who are already pretty familiar with Daniel Johnston's life, the film is definitely worth checking out. It fills in a lot of details and humanizes his story, which admittedly has become a little too mythic for its own good. But if you come to the film without any knowledge or preconceptions, I'd encourage you to check out his early music. Songs of Pain and More Songs of Pain. Yip Jump Music. Hi How Are You. It's the songs on those records that made Daniel Johnston into a cult figure.

Now, you may check it out and still think it's nothing but amateurish, childish, white noise. But depending on how adventurous your taste is, you might discover something more if you give it a few listens. Personally, I hated his stuff the first time I listened to it, but as has happened with most music that's really stuck with me and made a deep impression on me, something gradually happened and I started hearing it differently.

All I can say is, in my opinion, there's a degree of honesty, jagged originality, and, very often, cleverness in Daniel's stuff that is just very, very rare in pop music. It's a purity of expression. Now, the form and content of that expression may not be for everyone...nothing's for everyone...but it has touched a lot of people, not a few of whom are pretty good musicians.

Basically, I thought the film talked too much and didn't listen. I'm not saying it should have been a 90 minute music video, but it could have lingered more on some of the early songs...brought you into them a little further. BUT, it didn't. You'll just have to go there yourself if you're interested.",1159747200,6,2396,4.601873536299766
2615669,4,B000GNOSGS,"Only being vaguely familiar with Johnston this wellmade documentary was a beautiful and interesting tribute to what many call a genius. What Johnston really is to me is a troubled mentally ill dedicated artist trapped in a permanent 10 year olds mindframe. The film chronicles Johnston's love of art(music art-film) which started at a very young age, his supportive loving but overbearingly fundamentalist parents, and his long ride of small successes and many spirals into madness. Thanks to celebrity and musician endorsement(cobains tshirt started a major label bidding war) and a faithful manager that manages his catalogue- Johnston has had a sort of unbelievable quasi career that has lasted for nearly two decades despite mental breakdowns suicide attempts and seclusion. Daniel Johnston is a very sincere beatles loving love obsessed manchild whose life makes a tragicomedy of epic proportions. Oddly i found myself disturbed at how his music and art has became more freakshow driven and championed by the  grand illusions of those around him. To say hes better than Bob Dylan and Brian Wilson is alittle much- especially considering he can barely play piano and guitar his voice is terrible and many of his melodies seem stolen from his idol Lennon. Johnstons music is quirky childlike and no doubt more truthful than anyones and for this he should be commended. You know its pure and ill admit that is a rare gift. But the sycophants keep at it declaring his artwork masterpieces. To watch a gallery owner say Johnstons drawings( most essentially popular comic book hereos altered slightly) are so unique and mindblowingly original almost made me laugh. Once again his artwork displays his pain and struggle for all to see and is pure soul- but in the end ive seen children draw better and with the same purity. I think its the fact that Johnston is  really still a child that makes all he does seem so interesting. His mental illness and legendary behaviour have fed the flames of ""genius"" talk. I plan on getting a few of his cds as a result of this film because i did find his music truthful and quirky- and this fascinating film about a troubled soul should be the first film you rent at the video store- for its not just about music- its about the human experience!",1159574400,,2280,4.888888888888889
2615670,5,B000GNOSGS,"It was high time I watched a decent film.  The last four films that I reviewed (Shaggy Dog, She's the Man, Accepted, and Stick It) all recieved no more than two stars, and I haven't given a film five stars in months.  Something's going on in Hollywood, and even the DVD releases are below average.  But, alas, this is not my critique of Hollywood, it's a critique of one of the best documentaries of the year, and it almost stands up to Werner Herzog's incredibly moving film of 2004 (which, interestingly enough, was about a man most people would consider mad), ""Grizzly Man.""  Cult classic Daniel Johnston (of whom I have never heard of until watching this film) steps onstage at the beginning of the documentary and begins to sing.  He has a slight lisp and sounds a bit like Bob Dylan, but even that is an overstatement.  The fact is, after hearing Johnston sing, I wasn't sure if I even wanted to spend two hours getting to know this guy.  Why is he such a bad singer?  Well, I'm glad I did get to know him, and, through his life story, I began to like his music, and some of it was actually pretty good.  I don't really know if I plan to go out and buy one of his tapes, but I started to admire him for his art.  His drawings are exceptional, and are collected all over the world.  Johnston starts out as a seemingly normal, albeit a bit antisocial, teenager in a small West Virginia town, and immediately takes to art and music.  His parents, especially his mother, constantly get on his case to get a job, go to school, etc., but Johnston would rather stay in his room, playing his piano and making movies (which, from a film and art standpoint, are brilliant).  His parents sed him to live at a college, but it doesn't last long, and soon he's back at home commuting to a nearby school.  While at this second college, he meets a girl, who would eventually become the inspiration for countless Johnston songs.  Even though Johnston functions as a ""normal person"", one can't help but notice the irregularities in his behavior, irregularities which would soon help in his diagnosis of manic depression.  Johnston continues making music and drawing, moving to Texas to live with his brother.  After joining a carnival, Johnston disappears from his family, only to call them weeks later to tell them of his arrival in California.  He begins making his first album, which would eventually become ""Hi, How Are You"" and distributing them to everyone who will listen.  Somehow, he gets on MTV, and success is immediate.  Johnston begins performing his songs weekly on MTV and immediately gains a following.  Members of Sonic Youth get together to perform with him, Kurt Cobain wears Johnston's art on a shirt, and everyone becomes a Daniel Johnston fan.  Things seem to get really great for Johnston, until someone at a Butthole Surfers concert gives him a bit of LSD.  Daniel begins to go downhill, becoming a strong, devout Christian, and exhibiting more than unusual behavior.  The rest of the film, which you should absolutely see, chronicles Johnston as he goes in and out of mental institutions, on and off medication.  He finally gets signed to Atlantic records, but his album sells only 5800 copies.  This brilliant odyssey is written and directed by Jeff Feuerzeig, and really deserves Best Documentary consideration come Oscar time.  Daniel Johnston's story is strong, powerful, moving, and one of the most interesting looks at madness in recent years.",1159315200,3,3462,4.717138103161398
2615671,5,B000GNOSGS,"""I had lost my mind.
I lost my head for a while was off my rocker outta line, outta wack.
See I had this tiny crack in my head
That slowly split open and my brain snoozed out,
Lyin' on the sidewalk and I didn't even know it.
I had lost my mind."" --I Had Lost My Mind by Daniel Johnston

I stumbled onto Daniel Johnston's brilliance quite by accident. Last week, I was watching a repeat of the Top 40 Metal Songs on VH1 Classics. Henry Rollins was one of the featured commentators, and my husband mentioned that he had a TV show--and what a fascinating character Rollins was.

So I happened to be channel surfing, and came across Rollins' show on IFC (he was interviewing Billy Bob Thornton). At the end of the show, some guy named Daniel Johnston comes on. At first, we didn't know if he was ""for real"" or if it was a gag. He warbled a folksy song with his eyes shut (or downcast)--I had wondered if he was blind. We soon became intrigued--especially with the clever lyrics.

I said to my husband ""Boy, he reminds me of Kurt Cobain. I bet Cobain would have been inspired by Daniel."" The interesting thing is that, unbeknownst to me, Cobain not only knew who Daniel was, but often wore a T shirt featuring one of Daniel's drawings! (""Hi, how are you?"")

By the end of his rambling, genuinely-felt song, we wanted to know more. My husband did an internet search, and found out who Daniel Johnston was. He also found out that a DVD was coming out about Daniel; I put it on my Netflix queue.

We just finished watching the DVD, and it was AMAZING. I love documentaries that are character studies, but The Devil and Daniel Johnston was so much more than that. Rather than giving you mere biographical details about the guy (you can find those for yourself), I'll tell you what impressed me about this man and this film.

I was (not so) surprised to find that Daniel's parents are fundamentalist Christians, and that his Mom constantly harangued him about being ""lazy"" and producing ""devil cartoons"". Her rejection of his interests and talents--trying to force this round peg in a middle-class-American-fundie-square hole--plus her demonizing of his self-expression no doubt contributed to Daniel's paranoia about satan and demons.

I was amazed at how utterly creative Daniel was/is; the short films he produced as a teen--especially his editing talents!--were remarkable.

While the creative Daniel is inspiring, we soon get a glimpse into an almost child-like world view--one that quickly unravels into self-destructive behaviors...not to mention violent tendencies.

It was downright scary watching Daniel in his mid-30's, especially after going off his meds and doing things like hitting his manager in the head with a lead pipe, almost crashing a plane he was on and ranting at his audience about demon possession, the divinity of the number 7, and other paranoid, fundamentalist mumbo jumbo. Watching the self-sabotage and mental illness made me cover my eyes at times--no lie. It was painful.

But then, after 5 years in a mental institution Daniel gets the correct meds--and begins the path of (some sort of) normalcy.

The especially sad part of this documentary wasn't Daniel's unrequited love for Laurie (a girl he met in college); it was the utter devotion of his manager, Jeff Tartakov, who diligently worked on Daniel's behalf even when Daniel was locked up. Daniel fired Jeff at the cusp of a lucrative record deal (Elektra and Atlantic were in a bidding war), and Daniel concluded that Elektra was ""demonic"" because Metallica was on their label. Under a new manager, Daniel signs with Atlantic, selling only well-under 10,000 copies.

Unlike what is listed here on Amazon (and what a reviewer copy and pasted from Amazon's description), the Special Features are only Deleted Scenes, personal recordings of Daniel Johnston, producer commentary, and Daniel's (moving) reunion with Laurie. (Incidentally, she wasn't his ""sweetheat"" and they met in college, not High School.)

Also showcased in this documentary is Daniel's art (which his former manager snatched up any chance he got, even when he wasn't working for Daniel; talk about loyal!). Like his music, Daniel's art gives us a glimpse into his psyche: brilliant, tortured, unique and child-like. From ""Silver Sufferer"" to Casper, Captain America to the man who lost his mind--Daniel's art is sometimes like a trainwreck...you just can't look away.

If you're inspired by genius, ""tortured"" artists, and individuals who blaze a fiery trail just be ""being""--you'll likely love this incredible documentary.
