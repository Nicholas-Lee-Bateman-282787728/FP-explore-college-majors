8495155,5,B0016N15Z4,"Roger Kupelian does a marvelous job at catching a glimpse of the pre-implosion that occurred in the Soviet Union in the early to mid 1990's. In particular this documentary explores the venting out of some 70 years of frustration by the ethnically Armenian people against a Soviet system that relied heavily on a divide and conquer ideology. What complicates the emotions, as it usually does, is the prospect of plentiful oil in Azerbaijan and how to get it to the Mediterranean ports in Turkey. The shortest route would be through Armenian by way of the autonomous region of Nagorno Karabagh. The autonomous region lies in Azerbaijan but is populated by ethnic Armenians. It ultimately benefits Russia if the pipeline goes through Russian territory instead on its way to its markets. The fact that Western countries, and companies, do not agree places the country of Armenia, and the autonomous region of Nagorno Karabagh, in a precarious position. Russia, in the end, has and will likely remain Armenia's protector in the region. One wonders how pent up emotions over territorial issues are manipulated at the cost of Armenian and Azerbaijani lives in order to get a plentiful supply of precious oil. Kupelian does a good job at exploring these issues and the lesson is understood. For those who are not well versed in the politics of the Armenian plateau, the first 15 minutes of this documentary binds Kupelian's spell-bounding artistry with computer graphics and real life to introduce the viewer about the history. One comes away with a good understanding without having had to do much back ground reading. The most interesting aspect is that Roger Kupelian, as an Armenian American, decided to go to Armenian in the middle of a war and try to reach an understanding of this conflict. Thank you.",1428883200,,1800,4.983388704318937
