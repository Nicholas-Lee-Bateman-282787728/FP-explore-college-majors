8064561,4,B0009P7ELE,"Who Slew Auntie Roo? is a story loosely based on the fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel. Aunt Roo (Shelley Winters) is an eccentric, middle aged lady, who lost her young daughter several years ago in a tragic fall, and has been trying to contact her through a medium (Sir Ralph Richardson) ever since. When a group of orphans, including Christopher Coombs (Mark Lester) and his sister Katy (Chloe Franks), visit Aunt Roo's mansion for a Christmas party, Aunt Roo becomes convinced that Katy is her daughter returned to life, and kidnaps her, locking her in a secret room. What follows is their attempts to to escape. Christopher is convinced that she's going to cook and eat them. Entertaining and suspenseful, Who Slew Aunt Roo is very interesting and enjoyable.",1194566400,,760,4.8538461538461535
