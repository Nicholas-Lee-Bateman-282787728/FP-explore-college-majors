2120843,1,B0002US53W,"Well,I was disappointed with this dvd, it is sooooooooo boring, I guess that's what yoga is supposed to be. It did not meet my expectations at all, I feel that honestly I paid way to much for it, sorry I could not send it back. Maybe it is worth about $5.00. If you like boring this would be the one to get, but don't pay this price for it, wait to find it at a yard sale. (sorry)",1194566400,7,380,3.8846153846153846
2120844,5,B0002US53W,"I have purchased many workouts in my quest for the ""perfect stretch"" (Tamilee, Miranda, Madeleine, etc.) I absolutely LOVE this workout!  It is one of the most gentle stretch workouts I have ever done!  There is a quick standing warm-up in which you sort of sway your body side to side, then do some gentle side lunges and arm pulls that remind me of tai chi.  Next comes the floor stretches, almost all of which are done on your back, in which you point your leg straight up, then bring it down.  Floor exercises also include some hip opening moves.  You end the floorwork on your hands and knees with some cat stretches.  Next is seated floorwork where you sit with your legs wide and stretch your arms from one side of your body to the other.  Finally you're standing again for some quick finishing stretches.  There is nothing new here, but the moves are practiced at a nice, gentle pace ... not too fast, not too slow.  The workout is done voice-over style, and the music is very soothing.  The ocean background adds to the total relaxation experience.  I really enjoyed this stretch!  There is also a section on how your muscles & tendons work, and how your breathing works - it was interesting, but as it is separately chaptered, it can be easily skipped.  I am so glad I found this DVD!",1173571200,60,1294,4.478632478632479
2120845,5,B0002US53W,I just got Fabulous Forever Easy Stretch by Mirabai Holland. It is excellent. The entire video is soothing from beginning to end. While I was doing it I felt like I was in a trance and I could feel myself loosening up. The 45 minutes went by like nothing. When I finished it I was glowing. I felt like I'd been to the Spa. It's the most relaxing workout I've ever done and what great stretches.,1133222400,49,394,4.197368421052632
2120846,5,B0002US53W,"This is the greatest stretching program ever.  I am 60 and trying to stay flexible and fit.  It's not easy, but this program really works well.  The movements start out small and extend little by little so that before you even realize it, you are stretching those tight muscles without pain or discomfort.  It feels really good!  There's a smooth progression from one movement to another and you are always moving, not just static stretching, which is what makes it so easy.  She calls it Moving Free, and it really does work.

I also have to give a nod to the great background shots.  I feel like I am there and the locations are so beautiful that I look forward to starting out my day with this program.",1241049600,2,705,4.453125
2120847,5,B0002US53W,Mirabai Holland's Aerobics DVD is just wonderful. I have danced to it six times since I bought it and already feel the benefits. All the moves ate very clearly explained and after a bit of practice become easy to follow. I am a fairly fit 68 year old and find these exercises just the ticket to better health and flexibility.,1236384000,,325,4.433333333333334
2120848,5,B0002US53W,"I have been using Mirabai Holland's Flexibility Level 1 video for several weeks now and I just have to talk about how great it is. She has a gentle, but complete stretch routine that you can tell is really well thought out.  She makes sure to warm up your muscles without you even realizing it and then manages to stretch your whole body. I have had problems with my back and this feels very safe. But what is really special about this video is how it makes you feel. Your body stretches while your mind goes on vacation. You are looking at this beautiful beach with the waves behind you. You can almost feel the warmth of the sun. and there is beautiful music playing (sometimes i just keep playing the dvd to listen to the music!) I really recommend this dvd. It really makes you look forward to stretching.",1219622400,5,809,4.3933333333333335
2120849,4,B0002US53W,"This DVD is easy to follow. The personality of Mirabai, who leads the stretching, is pleasant and easy to watch.  It starts with warmups and gives alternatives to specific stretches for those who want to stretch more.  Gentle, but effective.",1203033600,12,241,5.0
2120850,5,B0002US53W,This was great to get started again in a stretching routine. I like the breathing that she does and it makes me feel great,1202428800,8,122,4.125
2120851,5,B0002US53W,"This is the best workout for stretching and stress reduction!!
I use many different stretching DVD's but this combines stretching and stress reduction. You feel great after too. It takes more time then some of the others but it is worth it.",1200528000,7,240,4.738095238095238
2120852,5,B0002US53W,I enjoy this Easy Stretch DVD so much! It feels like an indulgence to use it.  This is a definite keeper.  I use it several times a week and it never gets old or boring.,1199750400,9,169,3.8
2120853,5,B0002US53W,This easy stretch dvd is just what I was looking for. It's been hard getting back into exercising since I have gained some weight and have become less active. The other dvd's out there have been too intense for me and I quit doing them. This fabulous forever dvd has changed my attitude.  I am able to do these stretches and I can feel my body changing and getting stronger.  I actually look forward to exercising with Mirabai Holland each day. She's very encouraging and her personality is very soothing. I think it is a terrific dvd.,1196553600,16,535,4.505154639175258
2120854,5,B0002US53W,"I'm glad I took a chance on this video.  The instructor is personable and she focuses on the task at hand - no annoying chatter or weird camera angles.  The scenery, at a lake in the mountains, is pleasant.  The routine is enjoyable from beginning to end. This is an ""active stretch"" format, meaning lots of movement, instead of ""static"" stretch.  Makes me feel like I've had a rejuvenating mini-spa experience, guided by a thoughtful instructor.

Mirabai mentions ""lubricating the joints,"" and at first I wondered ""so what? who needs that?""  Well, after doing the video a few times and noticing how much better my joints move, I now say ""hey, I need that!""  If your joints creak and pop this is a great video for you too.",1196380800,28,722,4.59375
2120855,5,B0002US53W,"I bought this DVD after pulling a muscle in my back and realizing that I need to stretch regularly to avoid problems like that in the future. This DVD is WONDERFUL! The stretches feel absolutely fabulous, and are very rejuvenating. I found Mirabai's approach to be very peaceful and soothing. She's also very knowledgeable about muscles and stretching. The DVD even includes a ""chapter"" on how muscles and stretching work (it's a bit technical, but it's separate from the main workout, so you can watch it or not as you choose).

If your goal is to become more flexible and to enjoy the process, this DVD is perfect.",1194998400,15,616,4.703703703703703

8032129,4,B0002US53W,"I ordered the stretching tape thinking it would be easier to start with after being sedentary for a while, with some physical issues. Well, I barely got through the ""warm up"".(I was surprised that WAS only a warm-up!)  I also had trouble keeping up with her, as she's so young and flexible and seems to go so fast. However, I will keep doing it until I can get through the whole tape, AND keep up with her. Then I'll know I've improved. I found the DVD set-up a bit confusing, trying to find which picture to click on the main screen was the actual program. I think it's a good workout, but not as easy as I thought.",1345766400,,616,4.220338983050848
8032130,4,B0002US53W,"The video was bought for the purpose of easy stretch (like for someone who hasn't stretched in a long time).  I found the exercises too vigorous for a long time couch potato.  Granted, if one tries to do these moves 3 or 4 times per week they could be effective.  But I really needed something a lot more gradual.",1328227200,3,313,4.271186440677966
8032131,5,B0002US53W,"This is a great program!  I am in my late 60's with some health issues relating to balance, and I have found this most helpful.  It's nice to use a program that is gentle and yet one where you can feel the results.",1267315200,,214,3.953488372093023
