3004573,5,B000XP2TVU,"I wish Lumet was able to use the proper names from the Le Carre novel. Having said that I think this a terrific film, one I have been looking for for a long time (it seems only available in region 2). Is it as good as later Le Carrre?--I couldn't say --however it does provide some background  for ""The Spy who came  in from the Cold"". Furthermore the acting is splendid. Maximillian Schell (who never gets his due) is wonderful (interesting: Oscar  Werner never got his due for Spy), I give it five stars for the acting. As great as Burton et al are in SPY--I think Mason  Andrews Signoret and Schell may  out do them.
Lumet is a great director, When will this film be  released as a US DVD? It is powerful --but even if you think it does not come up to the chilling power of SPY--just watch it for the Craft!",1252540800,,810,4.193548387096774
3004574,4,B000XP2TVU,"The Deadly Affair is one of the better John Le Carre screen adaptations. Based on 'Call For the Dead,' the title's not the only name change: though he's called Charles Dobbs here, James Mason is really George Smiley while Maximilian Schell's character also undergoes a name change from The Spy Who Came In from the Cold because Paramount still owned the character names. Shot in 1966, when Britain seemed to be closed due to bad weather (a look made even grimmer by Freddie Young pre-exposing the film stock to mute the colours), Sidney Lumet's low-key and very small-scale thriller works much successfully on screen than you might expect. Where many LeCarres fail because, as someone once said, they're all plot and no story, this has at its heart a fairly good mystery - why did a cabinet minister commit suicide AFTER being cleared of allegations of spying, and was it suicide or murder?

This is from that period when Mason's screen image was shifting from aggressive and domineering characters to tired and shrunken ones increasingly aware they'd lost all their battles with life and were just trying to get through life as gently and with as few vestiges of decency as they could muster. If it's overshadowed by Alec Guinness's portrayal of Smiley in the two 70s TV series which mixed cold steel with the domestic humiliation, Mason's tendency to show a man trying to keep everything on amiable and civilised terms as far as possible gives a good sense of how he ended up that way. Harry Andrews offers fine support as the retired detective who likes only facts and keeps on nodding off whenever anybody strays into conjecture or theorising and there's even a glimpse of David Warner when he was still a promising young stage actor in the RSC's Edward II, an appropriate setting for one of the film's few acts of violence. It's not without its problems, chief of which is an intrusive Quincy Jones score that feels the need to carpet every scene of domestic betrayal between secret servant James Mason and his unfaithful wife Harriet Andersson with inappropriate lounge music, and you can add Mason to the list of stars who should never be allowed to wear dark glasses, but the quiet strengths easily outweigh them.

Sony's Region 2 PAL DVD is extras free, and doesn't even have a proper menu, but it does boast a fine 1.85:1 widescreen transfer.",1210550400,36,2352,4.79064039408867

3004579,3,B000XP2TVU,"Worth watching for Simone Signoret and the London of the late 1960s, but terribly subpar compared with John le Carre's book (""Call for the Dead""). Many liberties are taken with the book's plot so it should come as no surprise that the protagonist isn't even called George Smiley anymore but Charles Dobbs. (Hint: a famous subplot from other books involving two other characters is now used in this movie, as if the screenwriters were worried they'd never get around to writing the script for the movie adaptation of the book(s) the subplot really is in.) Also, the beginning gives away key information that isn't revealed in the book until much later. Still, it's worth a watch as a period piece. The end scene at the theater (which again takes liberties with the book's plot) shows Signoret's enormous talent. The other actors are fine too.",1495584000,,841,4.847222222222222

3004586,4,B000XP2TVU,"James Mason, one of the extraordinary actors of the 60's, is seen here as George Smiley from John le Carre's first novel. And Mason as Smiley is very believable. Because of some issue with company ownership Smiley was known as Dobbs. But, to us, he is Smiley.

George Smiley is the best Cold War Spy one shall ever meet in the le Carrie series. Intelligent, wiley, smooth operator, beloved by his colleagues, a worthy adversary by his enemies, Smiley wins us all. In this film, Smiley or Dobbs as he is known, has given the green light to a man after an interview. The man was a Communist in his school days, and was reported anonymously. George considers the man is fine, however,  within a few short hours is reported to have killed himself. Dobbs does not believe this, and even though his boss wants no part, Dobbs investigates further.

In the midst of this Dobbs wife plays a large part in this film. She is a serial adulteress. Who knows the issues, but this obviously is eating up Dobbs inside. And, so it goes, rainy, rainy London, the MI-5 is taking its toll on Dobbs. On and on we go through the investigation, until the mystery is revealed. The first of le Carre's books and films, not well known, but what an introduction to Smiley.

3004597,4,B000XP2TVU,"A done and entertaining crime mystery-spy thriller adaptation of John Le Carre's very first book, ""A Call for the Dead"".

Allowing for the overbearing 60's background music at times, it goes with the period and the territory, it's full of twists and turns and is one of James Mason's better performances showing the World War II spy ties that bind and the onset of the hot Cold War circa 1959.

3004601,4,B000XP2TVU,"Based on John Le Carre's novel, ""Call for the Dead"", the film follows stodgy MI-5 agent Charles Dobbs (James Mason) through his investigation into the death of a British Foreign Office official.  Dobbs, agonizingly methodical, slowly puts the crime's pieces together even while his personal life falls to pieces, and manages to ferret out a Soviet spy in the process.  Dobbs (George Smiley in the novel) is the antithesis of the James Bond-types that were appearing with greater frequency in films of this era; i.e., unglamorous and weary, but well-focused on the job at hand. James Mason is superb.",1434067200,,599,5.040404040404041
3004602,4,B000XP2TVU,"I loved this Sidney Lumet direction of a LeCarre work.  He has punched up the story with close-up camera shots, intriguingly composed scenes, and not quite over the top performances by the lead actors, especially by the perpetually indignant and beside himself James Mason, whose distraught characterization I truly enjoyed.  Too often in LeCarre film adaptations, I fall asleep or lose the plot, forced into watching them repeatedly.  Not the case here.

Am I mistaken, but many of these scenarios between characters seem familiar.  Poor Anne, the libidinous one, who twice now has been used sexually by a spy to get at Smiley.  Wasn't she bed by Bill Haydon in Tinker Tailor to distract Smiley from the mole?  Mendel, the retired one, kept bees in Tinker Tailor; here it's rabbits.  What's up with this?

Alas, I did not enjoy the performances by the two actresses and was completely underwhelmed with Simone Signoret.  Her best scene was the rather Hitchcockian flavored one in the theatre toward the end.  Finally, a little facial expression.",1431302400,2,1046,5.023255813953488

Although ""A Call for the Dead"" is my favorite Le Carre book, I hadn't realized until recently that it had been made into a movie as ""The Deadly Affair"".

Reading the book many times, my main complaint was that it was too short, like the editors had forced the author to make the book as concise as possible. So the movie expands the story in certain ways, which gives an interesting idea of what additional material the author might have wished to include.

I generally don't like Le Carre's writings on male-female relationships, but I liked the way the movie handled it, giving an interesting trip back in time to see what an attractive ""Avant Garde""  woman might have looked like back in 1967.",1354406400,5,841,4.630872483221476

I could more or less accept the casting choices and character portrayal but I have to admit I was not pleased with most of the casting choices nor their portrayal. I found the soundtrack to be very intrusive and almost over-powering. I think Quincy Jones was a poor choice to prepare a soundtrack for an English ""Spy"" film. Yet with all of these seemingly negative comments I have to say that overall it was a solid film. Well directed and acted (minus the soundtrack of course).

The wife character (Anne, played by Harriet Andersson) in the book is a sophisticate; here she is a portrayed as a sex-addict nymphomaniac, which works poorly at best. (All of Andersson's lines seem to have been poorly re-dubbed.)  And the film is undermined to a surprising degree by a very outdated score.

3239071,4,B000XP2TVU,"The Deadly Affair is one of the better John Le Carre screen adaptations. Based on 'Call For the Dead,' the title's not the only name change: though he's called Charles Dobbs here, James Mason is really George Smiley while Maximilian Schell's character also undergoes a name change from The Spy Who Came In from the Cold because Paramount still owned the character names. Shot in 1966, when Britain seemed to be closed due to bad weather (a look made even grimmer by Freddie Young pre-exposing the film stock to mute the colours), Sidney Lumet's low-key and very small-scale thriller works much successfully on screen than you might expect. Where many LeCarres fail because, as someone once said, they're all plot and no story, this has at its heart a fairly good mystery - why did a cabinet minister commit suicide AFTER being cleared of allegations of spying, and was it suicide or murder?

This is from that period when Mason's screen image was shifting from aggressive and domineering characters to tired and shrunken ones increasingly aware they'd lost all their battles with life and were just trying to get through life as gently and with as few vestiges of decency as they could muster. If it's overshadowed by Alec Guinness's portrayal of Smiley in the two 70s TV series which mixed cold steel with the domestic humiliation, Mason's tendency to show a man trying to keep everything on amiable and civilised terms as far as possible gives a good sense of how he ended up that way. Harry Andrews offers fine support as the retired detective who likes only facts and keeps on nodding off whenever anybody strays into conjecture or theorising and there's even a glimpse of David Warner when he was still a promising young stage actor in the RSC's Edward II, an appropriate setting for one of the film's few acts of violence. It's not without its problems, chief of which is an intrusive Quincy Jones score that feels the need to carpet every scene of domestic betrayal between secret servant James Mason and his unfaithful wife Harriet Andersson with inappropriate lounge music, and you can add Mason to the list of stars who should never be allowed to wear dark glasses, but the quiet strengths easily outweigh them.

Based on 'Call For the Dead,' the title's not the only name change: though he's called Charles Dobbs here, James Mason is really George Smiley while Maximilian Schell's character also undergoes a name change from The Spy Who Came In From the Cold because Paramount still owned the character names. Shot in 1966, when Britain seemed to be closed due to bad weather (a look made even grimmer by Freddie Young pre-exposing the film stock to mute the colours), Sidney Lumet's low-key and very small-scale thriller works much successfully on screen than you might expect. Where many LeCarres fail because, as someone once said, they're all plot and no story, this has at its heart a fairly good mystery - why did a cabinet minister commit suicide AFTER being cleared of allegations of spying, and was it suicide or murder?

This is from that period when Mason's screen image was shifting from aggressive and domineering characters to tired and shrunken ones increasingly aware they'd lost all their battles with life and were just trying to get through life as gently and with what few vestiges of decency as they could muster. If it's overshadowed by Alec Guinness's portrayal of Smiley in the two 70s TV series which mixed cold steel with the domestic humiliation, Mason's tendency to show a man trying to keep everything on amiable and civilised terms as far as possible gives a good sense of how he ended up that way. Harry Andrews offers fine support as the retired detective who likes only facts and keeps on nodding off whenever anybody strays into conjecture or theorising and there's even a glimpse of David Warner when he was still a promising young stage actor in the RSC's Edward II, an appropriate setting for one of the film's few acts of violence. It's not without its problems, chief of which is an intrusive Quincy Jones score that feels the need to carpet every scene of domestic betrayal between secret servant James Mason and his unfaithful wife Harriet Andersson with inappropriate lounge music, and you can add Mason to the list of stars who should never be allowed to wear dark glasses, but the quiet strengths easily outweigh them.

3239076,3,B000XP2TVU,"Worth watching for Simone Signoret and the London of the late 1960s, but terribly subpar compared with John le Carre's book (""Call for the Dead""). Many liberties are taken with the book's plot so it should come as no surprise that the protagonist isn't even called George Smiley anymore but Charles Dobbs. (Hint: a famous subplot from other books involving two other characters is now used in this movie, as if the screenwriters were worried they'd never get around to writing the script for the movie adaptation of the book(s) the subplot really is in.) Also, the beginning gives away key information that isn't revealed in the book until much later. Still, it's worth a watch as a period piece.

George Smiley is the best Cold War Spy one shall ever meet in the le Carrie series. Intelligent, wiley, smooth operator, beloved by his colleagues, a worthy adversary by his enemies, Smiley wins us all. In this film, Smiley or Dobbs as he is known, has given the green light to a man after an interview. The man was a Communist in his school days, and was reported anonymously. George considers the man is fine, however,  within a few short hours is reported to have killed himself. Dobbs does not believe this, and even though his boss wants no part, Dobbs investigates further.

In the midst of this Dobbs wife plays a large part in this film. She is a serial adulteress. Who knows the issues, but this obviously is eating up Dobbs inside. And, so it goes, rainy, rainy London, the MI-5 is taking its toll on Dobbs. On and on we go through the investigation, until the mystery is revealed. The first of le Carre's books and films, not well known, but what an introduction to Smiley.

Too often in LeCarre film adaptations, I fall asleep or lose the plot, forced into watching them repeatedly.  Not the case here.

Am I mistaken, but many of these scenarios between characters seem familiar.  Poor Anne, the libidinous one, who twice now has been used sexually by a spy to get at Smiley.  Wasn't she bed by Bill Haydon in Tinker Tailor to distract Smiley from the mole?  Mendel, the retired one, kept bees in Tinker Tailor; here it's rabbits.  What's up with this?

Reading the book many times, my main complaint was that it was too short, like the editors had forced the author to make the book as concise as possible. So the movie expands the story in certain ways, which gives an interesting idea of what additional material the author might have wished to include.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE DEADLY AFFAIR [1966] is directed by Sidney Lumet, based on a novel by John le Carr and starring luminaries like the brilliant actors James Mason, Maximilian Schell, Simone Signoret and Harriet Andersson, and watching the film was a totally mouth-watering prospect and I was more than a little surprised that it is not better known, as it is even better than the other famous spy theme subject, the 1974 spy novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy that was written by the British author John le Carr, which subsequently went onto critical acclaim with the 1979 TV miniseries based on the novel, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, then in 2011 we had the film based on the novel, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.

THE DEADLY AFFAIR is based on famed spy-novelist and actual MI6 employee John le Carr's first novel, Call for the Dead. The novel's protagonist is none other than the infamous George Smiley, a character featuring in many of John le Carr's most famous books, and funnily enough though, back in the mid-1960s George Smiley was not the near household name he is now, so in this film adaptation his name was changed to Charles Dobbs [James Mason].

When the film THE DEADLY AFFAIR opens up we get a stylised series of still frames, showing lovers silhouetted against a background of alternating coloured titled sequences and lays the foundation for a very different style of spy film and intrigue we are introduced to. The audience could be forgiven for a expecting a stylized James Bond type film, beyond these vibrant opening credits, which is accompanied by a bossa nova composed theme music, that was composed by Quincy Jones, and the images we get to view is very deceptive and also very sensual; especially the scene from which they are lifted, turns out to be not what we expected. Cut up and denuded of any dialogue, stained aphrodisiac pink and blue, and it reminded me of the kind of liaison that you would expect to see in a 007 type film and of course there are no women-paramours at the far side of the freeze frames, no massage with mink gloves, no Aston Martin car and definitely no Martini. Instead, the setting of the film THE DEADLY AFFAIR is a solemn and insensible London, patched of iconography and lived-in interiors, like the red Route Master buses, red BT Telephone Boxes, red Royal Mail pillar boxes and the Royal Shakespeare Company, and what Sidney Lumet describes in the special feature audio interview below, as the miserable London apartments, with their specific kind of light.

Eschewing the glamour era of the James Bond films, Sidney Lumets chilling and intelligent take on the spy thriller genre and presents a darkly sinister picture of Cold War intrigue, but laced with nail-biting excitement. Those helping James Mason prove that spying is totally shabby, shoddy business includes Harry Andrews, Roy Kinnear, Simone Signoret, Maximilian Schell and Lynn Redgrave, who give their best performance so far. But with this 1966 espionage drama sees James Mason playing ageing British Secret Service agent Charles Dobbs, who has suddenly stumbled onto a spy ring and has to investigate the truth behind a government employees apparent suicide.

THE DEADLY AFFAIR film opens with Government security officer Charles Dobbs [James Mason] meeting Foreign Office civil servant Samuel Fennan [Robert Flemyng] about an anonymous tip that had been received, claiming that Samuel Fennan had been, and may still be, a practising Communist. This doesn't seem to bother Samuel Fennan, as it was a long time in the past and Charles Dobbs put his mind at ease about the situation. However, Charles Dobbs receives a call early the next morning to say that Samuel Fennan committed suicide and a note he made out prior to this claimed he couldn't live with the situation. Most seem to accept this as a clear cut case, but Charles Dobbs refuses to believe that Samuel Fennan took his own life after the fairly relaxed conversation they'd had the day before. So he decides to investigate, even though he is forced to step down from his position due to the situation. Running alongside this, Charles Dobbs also struggles with his relationship with his wife Ann Dobbs [Harriet Andersson] as he can no longer stand by and let her openly cheat on him as he had for the last year or two.

THE DEADLY AFFAIR is an early example of the 'anti-spy' film, where the sexy heroics of James Bond and the like are eschewed for a relatively slow-moving, grim and unglamorous world of deception and information gathering. I liked this approach and the plot is well constructed, with several juicy twists never getting so complicated to lose track of what was happening. The characters are fascinating too, with Samuel Fennan's wife, Elsa Fennan [Simone Signoret], being a particularly interesting nut for Dobbs to crack. For the most part it's her cracking Charles Dobbs though, as she's a dark and seemingly controlling character who's difficult to second guess.

In the film THE DEADLY AFFAIR there are an assortment of renowned world cinema stars like Simone Signoret, Harriet Andersson and Maximilian Schell, who was Austrian, but worked largely in the USA and who all deliver the goods and a couple of underrated British character actors include Harry Andrews and Roy Kinnear, who definitely steal the few scenes they appear in the film and especially Harry Andrews is in more than a few, as he plays Charles Dobbs assistant/partner on the case. You even get a brief cameo from Lynn Redgrave and Corin Redgrave in a fun, low-rate, theatre rehearsal scene.

Speaking of fun, although much of the film THE DEADLY AFFAIR is very dark and occasionally rather bleak, there is much humour to be found in the sharp dialogue and interplay between the characters to keep things from getting too grim. The unusual situation between Charles Dobbs and his wife provides added depth and conflict within his character too, preventing the film from getting coldly focussed on the murder case alone.

Overall, THE DEADLY AFFAIR is a highly enjoyable and keeps you guessing right up to the end spy film, and a thoroughly gripping and generally faithful John le Carr adaptation. James Mason makes a great Smiley, and is even very believable when provoked to uncharacteristic violence at the finale part of the film. But also does a first rate job as a man grasping desperately at a professional conundrum in order to ignore a personal one  only to discover its impossible.

Blu-ray Image Quality  Powerhouse Films presents us the brilliant Blu-ray disc with a very atmospheric Technicolor 1080p image presentation and is helped even more with a very nice 1.85:1 aspect ratio viewing experience. The image quality shows a very pleasing layer of grain and the contrast which is impeccably layered. This is dual-layered Blu-ray disc. It is neither glossy nor pristinely sharp but shows Sidney Lumet's intentional dark, grey visuals and originally Sidney Lumet wanted to film in in black-and-white. Sidney  Lumet described the film image as colourless colour and was using a process called flashing  as described by Michael Brooke in the audio commentary. There are some splashes of red, like the phone boxes, roses etc., that tend to stand out really well with this HD image presentation. So all in all, the image is extremely accurate. It looks very clean, consistent and film-like. This Blu-ray offers a rewarding and authentic dour presentation in 1080p.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Powerhouse Films presents us with two audio presentations of 1.0 LPCM Mono Audio and 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo. The audio is transferred via a linear 1.0 LPCM is authentically mono. There is modest depth in the infrequent effects. The film's music is notable for the score by Quincy Jones and a theme music Who Needs Forever is credited as being sung by Astrud Gilberto. It supports the film a gently jazzy, Bosa-Nova theme, which gives it a nice edge to the tension of the film, but to some critics they felt it slightly dates the film, but for me personally I feel it adds to the style and substance to this brilliant spy film genre. But overall it is a really very pleasant audio presentation that suits the style of the film set in 1960s era and there are no traces of any damage, background hiss or fluff to the sound presentation.

Audio commentary with Film Historians Michael Brooke and Johnny Mains: Here we are first introduced to Michael Brooke, who informs us that he is a film critic and a film historian and regularly writes articles regular for the publication Sight and Sound, which is a British monthly film magazine published by the British Film Institute. Next to introduce themselves is Johnny Mains, who informs us that he is an award winning editor, author, horror historian and also writes notes for DVD releases. They team up for a very nice and interesting running audio commentary for the film THE DEADLY AFFAIR, which is so crammed with amazing information and of course their personal opinion, I had to keep on having to pause to make substantial notes. They inform us that the actor James Mason hated the title of the film, especially because it had the word DEAD in it. We are informed that this film had different titles in other countries like Call Of The Dead, The Kiss of Danger, MI5 Requires Protection, The Spy of London, The Spy Must Die and The Suicide Case. They both talk about the specific colour process of the film and its look, and the director Sidney Lumet wanted to shoot the film in black-and-white, but Columbia Pictures always insisted that their films must always be filmed in colour and again for the cinematographer Frederick A. Young, OBE, B.S.C. (Director of Photography)to get the effect he wanted to achieve Frederick A. Young went about pre-exposing the colour film negative against a white card to give small controlled amount of light (known as ""flashing"" or ""pre-fogging"") in order to create a muted colour palette was first used in this film, and again the director Sidney Lumet called the result ""colourless colour"" and so it was a good compromise and everyone was happy with the results, and in the process when you got to see objects of the red colour it really stood out very predominately, but equally what was not successful is when seeing the red colour of blood, as it was not a success in the film image result. When you get to Chapter 3 at around 23:00 Michael Brooke and Johnny Mains warns us that hopefully you have viewed the film first before venturing with this audio commentary, as there is a very strong clue given away, especially with the actress Simone Signoret who without realising it, nearly gives the game away in revealing a hidden dark secret. When you get to Chapter 6 at around 55:00, you get to the scene where James Mason is in his hospital bed after getting a serious assault and is talking to Harry Andrews, and Michael Brooke and Johnny Mains mention at the side of his bed is the wooden cupboard and you just get a quick glimpse of a Penguin paperback book and is supposed to be James Masons own personal copy, which is entitled Theres A Porpoise Close Behind Us and is  written by Noel Langley and it is a novel about Londons gay theatrical life in the 1930s and is extremely open about gay life in the theatre and Noel Langley was a successful novelist, playwright, screenwriter and director and was under contract to M-G-M and was one of the screenwriters for The Wizard of Oz film. Noel Langley also did the screenplays for the following films Scrooge [1951], The Pickwick Papers [1952], Ivanhoe [1952] and the Technicolor film The Prisoner of Zenda [1952]. Michael Brooke and Johnny Mains give great praise with regards to the actor Harry Andrews who they feel gave his best performance so far for this film, because they feel he has a great face for his character and portrayal of a retired policeman. As we get near the end of this amazing audio commentary and the scene where James Mason finally meet the traitor spy, and who shoots Harry Andrews, we see how good the NHS plaster cast is for the 1960s that James Mason has, and they mention how strong it was to be used as a weapon against the spy traitor, and they warn us that the scene we witness has to be one of the most brutal ending to a persons life, especially for a spy film and good ending where everything has been tied up with all the loose ends and false trails running throughout the film. As we finally get to the end of the film, where James Mason lands in Zurich and is greeted by his estranged wife, Michael Brooke and Johnny Mains comment on how they rate this Sidney Lumet film, and also comment that it is not a masterpiece, and a slightly underrated film especially with critics, but they feel it is still up there with the best spy film genre that have been released over the years, and I personally think it is a totally brilliant very subtle spy film that more people should get to view, that is very clever at keeping you guessing right up to the end of the final climax of the film, and Michael Brooke and Johnny Mains also say that this film generally gets passed over and has been over the years been released in several video format releases, and has been very poorly presented, whereas this INDICATOR Blu-ray release is I feel the best that has ever been released since the film was released. As the words the end appear on the screen, both Michael Brooke and Johnny Mains say, well thank you all for you for listening to this audio commentary right to the end, and we have enjoyed doing it, and it is us both signing off. Of all the fine extras that has been included on a Blu-ray disc, this is probably the most detailed, essential and fascinating audio commentary I have heard in a very long time and we want more of this type of very professional audio commentary.

Special Feature: The Guardian Lecture with Sidney Lumet [89:00] Before the audio interview starts, we get the following information: This lecture was conducted by Derek Malcolm at the National Film Theatre, London in 1983. The following audio presentation exhibits a range of technical problems, which are to be expected from a recording of its age and type. Abrupt dropouts in the source recordings have been left intact. Its importance was a unique archival document makes its inclusion here essential. We hope you agree. While you hear the audio presentation, the film is being shown at the same time, like you viewed with the audio commentary. As the interview progresses, Sidney Lumet, who directed THE DEADLY AFFIR barely gets a mention here, which would have been a welcome inclusion, whereas Derek Malcolm visits a number of key films from Sidney Lumet's illustrious film career, although a sizeable chunk of the interview is devoted to the film release of Prince of the City. Sidney Lumet is considerate and detailed in his response to questions from the host interviewer Derek Malcolm and also the audience, and even helpfully repeats or summarises audience questions that I could not quite make out, as once again they don't allow a microphone to be handed to each person who asks a question, despite the best efforts of the audience asking the questions. There is a lot of ground covered with this interview, especially when Sidney Lumet talks about the film industry in general, especially when a film is released in America in the first week, and if it does not make the required financial revenue, the film is kicked into the long grass and they feel it is not worth releasing the fil in Europe. At the time of the recording, Sidney Lumet talks about the state of America in the 1980s and feels total despair. It was very interesting to hear that Sidney Lumet counts the films The Offence, The Seagull and The Wiz amongst his very favourite  own films, but feels that the film 12 Angry Men believes is as close to perfect as a film can. All in all this was a really interesting audio track that is well worth to listen to.

Special Feature: The National Film Theatre Lecture with James Mason [47:49] Before the audio interview starts, we get the following information: This archival audio recording was conducted by Leslie Hardcastle at the National Film Theatre in 1967, London. The following audio presentation exhibits a range of technical problems, which are to be expected from a recording of its age and type. Abrupt dropouts in the source recordings have been left intact. Its importance was a unique archival document makes its inclusion here essential. We hope you agree. While you hear the audio presentation, the film is being shown at the same time, like you viewed with the audio commentary. This audio recording of James Mason on the stage is interviewed in front of a very enthusiastic audience, where James Mason delivers a hugely entertaining and totally hilarious monologue on the journey from childhood to becoming a top billing actor, a profession he describes early on as ""a bad lot."" There are questions from Leslie Hardcastle and from the audience, all of which James Mason answers with a most engaging blend of honesty and good humour. James Mason describes what acting is all about and likens it to how children like to show off and play act in their own way, especially acting out their fantasies and that is basically what actors like to do, in not portraying real life, especially on the stage, but not so much in films. James Mason is asked what Director did he really like to work with and was also easy to work with and first on James Masons list is Carol Reed, who he really adored. The most stimulating director to work with was Stanley Kubrick. At Chapter 4 at around 41:44 we have a slight break from the interview, where Leslie Caron comes onto the stage to present James Mason with the Alexander Kordar Star Award and Leslie Caron despite being very shy, gives a very nice and eloquent little speech, and on receiving this award, also gives a nice little speech and also comments that he likes receiving presents. So just after that this audio presentation finishes. So to sum up, this audio presentation I would say that is definitely is all in all a really fascinating and totally interesting audio track, and I personally could have listened to James Mason so much longer, as he speaks very eloquent and is also very fascinating to listen to and I am sure he has lots of other anecdotes and especially funny stories he would of informed us if they had let the lecture go on much longer and is definitely a winner and well worth listening to.

Special Feature: A Different Kind of Spy: Paul Dehns Deadly Affair [2017] [1080p] [1.78:1] [16:52] Here writer David Kipen [Author of The Schreiber Theory] discusses the life and work of screenwriter Paul Dehn, where David Kipen informs us that Paul Dehns uncle once said to him, Always work three times as hard on the first paragraph of anything you write, then any other paragraph and then you should cut the first paragraph, which David Kipen says, which makes kind of interesting when you look at the beginning of Paul Dehns films, because obviously they have been laboured over and they work as well. David Kipen also informs us that in World War Two Paul Dehn becomes an instructor of spies in a facility in Canada entitled CAMP X and the author Ian Fleming and the actor Christopher lee were some of his pupils and schools them in the delicate arts of espionage and counter espionage, and if trusted, he schools then in the art of assassination. Over time Paul Dehn felt very guilty, and eventually was recruited as an undercover war time British agent for a time. After the war Paul Dehn becomes a different kind of spy, by becoming a brilliant screenwriter of the best kind for the film industry. David Kipen then goes onto informs us of some of the brilliant screenplay he did for the following plethora of films, which includes Seven Days to Noon [1950]; Orders to Kill [1958]; Goldfinger [1964]; The Spy Who Came in from the Cold [1965]; The Deadly Affair [1966]; The Taming of the Shrew [1967]; Beneath the Planet of the Apes [1970]; Fragment of Fear [1970]; Escape from the Planet of the Apes [1971]; Conquest of the Planet of the Apes [1972]; Battle for the Planet of the Apes [1973] and Murder on the Orient Express [1974]. Paul Dehn sadly passed away on 30th September, 1976 and left a legacy of films that surely he was very proud of and gave us audiences brilliant scripts that made the films mentioned an enjoyable experience and also enjoyable was David Kipen who was a joy to hear his views on the screenwriter Paul Dehn.

Special Feature: Take One and Move On [2017] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:58] Here we have a brand New interview with camera operator Brian West on the film THE DEADLY AFFAIR. Brian West informs us that he is very proud of the work he did on all his films he worked on, especially the film THE DEADLY AFFAIR. Brian also was very impressed with the author John le Carr and admires all of his books, and has nearly read all of them, but especially the spy novels. Brian talks about the cinematographer Frederick A. Young, OBE, B.S.C. (Director of Photography), who wanted the film to look a certain style, by forcing the negative to look very grainy, and Sidney Lumet really loved the look of the image he viewed of the film THE DEADLY AFFAIR and felt the overall shoot was really good experience. When you see the scene at the Victoria Bus Station in London where the actress Simone Signoret gets off the bus, Sidney Lumet put Brian and the camera on his lap in a wheelchair, and then Sidney Lumet wheeled Brian about for the tracing shots following the actors, and Brian says that Sidney Lumet was a very inventive director and Sidney Lumet really only liked to do once take and then likes to move onto the next shot, and all in all Brian really liked working with Sidney Lumet and especially on  THE DEADLY AFFAIR and also likes to now and again watch the film, which of course brings back many happy memories, especially with shooting the film and with working with the director Sidney Lumet. Despite this being a very short special feature, it was a joy to hear Brian talk about his time in the film industry and I could have listened to Brian a lot longer, as I bet he has loads of other very interesting stories relating to his work in the film industry.

Special Feature: Lumet's London: The Locations of THE DEADY AFFAIR [2017] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:03] Here we get to explore the many different Central London locations of THE DEADLY AFFAIR film, which are as follows: St James Park, SW1, that has Buckingham Palace in the background; Grosvenor Street, SW1; St Georges Square, Pimlico, SW1; Victoria Coach Station, SW1 and with Victoria Station left of the screen in the background; Trafalgar Square, WC2, where the bus is heading down Whitehall; Aldwych Theatre, WC2, which was the London home of the Royal Shakespeare Company 1958  1982; Vanbrugh Theatre, WC1, which is at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art; Serpentine Restaurant, Hyde park, W2, which was demolished in 1990; Walmar House, Regent Street, W1 and was redeveloped in 2014. Next we move onto London locations in the Chelsea and Battersea areas, which are as follows: The Balloon Tavern, SW10, which is now the Lots Road Pub and Dining Room; Cremorne Road, SW10; Chelsea Harbour, SW10 and in the distance you can see the Battersea bridge; Lombard Road, Battersea, SW11, where you see them drive past Archer House and at the same time you see a small window video on the left of the screen what the area looks today; Lots Road Power Station, SW10.

Theatrical Trailer [1966] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:33] This is the original Theatrical Trailer for the film THE DEADLY AFFAIR. For some unknown reason, you have an American doing the voice over and also it is only shown in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio.

Special Feature: Image Gallery [2017] [1080p] Here we get to view 26 brilliant colour and black-and-white Original Promotional Material stills, including behind-the-scenes images, posters and even the album cover of Quincy Jones film score for the film THE DEADLY AFFAIR.

BONUS: Limited edition exclusive 32-page booklet featuring a 2017 newly commissioned writing by Thirza Wakefield entitled KEEP THE HOME FIRES BURNING. Also a 2017 article entitled JUST MAKE IT MARVELLOUS, FREDDIE! By Gary Crowdus. Also included is JAMES MASON ON THE DEADLY AFFAIR where Martha Deane interviews James Mason in 1967 for the broadcast programme on WOP Radio, New York and includes extracts and discussions on the film THE DEADLY AFFAIR. The other article of interest is THE DEADLY AFFAIR CRITICAL RESPONSE. Other sundries include ABOUT THE PRESENTATION; SPECIAL THANKS and ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS. You also get to view lots of black-and-white images from the film and also other rare publicity photos.

Finally, THE DEADLY AFFAIR [1966] overall is a very solid, entertaining spy thriller that is full of twists and turns and is typical of John le Carr's work. It's a little rough around the edges, but James mason certain makes the film worth watching for his sterling performance and to give the film its 1960s atmosphere we have the brilliant music score by Quincy Jones. This is another good find from the company Indicator and Powerhouse Films, who has released this exclusive United Kingdom Blu-ray disc. The exclusive booklet is as strong as ever too and shouldn't be ignored in favour of the video extras. Highly Recommended!

8228892,4,B000XP2TVU,"I debated between four and five stars if nothing else because this is what I will attempt to define as a Hybrid American Film Noir. It is a decent attempt in the direction of film noir by mainstream producers, however, there is still that bit of cartoon-esque vibe that this genre projects, especially when the French police is involved.
Then there is Simone Signoret, and James Mason playing what he knew best: inner struggle.
 We've evolved so much so fast in cinema that it is difficult to compare apples to apples. Granted, technical upgrades won't make up for poor acting nor mediocre writing but it does help getting it all wrapped up in a more enticing package.
Writing was good, tying up the plot nicely through scenes, I would have like to sympathize more with the main character, meaning, there were one or two missing opporutnitites to understand James Mason's character better.",1511740800,,889,4.848684210526316

After more than half a century, the acting, directing, filming and sound engineering continues to transform the viewer to a voyeur peering into the private life of perfect strangers. Quincy Jones' soundtrack is both apt and moving, providing a magical atmosphere. An outstanding effort by James Mason makes this his most memorable and moving performance.
