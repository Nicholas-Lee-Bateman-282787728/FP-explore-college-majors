This DVD has made me aware that my approach to everyday activities affects my posture.  It provides great tips that help me change my daily habits, correcting my posture which in turn reduces my pain!  The stretches provided are simple, clearly demonstrated, require very little equipment and can easily be done at home.  Even more importantly they are working for me!

Using the information on this DVD, I know that I can continue to become stronger and more self reliant as I become older!  I can definitely recommend this DVD to both young and old!",1405987200,,685,4.565573770491803
8662480,5,B00KXFRDDY,"As a firefighter I spend several hours of inactivity. That inactivity gets interrupted and replaced with an intense, high-paced, and stress-filled task that is usually very demanding both physically and mentally. Usually before a strenuous workout we warm up in order to reduce the risk of injury. However when the tones drop we do not have the luxury of stretching or warming up before getting to work. This DVD shows you how to not only improve your physical health and alleviate aches and pains, but how to change the way you do even the smallest things such as how to sit, how to work in the kitchen, basically how to modify your behavior. This DVD can improve your way of life. Must watch!!",1405123200,,695,4.658536585365853

I sit at my computer and write--a lot--and because I am not always thinking about my posture when I'm working, because I forget I even have a body sometimes, this DVD has been so helpful. Ive learned to do the exercises before I work, and when Im really really good, I do them a second time when I finish working for the day. When I don't, when I forget or just get too busy, the pain in my shoulders and neck reminds just how important these exercises are.  They are simple, easy to remember, and they work!",1404000000,,618,4.237288135593221
