3936686,5,B002IO5KNS,"As a life long fan of TP, I was hoping that there were a at least 1 or a few copies of a TP Live during the 80's... After reading most of the reviews Douglas gave a very indepth one!! I still had to get a copy of this one! Therefore I do thank SHOUT for their efforts!
If anyone wanted to google what a soul singer is....should be directed to TP singing Love TKO!!  Wow....you can almost feel his pain!  This is truly a must own DVD!! Great price and the video is pretty well done.  My only issue with SHOUT is as previously stated...why did they ""butcher"" it up??  Adding the bonus songs should have been in the concert!!! You can see from background and outfits where the same....I will give this a 5 STAR Rating because not many of concerts exist of live TP besides the 79 one.....so get it..enjoy it!!",1309910400,8,805,4.207792207792208

3936688,5,B002IO5KNS,"Teddy Pendergrass is a soul music legend! This concert is better than the ""79"" concert because most of his slow jam classics are on this concert! His vocals are Teddy! He like most of our soul singers of that time could SANG! Woman used to throw panties, room keys amongst other things on the stage to him! The band is great, the musical selection is good, the filming of the concert is better than average considering when it was recorded! He sounds as good live as he did on record! A must have!",1305590400,4,497,4.354838709677419

3936690,2,B002IO5KNS,"In the 25-plus years I have owned the VHS copy of the magnificent concert Teddy Pendergrass Live in London, I have watched it between 600-700 times. For Teddy Pendergrass fans, the original version of this tremendous concert is a must. But the Shout Factory's version is little more than a butchered up rendition of a masterpiece. Since I know the concert so intimately, as few others do, I immediately noticed that the outfit Teddy is wearing on the cover of the DVD is not the same one he wore during this performance. A red flag went up. As I, for example, have purchased a Harold Melvin and The Bluenotes DVD that featured Teddy on the cover, only to discover he was nowhere to be found on any of the songs contained therein. This type of bait-and-switch is far too common in the music world.

In spite of this (after all, if this were the only mistake the Shout Factory made in re-issuing the footage, I would not have minded as much), I eagerly anticipated having a DVD version of the concert as a backup. But my keen eye noticed something else amiss when I saw the concert advertised on the Amazon site. The Product Description stated, ""Performing hits from his four platinum albums Teddy Pendergrass..."" At the time, Teddy had five platinum albums. In fact, in the concert, itself, Teddy thanks the audience - while holding up five fingers - for making his most recent album his fifth consecutive platinum album. Additionally, the Product Decsription lists songs from the concert, then adds 3 bonus tracks. I was curious about this because the original tape contained no bonus tracks. Upon examining the three songs, I noticed that they were all a part of the original concert. In fact, they were an integral part of the concert.

Nevertheless, I hurried out in a blistering storm to purchase the DVD.  Despite the errors noted above, the concert was historic not only for its brilliance, but because it was Teddy's magnum opus. It represented him at the peak of his tremendous powers. Furthermore, it is significant because it was his last concert tour before the tragic car accident, a month later, that would leave him a quadriplegic.

I was in heaven. No longer would I have to worry about my delicate VHS tape breaking, thus losing one of my most prized possessions. Now, I had it all. Unfortunately, my joy was short-lived. The sound quality could not hold a candle to that of my VHS copy. Teddy's voice on the VHS tape soars and his voice has a rich depth to it that is absent from the DVD version. But my strongest criticism is reserved for whoever thought to cut the original three songs from the performance and add them in as bonus footage. Teddy liked to use his songs to tell stories in his concerts. Therefore, he carefully selected not only the songs, but the order in which he sang them. By excising the three songs and pasting them elsewhere, the Shout Factory has not only supplanted Teddy as the teller of the story, but has ruined a masterpiece.

I was greatly disappointed that the Shout Factory did not digitally remaster the DVD to improve its sound quality. In addition, the video quality is poor. In the three ""bonus footage"" tracks, it is abysmal. Could this be why they the Shout Factory deleted them from the main body? This DVD has all the markings of something someone found in his/her basement and transferred it to a DVD, while destroying it with horrific editing. It appears to be a hastily conceived project, designed to make someone some fast money. If this is so, it is a shame. Accuracy should always be strived for. That is minimum goal. But when it comes to a concert of this magnitude and significance, the only thing that those reissuing the DVD should do is enhance the picture and sound and, if they are going to ""add"" bonus material, make it true bonus material, not some bogus material. (Bogus because it was not bonus material, it was contained in the original concert.) The only noble thing for the Shout Factory to do is to take this off of the market and restore this masterpiece to its original splendor.

However, I am mindful of the Teddy fans that would enjoy this DVD despite it many flaws. Thus, I know they would enjoy the DVD. It's just that they would have been awed by the original. And the fault in no way lies with the great Teddy Pendergrass. (See my review of his 1979 DVD.)",1302998400,54,4345,4.607235142118863
3936691,5,B002IO5KNS,"There is no question that Teddy live in London - 1982 is simply the best Teddy concert ever recorded on video!  There were VHS copies out there..but sadly they have disappeared.  The 1979 concert is not bad, but it does not include all his greatest hits, as does the London 1982 concert.  Fantastic, Teddy at his best!  Yet we seem to be offered lackluster substitutes..like the Valentine's Day concert recorded after his accident when he was confined to the wheelchair.
Music legends like Teddy deserve to have their best performances released on DVD for historical purposes at least and certainly for the decades of adoring fans who loved their music!",1286841600,5,653,4.909090909090909

3936696,4,B002IO5KNS,"This is a DVD with Teddy Pendergrass singing live in concert from 1982, the same year of Teddy's car accident. I would say that I pretty much would want to know and remember Teddy Pendergrass from this era, being that he is missed. I also like the look that Teddy had from this era singing his early greatest hits live on stage, and that's how I would want to know and remember him. It is known that Teddy Pendergrass passed away in 2010, and this concert brings back memories of him singing live on stage. I really wish Teddy had stayed the same like this until he passed away, instead of who he was after his car accident. So this is something that I would pretty much watch with Teddy singing.",1455580800,,696,4.320610687022901

Well, you found a way to do it, mostly due to the extremely poor sound quality of the recording.

3936728,3,B002IO5KNS,"I can understand Mr Douglas's concern about this DVD...But what are you going to do if they don't have any other Live Concert of him except for the Live Concert in'79...First of all I thought the concert was a good Concert under the circumstance it being over 30 years old. And at least you can see and hear his gr8 talent to me it's better to have this than nothing at all. Because it's a shame that they don't release or they don't have Concert footage of the entertainers back in the day. Over all I'm happy with this Concert because I still can enjoy Teddy Pendergrass doing his thing. The Concert in Lake Tahoe in '79 is a gr8 gr8 Concert I luvvvvvvvvv it I play it all the time, and be honest with you I like it better than the '82 Concert but they both will get a Lot of Love from me. ...It's so sad they haven't release any of Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson, Marvin Gaye, Otis Redding, Billy Stewart, Temptations, Marvelettes, just to name of few. I missed all the Gr8 Entertainers.

3936732,4,B002IO5KNS,"Teddy used to tear it down and does so on this concert. Considering the time of it's recording you don't hear the cheers or the adulation from the audience as you can from today's audiences with today's upgraded concert recording capabilities. The sound isn't bad but if you're an avid DVD concert viewer you will miss the full out digital surround sound that concert footage has today. All I can say is this concert was good old fashioned jammin', artistry, Charisma and fun to watch. He's not a dancer but I dare anyone say he could not blow a mean tune and it made all that more entertaining to watch him attempt to get down when feeling the music. I seem to remember this concert being played on television...HBO maybe, years ago and it wasn't chopped up like it is on this DVD. It's not bad but if something is done other than the way you've seen it it's noticeable, so the line up of some of the songs seem off to me. Maybe it's just my knowing I'd seen it before. This is the only reason I can't give it 5 stars. I would have loved to see it in it's original format. Changing it I think was a mistake. All in all a good concert plain and simple. Old fashion jams, great vocals, charisma and talent. I may be a little biased because I grew up on these sounds but the youngin's who enjoy old school will enjoy it just the same I think.

3936741,4,B002IO5KNS,"Considering this Reviewers long-lasting fanship for James Brown, it's tough to enter the review title - but JB' s Disco-Soul entries for '76 to '80, impressive as they are (EYESIGHT, IT'S TOO FUNKY IN HERE, etc.), were sometimes lacking in coherence and by the end of the decade, sounded like they were mised for Seame Street. TP's tunes were a perfect blend of Soukl and Disco, and now, 30 years later, even some real rapp was woven into the shimmering fabric. Furyher refelction shows that Pendergrast really picked up the torch from the early '70s smooth Soul-Pop artists like Al Greene and Barry White.
All three are super stylists (somewhat limited ocative range compensated with astonishing honesty and sensuality).

This is a real love letter to Teddy's female fans, as the romance is emphasized. especially on LADY, TURN OFF THE LIGHTS, and COME ON TO MY PLACE. The dynamic singer does his whisper to a holler thing, and sweats, sweats, sweats. (""Let's shower together"" - screams). Male fans can pick up a few pointers.

The finale is a large group of children singing REACH OUT AND TOUCH SOMEBODY'S HAND. It's not very good, musically, and all mushiness aside, it's pplacement in the setlist is just a little strange: the women in the front row must restrain themselves from reaching out and touching Teddy's leg, while the kiddies chant. oxygenyeprogram/show
