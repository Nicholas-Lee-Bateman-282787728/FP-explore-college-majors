8387407,5,B0032BZXQK,Not much of a fan of Jorge Ortiz de Pinedo but I have to say I bought this DVD for my niece while on vacation in Mexico and the entire family was glued to the TV.  Very funny and unique characters and situations.  The nieces haven't been able to let it go. Going on several weeks now. I recommend it and I'm not too easy to please. Spanish language so if you're going to depend on subtitles it may lose the comedy factor through translation.,1277856000,,441,4.176470588235294
