277101,2,6300251748,"OK, first thing - why is this the ""Crater Lake"" monster? The lake is OBVIOUSLY not THE Crater Lake of Oregon. It's a long, narrow lake, nothing remotely ""crater-ish"" about it. But that's nit-picking compared to the rest.
Ed Wood on his WORST DAY didn't have continuity problems like this. It isn't just the old ""day/night"" problem, either - at one point, a character mentions that SIX MONTHS have gone by since the beginning of the film! (It looked more like 2-3 long days - at most.) But yes, we do have people staring up at the sunny sky and commenting on all the beautiful stars. Over half of the film is devoted to two complete imbeciles and their ""funny"" antics. Believe me, you will BEG for the monster to eat them both. Soon. You will never, EVER, see acting as wooden and clueless as this - the entire cast is totally, hopelessly inept, untalented, clueless and painful to watch. Oh, and all of the men in the movie are going bald, and they seem to WANT to show you their bald pates. What the...?
Scared yet? No? OK, we have a completely pointless diversion with a derelict of some sort. He's sitting in his decrepit, rancid home, and decides to make a booze run. He goes to the local Quicky-Mart and takes a pint to the register, pulls out a gun, and shoots the cashier and a customer. Why? And he just takes the pint! Later, there's a slo-mo ""O.J.-style"" chase so the killer can be eaten by the monster. By then, you will probably have forgotten who this guy was, but that's alright, because he has NO OTHER ROLE to play than monster-chow. Pure padding.
The monster may be one of the last of the stop-motion dinosaurs, but it's a long long way from Harryhausen. Downhill, that is. And the NON stop-motion shots of the head are side-splitting - it's just absolutely eye-rollingly pathetic.
BELIEVE me, I could go on and on. So why 2 stars? I simply can't recall ever seeing SO many problems with a movie. It isn't PAINFUL (much), and if I were teaching any film classes, I would certainly insist on showing this as a comprehensive, all-inclusive omnibus of scripting, directing, acting, and filming shortcomings, bobbles, knee-slappers, howlers, wildly excessive padding, musical mis-cues and general incompetence. I'd say it has a very high MST-ability quotient, but the cheese-movie neophyte is warned - this MAY result in permanent damage.",1032998400,13,2351,4.681159420289855

Resolution and sound suck ... but this is a grand example of the low-budget, low-talent horror flicks of the day. I bought it because I love these films and I live near Crater Lake, Oregon ... unfortunately the real Crater Lake doesn't appear in the film.

277146,3,6300251748,"OK so bad it's pretty bad horror/sci-fi 1977 flick.  A dinosaur (plesiosaur) hatches from a dormant egg after a meteor hits the title lake and heats up the water.  Its presence remains a secret for months to all except to its fodder; lake fish, cattle, and whichever human passerby it comes across.  FINALLY the sheriff and local scientists wake up and sluggishly take action.
Now, the title Crater Lake is NOT the renowned lake of the Northwest.  It looks like any lake in the boonies of Anywhere, USA.  The scenery isn't bad though.  The actors are, I believe, primarily local non-talent.  The acting is pretty lousy.  When the film is not on the creature's antics, which is rarely shown, it is mainly focused on two sub-mental rubes who rent boats.  Ye gods that's boring.

277165,2,6300251748,"Hmmm Not sure about the ending.  The rest was on par for a corny b-rated movie.  Crater Lake looked more like Lake Michigan, the acting was on par with a 4th grade play, the music was straight out of a 1970 porn movie, and the special effects consisted of what looked like a burning match thrown across the screen in an attempt to look like a meteor.

The film has a few main characters, but then introduces people to be quick episodes. The humor is corny and there is humor by design, but not nearly as much as the MST quality monster. The type of humor we are exposed to is when the two town idiots argue over a sign ""Bait, motors, tacle"" and complain that Bait is spelled Bate.

277172,2,6300251748,"This movie has some serious problems.  You have to start with the monster of Crater Lake Monster, as he is just laughably bad in appearance.  It's amazing how the stop action effects in the original King Kong can look so good while those same effects are just terrible here.  This monster couldn't even get a job on the Land of the Lost series - they told him he was just too silly-looking.  Then you have the filmmakers' complete incomprehension of time.  You can't just film scenes during the middle of the day and then expect us to accept them as night scenes just because someone talks about how dark it is out that night.  It gets worse than that, though.  Everything in this story obviously takes place over a couple of days, yet at one point a character talks about six months having passed since all the trouble began.  Throw horrible editing into the mix, as well.  Two guys are soaking wet one minute and bone dry the next, one guy is seen with a toboggan, a hat, and a bare head - all in one scene; etc.  Oh, it is to laugh - and believe me, laughter is the only thing you're going to get out of this movie.

The fun all starts with some archaeologists discovering some remarkably well preserved ancient cave drawings in an abandoned mine.  Upon seeing one image depicting two guys throwing sticks at a large animal, one scientist declares that it is absolute proof that man and dinosaur actually did cohabit the planet at some point.  Strangely enough, a meteorite chooses that very moment to crash into a nearby lake, and the heat it generates under water causes a long-dormant dinosaur egg to hatch.  That's bad news for the already terrible boat renting business of two local rubes (who will serve as your comic relief for the evening).  As dumb as these two guys are, they were occasionally funny, and I must say their presence helped me get through the thoroughly useless subplots, bad acting, inept storytelling, and ludicrous conclusion that define this altogether poor attempt at filmmaking.  I really don't know why the guys at MST3K never took this movie on (although it has been given the Rifftrax treatment), as it seems tailor-made for unlimited riffing.",1351123200,,2179,4.650130548302872

277204,5,6300251748,"Now, while watching this movie, I was a little skeptical. The reviews on it were none to pleasent, and it showed little promise. I rented it and spent the night watching this little gem. The film opens with a group of people exploring a cave. In the cave they see strange drawings depicting Native Americans fighting a large, plesiosaur like monster. But during the find, a large meteor crashes into crater lake nearby, causing an earthquake, and the cave caves in with the people just barely escaping.
The meteor was horribly done, but it sparked a great sense of enjoyment that only true B-movie fans can feel.
Throughout the film, several strange things happen (people going missing, livestock dead, the like) and our sheriff does what he can to find out whats going on. We later find out that the meteor had heated the mud at the bottom of the lake which still held a plesiosaur egg. The mud had been cold enough to preserve the egg until the meteor incubated it into hatching. A classic Sci-fi dinosaur movie plot. The creature goes on the rampage, and the stopmotion is pretty likeable! When we are not seeing the creature, (which is more often then not) we are with the scientists from the cave, the sheriff, or two goofy characters named Arnie and Mitch. These two may be stupid at times, but they pack their own ""Three Stooges"" punch, making them likeable characters. If you are a fan of the following, you do not want to miss this film:

277205,3,6300251748,This movie is not as bad as many of my fellow reviewers have wtitten. Yes the movie suffers from wooden acting and scripting. However it does have its charms. The comedy relief while often unfunny does have its moments. The stop motion dinosaur is good and there is more shots of it than I would expect in a movie this cheap. I liked this movie and think that it was worth the $6.50 or so that I paid for a used copy on Amazon.,1325548800,,427,4.095238095238095
277206,3,6300251748,"Featuring stop-action special effects, The Crater Lake Monster (1977) has a look similar to a creature feature from the late 50's.  The simplistic plot is pretty far out, and some of the acting is a bit stiff, but if you are in the right frame of mind, the film does have some entertainment value.  David W. Allen's stop action work, reminiscent of Ray Harryhausen, may be the most interesting aspect of this film, although it occasionally features some decent cinematography, and provides a few laughs.

A meteor crashes into Crater Lake, in Oregon.  Coming to rest on the bottom, the meteorite emits a great deal of heat, warming up a long lost dinosaur egg and causing it to hatch.  The creature looks like a plesiosaur, a dinosaur that can swim, and has fins similar to a seal.  Over time it grows quite large, eating most of the fish in the lake.  Seeking a new source of food, the dinosaur attacks boats in the lake, and crawls ashore to grab a bite to eat.

When human remains turn up at the lake, Sheriff Hanson (Richard Cardella) attempts to close it down, but Arnie (Glenn Roberts) and Mitch (Mark Siegel), two goofy guys who are partners in a boat rental business, still allow a couple to take a boat out on the lake, with almost disastrous results.  When Hanson sees the monster for himself, his scientist friends amazingly come up with a theory to explain the creature's presence.

The special effects budget probably limits how much we see of the dinosaur, who stays concealed until near the end, where it appears in its full glory for a battle with an earthmover.  The Crater Lake Monster is not a very well made film, the acting isn't great, the special effects are pedestrian even for 1977, and the movie is padded with some mostly extraneous action scenes.  With all that, the film will still have a certain charm for some.  It scores points mainly for nostalgia value, and for making something half decent with very little to work with, as the dinosaur here is a long way from Harryhausen's fighting skeleton men in Jason and the Argonauts, which was made in way back in 1963.

The Crater Lake Monster has recently been released on Bluray, as a double feature with the science fiction adventure Galaxina (1980).  The print has some signs of dirt, but the film looks quite decent in high definition.  Even if you have no interest in Galaxina, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Galaxina-Crater-Lake-Monster-Double-Feature-Blu-ray/dp/B004HHX9IM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Galaxina / Crater Lake Monster- Double Feature- [Blu-ray</a>] would probably be the preferred way to view this movie.",1324252800,,2650,5.02974828375286
277207,2,6300251748,"A dinosaur egg lays frozen at the bottom of Crater Lake.  One day a meteor falls into the lake, heating the water, incubating the egg, and VOILA....there's a rampaging dinosaur on the loose!  Plotwise it's got all the fixins for a cheap and fun monster movie.  The unfortunate thing is that the fun is missing.
The movie does seem to be a kind of tribute the monster movies of the 50s, but Tremors it isn't.  The dinosaur itself is stop motion animation and the close up head shots are a big plaster looking thing.  I certainly have no problem with these things, I love that kind of stuff.  It just seems like too much screen time is devoted to these two nitwits who rent out boats.  They're played for comic relief and this might have worked if they were actually funny and not simply irritating.

277208,5,6300251748,"Some people miss the point with some things.

For example, with the two brothers who obviously not very bright, but their development is deeper than that. In the senes with them, its obvious that one is basicaly immoral, willing to do almost anything to get money, while the other objects to his brother being immoral, but he's obviously scared enough of his brother not to do anything about it most of the time.

Also, the robber who appears in one scene and kills this people almost turns the thing into a ""novie"", in other words, a movie that is almost like a novel, because it has other things going on besides the main plotline.

Sites made by people who are actually honest and research things have noted that the claymation was good for its time, even if the people writing these articles didn't like the movie itself. I agree with them simply because, aside from the fact that they research these things (more often than not by watching other, simpilar movies) I really don't care that much about special effects. CGI might not have existed when this movie was made, but I'm still happy there's no CGI in it because CGI is beyond horrible.

The only remotely bad thing about this movie that I can see is that when one of the female victims is running from the monster, she gets a relatively far distance from it and collapses against some wrocks, THEN she starts screaming hysterically.

Still, this movie can't really be blamed for that because at this point there were a lot of movies with at least one female victim who screamed hysterically when she was in danger.",1157241600,3,1576,4.614285714285714
277209,2,6300251748,"""The Crater Lake Monster"" is a movie that reeks in so many dimensions that it really becomes difficult to criticize simply because it's hard to decide where to start. Other reviewers have summarized the plot (such as it is) nicely, so I will dispense with that other than to say it concerns a dinosaur that hatches when a meteorite impacts a rural area near ""Crater Lake."" The commotion requires an idiotic sheriff, several comic relief hillbillies, and a crack team of researchers from a university to attempt to deal with the creature, resulting, of course, in the typical ""we need to kill it"" versus the ""we need to save it for science"" arguments (one guess as to which side of that debate is proven correct).

This film has almost unbearable acting with a script to match, and features some of the cheesiest dialogue in movie history. I have seen many bad films, and this is definitely in the ""so bad it's a crime it wasn't done by MST3K"" category. The pretense, plot, and general fundamentals (watch for such Ed Wood classic techniques as ""day for night"" shooting, in which the temporal aspects of the movie become completely disjointed from reality) of the film match the ineptness of the actors, but perhaps lamest of all is the monster itself which is one of the worst and least terrifying creatures in the annals of horror cinema.

This film is also available in ""The Horrible Horrors Collection, Volume 2"" (from Rhino), a multi-DVD pack with seven other cheesy stinkers, most of which are actually even worse than ""The Crater Lake Monster"". (Hard to believe, but true.)

For fans of really terrible cinema, this one will be sure to elicit delighted groans.

277212,2,6300251748,"...goes against every natural law.""  Hmmm...that's exactly what I was thinking about this film as I watched it last night.  The front of this Rhino DVD release for The Crater Lake Monster (1977) lists Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens, and Tony Bill as the stars, but after watching the film last night, none of these three actors appear in this feature...a little research indicates they did appear together, in a film titled Las Vegas Lady (1975), which was also released to DVD by Rhino, so I suspect some sort of printing mix up (I kinda wish they had mixed up the films, as I feel Las Vegas Lady had to have been better than what I saw)...produced and directed by William R. Stromberg (gee his only film to date...big surprise), the film stars Richard Cardella (who also wrote this turkey), Glen Roberts (who looks quite a bit like George `Buck' Flowers), Mark Siegel (who would later discover his true calling behind the scenes, creating creatures for such films like Ghost Busters, Dune, and Poltergeist II), and Bob `Buster' Hyman (I'm speculating his nickname, given his last name).

As the story begins, a couple of paleontology students make a `startling' discovery in an abandoned mine of native drawings that, according to one of them, must be at least 1,000 years old (yeah, right...and I was looking for the `Fresh Paint' sign...seriously, the paint couldn't have been more than a day or two old).  The (ahem) ancient paintings suggests that dinosaurs and man may have co-existed at some point...but alas, this amazing discovery is soon overshadowed by the arrival of a flaming meteor from space, which lands in nearby Crater Lake, causing the mine to collapse...but all is not lost, as the heat from the meteor warms the water to the point where a dormant dinosaur egg hatches, releasing a prehistoric relic that grows into a very hungry creature, whose diet seems to include fish, cattle, and the local hick population.  After Sheriff Steve Hanson (Cardella) has a run in with the creature, the town seems split on what to do...there are those who feel the monster is bad for business and should be killed (the sheriff is inclined to agree after almost becoming `dino chow'...his words, not mine), but the scientific community (by scientific community I mean the two paleontology students and the local doctor, played by Bob `Buster' Hyman) believes a discovery of this magnitude needs to be captured and studied...I, myself, would probably opt for the former over the latter, especially since the creature's killed a number of people, including a senator who had gone fishin' (don't you think the disappearance of a senator would have sent a whole lot of federales into the area?  I suppose he probably wasn't that popular).  This all leads up to a rather unspectacular final confrontation between the creature and the townsfolk...will creature be victorious, turning the town into its' own, private larder?  Or will the sheriff have one hellava trophy to mount on his wall?  Will Arnie (Roberts) and Mitch (Siegel), owners of the boat rental/bait and tackle shop, ever commit and consummate their thinly veiled homoerotic relationship?  Most of these questions shall be answered...

I've seen a lot of creature features, some good, many mediocre, and some just downright bad.  The Crater Lake Monster falls to the left of just down right bad.  The main reason for this is the inclusion of some of the worst comedic elements committed to film I've ever seen.  In terms of on screen comedic duos, many would probably agree Abbott and Costello are among the tops, with Martin and Lewis following a close second.  The characters played by Roberts and Siegel were written apparently to try and emulate these pairings, but the key to success is having one character being the straight man, while the other the buffoon.  Two moronic buffoons do not a comedy duo make...the direction lacked, well, direction...the continuity was awful (the film was supposed to take place over a number of months, but there was no indication of this other than the characters telling us this), often we were supposed to believe it was night, but it was obvious this was not the case as the sun was still up (check out the scene where the magician, with one of the worst English accents I've ever heard, is out on a boat with his girlfriend, both commenting on how lovely the stars are despite that fact the sun is clearly visible), and seemingly meaningless plot points would appear out of nowhere...this is perfectly illustrated by the cut to scene featuring the guy in some city who robs a liquor store, killing the cashier and a customer, stealing only a bottle of booze (this scene was really a bummer, as it killed whatever humor the director cultivated to this point, and given my earlier comments, you'll know that wasn't much).  Much later on the character does re-appear and ends up getting devoured by the creature...as far as the creature...the stop motion stuff was pretty bad (the credits later reveal the work was done in `Fantamation', whatever that means...I've only seen that process here, so it must not have been that successful), but when compared to the prop work, it looks award winning.  The props of the creature's head were so bad they could only be shown either underwater or in a bunch of frantic, quick cut shots...it didn't matter much as the poorness came though regardless.  I will give the film credit for at least showing the creature more than I would have expected.  I can't tell you how many creature features I've seen where the creature rarely makes an appearance, and the audience is meant to piece it together on their own.

The full screen print here looks pretty good, and the audio ain't half bad.  Included is a 35 second trailer for the film.  The DVD case indicates a R rating, but it's really PG.

Yeah, the acting, dialogue, and logic of the characters are questionable throughout the movie, but I found it to be quite entertaining and fun. After all, it's a giant monster on the loose movie from that era. Anyhow, I thought the creature looked pretty good and animated well.",1524787200,,336,4.616666666666666

7807342,3,6300251748,"RELEASED IN 1977 and written & directed by William R. Stromberg, The Crater Lake Monster details events in the high country of central California after a meteor strikes the eponymous (fictitious) lake and incubates a prehistoric egg, which hatches a plesiosaur-like creature that terrorizes the locals.

Despite the title, the story does not take place in Crater Lake, Oregon, and the filmmakers don't hide this fact in light of (1.) the California plates of the vehicles and (2.) the lake is clearly snake-like in shape and not round like Crater Lake in Oregon. Speaking of the lake they used for establishing shots, its located roughly 425 miles southeast of Crater Lake in central California.

The movie is akin to modern Syfy flicks, but shot on a low-budget in the mid-70s. It lacks the production quality of 70s creature features like Jaws (1975) and Prophecy (1979), but isn't even up to the production level of TV flicks like Snowbeast (1977) and Kingdom of the Spiders (1977). The second-rate acting of the principles in particular distinguishes The Crater Lake Monster from these movies. But the Ray Harryhausen-like stop-motion effects are effective, although whenever the creature is shown emerging from the lake the contrast between the two (the monster and the lake) looks decidedly fake.

Kacey Cobb shines on the female front and looks great in tight jeans, but her role is too small. Theres some goofy slapstick provided by Arnie and Mitch, which is only a notch or so above the antics of Skipper and Gilligan. Other than that, the tone is serious and there are some highlights, like the excellent locations, the 70s atmosphere (styles/dcor/etc.) and the surprisingly moving close. I should add that I never perceived the plesiosaur as a particularly scary or formidable dinosaur, but this flick gave me a different perspective.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 25 minutes and was shot in Huntington Lake and Palomar Mountain, California. ADDITIONAL WRITER: Richard Cardella.

7807343,2,6300251748,"B-movie would be a generous descriptor. ""Crater Lake"" looked exactly like the lakes in Michigan, it felt like the name made us assume it was going to be true sci-fi material. However, the movie basically ended up being a few upper class people and two nitwits with a boat rental ""company"" being terrified by this monster. Boring plot, weirdly animated monster, and somewhat bad acting. Only nice part was the scenery! Gorgeous lake scenes!",1518393600,,439,4.945945945945946
7807344,3,6300251748,"I loved this movie. The actors were above par for this type of movie. The monster was more than believable at a distance, but the close ups weren't very good. Parts of the plot like the one with the robber were just filled and not developed. The relationship of the boat renters was well done, both hilarious and endearing. The scene of them at their cabin gives new meaning to the term fighting like cats and dogs. Watch the animals in the background, lol. Good movie.",1516752000,,469,4.465116279069767
7807345,1,6300251748,"A meteor crashes into a lake which causes a dinosaur egg to hatch and before you can say Lock Ness, the baby Dino is chowing down on the local townspeople in this low-budget b-movie.

This movie has almost everything that one wants from a dinosaur flick. Well except for a good storyline, believable characters, a credible or even passable dino, good special effects, and/or anything that'll keep you from falling asleep, but other than those things the movie is tops, What it does have is two knuckleheads that are painfully groan-inducingly unfunny, so there's that. Seriously though, don't waste your time.",1516233600,,609,5.02970297029703
7807346,2,6300251748,"This movie was so schlocky, I couldn't stop laughing at most of the inconsistencies going on. The first part of the movie, the dialogue was badly out of sync, worse than watching a foreign movie.  It wasn't really a bad movie, because it was entertaining. but when you have a woman sitting in a boat talking about how she's never seen so many stars before, when it's the middle of a bright and sunny day, I'm saying to myself ""Huh?"", all I could think of was that maybe the sun was affecting her brain, or something.  A little later, that same woman sees a monster and just stands there on the rocks screaming like a total idiot, instead of running. There were several other scenes where they were having trouble with trying to decide what time of day it was supposed to be, the sheriff often said it was getting dark and he had to do something, yet it always seemed that it never got dark there because they always ended up running around and it still was daylight. And no one  will ever convince me that the producers didn't just throw in that entire storyline about a store robbery at the last minute, none of the scenes looked like they fit in the movie at all.
I guess if you don't mind hokey movies, this one won't bother you then.",1514678400,,1237,4.346320346320346

7807348,4,6300251748,"THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER (1977) is about a meteor that lands in the titular lake. In no time, a gigantic creature exits the water, and goes on an eating spree, depleting the cow and hillbilly populations! Underwater close-ups of the monster reveal it's being a big rubber head in someone's swimming pool, but who cares? The stop-motion version of it is fairly well-realized. The monster is also a better actor than most of the humans in the film! Meanwhile, a side-story about a murdering robber unfolds, leading, not surprisingly, to the lake, and... CHOMP! Will Doc Calkins (Bob Hyman) and Sheriff Steve Hanson (Richard Cardella) be able to stop the beast, before it devours everyone in town? Stay tuned for the big, bloody finale!
