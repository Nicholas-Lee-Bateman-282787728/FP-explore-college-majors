8696919,3,B00S1VR6OS,"These are all terrific Cary Grant movies. However, I have serious issues with the film transfers on this 4-film collection. There is a notice on the bottom of the back of the box that states:  ""Exclusively licensed for distribution from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, Inc.""  Unfortunately, I can't imagine that Sony Pictures had anything to do with this collection other than letting Mill Creek Entertainment sell these films at a discount price.

As a result, the transfer quality of these films runs from poor (""The Amazing Adventure"") to good (""His Girl Friday"" and ""Once Upon a Time""). ""Penny Serenade"" is acceptable. That being said, here's what you get:

Disc 1 (Two films on one side of the disc.)

""The Amazing Adventure""  - black-and-white, running time: 61:51, release date: 1936, IMDB rating: 6.3

""His Girl Friday"" - black-and-white, running time: 91:25, release date: 1940, IMDB rating: 8.0 [ Note:  The American Film Institute ranked this film #19 on their list of 100 Funniest Movies of All Time.]

Disc 2  (Two films on one side of the disc.)

""Penny Serenade"" - black-and-white, running time: 117:17, release date: 1941, IMDB rating: 7.1

""Once Upon a Time"" - black-and-white, running time: 88:25, release date: 1944, IMDB rating: 6.1

There are two films each on two one-sided DVDs. Each disc is housed on a separate spindle, on on the iside front of the case and the other on the inside back of the case. There are no extras of any kind. No trailers. No close captioning. No foreign languages.

Again, these are all terrific films. Whether or not you find this collection a bargain will depend on how high you set your standards for picture quality.",1451692800,4,1671,4.900355871886121

8696921,5,B00S1VR6OS,Love all of Cary Grant movies.  The quality of the movies were very good.,1436140800,,73,4.214285714285714
8696922,5,B00S1VR6OS,"First of all I would get this just for Once Upon a Time, since that is OOP and the quality is quite good. His Girl Friday quality is pretty good and the other two are watchable but not the best. By the way, you can get Penny Serenade from Olive Films and that's a better quality disk. There isn't any bonus features or subtitles and English is the only audio. Overall, I would recommend this.",1426723200,6,392,4.24
