8482642,4,B005PS4ZHQ,"I had been hearing about Asta Nielsen for many years and finally caught up with her.  The only thing that mystifies me is that she is often described as androgynous.  Maybe that came later, but in these early films she has a powerful womanly sexual appeal.  In the pre-WWI era, European movies were way ahead of ours in depicting relations between mature men and women.  Alas, that war nearly destroyed most Continental film industries, and it took them quite a while to catch up with us.  Gotta see more Asta Nielsen!",1353110400,4,518,4.648351648351649
