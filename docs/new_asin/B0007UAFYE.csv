8051805,4,B0007UAFYE,"A television film from two major talents: directed by John Schlesinger, written by Alan Bennett. Very dry wit joins with a rueful sadness in the 1 hour based on truth drama of English traitor in exile Guy Burgess (the wonderful Alan Bates) striking up a brief friendship with actress Coral Browne (playing herself) when he goes to see a cultural exchange production of Hamlet, in 1958, wanders backstage, and throws up in her dressing room sink.  Full of trenchant observations on both Soviet and British life,, what it means to miss ones homeland,  Though a few comic moments when Browne speaks with two dolts at the British Embassy are a bit overstated, this is full of beautifully observed moments, if not quite ascending all the way to greatness (that said, given that it won every major UK award, another look may be in order).",1451952000,,832,4.770833333333333
8051806,5,B0007UAFYE,"I was fascinated by the Cold War espianage spies, especially as portrayed by John LaCarre.  This video is about a true-life traitor who was recruited at Cambridge University in England and worked successfully for the Russians for years. When his activities were exposed, he fled to Moscow. Alan Bates is wonderful as Guy Burgess and Cybil Browne as herself.  It is a bitter-sweet story but you can't let yourself feel sorry for this man.  The shot of him walking over a bridge in Moscow with ""He is an Englishman"" playing in the background is magnificent.  I watch this every once in a while.",1311465600,6,592,4.718446601941747
8051807,5,B0007UAFYE,"I saw this on PBS television years  ago and absolutely loved it.  Could never find  VHS tape of it, and now that I no longer own a VCR, here it is!!  If you have a VCR buy it.  It is so well acted, directed, and totally absorbing.  WHERE'S THE DVD????  WELL, FOLKS NOW IT'S HERE.  You can get it as part of a compendium of Allan Bennett, the author, at the BBC. You get this DVD and everything else he did which was stupendous...but you have to get it from AmazonUK, and TAKE NOTE, THE FORMAT IS IN REGION 2.  SO YOU WOULD NEED AN ALL REGION DVD PLAYER TO WATCH IT.  IT'S WORTH IT.  THE PRICE IS MUCH LESS THAN THE PRICE OF THIS VHS AND WELL WORTH IT.  HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. THE TITLE IS ""ALLAN BENNETT AT THE BBC"".

...and oh, yes, the English is undrstandable!!  It isn't nowadays on PBS.",1258588800,7,796,4.117647058823529
