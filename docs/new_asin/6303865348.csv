724119,5,6303865348,"It seems unbelievable that the so-called ""Greatest love story of the century"" has not gotten more attention by filmmakers.  Masterpiece Theatre's ""Edward and Mrs. Simpson was good, but very wooden. The Woman He Loved starring Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour, brings the famous story to life.
The Prince of Wales meets an American divorcee, Wallis Simpson.  Simpson is currently married but once she meets the famous playboy, all bets are off.
The TV movie does a good job of showing how Wallis and the future King of England fell in love without being too heavy-handed. The only complaint I have is that the movie ended far too soon; I would have like a little more in-depth look at the principals.  After all, how often does a man give up the thrown to marry his true love?",1008806400,12,775,4.6838235294117645

After becoming king  Edward the VIiI  abdicates the throne in order to marry  Wallis.  This is a more sympathetic look at the scandoulous romance,1427068800,,295,5.148936170212766

724275,3,6303865348,"In a world where recent movies and television are marred and destroyed by verbal filth, disgusting inappropriate sex, nasty and evil characters, hideous violence, trite and mindless plots and scripts, it is a joy and a pleasure to acquire a film like The Woman He Loved.  Worthwhile drama, wonderful actors, excellent directing, good script, lush backgrounds, topical historical story.  Well done and we'll worth watching.

It is tragic that Entertainment creators have given themselves permission since the early nineties to create utter trash and to insult the population with images and words worthy of the gutter.  It would be lovely to see this trend reversed.  I NEVER WATCH ANY NETWORK, CABLE , PREMIUM CABLE, NEW MOVIE RELEASES ETC.  Only LINCOLN AND SECRETARIAT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTABLE ENTERTAINMENT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.  AND WHO PRODUCED THEM?  DISNEY?  WHAT A SURPRISE!!!!!  I have enjoyed this RANT enormously.  Please pass it on to Industry Profssionals and ask them to brng back the good old days on fun, decent, enjoyable MEDIA!!!!  I have a vast collect.ion of BBC/PBS Dramas.  Please make more like them.

724277,3,6303865348,"Okay....but,  Jane Seymour's old age make-up was awful! I thought Anthony Andrews' acting was terrible, but then maybe the DW really spoke like that.  Who knows?  'Edward and Mrs. Simpson' was much better.  However, I found Jane's American Southern accent perfectly acceptable & Ms. D's delightful.  I'm from the South & some of the Southern accents I hear in movies are really funny although I have to admit the British can usually pull one off better than a Yankee American, but when I visited New York, some firemen at a certain station thought my accent was funny & everybody in Texas ate barbeque.",1405641600,2,602,4.805825242718447

724279,5,6303865348,"I came across this almost by accident,and can say that this is one of the nicest movies i've seen for years. It deals with Edward and Wallis Simpson,later the Duke and Duchess of Windsor,and his abdication in 1936,with great taste,gentleness,and slightly old fashioned sensitivity. It shows the enormous pressures and sheer impossibility of the situation in which they found themselves,its utterly believable,and its the perfect counterpoint to the way the lovers were depicted in the recent marvellous movie,""The Kings Speech""
Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour are truly magnificent in the leading roles,and this is not to be missed!",1397865600,15,633,5.469387755102041

I also have the other series. It is said that the duchess never knew about these series nor books.

flowers, monogrammed sheets, chef, servants  no more in her home. How sad. I always think it is the ""Duke""

Unmute--started up again.  Very annoying.  At times it is so loud that the dialogue is overwhelmed.  A movie for one time viewing only.",1386547200,2,449,4.469135802469136

724357,5,6303865348,"Like everyone else, I have tried, in vain, for years to buy this DVD.  Was thrilled to see last week that it was available, at last.  Now if I can just get my hands on the Faye Dunaway version.

Jane Seymour was a splendid Wallis. Don't you know the real Wallis wished she looked as pretty? The first time I recall anyone adding the famous mole to Mrs. Simpson's chin.  Anthony Andrews did resemble the Prince, but in real life his hair was blond, not brown as in the film. I hope the Duke of Windsor wasn't as sullen and depressed as portrayed.  It was a heavy film from beginning to end.  There was no lightheartedness at all.  Surely there must have been moments during that time when there was much laughter. We don't see it in this version.

The entire 100 minutes is beautifully photographed with what appears to be the actual buildings. Mr. Al Fayed must have given them permission to film inside her Paris home as every scene filmed there looks like the real deal.

This movie is, after all, over 25 years old. It holds up very well. A great deal is left out.  If you want to watch the very best adaptation of their love story you will have to rent/buy Edward & Mrs. Simpson with Cynthia Harris playing the Duchess. She is, to my mind, the one actress who got Wallis down pat. There is a bit of the devil in Mrs. Simpson the way Ms. Harris plays her.  Ms. Seymour is too sweet in the role. I still watch Edward & Mrs. Simpson once or twice a year.  But it was a mini-series filmed during the time when the Duchess was still alive.

While I won't be alive to learn the answer to this question, I do wonder if their lives will be of any interest 50 years from now.  Do the British youth of today even know who they were?  They're talking about Princess Diana and her tragic life on the throne.  For me, for always, I will always want to read every new book that comes out about Wallis and her David.  Their 'crowd' are no longer here.  One wishes one of their closest friends had written the truth before they died.  For obvious reasons, they couldn't.  The British aren't like us.  They have principles when it comes to opening up their personal lives for all to see.  When in doubt, don't.

At the beginning of the film you see an aged woman who has just lost her soul mate.  It begins in Paris at their home on the day he dies.  It ends with her at his funeral in London. There was nothing uplifting about this story.  Yet, it is certainly worth watching to see the beautiful scenery and archive footage of royal life. I am really happy they have re-released this film.  I have wanted to see it for many, many years.  It was worth the wait.",1384560000,5,2649,4.265060240963855
724358,5,6303865348,Have always loved the story behind the Windsor family and the Kings and Queens of England.  The acting was supberb and it is a love story to be told for our children.,1382832000,8,166,4.1875
724359,5,6303865348,"I very much enjoyed watching this movie...several times actually. It's beautifully portrayed by a cast of seasoned actors.
I finally have a better idea why a King  would give up everything for love. The costumes and sets are perfect for the glamorous time when stunning jewelry glittered even in the daytime. I
enjoyed it immensely.",1380931200,11,332,5.036363636363636
724433,5,6303865348,"A romantic picture of the happenings leading up to Edward's resignation and subsequent marriage to Wallace Simpson, done in flashbacks from his funeral.

724440,5,6303865348,"I've been waiting for this movie to be released on DVD Region 1 forever!!!  I knew it had been released in Austrlia so I figured it was just a matter of time before it would finally make it to the US market.  Now I won't have to bring my ancient VHS tape of it to be transferred!!!  In my opinion, this version is perhaps the best rendering of the Wallis Simpson and Edward VIII love story.  Jane Seymour, as usual, is spot on with her Baltimore-American accent and Anthony Andrews perfectly captures the cadence of Edward VIII's speech.  His expressions and nuances showed that he truly studied the role.  There is also a nice cameo performance by the wonderful Olivia DeHavilland who portrays Mrs. Simpson's aunt.  This DVD is a must for any Anglophile or student of British royal history!!",1365206400,35,792,4.614285714285714
724441,5,6303865348,What a lovely video with Jane Seymour giving her usual wonderful performance!  This story of two people in love and the sacrifice the King made for love is very moving and well done.,1364428800,,182,4.515151515151516
724442,4,6303865348,"After having seen ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"", the 1982 version with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews also in the title roles, I was more than ready to watch this movie!  They did so well the last time that I was curious to see how they would reteam in this historical love story.  Have no doubts about watching this video, both of them rose to the challenge admirably.
In other versions of this story the two main characters seem so one-sided and wooden.  Historically speaking Mrs. Simpson is cast as the adventuress, a twice divorced woman determined to become Queen of England by capturing the heart of King Edward VIII.  Jane Seymour went beyond the historical stick figure to show us a complex woman who struggled with her own emotions.  Did she love the man or the monarch?  Did she realize just what she was letting herself in for when she dared to fall in love with Edward VIII?  Would she really have given him up to keep him from abdicating the throne?  Jane Seymour's chemistry with Anthony Andrews leads the audience to believe that the love between Wallis and Edward was genuine and they were two people caught in an difficult situation.  As the grieving Duchess of Windsor Jane Seymour allows us to see just how alone Wallis felt after the Duke's death.  My only complaint is that I wish this film version had shown a little more of their life together.
Anthony Andrews also did a superb job breathing life into the character of Edward VIII.  While other actors might have given the audience the cardboard royal performance he allowed us to see a monarch caught between his private feelings and his public duties.  A man who would not take the coronation oath ""with a lie on his lips"", or allow Mrs. Simpson to simply withdraw without following her.  And later on, as HRH The Duke of Windsor, he insisted on his wife being addressed with the same royal title and deference that he was entitled to receive.  While other versions of this story might suggest that Edward VIII was an undedicated and weak man, Mr. Andrews gives this monarch a backbone.  He followed his own code of honor and stood up to Mr. Baldwin, the royal family, and the government.  Anthony Andrews turns in a sympathetic and realistic performance as Edward VIII and this film is a story not to be missed!",1012608000,30,2285,4.632754342431761
