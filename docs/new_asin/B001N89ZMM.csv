3712080,3,B001N89ZMM,"I love her ""Squeeze"" workout but this is mainly lunges that are entirely too repetitive.  It also seems to require a great deal of coordination and space.  I like a challenge but this just doesn't seem doable.  If you like her ""Squeeze"" video and are just looking for variety; do Lotte Berke or Tracy Anderson.  I recommend skipping this one.",1236211200,5,342,4.65
3712081,2,B001N89ZMM,"I'll start off by saying I have both the original Squeeze and and Squeeze Stronger and use both regularly. This DVD just didn't work enough of my problem areas (butt, hips, and inner thighs). It was heavy on quad work-lots of reverse lunges which lasted for almost half the workout. My quads tend to build up easily so I really didn't care for this. Also, this is an exercise I can get from just about any workout for the lower body. The exercises that utilize the chair for balance just felt awkward. It felt like they were barre exercises trying to be reworked using a chair and it just wasn't working for me.",1233705600,25,611,4.415929203539823
3712082,5,B001N89ZMM,"This 30 minute workout gets right to the heart or in this case, glutes of the matter.  It includes back lunges with many repetitions (whew!! it really gets your cardio pumping)and a series of side and back repetition kicks while standing with a chair for support.  Believe me when I say as an intermediate level workout person, you will feel muscles in your legs and butt you never knew you had or thought you used when you worked out.
It is very similar to the kind of toning and strength training exercises professional dancers use.

The only negative thing I have to say about it is that it does not have a warm up and you should do that before you begin.

All in all, it is challenging, fast (30 mins) and effective but it may discourage a beginner or someone who has not worked out in a while, so just do fewer reps and grow stronger)  Hey, even at intermediate level, I still couldn't hold my left leg up for the last ten reps, so with consistency and more practice, I look forward to improving my muscles and getting stonger because that's what its all about.

I know I will be feeling this workout tomorrow but in a good way!",1233532800,10,1133,4.345971563981043
8323319,2,B001N89ZMM,"I really loved Squeeze&Squeeze Stronger and thought I would enjoy this as well but was very disappointed. If you already own Tracy's other workouts,this DVD is pointless. There are really no new excercises on here and her other dvd's give you the option to do lower body only,so this DVD is really unnecessary-I sold mine",1428710400,2,321,4.8545454545454545
8323320,3,B001N89ZMM,"This video is NOT for beginners! I couldn't get through even the first part. Not that that makes it a bad video, just a bad choice for me right now. But it is something to strive for!",1410220800,,183,3.972972972972973
8323321,5,B001N89ZMM,"I like Tracy a lot and her approach to exercise. This is one of the hardest lower body workouts I have ever done, and I have done many different kinds. This is a short no nonsense sequence. It starts out with classic barre sequence and then goes into step-backs, where the torture starts. I am sure that they are very efffective but it is so hard to  survive the whole series. Shaking, burning, feeling numb... All kinds of muscle related pain is what you will experience. Then comes another barre section, which is also extreme. My legs literally collapsed. So if you think you are advanced and looking for a well-cued challange with a real instructor working in a cozy ambiance, there you go, you will not regret ordering.",1394841600,3,724,4.612403100775194
8323322,4,B001N89ZMM,"I really like this DVD.  Just wish it were longer.  Feel like my legs are just getting warmed up and it ends, but what she does is really good.  I usually do this 30 minute DVD then follow with her Squeeze DVD.  If you consistently do this workout, you will notice a difference in your strength and muscle tone of your legs and butt.",1368144000,,333,4.15625
8323323,5,B001N89ZMM,This is a great DVD.  It really makes your body change if you use it 3 or 4 times per week.,1337040000,,91,3.3333333333333335
8323324,3,B001N89ZMM,"I love Squeeze and Squeeze Stronger and recommend them emphatically, but found this workout odd. It is extremely heavy on hip flexor stress and quad work and has very little benefit (in my opinion) for the base of the glutes or hamstrings. Instead it focuses on the outside hip in targeted exercises, which is fine to do, but unnecessary since there are several minutes of standing leg work (standing on one leg, to be specific). I'm a barre teacher and would never teach a class like this. Might work for some, however, and I really do enjoy Tracy Effinger. She's got a great screen presence and seems really genuine--warm, challenging, and encouraging at the same time.",1330473600,,671,4.793103448275862
8323325,4,B001N89ZMM,"This is a great workout for targeting the lower body.  It seems slow paced but the movements are controlled and deliberate.  I definitely can tell that I have worked the parts that I am targeting.  Workouts that require a lot of bouncing or floor exercises with a mat tend to hurt my neck.  I am able to complete this session without straining my neck.  I also like that I will be able to increase the difficulty level by adding ankle weights over time.  The only thing that I do not like is the irritating music.  It seems ""screechy"" to me.  The instructions are easy to follow. Now that I know the workout, I turn off the sound and listen to music that is more motivating to me.",1296864000,,680,4.299212598425197
8323326,5,B001N89ZMM,"I almost didn't purchase this DVD due to what seemed like lukewarm reviews but then saw a video clip on totalfitnessdvds and really liked what I saw.  I'm glad I finally purchased the DVD.

All exercises are done standing. These are the segments on the DVD (total time 29:21):
o Dead Lifts (Warmup) (48 seconds)
o Slow Scoop Plies (2:23)
o Tip Toe Lunges (3:30, includes standing thigh stretches):  This is a barre version of lunges and, for me, focuses much more on the quadriceps than regular lunges do.  I like that she included these as it isn't included on many of the barre DVDs I have.
o Step Backs (reverse lunges) (6:58): 3 rounds of 20 per leg.  She adds dumbbells for the second and third rounds.  For the third round she adds an optional front knee raise.
o Around the World (15:03):  This is the longest segment and works the thighs from every angle, as well as working the supporting leg.  There are four sets. She completes all four sets on one side before moving to the second side. Set 1 works the quadriceps and psoas with front leg raises and leg extensions. Set 2 works the side of your thighs and gluteus medius using side leg raise variations, leg circles, and diagonal raises to the side/back.  Set 3 starts similar to set 2 with side leg raises.  Set 4 works the hamstrings and glutes with a variety of bent leg raises to the back with hips square.  She wraps up the set with a figure-4 standing stretch before moving to the second side, and repeating the figure-4 stretch.

I thought this provided a very good, balanced lower body workout.  I like that it includes the more traditional, non-barre reverse lunges (step backs) as I think they are so effective for keeping legs toned (and also good for my knees).  Barre workouts usually focus more on quadriceps and for me lunges tend to hit me much more in my hamstrings making for a nicely balanced workout. The lunges take up about  of the entire workout.

I actually would have liked for the plie section to be longer, so will probably repeat it at the end of the workout in the future. The Around the World section was challenging, in particular in the first round as I can't lift my leg that high either. Gives me something to work up to.

I loved Tracy's Squeeze Stronger already and see myself using this DVD a lot.",1296172800,5,2296,4.480769230769231
8323327,5,B001N89ZMM,"I purchased all 3 of the squeeze DVD's at the same time and first did the original workout.  Wow, I must say I was impressed.  I consider myself to be at an intermediate-advanced level and I was sore the next day.
Tracy works the muscles in a different, and I think more challenging way than my other DVD's.

After using the first Squeeze for a couple weeks I put this into my player.  I was hopeful, but wasn't quite sure if I would be challenged after reading some of these not so great reviews.

Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  Last year I got hooked on Cathe Friedrich, but wish her really effective workout's, were shorter.  Cathe is awesome, but sometimes I just don't feel, or want to spend an hour just working my lower body.  This workout was short (30 min.), concise, and hopefully effective.

I have used it twice this week and have been hurting ever since.  Now I haven't challenged my lower body in a while as I kind of quit working out due to life getting in the way, but I still consider myself in pretty good shape.  I was surprised it hurt to walk the next day.  This is a good thing!

This is great.  I will continue using this DVD in rotation with her other two.  If I keep eating right and working out with these consistently I know I will see the results I desire in a matter of time.",1245369600,5,1308,4.260162601626016
8323328,5,B001N89ZMM,"I wanted to add a positive review for this dvd because I almost didn't buy it because of some of the reviews. I think all the squeeze workouts are some of the most effective and enjoyable out there and this lower body is just as good. It's 30 minutes of concentrated movements that can only Work to reshape your lower body. Some of the moves are really challenging but I like that about working out with her, if you have worked out with Tracy before then you know what I'm talking about. All her dvd's are a little different and that's what makes them so special.",1238716800,7,563,4.320754716981132
