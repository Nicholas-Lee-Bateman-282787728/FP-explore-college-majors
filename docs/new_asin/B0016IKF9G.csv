Jess just got freaking weird as he got older & convinced others to take that acid trip with him. You have to give props to Lina. No matter where Jess goes, she's right there gyrating her 60 yr old nude body to whatever soundtrack is floating thru the ethereal cavity that holds his brain.
There is a synopsis of both movies on this page but I don't honestly remember there being a story for the first one. Second has more of a story line. Bunch of naked chicks maybe having sex with a naked Lina before a man shows up & kinda does too. Kinda & Maybe are used because they appear at various times but I wasn't really sure she was awake in any of them.
Who know? Maybe I just really liked his stuff from the '60's-'70's & never understood where he was coming from in his latter years. Maybe he always saw the world this way but couldn't express it until the technology came along to do it justice in his mind. Maybe he was just taking a bad trip & recorded it. I say skip it unless you've got an OCD collectors syndrome.",1359504000,4,1196,4.093617021276596
