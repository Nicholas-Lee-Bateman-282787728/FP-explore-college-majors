8654718,5,B00JZWV3YG,"Fat Burning Cardio - I purchased the set of 3 DVD of this ""You Can Do It"" set and am very happy with them.  You can see a trailer on Denise's website.  The location is a contemporary building interior (mainly white) and Denise and two other ladies are wearing bright and happy colours.  One lady is a modifier for low impact. Music is acceptable - typical canned music. There are two 30 minutes aerobic workouts, with easy and varied choreography.  Some segments are more athletic and some a bit more dancy.  Good variety and keeps me interested.  You can do both back-to-back with one warm up and one cool down for a 50 min total workout.",1403654400,,639,4.4655172413793105
