8342439,5,B001TWQF02,"The DVD begins with an interview in which Ron shares some ideas about getting the best tone from the banjo. Interesting, but not earth-shattering. Then the DVD goes into depth in nine different songs. For each song, there is a brief interview with Ron about the song and why he plays it as he does. Then he plays it at full speed with the band (guitar and bass). Then back to interview format in which Ron breaks down the song segment-by-segment, telling a little about special licks and runs. Then Ron plays the song solo at speed and again at a slower tempo. While he plays, there is a split screen showing both the left and the fight hand movements. This is really helpful. The booklet contains full tab for each of the nine songs. I'll spend many hours with this DVD and booklet.

One other thing... In the middle of the DVD, Ron spends some time using and discussing Scruggs tuners. I don't use such tuners, but the song and tab are still very useful.

After listening to this DVD, I plan to buy his CD, TIME STANDS STILL, just for listening pleasure. He is a tremendous banjo player.",1360281600,2,1089,4.44
8342440,5,B001TWQF02,Ron Stewart is a phenomenal banjo player. This video is both entertaining and educational. If you're a novice or a pro you'll benefit from Ron's explanation of how he keeps a strong sense of melody while incorporating the 3 finger roll. I'm never disappointed with AcuTab instructional videos.,1345680000,,293,5.125
