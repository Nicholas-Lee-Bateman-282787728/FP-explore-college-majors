8240421,5,B00114UUO0,The second disk in the series is just as action packed and interesting as the first disk.  I highly recommend this disk to anyone who likes animation and a good story.,1209772800,,167,4.387096774193548
8240422,4,B00114UUO0,"I liked this volume a lot. Was it as better than the first? Yes and no. Yes because I liked the new characters like Billy's dad, and the existing characters like Penny and James grew as the story took a darker turn. Dr. Brest's right hand guys Dr. Lee and the woman scientist (her name escapes me) get a lot more screen time and are more intrical. The writing escalated past my expectation not just in the character development but in overall scope. The introduction of the battleship Invincible and its key to the earths survival coupled with the Sky Knight added to the evolution of weapons leading us into the final battle. The lack of the Sky Knight in this volume would be the only reason this volume wasn't better than the first. Yes there was some action with the military fighting the alien ships and the return of the Invincible near the end was very impressive but I felt the lack of dogfights and evasive combat only the Sky Knight could offer was severely missed. All that being said I anxiously await the final volume and pray it ends well. It looks to be so, with the Sky Knight rushing off to battle along side the Invincible and the yet to be seen Mole machine. What part does the ""dead scientist"" and his grand daughter play, and what is James?  I have my theories and if I'm wrong I won't care as long as it all makes sense. Like a great middle film in a trilogy the end of volume 2 has me ready to put in volume 3 right after its over.",1207958400,,1454,4.287272727272727
