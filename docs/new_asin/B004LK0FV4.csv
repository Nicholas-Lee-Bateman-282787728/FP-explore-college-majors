A malevolent spirit seeking revenge, numerous murders, an exorcist, all of which we have seen umpteen times in the past. However, the technicalities and execution of Wilson is novel. Right from the word go, his intentions are clear- 'I want to scare people'. Perhaps, he could have spent some time in establishing the characters and created a buildup in the initial portions. He doesn't allow you to get out of the fear mode right through, barring a few (forced) songs and comic scenes. He's so much into trying to frighten that plot doesn't seem to appear.

Wilson tries to induce fear by creepy camera angles and background score, creating the feeling that something eerie is in store. He scores in constructing the anticipation of fear rather than scaring, as what ensues isn't spooky.

The film has some amazingly shot scenes and an effective but loud background score. The technicalities don't account for an honorable horrifying feel, as the result is merely a natural reflex action to stimulus rather than fanatical fear. Also, there could have been some silent moments rather than being loud through out, for a better impact.",1300579200,,1202,5.005
