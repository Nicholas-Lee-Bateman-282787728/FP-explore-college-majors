8406835,4,B003VHUHJI,"One thing that another reviewer must not have understood is the fact that the animation style in this feature is based on the story and recognized style of the beloved author/illustrator of the original Rejsen til Saturn, Claus Deleuran. I am so glad that the animators did not try to change that! I love Claus Deleuran's illustrations and wish he had continued living and making books beyond the years that he did. The quality of the computer graphics may not be on par with Pixar, or whatever, but thankfully not everything in Denmark is made to please the American tastes.",1505692800,,575,4.76
8406836,1,B003VHUHJI,"Where to begin?  First off, the animations and drawing style are horrible.  The cover would lead you to believe this is a CGI-style movie.  In actuality it has lazily drawn 2D backdrops, with 3D sprites.  I know what your thinking, ""I like that!  It's like Roger Rabbit or any other realistic movie with cartoon characters!""  No-no-no.  Those were movies with realistic (or 3D) backgrounds with 2D sprites.  This is the reverse.  It might not sound bad, it even initially sounded good to me.  However, it's not.  At ALL.  It is downright off-putting when thrown into an entire 90-minute movie.

On to the writing.  It looks to have been done by a group of 8-year-old boys.  It's not funny at all.  99% of the humor is devoted to either body-shaming, animal abuse, or for the most part: anti-gay propaganda.  Yet done by people who obviously don't understand any of it, or how well it comes through.  Like a kid who needs taught a lesson or an elderly person who doesn't understand why they're being avoided.

Eventually, they DO get to Saturn, in like 23 days (although, to the writers' credit, the absurdity of taking like 14 days to get to the moon and less than double that for Saturn is briefly eluded to).  Saturn is what you'd guess a few 8-year-old boys with no astrological training who know they're being judged would make it: a hot beach party populated solely by hot women who are only attracted to the geeky guy.",1502409600,,1424,4.62
