8153813,5,B000K14L7M,"Naguib Rihani was a first class Egyptian actor in the golden days of ""Hollywood on the Nile"". The story takes place in charming Cairo in the 1940's. The film is in Arabic, with English subtitles. Unfortunately, the subtitles don't do the movie any good, as much of the wit and humor is lost in translation. Nevertheless, it still provides an excellent overview of life in Cairo during WWII, and of the talent of some of Egypt's finest actors during the 1940s and 1950s.",1214956800,9,469,4.662650602409639
