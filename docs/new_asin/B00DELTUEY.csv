It's good...",1389571200,2,250,4.319148936170213
5794882,4,B00DELTUEY,"Don't let the title of this movie fool you; it's not just a peace-preaching hippie flick.  It's actually much more than what you would probably give it credit for at first glance.  In fact, the last thirty minutes turn the film into a decent sort of horror flick (I use `horror' loosely in this context).  Although it is certainly dated, AN AMERICAN HIPPIE IN ISRAEL is entertaining `throwback' fun.

Let me preface this review by stating up front that this film will not be for everyone.  It's a low budget feature for sure, and the proof is onscreen.  But if you take the film for what it is, you'll enjoy it.

AN AMERICAN HIPPIE IN ISRAEL is not shot well and the acting is atrocious...but both of those aspects are part of the fun.  The title itself tells you not to go into this film expecting great things and, well, you shouldn't.  But there's something about this 40-year old grindhouse legend that draws the viewer in.  I couldn't stop watching it, and that should tell you something.

The obvious anti-war messages are there in both subtle and blatant form.  At one point, Mike (the main character) turns towards the camera and proceeds to call everyone offscreen `Fools' for pushing their buttons and starting wars.  I chuckled at this, not for the message, but for how it is conveyed; it's just hard for anyone from my generation to take a guy like this seriously.

But when things start going downhill on the island, that's when I got really interested.  I have to admit that the sharks looked horribly fake, but I can overlook that.  I also don't think that people would regress back to their animalistic sides after a single day of no food or water, but I might be wrong.  Still, these aspects only drew me into the film even more so.

AN AMERICAN HIPPIE IN ISRAEL won't be for everyone, but I liked it.  It's a classic throwback film that reminds us of how social and political statements used to be made.  And it's simply fun.  If you give this one a look, be sure to snag the 3-Disc Special Edition.  In addition to superior picture quality and sound, you'll get a limited edition DVD copy of director Amos Sefer's film THE HITCHHIKER; this DVD is not available anywhere else, so don't miss your chance to snatch this one up.",1383868800,5,2243,4.541147132169576
5794883,5,B00DELTUEY,"Okay...
With this one I really just want to say two things;

1. Watch the trailer on You Tube or Grindhouse Releasing's website

2. Buy the damn film while you can. There are only 2000 of these bad boys.

That should conclude my review but it won't. Because that would be getting off the hook too easy.

An American Hippie in Israel is a long lost film from an age of cinema long forgotten. An age where anyone with passion and a few bucks could make something out of nothing. While it may, at first, seem like a stretch to compare An American Hippie in Israel to the likes of THX 1138, American Graffiti, Schlock, A Kentucky Fried Movie and Dementia 13These films were all made by a pool of auteurs who all had a passion to create something different, with limited resources. I know I am comparing Amos Sefer, who really only made this one film, to George Lucas, John Landis and Francis Ford Copolla, who have had thriving careers. Amos Sefer had the misfortune of making an Israeli movie in a time when it wasn't marketable in any country. Had this not been the case I wonder just how many more memorable films this guy could've made. The fact that Mr. Sefer never got to see just what a phenomenon his film turned out to be -The Rocky Horror-like screenings and such, is saddening to say the least.

But on the positive he left us with an inspiring 'Hebrew Road Pic' to watch, over and over now thanks largely to Grindhouse Releasing.

At it's core this film is about the exploits of an American Vietnam Vet as he pursues a life of true freedom. Having been disillusioned by war he travels to Israel, another country not a stranger to conflict, to find all the freedom, weed and free love he can handle. Along the way he picks up like-minded folks, some of which do not even speak english and he doesn't speak Hebrew, but that doesn't stop him from being a, sort ofHippie leader. But exactly what does he lead his small band of deodorant fearing buddies to? That I won't spoil. Watch it for yourself.

At 93 minutes the film is very easy to watch. Quite engaging are the many anti war monologues, rampant nudity, drug induced delirium and so forth. The acting is better than one would expect from a director's first outing. Filled with memorable lines, crazy imagery and scenic locales. There were a lot of films made in the late 60's-early 70's that one can draw parallels to but none of them as grossly engaging as An American Hippie in Israel is. Grindhouse Releasing has done a commendable job in cleaning up the transfer in both the audio and visual departments. This is quite evident when watching the un mastered raw cut of the film on the bonus disc.

This release is chalk full of extra goodiesAll of them worth repeated viewings.

Long story shortAn American Hippie in Israel is FAR OUT COOL! If you love retro cinema or any cinema that breathes new life out from a creators lungs of passion (Seriously you will see what I mean when in my earlier comparisons once you watch), you owe it to yourself to own this important film.

La heim brothers and sisters! La heim!!!!

8592579,4,B00DELTUEY,"No matter how far he ran, his demons were never far behind.  A bizarre look at a post Viet Nam veteran trying to find freedom in Israel.  Not much is like the Israel I know.  The main character and his friends eventually made friends with a lamb and tried to live in harmony on a barren island.  Not such a good idea.",1461369600,,317,4.064516129032258

8592582,3,B00DELTUEY,Another movie I thought would be better than it was. The problem here was it that it just doesn't make enough of itself. The reason they found the print in such good condition is that nobody wanted to watch it. Maybe would be better to watch with a group as part of a late night screening.,1428192000,,289,4.178571428571429

8592586,5,B00DELTUEY,"I watched it.  There were people doing things.  I laughed a few times.  Not sure if I was laughing at or with the movie, but I did laugh.  I didn't think I liked it, but it won't leave my brain.  I have to watch it again.  I have a feeling I'll feel the same way upon viewing it a second time.  Maybe I'll watch it a dozen more times.  I have never seen anything like it, and I have seen (ish) that will turn you white!  The fact that this movie exists gives me a little bit more faith in humanity, but I have no clue why.  I think the movie's message was actually to lose all faith in humanity, but the fact that these people got this movie made and people other than themselves have seen it makes me feel safer walking the streets alone at night.  I also think the message may have been that the joke's on me.  Grindhouse did an amazing job on this insane plastic thing that I can't imagine life without.  This thing's got my mind all messed up.  I'm flooby.
Review edited on July 21st: Went from three stars to five stars.  The flick's got a huge pair of gagoozies, and I gotta show it some respect.  If The Mothers Of Invention's We're Only In It For The Money was done as a film instead of an album I believe it would look very much like this.",1409011200,7,1248,4.05327868852459

The plot and dialogue are absolutely crazy, and the acting is over the top (and mostly bad), yet the movie takes itself so seriously that the juxtaposition becomes highly amusing.",1392768000,,246,4.613636363636363
