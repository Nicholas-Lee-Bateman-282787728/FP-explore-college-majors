2878415,4,B000S0SYIM,"My 15 year old has been wanting to see ""How To Deal"" as she is a fan of Sarah Dessen books.  Couldn't find the movie anywhere but at Amazon (to the rescue). She liked this movie.  I enjoyed it as well.  Mandy Moore does a great portrayal of her character.  The movie covers every emotion there is in its storyline.  Its a combination of two Sarah Dessen books.

Raise Your Voice is also another favorite of my daughters.  I don't find Hillary Duff to be as good an actress as Mandy Moore, but it is a sweet movie as well.

For the price, you can't go wrong getting two good movies.",1238198400,3,581,4.171171171171171

2878417,4,B000S0SYIM,"How to Deal is good... a bit slow, but good.
Raise Your Voice is one of my favorites.
Both films are good for young girls as well as adults who enjoy a good teen-film watching every now and again.",1228003200,3,196,4.051282051282051

2878422,5,B000S0SYIM,These movies are really great to watch but what makes them even better is such a good price for two on one dvd!  No one can beat Amazon's prices especially with the free S & H for orders more than $25.  I love it!,1366675200,,213,3.8181818181818183

2878426,5,B000S0SYIM,"Does anyone know if this product comes with deleted scenes? I bought How to Deal by itself & the dvd is useless as far as deleted scenes. At the time of its release, the company thought it would be a good idea to make you go online to watch them, by downloading Interactual media player. Interactual media player doesn't hold up well in 2011 & the website is gone! Just curious to know if this is the DVD edition I should buy or not.",1320192000,,433,4.166666666666667
2878427,4,B000S0SYIM,"I bought this for my daughter as she is a big Sarah Dessen fan and turned me on to the books as well. We both couldn't wait to see ""How To Deal"",  the interpretation of ""Someone Like You"" & ""That Summer"" combined.
All I can say is that it didn't do the book justice. Of course, they never do.
But it was a fairly good movie if you don't have expectations. It was an enjoyable distraction for the afternoon, but I can't say that I'd watch it again anytime soon.

As for ""Raise Your Voice"", I would say the same thing - an enjoyable distraction, but nothing that I would watch again too soon.",1267833600,,590,4.166666666666667

I had to take it to my local movie store and have them get the scratches out for $3.99. It works now, but it would've been nice not to have to go to the trouble.",1435536000,,297,3.806451612903226
