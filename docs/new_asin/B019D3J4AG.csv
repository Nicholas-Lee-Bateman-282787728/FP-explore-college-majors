7570401,4,B019D3J4AG,"I actually didn't buy off of Amazon, I got it at a record and movie store in New England. This flick is the kind of ultra sleazy and sophomoric stuff Troma would put out. You would probably be as much of a Mongoloid as the killer in the movie to buy it knowing what it is about and give it a negative review. Good on ya guys for making a helluva sleazy fun movie with a damn fine soundtrack.",1461024000,,391,3.962025316455696
7570402,5,B019D3J4AG,"Great movie, seen it a few times at some local screenings here in New Orleans. I've been looking forward to the DVD release of this movie for a few years now, glad to see that they were picked up by a distributor. If you are interested in a unique, funny, twisted, disgusting, perverse, and gory movie, this might be the perfect film for you.",1459209600,3,342,4.359375
7570403,5,B019D3J4AG,"This movie is great for all lovers of exploitation cinema. It has tons of blood,sex,and delicious violence. I was fortunate enough to attend a special screening. I cant wait to add this to my collection and show it to all of my friends. Terror Optics makes some good sleaze. COCKFACE FOREVER!!!!!!",1458777600,4,297,4.8431372549019605

8744767,1,B019D3J4AG,"This film fail to deliver ANYTHING  that horror fans pay money for.  Above all we want a lot of explicit VIOLENCE.  This film has very little violence and what it does meekly show  is so poorly done that there is no visceral  kick  to it at all.  Violence is much more powerful when the film makers are able to  put it in to some sort of context-  in a  really good horror film  ,we care.  The morons that made this tedious BORING video  seem to believe that the audience is SO DIMWITTED that having some idiot run around for no discernible reason with a dildo attached to his face is going to make the video transgressive  It does not. It just make it another  sad example of horror fans being cheated by the cynics  that have  ZERO  respect for the genre and the people who enjoy it.  ALSO  the sex in this film is CENSORED. A black box  appears blocking the explicit content.  I read the other reviews they are either phony,  written by horror dilettantes or people with severe challenges they have not yet over come.  I really began to love  horror with BLOOD FEAST  I saw it  the FIRST time it was released my point being it was long ago and I have seen a lot. DO NOT WASTE YOUR  MONEY  Don""T  let their greedy  ugly  perception of us  make them  richer.",1499472000,,1259,4.239316239316239
8744768,5,B019D3J4AG,"What a crazy flick! This is definitely a modern exploitation film that pushes the bar with hilarious lewdness and gross out gore. It sort of feels like Toxic Avenger meets early John Waters films with a blasting punk soundtrack. It's obviously a low budget movie but it's so full of sex, blood and rock n roll that it all adds up to be a great watch. A must see for fans of Troma and films like Satan's Sadists, Father's Day and Wild Zero.",1480291200,,439,4.301204819277109
8744769,1,B019D3J4AG,"I got through 15 minutes of this and that's because I fast forwarded it before figuring out what a waste of time and
money it was.  I only rented this film because the Amazon rating was 4 stars.
The first question that came to mind after I turned off this poorly funded poorly filmed joke was
""Who the hell thought this was worth 4 stars?"" I'm pretty sure someone was playing a joke on me.",1474848000,,389,4.1866666666666665

8744771,1,B019D3J4AG,"Not rated correctly.  Not advertised correctly!  Grossly misrepresented by false reviews and Amazon.  Don't waste your money.  This does not even make a cult film.

Amazon is allowing misrepresentation and making it hard for anyone to write what is really wrong with the movie to accuratley deter people from watching it.  If someone had written what this movie was really about I would not have spent money on it.  Think on that Amazon!",1464134400,,437,4.904109589041096
8744772,1,B019D3J4AG,"Don't be fooled by the positive reviews. This movie is just plain stupid. It is not a cult classic or good low budget movie. This is the type of movie that appeals to someone with about a 70 IQ. Everything is bad. Really, everything. Do not waste your time or money.",1463184000,,266,4.235294117647059
8744773,5,B019D3J4AG,"My fianc felt this would be a great date night movie. I don't care for horror films, and he's obsessed; I really doubted this would work. It was GREAT! Lots of laughs, gore, blood... And best of all, my favorite landmarks of NOLA featured in the backround. Can't wait to see the others!!",1462060800,2,287,4.433962264150943
8744774,5,B019D3J4AG,"If you bought this dvd you know you were getting a darn good adult only Dvd.... Grimewave  dvd is a Hit...I loved it...awesome flick!!  Way better than I imagined....####face killer is the the bomb'''''''now I WANT MORE !!!!!! GRIMEWAVE 4,5,6 LOVED THE WHOLE CAST YOU ALL ROCKED THIS DVD .",1461628800,,289,4.76
8744775,4,B019D3J4AG,"Wow! This is now my third outing into the world of the killer with the male appendage on his chin, and like the previous two it is filled to the brim with politically incorrect jokes, a nice amount of cheap gore (though this one used to many visual effects and not enough practical ones) nude women (and guys) and good pacing, so you won't get the urge to turn  it off half way through. Well some might, but honestly you'd have to be half brain dead if you bought this and found yourself offended by it.

My only problem is that Wild Eye decided it would be a good idea to censor this release. Seriously!! Huge black bars and squares covering up what ever they felt the viewer should not see. Dear Wild Eye, please, please never ever do that again....EVER! What's next you guys gonna release a book with five pages ripped from it because you didn't like it?

Well other then that, this is a darn fun way to spend 83 minutes. Recommended for anyone who likes Troma and is sick of politically correct MPAA approved crude.",1461369600,8,1019,4.380952380952381
8744776,1,B019D3J4AG,My husband and I were looking for a scary movie and came across this with 4.5 stars.  I have NO idea how anyone would rate this with 4.5 stars.  Was HORRIBLE.  Terrible production quality and started as more of a snuff/porno film.  We stopped watching after 5 minutes.  Do not waste your money!,1461369600,,294,4.471698113207547
