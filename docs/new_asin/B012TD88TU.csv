8726549,5,B012TD88TU,"Whether you're into Natural Horsemanship or more conventional riding, you're likely looking for the same thing: a quiet, soft unity with the horsel lightness, balance. Mark Russell has a quiet confidence that is contagious. His teaching style is clear, simple, do-able. He passes to the viewer both a sense that they can do this quiet work, as well as giving great real-time demonstrations. I've had a ball working this stuff all summer with a variety of horses. They are cooperative, calmness is deepening, and I love how quickly they understand releasing their jaw (which also improves acceptance of the bit). The horses do get this stuff If you're a fan of Nuno Olveira, you'll find this work quite compatible. This dvd also shows under saddle work.",1468454400,9,752,4.976190476190476
