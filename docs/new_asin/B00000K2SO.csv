1240012,4,B00000K2SO,"This is a god set for collectors with an attractive box and good variety of Bond films.  The only thing it lacks is George Lazernby.  This set has all of the Bonds except him.  All of the movies have their own flavor and  level of action.  The Bonds are all diferent as well.  Sean Connery being  the rough and cool secret agent with all the right moves.  Roger Moore  being the more romantic and wittier.  Timothy Daulton being the roughest of  the Bonds with a more ruthless edge.  Pierce Brosnan possibly being the  best Bond with the ruggedness of Connery and the witt of Moore.  All of the  Bonds are great, but it still could have had George Lazernby.",943747200,38,657,4.4033613445378155
1240013,5,B00000K2SO,"The reason that NSNA isn't included is because it is not an ""official"" movie.  MGM doesn't have the rights and therefore can't put it in its box set. Besides that movie is simply a second-rate  remake of TB.  Buy this box set and see the best of the real Bonds.",943660800,,261,4.18
1240014,4,B00000K2SO,"About half of the reviews I've read here at amazon.com have complained that MGM seems to have selected the movies for this set at random.  I must disagree with this.  They obviously wanted a variety of films, so they  chose from across the board.  They went with two of the most popular Sean  Connery vehicles (""Goldfinger"" and ""Thunderball""),  Roger Moore's first (""Live and Let Die"") and his most widely  acclaimed (""For Your Eyes Only""), Timothy Dalton's better outing  (""License to Kill"") and Pierce Brosnan's two films:  ""Goldneye"" and ""Tomorrow Never Dies."" (They excluded  the recently released ""The World Is Not Enough"" for obvious  reasons.)  Although I must admit that I would rather own a set that had  gone in chronological order and contained all 6 Connery outings and George  Lazenby's very good (though underrated) ""On Her Majesty's Secret  Service,"" I am very happy with the set that MGM did come up with.  ""Goldfinger"" is the best of the Bond flicks, and I truly enjoy  ""Thunderball,"" ""For Your Eyes Only,"" and  ""Goldeneye.""  (I haven't yet seen ""Live and Let Die."")  I can't figure out why ""Goldeneye"" has received so much criticism  while it's greatly inferior, semi-plotless predecessor (""Tomorrow  Never Dies"") is hailed as the best Brosnan film.  In any case, other  than ""TND,"" this is a great set.  Buy it and get the others that  follow.  Sean Connery enthusiasts should be pleased to learn that the final  set contains three of his films, including ""From Russia with  Love.""  Enjoy this set, and many thanks to MGM for putting it out  there for us.",947721600,118,1574,4.893129770992366
1240015,5,B00000K2SO,"""The James Bond Gift Set"" is a wonderful combination of Bond movies.  The set contains ""Goldfinger,"" ""Thunderball,"" ""Live and Let Die,"" ""For Your Eyes Only,"" ""Licence  To Kill,"" ""Goldeneye,"" and ""Tommorrow Never Dies.""  The rest of the Bond movies will be in two different sets, the first is  coming out in May 2000, the second sometime in fall 2000.  For those  wondering like myself before I got it there is no special intro before the  movies as in for example The Star Wars Special Edition Set, but you still  get exciting 007 entertainment while watching these 7 classic Bond films.",946771200,36,587,4.8
1240016,4,B00000K2SO,I had received this set as a gift in VHS format and found the quality of the tapes excellent. I recommend the set to anyne who still prefers to use VHS for what ever reason.,946512000,3,173,3.9714285714285715
1240017,5,B00000K2SO,"In this 7  movie collection you will be amazed and thrilled on how neat these movies are. I am a huge fan for James Bond and unlike the new stupid movies (the world is nor enough, tomarow never dies) it shows the old one  with Sean Conery, Roger Moore, and Timithy dalton I thought that this was  great.",946252800,4,303,4.189655172413793
1240018,5,B00000K2SO,I have not seen all of the James Bond movies but I think this is one of the best. It has alot of action and it has a good plot. I think Timothy Dalton did a great job. You should buy this video.,945388800,,194,3.5348837209302326

If you're a James Bond lover, this is for you! No 007 fan should  be without this! Each movie is packed with, romance, action, adventure, and  tons of Gadgets!

1240021,5,B00000K2SO,Absolutely astounding giftset! I loved it all! You should advertise your THX remastering though! The picture quality was fantastic! Maybe add a few more movies such as OHMSS or From Russia With Love and it'l do it!,944265600,2,214,4.8108108108108105
1240022,4,B00000K2SO,"This set is a very nice sampling of the Bond films,and the actors who have portrayed James Bond.  However as reviewer Alex R. stated there was one other actor who portrayed Bond in the official film series.  His name is  George Lazenby, the film, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"".  It  would have been nice to include the film in this set. For one,it was  Lazenby's only film as Bond. Also it is one of the best Bond movies ever.  Lazenby did a wonderful job! In fact he is closest to Sean Connery in  attitude and in physical build.  The story is also very well done.  How can  it not be good? Bond gets married in this one and deals with his moriarity  of the series the Evil Blofeld(with the best actor to have played  Blofeld...Telly Savalas).  So after you purchase this set from Amazon make  sure the next Bond film on your list is On Her Majesty's Secret Service!",944006400,,871,4.389937106918239

7914075,3,B00000K2SO,"Not a bad collection of Bond material, however, this is a mix of various Bond movies with a variety of leading Bond actors.  I recommend looking into the 1996 Collections that have the videos in chronological order and primarily by actor. JAMES BOND 007 Collector's Set, Vol. 1 includes all six Broccoli-produced Sean Connery Bond films, to include a 1995 documentary video. JAMES BOND 007 Collector's Set, Vol. 2 includes all seven Roger Moore films and Timothy Dalton's first film. Although these sets are out-of-print, they are still available as used and collector's sets through Amazon.com's Marketplace. If you're like most fans, you'd prefer to have the movies that include your own favorite ""leading-Bond-man""!",1083542400,3,718,5.298245614035087

7914077,5,B00000K2SO,"I think MGM did a great job selecting which movies go in which set. A lot of people think it would've been better to put the movies in order that they were released in, but people that buy these collector's sets are probably going to buy all 3. Therefore, they can put the movies in what ever order they want, so stop complaining!
  I also think that this set, Volume 1, is the best of the 3. The reason, each of the movies are the actor's better outings. Also, it has the best bond movie ever, ""Goldfinger"" and a close second, ""GoldenEye."" In addition to these 2 great movies it has 2 decent Roger Moore Films, ""Live And Let Die"" and ""For Your Eyes Only."" Finally, it has Timothy Dalton's better movie, ""Licence To Kill,"" Pierce Brosnan's seriously underrated, ""Tomorrow never Dies,"" and a solid Connery film, ""Thunderball.""
  My only complaint is that, for the amount of money you pay for the VHS version, you don't get any extras like you do for the DVD version. And I don't have the 300+ Dollars to buy the DVD's, so I must settle for the VHS. But, I bought it for the movies, not the extras,...5 STARS!!",1013731200,8,1108,4.390243902439025
7914078,5,B00000K2SO,"What more could you ask for? Finally you can stop searching for each individual movie, wasting time looking for a single video, when you can have them all. I was always confused about which James Bond film came first. But now I know, now that I got all three volumes, I know which one comes first and last. The older films are better, though.
Here's how I would rate each one (from oldest to newest):
1. Goldfinger ***1/2 (1964) 2. Thunderball ***1/2 (1965) 3. Live and Let Die *** (1973) 4. For Your Eyes Only *** (1981) 5. Licence to Kill **** (1989) 6. GoldenEye ***1/2 (1995) 7. Tomorrow Never Dies **1/2 (1997)
Eventhough I have said the oldest were the better, I still think of 'Licence to Kill' as my favorite Bond Film. It's just that there are more older films that are better than new films. I gave 'Tomorrow Never Dies' **1/2 because it wasn't as good as GoldenEye and it looked like it was saying ""Bond films are going to be bad, starting from there"".",998006400,11,963,4.415730337078652
7914079,5,B00000K2SO,"The movies of James Bond have become more exciting over the years. Starting with Sean Connery, I would say that the character(James Bond) has not really changed. The actions of Connery, Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan all  help to make 007 come alive. All movies in this set are wonderful and many  people are looking forward to the next two sets.",955065600,2,342,4.683333333333334
7914080,4,B00000K2SO,"I think that Bond films, as a rule, have a certain formula which must be obeyed at all times: the world must be in jeopardy, the villain must be an insane egomaniac whose plot for world domination is ridiculously overdone  yet somehow plausible (oh, and having an eccentric cast of Bond-hating  henchmen is a definate plus), the action must be fast and furious, and the  locales must be beautiful and exotic. And, naturally, Bond's female costars  must all be ravishingly beautiful women. This Bond collection gives  007-philes a chance to see Bond at his best, and worst.
First we have  Pierce Brosnan's first two Bond films: ""Goldeneye"" and  ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", both good films that revived the Bond  franchise. ""Tomorrow"", in particular, showcases some excellent  acting on the part of Brosnan, and an interesting plot (since  ""information is power"" is an concept that has been widely  accepted in the 1990s with the internet, having a villain more interested  in dominating information rather than countries was certainly topical).
The collection also has two of Sean Connery's best Bond flicks,  ""Thunderball"" and ""Goldfinger"". Both films are Connery  at the top of his game- suave, sophisticated, witty and full of fun. Both  films feature exciting action sequences and ravishingly beautiful  women.
Roger Moore's two films are mixed bags. ""Live And Let  Die"" isn't particularly good. Cool title song by Paul McCartney, but  Moore was feeling his way through the role (this is his first 007 film). I  didn't much care for Jane Seymour, and the absence of Q bugged me.  ""For Your Eyes Only"", on the other hand, is Moore's best 007  flick. Terrifically exciting action sequences (I particularly enjoyed the  ski chase between Bond and one of the villains), and good dialouge really  give Moore a chance to shine in this film. Oh, and the presence of  absolutely stunning vistas of Greek mountains, beaches and the beautiful  Mediterranean sea certainly fulfills my requirement of ""beautiful and  exotic"" locales.
Finally we come to Timothy Dalton's contribution:  ""License to Kill"". The worst 007 film? Maybe, although I think  that Moore's ""View to a Kill"" will hold that dubious honor for  quite some time to come. I give the screenwriters credit for breaking the  usual 007 saves-the-world plot with a tale of Bond out for revenge against  Felix Leiter's killers, which gives Dalton an opportunity to flex his  muscles as an actor by giving Bond different motivations than the usual.  Dalton is a marvelously talented actor, but totally wrong for the part of  007 and ""License to Kill"" feels all wrong for a Bond film. The  change in format is not what bothers me- it is just that this was done so  poorly. The villain is not threatening, the women bland and not  particularly glamorous, and Bond's adventures are kind of dull in this one.  Too bad.
Still, 5 out of 7 ain't bad. Bond fans will be very, very happy  with this set.",952214400,18,2939,4.932515337423313
7914081,5,B00000K2SO,"Finally the best series of movies has been put together.  This first wave of seven is outstanding.  From the Sean Connery days to the new age Pierce Brosnan, James Bond is always action packed and  full of class and style.  It's the best gift I received under the tree this year.  I just can't wait  for the other two companion sets to be released!",950313600,,348,4.359375
