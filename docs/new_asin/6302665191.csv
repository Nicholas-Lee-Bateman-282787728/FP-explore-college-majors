7829049,5,6302665191,"As a youth, back in the 1980s, I never particularly looked forward to the start of the school week.  The long tedium of the academic routine grated on me.  Even though the school day only lasted about six and half hours, ten minutes could seem like eternity to my nine year old self.  The silver lining around the dark cloud of the school week though was the voyages through time and space, in the blue police box, I went on with the Doctor, his winsome female companions, and robotic dog K-9, at 5:30-6:00 Monday-Friday on PBS.  The premise, the heroes, the monsters, the use of the British countryside and quarries as the setting, the dialogue, the humor, and music all combined to create the perfect television series, IMO.  There was never a dull moment and those 30 minutes seemed to fly by at the speed of light.  After a few years, PBS pulled DW from its late afternoon broadcast, and I moved on to other interests.
In 1996, whilst browsing through the video store, I came across this gem which was about Tom Baker watching and commenting on clips from all of his stories, during his era as the Doctor, from 1974-1981, years later.  1992 to be precise.  It was a great deal of fun to watch an older, grayer, and slightly more corpulent Tom comment on the series with hindsight for three hours.  I just wish it could have been a tad bit longer...",1507334400,,1352,4.485714285714286
7829050,5,6302665191,"This is in VHS format but well worth it, Tom gives an episode by episode account of his memories on that filming. I know Tom is one of the most popular Doctors, and this video also lets you hear in his own words what he thought of the different actress and actors he worked with, even K-9. So, dig out that old VHS player and hook up with Tom Baker.",1373673600,,349,4.0
7829051,5,6302665191,"I used to love to watch Dr. Who as a kid and made sure i was in front of the tv whenever it was coming on. If i'm right, it used to come on during the week on public tv channel 12, right after a show called contact. Tom baker in my opinion was the best of all the dr. who's throughout the shows length. he certainly was the most witty and ever so logical you just couldn't stand it. None the less Dr. who solved every problem with lightning speed and his deep intellect, and also that neat sonic screwdriver for pressing mechanical failures. I don't care how cheesy those stage props were or special effects, tom baker is my hero. Now to the video, I hadn't seen dr who in a very long time and rented this at the local video store one day. It really took me back on a voyage in time and long forgotten episodes of the show. Tom kicks back and watches old clips of himself and then reviews all that went on during the making of each episode, funny at times how the dr. forgets the names of some of the episodes. If your truly an absolute die hard fan of tom baker, this is the right stuff for you. This was an absolute pleasure to sit and watch.",1239062400,3,1144,4.066371681415929
7829052,4,6302665191,"The video does a nice job of spanning Tom's entire 7 year run as Dr. Who as they show him clips from his episodes and ask him to comment. Many times he has little to nothing to say, often he will speak about the other British actors in the scene, and rarely he will share a humourous or touching vinette about the scene.

I'd recommend it to anyone who loved the Tom Baker years as I did. I will admit that Tom's melonchaly and self-deprectiating comments especially towards the end began to drag me down into the same funk he appeared to be in by the end. Still, if you love Tom and his time as the Doctor you will want to see this.",1234224000,,633,4.104838709677419
7829053,5,6302665191,"""The Tom Baker Years"" is a fine collection of scenes and other material from Tom Baker's seven years as the Doctor. No ""Doctor Who"" fan would want to miss this one! Grade: A+",1079654400,4,174,4.303030303030303
7829054,5,6302665191,"Tom Baker is arguably the best actor to ever portray the enigmatic figure of the Doctor. In this video we see a change of format for the 'Doctor Who Years' tape, by having the main actor, Tom Baker, watch scenes from every who story he was involved in, to give unscripted comments about his feelings, memories and friendships during his period.
You'll find that Tom's reaction to nearly every story is interesting, ranging from joy, to confusion, to regret but most of all satisfaction. Whether you're a fan or just a casual viewer from Tom's time on WHO, you'll enjoy this immensely, if not for the sheer joy but the nostalgic value attached to it. RECOMMENDED!!",1051056000,5,663,4.724137931034483
7829055,5,6302665191,"The Tom Baker Years is possibly the best insight into the world of Dr Who The Tom Baker years to date. It's a warts an all episode guide, and Tom really shines once he begins to remember the stories. Tom is rarely seen talking about individual stories so this is a great chance for fans to actually get his thoughts as he views each story. Some of the clips are somewhat vague & it is little wonder that Tom sometimes has trouble recollecting the story concerned, but when he does it's well worth the wait. You can see that Tom is actually enjoying what he is seeing & it is, obvious alot of what he is seeing is the first time he has viewed it since it was recorded. He, as always, adds his own interesting recollections to each epsiode and often adds untold stories that every fan enjoys. It is also worthy to note Tom's  affection for Lalla Ward when Viewing the scenes of him & her in Paris. He is almost lost for words & is obviously very moved by his memories of that time. This is an excellent piece of fan loving video & in my book is worth every penny. Tom is the oldest remaining Dr, and it is wonderful to hear his recollections of the time he spent on his, and i quote, ""one & only success"". Tom enjoys his time on this tape, which ensures that you do too. This is an absolute must for all Dr Wo/ Tom Baker Fans. If you haven't got it yet...WHY NOT!!! Go get it NOW!!!",991180800,13,1380,4.149253731343284

7829057,4,6302665191,"The format of this tape is simple: set Tom Baker (whom many consider to  have been the greatest Doctor) down in front of a TV, and show him a  variety of clips from Doctor Who episodes where Tom Baker played the  Doctor.  In the process, Tom will share anecdotes and memories from his  time in the role, inspired from these clips (which he allegedly had had no  preparation for).
 At first, Tom is a little stiff and uncomfortable,  and his cheerfulness seems forced.  After a bit, however, he seems to  settle into the role, and opens up a bit more, relaxing with the viewing  audience.  He has a number of interesting or amusing stories from his years  as the Doctor (some off-color, though, alas, he keeps any racy details to  himself!), which give a very cool backdrop to familiar episodes.  You can  tell he really enjoyed his time as the Doctor and, it seems, regrets  leaving when he did.  I know I wouldn't have minded a few more seasons of  the bohemian with the hat and scarf Doctor....",968371200,15,996,4.49438202247191
7829058,5,6302665191,You know its truly amazing that American  filmakers have not taken advantage of Tom  Baker's rich acting ability... I find him  extremely interesting and this tape proves  he is one-of-a-kind! I have watched this  program so much that another needs to be ordered soon! You will love  Baker's eccentricities and his  uncanny ability to keep you interested  throughout the performance... but I have one complaint- I want more. C'mon  BBC & Dr. Who give us more of Tom Baker.  Ciao...,946944000,,481,4.9
