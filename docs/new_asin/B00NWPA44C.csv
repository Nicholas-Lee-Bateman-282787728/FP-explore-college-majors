6683957,5,B00NWPA44C,Great movie documentary 5 star,1422057600,,30,5.2
6683958,5,B00NWPA44C,"This movie gives a broad insight of Manny Pacquiao, the person. At age 36, Pacquiao had already so many twists and turns in his life, an hour and 28 minutes run time does not seem long enough to delve deeper in some interesting subplots. It would be interesting to dig deeper into the story on how Pacquiao and boxers in general, are milked dry of their blood by the promoters and business managers.

Freddy Roach, Pacquiao's trainer, comes across as the father figure, mentor and protector. Roach's sincere and honest demeanor makes him an endearing character in this biopic. Alex Ariza, Pacquiao's erstwhile conditioning coach is the brother and friend figure. Forget the fact that Ariza had a falling out with Roach and was working on the opposing camp during the Pacquiao-Rios match in Macau, Ariza is given a ""bida"" (protagonist) treatment in this movie. Any good movie needs to have a ""kontrabida"" or a bunch of bad guys to make for a good entertaining and compelling story. Ironically, though he has not come face to face with each other yet, Floyd Mayweather gets the top villain billing over Juan Manuel Marquez, the fighter who knocked Pacquiao out in the 6th round of their fourth encounter. Mayweather is the haughty ""Ivan Drago"" to Pacquiao's ""Rocky Balboa"" persona. (As a side note, I have a reason to believe this movie is build up to what could be the boxing history's biggest match in Pacquiao vs Mayweather, IF it ever happens.)

Manny the movie is not just about Manny the fighter. It is the story of Manny, the impoverished kid who fought fearlessly (at times recklessly) who struggled all the way on and off the boxing ring to become the hero and icon that he is now. It has the plot twists of a man who found money and success and then had had to struggle with sins and vices and the bitter defeat that followed after it; and the eventual reformation and redemption on the ring.

Pacquiao: ""What difference can I make? What gives life meaning? I came from nowhere, now I am everywhere.""

The main theme of the movie is that Manny Pacquiao traversed too many bridges that are far to cross for an ordinary fellow. ""The question now is what bridge is too far for Manny Pacquiao to cross?""",1422057600,14,2207,4.651282051282052
6683959,5,B00NWPA44C,A story about rags to riches in a very hard and dangeous way. Manny is phenomenal. This is a five star movie documentary and I recommend this to everyone. My only hope is that Mayweather would finally agree to fight Manny.,1421971200,10,222,4.439024390243903

8680816,4,B00NWPA44C,"Opening with an intense sequence of highlights and lowlights from one of boxing legend Manny Pacquiao's many fights with Juan Manuel Marquez, the documentary film, Manny, hopes to quickly establish that in fighting, just as in life, things don't always go as planned. Within the opening moments, we see Manny Pacquiao, for whom the film is named, eat shot after shot. Then get dropped to the mat.

""If you're a fighter, truly a fighter, then you get back up.""

Those are the words of celebrity narrator Liam Neeson, setting the stage for the film's ultimate purpose: to establish Pacquiao as courageous, determined, and tough.

He is most certainly that.

Manny spends much of its 87 minutes showing the man behind the boxer who has held titles in eight different weight classes. Pacquiao hails from the humblest of beginnings. Raised in a hut in the war-torn Philippines by his mother, Pacquiao recounts how, ""Sometimes we would go days without eating."" To help his family, he dropped out in the sixth grade. By age 13, he realized he needed to do more to raise his family out of povertyand so he snuck away from home to become a professional boxer.

What sounds like the plot of a campy novel actually happened. The film shows footage of fight after fight in which a small, scrawny, teenage Pacquiao competes, dominating and then knocking out opponent after opponent.

The name he builds for himself begins to grow, and with it his world.

The highly entertaining film includes a chorus of voices from Pacquiao's life as he moved from the Philippines to the United States to pursue his boxing dreams. From his family, coaches, and trainers to sports journalists and even the celebrities who sought to be a part of his entourage, the film offers a wide variety of perspectives on Pacquiao. Hollywood stars Mark Wahlberg, Jeremy Piven, Jimmy Kimmel, and boxing greats like Evander Holyfield weigh in on Pacquiao's legacy and what makes him such a tremendous fighter and charismatic individual.

In an enjoyable but clear marketing attempt to hype the then-unscheduled but highly clamored for Mayweather-Pacquiao superfight, Manny does much to charm the viewer into liking its star. Pacquiao is presented as a dedicated family man, a driven humanitarian, an adorably terrible singer (with singing aspirations!), and the victim of exploitation at the hands of crooked promoters. Meanwhile, Floyd Mayweather, whose role in the film is small, is portrayed as a WWE-style heelan individual so self-interested and contemptible, that the viewer is forced to want Pacquiao to punch his face off.

The overall film is a great ride: Manny is a popcorn documentary with a compelling story, some big stars, and a solid mix of action and humor. Whereas the documentary may fall short for die-hard fight fans, who might desire true insight into his Pacquiao's training habits or technique (and will find little of that here), the casual sports fan will likely be satisfied with the story of a boy who came from nothing but fought his way to fame and fortune.",1504656000,,3044,4.964636542239686
8680817,5,B00NWPA44C,As a boxing fan I always loved watching Manny but this movie really opened my eyes to the man. Like all of us he is not perfect but he really strives to help others and give back. His story is one that is inspirational and moving.,1496620800,2,230,4.021739130434782
8680818,5,B00NWPA44C,"This movie is great. It speaks for the life of the one and only champion Manny Pacquiao not only for the Filipino people who loves boxing very much

8680820,4,B00NWPA44C,"Great documentary. It was good to see the early video of him as a boxer, where he came from and how he evolved as a world class boxer. Pacquiao is one of the greatest boxers. He has the talent, skills, speed, and will but too many distractions pressured his career as a boxer.  He could be been even more legendary had he just focused on boxing and not get caught up with getting into politics and movie stuff.",1494547200,,410,4.256410256410256
