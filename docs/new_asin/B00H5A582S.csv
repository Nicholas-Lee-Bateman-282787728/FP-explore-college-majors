8630178,4,B00H5A582S,Very interesting story line and very entertaining. Liked it very much.,1518307200,,70,5.454545454545454
8630179,5,B00H5A582S,"Sensational. Ingenious. Powerful. This story exposes and exploits our greatest hopes, fears, dreams and fantasies. The impossible things we think about (but never tell) are exposed in this masterful production. Since this is a time travel, watching it makes you think twice about what it would be like to go back in time and change history. Undoing one event ultimately creates other problems. This is the greatest production I have ever seen.",1435536000,2,443,5.166666666666667
8630180,5,B00H5A582S,"My number 1 Korean Drama EVER. As of this writing I have watched 130 Korean dramas and since this is my number 1 you know how high a place I have elevated this one. If you don't want to spend the money on DVDs then you can watch on Dramafever. (Best viewed on a ROKU device on your HDTV large screen TV. Those shots of the Himalayas just don't cut it on a laptop, tablet, or cell phone, folks!",1425686400,3,393,3.9873417721518987
8630181,5,B00H5A582S,"This K-Drama is spectacular, I couldn't stop watching. Episode after episode it kept me wanting more. The DVD is a little expensive, but that is to be expected since it is imported, and is based off of an international price range. I would suggest watching this drama over Drama Fever ([...]) until there is a lower price or possibility of purchasing to download.",1390262400,4,363,4.777777777777778
