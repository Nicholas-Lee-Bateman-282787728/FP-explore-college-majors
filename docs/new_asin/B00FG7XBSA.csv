5990942,5,B00FG7XBSA,"Freestyle is a excellent hip hop documentary that not only explains the history of freestyle hip hop but also includes tons of insider footage.  It's a amazing cultural tale of a that remains timeless and relevant .  If you are in to hip hop or ethnomusicology this is a must see.  Lots of footage of well know artists with behind the scenes footage of them recording rhyming and chatting about the art.

You will come away from this movie with an altered perspective on hip-hop and art.",1397001600,,244,4.6976744186046515
8615520,5,B00FG7XBSA,"Still one of the best movies about hip hop ever. It is such an ALIVE and authentic experience. It really BREATHES the music, almost into you when you watch it. Props to the filmmakers for the spontaneous fluid editing style which is like a freestyle in and of itself. I love the mix of local neighborhood freestyle heroes, east and west coast, and also intimate footage of some of the legends of main stream hip hop showing off their freestyle skills. A must see film. I've been a fan since the film came to my college years ago as part of the Hip Hop Film Festival. Now its a creative touchstone for me. I watch it whenever I need a dose of CREATIVE ALIVENESS! Glad it finally made it to Amazon instant video.",1396828800,,710,4.345864661654136
8615521,5,B00FG7XBSA,"Best doc I've seen in years, this film delves into the personalities that made Freestlye.  Watch how these masters turn poetry into art and make it come alive. As relevant as when first released, Freestlye: The Art of Rhyme is a must see for anyone who loves music.",1396742400,,265,4.520833333333333
8615522,5,B00FG7XBSA,"When I first checked out this film, I was 21 years old strolling around Albuquerque, NM and saw the DVD version of the film up for sale at a local hip-hop shop. It blew my mind; there's ""Scratch"" and ""The Freshest Kids"" for all the DJs and Break dancers, but never did I see a movie that was directly focused on the ART of freestyling. I wasn't disappointed.

*Flash forward five years and this film still holds up. I recently watched it again and was blown away with the incredible footage of rappers such as Mos Def, Boots Riley, Jurassic 5, and COUNTLESS others ripping up real freestyle sessions. I was also incredibly engaged with how the film incorporated the ""spiritual"" nature of the Art of Freestyling. Beyond just learning about the various ways people get involved with freestyle (such as rap, dance, battling, etc.), the film develops an idea that being able to freestyle connects one with the universe in a way that most people will never understand. It takes this true art and describes it in a manner that will make you feel great every time you rhyme a couple of words together.

This was literally one of the best documentaries, let alone movies, I've ever seen. TYBG",1396742400,,1184,4.633333333333334
