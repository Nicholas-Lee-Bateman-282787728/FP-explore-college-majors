8529449,4,B008P76Y64,"This disc provides choices that contrast quite markedly with other visual options currently available as regards performance and recording.

Firstly it needs to be stated that the imaging is undoubtedly the best of this music on disc so far and is obviously HD imaging with good crispness and colour definition throughout. The lack of any form of surround sound comes as rather a surprise therefore, especially from a recording made as recently as 2010. The supplied stereo is good quality though. Bearing that in mind, once again, there is a reduction of stereo effect by having all the violins on the left and all the cellos on the right. This seems to be rather an unusual arrangement these days.

The concert starts with rather a serious performance of the Egmont Overture. The main allegro section is steady rather than exciting and this matches the mood cast by the opening slow introduction. The generally serious approach to the music making continues throughout the Triple concerto. This is well played and in particular features some really sensitive cello playing by Zuill Bailey. His opening to the middle movement is especially melting. However, one has only to turn to the concert given by Argerich and the Capucon brothers at the Roque d'Antheron in 2005 to notice a far more vibrant approach with a greater range of dynamics, phrasing and general liveliness throughout. The downside of that recording may be for some, the outside nature of the venue where the sound includes chirruping insects. It is also only available as a stereo DVD. Musically it is, to my mind, far more outwardly involving but the recording is inferior to the new disc.

The final item in this concert is a genial and well played version of Beethoven's Pastoral. In this the peasants indulge in rather muted merrymaking and the storm is equally well behaved. These two specific observations illustrate Perlman's approach to the whole work, which as mentioned above, is genial rather than vibrant throughout. This is a full orchestra version of the work. One has only to watch the DVD of Abbado's version with a reduced BPO to hear how a storm can really thunder and how the peasants can be really joyful. Once again, Abbado's older DTS recording cannot match that of the new disc, even though it is only in stereo. The imaging of the new disc is far superior to either of the alternatives mentioned above

The short encore to the concerto of an arrangement of a Schubert impromptu for the trio notably has all the relaxation and joie de vivre absent elsewhere. Smiles on faces may be significant in this respect. The arrangement is remarkably similar to Viennese cafe music and is delightful.

In conclusion therefore, I would suggest that this very well played but somewhat emotionally subdued concert nevertheless makes for a reasonably enjoyable concert experience but may not wear quite so well for repeat playing if any potential purchaser values spontaneity or dramatic drive as essential ingredients. (The companion 75th Anniversary concert with Mehta is an altogether different proposition and is riveting from start to finish - and with DTS sound as well!). The glory of this disc is the quality of the visual recording. This also makes the most of the music making by accurately following the progress of the music as it passes around the soloists and the orchestral players thus involving the viewer effectively and sustaining interest.",1359072000,2,3436,4.989528795811518
