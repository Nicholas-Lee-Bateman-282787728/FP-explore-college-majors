1966806,5,B00012FNCM,"I love Kundalini Yoga and I absolutely love this new series of Kundalini DVDs and Videos by Ravi Singh and Ana Brett called Fat Free Yoga. I have been practicing this form of Yoga for years and have always found Ravi Singh an excellent teacher and dedicated Yoga master. I own many of Ravi's earlier instructional videos and have always found them the perfect way to enhance and sharpen my Kundalini study. Ravi's teaming up with Ana Brett has brought these DVDs and Videos to an even higher level. Her form is amazing and precise. She is strong without looking like she lifts weights. My girlfriend and I practice along to one of the DVDs every morning when we get up. We usually rotate our workouts going through each of the 3 DVDs (1 a day) and then starting them over again. After we finish we are always charged and ready to face the day. We have both taken off weight due to our daily practice along to Ravi and Ana's instruction. Both my girlfriend and I have more energy and are sleeping better also.
For those new to this form of Yoga, Kundalini is different from other forms. It is an all body workout and therapeutic practice helping your organs as well as your muscles, skeletal structure and mental well being. It will actually help to remove toxins from your body, from organs like your liver and kidneys. Following the instruction on these DVDs and Videos give my girlfriend and I a total body workout.
I recommend the complete Fat Free Yoga series by Ravi Singh and Anna Brett without hesitation.",1073865600,5,1512,4.5625

1966808,5,B00012FNCM,"I'm what you might call a typical American male. I drink beer on weekends. Sometimes more then I should. And even though I work out when I can I am not above indulging in a cheeseburger with fries once in awhile.
Lately I had been feeling bloated and nauseous alot. My girlfriend, who happens to be a yoga instructor, told me it was probably my liver and bought me the Yoga Cleanse tape. I have to say it is not what I expected. I though yoga was standing on your head and stretching and different poses. This was one of those things that I couldn't even imagine. Lots of breathing and novel exercises. I have to say it gets right to the point which I liked.
I have been doing this three times a week. If I don't have time to do the whole thing I just do 20 minutes which is enough to help turn my day around and put me on a good track.
I feel alot better. This tape has inspired me to get my act together.
I would recommend Yoga Cleanse to everyone sinceI don't think there is anyone who couldn't use a little detoxing.
I hope this review helped.",1072828800,11,1047,4.137254901960785
8005494,5,B00012FNCM,"This is my fourth Kundalini dvd by Anna and Ravi. Amazing. You feel fabulous. It's like having a colonic without the discomfort. It leaves me feeling amazing. The meditation chant at the end is gorgeous. And after doing this dvd three times I went to my reflexologist and she was amazed to find my liver was totally clean. She said she's never encountered anyone before with a totally clean liver. Woohoo. Thanks, guys. I feel it. This has to be the most enjoyable way to look after your liver and your body. Fun.",1274400000,,513,4.526881720430108
8005495,5,B00012FNCM,"Sat naam, I have been practicing and teaching Kundalini Yoga since 2000, and I would totally recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to start their KY practice and especially to anyone who wants to lose weight and is willing to work at it! One of my students who did the Fat Free set on this DVD several days a week, plus 1-2 KY classes each week, lost over 70 pounds in less than a year. Those kind of results obviously take more discipline, but for you slacker yogis, Kundalini Yoga is a type of yoga that gets you more results, more quickly, than Hatha yoga. By using the breath with movement, and keeping up with an exercise for longer periods of time, you can get up to 18 times more results than the same poses in Hatha or other kinds of yoga. It's a great practice for this day & age where our lives are busy and complicated and we feel we don't ""have"" enough time. Just start by committing to a few minutes each day, then practice a few minutes more, to build up your practice at your own pace, and feel great!!!",1213315200,,1017,4.247422680412371
8005496,5,B00012FNCM,"This is a very energizing and harmonizing work out that helps to cleans and center. The whole workout is well structured with relaxation and short meditation sessions, which was perfect for centering. I did this work out on the weekend after a very tiring week. The results were amazing. I felt like I had a very refreshing holiday in just 60 min.",1194739200,,347,4.612903225806452
8005497,1,B00012FNCM,"I bought this tape thinking it was a new Ravi Singh tape...but to my surprise it was an old tape I already ordered 4 yrs.ago with a new wrapping and a woman on the front cover that has nothing to do with the one that does the yoga in the tape. This ought to be forbidden since you can't return the videos once you open them. I felt they stole my money. What kind of ""morality"" does ravi singh have to do something like this?? I'll NEVER buy any of his tapes again.",1100649600,3,464,4.0
8005498,5,B00012FNCM,These are not like other yoga tapes. There is no logical sequence of static poses like other methods in which I have trained. Here the workout almost feels like playtime with its ballistic vigorous energetic movements.  There are times when you can recognize something close to a regular asana but nothings ever static. I love it! I realized that my other practice had been making me more tense. These workouts are a breath of fresh air. Ravi Singh is a very good teacher. Very intelligent with an inspiring flow of  talk. Ana Brett is an excellent model and moves like a dancer. It is a joy to have them in my living room! The emphasis is on the breathing. There is a warm-up and stretching on both tapes I have (yoga Cleanse and Total Tune Up). And meditation too. I also like how you can break things up though so far I haven't had to. I recommend these.,1078012800,2,857,4.417721518987341
8005499,3,B00012FNCM,"This video was my first experience with kundalini yoga, which I found to be different.  Throughout the practice, there were only a few yoga poses which I recognized from my prior practice of hatha yoga for the past several years.  This workout placed an even greater emphasis on breathing than my other yoga tapes; specifically, the ""Breath of Fire,"" a rapid form of inhaling and exhaling which is purported to result in all kinds of benefits.

The workout is broken down into four approximately 17 minute segments.  Ravi Singh provides instruction but does not participate--he sits on a cushion in the corner while model Catherine Quinn performs the movements.  The first segment (which is actually about 22 minutes) serves as a warmup, and it begins with simple breathing and stetching.  The Breath of Fire is introduced here, but little instruction is provided on this technique.  Left Nostril Breathing is also used, and the segment ends with a lying relaxation (Ravi notes that you can skip to the next section if you prefer to keep active).

In Segment 2, called ""Fight Fire with Fire,"" there is an even greater focus on the Breath of Fire, which is performed while holding various static positions--eg, lying on your back with your head and shoulders up and one leg raised.  This 17 minute segment ends with practice of the Cooling Breath.  The third segment, ""No Impact Aerobics,"" is very similar, and it repeats some of the exercises from the second section.  Some new exercises are added, such as a modified pushup on one leg--it's fairly easy to perform, but there are many repetitions.  There is more practice with the Breath of Fire, and the Serenity Breath is also introduced.  This segment ends with another lying relaxation and comes in at about 15 minutes.

The final segment is titled ""Your Life is in Your Own Glands,"" and thus the exercises are specifically designed to stimulate various glands.  Following these movements, there is an extended period of seated meditation as well as an extended lying reaction for a total of 16 minutes.  (Brief periods of meditation and relaxation--including rolling up and down on your back to relax your spine--are also interspersed throughout the workout.)

What I liked about this workout was how the energizing bursts using the Breath of Fire were combined with periods of meditation and relaxation.  However, I found it hard to believe that the practice would have the weight loss benefits which Ravi Singh repeatedly claimed; in fact, I didn't like the fact that Ravi was so focused on weight issues throughout the workout.  I also found it strange--and even somewhat condescending--that he just sat in the corner providing instruction during the workout.  His overall style just did not mesh very well with me, including his tendency to spout off in rhyming couplets.  This workout might be better suited to those already familiar with kundalini yoga rather than newbies to the method like myself.

NOTE:  There is an updated version of this workout called ""Fat Free Yoga--New & Improved"" which features Ana Brett, not Catherine Quinn; see Ravi Singh and Ana Brett's web site (raviana.com) for more details.",1077235200,4,3170,4.996190476190476
8005500,2,B00012FNCM,"Comments about Ana Brett (for or against) aren't appropriate for ""Lose Weight and Feel Great"". She doesn't do any of the exercises. She never even appears on camera. Anyone claiming to have done these routines while supposedly following her lead is pulling your leg (to put it nicely). Or else they're confused with other Ravi Singh products which do feature the two of them. It would be nice if more people who've actually seen this dvd/video would review it, instead of the person who keeps re-posting under various pseudonyms who clearly hasn't seen it, yet alone done the yoga. Some people have too much time on their hands.
As for the routines on ""Lose Weight and Feel Great"", you likely won't lose weight. Though they're all right if you like kundalini yoga. But Ravi spouts several weight loss myths which have been proven to be false. And while it's true most yoga has been around for thousands of years as Ravi claims, that certainly isn't true of kundalini yoga. Ravi and other KY instructors were trained by Yogi Bhajan (or his students, none of whom studied in India where yoga originates). Bhajan made up the kundalini yoga moves when he moved to North America a few decades ago. Prior to immigrating to the U.S. Bhajan was a taxi driver. He's a controversial bloke and many argue he's more a cult leader/con artist than yoga master. If you want to know more about that there's plenty of info on the net written by his ex-devotees who feel sorely taken advantage of. I won't get into the specifics here. It just makes for an interesting story and is part of the real story behind kundalini yoga's origins.
The most beneficial part of kundalini yoga (and yes it's true, people often feel great afterwards) is the breathing. But then that's true of any type of yoga, including the more authentic types such as ashtanga and hatha yoga, and their derivatives, such as Iyengar. As for the reviewer(s) who can't say enough wonderful things about Ana Brett, I suggest you review Ravi's other dvds or videos on which the woman actually makes an appearance. Watching them first (and actually trying them) would be a good idea, too.",1076976000,4,2135,4.726541554959786
8005501,3,B00012FNCM,"I enjoy doing these routines.  I love how you can choose between four 17 minute workouts, so even when I'm short on time I can fit at least one in. I have other great kundalini yoga dvds and videos by other KY instructors whom I prefer, yet the short routines on this one are convenient and complement the others.
On one hand, I was also very relieved when I got this. Thankfully it's the original ""Lose Weight and Feel Great"", which was filmed some time ago. So Catherine Quinn still demonstrates the exercises, not Ana Brett, who's shown on the cover. Catherine Quinn looks fit, healthy and strong, and doesn't have the emaciated look of Ana Brett. It's nothing against Ana, but I spent many years around dancers in dance school, dancers who usually had the same painfully thin look bordering on anorexia (it was no accident many had eating disorders as we were pressured to keep our weight down). Catherine Quinn is a healthier role model and at least she looks like an adult woman and not an underdeveloped 11 year old. When my boyfriend saw Ana on this cover he said ""Someone give that girl something to eat!"". It's too bad Ravi decided to call the series ""Fat Free"" AND feature Ana in them. Adult men wouldn't do a fat free yoga workout featuring a guy with an 11 year old's body and say ""Gee, I want to look like that too"". It's silly. But Catherine Quinn is great, so kudos to her.
I also like Ravi's video ""In Style Yoga"" which features another demonstrator and my favourite female yogi from all of his videos and dvds. ""In Style Yoga"" has short routines too, so is every bit as convenient. It's strange how Ravi put Ana's name and picture on the ""Lose Weight and Feel Great"" cover, when in fact the credit is due to Catherine Quinn and Catherine does a beautiful job. She even manages to get through the routines without making any faces, which wouldn't be easy considering how Ravi Singh talks nonstop. But after a while you learn to tune him out. Of all his Fat Free workouts this is the best one and the only one I've hung onto from the series. Check out Ravi's ""In Style Yoga"", plus kundalini yoga videos and dvds by Donna Davidge and Erin Kamler... I give this 3 stars, will raise it to 4 stars if Ravi puts Catherine Quinn back on the cover instead of Ana.",1076112000,5,2272,4.422434367541766
