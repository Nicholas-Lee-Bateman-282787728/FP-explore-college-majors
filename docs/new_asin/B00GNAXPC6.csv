8625062,5,B00GNAXPC6,"Love this movie!  If you are a fan of the 80's this is a must watch.  I don't think this movie got much notoriety, but it is very funny with an underrated cast.  Dan Fogler is hilarious!  My roommate and myself have watched it about 10 times now and laugh are way through it each time.  Check it out if you are looking for something you haven't seen and need a good laugh.

Also, the soundtrack is awesome!!!",1422057600,,408,4.166666666666667
