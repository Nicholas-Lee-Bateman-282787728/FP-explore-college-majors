8118560,5,B000F7CEA2,"The finale of the Boys Be... saga, and mostly a pretty good send-off.
The first episode finds Yoshihiko wondering about why a girl would want to see a boy for ""no particular reason"", until he encounters a popular spokesmodel who seeks to do just that with a guy she likes.
The second episode is set at New Year's 2001 (the beginning of the millennium), and features Kyochi and Chiharu getting very different advice on whether they should be together at midnight. By now it's plain that it was Kyochi rather than Chiharu who had the worse maturity issues, and despite what the audience has actually seen, it ends with one of the most optimistic (and touching) lines I've ever heard, especially given the episode's title (""The Thousand-Year Vow"")
The third episode finds Kyochi taking a trip to do some sketching, and encountering a ""free-spirit"" ALSO named Chiharu. It turns out that Chiharu #2 was ALSO involved in a relationship with an artist. (OK, they DO turn on the coincidence, but since Kyochi is a bit thick sometimes, he might need lots of parallels to get the message.) Chiharu #2, by the way, is one of the most infectiously charming characters I've ever run into in anime, even if her jokes don't necessarily translate well.
Will Kyochi absorb the lessons he's learned and FINALLY be able to have a decent relationship with his OWN Chiharu? Some things we see, some things are left to the imagination by the ending. One might wish to see more, but true to the general spirit of the theme song, at least there's reason to believe that ""we'll be OK""",1198713600,,1559,4.693430656934306
8118561,5,B000F7CEA2,"This unusual series comes to an end, but not before our heroes get a chance to strut their stuff. The first episode pits our man Yoshihiko against a self absorbed pop princess, who left her work for what appears to be some self indulgent fun. But before its over, Jyunna Morio proves to be more than meets  the eye, our hero does a good deed, and gets some insight into his own relationship to boot.
Meanwhile, the millennium approaches and the various couples make their plans, while two other relationships struggle under the weight of separation and misunderstanding. When the moment comes, love for some is made more real, while for others, it only struggles even harder to survive.
Finally, in the last episode, Kyoichi gets an insight into relationships from another Chiharu, when a vacation turns into a life lesson. I will leave the final answer to the question on every fans mind unanswered, but rest assured that it is not simple, just like the rest of this series. Nothing  is simple or easy in this series, and that's its greatest strength. If you've followed the story this far, buy this dvd. I think you'll be glad you did.",1187913600,,1137,4.68
