2618489,5,B000GTDVLK,this is a wonderful movie for the family to enjoy - great story and it makes us care about animals and what happens to them!!! highly recommended!!!,1244592000,,148,4.518518518518518
2618490,5,B000GTDVLK,"I grew up watching the Wonderful World of Disney, but I don't remember ever seeing Yellowstone Cubs.  I got it because I love the old classic Disney movies with narrators like Rex Allen.  He did The Incredible Journey which is truly magical.  Besides ""Enchanted"" and ""Nanny McPhee"", I can't think of any movies made in the last 10 years that have that magical element that makes you delight and laugh- ""wonderful"" is exactly the right word.  Yellowstone Cubs is half the length of the Incredible Journey, but it too has a magical element to it.  Is it the story?  Is it the animals?  Is it the narrator?  It seems to be all of these.  I still feel young, but I can definitely say ""they don't make movies like this anymore.""",1236729600,2,723,4.5
2618491,5,B000GTDVLK,"Disney animal stories are the most fun to watch. They were able to showcase the personality of animals in such a unique way. This video features one of their television episodes from the ""Wonderful World of Disney"". The episode is ""Yellowstone Cubs"", a theatrical featurette from 1963 that was later shown on the ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" TV show for the first time in 1965. It was popular enough to be re-shown 3 more times over the next 10 years. The story unfolds in Yellowstone Park as the name implies, it is about the adventures of 2 bear cubs who got away from momma bear, while she frantically searches for them. This is an educational, exciting, and fun nature story. Disney studios had a way of filming real life activity in the wild and adapting it to an interesting storyline with narrative and music. Our whole family enjoys this one and recommend!

I highly recommend this video and others in the series. Disney released many other titles from the TV episodes, just search on Amazon under ""Wonderful World of Disney"". To learn more about other episodes in the television series buy the book ""The Wonderful World of Disney Television, by Bill Cotter"", also available at Amazon.",1208736000,2,1196,4.777777777777778
2618492,5,B000GTDVLK,"This is the fairly straighforward story of two bear cubs in Yellowstone National Park who get separated from their mother and all manner of peccadillos follow as the two ultimately find their way into the Old Faithful Inn kitchen!

Of course the mother gets in big trouble with the public and, with the park rangers who are forced to deal with her path of destruction, as she desperately seeks to find her lost offspring.

There's a lot of cute animal footage in here and the film is equally gratifying to both adults and children. It's my favorite Disney film of all time. The cinematography is spectacular and the narration is anything but hokey.

Watch this one with your kids.",1192492800,7,680,4.697478991596639
2618493,5,B000GTDVLK,"This DVD is great. It's perfect for the whole family. It takes place in Yellowstone Park in 1963 and boy were things different then they are now! People actually fed the bears! The ending with the cubs is a bit much, but my kids really laughed and enjoyed it. This show really brings us back to the wholesome TV from when we were kids.",1187308800,5,335,4.25

2618534,5,B000GTDVLK,"I absolutely loved this movie as a kid! Fond memories watching The Yellowstone Cubs! Still holds up in this day & age! Where wholesome family films are becoming rarer to find. A must see for the entire family! For all ages! Including us adults who still have the kid in us! You will really get a kick out of seeing the retro 60's era fashions in this film. For me, this fun movie brings with it, a Nostalgia of sorts for a simpler time. When all you needed were a big bowl of buttered popcorn, a coke, and family & friends gathered in front of the TV on Sunday nights.
Watching of course, The Wonderful World Of Disney! What a treat!",1424390400,,633,4.239669421487603

It can't be compared to any produced today, simply because people are more sophisticated now and the charm and simplicity of this movie would be lost in the comparison.

2618562,5,B000GTDVLK,Love this movie! We are very particular and selective of what our kids watch. This is one we don't mind at all. A blast to the past of when I used to visit Yellowstone as a kid and so pleasantly done. The kids love it!,1401148800,,218,3.8666666666666667
2618563,5,B000GTDVLK,Its the delightful and well done story of bear cubs in Yellowstone who deal with separation frim their mama bear in the wild and a lot of helarious tourist interactions. lots of insight into the Parks workings and lots of charming nostalgia!

2618565,5,B000GTDVLK,I am extremely happy to have this movie on DVD after have seen it in theater many years ago.  It is a very entertaining movie with an underlying theme that people must not feed wild life although they may think that it is the right thing to do.  Hand outs are not the right thing for anyone including the human race.  It is a fun movie to watch.,1398297600,,345,4.044117647058823

2618577,5,B000GTDVLK,"I have owned this one on VHS for many years.  I was thrilled when I found this and several others, on DVD.  How many of you recall the Disney nature stories?  Remember the Teenage Otter?  These wonderful live action animal stories were fascinating and fun additions to Disney's Wonderful World of Color.  What joyful memories I have of these pieces.  For that matter, what happened to family programming, at all?  Why does Disney channel show awful shows like ""Hannah Montana"" in lieu of reruns of the old Wonderful World of Color?  Remember, Disney programmers, kids become what they see.",1389744000,,589,4.878787878787879

2618580,5,B000GTDVLK,"Such an amazing movie! Yes, it's old and very dated. But where could you ever find such a heartwarming tale about bears? Mixing facts with humorous situations, this movie takes you on a journey through the summer--from a bear's point of view. The cubs are adorable, and just when you think you are going to have to cover your eyes--well, everything works out. This is a must-see, for adults as well as kids!",1386201600,,407,4.589041095890411

2618585,4,B000GTDVLK,"These movies are actually hilarious. Charlie, the lonesome cougar being the funniest. A nice trip back in Americana. They were extremely creative without all the special effects. I loved it when I was a kid. And a 59 I still loved them. My wife did too. It was amazing how Disney could weave a story with live animals. The narration is classic. Again, we just loved them.

2618586,5,B000GTDVLK,We loved this DVD. Wish that Disney would reissue ALL of their Wonderful World of Disney nature shows. Narrator Rex Allen evokes many childhood memories of gathering around the tv as a family to watch WWofD. Definitely inspires a visit to Yellowstone National Park! Also fun to see all the retro cars.,1360713600,5,301,4.8076923076923075

2618590,4,B000GTDVLK,I used to love watching Disney's Nature series and Rex Allen's narration brought back memories.  I forgot how close bears and people were able to come in contact at National Parks in the past.  NO fear!?  Great program to watch on instant streaming so that I could watch it right away without going out to purchase the DVD.  Great price too.,1353715200,,341,4.540983606557377
2618591,5,B000GTDVLK,I remember this as a kid shown in an elemnetary school assembly 40+ yrs ago. Great Disney entertainment then and now. My son loves this video and never tires of it. Some of the scenes make you wonder about the sensibility of people back in the day but you take it for what it is; almost looks a little staged. If not; don't do this on a trip to Yellowstone! Highly recomended! Good wholesome entertainment for a change.,1347753600,,419,4.384615384615385

2618594,5,B000GTDVLK,"I watched ""Yellowstone Cubs"" several times when I was younger, as it was presented on numerous occasions on the Sunday night ""Wonderful World of Disney"" show. A recent trip to Yellowstone prompted me to search for this title.  It was as much fun as I remembered it! Not only does it show the bear cubs in action, but it shows plenty of scenes of Yellowstone itself.  Unlike most Disney nature documentaries, this one includes people as well.

My only criticism is that it would be better if this DVD included more than one 50-minute program.  With so many to choose from, it would have been no problem for the Disney folks to find another Disney hour to add to this.  There are also no bonus features of any kind.  For the price, it would be better to get two for the price of one.

Amazon delivery was quick as lightning as usual, and I was enjoying this program within less than a week of ordering.

A fun program!  Cheers to Disney for releasing it on DVD...boos for not releasing more stuff with it.",1316304000,,1003,4.437158469945355

2618608,2,B000GTDVLK,"Meant to be cute, and Black Bear cubs are certainly cute, this film is a reflection of the attitudes of tourists who visited Yellowstone in that 1950s era that had no real understanding of wildlife.  Unfortunately the film did nothing to educate, even falsely protraying park rangers as accomplices.  It mentions in passing that Park rules are that there is to be no feeding of bears, but then shows that everyone does it.  It shows that getting attacked by a bear is just a matter of being knocked over.  I shows that a problem bear is one who is fed, then wants more - from a human that was the problem.

The story unfolds in Yellowstone Park as the name implies, it is about the adventures of 2 bear cubs who got away from momma bear, while she frantically searches for them. This is an educational, exciting, and fun nature story. Disney studios had a way of filming real life activity in the wild and adapting it to an interesting storyline with great narrative and music. Our whole family enjoys this one and recommend! There are 2 versions of this sold here on DVD, so check both to get the best price.

I highly recommend this video and others in the series. Disney released many other titles from the TV episodes, just search on Amazon under ""Wonderful World of Disney"". To learn more about other episodes in the television series buy the book ""The Wonderful World of Disney Television, by Bill Cotter"", also available at Amazon.",1259539200,33,1369,4.704166666666667

8134611,5,B000GTDVLK,"I LOVE this movie! It's so cute and simple.
You get to enjoy the beautiful scenery of Yellowstone while following two curious cubs around the park as they search for their mother. Rex Allen narrates the story in his subtle and humorous way that makes the funny animal antics even funnier!
My younger siblings ages 3-11 love this movie too, especially the part when the bears drive a motor boat around the lake!
I'd compare this movie to The Incredible Journey (1963) in that it's mostly narration with only a few human characters. (though I personally think this movie is a LOT more entertaining than that one.)",1496361600,,611,4.719626168224299
