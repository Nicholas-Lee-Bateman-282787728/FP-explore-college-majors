7924481,2,B00004W3GD,"I don't see the point of this video.  It is essentially a showcase for Hilary's dancing which is technically excellent and undoubtedly authentic but somewhat uninspiring.
It says on the case it can be used as an advanced instruction video but no movement instruction is included.  The explanations of the various rhythms are so brief as to be worthless and I have similar feelings about the finger cymbal instruction - why is a section on such basic finger cymbals included in an advanced video anyway?
Advanced learners who find improvisation difficult are unlikely to draw inspiration from this video which I found frankly tedious and definitely overpriced.",977616000,18,659,5.149532710280374
7924482,3,B00004W3GD,"Filmed with live Egyptian music - Haggag Metqal on tabla, Essam ElMatrawi  on douf and AlGamal ElSaghir on keyboards. You can use this as an advanced  instruction video or simply as a performance video to sit back and enjoy.  Hilary goes through four rhythms - Whada Kebira, Maqsoum, Saaidi and  Fellahi, first with the drums alone and then set to music. Also featured  are the song Nasa and the Baladi with taqasim and drum solo. There is also  some beginners finger cymbal instruction.",968976000,2,487,4.807228915662651
