8094720,5,B000BZ8IBW,"I bought this for my kids, ages 3 and 6.  My six-year old just loves it. She can't get enough of Dragon Booster.  A little too advanced for my 3-year old. This is a very creative animated series, with traditional bad guy / good guy roles played out in a mystical world of dragon racers with lots of great animated action sequences. Adults will also enjoy watching with their kids. Looking forward to the next installment.",1162857600,2,421,4.526315789473684
8094721,5,B000BZ8IBW,"This DVD contains episodes #1-4 of the first season of Dragon Booster: The Choosing Parts 1 and 2, Into the Fire, and Opposing Force.  This will give you a good introduction to a really fun sci fi series.

  My family first learned about Dragon Booster from the toys given out by McDonalds sometime last year, but it is not a series written just for kids.  I tracked down the show simply because I liked the toy dragons but now we watch it every chance we get.  We are now happily watching the third season shown on ToonDisney in the US.  We have seen every episode from season 1 (#1-15) and 2 (#16-26).

  There are many reasons why we like this series.  Many of our reasons have been explained by the other customer reviews, particularly the one that called the animation ""astonishing!""  I fully agree.  We like the fast pace, fun story lines, and dragon characters.  Unlike the Amazon editorial reviewer, I personally really like the mix of cartoon animation and anime and I love the way the series refers to other great sci fi archetypes in the shows.  Others might think that this makes Dragon Booster a bit of a copycat; to me it makes Dragon Booster feel like an old friend that I love and care for.  Also, the writers have developed a great sense of humor so that Dragon Booster doesn't take itself too seriously.  This allows us to enjoy the references to the sci fi greats and have fun with the shows, as the characters have fun with each other.

  Another reason I like this series is that it is appropriate for everyone in the audience.  The action-packed story lines are rich enough for adults but enjoyable for our children too.  The main themes are friendship, loyalty, honesty, believing in yourself, humility, teamwork, and that positive qualities are found in almost everyone (Only mega-bad guy Word Paynn in this show seems fully unredeemable).  Also, another admirable theme that shows up from time to time is helping others who need help, even if they are your sworn enemy.  For example, in the episode #17 ""Faster than Fear"" Artha and Lance help Moordryd and Cain (not on this disk), and in another episode (I forget which one) bad guy Moordryd helps good guy Lance when they get stuck together.

  The main character, Artha/the Dragon Booster, is quite likeable.  He is a believable teenage boy who struggles with doing what he wants and being a responsible hero, brother, and friend.  He is a role model that kids will connect with and learn from as Artha chooses to make the right decisions, not selfish ones.  This heartening message is never nauseating though.  The writers successfully blend the lesson with action, conflict and humor and keep it cool enough for both adults and kids.

  I hope that you enjoy Dragon Booster as much as we do!",1158105600,9,2770,4.654958677685951
8094722,5,B000BZ8IBW,"My son ABSOLUTELY loves this show and i wanted to see what he found so enthralling...the show is awesome.  I love the characters, the action - by the way this action is so good it can go head to head with the Matrix, like one part where he dives to catch kitt and so many other parts.  it grows on you.  i really can't see how anyone would not give this a good review! :)",1155686400,5,371,3.92
8094723,5,B000BZ8IBW,"The Amazon editorial review really does this show a disservice. The animation is a little different, but it's hardly poor quality. I've always found the animation to be fluid and enjoyable, far more enjoyable than some of the current fare on the major cartoon channels. I've never seen these ""brightly colored patterns"" the editorial mentions, and no one should have a problem following the action on the screen.

The narrative doesn't flounder; on the contrary, I've been sucked into the story of the two main characters, Artha and Moordryd, more than any other Western cartoon. The characters are a little simple, but it's a cartoon. It's not trying to be Shakespeare, it's just trying to deliver an entertaining story, and it succeeds at that. It's already won a Gemini award for Best Animated Program or Series. Perhaps because of its obvious anime influences it's suffered from a backlash from people who don't like the two styles mingling, but this is really an excellent little cartoon that doesn't get its well-earned respect.",1149206400,4,1034,5.046783625730995
8094724,5,B000BZ8IBW,"I just recently saw the an episode of this show. And, I was hooked. I loved the story, the charecters, the Dragons, the animation. This whole show is amazing. This show is great for anybody who is a fan of Dragons. I really wished there was a way to experiance the rush of competeing in a Dragon City Race. This show is filled with high fast action, great comedy, and some of the collest Dragons you will have ever see. There is going to be a second DVD coming out soon. I they will release it already.",1143331200,2,502,4.185567010309279
8094725,5,B000BZ8IBW,"I first discovered this series on ABC Family quite a few months ago, and I have to say that this is one of the sleekest and best produced animated series to grace television sets in years!

""Dragon Booster"" is one of the finest Canadian animated imports ever unleashed. It boasts solid story-telling as well as fascinating character and story-line development.

I think it is a series that has transcended many age groups, not just kids.

Perhaps the most amazing thing about this series is the animation. In a word: ASTONISHING! It combines 2-d and 3-d cel drawing with CGI-assisted animation. The animation is so smooth in movement, vibrant in color, and vast in detail that it looks like something straight out of some of the best Disney animated feature films. It must be seen to be beleived!

I hope these DVDs will do well, and that Funimation will (volume by volume if necessary) will release all episodes of the series.

As far as ""Can-imation"" (Canadian animated series) goes, this series is so good it ranks up there with the likes of ReBoot, Beast Wars Transformers, and War Planets/Shadow Raiders.

O Canada!",1139097600,9,1120,4.837696335078534
