7738107,4,B01EKMKEW2,"I am enjoying the content, it's more good RD stuff and you will enjoy it if you liked the previous 10.

BUT I have an issue with the Blu-Ray. When ever a special effects shot comes on, like a pan of Red Dwarf or a ship flying through space, the video gets choppy. It will jump forward a few frames at a time. But when the actors are on screen like a normal shot it's fine. I am playing it on a PlayStation 3, and the same happens when playing back on my computer.

I paid extra for the Blu-Ray for the best quality possible, and this is not it.

Also for $35 you get the bare minimum in a Blu-Ray pack. Just a case and a disk. I know it's a limited audience and they have to make money producing a short run of disks. But it feels a little skimpy for 6 short episodes. Something extra in there would be nice, like a little booklet or sticker or something.",1478908800,8,855,3.9883040935672516
7738108,5,B01EKMKEW2,"Chris, Craig, Danny, and Robert; the guys still got it!  It's classic Red Dwarf comedy from the later years. Not much originality, as Series XI was like watching resurrected ideas and scenes of the past series, but I still found myself laughing out loud and enjoying each episode.  Series 11 has (only) six episodes and  Disc 2 has extras (cut scenes, interviews, the usual stuff.)  I missed the character Holly, being part of the initial crew from day 1.  I'm glad the guys are back and am anxiously awaiting Series XII in 2017.",1478822400,6,529,4.645161290322581
7738109,4,B01EKMKEW2,"Love Red Dwarf. Overall the show had good story lines and production values. ""Officer Rimmer"" and ""Can of Worms"" were my favorite. Unfortunately this package felt thrown together too quickly. There are no interactive menus as all other series sets have had and the behind the scenes documentary seemed too short. Would have loved to see audio commentary tracks also.",1478736000,10,366,5.116666666666666
7738110,5,B01EKMKEW2,"I have been a Red Dwarf fan since the early 90's watched every episode, special, outtake, anything I could get my hands on over and over and living in the US it wasn't always easy.  This is hands down the best series yet.  The production values alone are far and away better than anything that has come before.  Writing is great and the guys still have it.  If this had been an American cast Shirley one or more would have been dead or living in a gutter by now.",1478649600,,462,4.157303370786517
7738111,4,B01EKMKEW2,"The mining ship Red Dwarf, lost in deep space for three million years, is continuing its long voyage home. The four-man (well, one-man, one-hologram, one-android and one-bipedal-cat) crew continue to get into unusual scrapes as they seek to survive.

Red Dwarf began way back in 1988, making it easily the longest-running science fiction sitcom in history. Part of the show's success is its mixing of real SF ideas with funny gags and character development rooted in tragedy and pathos: Red Dwarf at its best is not afraid to make its audience feel sorry or even upset as it even makes them laugh.

Unfortunately, the more detailed characterisation and tragedy mostly left the show along with co-creator and writer Rob Grant after the sixth season. Since that time Red Dwarf has, under its other co-writer Doug Naylor, become a much more conventional sitcom with running gags, recurring characters and ideas and topical humour that may be outdated in a few years' time but raises a smile now.

This eleventh season airs four years after the tenth, itself a low-budget attempt to get the show back on the air via the UK cable channel Dave. That was very successful, hence a noticeable budget increase for this season with more visual effects, location filming and more elaborate sets. It's still a long way from the show at the height of its biggest success on the BBC at the end of the nineties (during the seventh and eighth seasons, when the humour risked taking a back seat to the spectacle), but it definitely frees the show up to open up the scale and employ some more highbrow and expensive ideas.

For the most part, it works. Without Grant or another more character-focused writer, the show is never going to be as good as it was back in its brilliant second through fifth seasons (and the only-marginally-weaker sixth), but we're also a long way from the more tedious episodes of the seventh through ninth seasons as well. Naylor seems to be writing within his limitations, knowing that what he's good at is channelling SF ideas for laughs. Some of these misfire - season opener Twentica hits a series of dud gags - but things rapidly improve from there. A vending droid is mistaken for a genius medical bot and is given the task of carrying out vital surgery, Kryten has a mid-life crisis and finds a way of communing with the universe, and - in easily the best episode of the entire series since Season 6 - Rimmer is promoted by a 3D-printed Space Corps officer and finally gets his dream job only for it to all go spectacularly wrong. There's also a couple of Cat-centric episodes which work pretty well.

Continuity is, as usual, treated as something optional, so there's no mention of the missing Kochanski or Holly, which will likely annoy some long-term fans, and the show is a little bit too eager to use simulants and GELFs again rather than creating some new concepts. But the cast is on fine form, even if their age is starting to tell, and even in its weaker moments the season remains firmly entertaining.

No, it's not the show at its best and some of its worst post-Grant indulgences do occasionally resurface, but the eleventh season of Red Dwarf (***) is overall fun and watchable. Season 12 has already been filmed, is currently in post-production and will air on Dave in mid-to-late 2017.",1477699200,20,3316,4.738301559792028

7738142,4,B01EKMKEW2,"Red Dwarf is my all time favorite show. It doesnt take itself too seriously and occasionally touches on some truely funny stuff.

That being said the bluray of Season 11 US release is 1080i video along with 2.0 audio. Its such a bizarre thing it should say that somewhere on this page.

What happened to 1080p and 5.1 of season 10? I know the production company changed but interlaced video is going too far. Who knows what kind of scaling issues will happen in the future. Id have paid a few more bucks for 1080p, for just the consistancy.",1496448000,3,540,4.444444444444445

It doesn't take itself seriously like Dr. Who, because Red Dwarf is actually creative intelligent comedy.  If you don't know the Red Dwarf series and are smart, start at the beginning so it makes sense. It is like intimate theater.

7738168,5,B01EKMKEW2,"We smegheads were all excited when the cast of Red Dwarf reunited to film season 10 but let's face it: while the humor was still there, the production values of that new season were rather lacking. This blu-ray released of season 11 shows that this problem has been fixed. This season offers plenty of special effects, sets and costumes that make Red Dwarf look as good as it ever did.

The first three episodes - ""Twentica"", ""Samsara"" and ""Give and Take"" - are excellent, with ""Samsara"" being a particular highlight for not just its humor, but for its unique story structure and its morality bending sci-fi premise. ""Officer Rimmer"" falls a bit flat, rehashing the worn concept of any small success going to Rimmer's head and ends on a rather sudden note. ""Krysis"" is like something written by Douglas Adams, examining Kryten's midlife crisis while the crew has a face to face meeting with The Universe. Finally, ""Can of Worms"" marks the return of a Big Bad that's well known to fans of the series, though the episode itself is a bit on the weaker side. Still, even lukewarn Red Dwarf is far better than most sitcoms on the air nowadays. All in all, this release is a must-have for Red Dwarf fans, even if (like me) you were less than thrilled with the recent releases of Back to Earth and Season 10.",1484611200,4,1301,4.583690987124464

Red Dwarf XI is basically an extension to series X with the stories wrapped around the four (and only) main characters. The stories are good for the most part with ""Krysis""  being the funniest to me. There are a lot of good gags in all the episodes which give me a good laugh and some interesting storylines but also some stuff that has been done before.(Officer Rimmer, Polymorph on Can of Worms) The special effects keep getting better but I guess after almost thirty years it would.  In my opinion, they need to bring some sort a version of Holly back to keep the other four in check. Especially, when Holly was essential for Red Dwarf existing for 3 million years.

Doug Naylor and Chris/Craig/Danny/Robert did not miss a beat regardless of the years that have passed since the last series. I really wish there was commentary on the blu-ray, but the other special features are great. I always love the smeg ups and all the beautiful model shots.

7738209,3,B01EKMKEW2,"Okay, so recently I bought for about $35 dollars the one-disc US set of Red Dwarf XI. I don't have to re-explain that I'm a huge fan....

But I gotta tell you, I'm a little disappointed.

The second series in a row NOT to have a commentary track with the cast, the asking price of 35 bucks seems just too high-priced to start. Furthermore, the shows just aren't...well...that funny. It sort of reminds me of another show I'm a collector of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Bang-Theory/dp/B00HETF2TY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Bang Theory</a>"", where after Season 7, I tend not to rewatch the later Blu-Ray releases as much because they don't have what earlier seasons had in overall comedy appeal.

Granted, the NTSC slowdown issue from Series X has been resolved and you have the smeg-ups, and a full length documentary of the season to go with (along with a couple of promos you'll never watch again), but to me it boils down to the shows themselves which makes it worthy of a purchase or not. Not that it's a complete disaster, episodes like ""Officer Rimmer"" hold well, just overall not as funny as even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Series-X/dp/B009Z5BPYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Series X</a>. The sets, video/audio, and even the guys look great (didn't really need to know that Rimmer now wears a hair-piece, leave something for the imagination!), but this six episode series didn't grab me like the others. It is possible since everyone is getting up in years, and that because they're shooting Series XI and XII back-to-back with no two or three year wait, that they left the better scripts for XII. I at least hope that could be the plan....

Anyway, definitely NOT the place to start for newbies to Dwarf (Series VI will always be my favorite), but not a complete loss. Just sorta strange how I laughed maybe only twice in 6 shows. Smeg.",1480032000,,1948,5.274193548387097

7738212,1,B01EKMKEW2,"Let's go back to Red Dwarf Season X - it was 1080p on Blu-ray (converted from UK 50i to 24p for North American playback). Red Dwarf XI was likely shot 25p - it was shot on Arri cameras - but instead of a 24p conversion like X, this time they chose a 60i conversion. This interlacing conversion for the US is bad for playback because it has to invent frames, and introduces judder. BBC did the same thing with Outcasts Blu-ray. Don't buy this. If you bought it, return it as defective. BBC needs to know that fans aren't happy about the way they're putting out shows on Blu-ray. Blu-ray is supposed to be the highest quality format. That's not the case here - the show has been mangled by interlacing it. The best option is to import from the UK, if your Blu-ray player, television and/or computer is capable of 50i playback. I'll try to keep this review updated as I learn more about all the technical issues.",1479340800,11,909,4.384615384615385
