4573493,3,B0055CP9HW,"There is something for every taste in this collection- groovy bi-sexual vampires, Italian style Hammer, a mummy alien and Linda Blair.  None of them really a classic but if you like psychotronic cinema you will enjoy it.",1329609600,,220,4.945945945945946
4573494,5,B0055CP9HW,"Shout! has pulled off a good set of movies grouped as a foursome. Shout! has been releasing classic low budget drive-in classics on DVD. The main reason I got this was the great looking Stephanie Rothman classic from 1971 Velvet Vampire. I am a big fan of Stephanie Rothman early '70s flicks. Code Red has released several of her films. Thanks to Shout! for releasing a great anamorphic widescreen print of Velvet Vampire.
Lady Frankenstein is a bad horror movie from 1970 that has never been treated good on home video. Shout! has released two versions of the film. The original at 83 minutes and an extended cut that runs 95 minutes. The extra scenes are noticed by a slight pause in the print, but its not too annoying. Both versions are presented in anamorphic widescreen and look really good for this low budget movie (compared to the Alpha video release).
The last two films are from the '80s and Time Walker isn't too bad. It is laughable in some scenes. But this anamorphic widescreen print is the best looking of this set. Grotesque is piller boxed at 1.33 aspect ratio, while the other three are 1.78/1.85.
Not much in way of special features on this two disc set, except commentary from the star of Velvet Vampire. There are trailers, poster galleries, tv spots and that is about it. These classics stand on their own where special features aren't needed.
Just glad to see the under appreciated Lady Frankenstein finally get a decent home video release. Velvet Vampire has had a decent DVD out, but this print is much better.
You can definately tell these cheap movies are Roger Corman fun!",1328918400,30,1601,4.701067615658363
4573495,3,B0055CP9HW,"I have to say I'd seen Velvet Vampire before & I was having trouble remaining conscious, the same thing happened when trying to watch it again, so I would have to say it's pretty boring.  I could not get into Lady Frankenstein at all.  But, on the other hand, Grotesque is somewhat enjoyable 80's trash with Linda Blair in full 80's bad fashions and a bunch of overacting punks staging a home invasion, only to find that their choice of a home to invade was rather poor.  And Timewalker, which I'd never seen before, was also fairly enjoyable, in an odd kind of way, as a mummy that is actually an alien is inadvertently brought back to life and glides around looking for some missing crystals that will help it get back to its home...but this one ends on a rather strange note, indicating that there was to be a sequel?

If you can find this cheap, grab it, but it was not nearly as exciting as it originally appeared to be when I saw it was coming several months ago.",1320796800,2,969,4.337016574585635
4573496,2,B0055CP9HW,"There's a reason Shout Factory issued these as a 4-for-1 set...they're pretty darn awful.  But if T & A, 70s/80s exploitation elements, bad makeup/effects and some atrocious acting are your things--this set is for you.

The Velvet Vampire--a fairly cool desert setting and copious amounts of nudity (both female and male) elevate this somewhat.  It's still not very good, and the blonde (Sherry Miles) is stupendously annoying.

Lady Frankenstein--the worst film in the set, and that's saying a lot.  There are two versions available here--the U.S. theatrical version and the ""international cut,"" which is approximately 15 minutes longer.  The 'cut' scenes have been restored in such an awkward, haphazard manner that I found myself wishing I'd skipped it and watched the edited version instead.  The re-inserted scenes are noticeably fuzzier, and there's an international tv logo in the upper left side of the frame during these scenes, which I assume means they were copied from a foreign television presentation and re-edited back into the film with a hacksaw.  Joseph Cotton, scraping the absolute bottom of the barrel, is featured.  Awful, by any standards (and dubbed too--I believe this was made in Italy).  So bad it's....just bad.

Grotesque--Linda Blair (who I actually like, she was such a trooper) in full 80s regalia...a couple of linebackers could fit into those shoulder pads.  This has a home invasion theme, and is quite violent, though the ""grotesque"" finally makes an appearance to even the score.  I won't spoil who, or what, the 'grotesque' is--but rest assured it's one of the worst makeup jobs I've ever seen.  Also stars Tab Hunter, which might alert you to what's in store here.  This film has not been given a new transfer and is presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio (all of the other films in this set have new anamorphic transfers).  So there's that, too..

Time Walker--I actually kinda sorta liked this one.  It sports some cool visuals, a fairly interesting script,  and also a decent performance from Ben Murphy.  The mummy/alien concept got my attention and held it, though be assured this is still a 'B' movie at best.  However, it is in my opinion the most polished and interesting film in this rogue's gallery.

Shout Factory once again outdoes itself with the presentation of three of these films...they look great, allowing the cheese to shine through like never before on home video.  Proceed, however, at your own risk...you have been warned!",1319760000,13,2477,5.04679802955665
4573517,5,B0055CP9HW,"I bought this DVD collection for the films Lady Frankenstein and Time Walker.  I had no interest in the other two flicks, though I had once seen The Velvet Vampire.  I did not like it, but that is my non-preference.  Lady Frankenstein is an early 70's Euro-horror flick about the off-center scientist's daughter who does her dad one better by creating a creature that can satisfy her cravings.  Fill in the blanks yourself.  At 96 minutes it is the most complete version I have seen yet and the quality is very good.  Time Walker is an early 80's horror/sci-fi about a mummy found in King Tut's tomb that is sent to an American university.  (Yeah, like the Egyptian authorities will just hand over any important find that easily.)  It is inadvertently revived, skulks about at night collecting some crystals that were stolen from it's sarcophagus and generally terrorizing the campus.  It seems our mummy is really a stranded E.T. that needs it's baubles to phone home.  Very good, silly popcorn flick with some suspenseful moments and the quality is also very good.  I can highly recommend this collection for these two movies.",1412380800,,1128,4.822916666666667
4573518,4,B0055CP9HW,Cool.  Love all of these except for Grotesque.  I really dislike that one because some of the characters are just too skanky to bear.,1411430400,,133,4.5

4573520,3,B0055CP9HW,"I could not believe how bad ""The Velvet Vampire"" is. Very weak and boring film. Buy this dvd for ""Lady Frankenstein"" with Rosalba Neri (3.5 stars).

4573521,3,B0055CP9HW,"Of the 4 films, Velvet Vampire is the best.  None is among Corman's best.  I wouldn't go out of my way to buy this.",1374364800,,115,3.75

4573525,4,B0055CP9HW,"Shout Factory has released a 2 disc package of US/Euro Horrors in which 2 have been available through discount companies and 2 released for the first time in DVD format.  Director Stephanie Rothman's 'THE VELVET VAMPIRE'-1971 I have already reviewed a year ago in its Cheezy Flicks release although the transfer included here is a big improvement with brilliant colors and a gorgeous 1.85 transfer making it the definitive release for this underrated vampire film. It includes a wonderful audio commentary with actress Celeste Yarnall who has a great memory of the shoot as a special feature and an original theatrical trailer. Disc Two has Director Joe Tornatore's 'GROTESQUE'-1988 and Director Tom Kennedy's 'TIME WALKER'-1982 both of which were staples of Cable television and budget VHS bins in the early nineties. 'TIME WALKER' is an enjoyable mummy movie blending Horror and Sci-Fi the likes of which low budget filmmakers of the fifties used to crank out in their sleep.  With a great cameo from cult favorite Antoinette Bower, its a fast moving time waster.  'GROTESQUE' is a nasty blend of slasher and deformed monster antics cameoed with actors Guy Stockwell and Tab Hunter and peppered with an above average Linda Blair performance.  The film has kudos for being lensed on you-are-there locations giving it a reality TV-like atmosphere throughout and also mixes the neo-punk 'MAD MAX' look to the villains in the piece. Both films include their original trailers and 'TIME WALKER' also has an interview with Kevin Brophy and Producer Dimitri Villard. The highlight of the smorgasbord is the definitive transfer of Director Mel Welles's Euro Cult classic 'LADY FRANKENSTEIN'-1972 which shows off the beauty and talents of Rosalba Neri billed here as Sara Bey.  If you have seen my other Euro reviews, Rosalba is one of my favorite actresses and nowhere does she shine more than in this film.  Boasting performances good and bad by venerable Joseph Cotten, Mickey Hargitay, and Paul Muller who graced many Euro Westerns and Horror films, it emerges as Euro Trash of the first order with Rosalba dominating the screen clothed and unclothed in every scene she's in.  Included here is an extended version with inserted scenes apparently trimmed from the US version and seems to be transfered from 2 sources: a television broadcast with a prominent 3 SAT logo in the upper left hand corner which interupts the flow of the film with jerky movements when they appear and also culled from a washed out transfer from a German broadcast where the footage has German subtitles but is in English. The extra footage comprises of scenes which enhance? the story line and makes the film flow a bit better but the extended version is no great shakes for added Horror scenes or fans expecting more nudity. The conclusion, however, still ends with an abrupt THE END title appearing within the climactic mayhem. The 1.85 transfer is utilized throughout and the jerkiness may be distracting for first time viewers but for this fan it was a revelation so throw out your budget releases from other companies. For bad cinema purists, 'LADY FRANKENSTEIN ' is a jewel. Shout Factory continues to release superior transfers of Corman's Concorde and New World features and they are a must for all Horror fans and future low budget filmmakers.",1339977600,12,3325,5.023593466424682
4573526,4,B0055CP9HW,"What a grab bag of drive-in cinema we have here.  GROTESQUE and TIME WALKER are pretty bad.  GROTESQUE has Linda Blair and a familiar blonde from JAWS 2 but the story is pretty disjointed and I got the feeling that the film got made because it was written around the collection of rubber monster masks somebody owned.  TIME WALKER...I've to be honest, I haven't made it all the way through that one yet.  If it gets better, I'll be shocked (and will amend this review).

LADY FRANKENSTEIN is fun because it clearly follows the Corman philosophy: blood and nudity sell the picture.  It's a little jarring to see a monster movie with naked chicks in it, but Corman knew what he was doing.  The funnest part?  Watching the completely over-the-top trailer for LADY FRANKENSTEIN first, noting all the leering hints that Lady Frankenstein is creating a monster (in every sense of the word) for her own fiendish and perverted pleasures...then watch the movie.  Technically, the trailer is correct in what its delivering.  But just not the ghoulish orgy hinted at in the trailer.  (Plus, I've always loved that 70's schlock narrator featured in the trailer.  I think John Landis used him as well for KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE).

But the real reason to get this collection is for THE VELVET VAMPIRE.  Produced by Corman and probably on a very thin budget, THE VELVET VAMPIRE actually ascends to the level of an art film.  If I sound surprised, it's because I am: you usually didn't think ""art film"" and Roger Corman in the same sentence.  Directed by Stephanie Rothman, this may be, I believe, the first genuinely erotic vampire tale.  Many would came later, from Hammer's THE VAMPIRE LOVERS and COUNTESS DRACULA to the bloody orgy of 1975's VAMPYRES, but I think THE VELVET VAMPIRE is the first vampire film that brazenly uses seduction and nudity in the storyline.

Celeste Yarnall, the 60's babe who also appeared on the original ""Star Trek"" and with Elvis (he sings ""A Little Less Conversation"" to her in LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE), provides a commentary that sheds light on the film's production and insight into the Corman moving-making machine.

I have another DVD of THE VELVET VAMPIRE but I think this is the only one with Celeste's commentary on it.  That is reason enough to get this collection.",1335225600,13,2295,4.776649746192893

8457957,5,B0055CP9HW,"Nice collections of films from Shout! Factory, so I'll review one, GROTESQUE, just to whet your appetite:

This horror film's major distinction is that all of its' sympathetic characters are killed off before it is half over! Linda Blair (enough said) brings along her best friend (Donna Wilkes of ANGEL [1983] and BLOOD SONG [1982]) to visit her movie makeup effects expert father (Guy Stockwell of SANTA SANGRE [1989]) and mother at their house deep in the woods. Along the way they have a chance encounter with a gang of murderous punkers. Blair and Wilkes escape but their problems are far from over. The leader of the gang (Brad Wilson) catches wind that Blair's father keeps a secret stash in his house. Thinking it to be money or drugs (?)  they break into the house and slaughter Wilkes, Blair and her family. While searching for the stash, the punks stumble onto a hidden room containing a deformed man called Patrick. Realizing that Patrick is the hidden stash, the punks flee. Patrick, seeing what was done to Stockwell and Blair, gives chase and kills the punks (including Nells Van Patten and Robert ""MANIAC COP"" [1988] Z'dar) one by one until only Wilson and his girlfriend are left. Blair's uncle (former teen idol Tab Hunter), a plastic surgeon, joins a police posse to find the killers of his family. The posse finds Patrick struggling with Wilson and his girlfriend and kill Patrick (a shotgun blast to the face), thinking that he is the killer. The two remaining punks say that Patrick was the killer and the police release them for lack of evidence. This pisses off Hunter quite a bit since he knows that Patrick couldn't be the killer. He kidnaps the two punks and exacts equal justice while revealing the truth about Patrick and himself. This is not an easy film to criticize. It's hard to tell if the humor is intentional or not. Van Patten's role as a laughing psychopath is one such case. Is it a parody or is he really trying to act? (I often think the same thing whenever I see his dad, Dick, perform.) There is no nudity (although Blair does threaten to take a shower) but there is enough blood and perversity to keep you occupied in its' short 80 minute running time. Director Joe Tornatore (ZEBRA FORCE [1976]) and scriptwriter Mikel Angel (who co-directed THE LOVE BUTCHER [1975]) also appear in minor roles. George ""Buck"" Flower was Pre-Production Coordinator. There are reviews out there that state that there's an alternate ending where the whole movie is nothing but a film-within-a-film where the Wolfman and Frankenstein watch the proceedings in a theater projection booth complaining about how no good horror movies are being made today. They jump out of the booth and scare the hell out of the audience (Blair included). I tend to believe it for two reasons: 1.) The version I viewed on VHS ends rather abruptly with happy music playing in the background and, 2.) there are listings for actors playing the Wolfman and Frank N. Stein in the final credits even though they are nowhere to be found here. GROTESQUE is either a good bad film or a bad good film. That decision is up to you. Available on DVD (with the missing footage intact) from Shout! Factory as part of their Roger Corman's Cult Classics ""Vampires, Mummies & Monsters"" 2-Disc collection (which also includes LADY FRANKENSTEIN [1971], THE VELVET VAMPIRE [1971] and TIME WALKER [1982]).
