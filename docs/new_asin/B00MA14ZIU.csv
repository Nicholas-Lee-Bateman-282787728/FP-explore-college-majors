The short version: It's bare bones, but does the job. Audio and video are both solid considering the age of the material. Buy it if you are a fan or have interest. Scroll to the bottom for quality, bitrate, and disc specs.

The long version:
Most likely if you are buying or looking at this, you already know about RevCo and the original VHS release, or you have seen it.
This is basically RevCo live in Chicago, 1987. The audio is not really live (read Al's biography and he mentions they re-recorded it), but that's nothing new; even the live CDs were the same way.

This is a bare bones DVD, with no extras, but considering the status of this recording having only been on VHS for almost the last 30 years (no, the laserdisc NEVER came out), who needs them. The only extras I could even think of that they could throw on here is maybe one of the members talking, and they have already done that in their biographies and elsewhere, plus I don't think they really care to re-visit it all.
It comes in a simple clam shell case, and the cover features the same artwork and font style of the original VHS. It's missing the credits that were on the back of the original, but not a big deal. The DVD menu retains the same font style as the VHS as well, and has a simple play all button along with a song / set-list menu.

Visually, I'm not sure what this was pulled from, but it was obviously some kind of tape source. I say obviously because the original medium was a combination of video, film and artwork, along with overlays for the song titles. It had to have been mixed on something. They didn't do a restoration, because the original film would have had to be transferred, and then they would have had to pull the other original materials (if they are even still available) from wherever, and re-create the text overlays from scratch again. Too much work for how little this will sell. Basically this is about as good as it will ever get. Even if the film could be re-transferred, they would probably market it as a different release anyway, and only have the one angle from it.

Quality wise, I noticed some noise and analog artifacts here and there from the source, but nothing distracting. Given how old this is, it's reasonable, especially when you compare the prices the VHS was going for prior to this. I will gladly deal with it than pay people for a beat up tape at over 5 times the price of what I paid for this. Even the capped versions you can download online are not perfect, as they are pulled from the same VHS tapes I just mentioned.
The disc size is 3.84GB, with the actual show portion being 3.77GB.
Video bitrate is roughly between the 6 to 8 mbps range, averaging at 7, with peaks at a bit above 9, and dropping no lower than 4 on the blank areas. Audio is a straight Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo at 448 kbps, and sounds solid.
Chapter wise, it looks like it has one for each song, the same as the song / set-list menu.

I haven't noticed any cuts, errors, or major issues during the one watch I did so far. I may update if I find any significant issues down the line.

Overall I say buy it.",1424908800,17,3174,4.297658862876254
