How hard is it to give us the whole game in chapter format broken down as  innings ? If you want to watch the 10th inning magic of the Met's comeback you must watch the whole DVD to get to the end. That said  game 6 is the high-water mark of Met fandom  As bad as this DVD is it is still  a must own for Met fans. This is also a must have
for Sox's fans so they can see it was not Billy Bucker but the whole  Red Sox team that should shoulder the blame for the for the most famous choke in sports history",1083888000,3,661,3.7050359712230216
7880125,4,6304962940,"I love the Mets and as Mets fan, I love this game. The only problem I have with it is that it is not the complete game only the innings that either team scored on.",996537600,9,163,3.6857142857142855
7880126,5,6304962940,"The real test for any baseball game condensed to video is, just how exciting is it?  Not just the final half-inning, of course, but the game itself, even along the slow stretches.  Thanks to the MLB ""Baseball's Greatest Games"" series (the precursor to ESPN Classic's daily baseball rebroadcasts), you can watch the best 90 minutes of any given classic game and move from high spot to high spot, generally without losing the rhythm of the whole 9, or in this case 10, innings.
When reviewing a video like this, it's the game that speaks for itself, and not the way the video itself is produced.  Game 6 of the '86 Series has everything going for it -- a thinner Roger Clemens striking out New York batter after New Yor batter, the first-inning parachutist, Lee Mazzilli delivering a clutch late-inning hit.  And that's before the bottom of the 10th inning, and you can fast-forward Steve Garvey's wooden line-readings in between.
For true Mets fans the must-have item is the Bob Murphy radio broadcast.  But for any listener, baseball fan or otherwise, the Vin Scully play-by-play provided here stands on its own and brings the entire game to life.
One unfortunate note, owing more to the realities of baseball than to any defect in this game, but Darryl Strawberry went hitless and was out of the game in the bottom of the 10th.  How nice it would have been to see him contribute here... fortunately you can still catch reruns of his monster home run into the night in Game 7, still airing on ESPN Classic...",994723200,11,1508,4.693181818181818
7880127,4,6304962940,"Here is the World Series game that the Sporting News picked as the 8th Greatest Moment in Baseball History.  The date is October 26, 1986, the place is Shea Stadium, where the New York Mets host the Boston Red Sox in Game 6.  Boston leads the series 3-2 and has its ace Roger Clemens on the mound.  But the story of this one comes down to the 10th inning, with the game tied 3-3, when Dave Henderson leads off with a homer run off Mets star reliever Rick Aguilera.  Wade Boggs hits a double and Marty Barrett knocks him in to give Boston a 5-3 lead.  In the bottom of the 10th, Boston reliever Calvin Schiraldi gets Wally Backman and Keith Hernandez on fly balls.  The Red Sox are now only one out away from winning their first World Championship since Babe Ruth pitched for them in 1918.  The Red Sox would even get to within one strike of winning the Series, but Fate has never been kind to the Red Sox since they incurred the Curse of the Bambino.
No World Series game ever had a more unbelievable ending than this classic game, which began with a guy parachuting onto the pitcher's mound and ended with the immortal ""E-3.""  But that was only the final nail in the coffin.  The Sox had left 14 men on base and made other mistakes at least as important as the infamous game ending error.  This is not so much a great game as it is an unforgettable inning.  I am sure this tape is very popular among citizens of the Big Apple and purchased only by sadistic types in Bean Town.  Not as memorable as Carlton Fisk's game ending homer in 1975, but close.",994204800,5,1551,4.273972602739726
