  As he could of told us briefly. What fights were involved that caused the death of the persons honored by this memorial. Like for example. The combats in Palestine, Malaysian Emergency, Suez, Mau Mau, Falklands etc etc. As these folks deserve better than this film.",1505606400,,534,4.438775510204081
