64725,5,0783234287,"A favorite of author Gore Vidal (see his book, ""Screening History"" for details), ""The Mummy"" remains one of the most  imaginatively creepy classics from the golden age of horror.  Karloff is  superb in what is perhaps his best role, and Zita Johann is more than  beautiful enough to justify Im-Ho-Tep's centuries long obsession with her.  The makeup by the great Jack Pierce has never been equalled, and the  atmosphere is simply chilling.  Far superior to any sequels or remakes.",927763200,,480,5.0
64726,5,0783234287,As with all the 1930's horror films this one is very atmospheric and even without the special effects of today Karloff in the dual role of Imhotep/Ardeth Bey is masterful. Zita Johann is also quite good as his many  times reincarnated love interest Helen Grosvenor. With reference to the  classic horror films of the 1930's  in my books this one is tied for the #1  spot with the 1931 Dracula. This movie far better showcases the talents of  Karloff than Frankenstein.,918864000,,468,4.728395061728395

64738,5,0783234287,"After his huge success in the Frankenstein 1931 film, for which he had only fourth billing, Boris Karloff returned a year later as a star with top billing in this Universal Studios film. Most critiques consider this film better than the acclaimed 1931 Frankenstein. In this film, we are able to see Karloff's real face, although it is marked up to indicate that he is some 3,700 years old. He stars as a mummy of an ancient priest who was buried while he was still alive as punishment. Archeologists find his body in 1921 together with a curse that people who open a box that accompanied the body will suffer, including death. Karloff comes back to life and one of the archeologists who was present at the resurrection goes mad.
It soon becomes clear that the priest was in love with the pharaohs daughter who died. He was caught trying to bring her back to life and was punished for the sacrilege by being buried alive. Now that he is alive again, he is searching for her or one of her descendants that have her soul. Over ten years pass without success. It is now 1932. The priest appears looking like a live human, although very wrinkled to hint that he is very old.
He discovers a beautiful woman one of whose parents was descendant way back thousands of years of Egyptians. The priest is sure that she has the princesss soul, and he wants her. He is correct. The priest has hypnotic power and can influence a persons will to do as he desires even over long distances. He does so with this woman. He causes her to come to him against her will, because she is in love with another man, and, under his influence, she agrees to join him.
The film is very good and suspenseful, and it is interesting to see how modern-day men try to save the woman from a powerful priest.",1507593600,,1771,4.418960244648318
64739,5,0783234287,"The original & the best, but that rather goes w/out saying...  You can just feel the ""damned by ancient law""s priest's longing for his princess.  A love story, but aren't all the great films about love?  Boris has such a presence & the actress who playes his modern day princess is incredibly perfect.

64743,5,0783234287,"Sad to see negative reviews of this gorgeous black & white film, which marks the first credited U.S. directorial effort by German cinematographer Karl Freund. The year before this 1932 movie, he was the cinematographer (and, reportedly, uncredited co-director) on Tod Brownng's Dracula. He was also cinematographer on Metropolis. The noirish use of shadow and light, and the incredible texture and detail of the cinematography set The Mummy apart. Well, and Karloff's presence as the title character.",1505520000,2,500,5.5064935064935066

64746,5,0783234287,"I'm a Boris Karloff fan. And I am here to tell you as the mummy BK does his utmost with what he's been given. Which is mostly to stand stock still or move stiffly and speak *sigh* in his marvelous, mellifluous voice. He speaks to Zita Johann as Helen Grosvenor / Princess Ahnk-es-en-amon, Arthur Byron as Sir Joseph Whemple, Sir J's son Frank Whemple played by David Manners (who has a lovely profile BTW), and Edward van Sloan as Dr. Muller. Ardath Bey / Imhotep's eyes bore into you from his intricately lined face, magnificently lit for maximum spooky effect. Your blood is adequately stirred as he intones of ""... memories of love ... and crime ... and death!.....""

Mummy Imhotep is discovered by British archaeologists. A curse is released by a young, eager lad duly warned by his superiors against the DANGER of such --- Way to go Bramwell Fletcher as Ralph Norton! And thank you too very much for such a memorable reaction to the curse you recklessly released!

Miss Helen Grosvenor has the blood of an Egyptian mother in her veins and has endured several torturous lifetimes. She is handily living one of them at the exact same moment the reactivated mummy aka Ardath Bey is once more searching for his mate. Ardath beckons. He meets Helen who was once Princess Ahnk-es-en-amon.  Now Frank Whemple must fight for his one true love - a love that occurred to Frank for Helen within a span of mere hours - against a love that has lasted longer than the temples of the gods. Battling Ardeth Bey / Imhotep, a man who has suffered more for Princess A / Helen than any other. A man who shares with her a history harking back 3,700 years to the Ancient Egypt of the pharaohs.

Well directed by Karl Freund, and tantalizingly dressed by the pre-code costume department concerning Helen Grosvenor / Princess Ahnk-es-en-amon, The Mummy is great fun and unwraps the way for so many other mummy movies to arise from their sarcophagi.",1502928000,,1929,4.648093841642229

64800,5,0783234287,"This is a movie I watched almost every Saturday night with my then best friend. This would be in the early 1950's. I think we started the sleepovers in 1952 or 1953 when we were 6 or 7 yrs. old.  We alternated houses for these sleepovers, but our routine was always the same.  We would make home fries (starting with raw potato) and grab beverages for the Saturday night horror flicks.  I don't know why but this one seemed to be the one of three that was every week and then the other 2 rotated through various horror films.  This one seemed to be the one we couldn't take our eyes off of and scared us silly.  So the sentimental element is definitely a big factor! I never forgot several of the scenes and talk about frightening, I discovered on this recent viewing I actually remembered some of the lines.  Now that is frightening!  I am a big fan of old movies, including many silent films.  I had watched this film a few times in the past couple of decades and I had frequently thought about buying, just never got around to it.  Upon renting it last week I still found it to be as good as my memories.  In being truthful the fear factor was considerably reduced, however the story and the cast were still just as engaging.  Over the years I have gained some knowledge of many actors and also some knowledge of where the film industry was at production wise etc.  This in my very lay person opinion is actually quite brillant.  If you enjoy old films including horror films I really recommend you try this one.  How can you go wrong with Boris.",1462924800,2,1549,4.351916376306621

The direction of Karl  Freud is superlative, creating the properly eerie mood through his great skill with the camera.  Freud actually surpasses James Whale's ""Frankenstein "" in terms of purely cinematic style.

64829,5,0783234287,"""Anck-es-en-Amon, my love has lasted longer than the temples of our gods. No man ever suffered as I did for you.""
Atmospheric, eerie, understated, forbidden love.  If you are looking for gore, special effects, and a roller-coaster ride of non-stop action, this movie is not for you.  Director Karl Freund (of the German Expressionist Period) delivers a slow-moving, tragic love story masterfully played by Boris Karloff as Imhotep, the revived 3700 mummy brought to life through the incantations from the scroll of the Book of Thoth.  I was mesmerized as a child watching this film on a rainy Saturday morning, and it still grips me today.  No other mummy movie can possibly compare to this classic.  Although I enjoyed the 1999 remake, the script writers could have worked with this.  The psychotic laughter at the very beginning, the unnerving stare of Imhotep, the reflection pool which recounts the story of forbidden love, the sentence of death and being buried alive are visions which will have you pondering the meaning of this film long after it ends. For horror film buffs, this is a must-have.",1445212800,2,1103,4.967391304347826

Well, for these viewers, I would recommend the sequels, which are chock-full of spooky, lumbering, killer mummy action! THE MUMMY is a showcase for Boris Karloff, whether in the moldy bandages or out, he's superb throughout! His Imhoptep is mysterious, sinister, and sympathetic. The infamous ""stare"" scene alone, is enough to establish his horror icon status forever! Karloff was / is the only such actor on the same level as Lon Chaney sr., and that's no small achievement! His eternal love for his lost soul-mate, for whom he paid the ultimate price, is riveting. Zita Johann is Helen Grosvenor, the seeming reincarnation of Imhoptep's only desire.

This is an early sound movie, and most of the actors for sound movies at that time were experienced stage actors who were accustomed to producing the exaggerated body movements and facial expressions required in live theater but which look silly and unnecessary in the close-ups made possible by the camera.  You will be amused by this especially in the early scene in which the three archaeologists discuss their recent find--the mummy of a man who was buried alive.  If you've never seen this movie, be prepared to have your flesh creep when the Mummy comes to life, terrifying the young archaeologist who, we later learn, goes insane and literally dies laughing.  That's the only actually ""frightening"" scene in the movie, but the story is very interesting and will hold your attention all the way to the end.",1437177600,5,973,4.9753086419753085

64847,3,0783234287,"Just recently, the only Mummy movies I knew were the Brendan Fraser films. Last week, TCM had a marathon of Christopher Lee Hammer horror films in honor of his death, and I watched the 1959 Mummy movie (Which I think is better than this original version) So, I decided to go back even further and watch the original. Boris Karloff looked great in his mummified makeup, but when he transformed into a human, that's when it loses its appeal. The great thing about the 1959 film is that the mummy is in fact a mummy the whole movie and couldn't be killed. That's what is intriguing to me. In this film, the mummy becomes human within 5 minutes.

During an archaeological expedition in 1921, Egyptian Priest, Imhotep is revived. For some random reason, it cuts to 10 years later and Imhotep is masquerading as a modern Egyptian named Ardath Bey.

This one quality is wise is right up there with the Hammer Mummy(1959). The Kharis series from Universal that followed this doesn't quite measure up to the original classic. They are fun in their own right, but this one is classic. The story has elements of romance, adventure, action, and suspense. I would not suggest this one for the entire family.

64903,5,0783234287,"Dreamy, gothic, moody, understated, succinct--all of those would be apt descriptions to apply to the original Boris Karloff feature, ""The Mummy"".

Karloff himself seems to embody the centuries old character of Imhotep/Ardath Bey--moving and walking as if his body really had been restricted by 3700 years of entombment. And I wonder if Boris ever considered the irony of how he had to endure several hours of being wrapped in bandages only to have his mummified persona only appear onscreen for a few brief minutes--quite unlike his mummified kin--Prince Kharis.

The cinematography for this film is also top notch. One can speculate how much of that had to do with the influence of veteran cameraman Karl Freund, who was known for his moving camera style--a style that many have said was stifled for Universal's ""Dracula.""

Speaking of ""Dracula"", many people have brought up parallels between that Universal feature and the Karloff mummy. I can see some similarities, but I can also see differences. Count Dracula to me, is the living embodiment of evil--viewing mankind as being totally beneath him, only serving the purpose of being victims to satisfy his unholy appetites.

Imhotep, on the other hand, is evil--but I think it's a different kind of evil. At the root of Imhotep's motivation is love--something you can't say for Lugosi's Dracula.

In any event, the first Mummy movie remains the best.

The story has been oft repeated since, relying on that old standby of Mummy meets girl, Mummy loses girl, Mummy finds a reasonable reincarnated facsimile of said girl, Mummy decides to kill girl so they can live forever more as resurrected something or other, faux people, Mummy-lite beings, sort of immortal.............  Yeah, it didn't make sense to me either and poor Zita Johann (playing Helen Grosvenor/Princess Ankh-es-enAmon) had other ideas.  ""I want to live!""  Apparently, Ardath Bey/Imhotep (Karloff) thought otherwise and hoped to sway her with some subtle enticement.  ""A moment of agony,"" is that too much to ask of a bride to be.

Those extreme close-ups of Karloff's face are riveting.  The stuff of nightmares.  This is how a good horror movie should be made.  Without peer, a definite classic.",1405900800,2,1060,4.9772727272727275

64919,5,0783234287,"The Blu-ray edition of the 1932 version of ""The Mummy"" features re-mastered, high-resolution video, and is probably the best way to currently watch this classic movie.

Following Universal Studios' very successful ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein,"" ""The Mummy"" brought together director Karl Freund, actor Boris Karloff, and makeup artist Jack Pierce to create a movie that was superior in many ways to its predecessors. Director Karl Freund mostly worked as a cinematographer, and had a career which stretched from silent films to ""I Love Lucy,"" where he created the sitcom camera configuration used today. Freund was a master of visuals, and with ""The Mummy"" creates an atmospheric masterpiece, with beautifully filmed scenes of ancient and modern (1932) Egypt.  Sets and costumes are top-notch.  You can almost feel the dust in the air.

Boris Karloff and Jack Pierce again team up to create a classic monster.  Karloff only appears briefly in full mummy makeup, but those moments are wonderful and quite effective.  It is as modern (1932) incarnation Ardath Bey, that Karloff and Pierce reach their peak.  Made up to look two thousand years old, Karloff combines evil and pathos as lovelorn monster, Ardath Bey.  Stage actress Zita Johann makes a beautiful counterpoint to Karloff, as the intended object of Bey's affection.

I'll be the first one to say that old movies aren't for everybody.  This movie is from the dawn of the sound era and has some ridiculous overacting by lesser players, and some stagey moments that slow the pace of the film.  However, if you are willing to let yourself be taken in by the dream-like aura of this movie, you will find that ""The Mummy"" well deserves its place in the Pantheon of classic horror movies.

I've owned ""The Mummy"" in most of its different media incarnations: VHS, DVD, iPad, and now Blu-ray,  This version has been remastered, and is clearly the best visually.  The sound quality is similar to that of the DVD.  One is stuck with the quality from the original sound track, which is from the early days of movie sound recording.  The Blu-ray has a number of features, most of which were also available on the DVD, as well as a number of commentaries.

If you are a fan of old movies, ""The Mummy"" is a worthwhile addition to your Blu-ray library.  If you already have the DVD, this Blu-ray will offer an improved picture and a few extra features and commentaries at a pretty reasonable price.  If you like well-composed, beautifully lit, artfully designed (and completely artificial) sets, this movie will deliver.  But if you aren't a fan of classic films from the early sound period, you will probably want to stay away.",1396051200,9,2670,4.917410714285714

64922,5,0783234287,"""When I first met Karloff, I felt this incredible wave of sadness. His eyes were like shattered mirrors. Whatever his pain was, it was very deep and very much a part of his soul. I never intruded and he was always a perfect gentleman."" Zita Johann on Boris Karloff.

Karl Freund was finally given the chance to direct. His The Mummy (1932) is saddled with a silly plot, but in Freund's hands, it comes across as pure grand-guignol poetry. It was made by most of the same team who worked on Dracula, and is, essentially, a reworking of that story by the same writer, John L. Balderstein. Crusty Edward Van Sloan (who played Van Helsing) and chiseled David Manners (Harker) virtually reprise their roles. Like Murders in the Rue Morgue, The Mummy opens with Dracula`s curious theme music: Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake.""

Freund creates an ominous, ambiguous, and static mood, which is refreshingly anti-commercial. Universal thought so as well. This was his first and last directorial assignment for them. Karloff's Imhotep exudes eroticism, even through 3,000 years of masterfully stretched flesh courtesy of makeup genius Jack Pierce, perfectly caught in the film's gorgeously lit black and white. The actor's performance is nuanced, menacing and simultaneously sympathetic. His yearning for the tenebrous, commanding Zita Johann is entirely convincing. Johann is Karloff's most perfect female lead. Despite the doomed setup, their chemistry elevates us past the hokum. Unfortunately, they only worked together once, but they do constitute one the silver screen's most original couples; a sort of Grimm's Valentine.  Several scenes, depicting the history of the lovers was excised and, unfortunately lost. Rather, we are saddled with too much of that suburban bore; David Manners. Universal, as per the norm, sadistically allows him to live and get the girl.",1395273600,2,1854,5.256756756756757

The Jack Pierce feature on make-up is fascinating, and the discussion of the parallels between the plot of Lugosi's Dracula and the plot of the Mummy are interesting. It was fun to hear about the working relationships between Karloff and others in the production. Prior to this, as an adolescent monster fan I had only seen the 9 minute Castle Films 8mm reel on a silent projector, which kinda skips over the storyline to get to the ""good"" parts, at least from a kid's point of view, so I never understood that this was a love story.  Wonderful 2 DVD set!",1390521600,,695,4.387596899224806
64930,5,0783234287,"Forget all those recent CGI-infested remakes of this story. The original, now more than 70 years old, remains the best version without any contest. Truly adult in every way, this classic offers a tale of obsessive love & desire across thousands of years, with sharp & witty script, fine acting, and gorgeous B&W photography that simply oozes mystery from vast depths of eternal darkness (to go a bit Lovecraftian).

What makes it so good?

First, it's a short & tidy film, not a moment wasted or drawn-out -- yet at the same time, it proceeds at a measured pace, allowing time for mood to build & build. It isn't trying for cheap shocks, but an overall sense of something immense & powerful from the edge of history, greater than any power modern man can muster. And indeed, when we reach the finale, the desperate efforts of our heroes are proven useless -- this is a matter for Gods to decide, not mere mortals.

Then there's the fluid direction & shadow-soaked cinematography. Director Karl Freund isn't afraid to hold crucial shots for maximum impact, using them with almost hypnotic intensity. Further, music is used minimally, with some of the best scenes absolutely without a single note. The image alone is all that's needed to convey the emotional content.

Finally, there's the casting, with the superb Boris Karloff using both an expressively understated acting style & precise body language to create a figure both monstrous & somehow sympathetic, one that's both physically desiccated & frail, yet possessed of immense supernatural power. The lingering shots of Karloff's face, gazing into the camera with quiet ferocity, are chilling.

He's matched by lead actress Zita Johann, who combines the ""I can take care of  myself"" sensibility of a modern young woman with the voluptuous sensuality of her buried soul from thousands of years before, when she was a priestess of Isis. And since this is a pre-Code picture, her Egyptian costume leaves very little to the imagination, without ever looking tacky. Johann knows how to wear it as if it's the most natural thing in the world.

Even the male romantic lead, always a bland & thankless role in such films, is enlivened here by a certain devil-may-care insouciance & sense of humor. And characters with just a single scene give their all, in particular the unfortunate young archeologist who unwisely opens the sacred scroll that sets the story in motion.

This is classic film-making at its best -- most highly recommended!",1390435200,4,2486,4.94484412470024

No one can compare to Boris Karloff in his portrayal of monsters, mobsters and The Mummy.  Karloff was blessed with a face that had many interesting angles and a pair of deep set eyes that were absolutely penetrating.
The story is set in 1932 Cairo, Egypt. Archeologists have unearthed the grave of Karloff's lost love who was Egyptian Royalty in ancient Egypt.  Karloff was her lover and after her death, attempted to exhume her body and revive her from the dead.
He is caught by the King's guard and is mummified alive and sent to his grave for centuries of time in the cold, dark underground
of the pyramids.
I don't want to give the plot of the story away.  Just know that the authenticity of Karloff's makeup as The Mummy is far and away the best makeup I have seen including the most recent Mummy movies made within the past ten years.
The run time of the film is just under 90 minutes so the film retains the viewers interest

Boris Karloff who was so effective as Frankenstein's monster again signs up for hours in the makeup chair and Jack Pierce's wizardry.

This spectacular Blu Ray version is currently available as part of the Universal Monsters Collection. It brings new appreciation for this childhood favorite. The opening scenes feature The Mummy (Karloff) slowly come to life. Watch his face wrapped in perfectly aged linen. You can see the dust and bits of fabric fall from the 3500 year old man. Karloff also plays the modern day recreation of Im-Ho-Tep (The Mummy) in the form of Egyptian archeologist Ardeth Bey. If anything, the make up with Bey is even more startling and is crystal clear in this transfer. The story has Bey searching for his reincarnated lover. He was originally entombed for desecrating her final resting place by trying to raise her back to life using some magic words on a forbidden document. She is found in the form of Helen played by stage actress Zita Johann.

My favorite sequence in the movie is when Bey and Helen look into a magical and misty pool of water that serves as kind of a way-back machine. We see the events that cost Im-Ho-Tep his life. David Manners (""Dracula"") plays a dashing archeologist who has the hots for Helen and Edward Van Sloan plays pretty much the same character he played in ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein."" That is, the wise old professor. Freund's use of lighting is very effective in this atmospheric thriller. Other than the opening scenes inside the tomb, the film is rarely frightening even by the standards of 1932.

There are no noticeable artifacts that I could detect.  The audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio Mono (2 channel) and is very clear.  I could hear no hissing, common with these older movies, especially those with minimal musical scoring.  Extras include a 30 min. documentary called ""Mummy Dearest"" and one about make up master Jack Pierce.  There are a couple commentary tracks, photos, trailers and 2 short docs about Universal and the Mummy legacy.",1364688000,2,2327,4.847715736040609

I watched this over the decades and dove into the background stories about the plot and the actors. Somehow I never got around to reviewing this movie as it is so popular that I could not believe it possible that it was missed. It is coming upon a century since it was made.

Now we think of this as part of a series of movies and it is sometimes offered as part of a series.

Based on the story by Nina Wilcox Putnam and Richard Schayer

During an excavation a mummy (who looks a lot like Boris Karloff) was found. Along with the mummy was a mysterious box that suggested it contained the scroll of Thoth. Ralph Norton (Bramwell Fletcher) was left alone with the box and told not to peek. What would you do? Yep he was just doing a tad of deciphering and mumbling to himself (a mumble even though we could not hear was a good as a recitation.) Some slitty mummy eyes open and you can guess the rest.

Ten years later with the mummy still missing, a team of archeologist down on their luck is addressed by a mysterious native Egyptian Ardath Bey (Boris in a spiffy Egyptian robe.) Ardath has a deal for them; the thinks he knows the whereabouts of Anck-es-en-Amon. Little do they know when they are addressing Ardath Bey that they are about to dig up the old flam of Im-Ho-Tep.

The rest of the movie has a lot to do with magic, spirit, and other esoteric concepts.

It is o.k. to kibitz.

64980,4,0783234287,"The Mummy (Karl Freund, 1932)

NOTE: this review may be considered to contain spoilers.

I consider the 1999 remake of this movie, starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, to be one of those guilty-pleasure movies that, if I stumble upon it while channel-surfing, I simply have to watch. It's silly and it's over-the-top and it's a great deal of fun. But--not having seen Karl Freund's 1932 original (until last night) since I was knee-high to a grasshopper--I had forgotten how surprisingly faithful it is.

Not completely, of course. You substitute Arnold Vosloo, looking more built than he has in any other film, for Boris Karloff and you've immediately changed the tone. Vosloo is a total romantic hero. You're supposed to be able to identify with and/or sympathize with him, no matter that he's calling down sandstorms and having large, disgusting bugs munch on the Great White Devils. (An added bit of amusement for me there is that Vosloo was born in a South Africa where apartheid was still very much active.) Karloff, on the other hand, is never the good guy here. He's nasty and shriveled and menacing, even when he pops up looking less mummy-like in his Ardath Bey persona. Yes, he's erudite--Karloff is often remembered for being menacing, less so for playing the scholars he often played--but he's also very much the opponent to David Manners' dashing romantic-hero character. You're supposed to respect Ardath Bey/Imhotep for his rather fierce intelligence (and, let's face it, he's a lot more cultured than Arnold Vosloo's Imhotep--no disgusting bugs anywhere!), but at no point are you supposed to identify with him. Which brings me back to my initial point about the faithfulness of the adaptation and how one casting decision can take two movies working off basically the same script (save another hundred million in the special effects budget and a more politically correct atmosphere in '99--no characters here credited as ""The Nubian""...) and make them seem different.

(We'll not get into Weisz' enthusiastic archaeologist vs. Zita Johann's wilting flower.)

This movie is simply a pleasure, not a guilty one at all. It's a good story, simply told and well-acted. Freund was probably not the best director for this; his camera angles sometimes make very little sense, very odd for someone who spent decades in the business as a cinematographer (but I'm not the only person to see that didn't translate; he stopped getting directorial work in 1935). But man, it's Karloff at his best. This may be a better Karloff performance than the one he gives in Bedlam, and I don't say that about much of anything.*** ",1351900800,,2629,5.018348623853211
64981,5,0783234287,"For those who like their horror to be creepy rather than a m&eacute;lange of blood spatter and gore, then one can't go wrong with this film. Made in 1932, this horror classic stars Boris Karloff, who, when he made this film, was riding high on the wave of success of his Frankenstein the year before.

The story is pretty simply. An ancient Egyptian priest, Imhotep, played by Boris Karloff, transgresses by falling in love and is buried alive on the orders of his King. Centuries later, an expedition of British archaeologists, looking for artifacts and antiquaries in Egypt, dig him up and, disregarding caution, release a spell that brings Imhotep back to life. Imhotep, looking none the worse for wear, assumes the persona of Ardath Bey as he walks among us, looking for his lost love with single-minded determination.

This is a very atmospheric film, genuinely creepy, and Boris Karloff give a terrific, restrained performance that makes him sympathetic, despite his being able to kill at will in order to attain his goal. The restraint shown by him, as well as by his co-stars, is surprising, as in the early days of talkies there often was some carryover of the excess of acting that was necessary to the silent film era.

The excellent lighting and cinematography also contributes to the eeriness of the film. Those who are aficionados of horror films will definitely want this one in their collection. They simply don't make them like they used to!",1345334400,,1458,4.870967741935484

I always wonder:  Didn't writers or directors ever go to high school?  'Cause if they had, they would know that all of these movies - well, at least most of them - are so fake and unlikely that those writers and directors would cringe themselves if they knew the truth.  Let's see; what's the template for these movies?. . . .

Geek dude meets hot chick; hot chick warms up to geek dude; a contrived scenario ensues allowing hot chick to realize geek dude is actually a good guy; geek dude ends up with hot chick.  OK; so maybe the dude doesn't always end up with the hot chick, but he has a chance.  (And no.  This is not a spoiler because you've seen this film before a thousand times, even if you haven't seen it even once.)

And why do people like films such as these?  Well, I don't like them, but some people must because they keep getting made.  But I have a theory:  guys want to at least dream that they can trade up to a babe; and women want to feel better about themselves - precariously through the female lead - feeling as if they actually have a heart, and actually are willing to look past weaknesses that guys have, and might be willing to go out with them.

64986,3,0783234287,"Boris Karloff shows them how to spook, even more convincingly than Frankenstein, in some ways. In this one, he speaks, both in English and in ancient Egyptian.

The tomb of Im-Ho-Tep was opened by archaeologists from the British Museum in 1922. It seems he was not mummified in the usual way, with the viscera removed and all that. He was buried alive. One archaeologist says it must have been for treason; the other says it must have been sacrilege. There is also a gold and ivory casket with a curse inscribed on it, promising death to anyone who opens it. The guy who knows about magic argues that they should not open it, but while they are away from it arguing, the young archaeologist (student?) opens it. Sure enough, he dies.

The scroll inside is the Scroll of Thoth, which records the incantation Isis used to raise Osiris from the dead. As the student translates it, Im-Ho-Tep opens his eyes and moves his arms. The student gets hysterical as the mummy walks out of the tomb.

Fast forward ten years. The mummy has become Ardith Bey, an Egyptologist who looks like a shriveled prune, but which could be written down to being very old. He is, of course; 3,700 years old, give or take! And he talks in that famous Karloff voice that always seems like he's a funeral director.

Well, we do find out what his sacrilege was: he fell in love with a priestess of Isis, a daughter of the Pharaoh who was a consecrated virgin. And when she died, he attempted to revive her with the Scroll of Thoth incantation. So it turns out she was reincarnated -- or the girl in the slinky dress is her distant descendant, I'm not sure which.

64988,5,0783234287,"This film is an all-time classic, and certainly much better than the recent action schlock that has been thrust before us.

In a memorable performance, Boris Karloff is simply superb in his role as The Mummy. Amidst some pretty stiff contemporary competition (Lugosi, Chaney, etc.), Karloff reigns supreme as the true master of monster motion pictures. He manages to be both menacing and seductive at the same time.

Special mention must go out to Zita Johann, a stage-trained actress who spurned Hollywood yet nonetheless turned in a distinctive performance as the woman in peril. Johann's captivating eyes and cat-like mannerisms render her a perfect cast for the dual role. A strong believer in reincarnation, Johann really embodies the 'spirit' of her character.

Kudos also to make-up artist extraordinaire Jack Pierce - remember, this is 1932!

Back to Karloff, his restrained yet powerful talent as an actor shines in this film because for most of the time he is unwrapped on the screen. The human form of the monster is more frigtening to me than the linen-wrapped one, thanks to Boris.

There are a plethora of memorable scenes in this picture like the immortal stare, the pool of time, the encounter in the house over the scroll, and I really like the subdued opening (the Mummy's hand reaching for the sacred scroll and the trailing linen strip as he walks away is almost Hitchcock-ian).

It's a shame that the subsequent movies in this franchise failed to come even remotely close to the original, but that's OK because even having this one all-time classic is a true gift. I can only hope that today's generation gets more exposure to Boris Karloff because he is uncanny and he is very worthy of rememberance.",1331337600,,1722,4.9206896551724135

64991,4,0783234287,"THE MUMMY

Egyptology hit its peak during the early 20th century in Britain and America, and Universal's The Mummy went on to capitalize on this wonder.  With the opening of long lost tombs and unearthing of ancient artifacts came an understanding of the ancient world.  But with this new knowledge also came the mysticism of the old Egyptian pantheon and all that it brought with it--the afterlife, curses, and naturally, mummies.  The movie The Mummy explores all these themes, intertwined into a love story that stretches back thousands of years.

It begins with an archeological dig in which an old mummy is inadvertently brought back to life.  The mummy is Imhotep, a priest who was embalmed alive and whose tomb was desecrated as punishment for the practice of necromancy.  The goal of this dark art was to bring his deceased lover back to life, a goal Imhotep intends to conclude in his new life.  He takes the name Ardath Bey and slowly begins to plot his moves to recover his long lost love in the reincarnation of a beautiful young woman, Helen Grosvenor.  To those who surround her, Helen is just an ordinary girl, but Imhotep recognizes her for who is really is and seeks to once again restore their love, a love so long on hold.

In reality, The Mummy is nothing more than a love story with a mystical backdrop.  But it is so skillfully done that it actually immensely interesting.  Unlike Dracula--which has a similar formula to The Mummy--the story is very engaging.  I think to reason for this lies in the powerful performances of the two leads played by Boris Karloff as Imhotep, and Zita Johann as Helen.  Both actors dominate the scenes they are in, and their chemistry is captivating.  This is not a perverse love, or an act of predation as in Dracula.  Imhotep and Helen are in love.  They are meant to be together, their happiness only impeded by death, and this makes the scenes when they are on the screen together magical.

Karloff himself is great as the powerful priest come back to life.  He plays the part convincingly, his movements are slow and deliberate and his speech comes through nearly closed lips.  But it are his eyes that glare so menacingly and exude a magical quality.  He is cool, all knowing, and master of an art long lost to the world, but known by him.  Not only can Imhotep's magic intercede death, but life as well.  He uses this art not only to see into the lives of those he seeks to destroy, but he can actually inflict harm upon them.  Imhotep even locks himself away in this sort of modern temple guarded by loyal servants and spells.

The Mummy's makeup is again the product of Jack Pierce and looks fantastic.  What I like is the transformation the mummy undergoes.  In the beginning, he is wrapped and decrepit looking.  But When Imhotep reemerges as Ardath, the wraps are gone but the flesh of his face is still worn and tired looking.

This is an interesting portrayal of the mummy, and ironically, contrary to most people's perception.  Most images of the mummy are of a more malevolent character dragging his legs slowly under him, covered in bandages with arms outstretched.  Imhotep is the total opposite.  His character is deep and you are allowed to feel great sympathy for him.  He has suffered much between the death of his love and the tortured execution he undergoes.  It is hard to draw a conclusion about him, but regardless, one cannot help but to at least understand his dilemma.

The conclusion of the film is in my opinion one of the best in horror history.  The viewer is torn, much in the way Helen is torn, between the romantic and spellbinding Egypt of ancient times, and the dull and conventional modern world.  Helen will ultimately be forced to choose, but will the destiny of the ancient gods and goddesses seal her fate?",1318464000,,3804,4.649175412293853

The story begins with Egyptian hieroglyphics and music often played as a warning. A 1921 British expedition is excavating for science and knowledge. They hint at financial returns. They learn this mummy was a punished man. Treason? Sacrilege? Familiarity with the Vestal Virgins? They find a small casket. Will they open it? One man finds a scroll and reads it. That long-dead mummy comes to life! Later a man brings a relic to these explorers. Workers sing as they dig up this site, the tomb of an ancient princess. This is placed in the British Museum. Ahmed Bey returns to visit. We learn about Helen Grosvenor. ""Is anything the matter?"" She walks as if in a trance. Some kind of curse?

Ahmed Bey meets her again? He tells the scientists he wants that scroll back, it is his property. Will they destroy it? Not if Ahmed can cause a death! The servant substitutes newspaper for the scroll and burns it. Death by natural causes? Those ashes are analyzed, it wasn't papyrus. Can a figure of Isis protect Frank? There is a story about life from 3,700 years earlier. A princess died. The Scroll of Thoth was stolen, the punishment was to be buried alive. Those who did this were also silenced. Helen returns. ""Where is the dog!"" A white cat? Helen doesn't remember. She is not well, she is getting weaker. Medical science is hopeless. But they have a plan to counter Ahmed. Ahmed uses magic to call Helen to him. He plans a new future for Helen. She refuses. ""I want to live."" Can she be saved? A statue comes to life to stop Ahmed; he collapses like the dead being he is (as in some vampire movies). Helen is saved to live with Frank.

You'll note some parallels between this story and the vampire film ""Dracula"". An undead creature desires the life of a young maiden until he is stopped and destroyed. The couple may live happily ever after. Could the undead represent the massive war debt that was harming the living in the 1930s? Most European countries repudiated their war debt around this time.

64997,2,0783234287,"""I Love You Beth Cooper"" is a comedy film starring ""Heroes"" ingenue Hayden Panettiere in the title role. The film's pitch may have sounded great on paper-- Nerdy high school senior Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) declares his years-long crush on popular cheerleader Beth on their graduation day, invites her to a party that no one is really coming to, only to have her show up, and all sorts of wacky misadventures ensue.

Indeed, it apparently sounded good on paper since the screenplay was adapted by the novel's author Larry Doyle. That being the case, the excuse of having an unsympathetic interpreter doesn't apply here. The characters are, of course, stereotypes, but for the most part they're not particularly entertaining stereotypes: Denis, despite his temporary boldness in his valedictorian speech, comes across as relentlessly wimpy for the entire rest of the film; the same goes for his best friend Rich (Jack Carpenter), a film-quoting geek who can't help but give the IMDB-rundown on every line he clips from a film character; it's not until the end when this character finally gets some backbone..

As the title character, Panettiere's Beth Cooper is the typical vapid and so-popular-i'm-really-depressed Dream Girl that populates these kinds of movies. An aside about a deceased sibling is vaguely touching but it comes far too late to justify why Denis would pine so long for someone who quite literally didn't know he existed until that day. Ms. Panettiere is as cute as a button, but she really isn't given much to do here. Beth's best-pals are even less-developed. Beth's rageaholic (and apparently drug addict!) boyfriend Kevin (Shawn Roberts) slightly resembles a young Bill Paxton. Alan Ruck, an alumnus of the conceptually similar ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" plays Denis' wants-to-be-cool dad (champagne is made available for Denis' party), though it's surprising that no lines from ""Bueller"" were clipped here for comic effect.

before the end of the film, entire houses are casually destroyed, reckless drivers menace the road, and nary a police officer is called, apparently.

Chris Columbus has delivered a number of entertaining films over the years, including the first two Harry Potter films, and the tangentially similar ""Adventures in Babysitting"". Unfortunately, he stumbles badly here.",1298851200,2,2316,5.2853260869565215
64998,1,0783234287,"I usually don't review movies, but I felt it would be beneficial to other people to warn them just how horrible this movie was. Denis Cooverman (played by Paul Rust), is a nerdy kid who is in love with a girl completely out of his league; Beth Cooper (played by Hayden Panettiere).

Denis has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. He is downright creepy with a stalker-ish fixation on the ""most attractive"" girl in school. Not only that, but he has the worst personality I've ever seen in a movie. When attempting to be humorous (which is quite often) he just comes across as such a loser and it's painful to watch. At the beginning of the movie, he calls out multiple people, one of which included his best friend for being gay. He pretty much alienates himself (well even more so than before since nobody liked him in the first place) from everybody.

Usually I root for the underdog, but that wasn't the case for this kid. I got about 3/4 of the way through the movie when I finally called it quits having finally succumbed to just how crappy it was and decided to turn the movie off.

I went into this movie with an open-mind, but after everything was said and done, I just couldn't bear watching the entire movie. Had Denis been played by another actor, it would have probably been so much better.",1297814400,,1299,4.495762711864407
64999,5,0783234287,"Many people have simplistic expectations of genre movies - Comedies are supposed to make you laugh, Romances should make you cry, and Horror Films should frighten you - should make your heart beat faster, your breath come in gasps and your body tremble.  This type of expectation, unfortunately, keeps audience members from enjoying the film set before them.

The so-called Horror films of the 1930's and 40's, especially the ones from Universal, frequently have other ideals in mind.  These films don't aim to make you physically ill from fear, but to evoke the eerie, the uncanny and, above all, the poetic.  The mood of most of these films is that of a vague, half-remembered dream, not unlike a fairy tale for grown-ups.  Karloff, realizing that the term Horror didn't do justice to these misty trips to the unconscious, preferred the term Terror Film.  Concise, perhaps, but it is still misleading.  Let me therefore, suggest the term ""film of shadows"".  These films are awash in a dark poetry, a sensibility that touches those pressure points of the unconscious which COULD evoke a scream, but is more likely to call forth a whispered ""Oooh!""

These shadow films could include most of the ""horror"" films of 1930's Universal Studios, but can also refer to Dreyer's ""Vampyr"", Val Lewton's ""I Walked with a Zombie"", and others.  Low Key masterpieces that chill the bones instead of evoking a feeling of disgust, as is the case with most so-called horror films. (This heading can also include several of Ingmar Bergman's films such as ""The Seventh Seal"" ""The Magician"" and ""Hour of the Wolf"".

The original ""The Mummy"" is one of the greatest of these shadow films.  We hardly ever see the Mummy in his wrappings.  But we imagine him vividly - thanks to Bramwell Fletcher's marvelous performance as Ralph Norton, the archeologist who fell to madness at the sight of the Mummy.  In college, I had the great opportunity to meet and converse with Mr. Fletcher.  What an actor.  He had come to address my acting class, and during his presentation recreated his performance from the Mummy.  Powerful and upsetting!  He passed away about 15 years or so later, but I shall always treasure my brief time with this great man.

One of the frequently ignored aspects of the film ""The Mummy"" is the abundance of humor.  Unlike the humorless Dracula and the ironic, bitter humor of Frankenstein, The Mummy has abundant, good-natured humor.  But it is very dry humor, so it's easy to miss.  For example this scene with David and Zita Johann:

Manners: The fourteen steps down and the unbroken seals were thrilling. But when we came to handle all her clothes and her jewels and her toilet things - you know they buried everything with them that they used in life? - well, when we came to unwrap the girl herself...

Johann: How could you do that?

Manners: Had to! Science, you know.

""The Mummy"" is a film of unexpected delights, a dark fairy-tale well worth revisiting - or even visiting for the first time.  It probably won't scare you, but it doesn't really try to.  It has quite another aim in mind, and succeeds beautifully. I strongly",1292889600,2,3127,4.794392523364486

65001,5,0783234287,"The Mummy is one of those movies that we all think we have seen, with visions of lurching, bandaged corpses. But it really isn't that at all; it's message is much stronger and more complex. Science and religion have always had a strained relationship, whether it was the Catholics and Galileo, the Fundamentalists and evolution, or the Egyptians and archaeology. The Mummy is a movie about the tensions between science and religion, the ways that one thwarts the other, but, more than that, it is a movie about love and the will to love. Yes, call me sentimental, but love is at the core of The Mummy.

Amongst the splendid sets and brilliant use of light and shadow, the incredible makeup of Imhotep, there are many messages in The Mummy. There are warnings of disrespect for the dead and ancient religions, even after 4000 years. There is the message that religion trumps science, can beat it with a scrap of papyrus. But neither ancient cults nor science stand a chance against love, especially when the cult is depriving a person of their will to be with their true love. And that's how it should be, right?",1291420800,,1111,4.668367346938775

During his speech as a Valedictorian - of course - he nasally proclaims his love for Beth Cooper (Hayden Panettiere) and his disdain for Beth's boyfriend Kevin (Shawn Roberts), who is either a PV2 or PFC in the Army.  It's hard to tell since he wears each rank, one on each arm (ridiculous movie mistake).  Along with Denis's friend Rich (Jack Carpenter), who's obsessed with ensuring everyone is aware of his questionable heterosexuality, the two throw the lamest party imaginable.  They invite Beth and her two friends, Treece (Lauren Storm) and Cammy (Lauren London - who is a less sexy version of Bianca Lawson), where a crazy night of drinking, being chased by Kevin, and more social awkwardness.

Second, there is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/She-s-Out-of-My-League/dp/B003IMESBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">She's Out of My League</a>, equally unrealistic but infinitely funnier.

The ride is somewhat entertaining, mostly because of Beth Cooper's driving, but the predictable eventually happens: Denis learns that Beth is not as great as he thought, while Beth opens up and shows the nerd the most adventurous night of his life.  It is a film stuck in PG-13 purgatory, with not enough to attract either the young or old, and nothing plot-wise that isn't derivative.

Anyway, I Love You, Beth Cooper features some of the most predictable and ""been there, done that"" teenage humor I've ever seen.  This movie brings absolutely NOTHING new to the table in the genre of silly, pointless teen comedies.  However, it's not a total loss.

I love the scene with the guy going crazy and towel smacking the school bullies to shreds in a locker room, haha.  A classic moment.  This scene alone elevates the rating up an additional point from a 2 out of 5, to a 3!  He whips 'em up good and hysterically!

Besides that, there's a LOT of predictable humor.  For instance, one evening a group of teenagers decide to go cow tipping.  Yes, you know what happens.  They can't actually tip the cows because something goes wrong.  In this case, one kid steps in poo poo and then has to deal with the cows chasing after him and his friends- this may be considered humor for the sake of the movie, but trust me, in real life it's NO laughing matter when a bunch of cows are chasing after you.  I can certainly relate to THAT freaky moment!

Anyway, another good moment of the storyline is the very beginning when, during a classmates graduation speech, he actually reveals all kinds of personal information about himself along with admitting his love for a female classmate of his by the name of... yes you guessed it, Beth Cooper.  Talk about embarrassing!  I can relate to this though- I remember doing similar things in 12th grade and didn't care how embarrassing it was because it was my final year.

65011,4,0783234287,"What stands out significantly for me in Karl Freund's 1932 Universal horror classic THE MUMMY is the amazing makeup (a tour-de-force in some opinions) by Jack Pierce. This had to be a daunting and meticulous task, and not easy at all on Boris Karloff. The overall effect is truly remarkable and downright spooky. (Check out the extreme closeup on the DVD at 39.51 or 45.32. This shot would make a super computer wallpaper.)

Second to the makeup would be the camera work and lighting. It's at times subtle and then dramatic, and it paints an atmosphere of strong menace.

The 1930's was a golden period for horror and supernatural films. Now, of course, the 1940's had their good crop of frightful fare (Val Lewton and Jacques Tourneaur come to mind, as do films such as THE UNINVITED and DEAD OF NIGHT). But there's something about those first Universal films that were extraordinary, and so steeped in rich horror and fantasy... So macabre and ominous and otherworldly.

There's a good amount to praise and to like about this film, even though for me it is not as good as Universal's FRANKENSTEIN or THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. Those two movies are top drawer 1930's horror in my book, along with the deliciously uber-creepy THE OLD DARK HOUSE (also from 1932, also featuring Karloff).

Many elements of THE MUMMY reminded me of Tod Browning's DRACULA: the long periods of silence in some parts of the film, the intro music (melody from SWAN LAKE), a woman character under the power/magic/control of a sinister yet emotionally tortured man, a budding romance, eternal life, and the mature doctor/elder battling evil (here it is Edward Van Sloan, who also played Dr. Van Helsing in DRACULA and Dr. Waldman in FRANKENSTEIN). I suppose Universal figured if DRACULA worked so well they may as well borrow from it in certain ways. It is almost a revamping of the vampire movie in some ways. Pun intended.

Zita Johann is so striking here as the love interest(s). They don't make 'em like her anymore. Such a lovely and exotic face. She's perfect for this sort of movie.

Karloff is so ""big"" in this film, such a striking and formidable figure. There's a power there, and a dignity of sorts. He makes a huge impression on moviegoers (even though he is slim and has a slight lisp). He is imposing, and watching this film you realize how slender he really was when you see his arms and chest and shoulders here.

The early sequence in which Imhotep comes to life is the best part of the film-- simply because so much is not shown... you are left to your own imagination to fill in the creepy details. This entire scene is done so well (pacing, lighting, photography, compositions, audio, editing)... it's just wonderful to behold. You are pulled in, curious, waiting for the inevitable horror. It's fantastic anticipation, and a keen use of image and sound-- very economical, really. This scenario alone is why THE MUMMY is a good horror movie.

This is an artful film, nicely done. It has its little flaws but the picture is impressive. It's methodical in its suspense. It involves some strong emotions in the story. There's so much to observe and note, from little details to wide sweeping cinematic gestures; that formula/recipe makes for a good film.",1270080000,4,3247,4.775401069518717

But the most heartwarming thing about this film is that Rust's Denis Cooverman loves her regardless, which is showcased so poignantly sweet in the final scene.

The premise is actually pretty good, high school geek admits in his valadictorian speech, his crush on the pretty and popular cheerleader  Beth Cooper. The speech is actually one of the best parts of the movie. The humor however appears lost on anyone over a certain age (we'll say twenty to twenty five is the cutoff.)Underneath the high schoolish humor and the unbeilvably of the plot twists, there is an intresting message about living for the day and seizing the moment that archs through the entire movie, along with seeing beyond looks and perception in people.

Sometimes, I like the cliffhanger ending were the viewer is allowed to make their own conclusion about what happens to the characters, but the lack of a definitive hook up by Beth and Denis takes away from the movie I feel, because it leaves one wondering ""Was this just a one night thing""  or do they hook up later on. Another downside, I don't think the characters were as fleshed out as they could've been, but i'm not sure if that's a problem in the writing or acting. Hayden Panettiere seemed like she was playing the tweener cheerleader (were we supposed to dislike her at first and than grow to feel empathy for her later or were we supposed to feel sympathy for her all along ?

Still I liked this movie, despite the crazy scenerios and the basic characters that lacked depth because on some level, I could relate to it because most of us have chased the popular girl/guy. It was fairly fun and a harmless way to spend two hours, if you watch the extras. Sometimes, I feel like movies get analyzed to death.

65020,2,0783234287,"Just another teenage graduation night film?  Or something much better?

""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" was a film that debuted back in the Summer of 2009 and is based on a 2007 novel by writer Larry Doyle (""The Simpsons"", ""Beavis and Butthead"").  With a screenplay adaptation from the novel by Doyle, the film would be directed by Chris Columbus (""Mrs. Doubtfire"", the first two ""Home Alone"" and ""Harry Potter"" films), music composed by Christophe Beck (""The Pink Panther 2"", ""We Are Marshall"", ""Elektra"") and cinematography by Phil Abraham (""Mad Men"", ""The Sopranos"").

Larry Doyle has mentioned that his inspiration for the story was films like ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""The Breakfast Club"" and his take on graduation night and the adventures of five teenagers.

The film revolves around Denis Cooverman (played by Paul Rust, ""Semi-Pro"", ""Inglourious Basterds""), a valedictorian at his high school who is planning to go to college at Stanford University.  A smart student, he has his life going for him.  But if there was one thing that he regrets, it's the fact that he has always had a crush on Beth Cooper.

He hangs out with his best friend Rich Munsch (played by Jack Carpenter, ""The Return of Jezebel James"", ""The Journal"") who gives him a pep talk that because it's graduation day, if he has things to get off his chest, let it out with no regrets.  Tell Beth Cooper how he feels and  for Denis, this stays in his head but instead of telling her face-to-face, he figured why not tell her on graduation day during his valedictorian speech.

As he gives his speech and talks about living life with no regrets, in front of everyone at the graduation, he tells the popular cheerleader Beth Cooper (played by Hayden Panettiere, ""Heroes"", ""Shanghai Kiss"", ""Malcolm in the Middle"") that he loves her and how he has always loved her.  But somehow along the way, his speech starts to go downhill as he takes a swipe on fellow students such as his his best friend, Rich (who he tries to give a hint that its time to come out of the closet), a swipe at the school bully that has tormented him throughout their school years,  a hint to the girls who has an eating disorder, a swipe that men shouldn't be dating high school students (a dig at Beth Cooper's boyfriend Kevin, who is played by Shawn Roberts) and a dig on a popular but yet shallow student.  Of course, no names are being said but high school students start to judge who may be the person Denis is referring to and thus changes the jovial graduation to a graduation full of discomfort and confusion.  Needless to say, students who think Denis was talking about them, give him the stare of death after the graduation day.

Denis doesn't realize the severity of what he has done but for Beth Cooper, she was very much appreciative of what he had to say, although her military boyfriend Kevin is not and really wants to beat Denis up.

Fortunately, this causes problems between Beth and Kevin and sure enough, Denis is able to get her to possibly come to party he is hosting at his house.

Since Denis and Rich are not exactly popular students and very much are nerds, his parents (played by Alan Ruck and Cynthia Stevenson) leave the house for some R&R and hope their son has a great party. Of course, during a man-to-man talk with Denis and his father, his father tells him and Rich that if needed, there are condoms in the drawer of his bedroom.  Of course, Denis is happy his dad is giving his blessing to get lucky tonight while Rich wonders if the condoms are meant to be used on each other (furthering Denis's feelings that his friend is gay).

So, while the two wonder if anyone is going to come to their party, Beth Cooper and her two popular cheerleading friends Cammy Alcott (played by Lauren London, ""90210') and the bubbly yet not-so-smart Treece (played by Lauren Storm, ""Flight 29 Down"", ""The Game Plan"") come to the party.  With no one else coming, both Denis and Rich try to entertain the ladies but meanwhile, Beth tries to make her ex-boyfriend Kevin jealous by telling him that she's spending her time with Denis.

Next thing you know, Beth's ex-boyfriend Kevin and two of his military friends go to Denis's home and so livid that his girlfriend is spending time at Denis's house, they start trashing the place, while Kevin's mission  is to literally beat up on him.

Denis tries to fight and defend himself and of course, it leads to nothing and thus both he and Rich end up escaping the house through the window and falling to the ground.  After sustaining some injuries, the two manage to join Beth Cooper and friends on an adventurous graduation night which leads them to bare Beth's bad driving,  buying beer at a convenience store, going to a farm  to tip cows, going to a graduation night party where a lot of the high school kids are at and avoiding destruction on the roadway while trying to have a good graduation night and for the most part, to be out of the way of Kevin and his friends.

But through the night, Denis who feels that he knows everything about Beth Cooper starts to see a side of her that he has never seen before.  A good side but also a bad side.

Will Denis survive the night and will Beth Cooper get to know the real him?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (AVC@33MBPS).  For the most part, picture quality is pretty good as the film is featured in the sunlight.  But the film pretty much takes place during the night.  During the day, colors are vibrant, during the evening the blacks are nice and deep and I saw no visual artifacts or banding.

For the most part, the film looks very good.  But to tell you the truth, I didn't notice too many details that stood out.  The truth is that there are not exactly a lot of memorable scenes as most of the action takes place inside Denis's home or inside Beth's car.  Seeing the scabs or blood all over Denis's face is something I wasn't really trying to look for detail but if there was one scene that stood out, it was a breathtaking scene overlooking the lake and mountains near the end of the film.  Picture quality is good for the film on HD.

As for the audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (also in Spanish, Portuguese and French 5.1 Dolby Digital).  The film is primarily a dialogue and music driven film and are front and center channel driven.  There are some scenes that utilize the surrounds such as crowds heard or the various crashing of cars or during the more action-based scenes.  Probably one scene where you get the most action is when Beth Cooper literally crashes to a home where party is being held. But for the most part, the film is literally more about the dialogue and the music and the lossless audio definitely showcases the modern music of this film.

Subtitles are featured in English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese and Cantonese.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" was like a mashup of my favorite teen/young adult films that I have enjoyed in the past and present.  A little bit of ""Sixteen Candles"", ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Say Anything"", ""American Pie"", ""Superbad"", ""Go"", ""Nick and Norah's Playlist"" to name a few.  With each of those films, there is a sort of redemption with the characters or some type of happy ending.  I suppose you can say that with this film, ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"", it's more like a one night stand that really doesn't go anywhere after that.  I couldn't help but feel that perhaps there were major differences between the novel and the film version.

As for the main characters, it's not that they are unlikeable but Denis and Rich are your stereotypical nerds and with this storyline, you sort of think that this film would predictable in that the nerd gets the hot girl at the end or meets some success, whether redemption against the bully or possibly even getting a new girlfriend.

If anything, for most teen films or similar style of films, the main nerd characters always gets the better end of the deal at the end of the film but in this case, I felt that redemption was given to the Denis's best friend Rich (who is just a supporting character) and he gets to have all the fun at the end and somehow, that just didn't seem right to me.  Somehow the main character, Denis Cooverman gets lots in the shuffle and by watching this film, you can't help but feel sorry for him.  He literally becomes the human punching bag and you wish for that ""3:00 High"" moment of redemption of where he would defend himself.  It's important to note that there is an alternate ending included on the Blu-ray via the special features where Denis does get that redemption but unfortunately, the final cut chose not to go that direction.

""I Love You, Beth Cooper""  is not a bad film nor is it a spectacular teen film.  But  I'll admit, I did enjoy it.  I enjoyed the nightly adventures by the five characters (granted, it helps if you had a wild experience during your graduation night) and the crazy adventures they endured throughout the day and night.  There are some comedic moments courtesy of the character of Rich and Treece.

And fortunately there are some shining moments with Paul Rust as the main character of Denis.  If anything, he is a good hearted guy.  Nerdy..but a good-hearted guy who is not all that good with talking to girls. Rust captures that feel of the character and that awkward nerdiness.  Hayden Panettiere is very good at playing the popular cheerleader who likes to have fun and party but also likes to have some danger in her life (sounds similar to her ""Heroes"" counterpart but really, it's not).  And it was great to see Alan Ruck as Denis's father in the film, 23-years later after taking part in his own successful, teen adventure film as the best friend in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"".

But it's that one scene that was changed in the film from the novel (the convenience store scene) between Denis and Beth Cooper that was so important but in order to not get the R rating and keep it at PG-13,  I felt would have really made sense to the audience of why Rust's character starts to see things differently with Beth Cooper.  In my opinion, that was one scene critical to the novel that brings a turning point to the storyline.  So, it's unfortunate that version of that one scene was not used.

Overall, ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" is an entertaining teenage graduation night film but nowhere near being classic.

At the end of the day, you can see how Chris Columbus and even Larry Doyle tried to bring that John Hughes style to the film.  But Hughes was a master in character development and knew how to take those characters to the craziest and more touching moments of the film.  We see the adventure, we just don't feel captivated by the characters.  Again, the film has its share of fun moments but it's the final payoff that you expect from these type of films is what is lacking from ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"".  In the end, ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" is a fun popcorn flick but nothing more than that.",1257292800,6,12425,4.6061846293769895
65021,4,0783234287,"I sat through this whole film just for the sake of making sure this Blu was all I was really seeing and hearing - and it blows me away that Fox made such a great product on a subpar movie like this. The Blu clarity was outstanding throughout; night sequences, colors, saturation, action, landscapes - all of it. The DTS was great; the music was mixed perfect as to still hear the simultaneous dialogues perfectly and the outer channels get used quite a bit. The supplements are extensive and include:

(HI-DEF)
* 7 minute alternate ending. It branches off from the dock scene near the end of the theatrical cut and takes a way different slant with the three muscle heads imposing on their lake location with weird results. You do not see any of the parent-in-the-yard ending.
* 7:36 minutes of deleted scenes with a play all option. Forgettable, glad they were cut.
* 5:54 minutes of  Love U Larry Doyle. The inspiration behind the story and interviews with the author.
* 8:54 minute We're All Different plug. Essentially the casting reasons, how everyone liked their parts, blah, blah, blah.
* 2:48 minute Peanut Butter Toast. A home video clip of Rust singing about making toast in his kitchen - painful.
(LO-DEF)
* 3:02 minute Fox interview with Paul Rust. An ad plug for the film with an interview.
* 3:02 minute Fox interview with Hayden. Same thing.

The only thing I got out of this was all the movie trivia his sidekick kept spewing, liked it. Otherwise this whole corny story of the nerd getting the hot chick through a million unlikely events, road trips and bad acting didn't work for me. I am sure this will appeal to the teen fans of Hayden and some of the other eye candy followers (Shawn Roberts, etc.) But, I have to rate this higher overall because the Blu provides plenty of reference points for a film of this genre; both sound and pic clarity (especially those lake/mountain panorama scenes). The supplements may be contrived but they are thorough - so 2 for the film, 1.5 for the Blu and .5 for the supps. Enjoy.",1257120000,2,2033,4.579670329670329

Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) is the valedictorian of Buffalo Glenn High School. He is obviously a smart kid for in addition to his class standing as he has been accepted into a premed program at Stanford University and he is the captain of the debating team. On the downside he isn't very good looking, isn't an athlete, and isn't very successful with girls. He has had a long time crush on the head cheerleader, Beth Cooper (Hayden Panettiere), but has been too shy to speak to her. Besides she has a boyfriend in the army who perhaps just might be special forces material.

Denis has a very sexually confused friend, Rich (Jack Carpenter), who everyone else thinks is gay. Rich puts Denis up to telling Beth what he really thinks during his valedictory speech. This was clearly out of line. While he is on a roll he also tells what he thinks of everyone else including Beth's boyfriend who is on leave for the event, the school bully, and the schools rich [...]. Finally he suggests that his Rich embrace his presumed sexuality.

This leads to several reactions the most encouraging for Denis is that Beth speaks to him and ""lets him live."" Denis manages to invite her to his graduation party before being assaulted by her very angry boyfriend. Being spared serious bodily harm by the intervention of the school principal, Denis and Rich go home to their party which seems to be only the two them. Then surprisingly Beth with her two sidekicks Cammy (Lauren London) and Treece (Lauren Storm) actually show up to the party. Denis and Rich descend into complete dorkiness and probably the whole incident would have been a joke for the girls. But, then Kevin (Shawn Roberts) and his two army buddies crash the ""party"" resulting in the two nerds and the three hot girls spending an evening together, mostly on the run from the army guys.

While much of the action is typical of teen flicks, Beth Cooper manages to capture something very special. One begins to realize that Beth's life as one of the coolest girls in Buffalo Glenn isn't really all it's imagined. She is smart enough to realize that it over. While graduation marks the beginning of a upward tend in Denis's life, it will mark beginning of a downward slope for Beth's. This brought home in a scene in which the girls go back to the school and do their cheerleading routine for the Denis and Rich. Panettiere portrays Beth's sadness convincingly in this scene.

The teen antics are overplayed as is typical in films of this genre. In real life Beth and Kevin would be arrested for the excess depicted. They would be sued for more than they could payoff in a long time as well. But, It's all in good fun and I'd chalk it up to comedic license. The same goes for the bedroom scene envolving Rich with Cammy and Treece. Perhaps he really isn't gay after all!

Some have criticized the movie based on the implausibility Beth being temporarily interested in nerdy Denis. However, Beth isn't stupid even if she is far from the idealized dream girl Denis had long fantasized . Her relationship with Kevin was clearly deteriorating. Perhaps she saw a chance to move up to a future doctor. Cetainly her life the popular girl in high school is over and she knows it. Beth turned out to be quite a bit different than Denis has imagined but the reality had its own merits.

65025,1,0783234287,"...are the the only words that came to mind. Yeah, I went to go see it despite a nearly universal crushing blow that was delivered by the film critic industry.

But it really is that bad. It should come as no surprise, based on the movie trailer, that a high school brainiac confesses his true love to the prettiest cheerleader in high school during his valedictorian speech. During his initial speech, he makes an attempt of a joke that is intended to fall flat.

The rest of the movie is just that, though. When it DOES try to make a joke, it falls flat. Also, the rest of the movie plays out like a real high school geek's dream of how things might turn out. The girl comes over with her friends (initially as a joke) and they all wind up getting caught up in crazy situations that is supposed to make the geek realize that there should be fun in your life when you're young and to make the pretty young thing realize that there is more to love.  It's a movie that sincerely tries to show that it has a heart, but it truly doesn't and even our main character doesn't come across as wholly sympathetic either.

Sadly, it doesn't play out realistically or comedically. It plays out more like a series of sketches with a ""romantic teen comedy"" somehow loosely stringing it together like wet pasta noodles restraining a felon.

It's horrible, it's unfunny, and I don't buy how the girls manage to remain hanging around with our high school geek and his friend. Also...SPOILER ALERT...the sexual situation that his friend finds himself later in is so ridiculously unreal that I almost yelled out, ""Oh, come on!"" just when I thought that it couldn't get any worse. It might have come across as funny to a 7th grader, but certainly not to anyone who loved Hughes' teen comedies of the 80s.

Skip the movie...skip the DVD...man, even skip the RENTAL. It's...NOT...WORTH...YOUR...TIME!",1255564800,11,1879,4.610778443113772

On opening day, I caught the 2:30 showing and I have to say, this movie is pretty good! It stayed close/true to the book, but they edited a lot done to keep the movie at a PG13 movie. I really enjoyed it. It has a modern day John Hughes feeling to it. It's an enjoyable movie.

65028,2,0783234287,"What, I ask you, would be accomplished by humiliating your high school classmates during a graduation speech? And I mean other than making everyone hate you. In ""I Love You, Beth Cooper,"" valedictorian Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) uses his final speech as an opportunity to say what he has been longing to say ever since his freshman days, none more important the five words that make up the film's title. Other than her, he mentions no one else by name; he only alludes to specific people by describing obvious character traits. You can be sure that everyone knew who he was referring to, and that brings me back to the question I posed at the start of this review. When you use your graduation as a platform to put other people down, you should not be surprised when they get very angry at you.

""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" opens on a wrong premise. The entire film is wrong. On every level imaginable. It's not funny. It's not cute. It's not even remotely engaging or clever in its approach to the story. It's a brainless, mean-spirited film that treats comedy like a second-class citizen. It's appalling that it was directed by Chris Columbus, who once proved he could be entertaining with such fun fare as ""Home Alone,"" ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" ""Rent,"" and the first two ""Harry Potter"" films. For ""I Love You, Beth Cooper,"" the Directors Guild of America should have done him a favor and resurrected that old standby Alan Smithee, a pseudonym for directors who didn't want their real names attached their films.

Having been embarrassed in front of the whole graduating class, Beth Cooper (Hayden Panettiere) and her dimwitted friends decide it would be funny to go to Denis' house, where he and his friend, Rich Munsch (Jack T. Carpenter), host a pathetic post-graduate party that absolutely no one wants to go to. Does Beth like Denis? Not really. But she does find him amusing. Her boyfriend, a testosterone-pumping, cocaine-sniffing military brute named Kevin (Shawn Roberts), does not find him amusing at all. In fact, he would like nothing more than to slowly and painfully kill Denis, preferably when it also involves the destruction of private property. Hoping to escape Kevin, Beth takes Denis and Rich on an all-night road trip in her mini hatchback. Maybe ""road trip"" isn't the right term--Beth has the driving skills of a chimpanzee.

Along the way, Beth and Denis begin the process of getting to know one another. More accurately, Denis tries to survive Beth while she stands back and watches him continually make a fool of himself. I guess we're supposed to sympathize with her somewhere along the way, seeing as she gradually reveals her emotional side, calloused over after years of being used by other boys. Did Columbus and screenwriter Larry Doyle (who adapted his own novel) actually believe that this movie could make us care about her situation? When you willingly include a scene in which tampons are used to stop a nosebleed, you can't believably pause to make a meaningful statement. You definitely can't hint at the possibility of a sweet teenage romance.

Most importantly, you can't begin a story with an act of stupidity and then expect the audience to blindly accept everything that happens afterwards. In all honesty, part of me sided with Denis' classmates--God knows I'd be mad as hell if I was outed in front of everyone. There's absolutely nothing to be gained by pointing out someone's eating disorder, exposing the emotional turmoil raging within the school bully, or encouraging your best friend to come out of the closet. I'm referring to Rich, who constantly quotes from movies and has the uncanny ability to name the actor who said it, the movie it was said in, and the year the movie was released. If there's one thing most people can't stand, it's when someone goes through life as an unwanted human encyclopedia.

I can already see the comments this review will get. ""God Chris, it's a comedy. It was never meant to win awards. Not everything has to be an art house movie. Get a life."" True, I'm being hard on this film. True, I believe it's a shallow and juvenile story that will never win an award (except, maybe, for a Razzie). True, an art house movie in all likelihood would have been an infinitely better choice. But you know what? There is such a thing a good escapist comedy. I gave passing grades to both ""Balls of Fury"" and ""My Best Friend's Girl,"" two films that most critics dismissed as cinematic garbage. I felt they had ambition. ""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" most definitely did not. It only wanted to be a mindless farce about idiotic people. Denis, who clearly doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut, is the most idiotic person of all. Then again, maybe that distinction belongs to Columbus, who seems to have forgotten what a movie needs in order to work. Let's hope he gets his memory back.",1247184000,3,4847,4.758620689655173
65029,1,0783234287,"""Recycle"" is generally a good word, one with positive and favorable connotations. But not in the world of movies. I Love You, Beth Cooper is one of those films that horrendously overuses the ideas (and not even the better ones) of previous entries in the teen comedy genre, resulting in an exercise in repetition and failed mimicry. Awkwardly personal advice from a father figure, aggressive small animals, nude scenes without any real nudity, and the all-too-familiar plotline of the bashful introvert chasing after the most popular girl in school are just a few of the rehashed concepts found throughout the picture. There are really only two reasons the film gets a score of two - and both belong to Hayden Panattierre.

During the graduation ceremony at Buffalo Glenn High School, bumbling, socially-challenged valedictorian Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) professes his love for popular head cheerleader Beth Cooper (Hayden Panattiere), as well as insulting his fellow classmates and embarrassing his best friend Rich (Jack Carpenter). While the ill-conceived words toward his peers subsequently cause trouble, his honest confession appears to strike a chord with the idolized teen beauty. Much to Denis' surprise, Beth shows up at his house and a wild night of raucous adventure ensues - one filled with incessant partying, reckless driving, and Beth's maniacally jealous military boyfriend.

It's mildly amusing when the film starts with a rousing rendition of a song entitled ""Forget Me"" at a high school graduation. Following is a food-for-thought speech comprised of awkward prattling that struggles painfully for even the faintest hope of a smirk. But it doesn't get as much as a smile. As each second ticks away, the jokes get more stale, the slapstick more pathetic, and the plot more unbelievable. It's not that the story is hard to imagine - but it is difficult to understand why the cast and crew of I Love You, Beth Cooper ever thought this unimaginably pointless, hopelessly generic mess could pass as entertainment.

It's very tame, excruciatingly PG-13 and terribly immature - which means teens won't see it and neither will adults. Denis discusses with his father that the teenage coming-of-age subject is not a new idea; if only director Chris Columbus had taken that advice and stayed away from Larry Doyle's vastly unoriginal novel. The presentation is bland, the dialogue is weak and not a single memorable or creative concept is introduced during the entire film. It's as amateurish as the socially inept geeks lumpishly trying to court prom queens. Quite obviously an excuse to put Hayden Panettiere in a movie, the sheer lack of humor is the biggest disappointment, while the constant references to other films by Rich is an embarrassment to decent movies everywhere. Even the most pitiful have a worthwhile minute, but aside from being the first film in which Hayden bares a partial breast, I Love You Beth Cooper has not a single satisfying scene. When the film culminates in an all-guy wet towel fight, Beth Cooper herself sums it up best: ""Who said it's supposed to be fun?""

65030,5,0783234287,"For good old-fashioned Universal horror, get yourself wrapped up in Karl Freund's directoral debut with The Mummy (1932).  Filmed in delicious black & white, ever so proper British archeologists are complaining all they found was this mummy (Imhotep) who reclined relaxedly (and dead) in the background.

When the inevitable assistant opens the little box with a curse on it, all sand breaks loose!

Ten years later, we learn that Imhotep has acclimated to Cairo society and is still searching for his timeless love, Princess Anck-es-en-Amon of the 18th Dynasty (there's a quiz after this review, OK??).

Lots of similarities to Dracula, Universal's earlier horror film, mainly because the scriptwriter who collaborated on Dracula also did the same with The Mummy:  talismans (cross & amulets), hypnotic power (vampires and mummies can do both) and other such supernatural thrillers.  And the actor who played Van Helsing in Dracula also appears as an Egyptian occult expert, Dr. Muller, in this film (Edward Van Sloan).

This rented disc is part of the incredible Universal collection and I highly recommend you pick this up.  The disc I had included ""Mummy Dearest"", an excellent portrayal of the Mummy pictures over the years, the incredibly poor sequels and the inevitable fate of all Universal monsters:  a meeting with Abbott & Costello!

The flashback sequence was very well-made:  the mists of time part as we stare into the pool that transcends time and space.  It played like a silent film, haunting music and suspense.  Incredible music!

We learn that the film originally had many other scenes of our leading lady being reincarnated at different historical periods: Vikings, Crusades, and so on.  But they cut all that out to make the picture go at a quicker pace:  smart move in my opinion.

I pray to Osiris that you pick this DVD up soon!

65032,4,0783234287,"I liked the Universal Legacy edition of ""Dracula"" so much, I got the same issue of ""The Mummy"" as well.  The packaging on my copy is slightly improved with the DVD content info printed on the back cover rather than on a sheet glued to the cover. Although I am still impressed by all the extras on this edition, the extras are not as good as the ones on ""Dracula,"" so I am dropping a star.  The two films are actually quite similar.  From the identical opening music to the almost parallel storyline.  Edward Van Sloan and David Manners are in both films and play the same type of roles (Manners playing the romantic love interest who falls for the woman who is under the spell of the ""monster"" and Van Sloan as the professor who observes and understands what is going on and confronts the ""monster"").  One difference in ""The Mummy"" is that, though Dracula is evil on all accounts, Imhotep is a rather sentimental figure.  He is a murderer, but his brutality is a means to reuniting with the woman for whom he sacrificed his life 1,000s of years earlier.  He was just a mummy in love (Karloff, in his scenes with Zita Johann, definitely plays the role as such).

I will focus on the extras offered on this 2-DVD set, as most people who are interested in this release have already seen the film.  Like with the ""Dracula"" issue, You can watch ""The Mummy"" with two different commentaries.  The first commentary includes Rick Baker (makeup man), Scott Essman (horror film researcher), Steve Haberman (screenwriter, film historian), Bob Burns (film buff), and Brent Armstrong (sculptor).  Baker speaks by himself in a separate commentary during the famous mummy awakening scene.  He finds a lot of inconsistencies in the film and admits to not liking it much, although he is a fan of the makeup techniques used.  The others talk together in a more conversational style.  This group does not always follow the scenes.  They talk about other films and heap praise on the players.  I find it the most interesting when they discuss scenes and the film itself.  Armstrong points out Imhotep's wrinkled face and theorizes that the intent was to show that the bandages had replaced his skin.  Another thing I would not have noticed was the rear projection used in the cab scene.  I thought the Universal horror films as a metaphor for the Great Depression idea was a bit stretching it, though.  At the end of the commentary, they go off praising this and that.  I found this commentary interesting but, with all the people involved, it could have been better.

The second commentary is by film historian Paul M. Jensen. Like Steve Haberman's commentary for ""Dracula,"" Jensen reads through prepared notes.  Sometimes he's describing scenes and other times he is giving backgrounds of the players and crew.  At one point, he describes Putnam's Cagliostro.  He gives intriguing information on the discarded scenes.  While I liked this commentary, neither ones on this set are as good as David Skal's on ""Dracula.""

Also on the first disc are a collection of lobby cards and stills (including some from discarded scenes) and a trailer gallery of the many Mummy sequels.  ""Mummy Dearest: A Horror Tradition Unearthed"" is a documentary on the making of the film.  I like the photos of Karloff having his makeup applied.  There is a lot of info on Zita Johann, who clashed with director Karl Freund, and her occultist beliefs.  It compares the film to ""Dracula"" and talks about the other mummy films.  It runs 30 minutes.

On the second disc are three documentaries.  The first is ""He Who Made Monsters: The Life and Art of Jack Pierce.""  This documentary discusses Pierce's work on the films ""Frakenstein,"" ""The Mummy,"" ""The Black Cat,"" ""Bride of Frakenstein,"" ""Son of Frakenstein,"" and ""The Wolf Man.""  I found it very interesting how Frakenstein evolved through the films and the revelation on how one side of his face caved in.  I wished they discussed Pierce's techniques for ""The Man Who Laughs.""  I've wondered how they kept Conrad Veidt's mouth curled up.  It looks very painful.  The documentary concludes with the sad way Pierce was let go from Universal, how he lived the rest of his life in relative obscurity, and his legacy.  It is 25 minutes long.  ""Unraveling the Legacy of the Mummy"" is a bunch of action scenes from the Brendan Fraser films with interview clips from the cast and crew (8 minutes).  ""Universal Horror"" is the same documentary that was on the ""Dracula"" DVD set (probably on ""Frakenstein,"" too).  It is excellent, though.  The rather lengthy documentary covers many of the scary films put out by Universal in the 1920s and 1930s and includes freaky scenes from such films as ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" ""The Man Who Laughs,"" ""The Black Cat,"" etc. I liked the inclusion of scenes from early silents. It also reveals secrets to special effects found in ""King Kong,"" ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" and ""The Invisible Man."" Film historians who were kids back in the day talk about what these films meant to them and the reactions of audiences at the time. Bela Lugosi Jr. talks about his famous father in several clips in this documentary.  I've seen it three times and will probably watch it again.",1237248000,6,5203,4.763128491620112
65033,5,0783234287,"The Mummy is one hour and thirteen minutes long and was released on December 22, 1932. The Boris Karloff's mummy is seen only on screen for about eight minutes and only about a minute of him coming alive and stealing the sacred scroll. The rest of the movie he is Ardath Bey; Imhotep brought back to life. Imhotep\Ardath Bey helps some archaeologists find the burial site of Princess Ankh-es-en-amon. His real intentions are to bring the Princess Ankh-es-en-amon back to life so they can be together forever. Princess Ankh-es-en-amon has taken the soul of Helen Grosvenor. So throughout the movie he is trying to bring Helen Grosvenor to the museum and change her into his Princess Ankh-es-en-amon. The movie flows along well into you get to about five minutes to the end and turns almost south. They could have done a better ending. The Mummy relies on suspense since the horror is minimal at best. Still this deserves an A-.",1233532800,2,926,4.79375
65044,4,0783234287,"Ah, ""The Mummy"" on Halloween night! What could be better? My brother and I, now aging boomers, were allowed as children the special treat to stay up on Friday nights to watch Horror Theater (or whatever it was called) and scare ourselves silly. This was in the late '50's. ""The Mummy"" was a favorite, so when I found this VHS tape in the library, I took it home for Halloween.

After a couple of hours of Trick or Treating, the three children were ready to go home. We put on the movie, expecting magic to revisit. Their grandfather (my brother) and I expected to pass on a tradition. We really thought the nine-year-old boy would delight in the movie. He loves things like this. However, it was too slow for him--he fell asleep soon into the movie, as did the other two children.

That left my brother and me to stroll down Memory Lane with the Mummmy! It wasn't the same story we both remembered. We had the notion of lots of wrappings with the mummy walking all over the place with arms outstretched and killing people. Another reviewer said this wasn't ""The Mummy"" he saw either. Probably a sequel.

Let's return to the reality of the story. We discovered how faulty our memories are. However, the film did surprise us with what was there.

In the 1920's when the discovery of the Tutankhamun tomb was the rage, three other English archaeologists were certain to make a find. Indeed, they did--an ancient sarcophagus with a box attached: Do not open this coffin upon threat of death. Two are wise enough to discuss it. The third cannot control his eagerness and opens it. In a few minutes the mummy is mysteriously wrought to life, and sidles out the door. The archaeologist witnesses this and goes stark raving insane. A chilling scene. The viewer sees only a piece of wrapping sliding out of sight--the only view we get of a newly awakened corpse. Then the hysterical laughing. Everything is always just out of sight. A suggestion of evil. A suggestion of terror. A scream.

The mummy comes back as an Egyptian attached somehow to the museum. It's Boris Karlof in a dark role. Why no one was not creeped out by his persona is beyond me. Bring in the the son of one of the original three archaeologists and the daughter of the museum director and you have a triangle about to happen. Karlof's mummy/man believes she is the reincarnation of his beloved temple virgin from back in the day. He is determined to take her back and almost succeeds.

Today's filming shows all and then some. Old films like this tell the story with suggestion, little nuances, creating creepy atmosphere and mood. As I watched, I slipped in and out of sleep. In one dream sequence I was in the movie, going down one of the underground passages. Only in my dream I rounded the bend to see what veiwers could hear. Black-clad, wispy creatures were stirring around a walking, stalking mummy. I fell on the rocks, they turned toward me. Of course, I awoke, further creeped out.

A successful movie-- ""The Mummy""--even now!",1227571200,2,2999,4.615384615384615
65045,4,0783234287,"Just wanted to mention that I recently compared the transfers on the Mummy Special Edition (Universal Legacy Series) 2-disc DVD released in July 2008 and the original 1999 Universal single-disc DVD release. The quality of the transfers in terms of contrast, brightness, detail, scratches and blemishes, etc., seems to be virtually identical. However, for some unknown reason the framing of the Legacy Series release is cropped tighter than the 1999 edition, with a small but significant loss of picture information along the right, left, and bottom borders. I watched the Legacy Series version yesterday and the missing information was not enough to seriously impact my enjoyment of the movie, but it's kind of irritating that the older, supposedly obsolete edition actually reveals more of the frame than the newer, supposedly definitive edition. Unfortunately, this seems to be typical of Universal's double- and triple-dip DVD editions: two steps forward and one back. I'm still debating whether to hang on to the 1999 edition, which I was hoping to ditch after buying the newest release. So if you're thinking of upgrading in hopes of getting a superior transfer and don't really care about the extras, my advice is stick with the original 1999 release. The only new extras you get with the Legacy Series release are the second commentary track, 1940s Mummy series trailers, and the Jack Pierce featurette, which is interesting but does not contain much new information unless you are completely ignorant of Pierce's career. The Unraveling the Legacy of the Mummy featurette is really just a promo for the two Brendan Fraser Mummy movies, it doesn't even address the 1940s mummy series, or any other mummy movies for that matter. The TCM Universal Horror documentary is nice but it is available on the Dracula and Frankenstein 75th Anniversary Edition DVDs and hardly worth the purchase price of the new Mummy DVD by itself, especially if you already have the Dracula or Frankenstein anniversary sets. If the limited new extras sound worth it to you, go for it, but realize that you are losing some picture information in the feature attraction, not to mention the Production Notes, Cast and Filmmakers' Bios, and Mummy Archives (poster and stills gallery) extras from the 1999 release. I never bought the Mummy Legacy Collection box set so I can't comment on that release.",1227484800,41,2377,5.113110539845758
65046,3,0783234287,I had remembered the mummy movies with Boris Karloff from my childhood.  After viewing this one I think I must have seen only the several sequels that followed.  The foot dragging monster was nearly absent in this movie.  However there was a lot of dialouge.  Of course what was scary in my youth doesn't even register on the scale of the Brandon Frazier mummy movies. Still all-in-all I am glad I purchased the DVD.,1226275200,,416,4.581081081081081
65047,5,0783234287,"-This review pertains to The Mummy: Special Edition DVD-

In 1932, one year after Universal Studios' success with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein/dp/B000GPIPT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boris-Karloff/dp/B000FWHW8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boris Karloff</a>&nbsp;got all wrapped up in a role that would become one of the all-time great movie monsters. As the mummy, Im-Ho-Tep, Karloff gave a drastically different performance than that of the pathetic and misunderstood creature in Frankenstein. Im-Ho-Tep is a cold and methodical killer, his heart warped from the pain of losing his love. He uses any means necessary to obtain that which he covets, whether it's power or people.
The Mummy was the directorial debut of Karl Freund, the brilliant German cinematographer whose works include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metropolis/dp/B00007L4MJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metropolis</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula/dp/B000GPIPSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula</a>, and Murders in the Rue Morgue. Over a decade earlier it was people like Freund who helped to make Germany famous for its expressionist cinema, as well as revolutionizing the way films were photographed. John L. Balderston, the famous playwright who Americanized the Dracula play, which was later to serve as the main inspiration for the 1931 Tod Browning film, wrote the screenplay for The Mummy. The story of The Mummy owes much to screenplay of Dracula and the film even uses members of the cast of that film. However, the presence of Boris Karloff is what gives The Mummy its individual identity and separates it from other horror films of its era. Also, unlike either Dracula or Frankenstein, The Mummy wasn't set in some gothic European locale. No, The Mummy featured exotic Egypt as its setting (though the film was shot entirely in California as almost all Universal pictures were at the time).
Exploiting the obsessive fascination that Americans and Europeans had for all things Egyptian, after the finding of King Tutankhamen's tomb in 1921, the story utilizes mummies, curses, and Egyptian occultism to attract viewers.

After committing sacrilege, Egyptian High Priest, Im-Ho-Tep is buried alive only to be rediscovered 3,700 years later by British archaeologists. He is accidentally resurrected and assumes the identity of Ardeth Bay. Ardeth Bay's one passion, his one obsession is to be reunited with his long-dead lover, Princess Anck-es-en-Amon. Ardeth Bay believes that his loneliness may be over when he meets the beautiful Helen Grosvenor, the reincarnated Anck-es-en-Amon. As Ardeth pursues Helen, he is also determined to obtain the Scroll of Thoth, which will ensure his immortality and his control over Helen. Challenging him are Doctor Muller, an expert on the Egyptian occult, Sir Joseph Whemple, a renowned archaeologist, and his son, Frank Whemple who has fallen in love with Helen. But do these three stand a chance against Ardeth Bay, who has a mastery over hypnosis? Can they save Helen from... The Mummy?

The film stars Boris Karloff (who was billed as Karloff the Uncanny) as Im-Ho-Tep / Ardeth Bay, Zita Johann as Helen Grosvenor / Anck-es-en-Amon, David Manners as Frank Whemple, Arthur Byron as Sir Joseph Whemple, and Edward Van Sloan as Doctor Muller.

This terrifyingly good DVD includes an audio commentary with film historian Paul M. Jensen, an audio commentary with makeup artist Rick Baker, screenwriter Steven Haberman, film historian Scott Essman, Universal horror expert Bob Burns, and sculptor Brent Armstrong, He Who Made Monsters: The Life and Art of Jack Pierce documentary, Mummy Dearest: A Horror Tradition Unearthed documentary, Unraveling the Legacy of The Mummy featurette, Universal Horror feature-length documentary, poster montage with music, and theatrical trailers for all five original Mummy films.

65048,5,0783234287,"...has always been my take on THE MUMMY even when I first saw it as a child. I was fascinated by the Karloff character in the beginning and then felt sorry for him when I realized that he did it all for love. His hypnotic powers were awesome especially the shots of his eyes glowing in their blackened eye sockets. The power of the scarab ring to bring death and the pool of dry ice created lasting memories that have lingered years after first having seen them. And then there was Zita Johann! She was my first real crush to come from the movies. Her face was so striking and her voice seemed so exotic. As I got older, her pre-code evening dress and Princess costume had their own appeal as well. What a pity she made so few films (check out THE SIN OF NORA MORAN to see her at her best). Along with the 1935 THE WEREWOLF OF LONDON, it is my favorite Universal film from their first great horror cycle.

This Universal Legacy Series release (which missed the 75th anniversary by one year) recycles the earler DVD incarnation of the film which is fine as that was a quality release with a cleaned up print and a remastered soundtrack which sounds better than ever. This time around there is a second DVD of bonus features which is highlighted by Kevin Brownlow's Photoplay Production of UNIVERSAL HORRORS which traces the development of Universal as THE horror studio starting back in the silent era with THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. There are numerous plugs for the new MUMMY series with Brendan Fraser and while those are good films by the standards of today (today's audiences would find the original WAY too slow and lacking in action), they lack the atmospheric poetry of the original. For those who are able to respond to it, the 1932 MUMMY remains a unique, dreamlike experience.",1223164800,6,1816,4.536585365853658

65052,4,0783234287,"Essentially a remake of their 1931 smash DRACULA, THE MUMMY is in many ways a more somber, dream-like interpretation of the previous film's themes of undeath, seduction of innocence, and a terror from beyond the ages.  Boris Karloff--not long after his breakthrough role as the more famous Frankenstein's Monster--steps in for Lugosi and plays the eponymous mummy, a cursed Egyptian high priest whose forbidden love for a vestal virgin 3,700 years ago resulted in him being entombed alive.  When a British archaeological team inadverdently revives him, Im-Ho-Tep walks the shifting sands once more.  A few years later, the mummy encounters an unsuspencting young woman named Helen Grosvenor (played by the exotically gorgeous Zita Johann) whom he recognizes as his long-lost love from ages past.  Determined to reclaim his reincarned lover no matter the cost, the ruthless mummy calls upon the powers of darkness in a battle of wits with Helen's doctor (Edward Van Sloan) and her new lover, Frank (David Manners) for the fate of her very soul.

A waking nightmare, THE MUMMY has a phantasmic quality about it that makes it almost possible to believe that the rolling desert sands are indeed haunted by lost gods and walking dead men and that mortals venture out into their cursed territory at great risk to life and sanity.  Karl Freund's direction is tight and sure, and if the story is highly derivative of DRACULA it is in some ways an improvement.  To be sure, the Universal DRACULA is in a class by itself, but THE MUMMY is the more serious of the two and never drags the way its predecessor tends to in certain spots.  The cast is excellent, with Edward Van Sloan essentially playing Van Helsing to Karloff's version of Dracula all over again.  David Manners is, as in DRACULA, the damsel's boyfriend forced to protect her from an undead monster's unwholesome attentions, but while Manners' role was frequently annoying and a bit overdone in DRACULA, it is here more measured and realistic.  Johann possesses a dark, enchanting loveliness that fits her role perfectly, and her performance as the benighted victim of Im-Ho-Tep is empathetic and believable.  And Karloff himself is a masterful villain, consumed by evil and yet tormented by a passionate love that drives him to greater and greater feats of wickedness.  His makeup is minimal but evocative, and his glowing eyes peer from a ghastly visage of pure malevolence.

Fans of the 1999 version of THE MUMMY, an excellent film in its own right, may not find the original to be quite what they're looking for.  The action is much more sparse, to say nothing of the special effects, but nonetheless this first of all Mummy films is a true classic of its genre, a bizarre venture into the Unknown that deserves to never be entirely forgotten.",1216598400,,2800,4.9297872340425535
65053,5,0783234287,"When Universal released 75th Annivesary editions of Dracula and Frankenstein in 2006, I assumed they would release a similiar set the following year for the Mummy, to mark its anniversary.  But 2007 came and went, with no new Mummy DVD.  Now, a year later, we finally get this deluxe edition.

Before I get into the specifics of the discs, I want to share a few thoughts about the film itself.  I've always felt that The Mummy was treated with a bit less respect than Universal's premiere big-screen sound horror movies, Dracula and Frankenstein.  And there's a reason for that: The film offers a more subtle approach to its thrills than those other landmarks of the genre.  As the film's title creature's moves and slow and deliberate, so is the pace of the film.  You probably already know that the iconic bandage-wrapped mummy is only onscreen for a few seconds.  For the bulk of the film, Boris Karloff appears as Ardeth Bey, the 3700 year old (unwrapped) priest who was buried alive for committing blasphemy.  While the film in some ways confounds expectations--especially if you've seen a ""proper"" mummy film, with the living dead skulking around killing folks who've disturbed his/her rest--Karloff's commanding yet understated performance elevates the film to classic status.

Now, if you've bought either of the two previously-released DVD versions of The Mummy, you might wonder whether you should bother with this edition.  And I think it comes down to how much you like the film itself, and whether you have a strong desire to learn a little more about its creation.  As for the film itself, I've compared it to both the original single-disc release and the 2004 Legacy Collection version. . .and haven't found enough differences in the audio or video quality to recommend an upgrade solely based on expected improvments in the transfer.  There's still some graininess to be found in the outdoor scenes, but the overall result probably represents the best the film will ever look.  Audio?  It's a mono film; it doesn't matter if you have the latest Dolby Pro-Geek 13.1 Surround Sound or whatever, it won't sound any better.

There are several bonus features which were held over from the Legacy Collection.  These include audio commentaries, the well-done ""Mummy Dearest"" documentary (actually produced for the single-disc release), a trailer gallery, and the excellent feature-length documentary covering all the classic Universal monsters.

A new documentary on makeup artist Jack Pierce is a welcome addition, though at 23 minutes, feels a bit rushed.  Less impressive is the even shorter featurette on the evolution of the Mummy character, which jumps from the 1940's sequels to the 1999 remake with Brendan Fraser, ignoring many other good and bad interpretations along the way.  The set also includes a free ticket to see the latest modern-day installment, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.  I haven't seen it, but I'm assuming it's just as full of empty-headed thrills as its predecessors.  Anybody want a free ticket?

I'd recommend this set to all die-hard Universal Monsters fans.  But if you already have the film on DVD, you might want to consider whether the handful of new material is worth your money.",1216339200,30,3222,5.035849056603774
65054,5,0783234287,"This is not a review, but a question- Is there any difference between this version of the mummy or either of the other versions that Universal has released(the original in 2001, and the Legacy released a few years ago).

 I'm about to buy this and basically want to know if there's any reason to",1215734400,6,400,4.7
65055,5,0783234287,"The Mummy is one of the great horror films from the early days of sound pictures. It began with an excellent story by Nina Wilcox Putnam and Richard Schayer. It was a mystery and adventure set in the exotic location of Egypt, a present day romance in a tug of war with a supernatural love story. The results are a screen classic.

The story opens at a dig by the British Museum in 1921 as Sir Joseph Whemple (Arthur Bryon) and his team uncover an ancient sarcophagus. It becomes clear, however, that there is something quite different and disturbing about the mummy inside. His name was Imhotep, a High Priest, and the sacred spells etched into his coffin meant to make his journey to the afterlife smooth have been scratched out. And rather than being embalmed as was the custom in ancient Egypt, he was buried alive!

A small casket is also found with him that warns of death for anyone opening it. It seems it contains the ancient scrolls of the Egyptian god Isis, which hold the key to the afterlife. Try as he may, and in spite of warnings about the curse and its power from Dr. Muller (Edward van Sloan), Sir Joseph's assistant Ralph (Bramwell Fletcher) not only opens the small casket, but whispers the ancient Egyptian words of the scroll inside, bringing Imhotep back to life. Ralph Norton goes insane and Imhotep disappears.

Eleven years later, in 1932, a new field expedition of the British Museum headed by Frank Whemple, Sir Joseph's son, is led by a tall and stiff Egyptian with hypnotic eyes named Ardeth Bay (Boris Karloff) to the tomb of an ancient princess. There are equally dire markers surrounding her resting place, the Seals of Seven Jackels from over 3,700 years prior left as a warning to all who enter.

A battle of wills ensues for the love of big-eyed and beautiful Helen Grosvernor (Zita Johann) between Frank and Ardeth Bay/Imhotep as Imhotep wants to use the scrolls to bring back Princess Anck-Es-En-Amon from the dead and give her Helen's soul. Imhotep's spell is poweful, but perhaps not as strong as Frank and Helen's love for each other. And one must not forget how Isis feels about Imhotep's past and present transgressions against ancient things held sacred.

This is old-fashioned fun in every sense of the word. It does not seem creaky at all but is very entertaining, director Karl Freund keeping this Carl Laemmle Jr. production moving along at a nice pace. Karloff, Manners and Zita Johann are especially good in creating a memorable film that began the legend we all have come to know as, The Mummy. A true classic of the genre.",1212364800,7,2573,4.683628318584071
65056,5,0783234287,"If you prefer your horror the old-fashioned way with atmosphere, implication, and imagination versus explicit special effects, this is your kind of movie. Everyone already knows the tale, and everyone has already seen the movie. It is worth ownng though. It was made in the precode era when horror movies could still have a dash of the shocking. Plus movies were still learning to talk, so much experimentation could go on. The director of ""The Mummy"", Karl Freund, had worked with Fritz Lang and so hints of German expressionism can be seen in this film as well. The year before, ""Frankenstein"" had made Boris Karloff a star at age 44. It is here Karloff gets to use the power of speech to add to his presence in horror films.

65057,4,0783234287,"Imhotep (Boris Karloff) is found in his coffin with the spells to guide him to the underworld scratched off. He was buried alive for attempting to bring his true love Anuksunamun back from the dead. Archaeologists take interest in this strange find, and one's curiosity gets the best of him when he begins to read the ancient scroll that brings mummies back to life. Of course, the revivication brings about death for those involved. The mummy's long-buried love is still on his mind, so he does all he can to find her body and the modern equivalent to her (Zita Johann) to rekindle thier flame.

The 1920s King Tut discovery was still all the rage when this film was made, so it draws heavily on superstitions about Tuts tomb. The story here is reminicent of the more modern film with the same title, and so much so, it is sometimes jolting to watch. Why? Because despite the similar story, the method with which it is told is completely different. Here, we have absolute restraint and slow progress, whereas the modern version is non-stop action. This movie has basically no humor, but the remake is peppered with it. These descriptions might make this version seem dull and lifeless, but that is absolutely not the case. Its understatedness makes it ominous and leaves the viewer to fill in the gaps. Unfortunately, these differences might make this version far less appealing to modern audiences who have seen the remake, but give it a few tries in order to differentiate the two.",1200873600,2,1484,4.751937984496124

It lacks some of the tension of the likes of Frankenstein in its 'horror' moments, but deserves a lot of credit for being a well thought out (if not quite unusual) story of the time.

 Boris Karloff frames the movie with his calm, almost seductive presence as Prince Imhotep, entrancing the audience as well as the black-haired beauty Helen (Zita Johann) as he lures her to remember her past.  There is no real action sequences (other than the final rush to save Helen) which certainly would have helped the pace along, but the story, dramatic visuals and exceptional acting are more than compelling enough to keep the viewer fixated from beginning to end.",1147392000,12,951,4.745454545454545
65064,5,0783234287,"In 1932 Universal Pictures was the premier horror house. And it's surprising how many of those films (Dracula, Frankenstein, etc.) have survied right up to today, as well as having generated countless sequels and derivative films. In those low budget, black and white days, all a director had to work with was makeup, a well made set, and the skills of the actors. And Universal had one of the best actors in the horror business - Boris Karloff. He was a man whose eerie looks and overwhelming stage present could scare his beautiful co-stars to death, along with more than a few million viewers.

In The Mummy, Karloff had the perfect script for his talents. From his first subtle movements as Imhotep returns to life Karloff's presence dominates the film. No as a monster, but as a man made monstrous by his passions. 3700 years ago he was buried alive for trying to bring princess Ankh-Es-En-Amon back to life. Now an overly curious archeological assistant has read the Scroll of Thoth again and Imhotep is awake and determined to reclaim his mistress. Her soul has migrated to the body of Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann). Helen and those that are trying to protect her are in mortal danger.

Karloff manages to play Imhotep as both terrible and sympathetic. Imhotep is, after all, a man who has lost the love of his life, and is in danger of losing her again. Behind the makeup Karloff manages to project both his fury and the infinite tragedy of his fate. Zita Johann, a stage actress of some note at that time, does an excellent job of having two personalities in one body. For each she displays a full range of emotions and gestures.

Our taste in horror has changed radically over the years (remember the latest remake of The Mummy or Friday the 13th?) but this film with its honest values and close scripting still can stand on its own. It has its subtleties and is lotal to its characters. The sets are excellent and Karl Freund's camera work is compelling. In many ways this film deserves credit as one of those defining moments in US filmography.",1139616000,2,2056,4.658402203856749

The ancient sarcophagus was unearthed from its tomb anf taken to England, which is seen as a terrible blasphemy, and the inevitable Curse begins to unfold.

The Mummy is reminiscient of the actual story of ""Iye"" {pronounced ""eye""}, whose tenacious deceit brought him the Pharaoh's title for a time, after the murder of Tutenkamun and whtat would have been his Princess. The Egyptian is determined to kill the Anthropologist and almost succeeds through the Mummy, but the monster is distracted by the beauty of his Grand daughter {I will attest to her exquisiteness}, who reminds him of the beauty of the ancient princess. Twice her beauty thwarts the elimination of the Archeologist, until the Mummy finally takes her up in classic style, and runs off with her down to the swamp {romantic in an Addams sort of way}, where he is summarily destroyed.

It was actually quite a romantic scenario which brought the Mummy nigh. He was determined, in his original priestly mortal form, to bring his love back from the dead - so he stole away into her tombwhere the embalming process was already under way, and uttered the Word of Spell , but was found out by the Elder Priests, who then sentenced him to be sealed up alive in the sarcophagus to be her guardian for all time.

am /not/ reviewing the DVD. -J.]
It is only recently that I was treated to my first two viewings of this great movie, and I have to say that I wish I'd seen it years earlier. It has wonderful production qualities. The lighting is fantastic in evoking mood, the sets exotic but believable, and the costumes I think are also worth mentioning. I enjoyed the camera work, direction and performances of the entire cast-- all cooperate very well to create a fantastic swell of mood and terrific range of emotional color.
Above all, though, shines the magnificence of Boris Karloff. This is the the first movie I ever saw him in, and it made me an immediate convert. He has so little to work with and does so much that his performance radiates feeling
and makes the movie. Do not think for a moment of the enjoyably campy and entertaining flicks starring Brendan Fraiser (also a talented actor with a range well beyond comedy, see ""Gods and Monsters"")-- nor think of your run of the mill horror flick. Karloff's Mummy is gripped by pathos, cursed, so in love that he thinks of nothing else, and wrenchingly tortured inside by his own evil and depthless but ultimately selfish love; he believes in this love so much that he has sacrificed everything for it, even his life. He might also be willing to sacrifice the innocent even for just a kiss from his long-dead beloved's spirit, no matter who must pay the toll.
All of these things come through somehow. Perhaps it's in the eyes? Perhaps the way he commands the screen with his huge, strange body? It's more than any of these things, I was blown away.

65072,5,0783234287,"The monsters unleashed by Universal Pictures across the screens of America in the 1930s left an indelible impression on the American psyche that will never be forgotten, and The Mummy stands among the most memorable of all those classic monster movies.  Boris Karloff simply is The Mummy, defining the role for all generations to come.  Don't think he's just sleepwalking around in bandages, either; no, while he may be the prototypical mummy, he is not the hunk of animated flesh that his successors all seemed to turn into.  Karloff in fact gives an impressive dramatic performance in this role.  The action begins in 1922, when British Egyptologists Dr. Muller (Edward Van Sloan) and Dr. Whemple (Arthur Byron) make a potentially incredible discovery underneath the sands of Egypt.  They soon identify a mummy they have recovered intact as Imhotep, but they know this is no ordinary mummy because he was not embalmed, there is evidence of his having struggled within his all-encompassing bandages, and the blessings designed to protect his voyage to the afterlife were removed before he was buried.  Along with Imhotep the explorers find an intriguing box, one that carries a dire message for those who would open it.  While Dr. Muller tries to convince Dr. Whemple to heed the curse and leave the box unopened, their younger associate gives in to his temptation, discovers a scroll inside, and reads from it.  Hereby is Imhotep brought back to life, and the mummy shuffles off into the desert.
There is no news of Imhotep for years, and Dr. Whemple returns home vowing never to return or to speak of what he knows.  Ten years later, though, his son (with a little help from a mysterious Egyptian named Ardath Bey) makes a fabulous find of his own underneath the sands, the grave and mummy of the Egyptian princess Anckesen-Amon, and so the elder Egyptologist returns to Egypt.  As luck would have it, the young Dr. Whemple falls in love with Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann) a half-Egyptian girl who turns out to have a strong connection to the newly discovered mummified princess who, it turns out, just so happens to have been the object of Imhotep's love and sacrifice.  The mummy, completely human in appearance now, works to raise his love from the dead with the aid of the Scroll of Thoth, and it is up to young Dr. Whemple and Dr. Muller to safeguard Helen from a fate seemingly ordained millennia ago.
The most interesting thing about this movie is the fact that the mummy only appears in the traditional, caricatured apparel of rotting old bandages at the very beginning, after which point he takes the form of a man - an eccentric one with captivatingly powerful eyes and supernatural powers, but a man nonetheless.  After a spooky beginning, the movie eventually takes a detour into romance and melodrama and never fully recovers its steam.  While Karloff could appear quite menacing and malevolent, he is hardly the stuff nightmares are made of.  I think the story is a little weak in the last stages, but this is still a five-star film based on its fame, its immense influence on the genre, and its overall quality; for a film from 1932, this print is simply amazing in both its audio and visual quality.  And, though I need not say this again, Boris Karloff gives a subtle, captivating performance as Imhotep.",1064016000,5,3324,4.827464788732394
65073,5,0783234287,"I'm not entirely sure why, but much as I enjoy all of the Universal horror classics, for me ""The Mummy"" is just far and away the best, and a good part of that opinion *may* be down to Boris Karloff's superbly understated performance.
Having made the first Frankenstein film only the year before (1931) - at which time he appeared halfway down the cast list simply as ""?"" - by the time he came to make ""The Mummy"" he had been promoted to the spot ABOVE the title, as ""Karloff the Uncanny"".  (This would have been less memorable had it not been for the fact that Karloff was actually an Englishman, and his real name was William Pratt.  A number of genuine emigres from Eastern Europe were working in Hollywood at this time, and it was quite usual for them to be credited without any forename.)
As to the film itself, it is important to remember that it was made at a time when TV didn't exist, and a car chase at 60 mph was hot stuff.  Though the pace may seem slow by today's standards, in its time it was a magnificent example of mounting suspense.  Indeed, considering that it has a running time of only an hour and ten minutes, it actually contains a lot more plot development and characterisation than the average one hour TV programme.
I'm not going to go over the plot here, previous reviewers have already done that justice.  I would, however, congratulate Universal on the excellent package of ""bonus"" material which makes the DVD so attractive even if you already have the film on tape.
There is the almost obligatory sets of stills and posters, plus the original trailer.  What is quite unusual, and says a great deal for Universal's commitment to value, is the specially made background feature ""Mummy Dearest"" (a title borrowed from a rather bitter biography of Joan Crawford by her daughter, if I remember correctly), and the full length ""Feature Commentary"" by film historian Paul M. Jensen.
""Mummy Dearest"" is full of interesting insights, including a brief resume of the discovery of King Tutenkhamun's tomb, in Egypt, which created a general fascination with ancient Egypt in both Europe and the USA, and which paved the way for this film.
It certainly explains how the original storyline, about a three  hundred year old Italian mystic, Cagliostro, ended up as film about a 3,700 year old Egyptian priest called Imhotep.
Unlike Tom Weaver's rather high speed commentary on ""The Wolf Man"", Paul Jensen's contribution is a little more measured - but just as interesting in it's own way.
Jensen is equally interested in both the background to the film - actors' previous and subsequent work, etc. - and the actual film making process.  This can seem a little irritating at first, as he seems to be simply describing what you can plainly see for yourself.  But after a very little time we find that Jensen is actually highlighting the film maker's technique to show why the camera was placed 'here' rather than 'there', and how, even in 1932, Karloff and the film's director, Karl Freund, were already masters of the ""less is more"" technique.
So, both for the film and for the excellent package of ""extras"", this is definitely a worthy addition to any classic horror film fan's collection.
Highly recommended.",1046131200,4,3223,4.741071428571429

True to his cinematographer background, director Karl Freund emphasizes presentation over shock value.  Instead of nail-biting suspense, terror slowly develops.

After his terrifying resurrection scene, Karloff sheds the bandages, and poses as Ardath Bey, an expert in ancient Egypt.  His skin is parchment dry, and his eyes glow with supernatural intensity.  He is evil incarnate.  Executed 3700 years ago for vile sacrilege, he rises from the dead after the desecration of the sacred ruins.  Im-ho-tep seeks to contact the spirit of his forbidden love, Princess Akes-se-namun (sp.?).  He finds a woman (Zita Talbot) in modern day Egypt, and believes she is the reincarnated princess.  Im-ho-tep has mesmerizing power.  He bends the Nubian servant (the stony faced Noble Johnson) into a willing slave.  The ancient blood prevails.  Im-ho-tep beckons and the princess can only submit.  Edward Van Sloan plays the academic type that understands Im-ho-tep's motives and methods.  Those who profaned the sacred tomb meet a grim end.

65077,4,0783234287,"Although frequently reinterpreted, the original 1932 THE MUMMY remains the most intriguing film version of a story inspired by both 1920s archeological finds and the 1931 Bela Lugosi DRACULA: when an over-eager archeologist reads an incantation from an ancient scroll, he unexpectedly reanimates a mysterious mummy--who then seeks reunion with the princess for whom he died thousands of years earlier and ultimately finds his ancient love reincarnated in modern-day Egypt.
Less a typical horror film than a gothic romance with an Egyptian setting, THE MUMMY has few special effects of any kind and relies primarily upon atmosphere for impact--and this it has in abundance: although leisurely told, the film possesses a darkly romantic, dreamlike quality that lingers in mind long after the film is over.  With one or two exceptions, the cast plays with remarkable restraint, with Boris Karloff as the resurrected mummy and Zita Johann (a uniquely beautifully actress) standouts in the film.  The sets are quite remarkable, and the scenes in which Karloff permits his reincarnated lover to relive the ancient past are particularly effective.
Kids raised on wham-bam action and special effects films will probably find the original THE MUMMY slow and uninteresting, but the film's high quality and disquieting atmosphere will command the respect of both fans of 1930s horror film and the more discerning viewer.

That image is more Lon Chaney, but here, Boris Karloff is the ancient priest, Im-Ho-Tep, who has come to bring his beloved princess back to life.  He is only wrapped up in this movie briefly, and you do not see him move in the bandages.
An archeological dig for the British Museum has unearthed his grave and has found the mysterious Scroll of Thoth.  This scroll has the power of bringing the dead back to life.  After reading it, a young scientist brings him back to life.  The mummy takes the scroll and leaves.

While Karloff does not evoke the same mix of sympathy and revulsion that made his portrayal of the Frankenstein monster so memorable, he still does a ripping good job at creating a frightening and convincing Im-Ho-Tep/Ardeth Bay. Karloff's performance is enhanced by the work of first-time Director Karl Freund--previously the cinematographer on 1931's DRACULA--who does an excellent job of exploiting both visual composition and off-screen (i.e., implied) thrills to create an atmostpheric horror show. And the contribution of make-up Artist Jack Pierce should not be underrated; he turns Karloff into a believable walking corpse that radiates a sense of death and decay.
Though THE MUMMY is nearly 70 years old, it has aged well. In spite of the lack of the graphic gore that has become commonplace today, the imagery in this film still creates a sense of doom and terror, and Karloff and company are able evoke a true fright that clearly demonstrates why the classic horror flicks are often better and genuinely scarier than those cranked out in the Hollywood mills today.",1001635200,2,1425,5.337777777777778

Ten years lapse between his own resurrection and the finding of the princess's tomb--I was curious to know how the mummy supported himself in the meanwhile, since he had a pretty nice house and had learned to speak British English so well--and he didn't even start out with the proverbial ""clothes"" on his back! Yes, he may exercise mind control from time to time, and even be able to induce heart attacks from a distance, but that was only because meddlesome folks tried to curtail his activities in raising up the princess again--he actually has modest ambitions compared to the later mummy who surrounds himself with an army. I found Karloff's mummy extremely sympathetic and was sorry to realize that he wasn't going to get his heart's desire after all. An especially interesting development is that the young woman who is the princess's reincarnation is quite obviously turned on by Karlloff when she meets him accidentally, even though the men in the movie find him creepy and dryskinned. But let's face it--he's much more intriguing than David Manners, the ""hero"" of the piece.  Why, he can't even figure out a way to save her--she must do so herself by beseeching an ancient Egyptian goddess! Check out Karloff's Mummy for a surprisingly touching performance--a ""mum""mentous achievement!",994377600,3,2054,4.846153846153846
65084,5,0783234287,"This is perhaps Boris Karloff's finest performance.  His resurrected Imhotep is tall & cadaverously thin.  He moves with a carefully stilted walk, as if any misstep would cause his ancient bones to crack and crumble him to the ground.  The finely wrinkled face is still and impassive, the lips barely moving as he speaks in a papery thin whisper of his yearning for his long ago lost love, for whom he has sacrificed everything.  But the eyes burn in that masklike face, the same eyes that stared at us in mute terror at his living entombment.
This is great stuff!  Highly romantic with a marvelous mood and atmosphere, this is a Mummy with class.  The movie has great moments such as the above-mentioned living burial and that unforgettable stare of terror, the insane cackle of the unsuspecting perpetrator of Imhotep's resurrection, Karloff & Johann staring into the pool, and so on.  And, in Zita Johann, Karloff has a beautiful, exotic woman worth loving across centuries.
This is The Mummy for grownups.  The Brendan Fraser version is more for the kids, which is perfectly okay. It's about noise and action.  This Mummy is about subtlety, mood, and eternal desire, and it is a quiet Classic.",986774400,3,1197,4.828431372549019
65085,5,0783234287,"With these words, the viewer is once again seduced by Boris Karloff's amazing ability to bring to life, so to speak, characters that have been long dead.  By 1932, when ""The Mummy"" was released, Universal was the leading Hollywood horror studio.  ""The Mummy"" was ... ahem ... one more nail in a very successful sarcophagus, providing Universal with more acclaim and Karloff with another notch in his already-outstanding cinematic resume.
Now released on DVD as part of the Universal Classic Monster Collection series, ""The Mummy"" reflects the rampant interest in America at the time in all things Egyptian, brought about mainly by the discovery of King Tut's tomb by Howard Carter some 10 years prior.  The supposed curse that was to have been visited upon anyone who disturbed the boy king was even worked into the script of ""The Mummy"" which was, originally, not an Egyptian movie at all but which was based on an historical Italian alchemist/hypnotist who claimed to have lived for centuries.
In the film, the mummy, Im-Ho-Tep (pronounced ""M-Ho-Tep"") is accidentally revived after 3,700 years by a team of British archaeologists.  He was once a priest, buried alive for attempting to revive the vestial virgin whom he loved following her sacrifice.  Alive once more, and now calling himself Ardath Bey, he is looking for his lost love ... and of course, he'll need a living stand-in ...
The ""making-of"" documentary included in ""The Mummy"", entitled ""Mummy Dearest:  A Horror Tradition Unearthed"", is, like all the other documentaries in this series, a delight.  One special feature of this particular documentary details the process used by make-up king Jack Pierce to turn Karloff - who in life was quite a handsome man - into a dried-out corpse.  When one considers - both in the Frankenstein films and ""The Mummy"" - the physical rigors which Karloff endured to bring his gallery of monsters to life, this dedication to craft alone is truly amazing.  From enduring layers of make-up often combined with foul-smelling chemicals, to wearing padded clothing weighing 30 pounds or more, to being wrapped in bandages and accidentally not given a fly through which the actor could relieve himself throughout the day, ""Karloff The Uncanny"" endured all and, as a result, gave us performances unmatched by any actor living today.
The double performance of Zita Johann as both the Egyptian princess and her modern-day character is nuanced and blends perfectly with Karloff's measured emotion, which evokes a romantic aura in his character that makes him seem more sympathetic than evil.
Feature Commentary by film historian Paul Jensen provides a treasure chest of trivia for horror film buffs and Karloff devotees, as do the original trailers and cast and filmmaker's biographies included in the DVD's extra goodies.

65086,4,0783234287,"I have to admit, I saw the 1999 version first, which I did not think was bad. It wasn't until recently that I saw this earlier film along with several other Universal horror classics. First I would like to say that to compare this version with the 1999 version is a mistake, I have seen several remakes of old movies in the last ten years and it seems to me that they should not be compared on the same scale, even when it is a rehash of the same story. I thought Karloff did a wonderful job on this picture. It was a good idea not having him walk around in bandages the whole time and this one was certainly superior to the many sequels that  followed it. Not as much of a favorite to me as Dracula or bride of Frankenstein, but then I'm more of a Lugosi Fan than a Karloff one, but nonetheless.

65089,5,0783234287,"The traditional image of 'mummy' films is of a heavily bandaged man, arms outstretched, walking slowly towards his victims (and still managing to catch them). Not in this movie! Universal's 1932 chiller is way above any  other mummy film you have seen - including the quartet of 'Kharis' films of  the 1940s. Right from the opening titles we are presented with a stylish,  well acted, beautifully photographed masterpiece of a horror film.  Amazingly, given the film's title, Boris Karloff only appears in bandages  for a brief period at the beginning of the movie, and even then only from  the waist up. But such is the quality of the writing and the expert  direction of Karl Freund, the story remains riveting throughout. Zita  Johann also deserves special mention for her portrayal of Helen Grosvenor,  she is a real asset to the film. As for the DVD, picture quality is  exceptionally crisp and clean. I doubt if a significantly better print will  ever surface. In keeping with the other Universal Classic Monster  Collection DVDs the disc contains a trailer, cast & crew bios,  production notes, photographs and a well put together documentary. The only  slight let down is Paul M Jensen's commentary. Though informative, it is  not as conversational or easy going as some of the other Universal DVDs.

Karloff  and Jack Pierce spent hours and hours with make up sessions and we only see  the mummified mummy for a quick minute or two! However, the real terror and  chills comes from Karloff's performance as the unmummified revived Ardeth  Bey who is just as menacing as the ""mummy"".

65091,4,0783234287,"It is hard to believe that if Bela Lugosi would not have been so proud, he would have played 'Frankenstein' back in 1931 and Boris Karloff may never have been 'discovered'.  In this movie he is at his creepy best;  that  unforgettable drawling, lisping, well enunciated voice (how a Mummy from  ancient Egypt got a slight British accent we are best off not to ask),  along with a great make-up job by Jack Pierce, make this one of his best  (of many) bogey-man performances.  The rest of the cast is adequate,  although David Manners, who was the romantic lead in several of these  Universal classic horror films of the early '30s, is about as colorless of  a 'hero' as you could hope for.  A good creative story with elements of  'Dracula' but is largely original.  Features one of the most eerie scenes  in movie history, early in the film (and without background music), where a  bandaged up Boris sloooooowwllly wakes up from a 3700 year nap and greets  poor unsuspecting Bramwell Fletcher rather rudely.....a great example of a  scene that scares without shocking (and one that most of today's  slasher-flick film makers should watch and take notes on!).  Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!",958867200,3,1179,4.834170854271357
65092,5,0783234287,"Despite its stylized dialogue and the unbelievability of many of its individual scenes, THE MUMMY owes its ultimate success to Freund's skillful direction and Karloff's remarkable two-part characterization. In terms of its basic story costruction, the film suffers somewhat from an overly convoluted plot and from a somewhat unsatisfying conclusion, but  THE MUMMY is a potent film that imparts a feeling of being suspended in time.  Karloff, firmly establishing himself as Lon Chaney's successor, gives a hypnotically compelling performance (and very different from his interpretation of Frankenstein's Monster!).  Karloff seems to glide rather than walk, and his facial muscles never move.  Only his eyes express his profound inner turmoil, as in the burial scene, when the tapes are drawn across his mouth and nose, leaving open his wild eyes to face the prospect of eternal sleep.  This brilliant make-up job done by the genius make-up artist Jack Pierce took an incredible EIGHT hours to apply!  Ingeniously,  Pierce literally cooked the cloth to give the illusion of having rotted away centuries ago.  Although the film addresses the conflict between death and immortality and the idea that one must live out his destiny, it is, at its purest level, a love story; Karloff's obsessive devotion, the script suggests, is a sickness that only love can bring.  Karloff tells Johann ""All this I endured for thee"", reflecting a timeless belief in the curative powers of love. The elusive Hungarian actress (she played on Broadway with Clark Gable in the twenties) Zita Johann does quite well as Helen; her features were unusual and exotically striking;  she was quite believable in her role as a part Egyptian.  This 1932 movie is still a stunner with many classic scenes which I'm not going to reveal!",958435200,,1801,5.197231833910035
65093,4,0783234287,"Boris Karloff holds an ancient and mysterious power in this wonderful template for all the mummy movies that have followed.
Considering that movie styles, audience tastes and demands and cinema technology have moved  light years from the 1930s, it is intriguing that Karlof's mummy is as  rivetting in its own way as the 1999 version is in its.
It's intriguing  to note that the 1999 version still contains flashbacks to the Karlof one -  ""just a silly Eastern superstition"" is one line contained in  both. The makers of the 1999 version have honoured Karlof, and that is  great to see.
In many respects, it's probably wrong to  ""compare"" the two. it's like comparing apples with oranges.  However, the fact that the modern Imhotep and his crew have sparked renewed  interest in Karlof's Imphotep is a gracious and wonderful result; as well  as the sincerest form of flattery.
When Karlof walked before the camera,  he was working within a genre that owed more to stage than cinema; a time  when cinema was still finding its own methods of expression. However,  having said that, Karlof's presence - particularly the heavily shadowed  close-ups and his sheer power even given the primitive cinematography he  had to work with - still claims for him the place as the best Imhotep. He  had no special effects to back him up; he could not even kill someone on  camera because of the censorship rules of the time; yet he still exudes a  knock-out force.
Now, in 2000, he still does. That, truly, is ""the  power of ages"".",958089600,,1516,4.7615384615384615
65094,5,0783234287,"The 1931 ""Mummy"" should be a lesson to film studios that less is definitely more. The hypnotic, and almost hallucinogetic atmosphere takes hold of you from the start and never lets up for a moment. Karloff's  understated performance is a timeless classic!  Forget the recent (and  forgettable) remake with its ""eye-popping special effects"" and  Dolby digital sound thundering away at you...the opening moments of the  1931 version will haunt you for the rest of your life (that is, unless  you're one of the MTV generation who needs a constant barrage of explosive  and restless  outside stimuli to get through to you....)!",955584000,2,623,5.099009900990099

65096,5,0783234287,"In all of the history of cinema there has never been a movie quite like this one.  Followed by four other Universal ""mummy"" movies (not counting ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET THE MUMMY) that bear little resemblance  to the original, this film stands out as an excellent example of early  sound horror.  But it is much more than that.
The story of a 3,200 year  old Egyptian who is looking for the reincarnation of the true love of his  life, it combines an incredible love story with enough goose bumps to  frighten a ghost.  It's power to scare is extremely subtle.  But this is a  character that is brought back to life against his will.  He is forced to  exist in a time other than his own.  As the story unfolds the audience  understands that the character's only choice while he is there is to search  for his long lost mate.  Because of that, the tale is both scary and sad.
The hypnotic appeal of the title character and story is due almost  entirely to it's star.  Anyone thinking that Boris Karloff could not have  played Dracula need only watch this movie.  The way the versatile actor  uses his eyes and voice to seduce the beautiful Zita Johann (as his  romantic interest) is not unlike the technique employed by many of the  actors who have played the Count.  Even the documentary on the DVD makes  many comparisons between the two characters.  And, as usual, Boris manages  to inject many other dimensions into his characterization.  There are not  many images in cinema that are as powerful as that last glimpse of Karloff  as he is about to be completely wrapped in the bandages that will seal his  doom.  The reawakening of Im-Ho-Tep at the beginning of the film is created  without one note of music in the backround.  You are riveted to the screen  as you watch the character's eyes slowly open.  A nail biting sequence if  ever there was one.  But nowhere is Mr. Karloff's performance more  effective than in the flashback sequence.  With his expressive eyes and  face he makes you feel sympathy for his character as his beloved passes  away.  You get the feeling that Im-Ho-Tep will never be the same  again.
Backed by a solid supporting cast headed by the beautiful Zita  Johann as Helen Grovesnor, Karloff is in good company.  Miss Johann and  Boris' scenes are beautifully handled.  And with Karloff's powerful but  subdued acting, it's easy to see how she could be so completely and totally  charmed.  Edward Van Sloan does yeoman service in yet another older and  wiser character who always seems to be giving out advise to the younger  hero, in this film played by David Manners.  Manners cuts a  very appealing  figure (as he did in DRACULA) as the hopeful but confused romantic lead.  But the best supporting performance in the film belongs to Bramwell  Fletcher.  After having defied the curse by opening the casket containing  the dreaded Scroll of Thoth, Boris reawakens after a long sleep to drive  Fletcher's character completely insane.  The disturbed laughter followed by  the camera's pan to the exit as the trail of Karloff's bandages disappear  through the door will be etched in your memory for a long  time.
Cinematographer Karl Freund does well in his first credited job of  director.  Obviously his work in Germany with famous directors such as  Fritz Lang (METROPOLIS, M), helped him to create an atmosphere that is most  unusual indeed.  There are frightening moments in this film to be sure, but  they are no more effective than the moments of romance and adoration  conveyed by Karloff and Zohann.  Miss Zohann's performance is all the more  astounding considering the fact that she didn't get along with Freund.  The  documentary and commentary paint a colorful picture of the nearly sadistic  treatment Freund gave to his leading lady.  It makes one understand a  little better why Zohann didn't do many other films.
MCA has done a great  job restoring yet another Universal classic for Digital Video Disc  distribution.  The film looks brand new.  The images practically jump out  of the screen at the viewer.  The usual documentary, commentary and photo  collection are welcome additions.  The commentary is particularly  interesting, but the typical (for these films) dry delivery once again mar  the proceedings.
But, as in the other four classic Universal  ""monster"" movies, it's the film itself that is the meat of the  package.  And THE MUMMY is one of the best of it's kind, regardless of how  uncommon that kind may be.  Thanks largely to Boris Karloff's performance  and this DVD restoration of it the film will hopefully live on another  3,200 years!  Or at least one can hope!",953769600,10,4630,4.783163265306122

65098,4,0783234287,"My favorite film of all time is the 1999 version of ""The Mummy,"" and sinse long before that came out, I've known of Boris Karloff's 1932 creature feature.  But, I always figured it was another one of those  bandage wrapped, slow moving - and frankly very stupid ""mummy""  movies. So I stayed away. Then, I saw the new version on the first day of  release (May 7th) and rushed out of the theater knowing I must see the old  version. Instead of renting it, I just bought it - and it was superb! The  basic story elements are the same in both versions, but instead of the  lavish desert settings, huge sets and breathtaking visual effects of the  Stephen Sommers version, director Karl Fruend's 30's film relies on mood  and atmousphere to chill you to the bone - which it does very well. Boris  Karloff plays Imhotep, whom in his native Egypt (3,700 years ago) was  buried alive for trying to raise his love Anck-Su-Namun (Zita Johann) from  the dead. Flash forward to 1932 were a british team of archeologists dig up  his remains and accidentaly revive him. Cleaning himself up, Imhotep prowls  around modern Cairo under the alias Ardath Bey, trying to find the  reincarnated soul of his past lover. He does so in Helen Grovesenor (also  Johann), but his plans might be in trouble as Helen's gurdian Muller  (Edward Van Sloan) and her boyfriend Frank Whemple (David Manners, both  from Universal's earlier horror film ""Dracula"") will stop at  nothing to save her. As for power, Boris Karloff is a far cry from Arnold  Vosloo's running, fighting Imhotep in the '99 version - but is pretty good  with some supernatural Darth Vader like telepethy. This is surley one of  the most romantic horror films, as one in some way or another feels sorry  for Imhotep, as he looks longingly into the eyes of his mummified  girlfriend, but the film does manage to generate a few good scares, because  Imhotep is no softey, when you look in HIS eyes you'll see death and  destruction. And so while the 1999 ""Mummy"" is my favorite film,  the 1932 version proves that in Hollywood's golden age, filmmaker's really  knew what they were doing.",951782400,18,2122,4.662162162162162
