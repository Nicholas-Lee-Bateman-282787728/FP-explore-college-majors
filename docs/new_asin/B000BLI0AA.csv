8088601,4,B000BLI0AA,"This is an excellent film set in the 1940s about twin sisters who are separated when they are young, one is adopted by a wealthy family in Holland, the other by a poor Catholic farmer in Germany. The film shows the different trajectories the girls' lives take based on their upbringing. The women meet up as adults and discover why they have not spoken in years. Overall it's an excellent film about WWII which examines the personal impact of the war.",1141171200,,451,4.580246913580247
