7920522,5,B00004LMOO,Nice to get an easy refresher course at home or if your kids' teacher isn't that fun or doesn't explain math in a way that works for your kids -- use this program.,1391212800,,163,3.9696969696969697
7920523,5,B00004LMOO,"My children like to watch these, because they are entertaining, and they learn with them. We haven't looked at the trigonmetry or pre-calculus yet (my children are a bit young for these), but I'm sure they'll like them.",1365379200,,219,4.7894736842105265
7920524,4,B00004LMOO,"I find the Standard Deviants to be a great review of math skills.  They present the information in a fun, yet educational way.  I used the Caculus video years ago for a personal review.  I purchased this to use with my students in an AIS math class.  I decided not to use it because it did not present the concepts in a way that I felt would be accurate and in depth enough for the students who struggle with math.  I would use this with students who had a more solid conceptual understanding.",1164240000,,493,4.258064516129032
7920525,5,B00004LMOO,"My son watched the algebra 1 dvd many times, and even in preference to cartoons on a sick day.  He learned to solve all of the problems presented on the interactive quizes laughing out loud all the while.  I have a degree in math, and have worked in math intensive engineering work for many years, and I am impressed with the intuitive and amusing treatment of polynomials, definitions of functions, relations, solving equations, and many vocabulary terms the kids need.  It is all too rare that a group can make good math this fun.  I hope that the Standard Deviants will do many more.  Buy this for your kids!",973814400,,611,4.568807339449541
