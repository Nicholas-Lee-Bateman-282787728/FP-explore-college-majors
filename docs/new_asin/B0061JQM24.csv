It's a really well made set~ I've spent hours looking through the videos and reliving great memories. The set comes with a lyric booklet in kanji for every song, as well as a few small photos from that era of song release(s).

With this recent set release the number of dvd boxes was cut down from 5 years ago to make the set cheaper(I think). There are 3 dvd boxes(instead of the original 6 boxes from years ago) with two dvds in each(making six dvds total). There are also special features, but they are in Japanese without subtitles of course.

Sidenote, if you do not have a dvd player for region 2 dvds, the program vlc media player works just fine. I've been using it for years to play dvd's from other regions(mostly jpop concerts/mvs, uk tv shows ect) without needing to change the region on my laptop or buying a specialized dvd player.

Download vlc media player, it's freeware and can be found in a simple google search. Afterwards, just put the dvd in, make sure to exit out of the prompts of your computer asking you to change the region and then open vlc media player. Go to media>open file and then click on the dvd. You have to wait a bit before the menu opens up. The first time I did this it took a few minutes so you have to be a bit patient. But then the dvd menu opens up and you can enjoy~",1472515200,,1445,4.266423357664234

Masao Hirota. For his help and ideas I am forever indebeted

As this is a compilation of the very best Ayumi Hamasaki has done over the past 13+ years, and as the awards speak about the quality and popularity of the body of her work,  I post the awards she has received durnig this period as a review.

 Who could better teastify to her art than the professiuonals in her field??

Because these are video clips of her performing it is important to note here that she has made 5 of the 20 most expensive music videos ever made, worldwide, anywhere!!

Treat yourself to a real experience here. This collection is selling out and will not be re-pressed in the forseeable future.
This singer, part waif, part cheerleader, all woman is a world class artist!!

P.S. She removed herself from all awards consideration to allow up and coming new stars to gain recognition!!!!
