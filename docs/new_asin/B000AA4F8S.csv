8076621,5,B000AA4F8S,"This movie was smart, funny, and easy to relate to.  Some of the humor was subtle, some of it laugh-out-loud funny.  It dealt with the subject of aging and beauty without being patronizing or maudlin.  Definitely not a typical Hollywood movie.  I thought it was well-cast and well-executed.  I would love to see Brooke Adams in more movies.",1510444800,,340,4.793103448275862

8076623,5,B000AA4F8S,"I said to myself, ""OK, brave topic to tackle; got good reviews at film fest; will give a try"". My advice to the reader, hang on! It's got one twist followed by a curve then several ""wow, what nexts"" ... a yummy delight! Yep, lots of intelligent and artsy smarts went into this light, well done, romance-comedy-drama. Personally, I want to see more from each member of this crew and cast?",1374710400,,387,4.464788732394366
8076624,5,B000AA4F8S,"Tony Shalhoub shows his directing talent in this movie, as well as his  stickler for details that make things true.  Great acting, Brooke Adams is so real, as are all the actors, especially the teenager, Eva Amurri. The mother daughter relationship is touching and frustrating and loving, as probably all mother daughter relationships are.  Both do their parts as real human beings.  It ought to get out into theatres, it would appeal to many small venues, I think. I had never heard of it before just checking again into the career of Tony Shalhoub, who I love as MONK.  Finding more movies with him has been really enjoyable.  All in all, recommend this movie to anyone interested in enjoying what makes us all human, especially about our appearances!",1319328000,,753,4.84375
8076625,3,B000AA4F8S,The movie wasn't too bad. Was expecting it to be a bit more exciting. Tony Shahloub is a great actor and his wife Brooke Adams isn't to bad.,1286582400,,140,4.035714285714286
8076626,4,B000AA4F8S,"I became interested in seeing Made-Up after discovering the remarkable series, MONK, getting seasons 1-6 on DVD, and then becoming ensorcelled by the dense and nuanced art of Tony Shalhoub.  He directed this film on a no money budget and also makes a pivotal cameo appearance.

The work was originally written by his sister-in-law for the stage and she co-stars in the film with her sister, Mr. Schalhoub's wife, Brooke Adams.  Ms. Adams has an impressive and unconventional CV in dance, theater and film.

Made-Up is meant to be a satire of fading physical beauty, and, typical of the genre, has serious, socio-cultural underpinnings.

It's original, diverting, often amusing, but Mr. Shalhoub's visual & ""musical"" intuition... nuclear in a director, seemed compromised by his focus on minutae, and, I believe, a leeeetle too much thinking...not unlike---OMG--- Adrian Monk!

I was MORE disappointed by what felt a lack of erotic charge-- erotic ""dance""--- building between Mr. Shalhoub's cameo character who, after a sometimes riotous series of mishaps, becomes involved with the character played by his wife and reawakens her confidence & lifeforce.

Still, I would recommend the film, since, even as it falters, it still pulses with originality, ambition, and the earnest efforts of a gifted and unconventional collective of artists.  That they are mostly related by  marriage, blood, and also friendship, i.e., Gary Sinese and a serendipitous choice of Susan Sarandon's then teenage daughter to play Ms. Adams' screen daughter is also interesting. Bottom line: I would take it over bloated, obscenely budgeted, cliched commercial releases any day of the week.

The bonus material on the DVD, while no way Kosher to include in a review, added dimension: as usual, the voice over commentary version of the film by the principals, not to mention, footage of Mr. Shalhoub, Ms. Adams and the author, her sister, in the studio, shown discussing the narration just after they completed it.

There was one luminous moment in the latter when Ms. Adams makes a single, ingenuous, palpably authentic gesture of adoration toward her husband. It immediately made me wistful, wishing its essence had marked the film itself.",1228089600,4,2214,5.243626062322946
8076627,3,B000AA4F8S,"I'm a big fan of Brooke Adams and Eva Amurri, and this film certainly showcases their charms.  The basic question the film explores, society's obsession with women looking youthful, is certainly worthy of consideration and is seen from some interesting angles.  Still, I found the film hard to sit and watch (so I managed to get lots of laundry folded) because the dialogue just wasn't tight.  Much of it sounded ad-libbed and it was for the most part lugubrious, dull, and lacking in credibility.  A few of the monologues by the woman who plays the trophy wife were amusingly fatuous, but that was about the extent of the wit and humor.  The sound track could definitely have benefited from more music.  One thing I did very much enjoy was the art direction, particularly the paintings of Edith Vonnegut.  I'm puzzled by the other three rave reviews and find it perhaps revealing that for two of the other reviewers, this is the only item they have reviewed.",1223683200,,959,4.740963855421687
8076628,5,B000AA4F8S,Brooke Adams and Tony Shalhoub shine in this fantastic film about a woman's (Adams) reconciliation with mid-life. Expertly written by Lynn Adams and directed by Shalhoub. Brooke Adams performance is her best ever and is NOT to be missed.,1135209600,,237,5.102564102564102
8076629,5,B000AA4F8S,"Unless you were lucky enough to see this movie at one of the film festivals (for which it won several awards!) or a few select cities you missed out on a truly enjoyable film. But here's your chance to finally see and own a movie that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. True it's billed toward the middle age viewer, but I am in my thirties and loved it, as well as many of my friends and family. The actors performances are great, and it's nice to see Brooke Adams back on screen. Written by Lynne Adams and Directed by Tony Shalhoub both of whom also co-star, make this film a winner.",1126396800,6,589,4.175438596491228
8076630,5,B000AA4F8S,"MADE-UP is a delightfully funny mockumentary, which, though it may be geared primarily for older audiences, is a movie that everyone will enjoy (I am a 19 year old guy and I thought the movie was hilarious). Brooke Adams gives a terrific performance in the lead, and the supporting cast (Brooke's real-life sister Lynne playing her sister in the movie, actress Eva Amurri as Brooke's daughter, and Tony Shalhoub, Brooke's real-life husband) is equally good. I highly recommend this film. It's a comedy that doesn't resort to low-brow or off-color humor for its jokes, and strikes a familiar chord with people of all ages and backgrounds.",1125532800,6,637,5.018867924528302
