Overall: 2014 is shaping up to be one of the best years for WWE DVD releases in a long, long time. For years, fans have requested the company release a Paul Heyman DVD set and finally for the first time ever, we will be treated to the inside scoop on the mastermind behind ECW and arguably the greatest manager in pro wrestling history. Throughout this set, we'll get to hear interviews from some of Heyman's former ECW employees, peers, and closest friends. From Raven to Tommy Dreamer to Vince McMahon, all the way down to Brock Lesnar, you'll hear all their thoughts and stories on the most ingenious person in wrestling of this decade and the last. This may very well be the most demanded and popular DVD since their 2012 Attitude Era DVD release. Overall, if you're a Paul Heyman fan, then you obviously need to pre-order/buy this DVD and make it part of your collection",1401926400,3,5025,4.894417475728155

6358324,5,B00JHH21AE,"If you want to hear the incredible (and sometimes, even true!) story of Paul Heyman, look no further. Even if you never watch any of the promos included on this set (ranging from JCP in the 80's up to modern WWE) you will have been greatly entertained. Told by the man himself, Heyman weaves together too many entertaining tales to recount, and even though most of the stories are full of half truths and omissions (and a few outright lies) the fact that HE believes them so earnestly, and tells them so passionately makes the accuracy of the stories moot. For any fan who wants to learn more about one of the true mad geniuses of the pro wrestling world, this blu ray is a must own.",1442275200,,683,4.3858267716535435

It was so much fun to watch almost 30 years of Heyman highlights, going all the way back to when he managed Tommy Rich and Austin Idol against Tommy Rich.  Heyman is a master of this business, and hearing his thoughts on his career was fascinating.  If you're a Heyman guy, this is a must-watch.",1424390400,,452,4.113636363636363

6358365,5,B00JHH21AE,Paul Heyman is the greatest talker in the business! This DVD clearly the best WWE video of the year.,1421280000,,100,4.315789473684211
6358366,5,B00JHH21AE,"Ok, one of the best biographies dvds that WWE has produce. you can actually feel that Paul Heyman had something to do when putting together the DVD. There are some things that you wouldn't think wwe would allow Paul and other to say, but they there are. Like Paul Heyman's Pipe bomb about why CM Punk left. That segment of Raw in chicago, has never air again. But its full and unedited here in this DVD",1420675200,,402,4.302631578947368
6358367,4,B00JHH21AE,I found the documentary intriging and was hooked and listened from the start of the ecw talk all the way till the now. If you don't like alot of talking and want action/matches this probally won't be the wwe dvd for you. It makes for a diffrent wwe dvd doctumentary experience. This Paul Heyman guy recomends this dvd for other Paul Heyman guys.,1420502400,,345,4.492063492063492
6358368,5,B00JHH21AE,"great product, great price, would order again",1420329600,,45,5.571428571428571
6358369,4,B00JHH21AE,"Interesting to learn how Heyman got in the business.  In my opinion he's the second greatest manager of all time, of course, Bobby Heenan will remain #1 for along time.  Paul's always been a great talker, and a great bad guy, it was nice to see his beginnings in the business and hear how much wresters and others in the industry both admired him and were irritated by him.",1420156800,,373,4.391304347826087
6358370,5,B00JHH21AE,"I'll admit I waited for this bluray for awhile. I didn't really care about Heyman but finally one day it was cheap so I bought it & gave it a look. Wow, this is one of the best WWE produced documentaries in sometime. It's honest, refreshing, & despite a 2 hour run, it doesn't feel much has been wasted. It's raw & feels like WWE let say what he wanted but pulled the plug before he got to wild. The time in ECW was very well done & shed some light on a few topics even though the subject has been beaten to death. The only problem with the set is the McMahons, namely Stephanie McMahon as one reviewer points out. Shane is talked about a lot & I wish they could have gotten him for some comments. Vince well he is a world class BS'er so we know he would have protected the WWE & answered questions very vague. Stephanie is the only one interviewed & you can tell she hates Paul E despite trying to play nice. Other then that, best WWE documentary released on bluray/dvd in 2014. This set also features many of his famous promos & a few matches. Highly recommend getting this one even if your not a fan. I think you'll enjoy it if your a wrestling fan.",1419811200,,1152,4.147321428571429
6358371,5,B00JHH21AE,Such a great look inside Heyman but also the business. Many surprising interviews.,1419724800,,82,5.384615384615385
6358372,5,B00JHH21AE,"This DVD is a must buy for Paul Heyman fans, ECW fans and anyone who considers himself a professional wrestling fan. It is a great interview documentary and Paul Heyman is absolutely fascinating in this DVD.",1419724800,,207,4.777777777777778
6358373,5,B00JHH21AE,This Documentary was awesome,1419292800,,28,6.25
6358374,5,B00JHH21AE,"For some reason, when it's about Paul Heyman and/or ECW, it always ends up being one of WWE's best DVD's and Ladies and Gentlemen My Name is Paul Heyman is another great addition to that list. They interview all of the right people who were involved with Paul Heyman and they give a very raw (no pun intended) and honest look at his life in wrestling.

Whenever I watch shoot interviews with Heyman, it almost feels like I'm watching a mad scientist at work. He is literally a creative genius in the wrestling world. Maybe not the greatest business man but a master at storytelling and character development.

One problem that i have with this DVD is that, while it is over 2 hours long, it still feels really short. Despite watching it for its entire running time, I wanted to see more. Not since the Rise and Fall of ECW have I felt that way about a WWE Biography DVD. Paul Heyman is just so interesting and has such a presence and intelligence about wrestling, that you really want to know more.

Another problem is the interview with Stephanie Mcmahon. Not that it's a bad interview but I would have rather it be Vince Mcmahon interviewed than her. She seems very out of place on the DVD compared to the rest of the people who were interviewed.

So overall, this is the best DVD that WWE has produced in a very long time. A must have for wrestling fans.",1419206400,,1357,4.416

6358376,5,B00JHH21AE,For any avid Wresting or Paul Heyman fan. Learned a lot of things I didn't know about Heyman and the Business. Great Look. I recommend the Blu Ray though as it's packed with extras.,1418601600,,181,4.352941176470588
6358377,4,B00JHH21AE,"I don't buy a lot of videos involving wrestling anymore as I haven't really watched in years.  But I love documentaries.  A great story about a really interesting character and a really interesting time in wrestling.

Pros: Great doc with compelling story telling.

Cons: None of the bonus material that comes with the DVD or bluray.  Real bummer since I heard it was also good.",1417910400,,378,4.753846153846154
6358378,5,B00JHH21AE,"I loved the original ECW so when I Sall this DVD about how Paul got it started and about his life and career I said ""this is a must buy"" I just wish Paul would release his autobiography I'm sure there is a lot he would like to say that he can't while working for the wwe but as I said to myself I will say to any one wanting to buy this DVD it is a must own for any ECW original fan.",1417651200,,383,3.5714285714285716

6358398,5,B00JHH21AE,Great DVD,1415318400,,9,4.0
6358399,5,B00JHH21AE,"Nobody does sports documentaries like HBO 30for30....and WWE.  This one absolutely does not disappoint.  I may be a bit bias considering this is my favorite person (Aside from Bobby Heenan) in all of sports entertainment history, but this doc only reassured my sentiment.

This one explores the entire career arc of Paul Heyman and delves deep into how he broke into the biz. From his photogrphy days, through the rise of ECW and onto WWE.  There were some extremely intriguing stories and from the intro to the credits this doc is as interesting as any of its kind.

Its well worth the time.",1413849600,,592,4.70873786407767
6358400,5,B00JHH21AE,Great DVD.  Probably the greatest DVD from the WWE library for 2014.  Lots of excerpts from all kinds of wrestlers influenced by Paul Heyman and his narration of the biography portion is incredible.  It's great to hear his side of the WCW days.,1413763200,,244,4.627906976744186

I wasn't a Paul Heyman guy before watching this but I now know why so many are and am glad to say that I AM A PAUL HEYMAN GUY!!!. This is one of the most entertaining, insightful, appreciative documentaries that you will ever watch and better than the WWE DVD's I have watched as of late (Attitude Era was 2nd at best).Trust me when I say to you as a life long wrestling fan who watched AWA,NWA,WCW,WWF,WCCW,and the indies, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.

The honesty provided in this documentary is rare. There are stories that are told over and over again and they change as we tend to like to re-write history, but the stories here remain the same as the first time they were told. From Studio 54, WCW, ECW and WWE, this tale of the greatest manager/advocate that is around today is a must have for any wrestling fan. Oh and by the way did you know that his client Brock Lesnar conquered the Undertaker's undefeated streak at WrestleMania, thus making him, the 1, behind the 1, that is the 1 in 21 and 1.",1410134400,,691,4.282442748091603

If your a wrestling fan, if you like finding new things that you didn't know about the life and times of your favorite managers and wrestlers then get this film! Now!  I loved this film from the get go, like I said I always was a Paul Heyman guy from his early days in Memphis, to his AWA days, to his off again on again history with the NWA, ECW, and up until now.  I really loved how the WWE used old footage and behind the scenes moments to tell his story, the Memphis stuff was priceless and it brought back memories of he and Hot Stuff Eddie Gilbert with Tommy Rich and Austin Idol in their war with Jerry Lawler. I loved the old AWA footage, and seeing them talk about a long forgotten tag team called the Motor City Madmen made me the inner kid in me smile.  The was really one of the best dvd's that I've seen chronicling the beginnings of wrestling's greatest speaker to where he is today. The honesty of the wrestlers in their thoughts and opinions were priceless in so that you believed them when they talked about Paul with the good, bad and the ugly.  I could not praise the production anymore.",1409270400,,1191,4.299107142857143
6358458,4,B00JHH21AE,"An honest, and fascinating look at a very...polarizing...figure. The story is compelling; of course you get a few guys that make you wonder why they are on this show (it's expected at this point); and I was very surprised at how honest WWE let this piece be. Criticisms of their shows, and of their creative department are harsh, yet untouched.

It was a compelling, fun, and very educational look at a man who was been on the inside of the business in many different facets, in many different companies, with a very unique perspective of the business.

I cannot recommend this show enough for anybody interested in professional wrestling. It's a phrase that gets thrown around way too often, but this is definitely a 'must watch'.",1409184000,,731,4.7936507936507935

I want to because he has had some of the most strong heel superstars under his management. However, Paul Heyman himself is a genius. He could talk his way out of any situation, make you believe anything he says, and you can't dislike the man one bit. This set (DVD or BluRay) is WELL worth the money. It takes you on a journey of how a 14 year old had a dream... and he made it come true by doing whatever he had to do, saying whatever he had to say, to make it to the top. And he did.

Heyman might not be able to help the actions of the superstars he represents but his actions speak volumes. Witness those actions throughout his career ... you won't be able to stop watching this remarkable set. When I was done watching, I just sat in awe. I had no idea what all he had gone through, and I've been watching him since he came on as Paul E Dangerously. Truly this is one of the best sets that WWE has put out (Next to the Tombstone: History of the Undertaker).

Buy it.
Watch it.
Learn from it.

You won't be disappointed.

Granted, it never covers Mike Awesome's defection with the ECW title to WWE or the controversy of XPW versus ECW, but then again, why would you cover XPW or MIke Awesome?

6358501,5,B00JHH21AE,"During the opening video of this presentation, many names past & present the wrestling industry tried to describe this man in one word which is a pretty difficult task to do but one thing that can't be denied is that he's one of the most influential minds & controversial names in the history of the industry who's life story has been told in parts with it not only being hard to separate fact from faction half of the time along with the fact that he doesn't reflect on his past much because his mentality is to always move forward with life but we finally get the entire story of him here...ladies & gentleman, this man's name is Paul Heyman.  This is one of the most unique presentations done by WWE not just because it's a rarity to do this type of documentary on a talent who didn't make his life in this business through various areas of the business but also utilities footage that is rarely seen or hasn't been used by WWE before including the CWA Memphis territory provided by Jerry Lawler & behind the scenes footage from ECW including part of his speech before the ECW Barely Legal PPV seen in the ""Beyond The Mat"" movie that WWE previously refused to have any association with as you hear from various names throughout including Larry Zbyszko, Dusty Rhodes, Pro Wrestling Illustrated magazine editor Bill Apter, ex-ECW Owner Tod Gordon, Jerry Lawler, Jim Ross, Raven, Rob Van Dam, Tommy Dreamer, Stephanie McMahon, Mick Foley, Brock Lesnar, ex-ECW staff members Gabe Sabolsky & Ron Buffone, Edge, Big Show, C.M. Punk, Beth Phoenix, Heyman Hustle partner Mitchell Stuart, Natayla, Bray Wyatt, and Rene Young.

The documentary begins with Heyman's first memories of wrestling before coming into how he was running his own business when he wasn't even in high school yet before going into his career as a photographer hustling his way into the locker rooms of Madison Square Garden & production meetings at Jim Crockett Promotions before explaining how his relationship with wrestling lead to him promoting his first wrestling show at the famous Studio 54 in New York City.  His early beginnings as a manager was discussed next starting from who gave him the idea to where the concept of ""Paul E. Dangerously"" came from, how he was immediately inserted into the top program in the Memphis CWA territory, where he got the idea for his infamous cell phone, and how the AWA gave him the heaviest level of exposure he had up to that point before going into his time at WCW from his time with different teams & being an announcer with Jim Ross to the formation of the Dangerous Alliance and why he can't talk about the details of him leaving the company.  One of the most important parts of the presentation comes next in his time with ECW starting with Jim Crockett Jr. pulling his ""punk card"" to what Paul's vision was for not just the company but professional wrestling overall going into details of what they did different to make them ""hardcore"" in the audiences' eyes along with the details of what Vince McMahon did that classified him with the phrase ""ECW's greatest enemy was also their greatest ally"" including the specific details of the working agreement they made in regards to one specific wrestler on their roster before going into Paul's ability to motivate his talent & push the limits of wrestling that hadn't been done before followed by the heavy details of what was wrong with ECW's business model that lead to them going out of business along the effects it had on Paul in more ways than one with Joey Styles responding to the criticisms of Paul going to WWE right after the closing of by giving details of how that move actually saved the talent.  Heyman's time as a WWE commentator was discussed next as far as his real life relationship with Jim Ross & how his relationship began with Brock Lesnar followed by him becoming the lead writer for the ""b-show"" (with the letter ""B"" meaning something else to Paul) SmackDown & the format he used for that show that elevated it where it created legit competition within the company to the point where Stephanie admitted that she did something to him that had never been done to a previous writer before him.  Paul's time in OVW was briefly discussed as far as how he helped develop talent in the ring along with C.M. Punk on the production side as well before going into the details of what the original concept behind the relaunch of ECW was suppose to be compared to what it was & how it was doomed to fail from the start to the point where Tommy Dreamer compared it to a child caught in the middle of a divorced family & how that was ultimately lead to his dismissal from WWE.  Paul's outside projects were discussed next from his Heyman Hustle & production company to the effect being a father has had on him before going into his return to WWE as far as how it all came about & how he's not only mentoring talents but still learning to this day concluding the documentary.

DVD extras include two disc full of his various television promos & interviews throughout his entire career in different promotions; three bonus matches featuring his Original Midnight Express vs. Jim Cornette's Midnight Express (""NWA Main Event"" Jan. '89), teaming with Brock Lesnar vs. Hardy Boyz (Judgment Day '02), and his handicap No DQ Match with Curtis Axel vs. C.M. Punk (Night Of Champions '13); the online teasers for this project; and bonus stories of how Heyman hustled himself backstage to get a job with Vince McMahon Sr., how riding with Freddie Blassie was like driving with ""Mr. Magoo"", both sides of the infamous story of Jerry Lawler breaking Heyman's jaw, various people giving their sides of the story in regards to Tod Gordon being a locker room mole for WCW, how he was able to get $500,000 from Vince McMahon in 3 minutes, Stephanie & Heyman telling their story about the conference call that resulted in him being fired from the creative team, and various talents discussing if they are a ""Paul Heyman Guy.""  Blu-Ray extras include more stories such as one incident describing how differently his mother & father disciplined him, how he helped Bill Apter as a photographer, how he ended up running 3 different fan clubs at the same time, how Austin Idol saved his job the night he was fired, explaining how the concept of his character's cellphone showed how outdated Verge Gagne was, how Jim Ross' caller i.d. caught Heyman in a lie, how Joey Styles learned from Jim Ross through Paul Heyman, how he saved Gabe Sapolsky from quitting ECW in 5 minutes, Tommy Dreamer describing a long loud car ride between Taz & Paul, footage of how interactive Paul was with Little Guido in doing a promo, the outrageous thing Paul told Dreamer to get the morning of a PPV, Gabe telling a story of how Paul remained loyal to a money agreement they had, Dreamer describing Paul's traveling bag, Edge having a theory on who blocked him from coming into ECW, Joey Styles telling the funny story of why Paul said he was late to his wedding, Dreamer on how the connections Paul had in New York City resulted in him drinking from the Stanley Cup, stories of Paul driving his white corvette, Heyman describing in detail of what Vince McMahon did to support ECW publicly & behind the scenes, his honest thoughts on the ECW bankruptcy, Paul returning to the ECW Arena & how he feels about the building today, the story behind his last night as a commentator in WWE, what was the one thing that brought him & Brock Lesnar close, what was the motivation behind convincing Big Show to break Vince McMahon's desk, Edge's memories on his handicap match against Brock & Heyman, the creative way Paul was able to give Big Show recovery time during his feud with Undertaker, how Beth Phoenix was compared to King Kong by Paul along with the funny lesson he gave Beth on her limitations, Mick Foley describing the only time he had negative feelings towards Paul, Jim Ross on his relationship with Paul, why Heyman didn't want to ride with Big Show in Alaska, the story behind Heyman's current voicemail, who are Heyman's heroes, Ron Buffone debating weather Paul was a genius or insane, and what Heyman did to Stephanie when Mae Young passed away.

I said at the start of this that was one of the most unique presentations WWE has done & I stick with that as you got different perspectives & views on the behind the scenes of the wrestling industry through different promotions & positions that Paul has worked through his entire career along with hearing from names that you don't hear from often (and in some cases, you never hear from) in WWE presentations along with the bonus materials of promos & stories showing that Paul gave be just as entertaining in front of a camera as most talent are in a ring so this is one set that I would highly recommend.",1407456000,12,8800,4.64974293059126

6358559,5,B00JHH21AE,"One of the best documentaries produced by wwe. I will say this, any fan of this industry will appreciate this as not only and entertaining documentary to watch but as something that is educational about a man who epitomizes the sheer heart and joy of everything in this business. We get a complete look at a man who has made a name for himself in this business since the 80's shrouded in controversy. We hear from the man himself and his friends and peers. This comes off honest and sincere.

I would just like to add that the person who so generously, ""note the sarcasm"", gave this title a rating of 1 star is clearly one dimensional in their opinion of professional wrestling. While the greats of the past will never be forgotten, and have their place in history, Paul has now had his place engraved into the wrestling worlds books. As for the managers you mentioned, all are great and no one can refute, but based on one persons opinion which denotes an entire 20 some odd year career I'm the wrestling bussiness and has managed and been a part of greatness, I would think that you opinion comes off as a bit of a character assassination, you sir should be ashamed to call yourself a fan if you can not Learn to adapt and understand the changing of the times in the bussiness that we love so much. Maybe you should consider opening your eyes to the product before you and not sit back reminiscing of years past, because those who so that do not enjoy the present and become lost in the future.

However, to get back to the review of this title. I am happy for the purchase and thankful that it was worth every penny. A truly wonderful documentary that true fans will appreciate.",1407369600,,1681,4.436893203883495

6358563,5,B00JHH21AE,"A great DVD for a future HOFer. You can see other reviews for the content. This is just a strong recommendation that you pick up this DVD. I think it is important for two reasons.

1) The WWE's willingness to give sets to managers is a good thing. It means the WWE is possibly willing to branch out of the big money drawing guys for their sets, which is good for everyone. I think this and the Heenan DVD are must owns and send a message to the company that wrestling fans like this kind of variety.

2) This DVD tracks the life and career of one of the most versatile and influential personalities in the wrestling business. From being a photographer to a manager to a booker to an announcer, Heyman is very good at what he does. This DVD will give you insights and provide texture and nuance to his current character on TV.

My only SLIGHT problem, and this is really a half star off for me, is that the DVD doesn't have Taker vs Brock from WM 30. I know I know I know, it wasn't a good match and it is too early to put that on sets. But that was really Heyman's crowning moment as a manager. Not just from a kayfabe perspective, he made that match. His facial expressions, particularly at the end, told the entire story. I think it is some of his finest work and it is a shame it isn't on his set.",1407196800,5,1300,4.130434782608695

6358587,5,B00JHH21AE,"Ladies and Gentlemen, whether you love him or hate him you have to respect him. This DVD (blu-ray), starts out by taking you back to the young Paul Heyman before he was Paul E. It really gives you a clear picture of his origins, his teachings, why he is the way he is, his early days in AWA/WCW, his time in ECW, his arrival in WWE, booking for Smackdown and of course his evolution into ""The one behind the one in 21-1."" Of course during all of this you get to hear from people that were along the ride for his amazing journey. I really enjoyed hearing the honest opinions from everyone from Tommy Dreamer to Jim Ross, it's a different and great perspective on all that is Paul Heyman.

That being said, I must admit I was a huge original ECW fan. I mostly purchased this to hear some behind the scenes talk and stories that have never been heard before. Without going into spoilers, I got just this. To my surprise they really didn't edit him. Those stories were discussed but I actually enjoyed hearing more about what makes him tick. I don't consider him just a professional wrestling talent but a master marketer. This DVD confirms that, as you also get to see the side projects that he has worked on and just how creative he truly is. He might be a liar, a hustler and quite frankly not a very ethical human being but he is a once in a lifetime talent.

I do have a couple of issues with this documentary in all fairness. The first is that Vince McMahon was not interviewed. This was quite disappointing as it would have been nice to have heard the other side of the story. Without going into spoilers there were times that his version of some stories Paul told would have been very insightful. The second issue I have is with Stephanie McMahon. It is quite obvious she is not very fond of Paul but she has no choice but to respect his talent. There are a few quotes from her that just make me shake my head. She just doesn't get Paul and that he is a genius.

Bottom line if you are looking for a great behind the scenes life story of a true evil genius in the wrestling industry; this DVD a must buy. This doesn't even include all of the extras which are interview gold. If i'm a wrestling promoter I'm sitting my talent down and making them watch the extras because this man knows how to cut a promo! Ladies and gentlemen my pen name is ECWintheD and I am a Paul Heyman guy.",1407110400,32,2383,4.267699115044247
6358588,5,B00JHH21AE,"I'm very important so I received this DVD last week and  waited till today, 1 day before it get's released to the public to tell you this...
Ladies and Gentlemen.....This DVD is the greatest DOC that WWE has ever done. I thought CM PUNK'S DVD was fantastic but this my friends is so so much better!.
This right here you get the man Paul Heyman talking the most truthfully he can, is it all truth? We will never know because it's Paul Heyman but I can tell you this. You will hear stories you have NEVER heard before about ECW,he holds nothing back on WCW AND WWF and kudos to Vince for keeping it all in there and not editing all the ""bad stuff about WWE""
If you were ever to buy a WWE DVD this is the one to buy and I encourage you all to buy simply so WWE will keep making these because if everybody just steals it and there's no profit these things will be a thing of the past... If you TRULY are a Paul Heyman Guy you will buy this DVD and show the powers that be in the WWE that WE ALL LOVE PAUL HEYMAN.
If Nobody buys it then Vince can say ""see nobody liked ECW, Nobody really liked CM PUNK, We don't really need Paul Heyman""
Now I leave the ball in you're court...Are You a PAUL HEYMAN GUY?",1407110400,4,1197,4.029411764705882
6358589,4,B00JHH21AE,"Take one part Roddy Piper, one part Jim Cornette, one part mad scientist, and one part Saul Goodman mix them all with some chaos and you have the worlds greatest ""advocate"" of professional wrestling talent. Heyman not only took over ECW and made it a landmark wrestling company, but he also knows talent. He has managed some of the best in the business, from his days wielding a 1980's cell phone to being the man who brought us the BEAST BROOOOCCK LESNAR! for the very first time.",1406851200,6,481,4.540229885057471
6358590,4,B00JHH21AE,Have not seen this one yet but I just purchased it since I am a HUGE Paul Heyman fan and a huge WWE fan.. Without Paul Heyman involved to me the WWE would be quite boring.. I am very glad they made a documentary of Paul heyman. I hope they don't tone this down and stuff.. If you're a true fan of Paul heyman then this is your definite purchase.,1406851200,3,345,3.942857142857143
6358591,5,B00JHH21AE,"i'll admit when i first heard about this in the winter i'd thought ""what was wwe thinking?"" but now i think this COULD be the box set of the year with TONS of lost awa, mid atlantic championship wrestling, nwa, wcw, of course ECW and wwe stuff and paul's legendary shoots like when he trolled EVERYONE in chicago, i'm definally going to be getting it after the price drops somewhat in the fall",1403913600,,393,4.397260273972603
6358592,1,B00JHH21AE,"all I can say is i jump past heyman when he is on the tv. now I'll be darned if I am going to pay good money to listen to him droll on about nothing....and as far as him being the greatest manager in history ? you must of been only watching wrestling for the last 20 years or so....to leave out Bobbie Heenan, JJ Dillon, Jimmy Hart just to name a few ......... Now I know that there are going to be a few of you who are going to say, hey what about his AWA time in the late 80'S? or what about his time with the Dangerous Alliance? or for goodness sakes his ground breaking ECW (Extremely crappy wrestling--thank you king). I have been a wrestling fan sense 1983, paul heyman  lived in his parents basement till he was 39 his dad who is a muti -millionaire gave him the money for his crappy wrestling. and a dvd of this underhanded piece of crap makes me sick.  I WOULD NOT OWN THIS PIECE OF CRAP IF YOU WRAPPED IT IN GOLD AND GAVE IT TO ME. thank you for your time...... p.s. 1 star was two stars too many on the grading of this dvd but as of now amazon does not have a negative rating system.",1402444800,7,1094,3.9681818181818183

I've heard that Heyman is a superior motivator and some of this comes through in his writing.  I think he underplays his influence in WCW, but he definitely made me want to delve into more of his ECW and WWE stuff.",1501545600,,345,4.276923076923077
8650903,3,B00JHH21AE,"I suppose fans of professional wrestling will enjoy a couple hours of Mr. Heyman's self-serving monologue and bombastic performances contrived to rile the crowds at various wrasslin' matches.  As one who finds the game totally phony, I found it a bit hard to endure.  The DVD I watched consisted of three disks, and I stayed with it through about two and half of them, expecting to see some coverage of Mr. Heyman's life away from the ring.  Aside from the first 30 minutes, which covered his life as a pushy teen-aged photographer bent on insinuating himself into the wrestling game, there is no hint that he now exists in any other sphere.",1489536000,,641,4.705357142857143
