4691063,5,B005GJTNNA,I traveled 80 miles to see this film because it was not showing in my home city. I was not disappointed.  This film is excellent and it wasn't at all what I was expecting.  I am beyond thrilled it is available for purchase. I believe it is an important documentary for my children and my children's children to see in the interest of American history and the truth. This is a must see people. Add it to your private DVD collection & purchase more as gifts for your family and friends.,1321920000,52,484,4.3076923076923075
4691064,5,B005GJTNNA,"Compiled from the forgotten footage of Swedish television journalists, Goran Hugo Olsson's ""The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975"" is just what its title says: a mixtape -- no more, no less. The film samples very powerful voices from the 1960s and 1970s and injects contemporary commentary from older people who were involved with the movement and younger people (including Erykah Badu, Talib Kweli, and Questlove (Amir Khalib Thompson) from The Roots) whose lives were changed by it.

The Swedish journalists' footage is nothing short of electrifying. A great deal of the footage in the first half of the film captures the rise of the Black Panther Party, which was not simply composed of gun-toting militant people, as the media so carelessly (or perhaps deliberately) portrayed. In fact, BPP members like Ericka Huggins were running community schools and trying to better the education available to Black communities; BPP initiatives like the Free Breakfast for Children programs sought to meet basic needs for Black communities. Self-defense was simply another initiative to serve the people and protect them from unwarranted brutality and violence.

Moreover, the personal interviews are astounding. A personal interview with Angela Davis as she sits in prison shows her speaking fiercely about the historical legacy of violence in Black communities. In another clip, Stokely Carmichael gently interviews his own mother as she talks about their family's dealings with racism. The intimacy and candor of these interviews and speeches grant a sense of immediacy to names that we only read about in books or hear about in class (that is, if we get the opportunity to learn about people like Angela Davis, Stokely Carmichael, and Huey Newton beyond a cursory overview).

Again and again, the voices in the film echo a general feeling of frustration in the Black Power movement--a frustration with the ineffectiveness of nonviolence, a frustration with the continuing brutality and violence in their communities, a frustration with the status quo that they wanted desperately to change. In one notable instance, this frustration manifests when Stokely Carmichael explains to an audience in Stockholm that ""Dr. King's policy was if you are nonviolent--if you suffer--your opponent will see your suffering and will be moved to change his heart. That's very good. He only made one fallacious assumption: in order for nonviolence to work, your opponent must have a conscience. The United States has none.""

As the Black Power movement wanes, the Swedish journalists look to other subject matter. We see some footage of neo-Garveyite Lewis Michaux (""the Professor"") and his Harlem-based National Memorial African Bookstore, which served as a hub for writers, artists, and leaders of the time. There's a moving interview with a young woman who recounts how she resorted to prostitution to feed her heroin addiction. In another clip (one that lasts longer than it should), Louis Farrakhan talks about his revamped iteration of the Nation of Islam in the 1970s; historian and scholar Robin Kelley contextualizes the rising prominence of the discipline-centric NOI in Black communities that were falling victim to the chaos of increasing drug addition and violence.

Rather than offer an extensive didactic lecture on the Black liberation movement, ""The Black Power Mixtape"" prefers to let the footage speak for itself. The footage crafts a powerful narrative that captures not only the leading voices of the movement but also the voices of day-to-day life in Black communities. Insofar as this documentary is a mixtape, it cannot be comprehensive. But it certainly offers powerful footage and provoking commentary that reminds viewers that the movement is not over. There remains much change to be effected in contemporary society. This film provides some much-needed inspiration.",1321056000,112,3868,5.376237623762377

4691107,5,B005GJTNNA,"It's amazing how you find out that something you believed your whole life, wasn't true...such is the case with ""The Black Power Mixtape"".  After watching this documentary, it made me realize that some people ARE in prison who never were guilty of what they were being accused of. Angela Davis is someone who I grew up hearing about, but only now understand the story behind all of the myths. Just hearing her articulate her views on her upbringing, society and growing up in ""black America"", gave me a new appreciation for the black race, and how standing up for what you believe in can sometimes be the challenge of a lifetime, especially when Politics is involved.  I loved how the Swedish director/producers captured the riveting, and gut retching viewpoints at a time of unrest in America. Would highly recommend this documentary for anyone who likes to see how ALL the pieces of a puzzle comes together.",1385683200,,908,4.814102564102564

Looking at it as a mature adult makes it compelling and insightful....

Young people (anyone born after 1970 ) Should be required to check it out to give some education on how the things that are taken for grated these days were won.... The struggle was no joke and this DVD shows that.....!

I feel I have a peice of history in my film library now. Angela Davis is brilliant, she speaks well & passionate about her beliefs. She was a threat as Reagan and The FBI saw it and it fed in to the paranoia of the government of this time...sort of like our beloved Jon Lennon did with the FBI following him constantly.

4691134,5,B005GJTNNA,This was a very interesting doc that is educational.  You get a real sense of who these freedom fighters were from themselves.

4691135,5,B005GJTNNA,"I fell in love with this documentary so quickly. Being a child born in the 90s, I didn't know a lot about the Black Power movement, but after watching this documentary, I feel like I got a pretty good depiction of the late 70s and early 80s...at least for black people.

4691136,1,B005GJTNNA,"I hated this.  Because :

-  The footage is for the most part boring and trivial.

-  The subjects have so little to say.  They are for the most part narcissists in love with the sounds of their own voices.  They blather on, endlessly stringing big words together and working out endless rationales for their own importance.

I swear, the majority of this footage is these immature characters - Angela Davis is the worst - just blathering on, saying ""Look at me Mommy and daddy, I'm an EDUCATED negro! I can use big words and I'm SMART!"". Don't believe me? Watch for yourself. I guess in that sense there's documentary value to this, but it's boring as heck.",1355443200,2,658,4.516949152542373
4691137,5,B005GJTNNA,As far as documentaries go this is awesome. It actually went over the rise and fall of the Black Power movement. I enjoyed this perspective from the Swedish documentarians.

4691139,5,B005GJTNNA,I rented this documentary on Amazon for a forty-eight hour period and watched it three times because it was so good and filled with information I had not heard anywhere else. Interviews with Angela Davis and several other panther leaders give you a recount of their story from their own mouths. They go into a lot of not very well-known black panther history and circumstances which led to the organizations demise.

4691140,5,B005GJTNNA,"This documentary describes well the epic period of civil movements, it is also supported by understandable explination of living people who were either directly involved with the movement or are well acquained with the situation. Also music rocks!",1334102400,,247,5.526315789473684
4691141,5,B005GJTNNA,"Good documentary, especially seeing them through the eyes of the Swedish film makers and their interpretations of events versus those of us who experienced these events by having lived through them.",1331856000,,198,5.419354838709677
4691142,5,B005GJTNNA,"Excellent video that offers actual footage of some of the revolutionaries of the civil rights movement. There is video footage of Kwame Toure (Stokely Carmicheal) in personal settings; a very youthful Angela Davis, and the original headquarters of the Black Panther Party.  This video could easily have been a multi-set collection; and it left me wanting more.",1330214400,,360,5.315789473684211
4691143,5,B005GJTNNA,"120 minutes of the most fabulous, objective footage that you will ever see. Its a shame it took the Swiss to bring this footage to America. For ages 13 and up or by permission of parents. The scenes from the 1960's on the east and west coast are incredible. The media portrayed members of the Black Panther Party, Angela Davis, Huey P. Newton and Stokely Carmichael as villains and enemies of the state. In this footage, you see White journalist and film crews having lunch and polite conversations with everyone involved in the Civil Rights Movement. J.Edgar Hoover(you know he was as gay as the Nile was long) tried to eradicate the Black Panther Party and was even threatened by their free lunch program.(oh you didn't know that the disadvantaged kids getting free/reduced lunch came from the idea started by the Black Panther Party??--well you now know). J.Edgar Hoover, former almost director for life of the FBI, also ordered drugs be introduced into the Black communites, namely crack cocaine which as you know caused the most sad devstation ever known. This will be the best spent money and buy one as a gift for a friend. What you don't have knowledge of will hurt you and future generations.",1329868800,2,1201,4.778846153846154
4691144,5,B005GJTNNA,"I had heard about this film, for a good six months, before my local PBS (Public Broadcasting Station) broadcast it, for Black History Month. This takes a very honest look at the Black Power Movement of the United States, in the mid-1960s and 1970s. Written and directed by Goran Hugo Olsson, a Swedish filmmaker, we get a unique perspective, through the eyes of a White/European documentarian, interspersing reel footage with audio commentary from people like Erykah Badu (musician/activist), Harry Belafonte (musician/actor/activist), Stokely Carmichael (Trinidadian-American activist), Angela Davis (activist/author/professor), Talib Kweli (hip hop artist/activist), Melvin Van Peebles (actor/director/activist), and Sonia Sanchez (writer/activist/educator), who give us their own viewpoints on the effect of systemized, insular oppression on the African American public in the United States.

We see footage from Malcolm X and his debate, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Black Panther meetings for youth, and community members living at (or below) the poverty line. The narrative is strong, the interview passages are engaging, and the viewer gets a very raw and unfiltered sense of the darkness imposed on the people by the powers that be. Of course, it depends on who you ask. The filmmaker starts the film by interviewing a fifty year old white restauranteur, in a small East Coast town. He seems to be convinced that everyone has a good chance at eating a piece of the pie, and that there is no division amongst peoples. When we go on to see the reality of the squalor, open and close fisted racism, and the words of numerous activists who were considered modern day terrorists, for wanting to rough up the status quo - in protest of acts of inhumanity and ""civil"" displays of racial disparity.

I am grateful that this film exists. It has a brilliant soundtrack by Ahmir Questlove Thompson and Om'Mas Keith. Every history class in the United States, and the world should screen this film in their room. It would really give our young people a greater sense of the hardships that many of our African American brothers and sisters have been up against for generations - dating back to slavery, and earlier. A must see.",1329264000,15,2221,5.183844011142061

4691146,5,B005GJTNNA,This documentary is a requirement!  Mandatory viewing!  I learned so much from watching this including some things that I learned in school that turned out to be completely false.  Everyone should see this and then tell everyone they know to see this.  I had never heard of it until my friend recommended it to me.  So necessary.  I'm going to search and see if there are any other documentaries that are as powerful as this one.  This will be a definite addition to my DVD collection.,1328486400,2,485,4.569767441860465
4691147,4,B005GJTNNA,"The article is a very accurate version of a difficult social time in America. The Black Power movement had taken hold and received lots of support from the Black community because of some of the positive, powerful community programs that were linked to them. This item is a good historical account that young Black Americans should see.",1328400000,,336,4.912280701754386
4691148,4,B005GJTNNA,Marvelous rediscovered footage taken by Swedish film crews in the United States.

4691151,5,B005GJTNNA,"An extremely powerful collection of historic footage covering the black power movement--as well as the plight of Black Americans--of the most radical period in U.S. history. The footage and commentary are emotionally moving, but more oft, they're painful to absorb, which is why this documentary deserves a viewing by anyone who claims to have concern and compassion towards the struggle of their fellow humans. Kudos to the journalists of Sweden for their thorough and passionate coverage of a very intense period within human history. Having just viewed this film, I now want to further pursue the words of freedom fighters Stokely Carmichael and Angela Davis. This film unintentionally points out the deafening void of any sort of representation of today's Black America. It's mandatory that the powerful and inspirational words that came from the mouths of Malcolm and Angela and Stokely and Martin be heard by today's apathetic and easily-distracted youth.  ""The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975"" is a perfect start for them.",1325203200,15,1027,5.339506172839506
4691152,5,B005GJTNNA,"After viewing this, it's no wonder it went straight to DVD. From CarMichael's speech to Angela Davis' controversial trial, I can see why it couldn't be seen in theaters. If you are a student of all the history that Black Americans had to endure, this is for you!! A thoroughly put review would not do this ""mixtape"" any justice. Please, just order this for yourselves and you will NOT be deceived. Trust me. Power to the Black people.",1324944000,4,434,4.576923076923077
4691153,5,B005GJTNNA,If you are thirsty for knowledge of our history you must see this documentary.  It is still extremely relevant to what are going through in this country today.  In 1968 the white government of this country murdered or imprisoned our leaders.  I can't help but wonder where Black people would be today if all our leaders had of been able to continue to free the minds of our people.  Not only must you see this you must buy this documentary!,1323820800,13,440,4.4625
