4497670,2,B004XT840M,Was so excited to see this and honestly it was weak. It really didn't seem like he put that much work into this act. Hopefully his fans don't just blindly say it was great and maybe he'll put some more time into his next act. Being a huge fan of his I hope this isn't the new Russell.,1315353600,7,284,3.913793103448276

4497672,2,B004XT840M,"Lot of jokes are being recycled. In fact, 3 or 4 stories were straight from the previous shows with very little modifications. This is not quite the way to reward loyal fan, Russell! We all know you can do better than this. Timing is off; Russell does not look much into the show. I'm very disappointed overall!
First time watchers, forget about this show and go for the much funnier previous ones.",1314662400,10,398,4.541666666666667
8447432,2,B004XT840M,"I *love* Russell Peter's comedy, but this was just lackluster.  I read the poor reviews and still bought it but wish I hadn't.  Most of it was just him playing with the audience and wasting a lot of time trying to hear people's responses.  Lots of recycled bits too.  The only new stuff was at the very end, and by that I mean the last minute or so.  You can easily pass this up and know you haven't missed anything.",1466899200,,416,4.15

8447435,2,B004XT840M,I bought this even though others have criticized his performance here as not being very funny.  I must say that I fully agree with the critics on this show. I have liked his other shows though!,1386979200,,193,4.361111111111111
8447436,5,B004XT840M,"If you have issues with anything four-lettered, you might not want to watch it.  Smart comedy, well written.  Saw this on HBO first and my husband & I laughed until we cried.  So glad we could buy and have to watch whenever.  Have watched some of his other DVDs as well, just as funny.  Good comedic talent!",1376524800,,307,4.315789473684211
8447437,1,B004XT840M,"Painful to watch a formerly awesome comedian clucking on stage like a chicken for a minute, and picking on so many people in the audience. Timing was awful, jokes were long and drawn out so that by the time the punchlines came, I had no interest in the jokes. The sick jokes were also not funny at all, just disconcerting. And the swearing is so unnecessary.

Since Comedy Now it has only been downhill. Outsourced and Red White and Brown were still pretty good, although they lacked the energy and enthusiasm Russell had in Comedy Now. This was plain awful.

Russell, I really hope you put more effort and energy into your future shows. It feels like you don't even care anymore. You're much better than the painful mess Green Card tour was.",1367625600,,742,4.571428571428571
8447438,5,B004XT840M,Loved it !!!!!!! Went to the live showing and saw deleted scenes from the day I didn't go. get 10/10 for me,1353110400,,107,3.909090909090909
8447439,2,B004XT840M,"I'm a huge Peters fan but I was very disappointing on this DVD..his previous DVD ""Outsourced"" was much funnier..Green Card tour had many cheap, amateur type jokes..expected alot from Russell..there were a few Asian and Arab jokes that were funny but other than that, he had many sexual and disgusting bathroom jokes..overall, not a good show..sorry Russell!",1340755200,,357,5.280701754385965
8447440,5,B004XT840M,My whole family loves his style. So down to earth. He works the audience beautifully. Things couldn't have been so perfectly set with this group of people. The chemistry was perfect. Sometimes I have to have a Russell Peters fix and watch it all over again. My kids and friends use his lines all the time. You gotta watch it to GET IT!,1327017600,3,335,4.333333333333333
8447441,3,B004XT840M,"I liked all of Peters' prior work a great deal, but this was only ok. There is nothing new here and nothing clever--a lot of lame jokes about his genitalia and how certain curse words in English mean something else in foreign languages, plus his usual cracks about Chinese names, etc.  This is mostly audience interaction and very repetitive (After 6 ""what's you rname?"" bits, little is left to be laughed at). He comes across as lazy after his much-deserved success, not bothering to write new material.

A sad disappointment",1315353600,2,526,4.833333333333333
