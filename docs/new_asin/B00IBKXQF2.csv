6256446,3,B00IBKXQF2,"Religious horror and thriller movies are a dime a dozen these days. Ever since ""The Exorcist"" hit screens in 1973, the world has been in a state of satanic panic. There's always a constant flow of possession or devil-baby flicks being released in the independent world of horror and touched upon in the mainstream at least once every six months or so. Some of them rise above the standard fare, while others fizzle out and are forgotten. ""Way of the Wicked"" falls short of being memorable by offering nothing new to audiences.

Robbie (Jake Croker) is a disturbed young teen suspected of causing a mysterious death. After five years, he returns to his hometown to start anew. Still pining for the local police detective's (Vinnie Jones) daughter Heather (Emily Tennant), he befriends her and incurs the wrath of the girl's popular schoolmates and suitor. They begin turning up dead as each torments Robbie and bothers his love interest. Can Father Henry (Christian Slater) use the powers of his faith to stop the killings?

""Way of the Wicked"" plays out like a mashed-up version of ""Carrie"" and ""The Omen."" Although the image used to promote the movie screams ""The Exorcist,"" what viewers find inside is a hodge-podge of elements taken from other films featuring teens with telekinetic powers. The only tie to religious thrillers is a prophecy Father Henry is investigating. Upon first viewing, it's vague whether the foretelling is from the Bible or another book associated with it. I doubt anyone would want to view it a second time just to catch whether it's one or the other.

The acting in ""Way of the Wicked"" never comes into question. Both Vinnie Jones and Christian Slater act like they're personally invested in the film. Emily Tennant does a great job emoting as Heather. Jake Croker is absolutely creepy as Robbie. His performance and haunting stare made my skin crawl.

""Way of the Wicked"" is unrated. It features violence, adult situations, and language. Viewers don't have to sit through any unnecessary nude scenes. I can see this airing on the Chiller Channel on a Friday or Saturday night.

Even ""Way of the Wicked's"" attempt at a twist ending ends up falling flat. It just makes the whole thing more of a copycat of past movies much better than this. Even though you don't see it coming and it's well-delivered, you still are left with a sense of dj vu as the credits roll. I can think of films that are a bigger waste of time, but you'd still be better off re-watching ""Carrie,"" ""Firestarter,"" or ""The Omen.""",1401494400,,2527,4.8
6256447,2,B00IBKXQF2,"Formulaic, half-baked film about Robbie the weird bullied kid with unique and sinister powers; Heather, his pretty friend from childhood whose doting British dad is a cop; Greg, the cool jock-jerk with selfish carnal desires for Heather; Heather's friends and Greg's friends, none of whom contribute a whole lot except as filler; and finally, Father Henry, the kooky ""priest"" played by Christian Slater who's read some arcane medieval texts and has Robbie all figured out.

Good cinematography with pretty scenery makes WAY OF THE WICKED basically palatable. Still, this hinders as much as it helps because you may be left wishing you hadn't bothered to finish it. The plot follows the same pattern that's been done--and done much better--a gazillion times before. Full of loose ends and unanswered questions, e.g., Why don't the cops question Heather about Greg? Some routine, unimaginative, tacked-in twists and ""surprises."" Most of the script, Robbie's excepted, is similarly lame.

Another film where it doesn't seem the makers had much of a clue what to make happen, particularly when it came to ending it, so they just shrugged and said, ""Oh, well, let's just get this out and make a few bucks (mostly from Redbox) off it.""",1400889600,,1229,5.109452736318408
6256448,2,B00IBKXQF2,"With the decent cast of Vinnie Jones, Christian Slater and Emily Tennant you kind of expect more, but I think the plot let's them down.  Incidentally Jake Croker did a good job of creeping you out.  I won't let him within 500 feet of my daughter.  The big problem is that other than Slater being a defrocked priest there is nothing really that makes it a story with demonic overtones or just a story of a kid with telekinetic powers doing wrong.  No demon appearing just people being thrown around.  The storyline is simple.  A young boy was present when one of two bullies died a mysterious death with no one putting his hands on him.  He and his mother leave town because of locals hounding them,
but return 5 years later (no reason why) and things start to happen again.",1400803200,5,773,4.439716312056738
6256449,3,B00IBKXQF2,"Everything thats been going on around us has all been foretold.  After residents of a small town begin to die mysteriously the local cop John Elliott (Jones) is at a loss.  When his daughter tells him of an old friend of hers as returned to her school he remembers events of the past. When Father Henry (Slater) shows up and tells Elliott what he thinks is going on he doesnt believe him, but when his daughter becomes a target he is only one who can stop him. If you were to judge this by the cover and cast (like I did originally) you would probably not expect much. Christian Slater has fallen into the Val Kilmer school of acting lately. He does a lot of movies without caring if they are good or not. Vinnie Jones is, well, Vinnie Jones. Armed with those expectations I was looking forward to a long boring movie. While the movie isn't amazing or something I would watch again I have to say that I did end up liking it. The movie is kind of like if Damien went to high school. There are enough horror aspects to appease horror fans and enough drama and intrigue to please non horror fans. This is a B movie and nothing amazing but I expected much worse. I do have to say that this is Slaters best movie in a while. Overall, its not one of the best movies I have seen in a while but it was entertaining and I wasn't bored. I give this a B.",1400284800,,1343,4.161538461538462
6256450,2,B00IBKXQF2,"It appears creepy little Robbie Mueller (Jake Croker) has telekinetic power and people who want to harm him, tend to die. After being away from his home town for five years he is back in high school creeping everybody out with his knowledge of Drake's Equation, bad hair, and inability to smile. The only thing more creepy is Christian Slater playing a defrocked priest following him around wearing a gold gangsta cross.

Robbie has designs for Heather (Emily Tennant) who shows as much emotion as Kristen Stewart.  Her father is a small town detective played by Vinnie Jones who is as convincing as when he played Ivan Rudovsky. The film felt like I was listening to someone tell a story who doesn't know how to tell a story.

I had ""Carrie"" flashbacks as well as ""The Omen."" The small Washington state town with a girl being liked by a guy with special powers had me thinking ""Twilight"" especially with the low end acting. There is a twist which I admit didn't see coming, because the clues were light and you were dragged heavily in one direction. So think twist, and if you get it before the last 30 minutes,  I owe you a Scooby-Snack.

The film might have some stoner camp value to it.  Not a serious horror/thriller.

6256455,2,B00IBKXQF2,I didn't find this movie all that original. I had higher expectations. But it was pretty much just a rehashed plot that can be found among the prolific B horror genre. I almost cut it off 20 minutes before the end but since I had paid to rent it I figured I might as well see it through to the end. I would say there was a twist at the end but I had guessed it before we ever got there.,1407024000,,386,3.7777777777777777

6256459,3,B00IBKXQF2,"Christian Slater does not have much of a part, so if you are getting this from him, don't. Vinnie Jones, usually the bad guy in every British movie< is the loving dad. There are some very strange goings on between his daughter and a troubled young man. People are dying and being tossed around. Very predictable, saw so much of it coming a mile away but it is okay for killing time. the young man, Jake Croker, I think, is probably the best actor or the bunch, very sinister and diabolical. Just for something to do, this could be it. Don't expect too much and there are some really slow parts.",1404691200,,594,4.36036036036036

8640630,3,B00IBKXQF2,"The problem with ""supernatural"" themed movies is that they don't require any explanation as to how the supernatural phenomena they are dealing with came about in the first place.  After all, it's just plain ""supernatural"". This film opens with a scene regarding bullying only to have the bullies suddenly get theirs in a lethal way. The one who was being bullied and beaten up is now grilled and being blamed for what happened despite his protestations that he didn't do anything.  Talk about ""innocent till proven guilty"" (hah!).  A priest played by an unimpressive Christian Slater is involved in the process. The investigators are quickly shown the door by the victim's mother. Five years go by and the young man returns to the local high school all pumped up and looking quite different than he did previously.  Where he's been and what he did during those intervening years is never made clear.  The bullying starts all over again since our returnee is now accused of poaching on someone else's girlfriend. He consistenly gets beaten up despite the fact that he looks as though he could easily take on his attackers quite handily.  And once again he gets blamed when the bullies suddenly start bleeding, hurl themselves against walls and lockers, despite the fact that, all the while, our victim is lying on the floor bloodied from the assault.  The policeman father of the girl involved in the situation blames him; the priest is convinced that he is doing something to the bullies through some sort of telekenetic power. And whenever something happens, no witnesses ever come forward; no interference by a guard or Principal. I guess that bullying is acceptable providing that the bullies don't get hurt.  As things progress, the bullying gets worse and the bullies pay a dearer price.  Meanwhile the priest (defrocked no less) is shown in his residence trying to solve the ""supernatural"" mystery.  His back wall is covered with intended intimidating pictures of various individuals from history and otherwise.  A knowledgeable viewer will recognize many of the images which are never known to be associated with the supernatural. (One picture is that of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian's famous general, Belisarius.)  Be that as it may, the ending has the usual unforeseen twist (no ""Spoilers"" here) that a very attentive viewer might guess (I did, but I'm not bragging).
If this kind of movie is your shtick and you decide to buy it, look for an inexpensive used copy.  Oh - And no animals were hurt during the filming of this movie.",1432944000,,2542,4.938967136150235
