What better time of the year to enjoy your/our/your older sibling's/your parent's (whomevers) childhood memories. Hot Wheels, the Erector Set, Barbie, the Hula Hoop, Crayola, Play-Doh ... basically, the whole history of toys and from whence they came is covered. I rarely give a 5 star review here, but this one really has no match on the topic. Based on the commonly under $10 priceline, just buy it!",1387929600,,617,4.775700934579439

8120152,3,B000FBFYT6,"When I bought this dvd I was expecting a history of toys a little deeper than this one (including maybe more historical names, inventors, more situations that forced the constitution of some toys perhaps, also a bit more of the history of toys in the world, not just in the US).

Nevertheless it is very well made and has a good time line, it covers most of the basics of this history so if you are looking for an overview, history of main toys in the US, it will be just fine.",1231459200,2,477,4.184782608695652
