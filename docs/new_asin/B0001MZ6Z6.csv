8014912,3,B0001MZ6Z6,"Okay - I'm a major Beyblade series fangirl. I love the series and all. And I was elated when I heard from many sources that this was going to be uncut. As in nothing cut out, in japanese language with English subtitles, NOT dubbed in English.

 Thus, I ordered volume 1 and 2. It arrived this afternoon, and seriously - I was shocked.

 First shock came when I read the outside of the DVD cover - ""English Language Disc"". I hoped against hope that it did not mean what it said, and that there would be an option to switch the audio and turn on subtitles. Second biggest shock came when I played it and tadah - no Japanese audio, and no subtitles.

 Needless to say, I was very, VERY, EXTREMELY disappointed. No, actually first came the outraged cry of anger, then came the resigned watching of the first 3 episodes, then when it ended I just sat down and shook my head.

 Perhaps I should have confirmed what I knew with those in charge. However, I still find all this disappointing.

 I really love the series. I would give it a 5. I have nothing against the dubbers, but not having the series in it's original language Japanese brought it down to a 3.",1090627200,5,1153,4.32093023255814

Instead of the bitbeasts in the beyblade having powers, the people have them and can hurt the other people.(It's not just gay hologram's anymore) Furthermore, they use the G series beyblades that come with an engine instead of a spin gear.(k technically it's still there but it's different.) This can all be bought if you have access to the Takara brand products instead of the Hasbro products(these are the only two official companies;other companies such as Hongli makes fakes[if u want to see fakes look 4 beyblades @ ebay, basically none are real!])Also a new character named Daichi(has Gaia Dragoon) comes in as the Bladebrekers are forced to seperate on to other teams.{Tyson,w/Daichi;Max,All Stars;Kai,Tala's team[forgot the name];as the best character on any of the Beyblade series's or the movie RAY goes back to his better team the WHITE TIGERS![ *<:D ]) I don't wanna wait.",1082592000,,978,5.04320987654321
