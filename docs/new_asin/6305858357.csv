1083604,3,6305858357,"For all four episodes on one tape and in three languages, this DVD isn't really a bad deal. Burn Up Warrior follows the story of a dispatch team known as Team Warrior, which handles obscure cases that cannot be placed into specific categories. It's also impossible not to notice that Team Warrior consists mostly of large-breasted women. There's not as much nudity as one would imagine, but there's some, and plenty of bouncing to accompany it. As for sound, Burn Up W has a great opening theme song that has an easily likable tune. The dubbing for the most part sucks, but who says you need to listen to the English track? The anime itself is a cross between comedy and action, but the execution on both is only average.
Starting off with a terrorist demand for a nude bungee jump which has to be performed by the Warrior Rio, the stories feature other fun crap like an Evangelion parody and a trip to a used underwear shop. Eventually it wears down to a hard-boiled revenge story; in episode four, Team Warrior has to dispose of three deranged murderers which make for some decent fight scenes and a strangely whimsical battle theme. Alas, the main organization behind everything is never destroyed, and the grand conflict is never resolved. The DVD is by far a better deal than the VHS tapes, which have only one half-hour episode on each one.
One last note, this anime isn't rated 18 up, it would be more like 13 up. This is far from hentai, which is 18+ anime.",992908800,,1465,4.553030303030303
1083605,4,6305858357,"Though this series is not for the conservative, it is definetly worth a watch. There are a few well-defined characters, notably Rio and Yuji, both dubbed very well. Plus the art is in general very good and sharp, and the action is Powerful! There is also plenty of cute humor. Burn-Up Warriors' storyline may be kind of jumpy, but the characters and art leave you with that 'I just watched some damned good anime' feeling.",983664000,,422,4.64
1083606,4,6305858357,"Heres a show with major fan service. If you watch a lot of anime (one of them being Evangelion for sure), then you will find this just as great as Otaku No Video. This series is great with action, ditzy humor and plenty of characters with great personalities. Not to mention mecha, action, a virus, romance, terorists and a nude bungie jump. You might look at this video, see the extremely thin women in tight clothes and say ""What makes this different from Amazing Nurse Nanako or Jungle De Ikou""? It simple. The character development and clever humor make it a show to watch. And unlike Nanako, where the show is based on one character who isn't that great, Burn Up W has plenty of characters to choose from on which one you will like. For better or worse, the dub has some american in-jokes on stuff like Jerry Springer on the level of Those Who Hunt Elves. Anyway, for those who don't mind seeing anime like this and can appreciate a dub catered towards your humor, then I would recommend seeing this. ... If you haven't seen this series yet, see it now.",981331200,2,1058,4.458762886597938
1083607,2,6305858357,"I'm sorry.  I just can't recommend this series, for one simple reason:  it's puerile.
Yes, Burn Up W is supposed to be funny and spoofy.  The problem is, it goes way over the top.  Sorta like the happy-face balloon in the car crash in _Soultaker_; ""OK, movie, shove the irony down our throats!""
Burn Up W tells the tale of an over-endowed blonde anime babe (Rio), an over-endowed gun nut babe (Maya), a cute hacker girl who's the ultimate combination of Sasami and Washu from Tenchi Muyo, a lecherous dumb cop who's trying to date Rio, and a yawningly boring stand-in for Sylia from Bubblegum Crisis.  And they're as stereotypical in their roles as you'd expect.
Shall we talk about the rampant pointless nudity (in the opening credits sequence, even!)?  Which is to be expected in anime, but...at least once per episode?  Along with junvile ""adult"" humor (much as people seem to laugh at Rio's constipation scene, it's so over-the-top that you realize what's going on about two sentences into it).
Or, you could look at episode two's pointless hyperviolence -- and I'm talking about ""visibly ripping people's brains out"" sort of violence.  The set-up is a meeting of criminals; a ""virtual drug"" pusher wants to co-ordinate with a distributor, who double-crosses the pusher when his bodyguards pull out heavy-duty guns.  The pusher beckons, and ""Axia"" steps forward.  Yes, that's right, a killer android.  Axia then proceeds to rip one bodyguard's brains out, then guns down all of the others.  It's not even a spoof of hyperviolence; it's explicitly bloody and gory and dark.  For no really good reason.  They could just as easily have had the same thing happen, just not literally show blood and brains spraying out of the first bodyguard's head.
For me, in the final analysis, Burn Up W is a show that's trying too hard to be funny.  Like a lot of American sitcoms, where it feels like the emphasis is on fulfilling a quota of one-liners, Burn Up W tries to be spoofy, but ends up being ridiculous.  Watch Battle Athletes Victory first, which manages to be fun without being annoying.
""But of course, that's just my opinion; I could be wrong,"" to quote Dennis Miller.",969926400,7,2170,4.793010752688172
1083608,4,6305858357,"ahhh, the tongue in cheek anime genre, gotta love it aint cha, they manage  to spoof everything including themselves. The two main girls, rio and maya,  are overly endowned, as most pf the female characters are, but purely for  humorous intent, and humerous it is.
techinically, the animation is some  of the best you're likely to see from an anime series, the detail is great,  althogugh it does lack in some areas like minor characters and backgrounds.
The music, is just great, wheras episodes 1 and 2 are laugh out loud  funny, the second two are more serious and emotional, what is commendable  is that these characters progess believably, and are consistent, its not  like they are going for laughs, these are who they are.
classic scenes  are evident evwrywhere, rios constipation, maya trigger happy nature and  the funniest evangelion tribute/joke ever. Complete with many spoofs of  mission impossible, die hard with a dash of inuendo from yugi and rio's  love-hate? relationship
This is really opne for those who like their  anime funny and serious with lots ofr action, a bit of everything basicly.  Did you like project a-ko, slayers or tenchi? if so this is for you, its  also on one disc so it s cheap, like the budgy.
why did i give it only 4  stars if i praise it so#? thats a personal peeve as to the fact that its  only 4 episodes period, theyran out of budget or something and leave the  series on a ambiguous note, if only adv would put up the money for a second  outing for the warrior team.",968198400,13,1513,4.599250936329588
1083609,5,6305858357,"In some peoples eyes Burn Up W is what a good anime should be, a loud, fast paced adventure with lots of large guns, and very well endowed  characters. But overall Burn up W is just good fun. It's a feature that  doesn't take itself too seriously, and so can be watched over and over,  without becoming boring.  It's the Japanese equivalent of a high school  movie, full of humour, light on plot. But who cares, it's still pretty good  in all respects. The DVD picture and sound are excellent as is the quality  and menu system of the package in general. If you're a Tenchi or Bebop fan,  and you don't take yourself too seriously, you'll enjoy this title.  Hopefully there will be further DVD episode releases, as the series in its  entirety could be real good.  Give it a try!",966902400,15,778,4.408450704225352
1083610,5,6305858357,"This one if from the company who created/participated many master pieces such as Bubblegum Crisis Series, Vampre Miu, Dangaioh, Dual, Tenji-Muyou...  etc. This company is very good at creating SF-related action type animes (I  consider it the #1 in the industry, when talking about action  animes).
This one is relatively weak in the storyline and, unfortunately,  does not have the full TV episodes with it. Maybe they are going to publish  it later.",966556800,,451,5.123287671232877

But the team sometimes acts special themselves, being both greedy and violent, they end up causing as much damage as the criminals of Neo-Tokyo.  Lets not forget the nude bungee jump and the giant anti-android mecha.

I really enjoyed the second episode, with the attack android, and these 4 episodes of Burn-Up W are the foundation for the 13 episodes in Burn-Up Excess.

The characters are funny and you've gota love that hair they have.  The only boy in the show is a prick which is always nice. :)  Wouldn't recommend it for small children, but for teens and adults, I STRONGLY recommend it.",1089158400,,365,4.041666666666667
1083673,4,6305858357,"This one had me laughing alot, I will say that, sadly it was mostly at the terrible voice acting and dubbing skills, those were pretty terrible.  I watched in in Japanese after and still laughed, but this time it was at the jokes.  Needless to say, this one will make you laugh.
There aren't many features on this one, but it is set up nice and it includes all 4 episodes from the Warrior series, follow up to the original Burn Up, which was a little superior in places.  As with DP Flash and the style of redoing older anime in a new spectrum, this is one of those that faired pretty well in the attempt to keep the trend moving and will probably fair pretty well in time, better than DP Flash in most cases in the superior storylines, animation and humor.
The soundtrack on this one isn't anywhere near one of the best, but it does its job well enough and the action is humorous when it is supposed to well.  I good release by ADV and one worth purchasing if you haven't already.",1024185600,2,981,4.258064516129032

The Names of these girls are Rio, Maki, Lilica, and the one male Yugi. There is occasional nudity not brief but hey anything is possible in anime. If you have PS2 you might want to skip this because there are problems with it playing the last 2 episodes. A few scenes in this film have blood and gore but nothing you can't handle. All in all you could enjoy this film. Oh yeah for the record don't let kids under the age of 14 see this. It might be sourta a comedy but to much adult content.",1020988800,6,656,4.1328125
1083675,4,6305858357,When I saw this anime I was expecting a fun type of show which it was. It first starts out with it being funny and with just a little violence. Then during it gets to about at the third episode then a bunch of bad stuff starts to happen which I thought that was a pretty big twist. In a bad way and somewhat a good way. At the ending was depressing. So that wasn't good and it was pretty sad. Anyways this is a funny and a fun series until it gets to I think the 2 1/2 mark in the series or something. The action is pretty good all except one part in the series. Although overall it's prety good all except for the bad things and the ending. I reccomend renting this first. And I would think that the Japanese version would be just a little bit to much sadder with the Japanese voices and how the really get into the character.,1017792000,,827,4.0181818181818185

Babes with guns and offcourse, big assets. I really didn't like this show, but i didn't dislike it either. As you can see by the ratings i put it in a middle ground. The story was paper thin with no twists or plot changes. The girls personalities didn't have a chance to develop. And the big ""assets"" i talked about just doesn't work for me, it's just playing silly. Average story with a lack of character development.",1014768000,2,467,4.258426966292135

1083680,3,6305858357,"Let's see, this series has big-breasted heroines (not much nudity, but a good dose of ""fan service"" shots) -- one who's willing to use a bit of her sexy charms to her own benefit, one who's overly eager to destroy stuff, one who's spunky and is good with computers, one who's a calm, calculating leader -- and one blundering guy who has a crush on one of the girls.  Sounds cliche already?  Well, that's what the series is like overall.
The plot is enjoyable, but is laden with cliche elements.  None of the plot development, character dilemma, conflicts, resolution, etc, will make you sit up and take notice.  If you've seen a good dose of anime before, then you've seen all this before.
Of course, that's not to say the series sucks.  It's definitely enjoyable.  The animation quality is quite decent (music is horrible, though), and I thought some of the character designs were very nice (albeit not too original).  And the story has its moments too.
So as long as you know what you're getting -- a nicely-produced OVA series with tons of cliche elements -- then you'll probably enjoy it.  But don't expect anything groundbreaking...",1001376000,2,1137,4.7360406091370555

Nudity is rampant, Maya acts like a trigger-happy yahoo and Rio whining that she wastes her meager paycheck on the latest gizmo or skirt is a running gag of the series.

While the DVD edition isn't perfect, it is one of the few US dvd editions that exist that includes the mexican spanish dub. I just wished more multilingual anime dvd's did the same.",1482019200,,475,4.337078651685394

Burn Up is a rollicking romp and a send-up of police adventures that's big on action and light on coherent thought.  The story may be disjointed sometimes, but it's good enough to enjoy, and never takes itself too seriously.  I have the Burn Up! and Burn Up! W single DVD's.

7896454,3,6305858357,"Some people have seen this as being a follow up of some kind to the original Burn Up! one-shot OVA. Both of them are future cop comedies featuring busty female officers and done through AIC, but in most respects Burn Up W is a remake of the first one. The original highlighted a kickass buxom blonde named Maki, and W also has a character named Maki but slightly older with short blue hair and glasses, although it's never revealed if this is the exact same person in the same storyline. Similar to how the TV series, Burn Up Excess is an extended remake of W, and the Burn Up Scramble TV series is almost a remake of that too. So the franchise seems to be one remake after the other, but Burn Up W was the one that cemented it within the otaku zeitgeist.

 Set in the not to distant future, a select special covert team within the Tokyo police has been assembled to handle special cases dubbed Team Warrior, although each member has their own unique quirks. Their leader Maki is extensive with their budget, their main fighter Rio is a battling blonde with a talent for spending way too much of her pension, Maya is their gun expert who is obsessed with firearms, Lillica is the playful hacker, Nanvel is their tech genius, and Yuji is the token male of the group whose main contribution is helicopter pilot and according to the opening credits(which only were completed more with every episode)is also a decent driver. They repeatedly butting heads with a mysterious underground group trying to introduce a new ""virtual drug"" to the market. Granted this OVA came out when the idea of VR involved huge helmets with large visors and going into somekind of Lawnmower Man sim, but this is maguffin of the story. The criminals first take a hotel full of dignitaries hostage to show them their product while some rank thrillseekers pretend to be the actual terrorists. The bad guys then loose track of their virtual idol Maria who is supposed to front the VR drug, and the AI downloads herself into an android body, which Team Warrior's response is to send an oversized Evangelion mecha to deal with it(talk about overkill!). The police eventually get a hold of one of the virtual drug headsets, so the bad guys invade police headquarters to get it back, so Team Warrior has to put them down.

Despite all the gags and fan service, the last two episodes have a pretty somber note to them with Rio's friend getting killed which causes her to go all Punisher on the bad guys. The OVA doesn't have an official ending to it, which is why it was remade as the TV series, Burn Up Excess, but the OVA on its own has a serious mad streak of fun and no holds barred action that the other TV remakes really seemed to capture. Burn Up W has been released twice through ADV Films on DVD, once on its own and again as part of their Essential Anime line, although it originally was unforgivably put on VHS as one episode per tape!",1401408000,,2912,4.490566037735849

Sit back and enjoy the ride.  Its a cartoon story about hot chicks with guns.....is that a bad thing?  Not in my book.

7896457,3,6305858357,"I did not have high expectations for this one, so I was rewarded on some levels and satisfactorily underwhelmed on others. The story centers around a Secret Special Team of cops that respond to particular missions for reward money. So basically they are mercenaries who moonlight as cops, or vice versa. Terrorist attacks, to kidnappings, to being body guards, to tracking down peeping toms who steal young girl's underwear - they handle all the ""tough"" questions. It does not hurt then, that the three main characters are very attractive, have perfect bodies, and are extremely busty. This DVD wastes no time getting you up close and personal with the star's assets and will even allow you to turn on a ""boing counter"" to help you keep track of bouncy cleavage shots each girl gets. Rio is the main character, and has the largest chest of course. She is somewhat of a clutz, very loud and whiny and is always broke. Yuji is the token guy, who lusts after Rio, but can't get the time of day, and apparently serves the group no other purpose but to bumble around and make lewd comments directed towards Rio. Maya is the ""brawn"" of the group. She is the weapons master, sniper, demolitions expert. She is always complaining that she hasn't gotten to blow stuff up or shoot somebody in every episode. Then there's the ultra cool, calm commander lady, cute computer tech girl, and other random prettiness sprinkled in to round out the cast. The episodes start out very light and trite, but by the last episode takes a very serious turn when people start actually dying.
