2565314,3,B000FGGWJM,"Growing up gay in the 1970's, one could not help but be aware of the name, persona and photos of Peter Berlin, perhaps the most successful gay model/photographers of the past century.  With his clean good looks, longish blonde cut, and defined body, always framed by a series of creative leather and other wardrobes, Berlin was an icon of that decade's gay porn, starring in self-produced vanity pieces like ""Nights in Black Leather"" and ""That Boy"" that had extended runs at the gay porn film houses of the time. He was unique at that time when gay society pretty much demanded the ""clone look"" (short hair, moustache, flannel shirt, jeans, boots), while his look was almost exactly the opposite.  Information or interviews about him were few and far between, as the highly personal and reclusive Berlin limited access to get to know the ""real"" him, preferring to let his photos and people's imaginations carry him to fame.

Thirty years later, this 2005 documentary looks at Peter Berlin from his childhood to the present, getting additional perspectives from those who have known or interviewed him over the years, including author Armistead Maupin, producer/director Wakefield Poole, director John Waters, and fellow porn star Jack Wrangler.  At least of the 80 minute running time consists of classic film shot during Berlin's prime, walking the streets of San Francisco, on photo shoots, doing his poses as ""street art"" in cruising areas, and scenes from his two feature films and several shorts. We learn about travels in Europe, his lifepartner of over 20 years, his friendship with Andy Warhol, and - though I found it hard to believe - the fact that he led a fairly celebate life in San Francisco.  Peter gives a tour of his apartment, displays some of the souveniers of his career, and talks honestly about his motivations and influences over the years. It's an interesting look at a unique individual, kind of gay porn's answer to Garbo.

DVD has photo gallery, additional interview and director commentary. I give it three stars out of five.",1218412800,4,2053,4.953488372093023
2565315,5,B000FGGWJM,"This documentary on Peter Berlin's life is really quite extraordinary.  I've know his face and I've known his face since I bought my first porn mag back in the early/mid 80's but I had never put the two together.  And, getting to see ALL facets of his work and life, especially all of the amazing self-photography he did, is great.  There are so many gay men out there who know his face (or name), like I did, but don't know Peter's full-story...and here it is...and quite and intriguing one it is.  They don't make 'em like this anymore...a porn star's shelf life, as is said in the documentary, is about 14 minutes these days, but Peter Berlin and a select few men from the 70's and very early 80's still endure and I believe always will.  Well worth your buck both for the biography and for all the images of this stud.",1191283200,6,822,4.381578947368421
2565316,2,B000FGGWJM,"I honestly couldn't say what I was hoping for when I bought this film, but I certainly didn't get it.  Jim Tushinski's documentary of self-made 70s gay sex icon Peter Berlin is a perfectly respectable talking-heads-with-film-clips exercise, and some of the heads talking (John Waters in particular) are quite fun.  The home movies and clips from Berlin's porn flicks (he only made two) are welcome, capturing a time and place long gone, and serving as a time machine for those of us who were there and lived to tell the tale.  The problem here is that Berlin himself is a less-than-scintillating interview - you could get more interesting repartee any Saturday night in any gay club in America from the old queen at the far end of the bar knocking back his third Rob Roy.  And while he is still slender and very handsome at 60-something, there's something Baby Jane-ish about the sight of Berlin still wearing the trademark Dutch-boy haircut and nothing-left-to-the-imagination skin-tight clothes of his youth.  Watching Berlin pulling back the loose skin at his throat and wondering aloud ""should he get a lift?"", is a squirm-worthy experience.  As he slumps into the sofa in his small San Francisco apartment that's pretty much a shrine to himself, prattling on about his films, his countless erotic photo self-portraits, his lovers and friends, and just how he got those pants so tight, one can't help saying, So what?  Thirty-odd years ago, Peter Berlin dressed provocatively and pointed a camera at himself.  I mean, come on kids -- this ain't AIDS research we're talking about, is it?",1168300800,5,1590,4.951127819548872
2565317,2,B000FGGWJM,"This DVD probably merits two and a half stars. As Peter Berlin came well before my time, it's somewhat difficult to appreciate the impact that he supposedly had on 70's gay culture as it was defined by gay (white) men.
This documentary is a curious artifact of a long-dead cultural moment that is still remembered with fondness by people who were there. Aside from the subject himself, interviewees include author Armistead Maupin, Former porn star Jack Wrangler, Porn director Wakefield Poole, and, best of all, filmmaker John Waters (""Hairspray,"" ""Pink Flamingos"") who provide interesting and insightful comments on the subject, his life and the free-wheeling era of 1970's gay life. Were it not for these interludes, there would certainly not be much of a film.

This documentary traces ad nauseum the life and career (if one could call it that) of a figure who, like many others of the period (see John Rechy) lived through his genitals. Other than that, there is not much more to it. The plethora of photos and footage here convey that Berlin was a gorgeous but often hideously narcisistic specimen (think Dorian Gray, without the angst), who spent his entire life walking, posing and roaming the bars, streets, parks and many other underground gay by-ways of major cities in Europe and, in America, California and New York 24/7. German-born and bred, Berlin was a Tom of Finland cartoon come to life, a would-be porn star (he only made two such films) far less interested in sex than in flagrant exhibitionism and his effect on his rabid fans. In fact, Berlin seems to have aspired to--or been interested in--little else. To his credit, he is frank about his life, philosophy and pursuits and he does not shy from the ravages of age. But his sneering comments about the world being ""boring"" are thuddingly ironic, since he is scarcely touched by anything that does not revolve around himself--the one exception being his apparent loyalty to a live-in companion who eventually died of AIDS. Owing to his brazen self-absorption, he emerges HIV-negative.

All told, neither art (that does not involve him), people, history, culture, nor work of any kind seems to rouse him. His vapidity is sometimes hard to take--especially given that he was a disturbing reminder of how ""little one has to do"" to become famous in America. Now in his sixties and virtually forgotten, Berlin appears to be resigned to his fate, which has the pungent whiff of poetic justice. Summed up, Peter Berlin remains a hermetically-sealed footnote to the so-called gilded age of American gay history.  I would recommend this documentary to hard-core fans. The remotely curious might find it amusing for the bizarre spectacle it provides.",1157760000,14,2713,4.997787610619469
2565318,5,B000FGGWJM,"A brilliant film by Jim Tushinski about a fascinating and unforgetable gay icon. Peter Berlin with his chisled abs, smooth skin, Dutchboy haircut, exaggerated (and self-altered) wardrobe, and unflinching gaze epitomized the boldness and sexual freedom that marked gay life in New York and San Francisco in the years immediately following Stonewall. Often referred to as a porn star, he surprisingly only made two erotic films. But like a true icon, he is remembered more for his still images--photographs taken by Robert Mapplethorp or himself, posters and newspaper ads for his movies, and drawings by Tom of Finland. Some of the most fascinating of these still images are the double exposures he took of himself in which, Narcissus like, he seems to be trying to seduce himself. He was extremely conscious of his ability to attract attention and managed to project both an androgynous and hyper-masculine image. Madonna could learn a lot from him should she ever deign to emerge from whatever glen she is lurking in.

Tushiinski does a great job of blending a generous amount of vintage film footage showing Berlin in his heyday with insightful interview clips from people like Armistead Maupin, Jack Wrangler, Wakefield Poole, and John Waters. Skillfully interwoven with these are interview clips with Berlin himself, alive and well and living in San Francisco. At 60, he dresses the same and looks, well, like an older version of himself. Berlin is comfortable talking about himself and needs no prompting from the director. He even provides the voice-over for much of the film. He speaks about his interactions with Andy Warhol and Mapplethorpe, his inability to make any real money, and his close friends who died from ""the virus."" (His own HIV-negative status is probably attributable to the fact that he enjoyed exhibitionism and seduction more than actual sex.) He is not in denial about growing old. He's honest about his regrets but is neither bitter nor overwhelmed by them. He is and always has been apolitical (declining to be grand marshall of San Francisco's gay pride parade). It's hard to say why he remains such a fascinating figure. Perhaps we just admire (and envy) his unflagging, unrepentent self-love.

This DVD has lots of extras, including a gallery of many of those wonderful still images. The director's commentary is way above average. Fascinating stuff, from beginning to end!",1151539200,35,2406,5.119592875318066
2565319,5,B000FGGWJM,"People are so interesting.  Watching him strut around loving himself, I kind of expected that Peter Berlin might be an arrogant narcissist, but I was happily surprised to find that he's both interesting and endearing as a person.

2565323,3,B000FGGWJM,"If you look up the word ""narcissist"" or ""exhibitionist"" in the dictionary, Peter Berlin's photo is sure to accompany the definition. He is interesting in that he created a complete persona, becoming famous for just being famous long before social media and plethora of reality TV shows. He fit the 1970s gay aesthetic of being tall, very thin, and well-endowed. With his model-like chiseled features and streaky blonde Dutch Boy hair, Berlin was an arresting figure on the streets, a gay icon of the hedonistic, freewheelin' 1970s. He wore skintight pants that showcased his genitalia; this man thrived on being a blatant exhibitionist and garnering attention wherever he trolled, be it the streets of New York or San Francisco, but personality-wise, he didn't seem very sexual or that much interested in sex. He made two gay erotic films, but he was known more for his talent in photography and the photographs he took of himself. He also commissioned Tom of Finland to do beefcake drawings of him. Berlin was a genius at promoting himself, yet he maintained control of his image and did not pursue extreme fame or wealth. He turned down an opportunity to be the face of a famous fashion designer, content to being a famous figure in the gay community.

Comments made by more famous friends and fans like John Waters and Armisted Maupin were very interesting, yet Peter Berlin turned out to be a rather dull, flat interview. He was pretty to look at, but there isn't much personality. Being such a flamboyant visual icon, perhaps Berlin felt no need to develop a personality to match. At times he comes off vapid and self-absorbed in his restrained interviews; perhaps his German upbringing has something to do with his lack of emotion.

This movie was made when Berlin was in his 60s; like Dick Clark, he had aged very little and had managed to hang onto to his slim physique. Yet there was something rather sad about this 60-something man clinging to his past: he still had the Dutch Boy haircut, though his hair was dyed platinum in lieu of the natural streaked blonde, and he still wore the same skintight pants and opened shirts/jackets of his youth. His apartment is a shrine to the seventies, and Berlin seems to be untouched by time, content to remain a walking anachronism of the 1970s. I found the endless clips of Berlin cruising the streets to be rather monotonous; too much repetition. Berlin seems to be an interesting individual but didn't come off that way on film. Tighter editing might have helped, or perhaps a director who could have brought out more emotion in Peter when interviewing him.",1466726400,,2611,4.812917594654788

Even though I admire him , I find his ''look but don't touch'' attitude about sex to be ( as he would say ) BORING. Reminds me of gay men who are gay, but don't have sex. Never understood how you could identify as sexual if you don't have sex.

 MOVIE.  Was really a snapshot of a place and time that have disappeared. The people that inhabited that world are also gone. As older man they are shunned by the younger generation, and never seemed to learn some basic social skills during their heyday.

 Peter Berlin was so many things to so many different people. To many he will be the man with the Tom of Finland crotch.

 It was insightful that he has kept the Peter Berlin look.

2565347,1,B000FGGWJM,Anyone notice that the incorrect image is displayed in the product description to convey a subliminal hate message?  I have found at least a dozen or more of these 'mistaken' images for product descriptions on Amazon. These usually are trying to convey a religious fundamentalist message--typically one of intolerance. This one for instance is homophobic as the image is actually of a movie called Malice and if you watch the trailer it portrays a young girl who is haunted by demons.,1439078400,,484,4.9753086419753085
2565348,4,B000FGGWJM,"Homophobia has always been the first obstacle for many persons to enter the world of ""gay icon"" Peter Berlin, and now it has the same effect on common viewers who abstain to watch -not to mention appreciate- the documentary ""That Man: Peter Berlin"". Second, the perception of what Polish-born baron Armin von Hoyningen-Huene did to himself in the 1970s (that is, creating a character called Peter Berlin, turning it into a fixed figure of the streets of San Francisco, and photographing it himself in erotic images, among other things) as the sole effect of narcissism or exhibitionism, can also dissuade many to watch this motion picture.

Surprisingly (at least for me), Berlin emerges as all that and as someone more interesting, a richer personality and a more complex character. I belong to a generation after his, but I had the opportunity to live the moment when Peter Berlin became a sensation among homosexuals (mostly in the Occident and in the North hemisphere), a historic moment when the fight for the civil rights of all of us who had sexual orientations different from the ""official"" one became more radical, and helped us to define what fronts of our existences urgently needed strategies of defense. (Not all lived marginalized from that historic period, as the cowboys in ""Brokeback Mountain"", a film that takes place in that moment of the evolution of the LGTB movement).

In that context Berlin made himself an object of conceptual art, a performing artist of the notion of sexual desire as an act of observation rather than interaction in erotic ""events"". Although he had his share of those activities through his pornographic films, and personal encounters through his intense social life, most of the time he only teased, attracted, played with emotion, toyed with his surface, like a living painting, an icon of sexual desire that slipped and faded. Today he declares that he became a sort of abstemious sensual machine that rarely had sex with anyone, and preferred to have permanent relationships.

For someone who was not only extremely handsome when free from the demands of his Berlin character, but also successful, travelled and sought after by Richards, Warhol, Mapplethorpe and other avant-garde artists, it is quite moving to hear him talk about the painful aspects of his life, about his difficult journey, from the loss of his father in II World War to the struggles in post-war Europe, the abuse of substances of all kinds, and the disappearance of many friends, including two partners. It is also good to see him at 63 years old (in 2005) with a healthy sense of humor, still with advanced ideas about artistic contemplation, still as schizophrenic as in the 70s: a true survivor who reach a state of consciousness through the ""via negativa"", that feared and risky road to enlightenment, opposed to the ""positive way"" of virtue.

Although this may seem a bit frivolous on my part, I need to comment that I found strange and rare that most of the times director Jim Tushinski deliberately abstained from exposing Peter Berlin's bare penis, which was copiously displayed in his photographs and --apart from his brainwas the actor-model-photographer's most prominent ""source of inspiration"" in his work, and the object of admiration, scorn or envy. On the other hand, not all interviews are interesting: while Robert W. Richards, Daniel Nicoletta and John F. Karr are controlled and intelligent, those by Wakefield Poole or John Waters are not. Otherwise, ""That Man: Peter Berlin"" is a fine work, a testament of one exhilarating time in the evolution of sexual mores and of one of its more prominent figures.",1434067200,,3643,5.016528925619835

2565350,4,B000FGGWJM,"All through my youth and beyond I was fascinated by the image of Peter Berlin or to be more honest, the sight of him in his always skin tight pants. Thanks to this insightful documentary, I have at last learned more about him and his career as one of the gay world's most outrageous exhibitionists. Still remarkably youthful and fit looking for someone of 70, Peter comes across as a pretty regular sort of guy who has lived a very full and satisfying life.  He apparently lived the life he wanted to as a first rate photographer (mainly of himself), mixing in arty circles in Europe and America, making a few early porn movies (with his partner Robert W. Richards, his relationship with the troubled Richards poignantly remembered by Peter) and now living modestly but with a fascinating lifetime of memories to cherish.
Berlin hit his peak in the 1970s taking advantage of the new freedoms of gay sexual liberation. That incredible mop of blond hair, muscular body and sexual prowess always on display made Peter one of the most iconic figures of the gay lifestyle.  And unlike many other exhibitionists, he had the goods worth displaying whether in his tight jeans, thong, see-through tights and shorts, leather or sailor suits, most of which he designed himself. Fans of the Peter Berlin look should try and hunt down a book of his photographs.

Just like indie producers scoff at Scorcese when he says it's ""harder and harder to make good movies without studio interference"", so should anyone who wants to break into being themselves as a business...Mr. Berlin was ahead of his time: he was his own photographer, clothing designer, art director and model.

One critique though - Peter states that he regrets not having done more with his life - I don't agree with this view - when one is art one needn't do more than be. Few of us can justify that. Peter does. Buy this terrific document!,1245801600,,588,4.3545454545454545
2565357,5,B000FGGWJM,"Back in the 80's, I remember seeing photos of Peter Berlin. I was struck by how different he was from other performers. He went out of his way to stand out in the crowd, and he was keenly aware of how clothes (he chose the most skin-hugging/daring outfits) can actually enhance eroticism, as opposed to looking at the male form in full-on nudity.
As this fascinating documentary about a fascinating man states, Berlin was the ultimate artist, using himself as his own ""canvas""...and he did so with striking effect. The face. The body. The clothes. Berlin helped define the 70's gay culture, combining faint androgony with masculinity.
The film explores all the facets of his life, while simultaneously displaying tons of photo stills of Berlin: His youth in Germany; his ""awakening"" in America under the persona of Peter Berlin; the two legendary films he made; his deeply touching 20-year friendship with James; surviving the AIDS crisis; and finally, growing old. For a man in his 60's, he looks almost the same as he did decades ago. Retaining much of his boyish looks, he's in such good shape that he can still wear those same daring outfits!
Chock full of interviews from others (including Berlin himself), this is an intriguing film about an iconic artist who virtually became ""the Greta Garbo of porn"". A must-see!",1243382400,,1321,4.901785714285714
2565358,4,B000FGGWJM,"Peter Berlin was a star in the same sense that Edie Sedgewick and similar personalities were: they were extraordinarily famous within an extremely narrow subculture, but that fame did not translate to broader celebrity.

Born Armin Hagen Freiherr von Hoyningen-Huene in 1942 Germany, Belin trained as a photographer and wandered Europe for several years before arriving in San Francisco.  There he tapped into the city's gay community and reinvented himself as a street icon, instantly recognizeable for his open shirts, obscenely tight pants, and Dutch-Boy haircut.  In 1973 he starred in the X-rated KNIGHTS IN BLACK LEATHER; both the film and Berlin's poster design were widely known.  A year later he starred in yet another X-rated film, THAT MAN; he made four short X-rated films; he was also the star of at least four X-rated ""loops.""  Photographed by Robert Mapplethorpe, drawn by Tom of Finland, he was very much an ""underground"" star.

Berlin, however, had a bit more going for him than an attractive body and a willingness to display it.  At some point Berlin began to do his own art work, most of which involved photographing himself in various stages of far-out attire.  Although his work hardly places him in the same class as, say, Robert Mapplethorpe or Andy Warhol, it did achieve a following, and is still seen today in various exhibitions, collections, and displays. But time was against him: his favorite subject, his own body, passed its peak of perfection--and in the 1980s AIDS began to unravel the gay culture that had made his celebrity possible.

Created in 2005 by Jim Tushinski, THAT MAN: PETER BERLIN is a portrait of Berlin both then and now, featuring interviews with such notable gay men as John Waters and Armistead Maupin--but most particularly with Berlin himself, who emerges as an odd mixture of blankness, narcissim, and hard-core realist.  Sometimes described by interview subjects as ""Garbo-esque"" for the distance he imposes between himself and others, Berlin now passes his days in casual obscurity, recognized occasionally on the streets by old fans, self-absorbed but far from self-pitying, still interested in the art for which he is his own canvass.

The DVD comes with a number of bonuses, most particularly the images created by Berlin, additional interview materials, and a director's commentary.  Berlin's celebrity is very much of a certain place and time, and his personality is not easily evaluated--but he is indeed an icon on an era in the gay community, a brief window in time during which anything seemed possible in the city by the bay.  Recommended.

Where are the models today, that can match this guy's style? One who has no inhibitions and lays it all out there. Legend.",1514505600,,277,4.450980392156863
8122438,5,B000FGGWJM,"This film was absolutely fantastic.  His chosen persona (German to the nth degree, Prince Valiant haircut, perfectly proportioned body, great legs and ass, the best bulge out there) burned itself onto my retinae the first time I saw it.  It was a one of a kind of image, and it surely ranks among the most iconic images in all the world of sexual imagery (I see him as much more than a porn star.).  There is so much to see here of those images, and that, in and of itself, makes this film worth watching, but in addition, you have interviews with several famous people from the same circles Peter traveled in, as well as a thoughtful, honest, and intelligent interview with the man himself.  He is a fascinating figure, still looks very beautiful, with just right touch of vanity, and I would love to just sit and talk with him.  The stories must be endless...",1511827200,,861,4.493589743589744

PETER BERLIN DOCUMENTARY

Brilliant!
One of the best documentaries I have ever seen.  This is rare jewel of a documentary about a strong,  complex, fascinating man who stays true to himself and lives his life to the fullest.
He  is to me an inspiration and a reminder of how much life there is out there to be lived.  Peter seems to embody two things,  the song from the 1975 movie, The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Dont Dream It Be It.
And a tag line from the 1958 movie,  Auntie Mame: Life is a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death. Peter seems to have had and still has a very good  seat at the banquet.
Dziki, Peter.  Thank you.
And to the top negative reviewer, Luv, jealously is such an ugly colour, it normally doesnt go with anything, but it goes perfectly with that snarky outfit you're wearing.

8122446,4,B000FGGWJM,"The cinematic biography of Peter Berlin is a diving in the beginnings of erotic gay male cinematic world of the seventies. I myself remember him as an Icon of the times, even though he didn't engage in proper hard core films. Thats perhaps why he was spared of AIDS epidemics, and can give a live presence in this doc. The film is interesting in many aspects, the most important of them being to give the ambiance in which gay people then lived. It was not necessary to be explicit to be erotic, and the film explores that.
The testimony of Berlin is a high point for the film. Hes a completely free soul, living from the grace of his friends and entering his sixties still with sex appeal. We are introduced to the main films he recorded at the time, very ingenuous for todays standards.
All in all, its a pleasant memoir to watch.",1479945600,,832,4.409090909090909
