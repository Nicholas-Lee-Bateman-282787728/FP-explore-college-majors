3676936,4,B001L1S1PI,"Yes, FOX is clearly anxious to get into the HD & Blu-Ray world, and thinks it will be more lucrative, or at least stir up more interest. I must admit I would rather buy this season than the seasons 13-19, because the HD HAS ADDED A LOT! (though only about half the season is actually HD). Not just the incredible detail, which is considerable (have you noticed the backgrounds? the finally updated opening??), but also the new visual details seem to have inspired the writing a bit. I found ""How the Test Was Won"" quite funny, as well as ""No Loan Again"". If you haven't seen the new HD Simpsons, it's worth checking out. But I don't know about the extras situation, and will be waiting to see what all is offered, not to mention the packaging complaint. They have GOT to get something more disc-friendly, though I fear the recent ""The Beatles Remastered"" sleeve treatment will not help our cause here.

But really, the HD has been something of a revelation to me, and given me hope that the Simpsons could actually continue to reinvent itself to greatness. Though, I would agree in general with others, that seasons 1 - 6 are must see; seasons 7 - 10 are still worth getting though quality-level trails off; after that, until season 20, not so good (is this why they've skipped ahead, admitting their sub-par quality past 7 seasons?)

Lets face it, The Simpsons writers have been coasting the last 7 years or so, falling into the usual long-run sitcom traps: bringing in lots of favorite ""guest stars"" usually playing themselves in a bald-faced attempt to garner the affection, or at least attention, of the youth (not unlike the old-time stars Milton Berle or Walter Matthau going on Saturday Night Live to host); regurgitating old plot-lines and coming up with ones so ridiculous even the characters are written a line to acknowledge the absurdity; and, as Simpsons acknowledged head-on in the episode ""The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show"", added characters to enliven the already buldging cast, like: Homer's mom, Arnie Ziff, Apu's wife and eight children; and of course, many, many road trips: Japan, Scotland, Hawaii, etc; which is also acknowledged with the wink of ""The Simpons are going to..."".

I'd like to see more of the bizarre episodes left to Halloween (Treehouse of Terror) and more relational/situational humor, like earlier season episodes (Lisa's Substitute, Separate Vocations, Lisa the Geek, I Married Marge, Saturdays of Thunder, etc;). OK, I'm done ranting.",1261872000,5,2479,4.883610451306414
3676937,2,B001L1S1PI,"Why is Fox even releasing the twentieth season? The only special feature on the entire set is a ""SNEAK PEEK"" of the Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special, directed by Morgan Spurlock.
What I ask is how they call it a sneak peek when the special airs two days before the release of this boxset.  Thay have got geniuses working at FOX I presume.
No other features are available!!!  I find this ridiculous of a season boxset to be released with no features whatsoever. If so, it should cost a fair amount less.

Don't buy this fans, FOX is stiffing you, simply for the money!!",1261267200,62,569,4.504854368932039
3676938,3,B001L1S1PI,"Not really a review, although I did like some of the gags in Season 20 while others left me scratching my head, but I thought I'd point out the obvious reason why they skipped from Season 12 to Season 20 in the DVD releases. Fox is making a big deal about celebrating the show's 20th anniversary. In fact, the 20th Anniversary Special airs January 10, two days before this release. 20th Anniversary - 20th Season. As Homer might say, ""Well duh!""",1259712000,5,445,4.506172839506172
3676939,3,B001L1S1PI,"The Simpsons have been around for more than 20 years now and it`s safe to say that if you ever surfed your television you came across them.  It paved the way for other animated comedy shows of its genre, it has more than 400 episodes to its credit, won a few awards, it`s been on air since seemingly forever and there`s plenty more to say about it. There have been some complaints about the decline of the show ever since the beginning the 00`s. It`s hard to pick a season where the decline really began but it is true that the show is not as good as it was I`ll admit it, but I think it`s still good and I still enjoy it. Since some time each season has a few great episodes mixed with a few good ones and some not-so-good one, season 20 is no different.

Now I won`t be doing an episode list because some other reviewers will take care of that. But I really liked a few episodes like ""Eeny Teeny Maya Moe"" in which Moe has a new romance, ""No Loan Again, Naturally"" was great with Ned Flanders helping the Simpsons trough difficult time as they reached bankruptcy and this season`s ""Treehouse of Horror XIX"" was very good and the allusion to Charlie Brown was brilliant. The worst episode of this season is perhaps the worst in the show`s history ""Four Great Women and a Manicure"" , another Simpsons twist on history but this one proves to be the worst yet. The season was mostly good.

You will notice a change in the visual style of the show, it is pretty much the same but somehow it's different. It features more technology which turns out to be very funny and the visual style has changed a little it's like the show has gotten a facelift, and I don't think it hurt after so many years you're bound to change at some point. You will also notice the new title sequence for the show, I like it but I miss Homer's scream from the original! The Simpsons are now in HD and it looks very good. I`d like to think that the box of this season will be different than season 11 and 12`s accordion style but no one really knows now.  They should really consider doing something else or return to the older boxes format I never hear anyone complain about those. I know how they want to do an eco-friendly packaging but it`s obviously not a hit with most fans, it didn`t look so good and I didn`t like how it scratched my discs and I`m sure I wasn`t the only one.

Season 20 is not bad really but it just doesn't compare well to the earlier seasons. I don't laugh as I much as I used to while watching the show but I still find it entertaining and worth watching. There were some very good episodes and this season was better than a few of the previous ones. I don't know why they are releasing this one ahead of the others (13-19), yes it's the 20th anniversary but still this will make some fans angry. I'll give season 20 three stars it was a good season. So will I be buying? Well yes because it's still better than no Simpsons in my opinion and if you don't like the show at this point then don't bother with it that's all.",1257811200,12,3020,4.227036395147314

If you just want the Simpsons episodes with-out any extras then I don't recommend paying more than $10 for this on blu-ray or DVD as I suspect Fox will do a re-release with all the missing extras after they release all of the previous seasons. The blu-ray packaging was lacking any extras like concept art and full episode synopses that previous season releases have all included. Similarly there is no introduction from the Simpson creator Matt Groening, or any commentators and special features when every other season release had commentaries on every episode, deleted scenes, and concept art. This was clearly a rushed release meant to capitalize on the 20th anniversary of the Simpsons. I waited years for this to finally drop below $20, only to be slighted by Fox by purchasing episodes I have already scene on the TV/internet with absolutely no extra content.

3677205,3,B001L1S1PI,"I haven't watched The Simpsons on TV in a long time, since I got rid of cable/satellite, so I was excited to get this set!
The episodes are funny, BUT...
This Blu-ray set has disappointed me in a couple ways:

1) Most of my Blu-ray discs can be stopped, the player turned off, then restarted, and the disc will resume where it was stopped. This set DOES NOT RESUME. Instead, it plays back to the beginning (all the way back to the parts that include ""Copyright"" or ""FBI/piracy Warning""). I've found that only the cheaper-quality Blu-ray discs do this.

2) This season is where they introduced the new Opening Credits to the show, which doesn't start until about the 12th episode of this season (season 20). Sadly, the episodes on Disc One (which are all episodes that still featured the old style of Opening Credits) is a bit SQUISHED to appear as if you are watching a non-wide screen TV. What I mean is that you are watching a square (the show) with two thick black vertical bars on either side of the episode.
I don't understand why the disc maker allowed this, since this ""squishing"" does NOT occur when watching the regular Simpsons DVDs on a widescreen TV.

I have not viewed any of the recent Blu-ray versions of Seasons 14 and 15, but I hope they have corrected the issues that I mentioned above. I do own the regular versions of these two seasons and CAN vouch for their good quality.

Anyway, I hope that this season will eventually come out as part of the regular Simpsons DVD sets. Good luck to us all, or we'll be shouting ""D'OH!""",1370304000,5,1543,4.480427046263345

The only reason I buy the other seasons past season 14 anyways is for the commentaries to see what they could have been thinking.

There are only two special features: hard-drawn menus by Matt Groening and a 20th Anniversary Sneak Peek video.  Whoopie.  And half of the episodes are available as a widescreen format.

Shoot, just release the past episodes and include a link to future commentaries on mp3 in with the boxset.

Each previous release was loaded with extras like commentaries, deleted scenes etc which made them seem like value for money, even when the episodes lost some of their replay value and the laughs became fewer and further between. So what does Season 20 offer in terms of in terms of extras, laughs and value for money? Nothing, not much and bugger all.
I don't know what the excuse could possibly be- Fox have no respect for their customers? They left the work experience kid in charge of this release? They figure no one's watching anymore so why bother??

I cannot lie, some of the episodes were not that good, and I find myself watching season 1-10 more often; but my love has not wavered.

Comparing this season to previous seasons of the Simpson would result in a lower rating. The thing is it is still better than 75% of sitcoms and pretty much every other animation. The writers seem to be tying hard, whereas in other season laughs came freely; I got the feeling everything was forced. Some episodes seem like they should have been featured on seasons way before this, they were really stale. It seems after season 17 or so, they started to incorporate more episodes centered around Lisa; they should know by now Lisa is not funny, she is just annoying. There are still plenty of parodies and hi-jinks for Homer to be subjected to.

The way in which this season was released was just wrong. It cost more than any other season that has been released but features nothing special. Half of the season is regular and then it shifts into HD; why not just do all the episodes that way upon release? I know it is suppose to be a milestone ""the 20th season"" but it was lackluster and if they intend on re-releasing this season with all the extras; they suck.",1295049600,2,1359,4.410358565737051

Whenever I have money I buy the DVD box sets and watch them ad nauseum.  People hate watching the show with me because I have so many episodes memorized.  I can think of a relevant Simpsons quote or episode for any situation.  I LOVE the Simpsons.  Despite my limited funds (i.e.: I can't afford cable), I have scraped together enough over the years to buy the first 13 seasons, which are all impeccable, in my opinion.  Buy them, they are awesome.  You will love them.

However... I recently purchased the 20th Season of my favourite show, (it was on sale! woot!) and couldn't wait to get home to watch it.  And, well, really I don't even know what to make of it.  Product placement, completely ridiculous and stupid plot twists, and - bottom line - NOT FUNNY AT ALL.  I'm usually smiling and chuckling my way through every episode, filling in half the dialogue, etc.  Not with Season 20.  It's a rare thing if I even crack a smile during an entire episode of Season 20.  My husband and I were pointing out funny parts to each other, but not in our usually ""man, that whole scene rocks!"" kind of way, but in the rare-bird-siting way (""Hey! That part was kind of funny!""  ""Yeah, kind of!"")  I actually fell asleep watching one I hadn't seen before!  This is unheard of!!!!  It was like a completely different show.  An unfunny, lame and stupid version of the Simpsons.  What happened??

As someone who's been in love with the Simpsons for over 20 years I feel completely betrayed.  As I said, I can't afford cable, so I haven't seen many recent episodes, but I've been steadily buying the box sets for the past 5 years (and watching them so often that they're starting to skip) and now I don't know what to do.

*********Could somebody please tell me at which season the creators of the Simpsons decided to completely sell out and destroy my favourite show, so that I can stop buying the box sets?  Seasons 1-13 are excellent.  Season 20 blows big fat hairy goats.  So somewhere between Seasons 13 and 20 something happened.  Please, SOMEBODY tell me when this grotesque transformation took place so that I can halt my purchasing after the last good season.*********

3677285,1,B001L1S1PI,"Like others have said, the 20th season of the Simpsons should be something special and it's actually just the opposite. The Simpsons DVDs have always boasted that they are better because every episode has commentary, and interesting commentary at that. However, this set must have been really rushed because there are no deleted scenes, no animatics, and no commentaries. The only ""special feature"" is the Morgan Spurlock documentary, which wasn't even that great.

Not only should most fans (and collectors of the series) be horribly disappointed, but Fox and Matt Groening should be ashamed.

To top the whole thing off, the DVDs are shoddily produced. The first time I put in disc 1 it skipped randomly. Upon inspection, the back of the disc (all of the discs, actually) had residue that looked like ink from the stupid accordion-style case. I actually had to clean and gently clear off my DVDs before I could even watch them all the way through.

Very, very disappointing. It's amazing even comparing seasons 13 and 20, which were released in the same year, 13 is carefully done (in the same crappy packaging) with extras and not disc problems, yet it's pretty obvious that greedy Fox really didn't give two craps about season 20, they just wanted to get it out and make as much money as possible.",1287360000,,1301,4.851351351351352

3677288,4,B001L1S1PI,"First, I am a huge fan of the Simpsons. The wrtiting teams of today leave a little to be desired from earlier seasons(about 11 and down). Regardless, I still think it's one of the better shows on network.

Second, I regret not reading the reviews on Amazon before impulsivly buying this in store just before Season 13 was released. As stated before, no, there are no commentaries or deleted scenes with this boxset. The previous seasons' commentaries included in previous boxsets were rather hilarious, and I was a little disappointed that these were not included for Season 20. Still the just released Season 13 included both basic special features and more. I believe Fox is trying to catch up by releasing boxsets from both ends of the series. It would be a good idea if they weren't cutting effort in one release just to hold off fans until the next season is released. One minor note, the ""enviromental friendly"" packaging now used in Simpsons/Futurama boxsets is somehow less annoying. The cardboard sleeves to store the DVDs seem to be much loose. The last Simpsons boxset that came with this packaging was insanely tight, causing dvds to easily get scratched removing them. This no longer seems to be the case. It's still the same container, just redesigned for convenient/less damaging storage.

Overall, if you're a fan of the later seasons and not too concerned for special features, this is a great buy. For other fans, you'll be disappointed in the lack of content for the price. Honestly, it seems fair for a bare-bones season for anything less than $25, just let it be known what is/isn't offered in the boxset.",1282694400,,1626,4.82437275985663

3677292,5,B001L1S1PI,"FIRST, my opinion about the program:  I really get a kick out of the Simpsons, and the fact that some extras, such as commentary by Matt Groening, are missing from this set is no problem for me.  What I care about is the program itself, and I find that hearing the creator ramble on about his wonderful creativity just detracts from my enjoyment of the show.  So if, like me, you mainly want to watch more Simpsons ASAP, go for it!

NOW, my rant:  CULTURAL DEVOLUTION. The packaging of these DVDs is further evidence of the decline of our culture.  Surely professional marketers have scientifically surveyed consumers and determined they prefer fancy, dysfunctional packaging of DVDs over plainer, convenient and functional packaging.  But I am not one of those stupid consumers.  I want to store my DVDs in packaging that protects them and makes them easily accessible; this is my primary criterion for evaluating packaging.  Unfortunately, the packaging of these DVDs, like the packaging of the majority of DVDs in my collection, is extremely inconvenient to use.  To get to these DVDs, first, I must slide the carton out of a plastic sleeve.  Then, I must open the flap on the carton and extract the accordion-style packaging of the DVDs.  This innermost packaging has the DVDs stored in connected cardboard sleeves, making it awkward to get to the individual discs, and making it likely the consumer will put scratches on the DVDs when removing and replacing them.  And the fact that the packaging is fancy, expensive, and adorned with images of the Simpsons only makes matters worse because it is obvious that a significant amount of money was spent to create a package that is annoying and likely to damage the product itself.  What a stupid waste of money!  And what a tragic way to package a product that should last many decades if it is handled properly.

In fairness, the packaging of these DVDs is no worse than many other DVDs in my collection.  But the fact that some other reviewers of this set of DVDs complained about the packaging prompted me to add my two cents.  But I suppose the real culprits are not the marketing professionals who are providing consumers with what they want. No, the real culprits are the stupid consumers themselves, who prefer things fancy and dysfunctional, such as the common practice of adjusting widescreen televisions to have a non-wide image stretched horizontally to fill the wide screen, preferring to see images stretched and distorted horizontally rather than seeing proper images with some unused screen at the left and right edges of the screen.  And how about the stupid majority of consumers who prefer a wide computer monitor that matches widescreen DVD movie images but which is compressed vertically, reducing the amount of a word-processing document or spreadsheet or a webpage that can be seen without scrolling.  As if the primary activity on a PC is watching DVDs!  I tell ya, the decline of the United States in the world community...  oh, never mind.",1273881600,9,3016,4.884086444007859

3677294,1,B001L1S1PI,Plain and simple..... the joke for packaging for this set is pure cheap business on FOX's part. They charge top dollar to us but give junk that scratches the discs on the first time you have to pull them from the packaging. The greed coming from US and world business owners is getting old. There is just no actual care for the products or people anymore. JUST $$$$$$$$$,1273449600,7,370,4.455882352941177
3677295,2,B001L1S1PI,"This DVD has all of the episodes from the 20th season. Twenty seasons is a milestone for any endeavor. For a TV show it means nearly a generation (~25 years) of people have grown up with it - so it is clearly a cultural force.

This season while not as good as the earlier ones (many argue that seasons 5-10 are the best) but still it has good moments: ""Four Great Women and a Manicure"", ""Gone Maggie Gone"", ""How the Test was Won"".

What is horrible is the terrible packaging - the weird accordion cardboard sleeves are not just impractical do they really save any money?
There are NO items usually found with a DVD. There are NO commentaries. There are NO deleted seasons. There are NO easter eggs.

If this were the Krusty the Clown 20th anniversary DVD created by Krusty Co and produced by Roger C. Meyers Jr. we'd all understand. But come on - Matt Groening, James L.

I'm the biggest Simpsons fan ever. But they really did cut corners to get this realeased. I don't really care about the commentaries. I care about the cheap packaging. The discs just slide in cardboard slots. I've taken them out 2 times and they are allready starting to skip. I had to put them into different cases. Now the box just sits here with no discs in it. It'll get thrown to the side to collect dust after while. Also, I don't like the etch-a-sketch look alike pictures that grace the top of the episode selection pages.

I ended up deciding that I would rent it off Netflicks first.  Boy, I'm glad I did that!! Netflicks only sends out one DVD at a time and after watching two discs, I deleted the other discs of my list! First of all there is no commentary. I know some don't even care for the commentary, but being a Simpson fan that I am, I like to watch the episode, then watch it again with commentary on. Also, there are no extras-just the regular episodes. I agree with the other reviewers: this season just sucks!! I will wait to see if they re-release this season later with all the extras that the other seasons have.",1268697600,5,877,4.214285714285714
3677302,2,B001L1S1PI,"I consider myself to be a dedicated fan of The Simpsons. I have watched it since it's first airing more than 20 years ago. Suffice to say, when the 20th Anniversary Edition was being released, I was excited. I knew they were doing this particularly for the switch to HD, but I was also excited about having a new season in my hot little hands. Unfortunately, the release was shortsighted and poorly executed. Firstly, the packaging is terrible, just as Seasons 12 and 13. It is difficult to retrieve discs from the cardboard slots, and I swear every time I remove the disc I'm afraid it's going to get scratched. Along with this, the outer packaging is annoying. You have the white sleeve, which is easy enough to remove, but then the cardboard case is closed on both sides. You have to open the flap, remove the accordion DVD holder inside, and then fight with the tight cardboard sleeves to remove the disc itself. It seems as if the creators almost want to keep me from watching their later seasons. It may not be so, but it does feel that way.

Secondly, the features are non-existent. I knew this when purchasing the DVD set, but I didn't know that ""No commentaries"" also meant absolutely nothing at all but a sneak peak trailer of a TV event I watched before the set was released. What kind of thinking is this? Even if it's rushed, they can't put anything else on the DVD to let the fans know they still care? Honestly, if they could put a sneak peak trailer on the set, why not a few text bios? How long could it possibly take to add a handful of text bios, even about just the main characters? This lack of foresight has cost them some of my good will. I love The Simpsons, but I don't tolerate being cheated or taken for granted.

Now, onto the series itself.

I love The Simpsons, I do. They have been a constant in my life since I was a child, and they still make me laugh. Yes, the quality has slid somewhat, but to me, a ""bad"" Simpsons episode is still better than most ""good"" sitcoms. I think the problem lies in the fact that we've seen it all before. We know what's going to happen, so the best thing is to just take pleasure in the characters themselves. Unfortunately for some, myself included, the characters have been given the bum's rush as well. Homer went from a deeply flawed but caring father and husband to an apathetic shadow of his former self. He went from ""bumbling, good natured oaf"" to sadistic, selfish egotist. Why did that have to happen? The great thing about cartoons is that they don't age, that they don't need to face the realities we do every day. I love The Simpsons because they could take an unpleasant reality and turn it on it's head. Homer having a heart attack shouldn't be a topic found to be funny in most sitcoms, but on The Simpsons, the execution was so well done that I couldn't help but laugh at the situation. That is excellent writing. It's the mark of a truly great production. I haven't seen that kind of heart from The Simpsons for years, including the 20th season (this set). However, that does seem to be changing now, and I look forward to a rejuvenated Simpsons.

To summarize:

* Fair to middling episode quality (for the Simpsons)
* Terrible Packaging
* No extra features whatsoever

Is it worth $19.99 (pricing at the time of this review)? I think so.

Final Rating:
2 out of 5 stars.

3677303,4,B001L1S1PI,Even after 20 years the show is still good and funny. I just wish this DVD came with some more special features. I am still glad to have it because it is still a very funny show. I'm sure it will get re release in the future but for now this will have to do. Also the packaging is not that good but I guess it could be worst. I think 4 out of 5 is fair and I hope it still sells OK. Enjoy!,1268265600,,389,3.588235294117647
3677304,4,B001L1S1PI,"While I am pleased to have the first season of The Simpsons to be released on Blu-ray, it is very disappointing that the set is completely lacking features... no extras, no commentaries, no nothing.  It could have been a five-star, but D'oh!",1267920000,,241,4.738095238095238
3677305,2,B001L1S1PI,"I was VERY disappointed in the quality of the packaging and production of this DVD set. Just opening the box was cumbersome!  I took the cellophane off, slipped off the slip-sleeve, and then stared in wonder about what to do next.  There was no indication as to how to open the box, and I very nearly tore it up trying to open it.  Strike one.

Over the years, the Simpsons DVD sets have come out with increasingly cleverly themed packaging with funny in-jokes related to the episodes.  After (finally) opening the box I found no such thought or cleverness.  Just the five big faces of the Simpsons family staring up at fireworks. A gave a very unenthusiastic ""Woo-hoo."" Strike two.

I popped in the first DVD, ready to hear Matt Groening's introduction where he tells us how wonderful this season is, who all the guest stars are, and what features we could expect.  Apparently he didn't think much of it, because he didn't even bother. When I finished the first episode, I immediately started it over to watch it with the commentary, just like I usually do.  What?  No commentary?  On ANY episodes???  I must admit I was surprised that the makers of the Simpsons faithfully did commentary on every episode through season 12.  I expected that they would eventually back off and just do commentary on key episodes.  But to just drop off entirely WITHOUT A SINGLE ONE???  Inconceivable! And yes, that word means exactly what I think it means.  The last kick in the pants is, where previous seasons had LOADS of extra features, this one has one: a ""Twentieth Anniversary Special Sneak Peak"".  Booooor-iiiiiing!  A very big strike three.

This is nowhere near the value of previous seasons of the Simpsons.  If you MUST get it, wait until it goes on deep discount.  Believe me, it will.",1267747200,3,1782,4.683870967741935

If you look closely into the amount of disk space being used for each episode, they've used as much as possible to guarantee an affordable 'hi-def' experience to the DVD buyers.

So, take what you can get.  Either that, or wait seven years or so for it to come out on DVD.  Chances are it'll end up being the same.",1267660800,,518,4.288659793814433

I did by this knowing that there was no extra content but fearful that this will no be released again so picked it up anyways. I'm am not sure if its just my copy but it skips. Fresh from the box and a DVD player that cause no issues with other movies I play.

While I continue to love the show (despite the fact that they've lost at least one step from their prime some years back), this was the first time I've felt disappointed, and even ripped off, by a Simpsons release.

No commentaries?  No deleted scenes?  No storyboards or other in-depth analysis?  No fair!

This was, in plain terms, a pathetic rush-to-market release that is a disservice to loyal Simpsons fans.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.

I still give it three stars because after all, it's the Simpsons.  But when you combine the fact that these are late-era shows with no extra features, it's really 2 1/2 stars rounded up.

They know this as well as we do, hence why they've skipped the release of seasons 13-19 to release season 20.

True that many of these episodes won't replace our favorites from earlier seasons, but some of the roots of Simpsons writing has been reclaimed and the risks that they took in these shows really paid off.",1267142400,2,659,4.559322033898305

3677327,5,B001L1S1PI,"The Simpsons had been on a steep decline for many years with almost each new episode being as bad as it possibly could be. I guess the writers were far too preoccupied with the street-cred they gained by actually being Simpsons writers instead of coming up with good storylines. Season 20 remedies all that by giving us some of the best-written episodes yet with better use of the extensive cast and a greater sense of continuity. Each episode has several laugh out loud moments and is truly a joy.

However 20th Century Fox ought to be ashamed for releasing such a shoddy box set. There are NO EXTRAS (sorry, but a 3-minute preview of a potential extra is NOT an extra itself). No commentaries. Nothing! For a landmark 20th season they've given us no landmark release.

Like many of us, Fox will  not be getting my money for this joke of a release... Give us the features. Give us the commentaries. 20th Season and nothing? Are they serious?

Come on Fox, a multi-billion dollar corporation and you can't find the time (or dignity) to create a fantastic release to celebrate 20 years of laughs and fun?

If you are upset like the most of us, I strongly urge you to write a review about this release -heck, just submit a vote of 1 star. As of right now, the reviews are quite negative -and  given the situation at hand, that's a good thing because it shows that true fans like ourselves, won't give in to half assed releases such as this one.

(Released January 12, 2010 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment)
Another Looong DVD Review by Joe Torcivia

Once upon a time, when reviewing The Simpsons on DVD, I wrote the following:

If there were a single DVD product that consistently stands above the rest, it would be each and every release of THE SIMPSONS!

Indeed, every review I could write would sound the same.  The episodes are always great, and no series offers more in the way of extra features and general quality!

That was then.  This is now...

The Simpsons: The Complete 20th Season - Blu-Ray Edition marked my first Blu-ray DVD purchase.  I knew going in that about only HALF the 20th Season was produced for HD broadcast and, thus, only half the set would be fully Blu-ray capable.  To view this any other way would be unfairly critical.  However, many unexpectedly unpleasant surprises were to be found therein.

Which takes us to our customary list of CONS and PROS.

The CONS:

Only Half a Season of HD:  But, again, this is known to any fan of the show.

The Special Features:  Each previous SIMPSONS set offered most if not all of the following:

* Commentaries with writers, directors, producers, and actors on EVERY EPISODE.

* Creator Matt Groening's Introductory Feature for each Season Set - discussing the high points and guest stars.

* Animated menus that reflected the contents of each disc.

* A detailed and lavishly illustrated BOOKLET, listing the contents of the set, original airdates, and other notable aspects of each episode.

* Deleted scenes. Offered as ""Stand Alone"" (with optional commentary) or, with a touch of your remote, integrated into their intended spots as part of the episodes.

* Selected storyboards and animatics.

* Easter Eggs, offering hidden surprises.

Unless I've yet to uncover some E-Eggs, none of this is included with The Simpsons: The Complete 20th Season - Blu-Ray Edition!

There is a bare-bones listing of episode titles, listed by disc, and a PROMO for FOX TV's Simpsons 20th anniversary special.  Not the special, mind you.  That might have been welcome.  Nope!  We get only the promo FOR the special, which is billed as a ""Special Feature"". Nothing else!

The PROS:

The Half Season of HD:  The Standard Definition episodes of The Simpsons: The Complete 20th Season - Blu-Ray Edition look great!  The High Definition episodes, however, fill the entire screen with bright, sharp, and vivid colors!  It is like no Simpsons I've ever seen before!

The Packaging:  The Season 11 and Season 12 sets were simply awful in their packaging.  The packaging for The Simpsons: The Complete 20th Season - Blu-Ray Edition has reversed that unfortunate trend and provided more conventional and sturdy protective packaging.

And, of course, the biggest PRO of any Simpsons set...

The Episodes:  Over and over, the Internet continues to drone on about how The Simpsons is no longer funny.  Not so, as this current batch proves.

Here are the some highlights (Beware of VERY MILD SPOILERS):

""HD"" denotes the episode is in High Definition.

""Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes"" Marge unknowingly works for an erotic bakery, while Homer and Flanders become bounty hunters!  What a way to start a season!

""Treehouse of Horror XIX"" Voting machines with minds of their own, transforming lethal household objects, dead celebrity product endorsements, an unbelievable send-up of ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown!"", and even a cleverly constructed parody of the opening of MAD MEN are among the delights of our annual Halloween episode.

""Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words"" Lisa finds a new passion - The New York Times Crossword Puzzle. Times Crossword editor Will Shortz appears as himself.  Perhaps ""Hard Luck Gil's"" only great moment!

 ""Mypods and Broomsticks"" Two great stories in one episode. Lisa overindulges in her new ""myPod"", receives a massive bill for music downloads, and pleads with ""Steve Mobs"" (at his idyllic, underwater compound) to forgive the debt.  Bart befriends an Arabic boy, and Homer immediately suspects his father of being a terrorist.  Unfortunately for all, he sets out to prove it... as only he can!  Great climax!

""The Burns and the Bees"" Lisa establishes a bee colony and Mr. Burns plans to build a mega-arena for his new professional basketball team on that very site.  Opens with a special Christmas / Holiday / Winter variation of the usual opening title sequence.  Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and sportscaster Marv Albert play themselves.

""Take My Life, Please"" (HD) Homer blames his failure to be elected High School Class President as the reason he is not included in Springfield's ""Wall of Fame"" - an all-inclusive monument to the town's achievers that includes even Poochie!  This is the first HD episode.

""How the Test was Won"" (HD) Lisa frets over a standardized test. Skinner and his school's underachievers have an adventure in Capital City. Homer forgets to mail his property insurance payment.  This bit culminates in a hilarious climax that injures a passing Mr. Burns... just in the nick of time for the insurance to pay the damages.

""Gone Maggie Gone"" (HD) With Marge temporarily blinded, Homer accidentally allows Maggie to be claimed by an ancient order of nuns.  Lisa infiltrates the order to reclaim her sister, leading to a ""Di Vinci Code-like"" adventure concerning one of Springfield's landmarks.  Hysterical ending, confirming everything we've ever suspected about Bart.

""In the Name of the Grandfather"" (HD) Homer and Grandpa Simpson end up owning an old Irish Pub, and try to make it work in modern day Ireland.  Lots of great ""Irish parody"" names of well known chain stores, businesses, and products.

""Four Great Women and a Manicure"" (HD) Marge takes Lisa for her first nail salon manicure.  This serves as a backdrop for the pair to tell female-centric stories.  Highlight: The story of Lisa as ""Snow White"", with Homer, Moe, Barney, Lenny, Kearney, Dr. Hibbard, and Mr. Burns as the dwarfs - with a great ""Hi-Ho"" parody song and the expected jabs at Disney lawyers.

""Coming to Homerica"" (HD) The Swedes of neighboring Ogdenville invade Springfield when O-ville's barley-based economy tanks.  At first, they are welcome. But soon, Springfield is gripped by anti ""Barley Jack"" hysteria. A great commentary on the nation's immigration controversy.

OVERALL:  The Simpsons: The Complete 20th Season - Blu-Ray Edition delivers a remarkable amount of entertainment and laughs for a series that's been around, non-stop for two decades.  And the half season's worth of HD episodes are magnificent!

However, weighing this set's disappointments vs. the high standards that the series sets have previously maintained, I cannot give it a high recommendation.

Enjoy it for what it is, but never lose sight of what it could have been.  D'OH!",1265241600,,6873,5.0579322638146165
3677332,4,B001L1S1PI,"Okay, everyone and their mother need to stop their bitching about Season 20 and the dvd releases in general.  Stop about the packaging nonsense, stop about the episode quality, stop about the price and bonus features and how incredibly long they take to come out- stop all of it. Us Simpsons ""fans"" cant seem to make up our damn minds; do you want to wait until were all 50 to have all of the seasons to own? or do we want them as fast as they possibly can? Do you really truly care about the extras? Or, like me, just want the episodes officially? We cant have it both ways. I agree that this set should have been made cheaper considering, but that is my only gripe. Also, again you ""fans"" out there seem to have ignored or not noticed the fact that nowhere on the box does it say the words ""Collectors Edition"" like EVERY OTHER  YEAR 1-12 DOES! So, I'm sure they will be getting around to putting out a season 20 ""Collectors Ed,"" but you'll all have to wait until sometime in the next four to five years to get it.

3677333,2,B001L1S1PI,"I wish I hadn't bought this season. The simpsons dvds are usually so well done.  But with this release they've gone from being the best to worst then the rest. There are no commentaries at all, and no special features. This is no way to celebrate 20 years on the air. The packaging is the cardboard acordian.  I can't wait for the corners to come unglued and the disks to fall out, like they do on the other seasons with this packaing. I'm totally frustrated. I  will never preorder a season of the simpson's again.",1264723200,3,515,4.4
3677334,1,B001L1S1PI,"I have just watched the first disc of this season and came to look on my computer to find out what was going on.  Where are the commentaries?!  Fox has never given the Simpsons any respect and they've gotten cheaper and cheaper with the packaging as each new season comes out, but at least they still had commentaries and other extras.  I know Matt and the rest of the staff who create ""The Simpsons"" probably have little say as to what merchandise or other things Fox puts out concerning the show.  I would hope they would at least voice their opposition to Fox for screwing over the people who made them all rich and who have kept the show on the air for so long-- the fans of The Simpsons.

I'm so glad I only rented these from Netflix.  I will not buy this season and, if they continue to release future DVDs in such a cheap and shoddy way, I guess I'll stop my collection at Season 12.",1264636800,6,890,4.236686390532545
3677335,3,B001L1S1PI,"As fans of ""The Simpsons"" know, the producers have been releasing excellent DVD sets of the show's initial seasons, with the first 12 seasons now available.  To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the show, they jumped ahead in the sequence and released this 20th season set.  Not a bad idea.  However, as other reviewers have noted, this set seems hastily put together and includes no commentaries, deleted scenes, or other typical extras.  As a fan of the show, I always watch the episode and then the corresponding commentary track, which are invariably funny and informative.  This set seems like a rip-off, and I suspect that, when they get to season 20 in the sequence of DVD sets, they will redo the package, meaning that I will probably be purchasing a similar set in a few years.

So how are the episodes?  Well, for the 20th season of a show, the episodes are quite good, with some excellent episodes and just a few clunkers (I'd argue that the episodes are better overall than at least one of the prior DVD sets - Season 11).  ""Coming to Homerica"" is a very clever examination of the hysteria during the 2008 election over the issue of immigration.  In this case, Norwegians from nearby Ogdenville flood into Springfield, creating xenophobia and resulting in the building of a giant wall around the town.  I'm not always a fan of the Halloween episodes, but ""Treehouse of Horror XIX"" is quite good, especially the play on Peanut's The Great Pumpkin.  Finally, ""Mypods and Broomsticks"" does a nice job skewing Apple and iPods.  Season after season, ""The Simpsons"" manages to remain relevant through their timely and witty satirizing abilities, and Season 20 is solid in this regard.

On the other hand, the set contains two of the worst episodes in recent memory.  ""Gone Maggie Gone"" is a lame parody of ""The Da Vinci Code"" that makes little sense and has few laughs.  Worse yet is the scattershot ""Four Great Women and a Manicure,"" in which Marge and Lisa for some reason trade stories about women.  This episode had very little connective thread and left me puzzled.  Deservedly, it was the lowest rated episode in Simpson's history.

I consider myself to be a fairly hardcore fan of the series, although I am not always able to watch the show every week.  So I also welcome the DVD sets, and I enjoyed watching the episodes from season 20.  The season was a relatively good one, worthy of 4 stars.  However, I have to dock the DVD set at least one star for lacking the typical extras and care with which the show is usually packaged.",1264550400,,2544,4.684684684684685
3677336,1,B001L1S1PI,"I immediately bought each of the first 12 seasons upon release, but I'm very glad I DID NOT buy this one.

This defecatory piece of refuse has essentially ZERO special features (a ""sneak preview"" of a show that aired 2 days before the DVD release is not a special feature) and the horrible packaging is AGAIN guaranteed to destroy the disks!  Here are my thoughts and feelings on this subject as a cheated consumer:

Commentaries on the Simpsons/Futurama have always been extremely amusing.  I'd have rather patiently waited for them to be recorded so that they could be included.

Deleted scenes are always great, but why omit them when they obviously haven't been lost to the passage of time?

Seasons 6 through 10 were in shoddy ""hollowed out human heads"" while 11 and 12 were similarly packaged--but never mind that:  Season 11 was packaged in a sandpaper-like cardboard accordian, which scratched the disks BEFORE I even pulled them out; Season 12 was the same but glossy to prevent scratching, but I still couldn't get the damn disks out without getting fingerprints all over them (as I had to PRY them out of the glossy sleeves).  Needless to say, I have NEVER put the disks back into the original boxes; they're in plastic cases wasting EVEN MORE space since I haven't let myself throw the original boxes away.

And now season 20 is packed in the same imbecilic implementation.

FIX THE BLOODY PACKAGING ALREADY, FOX!",1264550400,7,1425,4.80327868852459
3677347,3,B001L1S1PI,"The lack of bonus features is annoying but not really a big deal for me.  What does bother me is how they're releasing the seasons out of order.  It's time to just start releasing them all instead of 2 a year.

Season 20 itself was OK, some enjoyable episodes, no real mega-duds.  Just wish they had waited and done the DVD correctly instead of mindlessly rushing it out just because it's season 20.",1264464000,5,399,4.424657534246576
3677348,3,B001L1S1PI,"Of the DVDs that is. Ever since 2001, I have been picking up The Simpsons DVDs as they hit the shelves, and season 20 was no different for me. Unfortunately, season 20 is a bit of a letdown as far as the DVDs go.

If you're one of those people who buys a DVD and watches the episodes, then great. You shouldn't have any complaints here. But if you care about bonus features, deleted scenes, audio commentaries, etc. etc. Prepare to be let down from this.

I personally vote season 20 as either the worst of the DVDs, possibly tied with season 1 (which apart from not having a play all function commited the DVD sin of having a disc with only one episode on it) But at least season 1 had a good variety of bonus features and commentary on every episode.

I enjoy watching the commentary on The Simpsons (as well as Futurama) because you get a real insight into what it's like. They're almost always entertaining, educational and above all, fun. Season 20 didn't have commentary on a single episode.

Also, in a minor complaint. Please, whoever produces these DVDs. Fix the Box. Season 11 was near unbearable, season 12 was a little better but still annoying and season 20 took a step backwards.

Most other TV shows on DVD have graduated to just using normal amaray style packaging. I would understand if they didn't wanna switch to that, but at least go back to the season 6-10 style of packaging.

Overall, I would say buy it if you wanna watch the episodes. It's as simple as that. The show seems a little different humor wise than it used to be, but I guess it still brings out the laughs.",1264464000,3,1592,4.416382252559727
3677349,3,B001L1S1PI,"""The Simpsons"" makes its debut on Blu-ray!  With the 20th Year anniversary of ""The Simpsons"" completed earlier in Spring 2009 and now on their 21st season, FOX has taken a break from its consecutive DVD release and instead of releasing the 13th Season, to coincide with the 20th Anniversary special shown on television, ""The Simpsons 20 Years - The Complete Twentieth Season"" is being released Blu-ray and DVD.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""The Simpsons"" makes its debut on Blu-ray but its important to emphasize that the first nine episodes on Disc 1 are 1080p upconverted and in 1:33:1 standard and although it may look better than what you see on your television, it doesn't look all that great as a Blu-ray presentation.  The PQ is a bit blurry, there is combing and aliasing and  for the most part, it's not going to look too great.  But once you switch to disc 2 and that is where you notice a huge difference as the series is now 1080p.  The 12 episodes are now widescreen and colors are vibrant, cleaner and look very good (not perfect as it has its share of aliasing but still much better than what we see from the first disc).

So, you're going to get inconsistent picture quality on both discs but for fans of ""The Simpsons"", the fact the show has gone HD and widescreen is wonderful.

As for audio, the episodes are presented in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish, Portuguese and French Dolby Digital 5.1.  The show is front and center-channel driven and dialogue and music is crystal clear.  Certain sounds really jump out from the front channels (and I never heard ""The Simpsons"" television series this good before) and there is occasional LFE but this is the best that I have heard the series sound.  It would have been great if it utilized the surround channels but for an animated television series, it's a pretty good lossless soundtrack.  Not too immersive but ""The Simpsons"" fans should be happy with the shows entry to Blu-ray.

Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and Portuguese.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Simpsons 20 Years - The Complete Twentieth Season"" comes with a four minute special feature titled ""The Twentieth Anniversary Special Sneak Peak by Morgan Spurlock"".  The Twentieth Anniversary Special shown on television is not included on this Blu-ray release nor are the usual commentary tracks, storyboards or extra features typically seen in Simpsons releases.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have to say that when I first heard that ""The Simpsons 20 Years - The Complete Twentieth Season"" would be released on Blu-ray, you can't help but be excited.  Especially if you grew up along with the series.

But I have to admit that I was a bit surprised with this Blu-ray release because every release that we had of ""The Simpsons"" has been loaded with special features.  Tons of audio commentary, fun menus, deleted scenes, commercials, storyboards and featurettes.  For some reason, this latest box set for Blu-ray (and DVD) are devoid of special features.  Yes, there is a promo for the Morgan Spurlock Fox special but it's barely four minutes long and the special is not even included in the release.  So, this was a bummer for this release.

As for the Blu-ray, as mentioned with the picture quality, the video is going to be inconsistent from disc 1 to disc 2 because they were presented differently but the fact that they made the shift to HD is great and the fact that the final 12 episodes look so vibrant with its colors will definitely make the Blu-ray fans of ""The Simpsons"" happy.  While hardcore Blu-ray fans will be a bit upset because of the PQ differences.  But the HD presentation of those episodes and to hear the lossless audio, definitely brings this new added depth to the series.

For over 21-years even since ""The Tracy Ullman Show"", I've found ""The Simpsons"" to still be entertaining, witty, fun and just enjoyable.  I know that there are fans who have had issues with the quality of the show but for me, I'm still watching it and as long as each episode remains fresh and still manages to be fun and entertaining, I've been cool with it.  I do feel that the series now in HD and also being available on Blu-ray is definitely a positive step forward and knock on wood, the next Blu-ray release comes with plenty of special features, all in 1080p and a more immersive soundtrack.

Overall, if you are a hardcore fan of the series, ""The Simpsons 20 Years - The Complete Twentieth Season"" is worth picking up!",1264464000,4,7860,4.596402877697842

However, after reading reviews tonight I will be unhappily returning it to the store, thankful I have left the shrink wrap on it and saved my receipt.

One of the most unique attributes of the team behind ""The Simpsons"" is that they have remained dedicated to producing quality programming and merchandise for two solid decades. Now this dedication has ceased or, at the very least, been tarnished. Maximization of profit is now more important than production of quality.

It is disheartening to see this rush-released cash grab of a DVD box set, priced the same as the legitimate season releases. That it lacks all the special features of the previous box sets and contains a mere ""preview"" of the 20th anniversary special is not only saddening but a complete betrayal of dedicated fans who have generously bestowed their faith in this gem of a show through years of loyalty.

Whom among you would be willing to drop close to $50 for one season of any show?

While it would be nice to have some extras, I'm perfectly content with what has been made available.  Basically, if you want MORE, you're going to have to pay MORE.

Woo-hoo, a dirth of specials, a missing documentary, and not enough preparation to include the standard commentaries, all for much MUCH more than the standard boxset price- it would make sense if FOX was the type of corporation to rip everyone off for more by means of some sort of ""20th season frenzy"" in which people could no longer recall how much previous boxsets cost and what they included. No, I'm not purchasing this set, neither new nor used, but the sad part is that this anticlimactic action has no remedy in a lovingly crafted boxset that would in fact celebrate this institution.",1264032000,6,720,4.669291338582677

Now, I've only put in the first disk, and watched the first 3 episodes. And wow, what absolute crap in comparison. No commentaries, no introduction, no deleted scenes, crappy menus, boring box, and according to the box, just 1 special feature, a ""preview"" of the 20th anniversary special.

Not only are we insulted with poorly designed menus and lacking commentary, deleted scenes, etc., they also decided to package it in the self-destroying cardboard casing they've used (to much public dismay and outcry) in the previous few packages.  As a big fan of the show, I had decided long ago I would buy every season, even the ones after 10 that weren't that funny, just because I wanted to support the franchise.  Well, now that FOX no longer cares about its fans, I will stop caring, too.  I regret pre-ordering this item, and I encourage you not to buy it.  Just watch the episodes online or download them because you're not missing anything from the DVDs.  If sales tank on this, maybe the geniuses at FOX will listen to us and put out a quality product.

If you are judging by the episodes, most of them are pretty good, and a few border on classic Simpson greatness. Ned chasing Homer in the bounty hunter episode will always be a classic in my mind. The Halloween one was really bad this time around, not really even Halloween stories except for the Charlie Brown Parody...which is actually pretty good. But Mad Men and Transformers parodies for Halloween? Thankfully they recovered for the Season 21 episode....

It is nice to see them on blu ray, too; The sound and picture are certainly amazing; But it still baffles me why and who was responsible for what I consider laziness on behalf of some of the most...um....-'un-lazy' people/talent out there. Seems like a 'let's make a quick buck before the product is fully completed' type of thing.

I like listening to the commentaries and checking out the extras.
The Simpsons box sets have always set a high standard, filled to the brim with extras and commentaries on every episode.
That is one thing that originally set it apart from some other series, the disc full of commentary.
It is sad that this was an obviously a rushed job, and I sadly will not buy it.
Hopefully if enough people boycott and complain they will release an improved version.

The production values of the set itself are another matter. I am as likely to listen to the audio commentary as watch the show, and if I had known that it was lacking in this set it would have never been added to my cart. When you add in the total lack of any other bonus features it points to a disturbing trend by FOX.

It seems to me like FOX decided to save some money with the packaging of season 11 under the guise of being ""green"". The fans complained, but they still bought season 12 when it came out. Now with season 20 they have produced a set that is not much better than if you had recorded it yourself. If the fans swallow this, there is no telling what they will do next. They will probably break the next set into 2 half seasons and still charge full price for it.

Lets face it people. FOX could care less if you complain about these sets as long as you continue to fork over the money for them. Well this will be the last set I purchase on the release date unless they give me something worth buying.

It does not make sense that it is here. As you either already saw the special or this ""promo clip"" is just a way of laughing at you for missing it. Buy this Blu-Ray if you want the episodes but don't bother if you are looking for goodies. What is even worse is that is not even less expensive than previous sets that where loaded with goodies.

And yes, I watched the original broadcasts of these shows in HD to know that the first 9 episodes were produced in SD & upconverted to 720p for FOX to broadcast (FOX broadcasts HD in 720p, not 1080i).  I have no complaints about this, that is the way it was.  One question would be about the remaining 12 HD episodes. Since FOX transits in 720p, were they produced in that format & upconverted for this Blu-ray release, or did FOX downconvert from 1080p to 720p for their transmission?

To take a historically important 20th season, few shows make it to 20 seasons let alone an animated series, and give the release NOTHING special is a kick in the butt to both The Simpsons & their fans.

NO documentary about converting the 20th season to HD & the changes the producers had to make.
NO documentary about how the characters have evoled over the years.
NO commentaries to add insight into the episodes we have already seen.
NO more clips from The Tracy Ulman Show to help show the evolution.
NO special limited 20th season packaging.  Hey they could have put this in a limited edition Simpsons Couch, then sold the Simpsons figures seperately for us to buy & put on the couch.  Boy FOX missed a marketing ploy on this one!

Fox is screwing it's fanbase over with this BS ""Complete Season 20"" set.

Furthermore, there are no commentaries, no deleted scenes, or any other bonus material that graced the previous DVD sets.  Also, IMO, this set uses the silly cardboard accordian design which makes taking out the discs a chore.

--And it's still priced as much as the other DVD sets when they were released.  To quote Edna: ""HA!""

Whether or not you feel the Simpsons is as good as it used to be, this set is a sham.  For a set that supposed to ring in two decades of one of the greatest comedies of all time, you'd think someone other than the potential buyers might have cared, and if you're buying this as a gift, RESIST!  The more people who close their wallets to this will mean a faster release of the real Season 20 set and hopefully an 'extended cut' of the Anniversery Special.

We both figured that Season 20 would be extra extra extra packed with awesome extras - like maybe the Tracy Ullman shorts like we thought we were going to get with Season 1.  Maybe it would be extra packed with documentaries (including the one we just saw on TV a few days ago).  Maybe it would have all of the news clips throughout the years showing the slow acceptance of society (they went from BAD for the family to a Great example of a good family).  Maybe it would have lots of behind the scenes footage of some of the stars over the years?  Maybe...

Then our dreams were shattered.  We opened the package and put it in the DVD player.  First, it has the same awful disc-scratching packaging as seasons 11 and 12.

3677433,4,B001L1S1PI,"In 1989 a yellow toned family appeared on our TV screens on the little seen new network known as Fox TV. Can it really be 20 years since we first got a glimpse of the Simpson family? Apparently so as Fox releases THE SIMPSONS COMPLETE 20TH SEASON.

What began as a series of clips in the now defunct TRACY ULLMAN SHOW, little snippets created by Matt Groening, a comic strip creator who drew and wrote LIFE IN HELL, the Simpson family kept growing in popularity. The antics of brat boy Bart, his stupendously idiotic father Homer, loving mother Marge, intelligent sister Lisa and silent little sis Maggie have garnered fans across the world. So much so that THE SIMPSONS is now the longest running prime time series in history, surpassing even M*A*S*H and GUNSMOKE.

So now comes the 20th season, certainly a groundbreaking event for any show. But even more so for one that is animated. There are, or at least prior to this series, few prime time animated series in the history of television. THE SIMPSONS opened that door for all that have followed.

So what does this season have to offer? Plenty. There are still the adventures of problem child Bart as he finds more ways to get into trouble and continues to fill the chalkboard at the beginning of nearly every episode. Homer still does some of the stupidest things seen on TV. But the series offers so much more than just what is visible on the surface.

THE SIMPSONS has always taken a look at society and mocked it. This season is no different. Perhaps one of the best send ups of society is the look they take at Apple and people who feel the need to take on every product that they distribute. Excuse me, its not Apple but Mapple. Heaven knows no one could tell what was being made fun of here.

Included is the 20th season episode of ""Treehouse Of Terror"", THE SIMPSONS annual Halloween episode. Unfortunately for me this one didn't live up to previous seasons outings for this holiday. Sure it has a few moments, but it's been better.

One of the things quite visible in this season is perhaps what's made the Simpsons one of the most endearing families seen on television. While they might be different, they might be low brow and always seem a bit jaundiced, there is at its core a family. And in today's world that's kind of rare.

Single parent families abound on television. But the Simpsons have remained a two parent, three child, one dog family. And while they argue, get in trouble, yell at one another, trick parents and more, they still love one another deeper than many families seen on TV.

An episode where Bart trades places with a rich look-alike results in Bart missing his family. The one where Lisa loses a crossword contest only to find her father Homer bet against her, later discovering that he spent part of the money to offer her a meaningful apology shows he really cares in his own way. And the episode where Homer and Marge remember when they were younger and almost parted ways, only to end with them kissing shows that while there life is anything but easy, they still have that love between them.

Sure there are controversial moments, pokes and jabs at staid institutions and religion and more. But at the core of this show is that family identity filled with love for one another. And the jabs it takes at normal society are much less blatant than some shows. Who would have thought that one day other animated shows would be more outrageous than this one?

There have been two gripes from fans about this box set. The first is that it is taken out of order with several more years (I think 6) not released yet to DVD. I think the reason might be because of the major event that this is, 20 years on TV. It's also the first time they've appeared (with the exception of their feature film) on blu-ray.

The other is that this set offers almost zero extra features. Included is a clip/ad for a documentary by Morgan Spurlock about the series and menus for each disc drawn by Matt Groening. That's it. For me that's enough. I rarely have time to watch every single extra feature. But for die hard fans, their foaming at the mouth over this slight.

Still, what we do get is the entire 20th season in crystal clear format ready to be watched at any time. We get one of the funniest shows ever created. And we get something that remains as topical today as it was when it began. Wouldn't it be nice if every TV show could say the same? For me this set is a great piece of entertainment for a nice price. So sit back, watch the clouds part and slowly glide into the town of Springfield as the Simpsons race home to start the show.",1263254400,3,4617,4.476813317479191

This let me down a bit when I found out.  But it's still nice to have at least some of the season in HD.  Would have been nice to have the whole thing though.  Ah well.

But don't let the description fool you into thinking it's ALL widescreen.  It's not.",1263254400,8,531,4.147058823529412

The only ""special feature"" is an abbreviated preview of the just-aired 20th Anniversary Special. No commentaries, no animatics, no nuthin'. While the DVD version still has a full booklet with episode summaries, the Blu-ray has a tiny insert that lists only the titles. Neither has the customary Groening welcome letter.

I understand the rush to get the Twentieth season out for business reasons and as a marketing aspect seeing that this is The Simpsons twentieth year but they could have tossed a few extras in the mix!
Over all I enjoyed this season and will continue to buy the box sets. Any fan should its still a great show and even with the lack of extras you get a great season worth of episodes.",1263254400,2,499,4.208333333333333
3677449,2,B001L1S1PI,"Although the season has great episodes, especially the 2nd half with the transitioned to HD, this box set fails to include any special feature what so ever. First off, no commentaries; The commentaries are the reason these sets sell because it makes a detail description on the process on how the episodes came to be, both good and bad episodes. Second, no 20th Anniversary feature where the cast and crew discuss on their experiences on working on the show for 20 years. And finally, no intro from Matt Groening; it feels that Groening had no involvement on this release, thus making it an unofficial box set.

For those fans who just want to see the episodes and don't care for the features, this set is a must buy. For the rest, I suggest avoid this product and wait for the eventual box set with all the special features, including The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special in 3D on Ice!, in the near future.",1263254400,3,908,4.604938271604938

3677451,2,B001L1S1PI,"I just bought this today just because I love the Simpsons; And to be honest this set sucks! Sure they start getting better this season but this set sucks because there are no special features. There isn't even a greeting from Matt Groening like the previous sets. Honestly this is not the kind of thing we expect from the crew that works on these sets but maybe they were just rushed into doing a crappy release for the 20th season. In that case it still sucks because this is the season they should have celebrated the most with. They should of had so many special features and Easter eggs that you would get tired of looking for them after a while. This is the first Simpson set that I give a bad review to for the simple reason that there is no special features, commentary, or any other great thing like the first sets had. The only good thing about this series is that the episodes start to get good again.

3677453,2,B001L1S1PI,"What a strange concept for Fox to skip past the next several released seasons and go to season 20. From the few episodes I've seen from this season the laughs are still there but not like they were in the older seasons.

After seeing the terrible packaging for the last 2 seasons,I'm not sure if I'm going to purchase this or not, might just get it from the library. Fox needs to go back to their old style of packaging where you could actually get your disks out with out scratching them up.

(post edit)
After reading some recent reviews I see that the packaging issue is still there. :(
I posted this before in another review the phone number to Fox is 310-369-1000, if you want to call them and let them know how you feel about the packaging. Unfortunately though, they don't respect the fans enough to bother returning calls, but if enough people call, they may still listen.",1263168000,18,880,4.459627329192546

I wonder, is FOX going to keep releasing all the other extra-packed seasons (13-19) or continue to give us recent HD extras-free so-so seasons of the Simpsons? I really hope FOX makes this a one time only, and continues to gives the old seasons, or at least gives us some extras!",1262822400,8,735,4.533834586466165
3677455,2,B001L1S1PI,"Truly this was a banner season for the Simpsons, but not for creative reasons, more for the list of accomplishments the series was able to rack up this year that seemed to bring the show into the fray of contemporary animation. The Simpsons is like, what Kent Brockman might call a lumbering dinosaur, to which Homer would scream, and I would be told not to talk to him anymore. The show is a giant, and the father of modern primetime animation, and even of post modern humor in sitcoms. Yet, in the last few years, the show's consistent brilliance has been tested by its own status and seemed to resonate a sort of hubris within the series that limited it in taking chances. Surely there are wonderful episodes in the last years, but none would come close to any true fans' favorites, most of which are usually constrained to the first eight years of the series. Season 20 was the first full season greenlit after the film's massive success, and the inspiration from such box office gratitude has somewhat transferred to this season, which like most seasons of late, has some high points, low points, and those that make you say 'meh.' But Season 20 was surely the best of this last decade, with inspired writing from such Simpsons greats as John Frink, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Tim Long, Steven Deane Moore, and Joel H. Coen. The newer additions to the staff, and the old Futurama writers are certainly finding a style that works well this season.

While Season 20 is landmark numerically, it also was the year that the Simpsons finally made their way to iTunes, and the year that the series finally decided to go 16:9 HD. This has lent a renewed excitement to all Simpsons fans, who have felt the show slipping into irrelevant territory, especially amongst other animated series today, for quite a few years. Many had expected the series to simply slowly wither away, and have found much to support such a concern over the last eight seasons. Most fans have a hazy understanding of the show the last eight years or so, with little to cling to in terms of must see episodes. The most recent 'can't miss' marketing has been one of nostalgia, emphasizing the 20th anniversary of the show, the sheer accomplishment it has achieved in becoming the longest running series in prime time television history, next to gunsmoke, which was on for twenty years. That show, however, had over six hundred episodes, a feat which the Simpsons could meet if it manages to stay on the air for another eight years or so.

Season 20 delves into many traditional Simpsons fare, with Homer getting strange jobs, Lisa showing off her smarts, Bart causing trouble, and Marge finding her good nature taken advantage of. Yet the addition of the HD episodes are what makes this season of particular importance, as it both has inspired the writing, but also the particularly amazing directors working at the show. Many visuals are just oozing with beauty, and the animation is crisper than it ever has been.

While the writing does not seem to offer the same sort of urgency that many other animated series have been able to capture, it is still the brainchild of the ivy league lampooners, and as such it employs more refined wit than hysterics. Perhaps that is why the series has been maligned lately. The thing about the Simpsons, though, is that when they hit on all cylinders the show is better than most of its animated cousins. Many episodes here are very good, and certainly worth owning, but maybe not in this boxset. Why? Well, unlike previous season releases, this season is being rushed out, with no special features, no commentaries, no animatics, no deleted scenes... This is surely a means to capitalize on the HD transition. Many speculate that Fox is deliberately leapfrogging the Al Jean years of the past to offer what many assume is the series' return to (new) glory. I doubt that very much. While seasons 13-19 are of lesser importance in the minds of Simpsons fans, most are so die hard that they'll pick up every episode even if they aren't too happy with them. I imagine that this move is more in line with Fox's decision to release DVDs of series pretty much right after they've aired to capitalize on the 'newness,' much as with 24 or more recently with Glee; both were available almost immediately after their finales.

Season 20 did ignite the viewership, as many had returned to, or discovered, the Simpsons after the 2007 film. Ratings were good enough to ensure a two season pickup. The show may not be what it once was, but that doesn't mean it sucks. Yes, at times, one can grow nostalgic for the old days of the Simpsons, but certainly its still pretty incredible that every Sunday at 8pm, the yellow family will be there to keep having adventures for at least one more year.

But as far as the Simpsons DVD boxsets go, this one is slim in all areas. Every season released to date has included commentary on every single episode, and that's gone here. Even with complaints about design, the recent second wave of head box sets (Krusty and Comic Book Guy) have gone far enough to continue the tradition of thematic menus, disc artwork, and foldout montages of of the Simpsons characters in themes like the circus or comic book characters; that is gone here. The artwork chosen is the montage of characters, which is charming, but merely a re-purposing of the graphic. Instead of animated menus featuring characters, FOX has opted to allow Matt Groening to create animated visuals of him drawing our favorite characters. Those are all quite flat, and seem tacked on. In fact, most of this boxset seems to have been rushed, and given the history of well produced DVD releases in the past for the series, this set seems even more slim.

When the re-release of this set comes out, pick it up then.",1262217600,11,5795,4.6932153392330385
3677456,2,B001L1S1PI,"While it might be cool to reflect 20 years of Simpsons history, this is not the way to do it. As a collector, this extremely irritates me. I hate it when they release the last season before the earlier seasons. (Like they did with ""Fraiser"" and it confused me when I was buying them as gifts). And while this isn't the last season, it gives all the more reason not to release it this early. The season in all was OK, but not really good. Once they went to HD, they short of forgot what made a good episode, although there are a few surprises along the way.

Bottom line: They better rerelease this season after they make 13-19 and give it all the commentaries and special features it deserves.",1262044800,13,693,4.3307692307692305
