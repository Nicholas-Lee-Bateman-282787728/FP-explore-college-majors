7970937,5,B00006L2ZW,"Other reviewers are correct, this is not for beginners. It is intermediate to advanced and worth every penny.

I have both of these volumes (1 & 2) and I review them every few months as a reminder and touch up to my playing.

I think John is a fine teacher, and if people have not learned the language of music, they may find his explanations confusing. Not his fault, but the short-comings of other reviewers (in my opinion).

I found his discussions straight forward, plain, simple to understand and challenging to put to the fingers.",1338940800,,536,4.621052631578947

7970939,2,B00006L2ZW,"Chord soloing is playing chords over a melody. Doing this on a guitar faces some challenges: mostly, you play four string chords and you need to outline the chord and the melody on top of it. Piano players have it so easy. :)

Most jazz tunes have frequent chord changes and alterations, so it's certainly tricky. What an interesting topic to try to teach, isn't it?

Mr Carlini is a great jazz guitar player, but he's not an interesting teacher. Most of the songs are mostly show offs. He hurries over the necessary explanations and just refers to the booklet.

He misses these points:

# how do you play these songs?

# what are chord options and why can you substitute to other chords?

# how can you work through chord options to get the optimum playing

My advice to Mr Carlini is to cut down the number of songs to three or four and thoroughly walk through them.

Unfortunately, there aren't tons of other instructional DVDs in this area, but hope you find something else.",1104192000,18,978,4.517045454545454
