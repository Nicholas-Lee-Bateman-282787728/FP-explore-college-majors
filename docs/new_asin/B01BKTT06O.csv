7659457,5,B01BKTT06O,"I'm a huge fan of the writer/director Henrique Couto so I was naturally excited to hear about him making his first rom-com. He always has a way with including comedy, even in horror movies, so the romance side was new to him. I can safely say that Couto knocked it out of the park with this! As usual the writing was fantastic. Couto is great at making the dialogue sound natural, as if it what is being spoken is not scripted because it flows so easily. Obviously that works best when he has great talent! The acting was spot on, with even minor actors getting large laughs from the audience. Erin R. Ryan and Titus Wolverton had great chemistry and easily worked well with each other. They especially easily clicked with the supporting cast, such as when Titus' character Charlie hired Bradley Diehl's character (who delivered one of the best lines in the film via a misreading).",1465862400,4,881,4.617834394904459
7659458,5,B01BKTT06O,It is a hysterical look at modern day romance through the misadventures of a screenwriter and an actress as they attempt to create movie romance in real life.  The chemistry of the leads and a strong supporting cast led by the direction of screenwriter Henrique Couto make this rollicking comedy a can't miss!,1465862400,2,309,4.830188679245283
7659459,4,B01BKTT06O,"Good stuff from Henrique Couto, who is a friend of mine (full disclosure). Every year he crowdfunds a personal film, usually a comedy, and this is his best yet. Great premise, goofy, a few belly laughs and lots of giggles. Couto knows how to set up a ridiculous gag as well as anyone. (He's also not afraid to work with material that some might find crude or offensive.) I have a fondness for very low budget films, and this certainly is one. So go in realizing that this is not the super polished twelve million dollar comedy you're used to. There are rough edges. But it's independent, it's art, and it's funny. Please give it a look.",1465862400,4,636,4.444444444444445
7659460,5,B01BKTT06O,"Charming romantic comedy with a modern twist. Great cast, top notch directing. The perfect date night movie.",1465862400,2,108,5.411764705882353

7659462,4,B01BKTT06O,"Absolutely a must watch for any helpless romantic. Lots of comedy and mishaps that i'm sure a lot of us can in some way relate to. And if you pay enough attention, you may learn some do's and dont's about dating. Absolutely entertaining.",1466121600,,237,4.534883720930233
7659463,5,B01BKTT06O,"The first time I saw Making Out, I still remember how blown away I was at how good it really is. It's been very fun to watch director Henrique Couto grow in the way of his movies. From Horror, to Drama, to even a kid's film, this guy does it all, and unlike some of the competition, does it very well! Making Out is the story of a screenwriter named Charlie who isn't having very much luck in the dating world. This brings, Erin, an actress into his life who also isn't having the best of luck with dating, Together they come up with a scheme to reenact the perfect dates they've always wanted but keeping it simple and just making out. But as you can guess simple is a word that won't work for what seems like a perfect scenario. Much like all of Henrique's film this film will keep the laughs coming and also tugs at the heart strings. From hilarious one liners, to a little slapstick, and amazing acting by a very talented cast, Making Out has got it all! Don't miss this movie!",1465948800,,981,4.251336898395722
7659464,5,B01BKTT06O,Henrique Couto makes perfect indie comedies in my opinion.  From a horror fan who fell in love with a couple of his horror movies and continued on through his long list of films only to find that I prefer these by far.  Making Out was to me a very personal film about the dating world and the fact that one of my all time favorite indie ladies Erin Ryan stars was just icing on the cake.  This movie is witty and relatable.  Highly recommended for anyone especially in the dating world.,1465948800,,486,4.3076923076923075
7659465,5,B01BKTT06O,"All of the run-of-the-mill indie romantic comedy ingredients are in place, but Henrique Couto and his incredible cast of usual suspects manage to mix it into a wonderfully sweet meta tale that turns the oft-cliched genre on its head. If you're ever in the mood for that 100th view of Pretty Woman or Never Been Kissed, I urge you to take a chance on this one - it may not be as well known (yet) but it deserves to be on your feel-good rom-com go-to rotation!",1465862400,2,458,4.337209302325581
7659466,5,B01BKTT06O,Impressive movie!!! I enjoyed the story line.,1465862400,,45,5.571428571428571
7659467,5,B01BKTT06O,"comedies plod along a familiar path, MAKING OUT gleefully skips down it, reveling in the clichd tropes. Yes, clichs usually lead to tired, uninspired material, but with this film Couto goes a little paisley and tie-dye rather than doing a standard paint-by-numbers. By using the career of Charlie as a constant piece, it allows for the film to step away from hitting us over the head with the faux-mance and gives us a chance to know more about him. I cant help but feel that this is one of Coutos more personal films using Charlie as his avatar.

7659470,5,B01BKTT06O,"This movie takes a hilarious look at what love is, or more accurately, what people dream it to be. Henrique hits another home run with this one. I loved it from the start.

I almost NEVER write a bad review; hey maybe I just didn't get it. Unfortunately, for the good of mankind I have to warn you not to watch this. Bad acting, dumb writing, again, dumb writing, bad sets, weird costumes - pretty sure it's just their everyday clothes. Just doesn't go anywhere. The big climax for them movie - to prove her love, the star let go a huge fart to prove her sincerity for her man. The movies being added to Prime just keep getting worse and worse.

8750447,5,B01BKTT06O,"I've been following Henrique Couto's fledgling career since the very beginning.  Aside from being a hilarious, handsome, and all around wonderful human being he is also a talented film maker.  His incredible range as a director from kids films to his genre-defining horror fare, I was beyond excited to hear he was finally taking on a romantic comedy, to see him skewer the typically rote and mundane genre with some of his film making brilliance, and oh boy did he deliver!

The plot was original, and the acting was top tier.  It almost felt like the movie had no script at all, as everything was so natural and well-delivered.  It's like Henrique has the ability to reach down into the depths of his actors' hearts' and find the sheer raw talent locked up in the basement of their insecurities shouting ""Let me out!"".  My favorite line was actually a misreading by Bradley, and I don't want to spoil anything but it involves a tree that starts with b ;).

We need to support true underground film making. Buy It Birch!",1506816000,,1021,4.638888888888889

8750452,5,B01BKTT06O,"A (very brief) Primer on Cuoto

During my admittedly fledgling career as an indie films enthusiast, I have come to know the name of Henrique Cuoto in association primarily with horror films and, more recently, a diverse portfolio of genre work from the feel-good family holiday film to the wild west revenge story. There is one element, however, that ties such a diverse array of films together: quality.

Anyone with even a passing familiarity with how movie making works knows that so many elements come into play during its creation that wrangling them into a piece that is at once artistic, entertaining and cathartic requires an incredible level of industry, one to which Mr. Cuoto (if the quality of the film is any indication) has applied himself with both diligence and devotion.

The Movie in Question

The film, Cuoto's first foray into Romantic Comedy, is about a frustrated young screenwriter and an equally frustrated young woman he meets, who convinces him to write and stage stereotypical romantic situations (the fancy dinner date, the ""defending her honor"" fight, etc.) to alleviate their mutual romantic issues. They establish some ground rules (""No getting weird... making out only!"") and then they're off to the races. The audience is treated to a steady series of cliched romance scenes that, try as they might, the two just cannot keep from going hilariously off the rails. As the film progresses, moments of genuine chemistry between the two begin building into something far more real...

Speaking of Chemistry...

...what makes this movie stand out, apart from the unique concept of staging your own ""Jerry McGuire"", script and all, is the way the acting draws us into the relationship. The leads, played by Erin R. Ryan (Awkward Thanksgiving, Bludgeon) and Titus Wolverton (Primordial, Scarewaves) manage to charm us (and each other) during the hilarious chaos, unknowingly falling for each other by pretending to fall for each other. By the time anyone realizes what's been happening (while we've been laughing at outrageously non-romantic guitar serenades) their connection seems as natural and intuitive as anything. It builds to a wonderfully executed emotional climax that, like so much else in this movie, challenges our concept of how romance works both in film and reality. The ability of the actors to be real, relatable people completely brings the film back to a firmly grounded landing after a marvelous flight of fun and warmhearted fancy.

The great thing about this film is that it appeals to both crazy people who enjoy romantic comedies and handsome, sensible people who don't! It both satirizes and celebrates many common tropes of the genre in a way that's thoroughly enjoyable. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up.",1468281600,2,2765,5.103982300884955
