437624,5,6302036941,Street trash is the unholy grail of trash and exploitation cinema.  I have been waiting for this release for years and my old vhs copy has petty much melted in my vcr from years of playing for friends who were unaware of it's infamous existence.  Thank you synapse pictures for releasing this nasty movie back into the consumer market.,1125273600,5,335,4.661016949152542
437625,5,6302036941,"No offense, but if you are a horror fan your DVD collection in incomplete without this film. You want Gore? Street trash has it. You want cheese? Street Trash has that too. This ultra-low budget film is limited only by the acting, but oh well man...small price to pay for this bloodbath. Hope the x-tras are worth it, but even so this lil' forgotten gem is getting the uncut treatment it has deserved. Plus the whole ""Penis Football"" scene mentioned makes it worth the price. Plus, if you get the DVD it comes with two free Tenafly Viper stickers based on the vicious liquor that melts everyone in the movie! Too cool! They are in the shape of liquor bottle stickers so you can put them on one after you drink it all while watching this movie. Instant movie memorabilia! Not going to give away the ""juicy"" details...sorry. Buy it on a whim...its a winner. Gore fans rejoice. Nuff said.",1124841600,15,885,4.5375
437626,5,6302036941,This is one of the coolest cult flicks I have ever seen I rented it at my neighborhood video store and loved it and now I can finally own it on dvd. It has it all from melting after drinking a liquor know as Tenafly Viper to a penis being cut off through a fence to the scene at the end where the guy gets blwon off by an welding tank oh yeah I can't wait.,1124582400,6,356,3.6973684210526314

I have seen alot of crazy movies in my time but this was highly original and well worth the watch. It starts out with a good foot chase scene and then gets to the first melt victim, the following half hour or so was a little slow but the last half hour more than made up for ANY shortcomings. I found myself at the end wishing for just one more melt scene and when it didn't happen I just watched the movie again ( I'm a glutton for punishment!). The last song was horribly done by the lone mobster in the movie, but was a great finishing touch to this cult classic. I LOVED IT !!!!!!",1123027200,4,729,4.140845070422535

That title belongs to others, but this movie ranks up there. It's actually one of the sickiest movies ever made, and I love it. PUT IT ON DVD ALREADY. Another movie on my wish list. A must own.",1120348800,4,355,4.159420289855072
437629,4,6302036941,"Awesome flick with lots of mostly phoney looking special fx, which is great because it matches the mostly phoney acting.

Tremendous chase scene in the opening is like Indiana Jones meets Monty Python meets NYPD Blue. Hilarious football game in middle of film involving a severed, well, ask John Wayne Bobbitt what HE thought of that scene.

Coming soon to DVD with extra stuff. Can't wait to see what they thought was too tasteless to include in the final cut!

437631,5,6302036941,"This is one of those films, if it was not made in the context and style it was made in would be Trash.  Virtually every frame of this movie is purposeful and lends to the movie.
After not seeing this film for about 14 years it still holds its appeal.
If you like Toxic Avenger -you will adore Street Trash.
Bill Chepil is excellent as the cop. Reminds me of real people I know!
Vic Noto is a very believable Bronson. The most believeable character throughout the entire film.
James Lorinz is hilarious -see him in FrankenHooker where, if I remember correctly, plays a main part AND a similar style funny character.",1045180800,3,614,4.482142857142857

The special effects, however, are top notch. And they're centered around melting, exploding bums!!! The chief bum is a crazed lunatic constantly having Vietnam flashbacks. It's comical and morbid at the same time. One of my personal top five best cult flicks ever. Also, the kid playing the doorman is also the mad scientist in ""Frankenhooker"" another outstanding B-flick and also in my top five.",1044403200,,546,4.757894736842105

As the situation unravels a NY cop and a mob boss become involved and further complicate matters.

Its everything that made the 80's a great decade for horror. Though it mixes satire and dark comedy pretty well. It has pretty cool effects and a very colorful cast of characters to keep you interested. And the bonus features on this synapse release are well worth the money.

There's a sub plot that involves a police officer trying to track down all of the deaths involved with the wine and the homeless street gangs.

The reality is, Street Trash is mindless garbage. I am no stranger to B-Horror movies from thr late 70's and 80's, but Street Trash has such bad writing, bad taste, lack of any direction or really  any thought it'd make the Toxic Avenger shake his head.

Its a terrible, stupid movie, with no redeeming qualties at all. This is coming from someone who loves Dead Alive, Evil Dead II and the Toxic Avenger.",1430784000,,774,4.711111111111111

It has a good sense of humour too and is a very stand alone and original 80's movie that's really worth adding to the collection for sure, you cant knock it for cult classic bloody gory splatter practical effects they are top notch all the way, amusing cast, good soundtrack, for a low budget movie at the time its a gem by todays standards!!

Yes, the humor and yuks are lowbrow at times, but also clever and satirical. The cinematography is top notch, thanks in part to the awesome steadycam work of Jim Muro.

I feel like this movie was ahead of it's time even though watching it now, it's clearly a period piece of the Troma generation.

Lot of that stuff was right on target. Most of the bums have perfect teeth(only noticeable flaw).The special effects were fun and colorful. And each actor played their rolls to the hilt. I have been through many releases and versions through the years and now I can finally stop. This edition is as complete as you are gonna get. I got to thank Roy Frumkes via computer years ago for making a very cool and funny movie. The worst version I have seen of this movie was from a Japanese vhs tape. All nudity is blurred out.

438115,4,6302036941,"I was fortunate enough to receive a Blu-ray of Street Trash Special Meltdown Edition to review.  Here it is:

After viewing the Street Trash Special Meltdown Edition Blu-ray, I'm still, at this very moment, trying to think of and make sense of what I just watched.  I haven't decided what the Hell this movie is yet; however, all I can say at this point is, the more I think about it, the more I actually liked the movie.

Street Trash is an older B-Horror movie that follows homeless people around for the most part, mainly two brothers, Fred (Mike Lackey) and Kevin (Mark Sferrazza), who live in a tire hut in a salvage yard.  Fred is the ""street wise"", older brother while Fred is the younger one who seems to always stay at home.  We also are introduced to a character named, Bronson (Vic Noto), who seems to be the one who is the bully of the homeless people in the salvage yard.  Bronson uses brute force and scare tactics to maintain power over the rest of the homeless people living at the yard and he is initially seen as the villain of the movie.

A store owner finds an old hidden crate of alcohol in his store called, Tenafly Viper, and he decides to take it out front to sell it.  The Tenafly Viper is 60 years old and it appears the store owner has no knowledge of the alcohol.  He sells each bottle for a very cheap $1.00.  Fred goes into the store and sees the alcohol, so he lifts a bottle and runs away.  Another homeless guy steals that same bottle of Tenafly Viper from Fred and goes to an abandoned building and sits on a toilet to drink it.  After taking just one sip of the alcohol, the homeless guy starts to melt and his body is being eaten away.  He eventually melts down into the toilet; definitely a creative way for someone to die.

As more people start to die, the police get involved to try to figure out what is causing all the deaths.  As the movie progresses, more and more homeless people start to drink the Tenafly Viper and they all die by melting away.  Eventually, Fred's younger brother, Kevin, gets in a little ""pickle"" with Bronson and starts running away from him.  Bronson wants to hurt Kevin, if not kill him.  Fred comes back and actually kills Bronson and saves his little brother.

Street Trash is your typical B-Horror movie with some clever jokes strewn throughout the film, which makes it funny at times.  The video quality for this Blu-ray is excellent considering the movie came out in 1987.  It really looks like the film was shot just yesterday, so the film conversion was exceptional.  Finally, if you are a true fan of sick, disgusting movies and gore, you will not be disappointed with Street Trash as this movie has a lot of it.  Just be forewarned, do not watch the movie while eating dinner.  Considering everything, Street Trash was actually an entertaining movie to watch considering its age.  I had fun while viewing it and, although not the best movie out there, it deserves at least one look by horror and B-movie fans.  Overall, I give this movie a 4/5 star rating.

438116,5,6302036941,"STREET TRASH is one of those films that I saw on VHS in video stores when I was a kid but simply never bother to pick up.  I sure wish I had, though...this flick has some amazing gore and must be seen to be appreciated!  But be warned--this film won't appeal to everyone.  Gore-hounds and exploitation nuts will love it, but many of you probably won't have a taste for it.  I personally enjoyed it quite a bit and wish director James Muro was still directing shockers like this one.

This is one of those films that you watch with a group of people so you can enjoy the carnage together.  And when I say carnage, I mean it...people melt right before your eyes, a fat guy explodes, and even a severed penis is used for an impromptu football game.  I kid you not!  This is one crazy movie, and it's awesome!

STREET TRASH is shot well and the acting is pretty good, too.  But what makes the film is the absurdity of its concept.  Alcohol that is so bad it causes people to melt from within?  How can you not want to see this film?

And the gore...wow!  I haven't seen this much ooze and body drippings since Peter Jackson's DEAD ALIVE.  Now THAT is saying something!  Obviously, if you are the least bit squeamish, don't give this one a look.  But if you thrive on gore, definitely check it out.  The bodies splatter and the blood sprays...it's a veritable orgy of mayhem!

438118,4,6302036941,"THIS IS A DVD REVIEW BY MICHAEL R. GATES OF THE 2005 RELEASE.

The ultra-low-budget exploitation flick STREET TRASH (1987) certainly lives up to its name in more ways than one. Not only is it rather trashy when it comes to generally poor or histrionic acting, bawdy humor, gore, and several lingering flashes of T&A, but it is also one of the few films set in New York City's skid row that was actually filmed almost entirely in authentic skid-row venues.

The centerpiece of the paper-thin plot is a case of decades-old hooch called Tenafly Viper, discovered in the miasmic basement of a skid-row liquor store by the store's proprietor. The unscrupulous vendor decides to exploit his seemingly serendipitous find and pad his pocket by selling the stuff to local winos for a buck per bottle. But unbeknownst to him and his unwary customers, the stuff has gone sour and has transmuted into a volatile toxin that literally melts those who consume it into a pile of day-glo goo.

Though STREET TRASH is blatantly and disgustingly lowbrow, it is nonetheless wildly entertaining and, from a technical standpoint, very well made. The make-up FX are skillfully and artistically executed, and never have latex appliances looked so simultaneously gross and hilarious. The action does lag in a few spots, but most of the time there is a constant flow of either gore, skin, or bawdy gags. Also, in contrast to many near-zero-budget exploitation films, the cinematography is fabulous--director Jim Muro shot the entire film using a rented steadicam, and he was so skilled at it that he went on to become one of Hollywood's greatest steadicam operators, working on such films as TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY (1991), TITANIC (1997), AND RED DRAGON (2002)--and the editing is near perfect, making STREET TRASH look like a more mainstream, bigger-budget film.

While the acting skills of many of the principals leave a lot to be desired, STREET TRASH does feature a few thespians worth noting. Genre fans will recognize James Lorinz from his role as the mad scientist in the exploitation satire FRANKENHOOKER. In an earlier role here, Lorinz plays a lippy doorman in the employ of a mob boss, and he steals the show in nearly every scene in which he appears. Actor Tony Darrow portrays the aforementioned mob boss, and Darrow parlayed his debut role here into a career of playing similar types in more mainstream gangster flicks, including critically acclaimed films like GOODFELLAS (1990), BULLETS OVER BROADWAY (1994), AND MIGHTY APHRODITE (1995).

The DVD release of STREET TRASH from Synapse is a no-frills disc, but its definitely worth the price of admission. It offers a digital transfer of the film--which has been nicely restored and is completely uncut--in its original aspect ratio of 1.78:1 (enhanced for 16x9 TVs), and the stereo soundtrack is also nice and clear.

Sick? Yes. Foul? For sure. Gross? Often. But its also a lot of fun. STREET TRASH is definitely not for everybody, but for those who enjoy exploitation horror flicks from the 1970s and 1980s, STREET TRASH is definitely one of the best. And the DVD from Synapse will make a fine addition to the collections of those who enjoy such films.",1365120000,3,3196,4.9533582089552235
438119,5,6302036941,"Trashmhre vielleicht ? Kultfilm ? oder beides ? ;-) Denn ""Street Trash"" aus dem Jahre 1987 hier bekam im Laufe der Zeit schon viele Titel verpasst, - wie z. B. ""die erfrischenste Attacke auf die Magengegend seit Re - Animator"". Oder auch ""einer der grten Kultfilme aller Zeiten"". Er ist ein ""Classic B - Movie"" mit sehr drastischen Splattereffekten und berhmt - berchtigten Status in Insiderkreisen.

Vergessen sie ""Angriff der Killertomaten"", vergessen sie sogar ""Plan 9 from outer Space"". Dieser Film hier ist nochmal doppelt so kaputt wie diese beiden zusammen gerechnet. Selten wurde soviel Stumpfsinn (dafr allerdings auch, beraus witziger ! ;-) auf die Zuschauer losgelassen. Nicht nachdenken dabei, einfach gut unterhalten werden.

Der Film ist (und bleibt) quasi die Referenz fr alle weiteren des cineastischen Stilmittels ""Schmelzhorror"". Was gibt es sonst noch groartig darber anzugeben ? Am besten wird sein, ich schildere einfach mal die erste halbe Stunde hier, okay.

Regisseur James Muro (wird auf der Hlle allerdings nur Jim Muro genannt) hatte vorher auer diesem Werk keine weiteren Leichen im Keller. Er ist dafr vielmehr sogar einer der bekanntesten Steadycamleute in Hollywood. Beteiligte sich schon an unterschiedlichen Filmen wie ""Freitag der 13. - Jason in Manhattan"", ""der mit dem Wolf tanzt"", ""True Lies - wahre Lgen"", ""Titanic"", ""Strange Days"", ""the Doors"", ""JFK - Tatort Dallas"", ""Casino"", Heat"" und ""the Insider"", - um nur mal sehr bekannte zu nennen. Scheint also zumindest als Kameramann einiges auf dem Kasten zu haben.

""Street Trash"" hier war seine erste, und so auch bislang einzige Regiearbeit gewesen. Aber seine Erfahrung durch diese hauptberufliche Arbeit machte sich stark bemerkbar. Es gibt viele schrge und ungewhnliche Kamerawinkel, - und fahrten. Am Anfang z. B. beginnt es mit einer Fahrt durch die Hausruine, die sehr stark an ""Tanz der Teufel"" erinnert. Sowieso erkennt man hier und dort kleine hnlichkeiten zu groen Vorbildern, die bestimmt als Inspiration gedient haben. Nur wie die Penner sich nachts versammeln erinnert an ""Dawn of the Dead"". Und diverse male fhlt man sich auch wie in Peter Jackson's ""Bad Taste"" versetzt.

Aber nicht nur in der Kameraarbeit hat Muro sich Mhe gegeben. All seine Charaktere sind zwar recht abgestrzte Persnlichkeiten. Trotzdem hat jede Figur ihre Besonderheiten und ganz eigenen Wesenzge, was fr eine gute Abwechslung sorgt. Die Schauspieler haben allerdings grtenteils auer ""Street Trash"" auch keine weiteren, relevanten Eintrge in ihrer Karriere zu verzeichnen. ;-)

Zur Handlung: Die Kamera fhrt auf einen Schnapsladen zu. Auf der Hinterseite stehen Mlltonnen, die von einem Penner als Lehne genutzt werden. Kaum gibt der Ladenbesitzer einen Plastiksack in den Abfall, ist der Penner schon auf den Beinen. Nein, er whlt nicht im Mll, er stakst dem Verkufer hinterher. Aber mit einem Gang, als htte er sich gerade in die Hose gemacht. Dann folgt ein kurzer Dialog und der Penner nutzt diese Gelegenheit, sich erstmal kostenlos selbst zu bedienen.

Der Ladenbesitzer findet das natrlich garnicht so nett und jagt dem armen Obdachlosen wegen eines Flachmann's nach. Der Penner hetzt eine Strae entlang, ein Auto weicht ihm aus, prallt gegen eine Lampe, der Fahrer steigt aus und verfolgt den Penner gleich mit. Ein Geldeintreiber reit einem Kerl Geld aus den Fingern, der Penner jagt vorbei und reit es ihm aus der Hand. Und der Geldeintreiber hinterher. So ungefhr beginnen nur mal die ersten fnf Minuten dieses Kultfilm's. ;-)

Man darf also keinesfalls, irgendeine Art anspruchsvolle Kost erwarten. Oft genug zieht sich die quasi nicht vorhandene Rahmenhandlung hier zh wie Kaugummi dahin. Und sie wird meitens nur durch die genialen Schmelz - Horroreffekte unterbrochen. Allerdings, wenn dann auch schon die ersten weiblichen Rundungen nach unter 5 Minuten durch das Bild hpfen, dann hat man wahrscheinlich doch genau zum richtigen, Gehirn abschalten - Stimmung an - Film, eben zu ""Street Trash"" gegriffen.

Mit dem Geldeintreiber geht also es weiter. Dieser schleicht wie ein geprgelter Hund auf einen Autofriedhof und beichtet, dass das Geld leider weg ist. Kommen wir nun zum genialen ;-) Anfhrer dieser Meute: Bronson, - dreckig, brtig, gro, vollkommen durchgeknallt, ein Ex - G I eben. Aber dreckig und hlich sind sie brigens alle. Auch seine Perle, die der Brtige gerade von seinem Scho wirft und die sich nun auf allen vieren vom Acker macht. Jedenfalls will der Herr mit dem Bart das Geld wiederhaben und schwrt mindestens blutige Rache. Soweit - sogut, das waren ca. die nchsten 10 Minuten. ;-)

berblendung in den Keller eines Schnapsladens (einem anderen), wo sein Besitzer auf der Suche nach mglicher Ware in allen Ecken kramt und eine Kiste zutage frdert. In der Kiste liegen auf Stroh einige nette Flschchen, betitelt ""Viper"". Erst will er die wieder versenken, dann merkt er, dass die Dinger ber 60 Jahre alt sind und er locker einen Dollar pro Flasche dafr kriegen knnte. Just in dem Moment taucht unser Penner vom Anfang wieder auf. Das Angebot, so eine Schnapsflasche fr einen Dollar zu ergattern erscheint unserem ungewaschenen Freund zwar gnstig. Aber als ein Rollstuhlfahrer namens Steve durch die Tr geschoben kommt und prompt dabei strzt, rutscht das Flschchen per fnf Finger - Rabatt wie von selbst in die Jackentasche des Kunden. Nun wird's so langsam interessant. ;-)

Szenenwechsel. Wir treffen unseren Penner vom Anfang wieder (der brigens Freddy heit), wie er dem Geldeintreiber freundschaftlich verklickert, dass sein Einkommen leider auf dem Weg zur Mllhalde ist. Dieser zieht Fred die Viper Flasche aus dem Mantel. Kaum ist der weg, stellt Fred fest, dass die Buddel ebenso weg ist. Dieser setzt sich auf ein Klo und mchte nun gemtlich einen zur Brust nehmen. Die vermeintliche Schnapsflasche wird begutachtet und dann ein krftiger Zug genommen. Nun endlich geht's los. ;-)

Pltzlich bekommt er Krmpfe, es luft ihm blauer Sabber aus Hosenbein und Mund und er zerluft in einer sehr  modderigen Glibberpftze. Die Kamera fhrt ber den Schuttplatz und zeigt uns einen zerschmolzenen Haufen mit Gesicht, das noch aus dem Klo heraus guckt. Die bekannteste Szene. ;-)

Doch zurck zu Fred, der gerade von einem anderen Penner mit Gasmaske aufgeweckt wird. Unter der Gasmaske steckt der Schwarze Burt. So geht es flugs zurck zum Laden, um sich eine neue Pulle zu besorgen. Dort kauft gerade irgendein alter Sack eine neue Flasche von dem Stoff  und zieht von dannen, grummelt was vor sich hin, klettert eine Feuerleiter rauf und setzt sich erstmal. Dann wird der Fusel ausgepackt und getrunken. Diesmal darf man nur vom Ton Zeuge des geschmodder's werden.

Also zurck zum Autofriedhof, wo Bronson auf einem Thron mit seiner schmutzigen, hlichen Gestalt, die Frau zu nennen sich hier eigentlich verbietet, rum macht. ;-) Tja, - Freddy und Burt sind derweil auf dem Schrottplatz aufgetaucht. Burt verspricht, etwas zum mampfen zu organisieren. Das geht zum Beispiel so, das er vor einem Supermarkt einen Bon aufhebt und seine viel zu weite Hose mit allerlei Kram fllt, von Honigmelonen bis zu Senftuben. Ein paar Ecken weiter taucht dann tatschlich der Manager auf und Herr Gasmaske versucht natrlich, mit dem alten ""ich hab dafr bezahlt"" - Trick aus der Affre zu kommen. Die Tatsache, dass auf dem Bon Hundefutter und nicht Hhnchen steht, tragen nicht gerade zur Klrung des Sachverhaltes bei. ;-)

Und wie lst der Regisseur die Szene ? Burt randaliert, setzt sich eine Papiertte auf den Kopf, rennt durch eine Glasscheibe und geht nach Hause. brigens hat die Szene nichts mit dem Rest des Film's zu tun und dient wohl nur dazu, mal wieder die nchsten fnf Minuten Spielzeit rum zubekommen. ;-)

Szenenwechsel. Bronson sitzt nchtens am Feuer und packt olle Vietnamkamellen aus, - Bronson's ... nennen wir es mal Frau liegt ihm zu Fen. Aber so richtig scheint es keinen zu interessieren, was ihr mutmalicher Anfhrer da von Metzeleien, Kannibalismus und sonstigen Leckereien zu erzhlen wei. Bei Fred und Burt dagegen ist die Stimmung gut. Denn der nette Herr mit der Gasmaske hat einen Whisky spendiert und man lt es sich bei Kerzenschein gut gehen. Nachdem Burt sich vom Acker gemacht hat, kehrt Nachtruhe ein. Bronson darf ein bisschen von Vietnam albtrumen (aha, - vietnamesische Kmpfer erkennt man am Strohhut und Vampirzhnen ;-). Bronson schlitzt ein paar Kehlen, befreit irgendeine Tussi ... und versteht nicht, worum es dabei geht. Auf jeden Fall wacht er auf, schmeit ne' Granate ber den Schrottplatz.

So, wenn sie bis hierhin, dh. noch, durch gehalten haben, ohne ein zu schlafen und mglicherweise auch ein paar mal (wenn auch kopfschttelnd) gelacht haben, dann sind sie wohl ein echter Trashfilmfan. Und genau an diese richtet sich dann auch dieser Film. Alle anderen, die nicht mal die Schmelzeffekte bisher ausgesprochen gut fanden, sollten diesen Streifen eben nur als schlechtes Beispiel werten. Oder, es vielleicht spter nochmal mit guten Bekannten in feuchtfrhlicher Runde probieren.

Schlu bis dahin, obwohl man das ganze auch noch weiter ausfhren knnte. Man sieht allerdings, das es sich hier um ausgesprochenen, echten ""Trash"" der obersten Gte handelt (und dabei habe ich sogar einiges der reinen Geschichte bis jetzt noch aus gelassen ;-). Trotzdem ist ""Street Trash"" absolut zum Kauf zu empfehlen. Warum ? Ganz einfach, - weil er unzweifelt so dermaen schwachsinnig ist, das dies bereits wieder gut wird. Zumindest, um allein oder mit Freunden dabei ab zu lachen. ;-)

Kauftip (dh. wer ihn schon vorher kannte, dem mu das ohnehin nicht erst geraten werden), sonst Ausleihtip [auf DVD bzw. mit etwas Glck sogar noch recht gnstig eines der alten VHS - Tapes ergattern]. Ansonsten, einfach mal ein wenig im Netz recherchieren fr weitere Kommentare und Szenenfoto's, - evtl. kommen sie ja dann noch vorher ungesehen auf den - schlechten - Geschmack.

Ach ja, und bevor sie mich jetzt pauschal kritisieren. ;-) Leihen sie den Film hier spaeshalber mal bei jemandem, der ihn bereits besitzt, aus, sehen sie ihn sich an. Und dann versuchen sie das mal, ber die wirklich extrem hanebchene Handlung hier etwas zu beschreiben, - viel Glck. ;-)",1356134400,,10160,5.235547355473555
438150,5,6302036941,"Street Trash is one of the single strangest movies I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. It's gross, it's funny, it's horrifying, it's pure, wonderful 80's cheese at its best.

The film's story concerns Fred and his teenage brother Kevin, who are adventurous young tramps who live the free life of bums in a New York City collision yard with their odd friend, a guy named Bert who always wears a gas mask and has, shall we say, unique methods of shoplifting entire feasts for the trio.

Fred is happy as a bum, but Kevin wants to reenter society, having been homeless since he was young and raised by his older brother. He's helped by Wendy, the collision yard owner's secretary, who has a serious crush on him. Fred is uncertain how to feel about his brother's ambitions, and begins becoming hostile towards him.

Alas, life isn't all fun and games for the two. Fred owes money to Bronson, the leader of a gang of psychotic winos who live in a neighboring junkyard. Bronson is an insane Vietnam vet who carries a sharpened human femur bone for a weapon, and runs a protection racket, extorting money, booze and whatever precious few possessions the local homeless people have. And so far Fred is the only one who hasn't paid up. Worse, Bronson has eyes for Wendy, and aims to eliminate Kevin and take her for his own.

In the meantime, liquor store owned Ed discovers a case of an ancient whiskey he's never heard of called Tenafly Viper, which he sells to the local homeless population (his best customers!) at $1 a bottle... unaware that one sip causes the drinker to die a horrible death by melting into a lifeless puddle of slime. Before long, people start disappearing, and the police begin finding their dissolved remains.

One night, while coming home to the yard drunk (thankfully not on Viper), Fred picks up a drunken woman outside of a ritzy club and takes her home with him, where they have sex. After Fred passes out, Bronson's gang abduct the woman and rape and murder her. As it turns out, she was none other than the girlfriend of the club's owner, mafioso wannabe Nick Duran. Duran, thinking Fred is the killer, puts a hit out on him. Suddenly poor Fred has a lot more people trying to kill him.

Yes, that's right, this movie, although famous for its special effects scenes of people melting, actually has a plot. And it's a fairly complicated one, too. I didn't even mention Bill the detective and his single-minded drive to bring down the dangerous Bronson and end his reign of terror once and for all, or the fate of one poor guy who commits the unpardonable sin of accidentally peeing on Bronson. The film is shot beautifully, the effects are great, and the story is scuzzy, funny and hilariously offensive. If you're a fan of 80's exploitation films, what's not to love?

Also to love is Synapse's DVD. The restored widescreen print looks wonderful, and it features two very informative commentary tracks as well as a documentary titled ""The Meltdown Memoirs,"" which pretty extensively covers Street Trash's production from beginning to end.

And be sure and stick around as the end credits start to roll. It's worth it.",1347840000,,3144,4.682971014492754
438151,4,6302036941,"""Street Trash"" begins with the owner of a liquor store in lower Manhattan finding a case of cheap liquor (""Tenafly Viper"") in his basement. After a little bit of research, the shop owner finds out the the liquor is over 60 years old and has gone bad....really bad. Nonetheless, he decides to sell it to the local hobos anyway for a dollar. A dollar for a bottle of liquor? That's a steal. What's the worst that can happen? It's not like the stuff is going to kill you. Right? Of course the rancid liquor does have some side effects. Turns out that anyone who drinks this Viper melts away in a hideous fashion. At the same time, two brothers find different ways to cope with homelessness, while an overzealous cop (Bill Chepil) tries to get to the bottom of all the deaths, all the while trying to end the tyranny of deranged Vietnam veteran Bronson (Vic Noto).

Sound like too much story for any one movie to handle? Well..you would be right. ""Street Trash"" is a mess and I'm not just talking about what happens to the hobos after they drink the Venom. Part ""Dirty Harry"", part social commentary, part Troma flick, and part ""Hills Have Eyes"", ""Street Trash"" doesn't stay in any particular genre for very long. Just when you think the movie has settled into horror, we get crude comedy (fart jokes anyone?), just when you think it has settled into Troma land with body parts galore, the film turns into a cop drama. None of it really gels. You know what? It doesn't matter. Why you ask? Because of the gore! Ohhh the glorious gore in this flick. You want to see a kalidoscope of killings? It's all right here in just about every color of the rainbow imaginable. I've never seen death in a horror movie be so....beautiful. That's right, it's beautiful darn it and when the movie focuses on the gore it is a rousing success. The fx in this movie truly must be seen to be believed. This is the kind of little gem that isn't for everyone and it is bound to offend most (rape, torture, homeless homicide..it's all here), but it won me over with its low budget charm.

438154,2,6302036941,"Being that this movie was released over 20 years ago, it will already have positive reviews due to nostalgia of peoples childhood or teenage memories of what they where doing when they where too young to realize this movie stunk, and the fact that the movie is rated PG, anything higher is a joke. (nudity is one thing, but an exposed muff is what would make this movie rated R, not the colorful blue or green slime that replaces any red blood in this film.

This movie's plot is pretty darn thin... for the most part, it's about a bunch of homeless guys, two sides of them, the good homeless, and the bad homeless, who all live either in a junk-yard or near it. The movie opens with Forty Winks legend ""Captain Snooze"" swiping a bottle of booze and running off in a chase that probably should have been sped up and put to the Benny Hill Show Theme to make it somewhat humorous. The next part of the story is that the liquor store owner finds a crate filled with bottles labeled ""Viper"" and figures they must be so old that he can sell them for a buck. Which any normal person would probably wonder if they had any value and done some research, but nope, anyway.... the Viper drink causes people to choke the instant you swallow, and your body turns to blue mush and you melt away. Now, the first time we see this, I admit, it is funny to watch in a stupid way. I won't say what happens, but lets just say the man flushes his life away... it's ridicules that a bunch of slime and badly made rubber masks could have been expected to be scary, but as a laugh, it gets a small chuckle.

Then there is a really horrible acted cop who is supposed to be as hard as it gets, but comes off looking like the worlds number one wanker who comes first, second and 3rd in every race. He is just doing his job horribly as the towns mafia man has just lost his girlfriend who was raped and murdered by some homeless men, while also trying to nail some ex-Vietnam homeless, insane, lunatic, pee-pee cutting off, Zach Galifinakis look-a-like weirdo guy who seems to be the leader of something, but I'm not sure exactly what other then being a perverted joke.

Also on the side is an ugly lady who works at the scrap yard who has such a heart of gold she feeds the homeless and has a real soft spot for the cute looking homeless guy who seems to have such a clean body when he is topless, it's only his face that makes him look homeless due to the small amounts of black makeup they put on it to try to emulate the look of dirt, which comes across more like light smudges of grease, because pretty boy didn't want all that real looking effect makeup ruin his perfectly moisturized skin. Yeah, it comes off pretty much in that direction, and she looks like a man most of the time too!

By the end of this movie, I thought, this is not an over the top funny gore movie like a Troma film, nor is it something you could say was a blood bath like a certain Peter Jackson film... nor does it take any direction like a normal movie... you might think this is going in a zombie direction, or something like that, but no, it's just pretty poor acting in a pretty poor script that tries to combine too much going on at once that doesn't pay off in the end.

There is only 3 good scenes in this film, which is why I don't give it the perfect score of 1. The first is the first Viper death scene I mentioned, another is a game of pass the parcel of a certain persons best friend that he wants back, and another is the last death of the movie that looked fake, but pretty cool at the same time. The rest of the film is either a waste of time, not scary, not entertaining, not funny, and not worthy of being up there with the true gory effect movies that had a story to them as well as visual effects, you could easily take out anything to do with the viper in this movie, re-cut it, and still come out with the same horrible movie I saw... maybe if I did see this all those years ago when it came out, or I was a kid and thought I was watching something I shouldn't, then maybe this would hold a place in my heart... but seeing it now... what a joke it is to try and rate it higher then ""barely watchable all the way through""",1329436800,,4194,4.1600985221674875

Freddie is a homeless troublemaker who must evade an angered mobster and the junkyard's psychotic leader after stealing something from each of them, while a mysterious liquor washes the city streets clean by turning the local bums into sludge! While the plot may seem simple enough, the directionless script is merely a collection of shocking and disgusting moments that are hobbled together into an incoherent day in the life of the city's homeless. Frumkes' outrageously over-the-top characters are not only content with their deplorable living conditions, but they revel in tormenting the wealthy and ruling over their squalid kingdom. STREET TRASH is most well-known for its ridiculous gross-out gore, but also for its unforgettable scenes of depravity, including a game of keep away with a severed penis and a hobo gang rape of a drunken woman. In all of its insanity, the film still manages to produce surprisingly high production values and an enormously entertaining cast, but what makes it worth watching is simply the fact that anything this twisted even exists.

438189,2,6302036941,"I cannot believe the number of positive reviews posted for this movie. They are what led me to view it. Though I see some of the points made by some of the viewers in regard to the film's big bang for the buck production values, no one seems to mention the fact that this is an ugly, mean-spirited, nasty piece of work. Almost no character throughout the entire film has any redeeming qualities. Even the ""bums"" (I guess they're no longer called homeless people)are terrible people. At one point in the movie a gang of them rape and kill a woman. What kind of sympathy are they supposed to garner from the audience?

I won't outline the plot, as most of the other reviewers have already done so, but yes, it is a bit convoluted and pretty stupid for the most part, but much of it doesn't even make any sense. The young lady who operates the junk yard where the bums are staying argues with her orca fat boss that he should let them camp out in the yard. He says no, they're bums. She says yes, they're runaways who she is trying to keep from becoming bums. But you don't see her trying to help them out of their situation. And virtually none of them are even runaways. They are all in various stages of maturity and ended up where they're at for who knows what reason. They had their shot and blew it. Even the one kid who is a truly ""down on his luck"" runaway shares some piss-diluted home brew with some of the others. Is he looking to better his circumstances or is the same as they are?

The main part of the plot (the winos drinking toxic brew and melting into day-glow sludge) is all by itself some brutal nastiness. These winos do nothing to put themselves in the good graces of the audience. One of them steals a bottle of the crud that ends up killing him so why feel bad about it. Just sit back and enjoy it as he corrodes into a nifty pile of goo? I suppose that might be fun in certain circles but I just didn't get it.

Nope. This is just one vile scene after another and it became irritating to watch. I can in no way recommend this film. I felt as though I needed to take a shower when it was over. Don't waste your time or money.",1252972800,2,2145,4.188861985472155

438192,3,6302036941,"Street Trash (Jimmy Muro, 1987)

Street Trash sat on my Amazon wish list for years before I finally gleaned a copy. I'm not sure what it was that originally drew me to the description, but having now seen it, I found it a lot more amusing than I thought I would. This is the kind of thing Troma would do if, you know, anyone at Troma had any talent whatsoever.

George Romero disciple Roy Frumkes (Document of the Dead) penned this tale of a liquor store owner who finds a case of rotgut made by a company called Viper in his cellar. He decides to sell it to the local bums for a dollar a bottle, which makes it popular. Unfortunately, it has some very nasty side effects, which vary from person to person (depending, one assumes, on what the special effects team had cooked up for the day). The various stories follow around a cast of bums, cops, social workers, and other undesirables as Viper makes its deadly way through the streets of New York City.

Muro, normally a camera operator (he's worked on such megahits as Dances with Wolves and Titanic), never directed another movie, and more's the pity; for the budget this thing must have had, it's actually pretty darned good, and over the past two decades it's developed a small but rabid cult following.  Unlike many films of its ilk, Street Trash sports a sharp wit and excellent comic timing (qualities which, unfortunately, Frumkes would never display in a script again; he was responsible for the Substitute series of action flicks and the Dutch horror debacle The Johnsons after this), special effects that are simultaneously quasi-realistic and way over the top (a la Dawn of the Dead), and some pretty decent acting. Yeah, there are also all sorts of things about it that could be better, but this is not a movie that was made with the Academy in mind, dig? Take it for what it's worth and you'll have a ball. ***",1233964800,,1876,4.55786350148368

438194,1,6302036941,"I heard about Street Trash through an exploitation website that had a myriad of sleazy pictures from all over the world that whetted my appetite for gratuitous sex and violence. When I recently decided to purchase a bunch of DVDs that I've been telling myself to get for years I thought it would be a good idea to throw in one of the better sounding movies from this site. Street Trash was the safest. A cheap liquor that causes people to melt! (or combust if you happen to be an obese bum) No, a woman gets gang raped by rabid hobos?! Is there anything more dreadful than that? Heavens no! And a shell shocked bum built like a pro wrestler is ruling the underground with an iron fist.  How could you go wrong? It got four and a half stars from the amateur critics at Amazon, which is what films like Glengary Glenn Ross and Naked mustered up, so if a movie this ridiculous got the same reception it must be an unforgetable, campy cult classic like the Evil Dead movies. So now I own a copy.

It is so awful. Awful! What a waste. The deaths from the caustic liqour were few and far between, barely even used as a plot device.  The stuff that could've got your stomach churning failed because they delt with it in such an inane inneffectual fashion.

SPOIL ALERT (i guess): Like the keep away with the severed dong and the chick being raped one more time postmortem by the fat junkyard owner.

It has the sense of humor of a sequel to Revenge of the Nerds. The only funny part was when the black bum berated an old white lady at the grocers. He was the only bum that had the spunky spirit of the fun bums that are usually in these kinds of movies, but most of the bums were generic; with the exception of the main bum who was some kind of lameo smart-aleck that whined all the time. Him and his brother seemed to be hobo poseurs. The dirt on their face was so contrived, like they applied it to themselves like makeup.

Basically, it wasn't intentionally funny ala Evil Dead 2 and it wasn't so over-the-top and humorless that it was unintentionally hilarious like Class of 1984. So any self-respecting person who'd usually be attracted to this sort of movie for kicks and giggles should know it's in that cheesy middle ground that makes it useless. Maybe it doesn't deserve one star but it's to give it a lower rating since people here give away gold stars like hippie fourth grade teachers. I disown this DVD!",1223251200,3,2409,4.378076062639821

438237,5,6302036941,"In just the first two minutes of the awesomely awful Street Trash, we are treated to instances of bad acting, shaky editing, implausible plot, garish title credits, and horribly hokey, electronic music.  And none of it matters, because Street Trash is the most unapologetically glorious and ghoulish film the good folks at Troma never made (but probably wish they did).

With a diabolical sense of humor and hilariously hard-boiled (and highly quotable) dialog, Street Trash is also quite possibly the dirtiest movie ever made - and I'm talking about dirt in the ""dug out of the earth"" sense, not dirty in a sexual sense (although there is a bunch of nudity, a dash of necrophilia, and a touch of wiener-tossing for good (or bad) measure (the last of which brings a more literal meaning to the word ""dismemberment"")).

Featuring fantastic sets (including quite possibly the greatest junkyard hideout in cinematic history) and authentic Skid Row New York locations, the grime is so gratuitously applied and supplied to places and faces that some of the actors' lips seem glow-in-the-dark bright by comparison.  The grossout effects are also surprisingly good for such a low budget filth fest (they were realistic enough to make me cringe, anyway).  For sure, a lot of this film's fun comes from watching each person having their, shall we say, colorful meltdowns...

Street Trash features the first work of such eventual cinematic luminaries as Jim Muro, the cinematographer of Crash (as well as The Last Mimzy!) and X-Men and Usual Suspects director Bryan Singer.  Equally notable is James Lorinz' hysterical first acting outing as the outrageously disrespectful doorman.  Plus one of the greatest end credits songs of all time, performed by Sopranos' stalwart Tony Darrow.

Stay away from this film if you're weak of stomach, but definitely feel free to use this delightful piece of cinematic grotesquery as a dieting aid, as this movie will do such a good job of making you lose your appetite that you'll be looking for it for days!  Ultimately, I think the best indication of the raunchy, sleazy ride you're in for with this flick is expressed by one of the last acknowledgements in the end credits, which reads: ""Thanks, Anita, for taking me to see 'I Drink Your Blood' when I was six.""

Produced and written by Roy Frumkes (The Substitute), and directed by J. Michael Muro, who since done stedicam work on such films as Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), True Lies (1994), L.A. Confidential (1997), and Titanic (1997) to name a few, Street Trash (1987) features Mike Lackey, Marc Sferrazza, Jane Arakawa, Bill Chepil, Pat Ryan (The Toxic Avenger, Class of Nuke 'Em High), Vic Noto (Innocent Blood), and Tony Darrow (Goodfellas, Analyze This, ""The Sopranos"").

The story basically involves the activities of two inner city homeless brothers named Freddy (Lackey) and Kevin (Sferrazza), who live in an auto scrap yard occupying a dwelling consisting of old tires.  Thrown into the mix early on is the appearance of some funky looking booze called Tenafly Viper, which was found in the cellar of a liquor store by the store's proprietor.  Subsequently he decides to pawn it off on his clientele, most all of whom are shiftless, degenerate dirtbags, for a buck a bottle (needless to say they snap it up).  Turns out the stuff is rotgut, literally (unbeknownst to the liquor store owner), so much so it causes the individual ingesting the crud to melt from the inside out.  Along with the exploding bums Freddy and Kevin also have to contend with Bronson (Noto), a large, sadistic, psychotic Vietnam veteran who rules the scrap yard with an iron fist and a dagger made of from a human femur bone (think a low grade Colonel Kurtz from Apocalypse Now).  Things get especially hairy when a local mobster (Darrow) finds out his girlfriend's been murdered (among other things) by the skid row denizens populating the junk yard, and a renegade cop with a serious grudge named Bill (Chepil) starts rousting everyone for kicks.

I guess the first thing one should know about this film is that there really isn't much of a story, which, in most cases, would probably be a disadvantage, but not so here (for those of us who tend to dwell in the cinematic sludge this is fairly common occurrence).  Probably the best thing you can do is sit back and let the experience envelope you in its grimy, odious, putrid fetidity, which comes off as a sort of sewage laden mix between the films of John Waters and Herschell Gordon Lewis.  I did learn a number of things from this movie, including the following...

1. One can actually make a home out of discarded tires.
2. If you wear baggy enough pants to the grocery store, you can steal enough food to feed at least three people.
3. I wouldn't eat anything that came out of a homeless man's pants.
4. You can thin out homemade hooch by urinating in it.
5. An alley is a great place to pick up broads, especially if you're a greasy bum (and the broad is wasted out of her gourd).
6. Your puke breath must be really bad when a bum won't even kiss you.
7. Frank, the morbidly obese owner and operator of the scrap yard, isn't adverse to a little necrophilia.
8. The homeless don't particularly covet showers.
9. A severed ding a ling a can be used in lieu of a football in a pick up game.
10. You never defile Bronson in front of the men.

If you like your movies messy, in a visceral sense, then you've come to the right place as this spectacularly over the top nugget of gooey nastiness is right at home next to Peter Jackson's Dead Alive (1992).  I'm unsure the deal with the Viper booze, but its effects are instantaneous and highly satisfying.  There's some seriously nasty melt action here, perhaps my favorite being the early scene with guy sitting on the toilet, taking a slug, and then reduced to a slimy, festering pile floating in the bowl.  Along with the gratuitously goopy goodness there's also a whole lot of comedy, a few fights (the most memorable being Bill the cop going toe to toe with Bronson), some female nekkidness, a severed male member, and whole lot more.  The acting was pretty rank but it didn't take away from anything for me, especially given the entertaining dialog throughout.  The two best lines (at least of the ones I could post here), in my opinion, are the one I used for the title of my review and the following, occurring after one of Freddy's acquaintances, after shoving copious amounts of food down his pants, is busted by a manager in a grocery store ...

Store manager: I'd like to know what you're doing with all that chicken in your pants.

As I said, there's a decent amount of comedy here, the funniest part for me, beside the flying woody sequence, was when Freddy picked up the drunk broad in the alley, after she just finished puking.  As he was dragging her back to his Goodyear abode, she kept trying to kiss him and he kept try to avoid it, given her puke breath and all.  To sum things up this is a completely vile and disgusting affair, one definitely worth the time if you have the stomach.

This new 2 DVD set released in 2006, entitled 'The Meltdown Edition', includes an anamorphic widescreen (1.78:1) transfer, audio in a newly remastered Dolby Digital 5.1 and the original 2.0 mono, two audio commentaries featuring producer Roy Frumkes and director James Muro, a two hour documentary entitled The Meltdown Memoirs, which details the history and the making of the film, the original 16mm short film that inspired the movie, a Street Trash promotional teaser, a behind the scenes still gallery, liner notes, and the original theatrical trailer.  The interesting thing is, while the 2006 DVD release contains a ton more stuff than the original 2005 DVD release, the newer version is missing one really cool element...with the original DVD release there was included two printed label stickers so you could create your own bottle of Tenafly Viper.

The movie is about a liquor store owner who finds a supply of an old alcohol called ""Tenafly Viper"" in a compartment of his store. He then sells each bottle for $1.00 attracting bums and ""street trash"". After ingesting this liquor the people begin melting down within seconds.

438279,4,6302036941,"The ultra-low-budget exploitation flick STREET TRASH (1987) certainly lives up to its name in more ways than one. Not only is it rather trashy when it comes to generally poor or histrionic acting, bawdy humor, gore, and several lingering flashes of T&A, but it is also one of the few films set in New York City's skid row that was actually filmed almost entirely in authentic skid-row venues.

The centerpiece of the paper-thin plot is a case of decades-old hooch called Tenafly Viper, discovered in the miasmic basement of a skid-row liquor store by the store's proprietor.  The unscrupulous vendor decides to exploit his seemingly serendipitous find and pad his pocket by selling the stuff to local winos for a buck per bottle.  But unbeknownst to him and his unwary customers, the stuff has gone sour and has transmuted into a volatile toxin that literally melts those who consume it into a pile of day-glo goo.

Though STREET TRASH is blatantly and disgustingly lowbrow, it is nonetheless wildly entertaining and, from a technical standpoint, very well made.  The make-up FX are skillfully and artistically executed, and never have latex appliances looked so simultaneously gross and hilarious.  The action does lag in a few spots, but most of the time there is a constant flow of either gore, skin, or bawdy gags.  Also, in contrast to many near-zero-budget exploitation films, the cinematography is fabulous--director Jim Muro shot the entire film using a rented steadicam, and he was so skilled at it that he went on to become one of Hollywood's greatest steadicam operators, working on such films as TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY (1991), TITANIC (1997), AND RED DRAGON (2002)--and the editing is near perfect, making STREET TRASH look like a more mainstream, bigger-budget film.

While the acting skills of many of the principals leave a lot to be desired, STREET TRASH does feature a few thespians worth noting.  Genre fans will recognize James Lorinz from his role as the mad scientist in the exploitation satire FRANKENHOOKER.  In an earlier role here, Lorinz plays a lippy doorman in the employ of a mob boss, and he steals the show in nearly every scene in which he appears.  Actor Tony Darrow portrays the aforementioned mob boss, and Darrow parlayed his debut role here into a career of playing similar types in more mainstream gangster flicks, including critically acclaimed films like GOODFELLAS (1990), BULLETS OVER BROADWAY (1994), AND MIGHTY APHRODITE (1995).

The DVD release of STREET TRASH from Synapse is a no-frills disc, but its definitely worth the price of admission.  It offers a digital transfer of the film--which has been nicely restored and is completely uncut--in its original aspect ratio of 1.78:1 (enhanced for 16x9 TVs), and the stereo soundtrack is also nice and clear.

Sick? Yes. Foul? For sure. Gross? Often.  But its also a lot of fun.  STREET TRASH is definitely not for everybody, but for those who enjoy exploitation horror flicks from the 1970s and 1980s, STREET TRASH is definitely one of the best.  And the DVD from Synapse will make a fine addition to the collections of those who enjoy such films.",1130544000,54,3145,4.982791586998088

438282,4,6302036941,"I had thought that this movie was legendary, but a few months ago when I told some of my acquaintances (with great excitement) that ""STREET TRASH is coming out on DVD August 30th!"" None of them even knew what I was talking about...maybe it's time I got some new friends.

A sleazy liquor store owner in bum town finds a mysterious case of booze in his basement, some of the local winos get a hold of it and next thing you know they're all melting and/or exploding into acidic primary color goo.  That's the main story most people remember but there is actually two other intertwined stories going on: the police investigation of a mafia guy's girlfriend who was raped to death by a zombie-like pack of bums and the adventures of a bloodthirsty Vietnam vet who thinks he's king of the junkyard (he's the one that does the dong chopping in the infamous penis football scene).

The picture on the Synapse DVD is great, but I was disappointed by the lack of subtitles or any extras.  I'd love to hear an audio commentary.  Also the cover art is lame compared to the art on the old videocassette.

The plot follows a couple of vagrants who live in a New York junkyard where a bum named Bronson rules with an iron fist. Meanwhile, a local liquor store owner finds a case of old hooch in his basement and sells it for a buck. Anyone who drinks Tenafly Viper instantaneously melts in a colorful array of gore, leading a detective on a wild goose chase to get to the bottom of everything.
