3517814,5,B001CT05LC,I can hardly wait to watch this series now that I have Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD. It was definitely worth the twenty dollars I spent and I can't wait for the remaining seasons to be released on DVD.,1262995200,2,195,3.9
3517815,5,B001CT05LC,"I purchased this to watch with my nine year-old son. I was a fan of C.H.i. P.s when I was his age, and still am today. The picture quality is great. Most episodes feature a quick blurb from ""Ponch"" (Erik Estrada), in which he discusses the making of the episode, which is interesting. Definitely recommend this for fans of the show. I only wish I could find all seasons (until it jumped the shark and replaced Jon).",1262304000,,415,4.402597402597403
3517816,5,B001CT05LC,"Just got this set and I am jazzed. ""Chips"" seasons 1+2 together for under twenty bucks! Growing up this was one of my big-time favorite shows.

Disc 4 from season 2 contains a couple of special features including ""The Real 'Chips' with Erik Estrada"" and ""The Greatest Adventures of Chips"". Also forgot to mention that certain epidodes from season 1 contain a special feature called ""Ponch's Police Tips"" where Mr. Estrada recalls some memories from that episode. All this for under twenty bucks, get it now!",1257984000,17,1914,5.352159468438538
3517817,5,B001CT05LC,"Some shows don't stand the test of time, but Chips is not one of them.  I hadn't seen the show in years but its just as good as I remember it being when I was a kid.  I got it for an excellent price and I couldn't resist.  If you enjoyed Chips when it was on during the 70's, I would definitly recommend that you get it now!!",1250726400,,325,3.75
3517818,4,B001CT05LC,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about CHiP's? It's good clean fun about a strange land and time far away and long ago: 70's Disco-era California! LOL! Disco Cops on bikes, all the hot 70's mama's in their skin-tight polyester and Dorothy Hamill hairdo's, crap-tastic vintage 70's cars and bikes (which crash and flip regularly), the plethora of nostalgic guest stars, etc. ...what's not to like?

A word about the packaging: Cardboard outer sleeves and ""slimline"" plastic DVD cases hold the DVD's. For what has to be a ""cost saving"" move by WHV, the second season substitutes those lousy ""flipper"" (re: double-sided) DVD's for the single-sided DVD's with proper artwork on the top surface as used in the first season set. You know, the one's that develop errors and/or become unplayable as time goes by (if they play at all when new). Come on Warner, give us the quality we're paying for with our hard-earned dosh! Now...where's the remaining season sets?

Four stars for content, One star for the double-sided discs of season two!

ADDENDUM: CHiP's Seasons 1-2 are now available repackaged as individual sets of single-sided disks for BOTH seasons in more typical 'stacker-style"" DVD boxes, instead of the ""slim-line"" sleeves in cardboard boxes that this combo set originally had. Of course they're no longer packaged as a set, and the price has increased. In addition, Season 3 is out and also packaged as single-sided discs in stacker boxes, with Season 4 packaged likewise and available for pre-order as of Jan 2016.",1246492800,9,1533,4.98046875
3517819,5,B001CT05LC,"""CHiPs"" is one of the great tv shows of the 1970's!  It not only has plenty of action and adventure, but also comedy, drama and good storylines.  Larry Wilcox & Erik Estrada's tv characters compliment each other, making them a perfect team, which also makes the stories even better.  With that, you can relate with the show.  There are also plenty of other regular characters to enjoy on each episode with the likes of Sgt. Getraer and fellow officers Grossman, Baricza, Cindy, Bonnie, Fritz, etc.  This makes for a ""family-oriented"" atmosphere and in turn creates a show the whole family can watch.  Along with the plenty of car chases on the California freeways, there is lots of other locales to see: the CHP headquarters, the officers homes/apartments, area stores, discos, businesses and much more.  Each episode not only focuses on the officers working lives, but also their personal lives.  Add to this the background disco music, beautiful California scenery and an array of big & small name guest stars (and stars to be), this definitely makes CHiPs all the more interesting and a ""potpourri"" in the world of television.  It brings back good memories from my teen years and will bring back good memories for you too.",1243209600,4,1225,4.879227053140097
3517820,5,B001CT05LC,"The pilot episode of the hour-long drama series CHiPs premiered on the NBC-TV network on 9/15/77. Between then and 5/3/83 (six seasons), a total of 139 chapters aired, making this one of the most successful of TV cop shows.

Set in Los Angeles, it's the adventures of motorcycle officers Joe Baker (Larry Wilcox) and Francis Llewellyn 'Ponch' Poncherello (Erik Estrada). Amazingly, these guys hardly ever unholstered their sidearms, no matter what trouble arose.

Other regular cast members for seasons #1 and #2: Robert Pine as Sgt. Joseph Getraer, Paul Linke as Officer Arthur Grossman, Brodie Greer as Officer Barry Baricza and Lew Saunders as Officer Gene Fritz.

Numerous comic actor ""walk-ons"" give these 45 episodes a light touch in spots: Jackie Vernon, Phyllis Diller, Jim Backus, Shelley Berman, Tom Poston, Richard Deacon, Carl Ballantine, Rudy Vallee, Alice Ghostley, Danny Bonaduce, Alan Sues and Jack Carter. In addition are cameos from: Troy Donahue, Regis Philbin, Broderick Crawford, Edward James Olmos, Ned Glass, Guy Stockwell, Markie Post, Ken Kercheval, Mary Crosby, Tige Andrews and ex-footballers Rosey Grier and Ben Davidson. (Note: the lion's share of these guest spots occur in Season One.)

Cheesy as it is, I think this was when television was at its best. Who can say wrong about the shows of that period with the awful stuff they have on today? A-Team, Rip Tide, Chips, Simon and Simon, Magnum P.I., Mcgiver, Blue Thunder,  Knight Rider, and who can forget The Dukes of Hazzard? Pretty much everything from late 70's to mid to late 80's. All innocent good family fun compared to what is shown these days.",1444435200,,551,4.247619047619048
