8574842,5,B00BWS4F0U,"Great ppv again but doesmt top BFG 2012

Joe/Magnus TV Title - this was a rematch from their great bfg match and this was a "" no dq "" match but only no dq moment , was usage of the chair but to be honest this delieverd as this topped their bfg match and was freaking great prob 2nd best tv title match behind the best witch was ""AJ/Williams"" from fr 2010 but this was a great opening match and really set the stage for the rest of the show with joe retaining

ODB&Eric Young/Jesse&tara - This was a terrible mixed tag match just skip it

X Division Title RVD/Joey Ryan - this was actually a decent/kinda good match but ended to quick it went for 7 mins but i liked it as for the new kid joey ryan vs the vet rvd the x champ this wasn't ur ""Spotty"" X Division match bit ryan had a really good performance as did rvd for his 2nd x title defense , but they couldve gave it like 10 mins tho . but decent solid match here

now for the Aces and Eights Part of the show

Doc/Joseph Park - actuallly this is really doc "" luke gallows "" vs joesph "" abyss "" and this was ok nothing special other than park going into his normal abyss mode he did for yrs when he saw tht he was bleeding plus they let gallows be himself witch was great so tht made it an ok and kinda watchable .

TNA Tag Title Chavo&Hernandez/Daniels&Kaz - this was an excellent tag title match but this was a match of revenge for kaz and daniels cause they lost the belts to chavo and hernandez at bfg 2012 but this was awesome and great .

AJ Styles/James Storm/Bobby Roode Number 1 Contenders match - this was intresting to watch cause whoever lost couldn't face the whc champ till bfg 13 , witch made this an excellent and amazing Triple Threat Match witch woulde remind u of the best tp 3 way ""aj/joe/daniels from tp 09 "" but this was awesome i liked it alot great action , 2nd Match Of The Night

2nd part of aces and 8s part for the show

8574843,5,B00BWS4F0U,"TNA is still much better than the WWE, which is no loner even watchable for me. This PPV was great; the ladder match was absolutely awesome. I have no complaints, this was one of the best wrestling PPV's that I have seen in a few years. This was well worth the money.",1367452800,,267,4.153846153846154

No Disqualification Match: Television Champion Samoa Joe vs. Magnus - A Bound For Glory rematch that started on the outside & made it's way into the ring with both men trading momentum with similar offense like high knees, Magnus blocking a suicide dive with a steel chair, and Joe catching Magnus in mid-air with an atomic drop.  Magnus kept trying to beat Joe at his own game going for various submissions like the armbar & Coquina Clutch before going back to using the steel chair before Joe regained the offensive with moves like an over the rop rolling dive & Muscle Buster only for Magnus to keep begging for more.  This was a very stong opening match that really put over Magnus' toughness for not only bringing a fight but taking a beating as well.

Eric Young & O.D.B. vs. Tara & Jesse - Young & O.D.B. kept working over Jesse with even O.D.B. delivering a bronco buster that caused her husband to plead for one as well before Tara attacked from behind to gain the advantage & retain it with double teaming before O.D.B. had to resort to beer & a low blow to gain it back.  This was your typical Eric Young style comedy match but it was entertaining.

X Division Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Joey Ryan - Ryan's tag partner Matt Morgan was banned from ringside for this match.  RVD took control with his offense such as the top rope legdrop & monkey flip out of the corner only for Ryan to catch RVD in the middle of a setup to gain the advantage back with his offense of a suicide dive, spike DDT, and mustache ride only for RVD to come back with his educated feet & signature moves.  This match was solid but nothing special once it was over.

Joseph Parks vs. D.O.C. - Parks wanted revenge for what the Aces & Eights did to him in the clubhouse leading up to Bound For Glory but was still inexperienced in the ring causing D.O.C. to just easily shove him around & toy with him showing until Parks was able to keep avoiding him causing D.O.C. to get easily frustrated.  D.O.C. kept beating on Parks telling him to ""stay down"" using whatever weapon he could to the point where Parks was bleeding which caused him to snap for a minute & show offense that was similar to his brother Abyss.  They did a good story of continuing to tell the story of Joseph Parks not being a trained professional getting into a match that he shouldn't have been but past that, this was only watchable.

Tag Team Champions Chavo Guerrero & Hernandez vs. Christopher Daniels & Kazarian - Kaz & Daniels took advantage showcasing their superior experience as a tag team with various double teaming & frequent tags while executing a ""divide & conquer"" strategy singling out Chavo before Hernandez took the momentum back his power & size advantage.  This was a very good as both teams were evenly matched throughout the contest.

A.J. Styles vs. James Storm vs. Bobby Roode - This match had an important stipulation in that the person who loses the fall wouldn't be able to compete for the TNA Championship for the next year until Bound For Glory.  Styles took high risk early on with a flip dive onto both men but clearly showed signs that he was a bit off his game by slipping on the apron or missing his offensive moves including one that sent him hitting the turnbuckle going over the top onto the guardrail head first.  Storm & Roode continued their fight from the Bound For Glory while later having a brief Beer Money reunion as Styles got back in the game working over Storm's leg with submissions like the figure four & an indian deathlock/chinlock combination.  This was a very nice triple threat match but was more about telling the story in regards to Styles trying to get back on track after the awful year he's had only to clearly be off his game at times throughout the match.

Kurt Angle vs. Devon - Devon took control early & was very dominate before Angle caught him in mid-air with an over under throw followed by multiple german suplexes as they traded momentum with Devon in control with moves like the spear while Angle was able to keep taking advantage of an opening & countering his offense.  The match was average but only here to continue to story of Angle's involvement with the war against Aces & Eights as shown by the finish & aftermath.

Ladder Match: TNA Champion Jeff Hardy vs. Austin Aries - This started off normal between both men but didn't stay that way for long as the ladder came into play very quick starting with a tug of war on the outside followed by various high impact moves like a russian leg sweep off the ladder, a dive into an upside down open ladder followed by a roll on the ladder with the other sandwiched inside, and trapped on the outside with the steps on top of the ladder.  The ladder continued to be used as a weapon such as when it was shoved from underneath causing a crash & burn onto the mat, one man the ladder being rode down onto the other, Aries doing a missle dropkick knocking one off the ladder, both men falling off one ladder landing on another, and more than one Twist Of Fate using the ladder.  This was a very good ladder match that saw not only some impactful spots but also told the good story of Aries constantly trying to out think Hardy.

This was one of those PPV's that had a mixed bag of everything from in-ring wrestling to brawling to entertaining comedy (depends on your sense of humor) as there wasn't a bad match on here but some matches were just here to continue their storyline more than anything else (both Aces & Eights' matches).  In the end, it's still a PPV worth checking out.",1365379200,,5808,4.4627006610009445
