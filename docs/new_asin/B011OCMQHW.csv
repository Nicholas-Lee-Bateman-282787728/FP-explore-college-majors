I was very disappointed. Slow, contrived dialogue and characters with little depth or believability. I always hope against hope that we will finally produce worthy, well done Christian movies and to be honest, they are far and few between. I would suggest  'revelation road' series because it is incredibly well done, well written and has a professional quality in all the sequels too.

The reason ""they"" can't make a good ""Rapture movie"" is because it isn't founded on scripture. The entire concept is actually not even based on Revelation scripture, but Thessalonians.

7339237,3,B011OCMQHW,it was kinda interestin as far as a rapture movie would go but to be honest we don't know how bad it will really get .. ( it could get a lot worse actually too )  but i thought it jumped around a bit too much from the 4 different story lines and you were in los angeles and then japan and then argentina and then on some island in the pacific perhaps close to new zealand ?? and in japan its all in japanese with subtitles and the same for argentina .. so for half the movie you're readin subtitles .. and yeah i understand the writer and director wanted to show the global scope of what the rapture would do .. i just wish he woulda just told us they were in argentina or japan and let them speak in english so it would have flowed better .. i might have rated it higher .. ehh.. maybe not .. i think its a 3 star movie .. and to be fair i hardly ever give anything 5 stars .. so maybe you'll like it more than i did ?? this is just my opinion ..,1467158400,,947,3.8071065989847717

I thought the acting was good, story line was good, the events located in different countries scenario was good, but I was disappointed Jesus was not mentioned more and there weren't more Scripture verses about the Rapture mentioned so the audience could reference later.

I will state up front that this shoddy excuse for a movie is why the Christian market is going to continue to be ridiculed, it is just a really sub-par attempt at movie making.

It had a very low budget feel, with extremely poor acting. The outside scenes have horrible sound quality, and the editing is choppy at time. The script itself was quite rudimentary, especially the ""God"" parts where they sought to speak of the Bible or Gospel and the attempts at being cynical - very cheesy writing and delivery. And we really, REALLY could have done away with the extended subtitled sections - those could have had just as (weakly) of impact if they were performed in English. It became quite irritating quite quickly.

The makeup was very generic and poorly executed, again, exposing an obvious low budget, as well as the frequent dropping out of dialog throughout the movie. I watched this movie along, thankfully, and I came away horrified at just how very poorly executed this attempt at a movie was, and felt this should not have been shared with the public, as only Christians who believe this unbiblical, fictional scenario are going to appreciate it.

Check out this web page if you want more Biblical support on this subject.: [...]

Matthew chapter 24, verses 29-31 and Mark chapter 13 verses 24-27 also describe the return of Jesus Christ and the gathering together of the elect.  Matthew chapter 24, verse 31 also refers to the fact that Jesus' return will be heralded by the sounding of a trumpet. His angels will be sent forth ""...with a great sound of a trumpet..."". This is significant because a previous verse, verse 29, states that this event will take place ""...after the tribulation of those days..."". We know that this refers to the great tribulation because verse 21 says,

For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not
since the beginning of the world to this time, no,
nor ever shall be.

So, the trumpet that will sound at the return of Jesus Christ will be the last  trump to sound. There cannot be another return of Christ and the sounding of another trumpet.

*************************************
********************************************

The pre-tribulational rapture doctrine presumes that since the Church is not mentioned after Revelation chapter 3 that Jesus Christ will take the saints out of the world before the tribulation.

This key point of the pre-tribulational rapture doctrine is based, not on what the Bible says, but on what it does not say. What the Bible does say in the book of Revelation is, that saints will be on the earth during the great tribulation. See Revelation chapters 13, 16, 17 and 18.

The word ""saints"" in these chapters of the book of Revelation is translated from the same Greek word that is translated ""saints"" in the rest of the New Testament.",1459036800,,1812,4.872964169381108

The camera, its all over the place... like the director was trying everything he/she learned in film school.
The writing... the actors have been given some horrible lines to day... cheezy stuff.
The story telling... like the camera... is all over the place... now to backflash to less of a backflash to another character backflash to that character now... really horribly cut and edited.

I chose not to believe in Allah, Jehovah, Thor, or any other ""god,"" so the explanations offered in the movie are of value only if you come into the movie with belief.  Otherwise, an all powerful, all loving, but hands-off god who allows souls to die miserably for 7 years because of the ""rules"" he put into effect, but can break on whims (ex. Did pharaoh, Pilate, Goliath have the chance to accept the only one god or was their disobedience key to saving ""other"" lives?) resonates with me not at all.

I could actually accept that god is petty and unconcerned, rather than all loving.  But not both.  I'd do anything within my power for my DOG, yet a sovereign deity won't lift a finger for a HUMAN, after the rapture, because that's the rule?

Its silly but accomplishes the fire and brimsone message successfully. At least it's free with ""prime"" membership, but I'd still rather spend money on Captain America or Thor.

That is how it will happen. There will be a time of Christian persecution that has never been worse or ever will be.
Carmen is a great contemporary Christian artist but I feel sorry for anyone who believes that this movie is accurate in describing eschatology, especially him because he has been deceived or is ignorantly using his influence to deceive others.
There will be no second chance for those left behind. Take a look at what happened with Lot & Noah because that is how the ""rapture"" will take place, the persecuted and reviled believers will be taken up and glorified after the righteous dead are resurrected (1Thess. 4:13-18; Rev. 20:4-6).",1454112000,2,1244,4.528888888888889

7339728,5,B011OCMQHW,"I wouldn't normally give a movie 5 stars with this movie's obvious low production value, but the value is in the message, and is one of the more likely realistic Rapture movies I have seen. The movie touches on a lot of things that others miss, such as how many of those left behind thought they were Christians, the great deception (alien abduction) and how any Rapture theorizing would be forbidden, price gouging, and how media plays a large part in controlling the masses with disinformation now, pre-Rapture. It also shows how Christians are made to feel dumb through publications, media, and even in education as a way of suppressing our beliefs and views. The movie follows 4 different stories, similar to Babel, which is something else you don't see in many Rapture movies, but it shows that we are all the same when you get down to the basic tenants of life. Another reviewer posted that it is doubtful that anyone will turn post-Rapture, and I understand why, because it is important to be ready now and not take the chance, but about not turning I disagree. Many who were close to Christians will immediately recognize what happened and will know that the Bible does speak of the Tribulation Saints who find Christ and persevere unto the end, but about getting right now I do agree. I don't think things will decline and society will break down as rapidly as depicted in the movie as I honestly do agree with the movie that many who think they are Christians will be left behind, meaning not that many will be taken and most infrastructures won't be greatly affected by the disappearance of Christians and children below the age of accountability, but it will happen fairly quickly. The world is already heading into a state of chaos with wars and rumors of wars, famine, and so on, so I believe it will feel more gradual because it is already happening.

If you are looking for a really good Rapture movie this one blows away anything by PureFlix, and the content and context is pretty on point.",1451692800,9,2007,4.653521126760563

It details each person's reactions and coming to terms about, what to them, is the end of the world.  As  the reality of how dark things are becoming, they go back into their memories of warnings and signs they had missed, with each reacting in a different way.  It wasn't preachy and mostly not political, except for the professor, going back in his memories, when teaching about how God is dead and a fantasy.

Receiving the love of truth is paramount to escaping what is coming. It seems to me that after the Rapture people will not be able to turn around.

7339739,5,B011OCMQHW,"The first half of the film is pretty by-the-numbers: there are obstacles, those obstacles are overcome, then there are setbacks. This is what keeps the film going (apart from the ensemble's winning performances) but it may become repetitive for some. However, the strong second half builds and builds to an incredibly emotional and riveting climax that catches you off guard. Unfortunately the sequence ends abruptly as we fast-forward to the unnecessary ""and everyone lives happily ever after"" montage when the last days are actually at hand.

However, what could've been a bleak, cynical tale of survival becomes a first class feel-good blockbuster.

(PS  It's easy to take the visual effects for granted, but it is superb.)",1444780800,3,726,5.241379310344827
7339740,5,B011OCMQHW,"I agree with the other guy who said it's a very chilling film....

......if you watch the movie, keep this mind: the first viewing asks questions that are answered in an 'I could kick myself' moment in the final few minutes, and the second viewing is interesting because when you know the answers, the film becomes that much clearer. Every story has to be paid enormous attention to. It requires a certain amount of commitment, though. Be warned, if you stop concentrating for a moment then the remaining running time of the movie will be spent trying to figure out how what you missed has lead to what you are now watching. Especially the Japanese story.

The character Colin is good, but not flawless, as the tortured NBA player who is torn between his career and his wife - none of it matters because he's so LEFT BEHIND. I never felt it gave motive enough for his actions throughout the movie. The professor guys is so wonderful as the anti-Christian professor and is effective with the results both cunning and tragic. The real star of the movie, however, is a strangely accented Japanese man who has no name. He effortlessly plays a character of terrible coolness and poker-faced efficiency leading the dance that the rest of the characters must follow. His ending speech left me in chills",1444521600,6,1295,4.700440528634362

It's themes of religion are scary to anyone seeing it, on whichever side you are on....I do not really understand the ending, but this is a film that goes where rarely any films go, and should be seen by anyone. I am surprised I had never heard of it....I feel God led me to see this film....The film shows the agony of people going through the tribulation once Christ returns in the Rapture.

8724785,5,B011OCMQHW,"I really liked this movie.
Yes, one could write about the low budget for filming and special effects, but here these enhance the movie!
The special effects are on the human scale, realistic, thus.  No cities blowing up, but tiny cheap made events like rape and robberies and chaos on the interstate!  In other words, the kind of disasters you might really see, if this movie were to happen in real life and you were on a city street.
Too, the filming had the quality of a home movie made with a camera bought at a electronics store.  More realistic.  Almost like a news shot in someone,s living room, say.  Thus the entire movie has a quality of a documentary from real life.

Hmm....here too in this movie is an airplane scene where a passenger vanishes, just like in the other left behind movies.

But this movie really really shows to me who the anti christ is!

Yes, I know there are a zillion ideas as to how the second coming and end times will unfold, the movie seems to take the timeline to be
Seven years before the end of everyone.  There is no mention of the antichrist.  No one super dictator emerges who rebuilds the Temple in Israel!
Jesus says......I am the vine, ye are the branches thereof .....each saved person is part of the Christ.
Thus the antichrist is any branch that is not connected to the Vine!  Thus ""self"" rules the person.
Materialism.  Sex.  Power. Control over things and control over people.  The qualities of the antichrist.
  In this movie we watch the lives of the four people not only after the rapture, but days and months before the rapture.
The movie skips around the timelines.  This illustrates why this person was not raptured.

Think about it, if the rapture takes every saved, good, spiritual person away, who is then left?!  Why only the people who have the antichrist life!
Read:  every single character in this movie, even the four ""heroes""!  Every single person is out for themselves .
Of course the police state arrives and one can see how dictators will soon emerge, the ""opposing"" force of good spiritual people are not now there.  Downhill from there.  Everything will begin to break down, within those seven stated, in the movie, tribulation years.
Distribution systems of food, why each person will hoard, not share.
Military increases, fear of loss of control.
Robbery?  Each person will steal.
Rape, why not!
Feeling empathy for someone suffering?  No no...only I count.

Thus in this movie the ""part two and three"" is not needed!  One can understand what will happen within the next seven years.
Disease...volcanoes, wars...conquest.....
No one left by the end of seven years.

The antichrist is amoungst us all right today!

Listen to that professor challenge his students when several say they are saved and have experienced miricles.  Chilling.  In his context it is
Him...100.. student...0. !  Society supports him, not the student.  Then notice his anger after the rapture, his anger is that his material goods are gone and his stocks are now worthless as the DOW falls to an incredibly low level and the banks are closed!  One would have to break him, drive him insane, before he might consider that there is a God!

The movies seems to infer that one cannot now repent.  Probably like once the train doors shut and the train begins to move, you were late to get to the station platform by twenty seconds, now too too late, you cannot get on the train.

So now I know who the antichrist really is!",1488067200,,3461,4.670529801324503

Great thing about that is that you get more than one view of the rapture. Watched on prime and when it wasn't free decided to purchase on my own.",1486252800,,333,4.459016393442623
