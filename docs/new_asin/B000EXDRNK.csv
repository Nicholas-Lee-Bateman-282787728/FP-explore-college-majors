2544438,2,B000EXDRNK,"This is not a very imaginative story. It's ok, but only just!",1415923200,,61,4.166666666666667
2544439,3,B000EXDRNK,"I liked it for its time, when it was made it was done very well.",1413158400,,64,3.3333333333333335
2544440,1,B000EXDRNK,some of it was ok. good story it just seemed whokie to me. not my kind of sci-fi . i like movies like h.g. wells time machine i can understand some of the set being a little off . be the story was great,1402617600,4,202,3.6136363636363638
2544441,3,B000EXDRNK,OK mid-60's adventure.  A family gets stranded on a deserted island filled with prehistoric animals and a young native man undergoing a tribal test.  I have the 905 Entertainment DVD release and the quality is only OK.  I would like to see a re-mastered version released very soon.,1390867200,,281,4.8125
2544442,1,B000EXDRNK,"I could not sit through it, especially the part where they started playing music and dancing. It seemed, at first, that it could have been a decent horror/adventure movie, but it turned out to be a really bad ""family"" adventure movie - and some weird sort of ""beach bingo"" element added in.",1373414400,,290,4.596153846153846
2544443,1,B000EXDRNK,"This movie is bad,bad,bad. Terrible picture quality , but then again, it is over
30 years old and really, It should be ""Put to rest""..",1344556800,,134,4.4
2544444,4,B000EXDRNK,"A fun little film from the Golden Age.
Sort of a prototype of  Gilligan's Island, Castaway and other ""desert island"" films.
If you are a fan of 1930s films, you'll enjoy this.
If you are a shallow fan of modern, color films with car chases, stay away; you'll just be confused and unhappy.",1443139200,,288,4.433962264150943
2544445,4,B000EXDRNK,"Very Entertaining, although it is obviously one of those family friendly films from the 1950's.  the FX is very antique and the dialogue corny.  However, it is still lots of fun and beautiful scenery.",1442102400,,200,4.852941176470588
2544446,2,B000EXDRNK,Ok,1441670400,,2,2.0
2544447,2,B000EXDRNK,Pretty hokey for today's standards.  Watch something else.,1440633600,,58,6.25
2544448,1,B000EXDRNK,"Just awful!!!  B movie for sure, the acting is so immature.  Don't waste a moment of your time!  You will regret it!!!",1440201600,,118,4.2727272727272725
2544449,3,B000EXDRNK,A fun movie for those who like the simple made-for-tv movies of the 70's and 80's.,1437436800,,82,4.1875
2544450,5,B000EXDRNK,"I can understand why many reviewers weren't impressed, but I grew up in the 1940's and 1950's, and was delighted to encounter an entertaining film without pretense or sophistication, just a good story well told, and with very competent cinematography. It was wonderful to visit a bit of the past. There aren't many advantages in getting old, but nostalgia is one of them. Happily, I also love the glorious heights the industry has reached now!",1436400000,4,443,4.92
2544451,4,B000EXDRNK,"A fun family friendly adventure with a mix of Gilligan's Island and Swiss Family Robinson plus a splash Land of the Lost.
A campy 60's anthropologist escapade in uncharted waters. A great time for all.",1435795200,,201,4.771428571428571
2544452,3,B000EXDRNK,Ok show,1431648000,,7,3.0
2544453,2,B000EXDRNK,It was an ok movie,1429401600,,18,2.8
2544454,2,B000EXDRNK,"Richard Green, star of televisions 50's series ""Robin Hood"" attempted this lame role for a film and it flopped so loud you could hear it from NYC to LA!  Not his fault really, probably due to a poor contract via his agent who rooked him into this Drive-In Triple feature, the last offering on the Bill!",1429142400,,302,4.392857142857143
2544455,1,B000EXDRNK,IT WAS REALLY BAD,1428796800,,17,3.5
2544456,4,B000EXDRNK,"(First of all, the angry green monster depicted on the DVD cover isn't in this movie.)
This `movie' is a blast from the past circa 1967 and is indicative of entertainment made during that `family-friendly' era.  The plot involves a family vacation/expedition to discover undiscovered islands that may contain unknown species of plant and animal life to fit a theory put forth by the head of the family/expedition leader/anthropologist (Richard Greene).  This small group includes his children and a few tag-along so-called expects in something or other.  Meanwhile, on a mysterious island, a young man is ceremoniously dumped on shore and left to fend for himself.  He is soon hounded by a pack of toothy killer dogs.  He does the only sensible thing he can.  He tosses his only weapon at them and jumps off a cliff.  As this melodrama is unfolding, the family is still sailing-sailing over the ocean blue until their compass goes haywire and misdirects them to the very same mysterious island.  Their adventures include evading the vicious island creatures, making a dandy house, and building a new boat after their vessel was sunk in a typhoon, all hands onboard (no loss as they were headhunters looking for stray noggins).  The excitement is mild, almost as happy-go-lucky as the score, which favors a lot of harp action.  The `monsters' are doctored dogs, ostriches, and gators made to look fancy and/or prehistoric.  They're not very convincing.  There is a lot of underwater photography (sharks and the like).  It's almost like a travelogue with a bit of a plot thrown in.  The transfer is negligible.  I bought it purely for nostalgic reasons, having grown up during that time period.  It's not very well made (why mince words, it's crappy movie).  The continuity leaves much to be desired as the film hops around a lot trying to land somewhere significant.  It should be noted that in that endeavor it never really succeeds.",1427414400,,1933,4.950310559006211
2544457,5,B000EXDRNK,I enjoyed the movie a great deal.  A good family movie and good for people who prefer wholesome movies.,1425945600,,103,4.421052631578948
2544458,3,B000EXDRNK,Didn't watch all the way through.  Gave up on it after 10 minutes.,1425945600,,66,4.076923076923077
2544459,3,B000EXDRNK,Really an old time film.  Some will like others won't you just have to click in and see if you like it.,1425168000,,103,3.6818181818181817
2544460,3,B000EXDRNK,It was ok but predictable.  Luke Halprin had grown up some from Flipper days,1425081600,,76,4.428571428571429
2544461,5,B000EXDRNK,"This is a great video, Richard Greene fits the charactor fine, but don't expect him to use a bow. I am glad I bought the DVD, very entertaining, and suitable for all ages.",1423353600,,171,4.212121212121212
2544462,5,B000EXDRNK,Cheesy in a 1960's kind of way. It was entertaining.,1421452800,,52,4.3

8115515,4,B000EXDRNK,"I  liked this movie because it reminded me of the Danger Island show that was on the Banana Splits, as far as the print goes its full screen with faded color. The credits even jump at the beginning. The music reminded me of Jonny Quest. I enjoyed it and did not pay a lot for a new dvd..",1495497600,,287,3.9482758620689653
8115516,3,B000EXDRNK,"A bit biased. I was in this, movie, under an assumed name thankfully. ""Luke"", if you're still alive and read this - or if not and still read this - you're still an idiot.  Sorry Irene you got your foot in the boat propeller.",1465171200,,224,4.090909090909091

8115519,5,B000EXDRNK,"A  rare movie at the right price. Packaging was very good, product arrived within a reasonable time. DVD was in excellent condition. No problems. Thank you .",1453680000,,157,4.814814814814815
8115520,2,B000EXDRNK,"This is an Ivan Tors mash-up of Swiss Family Robinson and The Mysterious Island.  As such, it would usually have beautiful photography and underwater sequences.  Well, those things are present here, but -- sadly -- the print on this DVD looks like it was sourced from a pre-HD TV station videotape: not as bad as VHS, but certainly not DVD quality.  It loses a star from me for that.  Otherwise, it's a fairly standard TV-style lost island movie.  The ""monsters"" are really just animals with tusks and horns added -- though the ostriches look pretty darn good as killer birds/dinosaurs.  (Until, of course, you see their fluffy bodies.)  Like I said, not bad, but a good print would have improved it.  It features one of the stars of the old Flipper TV show, so fans of that may want to give it a look.  Oh, and BTW, the monster on the cover is NOT in the film (but I didn't want to dock it another star for that.)",1449792000,,914,4.392857142857143
8115521,2,B000EXDRNK,The movie was ok. I like the idea and theme of the Island. But it lacked the action I was looking for.,1447113600,,102,3.6818181818181817
8115522,2,B000EXDRNK,Ok,1446768000,,2,2.0
