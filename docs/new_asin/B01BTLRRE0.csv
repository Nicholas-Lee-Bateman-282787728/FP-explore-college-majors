7669183,5,B01BTLRRE0,"Best series ever. Hands down. Acting is so real and vivid I felt that I was watching a documentary. The writing is extraordinary, the plot twists are mesmerizing. The cast is pitch perfect. In the heartrending leading role Aden Young is ""glorious"" -- to appropriate a word that crops in this magical yet gritty series quite a lot...",1476748800,4,332,4.741379310344827
7669184,5,B01BTLRRE0,I have been enjoying this series....it is a little dark and slow moving but it seems more real as the character evolves after being incarcerated for so many years....not to mention trying to fit into his family again.  It strikes me as being fairly realistic!,1476576000,,259,4.7555555555555555

7669187,5,B01BTLRRE0,I really enjoyed the first three seasons of Rectify.  It is difficult to imagine the psychological impact of having gone to prison for a murder that you never committed and 20 years latter being released only to be balled up in more town nastiness and exile away from your home.  I hope season 4 comes out.  I would at least like Daniel to come out on top and the two others hang for their crimes.,1475539200,,397,4.266666666666667
