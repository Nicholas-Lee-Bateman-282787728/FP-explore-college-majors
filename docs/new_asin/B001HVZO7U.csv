3645052,5,B001HVZO7U,"While this DVD covers a great deal about special effects makeup, the majority of the program centers on mainly one special effects makeup lab, KNB.  It would have been great if they could have showed out makeup labs as well.",1316131200,,224,4.6
3645053,3,B001HVZO7U,"In this documentary they reference the fans who like them. Grew up on effects and has seen all of their favorite artists works. I am that fan and I can say that all the stories in this are ones we've heard before.
There is no real flow at all either they just jump back and forth to different stuff without any segue,Its just a series of random interviews and random clips that don't always have anything to do with what the interviewee was talking about.

There a lengthy scene with Tom Savini where he describes a scene from ""Dawn of the dead"" where Flyboy gets shot in the shoulder and how he did the effect on the spot with no preparation it then cuts to a clip from a different part in the movie where someone is being eaten. This documentary seems to constantly build up without fallow through.

I was expecting to see behind the scenes stuff like people working on effects, besides the occasional store room shot there's no real insight as far as art or process and the few historical things that are presented are in no particular order and would be hard to fallow if I didn't already hear the story somewhere else.

If your like me and must see everything with spfx in it. I recommend renting or borrowing this, like I did. I would have been even more disappointed if i had  paid for it",1310947200,,1295,4.360995850622406
3645054,4,B001HVZO7U,"Good video to have for people who want to learn more about Make-up FX artists in Hollywood, and their craft, from the professionals themselves.",1310688000,,143,5.0
3645055,5,B001HVZO7U,This was a b-day gift for my husband who is truly into make-up and special effects and he was amazed and so was I,1271894400,,113,3.75
3645056,4,B001HVZO7U,"General interviews with special effect makeup artist, not a how to video, but interesting.  If you are a huge fan of classic horror and more of a fan to the makeup artist side that creates the monsters and such, this is a much see have video.",1254268800,,242,4.260869565217392
3645057,5,B001HVZO7U,"Granted that it is a documentary, I found it informative as far as the history of make-up effects up until present day. Little did I realize that there were other great artists aside from Lon Chaney, such as Jack Pierce, the creator of the iconic Universal Frankenstein Monster who created the pieces from mere cotton! It also has unique behind the scenes footage from movies old and new, showcasing how these incredible minds set forth their craft even before the advent of show-stopping CGI. Even better, it shows the latest direction in which CGI and Practical effects have become intermeshed and how they will affect future movies. While the title sounds like a how-to video, it's more of an appreciation for the people who started it all. There is even a tribute to Stan Winston who had passed away suddenly from a rare blood cancer (see Fangoria magazine in 2008, october issue I think) which I think was quite touching.",1240272000,14,926,4.79375
3645058,1,B001HVZO7U,"Fantastic Flesh: The Art of Make-Up EFX, was completely misrepresented and truly disappointing. Absolutely no tangible information. As a special effects artist, I expected more that a line up of Makeup artists telling their personal stories. My recommendation is to AVOID it, I'm sure it will be on television in the very near future.",1233792000,7,334,5.203703703703703
3645059,5,B001HVZO7U,"""Fantastic Flesh: The Art of Makeup EFX""  is a terrific documentary combining technique with film history.  Featured are scenes from such horror classics as ""Frankenstein,""  ""The Exorcist,"" ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""An American Werewolf in London,"" ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" and more.  Since the advent of CGI filmmaking, audiences have become jaded by cinema monsters, but this film focuses on the pre-CGI era, when assorted techniques and long hours were required to transform actors into abominably awful-looking creatures or victims of horrible violence.  This is a must-see for aficionados of the horror genre.",1233446400,9,614,5.559139784946237
3645060,3,B001HVZO7U,"I'm not sure if what I watched is what others are commenting on. I purchased this thinking Brad Bird would be hosting, but he and Carroll Ballard are not anywhere in this video, which includes the credits. As well, on Amazon's description of the video, Gary Leva is billed as the director but Kevin Vanhook is the actual director listed in the credits... ????

I'm a huge fan of this kind of FX work and makeup, so I'm rating it 3/5 in spite of the info disparity (which slightly affected my expectations). Anyhow, the poor video quality is countered with a litany of Hollywood heavyweights, but I'm still confused about the info that Amazon has billed it with. Plus, is that Tom Cruise on the cover? Again, I'm wondering if there's been a mix-up by Amazon on this.

If anyone who rated this 4 or 5 stars can verify whether or not the version you saw had Brad Bird in it, I'd be greatly obliged. I'd love to see that video if this was just a goof.",1393459200,,947,4.344632768361582
3645061,5,B001HVZO7U,"I am sure he liked it, he is a bit odd this way,  LOL  truthfully he is a make-up artist and holloween enthusiest!",1391990400,,114,3.9130434782608696
3645062,5,B001HVZO7U,This book had a lot of really great information and details on how to create realistic movie makeup. From zombies to human wounds it gives really good step by step instructions and a lot of greatly detailed photos. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a good movie makeup guidebook.,1390780800,,295,4.92
3645063,4,B001HVZO7U,I wanted to show it in class but there was some language and nudity that made it impossible. Wish something existed JUST like it that was cleaned up for use in schools.,1388361600,,168,4.28125
3645064,3,B001HVZO7U,"I'm not sure what I was expecting.  I love to watch the ""making of"" specials of movies so I can see how things are done, it fascinates me.  While this production had some of that, I remember mostly interviews describing how long it took to put on the ""effects"" and how much different it is today compared to when movies were first made.  It has plenty of shots of actors in makeup but not much technical detail of how it is made or applied.  It seemed very dry and I am not anticipating wanting to watch it again.",1386720000,5,513,4.204081632653061
3645065,5,B001HVZO7U,Got this for my grandson and he loves it. He made me up as a doll whose face had cracked and it looked solo real. I guess it teaches you what you need to know if you want to get started in fx make up.,1381104000,,200,3.466666666666667
3645066,4,B001HVZO7U,Consider a worth purchase for reference.  Variations of Special Effects Makeup is impressive and very helpful although there is no guide of how to do it.,1369612800,,153,4.884615384615385
3645067,5,B001HVZO7U,"When I originally ordered this, I thought it was a step by step ""how to"" DVD. But it is not. Never the less, it is an awesome documentary on the art of special effects by the best of the best in the biz. Overall, I am a satisfied customer!",1365552000,2,239,3.8979591836734695

3645091,5,B001HVZO7U,"I loved this DVD. I got it for my significant other who studies special effects. He was amazed by the vast amount of information on this DVD. It also has interviews with so many top names in effects, such as Greg Nicotero and Rob Bottin. Very Cool! If you are interested in horror movies or special effects makeup, this is the one for you!",1356998400,,339,4.3125
3645092,4,B001HVZO7U,"I ordered this with a bunch of other items.  I had a project to do but I wasn't sure where to start.  This item didn't happen to be part of what i used, but I put it in the library for possible future needs.",1355788800,,207,3.6818181818181817

3645094,4,B001HVZO7U,"It is a very cool DVD, shows you the people behind the scenes. I however thought they would show us how they do some of the tricks of the trade. They show a lot of clips, and how they ""arranged scenes"", but not what they used or how they made things. Very interesting to watch, just not an instruction documentary. I recommend if anyone just wants to see some behind the scenes of horror movies.",1344816000,,395,4.28
3645095,2,B001HVZO7U,was disappointed that this did not help start off a desire for creating visual effects. it was just a documentary on how those in the past and present got started in it and how long they have been doing it aswell as their films,1338249600,,227,4.181818181818182
3645096,4,B001HVZO7U,Very nice video with lots of good info on make up FX artists.  With such a low price I can't really complain.  This is not so much an instructional video as it is a documentary.  I've enjoyed watching it several times.,1327536000,,218,4.2682926829268295
3645097,3,B001HVZO7U,"This film didn't really have much in the way of educational information.  It was basically a bunch of big names in the business talking about what they enjoy about doing their work, a handful of personal stories lacking detail and a few cool behind the scenes moments.

The enthusiasm of the interviewees makes this worth a watch or two as a rental, but it's not really worth the price unless you want to own everything related to Special FX.",1327276800,7,442,4.582278481012659
3645098,3,B001HVZO7U,This get you know more about the industry of prosthetic makeup in the film industry. It would not get you to become masters but rather than a introduction of the prosthetic make-up industry.,1321228800,,190,4.787878787878788

8309810,3,B001HVZO7U,"A little disappointing , more of a documentary of the greats of Special effects makeup. No hands on or how to on this DVD.",1420329600,,122,4.125
8309811,5,B001HVZO7U,Loved it.,1418860800,,9,4.0
8309812,5,B001HVZO7U,"This is a great documentary all about special effects and provides a lot of historical information about the development of special effects in movies.  People should not order this expecting a lot of how to information: what products are used, how to construct them, etc.  This is not an instructional video, and if you order it for that information you will definitely be disappointed!  But this is a great documentary that is both entertaining and informative, well shot, and well edited.  Any movie buff will enjoy this fun little feature and it's a great deal (I got mine for about $7), so it would make a great gift for your aspiring actor, makeup artist, theater/movie fan.",1403654400,3,679,4.827586206896552
