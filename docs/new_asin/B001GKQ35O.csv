8305771,5,B001GKQ35O,"This Video Actually Shows the Collapse of Society More Than Describing Bicycle Safety.

As someone who has lived in San Francisco, and still frequently visits, it was interesting to see how MUCH better things looked in the 1940s.

Anyway, many of the ideas shown in this film are valid today.  I think children should wear bicycle helmets.  However, as an adult, I don't wear one. I do recommend this video, you'll find it useful and entertaining.",1446336000,,447,4.842105263157895
