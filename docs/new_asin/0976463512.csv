7794737,2,0976463512,"The title should have been ""Build a Steel String Guitar from a Kit"".  There is very little insight, tonewood theory, woodworking advice, nor information offered that is necessary to be able to build a guitar from scratch.  For those who want more than a video accompaniment to kit-building instructions, this is not for you.  For those who want a video on kit-building, it may be.",1365206400,,380,4.815384615384615
7794738,5,0976463512,I have always wanted to build a guitar and thought it too difficult. Robbies DVD has inspired me and I have started to build a guitar. This DVD has excellent instruction. The still shots are very well organized and have allowed complete information on one DVD. This is an very good value as other builders require 5 to 10 DVD's to convey the same information.,1235779200,,359,4.538461538461538
7794739,5,0976463512,"I don't think you will find a better DVD on the market, period! He even shows you step by step how to build a mold, a side bending machine for heating blankets, but also shows you how to bend over a hot pipe. There are a lot building resources out there, but most of them are old school. O'Brien has combined old school with new modern techniques to create a easy effective way of building a guitar. The is the 'Bible' of Guitar Building DVD's. The slide show format gives O'Brien the ability to cram the 120 hours of guitar building into a 4 hour presentation. The menu's are broken down into small topics that help you navigate the build process with ease. This DVD comes with all LMI Acoustic Kits, and there is a reason they chose this DVD for their kits...it is simply the best!",1217808000,,783,4.333333333333333
7794740,5,0976463512,"Playing guitar on and off and dabbling in wood working most of my life I have always had a dream of someday building my own guitar. I had a vision that I would need to find a ""Master guitar builder"" to apprentice under in order to ever hope to demystify the guitar building process. The idea of building a guitar on my own without a mentor or some sort of support seemed overwhelming and impossible. The short story is that I ordered O'Brien's DVD and the materials to build my first guitar and have now completed not one but two exceptional guitars! Robbie's instructions were clear and concise and took most of the fear and guesswork out of the process of building a fine instrument. As a woodworker I learned many new woodworking skills and techniques. As a guitar player, I knew the instrument from the outside in. With Robbie's DVD I learned the guitar from the inside out. I learned things about the guitar that I had never known even after 30+ years of playing. This DVD is a tremendous resource for anyone, experienced or not, considering building a steel string acoustic guitar.",1217462400,,1087,4.608247422680412
7794741,4,0976463512,"I had read several how-to build a guitar books, but never would have attempted a project without this DVD.  The author gives you detailed pictures of each step as he narrates the process from starting with a box of lumber to a beautifully finished instrument.  Robbie narrates the DVD intelligently and with humor.  You will learn such technical terms as a ""skoshe"".  You can print out some PDF files that have important dimensional information to keep with you as you work.  I also found the section on ""Extras"" section on jigs and fixtures to be quite helpful.  Whether a hobbyist or someone looking to build guitars for a living, this is an excellent place to start.",1217289600,,669,4.724137931034483
7794742,5,0976463512,"This is absolutely THE best instructional resource you can buy for leading you step-by-step through the process of building a guitar. There are others out there (I've got them all), but this one really is head and shoulders above all the rest. O'Brien teaches people how to build guitars for a living, and it really shows in this DVD. He understands the challenges that a first-time builder will confront, and clearly shows how to tackle each one.  And, he references different ways of doing things that are really helpful to folks who don't have elaborate workshops or every tool or expensive jig out there.  You'll find yourself referencing this DVD over and over again as you approach each phase of your guitar-building project.",1217289600,2,731,4.934959349593496
7794743,5,0976463512,"Some folks may be turned off when they learn that this DVD is actually a compilation of lots of still shots.  Don't be - the accompanying narration and the detail in the shots does an excellent job of conveying every aspect of steel string guitar construction.  Rather than trying to interpret what the author wrote in a book, you get Robbie's clear explanation of the steps, key points and things to look out for along the way.  I watched it end-to-end the first time I viewed it.  Now I use it as a reference guide for my kit building project.  It's great to be able to jump right to the section I need when I start a new phase of construction or get stuck on something.",1217116800,3,672,4.301587301587301
7794744,5,0976463512,"If you have ever wanted to build your own acoustic guitar, this is the perfect place to start.  This is such an amazing instructional video.  Actually, video isn't really accurate.  It's entirely still-shots; thousands of them, which is a great format.  You can really see all the details of what Robbie is doing.  Everything is clear and to the point, and even entertaining as well.  This DVD is really what got me started building steel string acoustic guitars.  Highly recommended.",1217030400,2,484,4.975
