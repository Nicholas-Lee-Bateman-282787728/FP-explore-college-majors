8567737,3,B00BFG26CS,"It's on you tube.
Watch the whole movie with subtitles then decide if you want to buy it. I did.
It's definitely more of a FOX kids Utraman Tiga type feel to it but enjoyable none the less.",1400198400,3,189,4.0

8567739,4,B00BFG26CS,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen!  Being a tokusatsu fan, I had to see this movie & especially have it to ""rightfully label myself"" an Ultraman fan.  The only problem I have are the subs do not quite sound the best, thus I knocked off a point from my rating just for that minor inconvenience (I could understand the subtitles with those minor flaws, anyways)",1366588800,6,373,4.314285714285714
