8724121,3,B011DEL76W,"I'm giving this item a middle star review because it is an AUDIO DVD, not a VIDEO DVD. I've never owned one of these before, so I was a bit disappointed  there were no video clips or anything like that to accompany the music. What this audio dvd gives you are over 100 Sons of the Pioneers songs that MUST be played on equipment rated for DVD-R recordings. Be forewarned there are NO song listings or anything that's going to tell you what you are listing to. For the packaging and information, I rate this item 1-Star. For the music of The Sons of the Pioneers, I rate this item 5-Stars.",1437523200,4,588,4.297297297297297
