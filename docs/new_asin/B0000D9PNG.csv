1921676,2,B0000D9PNG,"Leprachaun 5: In the hood, was a cult classic. Mostly because of its political incorectness and chemistry between the main characters. However, in this one, the sixth installment, they tried too hard to be goofy. The jokes were lame, or rather they weren't executed well (like when the police confiscate a whole garbage bag of weed from the guy's house and he responds, ""Oh, dat stuuf, dat's oregano, my momma is ""Eye-tal-ian"" and she like lottsa oregano in her lasagna""). And the leprachaun doesn't talk (or rap)or blurt out riddles like he used to. And where are my ""zombie fly girls""?! Oh well, <sigh> I guess good things like ""In the hood"" don't last forever, just leave it to some knucklehead to go out and ruin something that was already divine.",1073692800,,751,4.740458015267175
1921677,4,B0000D9PNG,"Well here it is. The sixth in the Leprechaun Series.  Were we last left off the Leprecahun was in the Hood, killing all the homies, but after being killed off again, we all thought that his time had passed.  But now 3 years later, a new company, and a new producer comes the next installment.
The Film starts with Emily falling down a hole in an abandond construction field.  Once in there she finds a forest, and a treasure box, which she finds has an unlimited supply of gold.  When she finds the money, her and her friend go on a spending spree, but what they don't realize is that they have awakend a Leprechaun that Wnats his Gold.
I had very, very low hopes going into this movie, and I'm glad to say that i was pleasently surprised.  This has got to be the best Leprechaun film in a long while.  The Cast (for the most part) actually knows how to act... I know shocking, lol.  And in this installment they do into the mythology of the Leprechaun, which i like alot.  And Tangi Miller (from Tv's Felicity) plays the main character.
The Special FEatures include 4 storyboards, the Trailer, a Commentary with Davis and the Directior (Great & Fun), and another Commentary with the Technical Crew.",1073606400,17,1199,4.467889908256881
1921678,2,B0000D9PNG,"I'm a really big fan of this series, and had high hopes for this one, but it just fell flat.  Too much of the human characters (I don't really CARE if bike boy is trying to ""do the right thing""), the Leprechaun got his backside whipped most of the movie, the killings were neither imaginative nor graphic, and there wasn't anything that really surprised me.  The only really funny part was the bong scene, which was pretty much done in the first ""Hood"".
How you can botch a Leprechaun movie is beyond me, but maybe it's the curse of the evens (the odd numbered ones are MUCH better than the evens).  The end was pretty lame, too, and didn't make a whole lot of sense.  Extras on the DVD were pretty much non-existent.  I'll still buy the box set when it comes out, though.  If you like this series, check it out just so you've seen them all, but this movie was a waste.",1073174400,3,869,4.2682926829268295
1921679,2,B0000D9PNG,"I am a huge fan of the Leprechaun series, but I must say, this was a pretty bad one. It had some pretty funny scenes, but the Leprechaun never said any funny riddles like he did in all of the others. The main reason I like the series as much as I did was because I thought the Leprechaun was hilarious, but I didn't think he was in this one. As long as you aren't expecting a whole lot, this is a very enjoyable film and was still much better then ""In Space"".",1073001600,,459,3.946236559139785

1921761,5,B0000D9PNG,"LEPECHAUN
BACK 2 THA HOOD

When  last we had left the Lep he was in control of a rapper and doing his own thing on the mic, of course he was in the hood. Well that turned out to be such a big hit for the company that they decided that they wanted to go back to tha hood. So here we are and once again and once again it is another very fun film. This time though the film  while still very funny also is a bit more serious especially in the action and kill department.

A group of friends happen upon the Leprechauns gold and decide that they can use it to better their lives. This of course brings the Lep back to the hood to do no good. So has he hunts them down the film goes from very funny to actually serious and goes on to blend the two well together. The script here from director Steven Ayromlooi and his direction was perfect for the franchise and added a new element to it. Some of the old mythology is here along with some very new ones, like no magic here for the most part.

Also the acting is very good here which was always hit or miss with these films. The lead group of friends all do an excellent job as do the villains including rapper/actor Sticky Fingaz. This film as some very cool moments like the showdown with the cops [very funny moment right after in the police car] and some hilarious ones like Warwicks facial reactions when smoking and when he gets hungry. Speaking of Warwick you all know he is just brilliant here as always.

Like all the other films in the series this one is very fun and not meant to be taken seriously when watched. I would highly recommend this series to any horror fan out there that enjoys horror/comedy. I know some don't think the two mix well but I disagree whole heartedly. Pick up the new Blu-Ray box set.",1415232000,,1765,4.176470588235294

What matters is that Warwick Davis plays the Leprechaun and, as always, is funny, creepy, and EVIL!  He's similar to Freddy Kruger in that regard.  In fact, if you liked the later, cheesier Nightmare on Elm Street movies or any of the Chucky movies, you will probably like this one.  So, if you like campy, fun, and even sometimes gory horror, you'll love this movie...and all of the previous 5 Leprechaun movies as well.

1921787,2,B0000D9PNG,"Ah, Leprechaun. Where would we be without ye? Well, we'd be better off without this sequel of a sequel. Apparently the ""hood"" premise was successful enough to warrant another one. The animated intro is promising, although it looks like it didn't make it past the animatics stage. I could probably find out what happened if I could be bothered to listen to an audio commentary (this movie, unbelievably, has two). It presents an interesting backstory to the Leprechaun myth that doesn't exist in any of the other films. Whatever character development gained here is squandered to nothingness with the remaining cast. Jamie is crazy nutzo over Lisa. I couldn't figure out why Lisa, Emily, and Rory hang around with this genius. And I never thought I'd miss those three no-talent ass-clowns from the last movie. The Leprechaun did have the decency to disrupt the mushy love story between Rory and Emily. But that was only temporary. Anyway, the Leprechaun wants his freaking gold!",1365724800,,977,5.0

1921791,5,B0000D9PNG,"Yes folks Warwick Davis is back again at his scary best in the sequel to ( Leprechaun In The Hood ) with Ice Tea that one is scary and hilarious. This one is nasty scary hilarious and gory at the same time once again someone finds his gold. Outside of an old building a young woman just starting out accidently falls through the floor when it colapses beneth her feet sending her crashing down below she finds a small chest filled with gold coins and that is how it starts. The freaky thing I found largely intriguing is that when the small treasure chest holding the gold is empty it refills itself with gold coins, to bad our bank accounts couldn't do that muwhahaha

She and her friends share the gold enjoying their new found wealth little does this poor group of young people know what is coming until our little green menace shows up and starts reaking bloody havoc throughout their neighborhood on his murderous rampage to collect his gold. He smokes reefer parties and is totally hilarious as a stoned leprechaun

The ways some of the people deal with him is hilarious like the foxy girl in her bedroom with the shot gun shoots him blowing his head off and says damn crooks alawys breaking into and robbing folks houses there are curse words used in the movie dialog that I left out but the comment will crack you up it did me, Excellent cast very likeable characters and a nice plot and our little green devil make for a great sequel",1352764800,,1442,4.458333333333333

The Leprechaun's murderous limericks are completely missing, which eliminates a large amount of potential humor. The story, although better than putting the Leprechaun in outer space, is dull. But what really stomps it under is that fact that in an attempt for humor (I hope it was anyway, and not a deliberate move) the film comes off more than just slightly racist. The characters are written as if every single black person in an urban area is obsessed with sex, money, drugs, and themselves and nothing else. The only white character is, conveniently, a police officer. There's an Italian-american too. He's a drug dealer who's afraid to come into their part of the city. All of them were just written so reprehensibly that I couldn't sit through it, even knowing that a majority of them would die. Maybe it was because all the deaths except one were unexciting. Maybe the fact that the Leprechaun's humor which was middle-school quality before has been demoted to elementary-school quality. Probably all of the above.

Anyway, Back 2 Tha Hood was a good addition to the franchise. The Leprechaun's sense of humor came back with a vengenance in this one - and I loved the scene where the thug is trying to act tough while is girlfriend is yelling at him on his cell phone.

In the early movies, the Leprechaun only killed after giving people an opportunity to return his gold. In this one, he starts killing everyone - even if they had nothing to do with stealing his gold. Although there is a witch in the movie who uses magic, I was disappointed that the Leprechaun didn't use any this time out. He was a much more physcial threat.

That is, the cinematography and direction is not far behind any recent blockbuster, which doesn't say much for recent horror movies... The acting is predictably cheesy, but at least it doesn't take itself too seriously.

However.

Lep doesn't rhyme at all. He doesn't rap (as he did in what I now refer to as ""Back 1 tha hood"", retroactively). The movie has it's moments of ridiculous glee, but it's not as much of a train wreck as previous Lep movies. Especially the previous ""Back 1 tha hood"" and ""Lep in Space"" debacles.

Being one who only viewed this movie for the entertainment value of how awful it was, this does not bode well. When the movie is trying to be scary (and it is one of the scariest lep films, imagine that) it's merely boring.

Listen to the director's commentary for a racist remark. ""Because you know, having a white person steal from a black person is a bit of a role reversal!"" met by silence from a probably stunned Warwick Davis.

Here's to Lep 7: Back 3 tha hood being better.",1137110400,3,1114,4.414634146341464
1921807,5,B0000D9PNG,"I am one of the people who love the Leprechaun movies(some people hate them).  But they do have a fan bases and I actually think Leprechaun Back 2 tha Hood is the best in the series.  But I haven't seen Leprechaun 1 and 4.  So it is the best of the series so far.  It probably still will be the best  after I watch 1 and 4.  The reason I didn't see those ones is because my movie store only has Leprechaun 2,3,5,6.  Leprechaun 6 is also really funny.  Which anyone who has ever watched a Leprechaun movie knows they are comical  I couldn't stop laughing half the time.  I think Leprechaun fans will love this movie and people who didn't like Leprechaun in the Hood should give this a chance and watch, because they are very different movies.  I wasn't very pleased with Leprechaun in the Hood myself and I found myself really enjoying this one.  One of the things I enjoyed about the movie is the action, it had pretty good action.  It also had a great preformance(as usual)by Warwick Davis(the Leprechaun).  By the way the Leprechaun looks the best in this one too.  Make-up wise and costume wise.  One thing I am wondering why didn't the Leprechaun use any of his magic, he could have at least used it once, even though him fighting it out all the time was great.  I at least wanted him to use it once.  I think in Leprechaun 7 he should fight it out mostly all the time but use his magic maybe a couple times to do something, just open a door with your magic once, at least you used it.  With a cheap DVD price it is worth buying because it is a good movie and has a good replay value.",1111363200,8,1588,4.198675496688741
1921808,5,B0000D9PNG,"Ill be honest, this wasn't the best flick in the series, but I love it just the same, being 100% irish as I am, I love the mix of evil and irish, so much in fact half of my tattoo sleeve in the leprechaun himself.",1110067200,5,213,3.7555555555555555
1921809,2,B0000D9PNG,"Mediocre describes this laughable direct-to-video with the Leprechaun going back to the hood and starting a killing spree looking for his gold. Basically a remake to Leprechaun in the Hood with terrible special effects and bad acting but this movie is so inept and hilarious its almost as absurd as Leprechaun 4 and this funniest parts are when the Leprechaun jams a bong in a man's stomach and when he rips a cop's leg off while wanting to fight. Watch only once or twice but stick with parts 1,2,3.",1106352000,2,500,4.629213483146067
1921810,5,B0000D9PNG,"This film is my favorite in the whole Leprechaun series.  I liked 5 because he talked in rhymes and even rapped, which I didn't think was that bad.  This film has a lot of good stuff in it.  I like how it was funny, but also kind of creepy.  The whole party scene with him was hilarious and I loved when he came face-to-waist with the gang of drug dealers.  It all came to a close that I just didn't want to see, the ending.  I loved the movie and hated to see the credits roll onto the screen.

The film is about poor people in the hood who stumble across a bunch of gold, which won't go away.  They start using it for their own things, and so the Leprechaun comes for them.  I liked the dialogue because it was so off the wall at times, it was downright hilarious.  What's wrong with laughing at a horror movie?  It means you enjoyed something about it a little differently than others.

I think they should make another in the hood because it seems like the ones set there are the funniest and most creative.  I thought the one in space was actually really good too.  Now I think New Line needs to follow this formula putting Jason in the Hood because that would be fun to watch.  Jason do a drive by with his machete sticking out the window, chopping rival gangmembers in half, smoking weed with his homies, getting the munchies!  That would be cool.  But Leprachaun Back 2 Tha Hood is definitely worth buying, even if you laugh.  It's supposed to be humorous and/or scary at the same time.  Go out now and buy this treasure.",1093392000,3,1529,4.246527777777778
1921811,4,B0000D9PNG,"Well what i thought was a suprise, Leprechaun came back. What a great movie. He was back into the hood again and this time it was mean. Not only did he survive getting shot atleast 50 times but he also survived being burned with a lock on the burning door. He lost but you know he will be back, he just has to. I recommend this movie to anyone that hasn't seen Leprechaun 1-5 yet.",1091923200,3,380,4.08
1921812,4,B0000D9PNG,"At first, this movie would receive 3 stars from me. I really enjoyed this one but I am forced to take away 2 stars because of the fact that the Leprechaun doesn't rhyme! Now, I am adding an additional star after reading the bad reviews of this movie. TRULY IGNORANT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REVIEWING THIS FILM! Those who call this the worst in the series have obviously forgotten Leprechaun 4; if you've seen it you know what I mean. Now, who can really take any of the movies on a serious level? They are all somewhat cheasy and poorly put together. The Leprechaun is just a great character; which is why the series has lasted so long!

 Leprechaun dawns a new costume that looks wicked! You actually get to see what he looks like when his hat falls off and this is the first one to actually show his feet. It is true that Leprchaun gets hit a lot and doesnt use his telekinetic powers so much. WHO CARES!! The telekinesis was cheasy anyways!! Leprechaun is much more menacing in this picture. He has long fingernails and is much stronger than in the previous pictures. Watch him slash and stab his way all through the hood. Warwick Davis' Leprechaun is also very acrobatic in this film full of stunts and action packed fighting. And by the way, PROPS TO WARWICH FOR CONTINUING TO PLAY THIS BELOVED CHARACTER! No way any Leprechaun film could make it if the character is played by anyone else but Warwick.

 The film does focus on the human characters a lot. Hmmm....wonder why? Could it be because the story is about THEIR struggle with the Leprechaun? The Leprechaun is in basically every scene after the basic plot starts up (about the first 20 min. of the film). I will admit that this does have a weak ending, very weak indeed. Oh well, what did you expect? IT'S A LEPRECHAUN MOVIE! The killing scenes are nothing overly cinematic but they do the trick. Still brutal as ever. Keep in mind that this whole movie was filmed in 3 weeks by a first time director. The film also gives a detailed and itriguing history on how the Leprechaun came to be!

 GOOD POINTS:

 Funny scenes: i.e. Leprechaun hitting bong, stumbling around stoned, hitting on woman over cell phone

 New to the series: New wicked costume, stronger and fiercer Leprechaun, Expands on Leprechaun story

 Acting: Good

 Action: Plenty

 BAD POINTS

 No Rhyming: This is unforgivable!

 Ending: Very weak

 Plot: Repeats the ""HOOD"" concept",1090368000,4,2401,4.613207547169812
1921813,2,B0000D9PNG,"Unfortunately, ""Leprechaun: Back 2 Tha Hood,"" also known as ""Leprechaun 6,"" came out after I indulged in a five movie marathon several months ago. Since I still retain more than a few memories of the five previous ""Leprechaun"" movies, I went ahead and watched the latest effort without going back to review the prior entries. There's a nearly ironclad rule about horror franchises, a rule generally acknowledged by fans and non-fans of a particular film series. The rule states that sequels to a hit horror film will invariably decline in quality directly proportional to the rising numbers of the film. Thus, ""Leprechaun 3"" will be a better film than ""Leprechaun 5."" The rule doesn't always hold fast (see ""Hellraiser""), but it's a safe way to decide which films you will spend your hard earned rental dollars on. Personally, I rely on this law to hold true; I enjoy watching awful low budget films, so franchise sequels constitute the bread and butter of my viewing hours. I can always get a chuckle from ""Friday the 13th: Part VIII"" or ""Halloween 6"" instead of flying into a rage over an unpleasant experience-most of the time, anyway. Having said this, ""Leprechaun 6"" isn't the worst film out there. It isn't a particularly good one, either, but compared to parts four and five this one is Shakespearean drama.
In ""Leprechaun 5,"" Warwick Davis once again donned the makeup and costume of the diminutive demon in order to wreak havoc on an up and coming rap group living in the ghetto. This time out, a priest named Jacob sends the leprechaun to Hell-conveniently located under a construction site for a new youth center-before expiring in the effort. A year later a group of young adults-consisting of Lisa, Emily, Jamie, and Rory-discover the leprechaun's box of gold in a chamber underneath the half built youth center. The discovery promises to do a lot of good for Emily, a pretty girl looking forward to attending Kansas State University if only see can get out of the neighborhood. Her friend Lisa also thinks the newfound riches will give her a better life, as well as a new car. Jamie, a chronic imbiber of the wacky weed, takes his share of the loot and throws a bunch of parties. Rory, Emily's ex-boyfriend, uses his earnings to underwrite his growing narcotics empire, much to the chagrin of a rival gang of thugs seeking to end his career. Well, you can't take a leprechaun's gold and expect to live your life in peace. For some reason never explained, the tiny terror reemerges from the underworld to reclaim his gold and take horrible revenge on the four that spent it.
Davis's character dives right in to the bloodletting, roughing up a couple of boys in blue, a customer at the beauty salon where Emily works, and the gang members gunning for Rory. He also destroys the neighborhood seer/ witch who predicted his arrival a few days before Emily discovered the gold. Once again, the people under siege learn that four leaf clovers can hurt the leprechaun, so Rory fills hollow point bullets with ground up clover thus hoping the ammunition will send the demon back to where he came from. Several subplots emerge from time to time, including references to Emily and Rory's rocky relationship, Rory's new girlfriend (the one who loves the idea of a gold tooth), and that whole annoying ""ninja"" running gag that wears out its welcome quite quickly. You even get an earful about Rory's struggles in turning his life around and doing something honest and clean. It's all ends up being a rather ridiculous and pedestrian outing. Even worse, the gore looks cheap and unconvincing. Sure, you see a few impalings, a hair trimmer in the eye gag, and a few other extremely tedious situations that should ""shock"" the audience, but it's too similar to the gore you see in a Herschell Gordon Lewis film. This is supposed to be a horror movie, right?
I had less of a problem with the acting, which wasn't too bad, than I did with the crummy special effects and awkwardly ""humorous"" moments injected for no other reason than to...well, I don't know why the filmmakers decided to insert scenes of the small lad talking trash on a cell phone or yucking it up at one of Jamie's parties. He's certainly worked the crowd for laughs before in other entries in the series, but in those movies he occasionally garnered a chuckle. Not so here. I can't remember one memorable line uttered by the leprechaun in ""Back 2 Tha Hood,"" which is surprising considering Davis's character is a three foot version of the wisecracking Freddie Krueger of ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" fame. I suspect the writers of the script weren't clever enough to come up with unforgettable aphorisms. I'm not even going to delve into the disturbing stereotypes played for humor.
As I watched this film, the only thing I could think of-other than wondering when the film would end-was whether Jennifer Aniston might ever return to do another film as a sort of signature performance like Jamie Lee Curtis did with the ""Halloween"" movies. Don't bet on it. I imagine this series will be long gone by the time Aniston's opportunities in the film industry drop off enough for her to consider returning to her roots. Anyway, the DVD version of ""Leprechaun 6"" contains several extras, including storyboards and trailers for other films in the series. Only watch this one if you simply can't find anything else with which to spend a few hours.",1086998400,6,5399,4.781584582441114

A bunch of terrible actors try to act 'ghetto', and are as convincing as a midget in a Superman costume. I mean c'mon give me a break. They acted out every bad cliche from 'Juice' and 'Boys in da Hood'.
Now the movie itself is great. Ghetto Queen finds the treasure and passes it around to her homies. They buy what you'd expect, cars, jewelry, weaves, gold teeth, and an ample supply of marijuana. Well our little green friend 'don't play dat'. He kills with a bong, rips your fillings out, takes an electric razor to the eye, kills the rival gang, burns in a furnace, is shot with hallow point rounds (filled with four leaf clovers ha ha ha!!!), but best of all he kills two cops and steals their car.

In one part the lep gets hit by a cop and responds ""you punch like a lass!!!"" thats the leprechaun I love and those lines were few and far between. the writers need to let their minds run wild and suspend disbelief to make a good movie. makeup was the only area that was better than in previous movies. if you miss this installment of the leprechaun series you're not missing much...",1074124800,2,766,4.2534246575342465

8000317,5,B0000D9PNG,"Leprechaun 6 is good fun. Great dramatic opening. Davis never gives a bad performance. He is top notch here. The characters here are wel developed and sometimes in conflict with themselves. There is a human element built around the evil surfacing in Davis. I really liked The Preist character.

  The actors all did good I thought. Oscar worthy performances weren't required of them but they were characters you cared about naturally. I think that was the story built around characters. I liked the one girl who was generous when she got the gold giving it to help her friends and not herself. She was a good character.

  I loved the soundtrack to this film. I really saw this film as a sleeper hit. They continue to spend for clothes and other things as we are just waiting for Davis to come back for revenge. There is some good gore and its a funny horror movie as well as scary. It's hard to do funny more than dramatic and Davis and the actors do both.

  I love when The Leprechaun gets the munchies and eats everything. This is one of my favorite Leprechaun movies. Favorite next to 1 and 3 I think.  Warwick Davis made these movies always fun and the actors around him did a good job too. Enjoy this movie for what it is good fun! Cheers!",1493164800,,1246,4.425438596491228
