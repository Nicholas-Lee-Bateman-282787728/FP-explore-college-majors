8391116,4,B00387FR50,Unfortunately nothing can make a presentation of bloodborne pathogens fun but this was not as dry as others i've seen....,1355875200,,121,5.1
8391117,5,B00387FR50,"This video is fun, informative, adaptable, and a great way to make the content of a very important topic stick. I used this video for staff and student training in a medical center of 2500 staff, and consistently had positive feedback. I received comments like: ""It made me remember the important points, and I wasn't bored.""  ""I've seen videos on this topic many times before, but this one was by far the most creative and fun way to get the point across.""  I highly recommend this video for Healthcare staff/student orientation and refresher training.",1349654400,,553,4.872340425531915
8391118,1,B00387FR50,This DVD is silly and dated.  Wish I could have reviewed it before purchase.  The search continues for me.  Would not recommend this for staff training.,1343174400,,152,4.769230769230769
8391119,5,B00387FR50,"Comprehensive, thorough, and fun. The use of humor takes the drab and boring out of the ususal DVD faire and make it entertaining for staff. Can be customized to your facility, or use as is...............thoroughly enjoyable and informative.",1337472000,,241,5.368421052631579
