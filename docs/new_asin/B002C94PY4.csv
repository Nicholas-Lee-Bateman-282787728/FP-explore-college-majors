3905397,5,B002C94PY4,"i'm a huge supporter of les stroud. and if you really love the show too, you're better off buying the three seasons of the show. this is just a compilation of locations that happen to have been in the u.s.",1264723200,31,205,4.15
3905398,5,B002C94PY4,"This is nothing more then all the episodes of Survivorman which were shot in the United States compiled into one DVD for $30 new and $15 used. For this price I would highly suggest just purchasing the actual Season DVD's of the series Survivorman which contain ALL episodes in that season for cheaper than this compilation. I own everything Les has ever done from his first series called Stranded which he did for Discovery Canada, up to his most recent Season 3 of Survivorman. If you are an outdoors person or you are interested in this sort of thing (survival/camping) then Les Stroud is a most for you to watch.",1257033600,70,615,4.6
3905409,5,B002C94PY4,This is a great 4-episode video for any survivalist or Survivorman fan. This will help you get a good idea of what TO DO and what NOT TO DO.,1396915200,,140,3.8620689655172415
3905410,5,B002C94PY4,"A true survivalist to the ^n-th power. He gets dropped of wherever by himself to survive alone while filming for us to see his endeavors. His knowledge of survival is second to none as well, he knows the plants to eat as well as those that are toxic, the same goes for bugs & snakes and small critters for food. Seems to be very good true survivalist. Not just show for TV.",1392940800,,373,4.194444444444445
3905411,1,B002C94PY4,"I own almost every thing this guy has made and it is all good.  However this is just another copy of stuff he made already.  If you own seasons 1,2 ,3 you already have all on this DVD!  Don't buy it.",1389139200,14,199,3.8048780487804876

3905413,5,B002C94PY4,I enjoy watching Survivorman - he's honest about what he's doing and explains things well.  Great tips if you are ever stranded.,1372204800,,128,4.818181818181818

3905415,5,B002C94PY4,"Les is more ;)  I've enjoyed his series tremendously -- he's not some militant survivalist nut job that hides out in bunkers with 15 tons on ammo and canned foods.  Les is a true survivalist, someone that could survive off the land for a long long long time ... in many ways he is one of the few who could achieve and equilibrium with nature.  He uses what he needs to survive ... no SUVs, no Makeup, no spoiled kids with cell phones ... he's just one with nature.  Inspiring!  If only more Americans could watch this show and realize just how much excess/stress they push onto our planet.",1358035200,,589,4.36697247706422
3905416,5,B002C94PY4,"Les Stroud, in his pursuit of comprehensive and realistic survival techniques, has become the best example scouts could have if they're serious about learning true survival skills, and especially the mindset necessary to survive!
I often compare Bear Grylls exploits as examples of how Not to act in real emergencies, especially the eating of gross, even dangerous  foods when food is usually a minor consideration.  Les get's hungry too, but maintains realistic standards about what is edible!  Also he know's what his limits are, physically and mentally, and seems to have learned the lessons he has experienced... He's not a Superman!
I will continue to use the Survivorman videos in training Scouts and SAR personnel in the skills needed to survive ... And conquer the bad situations we often find ourselves in.",1350432000,5,815,5.159090909090909
