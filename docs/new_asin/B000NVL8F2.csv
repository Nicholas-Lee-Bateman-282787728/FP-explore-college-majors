8300643,5,B000NVL8F2,"Mikhail Tank's Hunter and The Calm is a very interesting mix of lighting, sound and visuals. I really enjoyed how he presents a message in a unique and courageous way; allowing the viewer to focus not only on his meaningful words, but also witness how the imagery affects the tone of this rare and insightful video. This is a very nice change from the traditional items I find on Amazon.",1175299200,,387,4.542857142857143
