1799662,5,B0000714HF,"I recently viewed this movie on TV and decided to order it for my own use.  You see the Kern County Witchhunt was not limited to Kern County; it extended into Tulare County also.  I know because my family has been living a nightmare because of false charges of child molestation since 1985.  God instructed me to create a support group for innocent prisoners in 1989 which I did.  I wrote several articles about false accusations in Tulare County for a local Tulare County newspaper and one article for a small newspaper in Bakersfield, California concerning the subject of false charges of child molestation.  My son, daughter, and me was on a local radio station in Kern County two times discussing this subject.  I named a name of local police officer who terrorized little children into lying about their parents.  As a result, it was pay back time for me and after they along with others succeeded in brainwashing my grown daughter into saying I told her not to testify, that God would not like it and that she could be gotten for perjury, I spent over 5 years in prison for witness intimidation for allegingly stating the statements that my daughter claimed I said, but I never even talked to her about testifying at all.  I was totally innocent and am currently on supervise release for another 2 years.  Anyone who does not believe that thousands of parents in Kern,Tulare,Kings,Fresno,Butte,San Bernadino counties were imprisoned on false charges of child molestation is highly wrong because it truly did occur in the Child Abuse War of the 1980's.  This movie is really a representation of the thousands who suffered as a result of this abuse against the family and I am thankful that this excellent movie was made.",1143849600,24,1725,4.777777777777778
1799663,5,B0000714HF,"Acting very realistic.  As the story unfolds you can just see these actions happening in your own life and terminatiog in a jail sentence.  Even though the authorities in this movie really investigated and were concerned for the children's safety, the evidence seemed to pile up against the parents.  Good story line.",1125532800,7,317,5.0576923076923075
1799674,5,B0000714HF,"it is a good movie, and i would recommend this movie to a friend or classmate at school to see at home",1391126400,,102,3.6818181818181817
1799675,5,B0000714HF,"Very few people know what can happen when FALSELY  Accused, especially when WRONGFULLY  Convicted by gross injustice and abuses by those responsible for much wrongdoing and total deception, while abusing and destroying the children coerced, coached, rehearsed, deceived, and forced to testify against parents and others to assist Prosecutors, Judges, and FALSE  Accusers with their personal agendas.  Even fewer know what is involved or why, and rarely does anyone know what to say or do to be able to finance and provide an appropriate legal defense; especially with the totally absurd, unjust legal deadlines and statutes of limitation which assist only those responsible for FALSE  Allegations and wrongdoing, while generally forever destroying INNOCENT  VICTIMS of their abuses and wrongdoing every way possible.

What is taught and ""learned"" growing up is a huge deception when there is literally no such thing as some ""APPEAL"" right being opportunity to make things right.  Rarely does anyone know what ""contempt of court"" actually means or why no individual should have that kind of ""power"" or ability against others.  NO  SINGLE  JUDGE  can possibly be or remain totally UNBIASED, because that's impossible given every individual on Earth is greatly influenced by their own experiences, upbringing, training, teaching/education, personal ideas and beliefs, religious ideas & beliefs & practices, the MEDIA and PUBLIC opinion and pressure, personal agendas and goals, personal benefits of the position the individual wants to maintain and perpetuate no matter what, personal prejudices and feelings, and all the other things that contribute to the way an individual views, treats, and responds to others.

There is NO  JUSTICE possible where TRUTH, RIGHTS, and FREEDOMS are not only denied but ignored and banned from a courtroom, especially when a ""JUDGE"" works with the PROSECUTOR and FALSE  ACCUSERS to forever destroy and WRONGFULLY  Convict  INNOCENT individuals per their own personal ideas, beliefs, and agendas.  When FAMILY and support systems are BANNED from a courtroom to give a totally FALSE  impression to a JURY by the JUDGE working with a PROSECUTOR who should not even be involved when RELATED by marriage to the alleged DEFENDANT and everyone involved; to assist the PROSECUTOR with WRONGFUL  Conviction no matter what; there is NO  JUSTICE and all rights and freedoms are DENIED to anyone FALSELY  ACCUSED, even with ZERO  EVIDENCE to support the LIES and FALSE  Allegations and criminal charges by a FALSE  Accuser guilty of PERJURY, LIES, and malicious personal agendas.

In Ohio NO  PROBABLE  CAUSE (evidence; witnesses) required to immediately deny all rights and freedoms to FALSELY  ACCUSED, Totally INNOCENT individuals; immediately removed and denied all info and contact with a spouse and kids. There's no such thing as being ""innocent until proven guilty,"" because the truth and reality is that even if falsely accused the DEFENDANT is regarded and treated as being GUILTY until WRONGFULLY  CONVICTED no matter what--and that's the GOAL of everyone responsible for these malicious efforts and abuses against INNOCENT people.

Most refuse to think or belief or hear that this can happen, even when this family shares the experience on the Montel Williams show and through this film about what others said and did to them!  The KIDS end up unable to know what was true and what they were TOLD.  The kids are never able to know the truth and grow up thinking and believing LIES and deception against INNOCENT  PARENTS (they are ALIENATED against them), and grow up hating and blaming INNOCENT  parents NOT  GUILTY of wrongdoing and totally destroyed financially and otherwise by ""the legal INJUSTICE  SYSTEM"" and those responsible for it!

Divorce, CUSTODY, and FALSE  Allegations are part of a HUGE  financial industry that benefits only those involved with personal agendas related to their positions of power and authority to terrorize, threaten, humiliate, degrade, destroy, punish, and otherwise demand and control total destruction of others at will (without personal accountability or consequences for wrongdoing!).  That's the bottom line.  They can say or do whatever they please and get away with it.",1378944000,,4243,5.347432024169184

The other website with instant downloads has it with closed captions displayed.  The DVD probably has closed captions.

Based on true case from 1982.  There is very little ""fiction"" in this script.  It is an accurate portrayal of what happens when innocent parents are accused of child abuse.  Children (6 & 9) were coerced by CPS & mostly by an unethical ADA to lie.  ""They yell at us and threaten us until we agree with them.""

Memorable Lines which in particular strike me as true also based on my own personal experience in Los Angeles, circa 2008:

Brandon, ""I don't know what's true anymore.""

Brandon, ""I've been confused for a long time about what went on...what I said...who told me what...I'm still confused.  Now when I think about it, I know only one thing for sure, if those things happened to me...I'd remember.  What I do remember is that one day they walked in and they stole my parents.  The two most powerful people in my world.  That terrified me beyond words.  Now what do we do?""

Spoken at age 19, after being a US Marine for a year.  This is an active example of Tzeddaka.  Tzeddaka is righting the wrongs.

This case happened 26 years before ours.  I was never accused of any crime, sex or otherwise.  I and my son now both accuse County of sex crimes against us.  County has avoided service for over 3 months, costing me so far $328 to pay process servers to chase them around Los Angeles, as they lie to each process server about who is the agent to receive the Summons issued four months ago.  A declaration of due diligence is on file in the federal court.

I did get my child back within four months.  All else happened in Los Angeles (all the same procedural abuses by county), 26 years AFTER these events, and it is still going on today, unless parents stand up and stop the County from persecuting parents.  Brainwashing and coercion are still not only going on right now, it's public policy.  Change it.

If you are a California or Los Angeles parent who has had a child taken for no good reason, please, I beg of you, contact USDC Central in Los Angeles and join my class action now!  Look for me on FaceBook and Change.org!

In my most humblest of opinions, these two parents should be nominated for sainthood for their steadfast faith.  Brendon portrayed by Cody Dorkin (9) and by Scott Baily (15-21) looks, sounds and acts very much like my own son at 13, while undergoing very similar brainwashing and coercion by LAPD and CPS in Los Angeles in 2008.  He has so testified and his declaration is on file in the court right now.  I await Judge Dolly Gee's new ruling in Ovitsky v. State of California.

God only tested Job for seven years, but He tested Dick & Brenda Kniffen for TEN long years.  So far, my personal test has been for about 3.5 years.  But it's not just my test, is it?  Do other customers/viewers know someone falsely accused? Know of a child wrongfully removed? Encourage those individuals now to come forward please, to speak and be heard in public.  To right the wrongs of injustice.

I note that: Habeus Corpus.  Explained in this film as ""Things not handled in the original trial.  New evidence.""  Brainwashing.  Exculpatory evidence ignored.  The new evidence in the Kniffen case was scientific evidence about coercion and brainwashing. Specifically, ""wink"" response was not indicative/proof of sodomy.  Parents sentenced to 240 years in prison each based on ""expert"" testimony that said since boys ""winked"" they must have been sodomized...each boy asked over 340 leading questions, ""terrified,"" not to answer as ADA requested...)  Boys were badgered until they agreed.  ADA trapped boys in rooms for hours tampering with them as witnesses...not allowing any defense examination of the same witnesses by the pediatrician, the teacher, clergy, etc.
Brandon, ""I was terrified not to answer as they wanted...I wanted to go back to my parents, for that I would have said anything, done anything...""

So if I fail now in my current complaint, then I suppose according to this script, Los Angeles prosecution failed to preserve my right to present witnesses was violated as well as cross exam of County ""Investigator"" who failed to show up (just as in Kern/Kniffen) despite court ORDER. Prosecution/county's failure to turn over exculpatory evidence in MY case (Zinn)IS grounds for Habeus Corpus. Thanks for that info....

Film notably quotes Justice Brandeis, ""The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in the insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning, but without understanding.""

Fogarty-Hardwick had same thing happen to her in Orange County within my recent memory.  She was separated from her two children for 6 years.  Her case not published...but you can google it or I can email you a copy, also a real case, and very recent.

""Two little boys, were ripped from their loving home.  Isolated, frightened.  Bounced from foster home to foster home.  While being used to convict and imprison their parents.  Two little boys, all the while believing that when this was over, they would be reunited with their parents and go home.  Were these kids abused? Yes, your honor, they sure were...""

Read what it says on the screen at the end there...the Kniffens did finally sue Kern County for civil rights violations, ""settled for an undisclosed sum...."" When? Some time in the 90s.  But it is still going on now.  I wonder how long the average parent has to wait to get justice?

I rest my case.  Not a film for the average person or the average evening's entertainment, but I give it 5 stars for vindication of innocent parents, and for providing me with yet another role model.  Steadfast, faithful individuals like the Kniffens are preciously hard to come by.

Shalom from Aloha, Oregon

1799679,4,B0000714HF,"I am so appalled by how child ""protection"" agencies subvert the rule of law. It was appalling what these people had to go through. Anyway, I recently wrote a novel, a fictional story, about an Iraq War veteran who fights back against the system using his elite military skills after he's falsely accused of child abuse and his daughters are taken from him. The book, Unforeseen Fury, is available on Amazon.",1326758400,3,407,4.746478873239437
1799680,5,B0000714HF,"This movie is based on the real-life case of Brenda and Scott Kniffen who were arrested and taken from their home and charged with child molestation even though the authorities had no evidence whatsoever to support the charges. The Kniffen's two sons, Brandon and Brian, were removed from the home and placed in protective custody. Over a period of weeks the boys were constantly badgered and coerced into giving false testimony in the belief that they would be allowed to go home to their parents if they said the ""right"" things. The Kern County authorities committed outrageous abuses of power against innocent citizens and sent them to prison for crimes they didn't commit. This era was known by some as the ""child sex wars"" of the 1980s. Some called it ""witch hunts."" I lived in California for 20 years, including the decade of the 1980s, so I am more than a little familiar with all that went on. Sadly, as we can see in this movie, the only abuse these children received was from the very system that was meant to protect them. And the scary thing is that something like this could have happened to anybody. You didn't have to be guilty of a crime to be sent to prison. If the District Attorney's office wanted you in prison, then you would go to prison. And they would abuse your children while you were locked away. And it was pointed out at the end of this film that many victims of these ""witch hunts"" are still in prison because they have no way to prove their innocence. Please note that this movie was made in 2001. We usually associate these kinds of things with more primative, third-world countries, or with countries ruled by tyrannical dictators. We don't want to believe that things like this can happen in the United States of America. But sadly, my friends, these things do happen here. Dozens of people in this country have been executed for crimes they did not commit, and then were later found to be innocent. How do you bring someone back to life when you discover that they were unjustly put to death. If this film makes you think about our justice system and see it as an imperfect entity, then something good has come from the suffering of those who were abused by the system. You might ask if we can ever have a perfect justice system. Unfortunately, the answer is ""no."" But we can strive to make our system the best it can be. And movies like this one can help us to understand where we are going wrong. We can learn from our mistakes. Please watch this movie. It is a difficult movie to watch. You will be sad and angry and outraged and bewildered by all you see. But watch it anyway because it is worth the effort in order to gain insight into how to make our society a better place. I know this is a rather long review, but I hope it has been a help to some of you out there. And I hope this movie will open your mind as much as it did mine. Let us hope that we will learn from our history so that we will not be doomed to repeat it.",1321142400,6,2966,4.365280289330922

1799682,5,B0000714HF,"I remember the time in the 1980s when so many day care centers and parents were being accused of child sexual abuse.  This family suffered greatly, but they were not alone.  The McMartin trial comes to mind.  It was, indeed, exactly like the witch hunts in Salem Massachusetts.  The saddest part is that children are very suggestable.  Well-intentioned but misguided psychiatrists planted thoughts in many children's minds of abuse that never happened. As with the oldest son in this family, confusion reigned in their minds as to whether or not it actually happened.  Families were torn apart and lives destroyed or permanently damaged.  Time is one thing no one can get back once it has passed.  These children were torn from their parents with NO proof of any wrong doing.  The accusations of a mentally deranged grandmother were outrageous, but the Kern County police just raced forward like a bunch of drunken zealots.  The head prosecutor even said this case could be ""career making"".  Well, it wasn't as he was forced to resign.

This movie is excellently acted and not only portrays the horrible side of such an incident, but the fact that the parents could still hang onto hope and their faith, even in the most preposterous and trying of situations.

An egregious wrong was done this family, but it has been righted as best as it can be. What I cannot believe, however, is that the McCuen's children remained with their deranged grandmother who started it all.

7973865,5,B0000714HF,"THIS is a very important film.  Those people who naively say the U.S. has the best criminal justice system in the world just don't know what they're talking about.  I've seen this film twice, read about what happened and in my opinion, this family was almost destroyed by a very very incompetent and corrupt criminal justice system in Bakersfield, Ca.  But the hysteria of the 80's fueled by Fox media with it's drama-driven focus, unscrupulous politicians and overly zealous prosecutors did some very serious damage to innocent people's lives and especially the children they were purporting to be ""protecting"".  This film is not easy to watch and I'm sure the fanatics who helped fuel the fire won't believe it ...unfortunately, I know its' truth too well.  My own mentally ill son was falsely accused in Baltimore.  My son never had more than a traffic ticket on his record when this child from a family of criminals, drug addicts and prostitutes lied about him in the worst way imaginable.  She grew up and told the truth.  The lie was much more popular.  The girl actually gave a very strong deposition but the Baltimore States Attorney was not interested.  My son LOOKED like the stereotype..he did not take care of himself and his appearance was partly why this happened.  The child, who LOOKED so innocent was not..she was more street-wise than my son ever was or could be.  But in these kind of cases, appearances matter a great deal.  Too many people react automatically to them.  And we had no idea WHY this child would lie about such a thing.  We found out later her grandmother (the one who used to burn her with cigarettes) and another woman suggested it...based on my son's appearance, nothing more...and gave the child the idea of how to get him away from her older sister. (.the child was very attached to the older sister) ..we don't know how many false accusations happened during this terrible period in the U.S. but this movie suggests there are men in prison from that period and I write to one in Oklahoma (private prison).  I am certain he also is innocent..his story is another outrage.  Very few people care about this issue.  Protecting children is very important but there's another side to the story too.. If we get the wrong people, if in the name of protecting children, we trample on people's rights who are not dangerous, esp. not to children, we need to rethink the laws.
