2692244,5,B000KJTG0G,This was a very good movie.  It gave us a chance to see behind the scenes of policy making in World War II even if there was a little dramatic license taken.  I recommend this movie highly to anyone interested in this time period in history,1174348800,19,240,4.195652173913044
2692245,5,B000KJTG0G,"Remarkable, seen from an entirely different aspect of most war movies",1174089600,5,69,5.363636363636363
2692256,5,B000KJTG0G,"""World War II: When Lions Roared"" aired on NBC when I was in high school and just beginning to really embrace history and World War II in particular, (I am now a professional historian; my thesis was on Hitler and Stalin as military commanders).  As a teenager this film really captured my imagination and helped me appreciate how the war was fought at the highest levels of Allied power.  There are only five speaking parts in this series FDR (John Lithgow), Winston Churchill (Bob Hoskins), Joseph Stalin (Michael Caine), Harry Hopkins (Ed Begley, Jr.), and Vyacheslav Molotov (Jan Triska).  Every performance is spot on.

The series moves through the great events of World War II, with the actors often speaking to each other through their letters in a surreal, detached manner reminiscent of a stage play.  I do have some problems with the characterizations of some of the historical figures at times, such as when upon learning the news of Pearl Harbor FDR looked shocked and declared ""I tried to keep us out of war.""  I'm convinced that Roosevelt knew the USA would get into the war sooner or later, and he wanted it to be sooner.  A few other little things here and there don't really ring true, though on the whole the series gives a good overview of what these leaders experienced during the cauldron of the World's greatest war.",1390694400,2,1338,4.741379310344827
2692257,5,B000KJTG0G,"This is one of the most unique WWII documentaries I have ever seen. Not just narration over news footage but truly a an engaging approach. While historically accurate, it bring the main characters to life with superb acting and seamless editing of actual and created  scenes.  It tells the story of what went on behind the headlines of the war and gives depth to the men who changed our world forever. Even if you are not a fan of war movies, you will love this one. If you are a history  buff, this is a must see.",1389916800,,514,4.278350515463917
2692258,5,B000KJTG0G,"The acting is superb, and the casting is brilliant.  Watching this teleplay--a quiet film that ignores all the bells and whistles of the Hollywood blockbuster--is like being a fly on the wall during a pivotal time in our world's history.

This play relies on the words spoken and/or written by the three powerhouse leaders--Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt.  Because of this, the tension in the film is organic and never contrived.

When Lions Roared is refreshing, especially in the age of disposable 'entertainment'.",1375401600,,518,5.280487804878049
2692259,2,B000KJTG0G,"The issues discussed were superficial, lacking better documentation and struggles as to who roared loudest. What was Franklins idea as to Churchill's interest to re-establish England as a power after the war?",1369180800,,208,5.53125
2692260,3,B000KJTG0G,It was far too simplistic and left out important factors. I did not like the split screen of characters talking to one another,1366502400,,126,4.521739130434782
2692261,4,B000KJTG0G,"The history is fundamentally accurate.  The humanization of Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill provides a good, though shallow, psychological perspective on their decision making.  Stalin's portrait, one begging for aid and grimly hanging on with the allies to defeat Hitler, is too sympathetic.  It's difficult to achieve any empathy with an individual who starved or killed so many of his own people to achieve power before the war actually began.",1364083200,,447,5.449275362318841
2692262,5,B000KJTG0G,It was an excellent film especially for people who wants to know about went on during the time that FDR for president.,1353715200,,118,4.409090909090909
2692263,5,B000KJTG0G,"THIS WAS JUST OUTSTANDING, AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR ANY HISTORY BUFF.  ACTING WAS TREMENDOUS, AND WAS THAT REALLY MICHAEL CAINE?",1344384000,2,133,5.045454545454546
2692264,3,B000KJTG0G,"I had seen the movie before I believe on some streaming service however I wasn't able to find it, and was in the mood for it. When I saw the price I was somewhat hesitant, however I decided to go for it. For the year it was made in, watching it again it was an obvious low budget film. They constantly have split screens with FDR, Churchill, and Stalin talking to each other as if they're in the same room with no obvious forms of communication and the room, and the split screen is even good it's a blurred line down the middle. Sometimes it won't even be a split screen it will be the character inside a blurred emphasized bubble. The overall acting was quite good but the special effects were just plain annoying not horrible, annoying. The costumes, design, and acting was great, the special effects were what was lacking.",1341446400,,826,4.440789473684211
2692265,5,B000KJTG0G,"I highly recommend this movie.  If you like movies about world war 2, you will not be disappointed. I don't know if it was totally factual, but I thought it was very interesting & entertaining.",1320624000,2,193,4.514285714285714
2692266,4,B000KJTG0G,"It does NOT portray Stalin as a GOOD GUY. But it in no way portrays him as the truly evil man he was. This series has a lot going for it never the less. It is definitely worth watching and does bring out a lot of WWII history not common in the popular telling of WWII history, the usual fare fed to American and British audiences.

  If the Russians had failed to defeat NAZI GERMANY when they did, what would have happened ? America and Britain did shy away from fighting the German`s until they were fairly certain they could successfully land a large force in France. Only because of more than 3 years of sustained Soviet effort and a monumental loss of Russian lives. About 12 million Russian military killed and about 12 million civilian deaths also.

  I think it is fair to say that the Western Allies belated efforts resulted in the sacrafice of Poland to the Soviets along with many others.
  Stalin was in so many ways every bit as evil as Nazi Germany`s Hitler.
  We made deals with the devil [ Stalin ], so to speak, to bring about the defeat of Nazi Germany. Had the Nazi`s defeated Russia, what would have happened ? All of Russia`s resources would have been at the command of the Nazis.
  A very difficult and brutal situation for everyone concerned: THE ENTIRE WORLD.
  Some of this history is distorted and whitewashed in this series, but a lot of the history of WWII is brought out with this series also.
  I just viewed this series again and upgraded my rating because of that. This series does bring out the extremely difficult position Churchill and Roosevelt were in as to fighting the Nazis. Churchill did the best he could under the circumstances to try and minimize the takeover by the Soviets of Poland, the Balkans, and others. He did save the Greeks from Soviet takeover and that is about all that could be done and of course the Greeks had a lot to do with that fact. They had pushed the Italians out of their Country in 1941. No small feat and slowed the Germans down that crucial year by diverting, and holding up the German invasion of Russia. And Roosevelt did also. He was dying after all and was not at his best to say the least. I can`t help but feel that the torment Roosevelt endured surrounding all this brought an early end to his life. [ 63 years old ]. A very grim situation for all concerned.
  It is a compelling, informative series well worth watching.  ...Oscar",1308614400,5,2407,4.454337899543379
2692267,5,B000KJTG0G,"A riveting historical drama for WWII enthusiasts -- the most comprehensive story I have ever seen on this subject.  If you only have a passing interest in this part of our history it may not be for you.  If however, you have more than a passing interest you will find it very entertaining and a must see.",1291680000,2,304,4.315789473684211
2692268,1,B000KJTG0G,This is not a movie by no means. It is like a play with original clips from WWII. I was expecting this great drama. Instead I got this below standard skit.,1248134400,,155,4.032258064516129
2692269,3,B000KJTG0G,"I like this movie, but was surprised to find out it was a video production not tape.

A little short on detail it still entertained me.",1239580800,,135,4.1923076923076925
2692270,5,B000KJTG0G,An excellent reflection of just how sensetive and fragile political allies of different countris can be.  It also depicts what the world could over come if we truly learned how to all work together as a world for good instead of evil.,1239321600,3,234,4.571428571428571
2692271,3,B000KJTG0G,"From a historial point of view this DVD is interesting.  From an artistic video point of view it is disppointing.  There is too much confusion with the dual portrayal of World Leaders.  It takes time to understand what is going on. This story is pure history and would be useful for students, history teachers and writers.  Michal Caine was excellet playing the part of Stalin.",1224288000,,377,4.753846153846154
2692272,3,B000KJTG0G,"This mini-series was very enjoyable. Not really traditional Hollywood style though. Several of the shot compositions were a bit cheesy. Also, the main characters did a strange soap-operaesque pause while another character (in another location) was talking. The splicing didn't make sense to me.

The acting was fine and Michael Caine's accent was believable. I think he humanized the Stalin character enormously.

One character that I did miss was Truman. The movie basically stops with the death of FDR. While I understand that Truman was ""out-of-the-loop"" while VP, he was nevertheless a wartime president.

Overall, I would recommend this movie. Although, I would only purchase it on sale or rent it.",1214524800,4,703,5.315315315315315
2692273,4,B000KJTG0G,"It is perhaps the nature of the medium that on the internet we continually get reviews which complain that the product would be much better if only it were something completely different than it was intended to be. It is somehow more disappointing in an Amazon-sanctioned review which one hopes is based upon some sense of the purpose of the thing.

In this case, it ought to be understood that the whole raison d'etre of the film is to use only the actual words of the historical figures portrayed as dialogue for the film. Therefore, the ""oddly cobbled-together"" script to which the Amazon reviewer refers is not cobbled-together at all, but rather an adaptation of written correspondence into monologue or dialogue. It is a brilliant device and admirably executed. The ""strange"" split-screen scenes of which the reviewer complains are some of the cleverest in the film, turning correspondence that would have taken weeks of transport to travel back and forth in wartime into contemporaneous conversation.

All this with actual footage of the war, the results of the decisions of these men, played out behind them. It is unusual, perhaps, for television, but it is eminently theatrical and hardly ""chummy"" or ""glib."" The overall effect of the film is not the sort of jingoism implied by the Amazon reviewer, but a sense of the true complexity and difficulty of the dilemmas these men faced--and the different means each of them utilized in handling them. FDR, for example, hardly comes off well in his acquiescence to Stalin without consultation of Churchill.

Caine is good. Lithgow is not very good. Hoskins is pitch-perfect! The film is highly recommended for its originality, its historicity, and its thoughtful approach to a difficult subject.",1209427200,24,1750,5.069444444444445
2692274,5,B000KJTG0G,"This is by far the best docudrama I have ever seen.  Once in a lifetime certain actors were born to play certain roles, and this is one of those times.  John Lithgow, Bob Hoskins and Michael Caine were absolutely perfect and truly brought these historical characters to life.  I have seen many great actors portray FDR, yet when I saw this portrayal I actually thought I was seeing FDR.  Hoskins portrayal of Churchill was equally brilliant and believable. There are no words to adequately describe the performance of Michael Caine, except that this film shows that he definitely is among the greats.  In short, this film brings history to life in a way that is informative as well as entertaining.",1184630400,4,698,4.783333333333333
2692275,5,B000KJTG0G,"It is good to see this 1994 television miniseries finally come out on DVD.  Be prepared for a long evening (the running time for the two discs is three hours 23 minutes) but it is time well invested.  WORLD WAR II: WHEN LIONS ROARED is a creative montage of actual film clips from the newsreels shown in theaters at that time together with contemporary filmed drama in script written by David W. Rintels and crafted and directed by Joseph Sargent.  This film allows us to revisit history the way it was - with more behind the scenes activity among the great powers than most other films offer.

The roaring lions are very well portrayed by John Lithgow as Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Bob Hoskins as Winston Churchill and Michael Caine as Stalin. Each actor steps wholly into his role without resorting to mimicry or simply stage makeup.  It is fascinating to see how the USA was a non-intervener at first (a refreshingly different stance form the current aggressor role we have adopted) and how the needs of the planet required global cooperation in the face of Hitler et al.  Ed Begley Jr. offers a lot of information about the important figure Harry Hopkins about whom we hear little as does Jan Triska as Vyacheslav Molotav, Stalin's key man.

The compilation of real footage with created footage including the split screen technique to allow the three leaders to interact from their different locations works well.  This is one of those historic films that deserves repeated viewing.  An excellent production.  Grady Harp, March 07",1174348800,9,1534,4.842911877394636
