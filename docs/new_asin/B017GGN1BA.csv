8739110,5,B017GGN1BA,"Fabulous, I don't like two of the songs (People Puppy because of the insinuation and Brush because of the insinuating behavior that my three year old doesn't need to learn) but my son loves the upbeat, engaging and fabulous songs. They have taught him many words/ concepts as he very much likes singing along. Thank you.",1509580800,,320,4.732142857142857
8739111,5,B017GGN1BA,I am very happy with this video I purchased for my non-verbal autistic son.  It holds his attentions with its catchy songs and graphics.  It was fast shipping.  The SLP that created the video wrote me a letter personally thanking me for purchasing.  My two year old daughter watches it with my son and loves it too.  I have told other parents about this video.  Highly recommend!,1497484800,,379,4.582089552238806
8739112,5,B017GGN1BA,"I absolutely love these songs and videos and use them all the time.  I have used them with toddlers, preschoolers and school aged SDC and regular articulation/language kids.  I suggest parents use them as well.  They have the words on the screen and the songs are slow enough for children to actually process and learn the words.  The children love them.  They especially love the ""Bubbles,"" ""Slide"" and ""go"" songs although many others are just as popular!  Can't say enough about how useful these are!",1490400000,,502,4.847058823529411
8739113,5,B017GGN1BA,"Animation Station 1 and 2 was my first purchase from this author and now I follow all her products, as they all rock! She is amazing at creating tools I need for use in the classroom as a speech-language pathologist. I highly recommend the Animation Station 1 & 2 audio-visual shows for young children. The songs are simple and catchy and emphasize countless speech and language goals. The visuals contain actual objects and people and also incorporate the printed word to facilitate early literacy. The DVD offers excellent speech and language practice for any child, whether for parents at home, a teacher or SLP in a classroom, or for individual speech therapy sessions. These shows are great for kids of all ages, whether they are typically developing or demonstrating difficulty. Youll love the attention to detail and quality of this product.",1490313600,,848,5.0212765957446805
8739114,5,B017GGN1BA,"Animation Station is essential to my therapy.  I typically inclue 2-3 songs when working with Early Intervention clients.  It is fun and easy to incorporate hand movements, sign or manipulatives.  Children with ASD and CAS can also benefit through the video modeling component.  Parents related their child sings  Animation Station all week long! I only wish ALL of Miss Rachael's songs had video accompaniment.

8739115,5,B017GGN1BA,Wonderful as are all of Rachel's creations.,1477353600,,43,5.285714285714286
8739116,5,B017GGN1BA,"The simple tunes paired with the real photos is the perfect combination to get language practice into the brain.  I've used these with children ages 2-8 with language delays  and it's been the easiest, most effective tool I've ever used.  The kids love them.  Speech and language ""therapy"" is now automatic.  You can tell the songs were developed by a speech pathologist, as the songs address specific language and articulation goals.  Well worth the money.",1476662400,,457,5.026666666666666
8739117,5,B017GGN1BA,"My young non-English speaking students enjoyed these shows so much!  Even the custodians at the school walked by humming the tunes!  The shows are versatile, interesting and fun.  The high school ELL learners watched the shows and enjoyed them!  I would highly
recommend them!  These would be an excellent addition to any teacher's toolbox!  Jan Strootman",1475798400,,355,5.25
