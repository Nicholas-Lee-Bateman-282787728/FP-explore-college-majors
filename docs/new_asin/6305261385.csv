7887261,3,6305261385,"ZU: WARRIORS OF THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN (XIN SHUSHAN JIANXIA, featuring Bridgette Lin) is a film dating back to the 1980's and is NOT to be mixed up with the much more recent LEGEND OF ZU (SHUSHAN ZHUAN, in which Zhang Ziyi appears), which appeared a couple years back, even though both are directed by Tsui Hark and both are supposed to be (I want to emphasize: SUPPOSED to be) based on a long fantasy novel entitled SHUSHAN JIANXIA (SWORDFIGHTERS OF MT SHU) by Chinese author Huanzhu Louzhu (also named Li Shoumin; 1902 ~ 1961). Many of the reviewers here seem to get mixed up between the two movies. The present review shall be on the earlier one. By the way, the novel's not yet translated into English, sorry -- even though I'm perfectly confident it's more than a match for Tolkien's trilogy in terms of content. :p (Certainly the novel has exerted a tremendous influence on later Chinese swordplay fiction, such as the work of Jin Yong or Louis Cha.)

NEITHER movie is true to the original novel (which in my estimate would require at least five long films, serious). The films aren't even condensed versions of the novel. With both movies Tsui Hark has committed the unpardonable sin of whipping together a story with elements and characters selected almost at random from the novel, possibly even adding his own stuff, and naming the resultant hodge-podge after the novel itself. To give a couple examples of how Tsui Hark's movie departs from the novel, in the novel becoming a blood monster is a strictly voluntary matter; you must go through special training :p and can't become one merely by being 'infected' by a blood monster, as happens in the movie. (I don't remember the blood monster forming a coccoon of skulls around itself in the original novel, either.) Also, in the original story the green and violet twin swords were lost treasures discovered by accident by two GIRLS, NOT guarded by a female immortal who then handed them to two BOYS, as in the (earlier) film. And that's just two examples, mate.

So does that automatically make ZU: WARRIORS OF THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN a bad film? Yes and no. Yes, because it's nothing short of sacrilege to mar a work of literature in this way. No, because the film actually does have a lot of cool and spectacular effects, such as fighting with swords of  lightning ;) and the visually impressive and lovely interior of the palace/fort of the 'Ice Queen' (though I doubt these appear in the novel at all), and the film's own plot is not too bad, either (I personally would have much preferred that the 'Ice Queen' could eventually cure the hero who turned into a blood monster, though). Tsui Hark has a very annoying knack, however, for rushing the story so much that all you have to do is blink and you'll miss out on a huge chunk of what's going on. Can't you have at least a few slower and calmer moments, for Heaven's sake? (This gets even worse in LEGEND OF ZU, so much so the plot is in danger of being utterly lost to the viewer.) Also, sometimes the acting just doesn't feel emotionally appropriate. When you learn that your beloved martial arts teacher is in danger of turning into a blood monster and no one can do anything to help, what would you feel? How would you act? The one playing the role of the teacher's disciple in the film acted like a stupid idiot at the point of learning that hard truth. Really. Tsui Hark really should have known better, for goodness' sake. Also, would you not feel at least some sorrow when learning of your teacher's death, even though he has turned into an evil creature? In the film, the idiot apparently didn't. Yeah, he died, now let's move on. Sure, right.

My overall assessment: superb graphics, passable plot, atrocious handling of human emotions. And that's not taking into consideration the violence done to the original novel.",1164240000,2,3836,4.653392330383481
7887262,2,6305261385,"Despite this movie being about 1. magic, 2. kung fu, 3. general weirdness and cheap funny props, 4. lots of flying in colorful outfits, 5. a spattering of cutie Chinese girls who also know magic- all of which attributes people who love kung fu think should/MUST be a really great combo- it was actually so boring to me (a diehard kung fu fan) and hard to follow that i didnt' want to watch anymore of it half way thru.

It looked like a high-budget Chinese kung fu fantasy film from the 70's.  Oh wait, it was.

There was NOT a lot of fighting/kung fu, but there was a lot of flying around in funny colorful costumes and strange,convoluted dialogue.

I got the impression they filmmakers were trying for something really epic, an -alien- Chinese mythology that didn't quite have the neatly-packaged-story nature of familiar, Western mythologies.  In short, it make no sense and didtn' try to explain itself (nor should it)!  It was a good try tho and if I were Chinese and kind of weird and living in the 70s i'd think the movie is like Chinese star wars.

One more thing:

They used saran wrap enshrouded with packing tape to depict large broken blocks of ice.  I mention this to attest to the early Tsui Hark's innovative set design and creative props.  It was a neat although distracting way to cut costs.  Also worthy of mention in this regard is the fake, incongruent, drawn cartoon lightning interleaved with fancy acrobatics and disjointed dialogue.",1152057600,,1460,4.66015625
7887263,5,6305261385,"Does it have a disjointed plot?  Yep.  Poor continuity?  You bet.  Incomprehensible ending?  Sure.  Cheesy effects?  Yes again, by modern standards, anyway.  Is it a massively cool film?  Hell, yes!
Do not watch this movie expecting deeply moving themes, great acting, high art, or really just about anything you'd normally watch a movie for.  If you do, you'll be disappointed.  This is not a normal movie.  Watching Zu is really more of a life Experience.  Think of yourself as Winne-the-Pooh Watching Surreal Fantasy Images.
This film achieves a level of fantastic strangeness rarely equaled in live-action cinema.  Where else will you see a man imprisoning an evil demon using his eyebrows, or a man chained to rocks being sucked into the mouth of hell?  No, none of it makes much sense, but just go with it, and you won't regret it.",1005868800,11,837,4.836879432624113
7887264,2,6305261385,"Seminal in 1983 for its amalgamation of special effects, wire-work, and kung-fu, now ""Zu"" looks like an antique whose wrinkles are glaringly obvious next to today's wire-fu/fantasy films (""Crouching Tiger,"" ""Storm Riders"").  Hark, like his contemporary Western counterpart Spielberg, ranges from the sublime to the subterranean, and ""Zu"" falls just short of his worst attempts (i.e. ""The Master,"" ""Once Upon in China 3"").  However, Hark's visual palette with vast array of vibrant colors create a few striking tableaus that make ""Zu"" moderately interesting.  But in the end, the lack of kung-fu and an engaging story leads to a big superfluous mound of color and chaos, which will only please the most diehard Hark or Hong Kong fan.  BTW: Check out Hark's finest, ""Peking Opera Blues,"" ""The Blade,"" and ""Time and Tide,"" for the best cinema has to offer from the last fifteen years.",997747200,2,881,5.13986013986014
7887265,2,6305261385,"As much as I like Tsui Hark, I can only recommend this movie to his die hard fans and anyone who wants to complete their  Fantasy movies collection.  This movie relies too much on special effects and not enough of anything else.  Regardless, it's fun to watch once in a while as a novelty.",982886400,,289,4.314814814814815
7887266,5,6305261385,"Tsui Hark directed this groundbreaking special effects extravaganza (1983) which is a favorite among fans of Hong Kong's fantay genre. Features an all-star cast with names such as Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung, Meng Hoi, Brigitte Lin, Moon Lee, and Adam Cheng being the most memorable of the bunch. Although the special effects might seem amateurish by today's standards, they are still impressive considering the budget, and the sheer imagination that the film possesses makes it an exhilirating thrillride until the end.
Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain is a frenetic epic about the struggle between good and evil. Zu's roots are firmly grounded in Chinese mythology with all the cast doing very well playing ""large"" characters. The special effects people from Star Wars were imported to HK by Tsui Hark himself to oversee the effects for Zu. While not as polished or flashy as today's CGI the abundant visual effects from Zu are a work of art, pushing the envelope of the technology of the early 80's by using wires and animation. Zu requires more than one viewing to take it all in. A must for any Hong Kong Cinema enthusiast. And, forget the plot, just enjoy the action.",981936000,4,1171,4.889447236180905
7887267,4,6305261385,"Tsui Hark, who went to film school at the University of Texas, is one of the most influencial filmmakers of Hong Kong. In this film, he made an effort to attract Hollywood special effects artists to come to Hong Kong  and not only create a visually impressive film, but also to teach his team  how the effects are done. This film was the result of that effort, and it  shows. By the way, the previous mention of computer effects is incorrect.  Not only does this film pre-date extensive use of computer-generated  effects, but the suggestion that Lightwave is made by SGI instead of Newtek  is also incorrect. Zu is a fantasy film, and the influence it (and other  Tsui Hark films, like A Chinese Ghost Story) has had on other filmmakers is  highly evident.",925171200,13,757,4.597014925373134
7887268,5,6305261385,"This is a very important HK film; its the first to impliment computer effects (SGI's LightWave Im told) for one thing, and yet the movie does not rely on them to any degree.. the battle scenes are as epic on occasion as  the plot itself; an excursion into heroes, war, the world of martial arts,  and even love.
Its simply one of the finest period piece, fantasy/martial  arts movies ever made, and is frequently cited as an influence even  today.
In a world being torn apart by fueding among the schools that  compose the loosely defined (but ever present in the genre) 'World of  Martial Arts', a young man seeks the aid of a great and mysterious master,  to end the fueding and ultimately to save the world.",924393600,5,710,4.5
