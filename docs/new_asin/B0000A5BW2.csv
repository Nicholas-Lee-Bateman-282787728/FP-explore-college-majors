7996030,5,B0000A5BW2,"I read the other reviews on this dvd and completely disagree with what everyone said. I thought a lot of very important information and advice was presented.  Yes it may of been a bit on the dry side and did not have all of the Hollywood glamor.  It just presented the facts in a logical manner.  As a brand new owner of a shotgun, I feel much better about the tactical side of using my shotgun.  Highly recommend this dvd.",1371340800,,423,4.25
7996031,3,B0000A5BW2,"This video is about using the shotgun for self-defense and is basically the Gunsite Training Center's method for use of the shotgun.  This video is in fact the video is filmed at Gunsite using Gunsite instructors.  My feelings on this video are mixed.  First the basic information regarding use of the shotgun (loading, unloading, handling of the gun, etc.) is very good, reliable technique you should practice over and over.  The section where the gunsmith at Gunsite talks about modifications to your shotgun is bad however, much of this advice is ill-informed and seems to be aimed at selling certain products and services.  The advice about extended magazine tubes & screw-in choke systems is where this gunsmith is off track, talks with different gunsmiths confirm that this advice is wrong.  All in all this video is ok and there is plenty of good technique and advice to be had if you know how to filter it out and apply it for your own use.",1355097600,,948,4.75
7996032,2,B0000A5BW2,"This has to be one of the most boring videos I've ever seen.  Granted, it isn't supposed to be an Academy Award winner, but they could have done MUCH better.

I agree with the reviewer who said it was strangely organized.  I also must add that at least some of the footage dates back to the 70's based on the appearance of the ""talent.""

If you're going to: 1) operate a ""nationally known"" tactical school, and 2) produce a DVD that is supposed to represent it, SPEND A FEW BUCKS and do something other than dub some old VHS tape to DVD and jack people $40 +/- for it.

This was one of the most disappointing purchases I ever made from Amazon, and a LAME effort on the part of the producers.  I actually fell asleep while watching it.  Look for another instructional shotgun DVD.",1268611200,,779,4.3310344827586205
7996033,1,B0000A5BW2,"I was having a problem loading this dvd for a second view, but now that seems to have gone away.
So now my rating goes from 1 to 5 stars.  I can't get the stars to change, sorry so I guess it says 1 star but is really is 5 stars.

Really informative, at a good pace.  Would buy it again.",1235260800,,287,3.6721311475409837
7996034,4,B0000A5BW2,"The video and audio quality is good.

Video presentations and demonstrations are done by members of Gun Site Training Center.  The presentations and demonstrations are good.  But, I think that the topics presented and demonstrated are a little out of sequence.  I think that this takes away from the coherence of the video's general subject.  I think that if you consider the sequence of the general outline of the topics as they are presented in the video you might see for your self  how just a change in the sequence of the topics presented and demonstrated would have made the video more coherent.

The first video topic has a gun smith showing features added to a shotgun to make it a tactical shotgun.

The next speaker talks briefly about 4 safety rules or principle and demonstrates how to unload a pump action shotgun.

Next, there is a display of shotgun ammo spread patterns of various types of shotgun shells.

The next speaker outlines several reasons to choose to use a shotgun for self-defense or combat.  I thought this should be closer to the beginning of the video tape.

Another instructor demonstrates various means of holding and carrying the shotgun and some firing positions from behind cover.

This is followed by a short demonstration of some house clearing techniques.

House clearing techniques is followed by a short presentation on shotgun ammo load effective ranges of distance.  I thought that it would have been better presented along with the presentations of shotgun shell spread patterns.

The last presentation is about various shotgun sights on top of the barrel.  I thought that this should have been presented before or after the gun smith's presentation of features added to a tactical shotgun.

All demonstrations and presentations are good.  I just think that they could have put it into a better sequence to make the video more coherent as a instructional DVD.

There are 2 good, short video extras:  one shows Shotgun Champion, John Shaw demonstrating how moving smoothly and efficiently with the shotgun results in shooting faster than trying to rush to shoot.
John Shaw shows that his operation of a pump action Remington 870 is only 1/500 of a second slower than when he operates a Bennelli Semi-automatic shotgun.

In the next video extra, John Shaw demonstrates the use of the MP-5 assault rifle.
You can find John Shaw in another video DVD called ""John Shaw Combat Shotgun Seminar.""
