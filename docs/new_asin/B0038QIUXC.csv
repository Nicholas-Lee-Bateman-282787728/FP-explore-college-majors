8391666,5,B0038QIUXC,"I have the honor of being able to attend Ruben's yoga class and was delighted to learn he created a DVD for beginners.  I can honestly say this is for beginners like me who have never done any type of yoga before and for those who need a refresher course.

The DVD is broken down into different segments so you can do as much as you like or as little as you like.  Ruben's voice is very soothing which makes it very easy to forget your troubles, what you forgot to do at the office or where you have to be later in the day.  I actually look forward to the class as well as doing the DVD in the privacy of my home.

As others have said Ruben is very descriptive in how to perform each move and if you just let your mind go blank and listen to his voice you'll have no trouble following what he's telling you.  Although I have to admit I do peek once in a while at the TV screen just to make sure I'm doing it correctly but it's definitely not necessary.

I can't recommend this DVD highly enough and I know you won't be sorry for making the purchase.  I actually look forward to doing yoga something I never thought I'd say, but you come away feeling so peaceful, relaxed and energized you'll be looking forward to your yoga time just like me.

Thank you Ruben for creating a yoga DVD truly for beginners.",1392595200,3,1304,4.122529644268774
8391667,5,B0038QIUXC,"This DVD is very well-sequenced. Ruben is very descriptive in the poses, breathwork and transitions between each position. It has been created in  a way that the user can select a sequence based on their energy level, desired outcome and time they have available.

I would highly recommend this for beginners and experienced yogis alike, because it is so calming (or energizing, depending on which program you select) and it brings me peace and bliss every time I practice with it which is every day. :)",1390262400,,503,4.837209302325581
8391668,5,B0038QIUXC,"I love this video !Ruben Vasquez is a wonderful instructor. He conveys attention to every movement in a kind, relaxed and organized manner with a very clear and calming voice. You can follow the movements and positions as he alerts you about what is next. I enjoy this video and I find it very helpful to my well-being.",1382227200,,319,4.517241379310345
8391669,5,B0038QIUXC,"This is a perfect yoga DVD for home practice.  One can choose from short 15 min sessions to longer ones. Breathing exercises and brief meditations are very relaxing. I would often listen to Ruben's calming voice in my office before starting my work day. When I was going through a chemotherapy two years ago and did not often feel like going to a gym, this yoga DVD was a godsend. I have used it both ways, either by myself or with friends. My friends like it, too.",1381881600,2,465,4.344827586206897
8391670,5,B0038QIUXC,"I've purchased many yoga DVDs over the years and was so happy when I found this one. It's perfect for the kind of yoga practice I like to do. I love that I can choose from so many different practice sessions, meaning that I can switch it up and do something more challenging if I want or something more relaxing or even both! The session on breathing was also super helpful for me. Ruben's voice is so relaxing and I like all his reminders about the postures and to pay attention to my breathing. Plus, when I feel like practicing Spanish and yoga at the same time, then I do one of the additional sessions in Spanish. It's great practice! I've even purchased a few of these to give as gifts to friends and family and they're all fans too!",1381190400,,739,4.285714285714286
