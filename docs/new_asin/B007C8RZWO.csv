5077052,3,B007C8RZWO,Not the program I was expecting.  I thought it would be David Attenbourough but it was another British dude I'd never seen before.  The show is really well done and the bluray is stunning.  Can't beat the price of $5.00.  For any nature lover!,1341100800,4,243,4.454545454545454
5077053,3,B007C8RZWO,"This is a nice little disc but with just a little more thought it could have been even better. The presenter has a strong Welsh accent, (no bad thing as he is talking about birds in his beloved Wales), but not everyone will follow this easily and the decision to leave off subtitles is lamentable. The episodes all start off with the same rather lengthy introduction which leads to confusion as one thinks the disc may be faulty and one is getting a repeat of the previous episode. It also gets tiresome as the episodes progress. Photography is excellent and sound more than adequate. It is available very cheaply indeed and if you like this sort of niche program and are not bothered by lack of subtitles it is a good buy. Despite being labelled zone A it is actually region free and as this disc is not on sale in Wales, or anywhere else outside North America, it can be happily purchased on line for shipment anywhere.",1341100800,59,921,4.488095238095238
5077054,5,B007C8RZWO,"This excellent series shows what the birds of Wales must encounter for their survival. It is a good portrayal of European bird life, something which Americans don't often see unless they travel there.  Many of the bird families are the same, although the species have different color patterns and lifestyles from our American birds. With beautiful picture and sound made possible by the blu-ray disc, you get the closest view possible. The set contains five programs and is a little more than two and a half hours in total length.  It's now a real bargain at less than ten dollars (including shipping) from Amazon's sellers.  If you are interested in European birds, this miniseries offers much in representing the wildlife and intriguing landscape of a small country.",1337212800,36,768,5.031496062992126
5077055,5,B007C8RZWO,"This is an excellent Blu-ray DVD!  I'm a birder and I love the color and all the life of birds.  This DVD is for everyone who loves the life and beauty of birds.
It teaches you different life patterns all birds go through.  One excellent feature about this DVD is every photo of the birds are identified with the exact name of the bird.  You just don't see the bird, the naturalist (birder) who narrates and takes you through the life of birds, identifies all the different lives birds go through and identifies every bird you see.  It is excellent!",1336780800,7,549,4.45

5077068,5,B007C8RZWO,"I used this wonderful series to get over my Ornithophobia.  I don't know where my abnormal fear came from.  I guess it stems from the fact that birds are so fast, buzzing around and picking dead worms from half-rotted apples.  I also watched Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" in 1963.  That lead me to a nervous breakdown whereby I was locked up in sanatorium for convalescing for three months.

I still don't trust birds entirely since I've seen them pick at people's head.",1403913600,,471,4.695121951219512

5077071,5,B007C8RZWO,"This low-keyed documentary about the birds of Wales is one of the most delightful Nature programs I've seen in a long time. Each of the 5 episodes is only 30 minutes long, but each one is quite informative. The fact that its production values are simpler, that it doesn't strive for spectacular images, just makes it all the more enjoyable. Iolo Williams is a warm & enthused host, obviously in love with his country & its birds. What comes through is not only the wide variety of birds to be found in Wales, and the various aspects of their lives, but a feel for the countryside itself. It's not so much a lecture series as an engaging ramble with a a very good host, a sort of casual essay that's packed with scientific details. I especially like the relaxed pace, the camera lingering on its images, so that the only production value that really matters is each bird in loving focus against a gorgeous backdrop. There are many fine, dazzling bird documentaries -- this one appeals precisely because it's so warm & welcoming to the viewer -- most highly recommended!",1398816000,,1068,4.626315789473685
5077072,4,B007C8RZWO,"Do not like that you have to manually advance through each segment. Content well done, photography well done. Love the accent",1397433600,,125,5.0
5077073,3,B007C8RZWO,"I've watched the first two parts, and it's a very interesting series.  However, the sound quality is just terrible.  I have to turn the sound up incredibly high to hear and understand the narrator, who I believe is Welsh.  I watch plenty of shows with English, Scottish, and Irish narrators, so it's not a function of my ability to understand the accent.  It's a shame, because I'd really like to give this DVD a higher rating.",1396310400,2,427,4.578947368421052

5077078,5,B007C8RZWO,"Mr. Williams knows what he is doing.  He is informed about Wales, informed about the birds, informed about how they actually live in his beautiful country,  informed about how they have adapted to the presence of humans.  He truly educates the viewer on the life of the birds he shows us because he truly knows what he is talking about.  The photography is excellent.
A great 5 part series.",1391126400,,390,4.608695652173913

5077080,3,B007C8RZWO,"I bought this expecting the DVD to cover birds from around the world; the cover prominently showcases an American robin, and bearded tit and nowhere on the back of the DVD was it made known that this program only focuses on the birds of Wales, so I was a little disappointed.  Why that American robin on the cover is a mystery to me.
Anyways, it wasn't a bad DVD--birds from any region are always interesting to me and there is some lovely footage--but it just wasn't what I was expecting or hoping for.  Also, something that rubbed my feathers the wrong way was that the host put on some rose-colored glasses when covering the positive way in which birds have adapted to a human-altered environment.  While it's definitely true that some birds thrive in our cities and on our trash, I wish he'd had a more balanced approach and also covered a bit of the flip side; lots of birds are in very bad shape because of us.
All in all, not bad, but just know what you're getting.",1389571200,,972,4.418994413407821

There is some great footage, but it's mostly watching this guy and listening to him talk about birds. I'd like a lot more footage of actual birds.

He does have a fun accent though.",1387324800,5,360,4.358208955223881

5077098,5,B007C8RZWO,"I had no idea that so many birds found their homes at one time or another in Wales. Mr Williams does such a great job showing the different habits of these species. The film showed in chapter like habitats, nestsing, courtships and the works. I felt his amazement and love of these animals as I do when I am out filming or just watching them. The Dipper in Wales on the creeks and rivers was new to me but I learned we have them in the states as I went on line to find out more about the species that Mr. Williams taught about.",1365033600,3,527,4.076923076923077

5077102,4,B007C8RZWO,"This 5-part series is a nature documentary for the whole family. Natural violence, in the form of predator vs. prey, is minimized. Although limited to one geographic area, unlike Planet Earth and Life, it still shows the fascinating lives of our feathered friends. The best element to this series is how it busts the myths about being ""free as a bird"" or ""eating like a bird"".",1361836800,,376,4.712121212121212

5077104,5,B007C8RZWO,"Some people may buy this unwittingly thinking it is BBC's Life Of Birds by David Attenborough. It isn't. But it IS a very, very good mini-series about the birds of Wales, a small country that is part of Great Britain. The host, Iolo Williams, is a Welsh TV presenter and nature observer who has become famous in Britain in recent years for his documentaries. This one, which specializes in Welsh birds, is his only U.S release as of this writing. It is well worth watching whether you are a bird lover, want something family friendly or are just looking for something cheap and educational. This series delivers.

  The show is split into 5 half-hour episodes. The picture quality is very good, being a clean 1080p release. The sound quality is ok, being in simple Dolby Digital stereo. It's the cinematography that really shines here however. The scenes take place in city canals, coastal marshes, estuaries, river deltas, woodlands, mountain forests and even winter-frozen moors. Williams takes the viewer on a journey all over Wales exploring the different kinds of birds and how they migrate, find food, survive extreme conditions and most importantly, coexist with humans. Dozens of species are shown and described, many of which either live in the USA where most people reading this review live, or which have close relatives that are nearly identical to them that live in America. In other words, even though they are Welsh birds many American viewers will see familiar faces as they join Williams on his expeditions. I particularly enjoyed seeing the many kinds of Chickadees that live in Wales. Given the price of this show, which at the time of writing is only a little over $8.00 on Amazon, I highly recommend this purchase. Anyone who likes nature and nature documentaries will enjoy this as will people looking for clean, safe and educational viewing for children. This is definitely a good buy.",1361404800,15,1908,4.937694704049845
5077105,5,B007C8RZWO,"I have enjoyed having this in my bird collection of videos. It is a quality picture and nice sound, very colorful.",1361232000,,114,4.476190476190476
5077106,5,B007C8RZWO,"The photography in this series is top quality and the narration is packed with information on the birds, their habits, their adaptations to living near humans and so much more.  The Welsh countryside, seaside, and estuaries are incredibly beautiful.  Others have mentioned the commentator's accent and I can see how it could be a challenge, especially for those who have lost some hearing acuity, but I think he compensates for that possibility very well by the pace of his narration and the closeness of the verbal content to the visual.  Mr. Williams certainly gives the impression that he is an avid birder and that he has a keen interest in the subject.  This is quite frankly the best nature film that I've seen in years.  It's obviously not as lavish as say Winged Migration, which used ultralight aircraft and other high tech devices to fly with the birds on their journeys, but it does a great job of what the creators intended to do; give a beautiful up close look at the lives of Welsh birds.  For anyone interested in birds, a great buy.",1358899200,,1048,4.668478260869565
5077107,5,B007C8RZWO,"This DVD is even better than expected. I got it for a great price and we're enjoying the episodes. Great for bird lovers, nature lovers, and those just curious about the simple mysteries of the world around us. It's beautiful cinematography, informative narrative, and an insight into some of the most common and little understood of creatures in our world. You can't find a much better deal than this!",1358812800,,402,4.840579710144928
5077108,3,B007C8RZWO,"In overall, this is an enjoyable documentary to watch. It is not a super BBC production, with the typical breathtaking features one can expect from BBC videos (like underwater footages of 3-meter waves, slow motion pictures of penguins jumping out of the water or an intimate view of a mother bird feeding her chicks inside a burrow). As a matter of fact, apart from the gorgeous aerial views of welsh landscapes, the whole movie has a sort of ""home-made"" feeling, i.e., you get the impression that anyone with an HD-camera and a good narrator could have produced the same movie; the result, however, is very satisfactory. Another interesting thing: the product should be called ""The Secret Life of Welsh Birds"", as it is entirely focused in Wales and its birds (although the variety of birds that exist in Wales is truly surprising!). The narration adds a lot of value to the product, the guy really is a bird-enthusiast. One drawback: there is no subtitles menu on the disc, which makes understanding quite difficult for non-native English speakers, specially because of the strong welsh accent of the narrator..",1357689600,10,1114,4.962566844919786

This entire series is well-produced with good sound and gorgeous scenery. The informed and laid-back host was a pleasure to listen to, and his warm enthusiasm for the subject came through. Although he had plenty to teach, it was interesting rather than rattling off a series of facts. He was never crude in any way; perfect for children. There were few people in the entire DVD, including Episode 4 which addressed how birds interact and live with humans. The music was a painterly backdrop rather than intrusive.
