8476681,2,B005K9Q8TI,I found this dvd to be worthless. It does give you info on the founding of Reiki. I am a Reiki Master and my method of performing Reiki on a client and the woman in the dvd are very different.,1521244800,,192,3.825
8476682,5,B005K9Q8TI,"This CD goes into the meanings of the symbols and how to use them.  I started taking classes back in the 90's and now I am in classes again.  Back in the 90's they did not go into details like they are doing now, and this CD covers a lot more that I ever thought possible.  If your interested in learning Reiki, this CD will help you.",1514073600,,334,3.955223880597015

8476684,5,B005K9Q8TI,I found this DVD in the library. I did Reiki 1 and 2 several years ago and wanted to brush up on it. WOW! There were many things in the DVD I don't know and found very helpful.  I have watched it several times and it has given me more knowledge and confidence.,1455321600,5,260,3.9056603773584904
8476685,5,B005K9Q8TI,"I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and have learnt so much from watching it. The Reiki master is very informative and is extremely detailed in her approach to demonstrating the techniques. The subjects covered in this instructional DVD include, chakras , how our energy system  works, the history of Reiki and how we can apply this spiritual practice to other areas of our lives. As a beginner to this subject I feel this video has equipped me with a lot of valuable knowledge and I will offer this treatment to my clients
100% Happy customer and I recommend this DVD to everyone as we can all learn something from Reiki",1415404800,2,615,4.6422018348623855
8476686,5,B005K9Q8TI,"I've had this for a few weeks and it's been great. When I bought it, the product shipped fast and I got right to using it!

These techniques have really helped me hone in on my healing energy more; I can direct it better now so that it heals what needs healing more effectively. My patients really like the new techniques, it's a good skill for therapists to have to be able to change up their massage.

All the people I've started using this new knowledge on have become repeat clients and feel more emotionally fulfilled. As a healer, the best reward is to see my clients in good physical and spiritual health. I love the smiles and compliments I get!

I would for sure recommend getting this DVD, it's an essential for any Reiki Master!",1415318400,2,739,4.419117647058823
