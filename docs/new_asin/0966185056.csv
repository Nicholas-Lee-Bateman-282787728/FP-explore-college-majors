7793861,1,0966185056,"Oh boy. still images of Christmas cards, mall santas, Christmas trees, toys, and decorations with musical background. The people who gave this DVD a good review either live in a cardboard world, or they work for the company who produced this hunk-o-junk!",1227312000,,254,5.071428571428571
7793862,2,0966185056,Through no fault of amazon this DVD came up short in Christmas sights and the sounds could have been better. Maybe I was exspecting to much ? I didn't play it at all during the holidays. If I paid alot less then I did I would have still been disappointed. Sorry ! My Fault and no one else.,1168300800,,289,4.0
7793863,5,0966185056,"I am a huge Christmas fan.

This DVD is played from the begining of December to the 25 at our house.  This not a movie!! DUH. It is images and music of Christmas, and I think it's the best for getting in the mood for the season.

But don't think it's any kind of Christmas movie.  It is exactly what the title says!",1153612800,,315,3.9523809523809526
7793864,2,0966185056,"This DVD is a little strange at times. It's cute enough considering I bought it USED for around $2. But if you're going to have to pay  much more than that...don't. Some parts are cute, some are just wierd looking.",1089590400,5,214,4.35
7793865,5,0966185056,This is a must see for the X-mas season.  It is a tradition in our family to play this movie while we are setting up our tree and decorating our home for the holidays.  When you can't always see the TV screen to see the beautiful X-mas scenery we can still hear the wonderful holiday music playing.  It along with our other holiday movies are played often throughout the month of December.,1029628800,3,389,4.375
7793866,5,0966185056,"A wonderful collection of images with every type of Christmas scene you can think of, and a soundtrack that really is beautiful, unlike some of the other cheesy productions along the same lines. (""Moodscapes"" and ""The Spirit of Christmas"" come to mind......Both of them are horribly tacky.)  The producers of this video actually had enough sense to use the original Nat King Cole and Bing Crosby versions of the songs, ""Christmas Song"" and ""White Christmas"", respectively, rather than make the mistake of utilizing tacky synthesized remakes. (See the other videos listed above for THAT travesty...)  The London Symphony and Royal Philharmonic provide much of the remaining soundtrack, while ever-changing scenes of Nativities, Santas, wreaths, Christmas trees, Christmas cards, sleighs, nutcrackers, winter scenes, a few home-movies, (who's, I have no idea.....), and every other Christmas-type thing you can think of parades across your screen for 70 continuous minutes.  The only thing I really don't care for is the person who appears on the screen and lip-syncs (badly) to the song, ""Is There a Place?"", about halfway through the production.  The song, which is the only non-traditional selection in the program, is pretty dynamic taken on it's own, (in a mid-80's ""Sandi Patty/Steve Green/Larnelle Harris/Look-at-me-I've-got-the-highest-song-in-the-Christmas-musical"" sort of way, for those of you who know what I'm referring to), but I could do without Mr Lip-Sync; he's very distracting.  Even with that one slip-up, this is another great video to play during Christmas parties, while decorating the tree, annoying the cat by draping tinsel on it's head, etc..... It makes a great companion piece to the video ""In the Christmas Spirit"", which is an hour's worth of spectacular light displays on homes.  Check that one out too.",977961600,15,1833,5.436619718309859
7793867,4,0966185056,"I'm glad I took a chance and ordered this disc.  The musical selections are traditional, with a lot of my favorite standards.  Visually it is very relaxing.  All in all, a very pleasant disc that puts you in the Christmas spirit.",974592000,3,229,4.536585365853658
