They both feature members of the silent cast, first returning as adults, and later in the silent days. The other two films are from later in the series and are good in their own rights.

The video begins with Fish Hooky, a short featuring four members of the silent cast. Mickey Daniels returns as the truant officer, still in love with Mary Kornman who plays the teacher. Joe Cobb and Farina Hoskins cameo as friends of the younger gang members who encourage the kids to play hooky from school. However, it is a bad day to do so. Their teacher is planning a trip to the beachfront amusement park. When Dickie, Wheezer, Stymie, and Uh Huh discover this, they attempt to go to school, but it is too late. The truant officer is in on their plan and plays with their minds to make them think reform school is much worse than it could possibly be, equating it to a chain gang. The group gets to the beach and tries unsuccessfully to enjoy their day. Mickey keeps catching them just as they're about to get on a ride or do anything fun. In the end, the gang learns their lesson, and a young Spanky quips the final line to end the short.

The plot of Canned Fishing consists of Alfalfa and Spanky planning to skip school and go fishing with Buckwheat and Porky. Spanky's mother gets wise to this plan (Buckwheat tells her) and decides to let the boys stay home, but only if they take care of Junior. He gets into all sorts of trouble, and they don't get to go fishing. The short is cute and clever.

The Awful Tooth is a mediocre short about the gang, Spanky, Alfalfa, Buckwheat, and Porky. They learn that the ""good fairy"" gives money for lost teeth. They get the bright idea to go to the dentist to have all of their teeth pulled so they can make plenty of cash to buy some sports equipment. The dentist plays along, and plays the mean dentist to the hilt, scaring the kids with an array of sharp contraptions. They decide not to go through with it, only to find that the ""good fairy"" has stopped by to give them new baseball things to play with.

Dogs Of War is one of the gems of the silent era. It begins with the kids playing war in a tomato patch. Mikey gets hit with a tomato and goes to get help from beautiful nurse Mary. Then, her mother comes to collect her daughter who has to go to work on the movie lot to earn five dollars. The kids think this sound swell, so they go to the lot to offer their services as actors. Instead they're chased off, but the kids don't give up. They manage to get a tour of the lot, a rather quick one of course. Harold Lloyd makes an appearance and helps the youngsters hide from security. In the end, the kids manage to wreck a day of filming on Mary's movie set, but with hilarious results. This film was shot on the actual Hal Roach lot.",1126137600,4,2871,4.2623853211009175
