This short documentary about Edward James, who began as a poet, artist, and patron of the Surrealists, is one answer to those questions. Born into a life of aristocratic luxury, he pursued his artistic interests from an early age, resisting all attempts to take up his father's business, preferring instead to create & collect art. In time, he settled in Mexico & began building a home that's a Surrealist estate, a work of art in the depths of a gorgeous green jungle, offering surprises & unexpected delights at every turn.

Granted, few people will ever have the financial resources to follow in Edward James' wonderfully eccentric & creative footsteps. But it is possible to find or make both time & space within your own life for something more than the everyday routine. I'm not dismissing the need for food, shelter, security -- obviously that's required! Still, so many people who have lived in the most dire of circumstances have recalled later on just how deeply a touch of beauty & contemplation restored their souls & kept them going. That sort of inner nourishment is more vital than we may realize ... and Edward James' life offers a possible path. Recommended!",1306281600,2,1306,4.698689956331878

This film challenges the imagination; at times you will feel like you're in a whimsical dream.  You will enter the imagination of surrealist architect Edward James and learn about his intriguing life, accomplishments, and dedication to surrealism. Watching ""Edward James: Builder of Dreams"" is an excellent way to learn why architect Edward James is an artistic legacy.  I didn't know his name before I watched this, but now I feel like I should have sooner.  This film comes strongly recommended.",1257292800,2,1003,7.849557522123894
