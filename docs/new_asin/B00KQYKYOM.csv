8660889,5,B00KQYKYOM,"although the production of this show is low budget and it does show it is a step up from the first "" season"". i should however be able to play all episodes continously instead of having to go back to the menu to play each rather short episode. that being said this ""cooking show"" of italian anerican food is one of the BEST out there. simple, easy to follow, authentic, intresting and goodness.... entertaining! steve is quite the personality! lots of from the heart advice, that I've used and passed on too. great recipes that work perfectly and to my surprise, have impressed my guest. major problem is this, this dvd leaves you with wanting more. more episodes, more recipes, more advice and stories, more ""seasons"" to watch and learn, laugh and enjoy.",1432339200,,755,4.684210526315789
