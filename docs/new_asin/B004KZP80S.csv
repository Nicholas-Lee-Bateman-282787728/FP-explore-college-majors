4399032,5,B004KZP80S,I saw this when it came out on TV in '55 when I was twelve. Newman was brand new to the film industry after his work in THE SILVER CHALICE. I never forgot this and still watched it even if the film was ravaged by age.,1428019200,,217,3.739130434782609
4399033,3,B004KZP80S,"Nice teleplay from the 50's Poor screen quality otherwise would rate higher. Newman is good, yet can't top Jack Palance in, Requiem for a Heavyweight (Playhouse 90 version). The whole cast in that teleplay is amazing. And, c'mon how great is Rod Serling at getting to the heart of the piece? Man, how I'd love to see some live drama today.",1427760000,,339,4.573770491803279

4399036,3,B004KZP80S,"The actors' work is very good. Quality of the print is degraded but this is must-see classic version, if you are into mid-century modern you might want to spend a bit of time looking at the work people did to provide television programming at the time. How sad today's work is compared to this, even if the quality is poor. I'd give it more stars if it was restored.",1385942400,,366,4.318840579710145
8433654,5,B004KZP80S,"Review of The Battler
Hot Toasty Rag, July 16, 2017

I haven't yet seen it, but Ernest Hemingways Adventures of a Young Man was made seven years after The Battler as a more thorough version of the story, based on Hemingways collection of short stories featuring the character Nick Adams. This one-hour television special was created as part of the Playwright 56 program, and as this episode was released the year before Somebody Up There Likes Me, it was the perfect audition for Paul Newman to show off his acting chops.

Originally a short story written in 1925, The Battler follows a young drifter as he runs away from home. He hitchhikes, rides a train, and learns a homeless mans tragic story. I don't want to spoil too much, but if you liked Somebody Up There Likes Me, you need to watch this (or the longer 1962 version). Paul Newman gives a heartbreaking performance. Im not just trying to give a good review; I actually cried. I look forward to watching the 1962 movie, since Newman reprises his role in the film, and I hear its just as emotional a performance.",1500163200,,1070,4.596858638743456

8433662,2,B004KZP80S,"They filmed a bit part of Hemingways movie, and he puts out another hour TV show of the Battler and I didn't get that at all.  I got a negro former boxer gone in the head, and a whitie stoodge following him around and dealing with him, feeding him and etc. and it had a strange former slave relations that he's the one taking care of him to old age. I didn't get this one at all to a person released and coming across the Battler.",1428364800,,430,4.0
8433663,5,B004KZP80S,"A piece of time travel here back to the golden age of TV. A three-act play Kinescoped for the future. Remember this was before video tape. I barely recognized Newman in the hobo camp opening scene. No question he showed great talent, presaging memorable characters like Fast Eddie Felson, Cool Hand Luke and Graziano in Somebody Up There Likes Me.",1428019200,,347,4.8
