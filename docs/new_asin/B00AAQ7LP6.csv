5406423,2,B00AAQ7LP6,Just got the bluray thinking it would have awesome audio and at least 1080i or better picture. Guess not. Audio was horrible and so was picture. Only reason it got 2 stars being a fan of the songs.,1355875200,22,197,4.2105263157894735
5406424,1,B00AAQ7LP6,"This BD has no HD audio (DTS-MA or TrueHD).  It just has the standard Dolby digital.  DO NOT buy.  Cannot believe they put out a blu-ray concert in today's world.  The sound is horrible.  The 2 channel version of the audio sounds just like the TV sound, literally.  The 5.1 Dolby Digital is totally a nightmare to listen too.  I only able to watch 3 songs before turning it off.  It is that bad.

Just to give you an idea what a bad production this is, the Blu-ray doesn't even include artwork jacket with song names or anything.  The BD just has the disc and that was it.  I contacted Amazon to get my money back but since I already opened it, I will just throw it in the trash instead.  Please people, DO NOT BUY this.",1355788800,29,720,4.175182481751825

5406441,5,B00AAQ7LP6,"Love the Loud era. Love the tour costumes. They looked hot and funky especially those boots! Wasn't really happy that she left out Darling Nikki and the Glamorous life, tho. I don't know if it's because those aren't her songs. She also left out Run This Town and Live your life. She's very good at energizing the crowd and especially love the interaction she has with her audience. For example, she takes pics of her fans and then herself and gives them back their camera. How sweet. What other pop star does that? Another one, she does a lapdance on her female fans..well actually rides on them, lol. They were just giggling with excitement. It reminds me of when I was watching the All For You tour on dvd and Janet was riding on a male fan during her Do You Mind performance, lol. The only difference is Rihanna did it on two girls. At times, she reminded me of Madonna, Whitney, and Bob Marley all in one. Her vocals were good and she sang live. I would say the Loud tour is much more developed and established than her Good Girl Gone Bad tour. This one would make a great add to your Rihanna collection. They should also release her Last Girl on Earth tour on dvd. Never really got to see that one.",1381276800,,1203,4.351111111111111

5406458,2,B00AAQ7LP6,"What can I say? I went to a concert for Rihanna's Loud tour and was disappointed by the sound; the music was too loud to hear clearly, and Rihanna's lyrics were very quiet and were mumbled - at one point, and I'm not exaggerating, I genuinely had no idea what song was being performed. I put the problems down to the venue and the possibility that Rihanna was simply ill on the night of the concert that I attended, so watched my sister's copy of this dvd to see what the concert should be like...

... Well now I know that the sound issues weren't down to the particular venue - the dvd has iffy sound too, so the problem must lie with the tour equipment. Sure in comparison to the live experience the sound on the dvd is good, but in comparison to other concert dvds it is sort of muffled. Kind of like hearing something underwater.

Plus Rihanna wasn't ill on the night I saw her. Sorry to Rihanna fans, but I think that this dvd shows that she's just not all that. Sure; she sounds great on her albums, but she is a bit all over the place live. The vocals are there at times [especially for the final third of the show], but she doesn't have a lot of control over them.

***

With  the dvd I spent more time looking beyond the sound issues and was left underwhelmed by the Loud show as a whole. The set pieces were random and blend-in-the-background dark, the costumes were dull, the dancing was the usual 'dry humping' and the set list was boring - she picked too many of her filler songs to perform.

To sum it up; the dvd bored me and helped me make up my mind not to waste money on another Rihanna concert.",1361145600,,1614,4.207119741100324
5406459,2,B00AAQ7LP6,I just received this blue ray and is so sad that the sound is so terrible that doesn't give you any excitement at all to see it. I have the blue ray of her previous tour and is totally a different experience. I'm so disappointed that I did read the reviews before. At first I thought that the one I received was damage until I start reading. An artist at that level should get involved in details so important like that.,1360713600,3,420,4.197530864197531
5406460,3,B00AAQ7LP6,"We gathered with my friends to watch this blu ray (I haven't watched it before this party so it was the first experience for all of us) and the sound was just killing the whole thing. While the concert itself is amazing the audio is just not as good as you expect in 2012/2013. Video quality is OK but sometimes you can notice pixels. Not actually pixels but large squares like the footage was taken in SD and then remastered, you see those (or something similar) while watching cable with problems on the line. Long story short: the release is OK but not awesome. Take care!",1360713600,3,575,4.433962264150943

5406467,3,B00AAQ7LP6,"Just bought this Blu-ray Concert DVD and have to agree the sound quality on this Blu-ray is not good; kind of messed up.  The concert itself is excellent and she does a great job of the performance and skiing but the sound quality was NOT Blu-ray quality; it sounded like a regular DVD if that.  Alot of people complained about the sound quality and made me hesitate to buy it, but I enjoy her music too much to pass it up.  I knew the sound quality was off when I put in another Blu-ray concert (Yanni) and the sound quality of the Blu-ray was stunning compared to this.

I hope Rihanna's managers are reading these reviews and fire the company who made this DVD sound.  Every single other Blu-ray concert DVD I have sounds better than this one.  Buy this if you love Rihanna's music but be warned the sound quality is not like normal Blu-rays",1359244800,4,844,4.378205128205129

I prefer less to see, so we can want her more. Here ""more"" is ruining what could of been a great video. I guess performers are persuded by alot of fake friends, promotors, video directors that just nod yes to keep their jobs or obtain the good side of a performer who is just looking for approval.
I wish Rihanna would look at her earlier video, and I also miss her past back up singers, these back up singers did not sound good.",1359158400,,635,4.3

All round it was a great dvd.",1358726400,,268,3.890909090909091
5406471,5,B00AAQ7LP6,"I buy a ton of products on Amazon, and rarely publish reviews...  but I had pre-ordered this on Blu-Ray long ago, because 1) I have a huge collection of live concert Blu-Rays and DVDs and buy most everything and 2) I was personally at this concert in London at the O2 (the December 20th show in 2011).  It was an incredible show and experience (I got to meet Rihanna herself in a meet and greet after the concert), and having a chance to have a professionally shot video of the full concert (mostly) is amazing.

However, when I was expecting the Blu-Ray to be delivered, it wasn't...  I checked my order, and it was canceled because people complained to Amazon about the sound.  What the heck?  It took a full year for them to put this video out - could the sound be THAT BAD?  Well, I ordered it from Amazon from one of their marketplace sellers (so as a consequence didn't get to take advantage of my Amazon Prime subscription with shipping).

In any event, all that aside, I have the Blu-Ray version of it now, I've watched it, and it is awesome.  If there weren't all these complaints about the sound, I honestly wouldn't have really given the quality of it much though - it is definitely no worse than the average sound quality of my hundreds of concert DVDs and Blu-Rays in my collection, and as another reviewer astutely pointed out, if you are accustomed to listening to MP3s, there is really no difference.  If you are an audiophile with a $10,000 audio system in your home, maybe it will leave you wanting more.  I have a $1,000 sound bar and $500 subwoofer and it sounds awesome to me.

So if you are a fan of Rihanna, I'd say buy it, and if you hate the sound for some reason, Amazon has a pretty liberal return policy.

The concert is awesome, and there are some nice behind the scenes bits cut in that are nice, and not the kind that are not very rewatchable like with some music concert videos - mostly short and backed with music.

The main concert is cut together from the last set of shows at the O2 (obviously taking the best cuts from each show), and it is beautifully shot and nicely edited (thankfully not hyper cut MTV style like many are).

One song missing from the product is Rihanna's cover of Prince's ""Darling Niki"", which I guess explains why my amateur shot version from the show that I put on YouTube gets a lot of hits.

All in all, an amazing show in person and very thankfully to have this Blu-Ray of the same show to have to experience an awesome live show again and again at home.",1358553600,4,2518,4.359743040685225

5406473,3,B00AAQ7LP6,"THis is a great DVD of the Concert, but the Audio does suck.  Dont even bother listening to it in Dolby Digital, as its recording sucks, sounds much better in standard Stereo.",1358121600,16,175,4.46875
5406474,2,B00AAQ7LP6,"This is a difficult blu-ray to review. The main reason for buying it is obviously Rihanna's performance and there is nothing wrong with the show itself. The show is great and is everything you probably would like to see in a Rihanna performance.

Show/performance: 5 stars

It is the poor quality that went in to the production of this blu ray that is the problem. I cannot comprehend how Def Jam/Universal Music were able to mess this one up in the way they did. Surely they must have sufficiently qualified people to make a decent product.

Video: it feels like an upscaled DVD version. The image is sharp, colours are a bit flat and some compression is noticable. Compared to her previous blu ray, video quality is not as good.

Overall video quality is fair: 3 stars

Audio quality is a different story. No HD audio content and the audio they did use is low quality, outdated, 128Kbps stereo and 240Kbps 5.1 The overall result is a very flat sound that lacks the live feeling you should get when watching a concert. This impression is further strengthened by a lack of bass tones and overall volume. It just sounds flat and empty. Vocals on the other hand are pretty clear resulting in the slower songs to be the best on the disc since they are not so much hampered by the disc's poor audio conversion.

Overall audio quality is poor: 1 star

So, as I said a difficult product to review.

In the end there is only one question I asked myselves: does it give me the feeling I am watching a live performance of Rihanna on my hometheater set? Sadly no, although the performance is great the audio quality is just too poor to fully enjoy this concert.

Overall rating: 2 stars",1357862400,27,1676,4.5049504950495045
5406475,5,B00AAQ7LP6,"Let's be honest... in the creation of this Blu Ray, corners were certainly cut in the audio quality put onto the disc.  Was this a mistake or on purpose?  I do not know... however... this is a technical issue.  Step away from that.  Is it listenable audio even if not all it could have been? YES.  May you have to crank your system to get it loud?  YES.  Could it use more bottom end?  YES.  Does the mix do the songs and musicianship full justice?  No. But, does it still sound good?  YES.  It is funny... most people are buying MP3s which dumb down the audio quality... and then are going to worry about the sound quality here?  To most people, the sound issues on this Blu Ray are not going to make the product unenjoyable.

This product is about the concert and the documentation of the Loud Tour.  I am so thankful it exists in a flawed version rather than not at all.  Why?  Because it was THE BEST concert I EVER saw.  I am over 40 and have been attending concerts for decades and have seen the best of the best and average 10 arena concerts a year live and countless at smaller venues along with countless ones viewed on TV or DVD/Blu Ray.  Rihanna's Loud Tour had EVERYTHING you could possibly want in an arena show.  Great stage that was neither simplistic nor overly complicated... it just looked great and complimented the show and artist.  The large movable circle screens, outlined stage lighting, synched video footage, and all the rest was great.  Then you add in the occasional props for certain songs.  You add in backup dancers used appropriately in and between songs.  You ensure the music is played by top notch musicians including a world class guitarist in Nuno Bettencourt (Extreme).  Add in spot on backing vocals to keep the sound thick and accurate to the recorded versions.  Now, add in the fact that all these awesome musicians end up creating versions of the songs that surpass the studio version in quality (unfortunately slightly harder to tell with the poor audio mix, I will admit).  Add in elevating stage areas and treadmills, etc... have the stage configuration change regularly... change the outfits regularly... and add some great use of smoke, lighting and even a little pyro and even confetti.  It basically had everything you would want in a concert... and all this is before even mentioning Rihanna.  She rocks... her moves are great, she is fun to watch, and she never gets enough credit for her singing.  Unlike the lip synchers out there, she does her moves and her singing and she doesn't hide where she weaves in and out of the backup singers.  Rihanna has a very unique voice and a perfect blend of control and swagger and looseness in her performances.  She is as made to be on stage as Michael Jackson was.  And she commands the same stop and watch attention.  To top all of that off... Rihanna has a crazy amount of hits and Loud was probably the last tour that will feature a mix of hits and a few other great songs that were not big singles but kick butt live.  By now, Rihanna can fill an entire show with just her hit singles... and the only negative will eventually be (probably starting with this next tour) that she will have to leave many great songs unplayed.  Not a bad problem to have.  Anyway... why focus on the negatives of this release compared to the positives??  It was imperative that this tour be documented and available for historical purposes. If you judge this release by the show itself... you will LOVE it... and if someday they release a better audio blu ray... I bet you will buy that too because this show is THAT GOOD!

It is sad that the concert itself is not earning the 5 stars it easily deserves purely due to the technical issues many are pointing out.  As a concert, honestly, even trying here, I still couldn't possibly say enough to convey how great the Loud Tour was.  I saw it live... 4th row center in Chicago, it was beyond amazing... and being able to re-live it with this Blu Ray really makes it my favorite Blu Ray in my collection... problems and all.",1357516800,4,4048,4.513067400275103

When you put in the dvd it begins to play right away, (there is a home menu where you can select your favorite performances to re-watch over and over again). In between the 20 performances is behind the scenes footage where rihanna talks about tour life and you get a peak inside the international stars jet setting Singer life style. My favorite part was when rihanna and her friends were putting on a birthday party for a crew member/friend, rihanna laugh is so infectious. I really enjoyed it.

5406479,4,B00AAQ7LP6,"Nothing to complain about here. Good show, Rihiana shows growth in every area since her last Good Girl Gone Bad Blu-Ray. Those who complained about bad sound need to check/upgrade their systems. Dolby Digital sound was clear and powerful. Several sexy costume changes and good pacing throughout. She is indeed talented and not just a MTV Video Vixen. Would have liked some video extras and a booklet. All you get is the concert with a few offstage looks at her tour. But it was a very good tour, staging effects musicians singers and dancers are all first rate. Reccomended.",1356912000,2,574,4.808080808080808
5406480,5,B00AAQ7LP6,"Listen I am a Rihanna Fan avid supporter but not delusional so let me tell you..she slays!!!The dvd has everything you expect from Rihanna, Amazing Vocal(seriously)..Dancing(seriously)..Visuals. She has come leaps and bounds..her vocals are amazing..she actually sings..no lipping here no Britney Spears...She actually dances..now this isn't. Broadway quality but it fits her..she engaged and we all know she doesn't focus 100 on dancing because she actually sings.

The visuals are stunning from the outfits to stage. I am most proud of her vocals because that training has been paying off. I would hope that u would purchase this item if only for ""Breaking Dishes""..btw she is very humanized in this dvd with the behind the scenes. She is followed through promo and the making of Talk That Talk..you will enjoy",1356739200,3,812,5.246153846153846
5406481,1,B00AAQ7LP6,"I bought the DVD hoping to see what the fuss is about Rihanna. Too bad she is just another pop gimmik that uses her body to sell records. I was so dissapointed. Her singing is terrible and she grunts. The stage production was cheap and no concept.

NO TALENT",1356566400,5,258,4.26530612244898
5406482,1,B00AAQ7LP6,I was so happy when i got this Rihanna concert bluray disc! I like her and she is amazing! But once i put the disc in bluray player....... WTF....... What's wrong with my 5.1 sound system?? Really poor sound quality and there is NO LIVE feeling...... I really hope that they can re-work the sound engineering again! Such a great concert!! PLEASE DONT WASTE IT!!......... :(,1355961600,15,373,4.666666666666667
5406483,1,B00AAQ7LP6,"MPEG-2 in 2012? 224 kbps DD in 2012 on a bluray! Are you kidding me! I have dvd concerts with 1.5 mbps DTS on a 4.7gb dvd.

This is unacceptable in every sense of the word and the menus are dvd quality too boot! The disc needs to be redone or taken off the market end of story.

Her bluray concert from 2008 had DTS-HD and AVC and looked fantastic on a BD-25! A BD-25 is more than enough room for great audio and video of concert material. The DTS-HD track is over 5 mbps for most of the concert.

For those that got the deluxe edition of her new cd a sampler of the concert is on a dvd. The sound mix is totally different and sounds much better. The dvd uses .19 kbps 2 channel DD. The bluray uses .224 kbps 5.1 DD and .12 kbps 2 channel DD and the bluray sounds noticable worse with both tracks than the dvd. Be prepared to turn up your receiver as well. Mine went up by 10+ db. MPEG-2 averages around 18 mbps for video.

Amazon quite selling this for good reason. This appears to be a great concert that needs a redo concerning it's bluray! Houstan we have a problem!",1355961600,31,1070,4.056872037914692
5406484,5,B00AAQ7LP6,rihanna continues to prove with this concert dvd that she is at the top of the music world. A must for any Rihanna fan,1355875200,3,118,3.9583333333333335
5406485,1,B00AAQ7LP6,"I bought this for my wife as she is a huge Rihanna fan. Well, she is disappointed to say the least. She loves to blast her Blu-Ray concerts on our surround sound and the audio from this Blu-Ray falls way below expectations. Like another has mentioned, there is NO HD AUDIO. Just Dolby Digital 5.1, which is abysmal and Dolby Digital Stereo which makes it sound like Im listening to it through the TV speakers.
To compare, I bought my wife, one of the other Rihanna concerts, on DVD(Good Girl Gone Bad) and the audio on the DVD is MUCH better compared to this one. The songs that have bass do not have any bass and when it does hit, if any, it sounds off.
Video quality is just average, slightly better than DVD.
Also, there is no pop-up menu!
Very disappointed in this, not Amazon, but the audio producers of this Blu-Ray.

Heres a hint for the audio producers: If you're going to offer a concert on Blu-Ray, make sure it has HD Audio!",1355875200,31,935,4.3428571428571425
