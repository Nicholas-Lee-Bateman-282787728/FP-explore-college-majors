3906323,5,B002CLKOWY,"I didn't know what to think with this movie, but in the end I absolutely loved it. It's a quirky story-line, and I can understand why some people don't get it, or don't like it, but there are so many good things about it. The actors are great, the story is original, and I thought the direction was done very well. It made me cry, and it made me want to watch it again, both signs of a good movie to me!!",1253750400,12,404,3.9390243902439024

3906325,3,B002CLKOWY,"This movie wasn't what I was expecting, in both good and bad ways. With James Franco, Sienna Miller, and David Carradine, this isn't an all-star cast, but it's also a pretty decent one. The film has at times a corny mid-Western, genuine Americana flavor (cowboy showmen, small-town sheriffs, etc.), which makes its low-budget appearance tolerable. You can't take the film too seriously, which means you can actually enjoy it for what it's worth.

I thought the plot was emotional and actually made me stop to think how much I should appreciate those I love. Near the beginning of the film, Franco and Miller's characters get married, but the marriage seems destined to be an unhappy one. However, soon afterward, they get into an accident and Miller (Camille) dies. Well, kind of. Her ghost lingers on because she was not prepared to die. The rest of the film is about the couple finally learning to appreciate each other and find the happiness that had eluded them for so long. In a real sense, the ""ghost"" plot device is a metaphor for something like a terminal disease in real life, when we know a loved one will die soon. Camille touchingly shows us to live that small window of life to the fullest.

Now, the bad. Like many other films involving supernatural plot twists and ghosts (I'm thinking The Sixth Sense), Camille sometimes lacks internal consistency. For example, soon after the dead Camille breaks a finger merely from pulling her hand away from her husband's, she manages to slap him in the face. This certainly doesn't help sell an already implausible concept - namely that Camille is dead, but can interact with everybody normally. If you can forgive such problems and make the intellectual leap into believing the story for the sake of watching the movie, it's not too bad.",1253577600,4,1792,4.814935064935065

3906327,1,B002CLKOWY,"Described on the DVD case as a ""romantic comedy,"" anything comedic in this film immediately fizzles out.  Wikipedia calls it a ""horror comedy,"" which is half correct.  Opening with a young bride's completely inexplicable devotion to a zero of a guy, followed by developments which make no sense even if one accepts this ""fantasy"" movie's absurd premises, the following 90 minutes of slog presents a terrible way to spend precious lifetime on Earth, and waste a Friday or Saturday evening.

Yes, the actress looked wonderful in the red wig.  And Scott Glenn's performance, as always, was great.  Still, do avoid this piece of trash.",1251590400,2,631,5.028846153846154
3906328,1,B002CLKOWY,"Blu Ray transfer looked decent. Film didn't really need a whole lot of surround sound so it didn't utilize it very much. I was halfway through the movie when I wanted to turn it off, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and continued to watch the whole thing. Big mistake...

The movie has a very interesting storyline and is definitely the best part of the movie. The acting was certainly sub-par with a lot of forced dialogue and very predictable lines. I would definitely rent this before purchasing just to make sure you'll enjoy it.",1250294400,,539,4.5
3906329,5,B002CLKOWY,"This is a wonderful film that dares to go out on a limb with a premise that is engaging and magical. Didn't know what to expect and found myself caught up in these characters and their journey.  Camille is one of those pictures that surprises and delights. Seriously, a lost film that should have had it's day.",1249430400,5,310,4.43859649122807
3906330,4,B002CLKOWY,"Camille is an absorbingly cute romantic comedy. James Franco is super as 'the bad boy' who captures the attention of the big-hearted and good girl Camille (Sienna Miller). I don't want to get into 'spoiling' at all (the film takes you for a ride outside the realm of the norn for sure), but I will tell you that when Camille turns red-head, she is even more adorable than she is as a blonde.

From the opening wedding to the fantasy-laden, fairy-tale finale, Camille is a fun film for the happliy-ever-after minded.

PS: great role played by David Carradine btw...",1246233600,9,564,4.686868686868687

3906350,5,B002CLKOWY,I probably enjoyed this movie way more than I should have. It's definitely a dark comedy. James Franco plays the reluctant husband that comes across as a bit of an ass to his new bride. Something happens that makes him have a change of heart and the quirky adventure to Niagara Falls begins. Well worth seeing...I laughed out loud many times...but my sense of humor is a bit dark.,1366848000,2,380,4.521739130434782

3906373,3,B002CLKOWY,"MID-POINT PLOT SPOILER which you may already know from reading the DVD box.

Silas (James Franco) is a James Dean wannabe bad boy. He is on parole. He is basically a good guy who likes to steal stuff. He has known Camille (Sienna Miller) since childhood. She is an overly outgoing talker, which drives Silas crazy. Once married they head off to Niagara Falls. Along the way they meet David Carradine, a horse philosopher. He is not the guy you normally want to meet in a movie wearing a wedding dress.

Through a mishap (PLOT SPOILER) Camille dies along the way...no wait she's not dead, but comes back to life so she can complete her trip to Niagara Falls with the only man she has ever loved, even if he doesn't return it. Needless to say her being part of the living dead poses some hygiene problems, although the humor didn't work well.

Outside of the death issue, the film isn't that quirky. While funny at times, it is not an over whelming comedy. The romantic aspect comes through, but when you play drippy violin music, you can make any scene of a couple coming together feel like something wonderful. The film was shot from the Canadian side of the falls because it is more scenic, but in the production they pretend it is the US.

No f-bombs or sex. Camille is ""nude"" at one point with her arms strategically placed. Not a fantastic scene Dan.",1338768000,3,1354,4.491869918699187
3906374,5,B002CLKOWY,"I'm very suprised at the number of people who cannot see this for what it is: a fairy tale romance.  Not much different than Snow White, or Cinderella.  But because it is played out by real people, not cartoon characters, it's hard for some people to realize that it's just a romantic story.

You can't call it a ""horror comedy"", as there isn't any horror in it.  You can't really call it a ""romantic comedy"", as there isn't much comedy about it. There's no violence to make it an ""action"" film.  There's no gore and barely any sight of blood that would make it a ""horror"" film.  There's scarcely enough bad language to even warrant it's PG-13 rating.

What there is is a deeply penetrating love story that asks a simple question: If you were truly in the worse way you could possibly be, would you want someone to have pity, and compassion, and help you?  And if you knew that person, how much would you be willing to sacrifice to help them?  Does love end at death?  Or is it more powerful than that, defeating it, and enduring to the end?

When you realize that the story line is almost a remaking of the classic Cinderella story, then you can start to see it for what it is.  She feels worthless and undeserving of love.  He sees through the outward appearances to see a girl who is afraid and confused, and depending upon him to support and strengthen her.  And he rises to the occasion, and sees her through to the end, himself making the ultimate sacrifice for her.

Love is stronger than death, and is born out of mercy and compassion for others.

That is the story line.  But if all you can see is ""Eeew!  She's dead"", then I'm afraid you will miss all that.  Keep in mind that you, too, are dead.  Is there someone willing to reach even into your grave to help you in your time of need?  Giving up their own life in the process?  As Shakespeare said, ""Aye! There's the rub!""",1326499200,2,1884,4.33810888252149
3906375,1,B002CLKOWY,I didn't like this movie at all. It wasn't funny and it was just a strange movie. I usually like James Franco that's why I wanted to see this movie but his character is so unlikeable. The only thing I liked about this movie were the colored horses.,1315267200,,248,4.1875
3906376,4,B002CLKOWY,"As of submitting this review, I just finished watching Camille for the first time. I didn't quite know what to expect from the movie as most of the reviews seemed to be evenly spread on Amazon and has a just above average rating on IMDb. But it sounded like a movie I'd enjoy so I decided to check it out. I was somewhat surprised actually. It's not a particularly great movie but a good movie nonetheless.

The movie follows newlywed couple Silas and Camille. Silas is a petty thief on parole who has recently married his parole officer's niece. This is more a marriage of convenience for Silas as he's truly only wanting to get to Canada. Camille however actually does love Silas though she somewhat starts to think early on he might not return the feeling.

On their way to Niagara Falls, the two are involved in a motorcycle crash in which it's discovered later that Camille really did die in the crash. Feeling guilty over what happened, Silas starts being kinder to Camille and the two slowly and truly begin enjoying their honeymoon trip all the while back home, a local sheriff believes Silas has murdered Camille and they go after the two.

The movie actually is a fairly sweet romantic comedy. Good news for guys is that it seems to be pretty evenly directed at both genders and not obviously directed at just women like some romantic comedies.  The ending was definitely pretty touching. As far as te actors, I really enjoyed David Carridine as Cowboy Bob the most though all the actors did pretty well. All in all, it's not a movie that will bring a tear to your eye, but is a fun watch.

It might not be a movie you'll go crazy over, but I'd say give it a shot with seeing it.",1309132800,6,1689,4.453074433656958

3906378,4,B002CLKOWY,"This is one of those films where you just get on board with the premise and enjoy the ride! And enjoy it I did. Don't pick it apart intellectually. It's a fantasy love story with a creative twist for goodness sake. I rented, and came to Amazon to purchase if that says anything. PS The ""full frontal"" was tastefully done. No nipples or genitals. Not a problem for children.",1295222400,2,373,4.420289855072464
3906379,3,B002CLKOWY,"I love James Franco, so I am slightly bias, but I did enjoy the movie. It was a little strange and it didn't really make sense, the end was especially odd, but maybe that was the point. I did like how the relationship between the two leading characters developed. There was a few 'Awe' moments, but it isn't the type of movie that most people would enjoy.",1290384000,,355,4.313432835820896

3906381,5,B002CLKOWY,"At the beginning of this movie, I didn't know what to expect, but by the ending I was fighting back the tears.  I know, it's a crazy plot, and even quite silly, but I think a lot of people miss the pure intent of the film.  It's not realistic, but hey, it's probably the most touching movie I've seen.  I loved Sienna Miller in her role as Camille, and frankly, I loved the ending also.  Actually, this was, in my opinion, the ONLY way it should have ended.  Enjoy the movie for what it is - a really feel-good, heartwarming story - silly though it may be.  Loved it!",1260921600,21,567,4.155963302752293
3906382,2,B002CLKOWY,"With a cast including Sienna Miller, James Franco and David Carradine I guess I wanted a lot more from this movie. Also I thought they could have explored what happens to someone when they die and are in essence a zombie (well kinda). The best word I've seen describing this movie is ""cute."" It's a very cute movie involving someone dying and becoming the undead. If it was on TV I'd say watch it, I would suggest you buy it.
