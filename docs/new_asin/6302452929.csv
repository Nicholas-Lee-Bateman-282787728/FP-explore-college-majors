471684,4,6302452929,"Beware! Even though this video is well done, this is NOT the HBO film starring Graham Greene and Jon Voight. This video is a History Channel _In Search of History_ episode--that is, it is a documentary. The information provided is insightful and the presentation is of the highest order; however, as a teacher of 14-15 year-old high school students who prefer feature films to documentaries, receiving this was a major disapppointment.",982368000,2,435,5.140845070422535

The made for TV video stars Jon Voight as an anthropologist interested in Ishi's (played admirably by Graham Greene of  Dance's With Wolves fame) life story.

471718,4,6302452929,"I first heard Ishi's story during my freshman year of college (in 1972) from a remarkable anthropology instructor who had grown up in California during the years immediately after Ishi was discovered. I now use the HBO film each year as part of an anthropology unit I teach on the high school level. It's a story that most students outside of California generally aren't exposed to, but should be. The film is very effective, although some of the historical details are slightly manipulated. Jon Voight (as always) is solid as Professor Henry Kroeber, and Graham Greene gives a heartbreaking performance as Ishi. This is a
truly sad story that more Americans should be aware of-----it typically has a pretty dramatic effect on my students. It's a good movie, based on a great story.",1466208000,4,782,4.887218045112782

471877,5,6302452929,"This is a very well made movie.  Graham Greene did a wonderful job of acting, and made Ishi  come alive upon the big screen. Long ago I had visited the Golden Gate Museum in California. While there a curator told me that I was standing in the room where Ishi had spent the better part of his last days on earth.  If I had known his story back then I would have asked many more questions.",1322697600,,387,4.065789473684211

This was a very sad period in American history, and the effects of the Government's policies are not glossed over.

I'd recommend this movie wholeheartedly.",1320796800,,350,4.915254237288136

471881,3,6302452929,"This is a fairly good film; I just happen to think the title is misleading. Sure it tells the partial story of a man who became the 'last of his tribe', but it concentrates on the also very interesting story of the men who knew him best in the last years of his life. I'm not sure if this film really knew where it was going, whose story it was, or why it should be told. I sort of feel this is two films cobbled together ...... but not very well.

Ishi was apparently the last member of the Yahi tribe who 'appeared' out of the Northern California countryside in the early years of the 20th Century. He was then taken in by Alfred Kroeber, a professor of Anthropology for the final 5 years of his life. the film covers this period and while accurate does not really delve too deeply into the character of Ishi, but focusses on Kroeber and how this period was difficult in his life.

As I've already said this is quite a good film, but I think the title should reference Kroeber so watchers are not mislead. The story as to 'how' Ishi became the 'last of his tribe' really deserves a separate film in itself. in the meantime for more on this very intricate and human story I'd suggest reading ""Ishi Rediscovered""; ""Ishi's Brain""; ""Ishi the Last Yahi"" and ""Ishi in Two Worlds"". If you can find a copy you might also want to see the made for TV film ""Ishi, the Last of His Tribe"" (made in the late 1970's).",1305072000,7,1404,4.254681647940075

471883,4,6302452929,"Others have already summarized the plot so I will just comment on the emotional impact of this movie. It is difficult to watch movies about Native Americans because they always have a sad ending. Certainly movies like 'Dances with Wolves"" do their utmost to tug at your heartstrings. The story itself is sad enough but Hollywood cinematography does its best to make you wish ol' Columbus had sailed off the edge of the earth and never discovered the Americas.

This movie has an undeniably sad tale to tell about how Ishi's people were driven to extinction...but it is mercifully restrained. Instead the movie focuses on the kindness of anthropologist Krober, Ishi's patience as he struggles to adapt to the white world, the respect and friendship that grows between the two men. The actor playing Ishi does a marvelous portrayal of this bewildered and dignified survivor. Despite the sadness and loss portrayed in this movie, it is a truly heartwarming film. I""m so glad that the producers stayed true to the book and did not try to overproduce this story into a sappy Hollywood blockbuster.",1295654400,2,1092,4.934782608695652

471920,5,6302452929,"When I saw this movie it was just by happenstance. I didn't set out to watch it.  I was just bored and found it on the store shelf. I was so shocked that I had never heard of this movie. Being a Native American from the Oneida and Stockbridge Munsee Tribes I am drawn to movies about Native Americans especially those that are based on fact.  I had never even heard of this person or that anyone like this existed. My first feeling upon starting to watch the movie was of feeling cheated. Wondering why if this story was out there our teachers in school never used it to ""enlighten"" their students etc. Then as the story unwinds I found myself extremely sad.  I cried at the end because it all felt so surreal.  Even to this day when I think about the movie, the story of this man, I feel lost.  Stories like this make you wonder what life is all about and how fleeting life is.  We're all here but a second then we're gone. Will we leave a legacy of any substance? Hmmm still points to ponder. I guess I felt cheated because Ishi's life did matter to someone, but that most of society will never know of him or his tribe. At times like these the world seems soooo big and lost.  I wish Ishi's life story  was made available to young people while they are in school.  And in that regard I will no doubt buy a couple of copies to distribute to the local schools in my area.  And just maybe we can spread a little knowledge about the indigenous people of these United States. Our culture has almost been swallowed whole by the cultures that moved in, it's nice to know that someone cared enough to put pen to paper and detail Ishi's life. Thanks to all who wrote the book and those who decided to make it into a movie.  I also, want to point out that the movie left me wanting a lot more. I feel like you should go ahead and watch the movie but then buy the book so that you can delve into the real person Ishi was. A movie a little less than 2 hours does not do Ishi's life justice...",1229212800,29,1983,4.138020833333333
471921,5,6302452929,"In the early 1900's, one of the last of the free-ranging Indians is caught raiding a slaughterhouse for food.  It turns out, he's the last of the Yahi tribe.  Dr. Alfred Kroeber (Voight) befriends the man who they name Ishi (Graham Greene).  Kroeber refuses the offers of the BIA, the last of the ""Wild Indian"" branch, who offers to repatriate Ishi to Oklahoma and a reservation.

The story's a strongly moving tale based on a true-life event.  This is perhaps Voight and Greene's best acting to date.  If you can see this and not be moved to tears, your heart is of iron.

The movie is also powerful, and allows the viewer to see the perspective and dilemnas that anthropologists faced (and still face), and also allows the viewer to see Ishi's perspective and world view.

Another good film is the documentary, ""Ishi, Last of the Yahi"".  Both are great for older kids (middle school and up) studying US or California history.",1175299200,10,520,4.681318681318682

471952,5,6302452929,"This movie has great historical value, especially for the State of California.  The story of Ishi is one everyone should know.  He was the LAst of His Tribe and just came walking out of the bush one day.  No one even thought there was any of his tribe left and he taught us all a great deal about a people that had been wiped of the face of the earth.  The acting in this movie was great and if you are a fan of Ishi then this is definately a movie you want to see.  If you are a fan of History, see it as well.",1163030400,28,511,3.7830188679245285
471953,4,6302452929,"very interesting. i didn't know the story. the movie is interesting though there are slow moment in the plot where we get a little bored. but overall it's full of emotion and i love the final scene when the doctor sings for Ishi so he can find he's way to heaven... really nice! John Voight is quite right in the part of the rigid professor and i always loved Graham Green (Dances With Wolves, Thunder Heart, etc.)...",1151884800,10,417,4.428571428571429
471954,4,6302452929,"""Last of his Tribe"" is a satisfying, sweet, & good, (if not great) movie.  It is the simplified (& slightly fictionalized) account of the last Yana Indian nicknamed, ""Ishi"" by A. Kroeber (an early anthropologist at U.Berkley).  It accurately portrays Kroeber's struggle to keep emperical distance from his subject as his love & friendship grew for this stoic, kind, and generous man.  It is based upon the (second-hand account)  book written by Kroeber's second wife Theodora (also an Anthropologist) over a decade after the events.  A. Kroeber never published anything about Ishi- and even quit Anthropology for a few years after Ishi's death, so distraught was he over his friend's death, and the perception that they had killed him by working him too hard (Ishi died of tuberculosis 3 months into Sapir's linguistic analysis).  The film is sensitively acted by experts (Jon Voight, Graham Greene, David Ogden Stiers).  The sets & details are reasonably accurate , but  even when they could translate Ishi's stories, songs, & explanations literally, they could often not make sense of them- lacking the cultural background knowledge & the Yahi's conception of the universe/ time.  The film takes some unnecessary liberties with the story (**No mention of translators E. Sapir or Indian S. Botwi** Ishi was more involved with the community- playing with local children, dating, etc.** what stunned Ishi most was crowds- he had never seen more than about 60 people together in his life** Dr.  Pope was one of Ishi's main advocates/friends & not weird & insensitive **  Kroeber was able to go on sabbatical in Europe [not work at a NY museum] b/c Sapir was working with Ishi...  You'll cry at the end.  Read T. Kroeber's book, "" Ishi in Two Worlds: A Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America"" and the dvd documentary, ""Ishi - The Last Yahi"".",1142035200,85,1850,4.967532467532467
471955,5,6302452929,"Every time i start to wonder ""whatever happened to Jon Voight?...""I discover another gem like The Last Of His Tribe. Graham Greene (one of my all-time favorite actors) connects with his usual manly grace with Jon to make for a very convincing performance. This is a ""period"" video...1911...and the set design, costuming and language are all very well done.",1023235200,22,356,5.0508474576271185
471956,5,6302452929,"This film is a must see for many reasons, primarily because it documents the very end of the ~15,000 year legacy of free Native Americans on this continent: ""Ishi,"" the last Yahi and free ranging Native American is forced by circumstance to enter modern civilization in the early 20th Century in California. The historical significance alone makes it worth seeing.

Beyond that, Graham Greene and Jon Voight give outstanding and moving performances. Greene (who is always excellent - Clearcut, Thunderheart, Dances With Wolves, etc.) as Ishi, and Voight as the genius anthropologist who takes him in.

Voight's character is a pure scientist through and through who finds it difficult to get emotionally involved with much of anything. He prefers to look at the world in terms of evidence and hard data. He is distant as his wife is dying, and Ishi tells him (paraphrasing) 'you put me in your book, but not in your heart.'",1016409600,183,922,4.941935483870968

7826462,3,6302452929,"The film is a very important film for what it depicts, but it is not as respectful as it could be in handling these subjects.

Learning about the genocide of a people is never a pleasant thing, but for an American made film to bring to light the effects of the American genocide of native populations is a much needed change. The film took an anthropological and historical stance on why Ishe was important. They saw him as this last artifact to be researched of a culture that white men had killed. The last surviving Yahi was poked, proded, and exploited by the same race that had killed his entire family.

The film does fall into some racist tropes, with characters showing off just how racist they are with their treatment of Ishe. The doctor in particular is so open about how little he knows or cares about Ishe outside of what he can gain from it. At least the curator wants to help Ishe become a part of history.",1481587200,,921,4.411764705882353
