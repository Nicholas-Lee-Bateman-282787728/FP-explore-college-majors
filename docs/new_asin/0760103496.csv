7802223,3,0760103496,"The audiotape I had for ""Bible Break"" was worn out. The video arrived quickly. It is as shown on the video on TV. Just wish the tape was still available. I really enjoyed using it in children's ministries for the children to learn the books of the Bible. I am happy that the video is available...just wish it was more like the audiotape. .",1446163200,,339,4.3125

Was so glad to find it here, as my 6 year old is learning the books of the Bible in our homeschool lessons. He is doing great learning them, thanks to this fun video!",1289779200,,320,3.8636363636363638
7802225,5,0760103496,If you can find a copy of this get it!!  My 3 year old learned the OT and NT books of the Bible by watching this video.  It has a very catchy repetitive tune that makes it so easy to learn.  He is now 7 and no longer watches it but still knows all the books in order.  Too bad it is no longer available.,1222992000,,303,3.6153846153846154
