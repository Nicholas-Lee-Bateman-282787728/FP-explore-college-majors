5971602,5,B00F9F4DX6,i like fairy tail. this one had so much heart and feeling in it. A great work is always measured in that. the story and plot and conflict. was great as well. a true work from the fairy tail world. hope you enjoy.,1388707200,,212,3.953488372093023
5971603,5,B00F9F4DX6,"The movie itself is something I've come to expect from Japanese movies based on existing anime and manga (such as the Bleach and Naruto movies): one time characters, awesome opening and closing songs and some of the best action battles not found in the original anime. And ""Fairy Tail the Movie: Phoenix Priestess"" is no exception. I loved Fairy Tail and started my collection with the first DVD released by FUNimation.

A major warning: This film takes place after a 7 year timeskip in the timeline (a point that FUNimation has not yet dubbed as we are on the ""Edolas Arc"" now) so there will be some key characters and changes that you might not understand unless you read ahead to the point where Japan currently has the story. Anyway, the film is about Team Natsu (and later the other wizards of Fairy Tail) joining forces with a beautiful young maiden named Eclair and her partner Momon to stop a attention grubbing king of a tiny kingdom from unleashing a phoenix sealed away in an ancient stone that's been split in two. It can only be released if both halves are reunited, which this evil tyrant and his hired goons, the Carbunkle guild, are out to do....unless the Fairy Tail wizards have something to say about it!

This movie is full of the kind of humor you would get from ""Fairy Tail"", such as Juvia's obsession with Gray, Natsu's motion sickness....and even a shortly lived moment where Natsu and Gray both see Lucy completely naked! So if you love the humor and story telling that Fairy Tail can do, this film is for you. Just remember my earlier warning and you should be fine. It also features an undubbed ""prologue"" special that shows Eclair and Momon's first meeting and life before meeting Fairy Tail (that of which I don't understand why FUNimation didn't dub it, seeing as they dubbed the film).",1388620800,6,1816,4.654205607476635
5971604,4,B00F9F4DX6,"This is a movie that is watched over and over by my granddaughter who knows what good anime is, which is more than I do.",1388534400,,120,3.84
5971605,5,B00F9F4DX6,"If you haven't seen this I suggest you get it (either pre order the english version here or get used to reading subtitles). It's like watching a mythic multicultural hodge podge, at least that's how I feel when I watch it. The character's are great and the english voice acting is fantastic, I can't get enough of Natsu(Todd Haberkorn) and have taken interest in a lot of his other work since I fell in love with this, thanks for an awesome show and keep up the good work guys and gals!",1387152000,,486,4.351648351648351
5971606,5,B00F9F4DX6,"Fairy Tail. Such a fun and wild series. First warning. The movie takes place after the seven year time jump. So for most of the content. You need to see at least to box 8. There are some characters you will need to know. I will spoil. But 7 and 8 will take care of most of it.

Ok. Movie review. Ling story short. Buy this movie. Anime films from big series generally suck. Bleach. Naruto. Dbz. Just don't hold up. Why. Because they release one to about every year to two years. They stink.

This is the first fairy tail movie. And it rocks. The production values are high. The art work is crisp. The plot is dark and complex. It is not a throw away ending. It is a real one. Again no spoils.

This is a fantastic movie. But you need to be to at least box 6 to keep up. Enjoy",1386979200,3,775,3.9870967741935486

5971608,5,B00F9F4DX6,"Streamed this on Funimation's website. Awesome movie! Action was great, humor was good and the pacing didn't just feel like a 3 or 4 episode arc covered as a movie, but as a feature-length all its own. The animation looks a bit different when compared to where the series is now on Blu-ray in NA (~ Episode 80), but it's a welcome change and Erza is as awesome as ever! Definitely recommend to all Fairy Tail fans, and for those wanting a sample of the series!",1386633600,9,460,4.3604651162790695
5971609,4,B00F9F4DX6,"I was able to have my copy the day before the release date. The blu-ray case was black with no reversable cover. In the movie, the animation seemed different, but the picture was still crystal clear. The other bad thing was that the ending was very sad (I'm not telling you what happened though). Other than that, it was an entertaining anime film. I saw the Japanese version on youtube one time and decided to buy it anyway.",1386547200,,425,4.461538461538462

5971612,2,B00F9F4DX6,I love fairy tail but this movie didn't do them any favor though I can't say I hated all of it looked great acting was 100% and a lot of love was put in this move but it wasn't great,1489104000,,182,3.575
5971613,5,B00F9F4DX6,"Hilarious, heartwarming, and inspiring the people around the world with the beloved characters of Fairy Tail, showing the true meaning of friendship. I cracked up laughing in so many parts. I bought the movie through Best Buy and the day that it arrived, I was so excited, but I was a little bit unsure how it would take place. Because as we all know some movies aren't as great as the T.V. series. I took a chance, and fell in love with the characters all over again!

The one issue I had was in the T.V. show it did not reveal all the girl parts, nor does it show blood...I suggest to rate the movie, PG-13, because it shows practically everything in some parts. Other than that, I couldn't be more pleased!",1488412800,,709,4.371212121212121

5971619,5,B00F9F4DX6,After seeing this movie for the first time i found to be amazing. Going i didn't know when it took place but it is clear after seeing it that it takes place after the seven year gap and before the tournament.

5971670,1,B00F9F4DX6,"As a FairyTail fan of the manga and anime, I gave this a shot since I found it for $10.  Man that was ten bucks to much.  This was so hard to watch.  Nothing creative, just a black and white story of bad guys do bad things, here come the good guys to save the day.  This just felt to me no creative writing went into this at all.  Just a marketing ploy on the Fairy Tail story to capitalize on a movie.  I don't think I could've even enjoyed this if I got it for free.  I've found that ALOT of the anime movies based upon long running shows are either hit (rarely) or a HUGE miss (often).  This missed so badly it went into my eyes and stung me.",1439769600,,645,3.8702290076335877

5971673,3,B00F9F4DX6,While  I love fairy tail and this wasn't my most disliked story arc it was definitely in the bottom 3. It may have been the time frame they had to work with for it to be considered a movie but the whole thing feels rushed. I'm glad I watched it because of my love for the show but I doubt I will watch it again anytime soon with so many other great arcs to choose from.,1435104000,,369,3.8552631578947367
5971674,5,B00F9F4DX6,Fairy tail is an anime that can be enjoyed by almost everyone. This movie is more serious than the TV series which is light hearted and fun to watch.

I love this anime and the manga! The movie is no exception, but what can you expect when the very writer of the series helped create the movie? Its a wonderful movie with great characters and fantastic animation!

5971733,5,B00F9F4DX6,"However, though this is still the best TV show out there, this movie seemed to have a rather overused plot. I think I remember watching a pokemon movie that had an almost Identical plot to this. On a note to new viewers, you shouldn't watch this before finishing the Edolas Arc.

In Summary, Lucy Heartfilia is walking to the guild in a sad mood because of the last job the strongest team failed. As she is trudging her way to the guild, she passes Eclair- a anti-social stone-bearer. This stone that Eclair bears is the plot of the whole movie.
  Lucy brings the food-deprived Eclair and her... flying talking chicken (surprise right? who would have guessed a talking animal in Fairy Tail?) to the guild, where they are fed. Eclair eventually reveals to the guild what she thinks the stone she has laced around her neck means (she has amnesia so her memory is hazy the whole movie).
To avoid spoilers, I'll stop there. But don't think this movie won't have enough action for you! Throughout the 2nd half of the movie, a new guild to the show sends its strongest team to do everything in their power to capture Eclair. Between some heavy guns magic, new requips, telekinetic wind magic, and an assassin with a walking armory, Fairy Tail will have their work cut out for them in a climatic battle to save the world from a spell that has the power of numerous nuclear weapons.",1397779200,2,1374,4.554655870445344

This movie is a must-have if you are a Fairy Tail fan, especially if your favorite character is Lucy. There is an interesting little prologue story, which Funimation never bothered to dub for some reason, but it doesn't matter, both the Japanese and English versions are equally good. The art style is beautiful, the voice acting is masterful, and I got it for a very reasonable price.

Deep Discount has never let me down. I recommend them whenever you are looking to buy a DVD!",1395532800,12,559,4.480392156862745

5971737,5,B00F9F4DX6,I've watched all 175 episodes if fairy tail and it is my favorite anime and show and i was a little worried that this movie would turn out like a Naruto or DBZ movie but after watching this movie I loved it but I did not care for Happy's design in the film. And after watching it on blu ray I was stunned on the display and the output the Hiro Mashima put into this film.,1394064000,,371,3.8947368421052633
5971738,3,B00F9F4DX6,"The story is great, but very sad. My biggest problem with the movie are the inconsistencies in animation style and the spoilers. It looks a little like a Studio Ghibli project, which is pretty but completely different from the Anime. The colors weren't as vibrant, the style was different, and some characters were drawn completely different - I found out it's because I'm in the US and we're behind in the Anime series. Also, because I'm in the US, there were a lot of spoilers in the plot so I was a little disappointed having them sprung on me in the movie. Further, Erza and Natsu were noticeably useless. They didn't have a good fighting scene at all in the entire movie. It's like their fighting capabilities regressed to being non-existent. Once I'm caught up in the series, I'll turn the movie back on to see how it fits in the series, but right now I don't know if I'll watch it too many times.",1393718400,4,903,4.4787878787878785
5971739,3,B00F9F4DX6,I really like the regular series a lot but at least to me anyway this movie didn't seem as good it didn't flow right and the ending was way to over dramatic (some spoilers here) as Lucy just met Eclair who turns out to be 400 yrs old and will die when the Phoenix monster is destroyed as she has its blood in her which makes her immortal but Lucy doesn't want her new friend to die (who does right!) except in this scenario the Phoenix monster is out to destroy the world and everybody in it and Eclair's long dead father invented the way to destroy the monster and their really isn't any other choice but to do so but they had Lucy crying like this was the love of her life that was going to die even tho Eclair said it was alright as she didn't want to live forever away what I really thought was kinda dumb was if the monster destroyed everything and everybody that would mean that Lucy would die and Eclair would live that would kinda hurt their friendship don't you think!! I don't know I just think this movie could have been better it was O.K.,1393545600,,1050,4.177339901477833

For the rest of us, even a casual fan like me, will likely find it kind of ""meh"". It isn't a bad movie by any means, there is a nice story behind it, and the animation is decent. But, at least for me, it never really did anything to stand out from the crowd. Only a few of the characters really seemed to get a great amount of depth to them, and even when they did it never seemed substantial or enthralling. Overall, if you want to try it go ahead but don't put your expectations too high.

Note: this takes place after the 123 episode of the series, so there are very minor spoilers",1391040000,9,685,4.0
