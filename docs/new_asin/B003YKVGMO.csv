4230296,5,B003YKVGMO,"This film is a great masterpiece.  Despite the nominal subject, Klaus Barbie, the ""Butcher of Lyons"" during the occupation of France by Germany during World War II, it delves deeply into a much broader subject.  Master filmmaker Marcel Ophls, so unpretentiously and with a mastery of English, German, and French, takes us back in time to the days when the Gestapo Headquarters in Paris was at the train station--Hotel Terminus--still standing with its moniker in the 1980s.  He follows through interviews with famed French Nazi-hunters the Klarsfelds, to Barbie's bodyguard in South America, to Germans associated with the Germanization of Bolivia...around the globe, the story of the lowly Barbie from childhood to trial as a War Criminal in France in the 1980s is told masterfully--even with an occasional note of sardonic humor.  Could it be otherwise?
This is a spellbinding four hour, twenty eight minute documentary, which won the Oscar for Best Documentary film in 1988.  Yes, it rings as true 16 years later as it did then, perhaps even more so!  It is as timeless a documentary as Leni Riefenstahls ""Triumph of the Will"" documenting the aspirations of the Third Reich itself.  Interlaced with Barbies story, Ophls hangs out in pool halls with ""everyday"" Frenchmen, hears their opinions, visits Barbie's childhood home where the high school he attended has no institutional memory of him, to the mountains of Bolivia where even the uniforms of the President and his minions are reminiscent of Hugo Boss's designs of uniforms for the Third Reich...
This is a fascinating trip through the Western World of the 20th century that, in my opinion stands the test of time as one of the best on the personalities of the Third Reich. The legal problems facing Jackson at Nuremberg reappear in the 1980s as Barbie is finally, after many years, extradited back to France although his whereabouts are known.  France struggles to deal with its own complicity, the failings of its own legal system...and in the days to come, we will see this drama re-emerge in the post-Iraq War II.
Barbie re-emerges as a brutal man, though ill in late life, and the witnesses bring him to life.  The Jewish children, hidden in the countryside, whom he deported to Auschwitz are heard from once again.  A deported Jew is but vaguely remembered by an apartment-house neighbor.  The stench of Evil remains, even in the prevarications of common bureaucrats.
Although not rated, this film is not appropriate for pre-teens, and should be seen by teenagers and young adults only when the context can be discussed with informed adults.
Had Marcel Ophls produced no other work, and this one obviously took years, it would have been enough.
Although repeated many times, those who do not learn from history seem bound to repeat it.  Globally, we're not doing very well, as it would seem so aptly demonstrated here.",1077408000,33,2883,4.995824634655532

8409546,5,B003YKVGMO,"""Hotel Terminus"" took the Best Foreign Picture award when it first came out, probably because of its generational impact with the participants alive. It deserves the award and should be viewed by those who want to know about war effects on both sides. I am glad that you can see a French film that utilizes the hotel and other known spots of resistance fighters, some seen in this documentary. One multi-Resistance fighter, Michel Thomas (an alias) seen for a couple minutes late in the documentary has his war story in print (""Test of Courage"") and it should be read by others. He's the gentleman who perfected his language theory while working for the Nazis (briefly) then the Italians, then the French teaching himself in 3 weeks to learn the language while escaping death several times. (a protegee, Dustin Hoffman) The other war survivors from both sides tell their stories, sometimes in a surreal fashion. What makes this documentary a bit out-of-date is the numerous stories that have come out from courageous Germans since who risked it all to save Jews inside Germany, which almost makes up for the non-belief of Germans close to the death camps or the many collaborators who paid the ultimate price for their exchange. Again, the U.S. looks the other way about its dirty revelations instead of altering its security policies. What other U.S. leaked breaches of principle will be discovered soon?",1414972800,2,1405,4.9576271186440675

8409548,5,B003YKVGMO,Klaus Barbie DVD Hotel Terminus. I gave this rating of 5 stars and I will not add anything else to that rating. This additional REQUIRED paragraph is ridiculous and a waste of my time.,1399680000,,184,4.4411764705882355
8409549,5,B003YKVGMO,"I had seen this at an art house movie theatre when it was released several years ago. It affected me deeply. What this evil little man, Barbie, could do in his little corner of power is breathtaking. But, what is even more breathtaking is what Mrs. Klarsfeld did to him. It took her many years but she was like a dog with a bone. She was relentless.

The film is so well done and the story so well told. It is hard to watch but it is even harder not to watch. Make the time to watch this film. It will touch you as few others have done.",1310774400,3,536,3.962962962962963
8409550,5,B003YKVGMO,"This is one of those documentaries that make history, as few do, because of their interviewing real victims and protagonists of the facts. The facts are basically the Holocaust, the tortures, killings and persecutions of Jews of France by German Nazis and its French anonymous collaborators... everything focused on one person, the notorious Gestapo agent Klaus Barbie.

Remember that 1000 people massacred doesn't reach as much to the heart as one person tortured, with a name and last name to identify. Well this documentary does this job. We, the audience, can hardly appreciate -sitting in the comfort of our free Western societies, decades now away from those terrible times- the value of a document like this one. The film starts at Barbie's birthplace, family circle, etc. and moves, in four hours, to his trial at old age in France. Like a detective story it traces his life through family members, victims, people who met him and people who just might have been his neighbors, knowingly or not. What I mean is, regardless of the film being wonderfully directed and entertaining, this film has a value that makes it priceless. Here is a picture of society, made up of all kinds of people (it is France and Germany, but it is rather about the Homo Sapiens), and it shows how all humans fail to live up to what we expect of others than ourselves. If not guilty of some heinous crime, we might fail because of collaboration; if not by collaboration, then by omission of help; and if not by this, then maybe by throwing the stone at someone whose shoes we are not in. We all fall short.

This documentary is priceless. We are liable to do it again, right here today, in the West. We are already, in fact: don't we ignore the crimes that dictatorial regimes and Muslim loonies perpetrate to thousands every single day, specially to women? We are not the Resistance; we are collaborators.",1296172800,20,1890,4.759146341463414
8409551,5,B003YKVGMO,"Just a short note. It has taken years for this film to be released on DVD and it might be wise, if you like this film, to go ahead and pick up the companion film, ""The Sorrow and the Pity.""",1291852800,10,189,3.75
8409552,5,B003YKVGMO,"With the recent NYTimes article on Nazis in the US, it seems (always?) the right time to understand that ""Germans"" are not the problem. The verbs TO LIE, TO DECEIVE can be conjugated in a variety of languages, from German to Spanish, without forgetting French and English.
Worth the time and money investment!
Ranks with ""Shoah"" and ""Night and Fog"" as one of the films to watch regarding the relevance of the Holocaust today.
