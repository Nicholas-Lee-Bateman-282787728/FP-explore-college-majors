8496608,3,B006CT835M,I was looking for a bit more but this shows terrain and a few views of what you could encounter.  Like the dog...it seemed to know where it was going since it was always outfront.,1372723200,,179,4.114285714285714
8496609,1,B006CT835M,My wife and I love the A/T. However this video was so bad we chose to return it and loose money then throw it away. There was no information the background music was awful and the footage was shaky. The movie made me sick on multiple levels.,1344902400,,241,4.148936170212766
