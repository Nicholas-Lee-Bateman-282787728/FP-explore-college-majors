Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

Two for the Seesaw is very heavy. Its one of those movies you watch once, appreciate the acting, and never want to see again.

Robert Mitchum is getting a divorce, and in 1962, thats not a common occurrence. He picks up a loose dancer at a party, and in their mutual loneliness, they become really close really fast. Behind the scenes, Robert Mitchum and his leading lady Shirley MacLaine had an affair, and you can see the hurt and romance smoldering off the screen. Both actors do a fantastic job and handle a depressing script with realism rather than melodrama. Maybe its because I knew theyd had an affair, but when they argued in the film, I almost felt embarrassed watching it, like I was intruding on a private argument. Its very powerful.

However, its a downer. It was based off a play, which is usually a clue that its going to be depressing, and it absolutely is. Back in 1962, it wasn't common to make a movie about the highs and lows of one couples relationship, as it is now. So, if you watch it, try not to compare it to its contemporaries and appreciate it on its own. Also, make sure you're in the right mood; if you're just coming out of a breakup, wait a while before renting it.",1498435200,2,1261,4.380341880341881

8738011,4,B0172K6TV4,"In 1958, TWO FOR THE SEESAW was a hit two-character Broadway play by William Gibson that starred Henry Fonda and Anne Bancroft.

The movie version, released in 1962, featured Robert Mitchum and Shirley MacLaine, had a screenplay by Isobel Lennart and was directed by Robert Wise.

Mitchum plays a lawyer from Nebraska who has come to New York after splitting with his wife of twelve years.  Lonely and not sure what he wants to do with the rest of his life, he goes to a party in Greenwich Village where he meets MacLaine, an eccentric dancer from the Bronx and, in short order, they begin a lengthy romantic relationship that, because of their diverse backgrounds, is destined to fail.

Though a bit dated, TWO FOR THE SEESAW remains a touching story that works, primarily because of the romantic chemistry between the two stars, which, according to rumor, also extended off-screen.

Lennarts screenplay opens up the play a bit, adding a few peripheral characters and allowing cinematographer  Ted McCord to deliver some stunning black-and-white images of New York City.  However, despite their noble efforts, one cannot escape the fact that, as entertaining as the movie might be, it remains a filmed stage play.

Kino Lorber has provided a crisp edition of TWO FOR THE SEESAW on Blu-ray.
