2967078,4,B000WDVNMO,One of the best gay latino themed comedies I have seen in a long time. Great believable cast. Plot is clever and not overly gay (campy) Well done. One enjoyable film from start to finish.,1198713600,,187,4.371428571428571
2967079,5,B000WDVNMO,"In ""East Side Story"" (2006), Diego is a culinary school graduate who feels trapped working in his family's old-school Mexican restaurant in the East Los Angeles bario.  Diego is also gay, but closeted from his family, and dating the even further closeted Pablo, a status-seeking realtor.  When Diego is inadvertently ""outed"" by his aunt, Pablo decides he has to avoid him, and begins dating the aunt, pronouncing his secret affair with Diego as ""just a phase."" Meanwhile, Diego meets a gringo couple who moved in across the street, among the many gays who settled in the area to ""turn it around"", angering many of the current Latino residents.  One half of the couple, Wesley, takes an immediate liking to Diego, which sets his partner, Jonathan, into a jealous hissy-fit. Diego's grandmother returns from a month-long trip to Mexico, to find her restaurant being boycotted by homophobic locals, while her daughter is making wedding plans with her grandson's former male lover!

It is a refreshing and highly amusing romantic comedy, presented by a talented cast of mostly newcomers.  With a pollished look that belies its relative low budget, it's a noteworthy first-time writer/director credit for Carlos Portugal, one that received audience awards at several gay movie festivals.  It is sexy without being overt, funny without being cartoonish or stereotypical, and the emotions portrayed can be related to by anyone, gay or straight.  The DVD extras include deleted scenes, director and actor commentaries.  Don't miss this one:  five joyful stars out of five!",1197849600,10,1564,5.199203187250996
2967080,4,B000WDVNMO,"""East Side Story"" demonstrates effectively that a gay-themed film can be smart, funny and meaningful--just give it a credible story line, decent direction and professional actors.  This film has all of that plus the desirable (maybe too often required?) hard bodies and handsome faces.  The scenario has already been well-summarized by previous reviewers, but I will add, that I thought the intelligent interplay between the two communities involved here--the East LA Hispanics and the eastward moving, gentrifying gays--was especially credible.  Both sides come in for more or less gentle satirizing, but humanity shines through and the film delivers an enjoyable, feel good ending.
Well worth the time and purchase price.",1197763200,5,723,5.554545454545455
2967081,4,B000WDVNMO,"I loved the film when I saw it at the San Francisco L/G Film Fest, and I still love it. I'm very disappointed that they didn't choose to make it available in anamorphic widescreen, though: on my 16:9 display, it has black borders on all 4 sides.",1197676800,,245,4.23404255319149
2967082,4,B000WDVNMO,"Fresh young talent and a healthy dollop of enthusiasm serve as the springboard of this well written (Carlos Portugal and Charo Toledo), well directed (Carlos Portugal) and well acted exuberant story of those once perceived tightly closet doors of the East Los Angeles Hispanic community.  Not that this is the first film to engage the topic of being gay in East LA - QUINCEA&Ntilde;ERA is another superb film on the subject - but it addresses so many other aspects of family and social life happening now that it deserves a wide audience. With a cast of newcomers coupled with some very fine veterans of the screen EAST SIDE STORY comes to life in a highly entertaining fashion.

Closeted schooled chef Diego Campos (a fine debut by Ren&eacute; Alvarado) works as a waiter in his grandmother Sara's (elegant Irene DeBari) little Mexican restaurant where grumpy homophobic chef Don Rogelio (Luis Accinelli) presides in the kitchen.  Diego dreams of opening his own restaurant but family ties keep him grounded.  Diego's campy Aunt Bianca (Gladise Jimenez) returns from Monaco on one of her many expensive sojourns to find a man and changes begin to happen.  Diego's equally closeted boyfriend Pablo Morales (David Ber&oacute;n) has been refusing to settle down in a relationship with Diego, claiming that the union is a 'passing fancy'.  When Bianca enters, Pablo's attentions turn to the sexy lady and Diego is brokenhearted.

Into this m&eacute;lange enters a white gay couple who buy a 'flip' house across the street, a signal to the neighborhood that gentrification is just around the corner.  The couple - Wesley (Steve Callahan) and Jonathan (Cory Schneider) - meet the morose Diego and a match strikes between Diego and Wesley.  Jonathan is assigned all the lines having to do with prejudice and is the one who wants out of the neighborhood as soon as their house is enhanced and their gay friends begin to visit.  The white couple move apart and Wesley and Diego begin a courtship dance  that is encouraged by Diego's family.  How Diego handles his loss of Pablo to his Aunt Bianca and copes with the possibility of being open with Wesley forms the story line.  It is all the hilarious and not so hilarious sidebars that share the space of the 'outing' that make the film so personal and successful.

Carlos Portugal is clearly a talent to watch, as are his attractive and talented cast members.  EAST SIDE STORY is a fine companion piece to QUINCEA&Ntilde;ERA and should enjoy the same degree of popularity for all the same reasons!  Grady Harp, December 07",1197504000,25,2565,4.916473317865429
2967083,5,B000WDVNMO,"Just watched this movie with my partner of 11 years and we both loved it!. This is the kind of gay movie that need to be made.

2967084,5,B000WDVNMO,"I just saw this last night with an audience and everyone loved it. There was a lot of laughter as well as involvement with the fun cast of characters. This film is a lot of fun and avoids so many cliches seen in gay movies, Latino movies and romantic comedies. The cast is flawless and really knows how to deliver the humor without making it seem ""jokey."" I had a great time seeing this film.",1194480000,33,392,4.24
2967085,4,B000WDVNMO,"Well done gay film that touches upon such universal themes as homophobia, racism, family, and of course, love.  Well directed and acted, the film follows a Latino's crash course in love in the gay world.  A slight of hand drama heavily punctuated with humour, I found this to be a very enjoyable, and for the most part, realistic portrayal of life, love, and gay culture.

A  lot of people will say that this is just a very entertaining film.  What a lot of men will not realize, is that this is a small window or view of Hispanic life and loves, yes, with comical asides.  I can view this film over and over, and its overall message, without ever getting bored.  Hispanic culture adds a degree of emotion that is very difficult to explain unless you have  experienced it first hand!  LOVE, TRUE LOVE, IS A FORCE IN NATURE THAT WILL NOT BE DENIED!  NJMJr!

2967104,5,B000WDVNMO,"Portugal couldn't have done a better job in treating the subject of homosexuality. With a fast-paced story he wove into the plot all the relevant aspects of homosexuality and its effect on one family. All the real-life characters were there, the out and proud [Wesley], the out but in the closet out of fear of homophobes [Diego], the self-hating, homophobic homosexual who pretends to be heterosexual, but gets some on the side [Pablo], the self-hating homosexual who thinks he's found a ""cure"" [the two men who end up leaving their wives and running off together], the virulent homophobe [Diego's cook], the person who loves and accepts a gay family member [Diego's grandmother], the woman [Bianca] who's deceived, her hopes dashed by the self-hating homosexual [Pablo], and even the problems that arise in an openly gay relationship [Wesley's insecure, deceitful boyfriend], they're all in there portrayed in a heartwarming family story about people doing the best they can at their level of understanding. And the acting couldn't be better. The casting was great. And the plot never slows down. It's a page turner.",1405123200,,1118,5.148351648351649

2967107,4,B000WDVNMO,It is a great love story about seemingly very real people some of whom happen to be gay. It is not the only topic in the movie. But it is the most important one that matters to the people involved.,1394496000,,197,3.95
2967108,5,B000WDVNMO,"Great movie, lots of fun!! The film examines being Latino and Gay,  a combination that is difficult in a culture where being different has no place.

2967111,4,B000WDVNMO,"I liked this film. It is not intense but I wanted to see Diego happy in a relationship because he expects his first gay relationship to lead to a ""home and kids"" relationship as many men have, and Pablo is the jerk that many of us have run into in our journey; he gets what he wants and moves on. The cultural reactions by the Latino community to gays is interesting. Wes plays the racist well. The fact that everyone seems to live happily ever after is ok.",1377475200,,457,4.204545454545454

2967123,3,B000WDVNMO,"This is a charming low-budget film about gay romance and jealousy set in a Latino community.  The community's response in the story is by no means uniform -- both acceptance and rejection are represented.  Bigotry is strong, but so is love, according to this story, and characters are shown standing up to bigotry.  The title ""East Side Story"" is a misleading take off on ""West Side Story."" This is not a musical, and it is not set in New York.  The tension here is not principally between Latinos and Anglos, but between gays and some straights and between the out and the closeted.  The film is about 90 minutes long, and the disc includes an interesting interview with the filmmaker, in which he talks about various scenes, casting, directing, and film making technique as most of the film runs again.",1327968000,,804,4.714285714285714

However, through questioning himself he realizes that there can be a solid realtionship with the one man who truly loves him as he does in return. I feel that the movie was well done and takes a look at many angles of coming out and looking for a solid relationship.  Excellant movie.

2967130,4,B000WDVNMO,"""East Side Story"" has the feeling of a home-made production which is almost standard for TLA releases.

Anglo homo's are moving in and gentrifying the neighborhood to the concern of many folks. Bianca (formerly Blanca) breezes in from Europe and everything is in place for the free-for-all.

It was interesting, and frustrating, to watch the back and forth nature of the plot: Two characters get together...break up...back together... There is some tension between one GWM (a twink from Mississippi) and a hilarious moment with an AA group meeting in his house. Even with the predictability of the plot several characters grew on me, notably the sister who I was ready to kill at the beginning and hug at the end.

Give me a brake, what Gay man (especially a Mexican Gay man)really looks like that or acts that way?  It is no wonder that gay and straight men grow up with such problems as to the way they look.  In addition, I feel that this type of movie creates more danger for gay teens' self-estem that any bigotry and discrimination that straight society can dish at them.

2967136,3,B000WDVNMO,"This is a fun, but heavily flawed, movie.  It's charming as eye candy, and the story is light and amusing enough that it certainly passes the time favorably.  But sometimes the comedy is too broad, the characters have crossed the line from believable to not, so the entire film suffers as a result of a screenplay and director who needed to take a heavy handed approach, or at least needed to know what the target was.  Was the film meant to be a light-hearted romance, or over-the-top nonsense?  We've got both here, and that means we've also got characters of little depth.

The villain, and I am referring to the live-in parter, one third of the romantic triangle that has developed, has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and is of so little appeal overall that one can't figure out how he's managed to have a faithful, devoted, good guy lover for two years.

We open with an over-the-top homosexual-hating chef who is nearly frothing at the mouth, who after being fired by the part-owner of the restaurant who is himself gay (almost angelically gay, in fact, we nearly envision him with a halo, he is so perfect), the dying chef places a curse upon the place of business with his final words.  After that, either because of the curse or more likely the owner's being an outed gay in a neighborhood culture that is vehemently anti-maricon (so to speak) the business starts to fail.

The owner might be more upset about this except he has other worries: his one-time real estate agent lover who has just rejected him after the ""I love you"" words is now dating his young and vibrant aunt, determined to stay in that closet forever, and out angelic hero is now newly attracted to one half of the gay couple who has just moved in across the street.

The couple across the street are an unlikely pair, if merely because one is so straight-acting, he doesn't seem gay at all, and he seems unaware of the true character of his partner (a deleted scene clues us in even more to how bad the guy is), which means he is not overly bright, yet otherwise seems intelligent and sensitive.  The other half of the pair is a snob from Mississippi (that has to be meant as a joke; it's such a contradiction) who isn't very bright but whose best friend is also his letching wealthy boss - but at least these two talk the same language.

The aunt is a real hoot and steals the show.  She is vitality plus, and is the one who goes through the greatest amount of character growth through the paces of the film.  From a globe-trotting, social-climbing ""Blanca who has changed her name to Bianca"" we see her begin to own up to her responsibilities to her family and her heritage.  In a gay romance story, it's the female who owns the film.

Obviously we're touching on racism and homophobia, and a Mexicana strong cultural vocal rejection of homosexuality.  We also have self-loathing types, both the real estate agent who is striving to pass as straight, and a woman who is self-loathing as to her heritage, who obviously wishes she'd been born anything but Mexican, as Mexican probably means she can only rise so far in class, and no more.

Some hot kissing scenes, and definitely good-looking male leads, but nothing too explicit.  Just randy, hot guys looking for love and finding their place at the end.  If they are all just a bit two-dimensional and cliche, I guess we can live with that.",1217808000,5,3375,4.576411960132891

Worse, most of the gay characters exist only for cheap laughs at their stereotyped behavior. It's idiotic. One more thing: In a genre where the DVD jackets bear little resemblance to reality, this one takes fantasy to a new level. The flick's skin quotient is fine, but it's nowhere near as much as the jacket indicates. On the plus side, Rene Alvarado does a nice job, considering a poorly written script that has him alternating between sulking jerk and the perfect boyfriend. (Having said all that, I'm a sucker for any gay romance film, so there were enough threads to make it worth a look -- assuming you rent it rather than buy it.)",1209772800,,805,4.597222222222222
2967139,4,B000WDVNMO,"Very few low-budget films are worth watching that deserves recommendation to friends.  It's rarer to find/view films that addresses or contains gay Latinos.

Diego is a waiter/chef, who is stuck, by familial obligation, working for his grandmother's small Mexican restaurant.  In addition, Diego has to deal with the homophobic head chef, whose rantings increase as more and more gay people are moving into the neighborhood.  Diego wants to leave and pursue his dream of opening his own restaurant but his grandmother insists that he stays.

His life is pretty much monotone, including occasional trysts with Pablo.  Diego wants to announce their relationship but Pablo doesn't see himself as gay.  Pablo just enjoys an occasional man-to-man ""bonding"".

However, things change when heart-broken (& broke) Bianca returns home from Monaco.  The grandmother suddenly takes off to her homeland for a visit, entrusting Bianca to help out Diego at the restaurant.  Pablo dumps Diego for Bianca, who soon abandons helping out Diego.

Meanwhile, a new gay couple, Wesley and Jonathan, has moved into the neighborhood.  Well, actually, they came to flip a house, which they'll move on to a new project.  Wesley is truly interested in the neighborhood and tries to get to know Diego.  Jonathan is a stereotypical character who thinks lowly of Latinos and is irked that Wesley is friendly with them, especially Diego.  The different treatments of Latinos soon put their relationship to the test.

3201576,5,B000WDVNMO,"In ""East Side Story"" (2006), Diego is a culinary school graduate who feels trapped working in his family's old-school Mexican restaurant in the East Los Angeles bario.  Diego is also gay, but closeted from his family, and dating the even further closeted Pablo, a status-seeking realtor.  When Diego is inadvertently ""outed"" by his aunt, Pablo decides he has to avoid him, and begins dating the aunt, pronouncing his secret affair with Diego as ""just a phase."" Meanwhile, Diego meets a gringo couple who moved in across the street, among the many gays who settled in the area to ""turn it around"", angering many of the current Latino residents.  One half of the couple, Wesley, takes an immediate liking to Diego, which sets his partner, Jonathan, into a jealous hissy-fit. Diego's grandmother returns from a month-long trip to Mexico, to find her restaurant being boycotted by homophobic locals, while her daughter is making wedding plans with her grandson's former male lover!

It is a refreshing and highly amusing romantic comedy, presented by a talented cast of mostly newcomers.  With a pollished look that belies its relative low budget, it's a noteworthy first-time writer/director credit for Carlos Portugal, one that received audience awards at several gay movie festivals.  It is sexy without being overt, funny without being cartoonish or stereotypical, and the emotions portrayed can be related to by anyone, gay or straight.

This film has all of that plus the desirable (maybe too often required?) hard bodies and handsome faces.  The scenario has already been well-summarized by previous reviewers, but I will add, that I thought the intelligent interplay between the two communities involved here--the East LA Hispanics and the eastward moving, gentrifying gays--was especially credible.  Both sides come in for more or less gentle satirizing, but humanity shines through and the film delivers an enjoyable, feel good ending.

3201579,4,B000WDVNMO,"Fresh young talent and a healthy dollop of enthusiasm serve as the springboard of this well written (Carlos Portugal and Charo Toledo), well directed (Carlos Portugal) and well acted exuberant story of those once perceived tightly closet doors of the East Los Angeles Hispanic community.  Not that this is the first film to engage the topic of being gay in East LA - QUINCEA&Ntilde;ERA is another superb film on the subject - but it addresses so many other aspects of family and social life happening now that it deserves a wide audience. With a cast of newcomers coupled with some very fine veterans of the screen EAST SIDE STORY comes to life in a highly entertaining fashion.

Closeted schooled chef Diego Campos (a fine debut by Ren&eacute; Alvarado) works as a waiter in his grandmother Sara's (elegant Irene DeBari) little Mexican restaurant where grumpy homophobic chef Don Rogelio (Luis Accinelli) presides in the kitchen.  Diego dreams of opening his own restaurant but family ties keep him grounded.  Diego's campy Aunt Bianca (Gladise Jimenez) returns from Monaco on one of her many expensive sojourns to find a man and changes begin to happen.  Diego's equally closeted boyfriend Pablo Morales (David Ber&oacute;n) has been refusing to settle down in a relationship with Diego, claiming that the union is a 'passing fancy'.  When Bianca enters, Pablo's attentions turn to the sexy lady and Diego is brokenhearted.

Into this m&eacute;lange enters a white gay couple who buy a 'flip' house across the street, a signal to the neighborhood that gentrification is just around the corner.  The couple - Wesley (Steve Callahan) and Jonathan (Cory Schneider) - meet the morose Diego and a match strikes between Diego and Wesley.  Jonathan is assigned all the lines having to do with prejudice and is the one who wants out of the neighborhood as soon as their house is enhanced and their gay friends begin to visit.  The white couple move apart and Wesley and Diego begin a courtship dance  that is encouraged by Diego's family.  How Diego handles his loss of Pablo to his Aunt Bianca and copes with the possibility of being open with Wesley forms the story line.  It is all the hilarious and not so hilarious sidebars that share the space of the 'outing' that make the film so personal and successful.

Carlos Portugal is clearly a talent to watch, as are his attractive and talented cast members.  EAST SIDE STORY is a fine companion piece to QUINCEA&Ntilde;ERA and should enjoy the same degree of popularity for all the same reasons!  Grady Harp, December 07",1197504000,25,2565,4.916473317865429

However, through questioning himself he realizes that there can be a solid realtionship with the one man who truly loves him as he does in return. I feel that the movie was well done and takes a look at many angles of coming out and looking for a solid relationship.  Excellant movie.

3201626,5,B000WDVNMO,I saw this movie on tv and enjoyed it.  I liked this movie for its authenticity.  There are parts that are very lighthearted.

It is a well written film and the cast is excellent.  It's actually a very believable story.,1242432000,,411,4.426666666666667
3201627,4,B000WDVNMO,"""East Side Story"" has the feeling of a home-made production which is almost standard for TLA releases. The quality of acting is so so at best (and mostly uneven) and it is the story that either saves or kills the effort. ""East Side Story"" fortunately has a plot which should keep the viewers (gay viewers most likely) interested.
Diego works in a family restaurant owned by his grand-mother Sara. He is gay but he believes that nobody knows about it except his closeted lover Pablo. He is obviously wrong. His affair with Pablo goes sour when he refuses to continue playing his friend's erotic games. Fortunately, his neighbourhood begins to change and as a part of the change a gay couple moves next door.
Pablo makes an attempt to turn straight and marry Diego's crazy aunt Bianca/Blanca but Diego stops her short of taking the vows. In the meantime Diego starts falling for his neighbour Wes but Wes moved in with Jon who only dreams of leaving the barrio and cashing in on the house price increase (remember it's 2006!). In the process Diego changes his restaurant into a fashionable haunt for the newly gentrified neighbourhood and Wes sends Jon away and... See for yourself!
If you can't find the title on the list of Academy Awards nomination (let's not set our hopes too high...) it's not by chance. This is just a feel-good movie with little ambition. But sometimes it's good to have a few of them handy.",1239753600,2,1413,4.678714859437751

3201629,4,B000WDVNMO,"Set in east LA about a gay Latino man, Diego, and his coming out who has hidden furtive encounters with Pablo, a successful real estate broker who lives in denial and loves roleplaying. Anglo homo's are moving in and gentrifying the neighborhood to the concern of many folks. Bianca (formerly Blanca) breezes in from Europe and everything is in place for the free-for-all.

It was interesting, and frustrating, to watch the back and forth nature of the plot: Two characters get together...break up...back together... There is some tension between one GWM (a twink from Mississippi) and a hilarious moment with an AA group meeting in his house. Even with the predictability of the plot several characters grew on me, notably the sister who I was ready to kill at the beginning and hug at the end.

The movie could have used a better lighting engineer, there were many scenes that were difficult to see because low light was ill aimed. However, it wasn't a deal breaker.",1237334400,,968,4.825301204819277
3201630,1,B000WDVNMO,"Although I try to avoid Gay Cinema at all cost because it is usually terrible, I decided to get this movie due to the fact that I saw on a rating that it had four and a half starts.  What a bunch of crap and waste of time this is!  Geez, can you put any more Mexican and Gay stereotypes in this instulting and derrogatory movie.  Give me a brake, what Gay man (especially a Mexican Gay man)really looks like that or acts that way?  It is no wonder that gay and straight men grow up with such problems as to the way they look.  In addition, I feel that this type of movie creates more danger for gay teens' self-estem that any bigotry and discrimination that straight society can dish at them.  In conclusion, if you really want to exercise your mind and feel proud about being Gay or a member of any minority, then watch a creative and well-done movie such as ""Milk"" and skip this garbage.",1233446400,3,889,4.230769230769231

There was nothing new or exciting about this film. I had high hopes for it, and the worst part was the boyfriend of the neighbor guy who was completely over acting his stereotype. It was gross.

3201633,3,B000WDVNMO,"This is a fun, but heavily flawed, movie.  It's charming as eye candy, and the story is light and amusing enough that it certainly passes the time favorably.  But sometimes the comedy is too broad, the characters have crossed the line from believable to not, so the entire film suffers as a result of a screenplay and director who needed to take a heavy handed approach, or at least needed to know what the target was.  Was the film meant to be a light-hearted romance, or over-the-top nonsense?  We've got both here, and that means we've also got characters of little depth.

The villain, and I am referring to the live-in parter, one third of the romantic triangle that has developed, has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and is of so little appeal overall that one can't figure out how he's managed to have a faithful, devoted, good guy lover for two years.

We open with an over-the-top homosexual-hating chef who is nearly frothing at the mouth, who after being fired by the part-owner of the restaurant who is himself gay (almost angelically gay, in fact, we nearly envision him with a halo, he is so perfect), the dying chef places a curse upon the place of business with his final words.  After that, either because of the curse or more likely the owner's being an outed gay in a neighborhood culture that is vehemently anti-maricon (so to speak) the business starts to fail.

The owner might be more upset about this except he has other worries: his one-time real estate agent lover who has just rejected him after the ""I love you"" words is now dating his young and vibrant aunt, determined to stay in that closet forever, and out angelic hero is now newly attracted to one half of the gay couple who has just moved in across the street.

The couple across the street are an unlikely pair, if merely because one is so straight-acting, he doesn't seem gay at all, and he seems unaware of the true character of his partner (a deleted scene clues us in even more to how bad the guy is), which means he is not overly bright, yet otherwise seems intelligent and sensitive.  The other half of the pair is a snob from Mississippi (that has to be meant as a joke; it's such a contradiction) who isn't very bright but whose best friend is also his letching wealthy boss - but at least these two talk the same language.

The aunt is a real hoot and steals the show.  She is vitality plus, and is the one who goes through the greatest amount of character growth through the paces of the film.  From a globe-trotting, social-climbing ""Blanca who has changed her name to Bianca"" we see her begin to own up to her responsibilities to her family and her heritage.  In a gay romance story, it's the female who owns the film.

Obviously we're touching on racism and homophobia, and a Mexicana strong cultural vocal rejection of homosexuality.  We also have self-loathing types, both the real estate agent who is striving to pass as straight, and a woman who is self-loathing as to her heritage, who obviously wishes she'd been born anything but Mexican, as Mexican probably means she can only rise so far in class, and no more.

Some hot kissing scenes, and definitely good-looking male leads, but nothing too explicit.  Just randy, hot guys looking for love and finding their place at the end.  If they are all just a bit two-dimensional and cliche, I guess we can live with that.",1217808000,5,3375,4.576411960132891

3201635,1,B000WDVNMO,"This lame take on ""West Side Story"" -- substitute gays and Latinos in East L.A. for ""whites"" and Puerto Ricans in NYC -- is predictable almost from the opening scene. Worse, most of the gay characters exist only for cheap laughs at their stereotyped behavior. It's idiotic. One more thing: In a genre where the DVD jackets bear little resemblance to reality, this one takes fantasy to a new level. The flick's skin quotient is fine, but it's nowhere near as much as the jacket indicates. On the plus side, Rene Alvarado does a nice job, considering a poorly written script that has him alternating between sulking jerk and the perfect boyfriend. (Having said all that, I'm a sucker for any gay romance film, so there were enough threads to make it worth a look -- assuming you rent it rather than buy it.)",1209772800,,805,4.597222222222222
3201636,4,B000WDVNMO,"Very few low-budget films are worth watching that deserves recommendation to friends.  It's rarer to find/view films that addresses or contains gay Latinos.

Diego is a waiter/chef, who is stuck, by familial obligation, working for his grandmother's small Mexican restaurant.  In addition, Diego has to deal with the homophobic head chef, whose rantings increase as more and more gay people are moving into the neighborhood.  Diego wants to leave and pursue his dream of opening his own restaurant but his grandmother insists that he stays.

His life is pretty much monotone, including occasional trysts with Pablo.  Diego wants to announce their relationship but Pablo doesn't see himself as gay.  Pablo just enjoys an occasional man-to-man ""bonding"".

However, things change when heart-broken (& broke) Bianca returns home from Monaco.  The grandmother suddenly takes off to her homeland for a visit, entrusting Bianca to help out Diego at the restaurant.  Pablo dumps Diego for Bianca, who soon abandons helping out Diego.

Meanwhile, a new gay couple, Wesley and Jonathan, has moved into the neighborhood.  Well, actually, they came to flip a house, which they'll move on to a new project.  Wesley is truly interested in the neighborhood and tries to get to know Diego.  Jonathan is a stereotypical character who thinks lowly of Latinos and is irked that Wesley is friendly with them, especially Diego.  The different treatments of Latinos soon put their relationship to the test.

Replace Italian culture in Montreal with Latino culture in East L.A. and you've got the jist of it. For those of you who struggled with acceptance from your non-Anglo families and the pressures around machismo for men and generally negative perceptions of LGBT folk, this story is for you. The only flaw in the script is the one dimensional character of the white boyfriend who is so racist. We all know people who say this stuff about other races, in closed company, but it's drawn a bit broadly when he says it in front of the main character. But then again, I've seen some pretty stupid/racist fags in my day, so it's plausible that this happens. It just didn't ring true for me in either the screenplay or the performance.
