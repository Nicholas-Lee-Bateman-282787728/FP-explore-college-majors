8642661,1,B00IJSDKR0,"I bought Making Off because it's French and France has become a reference when it comes to horror films and because it is compared to A Serbian Film. Nonetheless, it does not match French flicks like High Tension or A Serbina Film. Basically, this film has no plot at all. For the aesthetic you might think the director was aiming more at an ""August Underground"" kind of film, and maybe it may meet the expectations for the fans of this sort of films, but if you are looking for a story or some psychological elements, this is not the film for you.

Talking about the gore, Making Off has got some pretty creative killings and gory bits but if I gory you mean that the murders are totally shown on camera, you might get disappointed as well. To sum up, Making Off is not a horror film with a story or a really explicit gore film that has the aesthetic of ""August Underground"". If you like this film you may like Making Off. If you didn't and your'e looking for a smart and disturbing film, you may try A Serbian Film or American Mary instead",1421798400,,1041,4.338461538461538
8642662,4,B00IJSDKR0,"All the reviews here are great! Yes the movie lives up to its expectations. Just to let you all know, the dvd does gave subtitles. Not sure about amazon streaming though..",1417910400,,171,4.548387096774194
8642663,4,B00IJSDKR0,"This movie was difficult to watch, and for good reason. The premise was solid, the acting good enough,but it was the SFX that really made this movie shine. Some of the deaths looked so realistic, I paused the movie half way just to make sure that this wasn't an actual snuff film. Overall, I think France makes the best horror films in the world, and I feel that this is a great addition to that claim. If you like found-footage, good acting, and disturbing effects, this will be right up your alley. Nice job!",1417478400,,510,4.4361702127659575

8642665,4,B00IJSDKR0,"So as I'm writing, July 3, 2014, early evening, Amazon is streaming this French film WITHOUT SUBTITLES. I happen to have three years of classroom French, but that was three years ago, but still I decided to carry on watching it, and discovered that my French listening comprehension is basically gone. Never really there, to tell the truth, but I digress. Basically, assume I understood not a word that was said; I still enjoyed it in that guilty, queasy way that torture porn is supposed to evoke in its viewers. It's the story of Cdric Dupuis*, DIY filmmaker with the goal of basically creating the worlds greatest movie in a one-off with no budget. He reminds me a little of friends I used to have in Europe who studies film. They had an awesome knowledge of film and film theory, but they were so laden down with ideas that when they actually got a commission to do a film they over-analyzed everything, and broke friendships over the issue of whether a crayfish could stand in for a lobster in the movie's final scene. Except Dupuis doesn't get locked up in his head. He gets violent. He's always flying off the handle, and has a talent for pushing buttons. In the very first scene, after his long and rambling introduction, he gets into a fierce yelling match with his girlfriend. And then a few days after he begins shooting his film, he murders his girlfriend with a hammer, on camera. Then he starts murdering his cast. And the creepy thing is, the murders not only relax him, but unleash his creativity. He films himself raping and mutilating the bodies, and edits these sequences in ways that are at once depraved and ingenious. He even performs a ""header"" on one of the bodies, for fans of the movie by the same name, and if you don't know what I mean by a header, you will by the end of this movie.
The publicity boast that this movie surpasses A Serbian Film has to be a joke at some level. It's the sort of thing that the character Cdric Dupuis would say about his film once he realized there was a market for it after all.

*Okay, so get this. Cdric Dupuis is the name of the guy who directed and wrote this movie, but the character of him is played by a different guy, one Oliver Bureau. Curious! It reminds me a little of Charlie Kaufman and Adaptation. If you love that movie, and, well, can stomach torture porn, you might just enjoy this!",1404345600,,2359,4.460648148148148
8642666,2,B00IJSDKR0,"It compares itself to the ""Serbian Film""...NOT CLOSE...the only reason I gave it 2 stars was cuz the main guy was so off the wall he was somewhat entertaining...gore was so fake it was a joke...only watch it if it goes on Prime for FREE !!!",1401321600,2,240,4.239130434782608
8642667,2,B00IJSDKR0,No subtitles! Couldn't understand a word. Why are there no subtitles. Probably would have liked it if I could understand it.,1400976000,3,124,4.9523809523809526
8642668,4,B00IJSDKR0,Great for gore hounds!!! The movie itself is not amazing but is not terrible by any means either. Pretty much found footage style. Definitely up there with Olaf ittenbach with the gore. Quality of the film is much better than any of olafs films. Serbian film? Not quite. It is not as effective but there is probably more violence. Overall I liked it a lot. Don't watch with unsuspecting viewers. It will not feel good when they are looking at you strangely for watching this guy !!!spoiler alert!!! Kill and have sex with everyone (or everything) he meets. Just a warning lol.,1399852800,,576,4.6568627450980395
