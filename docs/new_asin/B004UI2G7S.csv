And I am reading his book, The End Of The Age, which I don't read books, but there was something about this book of his I wanted to read it. And so I also ordered Miracles Beyond Measure, as I believe that God does give us miracles, as in 2009 the drs told my daughter they wasn't anymore that they could do for me as i was in pretty bad shape in ICU , the dr said that it was between God & me weather or not I would live, well 5 years later, and I am still here. So I know that God gave me a miracle!!",1399248000,,566,3.6859504132231407
