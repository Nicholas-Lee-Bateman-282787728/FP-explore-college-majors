1184662,3,B000005PDX,"I was just a little disappointed with this DVD.  First, the introductions are way too long!  It takes a while to actually start the workout.  Second, the music is not the Golden Oldies I expected.  And the workout is more exercise than dance which is more what I expected from Richard Simmons.  That said, it is a good workout, and it is fun to see the parents of different movie stars.  Plus, the DVD really gives you a lot.  Not only is there the workout with Richard Simmons, but then you have workouts led by the Silver Foxes.  At 58, I think this DVD is a little ""tame"" for me, but I use it when I'm not feeling very energetic.",1128124800,68,632,4.208333333333333

1184670,5,B000005PDX,"I waited a year for this to become available on DVD on Amazon!
 My mother is 72 and diabetic. She doesn't like to exercise and always makes some excuse. She loves Richard Simmons from ""back when we used to do aerobics"".  I surprised her with this copy. It's simple to follow along with, low impact, but effective. There's a warm up, aerobics, and cool down plus a section on toning/stretching using a high-backed dining room chair. The graphics on screen make it simple to check your heart rate at beginning, mid way through, and at the end. They flash a chart of heart rates and age groups up so you can check if you are at your target heart rate.
I like that it's got great swing music playing; that the celebrity seniors are often off step or behind step (not professional, perfect dancers), that the steps are simple and repeat, and that Richard is wearing a sweatsuit not shorty shorts.
Very glad that I bought it, it's perfect.",1418601600,8,933,4.514792899408284

1184688,5,B000005PDX,I borrowed this DVD years ago from a video store and used it again and again. I couldn't buy it in Australia then. It is so good particularly as I never have to get down on the floor! Just loved seeing the parents of the hollywood stars working with me.  I need this level of fitness exercise even more now but just can't come to grips with the $67 price tag. Surely this is not correctly priced! Fix it and I'm back for my own copy. Please!,1350604800,,441,4.068965517241379

1184693,5,B000005PDX,"I purchased this item for my 80 year old mother in law. She really enjoys making use of it on her old VCR. Her and her friend groove to the tunes and get in some age based workouts that are a lot of fun. So, if you're still hanging onto that old VCR and want a workout that works for an older body, this is for you.",1255132800,2,315,3.716417910447761
1184694,5,B000005PDX,I really enjoyed this exercise Video with RichardSimmons and the Silver Foxes. It is a great for seniors and those who are just starting an exercise program.

1184695,5,B000005PDX,"For someone like me who's been sedentery for wayyyy too long, this video was perfect to get me started.  So many of the videos I've tried seem to be geared toward someone who's already fit, and they're either too hard to keep up with, or I'm too sore afterwards to try again.  If you're used to working out and being active, you probably won't like this one, but if you're like me and looking for something suited for an absolute beginner, this works great!",1235433600,4,457,4.428571428571429
1184696,4,B000005PDX,"This DVD is perfect for seniors who need to get the blood pumping.  If you have vision problems and cannot take walks outside (for fear of tripping over broken sidewalks) or are just fearful of going out alone to get some exercise, this is a perfect way to exercise in the privacy of your own home.  It beats being a couch potato and with this DVD, you feel as if you are attending an exercise class with your peers.  I would definitely recommend this wonderful DVD.",1205539200,5,466,4.395348837209302
1184697,5,B000005PDX,This DVD is great for those people that can't do arobic exercise. Like people with back surgery or joint replacements. It is energic and fun and a very good workout,1203033600,5,164,4.5
1184698,4,B000005PDX,This is a great program for people who haven't exercised for a long time or who have some health issues that keep them from activity that could hurt or scare them. It is great for me who doesn't have time or desire to get sweaty during the day but needs to move. My sister who is in a wheelchair could attempt the movements from the chair and her co-ordination improved significantly over even a few days. It also made her feel good to be able to do it (from her chair or on the floor).,1202860800,4,486,4.126315789473685

1184700,5,B000005PDX,"I am in my early 60s and in good health with the exception of having arthritis in my joints, mostly my knees. During the winter months I'm much less active than spring and summer.  I felt like I wasn't doing anything to get my heart pumping so I ordered this DVD.
When I was received it I watched it while sitting on the couch, just observing.  I remember thinking, this is a piece of cake and won't do anything for my heart.  Boy was I wrong!  It's such an easy workout but after ten minutes I began to feel my heart pounding.  I've kept up the program every day during the week and always feel better when I've completed the whole DVD.  It doesn't take very long, maybe 25 to 30 minutes.
I love watching the people and Richard is very inspirational.  It's such a fun tape.  If you can walk and swing your arms you'll be able to benefit from this DVD.  I highly recommend it.",1201737600,8,876,4.197604790419161
1184701,1,B000005PDX,"Not happy with this DVD at all.  Was very disappointed in its content.

1184702,5,B000005PDX,Since I'm used to exercises that are more demanding this workout is so nice for times when I don't feel like moving around but gets me going anyway.,1200787200,4,148,4.321428571428571
1184703,1,B000005PDX,"I am 65,100 lbs overweight, diabetic with high blood pressure and I hate any form of exercise including walking on the even the most lovely day.  I started this DVD this week and love it. The exercises are not too hard or too long or too fast. I can do it and feel encouraged to stick with it.  If you are a exercise nut, even as a senior, this probably isn't for you, too easy BUT for a beginner like me it is HEAVEN. This is one that I will stick with which is amazing for me.  I only wish there was a part B for when I have gotten more in shape.  Thanks Richard.  Please do more for seniors, you have the touch.",1199491200,15,614,3.9193548387096775

1184706,2,B000005PDX,We bought the work out CD because we had a tape of the first one.  the second work out is a total washout.  The first silver foxes is a good buy and a good work out.  It is too bad thet the second workout is so poorly thought out.  My wife and I think it is a wast.,1173312000,3,265,3.5172413793103448
1184707,5,B000005PDX,I purchased this DVD as a replacement for a VCR that has been used for years with a group of seniors at our church.  They love it.  It is gentle and yet works all areas of the body.  Those who have consistently attended the sessions are in great health & condition.  Most of them are in their 70's.,1171929600,13,298,4.086206896551724
1184708,5,B000005PDX,I really enjoyed this exercise program. Richard Simmons really does a good job. If you haven't exercised in a while or if you're a senior this is a excellent dvd. I'm using it for my church exercise class which targets 50 and up. We used it today for the first time and everyone liked it better than anything else we have used. It's not so fast that someone older can't keep up and it's not so slow that it's boring for someone younger. Everyone also commented on the background music and how much they liked it. I thought it was paced just right and I'm 48 and have been active all my life. I also enjoyed exercising with my Mom who is 70.,1171584000,29,640,4.211382113821138
1184709,5,B000005PDX,"I knew what was on this DVD when I ordered it, still it was more satisfactory in this form than my old VHS tape.

1184711,4,B000005PDX,"First, Simmons wears a sweat suit, much better than the tank top and shorts of his other stuff. The pace isn't so fast that you can't figure out what's going on or keep up. If you haven't worked out in a while, it's a way to get moving again. It gets the pulse up but isn't so bad that you think you are going to die. Also none of this no pain no gain and feel the burn nonsense. The excerise part is about 40 minutes, including 20 of cardio. You should know (cause these things never tell you) that you should have at least 8 by 8 feet of room. You can do it in less if you take small steps. You also need a tall back chair with no sides. Although I made do with a sort of tall back office chair with arms. I was pleased that I didn't aggravate my chronic shoulder and back problems.",1157587200,94,784,3.9371069182389937
