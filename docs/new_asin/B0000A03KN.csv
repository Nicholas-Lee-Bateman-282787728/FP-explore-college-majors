7994910,1,B0000A03KN,"Two of the cartoons were great.  The others were just about unwatchable.  I don't mind filth if it's witty but a lot of the material here was vile beyond belief and just not funny!  I'll have to hang onto this for the 2 good animations but that's it.  So, it's NOT a good value for the money.  They put these things together just this way.  You see that a lot.  A couple of keepers and then the rest is just trash that has no business out in the public and are worthless.  Unfortunate.",1489276800,,485,4.139784946236559

7994912,2,B0000A03KN,"""God hates cartoons"" and you will too. The animators could have done the dishes or mowed the lawn or sat outside, but noooo they made this mess. Stay away your not missing a thing.",1413504000,,180,4.323529411764706
7994913,5,B0000A03KN,"Not cartoons for kids, that's for sure!  But, being a filthy adult, I loved this selection of ridiculous cartoons.  I have always been a Tony Millionaire fan, and R. Crumb, but this selection exposed me to other artists, too.",1402876800,,225,4.743589743589744
7994914,3,B0000A03KN,"There are some good cartoons here along with some mediocre / bad ones. My main issue is the dvd does not have 55 minutes worth of cartoons, or over an hour as stated on the dvd publisher's website. Its got about 35 minutes of cartoons total, and a few comics panels to browse through.",1287532800,2,284,4.277777777777778
7994915,5,B0000A03KN,"God Hates Cartoon? Does it really hate cartoon? This DVD makes me want to make my own cartoon after watching it. If you like DIY cartoons, this one is pretty good. I buy it because I want to just piss off god even more. Now is your turn.
by the way, there are eastern eggs hidden if you are lucky enough to find out.

Also check out ""The Naked Cosmos"" DVD. They are also wonderful.",1138060800,,381,4.08
7994916,3,B0000A03KN,"The Maakies episodes are great, as is the Woodring film, and the Kaz shorts are okay. But if it wasn't for those, I'd rate this one star, because the rest ranges from lame to absolute rubbish.  Seriously, some of them are jaw-droppingly unfunny.

Rent, don't buy.",1137024000,3,263,4.695652173913044
7994917,3,B0000A03KN,"This project is a real bold effort, and although some of it didn't do much for me, honestly, the stuff on it that DID was pretty gutsy. Its amazing what one can do with the resources we have, thanks to the modern miracle of Flash software. The cartoon industry should take a cue from this (and the ""Triplets of Belleville"")
the Walt Holcombe cartoon alone makes the DVD worth buying.
I only hope that this is a primer for a follow up from Bright Red Rocket that will be even better.......",1084320000,,488,4.373626373626373
7994918,5,B0000A03KN,"I've read Sam Henderson's cartoons for a while now, and got this DVD mainly due to a recommendation from a friend. Oh sweet God! Some of these cartoons are just the funniest, most offensive cartoons I've ever seen! Don't expect Disney when you watch these. Expect the kinds of things you's see in Spike and Mikes Twisted Film Festivals that make old ladies gasp. We put this DVD on during parties and everyone goes nuts. The Tony Millionaire MAKKIES cartoons are great as well as THE COURTSHIP OF SNIFFY LAPANTS by Walt Holcombe (a very sentimental favorite). But by far CAT HEAD THEATER by Tim Maloney was my favorite. Also, with cartoons like DIAPER DYKE AND CAPTAIN BOYF... ...how can one go wrong?",1066694400,2,701,4.7073170731707314
7994919,2,B0000A03KN,"I recently bought this because I love the work of Tony Millionaire, Kaz, and Jim Woodring.  It was neat to see them all, but at less than an hour and no ""extras"" I feel kind of cheated (although I shouldn't say that since I pretty much knew I would feel that way, but I HAD to see it.)  It's almost like watching the old MTV show Liquid Television (I was heartbroken when that show stopped airing).  Maybe rent it if you can find it at any store.",1066694400,3,446,4.103448275862069
