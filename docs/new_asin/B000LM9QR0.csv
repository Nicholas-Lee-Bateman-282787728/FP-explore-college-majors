8162207,3,B000LM9QR0,"IHF have done the best that they can with existing material here; the picture quality is good but the sound is distorted. The first IHF release had what could be termed 'motor noises' on the soundtrack and  IHF's attempts to remove them led to an intrusive 'hissing' sound, particularly noticeable during the first forty minutes or so. They've really tried with this edition but it falls short and it's not their fault.

The bonus documentary 'Panzer Greifen An' is a truncated version of the original and the picture quality is  poor. The short film ends abruptly, missing over twenty minutes of footage. Not good.

'Sieg I'm Westen' is standard war documentary fare and gets boring and repetitive in just the same way as the Allied war documentaries. Tanks rolling off into the distance, infantry firing at the unseen foe, bombs, explosions and marching men tend to get tedious. As I've said, in exactly the same manner as films like 'Tunisian Victory' and 'The True Glory'. I'm in no way belittling the sacrifice of men of all nations during WW2 but the oft quoted  anecdote that war is 'long periods of boredom interspersed with short periods of terror' seems to ring true here.",1498176000,,1182,4.8316831683168315
8162208,4,B000LM9QR0,Neat piece of history. A lot of footage that I had never seen before. Only downside is that the 'Panzer Greifen An' bonus documentary sucks after the intro by Guderian. The narrator should find a new line of work in silent pictures.,1491868800,3,232,4.5476190476190474
8162209,5,B000LM9QR0,"Audio: Very Good
Image quality: Exceptional (for the era)

Wartime propaganda imperatives such as ""everything must be emphatic or overemphasized (e.g. unrelentingly) and we are on the right side of this issue"" permeate the production...as expected...even being the child of German Armed Forces a.k.a. Wehrmacht.  Having said that, the footage alone, even if there were no audio/subtitles makes this a ""Do Want"" item for me and I'll presume the same for those interested in the 1940 European War that burgeoned into WW2 the following year.

Viewing this documentary cognizant of the fact that its 1941 release was long before the outcome of WW2 was a decided matter as well as that it was distributed globally after having been translated into over two dozen languages, it's a challenge to gauge the extent of its effect on public opinion beyond Germany and the countries it controlled at the time, but something as powerful as this, in that era, certainly had an effect on different levels of societies around the world. To wit: In the special features segment, there's mention of an the German ambassador to Turkey having invited Turkish officials to the German embassy to view a private screening of Sieg Im Westen. The context of the invitation was a British overture to Turkey seeking Turkey's entrance to the war on the Allied side. As the commentary relates, after seeing the documentary, Turkey declined the British offer and opted to remain a neutral.

Negatives: none (not even price)",1482710400,3,1493,5.056910569105691
8162210,5,B000LM9QR0,"Excellent restoration.  Interesting, if skewed, perspective of Germany's initial assaults in the West.",1482278400,3,102,6.846153846153846
8162211,1,B000LM9QR0,"Too much behind the lines filming of mundane soldiers routines, staged re enactment river crossings  and  British prisoners, the very few instants of combat filming are from a great distance, and it is impossible to see any thing but smoke in the distance.
There is no explanation of where any of these scenes actually were filmed or what was happening, in what is a remarkable cinematic achievement filmed as a propaganda  Film exercise, not as a Military Training Film showing unit actions.",1454025600,,492,4.975609756097561

Not the Anglo version of facts.",1443830400,2,61,4.636363636363637
8162213,5,B000LM9QR0,Very interesting to see the German side of propaganda. For anyone interested in World War II it is very different dvd.,1393891200,7,118,4.666666666666667
8162214,5,B000LM9QR0,"This is an excellent reproduction of the original film.  There are a few places where the German sound track is not good, but the pictures are clear throughout.  There are also lots of language options so that it is possible to see the original film in the original language.",1353369600,9,275,4.591836734693878
8162215,4,B000LM9QR0,"Long delivery time. Longer than what stated when I made the purchase. The DVD is of perfect quality delivered in a sealed original box. So, no complaints about that part.",1284336000,4,170,4.7
