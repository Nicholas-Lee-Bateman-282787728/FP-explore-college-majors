7357626,5,B012P5MHO4,Wow!! This movie left me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Great delivery by the cast and fantastic story development by the writer/director. Indeed they slipped the surly bonds of earth. I highly recommend this film.,1452556800,5,228,4.725

7357628,3,B012P5MHO4,"Great little Psych test there. I agree. Mindbender! Worth a watch especially if you like Psych thrillers. Not too gory and not The Martian but worth a watch!  No one is sending kids this green up anywhere, I hope, but it isn't meant to be a NASA doc. Warning Spoiler alert!: I thought the days were counting down. So lots of psychotropic drugs involved here. Maybe some Oxygen deprivations levels. I figured the man we all think is the nuttiest figured it out and got to the end of the test first. The man who lost his child came to deal with that loss finally. He had been in denial. So maybe he will be able to go on with training and maybe not. I would tend to think not. These last two I thought she knew all the time and he didn't. Still a possibility since she kills someone in the end. If it was faked that would make sense. She knows. If she really did kill the guy she doesn't know. Obviously she has been given some criteria to stick to that none of the others were aware of. So do they just go up and out at the end? They made the 400 day congratulations message a little fuzzy on the reception so that lets us decide on our own. If it had been clear reception we could easily conclude it was all a test. Because the reception was fuzzy we now have the final test. Maybe a what would you do scenario. I would leave because either it is all a test or they will run out of supplies anyway. So if you go up and it still looks weird outside, be ready to close the hatch fast. Then resolve yourself to the idea that guy #1 is probably on the menu now and guy #2 is just lost mentally or physically or both and save yourselves for a nice kiss and makeup and take your protein pills along with an overdose of something and wait for what comes in the next world.

Is it part of the simulation? You will never know. This movie fails to bring anything together.

There were hints of ""They are doing this to us"", and ""she is in on it"", and ""something really happened"", but none of it is followed to fruition.

""This doesn't make any sense!""

...you'll be saying the same to yourself or whoever you're watching this with...
I had high hopes because [1] isolation experiments are intriguing, [2] it stars Ben Feldman and Caity Lotz, and [3] it masquerades as science fiction.
Ben Feldman was phenomenal in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Men/dp/B013BPR7OC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Men</a>, and Caity Lotz literally kicked butt in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arrow/dp/B00PNNWK20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arrow</a>&nbsp;(she also had a recurring role in Mad Men). If you've taken Psychology classes then you are probably familiar with underground isolation experiments; not to mention, NASA is currently undertaking a one-year experiment with six individuals in a dome to simulate a Mars mission (it began in late summer of this year). I was hoping 400 days would be somewhat realistic, because that would be cool. Nope. They had to make it stupid in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience.

First off, they use Caity Lotz's character as the ex-fianc of another character who goes into isolation with her (?!?!?) [Strike one]. Then they throw in a somewhat brutish man with a questionable psychological profile who predictably scraps with Caity Lotz's ex for the alpha male position [Strike two]. When weird stuff starts to happen, these potential astronauts show how they can't think their way out of a wet paper bag [Strike three].",1449532800,,1589,5.969298245614035
7357633,3,B012P5MHO4,"This is one of those movies where you guess what is actually happening to the characters based on a number of clues or things characters say throughout the movie. Annoyingly this is also one of those movies where when the credits role, you aren't told if your hypothesis was correct or not. If this sort of thing frustrates you, then you may not wish to invest your time with this one. You could argue that a number of scenarios were occurring for our four main characters who willingly go down into a bunker as part of the space program for 400 days. They are told they are training in a simulation of what they will have to do on an actual space journey to (I assume Mars) that will take them 400 days to get to. If individually they quit or aren't successful carrying out their tasks, or as a whole the ship does not make it, they will fail and won't go on the actual space mission. They are told they will be tested with many unexpected hurdles along the way and there are cameras recording Big Brother style everything they do.

The main four cast aren't famous actors (Im pretty sure I haven't seen any of them in anything), which does make the scenario seem more authentic. The biggest names are minor roles and they aren't that big a name either, being Grant Bowler (minor character True Blood) and Tom Cavanagh (main character from the TV show Ed).",1448928000,,1357,4.428

7357648,1,B012P5MHO4,"For once, I'm actually going to give a review of the film itself, not the Blu-ray or DVD quality, though I fully admit that film appreciation is highly personal and subjective which makes my review pointless and superfluous. Thing is, I love science fiction and horror so very much more than pretty much everything else out there that it has to be genuinely horrible for me not to like a science fiction or horror film, and this is both. There are mild spoilers that come from the descriptions posted all over the internet of the basic plot but I'm warning you anyway, to be safe.

So, what you need to know here, prior to watching or, rather, deciding whether or not to watch, is, essentially, this film has nothing to say. Now, we can all enjoy films that have nothing to say. I enjoy mindless entertainment all the time including some of the lesser giallo classics and even the occasional spaghetti western. But, with the great giallo classics and classic spaghetti westerns, the more mindful offerings of those genres I've randomly chosen to use as an example here, when you tune in and find the director very clearly telling you he has something to say so you'd better pay attention, first you pay attention, second you get the message, whatever that message happens to be. Unfortunately, this film stands, in contrast to both the mindless and mindful offerings as is a rare and sad example of bait and switch, as the intention of the writer and director (possibly the same person) is made clear early on in the film and then wholly abandoned for no particular reason.

To simplify, this film appears to have been set up, offered, described and even started off as a bit of a high-brow, a film with quite a lot to say. The basic premise intrigues, to say the least, and is as follows:  testing four potentially space-worthy astronauts in an underground bunker for a period of 400 days in order to gauge their individual and collective potential for long-term, deep-space voyage in the future while simultaneously conducting an experiment in mind-screwing (there's a better word for it that I can't use here) for the ultimate purpose of determining just how much the astronauts can handle. And yet, halfway through the film, for lack of a better description, this basic premise simply falls off, abruptly, with the introduction of a mutant half-zombie man which will have you wanting to slap the writer and director like Cher slapping Cage only harder and possibly more than once, but not more than twice because we are all decent people here.

Basically, the film exists in two halves. The first half, before zombie man, is about the mental challenges, triumphs and impossibilities, of space travel and living in close quarters, in tense situations, for over a year. The second half, after zombie man, will have you asking yourself, ""is this part of the experiment, in which case they've completely wasted the experiment by testing for things that won't happen, with the wrong people to boot, as astronauts won't be living in a bunker if this weird cannibal creepiness post-apocalyptic scenario plays out"" followed shortly by ""is this one of those stupid films where they realized they had nothing to say about the inner workings of the human mind so they turned it outward and told yet another apocalypse story that probably won't even have an ending, as you can't really write a proper ending for a film if you have nothing left to say, can you"". And, in the end, you will be left thinking that you don't really care that, indeed, the film had no ending and that, indeed, the film completely abandoned the original and compelling premise in favor of another weird apocalypse scenario that may or may not even be real but, ultimately, doesn't even matter because you are still thinking about that original premise of testing astronauts in close quarters for 400 days to see how they function.

In truth, most of the opportunities to deal with that core issue are left on the table in favor of the silly diversion of zombie-man and his creepy survivor friends played to varying degrees of acting-class failure by people who usually do a much better job. No. They always do a much better job, all of them. The apocalypse actors are all above the performances they gave in this film, but you can't blame them as they were doing what the director told them to do. Tom Cavannaugh (sorry, I'm still dyslexic and that looks right to me) has never been so hammy. His performance was so over the top that the core cast of four talented actors seemed confused and uncertain as to what they should react to, which takes you, as the viewer, out of the film itself and into the acting class environment of experimentation that this film clearly fostered. Sometimes improvisation is not a good idea, especially when dealing with a very talented actor who is known for his tremendous comedic talent.

The story, again for lack of a better way to put this, simply dies. It never picks back up. It never reaches a conclusion. It is never explained why the people involved in making this film chose to set up a film about exploring the human mind, capacity and endurance, and then chose to switch over to a silly ""what in the world is happening here"" ripped right out of an episode of the original twilight zone, an episode that did it much better and had a full, clear narrative structure.

Unless you know someone involved in the making of this film personally and want to watch this out of a sense of supporting a friend or loved one, this is eminently skip-able. However, if you feel you must watch it, just to see, don't watch it when you need to see something good, to pull you up out of a bad day or difficult work week. Save it for when seeing a terrible film will do you no harm. Good luck with this one, if you opt to move forward on it. It will make you think for about that first half. But, when it stops making you think, it really stops making you think, and you will feel like a Kardashian just walked across the screen and started talking about their shoes. It really does just give up on any attempt at advanced thinking about halfway through. Oh well.... I'll rewatch Snowpiercer now, to purge the bad taste, as it were.",1478390400,4,6226,4.6442831215970966

7357668,5,B012P5MHO4,"People just cannot grasp anything beyond the obvious, which is part of the point of this movie.  The ending is not an obvious or expected conclusion, and that is just as it should be.  I won't reveal the actual ending, but some of this review is a spoiler, so don't read past this if you don't want to know parts of this movie in advance.

First, some say the actors were good, and you know, they were.  My biggest problem with the actors is three of them look like they just got out of high school and astronauts are trained experienced pilots and/or doctorates that have done considerable work in their field.  They don't test high school kids to see if they can handle a mission.  OK, not high school, but much too young.  The I broke up with my girlfriend, boo hoo thing, is just so freaking immature that it made me feel like I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  And the excess alcohol consumption statement and act is also not realistic.  Astronauts portray an image to the nation.  No astronaut would ever say publicly he just went on a four day bender.

So, I decided that I would try to look past that considering the actors are believable and did perform their tasks well.  No demerits for that.

The settings and special effects are all believable.  Many of these types of movies or tv shows fail because they have no idea how to present the scientific environment, showing people frantically typing or under ridiculous pressure to solve some computer problem, and this was more like real life in which there is reaction time, a thought process, decisions.  I liked that.  It did not once distract me from the film.

Without getting into too much detail about why two of the astronauts go missing and why the woman disappears and always comes back, the experiment overall makes sense, except for the ""Wayward Pines"" let's go see what is really happening out there scenes.  While these are key to explaining some of the behavior of the test subjects, the test itself makes no sense.

Here is the spoiler part big time, so stop here.

At the point at which they are trying to decide to exit the test chamber because they do not believe something outside is not wrong, it seemed to me at that point, they would have failed the test.  They exited the chamber before the 400 days was up.  End of story.

To then present what appears to be a staged world confronted by an apocolypse while they are underground is not a real world scenario because they would be in space, not on the ground, so they couldn't just take a walk around outside in the middle of the mission.  If it was a crash or emergency landing on another planet, the presented environment would not have at all been useful as a test environment, because that could not happen.  If the ship came back to earth successfully to have found earth destroyed and the people left behind rather demented, well, let's just say their survival or the ship would not be of much concern other than to ensure it did not fall into the hands of an enemy power.  It would not involve surviving an apocalyptic social event.

However, there are clues that this scene is imagined.  It is obvious that the three men are hallucinating at various points in the movie, and it is possible what they are presented is a stage and the people and things in it are just not real at all.  The two astronauts, for example, see their hallucinations and finally do recognize that they are disjoint from reality, and that is when they disappear.  We do not see those men die.  We are left to determine what happened.

The scenes in which the actual stabbings occur is left a bit to imagination as well.  Could that all have been staged or imagined?  One astronaut earlier had believed he was bleeding from his eyes, pores, mouth, etc. and then it all was just a dribble of blood from his nose after a scuffle.  So, Captain Kid may have just believed he was stabbed, but it did not seem that he was hurt as badly as that big knife would have accomplished in blood loss and pain.  The woman that stabs the Mad Max bad guy just before Captain Kid is stabbed to death does not let you see the wound and you are left to guess if that was all an act.  But when Captain Kid beats the other bad guy to death, that looked pretty real, and that would have been one hell of a hallucination or dream.

Still, if you take it at ""face value"" (pun intended if you get the part at which point the braun astronaut that stomps mice realizes that the woman behind him is from his porn magazines) it was a group hallucination, partially controlled, and perhaps it was left to the imagination of the subjects to form the environment, until it gets to the point they are drawn into their own worlds of fantasy and realize the entire thing is not real.  So, the apocolyptic world may not have been the planned hallucination, it just turned out that was something that the astronauts could grasp and the soil sample experiment done and the hallucination would have jibed with the data.  It was not a realistic scenario, but it would have tested the subject's abilities to grasp reality and to manage a highly stressful and even seemingly hopeless event.

Some believe the ending was ""lazy"".  It was planned and it started half an hour before the end of the movie.  The objective is to leave you in a similar state to the astronauts with whom you have shared the experience, and to leave you to conclude what was real and what was not.  What is certain about the end is, light comes in through the hatch, so the dust is gone.  And the outside world is still there, there is no apocolypse, and the experiment is complete.

So, you can overanalyze it, or just think about it a bit, or watch it a couple of times to ferret out the details, but the movie was well acted, it depicted what could happen in a strange experiment of this kind, and the ending was plausible if you believe that it all was an experiment.  What you cannot be absolutely certain of is why each part of the experiment was done as it was, but even the astronaut wannabes in the experiment don't know that.  They weren't likely to spend the last half hour of the movie explaining it.

The woman is obviously with the outside from the beginning and controlling the experiment.",1468281600,,6256,4.45518453427065

The characters, when not walking cliches, are a bit dumb (asking valid questions... after the whole experiment has already begun instead of before...). And as far as the logic goes, it makes no sense at all. A space program would not make such an exercise with a future astronaut who is just out of prison, hungover and depressed (Superman's character). And it is made clear in the beginning that the whole thing will be over as soon as they open the hatch. Well, they opened it sure enough and went outside to live a surreal adventure which makes no sense with the original mission. How come, then, did they succeeded in the end, having failed by opening the hatch? What about the killings (fake or not)? What about the village straight out of a horror flick? All part of the space program experience? Really? What are they trying to study? And if it's all an experiment in order to see how they will naturally react in a close environment, why would you then trick the subjects by giving them hallucinogens?

It's obvious that they were going for a Twilight Zone sort of story, but I think this movie would have been better if they had made it a half-hour in length or maybe about an hour tops. Especially given that there isn't really an ending to it.

My recommendation to anyone thinking of watching this, is to skip it. Go watch an episode of either Flash or Arrow, something where these actors have something better to do. Or maybe watch the movie 'Idaho Transfer' which pulls off this sort of ending a little better.",1463270400,,850,4.3125

Sure, you may read some reviews that say it's awful, I read them myself. I chalked it up to people that just ""don't get movies"", as I have seen a lot of low rated films that I immensely enjoyed. This movie, however... this movie, I can't even, but, I *have to* warn everyone, I have to warn them to stay far far away from it. There's absolutely nothing redeeming about this movie, except for perhaps the musical score.

As I was watching it I thought, ""boy, they could use a bigger budget for such a high-concept idea."" Turns out, it's a SyFy made-for-TV movie. Well, that explains it. The production is good for whatever hundreds of dollars was spent on it. Okay, maybe thousands of dollars. They do a lot with what little they have to work with. We have a simplistic control panel where three people sit, with some college student's CGI work is put on display. There's a lot of white paint with some black electrical tape, and you've got yourself a very futuristic and clinical spaceship.

The acting is appropriate for the budget level, but omg, Brandon Routh. The look on his face throughout the entire movie says it all: ""Damn, I used to be Superman, now I have to accept low-budget roles to pay the rent."" The look says it all. He doesn't want to be here.

 ""SPOILERS""

And now we talk about the third act. For something to be spoiled, there has to be something *to* spoil. There's nothing to spoil, really. The four faux spacemen go outside to see what happened. They stumble upon a town where people act weird for the sake of being weird (And the main weird man is probably the most convincing actor in the production. He plays menacing to a T). Some catastrophic incident with the moon happened and now everyone's weird. That's the twisteveryone's weird. The people attack the crew, the crew goes back to the ship, they kill the townsfolk. At which point 400 days are conveniently up, and a pre-recorded congratulations on the ship's monitor plays. The end. There you go. I save yourself the awful ending.

The main problem with this movie is the script. It's awful. The dialogue is awful. The story is awful. Direction is awful. It's awful. All of it. I have been in the creator's chair so I don't like to insult other people's good work, but, this should've never been made in the first place. I can only imagine the scenario as to how this got greenlit in the first place. Maybe some schmoozy talker was able to convince an executive or two this was a good idea. Who knows. I just hope the people that financed this learned their lesson.

I am so livid at the *time* I wasted on this, and I feel so strongly to warn people to not watch this. I'm not even trying to be funny, I'm not even trolling anyone, just don't watch it.

I got it...actually it was pretty simple to understand, but that really doesn't help make the movie a great movie, or even an OK movie.

At all.  Sure the film will stop playing after the credits roll, but before that the story just drops completely and the film fades without any kind of conclusion.  There isn't even material in the story to allow one to reflect on what might have happened.

The trailer impressed me but the movie did not.

Plot is 4 would be astronauts 3 men and 1 woman live deep underground 400 days to test isolation and deep space travel.

The director tells them there will be unplanned mission tests they do not know about.

Early on the communication to mission control is knocked out and the place is shaken up.
A test or real, they think it is a test.

The woman medical advisor gives the others shots but you never see her take one. She said it's to protect from viruses.

1 guy sees his kid and draws a crazy map in his room. But the other characters never see the room and the map is not explained?
1 guy imagines blood on his face and a computer screen saying she's poisoning you. But is that a real message possibly from a hacker to tell the truth? That also is never explained.

Both seem delusional. But the other two characters don't experience it.

Someone breaks into the underground facility through a vent and the characters leave the base to explore.
They see the trees gone and testing dust realize it is moon material?
That is never explained.

A later town resident tells them it was a nuke or the moon, it's never explained what happened to Earth?
It looks like a post apocalyptic world and the townspeople or what's left are all creepy looking and so very weird.
It's never exactly explained what happened or what condition the people are in.

Could the director have possibly foreseen the future world trouble and wanted these 4 to survive what would happen? That is never explained.

Could they possible all be having a delusional? But that seems all unlikely as evidence suggests it's all real.

They go to the town and 2 of the crew go missing. They are probably killed but it is never shown on screen what happened to them and it's not a satisfactory conclusion to there story.

They are given food to eat and drink and one of them takes it.

You later see that they are cannibals and someone is locked up.

What was in the drink is never explained.

The guy and girl broke up because the director made her test how it would go. This seemed a unnecessary addition to the movie with no proper payoff.

The woman has a medical hit she should not have and he brings up the topic but that is not explained.

The main town villain gets killed in a fight when he follows them to the base and he sure was no delusion it was real.

The counter hits day 400 and what looks like a prerecording of the director appears telling them they made it.

You see a light by the open hatch.

Nothing in this movie is ever properly explained or given a conclusive ending.

Too many mysteries with lack of proper followup.

Story ideas started with no proper pay off.

All of this made for a waste of what could have been a good movie.",1456531200,2,2817,4.362763915547025

[...]

In support of guest Brandon Routh, I rented the film to see how good or bad it was. After viewing it, I would only state I was disappointed in it. Like others have complained, I'll agree it felt as if 2 different films were spliced together. I liked the first half. But the second half when the crew leaves the underground habitat just did not blend well with the first half. What was puzzling was why a low budget film would decide to film outside when I would have thought it was cheaper to film inside on the single set they built. Honestly wished they had stuck to the crew staying 400 days underground in isolation and show the consequences of ""The Milgram Experiment"" when things go wrong with no contact with authorities.

I would have liked to talk to director Matt Osterman to understand what he was going for in this film. Was he given challenges like mixing multiple genres into a single film? Did he only have 7 days or less to complete filming of all footage before editing it together to make a completed film? Was the final film completed with the original script?Were any actors allowed to change there lines?

I have no complaints with the cast. Fans of ""Legends of Tomorrow"" and ""The Flash"" should recognize cast members from both shows in it. Despite myself not liking the second half. I have to give credit to Tom Cavanagh for making it compelling to keep watching it. My disappointment is with the script and the open ending that just was such a let down to myself. But I could change my mind if questions I had about the film could be answered by Matt Osterman and the cast.

After seeing the film, I could only recommend renting the film to others only to see potential in what could have been a good film and learn ultimately what feels like a failure of a film. If it becomes available on Prime or Neflix without rental, then it would be more possible to recommend seeing it.",1456185600,2,1969,4.458333333333333
7357780,3,B012P5MHO4,"Before I get criticized on this review, I do say apologies to Brandon Routh and Ben Feldman, but not even you guys, nor Dank Cook can save this flick from impending disaster.  Now I should point out that the RiffTrax Crew has already taken a stab at the Sharknado films (and possibly Sharknado 3), but whereas Sharknado was intentionally a hilarious film, 400 Days turns out to be unintentionally hilarious, only because the director obviously changes gears midway through the production and it turns into something completely incomprehensible.

Amazon notes it's like the Moon meets The Divide.  Try more like the Cube has a train wreck with the Twilight Zone episode 'Time Enough At Last.' Seriously... and afterwards it descends into incomprehensible madness, with an ending reminiscent of an old 'Inside Out (TV series, not the Disney film)' episode I once saw about a high school conducting a similar experiment.

Anyway, what drew me to this one.. before realizing 'SyFy' had there ominous label on it, was the ad about people not liking the ending, and the fact the trailers claimed this was an experiment where four astronauts in-training have to undergo a simulation, before embarking on the real thing.

You know, the classic sci-fi shtick of having people isolated for a predestined period of time, and watch them slowly descend into madness, where one member survives... only to find out the old cliche, it was all a part of that person's dementia and it was nothing more than a hallucinatory dream.

Hey, would have been a FAR better thing if they had stuck to this genre than deviate into what 400 Days had provided.  But I'm getting a bit ahead of myself...

As I aforementioned, the flick starts off with four people chosen for a top secret project.  Basically they are to stay within 400 Days inside a space simulator to see how long they can endure the actual trip.  And the movie succeeds for the most part in doing that, as we witness each member go throughout their daily roles. Thus, as you'd expect they each start having bad memories and such, and trying hard not to throttle each other (you know Joel and Mike with the 'Bots lasted longer than they did, and they had to watch bad movies like this one..) until something unexpected happens.

A tremendous shockwave hits the cabin, knocking out power, and while the others panic, Dane Cook dismisses it as part of the simulation.  But the others are wary about this as they cope with the incident.  Later they get an unexpected visitor into the simulation, and decide to embark outside, despite the fact if they do before the 400 Days, they've failed the experiment.

Upon reluctantly doing so, we now leave The Cube Genre and go right into the typical mysterious apocalyptic genre without fail.  You know, but instead of something out of the Walking Dead, we get sandstorms and darkness, abandoned buildings... well, the house they come to and a swing set (which is connected somehow to Ben Feldman's character)... until they head to town and meet an enigmatic man sweeping the front of a diner.

Though the group gingerly enter into the place, they learn that some otherworldly disaster hit the planet.  However, the director never establishes what it is exactly... did the Moon crash into the Earth? Nuclear disaster? Climate change? Biological Fallout?  Nobody really knows, except it's now continually dark and stormy with sandstorms.  And there seems something sinister with the people.. as if you didn't know... then the film turns into 'And then there were none...' Well, sort of...

While the astronauts are attempting to figure out just what is going on, whereas I'd probably be heading rapidly back to the simulation without fail, two of them (Feldmen and Cook) go to a bar and apparently disappear without rhyme or reason.  They never really establish what happened to them, were they eaten, did they get pulled from the program and taking out of the simulation... or did Feldmen realize he wasn't an astronaut but a guy named Jonah and he was late making it to his shift at Cloud 9?  Nobody knows...

And during this, you can't really tell if this is for real, or not, because during some of the scenes, they switch to night vision cameras at certain moments, indicating our explorers are being covertly observed by someone, which they NEVER reveal whom it could be, or why they're doing this in the first place.

Anyway, as the two remaining astronauts head back to the simulation, they have a final showdown with some of the locals, and then the simulation officially ends... at this point you'd think perhaps Brandon, Ben, Dane or someone would wake up and find out the whole entire thing was nothing more than a virtual reality experiment... but no, what you get is the most bizarre ending since the Sopranos final episode...

Overall, 400 Days is not really a bad film, but it's not good either.  Though the premise did show promise in the beginning, it feels like either the director simply gave up with the development, or the budget ran out and they just decided to save money by using a set left over from another disaster flick.  This is one of those I suggest you rent if you have nothing really better to do.  Or as my title suggests, wait until Mike, Bill and Kevin opt to have this done for a RiffTrax Live performance or VOD.",1456012800,2,5326,4.766050054406964

7357804,4,B012P5MHO4,"This flick is so underrated. It lands soundly in the Suspense genre (bordering on Sci-Fi horror), not the Action genre, so don't expect it to move quickly. The plot was artfully done and the acting was absolutely top notch by a totally rockstar cast from sci-fi and comedy realms. Caity Lotz is a fave of mine. I enjoyed every second of this movie... except for the ending. I'm not sure why writers still believe the ""guess what happens next"" ending is clever, but it's not. It's a lazy, lazy gimmick used by amateury hacks who can't figure out how to wrap up a story. This is especially true here, since the question you're ultimately left to speculate about is posed fairly early in the story, so you spend the rest of the movie trying to figure it out, and you expect some sort of eventual gratification from all of that work. They even give you clues! It's sad to make it to the very end of a perfectly suspenseful movie, only to be let down by such shenanigans. The reveal could have been spectacular.

Into the last 3/4 of the movie (the ""I hated it"" part)  I had to wage a battle with my self to keep from forwarding through the movie to see if there was a point to the disconnected madness that was unfolding.  The madness (and not the anger type) itself was unfolding right onto me.  The people outside, rather than acting like something considerably catastrophic had happened, acted more like zombies with the ability to communicate verbally.  The only reason I even wanted to watch this movie (the ""I loved it"" part) was the fact that three of my favorite actors (one from CW:The Flash, and two from CW:DC's Legends of Tomorrow) were in it and I got to see how they acted outside of the DC-comic-book-movie.

I suppose the only redeeming quality to this movie was that it appeases the appetite's of people who crave hanging [by the neck] from a noose of not-having-closure.

So far, so interesting.  The Trailer sets up a set of scenes that might be supernatural, might be psychological, should be scary, they aren't.

The film fails at it's primary objective of setting up an atmosphere of suspense, tension between the characters is contrived and this allows the suspension of disbelief to be eroded away.  The actors are all decent TV actors (Mostly from CW's Arrow show) , but they just can't carry off the required depth of character for a storyline of this nature.

I thought the premise was interesting, and they dropped just enough hints throughout to help you connect the dots on your version of the films reality. In reading other reviews, it sounds like people were mostly irritated with the lack of a packaged ending, suddenly having the big reveal and instantly knowing if you were right or wrong. For me however, I felt it was wrapped up well enough that I was comfortable with my version of what happened, and I think in many ways that's better. We all walk into a theater with a slightly different set of experiences and predispositions, why do I need to come to the same conclusion as the director in order to feel validated?

I also thought the casting was superb. Given the tight shooting schedule(6 weeks) and a budget of 400,000, I think it speaks to the story and the director for assembling the cast they did. This quality of talent in turn made the film feel much bigger than it was maybe intended to be, and strengthened the movie overall.

Had a science feel to it, introduced elements early in the movie that would prove to be interesting, had a pretty significant twist, good actors... why wouldn't you like it? Because it just didn't work together well. Don't continue reading if you don't want spoilers.

First, they tried so hard to make it look authentic but fail to really deliver impressionable scenes. For example, the ""launch scene"". Spent a lot of money making a fancy capsule, I really liked the controls. Even had a rather impressive simulator of the snag they encountered during launch. But the whole scene just a total let down (I honestly blame the flight director, didn't seem to add anything at all).

Second, the ""twist"" segment just seemed clunky. Ok, something happened, civilization went the way of Fallout... ok. Had a chained up locker that was never opened and a dude in a cage... why. Where did the other astronauts go... not answered at all. People acting strange and, some, completely oblivious that four astronauts walk into a bar. Aside from that being a great setup for an amusing joke, you would have thought people would have been at least a bit more curious than they were. Maybe this eludes to the possibility that the whole thing was fake but there were just too many things that just made it clunky.

Lastly, the ending. My goodness, that ending. So, I'm not a huge fan of movies that leave the ending up to interpretation but this was a huge let down. It left way too much up in the air. The only thing I was left with at the end was ""Why did I just waste all this time watching this movie"". I'd honestly will say that if they could have done the movie more justice by either tying loose ends up in the middle of the movie and left it here or leaving the movie wide open in the middle and coming to a pseudo close at the end. For example, ""Congratulations astronauts on a job well... oh well with the exception of the trail of dead bodies you left behind..."" or ""welcome to post apocalypse"". That would have at least allowed the viewer to conclude the rest in their mind. The way it was left, you could go in about a dozen directions with this and still be left unsatisfied with the conclusion. Total let down.

Is it worth the $5 to rent it? Probably not, and here's why....
I agree with every reviewer who said the first half had a good premise, I could overlook all the geeking things that I know weren't true to life. I mean we all do, if you're really into a movie. That's the point, we go in knowing that the tech, the personalities, etc. would never stand up to real life. So, that wasn't my issue.
It pulled me, the clues and intrigue, but then the last half...I'm not sure how to describe it without ruining for those that still choose to watch it but, it wasn't what I'd hoped for in an ending. While I enjoy a good movie that invites the audience to guess at things, I equally prefer to see which conclusions were close or not. I will even be satisfied if only 3 or 4 things were neatly tied up at the end but, this is not that kind of movie.
That last half felt disjointed from the first half. What was the point of showing all that without some connection to the first half. Yes, it hints at what happened, and what's going on, but there are no real answers and thus, it makes the ending seem pointless.
Why do we follow these characters, and this story line to end up with no resolution?
I feel like it could've been a great movie, if there had been some point to the end, some huge revelation that was tangible. Something that the audience could see first hand, but instead you're just left there, with the question again of why do you follow the characters and this story to no resolution?",1453334400,67,1643,4.2492012779552715

Then two of the crew go missing...which they never explained what happened to them, tho the subtext is ""chopped up"" and ...ugh.

The ending is not an actual ending, there is no resolution of the plot, I get it, your suppose to wonder if everything is real or was all a part of a simulation but there are very few movies that can get away with pulling that sorta ending, and Inception this movie is NOT

  Well, you were warned :) The 400 days movie chronicles the experiment of 4 astronauts on a simulated space journey for 400 days with the simulated spacecraft being a small habitat buried underground. The doctor most likely supplied the rest of the crew with hallucinogens (without their knowledge) as part of the experiment. With the hallucinations, it really complicates what actually went on during the movie, so I'm sure there are other, valid viewpoints. If I had to guess, I'd say the small habitat was dug up after a while when the crew's hallucinations were in full swing and brought to an area where the out of spacecraft part was staged. It's possible the whole crew never left the habitat and hallucinated the whole thing but I don't give their imagination that much credit :)",1505088000,,1001,4.224719101123595
