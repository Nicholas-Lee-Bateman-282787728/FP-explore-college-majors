8134125,4,B000GRU9WG,"This is a nice DVD for teachers. Even those of us who are well  trained need new jump and turn combinations to share with our students. Moreover, were looking for that approach that may reach the wayward student. I really like bob rizzo's stuff. Keep in mind these are classic jumps and leaps...nothing trick like.",1404691200,,314,4.709090909090909
8134126,3,B000GRU9WG,I have to laugh because I have been looking at this DVD for a least 2 years and wanting to view it.  I tracked it down in my local library only to find it hadn't been returned and I STILL couldn't watch it....after lots of anticipation waiting to see it I purchased it....it is old school stuff.  Basic turns and leaps.  Nothing special.  The filming is low budget also.  The dancers are okay- he is a jumping machine...her leotard is from 1980...but who notices that anyway?....I recommend you try to rent it from the library- it is just a reference and not a really good one at that....,1355788800,,588,4.407407407407407
8134127,5,B000GRU9WG,"This book is absolutely wonderful.  It shows step-by-step procedures for jumps, twists, turns, cartwheels, spins, and any other gymnastic/cheer/dance moves.",1229990400,,156,6.8
8134128,5,B000GRU9WG,"I am a dance teacher.  I recommend this for intermediate and advanced dancers, as well as older beginners (don't buy this for your 7 year old that has been taking lessons a couple of years, as there is risk of injury with jumps).
This is a super video!  Each jump or turn is explained and marked.  After the demo, most are shown with variations or quick combonations.  A few turns are marked specifically for beginners (meaning it is demonstrated with foot/arm work, but without actually turning).",1187913600,9,497,4.744186046511628
