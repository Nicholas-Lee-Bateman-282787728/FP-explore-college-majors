5772187,5,B00D3LA7H4,"Moving, powerful,  - I would have loved to see this movie be hours and hours long to just listen to the amazing words and right-on in-depth critical analysis of Angela Davis, - AMAZING! Brilliant. And the times are not that far away from us, - we have THE SAME forces at work today, - the same forces that limit and restrict ALL peoples freedoms, especially if you are not the valued cherished privileged inheritor of the status quo - aka, white, rich/middle class, male, - and reading Michelle Alexander's The New Jim Crow will tell you that the problems with our prison system have not gone away, - and that racism has not disappeared since the 60s.  As a white, lesbian female pursing a career in academia, I can attest to the climate that attacks, snubs, hinders, and often, chains, those who want to teach the real story of our nation  - stories like Angela Davis' and the Black Panther Party and the struggle for equity and justice!",1378684800,7,938,4.571428571428571

Judging History and Angela Davis
A review of Free Angela.

When I was younger, in the eighties, one of the greatest compliments (or insults, depending on who said it) was to be told you had an ""Angela Davis"" afro. The hairstyle then, didn't resonate the same meaning as it did in the late sixties and seventies, when, in those days, it called forth a number of responses from people the world over. To the mainstream establishment in the United States, Angela Davis, crowned with the fullest of afros, was the embodiment of terrorism and the specter of overthrow. To the kids that I grew up with, in a middle-class, black neighborhood on Long Island, New York, she represented an era that we'd heard about, but, perhaps, didn't understand very well. We did know, however, that most of our parents considered her a hero, while most of our teachers didn't. Free Angela, a feature length documentary directed by Shola Lynch, does a fine job in helping to explain how Ms. Davis came to represent so much to so many.

The political and social environment in the late sixties and early seventies was amongst the most turbulent this nation has seen. It is during this time that Ms. Davis rose to prominence, first, as a philosophy professor at UCLA, then as an political activist, battling the state forces allied against her and organizations such as the maligned Black Panther Party, for whom she was a staunch advocate. In an atmosphere of increasing danger, and in which friends and associates of her's lost their lives, it becomes clear in the film when, none other than America's then voice of authority and gravitas, Walter Cronkite reports that Angela Davis had been placed on the F.B.I.'s 10 Most Wanted List, that a confrontation was indeed at hand. After a frenetic flight from pursuit, she is captured as a fugitive and imprisoned, to await trial facing the death penalty on three counts. The ultimate state punishment was levied at her, the most threatening of Black people, at a time when the state felt most threatened. This is within ten years of the murders of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, John F. and Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King. The fabric of society being rent apart, one can reason the state being justified in using the most extreme means for it's preservation. This film deftly presents a case against such reason. Constitutional and state laws were tested to decide her fate, which was being witnessed by the world, Ms. Davis having become, by then, a cause clbre for equal rights and justice for the oppressed. Then Governor of California, Ronald Reagan, and President Richard Nixon representing what today would be called ""the Right"", and Angela Davis, and those she championed, representing ""the Left"", this battle for the ages, in some ways, continues.

Through reportage and narrative, Ms. Lynch builds the drama in this story as Joseph Campbell would weave a mythological tale; the hero facing myriad trials along her journey until she finds redemption. Supported by a breathtaking amount of archival and historical footage, as well as subtle re-enactments, she has crafted a balanced documentary which presents enough evidence of the actions of both the hero and the opposition, to allow the audience to make it's own judgement as to its veracity and fairness. This is a hard story to tell, a hard balance to maintain, with it's subject also serving, in part, as narrator. Richard Nixon, known for law and order, is driven from office in disgrace. Legends are often equal parts fact and fantasy, and the legend of Angela Davis, as chronicled in this film, might be categorized as history being told by the victor. It might be too soon, yet, to declare victory, as we still live in a society where race is an issue affecting much of the conversation, justice is uneven, and freedom is a nebulous concept. A most timely observation is that, at it's heart, this was a case about our Second Amendment right to bear arms, an issue that clearly has yet to be resolved. There is hope in the telling of this story, however. Making this important information available helps to counter the many years of misrepresentation, and provides it on a grandly consumable scale. It allows for a younger audience to gain more understanding of a violent, troubled period in this country's history and, perhaps, draw parallels to the turbulence we experience today. It may allow them, as it allowed Ms. Davis, in her youth to say, ""my world is changing, and I do want to be a part of this.""",1376697600,16,4610,4.824273072060683

5772193,5,B00D3LA7H4,"For those who do not know the full story, this documentary describes the details surrounding her arrest and trial, as well as a little concerning her background. I thought it was pretty well made and the narration flowed easily. They did include a fair amount of authentic audio and pictures. They were also able to interview some of the key individuals present as part of her defense team. The documentary is almost 2 hours long, but it was actually straight to the point presenting her story in a concise manner. I definitely recommend this movie.",1470096000,3,549,4.7894736842105265

She takes a job at UCLA because they needed someone who knew Continental Philosophy.  Many California leaders created and manufactured controversies and kerfuffles because she was a Communist. Davis refused to kowtow to then California Governor Ronald Reagan and the UCLA Governing Board. They fire her. She was later implicated her in a murderous plot. The charges levied against her were farcical. The state had no case and charged her anyway. She won in court because she had crackerjack lawyers. Please watch the film and learn about this LEGEND.

What happened to Angela Davis is a travesty... the final scene in this movie (a still picture with audio commentary between Nixon and a Staff Member) is worth the price of watching this movie! What bigotry at the highest ranks of government.

Angela Davis is an American trailblazer and in my opinion, she is a hero. This movie uses historical footage, interviews (some old, some in more modern settings) and a little bit of re-enactment to tell the best version of this story possible. Davis wasn't thinking only about her incarceration and wanting protestors to demand freedom for herself... she had them ask for freedom for ALL political prisoners.",1423785600,,705,4.97457627118644

It really showed how people coming together can bring about change. I had no doubts whatsoever that she was innocent.
Her spirit remained unbroken. She refused to bow down even after she was acquitted she vowed to continue fighting for
all political prisoners in this country. The fact that she was raised in one of the most racist states in the country adds to
the charm of this bold woman. I loved the film,and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the civil rights

8589049,5,B00D3LA7H4,"Another brilliant documentary explaining what I was never aware of back in the 70s (I was a white teenager). Goes to show how the white privilege within the media/journalism of the day filtered all the facts about Angela and her plight. She is a hero, as are many of her associates. Most definitely worth the watch!",1492560000,4,315,4.642857142857143
