Some people just think of 9/11 as buildings and planes going down, but there were background crisis that were also happening simultaneously. At the time of 9/11, my son was 15, but now he is an air traffic controller in the U.S. Air Force and this movie gives me even more respect for the job that air traffic controllers do on a day to day basis, and even more for what they went through on that horrific day. Everyone should watch this movie to help understand there are many facets of a crisis and know that heros were made that day, in ways you may have never thought of. May God bless and keep all controllers, in the palm of His hand.",1223769600,,805,4.302631578947368
3520206,5,B001CU7UKU,"The FAA, the air traffic controllers, pilots, and flight crews had never been put through such a test in airline history. It just goes to show that the United States as a team can come through when needed. This film is spectacular!",1219536000,,231,4.523809523809524
8289640,4,B001CU7UKU,It wasn't quite what I expected it to be but it was a good documentary.  I have many DVDs about 9/11 and this one was okay but it lacked a human element to it.,1467590400,,159,3.676470588235294

8289647,5,B001CU7UKU,We found it amazing to see how air traffic controllers handled this unforeseen situation. To see what else was happening on that day was inspiring,1301702400,,146,4.88
8289648,5,B001CU7UKU,"This was totally captivating.  Seeing airport runways full to capacity, was a picture that has stayed with me.  Airports not used to more than a few planes a day, stepped up and did us proud.  After all the horror, this was a look at other heros, not thought of usually.  You know they did a good job, because for ONCE, government decided not to make written rules on how to handle this situation if it happened again, but left it to the airport men and women, who handled it so well.  We are reminded that these people, had families to worry about also, but had to deal with their jobs first.  This is not all about government safety, but rather personal stories of the people in towers trying to decide if any other planes had hi jackers on them, and where to land them, as fields got filled up, and fuel tanks got low.  It was so refreshing to have stories told personally, by the people who had so much responsibility on that day.  I was reminded for the first time of all the planes still to come in from across the Atlantic, who couldn't turn back.
At times I forgot I was watching a dvd, and found myself almost sitting with these people, or looking over their shoulders.  Goose bumps!  Plenty of those.  Recommeded to everyone.",1272067200,3,1235,4.39647577092511
8289649,5,B001CU7UKU,"I saw this movie for the first time a few years after Sept 11, 2001. It tells the story of how the air traffic controllers went about getting all the planes to land safely on that day. The movie is a factual reinactment of that day, not one of those US conspiracy movies I've seen out there. It is an amazing story and I learned things I never knew about that day. It made me realize what a wonderful but emotionally & phisically exhausting job those people did that day. I decided to purchase it as part of my record of Sept 11 & have shown it to friends & family.",1234915200,,565,4.099099099099099
