7860227,4,6304065507,"This is a real old one, but it is a favorite of mine. The storystarts out with this girl with pink hair (kinda looks like theoriginal version of Nene from BGC) has a love for a man namedShapiro. When Shapiro and his girlfriend get into flight combat,Shapiro leaves to persue space...The action is so fast and intense Ihad to put it in slow motion to actually see what was going on. Theaction is definetely on a level of Robotech. Ans since you get 5episodes on one tape, you get more bang for the buck. Definetely aclassic in my book.",978739200,2,534,4.404040404040404
