8420812,5,B004ASDNM0,I enjoyed watching this old Black and White movie. Good  storyline with credible performances from the leading players. I was blown away by the talent of  Shirley Temple at such a very young age here in a much earlier movie than her 'well -known' roles .,1397260800,,254,4.5
8420813,1,B004ASDNM0,"Very disappointed in this DVD.  Originally purchased it because wife is trying to collect all Shirley Temple DVD's.  However, Shirley is in this one very, very little.  Must've been one of her earlier ones.  Regardless, I wasted my money on this one because it's of very poor quality.  Another Shirley Temple DVD received from another seller that I was skeptical of purchasing because it was a ""home made"" one, was recently viewed and is in perfect quality as if it was a newly released movie.  So again, by comparison here, this Red Haired Alibi DVD isn't worth any amount of money paid for it.",1328140800,3,595,4.673076923076923
