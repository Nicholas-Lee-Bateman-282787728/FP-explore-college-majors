1239008,4,B00000JWW6,"fascination is eerie and erotic. thats what makes it interesting. its about vampires but not the mythological kind, just ordinary people who like to drink blood. high society french lesbians who drink ox blood as a cure for anemia and apparently decide to try human blood and decide they like it. the film has its flaws. its slow at times and it has its inconsistincies. but in spite of that it certainly holds your attention, this is no run of the mill vampire or horror film",995587200,,476,4.546511627906977

Fascination is a bizarre foray into the twisted realm of two women who seek to entice unwary men into their  devilish world of evil.

1239041,5,B00000JWW6,"From its opening scene in a gore-soaked slaughterhouse, it's apparent that Jean Rollin has fashioned his horror masterpiece. Set in 1905, the story concerns a thief on the run who has betrayed his comrades. He takes off in search of a hideout, and stumbles upon an isolated castle. He finds the castle occupied by two beautiful women, and figures he's hit the jackpot. After all, he has a gun. He's in control. What could possibly go wrong? Well, he soon discovers that nothing is as it appears, and that he is definitely not the one in control. Meanwhile, his old gang gathers outside, biding their time.

1239043,5,B00000JWW6,"Jean Rollin hits the apex of his cinematic achievement in the surrealist nightmare that is FASCINATION. A thief takes refuge in an abandoned chateau before realizing that it is already being occupied by two vulnerable young women who claim to be its keepers. He is easily seduced by their beauty, and soon falls prey to their own devious designs. Unlike in so many of his other films, FASCINATION offers a linear and coherent storyline that still manages to present the same dreamlike atmosphere and dreary mood. Though highly eroticized, the sensuality of the characters plays strictly in to the plot, itself, rather than serving as cheap exploitation. The haunting image of actress Brigitte Lahaie crossing the bridge in her flowing gown with scythe in hand becomes an iconic moment in French cinema, and one that will not soon be forgotten. FASCINATION is an artistic exercise in style that doesn't quite have the same experimental art house look or feel to it. Its brightly-lit sets still cast a dark shadow over the characters, since we can tell from the beginning that something just isn't right with Elisabeth and Eva. Rollin assembles a wondrous cast in Jean-Marie Lemaire, Franca Ma, and Lahaie, who play perfectly in to his dark fantasy. FASCINATION is in top contention with THE GRAPES OF DEATH in becoming Rollin's finest film, if not his most popular.

1239046,5,B00000JWW6,"If you live in the United States and its territories, it is very likely that the horror films that you recognize are those coming from Hollywood, namely the Universal Studios classics (Frankenstein, Dracula, etc) and everything that came much later, such as ""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th,""Saw,"" etc. If you happen to be open to other tendencies, maybe you know about the Hammer Horror films from England, where Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing made a distinguished career. But as technology evolves and communications are more open, more and more horror movies are coming to the United States from other countries, and they are not relegated to connoisseurs anymore. One of these foreign films is the spicy and intriguing ""Fascination."" Directed by Jean Rollin, ""Fascination"" is a classic in French horror films, one that has successfully been rescued from oblivion and is now available in glorious Blu-ray version.

The story takes place in 1905, and it opens in a slaughter house, where we meet some society ladies drinking ox blood, which was apparently used to cure anemia at the time. We then fast-forward and meet Mark (Jean-Marie Lemaire), an unscrupulous bandit that steals the loot from a robbery from his partners. They, of course, are not happy and go after him all the way to the forest. However, they have to stop, because Mark finds refuge in a castle, and they decide to wait for him outside - sooner or later he has to come out. Inside the castle, Mark meets two attractive young ladies, Elizabeth (Franca Mai) and Eva (Brigitte Lahaie), who don't offer much resistance. In fact, one of them tells Mark, ""I offer you my virginity in return for my life."" Of course, that's an offer that Mark can't refuse. After a while, he contemplates leaving, but the ladies tell him that there was a meeting at midnight, involving other ladies - kind of a secret society that meets once a year. Curiosity makes him stay, despite being told to ""beware; death sometimes takes the form of seduction."" And what does this has to do with ox blood?  We learn that in addition to being a therapy for anemia, it ""is the life which flows in you, but it's also death when it escapes... Perhaps there is no going back, once it's touched your lips.""

""Fascination"" is not a strong horror film in the sense that it is scary. It is rather suspenseful and very erotic, with lots of nudity, much more so than the Hammer films that I have watched, in which horror and eroticism mixed quite well. Brigitte Lahaie [Filmography] was a popular porn star at the time, and this was her second legitimate role for Rollin. This is quite one special film that got me asking for more. In fact, Redemption Films and Kino Lorber are releasing more films by Jean Rollin, including ""The Nude Vampire"" (1970), ""The Shiver of the Vampires"" (1971), ""The Iron Rose"" (1973), and ""Lips of Blood"" (1975). The fantastic Blue-ray edition of the film includes two deleted sex scenes, a documentary about Rollin, a 20-page booklet about Rollin's films, and more. (France, 1979, color, 81 min plus additional materials).

1239047,5,B00000JWW6,"This film is probably the best introduction to Rollin's oevre (it's been described as his attempt to be do something main-stream), which would best be described as soft-porn horror.  Some of it is somewhat gory, like when one of the women, after having sex with a bandit and then stabbing him, while walking back to the castle kills two of his accomplices and a female accomplice with a scythe.  The plot is somewhat confusing (I think wikipedia gets it garbled) but plot is not what Rollin is strong at.  I'd summarize it as just the thing for people who like that sort of thing.",1333324800,,580,4.5576923076923075
1239048,3,B00000JWW6,"I often feel that Jean Rollin is more interested in creating artful mysterious erotica than he is in telling compelling stories and generally what 'keeps me awake' during some of his inanely meandering films is the presence of numerous attractive unclothed young French girlz. The film 'Fascination' is unique in that it actually has a very simple sequential sort of plot line AND a lot of naked girlz.  A petty thief on the run from his own gang (who he is looking to double cross) takes refuge in a chateauesque mansion and stumbles upon a coven of  upper society women who drink blood in order to stave off anemia & remain beautiful. Initially the chateau is inhabited by only two young lesbian women (Brigitte Lahaie and Franka Mai) and they play cat & mouse with the handsome robber until all the ladies arrive at midnight and things get interesting.  As usual, 'get interesting' in a Rollin flik means that more girlz take their clothes off and attack whatever hapless folk are in their vicinity.  The actresses are all gorgeous and get naked a lot, and the actor playing the thief is likable enuf that this Rollin effort moves right along to its' enigmatic conclusion - making it one of his more 'watchable' features.
The version I purchased was the non-BluRay disk from Redemption and it provided a nice clean picture & a few 'extras'.  This version runs 81 min. and I've noted that there is a 90 min. version available from Amazon. UK that purports to be 'fully' uncut/uncensored ... I'd be curious to know what the additional 9 min contains - if anyone has viewed that version.",1332288000,5,1587,4.694244604316546
1239049,5,B00000JWW6,"I  had  the dvd of this one and then upgraded to the blu ray.  It is not restored. There is still plenty of print damage on this one, however they did master this from the original film negative! The colors and picture is therefore better.  This is a interesting story of female vampires in a castle that is very erotic.  It's  in french and it is as good as the classic 'grapes of death' too.
It's in the tradition of 'vampyres' and 'daughters of darkness'. It's more literate than rollins earlier vampire movies. There is a plot here and those are more expirimental.  Soon after this Rollins made the interesting low budget nazi zombie movie 'zombie lake' , it's not near as good as this but it's fun. This is a solid horror film and rollins did it right back then. So did the actors who pull this off too.  A eurohorror favorite. The picture is unrestored here but acceptable. this is only in french with english subtitles. the blu ray has several extra deleted scenes with no sound, and a 1999 tv british tv show episode. From eurotic! or something close to that. The show would showcase directors form europe who made erotic films both horror and other types. They interview the late director and he's quite a interesting character. he died in 2010.  But this does have a plot and is a solid movie, some of this directors movies are real art house stuff and this is a standard tale of anemia victims who pray on men for their blood!.  Many consider it a horror classic from that era as well as his 'grapes of death'. Both solid flicks for even non Rollin's fans. I like the art house ones; except his first one. Which has no plot at all! The rest have a plot with lots of images and fantasies.

""BANG!"" goes the gun.
""Clockwork"" dude, who looks like the love child of Ricky Schroder and Mikhail Baryshnikov, puts his hand to his neck, later showing off what looks like a small scratch made by his pet tabby.
Gang says, ""There he is!"" (Lucky shot, in that case. Well, not so lucky really since throwing a butter knife at him would have done just as much damage.)
Clockwork then goes running across a field and into a castle wherein it looks like Just Jaeckin is working on some storyboards for ""Lady Chatterley's Lover.""

Such is the poorly constructed world of Jean Renoir's ""Fascination,"" a Skinimax yarn that at best plays like Richard Kern directing an episode of ""Bewitched,"" and at worst comes across like a bad-implant catalog captured on film.

It is strange that a director who was nominated for a directing Oscar for ""The Southerner"" and mentored Robert Aldrich, the director of ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" and ""The Dirty Dozen,"" would switch to X-rated movies toward the end of his career. Stranger still is that when Renoir died immediately after the filming of this movie, Orson Welles stated in a Los Angeles Times editorial that he was ""the greatest of European directors: very probably the greatest of all directors -- a gigantic silhouette on the horizon of our waning century."" But remember, Welles spent his latter years living in a back room at Peter Bogdanovich's Bel Air hacienda leering at Cybill Shepherd all day.

In a nutshell, ""Fascination"" concerns the commonplace fantasy than many women had during the 1970s of transferring the menstrual cycle to men, before contraceptive pills containing progestins were readily available in the marketplace.",1260662400,5,1879,4.996805111821086

1239054,4,B00000JWW6,"Okay, Jean Rollin is far from a great director, I suppose. He's really inept in some respects. For instance, the ""action"" and gunplay scenes at the beginning of this film are very amateurishly shot and staged. BUT (as Pee Wee Herman says, everybody has a big but) . . . Rollin is brilliant at creating a hypnotic, dreamlike atmosphere, and he has a real feel for surreal imagery. Rollin's a true original, his films truly aren't like anyone else's, and I award big points for originality.
Fascination has basically no plot. A criminal on the run hides out in an old chateau and ends up the victim of a strange blood-drinking cult of women. That's about it. But believe me, you haven't lived until you've seen a half-naked Brigitte Lahaie wielding a scythe. Lahaie is a wonderful film actress. Besides being unusually sexy, she's blessed with real screen presence.
If you're open to unconventional films, you owe it to yourself to check out Fascination, or any Jean Rollin films other than Zombie Lake.",1077235200,2,1001,4.791907514450867
1239055,4,B00000JWW6,"Jean Rollin is a name instantly recognizable to hardcore horror genre fans, but meaningless to nearly everyone else. That is too bad because this French director concocted some of the sleaziest, most unusual films ever made during the 1970s and 1980s, films usually imbued with hypersexuality and bloody violence. I have often tossed Rollin's name around in impolite company with seeming aplomb even though I had never seen even one of the man's films. You read enough plot synopses about someone and you start to feel as though you know every intimate detail about their work. What I did hear from others about this director oftentimes did not bode well. He is apparently well versed in schlock filmmaking--which in and of itself is not a problem with me, a true lover of bad cinema--but several of his films continue to draw raves from a selected minority of genre fans. Well, I finally sat down with a Jean Rollin film, his 1979 effort ""Fascination,"" and was pleasantly surprised with the results. As I viewed the film with a growing sense of intrigue, I began mentally composing a list of other films from this director that I should watch in the near future.
""Fascination,"" set in rural France sometime in the early twentieth century, is a story about vampires. Initially, this plot did not interest me. Vampire films have been done to death over the years, and I rarely express any interest in this popular mainstream staple. I plunged ahead anyway. A gang of criminals roams the countryside, waylaying and robbing hapless travelers who happen to pass by. Simultaneously, at a nearby castle, a group of women who regularly drink blood in order to stay young plan a very special nocturnal gathering. These two seemingly diverse events converge in the form of Mark (Jean-Marie Lemaire), the leader of the band of robbers who suddenly decides to double cross his companions. In the ensuing chase, Mark barely escapes with his life by seeking refuge in the aforementioned castle. As his partners in crime lurk outside, Mark meets two young, beautiful women named Elisabeth and Eva in the castle (Franca Mai and Brigitte Lahaie respectively). At first, he holds them hostage, but he slowly lets his guard down as he gets to know these two on a personal level. Elisabeth and Eva keep mentioning a mysterious gathering of women about to take place in the castle this very evening, but Mark is too busy fending off his enemies outside to take much note of this talk. When the other women do show up, the criminal takes great joy in playing games with these enigmatic ladies. The conclusion of the film has several interesting twists and turns, but it is sufficient to say that several members of the cast meet their doom by the time the credits roll.
What I liked best about ""Fascination"" is the style. If I had to choose something to compare with Rollin's film, I would say Paul Morrissey's ""Blood for Dracula"" and ""Flesh for Frankenstein"" most closely resemble ""Fascination."" The set pieces look great in a chintzy way, the costumes look nice as well, and a mood of brooding despondency hangs like a pall over the whole film. Like the characters in Morrissey's two films, the cast of ""Fascination"" gives off a distinct sensation of seediness. The people in this film exude decadence. Moreover, the behavior exhibited by Mai, Lahaie, and several of the actresses certainly add an element of sleaze to the general proceedings: ""Fascination"" overflows with gratuitous nudity and soft-core sex. This contrast between lowbrow behavior and plush scenery gives Rollin's movie a distinctive flair. Sure, the whole thing looks like it was shot on a shoestring budget, but at the same time it looks better than its financial limitations.
The DVD version released by Image does offer a few extras, such as a Rollin filmography and a few trailers. All of the dialogue is in French but adequately subtitled. In fact, the language of the film is one of the things that impressed me. I know a bit of French, and I could follow along with most of the dialogue because the actors spoke slowly enough for me to understand what they were saying. I don't know if this was due to the wooden performances of the cast or because I just clicked with the language. Either way, it was kind of neat to listen to a film in French and understand the darn thing. Digressions aside, ""Fascination"" was, to me, a fascinating film well worth watching again. If nothing else, tune in to see a semi-nude Brigitte Lahaie swinging a cheesy looking scythe on the drawbridge of the castle, a scene that must be seen to be believed.",1075075200,18,4591,4.797979797979798
1239056,5,B00000JWW6,"let's face it, folks! you can say whatever you want about this film or any other jean rollin film but you must understand a few things. very few directors anywhere in the world have been as prolific or artistic as mr. rollin & even fewer can create such wonderful imagery on such small budgets. fasciantion is a splendid example of eerie suspense with a subdued pyshcological twist & i could easily watch this film over & over. the opening of the film is really quite simple as it deals with a thief who has cheated some other rogues out of some money & now has to run for his life. as fate or luck would have it, he ends up in a chateau where he finds two young & beautiful servant girls alone. as the viewer can guess, something horrible will happen eventually but we are lead to these horrific events with the greatest of ease while being left in suspense at all times. there is a great deal of flirting & teasing amongst the thief & the two servant girls which incude some rather sexy but soft sex scenes which rollin is generally known for. after the rogues are killed(this is the most hilarious death sequence i have seen in some time), we are introduced to more weird, upper class women who appear to be having some sort of midnite ritual & they are eager to include the thief. ok, stopping there. you will have to experience the rest & i dare you to sleep well with this one on your mind. some of you will be better off watching this one with the lights on. my favorite sequence invovles the ever-sexy  Brigitte Lahaie carrying a scyuthe in her hands & dressed in a black robe. this is sexy, eerie, & ironically funny all at once. jean rollin is trying to show us that quite often the blood that runs from our bodies may be of more use than the body itself. oooooo, scary! enjoy it, folks. i certainly do.",1067817600,2,1813,4.316715542521994
1239057,2,B00000JWW6,"This little seen cult flick is mostly recommended for those who like art melded with their gore. Personally for that I would watch BLOODSUCKING FREAKS (1978) or THE GORE GORE GIRLS (1972); but this is the first Jean Rollin film I have ever seen so cut me a little slack.
Set in France in 1905, the movie opens with a pair of attractive young women drinking ox blood fresh from the local slaughterhouse as part of a bizzare therapy prescribed by their doctor. Predictably as a result of this they become addicted to blood, & soon reach the point where animal fluids don't work well anymore so they logically advance to human blood. Hiding out in a castle, the ever growing band of lovely female vampires, tired of feasting on their own gender; select two of their brethren to seduce young men & slaughter them for their blood. No mean feat, since (speaking as a heterosexual male) guys do about 90% of their thinking with their nether regions anyhow, so the mission is about as straightforward as finding ice in Antarctica.
FASCINATION is a pretentious arty film directed by cult fave Jean Rollin; there are a few lesbian sex scenes & some nudity but not enough to make the movie worthwhile, even given the brief running time (approx 78 mins). The gore scenes are boring too, & make one pine for the masterful works of Herschell Gordon Lewis. Who would have though a French exploitation film about two gorgeous bi-sexual female vampires could be so bloody boring? FASCINATION may rate as essential viewing for arthouse ponces but horror/cult movie fans will be disappointed.
However, if you enjoy this you may want to check out the Hammer horrors THE VAMPIRE LOVERS (1970), LUST FOR A VAMPIRE (1971 aka TO LOVE A VAMPIRE) & VAMPIRES (1974 aka DAUGHTERS OF DRACULA)- all of which are mediocre too, in my opinion. But I WILL give Jean Rollin a second chance & rent LIVING DEAD GIRL at some stage.",1067644800,3,1893,4.6706586826347305
1239058,4,B00000JWW6,"Director Jean Rollin and bodacious French actress Brigitte Lahaie have combined on a number of very special (if somewhat flawed) supernatural films.  ""Fascination"" is probably the very best.  A coven of beautiful vampire women, a criminal on the run, Lahaie in Grim Reaper's black carrying her giant scythe... all memorable elements in an etheral film that is more mesmerizingly compelling than narratively intact.  Relax and enjoy as Rollin and Lahaie manipulate the images that will fascinate your mind.
This is the kind of horror film that incites more unsettling echoes later on as opposed to shocks upon initial viewing.  In the end it is well worth watching.",1049846400,10,664,5.177570093457944
1239059,4,B00000JWW6,"This film embodies a lot of why i find these Euro horror/sleaze films so interesting. The way its filmed,the camera seems hand-held all the way through!!Just for some of the imagery this film is worth it. The abbatoir at the start,the infamous Brigitte Lahaie with sythe scene,when the main character(i forget his name-but who cares!!)is running up to the castle its very eerie with the washed-out,watercolours of the woodland behind him.  Lahaie really makes this film stand out for me,she is BEAUTIFUL.  Aestheticly this film really is a treat to watch. Im now hooked on Rollin,im getting Living Dead Girl next!!",997833600,3,614,5.069306930693069

These men choose to rape  a woman (vampire played by Brigitte Lahaie) and in the end is killed, one by one. Happy again,
