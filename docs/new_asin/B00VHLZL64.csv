8710202,4,B00VHLZL64,"Very captivating story lines from the very first episode. Great for practicing my Spanish listening skills. I was hoping to be able to use it my classroom, but the language and some of the content may be a little too mature. But, personally, I'm loving it!",1469923200,,256,4.586956521739131
8710203,5,B00VHLZL64,"My favorite series, hands down.  I wish it supported english subtitles, but oh well.  As others have stated, you need a special dvd player.  Theyre easy to find, i bought one here on amazon",1469491200,2,189,4.5
8710204,3,B00VHLZL64,"If you want to use this to help with learning Spanish, go for it. But if you want a plot that actually makes sense and won't make you groan throughout a lot of it, you'll probably have to try something else. I watched the whole thing because I'm studying Spanish, and it was helpful to learn more modern idioms and words, but there were times I was just yelling at the screen things like, ""Oh please!"" and ""Yeah, right!"" There were some attractive characters, but really it was so far-fetched as to be laughable, and I really didn't like the end either. I think Ramon Campos has improved over the years. His storylines are a little more believable in series like Gran Hotel and Velvet, which I do recommend.",1465776000,,707,4.488372093023256
8710205,5,B00VHLZL64,Love this series it keeps you hooked up just want to continue watching it.,1463616000,,74,4.357142857142857

8710207,5,B00VHLZL64,"Excellent!!!! Delivered wayyy to early that I expected due it is from Spain. Obviously as a DVD quality, and sometimes the image get darker. Also you will need a multiregion DVD, because Region 1 DVD or blu ray doesn't read it. I have a multiregion from Mexico, so whatever that said multiregion must be work.  I'm a happy with the faster delivered and I didn't finished yet, but the DVD physically look perfect.",1445040000,4,412,4.6438356164383565
