Fabulous talent and wistful, even rising to poetic moments throughout. ---Extra sweet: footage on Cape Cod. --Missing being there. --If I were wealthy, I'd purchase this DVD for all my family and friends.",1469232000,,326,5.037037037037037

Rowland: I am greatly impressed with EYE ON THE SIXTIES. Just saw it this past weekend on TV in Washington D.C.
I want to tell you I checked to see who took the picture for the cover of Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. 2 and I see a picture like yours but not by you? What happened?
I am 75 years old and a few years younger than you. You are my older brother's age. He was an important cartoonist,writer, and editor in NYC and Boston named Bhob Stewart. Google that name to check him out.
I think your pictures and the film EYE ON THE SIXTIES are maybe the best thing I have ever seen to really capture the 1960's.
And that is because of your fine taste and high intelligence. Those things are lacking in others.
check out my blog at: blogspot.com tally ho! Read my long piece about meeting Bob Dylan at the 1964 Mardi Gras in New Orleans and then again here on the Mall at the Smithsonian Folk Life Festival in 1986.
I knew quite a few of the photographers here in DC back in the 1960s. Not the commercial ones but the fine art ones.

Somehow you make commercial photography look more like fine art photography.
Congratulations on your long fine career.",1441670400,2,1436,4.249084249084249

I was a part of the 60's times for peace and feeling free. Rowland caught it on film and now I have all memories back again. Okay I never really lost them but this DVD makes me smile and travel to a time of innocence and awareness. Thank you Rowland for being such a gentle man and sharing your photography and story with us on a DVD. I wish I had known you. You are a special person.
