7479598,5,B016PUL8PE,"The Little Prince: The Planet of Bamalias is not your average fairytale. With many twists and turns, The Little Prince must undertake a difficult journey to gain his memories back and stop the vicious Snake from fulfilling his evil plans to destroy planets. It is the fight between whats right and what is worth fighting for. This is a fight worth watching.

This film is everything but predictable. Just when everything starts to be okay, the evil Snake appears and causes chaos. The most memorable moment is when The Little Prince has a flashback about saving his best friend, Fox.  Fox needed the Little Prince to help him get out of a volcano that the Snake threw him in. As they try to get out, the Little Prince finally realizes that he possesses power within himself to conquer all things. It was very sad because he had to decide what was more important friendship or love.

Usually my favorite characters are the heroes but here, Snake is my favorite. Although he is bad, there is just something enticing about the way he moves. I love how he disappears and reappears in a matter of seconds. The editor builds suspense by having dark music play just before he appears. The best characteristic of Snake is his ability to change his form and feed off of people's fears.

This film stands out from others because the director doesn't set a limit to his creativity and imagination. The plot is well developed and the setting takes place in a different galaxy where things are quite different. That is one of the reasons why I recommend this film to ages 4 to 10 because it is an escape from reality but it also discusses important lessons. One of the most important messages is that you should fight for what you believe in. Kids would really identify with the Little Prince because he is little kid trying to learn from his own mistakes and to do the right thing. Parents can really appreciate that this film is educational and encourages the viewers to never give up.

I give this film 5 out of 5 stars. Reviewed by Shelby R., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more youth reviews, go to kidsfirst dot org.",1461715200,,2107,4.5782493368700266
7479599,1,B016PUL8PE,"THIS IS AWFUL. I want to gouge my eyes out. Also, it is ENDLESS. The cgi is DREADFUL. The voices are annoying as hell. Is it a good message? Maybe. BUT GOD HELP ME I wish I had never stuck it in the DVD player. Now my kid must watch it to its end ... And it is mind numbingly bad.",1459555200,,280,3.6065573770491803

The animation in it is pretty neat though, and I thought it was a good movie. I would recommend this for kids a little bit older though.",1456617600,,283,3.982456140350877
7479601,4,B016PUL8PE,"The Little Prince: The Planet of the Bubble Gob was completely enthralling for my boys ages 4, 7 and 9. They kept saying they liked it so much because of the action, but I'm hoping they picked up on the deeper message hidden in this strange but compelling story. The Master Creator has designed and brought into being a creature (the Bubble Gob) that instead of helping is harming their world. The Master Creator is ashamed and afraid to own up to his mistake, but he learns the lesson that admitting to your failures and trying to make things right is the best course of action. Fox was everyone's favorite character and the hit of the whole film- he's always making clever remarks and finding himself in funny situations. Hands down, my kids favorite part was in the beginning where the fox gets to float in the sea of junk in the massaging bathtub created for him by Odds n Ends. Amid all the eccentricity in this movie, there is a good message and quite a bit of action. ;)
*Disclaimer- My family received this DVD from NCircle in order to provide a critique of the film. My honest opinions are represented in the above review.",1455667200,,1131,4.495145631067961
7479602,5,B016PUL8PE,"The Little Prince: The Planet of Bubble Gob, directed by Pierre-Alain Chartier, is a fun and creative movie that I enjoyed, especially because of the animation.

This version of The Little Prince is about the Little Prince going to The Planet of the Bubble Gob, a planet where the people are called Creatalls because they create a lot of things.  Sadly, their ocean is completely full of the useless inventions.  The Master Creator creates a big trash collector (the Bubble Gob) to fix the problem, but it actually causes big waves.  The Little Prince has to help to fix the problem.

The characters, the Rose, Fox and Little Prince, are from the book The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupry. In this movie, the plot is different than the original book, but his friends the Rose and the Fox are included.  My favorite character is the Fox because he is the only animal.  He is a cute talking animal who is very feisty and just wants to get the job done so he can go eat a snack.

The animation brings a new twist and is as entertaining as the plot of the movie.  The colors are especially vibrant and repeatedly draw my attention to the Fox and the settings.  I found myself really wanting to look at each of the different inventions the Creatalls have made.

The animation brings the settings in the movie to life!  The buildings are very unusual and are made with a lot of cool items that otherwise would have been junk.  The houses are very unique because they are on poles that rise up and down to avoid the dangerously high waves of the littered ocean. Even the litter in the ocean is interesting to look at as you can see all the different colors even though you are looking down on it from the sky.

Young girls will like the character of Ilmus. She is a strong female character who is smart, works hard and doesnt give up on people. The moral behind The Little Prince is that even if you make a mistake, people will forgive you.

I rank The Little Prince: The Planet of Bubble Gob 4.5 out 5 stars.  I recommend the ages 5 to 12 because there are fights in the dark with an evil snake and ghouls, which might be frightening to younger kids.",1452816000,,2152,4.396464646464646
8737090,1,B016PUL8PE,"1. Poor quality and cheap animation.
2. Poor selection of voice overs for characters. No character to the voices.
3. Story was implausible and too synthetic.
4. No subtitles which is an embarrassment to the young; the oldest; the hard of hearing. I guess dialogue is not important. Cheap!",1517184000,,288,4.8979591836734695
8737091,5,B016PUL8PE,"Ever have a dream about you or one of you friends getting captured by an evil snake?  I know I have. Then, you should watch the Little Prince: The Planet of the Snake. I particularly enjoyed this movie because the Fox is funny and has a good sense of humor. The Fox is always encouraging The Little Prince to keep on going and keep on trying even when times get rough. I enjoyed the plot of the movie as well as the theme, which is ""love is stronger than hate."" The Little Prince has a lot of love, which keeps him strong.

This film is about this boy named The Little Prince whose true love, Rose gets captured by an evil snake named Snake. The Little Prince embarks on an adventure with his friend Fox to save Rose and destroy Snake once and for all. The Little Prince along with his friend Fox travel to different planets to look for Snake.  They start out on the planet that Fox and The Little Prince live on, Asteroid B612 and travel to different parts of space and various planets. <p>The Little Prince and the Fox gather many clues, which lead them to the mysterious island where Snake is. They get attacked by a bunch of weird black balls of gas called gloomies, which throw them off track when they try to look for Snake.

This movie is animated and, although it could have been better I still enjoyed the story and its message. The problem for me was that the animation and sound weren't in sync. For example, when the Little Prince spoke, you would see his mouth move and two seconds later you would hear him say the word. That was distracting to me.

Still, this is a great movie for ages 3 to 10. Younger kids might find some of the characters and scenes too frightening. Kids who like animated movies and adventure storylines would really like this movie. I give it 3 out of five stars because of its good story and problems with the sound sync.

8737092,5,B016PUL8PE,Nice movie,1483315200,,10,4.5
8737093,5,B016PUL8PE,"Mystery, friendship and trust make this an amusing film to watch. The discovery of new planets in the galaxy, each with its own strange inhabitants is a fun concept. I take joy in watching what or who the new planet and characters will be. Beautiful animation, unique story line and memorable characters make this a must see film. I cant wait to see the next adventure. This year, the Little Princess has become one of favorite characters. This series is based on the book from France, written by Antoine de Saint-Exupry's.

The Little Prince and his friend Fox travel across the galaxy visiting different planets. A giant black cobra which symbolizes different emotions like fear, hatred, sadness and jealousy covers the galaxy with darkness. The Little Prince must find out what ails each planet. He is constantly homesick for his red rose on his home planet B612. While visiting the planet of Gargand, they discover that the people there rely on wishing trees, which must be replaced every 122 days, to hold their planet together. The children make a wish upon a tree seed that is dropped down chimneys. The trees then re-grow and each child is rewarded with a new tree which contains the gifts they wished for. One of my favorite parts of this movie is learning what each child asks for such as a hiding tree, a joking tree, a music tree and things like that. I laughed so hard when the Fox asks for a chicken tree and even harder when I saw what tree appeared. The Fox is darling and humorous.

The story reminds me of Christmas - making a wish list, Santa coming down the chimney and waking up to new toys. I wish that along with the gifts the children get from their trees that the trees might look like the item the children wished for. The Gargand delivers the seeds while flying on a Jagunda, a big blue saber-tooth looking creature with bat wings who throws the seeds down the chimney. I am enchanted with these beautiful creatures.

There is a race to find a new Gargand. Thery and Dokan are the main competitors, but when the best doesnt win there might be cheating. The loser takes matters into his own hands. Along with the help of the snake, a peaceful happy community is thrown into disaster.
My favorite part of this film is the captivating animation which is full of carefully thought out and has meticulous details. The colors and the flow of the movie are perfect.

The moral of this story is to think before you act because the thought of losing and revenge could cost the lives of the whole planet. The loser kidnaps Lyl the Alchemist, who puts the wishes into the tree seeds. Even if you think everything is falling apart you should stop, think it out and try again. Sometimes when you hold on to things too tightly out of fear of loss, you hurt the thing you are trying to protect.

I recommend this film to kids ages 6 to 18. The storyline contains lessons for younger kids and characters they can relate to but there are messages that older kids and parents will relate to as well.
