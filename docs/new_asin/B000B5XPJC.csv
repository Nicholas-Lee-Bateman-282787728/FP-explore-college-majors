2400485,5,B000B5XPJC,"I love all of Jillian Michaels videos! This one is not easy, not for the beginners or faint of heart.  Scorch calories, and tone up.  I recommend all her Maximize Series.",1231286400,,170,4.451612903225806
2400486,5,B000B5XPJC,"This video is not for the faint at heart, The warm-up alone is a killer. Jillian has no mercy when it comes to her workouts. Well worth the money, i would recommend this video to everyone, except beginners.",1217462400,,206,4.447368421052632
2400487,4,B000B5XPJC,"I have the first three Jillian Michaels DVD workouts.  It was harder than ____ at first, but if you stick with it, the work pays off.  I do admit the warm-up is a little rushed.  I have gotten used to it and I can truly say that at 47, I'm in the best shape of my life.",1195776000,,269,3.6842105263157894
2400488,5,B000B5XPJC,"I recently received my DVD, and I got to say, I agree with other reviewers on these two points only - the music and camera work suck! The music is useless; I don't even think they were exercising to the music when taping. Clearly, the production team pulled someone off the street to work the camera, because there are not enough wide shots of everyone doing the routine, not enough shots of the young woman doing the modified exercises, and there is one point where Jillian is pointing out something in particular but the camera is on someone else entirely! I mean, yeah, Jillian seems to giggle a lot too, and focuses her attention on one person in particular throughout the DVD,but it's not unbearable.

The great thing about this DVD - the exercises are AWESOME! The music, bad camera angles, and giggles are forgivable when your bum fits better in your jeans. It is so worth it.",1195084800,,883,4.5886075949367084
2400489,5,B000B5XPJC,"I have loved all of her videos.  I rotate them and find that I have an all-over instense workout.  I also do 30 min of striaght cardio a week(run). I ffel very toned and in 30  minutes and get the best workout in that time. I am in pretty good shape and still find that at the end of the workouts I am glad they are over!

The entire set well worth the money - I hope she comes out with more!",1192579200,,392,3.7439024390243905
2400490,4,B000B5XPJC,"I must confess I have not actually tried the exercises in this dvd but I did watch them and can tell, based on my own experience plus watching and following along with other exercise dvd's, that this one is not for beginners. As one reviewer pointed out, many will need to warm up just to be able to do the warm ups - all of the exercises are performed very, very fast compared to what I've seen in other videos, and they aren't that easy if you aren't already in good shape.  That said, there is one person in there who performs the easier version of many of the exercises but the problem is that often the camera doesn't even show her so you don't know how to do the less intense version.  Instead, it seems to focus mainly on keeping up the pace and pushing yourself to the limit (or even beyond).  This looks like a good workout, but beginners will have to ease into it. Like I said, I haven't done the exercises yet but I already know it is going to be a struggle!",1164412800,,969,4.171122994652406
2400491,3,B000B5XPJC,"These workouts pack a lot into 25-30 minutes. But I have to modify them so much I might as well do something else. Jillian's ""warm up"" consists of jumping jacks and running on and off the Step. I have to warm up *before* the warm up. I also don't like all the up and down--for example she has you do jumping jacks or something else that gets the heart rate up and then you stop and lay down on the floor for ab work. ??? Then you get back up and do something else. This made me dizzy and slightly nauseated.

Fans of bootcamp style workouts might like Jillian's DVD's. For a quick total body weight training workout that doesn't make your head spin, I recommend FIRM Super Body Sculpt or Kathy Smith's Lift Weights to Lose Weight 1&2.",1163462400,,734,4.280575539568345
2400492,3,B000B5XPJC,"Not quite sure why I picked this up originally. It's not quite what I expected, but I'm glad I did I bought it.

2400493,4,B000B5XPJC,"I have mixed feelings about this workout DVD.  I love Jillian's attitude and believe that she offers sound advise.  It's really a fantastic workout combining both cardio and strength training.  BUT, for people very out of shape (me), this is a difficult routine to complete.  I was quite active in my 20's and then off and on during my 30's with both cardio and weight lifting so excercise isn't new to me.  Part of me says to keep trying this routine but I feel with it being so difficult I won't stick to it.  Maybe that's a cop out but I wish Jillian would offer something for us beginers.  Personally, I plan to alternate this with other, less intense, workout DVD's (that would be 90% of them) and challenge myself to become healthy enough to complete this routine.  It sure would feel like an accomplishment!  If you are in shape and really want to lose weight and tone up, this is a 5 star DVD.",1143072000,,901,4.412121212121212
2400494,5,B000B5XPJC,"A short workout that packs a punch and will whip you up in shape!

If you like endurance weight training with short cardio bursts then you will enjoy these workouts! I have all 4 of Jillian's endurance strength training DVDS and they are very good especially when combined with 30-45 mins. cardio. The Maximize Full Frontal DVD is a little more intense than Jillian's Shape Up Front DVD; it has more core work, more one-leg moves and the cardio segments always use dumbbells. The Maximize Back In Action DVD is also a little more intense than Jillian's Shape Up Backside DVD; it has more core work, harder exercises and additional power moves. All 4 DVDs are an excellent buy and since they are all short workouts, you can easily combine them with cardio for a well-rounded 60 minute workout. Note: You will not like Jillian's workouts if you prefer to go heavy with weights.",1135296000,,875,4.681818181818182
8081775,5,B000B5XPJC,Love this dvd,1455321600,,13,3.6666666666666665
8081776,3,B000B5XPJC,"Big fan of Jillian Michaels but I think 30 day shred is excellent and I.prefer it over this. I have several of her dvds and their are about four that I like and use the most unfortunately this will not be one.  If you have not tried any of Jillian Michaels workouts, you really should. Her workouts do what she says they will do.
You will see results if you stick with it, not to mention the workouts are great as an every day ritual to maintain your body.",1424995200,,456,4.123595505617978
8081777,2,B000B5XPJC,Jillian disappointed me on this dvd. I expected a workout not a quick and fast pace count of ten for each exercise. By the time you figure out what the next move is the count is over. I did keep up after time but found 30 day shred  and like dvds more of a challenge.,1364428800,,267,3.8545454545454545
8081778,3,B000B5XPJC,For some reason I thought this was a workout video.  It is an instructional video with tips and references for the different part of the body.,1347580800,,142,4.461538461538462
8081779,4,B000B5XPJC,"This is a very fast paced, fast moving from one exercise to the next. It uses a step and small weights. I like her even though she is quite tough! I did mostly the modified version, by next time I will be stronger!",1342051200,,214,4.0
8081780,1,B000B5XPJC,"I have LOVED Jillian's videos Boost Your Metabolism and No More Trouble Zones.  They have kicked my butt and I have seen results.  I was hoping this backside video would be that next step.  Not at all - giving it away.  I did this twice hoping the second time I would know the video better....it's just a bad video.

 I'm not a work out monster, I have never set foot in a gym, I exercise four or five days a week from home in a really good week.  I feel I'm realistic and I'm happy feeling pretty healthy and pretty strong for me.  I'm not a beginner, I would say I'm in the middle somewhere.

There were no pros to this video.

Cons to this:
-Camera work is terrible.  The reps are half over before you see the feet and figure out what they're doing.
-My heart rate was only raised during the warm ups and not through the rest of the video.  Usually I'm mopping sweat off my face during her other videos and I didn't even break a sweat.
-To feel like I'm doing anything I needed to increase the weights from 5 lbs to 10 lbs but don't feel it's safe to jump around with 10 lbs and she moves too quickly from one to another to switch weights out for appropriate exercises without missing all reps.  I'm able to switch them out  in her other videos to maximize my workout.

I was disappointed I wasted my exercise time on this as I feel I didn't even exercise.  The 30 Day Shred is a much better work out if you're looking for something shorter in length.  Don't bother with this one.  I push myself when I do her videos, always trying to get the most out of it.  I found no way to push myself in this video and feel more saggy after wasting two days on it.",1280102400,,1656,4.102803738317757
8081781,3,B000B5XPJC,"I saw this DVD in a two pack w/the maximize - full frontal at a local discount store & since I enjoy Jillian's other DVDs (30DS, NMTZ, & BFBM) thought I'd give these a try.  I've done both DVDs & prefer her newer DVDs.  I don't think they are as hard or as intense as her other DVDs, I wasn't sore the next day after either workout & w/her other DVDs I'm always sore the next day.  They are both fast paced & relatively short workouts but they do make you sweat & are good when you are short on time.",1267488000,,500,3.9306930693069306
8081782,1,B000B5XPJC,"Wow, what a way to hurt yourself!  Warming up by jumping around and then no stretch.  Jumping jacks and more while holding weights -- there's a way to hurt your joints if you're not ready for it.  The pelvic tilts were a nightmare -- too much arch in the lower back.

There's no instruction on how to do the exercises properly and without hurting yourself.

I'm glad I checked this out from the library and didn't waste my money on it.",1234224000,,435,4.320987654320987
8081783,5,B000B5XPJC,"What can I say... it is Jillian.  I love her toughness!!  I own all of her work-out DVDs (except beginners) and use them on a daily basis.  I am pretty buff for a woman in her mid 60s and I give Jillian some of the credit.  ALL of her work-outs are intense and give you the MOST bang for the buck (or time).  Her 30day Shred is KILLER!!!  I am in really good shape (ask my personal trainer) and this work-out leaves me completely exhausted..

GO Jillian!!!",1233100800,,456,4.172413793103448
8081784,3,B000B5XPJC,"This is a good work out if you can stand hearing her yell at people. I've watched the show and I know she gets results, just too much yelling for my taste.",1231977600,,155,3.875
