7974961,2,B00007BI1W,"I've seen a lot of British comedies via PBS and I've really liked Nicholas Lyndhurst in such series as ""Goodnight Sweetheart"", ""Butterflies"", and ""Only Fools and Horses"", but this just wasn't very funny.  End of story.",1347148800,,218,5.055555555555555
7974962,5,B00007BI1W,"Awesome comedy series. It's a good spoof of an ""intelligence"" agency (in this case - the MI5). Very well acted combining the best of comedy that the Brits are known for.",1232668800,,169,4.483870967741935
7974963,5,B00007BI1W,"The one time this series ran in Pittsburgh, we had to tape it because we kept missing lines as we roared with laughter. It has bargain basement production values, but the cast is uniformly wonderful.",1229040000,3,199,4.714285714285714

7974965,5,B00007BI1W,"I've been looking for this show on any medium for so long I was beginning to despair I'd ever find it! I got hooked on this Britcom several years ago when it was on the PBS station in our area. I think it's hilarious, and rather unique in some ways...but I don't claim to be unbiased, either.
The Piglet Files is about an electronics whiz who gets a job with MI5, the British intelligence agency. The characters include, among others:
- Peter Chapman, alias Piglet (played by Nicholas Lyndhurst), the aforementioned whiz who is very new to the intelligence game, and of course can never tell his wife what he REALLY does for a living
- Sarah Chapman (played by Serena Evans), Peter's loving and blissfully ignorant wife
- Major Maurice Drummond (Clive Francis), Peter's brownnosing boss
- Major Andrew Maxwell (John Ringham), Drummond's boss
- Dexter (Michael Percival), a fellow agent who's a likeable idiot
- Lewis (Steven Law), Dexter's partner, who fancies himself a lady's man
One memorable episode, ""Trouble With Reception,"" involves the agents and their wives being invited to a reception at an embassy, in which the wives find out they've all been told a different cover story for where their husbands work. (There is at least one female agent, but I forget whether or not she's married...) The embassy is besieged by terrorists, and Piglet and company must find a way to save the day without getting anyone hurt or giving away too much...
Another episode, ""Piglet In A Trough,"" finds Peter faking a gambling problem under orders from Drummond in order to find out whether Maxwell is a mole for the KGB.
The theme music, which I think is really cool and possibly the best music for a show of its type, was composed by Rod Argent, who, I'm told, had his own group, Argent, which was quite big in the 60's (I guess in the U.K. - their primary hit in the U.S. appears to have been ""Hold Your Head Up"" from 1972).
I could go on but I understand there's a word limit to these reviews. :) Let me just finish by saying I love this show and I'm beyond ecstatic to find it available through you folks. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!",1047772800,45,2134,4.5890052356020945
