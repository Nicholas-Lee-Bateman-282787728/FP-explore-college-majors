8062890,4,B0009L37FA,"This DVD was good. Not bad, not terrific...good. It was only an hour, but then again, it was but an episode in a series. It consisted of clips and interviews from Yentl, The Prince of Tides, and The Mirror Has Two Faces. The interviews were fine, but they never really seemed to reach beyond surface level, with the exception of Lauren Bacall's, and, of course, Barbra's. In my opinion, the Yentl segment was best, because Barbra spoke about her reasons for making the film, as well as her directing technique. Given the choice of buying this or Inside the Actors Studio, I'd choose the second option, but if you have money to spare and are interested in seeing what goes on behind the camera, this one's for you.",1219708800,2,713,4.578125
