2120856,5,B0002V7O1A,"Director Kinji Fukasaku's five part film set of ""The Yakuza Papers"" is an important addition to anyones Asian film library. A little background on Kinji Fukasaku might help those to understand why he chose to portray the yakuza as men without honor or decency. Prior to these films, most viewers were most often given the portrayal of the yakuza as having some sort of honor: A sort of 'Bushido Code' similar to the ways of the ancient Samurai. And there were many films which portrayed the yakuza in such a light. However, Kinji Fukasaku knew better. His portrayal of the yakuza is not the loyal and honorable men that many often viewed. In his nihilistic yakuza film ""Graveyard Of Honor"" his primary goal was to show the audience what really lay behind the unseen world of these thugs: For he knew them well.

In ""Graveyard Of Honor"" his primary focus was on the yakuza thug Rikio Ishikawa, who was as much a debased human as the yakuza outfit he belonged to. And being that Kinji Fukasaku was from the same village as Rikio Ishikawa, he must have seen a world few of us are privy to. And this is further evident in his yakuza films, as he does not portray them in an honorable light. Prior to these portrayals, one might see the casual to not so casual Zatoichi episode of Katsu Shintaro's disgust with such men, and many times in a comical light. However, in the ""Yakuza Papers"" Kinji Fukasaku dispels all myths that the yakuza are or were men of honor. The latest box set is well worth the purchase. I remember buying these one at a time years ago on VHS, and this Box set has done the series justice.

The first of this five part film epic introduces the viewer to what will be a 30 year long struggle of gang warfare in Japan after the bombing of Hiroshima. These are violent films, and Fukasaku does not spare the viewer as to how, why and where these thugs were able to rise to power after Japan's defeat in WWII. We are witness to betrayals, deceit and the methods of how the yakuza become organized. Everything in the yakuza clans were modeled along business lines--and we witness the so-called yakuza myth being destroyed. These are vicious gangs who will go through anyone, and everyone to get what the feel belongs to them. As for loyalty, forget about it, there is none. Many of those who started out with the yakuza after the war were former soldiers. One of these is the films primary protagonist Shozo Hirono (Bunta Suguwara). Shozo Hirono is a former soldier who is initiated into the gang after an altercation with another yakuza. As Shozo rises through the ranks, we see his character going through the motions of honor and loyalty--even though his superiors are not entirely of the same mode.

These films are available separately, or in this Boxed Version. I would recommend viewers obtain the Boxed version for several reasons. First, it is less expensive, and also, with the Boxed Version there is also an additional 6th DVD. This additional DVD gives numerous interviews about Fukasaku and his films, and in particular his use of violence in his films. Also, there is included a pretty good booklet by Patrick Macias. The five films that make up this epic are: 1.""Battles Without Honor & Humanity"" 2. ""Deadly Fight In Hiroshima"" 3. ""Proxy War"" 4. ""Police Tactics"" 5. ""Final Episode."" The transfers in all the films are very good--excellent in fact. Also, I have seen these films available in many video rental stores, so if you are hesitant, then you might want to rent them first. However, I HIGHLY recommend the Boxed set if you go ahead and decide to purchase them. [Stars: 5+]",1195516800,6,3606,4.63125
2120857,5,B0002V7O1A,"If you like gritty gangster movies, buy this boxed set right now. It is a shame that Fukasaku-san is no longer with us, he had a lot of lessons that he could have taught the people who produce and direct todays gangster-pablum. I have recently recieved these episodes from an online movie rental service, my interest in Fukasaku-san's films being piqued by ""Battle Royal"", and I was not disappointed.

The films are all brilliantly written and brilliantly directed.  When this is paired with the excellent job done by every actor/actress in the series, you are left with an extremely solid series.  What more can a film fan ask for?

If you are interested in Japanese film and culture, and as obsessed with organized crime (especially the Yakuza, the smoothest of criminals) as I am, you will love this series.  If you can't follow the fast paced storyline or the realistic violence:  Stay home!  This series is for the hardcore only.

Fans of mass-produced Hollywood/network T.V. garbage need not apply.",1172966400,2,1004,4.899408284023669
2120858,5,B0002V7O1A,"I loved these films. A classic set of Japanese yakuza movies for your own private viewing. It's so complex that it'll make the American Noir films look like Soap Operas. A little more violence than expected, The Yakuza Papers displays a cinematic dynamicity, that few movies had during the 70's. Clear portrayal of Japanese post-war, or should I say post-Nuclear era. A revolutionary masterpiece. Somebody said before that they ""look like a Sonny Chiba movie"", but it's quite the opposite. They look indeed very original and stylistically influencial.",1157760000,2,551,5.2727272727272725
2120859,5,B0002V7O1A,"This series is without a doubt the most important series of yakuza films ever to be made. Not only are the films socially important, but they are also masterpieces in filmmaking.

The series has an intriguing story which continues through all five films. Each film tells different parts of the same story, in chronological order, and for this reason I cannot help but consider the series to be one film, broken into five parts. The films were revolutionary because they were some of the first to depict the yakuza lifestyle as one without honor, as the title reveals. Films such as Pale Flower showed the emptiness of the yakuza lifestyle, but no film was as commanding as the Battles Without Honor series, which not only showed the emptiness, but also the brutality, destruction, and tragedy of the yakuza lifestyle. The message of the film is very in-your-face, because at the time almost every film glorified the gangster life and heroic bloodshed. In addition, the production quality of the series is very high and each film is very professionally made, with the filmmakers truly showing care and respect for their work. Each film provides a testament to the power of good storytelling and good filmmaking. This series is not just for yakuza fans, but for fans of all Japanese cinema, as well as fans of cinema in general. Though the series may portray a great gangster tale, they are also great films and the viewer need not be a fan of the genre.

This is yet again a wonderful presentation on the part of Home Vision Entertainment. The picture quality has really been cleaned up and the transfer is excellent. Another extremely important aspect of this release is that the subtitles have been newly translated, making the films much easier to understand than other versions. The box set also contains a bonus disc full of special features, which are not available with just the regular discs.

Overall, I highly recommend these films and this DVD series is the best way to see them.",1107302400,14,1989,4.809941520467836
2120860,5,B0002V7O1A,"""The Yakuza Papers"" consists of five sequential films made in the 1970s and only now making their U.S. debut, in this killer six-DVD set from Home Vision. Comparisons to the first two ""Godfathers"" seem inevitable, but ""Yakuza"" is a singular film experience -- deeply rewarding for those with the stomach for its kinetic violence; overwhelming in scope and complexity.

The set thoughtfully provides a printed chart that helps viewers track the Japanese crime families that do battle over the quarter-century covered in the series. They'll need it. ""Yakuza"" rarely pauses to allow for reflection -- this is a dizzying eight-hour hell-ride through a time and place as foreign as they come.

William Friedkin, whose talking-head interview kicks off the extras disc, calls director Kinji Fukasaku ""a master,"" comparing ""Yakuza Papers"" to James Joyce's ""Ulysses."" No doubt a contemporary influence on the frantic hand-held camerawork was Friedkin's own ""The French Connection,"" which the U.S. director says ""very easy could have been done by Fukasaku.""

Fukasaku looked past the stars of romanticized old-school yakuza films to find his lead, Bunta Sugawara, with whom he had just worked on ""Street Mobster"" (also out via Home Vision). No one in ""Yakuza"" gets off easy, but Sugawara's existential Hirono character comes closest to a traditional hero as he makes his way from the streets to the top of the underworld. More typical is weepy crime boss Yamamori (Nobuo Kaneko), a cross between Don Corleone and Floyd the barber.

Home Vision, which has busied itself importing gritty yakuza films, gives Fukasaku's epic first-class treatment, starting with a metal container and an artful fold-out for the discs. Video looks tremendous, coming from films of their era and budget, with almost no speckling or other overt wear. Aspect ratio is 2.35:1, enhanced for 16.9 TVs. There are a few scenes with flashes of polarization and occasional image stretching near the sides of the letterboxed frames. Mono audio is gun-metal solid.

One don't-miss extra is the interview with tough-talking translator Linda Hoaglund, who grew up in Japan as the daughter of missionaries. The films of ""Fukasaku-san"" were all about rage, she says. ""He's ripping the lid off Japanese society: 'Take a look -- it's wild here.' """,1104364800,56,2298,5.233695652173913
2120861,4,B0002V7O1A,"Kinji Fukasaku's series of films known as The Yakuza Papers is largely seen as the veteran filmmaker's answer to The Godfather. Grouped together, these five films are a towering achievement of visceral B-moviemaking at its finest. The very first image over the opening credits of Battles Without Honor and Humanity is that of a mushroom cloud. The dropping of two atomic bombs would forever change and shape Japan's history. It is an event that shaped and changed Fukasaku's life. It also informed many of his movies.

In a nice touch, a booklet is included that maps out the various clans, their significant members and their relation to each other over the course of all five films. This is extremely helpful to neophytes who have trouble remembering who's who and what happened when.

The bonus disc starts off with ""Friedkin on Fukasaku,"" an interview with the legendary director who talks about meeting Fukasaku. He recounts his impressions of the man and how his style of filmmaking differed from the masters of classic Japanese cinema (Ozu, Kurosawa, et al).

""Jitsuroku: Reinventing a Genre"" examines this sub-genre of Yakuza films in which the events are based on true stories or historical record.

""Boryoku: Fukasaku and the Art of Violence"" is an examination of how violence is depicted in his movies. There is interview footage with the man himself as he talks about expressing the violent and restless tendencies that came out of the postwar period.

""Kantoku: Remembering the Director"" features Fukasaku's son and two of his collaborators talking about what it was like to work with him.

David Kaplan, co-author of Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld, talks about the history and evolution of the Yakuza on the ""Kaplan on the Yakuza"" featurette.

Rounding out the extras is ""Translating Fukasaku"" with Linda Hoaglund talking about working on the subtitling into English of his movies.

For quite some time Home Vision has released some of the finest examples of Yakuza cinema. They've hit the mother load with this fantastic box set that features some of Fukasaku's best work. For people only familiar with his controversial swan song, Battle Royale, The Yakuza Papers is an exciting, crime epic influenced by the dropping of two atomic bombs that helped defeat Japan, bring about an end to World War II and shape the prevailing attitude of its people for years to come.",1103760000,17,2386,5.0534351145038165
2120862,5,B0002V7O1A,"Kinji Fukasaku rips apart the yakuza genre in this series of 5 films about the Hiroshima and Kansai underworld.  They're brutal and realistic, with violence, treachery and such a labyrinthine plot that the DVD set comes with a fold-out chart detailing the relationships between the characters and the various crime syndicates.

One can say without fear of exaggeration that these films, together, form a masteriece of Japanese cinema.  They have never before been released in America; the transfer and subtitles are excellent and the special features disk has some interesting documentaries.

Oh yeah and Toshiaki Tsushima's theme music is unforgettable.",1103500800,15,654,5.51
2120863,5,B0002V7O1A,"First off, I am a Japanese film afficianado.  I am an Akira Kurosawa nut, I own ALL of his films.......I own ALL of the Zatoichi films as well, and pretty much every decent Yakuza movie out there.

I was deseperately awaiting the Yakuza Papers on DVD, and I can say they do not disappoint!  This entire set of films piece together extremely well, and give you great insight into how the Yakuza world functions.

The acting is superb, the plot twists unexpected and it always keeps you guessing.  If you're not familiar with Japanese history/culture the reactions in certain situations may seem odd to you (for instance a Yakuza mob boss openly weeping in front of his soldiers), but this is about as authentic as it gets.

After watching all 5 films, I'm still in awe.  The FIRST film is a bit intese in the first 15 minutes, as it is focusing on the revival of VIOLENT Yakuza culture in Japan immediately after Japan's surrender to the US after WW2.  Get past that first 15 minutes, the films are not that bloody nor is the dialogue that grotesque.  I think the filmmaker was merely attempting to portray the insanity which was running rampant amongst both Japanese and American troops after the surrender.

I count this set of films as a single ""film"", and rank it right after Red Beard and Seven Samurai as my favorite Japanese film ever......and that's coming from someone who owns over 50 pre 1985 Japanese films.",1103241600,25,1418,4.636
2120864,2,B0002V7O1A,"i became aware of this title doing a search using the word ""yakuza"". i read the editorial reviews and customer reviews on amazon and elsewhere. references to ""the godfather"" had been made. so i pre ordered the box set. the release date had been put back which heighten my anticipation. once received even the packaging looked impressive. but less than (2) minutes into disc (1) something seemed familiar. the acting,the type of music score, the fake gun shot sound effects. i thought i was watching an old ""sonny chiba"" movie. i personally didn't see any relation between the high praise in the reviews and the film itself. the acting wasn't believable. everybody is entitle to their own opinion but to use words like ""the godfather"" and ""take a ruthlessly de-romanticized view of the underworld"" is almost comical. when i think of serious japanese films  it's ""harakiri"",""throne of blood"", ""high and low"" and ""stray dog"" not the old ""street fighter"" movies. my advise for what it's worth, if you've never seen these films (rent them first or buy one disc at a time).",1103155200,17,1067,4.862637362637362

These films have tons of intersting characters. Also one of the best things about these movies is that each scene is set up by a narrator; which really helps in following the faced paced storylines.  Shocking at times, these films are very well made and very very entertaining.  Any fans of HK action will love these movies.

8032162,4,B0002V7O1A,"The First Part: Battles Without Honour and Humanity (the 1st part of the 5 part Yakuza Papers series) is no classic of Japanese Cinema but it is a gripping insight into the Yakuza gangs and gang warfare. Following Shozo Hirono a man who starts out as foot soldier in an escalating gang war; torn between loyalty to a weak Yakuza Godfather known as Yamamori and another gang. Shozo Hirono is is a somewhat sympathetic character and remains a observer as the violent gang wars rage and surprisingly spends most of his time in jail as the film follow different gang coups and wars. So it would be fair to say the film is less about Hirono and more about the whole Yakuza world.

The Second Part: Deadly Fight In Hiroshima is just as gripping as the first but the hero of the first film Shozo Hirono takes a bit of back role while somebody else takes centre stage: we follow Shoji Yamanaka a weak loner who ends becoming a hitman for Muraoka, the biggest Yakuza boss in Hiroshima, and falling in love with his niece. the hero from the first film does appear half-way through as observer of Yamanaka's situation as they cross paths. Just as good as the first one this second part boasts a fast-paced plot the same delve into the Yakuza and personal touch with introduction Yamanaka's character.

The Third Part: Proxy War, unfortunately,is the weakest in the series our focus shifts back to Shozo Hirono who has his own small yakuza family protecting a scrap yard but things change as the second in command of Hiroshima's biggest yakuza gang is assassinated and the boss Muraoka steps down triggering a rush for the power as Yamamori has his eyes on the prize. Hirono must do some manoeuvring to ally himself with the strongest in order to survive. This film is weakest due to it's plot which goes back and forth: tempers rise between two gangs and we are on the edge of war when suddenly it is diffused; then later again a war is about break out but is again diffused, leaving the film to never explode into the violent gang war the title suggests. What is also laughable is two main yakuza bosses burst into tears on the slightest provocation is just idiotic. Worth a watch for the sake of completion this sequel is average yet no way as good as the first two.

The Fourth Part: Police Tactics, is a improvement on the weak Proxy War and is set during Tokyo 1963 Olympics it picks up with a more exciting plot, in the beginning both sides Yamamori and Hirono each gathering troops together and waiting for a incident to spark full-scale war; but their plans are hampered by heavy Police crackdowns on all the Yakuza gangs from heavy pressure from the public. Although that doesn't stop hot-headed youths planned and exacting assassination attempts as Hirono finally plans to take out Yamamori (a big change for his usual inaction in the previous instalments). More happens in this fourth chapter and it boasts more action and a exciting plot that makes this a must see and much better than the Third Part.

The Fifth Part: The Final Chapter closes the long series, A large Tensei coalition is formed between all the Yakuza gangs in order to avoid more wars. But when the experienced leader is sent to prison and a much younger but nevertheless smart yakuza takes over, a divide is spilt as some of the older yakuza plan to take over. At the centre of the film is the clash between the older yakuza who became big in the forties and now find themselves slightly redundant as the younger more with it yakuza of seventies modern generation take charge.

In the time The Yakuza Papers was released in the 70s it was a quite a change of pace for Yakuza films: gone are the noble heroes driven by honour and who uphold the Yakuza Codes such as in Theater of Life (1965), Brutal Tales of Chivalry (1965) or The Wolves (1971) and in are Yakuzas without nobility or honour; but even though this may be true to most of the characters it is not to the main character Hirono as he is one the few to actually uphold and respect the code even if some yakuza do not deserve it (Yamamori).

The films are also enjoyable for their fast pace and intricate power struggles and plans  and can become confusing and complex and you can lose track of the plot but the boxset comes with a helpful booklet recounting the deaths and different gangs present in each part and this is far better than Senju Suzuki's incoherent and idiotic Yakuza films. My only gripe with the series is the gun shots sound fake and we never see any large scale gang battles (with exception of a gripping attack by Sonny Chiba's mad dog with his gang in Part II) the action is mostly confined to assassination attempts and attacks. Lastly some of the reviewers claim these films are comparable to the Godfather this is a totally misguided comment this series has none of the elegance, intelligence or pathos or The Gofather but this series is not trying to be a classic it is only a entertaining gangster series nothing more. Home Vision Transfer is brilliant and nicely remastered with a very good English subtitle translation, in conclusion whether bought separately or as the boxset this is much watch for Yakuza fans.",1345766400,2,5171,4.583783783783784
8032163,5,B0002V7O1A,"As a Toei studio director, Kinji Fukasaku made a wide variety of films, everything from period swordplay epics, to lurid romances and science-fiction horror.  And although he is probably best known in the west for the enormous success of his final film, Battle Royale, it's his work in the gangster genre, the yakuza movie, that Fukasaku best demonstrates his ability to consider the relationship between society and violence, while making some of his most dynamic, entertaining and influential films.

There's still some ambiguity around the question of gangster `giri-ninjo', the code of honour to their boss and even respect for rival gangsters, in some of his preceding films (Japan Organised Crime Boss, Street Mobster) that glamorises their activities to a large extent.  By the time Fukasaku came to make his epic Yakuza Papers in 1973, a series of five full-length feature films detailing the power struggles of rival yakuza families in post-war cities of Kure and Hiroshima, the social context is better defined, and there's no mistaking the nature of the violence that erupts out of the slums of the ruins of the atom-bombed city.  As the English subtitle translates the original Japanese title, these are Battles without Honor and Humanity - there is no honour among thieves here.

Given five full-length films to expand the story, one would expect there to be greater clarity than there actually is in the complicated sequence of alliances and betrayals that exist between the rival yakuza gangs in Hiroshima, but rather than aim for a simplified version of events, Fukasaku shows the whole thing in all its complexity.  Notionally based around one main gangster, Shozo Hirono (the marvellous Bunta Sugawara) and his complicated relationship with the Yamamori clan, the five films of the Yakuza Papers in actuality take in a number of views, with many different characters rising to prominence before meeting their inevitable fate of being gunned down in an ignominious manner in a public street, brothel or bar.

The whole series adds up to what Fukasaku biographer Sadao Yamana describes in the extra features to this set as, ""compelling chaos"", and much of the reason why the viewer is compelled to see the events through the often complex relationships and alliances (none of which are in reality bound by any kind of sense of honour or anything other than self-preservation), is down to Fukasaku's incredibly dymanic technique.  Filmed in its entirety over only 35-40 days, the films are however incredibly well shot and edited, using all the techniques at the director's disposal - freeze-frames, oblique angles, on-screen captions - showing the influence of French New Wave in its hand-held cameras that jump right into the action, drawing the viewer in with them.

The US 6-disc DVD set from Homevision does its best to make this terrific and highly influential set of films accessible for the viewer, with booklets, essays and a whole disc of interviews that try to get to the secret of Fukasaku's brilliance.  The films themselves look fine, in their correct widescreen ratio, anamorphically enhanced, boldly coloured and showing no marks or damage, showing only some minor compression artefacts.  These are much better than the treatments that the UK releases of Fukasaku's other gangster films have been subjected to, and a fine way to see a terrific set of films.",1286236800,,3388,5.130671506352087

8032165,4,B0002V7O1A,"Altho this Fukusaku directed 5 part series defined a major transition in the style of the Japanese yakuza movie, IMO it falls way short of being comparable to ""The Godfather"" trilogy. Lacking the informational depth and emotional involvement of the players and their lives that Coppola presents, ""The Yakuza Papers"" limits its scope to the repetive and predictable actions of a bunch of thugs. Treacherous ambush shootings and bully gang beatings beget more of the same on & on thru 5 separate movies. There is a somewhat admirable for loyalty & integrity protagonist well played by Bunta Sugawara who's involvement is often background due to his constantly being in lock up or restrained by parole, plus often avoiding double-cross participation. The pacing of the film makes for good action entertainment, but like ""Friday the 13th"" there are just so many formula episodes one can take before boredom sets in. In fact, the separate sequel 6th ""New Battles Without Honor & Humanity"" completely failed to rekindle further interest even with the efforts of the charismatic Sugawara, especially with his portraying a different character than his original Hirono. Besides Sugawara, there are a multitude of great performances by Hiroki Matsukata, Kinya Kitaoji, Sonny Chiba, Noboru Ando, and many other Yakuza movie ""stars"". Well worth watching, but don't expect ""The Godfather"".",1235433600,2,1376,5.31651376146789
8032166,5,B0002V7O1A,"This is a great 5-part series detailing the rise of the Yakuza in post-war Japan, more or less based upon real events.  Forget about wide-shots:  Director Kinji Fukasaku starts with action and keeps it going through all five chapters with hyper-kinetic camera work that was pretty much the opposite of what Kurosawa and Ozu had done in the past couple of decades.  You are not observing it from a distance, you (and the camera lens) are RIGHT in the middle of it.. and it's happening all around you, for all five chapters.  All this was done long before today's of better-than-real special effects and CGI.

Along with the untraditional camera work, Fukasaku parts ways with another hallmark of the previous 20-years of Yakuza movies:  Forget about chivalrous men in Kimonos.  The title of the first film, ""Battles without Honor & Humanity"" lets you know what to expect.  Bunta Sugawara plays Hirono, the protagonist criminal around whom all of the action and gang-politics swirls.  He's the closest thing to a 'good guy' in this tale of corruption, shifting loyalties, rapidly depleting codes of 'honor' and the constant elbowing and self-promotion that led to the way things still are today.  'Sounds like your workplace?  At least your day doesn't end with a harpoon through your foot!

Around the same time in the mid-1970's, Fukasaku also directed other, similar ""Cops'n'Yakuzas"" movies that are not part of the ""Yakuza Papers"" narrative, but nevertheless make great side-stories: ""Street Mobster"", ""Sympathy For The Underdog"", ""Cops Versus Thugs"" (with Sugawara on the other side of the badge), ""Yakuza Graveyard"".  Great flicks.

Fukasaku may have been influenced by what was happening in action flicks coming from Hong Kong and Hollywood, and perhaps by ""Blaxploitation"":  He responds by draining the glory & heroism out of violence & revenge, and presenting it in gruesome, painful detail.

HIGHLY recommended!",1208995200,,1919,5.181818181818182
