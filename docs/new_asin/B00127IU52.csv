Informative and a little advanced for preschoolers. But the pictures of cats and dogs are there. They are friendly, too. Have names as I recall.
But the 'story time' is not really there. Just a nice film. For kids. And animals. I even could get through it. Ha-ha.",1392249600,,436,4.4625
8244426,5,B00127IU52,"""The Cat Connection"" and ""The Canine Conspiracy"" take a matter-of-fact approach to our beloved animals, offering insight and clarity about their behaviors and desires. The documentaries have a warm romantic flair, especially the feline half of this pairing, but it's all free of the gushing, cutesy fare that saturates the internet. Instead there is an honest, restrained look at our pets as animals, descended from the wild and bred by our ancestors. It's a gem from the early days of HD video, before reality shows took over cable. I'm glad to see new copies for sale.",1381104000,3,570,4.947916666666667
