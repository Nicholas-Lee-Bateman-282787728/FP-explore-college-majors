8579538,3,B00CAZOIFQ,"A entertaining B western of 1948 that was a  rare treat and great trivia question - a western based on a Robert Louis Stevenson story ""Silverado Squaters"".  In this tale Edgar Barrier plays stagecoach passenger Robert Louis Stevenson who helps prevent a hanging in Silverado.  The main star in this is William Bishop, not Fred Sears as listed in these credits, who plays a stage coach driver who was just traveling through Silverado and gets pulled into a stagecoach race with Forrest Tucker.  It goes awry and he finds himself stranded in Silverado and befriended by a helpful doctor Edgar Buchanan while a mysterious bandit ""The Monk"" is working the area.  Decent western and worth a watch.",1419465600,,692,4.880341880341881
