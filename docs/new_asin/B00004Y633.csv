The only thing that they did right that i liked was to show from the beginning the exact origin of the french toymaker's life and the history of the configuration box and that was it, there's nothing original about this movie, pinhead, the cenobites and the hell demension itself are very much non existent in this entry, they should have stopped making any more from this point - avoid at all cost",1364083200,,586,4.385321100917431
1371986,4,B00004Y633,"So you just finished watching Hellraiser 3 Hell on earth, and your wondering to yourself, what happened to my pinhead?! Where has the creepiness gone? Why is pinhead smiling and laughing like hes happy or some crap? Whats with the really horribly done cenobites? Camera? CD?Pistonhead? WTF. And ultimately is the fourth sequel even worth a watch? Well my fiends of pain and pleasure. It Is very worth a watch. In fact its most likely the best in the series of sequels following the incredible first two movies. Which of course cannot be topped. If you are willing to get past the fact that the first act, narrative and final act are taking place in space and in the future, say about a hundred years from now than you will love this movie. For the remainder of the film we are treated to beautifully Gothic atmosphere and effects. In the old timey France scenes and 1996 U.S. scenes. The future scenes aren't bad either mind you, they are just kind of devoid of any true hellraiser creepiness besides the cenobites, pinhead and dark corridoors. But thats not to say they weren't enjoyable, they were. I especially like the Chatter Hound as its called, you'll think ""hell hound"" instantly. Pinhead, yes old Pinhead is back and in true form this time. Gone is the happy pinhead of Hellraiser 3 and what we have here is much more like the original characterization. Doug Bradley does an excellent job in this movie, I cant blame him for three because he had no control over the dialogue or story choices. The young man playing a triple role as teh box maker is pretty good too. I do like to personally think of just the first two movies when I think of Hellraiser and keep much a mystery in my mind as to preserve that style of logic and everything else the first two had going for them. I didn't need to know where the box came from, who made it ect. Mystery and the unknown are two of the greatest tools in fear and curiosity. But instead of it being beamed to earth straight from hell, this was a good a story for it as any and I suppose more realistic? you be the judge on that. Either way, if youve got nothing else to watch thats original, pop this bad boy in the dvd/blu-ray/vhs (yeah I still have a vhs player :P )suspend your rabid fanboy love of the first two movies for an hour and twenty something minutes and ENJOY!",1347753600,,2325,4.434579439252336
1371987,3,B00004Y633,"Bloodline had what the previous film did not, an interesting story! It was really cool to see the beginnings of the box and the how and why it was made. I think that if the movie had focused on those early years and the future, skipping ""present day"" 1996, it would have been a lot better. There just wasn't much to the middle of the story that had to be really said or really needed. Besides that, I really liked the movie. The only thing about the ending that I didn't like was how it just ended with no real epilogue. Overall, pretty good.",1327795200,,542,4.221153846153846
1371988,4,B00004Y633,"Each Hellraiser is very different than the other, this can't be denied. Not being directed by Clive Barker, you can obviously tell because of the way the story is told.
In the original Hellraiser, the Cenobites were there to collect what they came for. In the second, they still were, but were more evident in the movie and seen more. In Hell on Earth, they were more bringers of chaos and had more of a ""monster"" role, with the exception of Pinhead- you knew he was still just plain evil, but with a slightly different role. Killing those who DIDNT open the box, but still a good movie.
Bloodline.. different style again, just like the third movie, but not bad. It brings an explanation of the actual origin of the ""puzzle box"", and how the relative of an ancestor was determined to finish another box to destroy what the original box unleashed.

The Sci-fi twist was a little unexpected with the laser guns/rifles and what not, but once you look past all the hackey sci-fi effects and actually take the movie in as an explanation of how it all began, it definitely lends itself as a great sequel. The later movies generally depicted Pinhead and the Cenobites as background figures and didn't have a lot to do with the original storyline.

You should definitely give this movie a shot.",1301961600,,1286,4.611353711790393

1371991,2,B00004Y633,"Pin head is back. This story tells how the box was created and what pin head plans on doing with it. It spans three generations and tells the story of one families quest to shut pin head and his plans down for good.

The cons

I love the actor who portrays pin head Doug bradley he almost makes this picture worth watching alone. You finally get some back story on the cube and why it was created and how. You get informtion on what it's purpose really is in this film. The story line is some what intersting with 3 different generations of male family members being involved in creating the toy box and trying to stop pin heads plans. The picture has a few interesting kills in it and some gore as well for horror fans. You also have two other new cenobites that were some what interesting like the two who are joined together.

The cons.
 The new cenobites aren't as interesting as the ones in the first two film by a long shot. They look pretty generic to be honest and could have been characters from the borg in star trek the next generation. Doud bradley is awesome,but the rest of the cast leaves me wanting. It's like they picked people up at wallmart and asked if they wanted an acting job. The picture does have a few intersting kills,but the level of blood,gore violence and sexuality is toned way down from the first two films. I was kind of disapointed by that as this is the first hellraiser film I've watched in years besides the first two. Also the idea of setting parts of it in the future on a space ship doesn't work for me. It was only a small part of the film,but doesn't fit right in my opinion. Also the budget for this film must have been lower than the first two as the effects look much worse. One guys shooting laser beams at pin head in the end made me laugh. It looked worse that the effects on the original star trek tv show. Maybe their is another version with some special features on it,but the copy I purchased has very little. You don't get any directors commentary or any behind the scenes stuff at all. This would have been a nice thing to have as I usually enjoy watching those things. The only thing I got was some previews of other films.

All in alll a decent film,but it doesn't live up to the first two film at all. I can't suggest this to any one and I'm a big fan of the first two films. Also I ca't understand the high rating some of the fans here are giving this film. It doesn't deserve any more that two stars at best.

Bloodline is just what it intimates, it is the history of Hellraiser beginning with the making of the first box and ending with the probable end of Pinhead, the entity that the series is about.

BLOODLINE properly returns the plot back to the original Hellraiser mythos, but can't resist some of the same wacky excesses that made HELL ON EARTH such a horrible movie.  The film has three basic parts, each of them following a member of the Merchant family (all of them played by Bruce Ramsey).  The original Merchant was a toymaker living in Paris, and he unwittingly(!) designed and created the puzzle box that opens the gates to hell.  Whoopsie.  It turns out that now he and his entire bloodline are cursed unless they can destroy the evil that they have unleashed.

The second story follows the 1996 version of Merchant, now an architect plagued by strange dreams.  He battles with Pinhead, but not successfully enough to keep him from tangling with yet another ancestor, this one living on a space station in 2172.  Or maybe it's 2271.  Either way, the future.

The portrayal of three different eras was a good idea, but it's done through a series of flashbacks and history lessons provided by the Future Merchant as he is being interrogated in his space station by the beautiful but horribly named Rimmer (Christine Harnos in a sadly extraneous role).  This constant switching from the future to the past makes the delivery uneven, chunks of the plot having to make way for clumsy blocks of poorly-written exposition.

But the bare bones are there, as are the meatier, bloodier elements to every Hellraiser movie.  This was the first Hellraiser movie I ever saw, back when it was released theatrically in '96, and it was -- at that time -- the first movie I ever walked out on.  Not that I thought it was bad; I simply couldn't handle how scared it made me (the scene that did me in: when Pinhead attacks the twin security guards).  I've seen a lot more since then, so I was able to sit through it this time around, but it made me squeamish all the same.  Not quite as classy as the movies that spawned it, BLOODLINE is at least as scary.  Sometimes, with movies like these, that's all that matters.",1227484800,,2830,5.60093896713615

1371999,2,B00004Y633,"Hellraiser: Bloodline (Alan Smithee, 1996)

Somehow, despite the fact that I have seen every other film in the Hellraiser franchise, no matter how awful (and the two most recent are movies that try their best to redefine that term in the language of the critic), I somehow managed to miss seeing Bloodline until last week. Eleven years after its release, it is likely best remembered for being disowned by its director (Kevin Yagher, a wonderful make-up artist whose work has recently been seen in the TV show Bones) and released under the Alan Smithee moniker used for films that have suffered such a fate. And now that I have seen it, I understand why Yagher would have had his name taken off this. Bloodline is a terrible, terrible movie, but it is a terrible movie that, in its original state, was probably a very good one.

This installment of the Hellraiser series interweaves three storylines set in different times, with three protagonists from the Merchant family, all played by Bruce Ramsay (Killing Zoe). Set against the various Merchants is Angelique (Valentina Vargas of The Name of the Rose), a princess of Hell called forth when the first Merchant's patron uses the infamous Chinese puzzle box (designed by said Merchant) for the first time. The first story details the creation of the box. The second, which takes place not long after the end of Hellraiser 3, in the building we see at the end of that movie. The architect, Merchant's great-great-ish grandson, must battle Pinhead for the lives and souls of his wife and son. The third story, which takes place in the future, has the third Merchant on a space vessel, trying to create the design the first Merchant created centuries ago that will undo the damage the box has done.

It all sounds rather Corinthian in its design, and it is, but to be fair, it all plays out pretty well; there's no sense of overcomplication in the actual movie. The problem is, what we got seems to be an outline of the original; it's well-known that the studios slashed a great deal out of it (how much only Yagher knows, and he isn't telling yet), focusing on the action and the gore instead of the characters, who might well be interesting if given a chance. Not that the acting is all that hot; Ramsay wanders around looking kind of clueless most of the time, while Vargas doesn't have much to do but vamp around and look good. (I must say, though, she is quite good at doing so.) Note, however, that one of the new cenobites (the twins) is played by Michael and Mark Polish, the guys behind the twisted and wonderful Twin Falls Idaho. They are the exception to the rule here; they're playing dunderheads, and they play the roles very well.

I really have to reserve judgment on this one until I've seen a director's cut, which I'm hoping will be released when the Hellraiser remake shows up in 2008. Until then, I'm inclinced to give it not as terrible a rating as I normally would, since what we got and what the director seemed to have in mind are such entirely different beasts. Blame the awfulness of this movie solely on the Weinsteins, and give Yagher another chance. **",1189987200,,3129,4.64259927797834
1372000,5,B00004Y633,"I love the Hellraiser series up to and including Bloodlines. The plots are original and make you think. The villians lead by pinhead are good. Demon with nails in his head is quite original. Pinhead is looking to close the doorway to hell so he can roam free on earth and create darkness, pleasure/pain and crush the puzzle box. The only one who can stio him is the Merchant family. His bloodline built the box. The movie takes place in a few centuries and ends up in the future where Dr. Merchant and Pinhead battle it out on a spaceship. You got to love the one liners by Pinead in all the movies. In this one....Dr, Merchant tricks Pinhead into thinking he's on the ship when in fact he is on a shuttle craft to take him back to earth.

As my subject line of my review states. Being a huge fan of I and II - I've looked upon later movies in the franchise with a leery eye. Too much of good thing spoils the flesh.

Pleasingly, this one isn't a hour and 20 some minutes wasted. The story at times is engaging and demands your attention. As in many of my reviews, I'll avoid the already reviewed ground of the plot and offer my insights.

The opening scenes of ""Hellraiser in Space"" at first, I almost turned the movie off. But then, something said give it a chance so off I went.  I'm generally not a fan of flashback sequences. This one however was well done. The flashbacks provided pivotal backstory as to the events of 2127 and what lead to events on the space station.

I agree with the statements that the Merchant men should've been played by different actors. One face spanning the generations. Don't buy it. Different cast actors would've made it more believable.

Using seduction instead of pain in competing Demon styles was interesting. Although Pinhead gets the last line and laugh there. He was on target with terror vs. seduction.

My favorite scene when the one black man's skin on his face is completely torn off. Just gorgeously gorey. It was quick and brutal. Pinhead wasn't in the mood for a long play session. ;)

Overall the story holds my interest. However, with the removal of Pinhead which largely *is* the franchise these days. It becomes much weaker.

Thats where my criticism comes in. I've never been able to get past in II when Pinhead gets killed.  The good doctor reduces him to a mortal, then offs him. I know he comes back in the end of II with the rotating column - translation sequel.  However, after Pinhead's and the Cenobytes deaths in that film. That left an impression of finality.

To resurrect Pinhead for go around after go around. Its turned the Hellraiser franchise into too much of a good thing. It lost its special touch I and II had.

1372017,2,B00004Y633,"Nobody in Hollywood would deny that the movie business is War. And as we all know from General Sherman, War is Hell.

First-time director Kevin Yagher found that out the hard way. When studio chiefs brought in Joe Chappelle to fill in what they thought were gaps in the movie, Yagher walked off the set, pulled his name from this fourth Hellraiser installment and cursed it to movie development Hell, branding it with the ultimate shame of having been directed by ""Alan Smithee"", the Hollywood calling card of a disaffected director.

Frankly, I think Yagher acted prematurely---""Bloodline"" is flawed, one of the weakest of the brooding ""Hellraiser"" franchise---but taken on its own terms, it bumps and grinds quite nicely and sheds plenty of the red sauce along the way.

""Bloodline"" is an entertaining little wallow in the ghoulish legendry of the hellish Cenobites, their tormented minions, and the earthly conjurers who hope to bring the Demons into the material world for gain and glory, and end up giving ""body piercing"" a whole new meaning.

""Bloodline"" feels like a film created by committee, which is exactly what it turned out to be. It is uneven, jumping from scene to scene in fits and starts; it's evident that Yagher's vision was unfulfilled and his contempt justified.

The film begins on a space station, with Science Officer Dr. Paul Merchant (played by French Canadian actor Bruce Ramsay, who does a stellar turn with all of the Le Merchant/Merchant roles) interrupted by a security team while trying to summon the demonic Cenobites using a high-tech version of the infamous Lament Configuration.

Interrogated by one of the marines (played by the lovely but underused Christine Harnos), Merchant reveals that he is the last in a bloodline of inventors and scientists, and that his ancestor Phillip Le Merchant was a fabled 18th century French toymaker who first created the hellish Lament Configuration.

Here's my advice: while I bought ""Bloodline"" for its gaudy, gory imagery and style, I would rent it and watch the first 40 minutes, if only for the fact that Yagher commits to celluloid some of the most graphic, stylish, erotic and disturbing images ever filmed.

The story of the toymaker's design and delivery of the wicked box to a French nobleman, hedonist and sadist (played to the wild-eyed feverish hilt by Mickey Cottrell) is both hellacious and eerily beautiful, shot in natural light, the candles and firelight glittering on a palette of flesh, bone and blood. It is beautiful stuff, and I can see why Yagher resigned in disgust when his vision was commandeered by Chapelle.

Oh, and Chilean actress Valentina Vargas is glorious as the demoness Angelique, with or without skin: she can rend my flesh any day of the week.

Other than that, ""Bloodline"" is forgettable: we move from Le Merchant to his 20th century architect descendant and a skyscraper crammed with Cenobites, and thence to the haunted space station. While some reviewers have complained that the gory sequence in which two hapless twin security guards are transformed is both gratuitous and brings the movie to a halt, I enjoyed it: it's a wickedly bloody, gory piece in prime Hellraiser style. Finally, Douglas Bradley is in fine form as Pinhead---but then again, when isn't he?

For the hardcore Hellraiser fan, buy this DVD---if you don't have it in your collection already. For the casual gorehound, a rental might suffice, if only to savor the supple, gorgeous, haunting 18th century prologue. For filmmakers, it's a prime example of how not to go about making a horror movie.

1372018,5,B00004Y633,"The fourth chapter of the brilliant ""Hellraiser"" cycle takes place in the past - with the origin of the first puzzle box that would later be used to call forth the Cennobites - , in the approximate present (i.e. between ""Hell On Earth"" and ""Hellraiser: Inferno"") -, and in the distant future - with, well one can't very well go into that as it's toward the end of the movie.  The titular ""Bloodline"" follows the cursed descendants (/reincarnations?) of the inventor of the original cube which, along with its replicas, would come to wreak Hell upon Earth time and again over the centuries, told of in whispers and with little physical evidence, because it's a rare human that ever lives to tell of the Cennobites.

Although apparantly originally intended to be more evenly distributed between the time periods (as it is, the present occupies the lion's share of the screen time) it nonetheless came out perfectly in this form.  On one hand, I would be keenly interested in seeing an extended version expanding on the past and future elements; on the other I'd be hesitant - it's outstanding as it is and would extensions change it too much?  The outcomes of the segments are unexpected, perhaps as a result of having more than one scenario to delve into, and new cast members - both Cennobite, human, and other - are excellent additions to the pantheon of players in the overall cycle; Doug Bradley of course returns as Pinhead and brings with him a seldom rivaled, and Never surpassed screen prescence of dark power.

1372019,4,B00004Y633,"There was some initial uncertainty when ""Hellraiser: Bloodline,"" the fourth feature film in the series spawned by Clive Barker's 1987 film, starts off in outer space in the 22nd century (I was probably not alone in having flashes of Pinhead meeting Jason Vorhees).  Then there is the fact that director Kevin Yagher felt compelled to use the Alan Smithee appellation for his credit in this 1996 offering, which is an even worse sign.  But the future is simply the setting for an end game that goes all the way back to the 18th century and the creation of the puzzle box that allows human beings to access the Cenobites.

The bloodline of the title refers to the family of Philip L'Merchant (Bruce Ramsey), the toy maker who put together the puzzle box (a.k.a. the ""Lament Configuration box"").  His descendant John Merchant (Bruce Ramsey) makes an even bigger puzzle box, and the last descendant, Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsey), has to try and put a stop to all of the madness on space station Minos in the year 2127.  This is where we begin, with what looks like a skinny version of the Terminator robot holding the puzzle box.  Then an inter-galactic SWAT team shows up and stops Dr. Merchant, the designer of the space station, from doing whatever the hell he is doing.  This requires the doctor to tell his story to Rimmer (Christine Harnos), the woman holding the big gun to his head.  He assures her that when he is done telling his story, he will be allowed to finish what he has started.

This movie takes the approach that once Pinhead (Doug Bradley) shows up you have to be in the final act of the film because coming up with new things for him to do that are really cool is too hard to do.  He does come up with a great line when his appearance compels one of the Merchants to invoke the deity: ""Do I look like someone who cares about what God thinks?""  Pinhead also offers some interesting musings on temptation being an illusion and pain being a shadow, so scriptwriter Peter Atkins gets points for getting the lingo right even if he is connecting the dots too quickly to get from one time period to the next.  But Pinhead is kept on the sidelines for most of the film and in the limelight is Angelique (Valentina Vargas), a Cenobite who takes human form and an interest in the Merchant family and its continuing relationship with the puzzle box.  This adds value to when Pinhead finally shows up, but not even a sexy Cenobite in human form is going to be half as interesting.

Yagher disowned the film because Miramax cut some scenes and brought in Joe Chappelle to re-shoot some other scenes.  Even so, ""Hellraiser: Bloodline"" at least reaffirms that ""Hellraiser III: Hell On Earth"" is the absolute nadir in the series, which is now up to eight movies.  For those who look forward to the point in the ""Hellraiser"" movies when it is ""time to play,"" there is plenty of blood, gore, and flying chains.  The new Cenobites are not up to the standard of the original group, but are also superior to those of ""Hell on Earth.""  Maybe it is because I have not seen a ""Hellraiser"" movie in so long and have not worked out the complete metaphysics of the Cenobite reality, but I thought this one was good enough to end up rounding up on it.",1118102400,,3245,4.508532423208191
1372020,4,B00004Y633,"For all that I like the Hellraiser series it has never set the bar in horror films.  There is a lot of imagination behind tham, but more often than not acting or effects have acted as limitations.  'Bloodline' is a bit different though, and while still laboring a bit under a casting shortage (the evil count is one of the worst characterizations I've ever seen) the story is genuinely interesting, there's just enough gruesome and gothic, and the script is sometimes quite intelligent.

The plot focuses on the l'Merchant family (the makers of the original box/doorway to hell).  The story starts on what seems to be a derelict space station, where the latest Merchant (played by Bruce Ramsey) is doing something mysterious with the proverbial little puzzle box.  He is interrupted by an team come to investigate the apparent hijacking of the station.  His efforts to explain the history of the box and the reason for his actions take us first to 18th Century Paris where the box is first made and Angelique (demon #1) invoked.  Then we head for 1996 where a young architect nearly makes a monumental box and Pinhead (demon #2) makes his entry.

Finally, we return to the station in 2127, where the latest Merchant is trying to destroy both the box, and the demons it summons.  While the Paris episode is mostly just plain bloody, the remaining stories have real plots, and Pinhead (played by Doug Bradley) does a bang up job of being both horrible and intelligent.  Thus you get all your basic urges satisfied, learn some of the background story behind all the films, and get a bit of demonic philosophy as well.

I'm tempted to say that this could very easily be the best of the Hellraisers.  This is due primarily to Bradley's job as Pinhead.  Grotesque, but with an austere nobility, he fascinates and repels at the same time.  He delights in his soulless state (""Do I look like someone who cares about what God thinks?""), wielding pain the same way Angelique tries to seduce, but with considerably more effect.  Just for a moment you may find yourself tempted by the emptiness he represents.",1117497600,,2097,4.738292011019284
1372021,5,B00004Y633,"I enjoyed this film immensely. Sometimes the reviews by so called  fans of a franchise just make me wonder if I saw the same film.
Anyways, the wrap  around sequence  occurs in a space outpost, where a descendent of the creator of the Puzzle box ( the ""Gateway"") is determined to implement a solution to the gateway box, which was also designed by the creator of the box.
However, the solution cannot be implemented since the technology does not allow it. It is only when computers come about, that the advent of the solution occurs.
I am at a loss to understand why people have called this film plotless, since the film has probably the second most complicated film plot in the series next to the second film HELLBOUND.
This film opens up enough mythos to have a large pool of resources for future stories in many forms. In fact, Clive Barker has said that the franchise is largely in the hands of other people, since it basically has assumed a life of its own. Clive Barker was not unavailable due to costs, but ( as I understand it) for creative  reasons.
The story, I would suggest, maintains a high standard, and maybe it could be improved on some points, but since I find the film very enjoyable, it seems the wrong attitude.
The ""Evil""  which is now separate from the original spirit ( as depicted in the third film) ranges through time, and provides a view of hell as it was, and hell as it is. For example, it is shown that Hell was much less ordered in the time of ""Angelique""... the demon created in the original  time frame of the ""birth"" of the box. And it is fascinating that the young disciple who assumes command of ""Angelique"" lives for many  centuries up unto the time of the Architect. And the Architect creates what Pinhead calls an Apocalypse  waiting  to happen. And in the final space sequence, we see Pinheads  ""essence""  exposed in a ""death"" statement... where Pinhead says "" I am so exquisitely empty"".
The structure and demonology of this film is first rate.
Enjoy.",1112054400,,1992,4.5363128491620115
1372032,4,B00004Y633,"The Hellraiser franchise holds a special place in my heart. I will never forget the first time I saw the opening chapter in the series of films inspired by Clive Barker's nightmarish visions. Watching the original ""Hellraiser"" now is a mixed bag-some of those special effects look a bit hokey, but others still come across as chillingly effective. Who can forget the glistening visage of Uncle Frank? The lascivious Julia? Or the first appearance of the ominous and verbose Pinhead? The second installment improved on the first, as the film whisked the viewer away to the abode of Pinhead and the Cenobites. A gruesome, perverse picture, ""Hellbound: Hellraiser 2"" raised the expectations about future entries to a fever pitch. Up next came ""Hellraiser 3,"" a personal favorite of mine even though legions of fans have subsequently disowned it. The series moved into the latter stages of its life from this point forward, taking bold steps in an attempt to expand far beyond what viewers had come to expect. The series continues today with at least two further sequels in the works. Will they find an audience or will the new arrivals fall flat on their faces? Fans will probably grumble even as they queue up to watch.
""Hellraiser: Bloodline"" took the risky step of moving the storyline into space, a cringe inducing idea at first until you actually watch the movie. Who can forget the nightmare that was ""Leprechaun 4""? Fortunately, only certain segments take place on a spaceship. The majority of the film heads back to the past to explain the origins of the Lament Configuration, that dreaded box which hundreds of seekers have opened only to find the Cenobites waiting for them. Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsey) locked himself away on the spaceship because he wants to destroy this infernal device once and for all. A group of marines arrives on the ship to take the ""mad"" doctor into custody. During his detainment he tells a dark story about his family's history, about how his ancestor Phillipe Merchant designed the box in the eighteenth century for a decadent French nobleman who wished to plumb the dark depths. The box does its job, horribly so, conjuring up a demon named Angelique (Valentina Vargas) who promptly carves up people left and right. Unfortunately for Merchant, the box somehow curses his bloodline. Every one of his descendants will suffer because of the Lament Configuration. Watch the hijinks unfold!
""Inferno"" is a cracking good tale about a cop, Detective Joseph Thorne (Craig Sheffer), and his descent into madness. While investigating a horrendous crime scene at the house of a man Thorne knew in high school, the cop discovers the Lament Configuration and wonders what it is. He also finds a finger left behind by someone called the Engineer. Then we learn more about Joseph. Although married to a beautiful woman who bore him a delightful child, Thorne spends most of his time away from the house shaking down criminals, using narcotics, and taking free favors from women of the night. His partner Tony Nenonen (Nicholas Turturro) has no idea what his partner is up to, which suits Thorne just fine. In fact, no one knows what this corrupt cop is doing except the people he leans on for personal gain when he should bring them up on charges. When Thorne heads to a local hotel with a woman who is not his wife, he inadvertently opens the box. What follows is at times confusing and gory, but it is easy to forget one simple thing in the unfolding madness: Thorne did open the Lament Configuration. Again, remember that Thorne DID open the Lament Configuration. Keeping this fact in the forefront of your memory will help you follow the story.
""Hellraiser: Bloodline"" is an uneven film anyway you slice it. Director Kevin Yagher withdrew from the production after his studio heavily interfered in the project. Thus, the film carries the dreaded ""Alan Smithee"" label, a moniker all too familiar to moviegoers in the know. The result of this turmoil behind the scenes set the movie adrift, so someone decided to just slap the whole thing together and dump the final result in the video stores. That's a real shame as ""Bloodlines"" has at its center an interesting premise for fans of the series: how the box came about and how it was first used to conjure up evil. With ""Inferno,"" certain fans continue to lament the decline of the series. Barker was long gone by the time ""Inferno"" hit video store shelves, but that doesn't mean we can't find something to like here. Sure, the movie confuses until you hear Pinhead wax on the morality of man as he shows Thorne just what his destiny has become. But the new Cenobites were appropriately grotesque, the special effects looked good, and even the acting is an improvement over many movies in the series. Can any viewer convince himself or herself for a second that most of the performances in the first two films were anything other than complete drivel? Heck no! I've seen better acting in a kindergarten play than I did in the first few films. Here, Sheffer does an acceptable turn as the corrupt Joseph, as does Turturro in the role of concerned partner Nenonen. Doug Bradley is as fantastic as ever as Pinhead even though the script dramatically reduced his role to a walk on part.
""Bloodline"" and ""Inferno"" are good additions to your DVD collection. As for the extras on the discs, ""Bloodline"" contains a trailer for ""Children of the Corn 666"" and not much else. ""Inferno"" has more extras, including a short special effects video about the Lament Configuration and an interview with Doug Bradley. Ultimately, I thought ""Inferno"" vastly superior to its predecessor, but both films entertain adequately enough. Give 'em a chance.",1087603200,,5708,4.855384615384615

The movie moves to the modern day-our modern day, not the year 2127 on the spaceship-to focus on John Merchant (again, Bruce Ramsey; he plays all three Merchants), an architect fascinated with the drawings passed down through the family from Phillipe Merchant. Again, Angelique turns up. But this time so does good old Pinhead, and he's bringing along some reinforcements. A huge battle ensues over the Lament Configuration, with the underworld's minions seemingly banished for good. We, having seen the events on that spaceship, laugh at such optimistic thinking. The finale to ""Hellraiser: Bloodline"" moves us back to the ship for a final showdown between Merchant, the marines, and the Cenobites. More gooey gore shows up to turn the stomach before the film slides quietly into the credits. Even if you end up hating this movie, you have to admit that the gore quotient reaches nauseating new heights.

Pinhead even turns up to toss off a few new witticisms. I especially enjoyed the line that goes something like ""Do I look like someone who cares what God thinks?"" You can always rely on Pinhead to say something memorable. Unfortunately, he doesn't show up in this movie nearly as much as we would like, a problem that only gets worse in parts five and six. Still, some Pinhead is better than no Pinhead at all, don't you think?
Give up on the idea of the series ever returning to the original themes so eloquently portrayed in the first and second films. Those days are gone forever as sequel mania long ago destroyed any hope of maintaining Barker's original inspiration. I generally watch new Hellraiser films for the glimpses of Pinhead and the jaw dropping gore effects. I found the ""Bloodline"" DVD a bit disappointing in the extras department. There aren't any, actually, beyond a trailer for ""Children of the Corn 666"" (yet another horror series deteriorating into utter banality) and a promo for the ""Scream"" box set. An Alan Smithee commentary track would have been nice-we could have finally heard from this mysterious man after all these years! Seriously, give ""Bloodline"" a chance.

This was the first Hellraiser I saw,so obviously I found it a little hard to follow,ok I found it damn near impossible to follow,but that's just coz I hadn't seen the rest of them. But strange as it may be this is an amazing concept for a horror movie,it's no routine slasher. As Bloodline takes place in three different timezones it really gives us a chance to lern more about the Merchant family and the Lament Configuration. But I think what I liked most about this movie are the killer one liners. As I'm sure most hellraiser fans know,Pinhead can't be on the screen more than two seconds without starting to prattle on about something profound. Some people find this tedeious,but I don't. The way I see it is that he's just making up for the killers who don't say anything at all, like Micheal Myers. Another thing I liked about this movie is the acting. It was actually really great,and I was happy to see Kim Myers whom I knew from Freddy's revenge. But I must say Doug Bradley does an excellant job as Pinhead and stops the movie dragging. Introducing Angelique was a great idea coz she adds some competion. Now if your a goreHOUND you'll DIG this movie,(get it..hound,dig,ha,ha)coz there's plenty of messy stuff. Although there's loads of gore,however the movie manages to steer away from becoming a total splatfestival. So that's why I liked it,and who doesn't love horror in space? The si-fi fans that's who!

Secondly,why is it hard to believe that hell or evil could not exist in space?There just hasn't been many movies that have explored the idea of malevolence in space outside of event horizon. The plot was excellent and pretty much summed up all of the series in one. Pinheads acting is superb and this is his best work of all time. The other actors aren't academy award nominess but they do a sufficient job. Visually speaking this is the best movie of all the series.

1372040,3,B00004Y633,"It's funny how the third installment of any series usually kills the franchise. Part Three of 'Rambo' didn't just finish the Russian Army. Part Three of 'Beverly Hills Cop' was probably seen by 12 people from coast to coast (pity them). And the third try at 'Halloween'....well, let's not talk about that. Of course, in movies, and especially in horror movies, death is not the end, so despite the fact that ""Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth"" pretty much drove a stake through Cliver Barker's Hellbound hearts club,it didn't stop the sequel from beating along.
And that's a good thing, because although 'Bloodline' isn't exactly gonna win any Oscars (unless you look closely and see that Oscar has nails driven through his face), it does a fair job of both washing the horrible taste of Part III out fans' mouths, telling a very inventive story, and both advancing and completing the mythos of the series. And it succeeds in spite of some horribly inconsistent effects, choppy editing and a bad performance by Bruce Ramsey, an actor who is not quite talented enough to play one role but somehow ends up getting three. Tell me, how easy IS it to get a casting director's job on a horror movie, anyway? Do ALL producers hire their idiot cousins from Debuth, or what?

Anyway, I won't get into the plot too much. The movie is essentially three stories which precede and follow the other Hellraiser movies in the 18th, 20th, and 23rd centuries. The first Ramsey character plays Lemarchand, a French toymaker who is conned into building the box for an evil, black-arts dabbling aristocrat who wants to open the gateway to hell. The subsequent stories follow the cursed Lemarchand descendents who each try to shut that gateway, with mixed success (""mixed"" meaning one or more of them may end up as chum before the final credits). The story also follows the evolution of hell over the centuries (sexy siren demon Angelique versus hideously but stylistically disfigured demon Pinhead) as well as the tactics hell uses to lay claim to more souls (seduction versus dragging you in kicking and screaming via lots of fishhooks).
This is a pretty ambitious premise, and is not well served by the film's low budget (the French-revolution and modern sets are okay, and the exterior SPFX in the future are very good, but the interior of the space station looks like the access tunnel of an abandoned high school gym....HORRIBLY fake and shoddy, as if they ran out of money 2/3 of the way thru principal photography) or by Ramsey's bad acting. The truth is this guy looks a lot like Jean Claude Van Damme, and like Van Damme he can't emote to save his life....I kept expecting him to drop into a split and then bust Pinhead with a roundhouse to the jaw.
Furthermore, the device of telling 3 stories in one movie means none of them really get fleshed out. The most interesting part from the fan's POV is obviously the opening segment, where we see the box created and get a glimpse of the pre-Pinhead hell. Unfortunately, it seems there were some rather deep cuts made in the editing room, and it shows, since this part seems to stumble and leap along instead of flowing smoothly.
The new Cenobites, including the second version of Angelique, are the coolest designs since the first film. Unfortunately, there is a bit of carryover from Part III, where the producers tried very hard to turn Pinhead into a wisecracking Freddy Kreuger-type slasher instead of the deadly serious Grand Inquisitor. The character never really recovered from that treatment, which made him funny where he was supposed to be terrifying. In this outing he comes most of the way back, but is given too much screen time and too much dialogue (remember how little he was really in the first two films? This is just overkill) to be taken very seriously.
Overall, this is a very flawed movie, but if you are into this series, it has enough going for it to recommend for at least a rental. Which is more than I can say for 'Part III.'
PS - I see used phrases like 'fleshed out', 'deep cuts' and 'overkill' in this review and wasn't even trying to be ironic. Scary.",1054252800,,4113,4.7125
1372061,3,B00004Y633,"Bloodline is the fourth installment in the Hellraiser saga created by Clive Barker.  This film is unique in that it traces the origin of the puzzle box that opens the gateway in which the cenobites travel.  The movie spans generations of the bloodline of the box's creator.  The bloodline begins with LaMerchant, a toymaker in old France who makes the box for a wealthy client.  The client uses black magic to transform the simple toy into Hell's gateway.  The present day descendant of ""the toymaker"" is a gifted architect who designed the building we see at the end of Hellraiser III.  The bloodline concludes in the future where LaMerchant's descendant devises a plan to rid the world of the box once and for all.
Overall the movie is well crafted, but not without fault.  For starters, there are times when the viewer is left wanting more detail.  I would have like to have seen more time spent with the story of the box's creation for example.  I have read that the director was unhappy about the edits made to reduce the running time of the film.  Perhaps we'll get a director's cut at some point.  The special effects are good, but much of the gore seems more gratuitous than necessary.  In fact, unlike the horror effect it has in the first two movies, it becomes more distracting here.  Doug Bradley is once again brilliant as Pinhead.  As has become customary, we are introduced to new cenobites including a pretty cool dog-like creature called the chatter beast.
The movie is presented in widescreen and the picture and sound quality of the DVD are very good.  Unfortunately there are no extras on the DVD making the price rather stiff for a bare bones disc.  However, if you are a fan of the Hellraiser saga or an aficionado of modern horror, it is a worthy addition to your library.

1372062,2,B00004Y633,"The original Hellraiser was one of the scariest and finest horror movies ever crafted.  Hellbound: Hellraiser 2 and Hellraiser 3 were... well, let's just leave it at that.  Anyway, Hellraiser: Bloodline marks the first installemnt of the series under Dimension/Miramax films (a year or two before we'd be introduced to the first Halloween movie under the studio), and by the time you see the words ""Directed by Alan Smithee"" you know that this horror movie will be anything but horrifying.  However, Bloodline does have a few things going for it that saves it from landing in a garbage dump: Doug Bradley returns once again as Pinhead and gives his best performace since the original film, the storyline attempts to trace the secrets of the ""box"", and most of the special effects are pretty well done.  However, Bloodline is not without it's flaws.  While the idea of tracing the origins of the box sounds like a good idea, the storyline is convulted and sometimes confusing and there are quite a bit of things never explained, not to mention Bruce Ramsay seems to be a bit over his head in his three different roles.  Also, and this is my biggest complaint of the film, is that Pinhead is on screen for far too long.  Bradley is entertaining as Pinhead, but he's just not scary anymore.  Remember the first time you saw the original Hellraiser?  Remember how seeing Pinhead the first time scared the absolute hell out of you?  Bloodline just doesn't live up to that because now Pinhead is a comedian (just like Freddy Kruger turned into in the later installments of the Nightmare on Elm Street series) without much menace.  All that aside, Hellraiser: Bloodline isn't the worst Hellraiser movie (Hellraiser 3 anyone?), but I strongly suggest watching the original before seeing this or any other Hellraiser film.",1046217600,,1813,4.872964169381108
1372063,4,B00004Y633,"When I first watched this movie, I felt the director was quite justified in choosing the Alan Smithee moniker for himself.  After a second viewing, I find myself much more favorably inclined toward this fourth film in the Hellraiser series.  It's still somewhat disappointing, but it is not unwatchable; if nothing else, Pinhead gets more great lines than ever before.  Long before Jason journeyed into space, Pinhead was there.  Bloodlines opens in the year 2127; Dr. Merchant, descendant of the man who created the diabolical puzzle box, has hijacked the space station he designed and has just summoned Pinhead and his diabolical minions into his trap when the station is boarded by the military and the doctor taken prisoner.  With demons roaming free on the station and time running out for Merchant to complete his plans, he tells the story of his family to a young female soldier named Rimmer in an effort to convince her to let him finish his work.
We are transported back to what I assume to be 18th century France, where a toy maker named L'Merchant has been commissioned to design a puzzle box for famed magician/occultist M. de L'isle.  The toy maker watches from outside as de L'isle and an assistant kill and skin a young woman and use her, in conjunction with the powerful box, to summon a demon.  Realizing that he is responsible for creating a means of opening the gates of hell, L'Merchant sets about designing a machine to destroy demons such as the beguilingly beautiful enchantress Angelique.  He does not live long enough to succeed, but the curse and the memories of what he has done are imbedded in his bloodline.  The story then jumps to 1996, where architect John Merchant has designed a huge room intriguingly similar to the puzzle box.  Angelique soon arrives and summons Pinhead.  The Merchant bloodline is doubly important to the Cenobites-while it holds the danger of building a machine to defeat the demons, it also holds the secret for opening a permanent doorway to hell.  Now things start to get interesting, as Pinhead soon tires of Angelique's reliance on temptation; to him human acquiescence is much more easily obtained by terror.  The culmination of this part of the history is quite satisfying; declaring that ""I am pain,"" Pinhead goes about proving the deep truth of his assertion.  Finally, we return back to the future space station and watch the ultimate culmination of events set in motion hundreds of years earlier, the final showdown between the L'Merchant bloodline and the demons the family unwittingly invoked.
Although the story has multiple weak spots, some delectable gore somewhat offsets it.  One of the two decapitations here is particularly impressive, as is the blood that flows freely in the home of the mad M. de L'isle.  The demon princess Angelique is a captivating counterpart to the familiar Pinhead, although I agree with Pinhead that terror is much more effective (not to mention entertaining) than temptation.  Bruce Ramsey plays three members of the Merchant family, but I think the roles would have been better played by three actors.  Doug Bradley is, of course, wonderful as Pinhead, and I was quite glad to see him get so many lines this time around.  His musings on suffering and pain are music to my horror-attuned ears, none more so than his impassioned reaction to the pitiful pleas for divine mercy of ridiculously cast and incredibly annoying identical twin security guards: ""Do I look like someone who cares what God thinks?""  One almost feels compelled to applaud when Pinhead states the obvious fact that ""I am so exquisitely empty.""
This movie is much less carnally gripping than the first two Hellraiser films, but do not dismiss it out of hand.  I actually find it more enjoyable than Hellraiser 3.  What initially seemed to me to be quite awful has now become a film I appreciate and take delight in.  Just don't take this movie too seriously; after all, it is just a game, and it is most definitely time to play.",1042848000,,3999,4.8657817109144545
1372064,4,B00004Y633,"Hellraiser Bloodline combines a story of a *particular puzzlebox's origins in Seventeenth Century France with Enlightenment era ceremonial magick/demonology. Le Merchande (as mentioned in the comics), a noted local toymaker, is commissioned by a wealthy ceremonial magician to craft the Hellraiser ""trademark"" puzzlebox (unknowingly) in order to raise the demoness ""Angelique"" and incarnate her in the flesh of a sacrificed girl/courtesan. Le Merchande is subsequently murdered, but survived by his pregnant wife, thus starting the ""Bloodline"". The bloodline manifests itself as dream sequences in future generations until ""present day"" (1996), when a descended architecht designs a building based on the puzzlebox. You may remember the building from the end of Hellraiser III.
  Erotic demoness Angelique, living in delicious, ageless sin with the magician's apprentice for over three centuries, gets wind of the project and decides to ""emigrate"", bringing into play one of the GOLDEN RULES of the box and series in general. She, of course, is ""humbled"" by our hero, Pinhead, and initiated as a Cenobite. Classic Hellraiser follows, with another child surviving and continuing the bloodline into the future and a space station designed by his descendant, bent on ending the Bloodline and **displacing Pinhead and ""crew"".
  Though the space station element is clear ""genre"" (all long running horror series went to space at some point), the ceremonial magick element is classic ""goth horror"" with both elements of historical accuracy regarding the nature of black magick and its historical practitioners, and a tribute to Hellraiser's Lovecraftian roots that Clive Barker emulates OH SO WELL...
  As far as mainstream consumption goes, ""Bloodline"" is hard to grasp and the spacestation acting is by-and-large, mediocre. If, however, you are a devotee of Barker, Pinhead, and ""the box"", then Bloodline is a worthy addition.
 *There are several boxes, as you may have noted in ""HR II"".

BLOODLINES watched first reminds any fan just how bad the series can be and not just due to editing (or butchering depending on your point of view!).  That this film in a way ends the Hellraiser mythos you would at least hope they could go out in style.  You'd be wrong - a dull rushed ending ruins what should and could have been an epic confrontation and what we're left with is a feeling of seen it all before (Aliens anyone?).  The final scene for one major character is totally pathetic but to reveal more would ruin it for those of you who HAVE to see this just because you love Hellraiser.  To sum up a film strangely lacking in gore with a plot that reeks of made for television.  In fact I cannot think of a film I'd rather not see at the cinema.  You may be wondering why I gave this package 3 stars but thats mainly down to INFERNO - a superb movie and even more so when compared to the film its twinned with.  Craig Sheffer plays the anti hero to perfection and even with so many dark traits is still a character you can't help but like.  Many have complained that this movie has little to do with Hellraiser and yes, Pinhead isn't in it much but to be honest it is a better movie for that fact.  Hellraiser 2 and 3 were ruined by overusing the character and a step back was needed otherwise we'd have another comedy villian on our hands a la krueger, Myers etc.  This film is easily the best since the first if not better in some ways and unlike the other movies this one does not end happily or leave itself open to a sequel.  And yet the poetic finale is beautifully done and I couldn't shake the feeling that for once a Hellraiser sequel could be consistently good throughout the course of the movie.  So one very bad movie and one exceptionally good one - lets just hope they hit the ground running with HELLRAISER - HELLSEEKER and try for another INFERNO not another BLOODLINES.",1032048000,,2066,4.280205655526992
1372069,1,B00004Y633,First off I couldn't give a damn whether this film was cut or that the editing thereof is a valid excuse for a terrible movie. Simply put it is not. I hadn't rewatched the first three Hellraiser films in many a moon prior to watching this and afterwards started questioning why at one point I had been terrified by any of the movies - yes it is that bad. And you thought Hell on Earth was a crock? Even the Motorhead theme tune at the end of that movie couldn't overtake this one for stupid Hellraiser idea time. Don't get me wrong the theme of the movie in itself is ok - explain the lament configurations origin over the ages. Where it goes wrong is in the execution - half assed attempts at tension and just rehashing the scares of the first 3 movies albeit in a TV Movie way. And as for the cenobite dog - even next doors Jack Russell could have decked it. All I can really say is skip this movie and purchase the far superior sequel INFERNO which at least returns to the themes of the first film and the original novella they were based on. And INFERNO isn't a bad lil movie to boot. Which cannot be said of this mediocre effort.,1031875200,,1134,4.206422018348624
1372070,3,B00004Y633,"You know there's trouble a-brewin' not when Pinhead's on the box, but when you see ""Directed by Alan Smithee"".  This is basically a pseudonym that directors use when they don't want their real name associated with a film due to some creative disagreement, producer changes that offended the director, or if the film is just [not good].
In this case director Kevin Yagher (a respected makeup effects artist) disowned the film after Dimension made cuts to it.  Hellraiser creator and original Hellraiser director Clive Barker has pretty much been written out of the series by now.  You only see Clive Barker Presents (since they're his characters) but
that's it.  Apparently Barker is too expensive and he has his own ideas of where the Hellraiser mythos should be going.
That said, Hellraiser: Bloodline is a weaker effort than the previous three appearances of The Box.  (I actually liked Part III a lot).
This is an ambitious story, as far as horror series go, and certainly as far as Part IVs go in any series.  While the first three eventually led to more insight into Pinhead and his origin, including the separation of his human and demon side in Part III, Bloodline tries to trace the history of the famous box.  The Lament Configuration, as its known, was designed by a toymaker named Merchant in 18th century France.  It was commissioned by a particularly crazy Duke (or Duc) who somehow is able to raise hell with the thing.  (It's never made clear why the box has these powers, or, for that matter, what the heck is going on with his Latin incantations and skinning at the beginning).
The film opens in the year 2127 on a giant spaceship (yes, folks, Pinhead in space).  The ship is, in fact, a giant trap designed by Merchant's last descendant in an effort to finally summon Pinhead and destroy him.  Then the film flashes back to the 18th century, then forward to 1996 Paris, then to 1996 New York where the Merchant of 2127's father is an architect.  Throughout we see a stunning Frenchwoman named Angelique who becomes some kind of demon (I think), though this, like many things in Bloodline, is never made clear.
If you're a Hellraiser fan, you'll enjoy more Hellraising action.  However, you'll be disappointed by the fact that much of the plot makes very little sense.  Who is Angelique?  Is she a Cenobite?  Can you really kill Pinhead?  How many boxes are there?
As for the gore, well, we do get some quality bits.  However, this is easily the weakest film as far as Cenobites go.  Pinhead takes 2 twin brothers and does something involving drills and twisting their faces together and a lot of blood and screaming and they're joined at the head.  Then there's a Cenobite dog, or
whatever that thing is, which is resigned to only brief shots of it's front or teeth or in shadows since, frankly, the thing looks downright low-budget.  And I think that's Angelique in space at the end with her skull exposed under pinned scalp-flesh, which actually looks great, but she's given precious little time in that bloody form.
There's a lot owed to the Alien films here, including a group of Marines who exist for the sole reason to get whacked out by Pinhead.  And speaking of Pinhead, I'm not crazy about him either in this installment.  For one, we almost get too much of him(!)  We see him brightly lit and walking around and spouting some almost overwhelming Pinhead-isms about human acquiesence, blah blah blah and stroking a pigeon(!).  In the earlier films he was resigned to dark, shadowy sets and was, of course, a creepier character.  But, give a movie maniac too many sequels and soon enough he'll be the hero, cracking jokes and making far too many appearances (see: Freddy Krueger).
However, the film is photographed well, and the makeup in general is very good.  (I give credit for at least trying something new with the dog).
All in all, this isn't terrible.  I'm a huge fan of the series, so I welcome new additions.  I just wish that with the scope of the story and the playing around with the mythos so much that they would have done a better job.  I wish we could get a director's cut--the film runs a scant 86 minutes(!)  Wonder how much was cut, given that this movie spans a few centuries.
What else do we get on this DVD?  Nothing.  Not even a trailer.  The picture and sound are both good.  Nothing incredible, but certainly fine.  Wish they could get a decent transfer of Part III out.
Recommended for Hellraiser fans simply because it's Hellraiser, and Pinhead, and the Box.  But as for others, this is definitely NOT a good starting point for the series and is not indicative of the gothic horror of the original story and 2 films.",1028851200,,4669,4.656898656898657
1372091,2,B00004Y633,"What a great line... but from such a mediocre movie. Bloodline is a confused movie if I have ever seen one and with its whole director issue it is obvious why. The scenes in the past regarding the creation of the box are quite entertaining, but from there this movie looses steam and fast! This film goes through three generations represented by the past the present and then the future which takes place in space. So could we say that Pinhead really dies... but not yet. This is like a prequel a sequel and a series closer all in one. But it should not have been. I would have much rather seen more history and not the idea of putting Pinhead back as a Freddy Krugar type character yet again. Trying to piece this movie together in any logical way will prove to be futile.
An interesting thing to see here is the relationship between Pinhead and his cohort in the film, Angelique. How they inevitably meet up is unclear to me but boy do they seem to have a lot of stuff to talk about. Mostly worthless stuff that wastes screen time. Pinhead just pops up and says hey somewhere in this movie and goes man I have not talked in a while let me just yap yap until the end, which he does. Basically if he learned to close his mouth he probably would not have been taken out by the good guys.
One notable thing you see is the building from the end of Hell on Earth that you learn was designed by an ancestor to the creator of the Lament Configuration. This is during the modern time of the story so one could say this is where the Hellraiser story could continue from the third. In the building there are two twin cops who happen to stumble across Pinhead. Yea Pinhead is just chilling you know...they did not open the box and what did he need cenobites for anyway. For this scene they decide just to say hey lets take some time to show some more gore and a creation of a cenobite. My gripe with the third movie is the same with this one. Why is Pinhead making cenobites!? Basically this movie just digs Hellraiser deeper into the mud. I really do not know how Clive Barker could crucify the Hellraiser: Inferno movie and still have his name attatched to the third and fourth movies. At least Inferno goes back to the personal hell and cenobite ideals of the mythology. More mysterious creatures out to explore the further regions of experience.
So in the end they end up in space. Why must every horror movie go in space nowadays. You have your Leprechauns and now your Jasons and it is getting to be rediculous. This part just exists to add more body counts for Pinhead and to attempt some sort of climax, but having a future battle is a waste of time. It actually really is not a battle just a bunch of guys being chased by Pinhead and a chattering dog cenobite thingy. Lame! Here Pinhead just gets way too carried away with talking as if he had not done enough of that in the modern scenes.
In conclusion, Bloodline is a separate film from the previously three. It starts off with cool history then turns into Pinhead's revenge. Both this one and Hell on Earth clearly lack the feel and fun of the first two. The series gains some steam again with the next one Inferno where Pinhead's appearance, not his role, is wisely cut down. Tune into that one!",1022803200,,3248,4.352553542009884

""Hellraiser: Bloodline"" is the perfect example of the way it should be done.
Director Alan Smithee weaves an intricate tale of old favorite Pinhead, and introduces inspired new elements to the ""Hellraiser"" mythos. I hope to see another genre film from this talented director; ""Burn Hollywood Burn"" was a departure from his skills as a Space ""Chopera"" auteur.
Frightening events become even more terrifying when set on a spooky spaceship, or desolate alien moon. ""Alien 3"" and ""Event Horizon"" are science-fiction movies with scary elements, thus it only makes sense that scary movies with science-fiction elements would be just as cool.

There are three different stories that all come together in the end. Much gore and much Pinhead is present in Bloodline and that's why it is the best of all the Hellraisers. Also, Valentina Vargas, who plays Angelique, is damn good looking. If she tried to terrorize me, I'd let her! Pinhead(Doug Bradley) has great lines as usual and the new cenobites are great.

The biggest problem I have is that the makeup effects for the last two movies, while elaborate, don't look quite as realistic as those for the first two.  Sure, some of the stuff in the first two looked a little rubbery, but the coloring wasn't unrealistically bright, and the Cenobites were supposed to look like they were powdered, not plastic and shiny, like their skin was naturally that white.
The story on this one did NOT come from nowhere.  There was a comic series that was released a several years ago called Clive Barker's Book of the Damned (I, II, III, and I think there was a IV), and I believe Clive Barker had some input in some form as to the content.  They actually told the backstory for the series, including the origin of the box in III.  While the story was twisted a bit in Bloodline, it is still very recognizable.  I've heard this movie was originally a lot different, and would like to see an earlier cut, but all of them except the first were changed significantly in post-production.. just listen to the commentary on the Hellbound DVD, at least the one from the boxed set.  Some interesting ideas there, too.. :)

Hellraiser III was better than the second one.  Its plot as well  as Doug Bradley's spectacular acting ability tend to keep the viewer awake.  The problem with Hellraiser three is that several portions of the film  watch almost like a cheesy eighties metal video.  Many of the cenobites  were also dissapointing.  Hellraiser: Bloodline was supposed to close this  book for good.  Finally, Director Kevin Yagher takes the reins of this  mighty series and steers Barker's conception back onto the path.  Unfortunately, the studio decided to get involved and snatched the project from the director's hands, hence why Alan Smithee appears as the director's name.  As a result, Kevin Yagher found the results of the film unsatisfactory.  Unlike directors previously assigned to project: Hellraiser, Yagher ignores the storyline involving the Kirsty Cotton character.  Instead, he offers us the  enticing origin of the LeMerchant Configuration mentioned in Clive Barker's  novella The Hellbound Heart.  In old France, a highly respected toymaker  undertakes his most painstaking project.  As a result, LeMerchant  constructs the magnificent puzzle box specifically for a wealthy client who  practices the art of black magic.  By chanting Satanic spells over the box,  this warped magician transforms a simple box into a gateway to an eternal  dimension in which lies intense pleasure and excruciating pain!  Through  the centuries the LeMerchant clan is plagued by nightmares of demons and  mysterious occurrences.  The movie is very well written and has an equally suspenseful plot.  Many people are confused by the storyline because they  refuse to let go of the plots of Hellraiser I, II, and III.

1372121,1,B00004Y633,"nowadays it seems as if every horror series has installments that just don't make par with the rest of the series. maybe it's just that some  series are better off left as a trilogy and nothing more. hellraiser 3 may  not have been a 'perfect fit' with the first two, but it was entertaining  enough and a decent enough of a movie to have been an appropriate  conclusion to what would've been a great horror trilogy. but then they had  to go back and try to take the franchise a step further, now that might not  sound like a bad idea to begin with but they made a huge mistake...they  tried to do it without clive barker. now clive began the whole thing when  he wrote 'the hellbound heart' and then wrote/directed the first movie. he  was involved with parts 2 & 3 also but they didn't want him back for  the 4th installment. he should've been involved in at least some capacity  but no...they said no. the producers came up with the ridiculous idea of  having pinhead in space. now i don't know who in their right mind came up  with that idea but to me space just don't seem like the right setting for  pinhead. since everyone knew from past installments how the cenobites came  to be the producers decided they'd try to explain the origin of the puzzle  box made centuries ago. now the concept might've worked but the script was  just the worst thing ever written. i mean it began in space where pinhead  got loose and then decided to go back centuries ago to explain about the  toymaker who created the box and how the same family has been haunted for  generations by the same demon known as pinhead. the script was so awful  that director kevin yagher was so ashamed of it that he was forced to use  the alan smithee label just so people wouldn't know it was his movie. i  mean by the time they made hellraiser 4 it was just pointless. he had  already been sent back at the end of part 3 and therefore there was really  no more story to be told. it was meant to be a trilogy. i mean everyone  knew about the box, pinhead, and the cenobites from the first 3 movies and  especially without original creator clive barker every ounce of the genious  from the first two films was gone. part 3 didn't even really live up to the  first two but at least it was more than passable but bloodline can't even  see passable. all that bloodline is is a slasher basically. in the first  hellraiser, it was known as true horror but now they've condescended  pinhead down to the likes of jason and michael myers and that's not what  the series was about. i sit here trying to think of something positive to  say about this movie but nothing comes to mind. even doug bradley's  performance as pinhead wasn't quite as good as it was in the first two,  even though he's the only one who can play the role. in the end, hellraiser  4: bloodline isn't even worth the price of rental let alone purchase. just  stick to the first three and don't even waste time on this failed  experiment of a movie.",967852800,,2981,4.34119782214156

John Merchant, whose Bloodline has stood in the way for Hell to be  released, is the so called victim in the film. And now Pinhead and his  friends are going for revenge. Right now, another sequel is awaiting...but  judging by the rumours, it doesn't sound good. It will only include Pinhead  for 5-10 minutes. Maybe it would a kinda of film like ""Hellraiser -  Bloodline"". If so, it won't be able to compare with the first 3  installments.

1372145,2,B00004Y633,"More like 1.5 stars. I've been a big fan of the Hellraiser series for awhile now. It's unfortunate that ""Hellraiser: Bloodline"" is the worst of the series. The story of ""Bloodline"" centers on the  creation of the infamous puzzle box bearing the Lament Configuration. We  are introduced to Phillip Lemarchand, the 18th century French toy maker  responsible for the box's creation, and two of his descendants, one a 20th  century architect named John Merchant and the other a 22nd century  astrophysicist and space station designer named Paul Merchant. All the  members of the Lemarchand bloodline try to destroy the Lament Configuration  puzzle box with something known as the Elysium Configuration. The problem I  had with this film was its inability to fully develop any of the three  stories contained within. If the film makers had centered on a specific  time frame and developed the story from there, this film would have been  much better. It's still watchable, though not really worth watching. It's  really disappointing because when I heard the concept of this film a few  years back I thought it had great potential. When one views this film, it  becomes apparent why director Kevin Yagher took his name off the picture.  Sadder still, screenwriter Peter Atkins says ""I received sole writing  credit but, in retrospect, should probably have followed Kevin's example  and taken refuge behind an invented name.""",953337600,,1419,5.126637554585153

What  the final cut of the movie is: Sometimes pure genius, sometimes laughable  or the story is not enough developed, it often seems to me that some scenes  are too short for what they have to tell.

7926777,3,B00004Y633,"A nice change of pace as the franchise reviews the past and future of the Puzzle Box in this anthology of sorts.  This franchise remains worthy through the fourth film, even if pale in comparison to the first two films.

Jason X (2001) took Jason Voorhees to space, as did Leprechaun 4: In Space (1996).  I think we can all agree these were bad, but fun and campy ideas.  Thankfully Pinhead's (Doug Bradley) legacy retains some value as this film actually rights its swervingly uncertain path in the wake of Hell on Earth (1992) and returns the franchise to a more worthy storyline than Pinhead on a killing spree or simply giving us ""Pinhead in Space.""  Yuck.  If you want Hell in space, you want Event Horizon (1997).  Period.

Entering the fourth installment of the franchise, Bloodline opens on a 22nd century space station where Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsay; Alive, Continuum) uses what I can only describe as a 1990s Nintendo PowerGlove operating a robot to open the Puzzle Box.  A team of space marines manages detain him (after he opened the box), and he reveals that the Puzzle Box has been in his family for centuries and he must put an end to its lineage of terror.  As he explains, we are told of two past generations in his bloodline that possessed the very same infernal artifact.

I was most pleased with the very different approach in storytelling in this movie.  This film is essentially an anthology in which the space station story wraps around two other stories within, all three being of different time periods.

Merchant explains (in the first encapsulated story) that in the 18th century, his toymaker ancestor Phillip L'Merchant (also played by Bruce Ramsay) commissioned the Puzzle Box for a twisted cultist magician who, along with his young assistant (Adam Scott; Piranha 3D), used this device to summon a demon.  They skinned a young woman as a sacrifice such that the demon Angelique (Valentina Vargas; Faces in the Crowd) may inhabit her skin and walk the Earth.  Contrary to past Hellraiser canon, if you summon a demon you control that demon ""as long as you don't stand between the demon and Hell.""

Part 3 (Hell on Earth) ended with the Puzzle Box being dropped in wet cement, which was revealed to be the foundation of a business class skyscraper with the interior decorated with the famous Puzzle Box design all over the walls like modern art.  Accordingly our second encapsulated story advances Angelique and her master to present day (1996) as she senses the presence of the Puzzle Box and is drawn to America where another of Merchants ancestors has been inspired by the designs of the box.  She makes some temptations and summons Pinhead.  As usual, Pinhead wants the box.  Merchant successfully thwarts Pinhead, Angelique (now in Cenobite form) and their newly created Twin Cenobites but the box remains in the wake to threaten future generations.

I was pleased with the stories underlying all of the Hellraiser films so far.  Even though Hell on Earth felt too much like an action horror with some silly troped-up components, I remain pleased with it as it refrained from the all too often exploited cartoonishness of 90s horror.  It remained dire and creepy with a rich story leading up to the ""Pinhead action sequence.""  A major fault of Hell on Earth was the blatant over-exposition.  While this fault did not keep me from enjoying the movie, it is a bit frustrating nonetheless, and we find this fault here in Hellraiser IV.  Directly paralleling the degree of over-exposition is the drop in acting quality of these two movies.  I find the acting completely forgivable, mind you.  It's worst in the opening space station sequence and becomes more tolerable later on.

An interesting notion in this story is that the rules continue to change from film to film.  Or, if they haven't changed, then they're not being properly explained.  In 18th century Paris, he who summoned the demon controlled the demon.  I'll bet Hellraiser's Kirsty wished someone had told Pinhead that in 1987!  And, like in all the sequels, innocent people grow less safe with each movie.  In Hellbound the Channard Cenobite goes on a mental patient killing spree, in Hell on Earth Pinhead tries to kill EVERYONE, and now Pinhead continues to kill without reservation once summoned and converts Cenobites at will.  Back in the original Hellraiser, Pinhead couldn't touch anyone unless he at least believed that their ""desire"" was behind opening the box.  My, how times have changed with now a fourth director and set of writers for as many films.

Our story finally returns us to the space station where Pinhead now wanders.  The effects remain entertaining and gory. The Cenobites have a more traditional appearance again, except for the Cenobite dog (where did that thing come from; did Cujo open the Puzzle Box and go to Hell?) and the franchise mythology continues to expand our interest in the Puzzle Box.  In the end Pinhead is perhaps permanently deported to Hell in an interesting and clever story development involving the space station itself, which Merchant designed.  Lucky for us, this is about 200 years in the future.  So were good for as many sequels as they want to make until then.

Perhaps nothing in comparison to the first two films, I consider that this film (and part 3 as well) remains worthy for viewing pleasure.",1438300800,,5358,4.8428571428571425
