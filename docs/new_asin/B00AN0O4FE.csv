8554425,1,B00AN0O4FE,"This dvd was extremely short.  Not much information.  I've read Dokken's books and was very impressed with his insight and ideas.  This dvd left me feeling ripped off and disappointed that dokken would release a product like this with his name on it.  In addition, he promotes several products and puts in a plug for a future advanced shed dog training dvd.  Tom should have put more information in this dvd and forgot about selling a second dvd.  Very disappointed in this product and even more upset that I may have to be more selective on Dokken's future products.",1376697600,19,567,4.6767676767676765
