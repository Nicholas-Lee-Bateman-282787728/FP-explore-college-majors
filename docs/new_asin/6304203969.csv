7865183,5,6304203969,"Hmmm....Interesting look on gay comics and their material. You wonder after watching this if you couldn't come up with your own routine yourself. Some are better then others of course. What I don't get whether it is here or on stage somewhere,what idiot thought using x amount of swear words in their routine was funny! Plus the more swear words you call your mother or family doesn't make it funny. If its someone we know and something we maybe thinking maybe otherwise who likes a filthy comic?!",1209254400,,497,4.724137931034483
