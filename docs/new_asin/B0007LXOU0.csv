2219471,4,B0007LXOU0,FullMetal rocks.. If you are a Full Metal fan you'll enjoy the series.. Vol. 3 take syou on the a journey with Ed and Al searching for the Philosoper's Stone.. Every Alchemist knows Equivalent Exchange always has to be balanced..,1122854400,,229,4.75
2219472,4,B0007LXOU0,"Volume 3 is my least favorite of the 3 released dvds. It is still a great collection of episodes, they just fall furthest off the storyline. ""Be Thou For the People"" is Ed's first assignment to inspect a coalmine, which doesn't further his search for the philsopher's stone. It shows Ed and Al's character, just how good of people they are, but not one of my favorite episodes. ""The Phantom Theif"" is a fun episode but still one that doesn't further the main storyline. Then the other two episodes is the two part ""The Other Brothers Elric"" which once again puts us on the path to the philosopher's stone with Elric brothers imposters. Good episodes, but they don't live up to the first eight episodes. Which brings me to one of my main gripes, you only get four episodes and no extras for a heafty price. I know this is characteristic of anime, but I wish they would do better. Still, I almost gave this five stars.",1120867200,2,916,4.491017964071856

8048656,5,B0007LXOU0,"Fullmetal Alchemist volume 3: The Equivelent Exchange is a great FMA DVD just like any other. This DVD contains episodes 9-12. Vic Mignogna, the voice of Edward Elric, enjoys episode 9 very much ^^

But anyway, back to the DVD, this episodes are not like your other typical Fullmetal Alchemist episodes, but it's not like they're bad. They're great! This DVD even comes with the complete first chapter of Fullmetal Alchemist. And like the other DVDs, it comes with a little booklet.

Fullmetal Alchemist and anime fans will love this DVD ^^",1292198400,,540,4.858695652173913
8048657,5,B0007LXOU0,"I have been keeping track of this series for a while now and am still collecting all the DVDs I got this one a while back and still pop it in from time to time just to watch them all over again.

good stuff, can be a bit corny at times but still a great series, you really need to get them all starting from the begining so that you can understand what is going on and get the full story.",1194134400,,388,3.7901234567901234

8048659,4,B0007LXOU0,"In my opinion, the episodes in this cd barely moved the plot along, but I watched them nonetheless. Don't get me wrong, I love the series, but I didn't believe that the stories contained in this compilation met the requirements of the plot as I had hoped...",1181606400,,257,4.48936170212766
8048660,5,B0007LXOU0,"I am not a spring chicken, so I get introduced to anime through my daughter. Some of it is fluffy love stories or improbable characters or situations that appear from nowhere to solve the day. Full Metal is none of these. The characters are believable even when they are a talking metal suit of armor. Ed and Al are young boys. Their mother dies. They desparately want her back. They do something forbidden. They pay. And they learn what the costs are. The world is a confusing place. They navigate, sometimes on their own and sometimes with people who they meet along the way. Not everyone is who they seem at the start. Finally they confront the costs of their and other peoples violations of the rules. Through the story there is humor and growth. The story is told from their point of view. They do not give in to the tragedies that surround them and keep fighting for the truth and for each other. I highly recommend this series for young teens and old fogies (that's me). Much better than most things available for teens these days. I rank this up with Dante and Faust as literature about pacts made by people not understanding the full consequences of their actions fighting to restore the balance of their lives.",1170633600,,1220,4.575342465753424
8048661,5,B0007LXOU0,"With all the major elements of the Elric Brother's past explored, this volume goes back to where it left off in the first couple episode of the Fullmetal Alchemist series. The brothers are searching once again for the Philosopher's Stone, this time following clues that lead them into troublesome situations. After the first episode on this DVD, which is the last of the ""past"" episodes, the brothers find themselves in a city hunting a thief that advertises her crimes. After that, the brothers face a second pair of Elric brothers who are refining magical stones from red water in the hopes to duplicate the effect of the Philosopher's Stone.

Yes, I will say that the story slowed somewhat in this, but that had to have been expected considering the fast-paced beginning of this series. In fact, looking back, I think the slower pace was somewhat welcome. It allowed for the series to lighten up a little and give the viewers a chance to take a breather and just enjoy the goings-on of the Elric Brothers. Besides, it still has the excellent animation and music to back up the slowing plot. And though it slowed, I'm fairly sure that it will pick up sooner or later (my guess would be sooner, since I've already taken a peek at volume four).

I'm startled myself by how hooked I now am by this series. The first volume didn't catch my attention the way it probably should have, mainly do to my own skepticism. But now that I've given FMA the chance it deserves, I'm loving every second I spend watching this series, and I feel confident saying that FMA is definitely one of the better anime out at this point in time.",1149984000,,1620,4.602076124567474
8048662,5,B0007LXOU0,"every fullmetal alchemist dvd is worth it's weight in gold, even if the plot or episode is a bit off. if you really love FMA then you would over look it and just enjoy it. Every opportunity to watch FMA is the greatest gift to me.",1128211200,2,230,4.021739130434782
