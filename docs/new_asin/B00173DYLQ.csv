I thought this might help and was blown away by how many exercises are in this DVD.  They are not the same ones that have been out there for years, but are ones I have never seen before.  It is very comprehensive.  I like how the author explains the exercises in detail and how he compiles the exercises into actual workouts.  The categories of the DVD include: Warm-up, Body weight training for legs and upper body, Stability Ball/Medicine Ball/Tubing exercises, Partner Drills, Buso exercises, Speed, Agility, Agility ladder drills, Games, etc....As I said, it has a huge menu of exercises.  So far it has been challenging to do the exercises, but it has some fun things as well.  It was worth it and I don't see how you can be dissappointed with this one.",1207785600,,895,4.521739130434782
