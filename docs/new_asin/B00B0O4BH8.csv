8560369,5,B00B0O4BH8,I have not even watched this dvd set yet but I am so confident in ARP since all their other dvds have kicked ass!  Almost no one of them has heard of them here in Oklahoma.  I wonder if Mike Terrana ever takes a breather as he seems to be busy with Tarja too!,1366934400,3,259,3.7777777777777777
