1638858,5,B00005O5AS,"It is a shame how it finally happens... though Kenshin would never kill so i guess it works out good enough.
This DVD is great, some of the best bloopers in the entire series so far.  Shishio's voice actor has some of the best bloopers and Sano's actor is always saying something about getting a sandwich.  But this DVD is great but it's really hard to get any better than Innosence and Experience, the DVD just previous to this one.  Though now Shishio knows the trick to pulling off the Ama Kakeiru Ryu No Hiro Maki (spelling?) and it is in Kenshin's left foot.  Also Shishio is more of a devil than we realized and his cheap tricks are NOT his power by any means.  I just hate it that Saito had a perfect chance to do something about it was only only an inch off.  You'll see the truth behind the final attack in the Hiten Mitsarugi... It's action packed and built climaticly off the same music for a while.
Fire Requiem is the end of the Kyoto arc.  In the extras there is a little parting message from the cast.  This is the end to the best arc.  The next series, Tales of the Meji, isn't as great and contains a lot of filler episodes.  Of course i recommend this DVD unless you like the anticipation and the pain of not knowing...",1026259200,,1237,4.247863247863248
1638859,5,B00005O5AS,I think this is one of the Endings you would admit is honest and wonderful So I would not spoil it and hope you buy it on DVD or VHS but DVD has better and sharper image that makes you feel DANG!!! This is HOT~!!,1024012800,,212,3.7333333333333334
1638860,5,B00005O5AS,"Its finally here, the final showdown between Shishio and Kenshin.  Now that shishio knows the secret of the Amakakeru Ryu No Hirameki, will kenshin still be able to execute the move with full power?  Plus, how will kenshin manage to defeat him without breaking his vow?
These last few episodes of the Kyoto arc is definetely the ultimate battle between good and evil.  If you want to get a kenshin dvd this one is definetely one of the best ones to purchase, since it basically marks the end of the Rurouni Kenshin TV series (The rest of the series are just filler episodes since the Jinchuu arc was not animated).  After this DVD comes boring useless episodes that shouldn't be viewed by anyone!
Anyway, this DVD definetely has some of the most intense fighting in it.  Its a must see.",1012521600,5,786,4.585714285714285
1638861,4,B00005O5AS,"OK, I am going to try to give the reader the most insights I can without spoiling the surprises of this DVD.
So far, the Legends of Kyoto series is the best. Well, it was great up until the end. Kenshin's fight with Shishio had to be the most drawn out fight ever. I love the anime series, but sometimes I just want to say ""Finish already."" I cannot beleive they used 3 episodes for the Kenshin vs. Shishio, Saito vs. Shishio, Sano vs. Shishio, and Aoshi vs. Shishio. Sure that sounds like a lot, but those fights lasted for not more than 5 minutes each. I was rather bored with most of the dialog because they are just reviewing what happened. If you've seen Samurai X: The Movie, you would understand what I am talking about on how they repeat scenes over and over again.
Anyway, enough about my gripes. Other than those minor faults, I am happy with my purchase. It was nice for them to do a wrap-up episode to inform us of what happened to the surviving members of Shishio's crew, and it was pretty cool to know that Kenshin's master may be in future episodes. As cocky as he is, Hiko III is a rather entertaining character to watch.",1012262400,5,1137,4.317757009345795
1638862,5,B00005O5AS,"As the final chapter in the ""Kyoto Arc"", I was not disappointed. This is a fine ending, with no nasty cliffhanger at the end to leave you poised for the next chapter. And unlike a lot of anime these days, the final chapter was not watered down, or an anticlimax. It completed the arc in the style consistent with quality found in the first chapter ""Shadow of the Wolf"". Well worth purchasing.",1011744000,3,392,4.458333333333333
1638863,5,B00005O5AS,"The DVD Fire Requium is the last in the Kyoto series, and definately one of the best. The last five episodes, are truly remarkable, and not because of the climactic final showdown between Kenshin and Shishio. These last episodes deal with some of the deepest themes in the series, such as: Does winning a fight make the victor the one who was right in the end? and Do the the strong exist to protect the weak, or to use them as food? After the battle is over, it is then that the characters make the most important discoveries about themselves and each other. That is the real heart of it all. But, I have to admit, I totally loved the fight scenes too!",1011484800,6,653,4.317073170731708

However, none of it is enough to prepare him for the amazing skills, and explosive techniques wielded by Shishio Makoto. In the grand final battle to the Legend of Kyoto, Kenshin must once again face life or death, and find a deep truth within himself. The time for the final confrontation has come, and Kenshin will have to give it everything he has in order to prevail against Shishio... but, will he become the Battousai?

1638888,5,B00005O5AS,"This is the so-called ""closure disc"" to the excellent Kyoto Arc of the Rurouni Kenshin series. To recap, Kenshin's replacement from the Bakumatsu has come back from near death to try and return a now peaceful Japan once again to a state of chaos much like during the Bakumatsu. An already weakened Kenshin now has to face his successor, who has been given a special parting gift by his right hand man: the secret to Kenshin's Ama Kakeru Ryu No Hirameki final move.
And that's all this disc really is, closure. The best fights of the series have already taken place (the two Kenshin/Aoshi fights; the Kenshin/Cho fight; the Kenshin/Soujiro fight, and the best of all, the Kenshin/Saitoh fight). Still, the Hitokiri Battousai does have some moves left up his sleeve that we haven't seen yet, and that make this disc worth watching. About 60 percent of the show, however, is taken up by long speeches by Shishio (about why his plan must take place and is right) and from Kenshin (about why Shishio's vision for his Kunitori to take place is clouded). The fights are quick and almost anti-climactic to the long stares, speeches and analysis by the remaining spectators.
There are some definite cool shots in this; the screen splits into long, cross-wise screens that move toward Kenshin and Shishio to build up tension.
A disc that highlights what is good and bad about Rurouni Kenshin: great buildups of tension and clever, dramatic, tragic sword strategies versus the long speeches, long stare-downs and buildups ala Dragonball Z. The final fight doesn't even rank in terms of the best of the series, but it still holds its own. Pretty much, you can't not buy it cause you need to know how the Kyoto arc concludes, but not a recommended buy by itself, or as a first disc for a newcomer.",1056758400,2,1784,4.739549839228296
1638889,5,B00005O5AS,"this DVD has the best fight and lots of cliffhangers (Kenshin dies err sorta)
its also kinda sad, but very full of action, to say more would really spoil 90% of the DVD

1638891,5,B00005O5AS,"Excellent ending to the Kyoto Arc - Emotionally powerful and visually stimulating!  The extras are quite lacking, but no different from all of the other DVD's in this series.",1054512000,,174,5.0
1638892,5,B00005O5AS,"Rurouni Kenshin's Kyoto Arc, my favorite story arc of my favorite anime series ever, comes to a close in this tape, and believe me, it's a satisfying ending, despite the fact that in my opinion, the final battle with Shishio is really not the best.
This tape includes episodes 58-62.
58-60 complete the final battle with Shishio, begun in episode 57 (on the previous tape, Innocence and Experience).  As I said, this fight is *not* my favorite.  Both physically and mentally/philosophically, neither side will budge.  It's altogether proper for Kenshin's powers of heart and persuasion not to sway Shishio himself, but since that's my favorite thing about RK's fight scenes, for me, this one lacks the emotional power of the previous fight with Soujiro.  On the level of physical combat is where the problem is worst, however.  Despite my love for RK and the Kyoto Arc in particular, I was half-tempted to give this tape four stars because about the first hour of it is just Kenshin and co. hammering ineffectually at a seemingly invincible foe; everyone uses all their flashy special techniques (almost all of them anyway), none of it really gets us anywhere, and some of Shishio's parries are frankly ludicrous.  I lose patience with it all by the end of 58, but 59 was more of the same.  Episode 60 at last gets to the meat of the fight, and this part really is quite good.  Yumi steals the show, and this battle's resolution is unforgettable.
61 and 62 are the Kyoto Arc Epilogue, and when I said I was half-tempted to give this tape four stars, in the end I had to give it five because these denoument episodes are excellent.  In 61 we find out the fates of Shishio and his followers, and in 62, Kenshin and his friends all reflect on their experience and return home.  A very special goodbye in Kyoto and a very special welcome home in Tokyo complete this absolutely satisfying conclusion.
These days I hear a lot of talk about ""the true ending"" of RK.  Some may say it's the last volume of TV episodes (End Song), some say the new ""Reflection"" OVAs, some say it's only to be found in the manga.  I understand those viewpoints, but for me, Fire Requiem is the true ending.  I know that there were more episodes/OVAs/etc. and more great moments after this (which I don't want to turn you off from buying!), but to me, the tale that begins in the Trust and Betrayal OVAs is here beautifully brought all the way around to resolution.
Of course you have to see everything prior to this tape to fully appreciate these episodes, but if you see RK up to and including Fire Requiem, I give you my word, you'll be glad you did!",1053216000,12,2624,4.569296375266524
1638893,5,B00005O5AS,"The final fight is super cool and I can safely say that I am not at all disappointed.  These five episodes keep you glued to your seat.  Shishio seems to be an invincible [dude], but he is human after all.  Well, I think he's a freak of nature. Anyway, the Kenshin gumi gives their all, but is it enough?  You have to find out yourself, [right?].  Buy this now or [ELSE]!  ...",1043452800,,376,4.152777777777778
1638894,5,B00005O5AS,"If you would ask any Rurouni Kenshin fan what arc was their favorite, most likely they would say the Kyoto Arc. Filled with action-packed fight scenes and much more serious than the Tokyo Arc, it is the best arc in the RK Manga. Fire Requiem is the last five episodes of this epic chapter of Rurouni Kenshin. A master of Hiten-Mitsurugi Ryuu, former leader of the Oniwabanshuu Ninja, former gangster known as Zanza, former captain of the Shinsengumi Unit Three and the Battousai's successor duke it out in one place...that is Kyoto, where many of the Ishinshishi, the Shinsengumi and many other groups spilled blood with their swords during the Bakumatsu. The five fight scenes in the DVD are long, short, well-animated and powerful. Although there is a quite a bit of conversations, I guarantee that your eyes will be glued onto the television or the monitor at all times. The outtakes in the extras section are hilarious, worth watching over and over. The character messages that are also in the extras show the personalities of all of the major characters perfectly with their dubbed voice actors and actresses. The first four episodes are action-packed, quite emotional, and filled with suspense, while the final one is reassuring, peaceful and warm and fuzzy. Any Rurouni Kenshin fan should add this to their collection, for they would not be disappointed at all.",1040688000,,1368,4.952173913043478

You finally get to see Shishio and Kenshin square off.  With Shishio being the biggest threat to Japan and to Kenshin, you can't help but want to see the action of the fight, the emotions of those waiting for Kenshin and the others, plus Kenshins true character showing all of us why the series in general is worth watching.",1032912000,,490,4.545454545454546

7948271,5,B00005O5AS,"Kenshin Himura was an assassin for the imperialist army during the revolution. At the turning point something happened and he just vanished. 11 years later he encounters a girl named Kaoru while wandering through Tokyo. He saves her life just before she is killed trying to fight a notorious murderer. He begins living with her at her dojo. They gain new friends and have many adventures, but one day ghosts from Kenshin's murderous past come back to haunt him. His gentle nature gives way to a murderous side and Kaoru must stand by him to keep him from changing forever.

After Kenshin is defeated by Shishio, Aoshi, Sano, and Seito step in and fight. They have all been battling hard and don't have the energy to win, thus they are beaten also. They are able to buy time for Kenshin to get his second wind. The fight isn't over yet.

Rurouni Kenshin is an amazing anime series. Maybe even one of the best ever made. It has everything. Action, comedy, drama, suspense, romance, and mystery are all common themes in this anime. The amazing part is that it is based loosely on actual historical characters. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are all very well done. There are dozens of great and unforgettable characters. This anime is a legend, and is a must see for any anime fan. It's also pretty family friendly. It has violence, but it's pretty conservative.

7948275,5,B00005O5AS,"Season Two and the epic ""Legend of Kyoto"" story arc comes to an end on ""Rurouni Kenshin: Fire Requiem,"" the fourteenth collection of episodes of the Japanese anime, as Kenshin Himura fights for the future of the Meiji era against Sishio:
Episode 58, ""The Age Chooses Shishio?: Kenshin's Greatest Crisis,"" finds Kenshin down and out, with Saitoh and Sano in not much better shape to face Makoto Shisio.  But they go up against him nonetheless to stop Shisio's quest to rule Japan.  Episode 59, ""Not Out of Luck!: The Revival of a Fighting Spirit"" finds that only Aoshi Shinomori, already weakened by his fight with Kenshin, is left to stand against Shisio.  Meanwhile, Kenshin's thoughts on the edge of death turn to Ms. Kuro.  Episode 60, ""The Man Who is Chosen for Victory: Shishio Verus Kenshin, Finale"" tells you from the start that all the death matches between Kenshin and Shishio are finally going to come to an end.  Despite all of his evil deeds, Shishio saves the worst for last before meeting a most fitting fate.  At this point in the series Beethoven's 13th Piano Sonata (""Midnight Blue"") is introduced as a recurring music theme that is used to good effect throughout the rest of the season.  Once again the villain has an Achilles heel that saves the day for our hero, but at least this time there was a physiological twist that had to do with how Shisio was so badly burned.
Episode 61, ""The Juppongatana who Remain: A Choice for Life"" begins the two-part epilogue to the Kyoto storyline as Kenshin and the others are finally reunited and take time to heal before considering where their paths must go next.  Episode 62, ""Kyoto, the Engraved Memory: Begin with a Wish"" finds Kenshin and his friends finally returning home to Kuro's dojo, but not before Kenshin makes a visit to a very special place.  The characters might be back together again, but given everything that has happened they are changed, and we should see some interesting developments off of this in the third season of ""Rurouni Kenshin"" (to wit, Kenshin and Kuro might finally talk to each other about their feelings).

Extras on this DVD include the usual Liner Notes and a good sent of ad-libbed Outtakes, but this time there is also an Attack List that translates each of the attacks of Kenshin, Anji, Sanosuke, Saito, Misao, Aoshi, Shishio, Chou, Henya, Hannya, Raijuta, Jinei, Kamatari, Okina, Usui, and Yahiko.  So now you can appreciate the difference between the Ryu-tsui-sen (Dragon Hammer Flash) and the Ryu-shou-sen (Dragon Fight Flash), and, of course, the Sou-ryu-sen (Twin Dragon Flash).  There are also messages from the various characters that make for a nice touch at the end of Season Two.",1073260800,7,2689,4.83442265795207
7948276,5,B00005O5AS,"The Kyoto Arc is my personal favorite of all the Rurouni Kenshin storylines, be they manga or anime. It really goes deeper into Kenshin's past, his character, and the people who care for him than any other season in the series.
Fire Requiem is where it all goes down. Not only does Kenshin have to face his replacement and nemesis, Makoto Shishio, but he must defeat him without reverting to the Hitokiri Battousai, the killer mentality that nearly stole his humanity during the Bakumatsu period. He is aided by allies and enemies alike, all drawm together against a common foe, and the final blows are certainly something to remember.
Many consider this the end of the Ruouni Kenshin saga in any way shape or form. They are wrong, but this is a great end to a wonderful storyline, and the translation from manga to anime form couldn't have been better.
The DVD package is made all the sweeter by a few gems in the extras (the cast REALLY had fun with the outtakes) and, of course, the spectacular Heart of Sword as the ending episode theme. No Kenshin collection should be without it.",1070064000,3,1085,4.626943005181347
