7868967,5,6304364377,"I watched on TV, just by chance, this production of Romeo & Juliet. The combination of Prokofiev's great music with the fantastic performance of the Monte Carlo Ballet - immediately forced me to book this outstanding DVD. Most enjoyable!!!

7868968,4,6304364377,"Amazing, but...

First, the amazing parts:  1), Truly creative concept.  Maillot takes a totally fresh look at this ballet and does wonders with it.  In his concept the title could more aptly be ""Juliette and the Friar"", as those two do the most dancing and the Friar plays the role, in essence, of an oracular chorus who foresees the developing tragedy and makes an attempt (in a puppet show--superb) to warn the principals.  The oracle/chorus provides a fine unifying thread.  2), Excellent choreography.  When you're onstage here, you're dancing--no sitting around and watching.  His dancers must enjoy dancing in his works.  Creative throughout.  3), Magnificent details.  I've already alluded to the puppet show, so superbly choreographed to the ""Dance with Mandolins"" that it far overshadows any other choreography I've seen for this dance.  In addition, there is the interesting ""subplot"" involving Lady Capulet, who at the start of the ballet is quite apparently in mourning over the death of Lord C, but at the same time seems like she has, or might have, the hots for Tybalt, who we might well infer had something to do with Lord C's demise.  Many other fine details as well.  4), Gorgeous dancers.  Enough said.  I could go on here, but now for the

But...  1), Coppieters as Juliette.  Great dancer, for sure.  But as Juliette?  Even in this sexed-up production?  BC is certainly the most masculine-looking Juliette you (or I) will ever encounter, what with her ""cut"" body and short hair.  Now if Maillot had made Romeo more feminine, then we might have something here, but he didn't.  Very hard to get used to, and I confess that I have not.  2), Romeo's choreography and costuming.  In this ballet one almost doesn't notice Romeo (!), as his role is not choreographically emphasized and, to drive the last nail into the coffin, he is costumed in white against a white background.  What were they thinking?  In sum, I never got the feeling of any real chemistry between R and J--more's the pity.

My over-all experience of this production is one of awe but not love.  Great feast for the eye and the mind, but not for the heart and the soul.  If you want heart and soul in a creative new take on this ballet, I heartily (no pun intended) recommend Preljocaj with the Lyon Opera Ballet.",1272931200,10,2298,4.770992366412214
7868969,4,6304364377,"This is one of my favorites. The sets are a bit drab (I don't understand the constant blue lighting), but the performances from the singers make up for it. All of the supporting roles are well sung, but it is Romeo and Juliet that make this a production to remember.

Alagna is in fine voice -- his ""Ah! leve-toi, soleil!"" is magnificent. As the opera goes on, his voice can be unsteady and a bit out of tune at times, but overall this is a very good performance. His acting is also very believable, as is Vaduva's. They both look and act the part. Vaduva's voice is somewhat strained at times, but for the majority of the time she sings the part well. Together, Alagna and Vaduva are captivating to watch. The tomb scene especially will bring tears to your eyes.

The combination of Gounod's achingly beautiful music and the fine singing/acting make this a treat to experience. 4 stars.",1133568000,11,887,4.5375
7868970,5,6304364377,"Charles Gounod is frequently accused by critics of being ""too pretty"" or ""too sentimental"", yet his masterpiece, Faust, is one of the most performed operas in history. Romeo is close to Faust insofar as its lyrically melodic score is concerned and when well sung and staged, is a real treat to the eyes and ears. Having seen it onstage twice, I was prepared to be critical, but also to be captured by a good performance. This is a very good performance. Alagna has enough youthfulness at this stage in his career to be a believable Romeo, and he sings the role with magnificent vocal technique as well as near perfect French. (I stopped and replayed the second act aria, ""Ah! Leve- toi  soleil ..."" so that my significant other could enjoy it.) In fact, one of the real pleasures of this disc is the French diction of all the performers. I had never seen or heard Leontina Vaduva (Juliette) before watching this disc, but she does a great job as the teenaged heroine. Vocally, her lyric, coloratura is ideal for the role and her opening aria, ""je veux vivre..."" is perfectly realized. She can act, too, as evidenced by all her interactions onstage, particularly, and not at all surprising, with Romeo. Particular mention should be made of Anna Maria Panzarella in the "" trousers role"" of Stephano, Romeo's page. She has a fine voice and great stage presence. Maestro Mackerras coducts with respect for the emotional nature of the score. The tape to disc transfer is near perfect, as is the recorded sound. As I have noted in other reviews, the DVD medium is next best to live theatre, because the viewer sees and hears the performance, and can experience the totality of the operatic experience. So, if you are looking to see what opera is all about, or introduce older children to the genre, this performance is hard to beat, because the music is consistantly lovely, and the onstage action is ongoing. And if you are, like me, a longtime opera fan, just buy this disc, and if you don't find it enjoyable, send me an e-mail challenge to this review. The domestic cultural scene, unfortunately, sees fewer opera performances, except in major cities like New York. The DVD medium, fortunately, lets good operatic performances come to our homes. Enjoy!!",1010188800,58,2251,4.757033248081841
7868971,5,6304364377,"This was a stunner in the vhs format and the dvd version only enhances what is a classic theatrical experience. Alagna and Vaduva sing and act as if they were Romeo et Juliette. The tomb scene is utterly shattering. If this scene doesn't move you, you need a heart transplant. Mackerras brings to life this great Gounod score. Alagna and Vaduva sing with ardent glory and passion, beautiful in timber, strong and yet fragile at the same time. Sets are simple and very effective. Le Reux and Lloyd must be singled out also in what is a handpicked cast. I don't think this performance will ever be surpassed. The magazine ""opera Now"" considered it a ""classic to be"" in their very powerful review. Of the top ten dvd operas now available, this is humber 1/2. Beautiful music, superbly sung and acted. This belongs in every collection.",1005782400,23,831,4.698630136986301
