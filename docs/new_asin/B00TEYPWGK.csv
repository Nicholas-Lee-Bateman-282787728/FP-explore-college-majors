8701446,4,B00TEYPWGK,"This Victorian Era Comedy about the state sanctioning a trial brothel to control  prostitution in the upscale West End of London is quite charming.  I found it to be more naughty than ribald or raunchy, cheeky in that unmistakable whimsical British way. Nudge, nudge. Wink, wink.  Know what I mean? Know what I mean?  The film may be commenting on social mores in late Nineteenth Century Britain but these observations could be applicable to the time it was made in the late Sixties. Quite good are David Hemmings in the dual roles of smarmy proprietor of the cathouse and as a nave publicist as well as George Sanders as an unscrupulous opium plantation owner.  Curiously the film was slapped with the ""X"" rating by the then nascent MPAA but there's no graphic sex on display and fleeting nudity.  If resubmitted today it would at best rate a ""PG-13"" and at the very worst a soft ""R"".  The Leonard Maltin movie guide assigns the film the BOMB rating dismissing it as boring but I found it to be quite rollicking and lively. A pre-Python John Cleese has a bit as an attach to India.",1433030400,,1082,4.575129533678757
