Formula movie as part the 50 Movie Pack Sci-Fi Classics DVD collections. Yes I know it is just another invisible strangler movie (title: The Astral Factor).

The story is of a deranged killer that has to kill any one the looks like his mother. To look like his mother all you have to do is look female and be in the tabloids. He was well pinned in a maximum security nut house until he discovered astral projection and other Para-psychic phenomenon. On the loose and invisible (don't we wish we all were) he is free to do the deed with impunity. However hot on his trail is Lt. Charles Barrett who suspects he is up against something more than your standard nutter.

The only redeeming value of this movie is the many actors that were not quite over the hill at the time this movie was made yet were persuaded to take part:

Robert Foxworth as Lt. Charles Barrett (The Questor Tapes (TV movie) - Questor)
Stefanie Powers as Candy Barrett (Paper Man (TV movie) - Karen McMillan)
Elke Sommer as Chris Hartman (A Shot in the Dark - Maria Gambrelli)",1523318400,,1086,4.46969696969697

8022544,3,B00025X3O8,"Invisible Stranger is a re-edited and re-shot version of The Astral Factor.  Comparison between the two editions show that Invisible Stranger has been re-shot up through the first few minutes.  The rest of the film is re-edited, has had some scenes removed or changed(alternate shots?), and all the colorful astral effects are gone and he just plain disappears instead.  Some minor characters have been played by different actors.  All this has shortened the film a few minutes from the original length.  The Miracle Pictures DVD itself is good quality, in full screen, and doesn't have any serious problems.  They seem to be playing down the astral part of the film.  I prefer the longer original version for the additional astral effects and at least the killer is better looking, acts cool like a human being, and gets some dialogue, instead of the spaced-out moronic look they gave him in IS.  Astral Factor is available on many DVDS.",1454716800,,938,4.929936305732484

8022546,2,B00025X3O8,"I have no clue knowing how many movies have been made about invisible people.  However, most of them have been a waste of time.  This 1976 movie falls in the category of time waster, though it does feature a stellar cast.

Roger Sands (Frank Ashmore) is a convicted killer sitting in prison.  Roger has developed his mental powers so that he can do miraculous things, like turning mattresses upside down, knocking a gun from a person's hand, and (surprise!) turning invisible.  After watching this movie, I realized that turning invisible is a good talent to have in prison.

Roger uses a ""Star Trek"" sparkly effect to make himself invisible one day, and then promptly escapes from prison.  Soon Roger is having a good time killing women who look like his mother, and any men who get in his way.  Lt. Charles Barrett (Robert Foxworth) has been assigned to investigate the murders.  Barrett has an active role in this movie.  He runs around a lot and puts up with his goofy wife Candy (Stefanie Powers), who cooks in a fur coat and panties and jumps on Barrett when he is not looking.  Actually, Barrett could have been absent for most of the movie, but he is the character the director decided to use as the protagonist.  He does survive Roger Sands and Candy, so perhaps he was a good choice.

In all the running about, we see Elke Sommer, Queenie Smith (""Foul Play"" and numerous other roles), Robert Hoy and numerous other well-known character actors.  The movie is filled with experienced acting talent.  Unfortunately, all the acting talent struggles to make anything of this movie.  The acting is frequently overdone.  I am reminded me of a comedy I once saw where the actors were supposed to ""emote.""

There were moments in the movie that seemed to make no sense at all.  For example, when Sands goes on a yacht in scuba gear, why is he visible when he has been invisible for most of the movie?  When Sands comes out of the ocean a short time later, he turns himself and his scuba gear invisible, so I know he had the ability to turn himself and his scuba gear invisible.

The movie also uses an ultra-cheesy effect to let you know when Sands is using his power; Sands' eyes have lights animated on them.  Gee, it was so nice to have those annoying lights with the funky sound effects to match to let me know when Sands was using his power.  I was unable to tell when the books, mattress and guns were flying around.  Speaking of annoyance, Lt. Charles Barrett's sidekick (Detective Hill I believe, played by Mark Slade) kept clicking his pen.  I wanted to smack his sidekick, and then I wanted to smack Barrett for letting Detective Hill click that pen.

The only bright spot in this movie was Stefanie Powers.  She stole every scene as the comic relief for this movie.  I would watch this movie again just to watch her.

This movie, which has gone under the titles ""The Astral Factor"" and ""Invisible Stranger: The Astral Factor,"" is just not worth watching unless you are a fan of invisible people movies or Stefanie Powers.  Everyone else will find that this movie adds little to the horror or science fiction genres.

Good luck!",1344902400,,3138,4.589928057553957
8022547,1,B00025X3O8,"Frank Ashmore (Airplane!, V) stars as Roger Sands who is a convicted man who winds up making himself invisible and escape his jail cell. Robert Foxworth (Syriana, Beyond The Stars) plays the Lieutenant on the case. He has to protect several women who testified against Sands. One by one Sands goes after the women and Foxworth wants to find The Astral Inisible Factor and stop him for good. Badly acted, horrible directed and executed thriller has bloodless chills and thrills. The effects are dumber then dirt. Nothing can save this bottom of the barrel mess. Its simply dreadful. The editing is bad as well. I saw LOOP pop on the screen a couple of times. Also starring Stefanie Powers (Deceptions, Hart to Hart), Sue Lyon (Alligator, End of the World) and Mark Slade (Flashpoint, Waikiki)",1151020800,,791,4.866666666666666
8022548,2,B00025X3O8,"This is a turgid little piece of melodramatic nonsense featuring some extremely bad acting (from people who should really know better), a dreadful script, and some of the worst special effects since ""Plan 9.""

The basic premise is that Roger Sands, an ultra-brainy lunatic with maternal abandonment issues, studies ESP and learns to become invisible at which point he starts stalking women who remind him of his mother. He has numerous flashbacks of his mom, and even visits her in the cemetery, where they have a dialogue that explains the background for the film in what is one of the most trite of all plot devices. I should really mention that the special effects in this film will, in all likelihood, make you laugh out loud, with the best of the bunch being the ESP-induced invisibility attainment via an effect that is straight out of the transporter room from ""Star Trek,"" only not as well done.

The detective ""heroes"" in the film are universally unlikable, but at least one of them (Robert Foxworth) dates Stephanie Powers, who engages in numerous diversionary scenes that pad the plot immensely (please especially note the cake-baking in a mink scene.) I suppose the biggest star power in the movie has to be Elke Sommer, who plays a rich alcoholic nag in some of the most ridiculous costumes I have seen in a while. (One makes her look like the inmate.)

I should note in an effort to add nuance (or at least running time) to the film, there is a subplot about a dancer in a modern dance production that is shown for far too long. I am not a fan of musicals, and I am definitely not a fan of modern dance, so you might suspect that I would really dislike faux-modern dance stage musicals presented at length within a bad supernatural thriller from the 1970s. You would be right. This production is painful to endure, and you will be relieved when Foxworth mercifully jumps onstage and stops it.

Truly this is a poorly made film that is about as campy as you can get. Nonetheless I give it two stars for having some unintentionally entertaining moments as well as laugh-out-loud campy special effects, particularly in the finale where the disembodied voice yells ""I never wanted to hurt you, Mama,"" which is clearly a lie, providing an even weaker resolution to an already weak film.",1146528000,,2295,4.701492537313433
8022549,3,B00025X3O8,"Celebrity stalker / killer, Roger Sands is serving a life sentence in a hospital for the criminally insane. Unfortunately, he has been studying psychic phenomena in his spare time. Sands is now able to leave the hospital by turning invisible! Now, he seeks to hunt down and strangle the women on his hit-list; all of whom are dancers, models, or actresses. All of these poor women remind Sands of his own actress mother, who refused to ever acknowledge that he was her son. Mum paid for this with her life, becoming Sands' first victim. Enter Robert Foxworth (Prophecy) as the cop who must stop Sands before he exacts his full revenge. THE ASTRAL FACTOR is not bad for a pre-Halloween / Friday The 13th serial killer-on-the-loose movie. The fact that the killer is invisible adds a bit of supernatural tension. The fact that both Elke Sommer and Stefanie Powers (Die! Die! My Darling!) are in it adds a lot of dee-lightful moments! Powers is especially good as Foxworthy's extremely playful girlfriend. At any rate, I liked this one enough to watch it twice in one day, but then I'm a sucker for junky movies...",1122768000,6,1111,4.731958762886598
