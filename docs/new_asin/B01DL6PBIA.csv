7719049,5,B01DL6PBIA,"Ride the dusty trail with this set of western classics from long ago. This set I found has lots of wonderful movie gems I found. Mostly the classics are of John Wayne but quite a bit of Tex Ritter as well as others like Randolph Scott, Roy Rogers, and Gene Autry. Plus the fact that this is a digital download with it is a plus but only if you have a device like iPad or iPhone.",1493424000,2,378,3.986842105263158

This product has twelve double-sided DVDs containing fifty movies from the 1930s and 1940s, the prime era for traditional Westerns. There is a wide range of actors in this set, many now long forgotten. About one-third star Roy Rogers, a popular actor who played in a wide range of stories. Four feature Gene Autry, the best singing cowboy in those times. Other films star: Harry Carey Sr., Johnny Mack Brown, Buster Crabbe, Hoot Gibson, Ken Maynard, Buck Jones, Tim McCoy, Tex Ritter, Bob Steele, Randolph Scott, etc.

Most stories are concerned with saving a small ranch or business from economic disaster. Big landowners, or robbers, threaten these small businesses. This must echo the fears of the small movie producers who were threatened by the big studios and their control of movie theater chains. These movies from the late 1930s often had music and singing as part of the story (""horse operas""). There was a limited amount of gunfire. The usual story showed the hero saving the ranch or farm, and getting rewarded by a grateful young woman. It was like those older stories where a young man performs a task successfully then winds up marrying his employer's daughter. Other stories has the stars working undercover, as US Marshals or Texas Rangers to neutralize various criminal gangs, like the private detective stories that were also popular. In the 19th century the many Committees of Vigilance and Regulators controlled crime and protected people. This was not shown because of the political implications of a volunteer militia as a police force.

Most of these films are set in modern times where they have automobiles, telephones, radio, etc. This provides more realism to the audience. The right to keep and bear arms was well-recognized when these films were made. These classic westerns began to decline in the 1940s when stories became concerned with personal conflicts rather than economic troubles. Horses became scarcer after the end of WW II when tractors replaced horses. Increasing costs harmed the low-budget movie studios. The decline in movie audiences matched a vast increase in television viewing. ""Shane"" was one of the last movies where small farmers and ranchers were threatened by a big landowner's greed for their lands. [""The Banditti of the Plains"" provides an historical example from the 1890s.] ""High Noon"" was an example of the new style of personal conflicts driving the story.
