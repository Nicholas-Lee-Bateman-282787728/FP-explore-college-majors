7960710,5,B0000648XD,I purchased this set sometime ago from Amazon. A must have set of stand up comedy -- its very funny and entertaining. Its remind me of my collage years. Watching it with friends while drinking beers and smoking you know what!,1408665600,,225,4.512195121951219
7960711,2,B0000648XD,I thought Martin Lawrence would be on these.  NOPE! It's the episodes after he left.  Even Joe Torry isn't in these ones.  I was REALLY disappointed.  The advertising for this product made it seem like these were the original episodes.  Boo!,1254614400,7,241,4.780487804878049
7960712,5,B0000648XD,"Great, funny, outrageous.... This set has a combination of both dry and ""wet"" humor. I am a big fan of black comedy and this is definitely a great set to start with, especiallyl for me. During the time of these acts being filmed I was barely in elementary and was clueless about cable television, so watching this now, certainly takes me back to memory lane of all the things that were happening at that time. Great collection if you want to start your comedy library, no dvd collection should be without!!!",1041897600,5,507,4.582417582417582
