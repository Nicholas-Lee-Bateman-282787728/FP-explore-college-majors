7996457,3,B0000A5BW0,"This DVD and techniques shown in it are very good however I do have some problems with them. Aginst slashes MacYoung recommends going backwards...That is good advice but the fact is that on the street there are many things that can destroy your balance and put you on the ground if you do not see them (like curbs, uneven ground etc.). That is a very bad scenario for obvious reasons. I was always advised by my instructors not to go backwards the only way was forward or to the flank so unless you know for sure there is nothing and no one behind you I personally would recommend this tacitc. The other thing is that this DVD deals almost purely with the assumption that you can escape and aginst armed opponent that would be my first choice and it is the best choice but there are times when  escape is not possible. Like you are attacked in metro train or you are with someone who cannot run (your grandmother) at that moment you need to step up and neutralize the threat. Make no mistake your chances are very slim but sometimes the escape is just not possible. The last thing is more of a personal preference and that is MacYoung's humor I just do not find him funny at all. I only wish Rory Miller would make DVD like this but he himself told me he is not planning to and that is pitty...",1452211200,,1294,4.30327868852459

7996461,4,B0000A5BW0,"I recently watched this and thought it was pretty good.

The advice is pretty sound, the concepts presented pretty well and fairly dramatically. Things are explained in a clear and easy to understand fashion.

I'm not sure why I'm not giving it five stars. Perhaps because it explains concepts and not techniques, perhaps because it's the kind of DVD or tape that you watch it a couple times and you pretty much have grasped what it says. Regardless, the tape offers good advice and clear concepts in an easy to follow manner.

If you wish to learn about defense against knife attacks I would recommend this as one of the first tapes that you try to watch.",1356825600,,656,4.589743589743589
7996462,5,B0000A5BW0,"Like Caliber Press' ""Surviving Edged Weapons"", this is also a classic and a must have to grasp the American take on the street knife assault experience.",1348444800,,152,4.884615384615385
7996463,4,B0000A5BW0,"This film covers only defending against a knife attack. There is a separate film from the same instructors that is devoted to attacking (Winning a street knife fight).
The film covers the basics very well, and in detail. All the techniques they instruct are very simple, and you get the impression that that's all that is needed (I haven't been in a knife fight, so I have no experience myself). The instructors (Marc Mac Young and Richard Dodson) explain very well all the techniques, and they also demonstrate why these techniques are good and effective. There is also much humor in the film, making the film enjoyable to watch.
The instruction of the film is very good, but the production is not of the same standard. With better production, this film would be worth 5 stars.
Run time: 59 minutes
DVD extra: Winning a street knife fight (59 minutes). Also available separately on VHS; see separate review.",1067817600,7,908,4.789808917197452
7996464,4,B0000A5BW0,"If you seek a video that will explaine to you how to stay alive if you ever encounter a street knife attack... THIS VIDEO IS FOR YOU!
With realistic situation, basic and simple mouves that every one can do, this video is a MUST for all people that might encounter a knife attaque in there every day life.
Unfortunately, there is no answer on how to neutralize your opponent. Only how to escape, wich is the most important part to stay alive.",982108800,2,441,4.390243902439025
