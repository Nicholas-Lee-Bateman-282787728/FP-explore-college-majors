7009197,5,B00TGNLUSI,A few years ago this series was released but there was some type copyright issue with the music that caused a big ruckus. Does anyone know if that problem has been corrected with this set?,1430524800,,188,4.4
7009198,5,B00TGNLUSI,"In addition to ""What's the Difference?"", could some purchaser of this set comment on the status of the background music on these sets. In the original half-season releases there was controversy because much of the soundtrack music was not included. That music is critical to this show!! CBS made some half-hearted attempts to replace discs with some of the music restored. I will happily purchase a new set but only if I can be sure the music is included. My five star review is because I love this show and a complete restoration would be fantastic.",1430352000,4,550,4.739583333333333

7009200,4,B00TGNLUSI,"I owned all 4 seasons, totaling 8 volumes(since sold).  I've purchased TWO library additions of "" The Fugitive: The Most Wanted Edition "" - all 120 episodes.  The first purchased contained numerous video/audio synchronization errors that were a manufacturing defect.  After CBS/Paramount corrected the problem, and did right by issuing free replacement discs for defective segments, I decided I would start with a clean slate and purchase it AGAIN( . . go ahead and call me stupid, but I ADORE this classic television series).  My question: Why not up the ante and transfer this edition to sparkling high definition?  If I'm not mistaken, all footage of the series was shot in 35mm film.  It would look FABULOUS! . . .

7009201,1,B00TGNLUSI,"&&&&& UPDATE &&&&&
I am updating my review.  This is a travesty of major proportion.  Paramount is once again forcing the Heyes scored discs on the public.  I was so excited to own this classic series as I thought that Paramount would be using the corrected discs in this set.  Seems I placed to much faith in this company.  I have cancelled this order.  Please remember, ""Buyer Beware"".

I have this set pre-ordered.  I have fond memories of this show as it was one of my parents ""can't miss"" shows.  They discussed it with their neighbors and people at church.  I did not become interested until I was grown and tuned into the A&E syndicated run.  I watched a few until I caught ""The Girl from Little Egypt"" ... WOW!!!  At that point I was hooked.  I used VHS tapes to record the episodes.  I was impressed withe the caliber and quality of each weeks guest stars.  What a wonderful series.  I was unable to afford the Most Wanted set, but was able to order this.  I can't hardly contain my desire for this set.  My only hope is that all the episodes are correct and do not need to be part of another replacement set.  I am eager to relive the running, the troubled people that Dr. Kimble aids and seeing the ""day the running stopped"".",1430179200,10,1236,4.365638766519824
7009202,5,B00TGNLUSI,"Just for the record here...awhile back, the series was presented in Season format 1 thru 4, in two parts each, it took roughly 4 years to get all four seasons out.
I'm not saying putting this complete series out is a bad thing, especially for folks who missed the initial releases of the series before but I'm just wondering why they feel the need to re-release it again since the seasons are still out there, probably still on here, although might be cheaper getting this baby instead. In any event, it's a great series, probably the best one ever put out on network TV, R.I.P David Janssen.",1430006400,6,592,4.542056074766355
7009203,5,B00TGNLUSI,"I don't own this series yet but I am anxious for its release. I'm 63 now and can remember vividly when this aired on TV. Our family was hooked on it especially my late mom. I think it was on either Tuesday or Thursday nights. But when it was on my mom went as far as taking the phone off the hook and wouldn't even answer the door. She wanted no interruptions. The commercials were the only chance you had to use the restroom, grab a snack, etc. etc. We were all hopelessly hooked. David Janssen was really the right fit for the part and what a great actor. So sad he died so untimely and at such young age too. He did another series after The Fugitive I believe it was called Harry O. It didn't run very long as I recall, but it was good. R.I.P. Mr. Janssen.",1429142400,14,759,4.066666666666666

Update: JUne 16

I have now watched the complete first 2 seasons and am into the third and so far I HAVE NOT NOTICED ANY EPISODE THAT HAS REPLACEMENT MUSIC. All the episodes had the ORIGINAL theme music throughout the episode and at the end. If you notice, all the people complaining about the 'replacement' music wrote their reviews within a day or 2 of the release, they didn't even bother to sit through and watch all these episodes to see if they were correct with their assumptions. I got my copy through Amazon. CA during the first week it came out and absolutely DO NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS at all regarding any replacement music. It is a shame that all these negative reviews are on the first page of this great series, and that many people are getting voted down, possibly because of false information about this set. Apparently CBS/Paramount has corrected the earlier problem with this set and has put back the original music, this is one of the Best bargains you will get for a complete series of classic televison.

7009236,5,B00TGNLUSI,"All in all a great Series!
Read my comments regarding this Series and then go on You Tube Videos and type:
The Fugitive 1963. The REAL Pilot Episode. A condensed version.  Plus Stills.
Watch this movie on TV via HDMI on your laptop.  it's brilliant.
Apologies for poor quality.
Here we go!
I watched the REAL Pilot Episode the week before  Fear In A Desert City was first aired in 1963!  (I was 22 years old at the time).
I swear to God this is true. I am not lying. Why would I? What would be the point in doing so?
I have joined and edited segments together(14 minutes in total) in their correct order to make a proper movie showing the truth regarding this matter.
(Who's a clever boy, then?).
These segments were taken from The Girl From Little Egypt. Season 1. Episode 14.
These segments themselves were taken from The REAL Pilot Episode and should very much suggest to you that there was, indeed, an earlier story in existence.
Assume, as everybody does, this REAL Pilot Episode doesn't exist.
RIGHT!
So.
It's taken until Episode 14 to find out ANYTHING about Kimble's life before his wife was murdered!
Hey!  Thanks a lot, QM Productions!
We find out NOW that his wife's name was Helen!
We find out NOW that his son was stillborn!
We find out NOW that his wife had started drinking!
We find out NOW that they had started having arguments about adoption!
All this has taken 14 Episodes before we find this out!
This Episode or a similar storyline would have been much better to have started the Series with, wouldn't it?
What on earth was the matter with you lot at Q M Productions?
Well, nothing. Nothing at all!
They did a great job with this! The true fact being that this Pilot Episode went missing!
There are two crucial points here.
a)  Q M Productions were not aware that this Episode was never included in the Series after they sold it.
b)  CBS Paramount  were never aware that it ever existed in the first place.
Both companies.
NOT GUILTY.
This old tape is still languishing in an old film can in the Archives /Basement of a TV Network Station or a collectors shed/outhouse or attic somewhere.
CBS Paramount you are sitting on a goldmine here.
Find this Episode and re-issue Season 1 volume 1 as a Special Edition with the Wanted Poster as the artwork. (Tug of War. Season 2. Vol 1. Episode 7).
Please Do NOT print anything fancy about finding this Episode on the front  cover artwork!
Either print it on the back or just put it on your Product information regarding 'Special Edition'.
Think of what the customer would like to look at on the cover and NOT just yourselves trying to drum up sales!
That won't be needed, I assure you.
Also please don't do this Manufactured DVD-R  on demand cheap rubbish. Quality DVD please.
Be proud of yourselves.
Please re-issue the whole Series as Region Free for those living in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. You are absolutely no help at all with this at the present time, are you?
Now THAT would drum up your sales!
So come on and hunt him down.
He is a fugitive, after all !

This is second set, the first was returned due to damage but both sets stated at the bottom of the box in small red on black background print difficult to read and see: (some episodes may be edited from their original network versions) (Music has been changed for this home entertainment version)  I still enjoyed seeing the series simply because I never saw but a few of the original episodes so I do not have any comparison of the correct music or know if episodes have scenes added or subtracted.  I did want other buyers to beware that the sets I received stated information about changed music and possible scene changes.  I included some images with writing on the bottom of the DVD box.

7009268,5,B00TGNLUSI,"The most notable CLASSIC Television drama in the history of television.
ROY HUGGINS created ""THE FUGITIVE"" in 1960 and the Manuscript sat in his desk drawer for over two years.  LEONARD GOLDENSON, the new President of  ABC Television Network was seeking a drama for his fledgling network.  ABC was near bankruptcy.  Mr. Goldenson's  Programming executives and other executives were flat-out against ""THE FUGITIVE"".  Mr. Goldenson had a vision and overruled his executives.

On September 17, 1963, ""Dr. Richard Kimble"", wrongly convicted of murdering his wife, en route to Indiana State Prison to await execution, when the ""Big Hand of Fate"" moved.  The train derailed, allowing Kimble to escape from ""Lt. Phillip Gerard"",  the detective responsible for his conviction.  For the next four years, ""Dr. Kimble"" was free . . . free to run, to hide, to search for the ""One Armed Man"" he had seen fleeing his home.

""THE FUGITIVE"" MADE DAVID JANSSEN an International Star.  Mr. Janssen had been ""hand-picked"" by QUINN MARTIN, Executive Producer to be ""DR. RICHARD KIMBLE"".  Mr. Martin selected British Actor BARRY MORSE for the role of  ""LT. PHILLIP GERARD"", and BILL RAISCH to star as ""FRED JOHNSON"" (the One-Armed Man).  Mr. Raisch had lost his left arm in WW II.

DAVID JANSSEN appeared in nearly every scene in all 120 episodes.  The series required numerous ""on location"" filming and a rigorous filming schedule.
Mr. Janssen's unique acting skills garnered him international fame and his breathtakingly handsome features and gravelly voice brought him the love of millions of women fans around the world.

Physically and mentally exhausted, Mr. Janssen decided to end his role after four long years.  He refused substantial financial rewards to go ""just one more year"".

On Tuesday, August 29, 1967, ""THE DAY THE RUNNING STOPPED!"", the second part of ""THE JUDGMENT"" aired, exactly four years to the day and hour ""THE FUGITIVE"" finale aired on ABC TV.  It set a new Nielsen Rating record of 72% of all U. S. Households with televisions tuned in, an estimated 32 Million viewers.  This record held until March of 1980.  DAVID JANSSEN died of a massive heart attack on February 13, 1980.

Although I was a devoted viewer of ""THE FUGITIVE"" for its last two seasons, and it is still in syndication on cable television networks,  having ""THE FUGITIVE"" The Complete Series through Amazon, is a treasured possession.  This is the complete series with the music of Pete Rugolo, a good friend of Mr. Janssen's, who also composed music for his previous hit series  ""Richard Diamond-Private Detective"".

I'm not sure how to explain it, but it seems wholesome considering the subject matter. I'm a person that absolutely loathes the garbage that poses as tv shows these days. I simply refuse to watch current tv shows.

If tv shows of today irritate and annoy you, watching this series is like a breath of fresh air. I also recommend getting The Naked City and Route 66 tv series as well.",1488931200,5,475,4.3977272727272725
7009289,5,B00TGNLUSI,"After years and years and years and years of problems, CBS/Paramount has finally got it right with The Fugitive. I purchased The Fugitive: The Complete Series, from Amazon in March 2017 and all of the original musical cues are intact.

In the late 2000s, CBS began releasing the series in half-season sets. Volumes One and Two of Season One were outstanding. Then the trouble began with the release of Season Two: Volume One. All of the original music was removed, and replaced by a synthesizer score composed by Mark Heyes. The replacement music did not fit with the show and the complaints about it were fierce.

CBS/Paramount responded to those concerns by issuing a replacement set for S2V1. While some episodes in the replacement set had their original music restored, others contained a mixture of the original cues and the Mark Heyes synthesizer score. And that's how it was for the release of Volume Two for Season Two, as well as volumes one and two for Season Three. Many episodes featured a mix of Heyes and original music. The reason for this was due, apparently, to CBS's inability to clear the rights for much of the music used for the series.

For the two volumes released for Season Four, however, the music was mostly all original. In 2011, CBS released The Fugitive: The Most Wanted Edition, a set that included all four seasons of the series with all original music restored. However, a replacement program was needed for this set, as well, because some episodes still included Heyes music while other episodes were error-laden and wouldn't play.

In 2015, CBS/P released The Fugitive: The Complete Series (the one I just bought), but again a replacement program was needed. Many of the Season Two and Season Three episodes afflicted with the Heyes synthesizer score were contained in this release. Those who complained about it were sent copies of the pricier Most Wanted Edition as a replacement. Some who received the Most Wanted Edition replacement set for the Complete Series then had to complain again because they had received bad copies, and needed additional replacement discs.

But now, finally, everything is right in the world. The Complete Series sets being sold now - at least the ones from Amazon - contain all the original music and I've found no signs of synthesizer music. I checked many of the previously problematic episodes (episodes loaded with Heyes music), and they are now Heyes-free. Brass Ring, Ballad for a Ghost, The Iron Maiden, Escape Into Black, Moon Child ... all of these great episodes and more were ruined in the original DVD releases by containing music that did not fit with the time period of this series. Now, they are restored to the way that they were originally broadcast.

Thank you, CBS/Paramount, for finally getting this right. I gave up on this after your release of volumes One and Two for Season Two, and now I'm back on board.",1488672000,104,2896,4.852226720647773

7009317,5,B00TGNLUSI,"The Fugitive made television history. Firstly, it broke one of the cardinal rules for network television characters: It's hero was a criminal. Remember, Dr. Kimble was fleeing the law, while trying to prove his innocence. The fact that he did not commit the murder he was accused of made no less a criminal in this case. In the 1960s, when there were only 3 TV networks to choose from (even independent stations airing movies and sports still only had reruns of previous network shows to supplement their programming) that was simply not allowed. Also, suggesting that our criminal justice could malfunction to the point of condemning an innocent man to death was tantamount to heresy. Then, it set a record for the single most-watched episode in American TV history at that, with it's two-part series finale, which tied up the story with a neat little bow. This set the stage for other shows to emulate, with series finales designed to wrap up all their respective story arcs, including the first show to break that record: The two 1/2 hour series finale of M*A*S*H. The stories remain as riveting, the performances of David Jansen and Barry Morse continue to standout as among the finest dramatic portrayals of their day, if not in the history of American television.
Fortunately, the quality of the DVDs in this set allow these performances to be seen in the best possible way.",1471046400,6,1380,4.851694915254237

There is no problem with the performance of any of the characters, it's the roles they must play in the stories that is the fault of the writers.  I'm surprised the series was allowed to continue to the end of the season.  The very end was good, however, if again, highly improbable.",1463356800,2,571,4.5588235294117645

7009349,5,B00TGNLUSI,"I ordered this over Labor Day weekend 2015 and had it delivered today.  I did put in the Brass Ring episode where some disks had replacement music and some did not.  All the music appears to be original.  I had watched the Fugitive occasionally on Sundays on METV with original music and did see this episode on ME TV. I don't have a photographic memory, but it does appear to have the same music. The music also matches the youtube posts for this episode. So far, I have watched Season Two, V.II disk one; all music is original. I have slowly been working my  way through Season 2. It's really well done if you get the original music. If CBS will still guarantee replacement disks or send you the Most Wanted Series if you version is not original music, I would definitely order  I'll post more info later.

It looks like Amazon sold out of the original stock in early September. Hopefully, this means that all the new orders will only receive  the corrected original music sets.

If you have not seen the show it was one of CBS best from the late 1950s/60s:  quite similar to Rawhide and Perry Mason in quality of stories and acting, which were A+ CBS shows in my view.",1441670400,9,1171,4.409302325581395

The packaging is fine, some people have complained but I see no problem with the way the disks are stored. It is actually a fairly compact set considering it is a 32 disk set.
The print quality is excellent and very viewable. I have just watched one episode so far and it looks like a very interesting series with a huge array of quest stars.
For the price that Amazon is charging I would jump on this set as it will give you 120 hours of what looks like very suspenseful high quality entertainment from a by gone era.

After reading some Amazon reviews, I looked up the episode The Brass Ring (Season 2, Vol 2, Disc 1) on You Tube (there's more than one video online) and confirmed that my set had replacement music as the amusement park music in the opening scene was that of a synthesizer drum machine.

I called Vision Media on 19th June from Australia. They promptly asked for my Complete Series bar code number and advised that they would send me some replacement discs within 3 - 4 weeks as they were actioning this in monthly batches. A large package arrived a couple of days ago and I was surprised to have received the full The Fugitive - The Most Wanted Edition rather than a handful of replacement discs.

I decided to check the quality of my Complete Series discs versus the Most Wanted Edition discs based on info in a recent Amazon review. Turns out that while the Most Wanted Edition box set I received a couple of days ago probably has all or most of the original music intact (Brass Ring episode has non-synthesized amusement park music), other quality control issues still exist. See my comments in upper caps below:

Harry Gene Neyhart ""hgn2001"" wrote on May 12, 2015 (& amended July 8, 2015):

However, many of the MOST WANTED sets that people are receiving in the mail are themselves still problematic. Sets made for the original 2012 release have five discs with problems:

- S1V2D2: Bloodlines - video/audio sync issues. Picture ahead of sound or vice-versa
TCS: VIDEO AND AUDIO IN PERFECT SYNC
TMWE: AGREE THAT VIDEO AND AUDIO SLIGHTLY OUT OF SYNC

- S1V2D3: Taps For A Dead War - video/audio sync issues. Not quite as bad as Bloodlines, but still off.
TCS: VIDEO AND AUDIO IN PERFECT SYNC
TMWE: AGREE THAT VIDEO AND AUDIO EVER SO SLIGHLTY OUT OF SYNC (LESS NOTICEABLE THAN BLOODLINE EPISODE)

- S2V1D4: The Iron Maiden - reports are that there is some Heyes leftover underscoring.
I CAN'T COMMENT ON THIS AS HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS EPISODE AT ALL

- S3V1D2: Three Cheers For Little Boy Blue: Wont play through to end credits; it freezes. You also cannot fast-forward or backward without pixelization/freeze-ups.
TCS: NO PROBLEMS PLAYING AND FAST FORWARDING OR REWINDING SCENES
TMWE: TIME COUNTER JUMPS AROUND EVEN THOUGH VIDEO PLAYS CORRECTLY ALMOST TO THE END. SKIPS THE EPILOGUE AND CLOSING CREDITS. PRESSING FAST FORWARD OR REWIND SCENE BUTTONS SEEMS TO TAKE VIEWER ANYWHERE BUT WHERE YOU WANT TO GO. SKIP CHAPTER FORWARD AND BACK SEEMS OK.

- S3V1D3: Landscape With Running Figures(1+2): - You cannot fast-forward or backward through either of the two episodes.
TCS: NO PROBLEMS PLAYING THESE TWO EPISODES FROM WHAT I CAN TELL ALTHOUGH HAVE NOT WATCHED THEM BOTH FROM BEGINNING TO END. THE BOX SLEEVE STATES THE DISC INCLUDES AN EPISODIC PROMO BUT I CAN'T FIND IT.
TMWE: PLAYS AN EPISODIC PROMO FOR PART 2 OF THE EPISODE BUT DOESN'T PLAY THE TWO EPISODES. MY DVD PLAYER SKIPS THROUGH ALL OF THE CHAPTERS FOR BOTH EPISODES AND GOES STRAIGHT TO EPISODE 3 ON THE DISC. SAME PROBLEM WHEN USING THE PLAY ALL FUNCTION.

I (and I assume some others) are left with two imperfect DVD sets, although the non-purist Fugitive fan may not really have an issue with occasional replacement music on TCS. I'll probably keep watching TCS set in the coming months because from what I've seen so far, there don't appear to be any playback problems. I'll worry later about merging the two sets to create one better quality set. I do like the proportions of TCS box as it fits snuggly on the DVD shelf, whereas TMWE is quite long and narrow. Along the way, I might move the odd TMWE disc (such as Brass Ring episode disc and anywhere else I notice synthesized music) over to TCS set.

Other things to consider if merging the sets is that TCS contains all grey discs while TMWE set contains black season discs. TMWE set does have more special features, which appear on a grey disc while the TV soundtrack CD is black. I could probably make room for these two discs at the back of the TCS box and keep them in paper sleeves to avoid scratching. I don't like the way either of the sets have listed the episodes in tiny red text on mostly black background as very difficult to read.",1436572800,5,4392,4.646907216494846

7009372,4,B00TGNLUSI,"Amended Update #2
Increased my Rating back to 4 Stars since I finally got the COMPLETE ""Most Wanted"" set.  The new set came 4 days after calling the toll free number again and pleading my case.  It appears all the problems episodes I have play thus far have been corrected.  As I plow through the rest of my set, I find any issues still needing attention I will amend here once again.

 Note to first time buyers: DO NOT buy this ""Complete Series"" set if you want original music.  I get the impression this version will *never* be issued correctly as Paramount's solution is to eventually send the ""Most Wanted"" set to satisfy complaining customers.  Yes, you can get a $100 set eventually for the $46 invested here but it's not guaranteed, and (IMO) not worth the trouble.

-----------------------------
Amended Update #1

Dropped my rating to 2 stars because of the following:

I received a little bundle of 5 DVD replacements from the ""Most Wanted"" edition today.  I did NOT receive a complete replacement and these 5 DVD's do NOT address the defective music still present in many of the episodes, especially in Season 2 Volume 2.  Also worth noting these replacement discs do not match my ""Complete Series"" set, which I could have lived with were it not for the many episode music problems still not addressed.

For those who got a complete set replacement, congrats to you!! For those still waiting, you might as well start your RMA with Amazon before the time limit runs out as it appears Paramount is no longer sending out a complete corrected set.

This is totally frustrating but not the first time Paramount has shamelessly hacked music in their work just to avoid licensing issues or expense.  The first one of legend was from the original Start Trek ""City on the Edge of Forever"" where the old time radio music was hacked on the VHS release but later corrected on Laser Disc and later issued formats.

Original Review..............

OK here we go...

I purchased my set on June 20 2015, The Fugitive The Complete Series box set (NOT the Most Wanted Edition).

So far I have watched most of Season one and this show is utterly amazing.  I grew up watching 60's era TV but somehow missed The Fugitive all these years.  Newly discovered for me, each episode delivers a surprise.  Its either the music score or guest stars appearing few years younger, that went on to be heard or made famous in later TV shows or movies.

Whats more important is the quality of the stories.  The Fugitive is right up there with shows like The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits in delivering provocative and realistic drama, often touching on social issues well ahead of the shows1960's time frame.

On to the quality control issues.  Given the size of this set, I decided to spot check a few episodes in seasons 2 and 3 where other reviewers have mentioned problems with inserted substitute music over the original soundtrack score.

So far, I have found the basic theme music to be intact.

The problem is with a few episode-specific songs or background music that sounds like it was plunked out on a modern synthesizer instead of being a part of an originally recorded 60's TV score.  Both the composition and tonal quality of inserted music jumps right out at you, and can ruin the originally intended mood of the show.

Among all the reviews posted here, I could not find a specific examples to help me look for music problems still not corrected, so here is one I found:

Season 2, Episode 16 Brass Ring.  The problem is with the amusement park music in act 1.  In my DVD box set this episode is actually the first in Season 2, Volume 2"".  Just to be sure, I pulled up the same episode which is currently offered on YouTube, and confirmed my DVD has altered music.

Knowing I still had defective content in my set, I called the given toll free number (877-335-8936) and a very helpful operator took my information and asked for my products bar code.  Confirming my set was defective, she promised a replacement set would be sent but it would take over a month as Paramount was processing the requests in batches at the end of each month.  Its worth noting this is a 3rd party customer service and they don't have the ability to track your order or make specific promises on delivery.  Knowing that I will receive my replacement after Amazons warranty window closes is my biggest concern.

All told Im only going to knock off one star for this, given the outstanding quality of this show, and the reasonable price charged for such a large box set.",1436400000,6,4543,4.617206982543641
7009373,5,B00TGNLUSI,"If you're already reading this then you don't need to be sold on this overall superb series which, rather remarkably, remains surprisingly fresh and undated, escaping the unfortunate fate of so many other dramatic series of the period.

I purchased ""The Complete Series"" early in June, and upon learning of the scoring issues plaguing some discs, I telephoned the Customer Service number mentioned in other reviews and provided them with the SKU from the outer box.  The representative mentioned some confusion on their end regarding the wide variety of SKU numbers they've been getting, but promised to e-mail as soon as (or if) the set I received warranted replacement discs.

I was surprised to receive a very large box today (from Paramount Home Video) which contained not the expected few isolated replacement discs, but the entire factory-sealed ""Most Wanted"" set, which is listed elsewhere on Amazon.

Overkill and an unnecessary expense on their part, but you won't hear any complaints from this department!

7009386,5,B00TGNLUSI,"First of all, I have been very impressed with the picture and sound quality of ""The Fugitive: The Complete Series"" box set. The picture is crisp and clear and the sound strong and even.

I've been watching sample episodes with a Panasonic blu-ray DVD player with video enhancement (for regular DVDs) along with a Panasonic high definition television. This makes these episodes look pretty darn close to blu-ray quality. And I'm sure other DVD players and televisions can produce the same results.

The black and white episodes of ""The Fugitive"" are fantastic, but Season Four has quickly become my favorite season due to all the eye-popping color. Color was changing the course of television history by the mid-1960's, and many shows originally filmed in black and white were switching over to color. ""The Fugitive"" was no exception.

Color consultants were often used for many of these shows so that colors would stand out and become as much of a drawing card for the shows as the stars and stories presented in each series. And the fourth season of ""The Fugitive"" has some of the most gorgeous color that can be seen in any series from that era.

For those of you who have purchased this great box set, you may be aware of the discussion going on about ""replacement music"" in some of the episodes. It has become apparent that through an oversight of CBS/Paramount a few of these discs with replacement music made their way into some box sets.

The process to determine if you may need new discs to replace the ""replacement music"" discs is simple. Call Vision Media, a ""fulfillment company"" handling this project for CBS/Paramount, at 877-335-8936. Their hours are Monday-Friday, 8:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. Pacific Standard Time. You may be put on hold for a while, but hang on, you will be able to talk to a live representative.

The representative will ask you to read the bar code off the bottom of the slipcase of the box set. If that information shows that there are discs that need to be replaced, you will be asked for your mailing address and a contact phone number. They said it would take about two to four weeks to receive the replacement discs.

I asked how many new discs would I receive, and I was told that there were only five discs that needed to be replaced. So don't expect them to send you replacements for entire seasons.

I just made the phone call recently and have not yet received the discs. However, when I do, I'll revise this review and let you ""Fugitive"" fans know how the new discs are working.

For what it's worth, if you are worried about buying this box set because of all the discussion about ""replacement music"" in some of the episodes, I would not let that stop me from buying it. The same goes for fans who have already purchased the box set and are trying to decide whether to send it back.

CBS/Paramount is making a sincere effort to correct an honest mistake. So let's cut them some slack and go through the process of determining if new discs are needed for your box set. Then it's just a matter of sitting back and enjoying one of the greatest television series of all time which has been compiled in one great box set entitled ""The Fugitive: The Complete Series.""",1434153600,20,3205,4.607017543859649

2. The *replacement discs* for Season 2 Volume 1.  When Season 2 Volume 1 (comprising the first 15 eps of Season 2) was originally released, *all* of the background music had been replaced by the newly-composed Mark Heyes music.  Thankfully, this set provides the replacement discs which were issued for that Volume, so *most* (but not all) of the original music has been restored.  Unfortunately, there is still some Heyes music which pops up from time-to-time.

3. The original Season 2 Volume 2 release.  This follows the trend of the Season 2 Volume 1 replacement discs in that most of the original music (but not all) is intact.  The same holds for all of Season 3.

4. Season 4 (in color) is as pristine as Season 1 regarding A/V quality.  All of the original background music is intact.

7009397,5,B00TGNLUSI,"******EVEN FURTHER AMENDED REVIEW****** as of 7/28/15
There have been reports of people getting this box set who are now claiming it to be 100% night-of-broadcast, the way it was supposed to be. That would indicate that CBS/Paramount has indeed corrected the earlier errors and the sets that are now selling should be OK. But just in case you get one of the first-issued boxes, keep that phone number handy so that they can get you the corrected discs in one form or another. Early purchasers were treated to the MOST WANTED box set. The product, THE FUGITIVE TV series, is among the finest dramatic series ever produced for television, and purchasers deserve the best possible way to view it.

****FURTHER AMENDED REVIEW**** as of 7/8/15
It has been the experience of many who have phoned the 877-335-8936 number that they are receiving complete MOST WANTED sets instead of fixing the COMPLETE SERIES set that they bought. This is both a generous offer from CBS/Paramount, as well as a bit confusing. First off, the MOST WANTED set is the more expensive package, so for little money, many are receiving the better set. That's fine.

However, many of the MOST WANTED sets that people are receiving in the mail are themselves still problematic. Sets made for the original 2012 release have five discs with problems:

- S1V2D2: Bloodline  video/audio sync issues. Picture ahead of sound or vice-versa

- S1V2D3: Taps For A Dead War:  video/audio sync issues. Not quite as bad as Bloodline, but still off.

- S2V1D4: The Iron Maiden:  reports are that there is some Heyes leftover underscoring.

- S3V1D2: Three Cheers For Little Boy Blue:  Wont play through to end credits; it freezes. You also cannot fast-forward or backward without pixelization/freeze-ups.

- S3V1D3: Landscape With Running Figures(1+2):  You cannot fast-forward or backward through either of the two episodes.

Some customers are reporting that their new MOST WANTED sets already have the corrected discs, so they are good to go. The ones with the problematic discs outlined above should once again contact CBS/P at the phone number above and request the five corrected discs.

Kudos to CBS/P for attempting to set this right, but they have to be marked down a bit for the continued foul-ups.

***AMENDED REVIEW***
As promised, I'm amending my review of THE FUGITIVE, THE COMPLETE SERIES from CBS/Paramount. Three weeks and two days after the initial release date, we've finally heard from the parties we wanted to hear from . TVSHOWSonDVD dot com has reported that CBS/P has issued a statement that they will once again initiate a disc replacement program to all purchasers of this set. Incredibly (and quite stupidly), the set was issued using the wrong masters. Instead of using the corrected masters that were done for the MOST WANTED SET, it is believed that they used the uncorrected masters with music substitutions by Mark Heyes. According to their press release, they never intended for that to happen, yet here we are, once again talking about disc replacements for THE FUGITIVE.

Once you've gone through the disc replacement process, you should be the proud owner of the full series of THE FUGITIVE for a fabulous price, which is why I've upped the star count to five. There is no finer television series on the face of the planet and if it wasn't for CBS' bungling, we probably wouldn't even be discussing this in 2015. It would have been done and completed in its half-season sets in 2010 and followed with a full-series release. That's the way it SHOULD have been handled.

Your other options are to wait out the process and hope to get a corrected set. I don't recommend that as at least with the replacement discs, all you have to do is make a phone call to verify your discs.

As for the product itself, once corrected, you should have the entire four seasons of the best television show ever in pristine video and audio, in a night-of-broadcast fashion. The only things missing from this set that were included in the MOST WANTED set are and extras DVD that featured the extended unaired pilot with commentary, various snippets of David Janssen guesting on talk shows, some promos, etc. Also missing from this set will be the remastered FUGITIVE soundtrack album on CD.

Still, even with the missing extra material, the series itself ranks the full five stars. CBS' handling of it is well into the negative-star territory. Many people give them kudos for finally getting it right. I have in the past, but I cannot in good conscience now. They've bungled it too many times for forgiveness.

***ORIGINAL REVIEW***
They're at it again. The good folks at CBS/Paramount have somehow, once again, managed to mangle THE FUGITIVE. Throughout the releases of the half-season sets for Seasons 2 and 3, CBS/Paramount issued discs with music replacements for the original backscore. Fans' hue and cry got them to ""fix"" Season Two Volume One, but it was only approximately 90% successful. Supposedly there were some problematic music cues that they couldn't locate the owners of, so they commissioned new music from composer Mark Heyes, and some of these remained in Season Two Volume One.

Moving on, Season Two Volume Two was even more problematic, with some episodes nearly totally compromised and others relatively OK. The same with Season Three Volumes One and Two. For the record, Season One and Season Four are mostly perfect with night-of-broadcast music.

After the completion of the Season sets, in 2011 CBS/Paramount issued an aborted series set called MOST WANTED. It was supposedly fixed to all night-of-broadcast music, but was riddled with some problems. It remained off the market for a year while the set was fixed to contain truly night-of-broadcast experience. Then even THAT set had some technical problems forcing a replacement disc program that CBS would send out to those who called the phone number.

If you're playing along at home, at that point, the best you could do was to order the MOST WANTED set, call a phone number for corrected discs and wait until they were mailed. This worked fine and most FUGITIVE fans who went that route were satisfied.

Three years later and CBS/Paramount announces the set in question, THE COMPLETE SERIES. Prices are lower, there's two fewer discs (a bonus DVD and CD are eliminated), and everyone assumes that the night-of-broadcast episodes are making their way to hold-outs who didn't pay the rather high prices for the MOST WANTED set.

Street date arrives (May 5, 2014) and reports begin to surface on the Internet that the Mark Heyes music is back. Through information gleaned through COMPLETE purchasers, these discs appear to offer the program as it was released on the half-season sets, thus compromising the episodes in Seasons Two and Three.

It seems inconceivable to many that CBS would foist this music replacement back onto unsuspecting customers. And yet here we are, a full week later and we've heard nothing from CBS/Paramount regarding this release, in spite of the negative reviews posted. That silence is telling me that this set is exactly the way they wanted it. So, if you want THE FUGITIVE the way it was supposed to be - the way it aired on TV - then grab THE MOST WANTED set while you still can and play their game with disc replacement if needed. There's no telling how long IT will remain available.

I'll amend this review should CBS com forth with an explanation one way or another.",1431388800,47,7449,4.900635930047695
7009398,3,B00TGNLUSI,"I was hoping this was a brand new set without the faults of the half-season DVD sets (music replaced with synthesizer due to copyright concerns) and the Most Wanted boxed set (defective DVDs).

And to save space they've crammed seasons 1-3 in one plastic DVD book with a DOZEN of those plastic holder pages and season 4 in another. Why not just box all 8 half-season DVD sets together in a box - they could have even indicated that 1-3 was b&w and 4 in colour by color coding each season's box and all you'd need is a new case and probably new inserts.
The 'extras' are minimal. I was hoping for a behind the scenes look of some sort. I was also hoping for footage such as Janssen on Johnny Carson, jokingly admitting that Kimble really had killed his TV wife 'because she wouldn't shut up'. Or the 1990s video footage from a Detroit tv station's (the station where I first got introduced to this show) Fugitive marathon with Barry Morse doing introducing and making comments about episodes.
I'm giving it 3 stars not 1 because it's still a GREAT series. I probably won't return my copy. But I REALLY wish CBS would value it's old titles a bit more and invest in keeping the original music on the DVDs (looking at YOU Northern Exposure) or at least hire a modern day orchestra to recreate the original incidental music.",1431129600,13,1415,4.509727626459144
7009399,1,B00TGNLUSI,A huge disappointment !!!! Should have been proper music and all issues corrected or resolved. I am returning this to Amazon. Paramount please do this wonderful show as it should be done.,1431129600,15,187,4.875

7009401,1,B00TGNLUSI,"If you want to experience ""The Fugitive"" as the creators of this classic intended it to be seen then AVOID this piece of crap. Get ""The Most Wanted Edition"" that was released in 2012.

SHAME on CBS/PARAMOUNT for foisting this travesty onto the fans YET AGAIN!",1430870400,35,259,4.630434782608695
7009402,1,B00TGNLUSI,"Thanks to Mr Rubin for clarifying whether this was the release that was claimed on several dvd release sites.

It was SUPPOSEDLY to be a reissued edition of the REVISED ""most wanted edition"" issued in a budgeted slip case version 7"" deep.  The only omission was to be the extra CD issued out in the first REVISED issue (since the original production RUIN (*not a typo) had included several faulty and mislabeled discs.

It's an embarrassment to PARAMOUNT to issue this great series in a format and content that is incomplete WITHOUT advising the consumer.

In fact.  All previous PR had been to the effect that this was to be the RESUSCITATED and COMPLETE version that had been a result of a consumer backlash against the company for its faulty first run.

I'd been watching this item for 2 months, hesitating to purchase the THREE sets I'd intended to order (self, friend,  old fogie) but now I'll have to look for alternate routes or possibly purchase the OOP most wanted edition;  HOPING  it's a FIXED edition that I'm purchasing.

Thanks a lot for the misrepresentation, Paramount.

Also Thanks AMAZON for your failed contribution to ACCURACY when assessing reviews.

Anytime I attempted to post under a comment to mr Rubin ' s review it was denied and forwarded to the initial MOBILE site that PREVENTS such a comment.

A great way to manifest their hold on misrepresentation.  It's sad to rely on such misrepresentation when searching for products.

I find it a real surprise this edition wasn't lumped into a tally with all the other 1,000 reviews of prior editions.

I won't be buying until this situation is remedied OR the price is significantly dropped to clearance status for a complete consumer misrepresentation.

PARAMOUNT, while you're at it go fix your edition of Zefferelli's ROMEO AND JULIET too on blu-ray, it looks just like the dvd",1430784000,43,1853,4.8317460317460315
7009403,1,B00TGNLUSI,"**UPDATE: ON MAY 28, 2015 THE WEB SITE TVSHOWSONDVD dot COM . ANNOUNCED A REPLACEMENT DISC PROGRAM TO RECTIFY THE PRESENCE OF MARK HEYES MUSIC ON SOME OF THE DISCS IN THIS SET. ANYONE WHO HAS PURCHASED THIS CAN CALL 877-335-8936 AND ASK TO BE SENT CORRECTED DISCS, CONTAINING THE ORIGINAL MUSIC. DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF THIS INITIATIVE, I MAY WELL AMEND MY POOR RATING.**
Buyer beware! I received my set from Amazon on May 5, 2015, and am sending it back. This set contains the replacement Mark Heyes music from the original DVD sets prior to the release of ""The Most Wanted Edition"" box set. That is, much of the original series music has been removed, particularly in seasons 2 and 3, and replaced with a synthesized score. I cannot believe that after what the fans went through with previous DVD sets, and the painstaking work CBS put into ""The Most Wanted Edition"" to right their wrongs over this music issue, that they would release this garbage now. A terrible disappointment. If you don't mind the replaced music, I guess it's good value for the money. Otherwise, steer clear, and opt for ""The Most Wanted Edition"" box set. It's considerably more expensive, but that is the version that has all of the original music restored.",1430784000,135,1237,4.7050691244239635
