The idea being that they hope he will be able to end the stalemate in their  logical war.  The concept is great, but the execution leaves a little to be  desired.  Writer Terry Nation and Story Editor Douglas Adams do not make a  great combination.  The story has some good moments and the introduction of  Lalla Ward as the newly regenerated Romana is handled well.  Overall, this  is certainly a better story than some of the Patrick Troughtan and Jon  Pertwee Dalek episodes.

So they run to Davros, their father-figure who should have been left to die a slow death and never allowed to return to the Doctor Who Universe, to help defeat a race of perfect robots.  Not robots who never make a mistake.  Just very beautiful.  Not very smart and seem to be under-armed for fighting Daleks, but they do look good.  And their ship and weapons are interesting, which helps the story a tad.
But Romana, a Time Lady, seems to be a screamer who reacts to the Daleks like much of us react to giant man eating rats.  True, she is a Time Lord...er Lady so must know tons of their history, background, tactics, and how dangerous they are.  Maybe that explains why she acts like a 1950s actress from a horror film?
So, to me, it is a mixture of good and bad.  Daleks, cool robots and ships vs. Davros, a Romana who could have done so much better, and Daleks are NOT robots!

882459,3,6304432402,"""Destiny of the Daleks"" is almost universally slagged by critics for it's ticky-tacky sets, its typical exterior location shooting in a quarry, and its weak story, but a lot of these supposed faults are exaggerated.

The only sets that look a little tatty are the interior scenes of the Daleks' tunnels on Skaro, in some places no more than tattered sheets of black plastic serving as the remains of walls. These underground chambers should look like a wreck, though, because the Daleks' are systematically mining them with explosives in search of their creator, Davros, whom they presumably killed in ""Genesis of the Daleks."" (No spoiler here: Davros appears on the box.) The interior of the Movellans' spaceship, on the other hand, features a bright, clean design--nothing remarkable but perfectly serviceable.

The exterior scenes on Skaro were shot at Winspit Quarry in Dorset--a quarry, yes, but one that featured interesting cavelike structures carved out of the rock as well as crumbling brick buildings that fit in well with the story's premise that this is the ruins of the Daleks' homeworld. Remember, too, that ""Destiny"" was a sequel of sorts to ""Genesis,"" which remains one of the most beloved Doctor Who stories of all time. Since ""Genesis"" also takes place on wartorn Skaro and was shot in a quarry, ""Destiny"" HAD to be shot in a quarry as well if only for continuity purposes.

In the story, the Doctor and Romana, newly regenerated to look like Princess Astra (Lalla Ward) from ""The Armageddon Factor,"" land on a strange planet that the Doctor finds familiar. It's Skaros, of course, where the Daleks have returned and are frantically mining the planet in search of something deep beneath its surface. Another mysterious race, the Movellans, have also landed on Skaro to find out what the Daleks are up to.

Without giving away too many plot twists, let's just say the Daleks and Movellans are deadlocked in an interstellar space war in which each side is seeking a technological advantage that will allow it to defeat the other. It wasn't Terry Nation's most brilliant script, perhaps, but it does have a theme at its center. And does one really expect brilliance from a Terry Nation script this late in the writer's career or will nostalgia do?

In any case, this DVD comes with some worthwhile Special Features, including ""Terror Nation,"" a brief but comprehensive documentary tracing the history of the writer's highly successful creation, and his other stories for Doctor Who as well.",1313452800,,2505,4.997601918465228
882460,4,6304432402,"Always an annoying trait of the Daleks was their loud distorted voices.

Anyway, I noted that just like in 'The Power Of Kroll"" where the Swampies were wearing RIck James wigs, so do the Movellans in this series. I now know where Rick James, the ""Super Freak"" singer got the inspiration for his ""head gear.""

882463,4,6304432402,"Genesis of the Daleks might be the best Doctor Who story of all time, definitely Baker's best, the sequel Destiny... certainly is not. Destiny of the Daleks is not deep, and it is not as imposingly designed or capable of making the Daleks and Davros menacing, however this story is very fun. Tom Baker is always wonderful as the fourth Doctor and he is joined by Lala Ward as Romana for the first time in this story. The two have wonderful chemistry, the were married off camera, and they really shine in this episode. There are some just great moments in light-hearted Doctor Who here.

882594,4,6304432402,"When Davros was introduced in Doctor Who during ""Genesis of the Daleks,"" I assumed that this would be the only time we ever saw him.  But a few short years later, Davros returned after thousands of years in limbo in ""Destiny of the Daleks.""  I like this one because the Daleks are fighting another robot race called the Movellans, although we don't learn that right away.

The concept of two totally logical species trying to outdo each other is still a classic.  One of the things I like about this is seeing the justapositions between the Doctor and Davros and how they approach the final solution.  Quite frankly I was always disappointed that the Movellans never returned to the series.

This is an important story in that it was the one in which (for better or for worse), Davros became a permanent fixture in the classic series.  It was Romana #2's first story and the start of one of the best Doctor-Companion teams in the series' history.

My favorite part about this DVD are the extras with the Prime Computer ads that Tom Baker and Lalla Ward recorded during the late '70's.  I knew they did them but had never seen them and it was a great treat for me.  The Terry Nation tribute was a fascinating trek through Dalek history during the '60's and '70's.

This is released as part of a Davros box set, but I already owned all the Davros stories so I didn't need the box set.  But in my opinion, the BBC saved the best for last.",1205712000,2,1435,4.435114503816794

882596,5,6304432402,"I got my first Doctor who novelizations on Super Bowl Sunday in 1985 -- just weeks after I'd found the show on PBS -- and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-and-the-Destiny-of-the-Daleks/dp/0426200969/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who and the Destiny of the Daleks</a>&nbsp;was one of the three.  I was eleven.  I didn't watch the game, but I read about the Daleks as they returned home to resurrect their creator and win a war.  I've loved the story ever since.

Sure, ""Destiny of the Daleks"" has got flaws, and those are lovingly displayed on DVD.  The production values are vintage 1979... which, in terms of TV sci-fi, was more of a table year (to quote the Doctor from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-City-of-Death-Episode-105/dp/B000B7QCJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - City of Death (Episode 105)</a>, the following story).  Michael Wisher, the original Davros from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Genesis-of-the-Daleks-Episode-78/dp/B000EMG918/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - Genesis of the Daleks (Episode 78)</a>, was unavailable to reprise the role, and his replacement for this story, David Gooderson, fit neither the role nor the costume.  Gooderson's performance lacked any sort of nuance or terror, and his head was too big for the original mask so they just cut the mask into pieces and glued it back onto his head.  Later on, the director didn't have enough Dalek props for an outdoor sequence set in a sandpit (Daleks don't like uneven terrain), so he had a bunch of extras carry hollow props around and shot them from low angles so you couldn't see their feet underneath.  Yes sir, if Ken Grieve had a nickname it would be ""Captain Shoestring"".

The DVD release of ""Destiny"" works in part because it celebrates the technical flaws in the story, and allows gentle criticism on both of its extra documentaries.  That said, the addition of CGI effects to replace the dodgy spaceships and death rays is kind of superfluous, but fortunately that's an optional feature.

Meanwhile the script itself, which seems to be about 40% Terry Nation and 60% Douglas Adams, is a winner.  The Doctor rattles off dozens of great lines, as does Romana when describing her two hearts: ""One for casual, one for best!"".  The dialogue between the Doctor and Davros during their two main confrontations is snappy and sparkly.  And what's not to love about the hilarious Tom Baker/Lalla Ward byplay during the lengthy opening TARDIS scene?  No wonder they got married (and, to hear Lalla critique Tom's performance on the DVD commentary, no wonder they got divorced...).

Other highlights from the DVD include the Baker/Ward Prime Computer commercials, evidently shot during the couple's very brief marriage.  ""Clever Prime,"" murmurs Romana.  The commentary track is also terrific: Episode One is just Ward and Grieve, fondly remembering the late Douglas Adams, and comparing their 5,000 pound budget to the more visually glossy ""Who"" of the 21st century.  David Gooderson shows up for the final two episodes and displays more charm and wit than he was ever allowed to show as Davros.  Ward also says some complimentary things about her ex-husband, for the first time ever in her several DVD commentaries thus far.

""Destiny of the Daleks"" is never going to be highly regarded in fan circles; even the official BBC ""Doctor Who"" website describes it as ""tacky and inconsequential"".  But whether they're meant to be frightening, or just played for unintentional laughs (some of us here had to live through ""Evolution of the Daleks"" last season), the Daleks always work.  The heavy use of ethnic actors is a plus, and prefigures the more diverse casting policies of modern ""Doctor Who"".  Even if most of the great stories have already been mined, the classic series DVD releases are still showing strong as they descend dangerously closer to the bottom tier of stories.",1205280000,15,4041,5.553017944535074
882597,4,6304432402,"The Doctor, as performed by the ever popular Tom Baker. The regeneration of the Doctor's companion and fellow Time Lord, Romana--meaning a brand new co-star in the person of Lalla Ward. Up against the Doctor's archetypal and almost iconic villains, the Daleks. In a story authored by the very man who wrote them into existence, Terry Nation, and script-edited by a legend of British sci-fi, Douglas Adams. All the elements are in place for a classic of classics, a true ""Doctor Who"" epic. What could possibly go wrong?

Um, well, just about everything, really. ""Destiny of the Daleks"" is one of those thankfully few times when this wonderful show flirts with greatness only to fumble and drop the ball. First and foremost, the basic concept of the Daleks is entirely muddled in this story, as if Nation had forgotten the same premise that he himself created in 1963 and fleshed out so spectacularly in 1975 with this story's forerunner, ""Genesis of the Daleks."" They are organic mutants with strong emotions indeed--""Inside each of those shells is a living, bubbling lump of hate"" as he had the Third Doctor say once. But now suddenly they are supposedly robots locked in a logical impasse with a competing race of robots, the disco-Egyptianesque Movellans? Uh, well, okay. And so they need to dig up the evil genius who genetically engineered them, or invented them rather, or whatever, because only he will do; lucky for them, Davros somehow managed to survive getting blasted by his own creations without decomposing and rusting down in a buried city lacking food, water, air and so on for century upon century. Hmm, okay. As for the Movellans, are androids with easily removable battery packs front and center on their belt buckles really a credible threat?

Obviously, it's insidiously easy to go on picking away at this poor storyline. Too easy. One could go on and on, and many have. And yet somehow ""Destiny"" is still lots of fun to watch. What does it have going for it? First and foremost, Tom Baker is such a pied piper of an actor that he can rattle off muddled scripts and react to implausible threats with such thorough conviction that it kind of carries you along, and here in this story his trademark oddball clowning instantly reacts favorably with Douglas Adams' own idiosyncratically cerebral sense of humor to great effect. These funny moments save the day in this case, allowing one to laugh with rather than at the show. Lalla Ward also makes a very promising debut right away, and her version of Romana feels much more at home in the company of the Doctor and the Tardis crew than her previous incarnation. This story is historically important for the show, establishing Davros as a recurring character rather than a one-shot villain--how good a move this is might be debatable, and I'm somewhat of the opinion that trotting him out every time the Daleks show up cheapens the dramatic punch of what retroactively became his first appearance; but that's my two-cents worth, he has many good solid fans who eagerly await his reappearances and ""Destiny"" got that ball rolling. Then too, there are some interesting ideas somewhere beneath all the rubble of muddle, strange allegories about searching for one's lost creator and pertinent fables about cold war superpowers acrimoniously stuck in a rut. Finally, the plot has some clever twists and turns here and there along with an assortment of thoroughly respectable thrills and chills.

In short, ""Destiny of the Daleks"" does admittedly fall way short of its exalted potential, and by no means is it a sample of ""Doctor Who"" at its best, and yet for all that it's still reasonably enjoyable and entertaining--and somewhat endearing in its faults if one gives it half a chance.

882598,4,6304432402,"I begin this review with an admission.  While watching Doctor Who back in the 80s on my local PBS station here in Chicago, I was not particularly fond of Destiny of The Daleks. The story is not too compelling, slow moving at times, dormant at others.  The Daleks search to find their creator on the planet Skaro because they have fallen into a logic trap in their battle against another race of robots, the Movellans.  The fact that they should even be in a logic trap is illogical in itself, considering that  they were once humanoid creatures and have always acted irrationally, with hatred, xenophobia, rants, etc, hardly logical emotions.  Plus, I swear I saw Rick James as a Movellan...""she's a very sexy...android...!""

However, I have grown to appreciate this story more and more.  What changed it for me?  For one thing, the interplay between The Doctor (Baker) and Romana II (Sarah Ward, I never liked the name Lalla. Her given name of Sarah is much prettier) is simply marvelous, rivaling that of the Doctor and past companion Sarah Jane Smith.  You can really sense a chemistry developing here from her very first story.  Whereas Mary Tamm (Romana mark I) was a glamorous model type, Ward is simply cute and cuddly.  No wonder Tom Baker married her.  The chemistry even extends to their Doctor Who his and her costumes, with Ward sporting a flashy pink female version of the Doctor's outfit, right down to a matching pink scarf.  Such is the chemistry between the two that it was a very sad moment indeed when Romana walked away from the Doctor, and out of Doctor Who forever, at the end of Warriors' Gate.

Tom Baker's humor shines in this story as well, remarking to Davros that his long rest has done nothing to cure his megalomania.  The Doctor and Davros play well off of each other as well.  A memorable scene in episode four has Davros waiting for the Dalek ship to come pick him up.  Enter the Doctor, with a big toothy grin!  From Davros' reaction, the Doctor is the last person Davros needs to see at this moment.  I can't say enough about Tom Baker's performance in Destiny.  His mastery of the English language is astounding, not in only what he says, but how he says it.  Only Baker can go from  a  joking attitude to dead seriousness without missing a breath.  Kudos must also be given to Tim Barlow for his portrayal of commander Tyssan.  Many will be shocked to learn that Barlow was a legally deaf actor.  His performance belies this little tidbit of information.

Among the DVD extras, one that stands out is a series of four television commercials recorded by Baker & Ward, in character as the Doctor and Romana, for Prime Computers, running about a half minute each.  One particular interesting one has the computer telling the Doctor to ""marry the girl"", which he gladly took its advice and did.  Also, considering that today's computers can be as small as a watch battery, it certainly is culture shock to see how huge a computer was in the late 70s.  As outdated as Prime Computers now are, the classic series of Doctor Who will never become outdated, no matter how long the new one runs.",1204588800,14,3122,4.623636363636364
882599,2,6304432402,"The basic story should've been used for the Cybermen, a REAL race of aliens that go purely by logic. Now THAT would be a teriffic storyline, and better than any of the 70's and 80's Cybermen stories bar Earthshock.

On the Daleks... uh, right. I bought this DVD from Aus this week and was looking forward to seeing it, as ABC for some reason weren't allowed to show various Dalek stories in their recent classic series repeat run. Terry Nation, who created the Daleks in the first place, seemed to forget that the Daleks were xenophobic (emotion! illogical!) and had a hatred for the unlike! This isn't nitpicking, it's a basic thing, and everyone I watched it with questioned this.

A major thing which brings it back to two stars. Because otherwise, it is an enjoyable run-around. Some people complain about the Fourth Doctor becoming too silly and not taking the threat seriously, but for some reason I like that. Probably because I find it fun to watch all these egotistical villains getting so easily shot down (both verbally and physically) by the Doctor, it adds to make a good story.",1202428800,7,1091,4.706806282722513
882600,2,6304432402,"Destiny of the Daleks was the beginning of the end for the Tom Baker era.  Terry Nation always wanted to write his own Dalek stories because no one else could write to his satisfaction.  This, the last of the Terry Nation Dalek episodes, could have been good, but it ultimately failed.

The plot is basically this: the Daleks have become embroiled in an intergalactic war with the Movellans, and race of androids who operate completely logically.  The Daleks' and the Movellans' logic operate to bring the war to a stalemate, leading the Daleks to the conclusion that they need their creator Davros to introduce some surprise into battle strategy so the Daleks can win the war.  The Daleks return to Skaro to unearth Davros who was exterminated at the end of Genesis of the Daleks some several centuries earlier.  The Movellans follow the Daleks to Skaro to determine their purpose to prevent them gaining an advantage.  Meanwhile, Romana has regenerated into a look alike of the Princess Astra (The Armageddon Factor).  The Doctor and a newly regenerated Romana arrive on Skaro at a time after the Daleks have begun searching for Davros.

There are several problems with this episode as it was produced and written.  The regeneration sequence for Romana was untenable and silly thanks to new script editor Douglas Adams of Hitchikers's Guide to the Galaxy fame.  No explanation for Romana's regeneration was offered and her ability to regenerate several times to obtain the body she wanted was incredible to say the least.  I'm not saying that a Time Lord can't choose what he or she looks like.  That this is possible is apparent from The War Games.  But note that the in The War Games, the Time Lords gave the 2nd Doctor choices regarding his appearance BEFORE he regenerated.  Undoubtedly, the regeneration can be controlled as a biological process, and Time Lords undoubtedly can regenerate as basic facsimiles of other humanoids using some DNA replication process.  But regeneration is surely a process that wouldn't occur as it is depicted in this episode.

To the basic plot elements of the episode.  (1)The Daleks are not logical beings.  The Daleks are completely illogical in fact.  They hate and fear every being not Dalek.  They are predictable only to the extent that if you are not a Dalek, you can predict they will attempt to exterminate you.  But they would not become outgamed by a logical process.  Some have argued that while the Daleks themselves are not logical, their battle computers as computer would be.  Not necessarily and probably not as they would have been designed by Daleks.  The Daleks once attempted to gain an advantage over humans by attempting to introduce ""the human factor"" into Daleks (Evil of the Daleks).  Humans were too unpredictable for the Daleks to effectively fight as that story went.  The Movellans on the other hand, being completely logical, should have been completely predictable and easy to defeat.

(2) Michael Wisher was unavailable to play Davros.  Davros should have been written out of the script immediately.  Davros as a character was effective only because of the way Michael Wisher was able to portray him on camera.  David Gooderson wore the same costume and sat in the same chair Michael Wisher had used in Genesis of the Daleks.  None of it fit him properly.  The voice distortion used for Daleks had been used for Davros in Genesis of the Daleks, but no voice distortion was used in this episode.  And David Gooderson simply could not bring off the character, especially with the costuming and voicing flaws.  Davros was a good character in Genesis of the Daleks, but he needed to stay dead.  He was so used and abused after Genesis of the Daleks and no one could pull it off except Michael Wisher.

All in all, this episode is entertaining. For the die hard fan, it is a must have for the Doctor Who library.  For the passing observer, it might or might not be an episode you want to spend money on.  If you're new to the Daleks, I recommend these stories as well worth the money: (1) The Daleks (1963-64 1st Doctor) - this episode introduced the Daleks to the world; (2) The Dalek Invasion of Earth (1964 1st Doctor); (3) Planet of the Daleks (1973 3rd Doctor) and (4) Genesis of the Daleks (1974 4th Doctor).  Sadly, Power of the Daleks and Evil of the Daleks are not available in their entirety due to short-sightedness at the BBC in the 1970s, but these other stories are great to watch.

If you only watch 1 Dalek episode, choose Genesis of the Daleks.  While the story is short on Daleks on long on Davros, it isn't too long, it introduces you to what the Daleks are and where they came from and it properly characterizes Davros as the maniacal evil genius he was supposed to be.",1199750400,6,4756,4.75
882601,5,6304432402,"The Key to Time season has just wrapped, and the Doctor decides to evade possible payback by the Black Guardian of Time by fitting his TARDIS with a randomiser.  Lo and behold, where does this device dump him first?  On Skaro, of course.

Trailed by a newly-regenerated Romana in a suspiciously familiar outfit, the Doctor wastes no time in getting into trouble, and soon finds himself at the crux of a deadlocked war betwen his old foes the Daleks, and a new race, the Movellans.  And he isn't the only one being counted on to break the stalemate.

Some complaints:  It's a real shame that Michael Wisher could not return to reprise his role, he was still the best Davros in my mind.  That, and last minute re-writes get you some campy dialogue by then-script-editor Douglas Adams, but Doctor Who is always a blast when the Daleks are involved.  As with any Tom Baker serial during the later part of his tenure, it's best not to over-think it; just sit back, relax and enjoy it.

Overall:  an enjoyable second romp with the Daleks and the Doctor's most popular classic incarnation.  This one should be on your list, whether you are a casual fan or a collector.  Enjoy!",1197676800,16,1169,4.594202898550725
882667,5,6304432402,"I can't figure out why this isn't a more popular episode.  It moves much more quickly than a lot of other Doctor Who adventures, it features Romana, who unlike a lot of Doctor companions had a brain and an active role in the Doctor's adventures and, in fact, this is the first series in which Lala Ward (the princess from the Androids of Tara episode in the Key to Time series) plays Romana.
The Doctor and Romana find themselves on Skaros, the Daleks' home planet.  Discovering significant seismic activity, they discover that the Daleks have enslaved a group of humans whom they are forcing to engage in mining activity for a purpose which the Doctor and Romana must ferret out.  At the same time, another race, the wonderful Molvians (who always remind me of Rick James in full-on Superfreak mode), befriend the Doctor and Romana but turn out to have their own agenda.
The Daleks are great in this episode.  Not a lot of chatter, just a lot of typical Dalek bluster -- ""seek, locate, exterminate,"" etc.  Not to mention the glorious return of the megamaniacal Davros, creator of the Daleks.  This is one of the more action-oriented, straight-forward Doctor Who episodes and comes across as a lot less dated than even some of the later episodes.  Not as humorous as many Tom Baker episodes once it gets going (if you're looking for humor and cheese, check out The Pirate Planet), but great action and characters.  Highly recommended.",1070496000,6,1434,4.754032258064516
882668,5,6304432402,"This episode is one of my favorite Dalek adventures. The story features our favorite manic evil doer ""Davros."" Buried in the bottom of the bunker on Scarro, Davros waits in a state of hibernation as the Daleks, who are losing a war to another robot race called the Mavelins, anxiously dig out their infamous creator. You see, the Daleks cannot win their war against the Mavelins because both robotic races are using logic against each other and therefor no one can gain an advantage over the other. The Daleks think that only their original creator can aid them in defeating the Mavelins in this very costly war. The Doctor and Romana (who, by the way marries the doctor in real life) the blonde haired version, land on Scarro but forget what this planet was all about until they discover their first Dalek. It isn't long before the Mavelins, who also have landed on Scarro, meet up with the Doctor and together they try to determine what is going on at the deserted bunker that would bring so many Daleks back. The Doctor and the Mavelins quickly learn that the Daleks are attempting to locate Davros and begin to search for him themselves. Fortunately, the Doctor finds Davros first while poor Romana falls captive to the Daleks. The race is now on for either side to gain an advantage over the other. Davros, for the Daleks and the Doctor for the Mavelins. The Doctor quickly learns the Mavelins are not entirely as innocent and trustable as they want to appear and the Doctor has to quickly find a way out of this latest predictament.
This is another keep episode if you enjoy Tom Baker and the Dalek themes. Actually, it is one of the better episodes.  Please add this exciting story to you collection and you will find yourself watching it again and again. For those of you that refuse to heed my review.... well, you must be EXTERMINATED!

882669,4,6304432402,"The Doctor and a regenerated Romana land on ""not the most inviting planet,"" but the Doctor feels that he's been here before.  Upon examining the ruins of a city, he and Romana see a ship shaped like an inverted pyramid corkscrew its way into the ground, are assaulted by seismic tremors, and subterranean explosions, one of which causes a pillar to fall on the Doctor.
Romana goes for help but an explosion traps the TARDIS.  Before long, she is captured by the Daleks in a moment that mimics the cliffhanger to Episode 1 of the first Daleks story.
The Doctor finds some allies, the Movellans, a race of dark-skinned people with silver dreadlocks, white one-piece suits, and cone-shaped laser guns.  They are calm, orderly, efficient, and extremely strong, as they lifted the pillar from the Doctor (offscreen).  They are on an intelligence mission to find out what the Daleks are up to.  A trip to the old Kaled city reveals the answers.  However, when a Movellan is exterminated by a Dalek, why isn't the Doctor allowed to examine his body, apart from a Movellan code of honor?
Goofs:  The Daleks are actually half-organic, but they are constantly referred to as robots here.  Another is Commander Sharrel in Episode 4.  During the struggle with Romana, it's clear that he isn't played by Peter Straker.  And the Doctor has trouble telling the Daleks to ""back off.""
This is kind of a sequel to Genesis Of The Daleks, as it involves Davros, but it might actually succeed Planet Of The Daleks.  With the radiation count on Skaro strong, there might have been a final nuclear war between the Daleks and Thals where the Thals were the runners up.
The concept of portraying the Movellans with African actors is interesting, as this story shows more Africans with speaking parts than any other.  There are competent performances by the three lead Movellans.
The name of the script editor--Douglas Adams, hence the silliness of dialogue in some areas.  The scene where Romana tries on several bodies before reappearing in a duplicate of the Doctor's costume is definitely his trademark.  And the Doctor has a cheap shot at a Dalek's expense as he escapes up a shaft.  ""If you're supposed to be the superior creatures of the universe, why don't you climb up after us?  Bye bye!""  He ducks as the Dalek fires up at him.
Tony Osoba (the Movellan Lan) later played Kracauer in the Who story Dragonfire.  Peter Straker (Sharrel) and Suzanne Daniel (Agella) effectively play the calm Movellans.  David Gooderson (Davros) is no match for Michael Wisher (voice-wise) but maybe Davros's voice changed after centuries of sleep.  And Lalla Ward is near-perfect in her first go at Romana, good-natured, logical, but more sensible, a compliment to the goofy Doctor.
OK, so the Daleks are made fun of here as repetitive killing machines wrapped in cold logic, but goofs aside, it's enjoyable.  The Movellans are realized so perfectly it's a pity they didn't make another appearance.",1031443200,2,2963,4.874251497005988

That aside, however, I found the story quite enjoyable, and there were some decent special effects, considering this is Dr. Who and was made in 1979.

The script editor of Dr Who at the time was  Douglas Adams, who went on to become famous for 'itchiker's Guide to the  Galaxy' and it shows; the script is quite lighthearted in places, but  rather than detract from the eeriness of the story, this approach only  enhances it.

In 'Genesis' Davros was a  genuine character - in later adventures he was just a baddie.  The Davros  in 'Destiny' is, it has to be said, a pretty laughable figure, actor David  Gooderson wobbling along in a chair quite obviously designed for a  different actor.

Lalla Ward first plays Romana in this adventure, giving the role a certain girlish charm and spiritness, which puts me in mind at times of both Hermione Granger of the Harry Potter movies and Sally Sparrow of the later Doctor Who episode, Blink. She also has a touch of Nancy Drew about her. A recurring villain, Davros appears, along with the Daleks, opposed by an intriguingly androgynous humanoid force with an agenda of their own.
