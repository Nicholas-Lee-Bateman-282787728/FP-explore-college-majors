I saw it three times, in three venues, and every time I laughed and laughed and cried.  Ward does an amazing job balancing the beauty of motherhood with the craziness of it all.  I bought 10 copies of the DVD at the last show and give it to every new mom I know.  I also have mine stashed away from the little hands in my life.  I pop it in (during nap time) when I need a reminder that I am not alone - there are millions of women out there living the life I am.  I recommend this to every mom who thinks her life is nuts and wouldn't change it for the world! A++++++",1235952000,,684,3.85
8617500,5,B001DD869K,"Peggy is a honest and real when it comes to sharing her experiences as a mother...and every moment of insanity is easily digested by her incredible sense of humor. All moms will feel validated, liberated and well, a little more sane after watching her performance. A great shower gift...or birthday gift for every mother out there coping with the daunting task of parenthood. And every father as well...Peggy doesn't let her husband off the hook for a second.",1235433600,,459,4.897435897435898

8617502,5,B001DD869K,"I had the great fortune to catch Peggy Ward performing Mamaphobia live in Michigan. I was wholly unprepared for how hard I was going to laugh. I don't mean giggle--I mean belly laughs! It's not just that Peggy is funny, which she certainly is, but there's nothing gratuitous about the jokes she's cracking. Her life as a wife and mother gives her all she needs for her content. What's so funny is that it's all so true!

As a mom, I felt totally validated when I heard some of the crazy things Peggy has said and done with her kids. She's performing my life up there, and the life of all women who made the life-altering decision to have kids!

I'm giving this DVD as a gift to the new moms I know. They NEED it!",1235433600,,712,4.227941176470588

8617504,5,B001DD869K,"Love this show! Captures the essence of motherhood as only someone in the thick of it can do, the ups, the downs and all the ridiculous things in between.",1235347200,,154,4.344827586206897
8617505,5,B001DD869K,"I saw this One-Woman comedy about motherhood and I am so happy to find it here on Amazon b/c my sister in CA just had her second baby and I have been quoting the show for two years now! Hilarious. Buy it, you will love it. She is funny.",1235347200,,236,3.836734693877551
