At the end I felt a lot more confident in taking my dancing to a dance floor.  Had to borrow a vhs player to use it though, would have been much better on DVD.",1258761600,,319,4.0476190476190474
7927820,5,B00004YZO5,First tape didn't work - sent it back and received a replacement in a jiffy! Thank you!!,1239321600,,88,4.235294117647059
7927821,5,B00004YZO5,"An excellent instructional tape; I would have preferred DVD format but you take what you get.  Well illustrated with plenty of review and varying views in order to provide quick and complete understanding of moves within the various steps.  If you can put up with the corny jokes, I think you will find it valuable.",1168300800,,315,4.709090909090909
7927822,4,B00004YZO5,"Though we learned many steps from this video, we think an initial lesson on the step-slide is required for the raw beginner.  A little less he-hawing around and an additional step would make this video more valuable to the purchaser.  We hope the same couple will do a follow-up DVD.",1165968000,,283,4.64
7927823,5,B00004YZO5,"I've looked at a number of tapes and DVDs lately, including three that this same couple have made. This tape (and others in the set) are far and away the best in terms of showing the steps (men first, then women, then together) and providing important details that others leave out entirely (how to hold your hands to make a turn). The jokes are corny but I think they present a good picture of some very personable dancers. I'm a beginning dancer (although I'm over 50) and this tape has allowed me and a partner to learn enough steps to be able to dance together at a nightclub. We'll be even better with more practice. I haven't seen a tape or DVD which does a better job. I wish they had a version for Rumba.",1121212800,2,712,4.281481481481482
7927824,5,B00004YZO5,We enjoyed this one as much as the Ultimate Two-Step Video.  Great tips and beautiful dancing techniques.  Wouldn't use this that much in Texas; we normally just plow our way through everyone!  But it would have come in handy when we visited Nashville and everyone was doing line dances we hadn't learned yet!  They go through step and arm movements very thoroughly and make it easy to learn!,973296000,8,392,4.720588235294118
