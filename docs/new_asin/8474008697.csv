This is because the VHS I bought on Hawaiian Homecoming went poop-o on me, -so disappointing. (A good production). It was some time before I felt rich enough to buy HH on DVD.  I hope this VHS lasts longer.

There are three DVDs on which the participants wear the same clothes; therefore I presume they were made about the same time. This was one of them. I believe the other two were Sweet Sweet Spirit and I'm So Glad. In any event, I am just so tickled to have all three of these productions. Look at the titles! How could these not be good? I have listened over and over again. When I put Singing in my Soul on, my soul commences singing before the music starts.
