8610339,1,B00EYNEC3U,"HUGE HUGE HUGE disappointment.  First, this is just some copy somebody made on their own DVD machine... not an original at all.  THAT ticks me off a whole lot.  Winkys (seller) is pretty much of a HUGE RIP OFF.  And the videos on the DCVD are NOT at all what was expected.  Basically - just a lot of old videos cobbled together.  Very disappointing and a HUGE RIP OFF at this price.  I cannot recommend and would warn instead...",1404864000,2,428,4.341772151898734
