8606918,5,B00EN09FKO,I love that it is Blu Ray for such a classic set of movies. Price was a little much but I love the pictures and being able to look at the script is remarkable.,1428796800,2,159,3.7058823529411766
8606919,5,B00EN09FKO,"In a time when most Bluray ""special"" editions are anything but, and offer little in the special features, presentation, or physical collectible department, this collection gives life back to the cinephiles who want the best editions of such masterpieces.

Most Awesome Features:
1.) ""Reference Quality"" Video & Audio  The Coppola Restoration Godfather Trilogy Blurays contained within the tomb is a sight to behold; it is one of the best, most impressive, and most enriching presentations I've seen. What's more, the remastering was carefully done so that it would enhance what Coppola was trying to convey/do with each shot, rather than just trying to aimlessly increase detail... This is BY FAR the DEFINITIVE WAY to watch The Godfather.
   Special Features/Extras: They are numerous and they are all full of intriguing information about the brilliant films
2.) Thoughtful Collector's Edition Items  All that needs to be said is this: You get a massive copy of Coppola's script, notes, and directions he used when filming The Godfather.
3.) Superior Collection Case Design  It is a classy (albeit big) product that looks great and should be shown off...you just need to find a bit of space for this mammoth thing.",1403395200,18,1215,5.168367346938775
8606920,4,B00EN09FKO,"I bought this for my partner's birthday. The presentation was impressive, including a pile of memorabilia along with the Blue Ray  discs. It is all packaged into an attractive case resembling an enlarged book. Quality of the movies is very good.
It was well received. As for the movie content. Apparently, that no-one is trustworthy is the attraction. Plenty of scope for surprise from mostly unscrupulous characters. Not sure if it is poor taste or comical? Either way the action demands attention andis mostly enjoyable.",1391385600,9,522,5.141176470588236
