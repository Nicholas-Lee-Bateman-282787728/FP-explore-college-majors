1943732,2,B0000TG992,"The ab portion of the DVD is good, although I fast forward through the warm ups and skip the cool downs altogether. The buns workout is not challenging enough except for the first set. The last one is a step-type exercise so if you don't have something you can step up on, you can't do it. The DVD itself is not very professionally done. Tamilee miscounts, doesn't look at the correct camera when speaking to the audience and often fumbles her words. Abs of steel maybe, buns of steel, no way.",1101254400,25,493,4.428571428571429
1943733,2,B0000TG992,"i really try and like this lady tammylee but she is not ideal for a woman like me to try and look like, her booty is too round and seems like she has a big booty complex....she has some great moves and does some fun work, but Leisa Hart, the instuctor on several other ""STEEL"" videos seems more enjoyable and likable...nothing against Tammilee, but this video set didn't do it for me.",1094688000,7,384,4.347222222222222
1943734,4,B0000TG992,"I'm a dude and was only interested in getting right to the abs, wihtout the fluff and without the care to ""fastforward"" using a VHS. I'm already fit and just needed an extra ""side"" to get me motivated to do the abs more.
Pros: Good 15 minute workout. I recommend recording the DVD audio to tape/CD/Mini-Disk (one that you use in the gym) and listen to it while doing your abs on the floor. Great way to focus on the abs and to focus your attention. 3 workouts which get progressively harder. (I don't watch the buns.)
Cons: The DVD's audio is not properly leveled. You'll notice its volume levels rising and falling in some areas. She get's 4 stars for it!! Not to mention she goofed on the count in one of the excercises. (Where was the editing crew?!)",1089244800,19,753,4.385714285714286
1943735,4,B0000TG992,"Tamilee Webb is very focused throughout this workout.  There are 3 ab exercises and 3 bun exercises.  Different workouts with maximum results.  If you are a fan of her I Want That Body DVD, which is top notch for ab and arm workouts, you will not be disappointed.  She reiterates about the importance of taking care of your body, performing cardio exercises and addressing the other parts of your body that is not addressed in this DVD.  If you are looking for cardio, get Billy Blanks, this is not a cardio workout.  It is a focused workout for specific muscle groups, listed above.  Finally, there are plenty of bogus DVD workouts on the market, this is not one of them.",1077148800,86,672,4.55
1943746,5,B0000TG992,"Sure, the DVD is a bit dated, but good grief it will do as it says and get you abs and buns of steel...if you keep doing it and can keep up. :-) Great DVD and I would recommend it!",1369872000,,180,3.525

1943748,5,B0000TG992,"My abs and buns ARE steel. These are quick, easy workouts. If you're a workout junkie, these will be too easy for you. If you're a beginer, try these. I do these on my off-days and when I'm short on time. Sometimes I'll do 2 or 3 in a row. When she's wearing the thong, make sure your kids aren't in the room.",1351814400,,309,3.9206349206349205
1943749,5,B0000TG992,This is an old school DVD but definitely worth purchasing. It works the abs and you can do the workout for only 15 minutes a day. You definitely will feel it once you do the DVD.,1335484800,,178,3.9722222222222223
1943750,5,B0000TG992,"This is a great classic workout video.  I say classic because it is comically dated with Tamilee's sideways ponytail, high cut hipster workout outfits, classic all-white sneakers and PANTYHOSE while working out!  But don't let that deter you from the awesome workout you will get in only 15 minutes!

Seriously, when I have time for nothing else, I can always make time for this video.  It is broken down into 4 individual 15 minute workouts which you can do individually, or one after each other if you are suicidal.  15 minutes is all you need, that's how intense it is.  I'm all about quick and effective workouts that deliver results, and this definately fits the bill!  You will be sore after the first try, guaranteed.  No matter how dated it becomes, this video will always hold a sacred place in my workout video library!",1333929600,2,829,4.708333333333333

1943752,5,B0000TG992,"Tamilee Webb is the only person that I trust to give me the abs, arms & thighs that I need. She is the best in the business & this DVD proves again that she is at the top of her game.",1243555200,,183,3.4878048780487805
1943753,5,B0000TG992,"Fabulous price for the entire quick toning series on DVD.  I have the VHS which I paid over $50 for in 1996.  I used to do thighs and arms 3 times a week to keep my back and upper body in shape to work as an RN on the critical care unit.  (patients were unconscious and lots of lifting and turning.)  You cannot beat the results you get from her quick toning, 15 minute workouts that anyone can do at home.",1239062400,,406,3.9753086419753085
1943754,3,B0000TG992,"let me tell you...
I picked this up used for 99 cents and it truly got me the results I wanted. I'm a volleyball player, and after doing this tape for 3 months+ every day for 15 min. I felt I was able to do everything in life better!
even play my guitar harder. Sure, it's so 80's, but this isn't a fashion tape. Eat right, use this tape correctly, be motivated, and get the results you want. Demand more of yourselves.",1234051200,,419,4.121951219512195
1943755,5,B0000TG992,This is one of the best ab workouts I've ever tried. You really feel the burn without hurting your back. The movements seem so small but really pack a punch.,1211760000,,157,4.266666666666667
1943766,3,B0000TG992,Each of the six 15 minute workouts contains about 5 minutes of warm up so if you are using this video as part of a bigger exercise program you will probably end up skipping over the beginning each time.  Also each workout is really just theme and variations on one exercise.,1210204800,,274,4.372549019607843
1943767,5,B0000TG992,"Ok, I am not the most coordinated woman in the world, so I get really frustrated with elaborate choreography-type workouts. This one was really easy to follow, perfect length for busy people, and I feel the results every time I use it. (Hubbo says he can, too!) You really have to be conscious of your muscles to maximize the effects, but I'm good with that. I used the VHS Abs of Steel 3 forever, but this is totally my new favorite ab and bun dvd.",1209600000,2,449,4.294117647058823
1943768,5,B0000TG992,Tamilee looks hot!!! in this video. she wears outfits where her buns explode from the rear outta her gear! They are thonged outfits with flesh-colored leggings. You can sometimes tells she gets a kick outta the camera focusing in on her crotch and behind so much! My favorite is the red outfit in the second workout of the second program.  Here Tamilee invites us to look right at her crotch as she flexes her leg up and down...urging you to do it harder! She is so clever. This is one of her hottest videos ever. A must have for Tamilee asset admirers.,1196812800,2,553,4.421568627450981
1943769,4,B0000TG992,"This is a great summary of Tamilee Webb's original Buns of Steel collection.  She gives a great workout and has a killer body to motivate you to keep your tush in action.  I love the cheesy background, it is so sterile, but if you can ignore that and focus on the exercises you will see a difference.  That is if you can see past her crotch which is at the forefront of most of the video.  They have the camera positioned so she doesn't have to kink her neck and the best place they could come up with was looking at her thru her legs.  Overall, a great, quick and well thought out video collection.",1194912000,,599,4.173913043478261
1943770,3,B0000TG992,"Although Tamilee is enthusiastic, the camera occasionally seemed too focused on Tamilee's cleavage and crotch. Also, the overall instruction seemed a bit vague at times. The style is more ""bouncy"" than I would like.",1193529600,2,215,5.352941176470588

1943772,5,B0000TG992,"this dvd rocks! it definitely toned my abs and buns. but it also took a lot of cardio. tamilee webb is very motivating too, and not in an annoying cheerleader type of way. i recomend this dvd for anyone getting ready for bikini season",1181174400,3,234,4.340909090909091
1943773,5,B0000TG992,Tamilee Webb is the one person I workout with.  Her videos are the best and her workouts are the most effective of anything I have ever used.  I love this video.  I use the exercises in it even without the video.  I have learned alot about how to exercise and the technique to use for various areas.  Tamilee really gets down to working what needs to be worked.  She gives you the best.  I'm looking forward to more of her videos coming out on  DVD.  Thanks again Tamilee.  You are the best.,1181174400,2,491,4.239130434782608
1943774,5,B0000TG992,"Tami's work-outs are tough but they sure do create buns & abs of steel. U can never expect wonders out of a work-out dvd without changing ure eating habits but everyone who is serious about working out eating healthy get enough fresh air and are disciplined enought to work-out every 2nd day or at least 3 times a week, will definatley see results in a few weeks.

1943776,5,B0000TG992,"Tami Lee Web's body at her age is inspiring. She is amazingly toned...even her protruding hips. (Her hips protrude, not drag. Who wants to be flat?) The work outs vary from standing to sitting and lying down. They can easily be incorporated into a daily domestic routine. For example, do the standing thigh and hip exercises while washing dishes or watching your kids in backyard, etc. Since each workout is only 15 minutes, it is very doable. Also, no equipment is necessary.",1175299200,,476,4.817073170731708
1943777,2,B0000TG992,"I used to swear by her videos, but this is the worst I've see.  The exercises aren't bad, but repeats the warm-up in each section which is a complete waist of time, the camera production is poor, she actually seems distracted and has a cocky little attitude which is so different from her earlier workout videos.  She doesn't encourage you to workout with her, and only the first ""set"" exercises are really challenging.",1171584000,6,419,4.726027397260274

1943779,5,B0000TG992,"I have been working out with Tamilee Webb and the Buns of Steel series for many years. I have a lot of them on VHS and was fortunate to run across this one on DVD. This DVD is great. It packs a lot of punch in the 15 minute sessions that you can either do a different section each day if short on time, or do like me and do all 3 of one body section per day to max out your potential. They were originally for VHS, so if you've done the cardio elsewhere or have done one of the first warm-ups, you do have to fast forward through the other warm ups at the beginning of each section, but the stretching beforehand and after is great to do in between the different sections. I will alternate between the abs one day and the buns the next. If you follow her instructions for safe exercise, you'll see results without injuring yourself.  But you have to listen and be conscious of what you are doing. I can definitely notice a difference and her fun attitude makes it all the more pleasant, even while she's killing you!!!!",1164672000,4,1019,4.198979591836735
1943780,5,B0000TG992,"I like this DVD for the targeted workout in short sessions.

I do it after a major cardio workout (running, biking or doing Tae-Bo), as 15 minutes is a right amount of time to make sure the troubled areas get extra attention. Even if I have just 30 mins in the morning before work, I would do 100 jumping jacks, some push-ups and one of abs/buns segments. If I am not slacking, I feel the results the next day (especially the 3rd buns workout, and I use a pot instead of a step), all it takes is to really squeeze every muscle I work on.

The DVD has 3 abs and 3 buns sessions, with very short warm-up segments which I never skip. The menu is easy to navigate, and there is no blah-blah/credits/ads, straight to the workout.

Good DVD to diversify workout routine, but I suggest using after a warm-up / cardio.",1161216000,10,810,4.281045751633987
1943781,1,B0000TG992,"I tried the abs workout and because it's twisting you in a weird way, I injured my tail bone. That was in February of 2004. Since then, to this day I have pain (similar to arthritis) in my tailbone that gets aggravated from various activities, so I have to really watch out. I have better days and worse days. Once it does get aggravated, I'm doomed for weeks till it calms down. It's so annoying since I'm only 31 and it hurts right now even when I'm walking (I feel like I'm 71)

1943782,1,B0000TG992,I bought this dvd after seeing a recommendation by a celeb in a fitness magazine.  Bad idea.  I have several fitness dvd's from various outlets and this is the worst ever.  Tamilee even gets confused telling you 4 more - oops 6 more when counting reps.  It is formatted for vcr not dvd.  It is not inspiring or motivating.  Your money is better spent with other products.,1126569600,8,371,4.462686567164179
1943783,4,B0000TG992,"Tamilee Webb's excercise programs are extremely practical for women who blame not working out, on the lack of time.  Her sections are short and intense and you truly feel the work out paying off, as you do it.  It burns!",1123027200,6,220,4.475
1943784,2,B0000TG992,I was expecting more because of the history on these tapes/DVD's. This one was disappointing as you don't feel like you did a workout. I like the older ones better with Tammy.,1121731200,6,175,4.5
1943785,4,B0000TG992,"I really like this exercise video for the reason that all my criteria are met:

1) Abs feel stronger after using 3x/wk

2) Bun workout (simply a side effect of the better Abs video) is a good workout, although I haven't done buns #3 because it requires a step

3)  short; 4 minute warm up, 15 minutes total

4)  footprint used in living room is small

5)  music does not irritate husband (we live in a one-bedroom apt)

6)  moves and exercises are easy to follow (I cannot follow a routine for the life of me)

7)  Instructor is engaging

Downside:  Tamilee's 80s hairstyle and dress.  There are times when I'd prefer not getting a glimpse of her crotch.  Sometimes the camera focused on one spot so it is hard to follow the moves.  I wish she would talk more about making the workout more or less intense, and how to do variations.

Rating:  4 stars because I think this very good, but there is room for improvement

Bottom Line:  A great video to guide you to a firmer belly and butt.",1116201600,36,986,4.3076923076923075
