8569950,3,B00BKBMV0U,"DVD is beautiful to view. However, the music is awful & cheesy. The narrator was obviously not from California, With his ""interesting"" pronunciations of some of the parks. Much better on mute. Fast delivery though, Thanks!.",1413504000,2,223,5.222222222222222
8569951,5,B00BKBMV0U,"I have a number of VirtualActive videos instructed by Johnny Pearman. They are all inspirational to keep me going on my exercise equipment. This one is no exception. Anyone who loves the California Coast, and who doesn't, will enjoy spending time in some areas we usually don't get to experience from the ground. The paths are rugged, no cobblestone paths here! Sometimes we have to climb over huge tree roots and rocks---real, good-sized rocks. The path is a little scary at times. I enjoyed it very much and will watch this one over and over again as I exercise in the future.",1384732800,3,578,4.676470588235294
