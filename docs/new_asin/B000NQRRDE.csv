WORKAROUDN!! PLEASE READ IF YOU WANT TO MAKE MOST OUT OF THIS DISC
one way to work around it is to go to folder properties, view the hidden file and folders, you'll find the hidden folders and the video files in it. COPY THEM OUT, they are quicktime format so use quicktime to play them, once you did that, you can pause, rewind, play it slow with no problem, use this trick to back up all the video files and use them with ease!

now to the content, this DVD is for you to understand the work flow of character modeling, not a DVD for you to learn the programs.  That being said, you can still learn a lot of useful tips and tricks.  Also notice that this DVD use some plug-ins for max such as HairFx and Polyboost, they don't come with 3dsmax, so be aware of it.  It is a good buy for me to learn the work flow, but is not a step by step tutorial teaching you how to model, so it is NOT a beginner DVD.",1238803200,,1057,3.943661971830986
8180945,3,B000NQRRDE,"I'll start by saying I've been studying in the design field for 8+ years and so I've learnt a great deal about the importance of resources. I'm a Game Art Design major who recently switched from car and product design to pursue my love of character creation. I figured this DVD would help me advance my skill and knowledge and for the most part it has.

 First I will begin with the PROS. This DVD has a great artist at the helm who obviously knows his stuff. You will realize this once you see the man at work. He zips around pressing hot keys and creating meshes at the flick of a wrist.

 The presentation is pretty solid and well polished. The menus look good and the final product is above industry standards in my opinion. It's nice to get some insight from a master of the craft.

 I also appreciate the introduction of a new plug-in I originally had no idea existed. It really speeds up the process and saves days off your production time. POLYBOOST is truly a great program to own! Way to go plugging this plug-in (pun intended).

 Here are the CONS. With that said the videos strengths can also be its weaknesses. There are also some misleading assumptions that come along with the purchase of this DVD.

 First and foremost, this DVD isn't actually a DVD in the traditional sense. You cannot pop this in a DVD player and watch the video. This was actually a reason for me purchasing the video as my DVD-Rom drives were not working on my PC. My plan was to pop this into my DVD player and run the PIP on my Flat Screen. In reality this is a DVD-Rom. Now I assume the majority who purchase this won't have my issue but keep that in mind. I was able to fix my drives and watch the video by the way!

 Two, the most problematic issue with this DVD is that you cannot rewind, fast forward, stop, or pause it??? The DVD-ROM actually does not come with a built in interface with any video controls. Once you start the lecture it's started and you can't pause to catch up. I emailed tech support wondering why this was the case. What basically was done here was the manufacturer offered the quick time files as well as an auto play feature. When you first pop the movie in it auto plays. If you want to have access to the video controls you have to dig a bit deeper into the program files and find the actual quick time files. Each lecture has its own file and you must have quick time to view them. Now, I can honestly say the manufacturer has actually gone out of their way to create such an attractive auto play feature and interface. Most tutorials you buy only include the quick time files. What they've done here is shot themselves in the foot by upping the presentation, as there is no mention of how to locate the files in the instructions. Some consumers who purchase the video may assume it will function as a traditional DVD. It doesn't however. Once they include clarification on this matter the problem will be resolved. As a matter of fact the DVD is a year or two old and I think Gnomon has actually updated the newer videos to include video playback controls (for those who don't know clicking start>my computer> right clicking Gnomon Workshop on your DVD drive> click open> bin> misc> generic files will lead you to the actual quick time files.)

 My third issue with the video is the lack of detail at times or the overdose in detail. This DVD is not a step by step process. You will not watch Ian create a mesh from start to finish. He shows you the work flow and stays with you the majority of the time, especially as you create the accessories using POLYBOOST, but he assumes you are familiar with modeling the human body before hand. I would suggest if you don't have a mesh already available use the one provided in the project files or find a nice tutorial. If you don't have a mesh started do so and then watch the video. The beginning stages are skipped as the artist wants to focus on the actual production process. This is understandable given the amount of time this video would have taken but it would have been nice to see how he does more of his mesh (especially his hands). He did mention the importance of using old meshes and piecing them together and this is probably what he did. Don't expect many things to be created from scratch other than the clothing and detail work. Also, Ian does not walk you through importing in and out of Max and ZBRUSH so this is assumed as well. If you have any questions on that go to Pixologic.com as they offer a tutorial on the sight. You may also find yourself overdosing on information as the video can become fast paced at times. He zips in and out of programs and often there are things that could've been explained a bit better.

 As I mentioned above, Ian is a master and it shows. He knows all the hot keys and can walk through Max like he's reading a news paper. At times it can be hard for a novice to keep up. I wished he were more verbal about the hot keys he was using, although he did make an attempt to communicate them along the way. I sometimes found myself wondering ""how'd he do that?""

 Again, the DVD is great. I do suggest the purchase. It does have its minor problems but its more wishful thinking than anything. I wishfully assumed the video would be a step by step walk-through, which it is, but don't expect him to hold your hand at all times. He does skip ahead. I assume if you want to learn how to model the human figure you would pick up the Gnomon video that indulges on that topic. However, Ian's technique is so wonderful I still wish I could learn his method. The video playback was a real issue but it was quickly fixed. I would like to mention I had a problem finding the quick time files at first as my computer was set to hidden. If it had not been they would have been there at the beginning and I probably wouldn't have needed tech support. By the way, you can un-hide hidden files under the control panel ""preferences"" area (Start>Control Panel>Appearance and Themes> Folder options> View tab> click show hidden files and folders). The video is a joy to watch as Ian has a very inviting voice, remains enthusiastic, and keeps you engaged. Again, there are missed opportunities for more information but not enough that it was frustrating. If you are resourceful like me you will find ways to fill in the blanks. The best part about this video is the insight on professional work flow and a wonderful plug-in that cuts off hours of Vert tweaking and has cool tools to boot. $80 bucks may be a bit pricey but if you are a serious 3D modeler this video will rank high in your collection. I also picked up the follow up video on texturing by the way and will try to post the outcome later. Enjoy and happy modeling!",1227657600,,6724,4.352753391859537
