8152554,5,B000JNSNMA,As I write this Hollywood is being torn apart by several sex scandals. All at  the same time. Kevin Spacy having sex with children. Harvy  Weintien  Rapping women and holly wood looking the other way. Child sex rings . Wow.,1509580800,,223,4.525
8152555,4,B000JNSNMA,"Everything they said is correct. Just consider this .... Hollywood is now showing how to eat and drink each other. Why can't we tune this out, and turn this off. We have been conditioned to accept this as the new normal. But, we have the power of CHOICE. It's time to turn our backs to this foolishness and walk away. It's time to use of power of choice to do GOD's will.",1445731200,,371,4.166666666666667
8152556,5,B000JNSNMA,"Extremely thorough review of popular films and TV from a Biblical perspective. Thoughtful commentary and film clips mesh into this well produced 5 part documentary critiquing the world views disseminated by pop culture. Over 3 hours, great for group discussion. The drawback is that the series was produced in the early 1990's, but the material is still very relevant.",1438819200,,368,5.254237288135593

8152559,5,B000JNSNMA,This is an excellent expose on Hollywood's war on God and Family values. If you want to be informed especially if your a Christian don't hesitate to buy this DVD.,1226448000,2,162,4.433333333333334
8152560,5,B000JNSNMA,"I am 36 years old. A Christian less than 10 years, and 10 years ago I probably would have posted a similar review as the one by ""Hunter"" below, except I doubt I would have even watched it. I watched this just a few days ago, with different eyes today, though. Eyes that care about more than just sin and selfishness. Eyes that belong to a wife and three beautiful children. Eyes that see tenderly, with, hope and faith and love... for the church and the family where God has put me.

To ""Hunter"", I strongly encourage you to get this and watch it, knowing full well that have probably been so influenced by the things that Eric brings up and brings out into the open, that you will still reject the truth of what it contains. Again, I have little doubt that 10 years ago, I would have ""laughed and jeered"", too. But today, I could only watch this with so much pain and regret for the toll the influence these ""devices""--and the underlying philosophy they have come to exert--has taken on our society.

Wow. Hats off to Mr. Eric Holmberg and the Apologetics Group. This is the first production of yours I have watched. It won't be the last. God bless your efforts and endeavors. At least I can take comfort in the fact that even people like me and ""Hunter"" may come to a point--purely by God's grace--where we can see the truth of these things and protect the people we care about from the harmful influence they bring.

And by the way, this video does NOT advocate changing any laws or ""controlling the media"". In fact, the producer lauds the first amendment that allows some people to create completely soulless and defiling filth for the vultures to feast on. What he has done is provided some information that concerned parents and Christians can use to ""guard their hearts"" and to protect their families. Again, hats off. Great job. Thank you SO much.

Peace & Blessings,
Simple Mann",1214697600,12,1887,4.524926686217009
8152561,5,B000JNSNMA,"This is a powerful documentary on Hollywood and the anti-Christ spirit in it. The war on traditional family values,  from Inherit The Wind to the Last Temptation Of Christ, they mock christains. Be not deceived God is not mocked ;whatsoever, a man soweth that shall he also reap. This gives you a history of television and the laws that once protected our religion, like prayer in our public schools, they forget God. They once made classics like Ben-Hur that honoured God. My wife and I are very particular about buying and watching the classics from the past that are far better than the raunchy and profane shows of today.",1214352000,6,625,4.73394495412844
8152562,1,B000JNSNMA,"Just dropping in to say this sounds like a true laugh riot!! Since I can pick it up used - meaning the Xtians (claimed anyway - though the way they talk and write indicates knowledge of their holy book far below mine) (think ""Judge not, lest ye be judged"" ""Let him who is without sin cast the first stone"" and many similar stories and bon mots)won't get any of the money I will be obtaining a copy.  Normally I am more polite, but I'm tired of these (people) trying to control the media - and by way of politics the lives of the majority (getting larger I hear/read) who are deserting them in droves - because they are not happy with it.  Nobody guaranteed happiness or the ability to control others.  Don't complain about the mote in my eye until you hoist the beam out of yours (paraphrase, not quote).",1205884800,3,804,4.346666666666667
