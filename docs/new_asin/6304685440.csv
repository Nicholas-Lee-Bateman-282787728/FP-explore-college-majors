7875517,4,6304685440,"This is an excellent overview of a trip down Route 66. Michael Wallis is a very good narrator and the sights shown are interesting. From the Dixie Truckers Home to the Big Texan Steak House to the Mojave Desert each part of the route is a fascinating item that the viewer will find interesting.
Only a couple of criticisms. One is that some sections of the route are completely short-shrifted (i.e. without looking at a map you would never know from this video that Route 66 went through both Springfield, Illinois and Springfield, Missouri; both are totally ignored by the video as if neither city had anything intereting in it). The other is that packaging this as three tapes is a complete waste of resources since the material from all three tapes could easily be fit on one VHS tape.
Besides these criticisms though, I highly recommend the Route 66 video.",1019606400,4,860,4.701986754966887
7875518,4,6304685440,"Having just returned from a trip on Route 66, from Chicago to Oklahoma, I thoroughly enjoyed this series....granted the video quality could have been better, but the pace of the ""trip"" and the overall production technics reminded me of my trip.....unharried and reminicent of pre roadrage! I plan on buying another for my road companion. Thank you Mr. Wallis!",992908800,2,359,5.101694915254237
7875519,2,6304685440,"The advertising for this three-video set is VERY misleading ... mainly for what it DOESN'T tell you. While I feel the CONTENT of the ""three tapes"" is excellent, through no fault of the narrator the quality of the tape reproduction is AWFUL. I expected three tapes of the customary ""SP"" speed quality. What I got were three 40-minute-or-so tapes that looked like third-generation, taped in the VERY SLOW SPEED. Selling this as a three-tape set is VERY misleading. The entire program of about two hours could easily have been placed in a single cassette at the best quality/speed. The images on the slowest speed are fuzzy -- extremely so. Much detail is impossible to see. A shame for a travel tape. If I were Mr. Wallis I would SCREAM at the company that is selling three lousy tapes instead of one good one. Ripoff.",972432000,13,816,4.673611111111111
7875520,4,6304685440,"This is actually two individual 66 videos, one is on one tape, and the other is on two.
Both are narrarated by Michael Wallis and provide excellent overviews of Route 66 - it's sights, sounds and people.
An  great deal for the money!",952646400,7,233,4.4186046511627906
