8006006,1,B00013K894,"Six strippers (not seven) introduce themselves while dancing on stage. Then the five chunky strippers and a sweat beast decide to vacation together in Sandy Hook during the off season. They spend time together chatting etc. but the space is really wasted as it does nothing to build upon their ""as read"" character or contribute to the plot.

After an hour of bad jokes, dialouge, a nipple and tongue piercing we have the first killing, which was rather funny. Apparently the first chase scene was filmed by a camera man running behind the killer chasing the screaming stripper. Neither one could run that fast, and it appears she has to slow up so he can catch her. The killing scenes seemed to lack continuity and dead girls showed visible signs of breathing.

Mr. Creepo, a character with a hook, was done to make the film look campy, but instead comes off as bad. This isn't a who-dun-it.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, nudity...some of which I could have done with out.",1375228800,,967,4.710059171597633
8006007,1,B00013K894,"Staged mass murders, anyone?

This film's name is no coincidence.  As pointed out by researcher Jim Stone, in the movie ""The Dark Knight Rises"" there is a strike in a district called SANDY HOOK.  In the premiere, there was a massacre in a theater. On the same day, someone posted a review about this B-grade horror movie SANDY HOOK Lingerie Party Massacre, which is about a serial killer who strikes after hurricanes.

In November 2012 the demented elite created and named an (artificial, HAARP-controlled) hurricane SANDY that affected the whole Northeast of the USA, including both the town of Sandy Hook, NJ (where this movie is supposed to take place) and the village of Sandy Hook, in Newtown, Connecticut, where, a few weeks later, a serial killer (more than one - there is ample evidence) enters SANDY HOOK Elementary School to massacre kids....or make it look that way.",1356566400,16,877,4.905405405405405
8006008,1,B00013K894,"This whole movie, or as much of it as I could sit through, is a real amateur effort.

It looks as if some misguided parent gave their fourteen year old geek son a cheap video camera and he went out an made a movie.

You can't see most of it because the exposure settings are wrong.  For one long, tedious section the ""cast"" are driving through dreary countryside in a van, and it seems that the cameraman pointed the video camera out the window and forgot to turn it off.  It stars somebody's sister's ugly friends, who presumably ""acted"" in this mess for free, and has no discernable script.  They arrive at some dump of a shack, which even the cockroaches have deserted, and where, due to poor lighting, you still can't see anybody's face on the video and you can't hear what they are mumbling either.  I suppose if you are a geeky schoolboy you can't afford a better set, lighting equipment, a scriptwriter, actors or professional advice.

Then...  Then I don't know what happens because I turned it off.

It amazes me that this got a commercial release.",1132617600,2,1057,4.521052631578947
8006009,1,B00013K894,"I only purchased this DVD to add to my Debbie Rochon collection.  Personally it is not worth owning!  Debbie looks as great as she ever does, but still the entire movie is a joke.  A boring snooze fest to put it into better terms.
Don't waste your time with this dvd, even if you are a Debbie Rochon fan.  This could possibly be the worst horror film she has been in.
The reason I give this one star is for Debbie, because she is the only one that even shines in this entire movie.  I considered this almost as painful to watch as Mari Cookie and the Killer Tarantula.  I guess if you liked Mari Cookie, then you might like this movie.  It is very slow and not very entertaining.  The real action happens after around 40+ minutes of nothing!
For the same $20 you spend on this, you could buy Hellblock13 and American Nightmare.  Both are great Debbie Rochon films!!!!
If you are looking for a comparable type of movie that is much better, then buy Santa Claws.  It has everything that this movie has, but everything is much better in Santa Claws!!!!!!!!  Debbie Rochon ROCKS in Santa Claws compared to this movie!
Like I said, don't waste your money.  If you need to see it, rent it, or buy it, but not for more than $10 delivered, but that is still too much for this movie.
I think I have seen all of Debbie's horror films on DVD, and this was the worst, except for maybe Cremains, because only her voice is used in that movie.  At least Cremains was a better movie over all though.",1078012800,6,1483,4.2913669064748206
8006010,5,B00013K894,"It is not often that a low-budget movie like ""The Sandy Hook Lingerie Party Massacre"" can entertain without seeming to shout out all the ways it was done on the cheap. But writer/director Tim Beckley has achieved just that in this stalker thriller featuring unknown but quite beautiful women who are a complete embodiment of the term ""Scream Queen."" Though shot on videotape, as a great many independent films are nowadays, the finished product never has that embarrassing, thrown-together quality, as is the case with many similar ""homemade"" efforts.
The movie begins with the voiceover narratives of a group of strippers, who explain their philosophy in choosing their lifestyle as ""exotic dancers,"" and why they should be viewed as artists, not fallen women. The women decide to take a vacation together from the club they work in to get a break from the oversexed men continually sniffing around them. They rent a beach house on the Jersey Shore from an extremely unkempt, babbling caretaker named Mr. Creepo, who is actually Beckley himself in a hilarious cameo performance.
Needless to say, once the strippers arrive at the house, the trouble begins. The women begin to report creepy feelings of foreboding, which are exacerbated by the suggestion of their unofficial ""ringleader"" (played to perfection by actress Debbie Rochon) that she do a tarot card reading to help them pass the time during a storm. The cards show darkness and danger ahead, which naturally adds to the women's sense of impending doom. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the women, a serial killer with a large hook is slowly making his way toward them, reeking of madness and with murder on his mind. The suspense is built up slowly and carefully, and the inevitable resulting mayhem is still shocking in spite of the fact that we know it's coming.
Beckley makes excellent use of several standard mystery plot devices, including foreshadowing, flash-forwards and comic relief. There is more than a little nudity, but it is all of the soft-core variety, and the violence is conducted mostly offstage, which may be as much a matter of good taste as it is a concession to a small operating budget. The banter between the girls, while raunchy at times, is both clever and realistic, with uniformly excellent performances from all the actresses in spite of their youth and obvious inexperience. The movie has many of the earmarks of a more expensive production, and makes up for most of its shortcomings with clever, absurd flashes of humor and playfulness.
The film can also be called ""atmospheric"" in its use of genuine Jersey Shore scenery, shot on location at a deserted amusement park with plenty of references to sex under the boardwalk and gypsy psychics who long ago moved on. One learns that the lighthouse that figures so prominently in the plot (watch the movie to find out why) is the oldest one in America, predating the Revolutionary War.
The DVD is very professionally packaged, with the usual helpful chapter titles and other bonus material included, and even some outtakes after the closing credits, like you would find in a big studio release. An interview with Beckley/Mr. Creepo himself, in which he talks about his horror movies and his long and distinguished career as a UFO researcher and author, makes for interesting viewing as well. The editing by Timothy Swartz and the musical soundtrack by the Serpenteens round out an overall triumph that deserves to be seen by connoisseurs of horror as well as the simply curious. You may never hear about ""The Sandy Hook Lingerie Party Massacre"" on Oscar night, but it is nevertheless the arcane kind of cinematic oddity you will never forget.",1075852800,,3674,4.985342019543974
