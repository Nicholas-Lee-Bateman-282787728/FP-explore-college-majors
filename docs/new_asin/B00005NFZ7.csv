1633510,1,B00005NFZ7,"Attracted foolishly by the endorsements on the cover, I am ashamed to say that I bought this DVD. As an avid Southpark viewer who appreciates subtle (and not-so-subtle) social commentary, I was hoping that Slim Shady would present another viewpoint on our times. My hopes were dashed when this turned out to be exactly what I have heard critics accuse Eminem of being - taste and talent-free...",1017187200,4,394,4.895522388059701
1633511,5,B00005NFZ7,"Of course it takes a certain kind of personality to fully appreciate the dark humor of Eminem, but if you are a fan this DVD is a MUST! It is absolutely HILARIOUS! I just can't tell you how much I've enjoyed it already. My only complaint is it's TOO SHORT! Watch it! You'll be glad you did!",1009670400,,290,4.105263157894737
1633512,5,B00005NFZ7,If You are a slim shady fan you need this movie. Now you can watch all the hilarious slim shady shows without waiting for it to down load. If you like south park you will love this. It takes you into the twisted mind of the best rapper of all time Eminem. Everything about this DVD is excellent. Do yourself a favor and buy this now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1005436800,,395,5.0
1633513,3,B00005NFZ7,"This DVD features Eminem's animated ""Slim Shady World"" program as well as never before seen footage, interviews, and music from Eminem & friends. Eminem and Paul Rosenberg were actively involved with this production. The language and content are really explicit, the music is not totally satisfactory and the episodes are really short. If you do like ""South Park"", you might like ""The Slim Shady World Show"". Eminem-Character with red eyes looks kinda bizzare (Well,compared to Cartman he is a beauty :) I personally wasn't too fond of it!",1000944000,11,539,5.136363636363637
1633514,5,B00005NFZ7,This transaction made it possible for me to re-live good memories as this product was hard to find and memorable for me. i was able to purchase this item in perfect condition and more than acceptable shipping speed. I would definately do business again with this seller. Item as described. Rapid shipping. Thank you very much.,1239494400,,326,4.839285714285714
1633515,3,B00005NFZ7,"It has its moments but needs some polish, and I don't like how he did Everlast because 'Whitey Ford Sings the Blues' was off the chain. How the hell do you access 'the Ass and the Curious' bonus episode??",1080864000,4,204,4.256410256410256
1633516,5,B00005NFZ7,"This is the most ""shocking"" and unnerving cartoon to come out since South Park. It's bolder, braver, better animation makes it a check in the critics column. The same energy and enthusiasm that Eminem brings to his music, he brings to this cartoon. It's dark, sarcastic, well written, inquisitive, true to life and hilarious! The characters are well developed and grounded in harsh reality.... blatantly the best cartoon ever made. The best thing about this cartoon tho....? It's systematically fcuks Christina ""anna nicole smith thinks i look tacky"" Aguilera right up her tiny trashy white ass!! And THAT'S what I call ENTERTAINMENT.",1080000000,4,634,5.2254901960784315
1633517,2,B00005NFZ7,"Eminem aka Marshall Mathers is great. His music is talented and he's pretty bright. However, I must say... this DVD is really not anything great. I was very unimpressed with it.. basically just a flash animation with Eminem crew voice overs. It has a very shallow and thrown together type writing for the script. There is basically no plot to this thing and the few times it made me laugh was to little to make up for the rest of the DVD. I give it 2 stars because the big E was in it, and for the 3 times I chuckled. Otherwise it was bad, just being honest. Go rent it or borrow from a friend if your really that interested. But if your going to be spending gas money to pick it up, think twice.",1069372800,4,696,4.125
1633518,5,B00005NFZ7,"Wonderful! Way better than South Park! I watch it all the time, its really funny! Although alot of sexual content(beware) You can expect that from Em! I just love it! Let me tell you something, just buy it and I bet youll love it! ( enless you don't like Eminem)! eminem plays the voice of Eminem,Slim Shady,Marshall Mathers, Ken Kaniff, and occasional specail apperance people. The bonus is an D-12 video to fight music wich is my favorite video in the world! It also contains a special look at Eminem and trailers! Buy it now!",1051833600,5,528,4.568421052631579
1633519,3,B00005NFZ7,"I was very curious to see this Eminem cartoon. How is it? Well, I must say I was expecting a bit more... The cartoons are sometimes funny but, most of the time, dumb. It messes up with a lot of celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Versace, Christina Aguilera, Ben Affleck... It may be good for a few laughs.. There are about eight episodes in this DVD. There is also a fine Making-Of. Eminem does the voice actings of Eminem, Slim Shady and Marshall Mathers (yes, there are these three characters). Paul Rosemberg does cool voice acting too... These cartoons were originally presented at the internet.. So, overall, it's worth a rent, not quite worth a buy, unless you're a hard Eminem fan...",1048809600,2,694,4.69672131147541
1633520,5,B00005NFZ7,"Eminem did it again! Yeah, he produced some dope,cool cartoon,of his alter ego Slim Shady. Slim and his homies are beating up Celebrities and are doing a lotta [stuff] on this dvd. You can also see Marshall,Eminem,the gay-guy KEN KANIFF (from Eminems CD's),BIG D (that's like the big bully) DAVE ... and Southpark,NSync,Aguilera,George Michael,Ben Affleck,Olsentwins and lot more. If you like Eminem,you'll love this DVD,I can watch it over n over again. Many Characters are spoken by Marshall Mathers. It's really funny,it's worth it,I swear by my mom =o)",1047513600,2,556,5.258426966292135
1633521,3,B00005NFZ7,"If South Park can be a little too tame for your taste, you might want to check out The Slim Shady Show.
The characters (loosely based on various Eminem alter-egos) and humor are more sophisticated than you might expect, even though it runs on the cruder side. Tastelessness abounds, quite often to the detriment of celebrities--Kurt Cobain, Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert Downey Jr. are much abused--but always for the sake of comedy. And you don't have to be an Eminem fan to like it--his music never makes an appearance, though in the best episode, ""Slimshank Redemption,"" Slim does some freestyling while in solitary confinement--a hilarious rant which sends up Eminem's style perfectly (""He's not even making sense anymore!"" nerdy Marshall squeaks).
My personal favorite of the posse, Ken Kaniff (voiced by Eminem) is fashion-concious and man-crazy, and clearly the most fun. His act of raising Gianni Versace from the dead is by turns touching, hilarious, and results in new outfits for the gang and a great party. Anyone who accuses Em of homophobia might think twice after watching Ken in action.
This DVD loses a star for not having much in the way of extras. The ""lost episode"" should have stayed so and the picture gallery is pointless.  The behind-the-scenes featurette is nice but basically fluff. I would like it to have been longer with more in-depth information.  The D-12 video is well-conceived but musically listless.  Buy this for the episodes alone, they are worth it.",1027555200,21,1486,5.032520325203252
1633522,5,B00005NFZ7,"You totally have to be an open-minded person to see this - it is extremely funny, if you find crude to be funny! They poke fun at many famous hollywood stars and they say it like it is... no lies or politically correct attitudes here.  The writers didn't hold back with this one... non-conforming, explicit cartoons at it's best! I loved it!  Be sure to pay close attention as there are many little hidden jokes that will crack you up!",1023408000,6,435,4.425
1633523,5,B00005NFZ7,"Eminem's work on this is both smart and brilliant! the cartooning is sickly funny and he still finds time to make fun of everyone, just like he does in all of his songs. these are all shows that were originally aired on the internet... and during the anger management tour. it's a lot like the sick and twisted comedy of south park, and he even makes fun of south park in this dvd! along with mary kate & ashley olsen, mase, christina aguilera, robert downey jr, ben affleck, matt damon, his mother, leonardo dicaprio, the gouverment, and much, MUCH, more! it also includes a lot of extras that the vhs doesn't. like behind the scenes footage, picture gallery, music videos, plus a never before seen episode! it's worth it! buy it!",1021161600,5,731,4.587786259541985

7946918,1,B00005NFZ7,"The annoying thing I find about shows such as this one is that a lot of fans will not give a truthful rating, for fear of offending other fans (or the Messiah-who-walks-among-us in the form of Eminem!)

This DVD is bad. Its only redeeming virtue is the extras concerning&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/8-Mile/dp/B00006FMGR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">8 Mile</a>.
Even the characters are lame and add practically nothing to our understanding of Eminem.
Take, for example, the best character: Ken Kaniff. His skits on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Slim-Shady-LP/dp/B00000I5JQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Slim Shady LP</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Marshall-Mathers-LP/dp/B00004WMYB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Marshall Mathers LP</a>'s have far richer content than all the stuff he does on the whole series of this garbage and, if anything, he actually comes out as being fairly normal and boring by the end of the DVD, which I don't think was intended!

There are also 3 characters with no basis in the rest of the Eminem saga ('Big D', 'Dave' and(I kid you not) 'the blue haired chick') who are just lazy filler for Eminem's alter egos & his mum.

I'll admit - some of the episodes almost approach being the masterful material we expect from Eminem (e.g. the first one). However, even the best ones are a set of loosely connected ideas with stupid time wasting pieces like Eminem throwing bottles out of the car etc. None of them fill you with awe and wonder, and there isn't a decent rap song in sight.

Overall, I really hoped and wished this series would add something to the Eminem saga. Unfortunately though, you can't rate something as good just because of what it should be; it is what it is - a waste of time. If you really want some good extra material from Eminem, try the books or the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/8-Mile/dp/B00006FMGR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">8 Mile</a>&nbsp;extras.
