far cry' from the original ""Cat People"". Oh, you get to see the original stars, but it seems just like another film made to cash in on the original film and that is exactly what they did. They should have put this film in the same box with the first ""Cat People"" film because paying $17.95 0r #23.95 is simply not worth it. Even if it is on Blu-ray.",1522368000,,359,4.0
7929608,5,B000051ZMX,"An important film, this work is a total surprise in every way. No fan of horror, the great migr producer Val Lewton would be granted a budget, with the sole demand that he use a title that suggested this film was a sequel to his previous hit. Letwon is the rare exception in which a producer, and, in this case writer, (I believe he employs a pseudonym) is regarded as the animating influence or ""auteur"" of the work, although Robert Wise is ideal to carry that unique vision forward, especially in Lewton's slate of genre-defying horror films. As stated, this film is a very loose sequel to his success ""The Cat People."" With the exception of actress Simone Simon, now reconfigured as a beautiful ghost in a lovely dress in these dreamy, surreal sequences that are more than likely a figment of a little girl's imagination, this film has almost no relationship with its predecessor, and is easily the better work. At no point did Lewton concede that the work in question had any supernatural qualities. Again, this is not a horror film. Added to that, the film has next to nothing to do with the previous cat-themed work. What we have here, folks, is genuine literature - the story of a troubled little girl living under the yoke of her domineering father who cannot accept that she does not laugh and play ""like the other little girls.""

The sad child, instead, indulges in these flights of fancy that could have been brought on by her having merely seen a photo of his father's now deceased first love (Simone Simon), which must occur off-camera. The movie, then, is a rather brilliant allegory. Once the father accepts the daughter as she is, all ties up rather pleasantly (and perhaps too neatly for some). In truth, the film reminded me of Nabokov's best, dreamiest work, and no, no connection to the Russian author's ""Lolita"" should be inferred; I meant, rather, that this has a Nabokovian tone to it - a kind of unforced, underplayed surrealism that, at the same time, skewers the drive for American conviviality and always smiling. The father definitely has issues in his new marriage. Perhaps the girl senses this, and dreams up this delightful flight of fancy; since she knows nothing of the ""cat curse,"" cats have nothing to do with her dream sequences. This is a film about a new marriage, a new family, forming with this tremendously odd iceberg simmering right below the surface, and how hard it can be when a father attempts to force family fun.

As stated, Lewton never (rarely) employed the supernatural, unless as a feint. Lewton also directed, uncredited, arguably the best sequences in ""Gone with the Wind."" What a talent. Ignore the title, as well as the poster. Enjoy Director Robert Wise's great work. The man edited ""Citizen Kane."" The ""spooky"" (it certainly is not haunted) home is actually Orson Welles's Amberson mansion from his masterpiece ""The Magnificent Ambersons.""  Enjoy. It's worth it. A completely unique film in every way.",1521244800,3,2960,4.8
7929609,5,B000051ZMX,"The Curse of the Cat People (1944) is not really sequel to Cat People (1942) as much as a stand alone physiological thriller that just happens to be an extension of the original characters. We have seen the formula before but you may not have seen such a presentation; a lonely child Amy Reed (Ann Carter) seeks a playmate that understands her. Who best but the spirit of Oliver's dead wife, Irena (Simone Simon) one of the cat people. Naturally this upsets the parents. Toss in Amy's new relation to reclusive neighbor Julia Farren (Julia Dean). Julia has problems of her own relating to her daughter. The story just gets complex from there.

The question is, is it dangerous to fantasize that much and what will become of the characters in the end.",1504224000,4,750,4.639097744360902
7929610,2,B000051ZMX,"The Curse of the Cat People, 1944 film

A group of young children are walking and singing along a country road in Sleepy Hollow in Tarrytown NY. Amy chases a butterfly, then slaps Donald. Her parents visit her school. No one shows up for Amy's party, the letters weren't delivered. The other children won't play with her. ""Look at the giraffe!"" There is an old dark house nearby, does a witch live there? What can that ring do? Amy must return that ring to the lady. Julia Faron tells the story of the Headless Horseman. Will it create a nightmare? Who was Irena? Amy finds her friend, for always.

Their kitchen has a Dutch door. Christmas carolers visit to entertain. Amy gives a present to her friend and Mrs. Faron. Her father Oliver doesn't believe her. Amy is punished, and must forget her friend. The school teacher explains what her parents must do to end Amy's belief in an imaginary friend. But Amy has left to go outside in the cold winter. She wanders until she enters Mrs. Faron's house. The searchers find her and bring her home. It is a happy ending. ""Can you see Irena?""

Sequels are often worse than the original. This film isn't worth watching unless as the sequel. It is a low-budget film, but a better story would redeem it. [""The Curse"" may refer to the future of these stars.]",1413331200,,1298,4.514893617021277
7929611,5,B000051ZMX,"Rare is it when a sequel outshines its original film. Rarer still is it when that sequel and the original are both considered B films. Films like Terminator 2: Judgment Day, or Aliens, have been posited as greater than the first films in those series, although there are good arguments back and forth, but they were both big budget A films. In watching Val Lewton's RKO produced, 1944 black and white, 70 minute long masterpiece, The Curse Of The Cat People, I think there's little doubt that it's superior to the very good film that preceded it, 1942's Cat People. Even people who agree with my assessment of the later film's superiority, however, often miss out on the reasons why. More on that in a bit.
  This film's closest companion, in terms of filmic kinship, would not be made by Lewton, however, nor by any other American nor European filmmaker. It would take almost a quarter century, but 1968's Japanese Godzilla's Revenge (Gojira-Minira-Gabara: Oru Kaij Daishingeki)- another sequel to a B horror film, put out by Toho, and about a latchkey urban child who is bullied and retreats into the fantasy world of Godzilla, is the only film that is nearly as accurate and sensitive in its portrayal of life from the view of a sensitive child- although that is a definite male take on the subject matter. This film's real and palpable sense of girlhood puts you in the moment with its lead character, and it all works. And, on top of that, The Curse Of The Cat People is an even better film than Ishro Honda's great kid's film.
  It is heavily dependent upon a great screenplay by DeWitt Bodeen, who seamlessly moves the story of Oliver and Alice Reed (Kent Smith and Jane Randolph) up a good seven years from the original. The two lovers, who survived the terror of the earlier film, imposed by the feline charms of his first wife Irena (Simone Simon)- a murderess who may or may not have been capable of shapeshifting into a panther, are now suburban residents of Tarrytown, in upstate New York. This allows for the working in of Washington Irving's The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow mythos. They now have a beautiful blond daughter who is moody and a loner. Her name is Amy, and she is played by Ann Carter, in one of the greatest performances by a child....The rest of the plot has been discussed elsewhere....Not only is the look contemporary, but so is the narrative. The cinematography by Nicholas Musuraca is top notch, and the morph of Barbara into Irena is still effective. An early scene of a male classmate of Amy's, who accidentally kills a butterfly she likes with his hat, is very subtly animated. Her reaction- an angry slap, is dead on realistic and apropos for the character we see unfold. The contrasts of black with white, and all the subtle shades of gray between, is outstanding. The directors of the film were journeyman Gunther Von Fritsch, who fell behind schedule and went overbudget, and Robert Wise, who was promoted from RKO editor on Orson Welles' Citizen Kane (1941) and The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), to finish the film. Both shot an almost equal load. The commentary by Mank claims that Fritsch directed what are the more pedestrian scenes, while the climax, and scenes within the Reed household, were all Wise's work. The next year Lewton had Wise direct The Body Snatcher. He then went on to a long career that would include directing such film classics as The Day The Earth Stood Still, West Side Story, The Sound Of Music, and The Andromeda Strain. That the man, despite two Oscars as Best Director, is never mentioned in conversations about great directors is odd- to say the least, and his lack of recognition is almost criminal. Yes, he has no trademark style, the way a Bergman or Scorsese film does. Yet, all he did was churn out consistently good, and occasionally great films for half a century. This was his very first.
  Many critics, however, have overlooked this film, and denied its connection to the original film, thus revealing how little most film critics are worth....Another aspect of the film that is taken as a given by most critics is the idea that Julia Farren is a delusional old woman when she claims that Barbara is an imposter. Yet, we never really know the truth of that claim, and there is a suggestion that it might very well be true. Several times, when we see Barbara skulk away from Julia, we see her descend down the stairs, to the place where- in such a grand mansion, the servant's quarters would be. It could very well be that Barbara is an imposter trying to con a delusional old woman out of her fortune.
 The Curse Of The Cat People is a truly great film, and is considered a B film only because of its budget. Yet, very few films, A or B, American or foreign, pack as much punch and psychological realism into it, especially at a child's level. Not even Ingmar Bergman ever came close to depicting the pre-adult mind with such depth. That this all occurs in a horror film, which is also every bit as much a family film as more recent classics, like My Dog Skip or October Sky, is a testament to both Lewton, and especially Wise, who, in his film debut, greatly uplifted the more pedestrian work of the man he replaced, and sent his own career into film history. Alas, Ann Carter faded from the film business, just like Gunther Von Fritsch, or her character's ide fixe, Irena, did. Growing pains can really suck.",1221004800,5,5390,4.637696335078534
