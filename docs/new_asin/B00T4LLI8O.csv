8700249,5,B00T4LLI8O,"Cannot recommend this highly enough. Thank you, Amazon, for alerting me about this silent, serial film. The star was a well-known actor in Europe. I have seen some of his other films, including ""Edward Kean"", which were wonderful, but did not know about this one or even the genre...serial, silent films that were popular in France during the 1920s. The story, an Othello-like saga, shows what happens to a good man because his close friend and business associate is jealous of the love a young woman has for Mosjoukine's character.

One of the most interesting aspects of the film is the depiction of  changes pre- and post- WW1, as these changes were understood during the 1920s . One aspect is the way that technological changes are depicted. These include still, film photography [ which replaced daguerrotypes and glass plates] and trains. Photography is part of a major plot element. Do not wish to give this away so I'm being brief here. There is also a scene in which police on horseback chase escaped convicts on a train...and the train wins. Anyway, it is an interesting feature of the film.

The craftsmanship of this film, in all regards, including the restoration, is simply breathtaking.  The story is as good as any Charles Dickens' tale with all of the changes in fortune and surprise sub-plots one can imagine. Never lost my interest for a moment. The first episode is actually the slowest moving but once the story is set, it is gripping.

The star and the production team were almost entirely the top theatrical talent of Russia prior to the revolution. There is even a you tube video available online of an early silent comedy that Mosjoukine made in Russia, which is fascinating because it shows how middle class pre-revolutionary Russia actually was.  If you find it, pay particular attention to the sets and costumes. They look positively Victorian. They also appear to have been done in a studio as opposed to outdoors with open sets using daylight, which was common in the US during the pre-1918 silent era.",1476403200,,2032,4.8414985590778095
8700250,5,B00T4LLI8O,"Walking into this film totally cold, only having some minor passion for the magnetism of M. Mosjoukine, I had no idea what to expect. A horror/comedy akin to the Old Dark House Films of Universal Studios late '20s-early 30's period? An avant-garde that would put the work of L'Herbier on his ear? OH HELL NO! Of course, you'll get aspects of both, but this series is quite unique, holds suspense, relieves said suspense with a nice sense of the pastiche and kitchy---and just when you think you can guess the next minor plot development, you realize you're as enveloped as reading a novel. It doesn't help that Neil Brand's score (a simple piano accompaniment) is totally enthralling in every episode. It doesn't push one away that the basic plot line is revenge and jealousy (ultimately, the stuff that soap operas are made of). It doesn't help that the cast is made up of major French character actors or featured actors that punctuate the cinema for some ten years to come. So, what makes it not worthy of your money? Absolutely nothing! Most silent French cinema reads like a novel (La Roue, namely). This reads like a guilty pleasure, and it's so intentional. Nothing about this film has aged in a derogatory fashion. Five minutes into the film and one becomes engrossed.

A special highlight of the cast of Charles Vanel (Javert of Raymond Bernard's Les Miserables). So utterly villainous. Now, let's talk about presentation. The film was restored by Cinematheque Francaise (a worthy and well established source---see the DVD of Phantom of the Cinematheque). The DVD was produced by a dear friend of mine, who spent quite a bit of time getting the transfers over here from their homeland and commissioning a score. I'll be a bit harsh and say I expected a hi-def or greater transfer, given our present state of home media, but the Cinematheque has been yielding a lot of standard defs. Also, for the sake of merely seeing the film, the scan looks beautiful, the midtowns are amazing, and FOR ONCE I haven't noticed any interlace lines (the plague of transferring alternate frame rates). This really looks projectable and is a beautiful representation of a loving reconstruction. For any nerds out there, one might question the title cards. The fonts are interesting, but they are all film transfers so those answers should be directed at the Cinematheque, or even just forgotten due to the love put into this DVD. Please don't stint yourself. Do it well!",1472774400,,2460,4.857142857142857

8700254,5,B00T4LLI8O,"During the silent era, French moviegoers possessed a tremendous affinity for serials. We would do well to share their enthusiasm. Louis Feuillade's FANTOMAS films (1913-1914)--produced to head off the threat of the American-made serial THE EXPLOITS OF ELAINE--demonstrated the richness and potential of the serial format, where the elongated narrative provided breathing room for the mingling of the
naturalistic and the fantastic. Serials became so popular after World War I that French distributors discovered a new market for old wares: previously unseen American feature films like the 1916 SHERLOCK HOLMES became salable after being chopped up and serialized.

Viewers primarily familiar with American serials of the 1930s and '40s, such as FLASH GORDON or CAPTAIN MARVEL, will probably be surprised by the fluidity of their French counterpart. Largely bereft of cliff-hangers and not boxed into an arbitrary two-reel running time, the French serials are still pulp and were treated as such by the industry that produced them. The ten-episode LA MAISON DU MYSTERE [HOUSE OF MYSTERY] was recognized as a cut above--a serious film that happened to be a serial. It could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the other releases of Films Albatros, Alexendre Kamenka's studio made up largely of Russian exiles. It's still a wonderful entertainment today--and a much finer showcase for leading man Ivan Mosjoukine than later, irredeemably self-indulgent Albatros productions like LE LION DES MOGOLS.

Adapted from a novel by Jules Mary, HOUSE OF MYSTERY is a perpetual motion machine, plot-wise. Though its theme of miscarriage of justice is a serious one, HOUSE OF MYSTERY is as eventful as any pulp serial: Murder! Intrigue! Disguises! Blackmail! Financial ruin! A suicide pact! Even World War I is shoehorned in as a five-minute footnote in the sixth episode. Yet somehow the pace remains relaxed and natural. This quality is especially notable in light of the serial's more implausible moments. (When was the last time a simple eyepatch and a fake mustache successfully concealed a man's identity from his wife?)

The sustained visual elegance remains the strongest selling point of HOUSE OF MYSTERY.  From an early scene filmed entirely in elaborate silhouettes to the matter-of-fact formation of a human bridge in the serial's most impressive action sequence, HOUSE OF MYSTERY is a film whose makers were clearly liberated by the opportunities afforded by a six-and-a-half-hour story.

While some earlier Flicker Alley DVDs (PERILS OF THE NEW LAND, LANDMARKS OF EARLY SOVIET FILM) used very old video masters, HOUSE OF MYSTERY pushes the limit of the DVD format. (Pity there's no Blu-ray, but the mastering cost for a niche title like this is likely prohibitive.) Derived from a fresh HD scan of an extensive photochemical restoration from the Cinematheque francaise (which includes some sparse but effective tinting), HOUSE OF MYSTERY looks merveilleux.",1441929600,,2953,5.42483660130719
8700255,5,B00T4LLI8O,"At six and a half hours, Le Maison de Mystery/House of Mystery is a serial, but not in the American two-fisted actioner sense at least, it is sort of like that, but also sort of like Les Miserables or some other story spanning a generation and with the fate of an escaped prisoner and the happiness of innocent young people hanging in the balance. That's not to say that the source material, by a popular but forgotten novelist called Jules Mary, is Hugo-level it's a vigorous potboiler, with enough twists and emotional moments to get the job done even when the plot contrivances strain believability. Filmed today, it would seem unbelievable.

But it wasn't filmed today. It was filmed in 1921-2 and released in 1923, when the movies and the whole world was young and tomorrow's cliches could be filmed as if everything about them was new. And it was filmed by the refugees from the cinema and theater of Moscow who regrouped in France after the Revolution, including the magnetic star Ivan Mosjoukine, with their peerless understanding of psychological acting and a freshness about how to stage scenes that makes every turn of the plot feel new. At 90 minutes this would be about its plot, but at 6-1/2 hours, it's about the faces of the actors as they go through everything love, jealousy, action, deception, thwarted love, lustful evil, disguises, trains, circuses, lynch mobs. It's not just that it feels advanced for such early cinema it feels like all of cinema in one movie. You'll never need to watch any other movie ever again.

I exaggerate, slightly this is a melodrama, and there are things in other Mosjoukine films, especially the modernist intellectual drama The Late Matthias Pascal, that are beyond this pulp fiction. But nearly every chapter is an emotional workout, handled with surprising delicacy for the time by the superb cast. At the beginning Jules Villandrit (Mosjoukine) is a successful young textile manufacturer engaged to Regine (Helene Darly); he seems to have a good partnership with his manager, Corradin (Charles Vanel), but in fact Corradin is as jealous as Iago and plants nasty thoughts about the elderly Marjory (the single-named Bartkevich). There's a fight; Marjory is found dead... but Rudeberg (Nicolas Koline), an itinerant with a Brownie camera, caught the real killer on film. And so the chess pieces are in place as, by chapter three, Villandrit goes off to a tropical penal colony for the crime he did not commit. It takes a little while after that to get them all moving again toward righting this wrong, but starting with chapter five, which is almost entirely devoted to a thrilling prison escape attempt on a train, it never lets up.

Mosjoukine, who gets to have a different look in nearly every chapter (including a turn as a Pagliacciesque clown of the he who gets slapped variety), holds the screen hypnotically, and wrings the most out of any scene in which the painfulness of his separation from his family has to be dramatized. But I was just as captivated by Vanel, one of the few non-Russians in the cast and an actor whose career would run, astonishingly, into the late 1980s, best known for playing Javert in the great 1930s Les Miserables and, two decades after that, in The Wages of Fear and Diabolique for Clouzot. I thought Mosjoukine was in many ways the most modern of silent stars, his questioning intelligence always on view along with the Valentinoesque matinee idol persona, but Vanel seems more modern yet, a figure anticipating noir, and rotter though he is, there's something empathetic if not sympathetic about watching him drive himself mad with desire for everything another man had over the long course of the film. Koline, who played Tristan Fleuri in Napoleon, is fun as the crafty peasant who outwits Corradin all the way to the end, and though I wasn't particularly captivated by Darly as the young Regine, by the time the actress in her 20s is playing a woman in middle age, she's quite convincing.

The print is grainy but clear and with good contrast; it's a pleasure to watch throughout, and there's beautiful toning work which greatly enhances the mostly outdoor photography of the location settings (primarily a chateau in Montreuil). Neil Brand provides an appropriate score which pounds home the most melodramatic moments most effectively. There's a slideshow of production stills, and a booklet with an essay on the film by Lenny Borger and notes on the cast members.",1437955200,,4461,4.904635761589404
8700256,5,B00T4LLI8O,"The title of this serial is a bit of a misnomer; no house figures in a particularly major way, nor is there any particular mystery present. But beyond that, this 3-disc set from Flicker Alley delivers wonderfully in all other respects.

The focus of the story is Julien Villandrit (Ivan Mosjoukine) and his poor choices and the disasters that befall him. In love with Rgine de Bettigny (Hlne Darly), Julien is blind to the fact that his business partner, Henri Corradin (Charles Vanel) is also in love with Rgine and will stop at nothing to get her. After Julien marries Rgine, Corradin suggests that the old banker Marjory (Bartkvich) has ulterior motives in funding their business in order to get close to Rgine. Nearly driven mad by Corradin's Iago-like machinations, eventually the suspicious Julien goes berserk and attacks Marjory. Regaining composure, he leaves, only for Corradin to step in and finish the job and to pin the murder on Julien. Soon Julien is off to prison, sentenced to 20 years at hard labor. But Corradin doesn't count on two things: Julien is determined to escape from prison, and the local woodcutter, Rudeberg (Nicolas Kolin) is an amateur photographer who just happens to get lucky with his camera, and is not above making some money. And that's just the first few chapters!

If you found Les Vampires to be hopelessly tangled and confusing, and were ready to give up on French serials, La maison du mystre will be quite pleasing. The story is pretty much linear and straightforward. But it's presented in a mammoth, sweeping epic of ten serial chapters, each running around 40 minutes (four reels).  The expansive scope offered here allows for the adventures to flow naturally, and without sudden changes; in a two-hour cutdown surely the jealous workings of Corradin upon Julien would be far too abrupt. Several set pieces are allowed to grow and become truly spectacular, such as Julien's harrowing escape from prison. It takes about an hour to really get going, but once it does, it doesn't let go for the remaining five and one-half hours. The time investment is worth it, as the drama is vivid and the narrative is compelling.

There are quite a few visual flairs present here; most notable is the treatment of the wedding of Julien and Rgine in silhouette form. This striking tableau anticipates the paper cutout animation of The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926), and is truly gorgeous. The camera is surprisingly active for a film made in the early 1920s, although the use of closeups is still a bit off in the future. But there are interesting tracking shots and some often startling and ingenious movement. The acting is a bit stilted and stereotypical, but Vanel as Corradin makes a terrific villain, with a pious and friendly face callously hiding a wicked and twisted interior.

Lost for many years, the film was known only in a short cutdown version until the original negative was found and restored. It's stunningly beautiful, with plenty of fine detail and a gorgeous range of greyscale. There's some minor damage thorughout, but it's overall a splendid viewing experience. It's almost too good, since the thick makeup on the main characters comes across as a shade overdone.

Neil Brand provides an indefatigable piano score that is highly evocative and fits the action well without annoying mickeymousing. The main theme recurs in variants throught the duration, at times joyous and at others mournful. The miking is rather close on the low end of the piano, which lends itself to some interestingly harsh effects.

A solid pamphlet with additional information is present (though be warned that the synopsis is full of spoilers). The disc also includes a slideshow gallery of stills from the movie. The intertitles are in French and appear to be re-creations. Optional English subtitles are also present.

Fans of silent films and early French cinema should not hesitate. This is a splendid and gorgeous presentation of a little-known picture that deserves to be better known.",1437091200,3,4027,4.973254086181278
8700257,5,B00T4LLI8O,"Until not that long ago, I was totally unfamiliar with Ivan Mosjoukine and this despite the fact that I have been a fan of silent films for many years. I even feature courses on them at the local university but as more silent films are discovered in archives and with new restoration techniques available the list of unknown and/or previously unavailable films keeps growing. Last year I saw and reviewed Flicker Alley's FRENCH MASTERWORKS set which focused on the work of Russian emigres in Paris in the 1920s. This is where I became acquainted with Mosjoukine as he was prominently involved with 3 films in that set.

I have long been a fan of the silent serial especially those of French director Louis Feuillade. His FANTOMAS, JUDEX, and especially LES VAMPIRES set the template for others to follow. These and such German offerings as THE SPIDERS are concerned with master criminals, vast organizations devoted to crime and fearless crime fighters determined to bring them to an end. Pure escapism for a growing cinema audience trying to escape the horrors of World War I. HOUSE OF MYSTERY (1921-23) is different. It takes the structure of the serial and imposes a deeper, more dramatic, and more personal element into the storyline.

On the surface the story borrows heavily from THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. Man is wrongfully accused of crime and unjustly convicted. He is sent to a penal colony where he escapes and is presumed dead. He returns in disguise to bring the true culprit to justice. Director Alexandre Volkoff and star and co-writer Ivan Mosjoukine take this basic plotline and add the serial tropes of multiple disguises, complicated plot developments and an extended chase sequence. The film is also divided into 10 chapters and runs 6 1/2 hours! Of course no one was meant to sit through all 10 chapters at once. It took me 4 days (3 chapters a day and the bonus features last).

Now that I've seen it all, I was very impressed. The cinematography (by 3 cameramen) is stunning. The silhouette wedding recalls the work of Maurice Tourneur. The performances for most of the time are restrained and heartfelt, and the storyline based on a book rather than a magazine or newspaper publication has a lot more depth. The locations are memorable and the actions of the characters believable. Having said all that, I must confess that I enjoyed the serials of Feuillade more than THE HOUSE OF MYSTERY (an inappropriate title). The protracted nature of the serial format seemed at odds with the more restrained aspects of the storyline. It made me want to see the condensed version.

Although Ivan Mosjoukine is clearly the star as he gets to wear a number of disguises and adopt different physical characteristics for each, the film belongs to villain Charles Vanel (WAGES OF FEAR) whose steady underplaying anchors the film and helps to keep it from going too far afield. The supporting character of Rudeberg the amateur photographer as played by Nicolas Koline is also key to the proceedings (his scruffy appearance is unforgettable). The restoration work on HOUSE OF MYSTERY is exemplary. The images look great and Neil Brand's piano score does yeoman work without ever becoming tiresome. The movie is quite remarkable and should be seen by every silent film enthusiast. How often is up to them.",1427673600,17,3311,4.896613190730838
