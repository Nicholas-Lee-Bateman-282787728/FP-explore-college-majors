6161274,5,B00HF98SC6,This is eye opening and learning experience for every christian to know and judge for themselves. I heard there were missing chapters in the bible and this explains it all.,1403136000,2,172,4.766666666666667

6161276,4,B00HF98SC6,I enjoyed this collection of two DVDs.  There were six episodes but I wish there were more.  If you always wondered about some of the mystries in the Bible this is the right purchase.  It is narrated and the investigation are conducted by Bible scholars from major universities.,1402531200,15,278,4.75
6161277,5,B00HF98SC6,"If it doesn't fit, you musta . . Quit.

My former so-called ""faith"" ( a thing handed down from the time of Adam, Eve, Abraham, Noah, Moses, David, Jesus Christ, Constantine, the Spanish colony (could be inhumanely brutal - not something foreign to the Bible's good/kind/noble lead characters including God Himself), The Roman Catholic, priests & nuns, my parents, a collection of fictional and non fictional characters ) had shifted to enlightenment in spite of this production film but because of ""knowledge"", ironically the same fruit that was Forbidden in Paradise. Pre 1998, I've asked my late but beloved mother, ""Since we all know that ""apple"" is just a symbolism of the fruit from the ""Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil"" then the real culprit ( if we're to be literal and set aside figurative biblical moment ) to be precise is simply Knowledge, which can result in both good and evil. The first sin of the first father and first mother reason it was dubbed as Original Sin, whereas in this case my take was/is, since everyone's goal is to be educated in schools or universities for ""knowledge"", Viola! there's no escaping your Original Sin unless you want to be uneducated or poverty prohibits it. In other words, you have to be a ""vegetable"" if you want to stay in the Garden of Eden :p

So where was I? Oh yeah, my conflicting-bible-stories-based faith that had shifted to my own belief-concept based on observations of the planet/universe coupled with my own introspection then later stumbled upon a terminology closest to it aka ""Deism"" is only made perfect because of this elaborate, honest, educated documentary <3 :)

So I bought three <3 <3 <3",1400198400,,1660,4.817543859649123

6161279,5,B00HF98SC6,"This series is really interesting if you're interested in biblical literature. It explains a lot of things that many religious people wouldn't like to hear, but it's amazing how religion can be manipulated. I would totally recommend this if you're interested in going deeper into history in your biblical research!
My professor is Robert Cargill, who was a contributor and producer of this series. I was able to watch all of the episodes when they aired on the History Channel.",1399507200,9,477,4.975

It's very interesting and informative having people who study religion and archeologist ect coming together to discuss different aspects of the bible. Wether you believe or not it's very interesting stuff! It makes perfect sense.

Not only is this a sssmoooooothe hit piece on ALL Jews and Israelis, including ""good"" liberals, but the ""investigations"" are lousy, slanted, piece-meal, and contrived---and I say that as an investigator of 35 years with a license and DOD clearance. Go ahead, buy it---OR, research these topics on your own for the actual Truth; do NOT just take my word for it.

6161324,2,B00HF98SC6,"Very misleading film to the public. It has truth in it, but also lies mixed in with truth that can mislead the non-believer as well as a believer who doesn't know their Bible well, or know God well. For example, it gives accurate information on the different translations of the Bible from the original Scriptures or manuscripts containing man's fingerprint on them, but they mislead others into believing to the extent these errors hold, and use it to discredit the Bible as whole, rather than point out the nature of the error, and how it relates to the core message and teachings of what Scripture teaches. The attempts at discrediting the Bible, they argue that the word for virgin in the original language was actually just a young woman, not implying being a virgin, and use this to discredit Mary being a virgin, but what they fail to address, whetherly ignorantly or willingly, is that the New Testament still teaches that Mary was impregnanted by the Holy Spirit, and her soon to be husband, Joseph, had not known her sexually, even after they were married, the Bible teaches that Joseph still did not know her in a sexual way until after the birth of Jesus, thus Mary being a virgin, giving birth to Jesus, this knowledge is not dependant on the orignal word for virgin, being a young woman, for the rest of the text clearly teaches that she was a virgin. But the DVD passes off this information as if the Bible translations we have today are not credible, because they used the word virgin, instead of young woman. This is a good example of countering the common complaint against the teachings of the Bible, where non believers have blamed Christianity for not using their own minds to think for themselves. Im not saying Christians are perfect, and that we don't fall short in this, but its clear that those watching DVD's like this, need to think for themselves, and not just take everything in at face value. Get to know for yourself, and don't settle for passed down information. I have only seen the first disc to this set, and it has alot of fascinating subjects it talks about, and interesting points. But overall, i think they are biased against Christians and the Bible, having a agenda to discredit it as much as possible. As far as the scholars being Bible scholars, this doesn't necassarily mean that they are representing God or His message. Its pretty clear that these Bible scholars have a heart and drive to mis use Scripture and reflect on them in a way that takes things out of context to what the Bible actually teaches. For someone who is truly Christian, who follows Christ, has tasted and seen who Christ is, and knows their heavenly Father, these Bible scholars clearly show they do not have a heart for God, but for their own secular viewpoints and tastes that are after their own agenda, and not a heart pursuing God's agenda.",1432252800,11,2863,4.660079051383399

6161328,5,B00HF98SC6,"Real Success & Happiness, or Enlightenment & Salvation for Dummies ...Made fun!

Smooth as a smoothie: When you get the knack genuine success and happiness in some ways is effortless once realizing whats of greatest value, for when aspiring to the greatest good for all things people will often naturally want to hire, work with, and even help, thereby benefiting while aiding you in becoming successful. Achieving a livelihood and having taken care of the basics you're ready for the really good stuff!

Similar to Einstein's MC-Squared, simple yet profound: When you comprehend what is of lasting and greater value you become more connected or in sync with all of kindred motivation, somewhat as in physics when electrons are able to instantaneously communicate with each other over vast distances and like attracting like. You therefore begin to resonate and integrate with all thats harmonious (and timelessness), which not only makes you very happy but positively energized from being enhanced and expanded by everything of similar vibration/motivation  Kinda-like hitching a serene luminous wave through the universe ...And you don't have go incognito or wear sun-glasses because its inherently cool, and SEXY  (dont get excited, just kidding). Anyway, beats a hot dog or even a billion bucks any day Or be concerned about being saved by committing to a faith at a later date, or trapped in your car during the rapture without a sun-roof, tell your analyst, join anything, need a middle man ...And No Cover Charges (Yahoo)!

And to think in large part the key to happiness and the big questions could turned out to be so simply (Mmm, seems almost disappointing, too breezy, no drama).

 Well, I started this out as a serious metaphysical discourse, and wound-up with another comedy  - Oh well, maybe next time  - bwk

Humor:  Have you been snuggled lately?

I believe planetary salvation resides in the world becoming more snuggly. People need to begin to be cozy with one another, and start hailing one another with such greetings as; Are you cozy, or have you been cozied while praising the heavens for cozy places to go  - light and easy and warm and breezy and count their snugs at night.

Snugglers of the universe unite!

Just some prophetic cosmic humor to keep in mind through the day and warm at night.

By Expansionists Productions Unlimited (not really, just had a nice ring to it).  ( o ;

Seek and yea shall find, not accept and you will find. It takes an open mind and sincere effort to find truth.
Having studied the commonality of ideals of capitalistic democracy, communism and religion worldwide its disconcerting to find throughout the ages the majority of resources serving extravagance, hierarchy and consolidation of power often achieved and maintained through the exploitation, depredation and ignorance of the common man  - Not to mention the persecutions and ravages caused by related warfare.
Such social entities go great lengths to create the perception of order from chaos, then fill in the discontinuities with canned patriotism, the requirement of faith to obtain eternal life, or worse avoid eternal hell.
It seems many people need structure, ritual, definition  ...an iconic supernatural entity to embellish, plead their cares to, worship And integral reward system to derived security from being destined for eternal life.
Although within all creeds and religions there are exceptional individuals with characteristics and values worthy of emulation, its common to project lesser human qualities unto the character of the divine and worship, cater too and regulate others accordingly while depending on divine intervention instead of taking personal responsibility to create a sustainable world and purifying ones motives while realistically aspire to whatever brings about the greatest possible harmony for all things.
Must we subscribe to exclusive assumptions without reservation and continually seed the beds of worldwide ecological disaster, convolution, divisiveness and strife?
... And why not goodness for its own sake? What could be simpler, more purifying, self-affirming, divine in character ...and to the point!

Religions with by far with the greatest following are those having integral reward systems i.e. those that promise eternal bliss and other incentives for adhering to an assumed supreme doctrine. Though there are those of religious orientation with admirable motives, many delude themselves of having genuine love/devotion, the real fascination and motivation deriving primarily from celebrity like status and power of religious figures and promise of an eternally blissful after-life. Take away the embellishments: Business-as-usual insurance policy.

 Secure in being raptured and eternity bound beliefs based on faith rather than proven fact manifest into serious threats from a third of the world not sharing fully responsibility for critical issues such as over-population, environmental degradation and general long-term planetary sustainability.

 Personally I find the conventional Christian concept of salvation and crucification baffling. Was Christs sacrifice originally divine or necessary could such a love for humanity been demonstrated inspiringly yet in a less harsh, debt laden manner?

Unlike Christ with decisive foreknowledge of knowing where he came from and going Im didn't submit being born into a world of contradiction, confusion, injustice and chaos. I just want the opportunity to be accepted as an imperfect work in progress and live modestly in peace and harmony - Which should be an inherent birth-right for all things ...so is there a logical reason to be beholding or saved?

 If there be a divine entity he would not have the petty traits, egotism, subjugations, and inflexible technical judgments projected onto him by people, but qualities of compassionate commonality.

Regardless of orientation it would seem cultivating an open heart, mind, progressive nature and aspirational focus on whatever brings about the greatest possible harmony to all things without further expectation of reward the more essential integral qualifying, comprehensive, and purifying essence of spirituality and human potential.

Devastating Perfection: Many find reason to question the existence of an all-powerful God with so much suffering having occurred to the innocent throughout the ages. Was Jesus wondrously delusional in a beautiful way? Did his disciples pass on biases or exaggerate to have a personal sense of power, security and everlasting future or many thereafter delete, distort embellish to feel special, superior, exploit otherwise? Bearing in mind faith is just that; faith not fact, leaves one with the premise that if there is some kind of divine order then lifes primary purpose is to learn and evolve to interact harmoniously. Though there can be no doubt for those of progressive inclination living is a great character building, many experiences seem pointless and even cruel still there is hope: For just as its unreasonable to assume the existence of the divine, its also to conclude its non-existence, for as myself, many people around the world regardless of religion or otherwise have had similar miraculous experiences with a common thread with no other possible explanation other than being of divine origin (i.e. see oberf.org). Having exhausted logical explanations, could inexplicable chaos and confusion serve a greater purpose of purification of motive and goodness for its own sake in other words regardless of what the future may hold aspiring to whatever manifests the greatest harmony for all things and therefore our greater and truer salvation as a planet, race and individual?

Antidote for what may be a godless world: If we find transcendent beauty and compassion in ourselves and examples elsewhere then surely in the vastness of the universe are evolved worlds, dimensions and beings of empathy that have manifested such benevolent harmonious qualities sustainably.

Such certainty assures great possibilities here and beyond for beings throughout the cosmos of progressive inclination.",1426291200,2,8113,5.409199048374306
