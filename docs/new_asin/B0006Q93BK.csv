2191768,1,B0006Q93BK,"I love Frasier. I own all of the other seasons currently available on DVD. I received my Season 5 in the mail today, popped the first disc in the DVD player and voila! advertisement, after advertisement, after advertisement...It's disgusting and disappointing, not to mention, extremely inconvenient since I have a small child who I'd prefer did not see ads for MacGiver or whatever show it is, with things blowing up, etc. This is enough to make me consider returning this set and not buying any future releases. PARAMOUNT, If you can hear me, PLEASE: NO MORE ADS ON MY DVDs!!!!!!!!",1118188800,9,583,4.84
2191769,2,B0006Q93BK,"I love dogs, especially Jack Russell Terriors. I sure hope he will continue his TV career. This show is actually kind of boring and pretetious. But I'll give it 2 stars for the dog.",1118188800,,181,4.352941176470588
2191770,4,B0006Q93BK,"Season five is clever, warm, and funny.  I'm so glad it's been released.  My husband I excitedly put in the first disk.  We were forced to sit through a long ad for Happy Days, and the disk is set up so the viewer cannot fast forward or jump to the main menu.  We shrugged and waited.

Following the long ad for Happy Days were ads for Laverne and Shirley, Mork and Mindy, McGyver, Charmed, and if you can believe it . . . The Brady Bunch.  These are not brief missives, and you cannot fast forward. We were stunned and more than a little annoyed.

My advice is to leave the TV off, and put the disk in the DVD player at least ten minutes before you're ready to watch it.",1118102400,68,671,4.076335877862595
2191771,2,B0006Q93BK,"The high points of this fine series have already been covered, now instead of the show, let's talk about the product.  Very big JEERS AND SNEERS as Paramount once again makes us pay money to watch its advertisements.  Be prepared for 5-10 minutes of advertising you can't fast-forward through in order to watch your DVDs.  You can even use the ""title menu"" button. All standard control methods to bypass the advertising have been blocked on the disks.

The show is a first rate 5-star accomplishment.  The product, or rather its company, is turning into a 1-star annoyance with each new disk they put out.  Hence the overall low rating I give this set of DVDs as a product, not as a show.  I paid for a show, not as tricked funding for advertising.",1118102400,14,748,4.578947368421052
2191772,5,B0006Q93BK,"Frasier on DVD is a must-have for any fan of comedy.

HOWEVER,...we DEMAND (politely) Kelsey Grammer and cast RETURN in a NEW SERIES.",1117843200,2,133,4.782608695652174
2191773,5,B0006Q93BK,"Along with Friends and Seinfeld, Kelsey Grammer's Cheers spin-off, Frasier, dominated the prime time television landscape during the 1990's. Grammer plays the role of Dr. Frasier Crane who, fresh off of his divorce from Lilith, moves back to his hometown of Seattle where he lands a gig as a radio psychiatrist. Frasier's father, Marty Crane (John Mahoney), a Seattle cop recently shot in an attempted convenience store robbery is in need of physical therapy. Frasier and his brother Niles (David Hyde Pierce) make an effort to mend their relationship with Marty whose plaid shirts and penchant for sports and beer strikes a dramatic contrast with their wine club, opera house culture. After a little prodding, Marty and his dog Eddie (Moose) move into Frasier's upscale apartment, and Frasier hires Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves), a housekeeper and physical therapist to look after the two cranes.

The entirety of the show takes place in mostly three places - Frasier's radio station where he works with show producer Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin), Frasier's apartment, and the favorite hangout of Niles and Frasier, Caf Nervosa. A witty comedic exploration of the nation's clash of cultures (also illustrated by Frasier's run-ins with sports guy Bob ""Bulldog"" Briscoe), Frasier stands alone as one of the best-written shows in television history. Not a single episode can be considered a dud.

The Frasier (Season 5) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Frasier's Imaginary Friend"" in which Frasier returns to Seattle from Acapulco where he enjoyed a blissful affair with a supermodel zoologist who, for personal reasons, asks him to keep their relationship a secret. But constant near-miss run-ins between Frasier's family and the woman lead them to question whether Frasier is involved in a relationship at all. Exasperated, he spills the beans - an action with profoundly negative consequences... Other notable episodes from Season 5 include ""My Fair Frasier"" in which Frasier finds himself as ""the woman"" in a relationship with a hard-nosed defense attorney, and ""The Ski Lodge"" in which the Crane family, Daphne, and her friend take a weekend trip to a ski lodge where romantic misunderstandings abound...

The DVD Report",1113955200,41,3117,5.229838709677419
2191774,3,B0006Q93BK,"In the 1997-98 season,Frasier's fifth and fourteenth overall,Kelsey Grammer's fans were still hooked on his character. As Frasier's popularity grew,the series drew a new army of fans(those who probably never saw Grammer on the parent show Cheers).",1112659200,,247,5.702702702702703
2191775,5,B0006Q93BK,"This year represented the last year in Frasier's then-unprecedented and still-unequalled five-year Emmy streak for best comedic series. Although it's not quite the equal of its predecessor season, if only because the show never produced a funnier episode than ""Ham Radio"", this season comes darned close with ""The Ski Lodge"", which has the main characters changing scenery to a remote snow-packed location and finding love--just not with the people they wanted. The show's farcical humor is played here superlatively, with great result. The season also brings the final resolution to the Niles-Maris Marriage, in ""The Maris Counselor"", and it is resolved, of course, in the most embarassing way possible. The romantic unluckiness continued with Martin's breakup with Sherry, and the unfortunate exit of Marsha Mason from her Emmy-nominated role. Finally, the season ends with Frasier losing his job to Latino musicians. All in all, this season brought great tribulation to all the characters, but their misery translated into plenty of laughs.

I hope that this time around, Paramount includes at least some special features in the Frasier DVD set. Since I can't get Frasier on TV where I live, I'll probably end up buying it anyway, but I would really appreciate something more. Regardless, Frasier is a comic gem, and its fifth season is great entertainment.",1112400000,69,1360,5.296296296296297

2191807,5,B0006Q93BK,"Fabulous!  What can one say about Frasier.  It keeps getting better, season after season.  This sitcom is a must see for all that love well structured, intelligent comedy.  It never gets old...  New television comedy writers should take note and learn from this show.  From what I've viewed, recently, the ""comedy"" consists of low-brow humor, that is comprised of one topic... How can we make the viewer cringe with our sex jokes.  That gets old quickly...  Frasier, managed to make their jokes; avoid cringe worthy moments; and give the viewer a genuine belly laugh.  This show will pass the test of time... Staying enjoyably funny and relevant.  :)  *This review applies to all seasons*",1486598400,,688,4.947368421052632

2192028,5,B0006Q93BK,"Frasier is one of my main  go to shows for watching TV before bed. I love to watch light happy shows like this one and The Golden Girls (highly recommended I love those old ladies). They are comforting to watch and won't give you nightmares. I prefer to watch the later seasons of Frasier because I do not have the patience to deal with Niles's constant longing/pining over Daphne.
 I would always find myself frustrated at Daphne being so unaware of it and at Niles for never growing a pair and confessing his feelings to her. Come On!!! Just get it on already Niles! lmao. I like the silly stuffy banter between Niles and Frasier. I love their dad Marty and his old chair and who doesn't love his dog Eddie!! I find myself laughing out loud at the goofy situations they all get in to especially Frasier. I'm the biggest corniest Television nerd and I hope you enjoy these fluffy nonsense shows. I feel they help to calm the mind and provide a feeling of normalcy, and a sense that everything will be ok, even when at times it isn't. Hope you enjoyed my informal, casual,  grammatically incorrect review of Frasier.

Sincerely,
Your Corny Television Nerd

Each show leads a small clue as the next show and so on, until the surprise ending.
By the way if you like dogs you will love ""Eddie"", one of the main but unpredictable actors in the show.

In the whole series there are less than five episodes that I find a bit below their standards but the rest are top notch and hard to match. Anyone who loved his character on cheers will love watching the evolution of the character on this series. 11 seasons hardly seem enough. This is my second time buying this set, as the new sets have a single dvd case (hard case) and it fits on my shelf better and is well protected.

2192847,5,B0006Q93BK,"I have watched every season of Frasier at least four or five times over the years. Everyone that contributed to this work were perfectly matched, and complimented one another in so many ways. It is really quite a bigger than life study in human behavior. The brothers, Frasier, and Niles, well educated, very intelligent, but both short changed on that ever important dash of common sense. I pretty much know all the lines, so at this point I zero in on the lesser elements that frame each scene.",1371686400,,496,4.6477272727272725

One is forced to wait until all these seemingly endless previews are shown before the series can be watched. They cannot be fast forwarded.  So every time you want to watch an episode on the first disc, you have to watch all the previews again.  Maybe if more people complained about this and gave bad ratings for this disgusting bit of underhanded marketing, these corporate jack---es would stop doing it.  It's not like we're getting to watch their dvds free.  We pay for these dvds, and these jerks still force us to watch ten minutes of their advertisements so they can try to sell us more.

2192870,5,B0006Q93BK,"Many people rate the first four seasons of Frasier as the show's absolute peak. While it's difficult to argue, I would make a case for the first 7 seasons being extremely special - I mean, genius special. Two of my all-time Frasier episodes appeared in this one, Halloween (try and find a more perfect 25 minutes of tv comedy than this), and The Ski Lodge. Worth buying for those alone.

While seasons 1 and 2 maintained an epic quality standard throughout, I'm only being honest when I say that 2 or 3 episodes here are not quite as good as the rest. But this is nitpicking when the set comprises 24 episodes, and returned annually for 11 seasons - none of this ""taking time off to renew the creative juices"" with them!

For me the most important part of Frasier was the great range of characters, and here there is more development than usual for the likes of Roz. There are also too many fantastic put-downs to quote. Each episode offering at least one gem. For anyone who has seen a few episiodes of Frasier, and wonders whether an entire season is worth buying - I envy you!

This season included some continuity such as Frasier's continuing difficulties with women, Niles' continuing infatuation with Daphne and Frasier and Niles' continuing efforts to be a hit on the Seattle social scene. On the other hand, there were a few new elements such as Roz' pregnancy, Niles' divorce and a couple of episodes in which Martin's relationship with his sons seemed markedly more comfortable. There were a few episodes I found almost uncomfortable to watch, but these were easily balanced by episodes that were very funny and entertaining. I personally found some of the running themes to be getting a bit worn by this season, but the acting continued to be superb and the stories were often creative. If you are a fan of Frasier that has seen the seasons leading up to this one, you won't be disappointed with season 5.",1276300800,2,876,4.885906040268456

As a general comment, I think Seasons 2-5 are consistently better than the seasons that come after.  If you see George Rannie's review on Season 6, I agree with much of what he says, especially after having recently viewed the seasons backwards, from Season 6 to Season 5. The humor of Season 5 and before has a more ""natural"" feel, the setups are more realistic, and the humor, as in previous seasons, is more often subtle and cerebral.  Although I'm not getting rid of my Seasons 6-8-- the quality overall is still good, if you're a Frasier fan-- I'm happiest with everything up to and including Season 5.",1230768000,,718,4.515384615384615

2192901,5,B0006Q93BK,"Series 5 is not my absolute favourite, but it is still very funny and contains some classic episodes.

In 'Halloween', Niles gives a fancy dress party at his posh new apartment, and Roz discovers she is pregnant.  Niles gets the wrong end of the stick and thinks it's Daphen who is pregnant, and proposes to her.  In 'Voyage of the Damned' Frasier goes on a cruise to Alaska as a guest speaker and takes Roz, Niles and Martin with him.  Then it turns out Maris is one of the other passengers, but she thinks Niles is seeing somebody else.  The scene where Frasier, Martina and Roz all end up hiding in Maris's bathroom while Niles is trying to reconcile with her is painfully funny.  In 'Zoo Story' FRasier has dumped his unscrupulous agent Bebe for a nice but hopelessly ineffectual man, and Bebe schemes to get him back (naturally she succeeds).

In 'The Maris Counsellor' Niles thinks he and Maris are going to be reconciled, but gets a rude shock when (as he thinks) he climbs into bed with her.  'The ski Lodge' is played like a classic French farce, with everyone running in and out of each other's bedrooms, and all ending up with the wrong person.  And STILL Dopey Daphne doesn't realise that Niles is crazy about her!  Probably my favourite episode from this series is 'Room Serivce'.  Lilith returns to Seattle devestated because her husband has left her for another man, a contractor who was working on their mastre bedroom. ""It's ironic, isn't it?"" she says to Roz: ""No sooner do I get the closet of my dreams than my husband comes out of it.""  Frasier fears that he may succumb to Lilith's attractions again, but in fact it is Niles who ends up spending the night with her, and the morning after bedroom scene is absolutely hilarious.

There are lows in this series as well as highs, some episodes are too sentimental for my taste, and the obtuseness of Daphen continues to irritate, but overall I would say this DVD is worth every cent.",1167955200,5,1950,4.568965517241379

2192938,5,B0006Q93BK,"No extras.  Fine.  Okay.  There are ELEVEN seasons of this show.  I doubt there are enough bonus materials in the vaults to pile a bunch into each of eleven season sets (assuming they plan on releasing all or most of them), so be patient.  I'm sure we'll get some goodies eventually.

Season Five still has the writing in full comic swing.  The season opens with an episode featuring Sela Ward (hubba hubba!), and if that doesn't get your season started on the right foot then nothing will.

Two of the biggest laughs I've ever gotten watching ""Frasier"" over the years came in Season Five, in particular the episode where Niles sleeps with Lilith (""Room Service"") and the following episode where Frasier's cousin is to marry (""Beware of Greeks"").

In ""Room Service"" the big laugh for me came from a simple line-reading:  the room service waiter says ""Okay"" to Frasier's insistence that he might rekindle his relationship with his ex-wife, while unbeknownst to him (but known to the waiter) Niles is hiding in the bathroom.  The actor nailed the line so beautifully.

In ""Beware of Greeks"", Frasier simply says ""And we're back!"" following a loopy non-sequitor by Daphne.  Grammer nails the line.  Big belly laughs all around!

The episode that always gets discussed in Season Five is ""The Ski Lodge"", a comedy of errors Blake Edwards would be proud to have orchestrated for one of his films.  That episode is very funny, but still takes a back seat to ""The First Date"", the episode where Niles comes closest yet to asking Daphne out on a date.  While it is not quite the same kind of humor that is in ""The Ski Lodge"", the ""First Date"" episode is both funny and tender.  That is a hard line to walk successfully in a 22-minute script.

Late in the season, a pregnant Roz first meets the paternal grandparents of her unborn baby.  The writer of that episode really had a nose for sniffing out the cheap laughs without being mean-spirited.

Don't know when Season Six will arrive, but I'm already ready for it.  Season Six may be the first ""Frasier"" season to NOT win a ""Best Comedy Series"" Emmy award, but I hardly think that qualifies as a failure.

If you are collecting these season sets, or merely considering it, don't pass this one over.",1119657600,18,2240,4.672634271099744

2192940,3,B0006Q93BK,"This is a hard season for me to rate, truly it is. The ""fervor"" of having the boxsets has long since past, and while this season does contain some GREAT epsiodes (The Perfect Guy!) it tends to either undercut the performers, or seems to be in a holding pattern. See Below.

I hadn't seen this season before, or at least very little. When Niles and Lillith were in bed together I was truly aghast! Yes, it's televion, yes it's make-believe but I love these characters and there are boundaries even make believe people should never cross, let alone well educated ones:) Then there is the message sent by Roz letting her college boyfriend off the hook and not wanting to ""upset his life"" by her pregnancy...? Excuse me?? What a terrible message of resposibility or a lack there of.

Then the preganacy never really develops into much when it could have (even in this season), Niles and Daphne are generally in a holding pattern, and the show, while witty just seems to be coasting.

The lack of extras is truely unforgivable also since this cast cannot be THAT busy, seems more a case of Paramount not wanting to PAY THE CAST to sit in.

Another very small nit is the box art. The pictures are terrible! Look at them! Daphnes eyes are closed in one shot and generally they are out of focus or just the wrong shots. And the spine of the box now has another different size pic of Frasier. Three others have Eddie in different poses. They should have had some clear cut way to package these because they just seem to be winging the look of these. Why not have one different actor on each seasons spine area??

Sorry, am I being a royal pain to this beloved show? It's only because I care, really it is. The Ski Lodge and many episodes here are truly up to par, but when I examine this as a purchase and weigh it against other seasons, forgive me if I do not give them ALL 5 stars, that's not the way I operate. Probably the best moment of this season for me was when the cafe has a ""new way"" of taking orders and our poor Niles is at the losing end of his beloved drink.

On the minus side...No cast interviews or special features! How about getting some current interviews from the cast reflecting back on certain episodes, thats one reason that I buy a DVD as well. Also, I have to agree with the other fans of Frasier. Enough of the advertisements!! Six ads before you get to the main menu is overkill. Part of the DVD experience is to watch content without all the advertisements. Just a note, you can skip over these by using the chapter fast-forward button on your remote.

And it was by accident !! I can see how it's annoying to sit through 10 minutes of the same previews.

Note: All Dvd Players/Remotes are a little different.
I have an Emerson Dvd Player.

When you place Disc One in it automatically starts in on the Happy Days Previews. To skip them You NEED to hit the button on your DVD REMOTE CONTROL marked Skip/CH it is denoted by the >>l/^ symbol. I hope you can tell what symbol I mean.

You will have to hit this button 7 times to skip through all 7 ads. The Ads are set up like chapters in a DVD movie. Your DVD will skip them one by one.

Again ... this is NOT the fast forward button denoted by just the >> symbol -- that will not work. Also he MENU button won't work -- because Disc One is NOT set up to skip straight to the main menu during these previews.

~*~*~ Hope this helps *~*~ Just try different buttons on your remote. I've been collecting TV Dvd's for the last 2 years and only just last night realized i could skip these Annoying Types of Previews.

Besides the Ski Lodge .. one GREAT episode to watch for is the Christmas Perspectives Episode (it was so funny). With each passing season the characters become familiar and remain so endearing we want to find out what events will unfold ... ~(especially the Niles & Daphney relationship)  they are SUCH an adorably matched TV couple.

So rarily on TV do we see such Great writing paired with an all star cast with GREAT CHEMISTRY !!  Frasier will go down as one of the shows that stand the test of time !!  Right up their with I love Lucy & The Honeymooners --- 2 shows that have remained popular in DVD Sales over 50 years later !!",1118361600,2,1815,4.174785100286533
2192945,4,B0006Q93BK,"Winner of five straight Emmys for Best Comedy, ""Frasier"" caps off that remarkable run with this collection of 24 shows highlighting the cast at the top of their game.  In my opinion, only the second season tops this one for sheer entertainment.

From the first episode ""Frasier's Imaginary Friend"", everyone is in perfect form, especially Kelsey Grammer as he takes his character to new highs & lows all in one show.

Personal favorites include ""Voyage of the Damned"", where our happy cast gets stuck on a cruise ship.  ""Perspectives on Christmas"" is done in a Rashamon-ish style where Martin, Daphne, Niles, & Roz tell four different versions of what happened to them.  ""Room Service"" features the return of Lilith (a sexy Bebe Neuworth) who beds down with a Crane, just not the one she expecting. ""Bad Dog"" has Bulldog (a never better Dan Butler) becoming a city-wide hero for something he didn't do.

And the ribald ""Frasier Gotta Have It"" in which Frasier & his new girlfriend have only one thing in common, so naturally Frasier has to ruin it.  This episode has one of the best reactions by David Hyde-Pierce when Daphne tells the story about her rooftop trist.

The standout episode is ""Ski Lodge"", a contrived but perfectly executed farce where the cast spends an eventful evening trying to get into each other's pants...well, everyone save Martin and a very dissapointed...well, you'll just have to watch to find out.

My personal favorite is ""Beware of Greeks"", a riotus episode with Frasier going up against his Aunt Zora, played with absolute charm and malevolence by Patty LuPone (who also did the voice of ""Pam"" in the first season episode ""Dinner at Eight"".

Although Roz's pregnancy seemed a bit forced at the time, I think it actually worked out pretty well.  Having said that, it does become tiresome to hear Roz remind us in virtually every episode she's in that's she's expecting.  Also, the bizzare episode ""Sweet Dreams"" leads to the entire KACL gang getting canned in favor of a new format.  This represented a major shift of direction for the show that left myself yearning for the ""good ol days"".

Extras:
Sadly, there are no extras in this set either (as with Season 4), only the very annoying commercials for other DVD sets that appear at the beginning of disc one (you can skip through the commercials using your chapter advance button).

Once again, I am forced to dock one star from my review because of the presentation of the DVD itself.  Why ""Frasier"", the champaign of sitcoms gets the Kentucky Deluxe treatment is beyond me, especially when compared to the Seinfeld DVD sets.

Overall, I highly recommend this collection as one of the most hilarious 24 episodes you'll ever see.  If you're a fan, you gotta buy this today.

Tidbits:

- You probably knew that the episode ""The 1000th Show"" is also the 100th episode of ""Frasier"".  But what's even more interesting is that the stinger, in which Kelsey Grammer sings the ""Tossed Salad & Scrambled Eggs"" theme live on stage is the first time we actually SEE him sing the theme in the show's history.

- ""Beware of Greeks"" features previously unseen members of Frasier's family, particularly Walt, Martin's brother.  However, in the first season episode ""Author Author"", Martin declared that he never had a brother.

- Also featured in ""Beware of Greeks"" is a man with a camcorder named ""Eddie"".  Interestingly enough, Martin's dog ""Eddie"" is not in this episode.

- ""Sweet Dreams"" is the first episode where Kelsey Grammer does NOT sing the theme song ""Tossed Salad & Scrambled Eggs"".  Plus, it's sung in Spanish (appropriately enough) which is again interesting because Frasier is fluent in Spanish.",1118361600,7,3680,4.87459807073955

Im forced to purchase outside region1 Frasier which has English subtitles.

Seinfeld, Friends, Golden Girls, just to mention a few have subtitles......why not Frasier.....disappointing...",1118361600,4,324,5.872340425531915
2192947,5,B0006Q93BK,"A TV rarity, Frasier stands alone as being the only smart comedy. No don't get me wrong, Seinfeld, News radio, Everybody Loves Raymond etc are great, but to the intellectuals and introspective people out there, Frasier is intelligent, rewarding and complementive viewing I've already got seasons one through four, and I'll be getting season 5 soon. They had some really classic epiosdes here. Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde-Pierce are great as the two Psychiatrist brothers with day-to-day dilemmas. The music is sharp and classy, the supporting cast is fantastic, but this is Grammer's show, and single-handedly makes this a winner. To the inward-searching person hiding within everyone, Frasier is the best.",1118275200,,708,5.387387387387387
