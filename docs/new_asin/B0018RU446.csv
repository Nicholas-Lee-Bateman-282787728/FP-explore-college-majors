This movie was as advertised by the seller and arrived quickly and well packed for the journey. This was a good buy and the seller was excellent.",1356220800,,251,4.478260869565218
3418884,3,B0018RU446,"My 20 month old daughter loves Eloise, she has since she was 1. My 4 year old son likes her too. We have 2 other DVDs. This one is ok, but it does get a little boring, or maybe it just goes over her head. I like Eloise as a night time DVD becaus the colors are more muted.",1349827200,,272,3.6271186440677967
3418885,4,B0018RU446,"I bought this for my 4 year old who really enjoyed the first few Eloise movies we saw on Starz.  She loves this.  It doesnt need to be Halloween for her to enjoy this movie.  She watches it over and over again.  One of her favorites.

Could be scary if you have a sensitive child, ghosts are in the story and it is a spooky tale.  My daughter was fine with it and knows its make believe.",1338681600,,387,3.961038961038961
3418886,5,B0018RU446,"My 4.5 year-old has only recently started enjoying the animated show centered on precocious 6-year-old Eloise. In ""Eloise's Rawther Unusual Halloween"",Diamond Jim Johnson, the resident ghost of the Plaza Hotel, returns t haunt the hotel. Eloise sees the ghost, but no one else is inclined to believe her until hotel guests begin to see ghosts themselves. Are the spooks for real or is something else afoot? Eloise, in her signature indomitable and precocious manner, sets out to solve the mystery, providing young viewers with a fun time in the process.

The Eloise stories are great fun for young girls, and my little girl has become a fan. Sometimes caution does need to be exercised when viewing this with younger children as Eloise's manner may come across as almost bratty, though she is mostly just verbally and emotionally advanced for her age and very expressive. On the whole, the DVDs are enjoyable and great fun!",1244678400,2,923,4.9935064935064934
3418887,3,B0018RU446,"This Eloise movie is okay, not nearly as good as Me, Eloise.  The kids still enjoy it, though.",1224201600,,94,4.222222222222222
3418888,4,B0018RU446,"ELOISE'S RAWTHER UNUSUAL HALLOWEEN is a fun feature film-cartoon starring the 6-year-old princess of NYC's Plaza hotel--Eloise.

The movie begins with a legend of ""Diamond Jim Johnson"" whose ghost is said to haunt the Plaza every Halloween. Well the legend comes true and it's up to Eloise and her friends to solve the mystery. Is it a ghost or is it something else that's causing all the strange goings on at the Plaza?

Anyway, I'm not familiar with the Eloise stories but this cartoon was fun to watch...although the drawings reminded me of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beavis-and-Butt-head-The-Mike-Judge-Collection-Vol-1/dp/B000B5XOWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beavis and Butt-head - The Mike Judge Collection, Vol. 1</a>&nbsp;cartoons.

There are plenty of star voices like Lynn Redgrave, Tim Curry, Brad Garrett and Jim Belushi who bring this story to life.

And the DVD provides plenty of ""easter eggs"" (like in the elevator at the main menu you can choose some of the floor numbers for a hidden surprise) and there's a bonus segment called ""plaza pals"" which allows you to find out more about the characters. And there are trailers for other ""Eloise"" DVDs.

The kids should love it and it's great to add to the vault for Halloween classics.",1222646400,2,1300,5.545454545454546

This one (obviously) is the Halloween episode.  The DVDs also have instant play, which is great because I lost the remote control for my daughter's DVD player.
