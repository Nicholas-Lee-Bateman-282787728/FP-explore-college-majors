7928848,4,B000050GC3,"There isn't much I can add to all the other reviews but one: The original 3 DVD's gave you the option to either listen to the English or Japanese soundtracks. Personally I hate the English track but if for some reason you preferred English over Japanese, for the serie as well as the music, then this DVD is not for you.

This blast from the past houses all the music from the Bubble Gum Crisis but only in their original language.  If you never listened to the Japanese tracks on the BGC DVD's before now would be a good time to do so (after putting this disk in your wishlist, believe me: you'll need it later on :-)).",1096848000,3,620,4.245762711864407
7928849,5,B000050GC3,"The final DVD in the original Bubblegum Crisis series presents thirteen music videos based on the series.  Two videos are of live-action concert footage by the main voice actresses of the series, one video (""Say Yes!"") mixes live-action concert footage with animation from the much-loved series, ""Touchdown to Tomorrow"" introduces new animation of the Knight Sabers as a rock group, and the others present excellent music with the best action scenes from the series.  For those who have not seen the original Bubblegum Crisis series, or for those who absolutely love the series, the Hurricane Live videos present a beautiful and inspiring overview of the entire series.
The series, inspired by Blade Runner and itself a tremendous influence on following anime, is full of fast-paced action and incredible music.  This DVD provides anime newcomers with an excellent introduction to the world of anime.",1009152000,2,900,5.27972027972028
