In this hour interview with idiot Charlie Rose (sorry but he constantly steps on Steve and his ""crazy feet"" opening was lame) Steve Martin details much of his beginning in Stand Up and his reasons for exiting that part of his career. This was a promotion for his excellent book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Born-Standing-Up-A-Comic-s-Life/dp/1416553657/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Born Standing Up: A Comic's Life</a>&nbsp;I enjoyed Steve's revealing stories about his life very much and the price tag is excellent!",1348531200,11,809,7.804347826086956
3984188,5,B002T44YUM,"It was very enjoyable and informative but I can't believe he never mentioned the best movie he ever starred in: ""Leap of Faith."" The best movie ever made.",1430956800,,154,4.535714285714286
3984189,5,B002T44YUM,Very enjoyable like having a friend or two over and just sitting back and feeling completly incuded!!,1430092800,,101,5.0
3984190,5,B002T44YUM,"This short movie is a wonderful opportunity to experience Steve Martin away from all his many characters and comedic mania. He comes across as authentic, sincere, a man of deep emotion and sensitivity. I can only presume that he is very comfortable with himself to be as comfortable on stage to reveal who he is.
That said, this movie also shows Charlie Rose to be the ham-fisted, tongue-tied, extraordinarily un-imaginative hack I always suspected he was on his public broadcasting show (I guess, this being shot live, they did not have a chance to edit out his clumsiness). Amazing that he has the reputation as a gifted interviewer.
That said, Rose's inanities allow Martin to show his patient forgiving nature towards others foibles.",1418256000,,737,5.0

3984192,4,B002T44YUM,Skip the first 8 minutes of lead-in junk to get to the actual interview..  Steve was great despite Charlie Rose being pretty much an idiot.  It was interesting to hear him discuss his early career.,1410048000,,197,4.6
3984193,4,B002T44YUM,"A very interesting interview of Steve Martin by Charlie Rose in New York. The interview comes in the wake of Martin's memoirs of his life through his career as a stand-up comedian which culminated with the release of his first film, The Jerk.",1386547200,,242,4.651162790697675
3984194,5,B002T44YUM,"You may already enjoy any or all of the many and various works of Steve Martin.  He has evolved over the years since before everyone met his characters on SNL in the '70s through his many movies, books and plays.  He is a real person - a real fascinating person.  He describes very openly how he came to each of his projects.

I have loved Steve Martin since the SNL days.  Hearing him explain his approach, and departure to and from the projects he has developed makes him human.  I feel like I know him now.",1382918400,4,509,4.25
3984195,5,B002T44YUM,"This is a great video for anyone who has an interest in the multi-talented Steve Martin. He answers questions honestly and clearly. It's definitely not Actors' Studio quality -- Charlie Rose makes numerous mistakes which reflect poor research -- but it's fun to watch Martin's reactions to Rose's errors. Martin avoids slipping into any comedic characters or routines. What you get instead appears to be simple, straight-forward comments from the real man. I only wish the interview was longer!",1382140800,5,494,5.265822784810126

3984197,5,B002T44YUM,"Steve Martin has been one of my very favorites since he came to national attention so many years ago.  His humor is wild, but intelligent, and I just break up every time I see him.  This product is excellent and I am glad to be able to own it.",1354838400,,243,3.938775510204082
