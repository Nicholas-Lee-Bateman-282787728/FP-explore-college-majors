7882461,5,6305019983,"One of the main reasons why I loved every Gordon Liu/Liu Chia-liang movies from Shaw Brothers. The cast which includes Chiang Tao, Fong Ke-an, Lily Li and Liu Chia-yung, this movie was incredibly dynamite.",1419552000,,205,5.0588235294117645
7882462,2,6305019983,"The fighting scenes were fair. The ending seemed to have been cutoff prematurely with no credit roll or anything. It was a budget priced movie so I shouldn't have expected much. Although Tai Seng is the largest distributor, I don't think I'm going to buy another DVD from them again.",1113004800,,283,4.68

Liu Fights his way through Japanese soldiers and makes  his way to Dragon Mountain (maps destination).  On his way he encounters two petty thiefs who follow him in hopes of getting something out of him.  Instead the two men gain respect from the monk and help him find Dragon Mountain.  On the way Liu teaches the two men kung fu and also some lessons on enlightenment.  Before the three men can make it to Dragon Mountain they encounter a couple who has crossed over from china in hopes to get rich helping the japanese.  Both skilled in the martial arts they attempt to halt Liu and his two new found friends.  An amazing fight breaks out with some eye popping kung fu showcased.  Gordon Liu shows off his talents in shaolin kung fu, and his enemies show how two are better then one.  I loved this film, as well as all of Gordon Liu's films, and I believe that this is a must have.",994809600,,1050,4.333333333333333
7882464,3,6305019983,"This Gordon (Shaolin Master Killer) Liu starrer has the look and feel of a low-budget ""earlier"" Gordon Liu film.  The fighting throughout most the film is OK non-memorable Shaolin-style fighting.  The final battle, on the other hand, is special.  Arguably, a long haul for a shorter gain.  The film does boast several fights in which a man and woman (husband/wife?) engage in ""tandem"" fighting, that is, they fight a common foe simultaneously intergrating their moves and blows alternatingly and seamlessly.  While this is nothing truly original, I have never seen a man and women combo fighting so intricately and intensely.  This is NOT Jet Li and Aliya, as in ""Romeo Must Die"", doing little flips and comedic stunts.  This is mesmerizing hard-core kung-fu action --- a REAL ORIGINAL TREAT.  The film also has the distinction of having Gordon Liu fire a small pistol (once) --- (whaaah?)... that's right.  As a Gordon Liu fan and purist, I did in fact cringe.  The film, clearly one of Liu's ""smaller"" films, is still worthwhile for the awesome tandem fights I described and Liu's final fight which is very satisfying.",969408000,,1120,4.973118279569892
7882465,1,6305019983,I only know of one good movie with Gordon Liu which is the Shaolin Master Killer.  Guns and martial arts don't mix and they have both in this movie.,956707200,2,148,4.103448275862069
