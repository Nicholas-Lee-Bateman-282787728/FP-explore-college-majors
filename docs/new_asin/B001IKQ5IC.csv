8311032,4,B001IKQ5IC,"Pretty decent matches overall, an extremely funny shoot by Raven, a funny and touching retirement speech by New Jack, Some really cool ECW alumni, the best wrestlers XPW had to offer/which isn't saying much. A horrible death match between Supreme and Necro Butcher which goes beyond wrestling and is pretty much just hitting one another with bulbs and chairs. Some cool young talent like Luke Hawx and Jack Evans. Out of all the old crappy commentated, horrible video quality, dark, xpw vids I have seen as of late. This one is most def the best of the bunch. It's a more recent reunion show XPW put on minus Rob Black (The Previous Owner of XPW), Thank God. If you liked XPW you will like this, if you like technical wrestling it may be a little too hardcore for your taste, if you like ECW then you should find a decent mid-ground here. But don't expect the excellent of an ECW match, most of the matches are decent albeit slow. It's worth one watch, and is the best XPW has ever put out thus far.",1291420800,2,999,4.434782608695652
8311033,5,B001IKQ5IC,Like the title says don't buy this expecting none stop 5 star matches. But if you enjoy a good fun night of wrestling buy this DVD.,1247961600,,131,4.076923076923077
