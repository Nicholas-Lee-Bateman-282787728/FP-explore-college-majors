8260591,3,B0015YY6SW,"Outsanding cinematography, editing and world-class art direction, in a 2003 film that's an obvious direct inspiration for 2010's Tron: Legacy (Tron's light-bike 'levels' battle, light-gliders battle, and several other scenes). It's certainly a visual treat for science-fiction fans. The sound design is also outstanding, even if the music is occasionally over-strident.  Sadly the tedious heard-it-all-before story (""evil energy company bosses vs. the plebs"", yawn) and very mediocre dialogue drag the film down to Saturday-morning cartoon levels.  I love animation and science-fiction, but don't often watch anime because the stories are so disappointing.  This film is no exception, even if it's not from Japan.  Yet there's plenty of opportunity - when the film sags and slows dreadfully in the middle - for some intelligent dialogue that would deepen the film's intellectual pedigree.  But this opportunity isn't taken, and instead we get clumsy attempts at the portrayal of emotional connections with the cardboard cut-out characters, and 'meaningful' static shots of stillness and skies.  Nothing really develops, either in terms of the characters or the world, once the yawn-inducing initial premise is set up.  Overall, artists will find this worth watching for the art direction only.  Film buffs should stay away.",1302220800,2,1323,5.646464646464646
8260592,3,B0015YY6SW,"First off, this movie is absolutely gorgeous. I was an Animation major in art school, and when this was being made it was all anybody talked about. Visually it does not disappoint. And the story is a pretty good commentary on the environment and the separation between working and wealthy classes around the world. Also, this is the first time it's been in a format you can view it in on standard United States AV equipment.

That said, the English translation is... a bit creative. Two minutes of footage have been cut and dialog has been changed so that the story has a couple significant differences and some mysteries are more or less completely obvious, thereby making the reveal at the end completely pointless.

This is a passable product, but anyone who's wanted to see this for a while should consider getting a region-free DVD player and importing the original DVD with english subtitles.",1233878400,14,898,4.824675324675325
