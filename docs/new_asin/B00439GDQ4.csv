4254309,2,B00439GDQ4,"Why call it 'Funny or Die'? Thats a kiss of death. Actually, 'Kiss of Death' would have been better. FoD is an awful, awful title. I nearly avoided it on the strength of that alone... sounds like desperation. Unfortunately, some of it looks like desperation too. There are sketches on here so bad that they'd look amateurish on Youtube. If you knew the people who'd uploaded them you'd feel embarrassed for them. But, there is some sublime weirdness. The Carpet Brothers is a wonderful Wes Andersonesque 70s pastiche. It doesnt keep the thing afloat by itself but it saves it from sinking like a stone.

The 60's salesman doing the links is pretty good too... but that title... yuch!",1312243200,2,683,4.739495798319328
4254310,2,B00439GDQ4,"Got the DVD after being teased with a few Will Ferrell/John C Reilly clips, and I was disappointed. Like another reviewer said, there are some gems, like Drunk History and some lines in Space Baby (just the fact that Fred Willard did a scene with a baby is value), but for the most part FoD is just inane. (The second star is for these bits.) The gag in the ""Snakes"" bit and ""Sleeping with Celebrities""--where one shot goes on and on for too long--was mastered by Seth McFarlane in Family Guy and FoD just took it and made it painful. I made it through 1 1/2 episodes before I asked myself why am I wasting my time watching this when I could be doing something productive like clipping my toenails or vacuuming my hallway. Maybe it got better later in the DVD but I didn't have the patience. Spend your time more wisely and watch those Family Guy or South Park reruns for the seventh time; you'll get more laughs.",1309392000,6,913,4.376470588235295
4254311,4,B00439GDQ4,"Megan Henry is pretty, funny, and smart.  When she walks across the screen, you can't take your eyes off her.  When she walks across the screen TOPLESS, your whole life flashes before your eyes.  I mean, she is spectacular.  You're in love from that point on, and all you can think about is wanting to have her baby.

I bought the Season One disks for the sole reason of seeing again the skit in Episode 2 about an epic fail in TV censorship.  The sound editor begins letting swear words through and beeping out other words, a naked man in the scene has his entire body pixilated except for his genitals, and the black rectangular box that is supposed to keep a woman's breasts covered can't keep up with her when she moves, thus exposing the most incredible breasts that I, or you, have ever seen.  Yes, I bought the whole thing just for that brief skit, and it was worth every penny.

Only 4 stars because Funny or Die is very often not funny at all.  They will take a funny idea and hammer on it until you begin to feel sorry for it.  Some things are only funny in passing, FOD, for maybe 5 seconds.  After 5 minutes, it's not humor anymore, it's cruel and unusual punishment.",1302048000,2,1179,4.337899543378995
4254312,4,B00439GDQ4,"FOD is hit or miss as the reviews suggest but the hits are home runs.  Drunk History, 1000 Cats, and the Bank Robbery are all gold.  You might want to do a little research before you buy---some people love this and some hate it.",1300665600,3,228,4.159090909090909
4254313,1,B00439GDQ4,"Wow.  Just wow.  This is probably the most unfunny DVD ever.  I love comedy and I love the concept of more off the wall skits, but this just sucks.  Even the scarce few parts that are funny are quickly ruined by bad timing or excessive repetition.  An example would be the two dudes with the ridiculous snakes meeting.  It was funny when they stood there saying ""snakes"" back and forth 5 times, it was all lost when they proceeded to say snakes for 2 more minutes.",1297382400,5,464,4.337209302325581
4254314,5,B00439GDQ4,"I loved the show when it was on HBO and find this compilation excellent. Like a Saturday Night Live show, there are some great sketches, some good ones and some that are not my taste.  The vast majority are laugh out loud funny.  The retro style and host add a near perfect tone.  Steve Tom, who plays the Ed Halligan host character, nails the over-the-hill, politically incorrect, bitter old salesman character providing great satire and insight.  The combination of A-list stars with young, emerging talent works throughout.  I highly recommend this video.",1294272000,11,558,5.021739130434782
4254315,1,B00439GDQ4,"When comedian Will Ferrell created the web site ""Funny or Die"" a few years ago, it sometimes had clever skits or short films. If you didn't like one - or found it not to your liking - you could hit the ""stop"" button on the FoD video player on your PC. But there was no cost.

Ferrell and company decided to take the concept to the next level and created a cable TV series for HBO. The first season had 12 episodes. Now the ""Complete First Season"" is on DVD. I never watched the TV show, so this was my first exposure to it. I had great hopes but was sorely disappointed. Each of the `approximately 230 minute"" episodes begins with an announcer who introduces the show. It looks like something from the early days of ""The Groove Tube"" or ""The Kentucky Fried Movie"", a comedy film of short skits which preceded Saturday Night Live in the 1960s. Those were ground breaking films and - while they tried to ""push the buttons"", they were in unchartered territory. Now satirical skits are everywhere. We have SNL, In Living Color, Mad TV and more.

I found very few of these skits funny and some of them repeat themselves (""Playground Politics"", ""Casual Sex"" and - if those concepts weren't funny the first time, they wren't the second time either.

If you are into ""shock"" comedy (visuals or language) you MIGHT enjoy some of these. Look for a few samples on the FoD page. But this is the first HBO DVD I watched in 2010 that I found boring and useless (they released some classics in 2010.). Humor is personal taste. This one just didn't make it for me.

4254743,3,B00439GDQ4,"This is NOT your straight-forward comedy.  It is very raunchy and offensive.  If you can get beyond all that, it is somewhat entertaining.

What's best about this program, it is in separate segments.  If you see something you don't like, wait until the next segment and you will experience something totally different!

This is slapstick at its best.  If you like to laugh at the bizarre, this show is for you.

My favorite segment is ""Space Baby.""  Imagine interplanetary chaos which can only be corrected by a baby.  Space baby can take on the most horrific of space aliens by flying through the air and landing on the alien who struggles only to be taken down.  Sounds stupid I know, but watching is is hilarious!  How the adult actors that communicate with Space Baby do it with a straight face is beyond me.  And the cinematographers that patiently work with the baby to get the right movements from him are geniuses!

On the downside, the segment called  ""Sleeping With Celebrities,"" is funny the first time.  After that it's stupid and a waste of time.  And to the writers of this segment, we get it...celebrities sleeping...now move on to something else.

So if your in the mood for the bizarre and not easily offended, check out this campy show!",1438992000,,1254,4.678899082568807
