2649187,5,B000I0QLFK,"Again, I'm in love with Naruto, so I'm a little bias.  However let me say that there is not a real boundary between this season, the previous one and the next one.  Actually you just know that you are in a different season because the opening and closing changes.  The story is rolled over, on this one the main event is the chunin exam (the first two sections of the exam).",1416441600,,374,4.23943661971831

2649195,5,B000I0QLFK,"Naruto is a fantastic mix of very deep issues with the silliest, goofiest sense of humor. We're still on season 3 and I can definitely recommend 1 and 2. My daughter will be 8 years old in November and so far the show isn't too violent or ""sexy"" for her (we monitor her t.v. watching very carefully).

2649216,5,B000I0QLFK,"I am in my 40's and I am watching the series with my 10 year old. We are having a blast! Naruto has a never say die attitude that is infectious. A little violent but only enough to keep the drama and suspense relevant. We have had the ""it's only a cartoon"" conversation. It seems that to be a ninja one must abandon the inner monologue! Ha! and there is a lot of flashback that can be monotonous when binge watching a series. It seems that is common technique among anime series. I think it helps them put out more episodes without having to create completely new animation (uneducated guess).",1409616000,2,593,4.4

2649224,5,B000I0QLFK,"If your a fan of Naruto then this is where you should start collecting! This particular box set contains an episode storyboard booklet(assuming your buying it new). Its a cool little thing for a hard core fan but in reality not necessary to enjoy the awesomeness that Naruto is! And for anyone reading this, you should know upon writing this their is currently a newly updated box set release of the series ""Naruto"" that are far less volumes and much more episodes per box set. So its most likely far cheaper to buy the new box sets, as these original releases(like the one your currently viewing) are no longer in creation.",1408406400,,624,4.63063063063063

2649246,4,B000I0QLFK,Naruto is fun anime. It was suggested to me by several friends and I generally really like ninja type action. This anime is geared for younger fans and it did not always hold my attention as much as say Afro Samurai or some of the other more serious minded anime features and series that I have watched.,1404259200,,303,4.333333333333333

Too bad, I think the plot would fit a younger audiance if not for the adult content and excessive violant show.",1402617600,,253,4.75

2649271,3,B000I0QLFK,"This is a three-disc DVD set that contains episodes fourteen through twenty-five of Naruto.  The first two discs contain four episodes, while the third disc contains four episodes and the special features.  The first disc is a little tedious to watch, because the fight that is taking place in these episodes is stretched out by a ridiculous amount.  The second and third discs are a more enjoyable viewing experience.

The extras are rather similar to what appeared on the first DVD box set.  There is ""Production Art"" (nine pages of model sketches of some of the Naruto characters), ""From Sketch to Screen"" (eight pages of storyboards for episode twenty-two; you can also choose to see the clip that the storyboard is for), the English credits, a sneak preview for the third Naruto uncut box set, and trailers and promos for Shonen Jump products.

Like the first box, I was rather disappointed in the special features.  While I knew to expect it after seeing similar extras on the first box, I was still a little disappointed.

If you're a Naruto fan and want to collect the episodes on DVD, then this would be a good addition to your DVD library.",1220400000,3,1149,4.738693467336684
2649272,4,B000I0QLFK,"Viz continues with its stellar box sets for Naruto.  The box sets are attractively priced and come with three discs, which effectively makes up season 2 of the series.  These discs finish up the Land of Waves arc and starts the defining arc of the Naruto series, the Chunnin Exam arc.  While memorable characters like Zabuza and Haku make their permanent exits from the series, you get your first looks at the gennin/beginner ninja of other Hidden Villages, including the unforgettable Gaara.  The action and story on these discs is mid tier as some aspects of the Land of Waves fight dragged on for too long, even if it did have a very grand and exciting conclusion.  And much of the beginning of the Chunnin exam is very introductory and full of teasers for things to come.  Overall, box set is a very good one with a good amount of extras and episodes for a very fair price, and I can't imagine the Naruto series getting better treatment than it is getting for these Uncut releases.  A definite buy in my opinion.",1216512000,4,1016,4.549450549450549

2649274,5,B000I0QLFK,"I am a big fan of anime, Naruto is by far may favorite, followed by Bleach. The Naruto uncut is not much different than the ones they show on TV, but of course there is more blood, and some words are substituted. The English dubbed is very good, but the option to have the Japanese with sub-titles is a great, if you don't mind reading. I have seen most of the Naruto Shippuden also and I don't mind reading the sub-titles. My main problem with the Naruto Uncut DVD is the recap, why on earth would you need a recap on ""DVD"" most likely you are going to watch the next episode right away. If they eliminated the recap and the intro song on every episode, they could probably add at least two or three more episodes. I also have a problem with the price compared to how many episodes come in the set. With a price tag of $40+ you should get more for your money. But it is not to much to just pay it and continue to watch this great story full of memorable characters. Every anime fan should own these DVDs.",1204156800,,1005,4.158974358974359
2649275,5,B000I0QLFK,"I bought this dvd set for my 12 year old daughter who is a walking Naruto Wikipedia.  She LOVED it.  I had also, previously, bought her the volume 1 set.  She can't get enough,... after homework, (talk about incentive!)",1200355200,,219,4.564102564102564
2649276,5,B000I0QLFK,Now this box set includes the episode which got me hooked on the series.  It starts developing more drama between characters and the complex friendship between Naruto and Sasuke.  If you've got the first box set then don't hesitate to buy this one now!,1199664000,,252,4.704545454545454
2649277,5,B000I0QLFK,"Volume Two of Naruto is what, in my oppinion, made the show a masterpiece. The character deatil shown here is some of the most enthralling in any anime. This volume contains the end of the Zabuza arc and the start of the Chunin Exams arc. And let me say, what a way to end Naruto's first arc. It had me in tears. One of the most touching scenes I've ever seen in an anime. If you liked Volume One, you'll LOVE Volume Two... and believe me, you'll be itching for more.",1199318400,10,467,4.142857142857143
2649278,5,B000I0QLFK,"By and all that are fans or are looking to get into some other anime.  Naruto vol. 2 works for you.  It has 12 episodes on three discs and i will say once you start watching.  You'll want to keep it on through the rest of them.  It's addictive to watch and a pretty decent storyline.  It also has all the stuff that the American version doesn't have with more blood and the opening credits in Japanese instead of American which just works better and its a reasonable price.

So check out volume 2 uncut of Naruto i doubt you'll go away disappointed with this purchase.",1195862400,,568,4.311320754716981
2649279,5,B000I0QLFK,"Okay.  As great as the first one, and starts right where box one left off.  Great sound, picture.  Has english option and japanese option, with english subtitiles.  There are 12 episodes in this box set.  Has special features, but the only thing I was really interested in was the advertisement for the next box set (I really like theatrical trailers, don't ask me why, I don't know).

I loved the graphics on the box.  They were wonderful.  There is also a storyboard booklet onver episode 15.  Once again, there are over 250 episodes the way it is, not that I've seent hem al, only 103 have aired in U.S. as of 9-11-07, sad face-again, so try to catch them why they are on sale.  I bought box set 1-5 over labor day weekend, and spent around 170.00 getting them all-so sales are GOOD.  Costs a lot less that way and there are going to be tons of boxes.  And that's even if they don't do anymore than the 250 episodes they already have.",1189468800,,1452,4.507692307692308

2649281,5,B000I0QLFK,"Naruto has great music, terrific graphics, fascinating characters, interesting plots, and educational stories. Even the minor characters and villains are sympathetic and multi-dimensional. My seven year old sons and their seventy year old grandfather watch it every afternoon. Getting the boxed set allows me to watch the shows with the boys any time we wish. The six CD set is great and we are on our second viewing.",1178928000,,417,5.147058823529412
2649282,5,B000I0QLFK,"Naruto Uncut Boxed Set Volume 2 is one of the best DVD purchases I've made. The series teaches a lot of life lessons for children and adults and the substance of the program is much more than you would initially expect. It teaches one to never give in even when the odds are against you- a very good life lesson. Naruto is one of the best anime series' ever created besides Dragon Ball Z which is my all time favorite. It has great character depth & quality, awesome animation and epic storylines, battles and dialogue. But this judgment cannot be reached by just veiwing these first two DVD sets. Watch the series for yourself and you will quickly become a beleiver...BELEIVE IT!!!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Naruto-Uncut-Boxed-Set-Volume-2/dp/B000I0QLFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Naruto Uncut Boxed Set, Volume 2</a>",1176940800,8,861,5.630769230769231
