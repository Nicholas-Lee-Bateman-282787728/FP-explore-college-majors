7948696,1,B00005OCOP,"I watched this ""documentary"" on the History Channel, yesterday.  It certainly is a unique take on street gangs.  The position of the filmmaker appears to be that organizations such as the Vice Lords, Crips, and Bloods are that they are just community organizers forced to do illegal things because of racism and the inequities of capitalism. As an example, he highlights the fact that the Vice Lords ""cleaned up"" the Lawndale neighborhood in Chicago during the period when they formed a community outreach program and that The Man in the form of Mayor Daly didn't understand them and feared them.  Do some research.  The CVL used some money to build a few playgrounds and set up a couple storefronts.  They then used these facilities for gang business.  The fact that while this was going on the CVL was consolidating its power by taking over other gangs and flooding the streets with drugs is strangely left out of the narrative.",1440288000,,930,4.817610062893082
7948697,5,B00005OCOP,"This documentary is a well-crafted and engaging History Channel documentary about the origins of street gangs in America. The implied thesis in ""A Secret History"" is that gang activity in the United States arose during the 1800's largely as a function of immigrant groups' need to protect themselves. While this statement may seem somewhat ethnocentric, the creators of this documentary have done thier homework and present a convincing argument as a foundation to thier claims.

 While the documentary may at first seem of little interest to those who are interested in learning about the lingo and lifestyles of today's inner-city gangs, there is still an important educational point to be made. This is that the gangs of today may have changed in thier appearance, but the functions of the street gang are basically the same: 1) to provide economic opportunities to the disempowered and 2) to provide protection for the disempowerered.

 The film is richly-laden with the history of two ethnic groups in particular. First, ""Secret History"" provides a well documented account of the early Irish-American immigrants who settled in the 5-points area of New York. Second, the movie contains a wonderful account of the Mexican-American gangs of California, including detailed accounts of the 1940's ""Zoot Suit"" riots.

 5 stars for pure educational value.",1090454400,8,1353,5.299065420560748
