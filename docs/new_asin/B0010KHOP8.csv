8237972,5,B0010KHOP8,Wonderful and exciting and very helpful for bringing back fond memories of Latin America.  Nice trip down the third world  as it was when it was still somewhat tame.,1398211200,,165,4.655172413793103

8237974,1,B0010KHOP8,Colombia is famous for its violence. but it is just like saying Americans are white. this video does not show a reality but just an stereotype of what people ( who have never visited) think about this country. it is a pity how a video can be manipulated.,1251331200,,254,4.3125
8237975,2,B0010KHOP8,"I thought the Panama/Colombia Globetrekker DVD was interesting but not a good reflection of Colombia.  My wife who is from Colombia thought it offered a slanted view of Bogota as a dangerous, militant city.  Instead of showing the more cosmopolitan aspects of the city it was portrayed as dangerous and poor.  The visit to the cocaine farm seemed strange since it's illegal.  Also the lost city visit and the interview with the sipritual guru who chews coca leaves all day plaued in to the stereotype.  Interesting to watch but not up to GT's high standards.",1231200000,7,558,4.831578947368421
