149367,4,0792843800,"Children will undoubtedly love this confection as I did. As an adult, if you watch this film as a fantasia of the great Dane's life it is bearable; otherwise the going gets pretty sticky. The ballerina originally was to be played by the eloquent Moira Shearer, but she was pregnant and therefore unavailable; the part went to the rather lacklustre Zizi Jeanmaire. The scene near the beginning where Hans is telling the kids stories looks amateurish in the kid's reactions. The picture was Goldwyn's GREATEST moneymaker and there are wonderfully hummable tunes such as ""No Two People"" ""Thumblina"" ""Wonderful Copenhagen"" and the sad ""Inch Worm"" Young children should love this sugar-coated confection which bears little reference to the real Andersen (probably just as well as he was notoriously morose). The Danish people weren't too thrilled as a whole with this film when they saw it and most thought it was insulting to their national hero.",944006400,2,942,5.083870967741936
149446,5,0792843800,"When I first went to Denmark in 1988 that I was staying at the city in where the story is base on the famous writer - Odense, FYN Denmark as I was told the real story of Hans C Andersen, as yes he did come from Odense but his father was the shoe clobber, his birth house stills stands in Odense, and his other house in which it is a museum, and library. Both places are the treasures of Denmark, and he was right when he said To Travel is to Live, as Copenhagen is also a place to go, and experience when he was there. as for the film again Danny Kaye in using his talents with children, and also he was rightly chosen for this role, I recommended in watching this film.",1519776000,,670,4.007462686567164

I thought it was a really good deal and, when I heard the songs, I was back in my childhood, singing duets with my father.  Compared to all the zip-bam-boom of today's children's fare, this is a quiet, lovely movie to share with our grandchildren.",1515628800,,404,4.36

I give it 4 stars because I gladly skipped past his long ballet sequence which takes up maybe almost 1/5 of the film. But delightful in every way otherwise. Danny Kaye is a gem especially in this...Think I'll buy it for the best videos to lift me out of a funk library. . .",1496966400,2,418,4.109756097560975

I watched it with my family immediately upon receiving the DVD and was treated, not only to an amazing story and music, but the memories associated with it from my childhood!  Danny Kaye's genius is in full-force with the movie, moving from the romantic to the silly to the sad and back again seamlessly.

149597,4,0792843800,"A wonderful movie that my wife and I hadn't seen in over 50 years.  Be aware that it's not entirely a kids movie.  Although parts of it clearly are terrific for kids, the plot has a romance that's prominent.  Also, there's quite a bit of ballet, including a 20 minute ballet scene.  All very beautiful, but not something that will necessarily hold a 5 year old's attention.",1485043200,2,373,4.522388059701493

149679,4,0792843800,I don't own the DVD so I can't speak to the quality of the copy on the disc.  The movie it self is one of my favorite Danny Kaye moves.  Mr. Kaye is one of the actors that I felt never got the attention he deserved as an actor.  I love the way the movie incorporated the creation of the Anderson stories we all know into the life of a sort of regular guy who was a little goofy.  I don't think I have ever seen a Danny Kaye movie I didn't enjoy at least a little and this one is in the top of my favorite list.  This is a movie you will not regret seeing.,1477872000,,555,3.7094017094017095
149680,3,0792843800,I forgot about the story.  I saw it when I was a little kid. It's a love story gone bad. Not a well written script. Not Danny Kaye best movies.,1477785600,,143,3.7666666666666666

149709,1,0792843800,This movie had great intentions but it lost its way.  It tried to combine to many plot lines and ended up making a sweet story teller man into a psychotic obsessed man who comes across as desperate.  He has serious anger issues.  I watches with my kids and had to turn it off it got so bad.  Bad message overall.,1468022400,,312,4.15
149710,5,0792843800,"I loved it as a child!  I bought it to share with my grand kids.  They LOVE His stories.  There are some movies that are timeless.  They never grow old.  My Grandkids know more of his stories than I did as a child.  I rank Hans Christian Andersen with Dr. Suess  they both have a remarkable genius for telling a great story that teaches a lesson.  I plan to give each family their own movie and their own volume of Hans Christian Andersen's  collected stories.  Not everything needs to be new or high tech, sometimes traditional is too good to pass up.",1467072000,2,552,4.323529411764706
149711,5,0792843800,"Danny Kaye is probably my favorite actor.  This is one of those films that shows why.  Between his singing and the story, this is anot underrated gem.

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

To my surprise and shock the main character falls for a married woman, who of course rejects him and sets him straight about her marriage, but there is also domestic violence where the woman and husband yell, argues, belittle and even slap each other.  It's too bad that part ruins the stories of Hans and how he becomes famous.  I had to discuss and explain to my children about adultery and domestic violence in marriage at such an early age for my 10 and 11 year olds that just wasn't necessary when you're trying to have a good family movie time, but this part left them a bit wondering and traumatized. Your young children might be able to ignore that part, but I will tell you it is pretty blatant.",1454889600,,893,4.272189349112426

The movie showcases Danny Kaye's more serious side with less of his trademarked ""patter"" and slapstick.  It does let us hear more of his singing voice, which is wonderful.  Children might find this a bit slow during the ballet scenes but on the whole a wonderful movie.",1447027200,4,358,4.461538461538462

It is great discussion topic for how movies with sets and designs and artistic abilities use to make the movies versus computer graphics. Both are great assets to producing great movies.
Also, this movie is filled with the messages of bullying(the school master demanding the town to choose), expressing yourself and finding a way to fit with Hans, finding solutions to problems, solving misunderstandings, sacrificing for others(Peter is suffers a lot to protect Hans), and fortitude(Peter is Hans apprentice versus the option of being an orphan).",1430265600,4,689,5.160714285714286

Andrews Blu-ray Review: In 1952 producer Samuel Goldwyn presented the world with Hans Christian Andersen, a lavish musical biography of the Danish storyteller which wove together details from the writer's life and his beloved fables through the use of songs and musical interludes. Starring Danny Kaye, the film was a fourteen year old project for Goldwyn, who described it as ""a long labour of love, because if ever I loved anything in my entire career, this has been it.""

Hans Christian Anderson was a beloved author of children's tales. In his life, he had many opportunities and benefactors. His stories were immensely popular, and he was even courted by royalty. 'Hans Christian Anderson', the 1952 film starring Danny Kaye, has nothing to do with any of that. In fact, the film opens with a disclaimer that it is not a telling of the man's life, but a fairy tale dedicated to the creator of so many classic fairy tales of his own.

Danny Kaye of the delightful film 'The Court Jester' [1956] [which I wish they would release on the Blu-ray format, as it would be a massive big seller] plays the title role, transformed into a small town Danish cobbler. He tells fanciful tales to the town children, often with a strong moral component. However, his story time conflicts with the kids' schooling. Eventually both the schoolmaster and a group of concerned parents decide that Hans should be kicked out of town. Overhearing the decision, Hans' apprentice, Peter [Joseph Walsh], convinces Hans to leave for Copenhagen that night and pursue his dreams in the nation's capital. While there, a prominent ballet company requests Hans' skills as a cobbler. Going to deliver the ballet shoes, he falls head over heels for the head ballerina, Doro [Zizi ""Renee"" Jeanmaire]. In the throes of love, he pens perhaps his most famous tale, ""The Little Mermaid.""

The name of the game for 'Hans Christian Anderson' is total charm. The Technicolor film is mainly light and cheery, and Danny Kaye appears so effortlessly charming that you can't help but fall instantly in love with the whole production. It's so loveable that when the Danish government filed an official complaint against the film for not being shot in Denmark or featuring Danish actors, producer Samuel Goldwyn invited a representative of the Danish government to view the film. After seeing it once, the complaint was withdrawn.

The beautiful film is buoyed by a set of original songs by Frank Loesser, composer for 'Guys and Dolls.' Unlike most musicals, the songs for 'Hans Christian Anderson' are quite enjoyable and memorable, with strong melodies that don't sound like typical Broadway fare. In fact, the musical numbers are some of the most underrated of the period, coming across as more understated than was typical for the time. The film doesn't stop with songs, also including an extended ballet drawing from Anderson's story of ""The Little Mermaid,"" set to music by Franz Liszt. The movie was shot in Technicolor, so the whole thing looks vibrant and rich, but the production design and colour scheme hit great heights during the ballet.

The script does a brilliant fantastic job of evoking the sense of wonder and merriment that Anderson's stories always possessed. In fact, by framing the story as a fairy tale instead of a literal biopic, the film gets away with a wide-eyed optimism that might seem hopelessly nave today. Danny Kaye's broad performance similarly works within this context, but might seem terribly dated if the picture had been done straight.

The earnestness extends to the rest of the cast, especially Joseph Walsh as Peter. Acting as Hans Christian Anderson's anchor to reality and loyal confidante, Joseph Walsh does a good job of wearing his heart on his sleeve. Farley Granger, fresh off of the Alfred Hitchcock 'Strangers On A Train,' plays the ballet director in a role that is relatively thankless. At the time of its release, 'Hans Christian Anderson' was an international hit, garnering loads of Academy Award nominations. In time, its star has faded compared to other musicals of the period, but that makes it ripe for rediscovery. The film is a minor gem, but a gem nonetheless, and worth catching if it should cross your path.

Even before its release, Denmark protested against the film, decrying it as an unfair treatment of their national hero. Goldwyn promptly sent Kaye overseas to effectively allay their concerns. The ploy worked according to the A. Scott Berg book, Goldwyn: A Biography: ""Danny Kaye visited Denmark in July 1952. From the airport he went straight to the statue of Andersen in one of Copenhagens central parks, to lay flowers. More than fifty policemen were needed to escort him through the throngs who awaited him at the memorial. He climbed the statue and embraced Andersen, then had to be carried on a policeman's shoulders past the thousands of fans."" With the Danish public mollified, the production was cleared for take-off and upon its release, Hans Christian Andersen earned $6 million dollars and scored 6 OSCAR nominations for the score, costumes, art direction, sound, cinematography, and song. Although returning empty-handed from the Academy Awards and Samuel Goldwyn was nonetheless delighted with his film's box office success, declaring, ""It all proves to me that this business of ours is still a great and healthy one. If you make your pictures for the whole family, the whole family will make a bee-line for the theatre.""

Blu-ray Video Quality  'Hans Christian Anderson' is presented in this beautiful encoded 1080p transfer and also its original aspect ratio of 1.37:1. The first thing that will impress you about the image is the Technicolor palette, which is bold and vibrant. In the opening scene, where Hans is talking to children near a bridge, the blue of the river and the greens of the grass pop off the screen. Flesh tones are very warm, sometimes veering toward red. The biggest problem I could see comes from the three-strip process Technicolor employed. When employed perfectly, it looks gorgeous. But here I noticed slight colouring errors around the edges of things, such as the hems of clothing or around the iris of people's eyes. Additionally, these errors contribute to a level of softness that one wouldn't expect for a three-strip Technicolor image. Despite these problems, this is clearly a high-definition image. The extended ballet sequence looks particularly gorgeous. There's a very attractive layer of film grain that gives the transfer a very authentic filmic look and to me this is just first rate.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  'Hans Christian Anderson' only comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio Mono track. For films like these, sometimes the original mixes are best, and I found that the film sounded really good. The gorgeous music gets especially a really good treatment. Balance is reasonable, with the music and voices taking centre stage. I didn't detect any hissing or distortion, making for a clean and smooth track. Imaging was necessarily limited and obviously the surrounds got no use at all. It's not a lot, but it's all the film needs. But with the modern technology around today, I am sure they could of given the soundtrack a makeover of a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, like they have been able to turn 2D films into 3D Blu-ray discs and some Mono films into Stereo, especially with a classic Hollywood film like this, still despite this aspect, it is still a good effort.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Theatrical Trailer [1952] [480i] [4:3] [2:43] When was the last time you heard a producer's name mentioned so many times in a film trailer's voiceover?

BONUS: Limited Edition DigiBook: Warner Home Video has packaged Hans Christian Andersen in a very attractive beautiful illustrated Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook with production photos, lobby cards, one sheets and drawings. The text provides an overview of the production's lengthy development, as well as biographies of Samuel Goldwyn, Danny Kaye, Rene ""Zizi"" Jeanmaire, Farley Granger, Roland Petit, Frank Loesser, Moss Hart, Charles Vidor and Hans Christian Andersen.

Finally, 'Hans Christian Anderson' is a minor gem with a winning performance by Danny Kaye and some very memorable songs by Frank Loesser. The image is vibrant but does have a few flaws. The audio, while only Mono, still sounds excellent, but with todays modern technology available I would have thought they could have expanded the sound element of this beautiful Blu-ray disc, despite this, it certainly highlights the excellent score. While the film does come in a beautiful DigiBook packaging, it is a shame they could not have expanded the special features, as I sure there must be some hidden behind the scene gems in the vaults of Warner Bros., like interviews with the actors and especially outtakes? Despite this 'Hans Christian Anderson' is well worth seeing, especially the magic touch that the director Charles Vidor brought to the screen, and because I am a massive fan of Danny Kaye, this beautiful Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook and an even more the beautiful film, it has gone pride of place in my ever increasing Limited Edition DigiBook Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

Although this isn't a real biography, as the movie states, its a fairy tale about the character of HCA. But, as that, it is a beautifully written, wonderful musical. The ballet sequences are great and although they slow the story down for kids that are conditioned to the fast pacing of modern family entertainment, they represent a wonderful introduction to the art of dance as story telling.

Danny Kaye is a classic performer who deserves to be re-discovered by this generation.",1401840000,2,615,4.80188679245283

Of course, I had to watch it before sending it on to its new home, so there is lots of singing going on, both here and at their house now.  Danny Kaye always delights, and the fairy tale aspect of this movie may seem a bit dated, but there is something very enduring and endearing about Kaye's and Anderson's connection to his young audience, including my ""grands.""",1400716800,3,553,4.411764705882353

The background story is just so so but the musical numbers - mainly the childrens' story songs were and are still magnificent.  I learned them from this movie when I was young and sang them to my children who are now interested in singing them to their children.  Danny Kaye has an instinctive way with children in this delightful musical, which is just a heart warmer.

150398,2,0792843800,This review is strictly about the transition Blu-Ray.  The movie itself is a 5 star classic starring the wonderful Danny Kaye.  I am extremely disappointed in this Blu-Ray release.  The video itself although it stats widescreen is not.  I had to use the stretch feature on my set to watch this.  The audio is what kills me.  It's a musical and they could not remix the audio to a 5.1 or 7.1 standard?!  Be prepared for a lousy 2.1 audio that you have to crank up to hear.  The only good thing about this release is the booklet/cover that gives you some movie making notes. Samuel Goldwyn Studios dropped the ball on this one.,1377388800,5,625,4.421052631578948

As for the blu ray release, it offers a slight upgrade over the dvd. It's not a crisp HD transfer as some other films offer although you can notice a slight improvement in the colors. The sound is average.

There are no extras or ""making of"" features other than the theatrical trailer. The blu ray case is a short booklet of pictures and brief articles on the film.

With that said, the original dvd had been hard to come by for years and so this blu ray is a welcome release. I would recommend purchasing it over the dvd for the slight upgrade in quality but don't expect an amazingly crisp HD picture. It might be worth waiting for it to drop below $20 for a better deal.",1356048000,12,780,4.221476510067114
150439,4,0792843800,"""Hans Christian Andersen"" is an elaborate musical biography of the 19th-century Danish children's writer, as portrayed by Danny Kaye.  The film is unusual in the annals of movie musicals.  The focus is inconsistent.  Some sections clearly appeal to children, with Kaye charming as he interacts with assorted little ones, but because the movie romanticizes the life of Andersen, other sections are geared more to adults, particularly several ballet sequences.

The son of a poor cobbler, Andersen failed as an actor and didn't find success until he moved to Copenhagen and won the patronage of the king with his poetry and stories. The Moss Hart screenplay and Kaye's interpretation portray Andersen as a far more agreeable chap than he was. He wasn't a happy man and never married, though he did develop an affection for opera soprano diva Jenny Lind. In the film, Andersen is fascinated not with the singer, but a ballet dancer (Zizi Jeanmaire).

Composer-lyricist Frank Loesser had scored a triumph on Broadway two years earlier with ""Guys and Dolls,"" and his songs here are charming.  There are several delightful children's songs based on Andersen stories -- ""The Ugly Duckling,"" ""The King's New Clothes,"" and ""Thumbelina.""  There are also a rousing anthem by Andersen as he sets out for Denmark's capital, ""Wonderful Copenhagen,""  the love duet ""No Two People,"" and the soulful ballad ""Anywhere I Wander.""

If you think of this film as a musical fantasy rather than as authentic biography, you will thoroughly enjoy it.  Danny Kaye is wonderful as the writer and balances humor with poignance and even lovesickness.  It's hard to imagine anyone else in the part.  Sadly, younger folks are not familiar with Kaye's movies these days.  ""Hans Christian Andersen"" is a terrific introduction to Kaye. The new Blu-ray edition comes with a 40-page book containing photos, production history, cast biographies, and other behind-the-scenes details.",1355961600,,1944,5.232258064516129

150447,3,0792843800,"I was five years old when this movie was new, and I think my parents must have taken me to it in the theater, because it's one of the few I remember in color, and we never had a color TV. But I missed the writing at the beginning that said this was a fairy tale about Hans, and not really the story of his life. It would be interesting to know just how much truth there is in it.

Danny Kaye did a beautiful job as Hans, a cobbler who gets into trouble with the authorities of his small town because he makes the children late for school by entertaining them with stories and flying kites. So he and his apprentice take off for ""Wonderful, Wonderful Copenhagen,"" just one of the great songs in this movie. There's a cute scene where he tells the story of the Ugly Duckling to a little boy who had his hair shaved off because he was sick. Soon after he is asked to go to the newspaper office, where the publisher tells him that he is the father of the Ugly Duckling, and he's going to print the story in the next day's paper. He also says if Hans will write down some of his stories, the publisher will pay him for them. Hans is overjoyed, considering himself a ""real writer.""

Entirely by accident, he is asked to repair the shoes of the beautiful prima ballerina of the Royal Ballet. He falls in love with her, believing her to be unhappy with her husband the dance master. Actually the couple truly love each other, but love fighting with each other, too. (They call that codependent these days. In those days they were just a little crazy.)

Hans writes a ballet story for her, The Little Mermaid, and she performs it. But much of the ballet in the movie is actually in Hans' imagination, including the Little Mermaid, since he's locked in a closet by the irate husband/ballet master to keep him out of the way. When Hans discovers that she really loves her husband, he returns to the village.

It's a simple story, and if you don't care much for ballet, it may get tiresome. But the music is grand, the costumes and sets are beautiful, and the boy who plays Hans' apprentice is truly charming. This would be a great movie to share with your children or grandchildren.",1337126400,,2171,4.3399014778325125

The music and dancing my not be of BROADWAY/MET quality, but are still entertaining.  I don't know how historically correct this story is, but the script is delightful.  Danny Kaye is remarkable as the story teller; who else could have pulled this off?  Share it with your children/grandchildren and feel safe, it is good clean fun for the whole family.  Danny Kaye was a great comedic actor, but could bring a true, non schmaltzy pathos to his characters.  In his 50 year career, he made many memorable films and this is among the best, if not the best.",1333152000,,708,4.351145038167939

""The Steadfast Tin Soldier"", ""The Snow Queen"", ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Thumbelina"", ""The Little Match Girl"", ""The Ugly Duckling"", ""Thumbelina"", ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", ""The Red Shoes"", and ""The Princess and the Pea"".

I cannot imagine anyone playing the part other than Danny Kaye, who sings some wonderful little songs,
""No two people could ever be more in love; than my lovey-dove and I.""

In the early 1800's; Hans the cobbler from a small village in Denmark goes to the big city of Copenhagen to make his fortune. He falls in love with a ballerina.

Likeable characters. A charming story for both children and adults. Some fairy-tale, ballet-dancing.

You will find yourself singing along with the children and town-folk:
""Though you're no bigger than my thumb; than my thumb; than my thumb. Sweet....Thumbelina don't be glum. now, now, now; ah, ah, ah; come, come come.... Thumbelina, Thumbelina, Tiny little thing.

150456,5,0792843800,This is a TIMELESS movie - which I remember seeing as a young kid;  I purchased it for my 5-1/2 yr.old grandaughter and she LOVES the music - especially the wonderful songs which we sing together now.,1265328000,,200,4.405405405405405
150457,5,0792843800,"I vividly remember watching HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN on television many times as a young child.  It made a great impression on me then, and it still impresses me today.  Over the Thanksgiving holiday, multiple generations (including a passel of kids from 4 to 14) watched this classic, 1950s, movie musical together.  Everyone was enchanted.  Older generations shared their happy memories of this story with the younger ones.  And I was shocked and delighted to discover that I remembered the words to every song.

As stated in the opening frames of this film, HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN is ""not the story of his life, but a fairy tale about a spinner of fairy tales.""  And what a charming fairy tale it is!  With outstanding songs by Frank Loesser, a brilliant performance by Danny Kaye, and gorgeous scenery that seems to leap right out of the pages of a fairy tale picture book, HANS CHRISTAN ANDERSEN captures the hearts and souls of old and young alike.  The wonderfully familiar and memorable songs get the entire family singing along.  I clearly remember the words to ""I'm Hans Christian Andersen,"" ""The Ugly Duckling,"" ""Wonderful, Wonderful Copenhagen,"" ""Thumbelina,"" ""Inchworm,"" ""The Emperor's New Clothes,"" and ""No Two People (Have Ever Been So In Love)"" from my childhood.  In fact, I have been singing some of these songs to my kids for as long as I can remember!

HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN is a happy multi-generational family film that will give everyone warm fuzzies.  This is the perfect time of year for watching HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN, but I would be thrilled to watch it anytime.  This beautiful, nostalgic musical brings up many happy memories and helps make new ones.  HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN is MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1260576000,4,1736,5.0

150461,5,0792843800,"This beautiful 1952 film showcases Danny Kaye in his element, filled with tuneful songs, many to which I was introduced courtesy of an album on which they were sung by a children's choir years before I actually saw the film.
  Myles Connolly's Moss Hart's and Ben Hecht's fairly tale of this teller of fairy tales finds us in early 19th century Odense where Hans the cobbler is telling stories to the local children on a beautiful day when they should be in school. After giving an amusing recital of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", Hans' young apprentice, Peter(Joey Walsh) warns him that a very irate Schoolmaster (John Brown), and Burgomaster (John Qualen) are on their way to confront him about keeping the children away from school with his tales. The confrontation, in which Hans states that there are different ways of learning things seems to touch upon the unspoken issue of Andersen's real-life dyslexia.
 Soon enough, there is a concerted effort to drive Hans out of town. To smooth things over, the ever-practical Peter suggests that Hans go to Copenhagen
without telling him about the Burgomaster's decison. So, off Hans goes, and soon enough, Peter, who was initially supposed to be in charge of the shop in Hans' absence decides to join him and the two begin a marvelous adventure.
 ""Wonderful, Wonderful Copenhagen"" is celebrated in song as the two travel by ship in a glorious moment. Soon, they are mingling with the street vendors in the town square, and we see indirect fodder for the now-familiar stories of Andersen,perhaps most notably the sweetly singing match girl, portrayed by ""It's a Wonderful Life's"" own little Zuzu, Karolyn Grimes.
  With his usual song and good humor, Hans introduces himself and his business to those in the square, but ends up under arrest for unwittingly  showing disrespect for the King's statue. Peter, who was also wanted for the same charge, escapes.
  While peering out of his cell, Hans converses with a lovely little girl( Beverly Washburn), whom he amuses with the tale of Thumbelina. Peter's chance encounter with an official from the Royal Danish Ballet who was in need of a cobbler helps win Hans' release.
  The country cobbler is enchanted at his first encounter with ballet, and with its lead dancer, the beautiful Doro (Zizi Jeanmaire). But the balletmaster Niels(Farley Granger)remains unimpressed by the dress rehearsal performance and, hard taskmaster that he is, makes them do it all over again.
 Peter witnesses the full subsequent interaction between Doro and Niels, watching it go from loving to violent and back again. But Hans, viewing only the negative scene is appalled by Niels' behavior, and stunned to learn that they are married. He fantasizes about rescuing and perhaps even marrying Doro, brushing aside Peter's astute observations about their earlier interaction with each other.
 Given his orders, he creates shoes for the ballet during they daytime. But writes a story that he hopes will speak to Doro by night.
 When the ballet moves out on its annual tour, leaving Hans and Peter in Copenhagen, they continue to work, but Hans cannot get the beautiful danseuse out of his mind. His days are spent working on shoes and amusing local schoolchildren with his tales, as was the case back home in Odense. But one particular tale of the Ugly Duckling, told to cheer up a young boy recovering from illness named Lars (Peter Votrian) results in his stories being published in the local newspaper by the boy's father, who is the editor. It's a lovely scene that also touches on Danny Kaye's real-life humanitarian work.
  The brief, sweetly-sung ballad, ""Anywhere I Wander"", summarizes Hans'ongoing yearnings. The song, ""No Two People"" features Kaye's trademark patter number with Jeanmaire in tow. When the ballet returns to Copenhagen, there are plans to put on  a performance of Hans' story, ""The Little Mermaid"". Peter can see that his gullible boss is being used by Niels and Doro and laughed at behind his back. But Hans' swelling ego blinds him to this fact.
 One more reverently beautful ballet scene stands between Hans, and the final resolution of this story--an elegantly charming masterpiece that keeps on giving time after time!",1253145600,,4218,5.018624641833811

There is nothing vulgar, or crude, nor is there anything I would be ashamed to show any memeber of my family.

The movie is based on some of Andersen's famous stories, ""The little mermaid"" is followed by a nice balet performance for all dance lovers.

The storyline is not to be taken literally, of course, but then the movie is more about Danny Kaye than Andersen.

There are so many classic songs in here (Inchworm/2 and 2 are 4;  Ugly Duckling; etc.) and Danny Kaye is a charmer here, much better than his more slapstick style in other movies.

The only part that I found somewhat tedious was the long scene where he's trapped in a storage room at the ballet and can only imagine what the dancing must be like based on the music he hears (I admit I sometimes fast forward past this bit).

I have no children, yet I enjoy this movie very much! I loaned it to my friend and her (very hyper) children were glued to it. I especially enjoyed the toning down of Danny Kaye, there is none of his over-the-top silliness that really bothers me at times. This movie is labelled at the outset as a fairy tale in it's own right, it's not meant to be factual. It features his happier tales indeed, but they are small parts of the overall tale; the larger tale features a man who seeks to entertain and to teach, yet is subject to a bit of vanity as are most of us...it also illustrates the danger of living too much in fantasy!

This is a movie that is positive, well acted (mostly...the bit parts are pretty weak) and has a wonderful score that I was still able to sing or hum despite the passing of 20-30 years between viewings...how many movies can you say that about?",1203206400,,1020,4.284974093264249

Hans Christian Andersen is a Dutch cobbler who enjoys telling stories to the children in his village. When concerns for the children's education begins to anger the adults, Hans and his apprentice Peter leave for Coppenhagen for new territory. In Coppenhagen, Hans finds inspiration for some of his most memorable stories, as well as love for a beautiful ballerina.

Danny Kaye is endearing and charming as he works with the children he tells the stories to.

My husband's father was a friend of Frank Loesser, the composer of the words and music for the film, and also his payroll manager for years at his music company Frank Music, so I might be a little biased. Danny Kaye is great as Hans, the shoemaker who makes up children's stories and songs, and all of the supporting cast is excellent as well, especially Farley Granger as a cranky play producer. If you don't know the songs already( The Ugly Duckling, Thumbelina, Inchworm....)they are all very catchy and will grow on you. The sets used in the film are all top notch and very beautiful. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards but did not win any. I can't say enough about this film. One thing I will say is if you didn't grow on this film like I did, children over 10 might find it some what dated. I wish there was some special features on the dvd but all you get is the trailer, it would have been nice to have a making of documentary or director's commentary, maybe in a future release.

It's not one of Danny's more comical pieces, being a bit more serious, but it holds his classic trademarks in film.

The filmitself is a wonderful tale of hope and inspiration, of moving around in the world and up in the world when the world doesn't necessarily appreciate you or your efforts to help make the world a betterplace.

150497,2,0792843800,"I'm not a big fan of musicals or Danny Kaye films, so ""Hans Christian Andersen"" had a steep uphill battle to win me over. The whole film is painfully earnest, which can certainly set the stage for a good post-modern mocking. I steeled myself to bear the brunt of a flimsy plot strung with forgettable patter songs that Kaye would burble as he hopped about, twiddling his fingers or something. I was surprised to find that, while the film has it flaws, beneath its surface lay a thoughtful, affecting story. Not only was it engaging, but it had a few things to say about the joys - and pitfalls - of fantasy.

Mr. Kaye (of course) plays Hans, a small-town cobbler who spends most of his time flying kites and telling stories to the local children. He does this so much, in fact, the schoolmaster successfully campaigns to have him driven from town. To save his pride, his apprentice Peter (Joseph Walsh) talks Hans into travelling to The Big City - in this case, Copenhagen. Between this exchange, and the travelling song that follows it, the word ""Copenhagen"" is said about a thousand times, or a least enough for a small-scale drinking game. It isn't long after arriving that Hans and Peter set up shop in their ""temporary"" home. Unfortunately, it also isn't long before Hans gets thrown into jail through his ignorance of the city's laws. Happily though, one of the gentry pays to have the cobbler freed.

Things get more complicated when the benefactor enlists Hans to make new ballet slippers for Doro (dancer Zizi Jeanmaire), the prima donna of the local ballet company. One look at her and Hans is smitten, blinded to everything. Doro's marriage to the company director Niels (Farley Granger) is tempestuous, and Hans misreads this to be a damsel in need of rescue. More fuel is added to the fire when the company adapts ""The Little Mermaid"" (ostensibly written as a love letter to Doro) as a ballet. Peter tries desperately to warn Hans, but a painful collision with reality is inevitable.

Interestingly, it is Hans' very gift at immersing himself so completely into his dreams that gets him in the most trouble. Indeed, his burgeoning career as a writer and his friendship with Peter are almost destroyed by his romantic fantasies. While Hans does go on to storybook immortality, his tall tales seem to be double-edged swords, giving the frothy plot depth and emotion. It's a far cry from the modern take of stories as teachers and healers, innately resolving any conflicts by the final curtain.

Many of Mr. Loesser's songs are bright and fun (""Thumbelina"" is a highlight, and viewers may remember ""Inchworm"" from a later episode of ""The Muppet Show""), and the art direction, while cluttered at times, is fairy-tale cheerful. Some sequences are overlong (the climactic ballet especially so), and the ending seems rather abrupt (Hans makes the transition back from crushed cobbler back to chipper writer in a single scene), but all in all ""Hans Christian Andersen"" is a charming musical with some intriguing ideas.",1144886400,8,3023,4.841392649903288
150498,5,0792843800,"The first time I saw this movie, I was in second grade and staying overnight at a friend's house.

Now that I have a 2-year-old, I see that it wasn't just me.  My son loves the movie and especially the little stories and songs from Andersen's tales.

150499,4,0792843800,"HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN presents a fanciful, fictionalised re-telling of the famed storyteller's life, highlighted by Frank Loesser's beautiful score and the perfect casting of Danny Kaye in the central role.

As the film opens, cobbler Hans is entertaining the children of Odense, Denmark, with yet another fantastic tale, much to the consternation of the schoolmaster who feels the children are having their time wasted when they should be studying.  This seems to be the opinion of most of the townspeople, so Hans is politely told to leave town...for a while anyway.  Hans and his young assistant travel to the bright lights and bustle of Copenhagen for a fresh start, but old habits die hard and soon Hans is entertaining a new group of children with his amazing storytelling talents.  When Hans is engaged to make slippers and toe-shoes for the city's ballet troupe, he becomes entranced by the prima ballerina Doro (Zizi Jeanmaire in her film debut) not knowing that she's married to the troupe's tough choreographer Niels (Farley Granger).  His story of ""The Little Mermaid"", inspired by Doro, becomes the ballet's new work, but discovering the truth, Hans returns to Odense a hero, his storytelling now famous all over Europe.

Danny Kaye is just was is called for in the role of Hans.  His natural warmth, fatherly air and ability to combine pathos and heart serves him well in his performance.  Zizi Jeanmaire as the glamorous Doro likewise is perfect casting (although Moira Shearer from ""The Red Shoes"" was first choice, pregnancy prevented her from doing the film).  Having shot to fame in husband Roland Petit's ballet version of ""Carmen"", Jeanmaire adds a European beauty and elegance to her role, and Petit staged all the ballet numbers in this film too.  Farley Granger's Niels is the perfect foil to Danny Kaye's innocent and childlike Hans, and the love triangle is thrillingly brought to life in the Dream Ballet.

Frank Loesser's score is what most people remember the film for, and it's one of the best written by the legendary composer-lyricist.  He had just come from his phenomenal success on Broadway with the score of ""Guys and Dolls"" and Hollywood was eager for him to ply his trade for the movie musicals of the 1950's.  Songs like ""Thumbelina"", ""The Ugly Duckling"", ""Wonderful Wonderful Copenhagen"" and ""I'm Hans Christian Andersen"" have become well-known standards.  ""Inchworm"", bookended by children chanting their times tables, is so lovely and gentle in it's beauty, and ""No Two People"" is a jaunty little duet for Hans and Doro in the Dream Ballet.

This film was beautifully-photographed by Oscar-nominee Harry Stradling.  The film also received Oscar nominations for Costume Design (Mary Wills, Madame Karinska), Art Direction/Set Decoration, Best Music Scoring (Walter Scharf), Best Song and Best Sound Recording.  The Technicolor photography is absolutely stunning and the bold colours pop off the screen with their brightness and clarity.",1141171200,46,2979,5.172916666666667

150501,4,0792843800,"As always Danny Kaye gives a wonderfully delightful performance and is totally convincing as the kind hearted storyteller.

Both myself and my 7 yr old grandson enjoyed the movie thoroughly. The singing and dancing keep children happy and are so well done that adults enjoy them as well.

150504,3,0792843800,"HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN is a fantastic show, produced by Samuel Goldwyn as a showcase for his greatest star, with music by the toast of Broadway and Hollywood, Frank Loesser, and a veritable corncucopia of dated ballet sequences by impish little Roland Petit, at that time very much the secret boyfriend of legendary ballerina Margot Fonteyn.  So what happened?  Why is this movie so awful?  I guess it depends on how much you can take of Danny Kaye.

When I was a boy he was acknowledged by our parents as the funniest man alive, and on Saturday afternoons we were herded into matinee re-releases of his biggest hits, all of them lousy in my eyes, but my mom and dad thought them all laugh fests.  Even the sad story of THE FIVE PENNIES fit into this category, ie lousy.  This was my first experience with the terrible shock all children feel when we first find out our parents are 100 per cent wrong.  Danny Kaye would be up there on the screen in that motley cap with little bells on it, playing medieval in THE COURT JESTER, and all the parents in the theater would be sobbing with laughter, while all the kids were snarling and mashing chewing gum into the cement floor of the cinema.  In HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN, Danny Kaye is platonically, but extremely in love with Zizi Jeanmaire, and even way back then I knew she was mis-cast.  The filmmmakers must have wanted to use either Leslie Caron or Moira Shearer, and instead somehow wound up with the giggly, cross eyed Jeanmaire who sort of looks like a taller version of Georgette on THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW.  In the meantime she is married to Farley Granger.  The erotic tension between Danny Kaye, supposedly a heterosexual, and Farley Granger, ditto, is greater than that of Granger and John Dall in Hitchcock's ROPE, with Jeanmaire sort of a substitute shuttlecock the two are parrying over, like a piece of Steuben glass.  She's dreadful and she dances through at least 45 minutes of the movie.  Her name is ""Doro,"" I suppose sort of a Danish name, but really nobody ever was named ""Doro.""

The real Danish beauty is Erik Bruhn, the best dancer of the 1950s, who has a prominent part in the dancing and almost saves it from Petit's wretched excess, but actually you'll have more fun just pressing your freeze frame button on Bruhn's beefcake, without having to actually watch the choreography (he's in the ice skating ballet).

Frank Loesser's songs are all good, but there's only six or seven of them.  Danny Kaye hams it up and hogs them all.  He is dangerous to children, he pretends to love them and yet looking at his mad little eyes you know he hates them.",1131408000,3,2625,4.598712446351931

150510,2,0792843800,"The really wonderful parts of this film are the great songs by Frank Loesser as performed by Danny Kaye. Loesser was at his peak and delivered songs that were all memorable, all charming and (almost) all on target for plot and character. Kaye combines charm and wit in a way that was all his. He is perfect for this material. This should have been the basis for a wonderful musical. Unfortunately, the film was ""overproduced"" with substantial elements that distract and detract from this strong core.

Moss Hart got hired to do the screenplay. His script is flabby and overlong. Dramatic scenes go on aimlessly and are so long that the energy of the musical numbers dissapates. Mr. Hart's script should have been ruthlessly reworked and tightened. The second error was hiring Roland Petit to film the multiple ballet sequences. Here is where the film really begins to look like one the least successful of that long line of ""The Red Shoes"" wannabes that Hollywood produced in the late 1940's and early 1950's. Unfortunately, these numbers have none of the charm, intensity, and cinematic quality of that earlier classic. Sadly, when a producer has paid big bucks for a major playwright and a major choreographer, he is very unlikely to discard their well meant but inappropriate contributions.

I wish Mr. Goldwyn had stayed strictly with what worked.",1115510400,3,1351,4.947136563876652
150511,5,0792843800,"I fell hopelessly in love with Danny Kaye when I was 8 years old, and I'm still crazy about him many years later. . .  no other performer of whom I'm aware has ever shown his unique combination of comic virtuousity, tenderness, silliness, physical bravado and dramatic depth.

He could also really sing, not just comically but straightforwardly, in his naturally rich, sweet lyric-tenor voice.  If you really listen to the ""Inchworm"" song, you will hear just how fine his voice really was.

The ballet sequences in the movie transfixed me as an eight-year-old ballerina wannabe.  Maybe they look hokey to present-day grownups, but I bet most kids would immediately understand.

One of the best movies ever!!!!",1072051200,12,709,5.017094017094017
150512,5,0792843800,"Danny Kaye plays the Danish cobbler-storyteller, Hans Christian Andersen. At the beginning he is said by the schoolmaster of the village of Odense he is causing trouble. The trouble is he tells stories to the village children, and they learn things like numbers falling in love and marrying each other. One town person said of his stories: They asked their daughter what time it was? She said ""the minute and hour hands weren't speaking to each other. They were in love with the second hand. So they wouldn't make up until they met at 12 o' clock."" After all the commotion with the village officials, Hans goes back to his cobbler shop. There his apprentice friend, Peter talks him into getting away from the village and going to Copenhagen.

Reluctant at first Hans agrees to go to Copenhagen with Peter. There Hans meets and falls in love with Doro (Jeanmarie), a beautiful French ballerina. But later learns that she is married to the demanding Niels (Farley Granger). Overwhelmed by his love for her, he is inspired to write, 'The Little Mermaid' for Doro. The story of the Little Mermaid, like Doro goes-that she looked for love from the wrong man. Hans becomes popular with the people of Copenhagen and his gift in telling stories to the children. So Andersen's fame grew out of his plays and stories. Some of the musical scores that stand out are the most known of Andersen's best loved works. Those most memorable numbers are from 'Inchworm,' 'Thumbelina' and 'The Ugly Duckling.' Hans later finds that the ballerina truly loves her husband, so Hans returns home to his village of Odense. There he tells his stories to the children who loves to hear his fairy tales. You may not find Kaye's usual comic flair here. He extends his more poignant side of the famous storyteller. This was Kaye's final film of his career beofre embarking on his life's love of working with Unicef. If you like to read about Andersen, he wrote his auto-bio, 'The Fairy Tale of My Life.' The film itself is a delightful children's story that the whole family can love.",1053388800,15,2053,4.73463687150838

Andersen moves to Copenhagen, falls in love with a beautiful french ballerina, and gets himself famous for his stories, all the while going from song to song with true Kaye spirit.

150519,3,0792843800,"For all the film's deficiencies, Danny Kaye, always an outstanding performer, manages to be engaging and quite delightful.
The plot has little to do with Hans Christian Andersen, and is based quite loosely on some of his tales, not his far from whismsical life. Only the happiest parts of Andersen's least troubling stories are included (in musical adaptation) - there is no hint of the writer of the Little Match Girl or the Red Shoes. This is strictly a vehicle for a warm, kind-hearted, naive Danny Kaye portrayal.
It is good entertainment, if taken as a Kaye act rather than for literary or artistic merit.",998006400,12,610,4.819047619047619
150520,5,0792843800,"Hans Christian Andersen (1805-75) was an Ugly Duckling. He lived in the third largest town Odense, in Denmark. The son of a cobbler he was poverty ridden and a failure as an actor and it wasn't until he moved to Copenhagen  and won the patronage of Frederick VI, through his poetry, that he wrote  his fairy tales and developed into a swan. Like many artists he wasn't  particularly happy, and never did marry, although he was very fond of Jenny  Lind (1820-87) the Swedish Nightingale a soprano given the name by P.T.  Barnum during her tour of the United States between 1850-52.)  Charles Vidor's film does state at the beginning, This is not the story of  Hans Christian Andersen but a fairy tale about the great spinner of fairy  tales. The Danes objected to the way Hans Christian Andersen was portrayed  even though Goldwyn had rejected 21 previous manuscripts, so the film  company inserted this statement in the credits.
  Danny Kaye with his  chiselled features does resemble H.C.Andersen when looking at his profile,  but apart from this facial feature that's where it stops. Kaye had dark  hair but Hollywood soon changed that and he became a blonde, Andersen also  had dark hair but he kept it that way.
  Unlike some earlier musicals,  this film does have a strong story line with loads of songs written by  ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"", Frank Loessen, such as Thumbelina,  Ugly Duckling, No Two People, and of course Wonderful Copenhagen. The  scenery is very clever, the backgrounds look like illustrations from fairy  tale books, but as the camera zooms in to the foreground the buildings and  props become three dimensional similar to a pop-up-book.
  There are  four ballet scenes that I probably found boring back in `52, but revisiting  them now, they are visually very interesting, technically I wouldn't know  if they are good or mediocre but for a Hollywood musical film, four ballets  must of taken an enormous amount of consideration seeing as the film is  really for kids. Once again the backdrops for the ballets also resemble  fairy tale illustrations and pop-up-books.
  Instead of a soprano,  Andersen falls in love with a ballet dancer and here's a musical that  doesn't have a very happy ending because poor Hans gets mixed up with a  married woman. The ballet dancer Doro, is played by Zizi Jeanmaire, and is  married to Niels played by Farley Granger. During the last part of the  film, the audience is taken behind the scenes of the ballet company playing  at the Royal Theater in Copenhagen, but this isn't a film of a show  included in a show, similar to earlier musicals, but an uplifting musical  film with lots of music with catchy tunes helped by a ton of children.
  The last ballet scene takes 17 minutes, quite long for a popular movie. In  the film Hans writes a story especially for his love Doro, unfortunately  Niels locks him in a cupboard so Andersen never sees her perform but has to  use his imagination.
  The ballet takes place on land and under the  ocean. The surface waves are pop-up so that the dancers can be seen dancing  in between the swells, it's really very clever visually, and there's no  trickery here. Under the sea filled with monsters and witches, the heroine  is probably attached to a pulley so that she can be seen swimming for the  surface. There are no blue screens in this film, all effects are up-front  and work perfectly similar to a staged ballet. Once again the technicolor  process is used and this enhances the fairy tale effect with vivid  colors.
  Hans Christian Andersen fairy stories are not violent when  compared to the Grimm brothers, but the themes usually have a lesson, and  in the story written for Doro's ballet, ""The Little Mermaid,"" it  is saying that aiming for the stars does not always bring happiness, but  then of course Walt Disney hadn't yet arrived on the scene and he soon  changed that philosophy.",953251200,146,3902,4.7642642642642645
