7800423,4,1612617603,"I will use this DVD as a teaching series during Lent. The first session is scheduled for 2-14-18 so I have no feed-back from the group as yet. However we did use another of Albert Haase DVD's during our Advent series, which was very well received, hence our order for this DVD. I expect, having previewed the DVD it will be enjoyable and edifying as well.
