8269045,4,B0018BA70I,"This movie about an unstable Georgia woman (Alma Thorpe) and her long-suffering daughter Marge is like the Southern companion piece to GREY GARDENS , dealing with family dysfunction and bizarre, complicated relationships. Whereas most people who endured such experiences as the Thorpes would prefer NOT to air their dirty laundry, the brazen leading lady spouts out whatever comes to mindmuch to the embarrassment of her daughter. This independent flick reminds me of the kind of films I used to watch in the late 90s when I got the Sundance Channel and is much more interesting than the crap that Hollywoods been spewing out the past 20 years.",1509235200,,644,5.02803738317757

8269048,5,B0018BA70I,"I was at Du-Art, a lab for film, about 10 years ago when Albert Maysles, emerged from a screening of Ruth Leitman's Alma.  He was quite excited about it and suggested screening the two together, as he saw them as comparable in their approach to a subject who was clearly mentally ill and enjoyed preening for the camera.  Alma is a bit more challenging as her situation seems far more precarious than the Beale sisters in Grey Gardens.  However, I think Leitman did a commendable job of remaining objective yet compassionate to her subject.  Alma screened at the Whitney Bienniel in 2000",1298160000,3,587,4.7254901960784315
8269049,4,B0018BA70I,"Well, I'm not over mine, so I ""ain't got no answers.""  Mama's crazy, but Dad willingly hops on the roller coaster and enjoys the ride. . . no one thinks to inquire how baby's doing.  I wonder if parents begin to act crazy just to cover-up or excuse their bad behavior.  After that childhood, if you can call it that, wouldn't you think Margie should be the crazy one?",1252540800,,367,4.2898550724637685
8269050,5,B0018BA70I,"Alma is a brilliant film that focuses on a southern family in crisis. Alma, the mother, is going through a mental collapse; Jim, the dad, has retreated into himself and Margie, the daughter, is trying to hold everything together while also secretly wanting to just let it all fall as it may. This sounds like a downer but it's not, and this is mainly though the empathetic filmmaking and the sheer insane but entertaining delusions and yarns that come from Alma's mouth.

At times it seems she's acutely aware of being filmed and maybe even playing to camera, while at other times it's quite obvious that hers is a real mental torture that is killing her. The heroine of the movie is Margie who goes beyond ""a daughter's duty"" to the point of almost switching roles and becoming mother to her own parents. Along the way there are several shocking revelations (at least shocking to anyone not from the south) and hilarious episodes that would make you cry if it weren't for Alma's charm. This is not to say that the film portrays mental illness as a light-hearted romp, hardly, as there are several scenes that will literally break your heart.

All told, Alma is an instant classic and deserves a wider audience. Now that it's finally on DVD maybe it will get the attention it deserves.",1221523200,3,1285,4.656387665198238
8269051,5,B0018BA70I,"I have always loved crazy women--in fact, I come from a long line of 'em.  It has always fascinated me to observe a crazy woman unleashing herself on others like a hurricane.  This is the basis for my fascination with ""Alma"", the brilliant film by Ruth Leitman, director of ""Lipstick and Dynamite"".  When I read Eleanor Ringel's review of ""Alma"" in The Atlanta Journal when it was released, I knew I had to take the afternoon off from work and go and investigate.  I remember the review mentioning a ""bombshell"" of a shocker that took place while the documentary was being filmed, and knew I wouldn't be waiting until that evening to see it, much less until it came to video (the rental format in those days).  Good thing--it has now been 10 years since the release and it is just now coming to dvd.  HALLELUJAH!
""Alma"" is a one-of-a-kind Southern dysfunction film in the tradition of Tennessee Williams.  It has everything one could want in a film about a crazy but lovable Southern tornado and those she leaves in her wake.  Hear Alma talk about the gnome who took her down at the grocery store, or the ""overhead"" that she talks to, and listen to her reminisce about her first sexual experience at the age of seven with an uncle in a cotton field as if it was the usual way these things are done.  Hear her explain away child sexual abuse as ""I just thought those things would be better learned in the home.""  And see her attempt to take a leg of lamb into an Atlanta courtroom to invoke Jesus into the proceedings!
The amazing thing about Ms. Leitman's film is that it fuses all of its truths and revelations with equal parts of respect and humor.  I remember hearing her answer questions about the aftermath of the film at a question and answer session when I saw the movie the second time.  She said that Alma, the main subject of the film, would ask people if they had seen her movie, and that she sort of basked in the glow of celebrity that it brought.  I think that speaks to the director's even hand--even with the film being as revelatory as it was, it was never sensationalized.  That is great filmmaking!
The other subject of the film is Alma's long-suffering daughter Margie, who, like many children of insane Southern belles, manages to eclipse her origins, making a better life for herself that is informed by her childhood rather than crippled by it.  Margie also has an incredible amount of patience and empathy for her mother, demonstrated time and again throughout the filming of this amazing testament to the resilience of the human spirit.  I think the tag line on a postcard advertising the film that I picked up at one of the screenings sums it up best, ""She's not crazy, she's my mother.""
One footnote:
If you love movies like ""Sordid Lives"" and ""Come Back to the 5 & 10 Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean"" then you will adore ""Alma""--she's the real thing!",1218499200,9,2869,4.5310077519379846
