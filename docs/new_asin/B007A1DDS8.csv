After pre-washing and ironing the fabric, I had a near panic attack. I was so scared to start cutting the beautiful fabric into small pieces! I went ahead and popped the Abracadabra DVD into my laptop and patiently followed Wendy's instructions on cutting the fabric. I then began to sew the puzzle together -- for that's what quilts are, intricate fabric puzzles -- and discovered that Wendy's piecing techniques are easy to follow and save a lot of time! I now have a beautiful lap quilt and am determined to make more, one for each member of my family!",1331337600,,676,4.459677419354839
8513113,5,B007A1DDS8,"I am not much of a sewer, so I was hesitant to try making a quilt.  Abracadabra Quilting was just what I needed. There are helpful tips on picking fabrics that coordinate and the step by step instructions that guided me every step of the way and in a few days of focused cutting and sewing, I had a beautiful quilt top!  I am so pleased with the results and feel like a master quilter. I look forward to trying other Abracadabra patterns.",1330905600,,438,4.265060240963855
