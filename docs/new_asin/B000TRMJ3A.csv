8210476,5,B000TRMJ3A,"This documentary presents several subjects including Monarch (trauma based) mind control, the CIA's MK Ultra which was their mind control research program, the US Army's Project Phoenix (conducted during the Vietnam war), Operation Paper Clip which brought many Nazis to the U.S. at the end of WWII, HAARP, microwave weapons and other subjects besides. The presentation is intriguing as it provides names, dates, and places so that anyone can get started doing their own research. For those who are already aware of the conspiracy, these items may not be new but, the film is still interesting and useful as it probes the connection between these various tentacles of activity and suggests a direction for those seeking to discover the ""head of the octopus"".",1365206400,,758,5.170731707317073
