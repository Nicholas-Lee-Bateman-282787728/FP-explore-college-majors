469581,2,6302424909,"This film has only one redeeming quality- it provides an excellent opportunity to discuss bias, historical perspective, director's artistic liscence, and distortion of historical events.  I viewed this film knowing that the Chinese, poorly portrayed by Americans or British, were being presented from a completely demeaning perspective that simultaneously plays the Americans as the savior heros.  I plan to use this in my 7th grade social studies class to demonstrate exactly how a series of events as complex and consequential as the Boxer Rebellion can be recreated so completely and utterly wrong.  Watch this as you would a Disney film like Mulan, knowing that it will only get the gist of something, and not provide any reliable characters or history.",998438400,7,757,5.291666666666667
469582,4,6302424909,"""55 Days at Peking"" is somewhat of a novelty to me. The reason I gave it one more star than it deserves is because of the novel direction of the great Nicholas Ray. I am still amused at films that use over-the-hill actors portraying characters who are supposed to be considerably younger. This is a story about foreign diplomats trapped in Peking during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. Sets are exotic (filmed at Bronston studios in Spain) and the colors are exquisite, though the VHS tape  version is badly in need of a restoration; colors have faded. This film could not be released in the politically correct mainstream that film purists have seemed to develop. Most of the ""Chinese"" are actually Japanese actors, and, worse, Europeans made up as Asians. Very tacky. (Flora Robson, however, seems to have loads of fun as the Chinese dowager empress). See this film for the wonderful direction of Ray; seeing Ava Gardner working again is always a delight. The scope of the film is powerful (too bad there's not a letterbox version, since it was filmed in super-Panavision), and it's a fine history lesson, historically quite accurate.",986688000,2,1133,4.870466321243524
469583,4,6302424909,"The last theatrical feature film from director Nicholas Ray who made REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, BIGGERT THAN LIFE, THEY LIVE BY NIGHT, etc., is a historical epic spectacle set in Beijing, China in the midst of the revolt of the Boxers. Producer Samuel Bronston wanted to make an exotic film about war, political intrigue, and international solidarity.
However, epic spectacle is not realy Ray's league. And in the midle of the shooting, Ray had a heart attack. Most of the ""big"" scenes ended up to be shot by second-unit director Andrew Morton. and while they are effective enough, they arr not that great.
Still, this film bears a lot of the unmisstakable signature of Ray; the master of human emotion. Never before Charlton Heston was able to show such an intimacy, so much of human vulnerability in a film. The scene in which he has to tell the daughter of his best friend's half-chinese daughter that her father was killed in action (a scene that banal directors would treat as a shalow tearjearker) shows how much subtle and truthful emotion Ray was capable to pull out from his actors.
Ava Gardner plays a turnished Russian contessa, and is extraordinary. Her story is perhaps the strongest among this multi-charactered, muti-layered drama.
While the production design is quite adequate considering the film was shot in Spain in the 60's, and surprisingly deprived of phony extoticism for that time, contemporary viewers may take it rather silly. But please remember that at that time, somesthing like THE LAST EMPEROR was impossible. Western film crew were not even allowed to set foot on the Chinese land.
Some scenes still are good example of another trademark directorial touch of Ray; his love for extremely dramatic composition and particulary to pull out the dramatic core of a scene by setting it on an unstable location such as stairs.
It is a flawed film, perhaps, but still extremly beautiful and emotional. Dimitri Tiomkin's score (and the song ""So Little Time"") is also unforgettable.",984873600,83,1999,4.970149253731344
469584,4,6302424909,"This is a good colonial adventure in the vein of ""Zulu"", ""Khartoum"" (also starring Heston), etc.  I found the characters quite interesting and enjoyable and the action was nearly epic in portion.  As I stated earlier, it is similar to ""Zulu"" in that Western  imperialists are under seige  behind makeshift fortifications, etc.  However, there is something missing that just keeps 55 Days from reaching  the sheer excellence of ""Zulu"". Still, it is a good film, very  much worth having in your video collection.
Despite what another reviewer  might have written, ""55 Days at Peking"" is nearly as accurate as  any Hollywood adaption of history could be. And, for the record, during the  nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the United States had little or no  design concerning China, other than to keep it open equally for trade. Not  only that, but when asked by Britain and France to join in the Arrow War  (Second Opium War) the United States declined (see Edwardes, Michael.  ""The West in Asia."" p. 119. G.P. Putnam's Sons. New York. 1967.);  and while the US did take reprisals against some Chinese forts for various  reasons (often trival), they never sought colonial territory, as such, in  China.",962841600,8,1207,4.984924623115578
469585,5,6302424909,"Not a bad historical drama even if the producers have taken artistic license with dates and characters. Flora Robson doesnt fool anyone as the Dowager Empress(she was actually more scheming and nasty than portrayed)  but still commands a regal presence. Must be all that practice at the RSC.  She orders a summary execution like it was a cup of tea! Off with his head  and don't forget the cucumber sandwiches...! Sir Robert Helpmann playing  Prince Tuan gets to be the bad guy which he does with great relish and  understated glee. The same glee he showed as the child catcher in Chitty  chitty Bang bang. Alas he is no longer with us.
Chuck Heston gets to play  the laidback hero,of course but even he is upstaged by the diva herself,Ava  Gardner. Excuse the cliche but her presence on screen IS like a breath of  fresh air. God bless her,tantrums and all. As the Baroness Ivanoff, an  ostracized member of the russian diplomatic corps in 'Peking' she makes a  grand solitary entrance on Charlton Hestons arm at the British Embassy Ball  to celebrate the Queens birthday and milks it for everything its worth. What  a gal...! Ava should have gone on to better things but alas it was not to  be.
David Niven provides a calm serene presence as the british ambassador  and looks not out of place here either. Memorable scene at an audience with  the Empress in the imperial throne room where besides other diplomatic  pressures he is expected to kowtow in formal obeisance to the imperial  throne but instead gently kicks aside the obligatory cushions and gives a  perfunctory nod instead. Typical Niven trademark that.
The rest of the  story, the real story that is, is focused on the seige of the foreign  legations which went on for...you guessed it,55days. Theres lots of shooting  and fanatical chinese men being killed not to mention heaps of fireworks. Oh  yes and theres also a brilliant diamond necklace thrown in for good  measure. Enough said. But even these take 2nd place to Ava's on screen  presence which will be sorely missed for alas she too is with us no more.",936316800,8,2077,4.718662952646239

469820,5,6302424909,"Review of 55 Days at Peking
Hot Toasty Rag, September 9, 2017

Although Dimitri Tiomkins score evoked every fitting emotion, it was a travesty that his were the only nominations 55 Days at Peking received in 1964. This incredibly lavish war epic was majorly snubbed at the Oscars; it should have been nominated for, if not won, Best Picture.

The start of the film shows Peking in 1900. The United States, England, France, Italy, Germany, Russia, Austria, and Japan are all represented with troops, flags, and national anthems played at the same time. The countries occupy separate spaces and are very clearly only interested in playing their own tunes. When the Boxer Rebellion comes to a head, all the nations must come together and try to fight the Boxers off. Theyre grossly outnumbered and try to hold out and defend themselves until reinforcements arrive.

Nicholas Rays direction is excellent, especially when you consider his most famous films were quiet, inclusive dramas like Rebel Without a Cause and In a Lonely Place. The battle scenes are exciting and choreographically splendid to watch. This is an epic on a grand scale, with exquisitely detailed costumes and sets, by Veniero Colasanti and John Moore. In the beginning of the film, before the violence starts, theres a ball, and all the dignitaries and military men are resplendent in their uniforms. Its a very necessary scene, to show how far they fall during their desperate battle. I cant understand why this film didn't do well at the box office or during awards season; its one of the most fantastic historical epics Ive ever seen. While the battle scenes aren't grotesque, as they would be if the film was remade, theres enough tension to satisfy modern audiences. The combination of hope and hopelessness is incredible; I don't know whether to attribute it to the director, screenwriter, or the actors themselves.

Charlton Heston plays an American major, and hes joined by John Ireland and Jerome Thor; the latter has a half-Chinese daughter to provide for. While balancing his soldier duties, Chuck has an affair with Ava Gardner, whos supposed to play a Russian baroness. Ava doesnt even try for a Russian accent, and her homage to New York on the ends of her words made me cringe a little. Thankfully, she doesnt have a very big part, and Chuck is free to focus on his scenes without her, which are much better acted.

Its David Niven who steals the show, not only in his characters written part, but in his acting. He plays a British diplomat, based on the real life figure during the Boxer Rebellion, Sir Claude MacDonald, but since he has previous military experience, hes involved firsthand in the battle strategies. Lesser actors might have played the part as a one-dimensional diplomat, but The Niv gave a four-dimensional fantastic performance. Hes just as anxious to return home to England as he is to return to the battlefield; and for a man who has the weight of his family, his country, and seven other allied nations on his shoulders, he show so much more emotion on his face than could be written in a screenplay. During the ball, the German Ambassador pays David Nivens character a compliment, and I think its fitting for the actor himself:

I admire Sir Arthur. He always gives me the feeling that God must be an Englishman.",1504915200,,3318,4.853356890459364

470172,5,6302424909,"This is an ok-to-good epic that rises to 5-stars for me simply for its closing scene, that every time gets me weeping like a child.  As the Marines move out, {slight SPOILER} commander Charlton Heston rides past the little half-Chinese daughter of his killed comrade, now without father or mother.  Heston has explained she shouldn't go to America as things are different there, a code for saying that she is the one who is actually too different.  A final interaction between the two is sought by the Marine sergeant; the girl's expression in the scene, along with the score, is priceless.

The plot of the movie is standard ""Cowboys and Chinese"" like other cinematic epics -- The Alamo (Cowboys and Mexicans), Zulu (Cowblokes and Africans), Khartoum (also Heston, Cowbrits and proto-Islamists), more recently ""300"" (Cowspartans and Persians).

Based on the historic Boxer Rebellion, when Chinese nationalist-cultist fanatics in 1900 besieged foreign legations in Peking with some later aid by China's official military, the film is a mix of a passion for accuracy -- reconstructed Peking look-alike sets, accurate uniforms, mostly accurate weapons, rather accurate story line -- with dated cinema & politics (white actors for Chinese, overrepresented Anglo-Saxons, underrepresented Chinese grievances against the foreign powers, America's bad record sanitized or ignored, prior & subsequent western & Japanese violence unrepresented).  And fictional characters and events added.  Square-jawed Charlton Heston is a fictional Marine commander and Stiff-Upper-Lip David Niven a fictional British diplomat. Ava Gardner is fictionally Russian love interest, and there is fictional counter-raid action.

Still it should be recommended for a solid Oscar-nominated score, mostly good action, cool photography, partly correct history, nice bromance (Heston and Niven), ok romance (Heston and Ava Gardner), some attempt to represent Chinese fairly and the badness of war frankly, and also a clear indictment of American anti-Chinese racism in even Heston's reaction to the little girl, and for the resolution of that theme in the heart-tugging closing scene.  (The actress playing the little girl -- Korean-British performer Lynne Sue Moon -- vanished from movies and public record a few years later, but not before playing another key figure for another famous farewell scene as the girl-student who gives the gift to a parting Sidney Poitier in ""To Sir With Love"".)",1448755200,,2459,5.5186170212765955

470237,5,6302424909,"""55 Days At Peking"" is a very good movie that reminds you of the epic kind of films Hollywood use to make with a big name cast and a story set with lots of drama and action. They don't make these kind of movies anymore. Nowadays the only kind of movie you see Hollywood making is what I call comic book movies based after some comic book superhero. They are short on plot and long on explosions usually and fighting and quickly forgotten. Especially once the next comic book movie comes along. ""55 Days At Peking"" has a plot and a line up of some of the best actors Hollywood has ever had. And it has a lot of action and adventure that will capture your attention and you won't soon forget.

What also makes this movie so good is while the main story is fiction it is all based on an actual event that took place in China back in 1900, The Boxer Rebellion. It all started when a secret society made up mostly of peasants who were known as Boxers were trying to force all foreign countries and their dignitaries and military forces out of China. The Boxers surrounded the city of Peking and for 55 days they attacked and used sniper fire to try to force the foreigners to leave the city and China altogether. Finally back up forces arrived to quell the rebellion. A lot of what happens in the movie during the siege is based on actual events that took place during the Boxer Rebellion. Of course as you might expect some liberty is taken with the details to help make the plot more interesting and move it along a bit. Still it is a fairly accurate account of what happened.

As for the cast well you couldn't ask for better. Charlton Heston plays a major in the U.S. Marines who helps lead the military forces there to stop the rebels from breaking through their defensive lines. David Niven plays the British ambassador to China who rallies all the other foreign nations together to hold their ground and not let the Boxers force them out. Ava Gardner plays an Russian women of nobility who has a bit of a scandalous past and plays the love interest in the movie for Heston's character. They play their roles very well. The action parts in the movie are as good as the dramatic moments.

If there is one complaint I have it would be the same as what a couple of reviewers have mentioned. The picture quality is decent but not great. It looks like it was transferred onto DVD from a VHS tape. If there is a movie out there that could use some re-mastering it is this one. I am not saying you shouldn't get this. Just beware that the picture quality leaves a little to be desired. This is a good film to add to your movie collection. Especially since they don't make 'em like this anymore.",1445817600,2,2688,4.350597609561753

470455,5,6302424909,"This is a marvelous action-adventure movie about an incident that really occurred in Peking (Beijing) in 1900.  It's usually known as The Boxer Rebellion and happened when China was suffering from a lack of rain (and experiencing a real food shortage) and the fact that the various Western powers had carved up China into their own little colonies.

The story is mostly told from a Western point of view, though all the major historical reasons are mentioned from time to time as the story plays out.  But mostly it is an action movie showing lots of battles, some marvelous scenery and some great cinematography.  It was one of the better epic movies of the time.  I liked the characters portrayed too; there are some wonderful story lines that make the movie more enjoyable.

I have long had an interest in history and have enjoyed many an historical film.  I've learned to be cautious as far as the real history portrayed in them.  Here they actually do a better job than many, but the details are more about the fictitious characters than what really happened.

For the history, a simple online search for ""Boxer Rebellion"" will get you some more information about the real thing.  If the movie gets a few more people interested in an event that has been forgotten by many, so much the better.",1422403200,,1297,4.699115044247788

470516,4,6302424909,"Nicholas Ray's epic 55 DAYS AT PEKING stars Charlton Heston, Ava Gardner, David Niven and May Robson.

A really interesting action story that occurs during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, this is set mostly in a walled off part of Peking, China where people from a dozen Occidental nations (plus Japan) live. After diplomatic negotiations with their Chinese hosts fail, this area is attacked by overwhelming numbers of Boxer rebels who have tacit royal approval.

For some time prior, the Boxers had been killing white missionaries and any Chinese Christians. These acts of violence were the topic under discussion between emissaries of the several nations and the Chinese queen, who eventually informs them that all foreigners must leave China immediately. When her demand isn't met, the onslaught begins.

May Robson is great as the dowager queen, the last ruler of a long dynasty, and Ava Gardner is a Russian countess in love with American Marine major Heston who pays dearly for her efforts to help the hospitalzed victims of this ""rebellion.""

It's quite a show, and definitely recommended for all Chuck Heston fans.",1413331200,,1119,5.098360655737705

There is equal parts action, politics and human drama.  The film ends with the relief of the garrison, though the aftermath wasn't pretty either, making this a Western take on the subject.

The two tape VHS set has no built in intermission section if you are looking for one.

Although the movie producers did a little ""Hollywooding"" it up with the obligatory love interest, it is, nonetheless, surprisingly true to the facts about the real 55 days that the westerners held out against the Boxers, and the roles  the Dowedger Queen, her lead General  and her Prince played in the rebellion.

When placed in the Blu-ray player connected to a 1080 P flat screen TV the picture appears 720 at the most.  The film is in letterbox and supposedly in Technicolor but you can not appreciate it.

This 1963 epic drama takes place in Peking (today Beijing) China around the time of  1900 during the Boxer Rebellion.  A similar film, Sand Pebbles was created about the same time with the latter being filmed in Technicolor.  The contrast in the two films is vivid with the latter far more sharper in picture quality.  Although I enjoyed the story and felt the actors were believable as the characters, I found casting Caucasians as Chinese Asians poor taste.

470792,4,6302424909,"This 1963 Technicolor/Technirama epic movie deals with events leading up to the Boxer Rebellion of 1898 to 1901 though Wiki claims this picture focused specifically on 1900. For those who don't know the Boxer Rebellion was an attempt by some Chinese to expel from their country the foreign imperialists as well as Christianity. Note that I am giving an incredibly short explanation on a complex historical matter but don't want to turn this into a History lesson.

Charlton Heston is the leading man (the main military man for the Americans) opposite love interest, Ava Gardner (a baroness in the wrong place at the wrong time), and later
on Heston would claim she was difficult to work with per her unprofessional attitude.

The tale takes on a pressure cooker feel as various embassies defend themselves against the Boxers while awaiting a relief force from the Eight-Nation Alliance. There are several subplots along the main story and there's a lovable guilty pleasures melodrama feel to it all.

Also starring David Niven (as the British ambassador), John Ireland (as Sergeant Harry) and Flora Robson (as the Dowager Empress).

Spoilers below.

The film received two Academy Award nominations for Dimitri Tiomkin (Best Song and Original Music Score). Some of the music arguably borders on being jingoistic.
That said, the musical scores were well done and impressive to suit the epic scope.

This film is also the first known appearance of future martial arts film star Yuen Siu Tien (uncredited though).

Graded for its decade not by the standards of today. Old school intermissions, epilogues and forewards to be expected. People extremely sensitive to Eurocentric/American style films may take offense at how the Asians were portrayed.

STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B to B plus (includes juggling a large ensemble); CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B to B plus; EPIC SCOPE FEEL: B plus to A minus; HISTORICAL AUTHENTICITY: B minus; SOUND/MUSIC: B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: October 2012.

SPOILERS: Imperialistic question in which the Chinese dowager empress and her Boxer servants are seen as the evil ones. I doubt it would be a politically correct film today but if that doesn't bother you a lot it's a good film.

Racism is mentioned as something that just has to be dealt with (like the ""half breed"" child who doesn't fit into either world) and it's too bad if you're in the wrong group but in its defense that's how most people thought back around the time of the Boxer Rebellion who were white, I suspect. Historians mention we should not bring our times to the past and stay objective so again if this type of stuff bothers you skip the film.

About the only time one asks about whether they should be here or not is when the wife of Niven asks what are we doing here after a ""tragic"" moment when one of their children dies.

Wiki claims the failure of the Boxers in this instant foreshadowed the fall of the Qing Dynasty.",1360368000,,2961,4.923694779116466

470832,3,6302424909,"I was reading Diana Preston's THE BOXER REBELLION, and I thought to spice things up with some visual and auditory sensation.

As a stand-alone source of entertainment, however, forget it. 55 DAYS AT PEKING is long, boring, and antiquated. The acting and directing, the choreography, and just about everything else are not up to modern standards. But--if the reviews I read at Netflix were accurate--this particular Korean DVD is better than the one that I could have rented. Reportedly, the rented edition had washed-out color, and Chinese subtitles could not be disabled. The color on this Korean DVD is bright and solid, the widescreen resolution is good, and the added Dolby fidelity is very agreeable. You can disable subtitles, and the audio is of course English.

The Charlton Heston, Ava Gardner, and David Niven characters are fictional. I took no issue with that, nor with other fictional elements in the movie. A few characters are real, however; for example, the Dowager Empress and Prince Tuan.

Because the movie was filmed in Spain, I was surprised at the reasonably convincing Tartar wall, the towering wall that had to be defended on the south side of the American legation (a legation is called an ""embassy"" nowadays). Overall, the set direction, props, and costumes did what I wanted them too. They supplemented my reading with fairly accurate visual stimulation.

But if you want to tune in to some frightful, spine-tingling adventure, you should read Preston's book, which has the added quality of being a true story.",1351036800,2,1537,5.063241106719367

470876,3,6302424909,"There are several different products all tied into the 55 DAYS AT PEKING title. The next paragraph is specific to the BEST FILM and VIDEO tape of this picture.

It's a complete 155 minute dub of a film in good but not pristine condition. There's a few dirt spots visible occasionally, but no actual splices or breaks. Sound is HiFi. This tape, however, is dubbed at the SLOWEST speed. It tracks stably and image quality isn't bad at all.  (3 star rating is specifically for that SLP transfer.)

As for the movie:

Nicholas Ray's epic 55 DAYS AT PEKING stars Charlton Heston, Ava Gardner, David Niven and May Robson.

A really interesting action story that occurs during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, this is set mostly in a walled off part of Peking, China where people from a dozen Occidental nations (plus Japan) live. After diplomatic negotiations with their Chinese hosts fail, this area is attacked by overwhelming numbers of Boxer rebels who have tacit royal approval.

For some time prior, the Boxers had been killing white missionaries and any Chinese Christians. These acts of violence were the topic under discussion between emissaries of the several nations and the Chinese queen, who eventually informs them that all foreigners must leave China immediately. When her demand isn't met, the onslaught begins.

May Robson is great as the dowager queen, the last ruler of a long dynasty, and Ava Gardner is a Russian countess in love with American Marine major Heston who pays dearly for her efforts to help the hospitalzed victims of this ""rebellion.""

It's quite a show, and definitely recommended for all Chuck Heston fans.",1308528000,4,1633,4.912727272727273

470879,4,6302424909,"55 Days in Peking is quite the epic movie.  I was expected a sanitized version of the Chinese Boxer Rebellion and got a much darker film than I expected.

Charlton Heston plays the major in charge of the US forces.  David Niven a British ambassador.  There are several subplots of sneaky Russians and an over-sexed Baroness (played fairly well by Ava Garner).

The film looks at the Boxer Rebellion and the actual historic fact of many foreign factions holding their own against the Chinese Boxers (as they were called) who wanted to overthrow the foreign influence and take back their country.

In many ways I could see the Chinese dowager's point (she was a type of queen or princess of the Chinese Quin Dynasty) that she saw several foreign countries cutting up her country and serving it for their own purposes.  She said she was against the Boxers, but in actual fact was persuaded by one of her generals to use the Boxers to kill the foreigners.  David Niven played his part well as the British ambassador who tries to talk her out of violence and to discuss a peaceful solution.

The subplots abound and in some ways are confusing.  We have an 11 year old girl whose father is one of the American Marines.  He gets killed and Heston's character has to tell her that he just died and tries to comfort her.  This scene is fairly subdued and not as emotional as I was expecting.  Even so, the later scenes between her and Heston do put a smile on your face.  And I didn't cry which is quite a success!

The subplot of the British ambassador's wife wanting to leave and her own son is shot by a sniper's bullet!  Now that was intense!

And the Americans pulling off a coupe in destroying an ammo dump was exciting as well.

The film is very top-heavy in its battle scenes.  In fact the film is two-thirds battle scenes and you have to really give the Chinese credit for how they're attempting to get rid of the foreign powers - albeit in a deadly, bloody way - and I found myself rooting for them in some scenes.

Other scenes were confusing to me.  Why did the Dowager for example sue for peace, and then next scene we see hundred of Chinese storming the foreign buildings and its Imperial troops shooting cannons?  Maybe I need to see it again.

Overall, 55 Days in Peking may not be the most historically accurate of films that Hollywood put out in the 1960s, but it is certainly the most epic.  Heston is great and Ava Garner is a bit boring in the film.  David Niven really pulls it off.

The DVD I had did not have extras - it does include Chinese subtitles and the soundtrack won an Academy Award that year.

I only noticed this when I played in through my less expensive Home Theater system which has some cheaper speakers.  When I played it through my TV speakers you do not notice these problems so I am sure the audio quality will vary depending on what you play it on. I am going to play with it some more but these problems would not stop me from buying it again.

Charlton Heston and David Niven lead the charge, with Ava Gardner on hand to lend the glamour as a penniless Russian baroness.

The stars, David Niven, Charleton Heston and Ava Gardner were all first rate. The film is based on a true story which occurred prior to WWI and the fall of the last Chinese Dynasty. China was occupied by European, Japanese and American troops. Though America had no commercial interests in China, we maintained a delegation along with the other ""great powers"" of the time. It was based in Peking in feudal style walled fortress. The film focuses on the Boxer Rebellion, a grass roots revolt against the ""foreign devils"" and the impotent Chinese monarchy. The Boxers had begun to attack foreign troops throughout China and began a seige of the diplomatic compound in Peking. It lasted for 55 days. The diplomats were protected by only a few hundred troops of many nations vs thousands of Boxers. Yet they managed to survive and were eventually relieved after almost 8 weeks by an ""allied"" army.

In fact, they just don't make 'em like this anymore!

Particularly memorable are the opening scenes in which each of the foreign legations at Peking--including the British, French, German, American, Russian, and Japanese [all the usual suspects] are raising their flags at dawn, to a cacophony of competing national anthems (a scene echoed at the end, when after pulling together for 55 days against a common enemy--the Harmonious Fists, or Boxers--the besieged foreigners revert ominously to their separatist ways. Equally interesting are the scenes in the beautifully recreated Forbidden City at the court of the Manchu Empress, whom the incomparable Flora Robsen invests with sympathy as well as inscrutability. Robert Helpmann, the great premier danseur of the Royal Ballet, plays the sinister prince Tuan, and Leo Genn performs the role of his rival, the general Wen Lu (who has conducted a secret love affair with the enchanting Russian Countess [Gardner]), whose reputation has been consequently ruined [It seems to me that some of Genn's scenes have unfortunately been cut or lost with the passage of time].

The transfer to DVD is sharp and does not seem to have diminished in color, and the sound is excellent with one important exception.

470946,3,6302424909,"""55 Days at Peking"" is the story of the Boxer Rebellion in China, in the summer of the year 1900, where the violent wind of discontent disturbs the land...

Separated from the foreign compound by a mere wall and a gate is the Forbidden City, where, in untouchable isolation, Empress Dowager Tzu--protected by an army of eunuchs--earnestly advises Sir Arthur (David Niven) that all foreign residents, including diplomatic personnel, to leave Peking within 24 hours...

For the Empress of China (Flora Robson), the situation in Peking cannot be expected to become tranquil because of the projected draught, because of hunger and unrest among the people, because of the merciless demands of the foreign powers... Prince Tuan (Robert Helpmann) counsels the empress a reckless adventure, while Gen. Jung-Lu (Leo Genn) counsels prudence and patience...

That morning, Sir Arthur came to the Imperial Palace with the truth, the truth that is already known to the German government, and to all other powers, asking the empress to take action against Prince Tuan who commanded the Boxers to drag and kill the German minister...

Obviously, the empress rejected Sir Arthur's truth and his protest, informing him that Prince Tuan is her closest and most trusted adviser and she appointed him to head the foreign office... The ambassadors realizing now that Prince Tuan succeeded in getting the support of the empress, vote on whether to stay or leave Peking...

Niven demonstrated both his capacity and his potential as the English diplomat with no intention of displaying fear of the Boxers, nor of handling the victory to Prince Tuan...

Ava Gardner looks beautiful as the Russian Baroness who knows that her sublime trinket sure glitters...

Lynne Sue Moon steals the show in her moving portrayal of the abandoned Oriental 12-year-old child in need of love and care and who has been promised, by her father, to be taken home to America... Her best scene comes at the climax of the movie when Heston-- riding out at the head of his Army--stops, looks down at the girl, and says, ""Here, take my hand."" He pulls her upon his horse and they ride together out of Peking...

Nicholas Ray's direction and the actors' performance appear sincere enough... Those merely looking for an epic spectacle are likely not to get satisfaction from it as a motion picture... In spite of its aspirations, ""55 Days in Peking"" isn't enough to keep us engaged, while, there's no denying, succeeded in entertaining us for a while...",1232755200,3,2500,5.021739130434782

Also, I teach in China at least four months per year at the graduate and doctoral levels, so I have some experiential objectivity on which to rely.  Naturally, this does not mean that my evaluations carry any more weight that those of others.  However, by taking a variety of History courses at the foreign university, I discovered that versions of historical events do indeed vary considerably from country to country.

As do others, when I review films for Amazon.com, I do have some entertainment biases, and one of those biases is that of ""reality.""  This film does indeed present the Chinese (to a more limited degree) and US cases during the Boxer Rebellion, especially those involving dealing with the rampant colonialism that drove the crisis.  The Chinese court intrigue that led to the instigation and pursuit of the rebellion is quite apparent in the film, as reflected in the dialogue between the Empress Dowager, Ci Xi, and ""Prince Yuan,"" who is actually the famous Yuan Shi-Kai, who later became a powerful figure in China.

But while the film does noticably drag a bit in places, it is an exciting, well-acted and well-made story that will definitely pique the interests of viewers. Many viewers may even want to read up on the Boxer Rebellion and gain an understanding of what was at stake there.  The climactic final scenes are a bit ""over-the-top,"" in terms of the staging of the various foreign forces marching to the rescue, but is ""symbolic"" of the outcome.

470986,4,6302424909,"I am very fond of this movie, even though it is far from perfect.  It is overblown and tries too hard to be an ""epic"", but at the same time drags in spots and edges into melodrama.  Still, despite its faults, I enjoy watching it again everytime.  It is entertaining, and I appreciate that in a movie.  It also has a surprising amount of humor that is quite good.
The performances are fine, especially from David Niven, the setting is grand in scope and the action scenes work, mostly.  The last big action scene does not do a good job of establishing the geography so we have a hard time determining who is fighting who and where.

While the movie is worth seeing, the DVD is disappointing.  There are no extras and the video and audio quality are just adequate.  It is obvious that this DVD was produced with the least cost and effort possible.  The DVD is not so bad as to be unwatchable, but it could be better and does not do justice to the movie.",1201737600,19,951,4.297752808988764
470987,5,6302424909,"First of all, everybody reading this should read all the reviews about this movie.  I started to write a scalding statement about political correctness (twice now...I deleted both) but have changed my mind.  I would like to say on the subject of historical accuracy about 55 Days at Peking I seem to remember one of the survivors wrote the novel and would suggest you read that.  I wish I had.  Oh well, everybody has their opinion--and so do I, a nobody--but you will find most peoples opinion are worth just what they cost to hear...absolutly nothing.

That said, on with the review.

PROS:

1.  It stars Charlton Heston, the cutie Ava Gardner, and THE David Niven.  That's a star right there.

2.  Somewhat tightly written with a few sub plots that don't really get in the way.  That's a star.

3.  The actors can act.  That's another star.

4.  Obviously the Director can direct.  That is a star.

5.  The idea is a sound one.  That's a star.  The United States, and ten other of the worlds superpowers are involved with China at the beginning of the twentieth century.  Apparently most of the super powers at that time want to divide China up amongst themselves...as I understand -- from the movie, not actual history books --  neither the Americans or British wanted any of their lands or to occupy their country.  Beats me, I wasn't there.  Nevertheless, we are there when the radical factions of China rise up--all countries have leftist radicals, we do to.  And of course the director is showing most of the country wasn't like that.  In fact they were showing most of China was full of good people and from the opening scenes and music you might gain the idea it was a tranquil place to live.  (I remember hearing--decades ago in my many wonderings around this world, when our forces finally entered the 'compound' they asked the Americans inside if they heard their bugles.  That they sent many calvery charges in an attempt to break through enemy lines.  That several of them fell short by only a couple miles.  But once again I wasn't there and I haven't read that survivors book--so I don't know.  Anyway I think you should read the book to be sure.  Afterall, he was there and saw and heard the whole thing--not us and not the people who wrote the history books.  Besides that, you remember the historic notes about the Alamo?  I heard that lady who was one of the survivors said they never even asked her what happened until 22 years later!  Not to scratch up an old wound, mind you...but I never go by offical history from either side, I usually go by the eyewitness reports.)

six.  Plently of battle scenes and they appear to be accurate.  The dress of all sides seems accurate--but of course I wouldn't know, I wasn't there.  The uniforms of us Americans I think are accurate.  By the way when I say the battle scenes appear accurate, I don't mean historically--darn it I wish I'd read that book before I wrote this!  Anyway, plently of heroics to go around from all nations...hard to believe seventeen years or so later that same bunch is out on the battlefield killing each other.  Oh well.  The best ideas seem to die young and the stupid ones seem to go on an on and on until another war starts.

Ah let's cut this short.

It's a fine movie leaning toward great.  I recommend it, I bought it.  Do the same and write your own review.

Buy it, don't rent--and you might get the book so you can do a better job than me.  Bye!",1180828800,5,3446,4.495145631067961

An all-star cast tells the tale of the siege by the Boxers (a fanatical quasi-religious organization) of the Western nations embassys in Peking.  Great battle scenes and lots of political intrigue.  I remember seeing this as a young boy in the 1970's and I still find it to be a powwrful movie.  The politically correct crowd will not enjoy it but if you like history and action this is a must see!!!,1142985600,3,615,4.666666666666667
470989,5,6302424909,"Reviewers should quit nit-picking political correctness (see reviews of the VHS version).  The motion picture is about an actual event, i.e., the defense of the foreign quarter (the embassies and such) during the Boxer Rebellion in China.  Sure, there is literary license, and some events are shown differently than they actually occurred, but isn't that true of most motion pictures about historical events (""Braveheart,"" for example, drastically warped some points of history creating impossible relationships).

This film is spectacular, and has its moments, but all is not fun and games.  The young son of the British ambassador is killed by a Chinese sniper, the German ambassador is killed (OK, so in reality he was shot, but allow the producer a little latitude), the countess is killed, and an American marine is killed leaving an orphan daughter.

Keep in mind when watching the motion picture that it was produced to make money.  Dry historical accounts generally are not successful in that regard.  The film may depart a little from actual history, but maybe not that much.  The Boxers were an anti-foreign movement in China, and they did murder missionaries who were trying to spread western religions in China.  If they would have left it at that, they might have survived, but attacking embassies was a diplomatic no-no.  The western powers (Germany, Japan, Russia, England, the United States, etc.) used that as an excuse for armed intervention and demanding concessions.

Keep in mind that foreign traders were making money selling opium to Chinese, and you can understand some of the animosity.  It would be like Columbian drug cartels using force of arms to demand their right to sell cocaine in the U.S.  But putting the political correctness aside, it is a very good film about an event that happened.  You might also watch ""Khartoum"" about the battle between Muslim religious fanatics and British colonialism.

Colonists are never popular, and we are still experiencing the ill effects of James I of England planting protestant colonies of Scots in Ulster.",1139616000,83,2077,5.1398809523809526

471019,2,6302424909,"In different times of different tastes, the events of the 1900 Peking siege might have made a decent movie, even if again presented as excuse for historically inspired drivel. To the misfortune of both history and movie watchers, 55 Days at Peking was filmed amidst the sixties craze for grand scale extravaganza.  The result is cinema so atmospheric one yearns for an oxygen tube in the throat to counteract sensations of drowning from the humidity.

The time, place, and events lend themselves well to sixties epic. Between picture postcard wide-angle shots of The Exotic East, we are immersed in full dress parades of tasseled soldiers, a formal ball with gowns and glitter, lush silken tunics embroidered with dragons, fiery battle scenes, and further endless cinematic candy. This is film to be appreciated by those attracted to any brand of babble spoken beneath cloaks of braided uniforms and foreign cityscape. Indeed, the set designer and wardrobe master deserve credit as the real stars of 55 Days.

Competing for star billing is a soundtrack probably once hailed for richness, but which today sounds over-music'd to distraction. This could perhaps have been a good thing were the score less obvious. Attempts to flavor the film in ""oriental"" sound frequently recall the Wicked Witch's guards singing ""Yo-Hee-Ho"" in the Land of Oz. When French sailors leap over a barricade with drawn swords, we hear La Marseillaise interspersed with the orchestral drums and horns. In turn the score shouts similar unimaginative tinsel for each of the other nationalities under siege. Although this is very well written music, it's spawned from hackneyed conceptions of what that music should embody.

The movie is excellently cast as the roles could have been written specifically for each of the nominal stars. Heston plays a down and dirty marine major. Ava Gardner has her usual role of sensitive local slut. Niven is the suave level-headed British ambassador. Each punched the clock and turned in a good days work, predictably living up to type, identical to countless performances before and since with no distinguishing variation from their norm. The characters however are by no means one-dimensional -- most possess at least one and a half; the main cast often exhibits two.
Asians in 55 Days are depicted as a generic alien breed accoutered with expansive cartoon gestures and fortune-cookie dialog, sometimes varied with the folded-arm, hopping gait of coolies from 1950s television. It will look authentic to anyone living in East Rootbeer County.

As an action/adventure movie, the story is not terribly written, and is very well photographed. The battle scenes offer consistent pleasure for those so inclined.  The dialog often shows ability to turn the odd memorable phrase. As I take this film to be more fiction than not, I'm unwilling to condemn it for historical inaccuracy. The story however often gnaws the leash of credulity, as when Her Majesty's Ambassador Niven dons his grubbies to crawl a sewer beneath enemy lines to torch an ammo dump.

In their dreams, the makers of 55 Days probably wanted to create a movie which felt like a lazy-man's Lawrence of Arabia. The film valiantly attempts a look of dramatic intelligence. Through exhaustive emphasis on set, costume, music, and a reliable cast of big names marking time, 55 Days squanders its efforts on the external vestments of grand scale epic, with little remaining energy to explore what flesh may lie beneath.",1109030400,10,3487,5.128521126760563

And evidently if you add to this a nice and misterious Russian countess, a poor orphan girl and a scientific priest those 55 days will pass faster.

Samuel Bronston was in the 60's one of the aces the Generalisimo had to show to the world that even a country like Spain could have glamour. He build  in Chamartin  a big studio with dozens of sets trying to compite with the Italian Cinecitta. And after the Cid this project was his new jewel to the crown.

To make an epic film you need an epic actor, and this means that you can have Charlton Heston, or you can have....Charlton Heston. But he is not the only right election in this film. Ava Gardner is splendid as the countess trying to survive in a city where strangers are surrounded by the Boxer menace. Who could play a better British ambassador than that charming man who was David niven? or being a more helpful priest that that wonderful Harry Andrews?

But the best, in my humble opinion is the trio of the Chinese characters. Flora Robson, Leo Genn and Robert Helpmann are splendid. I have to say that specially Flora Robson. A wonderful actress that belongs to that glorious club of the supporting actresses.

The film is a nice one that , even full of historical faults, and a funny insistence of showing every now and then the Spanish ambassadro without any reason, has certainly great moments like the night assault of the Imperial army to the legation area, or the subtil and wicked scene between Heston and Ava at the hotel, among with the sweet scene when Heston must tell the daughter of Capt. Andy he is death.

The score is magnificent, and is Dimitri Tiomkin at his best, but also the locations are great. (Although I have always wondered how they managed to find so many orientals in Madrid in the 60's)

471024,4,6302424909,"""55 Days At Peking"" is an unusual and enjoyable epic and star vehicle. Not least among its admirable characteristics is a set re-creating in Spain an authentic impression of the old Legation Quarter of Peking. The set makes sense to anyone who knows the actual site in modern-day Beijing. That was a considerable achievement in the pre-digital cinematic art of illusion.  It shows, too, that there was a great deal of China knowledge and empathy behind the making of the movie.

Well into the 21st century, many Boxer Rebellion-era structures have survived in the old Legation Quarter of Beijing, the area immediately east of Tiananmen Square. Due to enduring political and cultural sensitivities, the historical significance of these structures is unsignposted and ignored by the official Chinese tourist authorities. Most of the area is occupied by Chinese Government organisations.  The gate of the former British Legation which was recreated for the movie may still be seen just off Chang'an Avenue in Zhengyi Street, at the rear of the massive new Ministry of Public Security building, a short walk southwest from the Beijing Hotel.  The layout and other striking architectural features of the area are well-recorded in books such as Michael J. and Yeone Wei-Chih Moser's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foreigners-within-the-Gates-The-Legations-at-Peking/dp/1932476318/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foreigners within the Gates: The Legations at Peking</a>&nbsp;(Oxford 1993).

The movie takes a few liberties with history for dramatic purposes -- overplaying a little, for instance, the US military contribution compared to some other national contingents, and making the British Minister (the fictional character Sir Arthur Robertson, played by David Niven) more militarily involved than the actual British Minister, Sir Claude MacDonald, appears in contemporary accounts of the siege of the legations. A Japanese Colonel, Shiba Goro   1860-1945, widely acknowledged as the most valuable senior military contributor in the actual defence of the legations, is depicted with his real name as the character Colonel Shiba, played by Japanese actor Juzo Itami. Historical perfectionists might get picky about details like the US Marines carrying the wrong rifle (see end note) or the casting of generally well made-up famous Caucasian actors in major Chinese roles. Some of the strangest casting from any modern audience viewpoint is the Australian ballet dancer, actor and producer Robert Helpmann as the chief villain, Prince Tuan (based on the historical Prince Tuan  1856-1922), and Dame Flora Robson as the Dowager Empress Cixi (Tzu Hsi)  1835-1908. Helpmann and Robson were such fine actors that they succeed in creating an impression of characters very different from their usual roles. Standard caveats apply that this is an entertainment based on history, not a documentary, and it is a product of its time. Great Chinese talent like Chow Yun-Fat, John Lone, Gong Li, Zhang Yimou, Wayne Wang, Jiang Wen and countless others now well known, wasn't available to western moviemakers in 1963. ""55 Days At Peking"" is a worthy impression of an historical episode when China warred by proxy on the rest of the world. It is an interesting film to compare with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Khartoum/dp/B000062XF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Khartoum</a>&nbsp;(1966), in which Charlton Heston also plays the lead, as part of the canon of epic moviemaking about imperial and colonial wars. Heston's character, Major Matt Lewis, is loosely based on John Twiggs Myers USMC 1871-1952, who was, indeed, a genuine hero of the siege, in the thick of some of the most desperate fighting on the city wall as the officer in charge of the US Marines guard of the US Legation. Myers ended his distinguished 47-year career in the US Marine Corps with the rank of Lieutenant General.

The casting and illusion of China in this era of moviemaking compares with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Inn-of-the-Sixth-Happiness/dp/B00008LDO1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Inn of the Sixth Happiness</a>&nbsp;(1958), in which Robert Donat plays a Chinese mandarin, Curt Jurgens plays a Chinese Army officer, and Wales substitutes for China. It would be fascinating to see a remake of this film with a re-worked story and script, a re-arrangement of Dimitri Tiomkin's excellent score, digital technology, and cross-cultural casting and direction.  It probably still could not be shot in China without treading on the corns of Chinese official and public sensitivities about the painful past of unequal treaties and foreign incursions, or the gloss cast over activities of the Boxers and other more ancient Chinese secret societies from which they derived. Any such film actually made in China therefore would be a significant milestone in China's steady cultural, artistic and intellectual evolution while it continues the most extensive global engagement in its history.

The original film will always stand as a fine example of its genre. Back in the 1990s it was released on VHS and a letterboxed Laserdisc, and has appeared in several DVD versions, the best of which I have seen is a region 2 anamorphic 2.35:1 PAL Dutch import by Video/Film Express that I bought through Amazon.co.uk. The soundtrack of this Dutch DVD is the English original, and its Dutch subtitles are easily turned off. ""55 Days At Peking"" is overdue for a new full digital restoration for Blu-ray release, with extra features aimed at collectors and film buffs.

End notes: The rifles used by the US Marines in the film are the British .303 Lee Enfield (the ""Long Lee Enfield"" Mark 1* model introduced in 1899). Contemporary photographs show the US Marines guard of the US Legation in Peking during the Boxer Rebellion were armed with the 6mm M1895 Lee Navy straight-pull bolt-action rifle, manufactured by Winchester. Clearly, and understandably, the movie armorers were unable to source enough of these unusual and hard-to-find M1895 Lee rifles to equip their Marines. Fallback to the Long Lee Enfield, a rifle of the same era, with a different turn-bolt action and box magazine also based on a design by Scottish-Canadian-American inventor James Paris Lee (1831-1904), might have appealed as a professional pun to the movie armorers.",1010102400,44,6421,5.614035087719298
471025,3,6302424909,"When I first saw this film as a child, I was offended by it, being an Asian-American of Filipino/Chinese descent.  However, seeing it now, with the understanding that this film was made during the height of the Cold War & the beginnings of the War in Vietnam, I can understand why it was made (though I still don't agree with it's political point of view!)
First, for general viewers who just want to see a well made, big-budget war picture with hints of romance, then this movie does deliver on that level.  Charleton Heston is excellent as a flawed, temperamental loner & professional soldier who falls for Eva Gardner, a ""fallen woman"" of Russian nobility, while the foreign ""legations"" in Peking (what we would today call ""embassies"") are under attack by the Boxer Rebels (I Ho Chuan Society) during the rebellion of 1900 in China.  David Niven is likeable as the British ambassador, even though he does come off as a bit pompous.  The sets & costumes are well-done (especially when you consider that this film, set during the last days of the Ching Dynasty in China, was actually shot in Spain!), & the battle sequences are realistically staged.  (For martial-arts buffs, there's even a martial-arts demonstration during the birthday of the English Queen!)  So, if all you're looking for is a fast-paced war picture with great costumes & macho action performances, then, on that level only, this film delivers.
If you're a history buff, however, then this film definately is not for you!  For one thing, all of the major European characters, (whose point of view this movie favors) are fictional characters.  The only real-life historical figures are the ruling Manchus (played by caucasian actors in ""Asian-face!"") & the Japanese Colonel Goro Shiba.  (He & the other Japanese are played by real Asian actors.  I guess during the Cold War, the Japanese were our allies against ""the Red Menace"", thus worthy of respect, while the Chinese, who were Communists, were not worthy of respect when portrayed on film.  But then, this movie also features the Russians in a positive light, so go figure!)  There is also a scene where the German minister is killed on the street by a mob of crazed Boxers, but in real life, the real German minister was shot by a Chinese officer (one man!) who was sympathetic to the Boxer cause.  This film also carefully omits the subsequent rape & sacking of Peking after the defeat of the Boxers, though focusing heavily on the Boxer's depredations against Christians & foreigners.  (True history is balanced, not one-sided.)  Lastly, according to this film, the British & Americans were in charge of the relief efforts during the siege.  Actually, the Germans, under von Waldersee, were the real leaders of the International Relief Force sent out to defeat the Boxers & rescue the besieged legations.
Finally, for Asian-americans & viewers interested in serious political debate, this film is also a no no!  The most obviously offensive aspect of this movie is the white actors playing Chinese (though  again, this was made in 1963), but the other offensive aspect is that this film favors the colonialists' point of view!  (The basic point of 55 Days is, colonialism is good & whenever natives fight back, they deserve to be supressed!  It's the same kind of thinking that got us involved in Vietnam.)  This movie was made during the beginnings of our involvement in Southeast Asian politics & it's obvious that this ""historical"" drama is really a pro-Vietnam propaganda film disguised as an epic action-movie!
Okay, the ""Boxers"" (or I Ho Society) were not saints.  They did murder a lot of innocent people in their anger over the semi-colonialism imposed by the West & Japan on China during the 19th Century.  But this film shows only one point of view.  (A bad story-telling style for a supposedly ""realistic"" war picture.)  However, for viewers who want to get a balanced point of view in one film about the Boxer Rebellion, well, good luck!  Chinese movies on the subject tend to do the exact extreme political opposite of 55 Days (which is just as bad!)  And remember, though there are historical inaccuracies in 55 Days, Chinese movies (or more accurately, Hong Kong movies) can be just as inaccurate about their own culture!  Check out any of the '70's Shaw Brothers kung-fu films if you don't believe me!
So in closing, personally, I would recommend watching this film, but only if you understand it's (many) flaws.  For a truly balanced perspective on the subject, after watching 55 Days At Peking, check out The Boxer Rebellion/Bloody Avengers, a Shaw Brothers kung-fu flick about the Boxer Rebellion which exaggerates the Chinese p.o.v. at least as much (if not more) as 55 Days exaggerates the European/Japanese p.o.v.  The real-truth lies right in-between these two films.  Be sure you get the letter-boxed version of 55 Days, because the pan & scan really cuts out some important details (more so than other films.)",1009670400,9,4962,4.913669064748201
