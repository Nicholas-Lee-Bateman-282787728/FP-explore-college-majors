5356828,4,B009NP1ZR0,"I still gave this film four stars because the performances are great, the premise is creative,
and the first half of the film is stellar.

There is one brilliant scene, right at the beginning of the film, where you see a reflection
of ""hooded children"" reflecting on a car door, followed by an equally brilliant elevator scene.
Beautifully shot and acted, these scenes set the pace for an exceptional first half of the film.

I loved the idea of this main character dealing with acute agoraphobia, and the visuals that come out
of that fear.
You see things and hear things, and you become situated in the same state this poor man is in.

Without giving too much away, the film is top notch straight through an unforgettable bus/transit scene.
Soon after, it becomes more of a scripted, ""Kill and rescue"" type plot, which sort of let me down, after
such a strong, intense, emotional first half.

I'd still recommend this picture, without hesitation, for those that enjoy a more cerebral horror experience.",1359590400,2,1004,4.786127167630058
5356829,5,B009NP1ZR0,"Citadel is one of those films that jumps off the screen. The atmosphere created oozes with everything a horror movie should be. The cinematic brilliance is the way the film is shot. The camera moves and pans in-sighting a feeling of paranoia, which in a film detailing an agoraphobic is simply inspired.

When Tommy Cowley's life is turned upside down by a random attack on him and his pregnant wife he not only is left to raise his infant daughter alone, he is also debilitated by extreme agoraphobia. Tommy spends his time hiding out in his apartment and attending intense therapy sessions. When the same gang that attacked him before comeback and seemingly intend on kidnapping his daughter his fears are only heightened. Tommy must now conquer his fears to save himself and his newborn daughter.

The film and story line move quickly with hardly any wasted time or breath. I strongly recommend for anyone that likes their horror on the psychological thriller side of things, this one won't disappoint. After it's all said and done you may find yourself double checking behind every corner! You've been warned.",1359590400,4,1113,4.914893617021277

But there was also a message about faith, not just spiritual faith, but faith in yourself and what strength that has.  But the message wasn't hitting you in the face, so if you chose to ignore it, the movie was entertaining.

Citadel is a suspenseful yet also touching journey of how Tommy overcomes agoraphobia and tragedy (losing his wife) as he sets out on a mission with the priest and young boy Danny to defeat the group of feral children that attacked his wife and kidnapped his baby daughter Elsa. Through protecting young Danny, Tommy gains the strength to overcome his own fears.

5356867,4,B009NP1ZR0,Citadel delves deep into the dark and sinister realm of social collapse. As a neighborhood goes through slow rehabilitation a twisted reality unfolds. Savage and untamed youths lay siege to a tower block in the community killing anyone who crosses their path and stealing the children. The story has a sort of melancholic atmosphere which pulls at your emotions as it draws you into the story. It flows from moments of casual melodrama and intense suspensefulness that makes most of the scenes feel for intense than they really are. It creates an almost nervous anticipation for during most of the film. It is a truly dark story which expresses a lot of emotion and desperation as a movie goer watching the story unfold that is an added bonus. The revealing cause of the vicious nature of the youths terrorizing the community is truly sinister but could have been played up a little more than it is in the movie. There is a slight imbalance between the slower more emotional scenes and the intense thrill scenes. However not enough of an issue to not find this movie pleasurable. It is disturbing and kind of twisted. I really enjoyed the more vulnerable and heartfelt approach to horror this film takes.,1433462400,,1204,4.793269230769231

Wife gives birth after the attack but is in a coma at first. Our protagonist fears an attack on himself and their baby by the same group of entities.

Usual dumb decisions to prolong the thrills and our hoodies seem to be a little more evil than at first thought. A lot of holes in the story with absurd decision making. Cheap mask props as the scary part. Acting was OK. The cheapest part of the movie was lack of producer/studio recognition that regional and international English dialects make it difficult to understand (somewhat important) what the characters are saying and when coupled with no subtitles, poor enunciation, poor audio control/level results in half the story being lost.",1384560000,,856,4.986013986013986

However, I've never seen anything like this movie, there was no $50 Million budget or mind blowing CGI, just a great plot and an atmosphere that draws you in. Granted the idea of being stalked by a bunch of twisted, disfigured kids may need seem scary but in this regard it actually was. The directing in this movie was great, I actually felt as if I could relate to the main character and feel his pain, fear and sorrow.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a somewhat original movie, you'll like it and afterwards maybe even feel a little paranoid, LOL.

5356900,5,B009NP1ZR0,"I love horror films that use real-world issues as their basis.  A few days ago, I reviewed 6 SOULS, a dark movie that dealt with multiple personality disorders.  Today I offer you CITADEL, an extremely effective trip into terror that uses agoraphobia (basically, the fear of going outside) as its foundation.  Taut and disturbing, this film will take you to the edge of horror and then push you over.

This movie kept me tense and on-edge throughout its entirety.  The aspect of Tommy's baby girl in danger along with him only made the movie more intense, and I actually had to stand up a couple of times while watching the film because I was so nervous.  This is exactly the kind of reaction a horror movie is supposed to give, and CITADEL offers plenty of reasons to give them.

The film is shot well and the production value looks very high.  It is a collaboration between Ireland and UK film companies, and every facet of the film looks excellent onscreen.

I am particularly impressed with the acting in CITADEL.  Aneurin Barnard portrays the main character, Tommy, and does a stunning job in the role.  His wide emotional range and vivid attention to detail are a sight to behold.  He doesn't just play Tommy, he is Tommy.  Also noteworthy is James Cosmo, the iconic actor who portrays the priest.  I enjoyed his work in GAME OF THRONES and SONS OF ANARCHY, so it is a joy to see him here.

CITADEL is a huge win for me and I would wager any fan of horror and/or thrillers will enjoy it.  Be prepared for a heck of ride, though; this is not a film that you can sit idly through.  The film is available now, so give it a look for sure.",1372982400,4,1640,4.413333333333333

5356904,2,B009NP1ZR0,"Tommy (Aneurin Barnard) is helpless as his pregnant wife (Amy Shiels) is attacked by a gang of hoodlums. This isn't any ordinary gang, but one that apparently kidnaps children and can smell fear, but ""can't see you."" He believes they are after his child and is forced to face his fears and the killer children in the ""Citadel"" an abandoned apartment high rise. He is aided by a priest (James Cosmo) and a blind boy named Danny (Jake Wilson).

At some point in time I had to question if the creatures were real or Tommy's imagination. In one scene they break out a car window, then as they drive to another location, it is fixed. So I had to question if this was a plot point meaning the children were imaginary or just a sloppy production.

The film is all about Tommy's fear and did little to frighten me. It is a film you can take a nap in the middle of it, wake up and know what is going on. The actors did a fine job, I just found the film rather slow.

5356905,4,B009NP1ZR0,"Yes, it truly IS a terrifying little film. A man, his wife, their baby are victimized by a group of SEEMINGLY human, youngsters. This, in a rather run-down, bleak-looking, grayish apartment complex, in Ireland; with the cold, dreary, by-the-looks-of-it, always cloudy weather, not helping matters any, in terms of 'cheeriness.'

'Spoilers,' ahead, by the way, I should mention. Here's one of them, to start: The wife doesn't make it. No, she is assaulted, quite early in the story, by a group of three young hooligans, while her husband, the protagonist, is in the apartment elevator. Looking through a window. Viewing his wife's imminent demise. A scary scene, to be sure, well filmed. She is, due to the assault, put into a coma, never to wake again.

Yet her baby survives. And this is where the story essentially, 'takes off.' As her husband, now dwelling in a new apartment unit, cannot figure why the young 'monsters' who killed his wife, are still coming after him, and his baby. Staking about, outside his unit. Breaking windows. Generally scaring the he#@ out of both the protagonist, and us, the viewing audience. And attempting access to his apartment and apparently, to his child. The answer, in a rather vague way, is forthcoming.

He garners emotional support, after his wife's funeral, from a nurse friend. She is of the opinion, that the attack on his family was a mere 'random occurrence.' And that the perpetrators are more than likely in need of love, rather than, say death, or imprisonment - as, she contends, far too many would have it. A faulty judgement on her part. Which we see played out, in a horrific scene in a tunnel, as the film progresses...

It does not go well for her.

The protagonist also receives help - yet in a different manner - from the priest who attended his wife's funeral. He, the priest, in contrast to the nurse, is of the opinion that the monstrous children in question, may not even be human. And that they certainly must be dealt with in a harsher manner - to put it mildly - than the nurse believed. In fact, he'd like to see the dilapidated building in which they dwell, burnt to the ground.

This contrast between opinions on the nature of the creatures, is what constructs ONE of the two major themes presented in the film. The first being that, as we see played out before us, as the priest believes, evil truly DOES exist. And must be fought, battled against, as opposed to being dealt with, as the nurse contends, with love. The second theme? That fear is the root of evil; and must be faced and overcome, for that evil to be 'squashed.' That is the job of our protagonist. I'll leave you to watch, to find if he succeeds, or fails, in that job.

And yes, I'd say it's worth viewing to find out. As the film is EXTREMELY well directed. Not too much, 'jerking of the camera', Blair-Witch style. Which, of course, has been one of the primary tools used in most low-budget horror films of late; particularly since the financial success of the Paranormal Activity films. A tool which, in my personal opinion is NOT 'edgy.' Not, engaging in any way. In fact, one which causes more dizzy spells and headaches in an audience, than alleged, 'fear.' And a tool which, if I had any input on the matter, I'd say, 'ought to be 'placed on the shelf,' of film-making history - permanently.'

More on the direction: Yes, good, minimalistic, simple camera work. Also: Excellent use of a minimalistic soundtrack, to match. Not overbearing. Not 'bombastic' or cartoon-like, in any way. Generally subdued. So that when it IS used, it is effective. And it is used, in all the right places. Nonexistent, during scenes of the commonplace. Menacing, low, disturbing, discordant, in scenes featuring the stalking, predator children. Scenes which ARE truly well-done, I might add. With the 'little monsters' always seemingly just out of full view. Just visible out of the peripheral, 'corner of the eye.' Scary indeed. And the soundtrack is boosted, perceptibly, during the moments of final confrontation between protagonist and priest, and their adversaries, the 'monster children.'

All in all? Great soundtrack. Great, minimalistic use of camera, to match theme, locale, and overall story-line. AND, excellent, convincing performances by protagonist, priest, nurse, and 'creatures themselves.'

The one, perhaps, 'hole' in the film's construction? Well, I'd say it has to do with our knowing weather or not these creatures ARE truly inhuman, demonic, or weather they are simply victims of a society which has thrown them away; into 'gutters' like the falling-apart complex, the 'Citadel.' You see, if it's the latter, then these characters tend to garner, with me personally, anyway - and I believe, with most of Man - sympathy from us, the audience. Yet if it's the former? Well then: I'm with the priest. No ambiguity there. The creatures must be dealt with, in the harshest possible manner. 'Cut out like my own cancer' as he puts it, at one point, pointing to a growth on his forearm.

And this is the problem: We, the audience, receive mixed signals as to the inherent, nature of the creatures. Are they demonic, and in need of destruction, by our priest character, and protagonist? Or are they, as the nurse suggests, simply victims of an inhuman, non-empathetic, society? In which case they might require, simply a bit of, 'remedial behavior modification.' The question is never satisfactorily answered. Either way however, the fact that we, the audience, are in question about the matter, dissipates the film's previously, rather palpable, well drawn, sense of fear. A fear which, though well-created by the writer/director, might be even more convincing, compelling, and less ambiguous, were the creatures CLEARLY inhuman; and NOT, perhaps, worthy of potential sympathy - by even the most empathetic members of our viewing audience.

The good news? The question as to the nature of the villainous children here, does not alter the notion that the protagonist must learn to overcome his own fear, in dealing with them. And that is, I'd say, the primary theme of the film. The idea that one cannot move forward at all, without confronting, overcoming one's fear. The secondary theme being that evil, as the priest character reveals, DOES likely exist. And cannot be 'bargained' with, in any way.

So. Overall? A VERY well-directed, terrifying in places, little film. Great performances, excellent work, by all involved. A piece of work which stays beautifully, within its means, and the confines of its plot. Doesn't go for cheap thrills, loud soundtrack,  digital alteration of any sort, or what I'd call 'obnoxious camera-work,' to create its well-drawn, disturbing little mood. Also, more than a few truly horrific moments. Particularly as the protagonist is stalked in his new abode, by the relentless, seemingly inhuman predators. I'll be VERY much looking forward to the next film by writer/director, C. Foy. And I do recommend this one, highly. A very good one. Just short of being, 'superlative.' And time well-spent. I'd suggest only an even clearer 'argument' as to the true nature of the villain. And, perhaps, that nature - that answer - CLEARLY being one, NOT potentially garnering sympathy...

From anyone.",1366588800,,7264,4.947497949138638
5356906,3,B009NP1ZR0,"The 'hoodie' characters are presented as demonic, feral, uncontrollable creatures. A representation of many youngsters today as unemployment grows, creating a frustrated and isolated generation. The film is shot using a handheld camera, offering a close and suffocating atmosphere, especially when the camera is used to personify Tommy's fears.

Most of the violence is narrated off-screen; instead the action is shown through shadows, reflections, and sounds. The shots are compiled well, a particular favourite set in the cemetery.

Citadel is not as violent and shocking as its predecessors. Through the choice of a small cast, and limited sets, it offers a narrative focused on personalizing the story. The Lead actor creates life and fear into the character of Tommy, taking us on an intimate journey of survival. This sub-genre presents a grounded fear in audiences, exploring the known evil on our streets.

The dilemma of taking the shortcut through a darkened alleyway... the anticipation of the threat lurking in the dark. We emerge breathless and safe under the street light...phew...this time anyway.

So Citadel is already different in that respect.
It more or less opens with this guy's wife/girlfriend getting attacked by hooded children and then stuck with a needle with an unidentified  substance that sends her into a coma for good.
Now at least that's a little bit different or way more creative then the above mentioned.
What I see from the positive reviewers is the disappointing fact that no actual explanation was given for the offending entities in question and how they came to be.
I admit that would of been a neat trick to pull considering the directions they were going in, but what they did try to explain mostly through a priest that knows of these creatures, was enough for me to go with it and let my imagination fill in the gaps.

I clicked on various different lists and this movie was featured on nearly all of them. I looked at its IMDb rating and was disappointed with its low rating so I didn't really feel motivated to see it. But I was at Wal Mart and saw this movie there on sale and I just impulsively purchased it hoping the low rating was wrong. I am very glad I decided to buy this movie.

-Spoilers-
A young man is left widowed and damaged with agoraphobia after his pregnant wife is randomly attacked by a group of hooded kids. The baby is saved while the wife is left comatose for a few months until she finally passes. The young man is now raising the daughter alone in his panicked agoraphobic state. Then one day the hooded kids kidnap his daughter. With the help of a badmouthed priest and his son, he must rescue his daughter and learn the truth about these demonic hooded children.

Don't be fooled by the clichd plot. This movie is one of the more original horror films in the past 10 years. Its a shame it hasn't found a decent release in the US. I'm sure if this was given a theatrical release during the Halloween season it would've been a decent hit. This is the second best traditional horror movie released in 2012 behind Sinister in my opinion. There is something just eerie and unsettling about this film. The terror starts off within 5 minutes with a heart pumping intro. Then the more dramatic aspect takes place for about 20 minutes so that we can get to know the characters. The last half of the movie is just genius horror film making. Sure many things are questionable about this movie, but who cares? Its a great spooky film to watch in the dark alone or with a lover or friends. The cinematography is very well done for a first time director. The directing itself reminded me of Danny Boyles '28 Days Later' in some aspects. The acting is pretty good for a low budget film. There are many scenes that are just perfectly executed even though some of the characters decisions are typical Horror movie clichs. There is a fantastically creeping scene on the bus that will surely stick with most viewers long after seeing this movie. The music is great like most horror films from Europe. The demonic hooded children are some of the scariest horror villains in a long time. Many old school horror fans will think of 'The Brood' when they see the evil kids in this film. But honestly these kids are more menacing and scary. The director is certainly someone to watch out for in the future.

Though the movie is not popular yet among US viewers since it has only seen a DVD/Blu Ray release without any advertisement, I think it has potential to explode in popularity. I do hope that the horror fans that appreciate true good horror will spread the word on this movie and help it become the cult classic it is destined to be. Hopefully the rating goes up. Trust me, this movie is one of the good horror movies. There is only one criticism I have for the DVD.  There is no subtitle option, which is annoying at times since there are a few moments of dialogue that are hard to understand.  Either way it's honestly worth a purchase or at least a redbox rental. Give it a shot if you need a fresh simple horror movie to scare you for the night.",1360368000,2,3338,4.40356564019449
5356928,3,B009NP1ZR0,"I am assuming this movie is saturated with metaphors (or perhaps I am giving the writers to much credit), regardless, for the most part the nuances are so vague that I cannot come to any conclusion. The acting and cinematography was excellent. The scenery had such a deep feeling of misery, hopelessness and pain that I started to feel it myself.  I got a sense of release for the father's agoraphobia in the end, but with no clear answers as to how the boy fit into it. It was such an abrupt ending that I felt cheated. I am seeing a trend with movies being overly subtle in their message for the sake of ""artsiness"", this is a disservice to most movie goers and in the end you end up with a piece that essentially means nothing to anyone but the creators themselves.",1359849600,10,768,4.370629370629371

8543181,5,B009NP1ZR0,This is a very solid movie with great direction and acting.  The lead actor did an exceptionally convincing job in his role.  He went deep into the character and emotions of a young man who's lost it all and is overrun by fear.  You don't find that very often in a horror flick.  It made this film stand out from the rest of the pack.,1515110400,,334,4.092307692307692

8543184,1,B009NP1ZR0,"I remember seeing this and meaning to get around to getting it. Finally did. Let me start by saying I'm a huge fan pf psychological and drama/horror. I love the building suspense, confusion...this seemed like a waste of time. The honeymoon started out sweet and delved into a darker, more confusing thriller the longer you held your patience. I made it halfway through this one because I'm so bored with it I'm able to catch up on writing and work I do without getting distracted. NOT a good thing you want for a movie. Most boring piece since the NEON DEMON",1488672000,,558,4.534653465346534
