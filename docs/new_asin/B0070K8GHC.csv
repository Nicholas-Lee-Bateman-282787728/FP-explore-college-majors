8507812,2,B0070K8GHC,"After a swim meet, a girl meets a black ink/mist entity in the swimming pool and is spooked out. The kids at school study for exams as we are introduced to a new teacher.

Their exam takes a twist as the students are locked in. They are being killed off one by one. In order to survive they must figure out who and why.

As a slasher film , it had enough blood, but as a ghost film, it wasn't that scary. The film poorly combined slasher and supernatural elements with flashbacks that didn't seem to mean much. In short, I couldn't get into the film.
