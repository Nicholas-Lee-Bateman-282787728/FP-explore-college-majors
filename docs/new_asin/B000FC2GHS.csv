8120653,5,B000FC2GHS,"The American MuscleCar series has shown me a lot about the history performance cars in their heyday, before regulations changed the automotive business and made simple powerhouses a thing of the past.
the C.O.P.O. Chevrolets are among the most extreme examples of the genre. Huge big block engines wedged into lightweight cars like the Camaro can only result in ground-shaking performance. The ZL-1 Camaro was above and beyond the performance of any regular production musclecar of its era. If that wasn't enough, the LT-1 Nova was a high-winding small block with big block performance and sounds like a near exotic as it goes through the traps.

This video is a great way to see these magnificent automobiles in action. A privilege considering the fact that few of us will ever see one in person.",1354924800,,797,4.947761194029851
