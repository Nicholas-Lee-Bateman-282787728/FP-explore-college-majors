8415622,3,B000EK8B4S,"In a time when ""First Blood"" and the ""Missing In Action"" movies collided with ""Platoon"" and ""Hamburger Hill"", we have a sample of what might happen back home.
""Search And Destroy"" (1982) is a gritty, extremely suspensful cat-and-mouse chase that has an unforgettable ending. Perry King - a popular TV actor of the time (Riptide, etc)-takes on the role of a recent Vietnam vet who is the last of a squad of soldiers who are being hunted down and killed - by a comrade who holds a grudge. Interestingly, the fellow soldier - the villian - is Vietnamese, and he performs all the necessary rituals over candles and pictures in his hotel room before he executes one of the squadmates.
A bonus is a great performance by Don Stroud - who could've been an action figure all his own.
In the end, an overnight battle in the park leads to a soundtrack that is both haunting and electronic - perfect for the era.",1208563200,2,900,4.52760736196319
