5899450,5,B00EAHX876,This is THE best show on television. My daughter who is seventeen and I watch it together constantly. We want ALL the episodes on DVD.,1378684800,3,134,4.4
5899451,5,B00EAHX876,"I'm in love with Gravity Falls, it's the best show Disney has on-air as of now, and possibly one of the greatest American cartoons of all-time. Which is why it's a little strange they didn't release the whole season, seeing as how the season 1 finale was in August. Don't get me wrong, I'm still going to buy this, but I just wish it was the full season.",1377475200,3,354,4.220588235294118
5899452,3,B00EAHX876,This show is too awesome to not have the full first season released on dvd. Not a smart move disney.,1377302400,19,100,4.05
5899453,4,B00EAHX876,"I like that it will be including Journal #3 and a poster but still, NOT all episodes?! That was a stupid move Disney. People ARE SERIOUS about this show! ITS THE BEST ONE YOU HAVE TODAY! There are serious collectors that will want this mainly for the book. Please make a Season 1 with Journal #2 or something in the future or at least Season 1 all together.",1376611200,93,357,4.264705882352941
5899454,3,B00EAHX876,"Now I love Gravity Falls and think it's one of, if not the, funniest cartoon on right now. If you haven't seen it already, I highly recommend you do. I gave this three stars to get people's attention and tell other fans of this show to tell Disney that you want a season set. The reason Adventure Time and Regular Show got season sets on both dvd and Blu-Ray is because fans told the people in charge they wanted it. However, I wouldn't boycott this dvd. Low sales could lead to them not releasing any more dvds at all. I also don't think doing this kind of release at all is a bad thing. Spongebob does both soccer mom dvds and season sets and they both must sell well, cause I don't think they would keep putting them out if they weren't. This type of release can appeal to not only casual fans, but fans that would like to have episodes on dvd right away, even if they later have to rebuy those same episodes on a season set. In fact, that's why I bought this myself.
This dvd has the first six episodes in order which are:
1. Tourist Trapped
2. The Legend of the Gobblewonker
3. Headhunters
4. The Hand that Rocks the Mabel
5. The Inconveniencing
6. Dipper vs. Manliness",1375660800,156,1174,4.2690582959641254

The episodes with a # are included in the ""Gravity Falls: Even Stranger"" DVD.  Why on earth they don't release a complete season is beyond me.  As of November 2015, nothing else from Season 1 is released except the 12 episodes below, and nothing from Season 2 is released.  Come on Disney, wake up!

*1. Tourist Trapped: The twins come face to face with the town's strange secrets.
*2. The Legend of the Gobblewonker: Dipper and Mabel go boating to find a sea monster.
*3. Headhunters: Mabel sculpts a life-size wax statue.
*4. The Hand that Rocks the Mabel: Dipper and Mabel discover an intriguing new neighbor.
*5. The Inconveniencing: Dipper tries to impress Wendy.
*6. Dipper vs. Manliness: Dipper decides he needs to learn to ""be a man.""
7. Double Dipper: Dipper makes clones of himself to impress Wendy.
#8. Irrational Treasure: The twins find evidence that the town founder is a hoax.
#9. The Time Traveler's Pig: Dipper's wish comes true when he finds a time machine.
10. Fight Fighters: Dipper is shocked when his favorite video game character comes to life.
#11. Little Dipper: Dipper seeks a magical way to grow taller.
#12. Summerween: It's Gravity Falls' version of Halloween in summer!
#13. Boss Mabel: Stan challenges Mabel to run the Shack when she questions his bossing.

5899536,5,B00EAHX876,"It's really a shame the DVD doesn't have higher quality video (the animation looks GREAT in HD via iTunes so you'll be able to read some of the funny hidden easter eggs that are littered throughout the show). I was willing to hold out for a complete season, but I honestly couldn't wait any longer because I'm trying to share this show with as many of my friends and family as possible and not everyone can afford paying for all the iTunes episodes in HD. I'd rather reel em in by having them watch the season on my copy and after that they'll go support the show in their own way when they're hooked. There isn't enough merchandise for Gravity Falls, Disney! This show is LITERALLY about a group of people who work in a merchandise shop, the fanbase is hungry, and you're not delivering when we actually want it? What the heck??
I'm 23 and a HUGE fan of this show. I'm not normally a Disney Channel fan, but this style of entertainment is very genuine and non-gimmicky. It can also get dark too, which is surprising since it's got such a cute and funny style. It's rated Y7, but know your kids well enough to tell if they can handle some frightening moments with creepy monsters (thankfully, though, every time there's been a scary moment, they balance it out with a funny and light-hearted reaction to it right afterward). The jokes are hilarious (great comedic timing and a good range of humor for kids, teens, and adults), and the storytelling is clever and surprisingly heartwarming and deep! Doesn't take itself too seriously, which I like. I appreciate the dynamic every character has with each other. Dipper and Mabel are definitely a great representation of a healthy and realistic sibling team. As the eldest of five daughters, I personally find it tiring to see every show with siblings that hate each other. Dipper finds Mabel annoying at times and Mabel has teased Dipper and gotten in arguments, but you regularly see them doing things like ""syrup racing"" and playing checkers and just generally hanging out with each other. They behave less like the ""carbon copy twins"" stereotype and more like regular siblings that just happen to be the same age.
If you didn't already hear, there are also coded messages hidden in the show just waiting to be deciphered (sometimes it's foreshadowing and other times just silly stuff). It's just another layer that makes it that much more fun to be a fan.
You should look into this show whether or not you have kids. Children will enjoy it, but you won't want to miss it either!
Though I wish this DVD were Blu-ray with extras, I'd rather support the show with a five-star rating and buying the DVD anyway. A nice bonus, is that you get a lil' booklet-version of Dipper's secret book! It's a nice momento that will probably be a collectible in the future and leaves space at the bottom of each page for you to write additional notes about the creatures in the show.
I've already pre-ordered the second DVD, and I'll definitely be buying the complete 1st season (hopefully Blu-ray) set in the future. Hope they remember to put the hiatus Shorts in there too!",1407456000,,3107,4.64065335753176

Gravity Falls is one of the best animated shows on television right now. It's a delightful show about a sister and brother exploring the strange, supernatural wonders of the Pacific Northwest. It's thoughtful, funny, and very positive! It's also packed with mysteries, including secret codes to crack.

This show is great for kids, and for adults that like smart, fun cartoons (or secret codes, or conspiracy theories). It's equally positive for both girls and boys, too, a huge bonus.

This DVD is only the first 6 episodes, but it's still worth it, because you'll watch it over and over again. The rest of the episodes you can buy and watch online.

2. Very bare bones release with no special features. (although it does have a neat journal facsimile)
3. Should have a $10 price tag compared to other partial dvds (regular show/adventure time)

Hopefully Disney follows Cartoon Networks lead and gives us the goods soon. Adventure Time already has season 1 and 2 releases - with season 3 set for February - and Regular Show had a combo pack with the first two seasons together.

5899567,4,B00EAHX876,"When I heard there was gonna be a Gravity Falls DVD, I got hyped instantly. I bought it on Amazon, and a few days later, it was in my possession. A few nights later, I watched all the episodes on the disc in one night, looked through the special trinkets it has, and came to one simple conclusion: It's great, but also kinda disappointing.

On the DVD, you get 6 episodes from the show; it's not a full season DVD. Then again, most of Disney's releases of TV shows on DVD aren't full seasons anyway, so it's just normal for them. Luckily, it's not just 6 random episodes plopped onto the disc in a mix, it's the first 6 episodes in chronological order. Even though this isn't a Blu-ray release, all of the episodes are in 16:9 widescreen, so they look almost as good as Blu-ray on an HD television.

Unfortunately, the big reason why many people buy this kind of DVD is for one thing that this DVD lacks: special features. That's right, there are no special features whatsoever on the disc itself. Alex Hirsch, the creator of the show, really wanted to have some special features on the DVD, but Disney decided to just release the 6 episodes alone. That kinda sucks; I would have loved to hear some commentaries on each episode, or maybe a behind the scenes featurette, but there just isn't anything here.

However, the DVD includes one thing that almost makes up for it: a replica of Journal #3 from the show. It's a little booklet printed to resemble the pages of the Journal. Each page looks pretty good; they're what you would expect a photocopy of the page to look like. It also has some transparent symbols hidden in the book that can only be seen by holding the page to a light. It's pretty cool, and it might be a good reason to get this DVD for the heck of it.

What do I recommend? Well, if you just want a DVD with some episodes on it, maybe to give to a kid or even watch the show yourself if you haven't seen it yet, then this is a great buy. However, this DVD has nothing else to offer except the Journal, so if that's more of what you were looking for, then you're in for disappointment. The DVD itself is pretty good, but it needs something else with it to really make it something interesting",1384560000,8,2209,4.328502415458937

5899569,5,B00EAHX876,"Gravity Falls: Six Strange Tales is a 2013 Disney DVD compilation of six episodes of the Disney Channel new hit animated series. The series involves the 12-year-old Pines twins, Mabel, an uber-cheerful little girl and her brother, Dipper, a curious but neurotic mystery solver who discover a journal of Gravity Falls, where anything and everything are strange and unreal. From gnomes who dresses up as zombies to a robotic sea serpent to wax figures come to life to cause mayhem to manotuars who are REALLY manly, the Pineses are always having a fun and weird time. The only special feature on this DVD are sneak peeks of other Disney DVD favourites like Iron and The Hulk: Heroes United, The Little Mermaid, Monsters University, and a teaser trailer for the upcoming Disney animated feature film Frozen.

5899570,4,B00EAHX876,"Gravity Falls is an imaginative Disney Channel animated series about a brother and sister who are sent by their parents to stay with their Great Uncle (Grunkle) Stan, who operates a cheesy Ripleys Believe It or Not-type tourist trap in a bizarre but picturesque locale called Gravity Falls.

The premise is very slightly like the short-lived series Wonderfalls as far as the shop and location, but really reminds me of Eerie, Indiana, another short-lived series about two boys who keep discovering strange goings-on in their seemingly ordinary town (ironically this series was rerun on Disney Channel). I mention these only because those two shows were actually pretty cool, so its nice to see the basic idea being done in an animated settingand finally with success.

The show is packed with gags but does not have the jagged edge of Cartoon Networks Adventure Time, a series I would recommend for older kids and teens but not young tots. Gravity Falls has the fantasy but not all the farts, though the very young may find it a little scary at times.

Its wonderful that this collection includes the first six of the 20-episode first season in chronological order, which hopefully will continue with subsequent releases like it. More often, shows like these are cobbled into a themed collection that combine episodes from previous collections with a few previously unreleased ones, making it challenging for fans and collectors.

The DVD has no bonus features but the package includes a poster and a booklet resembling a mysterious journal that figures into the premise of the series.

------------------------------------------------------

Episodes in this collection:

1. Tourist Trapped (June 15, 2012)
Dipper and Mabel settle into Gravity Falls and discover the mysterious journal.

2. The Legend of the Gobblewonker (June 29, 2012)
On a fishing trip with Grunkle Stan, the kids plan to get a picture of the legendary Gobbley-wonker(?) is rumored to exist on Scuttlebutt Island.

3. Headhunters (June 30, 2012)
Mabel sculpts a wax figure of Grunkle Stan, but the figures head mysteriously disappears.

4. The Hand That Rocks the Mabel (July 6, 2012)
Mabel is drawn to Gideon, a would-be psychic and rival to Grunkle Stan. Gideon is a twisted, twangy villain who unmistakably suggests faith healers much like the one Steve Martin portrayed in the movie Leap of Faith.

5. The Inconveniencing July 13, 2012
Dipper is drawn to Wendy, an teenage co-worker who introduces them to her noncomformist friends and a trek inside a very strange convenience store.

6. Dipper vs. Manliness July 20, 2012
Dipper set out to prove how manly he is, while Mabel helps Grunkle Stan to get noticed by waitress Lazy Susan.

Sadly however, about 70% of all the writing on the creature pages is just squiggles and gibberish. While some writing can be seen such as TRUST NO ONE or Avoid this door on main street!, I was quite disappointed that a lot of the writing on those creature pages is incomprehensible.

Disney is at it again making more great cartoons and shows that kids and adults both love to watch.  Disney's Gravity Falls Six Strange Tales is a dvd packed full of over 2 hours of fun characters, adventures and of course humor thrown into the mix.

This DVD has 6 tales that include the following episodes:

 1 - ""Tourist Trapped""

2 - ""The Legend of the Gobblewonker""

3 - ""Headhunters""

4 - ""The Hand That Rocks the Mabel""

5 - ""The Inconveniencing""

6 - ""Dipper vs. Manliness""

I have twin nieces Rain and Jade and they love Disney's Gravity Falls because of the twin's adventures on the show.  Twins Dipper and Mabel are 12 and spend the summer with Grunkle Stan running The Mystery Shack.  Through mysterious secrets, navigating the unknown, true love and a lot of hard work Dipper and Mabel learn a lot about themselves during their adventures.  On of the biggest lessons is that they have to rely on each other to help solve the mysteries and get closer to the answers which is a lot like real life.

Dipper Pines is  Jason Ritter (TV's ""Parenthood"", ""Joan of Arcadia"", ""The Event"").

Mabel Pines is Kristen Schaal (TV's ""Flight of the Conchords"", ""Bob's Burgers"", ""30 Rock"").

""Gravity Falls"" creator and executive producer  Alex Hirsch (""Fish Hooks"") as Great Uncle Stan aka ""Grunkle Stan"" and Soos.

Included in your purchase you recieve a 1-Disc DVD + Exclusive Mystery Book: Journal #3! How fun for the kids!!",1381795200,21,1472,4.7204724409448815
5899576,5,B00EAHX876,"Step 1: Buy this dvd
Step 2: Ask your friends and family to buy this dvd
Step 3: Visit your local Disney store and ask them about Gravity Falls dvds and merchandise
Step 4: Ask your friends and family to do the same
Step 5: Be sure to watch the show when it airs on TV

And that should do it!

Seriously, it is a shame Disney didn't have the courage to release this as a full season set. The only way to fix this is by proving to them that there is an audience for this show. Alex Hirsch himself explained during a Q&A session on reddit.com that he begged Disney to release a complete first season blu-ray with commentaries and features, but the cost was far too much for Disney to invest in. He explained that the only way to really change this is pretty much by following the steps I listed above.

As for the show itself, I have to say it is easily the best show Disney Channel has offered in a while. Visually, it is one of the more groundbreaking animated shows ever produced! I've watched the intro over and over, and it's still a wonder to behold. The stories are creative, the characters are appealing, and the mysterious secrets sprinkled throughout make it a more enriching experience.

Make us a DVD with all of the episodes and I will buy three.
Start making Gravity Falls merchandise.
Start giving the show a regular schedule and a prominent slot.

Get it together.

The only thing that is lowering my rating is the fact that there aren't more episodes involved. The show itself deserves five stars.

5899581,4,B00EAHX876,"If Twin Peaks had been dreamed up by a ten-year-old on a massive sugar high, the result might be something like ""Gravity Falls.""

And ""Gravity Falls: Six Strange Tales"" brings together the first six episodes of this strangely addictive show, which might draw in even people who don't usually like kids' cartoons. It's gleefully surreal, slightly dark and very tongue-in-cheek -- sort of like one of the more successful Adult Swim series, but minus the sex and graphic violence.

Twelve-year-old Dipper and Mabel Pines are spending the summer with their Grunkle Stan, an elderly con-man who runs the Mystery Shack (a ramshackle museum of bizarre, mostly fake items). However, Dipper is kind of worried about staying in Gravity Falls, where weird things seem to happen on a near-daily basis (his mosquito bites spell out BEWARB).

Then Dipper finds a mysterious book that reveals the many secrets of Gravity Falls, and Mabel meets a strange, extremely-pale boy. She hopes he's a Twilight-style vampire, but Dipper is afraid he's a zombie. The truth... is a lot stranger than either theory.

This is only the beginning of the twins' strange adventures -- polygamous gnomes, a wax figure who loses his head, an expedition to find a mythical sea monster (for money!), a convenience store with malevolent ghosts, manly minotaurs who teach Dipper how to be a real man, and a malevolent bloblike Southern boy who takes a shine to Mabel (and hates her family).

""Gravity Falls"" reminds me a little of those weird Adult Swim cartoons, except this one is appropriate for kids. Even though I find most kids' shows to be as annoying as gnomes, this one is strangely addictive -- partly because it's just so unabashedly strange. My favorite scene involves Mabel shouting, ""The past is the future! Onward, Aoshima!"" while riding a muscular-armed, multi-faced flying dolphin that vomits rainbows.

It also manages to be mostly funny from its dialogue, which tends to be pretty fun in how tongue-in-cheek it is (""Awkward Sibling Hug?"" ""Awkward Sibling Hug!"") and how matter-of-fact (""How did it go?"" ""I don't know. I have a lobster now""). And it has plenty of fun moments for the pure comedy's sake, such as Soos getting bedazzled into a human disco ball. Why? Because they can!

It also helps that the characters are actually better-rounded than your average kids'-cartoon character -- instead of just being one character trait, each has several. Dipper is sensible, organized, a bit timid and has an unrequited crush on tomboyish older-woman Wendy, while Mabel is sprightly, reckless, has a penchant for odd sweaters and loves to do fun random stuff for its own sake.

The other characters are fun as well, such as crotchy Grunkle Stan (""Kids! I can't find the remote and refuse to stand up!""), serenely hamsterlike handyman Soos, the malevolent dumpling Gideon, and a crazed old hillbilly with a special knack for robotics.

""Gravity Falls"" is as addictive as Smile Dip (and only slightly less psychedelic), and it's just a shame that this contains only six of the episodes. Here's hoping for more! BEWARB!",1379721600,5,3092,5.011695906432749
5899582,5,B00EAHX876,"Firstly, I want to say thank you to Disney for a DVD release for Gravity Falls!!  In my opinion this is the best show Disney has had in a long time! I  definitely agree with everyone else that they need to release the entire first season, but am thankful for this DVD! Maybe if sales of ""Six Strange Tales"" are good they will see there is enough demand for a DVD release of the entire season! So lets all support this DVD, buy it, and encourage others to do so! All of us big fans won't mind buying the episodes again on a Season 1 release!",1379289600,3,540,4.084905660377358
5899583,5,B00EAHX876,"I already have all the episodes on Amazon Instant Video, so I'm buying this for the poster and the book. Honestly, that's worth 15 dollars to me. It'd be great if they had all the episodes, but the good thing is they'll probably include Book 2 with the second half of Season 1 (and I'll be getting that as well).",1378944000,3,312,4.216666666666667

I badly want a box set though. Or at least the rest on DVD or blue ray. Pretty please?",1521590400,,152,4.241379310344827
8603181,5,B00EAHX876,"Great! Just wish you could get all the episodes. There are 2 different sets you can buy, but each only has certain episodes. Still, having this is better than keeping the DVR full. ;)",1519948800,,183,4.411764705882353
