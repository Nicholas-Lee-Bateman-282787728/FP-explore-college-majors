2861962,2,B000R7HY3C,"I think von Trier is proud of this film stylistically. But when it comes to fun, I do not find this movie very funny. It seems to be a movie for the movie wise heads. But as a normal spectator I do not find it that very entertaining. Anyway there is here and there a joke which made me laugh in the movie. It seems like Trier likes to dig beyond the surface of modern man. In this film the scene is corporate Denmark. One must hope that one day Trier will grow up and leave all that art crap, overcome his fear of air travel, and go to Hollywood!",1278374400,,546,3.9727272727272727
2861963,5,B000R7HY3C,"This film is absolutely brilliant. The owner of a company has been pretending to answer to a non-existent higher-up, 'The Boss of it All'. When he needs to produce this 'boss' to participate in negotiations, he hires a pretentious actor. The film examines a theme similar to 'Being There' or Dostoevsky's 'The Idiot', wherein the 'boss' is truly a blank slate and each of the other characters projects upon him their own emotions and feelings through a sort of transference. Shot in a cinema-verite style, (von Trier was a founding member of Dogme 95, after all), and with some wonderful performances, this film is a must see.",1260835200,,626,4.859813084112149

""You're right, but I'm better at being irritating on an intuitive level.""

With his often unlikely plotting, emphasis on stripped-down style over structure and fascination with stripping away the suspension of disbelief of most films to highlight their artificiality, it's fair to say that Lars Von Trier isn't to everyone's taste. After films like Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark he also seems an unlikely candidate to try his hand at a comedy, but the mischievous sense of humour that's run through his work since the TV series The Kingdom finds a perfect outlet in The Boss of it All. The plot might seem almost as if it could do service as a mainstream Hollywood comedy, but in many ways it's the perfect match of premise and filmmaker.

Gambini-obsessed bad actor Kristoffer (Jens Albnus) is hired by Ravn (Peter Gantzler) to pretend to be the boss of the company he's planning to sell. Ravn has been the real boss of the company for years, but is so desperate to be liked by his staff that the only way he can pass on bad news is by blaming it all on an invisible owner in America. Despite the fact that at first Kristoffer reads far more into the text than there is (""It says far more than it says"" he notes of his underwritten part: ""I had hoped it would say as little as possible,"" replies the whiz-at-contracts Ravn), unfortunately, Ravn's so desperate not to be disliked that he doesn't fill Kristoffer in on the full script, expecting the hapless actor to improvise his way through a minefield of imaginary relationships the staff have created with him over the years. Finding himself alternately seduced, punched or engaged to them at various times, he soon discovers that the real boss of it all is a much better actor than he is...

The stage is set for a playful examination of the way people's vanity inevitably finds them playacting both at work and in their personal relationships in their desperation to either fit in or at least have an easy life, allowing Von Trier plenty of opportunities to take swipes at acting in general (and in Denmark in particular) as well as the vagaries of business politics. What's surprising is how funny much of it is, from Kristoffer's obsession with getting to the `truth' of his character (complete with dramatic pauses and would-be burning looks that just confuse people) to the obnoxious saga-obsessed Icelandic tycoon who wants to settle 400 years of national humiliation by humiliating the Danish company. And running through it all is a sly commentary on moviemaking and the power struggle between actor and director (the Danish title is Direktren for det Hele). Of course, humour is a personal thing, and it may be funnier if you've worked in that kind of office environment or know enough self-obsessed actors to recognise the absurdity, and for some Von Trier's interruptions to comment on the film or his use of computer-chosen camera angles that don't always capture the action and give some of the film a disjointed feel will take them out of the film or simply irritate. But if you're on the right wavelength, there's a lot of fun to be had with The Boss of It All.",1232236800,2,3192,4.727109515260323
2861965,3,B000R7HY3C,"Ravn (Peter Gantzler) is a Danish entrepreneur who, due to an almost pathological need to be liked by everyone, has trouble effectively managing the employees who work for him.  To overcome this deficiency, he devises an elaborate ruse, one that involves hiring an out-of-work actor (Jens Albinus) to pose as a fictitious company president whose job it will be to both bark out the orders and deflect any blowback that might come his way from the disgruntled workers.  At first, Kristoffer goes along with the plan, convincing the staff that he is indeed the CEO of the firm and that he actually knows what it is he's talking about when it comes to implementing and enforcing company policy.  Yet, slowly, Kristoffer comes to suspect that Ravn may not be quite as pure in heart or benign in his motives as the young actor was initially led to believe.  Eventually, Kristoffer has to decide just how far he's willing to go with this charade if carrying it to its completion means backstabbing the very people he's actually come to care about in the short time he`s been working there.

Like virtually all of Lars Van Trier's work, the highly satirical ""The Boss of it All,"" is an acquired taste, one that demands a degree of patience from the viewer - along with a rather high threshold for pretentiousness - before it can be fully understood and appreciated.  And, indeed, the first half of the film makes for rather rough sailing as we attempt to descry, through all the verbal fog and cinematic obscurity, just what it is that Van Trier is trying to accomplish.  We know it has something to do with skewering the whole corporate-world-mentality thing, but the extreme verbosity and self-conscious filmmaking style go a long ways towards muddling the message.

But, damned if the whole thing doesn`t somehow manage to pull itself together long about the midway point and we cruise safely to our admittedly unexpected destination.  Part of the reason for the turnabout is that Van Trier is finally able to crystallize his theme once Kristoffer realizes he has a serious moral decision to make and when it starts becoming unclear which ""boss"" is really pulling the strings - i.e. who is the puppeteer and who the puppet, who the scenarist and who the actor - in this oddball relationship.

I've never been overly fond of Van Trier's self-conscious stylistic hallmarks - jump-cuts, catawampus framing, self-referential, film-within-a-film narration - since they serve mainly to call attention to the filmmaker and to throw us out of the drama he's showing us.  Still, there are moments when the dark, tongue-in-cheek humor successfully hits its mark, and Van Trier does a nice job dovetailing his parody of the theater into his satire on business.  And the unexpected ending demonstrates that none of us is truly above selling out those we care for if the price is high enough for doing so.",1214611200,,2888,4.8594704684317716
2861966,2,B000R7HY3C,"I guess you could say I'm a Lars von Trier fan, this being the fifth film of his I've seen (the best by far is Breaking the Waves), but this one was an utter disappointment.  I was curious to see how he would pull off a comedy, but there is only one joke told seventeen different ways.  I laughed the first time.  The actors, who do their best, are wasted.  The camera roams around looking for something to do.  In short, a good one to skip.",1193443200,2,441,4.0813953488372094
2861967,4,B000R7HY3C,"Danish director Lars von Trier gets experimental again in ""The Boss of It All"", but this time he aims to make us laugh. This corporate comedy sends up actors, artistic pretensions, and the venerable tradition of passing the buck. Mr. Ravn (Peter Gantzler) founded a successful technology company but was loath to take on the role of President. So he invented a fictional company president who is always abroad, concealing his true role even from the company's ""six seniors"", its first and most valuable employees. Now Ravn needs to close a deal with an Icelandic businessman who insists on dealing with the President. So Ravn hires Kristoffer (Jens Albinus), an out-or work actor of little talent and many pretensions, to be the President for a week.

This absurd set-up creates ample opportunity for hilarity: The staff is easily convinced that Kristoffer is President despite his ignorance and inarticulate prattle. He must negotiate conversations with the six seniors, who have each been given a different impression of him by Gavn, without letting on that he doesn't know them. He gradually comes to realize that Gavn created the President to take the blame for his unpopular decisions, while Gavn took credit for more generous policies. The men are more alike than Kristoffer would like to think, as they both crave attention and acceptance. ""The Boss of It All"" is insightful, comical, and almost believable.

The film doesn't look good, though. Lars von Trier employed Automavision to frame all the shots. In other words, he let a computer decide where to put the camera. ""Decide"" might not be the best word. The computer selects randomly. A silly exercise in my view -and a false one, since the director set the computer's parameters (to avoid filming a blank wall or ceiling), and the actors can see the camera, so they maneuver to get into frame. Lars von Trier does things like this to amuse himself. In this case, the framing looks amateurish but not unusual, so I don't see a point to it except to relieve von Trier of the burden of framing his own shots. I was more struck by the problems with color temperature, which are distracting and ugly. In Danish with subtitles.

2861968,5,B000R7HY3C,"Danish auteur Lars von Trier turns his acidic wit to office politics, with the overall message that while the true boss of it all that really runs the show is money, capitalism American style, what most of us really want is not the truth but a convenient and self-serving fiction.  Along the way von Trier dishes up a scenario that is endlessly inventive and hilarious -- and that in its ruthless look at the stupidity of bureaucracy harks back to his underseen television miniseries Riget/Kingdom.  As in that series, he includes himself directly here as a narrator to comment on his approach and on his expectations from the audience -- reminding us both directly and indirectly that his aim is not to please or to edify but to exploit and manipulate and offend at the same time as he entertains.  This is a lighter, and less ambitious, project than anything he has done for a while, but it is no less intriguing for that.

As in many of his films, where he deliberately imposes upon himself a specific constraint (as in his Dogme film ""The Idiots"" or as in ""Dogville"" and ""Manderlay"" where he gets rid of the sets, or as he imposes upon his teacher Jorgen Leth in ""The Five Obstructions), he set up a very specific constraint upon himself in the making of this film that defines in large part its style and look.  He made use of a technology dubbed ""Automavision"" -- a camera whose angle and exposure are set randomly by computer -- and the effect is to add a jumpy and kinetic quality to the film that goes against the standard Hollywood style continuity editing and includes jump cuts and non-matching lighting, etc.  Somehow it works, in part because of the strength of the acting and the script, but in part because the awkwardness of the style seems to match the story perfectly.  In fact, it works more than just as an aesthetic complement to the story: it ties directly to the theme of the story in so far as ""Automavision"" functions as a kind of ""boss of it all"" -- that can be blamed for the apparent arbitrariness of some of the editing and coloring choices.  The true ""boss of it all"" that von Trier suggests really runs everything is in fact the not-entirely arbitrary but still haphazard fluctuation of the market -- and ""Automavision"" works as a nice metaphor for that.

This is not, strictly speaking, a masterpiece and will certainly be regarded as one of Lars von Trier's lesser works -- I think it can be said that all of his works are flawed in some way, but this seems to be part of a deliberate effort on his part to introduce flaws.  His work as a whole still remains some of the most inventive and compelling in recent cinema -- and for that reason alone, combined with the fact that it is, given an allowance for a certain kind of humor, one of the funniest films to appear so far this year, it is definitely worth watching.",1190419200,8,2851,4.507751937984496

8199418,5,B000R7HY3C,"An very satisfying movie from LVT's weird transition between his more stripped-down and his more overtly cinematic periods. There has got to be some influence from Ricky Gervais's The Office b/c of the setting. But rather than the characters knowing they are being filmed like in said TV show, there is a not-so-omnipresent filmmaker documenting and narrating the whole thing who seems to be as bumbling and idiotic as the rest of the characters. The filmmaker is only seen in reflections of the office building and is heard running down actors and businessmen for being self-important, but he himself seems unsure of what his movie is about or what he is trying to say. I don't want to give too much away, but I enjoyed this movie greatly. It is by far LVT's lightest movie, but still has the nuances and emotion you'd expect. Great ending.",1481673600,,841,4.767123287671233
8199419,4,B000R7HY3C,"Chances are, if you've never enjoyed one of Lars' movies then this won't work for you either. Personally, I tend to love his films and find them interesting at the very least. I think there is only one I really disliked. But nothing is worse than a boring artist and he certainly isn't dull. I appreciate that in this age of comic book movies. I really liked this change of pace from him and until the last second, I wasn't sure how it would end. Excellent acting. I recommend it.",1432512000,,480,4.344444444444444
8199420,2,B000R7HY3C,"I wish I loved it -- I do love many of Von Trier's movies, I trust his ambition, generally even if I do not think the movie stood for whatever reason, I am glad that he is on the scene. But this movie just didn't come together, not for me; all movies are lies, they're all stories, they (almost all of them) they require suspension of disbelief. I never got near that with this movie. As always, he gets good performances out of his actors/actresses; it's the story, and the interwoven stories that make it up, all of that is what did not work for me.",1430352000,,551,4.2075471698113205
8199421,4,B000R7HY3C,"This Danish DVD is definitely not for most of you. But I know some of you like foreign films; while some of us get a kick out of actors and their ""process""; and others are fans of the Danish director Lars von Trier (""Dogville"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"").... If you fit any of these categories, have I got a film for you!

When I ordered it from the library, I asked for ""The Boss of it All"" but it shows up as ""Direktoren for det hele"" in IMDb and on other lists, so take your pick...

In a nutshell, a fellow with a Danish information technology company hires an actor to pretend to be the chronically absent president of the company just long enough to grant him power of attorney. That way he can sell the company to a hostile man from Iceland (who hates the Danes for 400 years of servitude!). The poor actor hasn't been very successful lately, so is desperate enough to give it a try. He's a little unsure of the ad lib aspect of the job, but agrees to do it.

When he attends his first meeting, one of the employees slugs him and things go downhill from there. One of the women says she can see through his disguise. He thinks his pretence has been uncovered but instead she says she knows he has been trying to hide his homosexuality in his e-mails and is prepared to show him how she can help him get over it. This is Scandinavian cinema, so naturally, he allows himself to be ""shown.""

He is very concerned about his lines and his timing, while the employees are very concerned about their JOBS! He becomes better acquainted with them and the situation... but then another character makes an entrance...

Suffice it to say, this is very, very dry humor, and the extras, which include a mockumentary, are hilarious...but only if you like exceedingly dry humor. I got my DVD from Amazon.",1375488000,2,1793,4.372372372372372
8199422,1,B000R7HY3C,"This was recommended to us as being funny.  Perhaps it is, but given that the audio sounds like it was recorded underwater using a Fisher-Price microphone in a subway car, I wouldn't know.  One would think that the audio of a subtitled movie shouldn't matter, but as it was quite irritating, it did.",1374019200,,299,4.622641509433962
8199423,2,B000R7HY3C,This film is a situation comedy based on laughing at people in awkward situations. If you have a taste for that kind of thing than this movie is for you. Otherwise forget it.,1357689600,,174,4.303030303030303
8199424,5,B000R7HY3C,"This movie is a hilarious crowd-pleaser. A little screwball, a little alternative. I've had many a skeptical friend that I've convinced to see this film and they all ended up loving it and going on and on about how great it was afterward. I happened to see it in a theater the first time, and afterward I went out for dinner with the friends I saw it with, we went on laughing and remembering scenes from the movie so late into the night that we were all horse the next day. Really.
It's interesting that some people said that they thought this was not very accessible, because I thought that just the opposite was true, especially considering the director. If you only like very typical Adam Sandler-type comedies, can't appreciate Monty Python or any foreign movies/foreign humour, than this might not be for you. Incidentally, I'm not usually a fan of foreign films that are so often overly serious and self important, and I love brain sucking Hollywood movies (Zoolander is pure genius, almost anything with Will Ferrel). So I have to disagree that this is a ""movie for eggheads"" like one other reviewer said. But comedies are tricky and don't always appeal to everyone. I LOVE this movie, and everyone I know who's seen it has too. Fantastic.",1329177600,,1247,4.698630136986301
8199425,3,B000R7HY3C,"Years ago when I was in Japan there were some odd cultural things that I never quite 'got', like television commercials for example. Some were so strange that, often, I couldn't and didn't grasp what they were advertising. Certainly language plays a part in that murkiness, but when two cartoon elephants crapped out bits of a car that reassembled itself and drove away with a happy customer - I had to wonder. The next morning I asked what it meant and was told it was a commercial for some type of soft drink.

(blink)

:-\

(blink)

Some things just don't translate.

Direktren, a Dutch film renamed 'The Boss Of It All' for markets outside Scandinavian countries, neatly fits into this odd cultural chasm.

It seems, at least to this American, that the film is acutely bizarre and the plot seemingly spun from some unwired stream of consciousness; more experimental film than the purported comedy which is hawked by Amazon's plot synopsis. Admittedly, there are humorous stylistic elements of The Office interwoven into the screenplay. But unlike that sharp edged comedy, this film is lost in its own inner navel. Made more evident when the film's director unexpectedly and repeatedly cuts himself into the movie to give us insight to his filmmaking and concepts of story.

Having read the reviews only after screening the movie, I had no idea this was born from a film auteur. Had not heard the name Lars von Trier previously, who is known for his unorthodox productions. In truth, had I known that from the get-go, I would've chosen not to rent the film. Generally speaking, the film elitist and arthouse body tend to gravitate toward the bizarre and pointless - typically my cue to exit a side door as quickly as possible. Life is just too short.

But having mostly endured the process, I was struck by Von Trier's final words as intermittent narrator to the film. And those words speaks volumes about what and why this film was made:

""Those who got what they came for ... deserve it.""

That's a verbatim quote.

Again, I'm not an avant garde devotee. But this honestly sounds like a bleep you; a sniggling laugh at the expense of those who put themselves through the experience. Von Trier is a clever sadist. And anyone proclaiming they enjoyed the film - I honestly believe you're either a mental masochist (and apparently from what I've read, this is a commonly accepted personality trait in Scandinavia) - or you don't get that the joke, the comedy, is you.

For that alone - I enjoyed it. :-)",1311724800,4,2505,4.733333333333333
