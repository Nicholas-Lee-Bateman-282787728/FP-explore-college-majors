8491076,5,B0062BTU3O,"One thing I love about anime/manga is that there is  a lot of reference to western folklore, as well as Japanese. Drrr! uses an Irish creature for theirs, and it's great. Think female reaper, only this one traded her horse and carriage for a motorcycle, and yes, she has a crazy big scythe. There's more to it than that, but long story short, our gal reaper is in Japan looking for her lost head which contains all her memories. We also meet some high schoolers with a few secrets of their own to hide, as well as information brokers (who have a mafia like control over their city), Russian sushi guys, and one guy in particular that could out do superman anyday of the week. It's really a great series with well done plot twists, plenty of action, lots of considering, and of course, great humor. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good mix of genres.",1371254400,,856,4.417721518987341
