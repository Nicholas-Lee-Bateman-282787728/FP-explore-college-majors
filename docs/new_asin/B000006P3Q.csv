7904596,2,B000006P3Q,"A lot of the footage is something you've already gotten in some other tape if you collect Diana videos, I've even seen a lot of the old B/W newsreel footage used in the historical comparisons. There is just a little video I'm not familiar with and a few still shots but htis program doesn't amount to much.
