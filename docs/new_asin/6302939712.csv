7833761,4,6302939712,"Niave for today's sophisticated and perhaps jaded audience. Certainly will hold no thrills for those seeking to feed on a gore fest. A light and cute film with a couple of subtly managed twists. In fact the lead actress does such a good job convincing us she is a light weight, the viewer is hard pressed to believe her character is complex enough to be running numerous simultaneous cons. Then again, a con woman's job is to make us believe only that which she wishes us to believe. Of course, a top notch actress can make us believe she is the penultimate con woman while also revealing her depth and complexity to the viewers. I enjoyed this light fair as a refreshing break, but I believe this movie could have been much improved by more thorough character development. However, if you are a person who likes to believe everything will work out in the end against all odds and appearances, then this movie is for you. One (spoiler) her true romantic interest lies elsewhere than that so obviously suggested.",1454284800,2,1011,4.653631284916201

7833765,3,6302939712,"Dedee Pfeiffer, an undervalued actress who has found it tough going to withdraw from beneath the shadow of her celebrated sister Michelle, has nonetheless achieved substantial success in works that generally offer little in the way of viewer pleasure, such as in the instance of this moderately absorbing but hardly memorable crime flavoured melodrama that is flattened at the hands of weak direction, a limply structured script, and a lead actor suffering from deficiencies in charisma and proficiency.  Cameron King (Miles O'Keefe), who is conducting an illicit gambling operation upon the top floor of his nightclub, has also illegally come into possession of the ""Emperor's Pearl"", a legendary gem coveted by many, and has organized a private auction for a wealthy handpicked few to submit bids upon the jewel, but several difficulties arise for King as the transfer date nears, most seemingly involving an attractive photographer, Katie (Pfeiffer) who has aggressively wormed her way into a job at the night spot, taking photographs of customers, while also gaining the close attention and romantic affection of a vulnerable Cameron.  Katie enjoys a brisk business at the club, selling to patrons photos that she has taken of them, but King's predominant henchman, Sebastian (performed with villainous glee by Fred Ottaviano) is suspicious of her motives for wishing to be close to his boss and it becomes apparent that there are others as well who are clearly interested in probing King's activities, such as the local police department, the FBI, and a young newly hired bartender (Christopher Atkins) who has rallied to the moral support of Katie against Sebastian's strong feelings of distrust.  Shot in Florida, and titled SHOOT upon its original VHS release, later as KING'S RANSOM, this film's principal drawback to a viewer is the scenario's lack of balance that results in a failure to emphasise sundry plot twists.  O'Keefe displays his customary acting range, that of a cigar store Indian, except for those blessedly few episodes when he impersonates Clint Eastwood, while Pfeiffer handily earns the acting laurels in a work that lacks storyline impact, instead merely dwindling to an insipid conclusion.",1206835200,2,2219,5.295454545454546
