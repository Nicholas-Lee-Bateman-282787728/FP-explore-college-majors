8462962,2,B0059GVB2Q,"The print of ""Three Word Brand"" comes from a source many generations from the original.  Image is washed out and soft.  Hard to watch.  Transferred at the correct speed, but every few minutes, for two to three seconds, the image slows then accelerates before settling back to the correct speed.  The musical score is astonishingly inappropriate.  But, until a better source comes along (soon, please!), this is the only option to see this spectacular late William S. Hart feature.  I didn't look at ""The Square Deal Man"" as there is already a superior alternate edition on the market.  Again, it's Alpha Video roulette to see what you get.",1338076800,4,639,4.861111111111111
8462963,3,B0059GVB2Q,"Bought this because I remember my dad saying that his favorite western star was William S. Hart and I wanted to see why he liked him. Enjoyed ""Three Word Brand"" but couldn't get through ""Square Deal Man"" because it was very hard to watch (picture went out of focus, skipped a lot, big spots on screen). I know the quality can't be up to par, but it is fun seeing westerns before talkies and stars like Gene Autry, Johnny Mack Brown and Bob Steele (my favorite).",1328486400,,461,4.372093023255814
