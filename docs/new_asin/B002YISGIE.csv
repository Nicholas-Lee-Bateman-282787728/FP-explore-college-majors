Roger De Coster, Dave Bickers, Joel Roberts and others, I was fortunate enough to be as to spend some time with them. We went riding in the california desert . Distirict 37 This is where they believed some talent could be found. We taught them how we road the desert !! They Taught us
how they rode motocross.!!! This was back in the 1960's / 70's. !!!! Motocross is hugh world wide. This video tells a story, a good story.there are more videos they are of real people, Love to ride, Love to race more.",1502496000,,639,4.333333333333333
8384254,1,B002YISGIE,There should have been more footage of these races.  To many short clips.,1464825600,,73,4.615384615384615

8384257,5,B002YISGIE,"This is a well done video about an icon in the history of the sport of motocross.  No other one man has had such an impact on his chosen field as Roger DeCoster has had on his. He became an American citizen,  even to the point of having his own son fight on the middle east in support of our country.",1421712000,,300,3.901639344262295
8384258,4,B002YISGIE,"Roger DeCoster idol of many MotoX riders .
Winner of five 500cc World Championships  and
 four Trans USA series titles in the 1970s.
In 1979 Roger signed with American Honda and
 had a huge influence managing the team and
the American ""Motocross des Nations"" riders.
Two hours of contents on this DVD covers
DeCoster's MX career to date quite well.
Biggest dissappointment is that there is not
much footage from the World GP series between
1970 and 79.""Suzuki GP"" DVD from [...]
has a lot of film from this era and actually ""shows"" what
an amazing Rider he was.
The interview questions seem to be aimed at
historical aspects and don't really dig into what
makes Roger tick and the psychological aspects
of staying at the pinnacle of World MotoX for seven years.",1269129600,6,761,4.706766917293233
