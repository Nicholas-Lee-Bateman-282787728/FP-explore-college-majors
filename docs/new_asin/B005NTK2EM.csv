4849797,4,B005NTK2EM,"Viewing this tape of the Nuremburg rally for the Nazi Party in 1934 only a year after Hitler has become head of the government as Chancellor of Germany, makes you appreciate the power of propaganda and the subversion of democratic government that can happen if the circumstances present themselves or the constitution lacks the necessary checks and balances of the framers that were designed to prevent one person or institution from gainful absolute power over the state and the lives of its citizens.  One can see in this movie the influence of the Nazi part on people's lives and its pervasive blanket of thought control it imposed upon German society in the 1930's.
Hilter's increasing political success in diplomacy from 1935 to 1939 makes him impossible to depose until he starts losing on the battlefield in 1943-44.  But even the feeble July 1944 attempt failed.
Everyone should see this tape at least once to recognize the signs of a totalitarian regime and stop it in its tracks before it grows to strong to resist the citizenry.

4849799,4,B005NTK2EM,"One of the best examples of a propaganda film ever made about the 3rd worst mass-murderers in history listed as follows:

1. People's Republic of China -- Mao Tse Dong
2. Soviet Union - Joseph Stalin
3. Nazi Germany -- Hitler
4. Imperial Japan -- Hirohito -- If we'd known how well the A bombs would work he'd have been hung like the common war criminal who'd committed mass crimes against humanity. And, unlike Germany, Japan has never apologized for starting WWII in the Pacific and among the Pac Rim nations.

So even unto today very few people know that Mao and Stalin are the greatest mass murderers in all of history.",1456358400,4,623,4.553571428571429

Truly a mesmerizing film.",1371600000,9,126,4.7272727272727275
4849802,5,B005NTK2EM,"I prefer this version by  ""International Historic Films"" as it comes with some detailed extras rather than the red embossed tin version by the ""Timeless Media Group"" which has none {unless you discount English subtitles}
This has: - 4 Interactive DVD slide shows
  - Third Reich photos

Bonus shorts - ""Day of Freedom""  {our armed forces}  ....  26 minutes

  - ""Genesis of Triumph"" ...  {overview of the Nuremburg rally with commentary in English} .... 23 minutes

The most important extra for me was the scene selector, very handy if you would rather
hear the speeches given by some of the toedies a miss in the NSDAP Convention Hall.

  {And luckily for Hitler Ernst Roehm was no more as Hitler had struck first reluctantly or not,
there was some payback from disgruntled SA members as at least 155 SS leaders were killed in late 1934/35 by a group called ""Roehm's Avengers"", these identified their group with a piece of paper pinned to the body of each victim. {from ""The Pink Swastika""}",1357171200,16,991,4.747058823529412

8480774,5,B005NTK2EM,"This will send chills up and down your spine! It is easy to see how the populace was transfixed by his oratory and willing to die for their Fuhrer. The scary part is that I saw parallels with today's presidential campaigns. Hitler recited to the people all the trials and tribulations that had been foisted upon them by the nations of the world and the recent Kaiser's administration. Then he proclaimed that HE ALONE COULD FIX THESE TROUBLES AND MAKE GERMANY GREAT AGAIN!  I heard a chilling echo from today! And of course there is Goebbel's mantra: If you tell a big enough lie often enough, people will begin to believe it. That's why you shouldn't believe anything you see or hear on the campaign trail.",1474675200,5,707,4.611111111111111
8480775,5,B005NTK2EM,"A powerful masterpiece by Leni Riefenstahl.  This remastered version is the best available for sound and picture quality.  The newer Blu-ray version is unfortunately ruined due to the non-removeable watermark and on-screen inane captions, so for now (until there is a better Blu-ray version) this is the best on the market in my opinion.",1468627200,29,337,5.222222222222222
