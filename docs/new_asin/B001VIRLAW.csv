8346490,1,B001VIRLAW,"An impossible task was put on the shoulders of these two iconic actors -- to save the movie from its flagrant mediocrity. A void in human exchange that embarrasses the intelligence. Or exactly like in the movie, sometimes a doctor needs to wash cars to make a living?",1505001600,,267,4.583333333333333

Really Liked the way the two actors portrayed the story characters plot.
Well Done !",1496102400,,175,4.46875

8346493,4,B001VIRLAW,"I was browsing the foreign movie section of my local library the other day and stumbled upon this. It wasn't so much the legendary French actors (Fanny Ardant and Gerard Depardieu) who appealed to me, but instead the fact that the movie plays out mostly in Israel.

""Hello Goodbye"" (2008 release from France/Israel; 99 min.) brings the story of a French couple (Alain, played by Depardieu, is Jewish; Gisele, played by Ardant, coverted when they married 25 years ago). Alain is a gynecologist and doing fine. Gisele not su much. It appears she is bored and looking for a new direction in her life. After much back-and-forth, the couple decides to visit Israel and ultimately to stay there. Then all kinds of misadventures befall the couple. Will Alain and Gisele stay together? Will they come to find their place in Israel? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is a pleasant romantic comedy, although more ""rom"" than ""com"". Second, the vast majority of the movie is set in Israel, and as such the movie becomes as much a travelogue of/about Israel than it is a romcom. I had the good fortune of visiting Israel for the first time in the Fall of 2010, and seeing this movie brought back a lot of good memories of this beautiful country. Bottom line: ""Hello Goodbey"" is nothing spectecular as such, but the movie flashed by in no time, and hence works nicely as mindless entertainment.",1362787200,2,1491,4.708812260536399
8346494,4,B001VIRLAW,Pretty funny using a serious contest! of course the artists are amazing and they blend well together. The film has  great scenic  moments too.,1356134400,,142,4.875
8346495,3,B001VIRLAW,"We rented 'Hello Goodbye' for two reasons: (a) we're enthusiastic supporters of Israeli cinema and you never know when you're going to uncover the next&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Syrian-Bride/dp/B000EHQ7JC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Syrian Bride</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broken-Wings/dp/B000255L98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Broken Wings</a>&nbsp;(among other gems); and (b) we're massive fans of Lior Ashkenazi and will watch anything in which he makes an appearance (see, for example,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walk-on-Water/dp/B0009YVBGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walk on Water</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Late-Marriage/dp/B00008H2NK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Late Marriage</a>&nbsp;- two unsurpassed viewing experiences).  He plays a smaller part here but is no less compelling.  'Hello Goodbye' is actually a French movie, but has one foot firmly planted in Tel Aviv.  Plus, there's Ashkenazi.  So, why not give it a go?

It is a pleasant enough movie.  Yes, I realize that that's a very lukewarm endorsement, but it's the best I can do.  If you're interested in Israeli culture, watching how the country tackles assimilation - especially as it relates to the complicated process of 'Making Aliyah' - and seeing how the secular and religious co-exist, then by all means watch 'Hello Goodbye.'  Though shtick-y at times, the movie does do a good job at detailing the disruption in lives and hard periods of adjustment that are part and parcel of a wholesale life shift that Grard Depardieu and Fanny Ardant's characters undertake here.  But is this film up to the standards set by Eytan Fox (Walk on Water,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bubble/dp/B000YMDJ02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bubble</a>) and Eran Riklis (The Syrian Bride,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lemon-Tree/dp/B002M36R50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lemon Tree</a>)?  Hardly not.

Plus, there's the increasingly difficult task of passing off Depardieu as a leading, romantic man, the mere image of which frightened my wife half to death.  Enough of that.",1286323200,4,2335,7.607407407407408
8346496,1,B001VIRLAW,"J guess I only have myself to blame that I actually watched this thing all the way through. The story was a little bit unbelievable - to leave Paris to live in a seedy part  of Tel Aviv -but with Ardant and Depardieu - two actors without peer - there must be some overall enjoyment.  But sad to say no - it is a very disjointed effort attempting to create humor out of exploding suitcases, tough Israeli immigration officers and a typically incompetent bureaucracy. The well remembered contrasts between the old and the new in Tel Aviv - the bazaar/markets adjacent to the David InterContintental- were just as I remembered them. Unfortunately as noted by other reviewers Depardieu's weight is a distraction and his Jewishness is a stretch. The worst, the very worst was the musical soundtrack - why the music was selected is a mystery. Brief bursts of Dee Clark's version of ""Little Bitty Pretty One"" appear out of the blue at high db levels for no apparent reason. A shambles of a movie, made no better by a decidedly weird interview with Ms. Ardant showing someone (? the director) around Tel Aviv, a city she clearly loves.

8346497,3,B001VIRLAW,"Does Shalom represent Hello or Goodbye? Neither. It means peace in a comprehensive way. You might feel peaceful while watching this movie, but it will likely be due to the fact that you are sleeping. Well, maybe you won't sleep. Maybe you'll just be annoyed at the 'artistic' implementation of abrupt audio cuts. I don't know you, so...

This is an independent film. It is nicely packaged, but the film is a low-quality grain. The acting is solid. The story is a slow paced, natural narrative, which can either be charming or grate the nerves. Cinematography is not too bad. In fact, some shots are inspired.

Mme Gaash's behavior is a bit confusing, but that's a part of the tale, so I won't go into that. It is in the script and whatever Ardant is forced to do, she does with dignity. Nice. Depardieu reminds me why I diet. I forgot how chubby he was and I guess it wasn't too long ago. Good job on the weight loss, Gerard! Mozel Tov! He gives a reliable performance in this role--believably this M. Gaash.

Although the direction was strong enough to support these wonderful actors, I'm not sure the script allows us to care. It's a storyline we already know: 1. Go to Israel. 2. Have various problems. 3. Adore Israel. 4. Hate the struggle. 5. Leave or don't leave... It's so common.

I don't know. I wouldn't recommend against this film. If you like truly, traditionally independent, you won't be disappointed. If you like Ardant, Depardieu, or Jean Benguigui, they are faithful and professional-- even committed.

Although, M. Gaash has a belated bris, the film doesn't really explore religious issues. It doesn't really explore anything. Think of it as basic voyeurism. It's people watching through a dirty window.

Yeah, that's it. People watching. I'd watch it again.",1268784000,9,1776,4.768729641693811
