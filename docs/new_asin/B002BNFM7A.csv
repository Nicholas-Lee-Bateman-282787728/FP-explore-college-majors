8361642,5,B002BNFM7A,"There are just a couple of problems with this DVD, however, I can still give it a 5-star, because of the value I think it has.  I do believe that this DVD will NOT be what many might want, so I will elaborate.  I like it, because it has very simple stick-like drawings to accompany the good explanations and demonstrations.  These thorough explanations and demonstrations certainly are slow, but need to be for one not knowing much.  You have time to learn and get into the pose and get to learn how each pose helps the body and mind. (Technically, it took me a little time to figure out how to maneuver the DVD, but once I did so, it was fine.)

Finally, after each pose is illustrated and explained, the viewer has the option of playing the second portion of the program, which is the full practice of all the parts...hence, a session.

This DVD most certainly would not be for one who just wants to jump into a more rapid and knowledgeable yoga experience, but it is very good for one who cannot move much due to injury, nor has much knowledge of yoga.  Right now, I can only do about 1/2 of the poses, but expect that as I continue, will be able to do more (except for where my injuries prohibit it.)  I would not hesitate to recommend it to those whose needs are similar.

P.S. I personally do not ascribe to the spiritual belief system of the program, so I just apply my own.  It is quite doable then.",1362787200,2,1407,4.295454545454546
