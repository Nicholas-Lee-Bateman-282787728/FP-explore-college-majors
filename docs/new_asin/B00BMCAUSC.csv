Beware ,en ordering anything from  TLA.Check other providers ,before ordering anything from TLA.",1398124800,,375,5.4655172413793105
8570753,1,B00BMCAUSC,"I don't know what this movie was about because it doesn't seem to be about ANYTHING! nothing happens here. two people meet, become friends...sort of, one becomes obsessed, is rejected, again and again. finally gets the message and goes into the woods to screw everyone. end of film. don't waste your time like I did.

actually, this movie doesn't even deserve the one star I gave it but I wanted to warn others of making my mistake.",1376265600,,432,4.6103896103896105
