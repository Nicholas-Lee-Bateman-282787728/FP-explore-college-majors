8473259,1,B001IE50ES,"This is a strange and pointless film that is based on a play that had been produced in Los Angeles.  The sad things it that it is full of wasted talent. Shawn Christian plays a man who gets into a relationship with a woman, played by Lisa German, who makes it clear that she is a supernatural being, which we learn--in this case--is a werewolf. The film is on a shoestring budget, and I always wonder why producers and directors who have minuscule budgets, choose to do these mystical things for which they have no money to do well. Had this stuck with being something closer to ""About Last Night,"" it might have had a chance. Both leads are very appealing and actually are good actors. German is quite good as the affected and disturbed Abby. Christian has been stuck in soap operas for most of his career, when he should have had better work. In this he plays his rakish but sensitive side quite well.

It's hard to tell if this film is trying to cash in on the current craze of the supernatural, ala ""True Blood,"" ""Twilight,"" or ""The Vampire Diaries.""  The supernatural element is never really shown. However, it's hard to understand why anyone thought this play had the right stuff to make for a good film otherwise.

This is one of those typical films that we American's find so often, in which the subject is supposed to be sexy, but every time the two characters start doing anything the film cuts away to something entirely different, and often not as interesting. Both leads are quite attractive, but they are asked only to show as much skin and do as many sexy things as any generic television show.

Beyond all of that, this film is tedious. It is too mysterious when it should be forthright, and too forward when it should be mystical. The tone is ever-shifting, and the entire result is stagey and reminds you that it was a play to begin with. A truly terrible and uneventful mess. Better luck to German and Christian in finding work deserving of their talents.",1328313600,,1974,4.533707865168539

8473261,5,B001IE50ES,"I purchased the DVD because Daniel from ""Days of our Lives"" soap opera was starring on it. It didn't disappoint me.",1284249600,,115,4.523809523809524
