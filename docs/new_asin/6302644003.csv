7828471,5,6302644003,I really like this tape the best because it got me sweating at the end.  The routine is simple so I can concentrate on the form and on burning calories instead of remembering what to do next.  I will definitely use this tape weekly.,1133136000,,232,4.25
7828472,3,6302644003,"I use this tape for my 'easy days'. But it is still enough to break a sweat, and it is a fun tape. The aerobic portion involves dance moves... and the music isn't bad for a work out tape. If you want any upper body work, you should use weights during the sculpting segments ---after you understand the moves, since they don't explain them on the tape.",1101168000,,351,4.253731343283582
7828473,5,6302644003,"I have tried every routine,tape and dvd out there and found this to be the best I have done and stuck to. The routine is easy to follow and the instructor is excellant and very motivational.
Of course, the tape is 10 years old, it always got me going! I unfortunly have missed place my tape and find it hard to to get that same feeling from others choices I have.",1022112000,4,363,4.126760563380282
7828474,5,6302644003,This video has an excellent combination of toning and aerobics that will have you seeing results within two weeks.  You can use weights in the toning sections to see better results.  It is not for beginners...you will get sweaty.  I have been using this video in my exercise routine for five years and I would be devastated if I lost this tape!  It is a must have and also worth checking out are the other tapes in the Redbook series.,984960000,10,434,4.3875
