457626,1,6302345359,"Things you should know about this DVD: It is a fullscreen sketchy print made from a vhs tape. Good movie, but you're better off getting a vhs.",1297641600,3,142,4.296296296296297
457627,4,6302345359,"The story line is almost original; A family man on the weekends - Pimp Daddy all week long.  A split persona all men crave (Bitter Sweet).  The Candy Man needs to make enough bread to retire and devote full time to family.  But leaving the game ain't easy. Rivals try to move in on his operation and shut him down for good.  But Candy Man handles his business.  The 007 style Rolls Royce with machine guns in the headlights is real ganster.  The crooked cops, the mob, Queen B and a few butch like females all want a piece of him.  Thumbs up - a must see black exploitation movie.
The movie is rare and hard to find-  Maybe someday - a REMAKE will come out.  Why not remake all the black exploitation movies? I can't get enough of it.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Candy-Tangerine-Man/dp/B00292SYSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Candy Tangerine Man</a>",1272931200,10,896,5.082191780821918
457628,1,6302345359,"Poor quality.  The lighting is so dark that at many points you're taking it on faith that the people are still in the shot.  Boring and oddly graphic (a man slices a woman's naked breast and other such things).  I ended up fast forwarding through much of it.  The plot is weak and very boring.  The Candy Tangerine man is not a good actor (neither is anyone else in the movie), and he's not as good looking as the script pretends he is.

There is a preview for a movie called Dolomite before it that looks potentially at least a little better than this one.  That preview was my favorite part of this movie.  Dolomite has an army of ladies who do his fighting for him.  There's also a sex scene in the preview that looks very real, like maybe he just set up a camera in his bedroom at home with his gf/wife.  Don't get me wrong, Dolomite looks a lot like this one with a poor plot and such, but I'd see it given the chance.

Don't let the kids watch this.",1243641600,,955,4.135869565217392

fun to watch but not worth a dvd release yet.",1334361600,,291,4.214285714285714
