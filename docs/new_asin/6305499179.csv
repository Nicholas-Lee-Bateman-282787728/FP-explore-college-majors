1037474,4,6305499179,"Not a P&P masterpiece (it looks very low budget in places and the acting but some of the minor characters is a bit ropey) but still an entertaining sub-Hitchcockian spy thriller making great use of the London Blackout as a plot device.

If you like P&P movies it's a must have.",1152230400,,277,4.431372549019608
1037475,5,6305499179,"I bought this movie because it was directed by Michael Powell, scripted by Powell and Emeric Pressburger, and starred Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson (a great important British director/producer/writer and two great stars).  I knew this hailed from just before Powell & Pressburger hit their stride as THE ARCHERS.  Boy, what a pleasant surprise; this is FIRST-RATE suspense/spy thriller which takes place in the early days of wartime Britian but before Pearl Harbor.  It's about a Danish sea captain who's forced to follow two missing and suspicious passengers while his ship is being temporarily held by the British.  What follows is a spy mystery through London during the days of Blackouts....and is ever bit as clever, amusing and suspenseful as any of Hitchcock's superb British sound films.  I URGE you to check out this great and little seeen British film classic.",1062288000,11,872,5.156028368794326
1037476,5,6305499179,"The 'old brands' are dead, so the newspapers say.  Owners of copyrights of The Three Stooges are desperately trying to get young people interested in them again, the Looney Tunes gang are being tricked out in hip-hop clothes (ick ick ick) to try to interest todays kids.....well, Conrad Veidt needs no such crutches.  True, the movie is in black and white which means today's youth won't watch it...til they grow a little older and learn that blacker is better (sort of like Gene Wilder and his Young Frankenstein.)  It's WWII and Veidt, a German actor, here plays a Danish ship captain (have to explain his accent) whose ship is halted overnight by customs on a through voyage.  A passenger (Valerie Hobson) jumps ship and Captain Andersen (Veidt) is determined to get her back at all costs.  They arrive via train in London in the middle of a blackout (one of the film's original titles) and Hobson proceeds to lead Veidt on a merry chase.  An excellent screen duo, if you like this movie you absolutely must get their first pairing, The Spy In Black.  That one will have you in tears at the ending!",1024790400,7,1101,4.644329896907217
1037477,5,6305499179,"'Contrabond' is only the second of the mighty Powell and Pressburger collaborations, and already we can see perfectly formed the unique, treasurable characteristics of their exhilerating genius.  A tale of spies tryig to outfoil the Nazis, if the film was intended as a propaganda effort, than it goes off the standard rails pretty quickly.  true, the central narrative arc, of an indifferent neutral forced to take a moral stand during the war, inspired by romance, is similar to the later 'Casablanca' (in which star Conrad Veidt featured) and many Humphrey Bogart films of the 1940s.
But it is in comparison to another future Bogart film that 'Contraband''s true flavour lies - 'the Big Sleep'.  Ken Russell has called it ' a light, romantic comedy with bondage overtones', and the relationship between the two leads begins with ship captain Veidt threatening to put intransigent passenger Valerie Hobson in irons.  Later scenes include the pair being roped toether in a dark basement spied on by Nazi voyeurs (including a coded lesbian), an escape involving Hobson's long legs as a knife, and badinage on a bus of flagrantly transparent doubles entendres.  the emphasis on grills, lifts and confined spaces, or fetishistic imagery such as an all-female nightclub band whose legs are mannequins', or the surreal attic stuffed with plaster busts of Chamberlain, add to this sexually fantastic atmosphere.  this is a spy thriller in which genre mechanics and development are always erotic, and in which the centre of activity is appropriately a cinema.  you could look at 'Contraband' as a benevolent version of Powell's later, darker masterpiece 'Peeping Tom'.
this is not to say the wartime setting is mere backdrop.  Like many of the Archers' films, there is a strong documentary element underpinning the fantasy, with a gorgeous montage of ships that could have come from an (unusually good) Grierson factual film (or Powell's earlier 'Red Ensign').  There is a rare vision of the London blackout with its practical difficulties (providing the film with its metaphors of light and darkness).  Magically, solid, urban London is turned by the enterprising captain into a navigable ocean.
Most characteristic of Powell and Pressburger is the tacit opposition between Nazism, with its nihilistic form of nationalism, and the beautiful portrait of the Danish emigres.  this at first seems to be a pretext for stereotypes and jokes about modern Vikings, but it soon becomes apparent that the Archers are celebrating this form of nationalism, free from blustering jingoism, one at ease in and with other cultures, one based on shared experience, history, friendship, loyalty and memory, on the civilised bonds of culture - food and music.  A remarkable film, with some of the most extraordinary, emotive camerawork and idiosyncratic editing in British cinema.",1003708800,19,2857,5.254945054945055
1037478,3,6305499179,"Conrad Veidt has those Caligari eyes that have always made him seem so sinister, and together with his thickly accented, nasal voice, they hurt an otherwise fine attempt at being a likeable hero.  The movie itself has a British-era Hitchcock feel to it, essentially a light-hearted espionage tale that begins aboard a Danish freighter (helmed by Veidt) confined at a British port for examination during wartime, and then leads by train into London during a blackout.  Veidt makes a good staunch captain, but his foray into romance with Valerie Hobson and the general equanimity of his written character don't jibe with his pinched appearance.  Not as charming or engaging as it could have been.",986256000,5,694,5.0701754385964914
1037479,4,6305499179,"This is a movie that just clicks.  It is just funny enough while also being just suspenseful enough with just enough  of a nice romance.  It opens with some close ups of some  very real ocean freighters which are just grubby enough to  know that they are not staged.  Conrad Veidt, probably best  known as the cruel Gestapo Major in Casablanca does comedy  quite while while looking the part of an iron tailed sea  captain.  Valerie Hobson is so cute and so funny that she also passes as a secret agent.  See this one and enjoy yourself.",971740800,10,537,4.43298969072165

1037574,4,6305499179,"If you're into Powell & Pressburger and have seen their later, better known films, you will probably want to take this one in. It's early but still stylish and, yes, ""Hitchcockian."" It's the sort of thing you'll like if you like this sort of thing. If this review is Greek to you, you'll probably want to pass.",1379808000,,310,4.456140350877193
1037575,4,6305499179,"If you think of ""The Red Shoes"" or ""I Know Where I'm Going"" as Anthony Powell's representative works, you are likely to be surprised by this film. It could easily be mistaken for an early Hitchcock. In places it even out-Hitchcocks Hitchcock. Whatever else, it is a fast-paced, atmospheric spy romp that entertains with strong performances from Conrad Veidt and Valerie Robson (who is as stylish and ironical as any of the great mystery women of this cinema age) and a witty script. There is an unusual lot of incidental or ""off-stage"" dialogue and acting, which Powell cleverly harvests with his moving camera, that adds to the pace and texture of the film-making. And a lot of the action is also conducted in black-out conditions (the film was released in the US under the title ""Blackout""), which Powell again plays well for suspense and laughs. There are plenty of good gags sprinkled through the action. The print seen here is far from perfect, unfortunately, though admirers of this director and these stars will probably not be put off.",1371168000,,1043,4.865168539325842
1037576,5,6305499179,"The movie was very entertaining and enjoyable to watch. A spy thriller with humor. Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson were top-notch as a Danish freighter captain and the spy who makes his life difficult. The use of a dark, blacked out London added to the suspense and tension as once familiar landmarks became foreign and threatening.",1358553600,,332,4.946428571428571
1037577,1,6305499179,"I expected this movie to be the current version of ""Contraband"" and it was an old black and white movie. Wasted my money on this one.",1357516800,,133,4.153846153846154
1037578,4,6305499179,"""Contraband"" (1940) is one of the first films to be released after WW 2 began in Europe. It was renamed ""Blackout"" for its US release. Conrad Veidt stars as a Danish ship captain and Valerie Hobson plays a passenger who steals a landing pass and travels to war-time London prompting Veidt to follow her. This was the second teaming of Veidt and Hobson (actor/actress) and Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger (writer/producer/director) following the popular ""The Spy in Black"" (aka ""U Boat 29""), a 1939 anti German film set in WW 1.

Conrad Veidt was one of the best known German silent screen stars, appearing in ""The Cabinet of Dr Caligari"" (1920) among other classics. An anti-Nazi married to a Jew, Veidt fled Germany in 1933 when Hitler took power. He moved to England and then the US in 1940 where, ironically, he played a Nazi in several films such as ""Nazi Agent"" (1942) and most memorably ""Casablanca"" (1942). Veidt died of a heart attack in 1943. his was one of his few heroic roles.

Perky Valerie Hobson (1917-98) was popular in the 30s with films like ""Clouds Over Europe"" (1939), ""Werewolf of London"" (1935), and ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935). In the 50s she married John Profumo and was his wife during the Christine Keeler scandal.

Hay Petrie (1895-1948) is a hoot in a dual role as Veidt's first officer and a restaurant owner. Look for Leo Genn (1905-78) as a villain. Genn was nominated for an Oscar for his role as Petronius in ""Quo Vadis"" (1951). Big Peter Bull (1912-84) is another Nazi. You'll remember Bull from his role as the Russian ambassador in ""Dr Strangelove"" (1964). And if you're fast you'll see the great Milo O'Shea making his film debut as a porter.

The film was produced and directed by Michael Powell (1905-90) and written by Emeric Pressburger. This was their second of 20 collaborations. Powell was a producer (30 films), writer (35 films), and director (60 films). Among his films are ""Pursuit of the Graf Spee"" (1956), ""Black Narcissus"" (1947), and ""A Canterbury Tale"" (1944). He was active in the WW 2 period with films like ""The Lion Has Wings"" (1939) and ""49th Parallel"" (1941).

Pressburger (1902-88) was a Hungarian Jew. He was nominated for an Oscar 4 times, for ""49th Parallel"" (1941), ""The Red Shoes"" (1948) and ""One of Our Aircraft are Missing"" (1942) and won for Best Writing for ""49th Parallel"". He worked often with Michael Powell on films such as ""49th Parallel"" (1941), ""Stairway to Heaven"" (1946), ""Tales of Hoffman"" (1951), and ""Pursuit of the Graf Spee"" (1956).

FWIW - Powell and Pressburger got into trouble with Churchill with ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" (1943) in which they argued that the British concept of honor made no sense when faced with an enemy like the Nazis. You can see the beginning of that idea in this film, a concept that was entirely absent in their earlier film ""Spy in Black"" (1939).

In his autobiography Michael Powell described the film as ""pure corn, but served up by professionals""

The top grossing films in 1940 were ""Fantasia"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Rebecca"", ""Boom Town"", and ""Santa Fe Trail"". ""Rebecca"" won for best picture, James Stewart (""Philadelphia Story"" was best actor, and Ginger Rogers (""Kitty Foyle"") was best actress. Other notable films that year were westerns like Spencer Tracy in ""Northwest Passage"", Gary Cooper and Walter Brennan in ""The Westerner"", and Errol Flynn in ""Virginia City"", comedies like Irene Dunne and Cary Grant in ""My Favorite Wife"", Cary Grant and Roz Russell in ""His Girl Friday"", and W.C. Fields as ""The Bank Dick"" and with Mae West in ""My Little Chickadee"".

Interestingly enough war films were not so popular in 1940 - Joel McCrea in ""Foreign Correspondent"", Charlie Chaplin in ""The Great Dictator"", and James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan in ""The Mortal Storm"" were among the only war films released that year.

The film is witty, fast paced, and filled with sexual innuendo. It has a vague feeling of being like a Hitchcock film, a characteristic of many of Powell/Pressburger's films. There are also traces of German expressionism, given the blackout conditions and the unusual locales. Even though made with the cooperation of the British government, it doesn't seem to be overtly political.

Bottom line - a fast paced witty suspense spy thriller from the early 40s.",1314316800,,4308,4.903846153846154
1037579,5,6305499179,"This was one of the very first films by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger before they cemented their partnership and called themselves ""The Archers."" It's also one of their best films, and a delight from beginning to end. As always with their films it's basically one-of-a-kind, although it is a spy film (like most of their early work during the war). You know something's up in the first scenes when the stern captain (Conrad Veidt) of a Danish freighter asks one of the passengers, Mrs. Sorensen (Valerie Hobson), to wear a life vest, which she refuses; when the ship is brought into a British harbor to determine its cargo (Denmark at this point was a neutral country, and might carry contraband), two of the passengers disappear--and one is Mrs. Sorensen. The captain determines he will hunt them down on the English shore and get an explanation. From there, the plot keeps turning in ways you won't expect; it's got all the touches of Hitchcock's British spy films from the 30s (there's a wild shootout in a warehouse full of busts of Neville Chamberlain, which seems to have all sorts of cathartic political implications for the UK at this time), but it's as much a screwball comedy as a thriller, and there are charming scenes in a Danish restaurant with its singing staff, and a great nightclub brawl. The use of Conrad Veidt as a romantic lead may be unprecedented for this point is his career, but he's tremendously helped by the unusual, swan-necked Valerie Hobson, who seems to match him somehow. The use of light is absolutely spectacular, as might be expected in a film by the Archers called ""Blackout"" in the United States (Powell himself later admitted this was a better title).",1283040000,,1699,4.802047781569966

Veidt makes his very clever escape to get help. He soon returns with some Danish help to root out the spies and rescue Hobson.
