It is also one of the most delightful operetta productions you will ever see, spectacular but also tasteful, imaginatively staged, and wonderfully sung--Schellenberger and Schukoff are luxury casting vocally, and they also can act and dance (!) and they look great.  A treat from beginning to end.",1191024000,34,371,5.065573770491803
2945089,3,B000VLMT4I,This DVD is listed as subtitled. I question that. No previous DVD from this source (Seefestspiele Mrbisch) has had subtitles. This is important because the productions from this venue are usually modified from the original composer's librettos and therefore difficult for non-German speakers to follow.

2945090,5,B000VLMT4I,"I've seen three live performances of Grfin Mariza and own the the 1970's film version on VHS. As it's one of my favorite operettas, I was really looking forward to seeing this production. Wonderful!!!!.The best production I've seen so far. The sets, the 1920's outfits, the acting and the singing couldn't be better. And finally two really good looking leads who can sing and act. Buy it- you'll enjoy it for many years to come. Now, I just want to address the two negative reviews as others have done. Like the reviewer, Peanut Gallery,- I  found the chicken,geese and duck ballet strange- actually slightly ""goofy"", but it is after all a comic operetta...Der Ring it ain't. It certainly would not have twisted my panties into such a wad that I couldn't watch the DVD through. He also stated that he waited in vain for ""Komm Zigann"". That's strange it's on the version I bought! And as for the second negative review from Campbell- as others have stated there are subtitles. The command to turn them on is on the main menu but it is in German. I'm not going to tell him what it is as I want him to learn how subtitles work so he'll never write such an idiotic review again. Speaking of subtitles -I was not totally pleased with the translation of the lyrics. If you don't understand German though they're fine and if you do just ask Mr. Campbell to show you how to turn off the subtitles.",1268179200,4,1389,4.511904761904762
2945091,4,B000VLMT4I,The 2 leads have spectacular voices but the guy who plays Populescu (Harald Serafin) cannot sing at all and is just played for laughs. Also the dancers in animal costumes during the overture has to be one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen! The subtitles are not that helpful (except for the spoken dialog) because the English is forced to rhyme and loses a lot of the meaning of the original German.,1231632000,5,410,4.554054054054054

2945093,4,B000VLMT4I,"J. Campbell should find the integrity to withdraw his lowly 3 star review which is based on the false premise that this production lacks English subtitles. [It has them].  I would also debate the one-star, ill-humored ""peanut gallery opium"" reviewer, who--it would appear--would have preferred that we watch the orchestra play the overture instead of seeing the imaginatively fun ""chicken"" dance ballet that accompanied the overture.
  All in all, this is a wonderfully staged performance, with very attractive singers.
  Lastly, I would mention that the ""Product Details"" specify that the video format is in a ratio of 1.33::1 (i.e., full screen); this is an error, the production is filmed in 1:77::1 (i.e., widescreen).  [For those of us who have widescreen TVs, this is not an unimportant purchasing variable, and it is curious to me that, every now and then, you will run into advertisements (like this one for Grafin Mariza) that incorrectly retrograde the video features of the production].",1216598400,4,997,5.238993710691824
2945094,4,B000VLMT4I,"Lovely choreography, but a brickbat for whoever added the ballet to the Overture. Silly dances may be OK in operetta; stupid dances are not. Likewise the cabaret ballet is superfluous and bad taste. The acting is wonderful.  Nikolai Schukoff is a gem all round. The subtitling of the songs is witty; I suspect a different translator for the dialogue. They shouldn't have cut out the explanation of why Tassilo is popular with the tenant farmers (he persuaded the Countess to give them half of the harvest). Pity they left out the ""Mr Turek"" song, too. Splendid 1920's costumes; all credit to the girls for managing them in lethally high heels. You get used to the microphones.

2945095,1,B000VLMT4I,"Having seen a wonderful German film of this Operetta in the seventies, I was so excited when I saw that Countess Maritza has been released on DVD and I was so looking forward to receiving it.  I had misgivings as soon as I started watching the DVD and saw the silly ""farmyard"" ballet in the opening sequence.  A heavy handed attempt at humour if ever there was one.  It didn't get any better from there on, in fact I could not even watch it to the end.  Any resemblance between the Countess Maritza that I knew and this stupid production was purely accidental.  There was not one single redeeming feature, I waited in vain to hear ""Komm Zigany"", the wonderful haunting song that made me fall in love with this Operetta all those years ago.  I see one of the other reviewers remarked that these Moerbisch Productions are often modifed from the original libretto, that's an understatement.  What's the point of taking a wonderful Operetta with lovely music and beautiful songs and turning it into burlesque?  This production was more like a silly amateurish school concert than an Operetta.  The lovely music was barely recogniseable, there was more talking than singing.  Kalman must be turning in his grave.  I am so sorry that I wasted my money on this trash.",1204329600,15,1260,4.681818181818182

Despite this major change in background lighting, the stage lighting and images remained excellent.  It was almost like being in the audience.  The singing was clear -- all of the vocals were beautifully done.  I can think of no better DVD for those who are seeking a first experience in this musical form.  Those who have seen this operetta live will not be disappointed.",1201910400,5,787,4.770370370370371

I found the four principals absolutely delightful. They are extraordinary actors, fantastic singers and very good looking people. I especially liked Dagmar Schellenberger; I had never seen or even heard of her before.
I watched this operetta three days in succession, I thought that much of it.
It is a great, and welcome, addition to my operatic DVD collection

8219326,5,B000VLMT4I,"I first became acquainted with the ""Countess Maritza"" when I was a boy in law school a half century ago, when I bought a three record supplement to the ""Reader's Digest Treasury of Operetta."" I would listen as I studied, and quickly feel in love with the musical excerpts presented.

In the years that have followed, I have maintained my interest in operetta, and the Countess Maritza. But while I have purchased CDs of the
operetta, I had never seen a performace of the operetta. I finally broke down and bought this version.

This is a wonderful production of of Kalman's masterpiece. Kalman's operetta is the music of the now long gone Austria-Hungry. Waltzes, mazurkas,
and gypsy music. Kalman is equally at ease in all.

I rank this work with Lehar's ""Merry Widow."" Even the lesser numbers sparkle. This is a work of melody, a work of rhythm.

The singer/actors that perform Maritza, Tassilo, Lisa and Zuspan are first-rate actors and singers, and they all demonstrate the can dance and
move on stage. I also enjoy Populescu's interpretation of his role, as well as the work of the ensemble. All these characters were extremely
well cast. The only miscast, in my opinion, was Tassilo's aunt. She was an unattractive, which made here unbelievable as Populescu's erstwhile
love interest. The ""barnyard ballet"" during the overture was, to say the least, a mistake.

But notwithstanding the two weak spots I have referenced, This is a terrific production of a great operetta. Buy it!",1477872000,,1484,4.896414342629482

To turn on the English subtitles is not easy. After I complained to the vendor, he told me how to do it. To highlight the option you need to read through two screens of Gothic German text.

The lighting is not uniform. Many scenes are dark, seem to use only ambient light, while others are really bright. There appeared to be little thought given to lighting for the small screen. The two lead singers are good but some of the supporting singers, most notably, the gypsy fortune teller is terrible. The melodies will always be spectacular.

Having viewed it, I immediatrly went out for a copy of her Widow, with Rodney Gilfry, which knocks the inferior Opera Australia production into a cocked hat.

It is difficult to review Mariza without an excess of superlatives, so I will limit mtself to a couple of minor criticisms. The subtitles need proof reading. I mean, dressep for dressed, and exhausted for excited. Careless mistakes that were easily avoidable. The other is that the entrance of Tante Bozi in the third act drags.

That said, this is my second copy, purchased for some friends I thought would really appreciate it.

8219335,5,B000VLMT4I,"An altogether imaginative, sparkling staging of Kalman's masterpiece.  Schellenberger and Schukoff sing beautifully, have genuine chemistry and could give lessons in acting to other singers.  Yes, there are subtitles on this DVD; they are not, however a literal translation but rather an English version of the lyrics.  The one weakness of the production is that the director stuffed the normally very short third act with interpolated music from another Kalman operetta and a lot of tedious comic schtick.  The result is a very long act filled with bad Broadway-style dancing (note to Central European operetta directors: stick to what you're good at) and short on moving the story along.  Luckily, the rest of the production is so delightful that this shouldn't dissuade you from buying this DVD.",1302652800,,798,5.251968503937008
