2076310,5,B0002CGZ0U,Enie Kovacs Rules as a swindler of rich widows who ends up getting swindeled in return. It's a hilarious must see filmnoir classic!!,1103587200,5,132,4.782608695652174

8026124,4,B0002CGZ0U,"DVR will not play in all machines. YMMV.
Kovacs always seems reigned in by movies. In this, he stars and is more at ease with the plot and the characterization of the scheming cad as a lead, but it's not until Saunders shows up that the movie kicks into gear.
It's of its time, with a lightly twisty ending. I love Ernie, but this would have been much more fun if it were a Preston Sturges film. It's more charming than funny; I was charmed, but I love Ernie and George Saunders is always a treat.",1486080000,,497,4.1875
8026125,1,B0002CGZ0U,A comedy without even a smile in it?  What a disaster.  This must have embarrassed everyone connected with it.  No wonder Sanders killed himself.,1479340800,,145,4.958333333333333

8026131,3,B0002CGZ0U,What a waste to have such a fine performer such as Kovacs wasted on an uneven script. Premise for this movie often fails to deliver the laughs.,1364947200,,143,4.333333333333333
