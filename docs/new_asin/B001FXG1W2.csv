8302990,5,B001FXG1W2,"This was shown on PBS years ago, but it's fun to see where our tax dollars go.  Being old, it's a little dated.",1394928000,,111,3.8260869565217392

8302993,4,B001FXG1W2,"I have both On Board Air Force One and Secret Access Air Force One DVDs. I like the second one better. It gives much more information about behind the scenes support to Air Force One. Both DVDs do not provide information on the airplane itself that general populate are not already know. Many ""I could tell you but then I would have to kill you"" sentiments in the films.",1351036800,,370,4.3768115942028984

8302995,4,B001FXG1W2,"An excellent overview of the President's plane and of the staff who maintain same.  The staff are all very dedicated to their jobs and to keeping our president safe and comfortable.  I admire the Air Force men who want to be a part of the staff, enough so that they spend two years just on polishing detail.  This program should be shown in schools.",1252886400,10,349,4.421875
8302996,5,B001FXG1W2,Great DVD.  There was a lot of information given about the support operations (behind the scenes stuff) that you typically don't see.  There's even a tour of the Presidential quarters by President Bush himself.  This is a must DVD for anyone who is an Air Force One fan or anyone who is interested in military operations.,1228089600,12,321,4.696428571428571
