1676713,5,B00005YU82,"I can't wait for this DVD to be out, Friends is the greatest show on TV ever, and their first season is one of the best... this is a keepsake DVD without doubt :)",1012521600,,162,3.7941176470588234
1676714,5,B00005YU82,"Friends is one of my all-time favorite series and while the Best Of DVDs are nice, they keep skipping excellent episodes such as ""The Princess Leia Fantasy"" and the 2-part ""Ross and Rachel Take a Break,"" and while those are third season episodes, it's nice to know they'll soon be covered.  The first season's excellent though, and I look forward to seeing all the original uncut and extended episodes, most of which I'll be seeing uncut for the first time.  Now if only we could get DVD treatment for shows such as Seinfeld and Married With Children...",1012262400,8,553,4.690721649484536
1676715,5,B00005YU82,"Finally, Warner Brothers comes to their senses and releases Friends on a season by season basis instead of those ""best of"" collections which is good but not as good as season by season.
The first season is probably one of the best seasons of the Friends show.  It's hysterical and one of the best shows on television.",1011830400,9,317,4.56140350877193

1676748,5,B00005YU82,"After watching this I wondered why the hell nobody suggested me this earlier, I've watched 10 seasons within one month only, I could not sleep without watching its episode and then one led to another, so basically I could not sleep properly for one complete month but I do not regret it a bit, its worth every second. And after completing this also I never get over this, I watch clips as youtube keeps them recommending and I just cant ignore them, again one led to another and almost I watch them as much time I don't have to do other stuffs. I love falling for Rachel over and over again, she is a dream and I took Ross and Rachel story as main lead, although there were no leads exactly, everyone have there own screen space, Joey, even not being a known friend from their college time made best impression within the group, as a friend, a lover, a human and entertainer. Monica is a very strong character which you do not just want to mess around, and Pheobe could make any moment different on which Chandler can make you laugh and Ross try to convince you for something but he lost his way finding too much logic. You cannot imagine Friends without anyone of them, their bonding, fight, laughter, games, logic, roaming around, passing time, you just want to be there every time. You can feel that you're a part of them, you may not be their friend, but they are yours, they advise on anyhting and everything about any situaton, watching this so fast made major change in me, I can feel that, I'm much happier now, and whenever I feel sad, or doing like nothing I re-watch any random clip, just make me lighter and happier. I haven't yet started watching any TV Shows after watching this, just don't want to get over this, And if you've not watched it yet you just don't know what a sitcom content could be.",1493510400,,1812,4.411940298507463

They cut out a few minutes worth of dialogue and plot to shrink it for TV. The full length episodes are on the DVDs.).

I really like the fact that it's in a case like a single dvd. So I don't have a thick case to lug around or try and store.

The only thing I didn't like was if you're just deciding on one episode, it has a coffee cup next to it. And I didn't know that it was for a preview of the episode. So I got all comfy and excited and it just played the beginning part and went straight back to the coffee cup. I clicked it numerous times trying to figure out how to play the whole episode and even slowly fast forwarded it, but that just took me to the preview of the next episode. I finally went back to the menu and saw at the bottom of the screen the explanation of the coffee cup. I don't really see how this is handy, but to each his own!",1398643200,,890,3.78494623655914

Those around me would water cooler the show and when asked what I thought I would reply with one simple question: WHAT HAPPENED TO BEN? Ross was written as a sweet caring loving guy who, after 3 divorces, finally gets the girl. To me, he is an absentee father. Period. The writers never address Ben's absence from Ross' life. EVER. That make Ross a deadbeat dad in my book and I hope the copy girl gave him herpes. Harsh? I am not sorry. I am single dad of a now six year old boy. I have ALWAYS been in his life. I have him four out of seven days a week. Where's my Rachael? Single dads have enough to battle without the industry making it okay to abandon a child.

1677290,4,B00005YU82,"What is it about the show Friends?  I simultaneously love it because it makes me laugh and enjoy the camaraderie that the people on it share and hate it because it reminds me that my life is nothing like theirs (well, except for maybe the hard to date part).  But regardless, it did get popular for a reason.

Friends is about a group of six friends.  Three girls, three boys.  There's Monica and Ross, brother and sister, Joey and Chandler, roommates who live across the hall from Monica, Phoebe, who is their hippy friend, and Rachel, who comes into the group after running out on her wedding.  Their lives are filled with exploits, bad dates, misadventures but at the end of the day they all have each other.

Obviously there's a lot of character interaction in this show.  It's what it is all about.  My least favorite character is probably Ross.  I just find him annoying and over dramatic.  And his crush on Rachel gets wearisome as well.  Especially in the beginning as he is always mopey and brings the tone of the show down.  The best character is Chandler.  I love his sense of humor, think he's cute, and find him quite endearing.  He's the best one.  All the others have their place of course.  It just wouldn't be Friends without any of them.

Nothing is life or death in this show (well except when there is a death, but that's beside the point).  It's more just ordinary people trying to get through their lives.  Or at least ordinary tv show people, noone has that close knit a group of friends, at least that I've encountered.  I also like how they all have their flaws.  Monica with her obsessiveness, Chandler with his commitment problems, Joey with his intelligence.  They also have the struggles of job woes, finding a place to live and general relationship issues.  But above all it is an entertaining show filled with laughs.  There's an out loud giggle at least once an episode.

While the beginning seasons aren't my favorite of this show, they're worth it to get to the later seasons.  And they aren't terrible by any means.  If you like humorous sitcoms you'll like this series.

My wife introduced me to Friends, as I was one of those men who just never really watched it growing up. One Christmas I surprised her and bought all 10 Seasons and included a special ""coupon"" that I would watch every episode with her before next Christmas. I made good on my promise, and after watching all 10 seasons, I become a fan. Sure there are things to criticize, and I there are other series (like Arrested Development) that I personally like more, but Friends will always be a staple.

1677361,5,B00005YU82,"You gotta wonder that when the idea about six friends in a coffee shop was first presented, did anyone consider how much of an impact that series would have over the next decade.  Well, whether anyone gave that a thought or not, this first season of Friends set the six characters up for the next ten years, giving us people we could relate to and people we came to care about.  By the end of the first season, everyone was asking those important questions needed to sustain the series:  Will Ross and Rachael get together?  Who's that with Ross at the airport?  Who is Rachael's hair stylist?  Will Joey make it as an actor?  Does Chandler's hair make him look a bit like Emilio Estevez?  There were of course many more things to ponder, but these should get you going.  So, go out and get the first season of this series and, if you really want to, get your hair cut like Rachael...I'll leave that second decision up to you.",1378684800,,926,4.4

It's hilarious and dramatic. I recommend this to anyone teen or older because there's some iffy material and sex.

In Ep. 1 I am about half way in and they have already skipped a few lines. If they are gonna miss some of it they shouldn't charge you.

Ex 1: When Chandler is making fun of Joey for being in Pinocchio there is line that is missing. After Chandler runs out of the apartment Joey goes "" You should all know hes a dead man""

Ex 2: When Rachel is cutting her credit cards they skip a whole bunch. She first cuts up a library card and says shes feel great and there's  no need to do more and Monica goes that's just a library card.

1677558,4,B00005YU82,"I had unfortunately never seen a full episode of Friends until I got this DVD set. I decided to take a chance on the series because my friends always remark on how awesome it is, even though it was a show from the mid-90s to mid-2000s. And I must say, I really liked this first season! Ross has to deal with his ex-wife while trying to express how he feels about Rachel. Rachel is getting used to being a coffee girl and living independently of her father. Monica is dealing with her parents constantly nagging on her. Joey is trying to find modeling and acting jobs. Chandler is trying to meet women (and has a girlfriend for a while) when people occasionally mistake him for being gay. And Phoebe works as a masseuse and keeps looking out for the ""Naked Man"" that lives across from Monica's apartment.

Altogether these characters have very great chemistry. I don't usually laugh when I am watching something alone, but this show has made me laugh out loud a couple of times. I don't know if this was a problem with just the DVD I had or if it's present on all DVDs, but I was not able to play some of the episodes in this disc. Rather than see the full episode, all it showed was a 30-second clip, and nothing more. Most of the episodes did play, however, so I was fine for the most part. Also, even though I would say I have gotten a good first impression of this TV series, I would admit that it seems a bit outdated in comparison to other sitcoms that can nearly perfectly relate to contemporary times. In that sense, I wouldn't consider this a ""timeless"" show, but it is still good for something from the 1990s. It's definitely got me interested enough to get all the other seasons.",1307577600,,1689,4.3789808917197455

1677561,3,B00005YU82,"Although the show looks painfully dated, it's still very funny and watchable, even in repeat viewings. I bought the entire series a season at a time for my wife and watched them with her. On our little 27"" tv they looked merely ""ok"" but on hour high-def 42"" they look awful. Even my $900 Oppo blu-ray player can't upscale them to clarity. Yeah, I know they're 4:3 ratio, yeah, I know they were likely shot on video but that's no excuse for this. I have loads of DVD's that look really good on my TV, these are barely watchable. Hopefully they'll fix it for a blu-ray release, but then I'll have to buy them all over again.

1677636,5,B00005YU82,"Right from the start, this show proves itself to be on the funniest and most innovative comedies ever to have graced American TV screens.  The pitch-perfect casting and the diversity of the six central characters is what propelled this sitcom to comedy perfection.  This was truly an ensemble cast and the deletion of any one of the characters would have been disastrous to the series as a whole.  I also think the naming of the episodes deserves mention for sheer cleverness as who doesn't discuss an episode of any series by using the words ""the one where..."".

Some of my personal favorites from season one:

""The One with the Boobies"" in which Rachel gets more of an eyeful than she wanted.  Joey must also deal with the realization that his parents are people too and that he won't always understand their motivations.

""The One with the Stoned Guy"" contains classic scenes of Joey teaching Ross how to talk dirty which is easily one of the funniest exchanges in the history of the series.  Chandler's reaction when he stumbles upon the two is nothing short of classic.

""The One Where Nana Dies Twice"" introduces us to Chandler's ambiguously gay side and results in Chandler's being dissed by one of his homosexual coworkers.

""The One with the Ick Factor"" spotlights Monica's very bad choice in dates.  Her reaction upon learning the true age of her new man is hilarious and it is truly an episode with a great deal of ""ick factor"".

""The One Where Rachel Finds Out"" kick starts the series-long Rachel and Ross saga.  Their on-again-off-again romance has to be one of the most well-known TV romances and was a plot device that helped keep viewers tuning in episode after episode.  Who among us hasn't suffered from unrequited love?  We can't help but cheer Ross and Rachel on and suffer a sense of disappointment as Rachel's eventual discovery of feelings for Ross turns out to happen too late.

The great thing about this show is that even though I have seen many of these episodes many times I never tire of them.  This is classic TV, particularly for those of my generation who were right there with the characters, experiencing the same relationship issues and career crises.  I was heartbroken when this series ended and miss it to this day.  Thank goodness it lives on in the immortality offered by DVD.",1203897600,2,2316,4.73067331670823

1677704,5,B00005YU82,"I've been a Friends fan ever since it first aired in 1994. Watching the first season again reminded me of why I fell in love with the show in the first place - strong characters and fantastic writing. From the pilot onwards, each character had a distinct voice and could carry their own storylines.

It's also one of the few shows on television that can make me really laugh out loud. Who could forget Joey giving Ross advice on how to talk dirty? Or a flustered Chandler stuck in an ATM vestibule with a Victoria's Secret model? Or Monica pulling back a shower curtain to sneak a peek at Joey's 'pee-pee', only to find it was Joey Sr. soaping up in there?

Not to mention, the building up of the characters' histories that play out into the entire series. Season 1 is where Ross finds out his lesbian ex-wife is pregnant with his child. It is where we first see Monica's strained relationship with her parents, especially her mother. We see Chandler's countless insecurities and his use of humor as a defense mechanism. We see Rachel struggle to get her footing in her completely new life. I especially love how they incorporated the character of Ursula, the ditzy waitress from Mad About You as Phoebe's twin sister. I also love seeing how Joey's character develops from a 'typical playboy' to a guy with real heart (as seen in TOW the Boobies, and TOW the Birth).

The DVDs also include great bonus features for fans (though I personally wish there was more). The pilot has an audio commentary from the producers of the show. Plus, there's never before seen footage in each episode -  it's always fun to try and spot those scenes.

This is definitely some of the best television ever. No wonder 13 years later, people are still watching.",1178236800,2,1740,4.6
1677705,1,B00005YU82,"To be honest, I used to like this show. Watched probably half the seasons as they aired. Along the way, however, I came across a game in a store - the ""Friends Trivia Game"", for ages 10 and above!?!?

This was an eye opening moment for me, when I realized that this show was being marketed for pre-teens. The show not only has promiscuity in it, it glorifies promiscuity. The viewer is bombarded with the message that, if you have not had sex in over a month (whether or not you are in any kind of relationship), there is something wrong with you. (Not to mention characterizing Ross as a ""freak"" for having only slept with his wife.)  I was appalled that kids would be watching this (or parents letting them).

Then, of course, I started to wonder why the @#!!  I was watching the show myself.

In past years, sitcoms, especially those airing at 8pm prime time, took a cautious look at sex and, if the episode even gravitated in that direction at all (writers did not rely so heavily on ""sex sells"" in the past), explored the emotional aspects and the very real consequences to having sex (especially while too young).

Not anymore, though. Now, we get TV (marketed to kids) that promotes sex without any consequences whatsoever, whether it be a one night stand or an adulterous affair. (Chandler is sleeping with another man's wife, and his friends are not appalled because he is committing adultery, but rather because it's Janice?!?!)

Friends - a sad testimony to the decline of American culture.",1175126400,14,1501,4.6415094339622645

1677708,5,B00005YU82,"Friends is arguably the most popular sit com of modern times.  (Or second most if it comes in behind Seinfeld.)  After ten seasons, it still airs countless times in repeats every day.  But here is a way to see where it all began with season one.

And it begins with us making new friends.  There's Joey (Matt LeBlanc), the aspiring actor who is slightly clueless about the real world, Chandler, (Matthew Perry), the sarcastic data cruncher, Ross (David Schwimmer), a paleontologist who just found out that his wife is a lesbian and, oh yeah, is pregnant with their child, Monica (Courtney Cox), Ross's sister and an aspiring chef, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), a singer/masseuse with a karmic outlook on life, and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), the spoiled rich girl who just left her fiance at the alter.

Like most first seasons, the series is still developing here, but many things are established.  We see Chandler and Joey get their foosball table, Monica deal with pleasing her parents, Phoebe encounters her twin sister, Rachel starts waitressing at Central Perk, and Ross gets his pet monkey.

Most storylines are concluded in one episode, but there are a few story arcs.  The biggest, of course, is Ross and Rachel.  They'd continue to tease us with this storyline for all ten years.  Here, Ross has a crush on the oblivious Rachel.  They build it up all season only to end with the first of many Ross/Rachel cliffhangers.

The cast jumps right into their parts and the laughs start from the very first episode.  You honestly believe that are friends.  There is a charm to this season that got lost somewhere during the second half of the run even if the subject matter is decided more mature on the whole then later seasons.

Yes, you can still watch Friends on TV at least once a day.  But if you love Friends, this is a great way to get all 24 episodes of the first season uncut.",1171929600,2,1879,4.6626139817629175

You meet these people for the first time sitting in what would become the world famous coffee house, ""Central Perk"". You are introduced to these characters who you quickly identify with and come to love within the first five minutes. Throughout the season, you follow the lives of the six friends as some struggle with being on their own for the first time, while others struggle with relationships and divorce. You get to witness six young, unknown actors who have no clue as to how big they are going to make this show. It delivered week after week with some of the funniest dialogue and situations you could imagine. Heck, within the first couple of episodes, you find out Ross is getting divorce from his wife because she found out she was a lesbian and started cheating on him with another woman. Then just when you think his life couldn't get any more complicated, you find out Ross' ex is pregnant with his baby. And from there it only gets better. The writing is superb and acting and chemistry between the actors is one in a million. If you are going to buy one show on DVD, by this show. Start at the beginning where it all started. You will not be disappointed. Watch as these six people go through the ups and downs of their lives, struggle with real life issues, and wonder how their lives will turn out. Watch as these six start to understand their strength in each other and realize that no matter what the problem, anything can be overcome with a little help from your friends.",1153699200,2,1711,4.558441558441558

-""Phoebe: Here's my money. But you should all know, it's cursed.

1677767,4,B00005YU82,"The premise was pretty simple. Friends followed the lives of six New York suburbanites in their mid-twenties. But NBC won the Lottery when the executives put together six nondescript actors whose very palpable chemistry gave the show its potent magic. It's hard to believe that these actors separately were not a success, some of them having failed in prior sitcoms. Friends changed all that and gave this ensemble cast stellar status and opportunities to branch out and do various endeavors in their craft. The series began with a cast of stereotypes: the ditzy hippie, the princess, the next-door hard-luck girl looking for love, the Italian stud, the sad sack nerd and the smart-alec. But it wasn't long before we knew them more intimately as Phoebe, Rachel, Monica, Joey, Ross and Chandler. This was indeed a true ensemble cast, with any of the six actors carrying the starring role at any given episode.

The main engine of season one (and some of the other seasons) was the Ross and Rachel romance, which left the fans on tenterhooks. But a key part of the show's drawing power was that, while other sitcoms were static, Friends wasn't afraid to evolve as the years went on. We witnessed a decade's worth of the gang maturing, assuming new vocations, engaging in romantic entanglements (some serious, some just plain ridiculous), becoming parents and some of the friends becoming more than friends. Over time, the hit show became the comedy of choice for the television viewing audience, consistently delivering their welcome brand of familiarity, easy rapport and witty humor. The show with regularity scored in the top ratings and won several Emmy and Golden Globe awards, as well as numerous other accolades.

Friends became the staple of my Thursday night viewing, never ever to be missed. I still recall the sadness that washed over me when the last episode aired. All good things must come to an end, I know. Thankfully, I have this 4-dvd set, wherein I can revisit and enjoy time and again what I consider to be the best situation comedy series ever. Now the viewer can be privy to  extended versions of their favorite episodes, including footage never before seen on TV.

By virtue of being the freshman year, this season is the most ragged. The actors were still trying to key in on their roles and had yet to make their characters truly their own. Chandler, Phoebe and Joey were particularly not as fleshed out as the rest of the cast. But the season was still peppered with luminous episodes. My favorites of Season One:

The One with the East German Laundry Detergent - Ross and Rachel do laundry and Rachel kisses Ross for the first  time; Chandler and Phoebe become break-up buddies (this is the debut of the nasally-challenged Janice, who would plague Chandler for the rest of the series); Joey and Monica go on a hilarious double-date.

The One with the Boobies - most of the cast engage in trying to catch each other nude; a more serious plotline deals with Joey's unfaithful father; no one likes Phoebe's insightful shrink boyfriend (Fisher Stevens).

The One with All the Poker - it's the gals vs. the fellas in a pokerfest, culminating in a showdown between Ross and Rachel (who will fold?); this is where we really notice Monica's streak of competitiveness; this is a great episode.

The One Where Rachel Finds Out - in the season finale, Ross goes to China; Rachel finds out Ross loves her (but Chandler says he loves her too); Rachel buys flowers and goes to the airport to meet Ross on his return; but there's a snag...

The special features were disappointing and is the reason this dvd version gets 4 stars, and not its deserving 5. A seminal show such as this deserves to have a better set of bonus goodies. There's a Central Perk interactive map, clips of guest stars (Friends of Friends), a trivia quiz and a Season Two trailer. There is one informative commentary done by the executive producers on the first episode The Pilot, where they go into fascinating detail about the extensive selection process of the ensemble cast. Future complete season dvds would have more than just one episode with commentary. But the fans would've infinitely preferred hearing the thoughts of the actual stars. Sorry, folks, but outtake segments weren't available until the fifth season dvd came out.

Some cool Friends fun facts:

Surprisingly, Chandler was one of the more difficult roles to cast. Bright, Kauffman and Crane had interviewed hundreds of actors in vain and were at their wits' end. They were beginning to doubt the quality of the writing and humor of Chandler Bing. Then Matthew Perry tested and that was that.

The producers originally had Janeane Garofalo in mind when envisioning Monica. Courtney Cox originally was slated for Rachel's character but wanted instead to try out for Monica.

Working titles for this show were Six of One, Friends Like Us, Across the Hall, and Insomnia Caf.

Joey's pick-up line ""How you doin'?"" was ranked #4 in TV Guide's ""TV's 20 Top Catchphrases"" (August 2005 issue).

Rachel is the only one to have kissed all the Friends.

The producers, in originally pitching the show, saw Monica and Joey as the hot couple. It wasn't until they actually started writing the script that they realized the focus needed to be on Ross and Rachel.

As per prior sitcoms, the powers-that-be wanted an older character (a father or grandpa figure...) included in the cast to play the sensible, go-to-for-advise role. But wiser heads prevailed.",1150070400,3,5495,4.865096359743041

Even though Season One isn't my all time favourite there are still classic episodes and classic moments. This is A Dream First Season. It really did start off with a bang. It didn't take 4 of 5 seasons for the show to finally get going, it literally just won everybody over from the start.

1677794,3,B00005YU82,"Friends was an entertaining show with characters you cared about that was able to keep a dedicated and loyal fan base for ten seasons -- an enviable achievement for any sitcom. Shows like Bewitched and The Cosby Show limped lamely to the end of their runs and should have left the air years before. But Friends stayed on top for its entire run. For that, Friends deserves its good rep.

However, when NBC, during Friends' final season, started bellowing that its was ""The Greatest Sitcom of all time,"" I balked (especially since Frasier ended its run at around the same time). I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners, The Dick Van Dyke Show, All in the Family, Maude, The Bob Newhart Show, MASH, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Sanford & Son, Cheers, Seinfeld, Frasier, The Simpsons and Everybody Loves Raymond, to name a few, deserve that title more.

1677799,4,B00005YU82,"My Top Ten Favorite Episodes -

# 1 - The One with the Blackout - Hilarious episode from start to finish. Really sets the stage for Ross & Rachel & Ross's feelings for her in the series. The cat on the balcony steals the show as far as comedy goes.

# 2 - The One with the Candy Hearts - The women were at the top of their game in this episode. Phoebe's eccentric-ness comes out hilariously when she decides that the women need to have a bonfire in Monica's living room as a clensing ritual to rid them of all the bad men they dated. A great episode for Chandler breaking up with Janice (Again!) and the funny awkwardness of it.

# 3 - The One with the Monkey - Marcel steals the show here as he is more popular at the party than Ross is. Chandler and Janice's first breakup is a riot.

# 4 - The One with All the Poker - A great guys vs girls episode. A funny episode (especially Marcel's song) that had the touch of nice emotion when Ross & Rachel go head to head in poker at the end.

# 5 - The One Where Rachel Finds Out - A nice cliff-hanger leaving you with the feeling that this series is going somewhere and there is more to the characters than just laughs. You really pull for Ross & Rachel to get together.

# 6 - The Pilot - While funny it is depressing at times, but it set the stage for all the characters, especially Ross & Rachel's future romance.

# 7 - The One with the Boobies - Very funny episode. Chandler accidently sees Rachel's boobs when he walks in the apartment so she tries to see Chandler naked to even it up. She ends up seeing Joey in the shower (with a sandwhich!) and Joey's father.

# 8 - The One with Mrs. Bing - Introducing Chandler's wild mother who kisses a drunk Ross (because he is having issues with Rachel & Paolo) The whole storyline with Mrs Bing was top-notch. The B-storyline of Monica and Phoebe taking care of a guy they distracted and got hit by a bus and in a coma is rather weak and boring.

# 9 - The One with George Stephanoploulos - Funny episode where the girls get George's pizza by accident. They wonder about him sexually which leads them to discuss the guys (Ross, Joey & Chandler) and wonder about them romantically. The women had interesting insights (which led to different matchup possibilities). A real guys vs girls episode.

# 10 - The One with the Dozen Lasagnas - Phoebe shows true friendship with Rachel by confessing that Paolo hit on her when she was massaging him. The end of Rachel and Paolo helped set things in motion (eventually) between Ross & Rachel.

1677800,5,B00005YU82,"I first saw Friends when it was on its 6th season, the episode TOW Joey Loses His Insurrence. I became a fan of it after TOW Ross Got High aired. I didn't want to ruin the suspense, so I stopped watching season six and bought the first season dvd. Man, did I laugh outloud. It explained clearly why it had become a world wide hit. The first episode alone had so much comedy in it that you just had to love it. The other episodes contained the same amount of comedy. As the season progressed, we see Ross and Rachel's friendship becoming stronger and we witnessed them become best friends.

And as for Mondlerism, you can clearly see it in TOW The Birth where Chandler comforts Monica. There's also a hint of Phoebe/Joey in the episode 'TOW Two Parts-Part 2' after Ursula loses interest in Joey and Phoebe has to pick up the pieces.

We witness them turn into the Best Friends that everyone want. We see how six people's lives are kept so alive by each other's presence.

Friends really sucks you into its world and makes you think you are one of them.

1677815,4,B00005YU82,"Our nation's fourth graders were not yet born when we fell for this long-shot six-member cast's story of twenty-somethings who gather regularly in two New York City apartments and seem to own the furniture at the 'Central Perk' coffee house.  Do you remember where you were when you first found out about Rachel, Har-Monica, Phebes, Joey, Chandler, and Ross?

Of course you do.

By the time this first season drew its final breath, we knew that Joey's acting career was hopeless, that Phoebe was a complete but endearing flake, that Monica's neuroses were eminently promising, and that Ross and Rachel would inevitably become a serious item - romantically and theatrically - in seasons to come.  We also knew we'd be there to witness it all.  There were six other evenings of the week for the rest of life.

In retrospect, the story line seems inevitable.  So it's breathtaking to realize that the series' writers were making it up as they went along, and that when an entire episode is filmed in Monica and Rachel's apartment, it signals the time of the season when budget problems in the early years hacked this aspiring program down to its core.  This is the inside look available to Friends-aholics on the DVDs of this first season and those that follow.",1123286400,,1258,4.791666666666667

1677818,5,B00005YU82,"If you have never seen this wonderful TV series before, what better way to start watching it than with season 1? It all starts out in the pilot where Rachel leaves her groom at the alter after deciding that she is more attracted to a gravy boat and goes to a cofee shop called Central Perk where she hopes to find her childhood friend Monica. Also her only friend who was NOT invited to her wedding!

 Monica invites Rachel to stay with her at her apartment for awhile and introduces her to her friends Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Rachel sees Monicas older brother Ross for the first time after highschool.

 Rachel breaks off her engagement to Barry and stays with Monica and that is the story that brings the FRIENDS together.

  In season 1 Ross gets his divorce to his lesbian wife carol, finalized but Carol tells Ross that she is pregnant with his baby. Rachel gets her first job ever, Monica is a aspiring chef,

Joey is trying his hand at acting, Phoebe is well Phoebe and Chandler is getting better and better at his job as a data processor.

  In the end of season 1 Ross has a son and Rachel finds out that Ross is in love with her at her birthday when she recieves a antique pendant that Ross got her. She is in love with him also so goes to meet him at the airport when he arrives back from China but only to be met by Ross and a woman named Julie who Ross met up with on his trip and is now dating her.

  This is the season that started it all people! There is no season like this one and it gives you the love for FRIENDS. Its a GREAT series! its funny and sad at some points, its a feel good, lovable show and the cast is excellent! The only one that was somewhat recognized at first was Courtney Cox but Friends made Jennifer Aniston, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer the great succes that they are today!

David Schwimmer and Matt LeBlanc are fantastic in the first season, and Jennifer Anniston proved early on what a great comedic actress she was. Season 1 is packed with classic comedy moments, and its a must-have for anyone's DVD collection. If you don't have it already, but it now and relive some great episodes and remember just how great TV shows can be when those writers are smart.

1677840,4,B00005YU82,"I remember a little over ten years ago stumbling across the pilot episode of ""Friends"" (I think I was waiting for ""Seinfeld"" to start) and thinking to myself, ""I hope this show stays on the air.""  Watching the first season from start to finish again years later quickly reminded me why I felt so strongly back when I saw it the first time.  There aren't too many shows that combined such likeable characters, a true-to-life group dynamic and chemistry, and, of course, humor quite like ""Friends.""  It's the only show I've ever watched that made me feel as though I knew and was friends with the people on the show.  After a brief feeling-out in the first few episodes, the show hit a tremendous stride midway through Season 1 and kept going strong through the fourth and fifth seasons.  But that's a different story.

Season 1 gets 4 stars instead of 5 from me only b/c it took a few episodes for the characters and personalities to settle in.  Not that there's much wrong with the beginning episodes - they're funny and enjoyable - but the characters are very raw, and you could see some tweaks were made mid-season to most of the roles and storylines.  I thought Monica, Phoebe and Joey were touched up the most, as they began the show as basically much more exaggerated depictions of the characters we would eventually come to know and love.  And in regard to storylines, it seems the original idea was to incorporate sex into every episode in some way and have Ross bring up the ""I married a lesbian"" angle every time he could.  Again, not that there's anything wrong with the sex topic, but thankfully, Ross's whining on the lesbian marriage topic was eventually scaled back a bit.

The best things about Season 1 are the laughs, generated mostly by Chandler, a standout as the incredibly funny, quick-witted sarcasm machine, and the genius of the creators to be smart enough to build on the Ross-Rachel romance right from Episode 1.  There must have been a great deal of patience and confidence on the part of the creators to slowly build on Ross's feelings for Rachel over the course of an entire season, and not allowing the payoff to come until the next season.  Had they rushed into slapping together a few episodes that built the relationship from start to finish just to get it done, the payoff wouldn't have been nearly as great.  Instead the creators, Schwimmer and Aniston managed to perfectly engage the audience in Ross's emotions to the point where it was hard for viewers not to be completely invested emotionally in his yearning for her, and especially in what took place in the final episode.  There were a couple of points throughout the season where it looked like Ross and Rachel were finally going to happen, but it carried over to Season 2, which, as a result, would become far and away Friends most memorable season (to me, anyway).

Pick up Season 1 - it stands out on its own, and it sets the table for the next few great seasons.",1118275200,,2959,4.607619047619048
1677841,5,B00005YU82,"Once you buy the first season, your going to have to buy the rest.  Each season leaves you wanting more. The suspence that they leave at the end of the first season....Rachel finds out about Ross' feelings, as he comes home from a trip in China with another woman.  This show is so funny and some episodes leave you guessing what will happen next.  This is definetely a must have series.",1117497600,,387,4.422535211267606
1677842,4,B00005YU82,"Friends is a feel-good type show with a little bit of an edge - perhaps the closest analogies are Three's Company and I Love Lucy.  The show knows it too - it shamelessly rips off the ""misunderstandings piling on top of each other"" formula in more than one episode.  It does have a significant difference, though - Three's Company and Lucy were little more than vehicles for John Ritter and Lucille Ball.  Friends is truly an ensemble show - not even Cheers or M*A*S*H could reach the finely balanced and unselfish group dynamic of Friends.

For those that don't know, it's the story of 6 25-ish friends (35 by the end of the series) that live in N.Y.  In this first season, only Chandler and Ross have anything approaching real jobs.  That leaves them with lots of time to sit around the coffee shop, date, and otherwise kill time.  Not only are the 6 main characters distinct and likeable (if unrealistically good-looking), the extended universe is rapidly filled out with Chandler's mom (Morgan Fairchild), Monica and Ross's parents (Elliot Gould still steals every scene he's in), Rachel's ex-fiance, Phoebe's physicist boyfriend (Hank Azaria), etc.  A half hour with Friends is really a lot like coming back to a comforatble group of your own old friends (or, at least, like lounging in sweat pants and T-shirts).

The show is not perfect - as mentioned above, these people are too good looking to be real, their apartments are too nice to be affordable.  Some shows are no more than rehashed Three's Company or Cheers episodes.  There are a few too many cutsy gimmicks in this first season - the stupid monkey that infests the middle of the season, the fact that Ross married a lesbian, Phoebe's ditsy new-age aura cleasing, the way the Ross-Rachel dynamic drags on and on (and on and on).  But the characters are so sharply defined, and the actors so likeable in the roles, that you forgive such gaffs and enjoy the shows anyways.  Besides, where else will you find John Lovetz as a stoned restauranteur?

This DVD edition looks and sounds great (as it should).  Obviously, it's great to be able to watch these shows commercial-free.  There are even a few cut scenes added to the pilot that were never aired.  But there's really very little on the DVD other than the shows.  It's a far cry from the packed DVD's of the Simpsons.  But then, 24 episodes for a measly $25 dollars is still a pretty good deal.",1116115200,,2412,4.672985781990521
1677843,5,B00005YU82,"Along with Seinfeld and Frasier, Friends dominated the must-see TV of the 1990's. Winner of innumerable television awards, the show features the lives of six friends in their late-twenties/early-thirties living in New York City - Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc), and Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry). The six friends spend the majority of their time in a coffee house named ""Central Perk"" or in either Monica's apartment or Joey and Chandler's apartment.

The Friends (Season 1) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including season premiere in which Rachel leaves her fiance Barry at the altar and moves in with Monica. Without her daddy's credit cards to live off of, Rachel is forced to get a job at the Central Perk coffee house. As the season progresses, we learn that Ross has harbored a life-long crush on Rachel, but he is continually unable to tell her because of a number of obstacles that get in his way.

1677844,5,B00005YU82,"In September of 1994, NBC had brought us a brand new show entitled, ""Friends"". This show was absolutely amazing in every way. All of us had tuned in to NBC every Thursday night at 8:00 pm to watch each new episode as the show progressed. We had become the best of friends with the six lovable characters that are major parts of the show. The caslist is as follows:

Jennifer Aniston as RACHEL GREEN
Courteney Cox Arquette as MONICA GELLAR
Lisa Kudrow as PHOEBE BUFFAY
Matt LeBlanc as JOEY TRIBBIANI
Matthew Perry as CHANDLER BING
David Schwimmer as ROSS GELLAR

In the pilot episode, Rachel comes running into the gang's coffeehouse, which is called, ""Central Perk"", dressed in a wedding gown. Rachel was supposed to be marrying her fianc, Barry, but she ran out on him, for she did not love him. Rachel was a spoiled, rich girl, who never worked a day in her life. But the others help Rachel become independent. Rachel then pulls herself the rest of the way and lands herself a job as a waitress at the coffeehouse.

Monica and Rachel were best friends all through high school. After running out on Barry, Rachel decided to move in with Monica. Monica is a chef, who is beautiful and very sweet. But don't let the sweetness fool you. Monica is very competitive, with a vicious competing attitude. Monica is also so freaked out about keeping her apartment spotless and having all of her furniture set up to a certain way.

Phoebe had a hard life when she was 14 years old. She lived on the streets after her mother had killed herself, after her father abandoned her completely. Phoebe used to live with Monica, but she moved out because of Monica's neat-freak personality. She now lives with her grandmother in her grandmother's apartment and works as a masseuse, and also performs badly written and composed folk songs, although, her song, ""Smelly Cat"", is a favorite amongst her friends and fans. Phoebe also has a twin sister named Ursula.

Joey is a sex-attic womanizer, who is less educated than we all thought. But Joey has a sweet personality. He may be more stupid than anybody on the planet, but Joey is a big teddy bear. He is very sweet and is willing to help out his friends whenever they need. Joey is a struggling actor, who desperately tries to grab the best roles, but never seems to get them. He has appeared in numerous plays, such as a musical version of Sigmund Freud.

Chandler, whose job is still anonymous, lives across the hall from Monica and Rachel. Joey is Chandler's roommate. Chandler has dated women, but is unhappy with the fact that women find him unattractive. Chandler has an on and off-again relationship with a woman named Janice, whose voice and personality is enough to make the friends want to kill themselves. Chandler is also embarrassed by his parents. His parents sort of screwed him up a bit when they divorced while he was so young. What makes him embarrassed with his parents is this: his mother, Nora Bing, is an Erotic-Romance novelist. His father, Charles Bing, is a gay drag queen, who hosts his own live show in Vegas entitled, Viva Las Gaygas, where his stage name is, Helena Handbasket.

Ross, who is Monica's older brother, works as a Paleontologist. Ross has just gotten a divorce. He had been married to a woman named Carol Willick for four years. The divorce was filed, for Ross found out that Carol turned out to be a lesbian. She has been dating her best friend, Susan Bunch. But Carol is pregnant with Ross' child. Carol gives birth to her and Ross' son, who they named Ben. Both share custody of the child. Ross has had a crush on Rachel, ever since his Freshman year of high school. During the course of the first season, Ross' crush for Rachel develops into true feelings of love. In the last episode of the season, Ross heads off to China, but is upset about it when he cannot be around for Rachel's birthday. He was even planning to tell her that his crush has turned into a real love for her. Chandler blabs it to Rachel. Rachel thinks about it and it causes her to finally feel the same way about Ross. She goes to the airport to pick him up, two weeks later, but is heartbroken to find him with another woman.

There is much more fun within the episodes of this first season of Friends.

1677878,5,B00005YU82,"I want to start off by saying that I am a huge Friends fan...that is, I am a huge EARLY Friends fan. My adoration for the show cuts off around mid-season 5 or whenever Monica and Chandler became somewhat of a pathetic item. I guess you could call me half a fan since the show lasted for a decade. In my opinion, it should have ended a few years sooner, but NBC had to squeeze the last living drops out of its last ""Must-See-TV"" sitcom.

The past four seasons have been excruciating for me and you wanna know why? Okay, so you don't, but I'll tell you anyway. The actors on Friends are (or maybe were) incredible comedians in their own right, but as the seasons dragged on, they turned into caricatures of their former selves. For instance, Monica became more and more neurotic and crazy, Joey became more of a doofus whose only concerns were food and hot chicks, Phoebe lost all her quirky charm and just became a joke, Ross got anger issues and basically lost his mind, Rachel was acting like a 16 year-old, awkward, hyper (and gangly, with her Pilates physique) girl, and Chandler... poor Chandler turned into a wimp who couldn't even pull off the few ""Chandlerisms"" he was given.

Also, if that's not enough, the show just became a ridiculous fashion show. With Rachel and Monica (sometimes Phoebe, but let's face it, she always got the short end of the stick) sporting the hottest new clothes from the latest designers, the show became less about comedy and more about Da-Nang, Juicy, and Neiman Marcus. I realize that with popularity comes bigger salaries, endorsements, sponsorships, etc., but if you look back to these early seasons, it really makes you yearn for a less couture Rachel. I find myself just longing for the famous ""The Rachel"" haircut to come back as the show's biggest fashion statement.

And I have one more point to make before I actually say something good about the show I supposedly love so much. It seemed to me that the Friends actors weren't putting as much into the show in the later seasons. They often seemed to give off the impression that they were doing the network and the fans a favor by continuing the show, like it was enough that they even showed up. You know, that ""So what more do you want?"" attitude. I would've been just as pleased if they had called it quits back before they became the ""million dollar"" men, so to speak. They felt entitled to it, being ""Friends"", but they didn't deserve it as actors. The Friends in the first four seasons did, though.

But hey, draw your own conclusions. Maybe I'm just bitter over Chandler losing the essence of what IS Chandler Bing. That could very well be it. But with classic episodes like ""The One With the Prom Video"" (season 2), ""The One Where No One's Ready"" (season 3), ""The One With All the Embryos"" (season 4), and ""The One With the Blackout"" from season one, how can you not agree with me? The ones I mentioned may not be everyone's favorites, but they are some of the most unforgettable ones. How many episodes are that memorable from the latter seasons? Not many.

Enjoy the first season, then move on to savor the second, make a trip to love the third, and treasure the fourth. Because after that, folks, it could not BE any worse.",1098230400,4,3230,4.542955326460481

Nope.

I'm such a die-hard fan of the Milkman's Son that I had to have ""Friends"" on DVD because of the ""Roxanne"" and ""Canary in a Coalmine"" riffs they sometimes used for scene transitions. Yes, they're technically Police songs, but we all know that Sting was the real force behind that band.

1677881,5,B00005YU82,"Millions of fans can't be wrong. And through the past 10 years, Friends have indeed become just that - friends. Ifyou are one of many who simply love the jokes, the characters, the plots and the outcomes, you will probably want to add this series to your all-time archive.

And where else to start but at the beginning. You get the whole season for a couple of bucks more than any regular movie DVD and for me that is a bargain. Since you know, it's not just a DVD, it's a trip back in time, when we first met Friends. And you'll love it, specially with the deleted scenes, now carefully inserted in the episodes. Can you spot them all?

The extra features make this collection perfect: find out more about the pilot with added commentaries, check all the guest stars or listen to the soundtrack. It's all there and you know it's one of those DVDs, you can keep watching over and over.

The 4-disc set of the First Season is the best place to start your full collection. With the days of bad hair-dos, funny outfits and probably the best humour. If you're a fan, you won't wanna miss this!",1094428800,,1089,4.381188118811881

Sure, I caught a scene here and there while channel surfing, but I never saw an entire episode.  I was put off by its trendiness and wide popularity and rather annoyed by Lisa Kudrow's performance as Phoebe (I still think she's the weak link in the cast).  However, I finally decided to see what all the commotion was about and watched the entire first season.  I'm hooked!  The scripts are witty, the six main characters have distinct personalities, and the secondary characters and story arcs are well developed.

It is true, that we can buy all FRIENDS season boxes months before they are released for you in the USA.
But believe me, you should really stick to your releases.
And that is not only because of the region codes!
The UK releases are way more expensive (starting from 50  and more!) and the British releases don't provide any Special features and the other European boxes (e.g. Germany) neither!!! (There is only the music video of The Rembrandts and in one of the later seasons a really insubstantial ""behind the scenes"" featurette about the London episodes.)

Re-runs of ""Friends"" is on seven times a week (at least once a day), and, new episodes every Thursday night.  Can't people wait a few hours, or even a day to watch ""Friends""?  The network has been teasing me with rumors of the last season for years.  I am praying they really mean it this year.
""Friends"" is proof that American culture is circling the drain and going straight down the sewer pipe.  The sitcom is basically a celebration of stupidity.  People equate cuteness with stupidity.  In reality, stupidity can be a very dangerous thing.  Imagine a ""Friends"" episode where Joey runs over a retarded child because he was paying attention to a cute girl while driving.  Not so cute then?  That is the reality of stupidity.
All sitcoms were created for advertising purposes and are made to soften people's minds.  Once the sitcom disables your logical defense mechanisms, the sponsors come in to sell you expensive things you don't need.

1677936,5,B00005YU82,"When the pilot first aired, I was in kindergarten. Though at the time I wasn't old enough to stay awake past the time it aired, I remember my mom always raving about Friends.
I have since caught most of the episodes in syndication, on primetime reruns, and via the ""Best Of Friends"" DVDs. I'm thrilled that the entire seasons are, at last, making it to DVD.
What is one of the funniest shows ever, Friends should be a part of anyone's DVD collection. In fact, I'd say that these DVDs are basically worth buying a DVD player. Whether your an old fan embracing the nostalgia provided by the discs, a new fan trying to catch up on old storylines, or someone who until now was unaware the show even existed, you will love these DVDs.
Every Friends episode is utterly perfect. When you watch the Pilot and then watch an episode from the current (and final) season, you will see what I mean. The characters are already there in the very first episode. It's as if these actors were walking along, waiting to find Ross, Monica, Chandler, Rachael, Phoebe, and Joey. The characters never develope because they were just there in the beginning. How many other shows can you say that about?",1074816000,9,1178,4.561320754716981

The girls who were more attractive than average, usually really skinny, and way too chipper. And then the guys. Kinda clunky. No depth at all. Smug.
As you might have guessed, I find it very difficult to watch this show. Far from making me laugh, these characters make me want to leave. And the writing is so flat, so corporate, so uninspired, that it amounts to junk-food humor, with a carefully orchestrated laugh track so numbed viewers know exactly where to laugh.

1677938,5,B00005YU82,"With this 5 words,began an amazing journey.
For those few of you, who don't know, ""Friends"" (are there really people who don't???"") is a hit Tv series that spins over 10 years, and it's already a classic.
Friends is a phenomenon. It tells the story of 6 friends, three men and three women, who live in NYC. They are best friends, and they face everything together, failed marriages, sex problems, career issues and above all friendship. Because as the people of NBC say in the official Friends site: ""When you are young and in the city, your friends are your family!""
It's the most suitable series to watch when you are down, or when you want to laugh, or when you want to cry, or when you have friends come over ,or even when you want to just sit back in your sofa and chill. It's virtually a show to watch at any time, of any day.
The script is one of the best-written ever in the history of TV, and it wouldn't be irrelevant to note here that Friends have been nominated 44 times for several Emmys, and have won 11 times.
The first season is the beginning of this joyfull journey. Rachel (Jeniffer Aniston) walks in Central Perk ( the favorite coffee house of the gang) wearing her wedding dress, to find Monica (Courtney Cox), a childhood friend,her brother Ross (David Schwimmer), who has just split up with his newly-out-of-the-closet lesbian wife and her ex-roomate Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), a semi-crazy 90's hippy. There she also meets Chandler (Matthew Perry), Ross's best friends since high school, and Joey (Matt Le Blanc), Chandler's Casanova-like roomate. And that's the beginning of a relationshiop that has had its ups (and never its downs!! :-) ) and the first step of a big stair called ""Having someone to turn to"".
Buy the whole collection, but especially the 1st season, because after all we can all identify with the lyrics ""when it hasn't been your day, your week, or even your year!""
A  W  S  O  M  E",1073174400,10,1919,4.566860465116279
1677939,4,B00005YU82,"Now that we are getting near the end of all things with the final season of ""Friends,"" it is interesting to go back and start at the beginning and see how we got to where we are from where they started.  The pilot episode (written by Marta Kuffman & David Crane, directed by James Burrows), establishes the character types from the start: Rachel is a spoiled little rich girl cast adrift in the big bad world, Monica is an obsessive neat freak, Phoebe is a New Age flake, Joey is a dim witted lothario actor, Chandler is a non-stop jokester, and Ross is depressed because his wife has left him for another woman.  Although the entry of Rachel, who has just left her orthodontist husband-to-be Barry at the altar to move in with her old high school pal Monica, is what kick starts the show, adding her as the new person (but old friend) into the mix of the Central Perk gang, it is the story arc of Ross, who learns that his ex-wife Carol is pregnant in the first official episode, that defines the first season.  The Ross-Carol-Susan triangle becomes important because it allows the other characters to define themselves in response to the attendant traumas leading to the baby's deliver in the penultimate episode of the season.
The standout performances in the first season of ""Friends"" are Ross and Chandler.  David Schwimmer provides the pathos as Ross looks back on the ruin of his marriage while trying to deal with the impending birth of Ben and the resurgence of his feelings for the totally oblivious Rachel.  One of those would be enough of a train wreck for one season, but Ross gets the double dose.  Matthew Perry is usually considered the one of the sextet who has the worst career prospects (although this was the judgment before his appearances on ""The West Wing""), but he has the hardest task on the cast with the requirement to constantly interject jokes into any and all situations.  Plus, they are almost always funny, even when they are forced.  Lisa Kudrow, of course, is always in the running, because she is really the one of the Friends with the most accessible heart.  Besides, as the one who is the most out there she is the one who gets to speak the great truths, like when she defuses the turmoil over the baby's birth with the observation ""Here's this little baby who has, like, three whole parents who care about it so much they're fighting over who gets to love it the most.""  At this point Courtney Cox and Matt LeBlanc are dealing with characters who are too much one note (she's obsessive and he's dumb) to really break through, and Jennifer Aniston only begins to emerge from the poor little rich girl at the end of the season.
Best episodes of first season: ""The One with George Stephanopoulos,"" or more accurately his pizza, which is delivered to the girl's drunken slumber party; ""The One with Butt,"" where Joey gets his first big movie role as Al Pacino's butt double and sings as the star of the musical ""Freud"" (and Rachel gets her new ""do""); ""The One with the Blackout,"" finds Chandler stuck in an ATM vestibule with a lingerie model; ""The One with the Stoned Guy,"" which is memorable not for Jon Lovitz's guest appearance as the titular character but for Joey teaching Ross how to talk dirty for his date with the curator of insects at the museum; my favorite, ""The One with All the Poker,"" where the girls try to beat the guys at poker and Ross's unrequited feelings for Rachel are the whole subtext; ""The One with the Ick Factor,"" has Monica with dating a minor, Chandler hiring Phoebe as his temporary secretary, Rachel having sex dreams about Chandler, and Ross getting messages for a gay prostitute; and ""The One with the Birth,"" finds Ross and Susan locked in a closet while Carol gives birth.
As is to be expected with the first season of a situation comedy, there are some less than stellar episodes here, such as ""The One with Mrs. Bing"" where Chandler's mom (Morgan Fairchild) hits on Ross, and ""The One with Fake Monica,"" which at least has the virtue of getting rid of Marcel.  I mean, come on: Ross cannot have Carol, he cannot have Rachel, but he can have a monkey?  Maybe the goal was to bring Schwimmer, who had the most impressive resume going into the show, back down to the rest of the cast.  ""Friends: The Complete First Season"" is not a great season, but it does provide a solid foundation.  Besides, situation comedies that have really great first seasons often have trouble figuring where to go next, and as the final shot of the first season shows us, ""Friends"" knew exactly where to go next: i.e., how many times can Ross and Rachel pass like emotional ships in the night before they actually get to bang hulls.",1072396800,7,4680,4.582535885167464

 Thanks to brilliant writing that doesn't talk down to most 20 something at the time(although the creators were mid 30's plus).Another contributing factor were the distinctive characters themselves,Including the wound up,yet nuturing Monica Gellar(Courtney Cox<Arquette>),her brilliant,yet nerdy brother Ross(David Schwimmer),The spoiled,yet endearing Rachel Green(Jennifer Aniston)who becomes Monica's roommate after becoming a runaway bride,The sarcastic,uptight Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry),The dopey,loveable out of work actor Joey Tribbiani(Matt LeBlanc)and the sweet,yet ditzy new age hippie Phoebe Buffay(Lisa Kudrow).

1677943,5,B00005YU82,"Ahhh, where it all started.  The first line of dialogue is ""There's nothing to tell"".  Rachel makes a dramatic entrance into the Friends' lives when she comes into the coffee house as a dripping wet bride.  Ross just discovered his wife was a lesbian and she was planning to move in with her lover.  Joey is just same old Joey, goofy and fun-loving.  Chandler and his wacky stories, at the beginning of the first episode, he was telling the gang he had a dream that he was back in high school, butt-naked and there was a phone 'down there'.  We learn Phoebe had a ex-boyfriend named Carl who ate chalk.  At the end of the first episode, Ross asks Rachel out, but nothing ever came of it.  As the debut season goes on, Rachel tries to quit Central Perk, but fails, Ross tries to get over Carol, but that doesn't work either, Rachel falls for an Italian hottie named Paolo, but he hits on Phoebe, which ends his and Rachel's relationship, Chandler gets stuck in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre, Joey gets a part in a movie as Al Pacino's butt double, Monica falls for a guy 8 years younger than her, Barry (the man Rachel was supposed to marry), comes back in an episode and tells Rachel he still loves her, and Ross many times Ross tries to tell Rachel his true feelings for her, but something always got in the way.

1677994,5,B00005YU82,"Reviewing the programs: I'm not a fan of Friends, but i had watched many episodes in WBTV and they're really fun (even in it's 10th season).
If you don't know who are the friends, they are Ross (David Schwimmer), a noble guy that is in love with Rachel Green (Jeniffer Aniston), she is the stereotiphycal girl that get all that she wants from her dad (until suddendly, decides to scape from her house and live at her own spense); Chandler (Mattew Perry), the insecure and sarchastic guy that is looking the love of his life, Monica (Cortney Cox), that in her childhood was a fat and insecure girl, Phoebee (Lisa Kudrow) that is completely nuts, and Joey, he pretends to be an actor, but with poor results; Somehow we can identify with one of them.
Reviewing the DVD: This DVD collection has all of the 1st season episodes, and they are very funny, the audio and video are good (presented in full screen (this is not a movie, this is a TV program); in the extras section, you find and audio commentary in the pilot episode (sorry, no subtitles in the commentary), some featurettes like ""inside Central Perk"" and a trailer; in the language support, you get english audio track; english, french, spanish and korean subtitles; the episodes are longer than 30 minutes (i guess they indeed have new footage), there are no fades to black (where should be the commercials, maybe ""The Simpsons"" could learn something about this), an the play all option is great (you can forget where you leave your remote control!)
Maybe the only flaw is the price
If you want a good laugh or if you're a Friends fan, you'll love this collection",1041379200,16,1620,4.628472222222222
1677995,5,B00005YU82,"when you read a review you normally are thinking about buying an item and are wonderign what others think of their purchase of it. Well I think that if you are thinking baout getting this or the second full season is a great idea. For me i got into loving friends a bit late, so i'm not the person who has watched evry episode. I got the best of Friends 1-4 and i recomend if you are the same kind of person as me that ypu shoudl not get that first. When ii got it i man i loved it but we all know that a lot of the episodes have clif hangers and which the ""best of friends 1-4"" since i hadn't seen much of it i was sorta frusterated since i couldn't find out what came next. if you are the kinda person that has watched each single episode then i advice you to get the best of friends so you can remember the very best episodes, or you may want the whole season your choice but i think that this is the best choice for someone who wants to know the whole story...it makes more sense that way and you don't get frusterated because you don't know whats next!

The cast featuring Jennifer Aniston (Rachel Green), Courtney Cox (Monica Gellar), Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe Buffay), Matt Le Blanc (Joey Tribbiani), Matthew Perry (Chandler Bing), and David Scwhimmer (Ross Gellar) are all lovable in their on way. Their lovable personalities, the pranks, the tricks, the adventures, the job searches, the weddings, the wishes, and many other events make it the greatest television show in history. If you aren't a 'Friends' fan at the moment, you will be. This now Emmy-award winning series (also winner of many other awards) is the highest rated show this year.

  Every episode is great. If the story isn't gripping enough of you, the humour certainly will be. It deserves more than 5 stars! It's finally been recognized reaching its 9th season. This first complete season is definitely a classic collectible. It's the show that changed the lives of 6 nobody's. Friends is a show that just gets better and better.

I bought it for the supplements, but sadly I wasn't as satisfied as I hope I should be. The only commentary they provide is from the Pilot. I wish they included other popular episodes of the show. Plus the commentary, although recorded separately are combined in a one commentary instead of three different commentaries from the show's executive producer. There is this cool supplement though, where you'll have a tour of the central perk where you can find the history of certain things in the place. I just wish they included more items. There is also a guestbook where you could see the highlights of the guest stars from Season 1 only, it's not really a supplement since you could find those scenes in the actual episodes.

Each episode has additional footage that you don't get to see in the re-runs that run in syndication.

Do you find yourself quoting from Friends in every day conversation?
Do you stress the word ""be"" in conversation? (Ex: Could that coffee BE any stronger.)
Does your email address contain the character name or real name of one of the cast?
Do you know the name of every episode?
Do you know the scripts by heart?
Have you have named your children/pets after the cast or the animals on the show? (ex: my cat is named Chandler!)

1678080,5,B00005YU82,"When Courtney Cox, Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow & Matthew Perry first got together to record the first season of Friends, nobody could have expected that the show would blow up into a huge phenomenon. The ratings went through the roof, and the group racked up countless awards for their amazing performance as the Friends cast. Their talents also spawned successful movie careers, magazine cover stories, award show appearences, two successful soundtracks, and everything else that deals with the entertainment world, because together as a group they have conqured it.
The first season contains so many treasured episodes of the Friends legacy, that no collection is complete without these tapes. Just look at the instant classics that you get on this tape:
The One with Two Parts: In my opinion this is easily the best Friends episode of all time. Rachel injuries her ankle while taking down the Christmas lights, and in order to afford the hospital charges must pretend to be Monica because she has no insurance. Things heat up when Monica & Rachel go out with the doctors that helped Rachel, and it provides one of the funniest scenes in television history.
The One with the East German Laundry Detergent: This is when Ross does laundry with Rachel, whom he still secretly loves at the time. After teaching Aniston how to do laundry, she kisses him, and he reacts hilariously by trying to walk away calmy, but instead walking into and open dryer door.
The One with the Boobies: This is the episode where Chandler walks in on Rachel coming out of the shower. After staring at her breasts on numerous accasions afterwards, Rachel tries to get payback by looking at Chandler in the shower. Instead she walks on Joey, who tries to get her back by walking in on her when it was really Monica, and so Monica tries to get him back by walking in on him, but instead its his father!!
The one with the Fake Monica: This is where Monica gets her credit card stolen by another woman named Monica and when she goes to confront her at tap class lessons, she ends up befriending the girl and spending everyday of a week with her. Unfortunatley for Monica, the woman is eventually caught and incarcerated.
These are just 4 of the best episodes on this tape. You can get to know the Friend's characters for those who haven't been fans since the first season, and fall in love with them just like the rest of America has. Their characters are so easy to relate to and their closeness as friends is one that everyone that watches the show will envy. This is easily the best television series of all time and I personally would recommend it to ANYONE.",1019952000,14,2666,4.710920770877944
1678081,5,B00005YU82,"Thank heavens that they finally have let the first season run loose. You can watch the best of friends over and over, but to be able to sit back and enjoy the whole season is a great thrill!",1019606400,,190,4.026315789473684
1678082,5,B00005YU82,"I am a big fan of ""Friends.""  I don't just watch it on Thursdays; I watch it every night at 7 pm, when my local WB-affiliate airs re-runs.  And to my delight, just a couple of months ago, they got to the end of the last season and went back to the first.  I can't tell you how happy I was!
The reason for my happiness is simple:  The first season is the best. Everything in it seems fresh and new, and it's incredibly fun to watch.  Seeing the characters so early in their development provides a great subtext for all the current episodes -- and the jokes are hilarious.  Therefore, I am *delighted* that they're being released on DVD!
Of course, as a  true fan, I have to note how unfair it was of  Fox to release seasons 1-8 in the UK, but not here in the US.  As a result, I've long been tempted to go to the Amazon UK site and order them all...  but, I won't do so.  Why?  I can't afford a Multi-Region DVD player*.  So, unless you own one of those babies, I just thought I should warn you to stick with the releases as they come out in the US, and enjoy them.
After all, despite Fox's unfairness, the official US release of each ""Friends"" collection is well worth waiting for. :-)  These discs are a MUST-HAVE, no matter what.  Order yours now!

*Explanation: Manufacturers deliberately make DVDs incompatable with players from other regions of the world. This is because sometimes, a DVD in the US hasn't quite made it to overseas theaters.  So, this incompatibility protects their overseas box office sales -- and it means that we here in the States can't play European, Asian, South American, or Japanese discs in our DVD players.  Too bad for us!!!",1019001600,48,1667,4.37785016286645
1678083,5,B00005YU82,"Where do I start? F.R.I.E.N.D.S is absolutely the best comedy show ever! I'm very pleased that they are FINALLY releasing the whole of season 1 on dvd :) True, they did release the""Best Of"" series but those are just a few of the many hilarious episodes of the show. Now with the release of the ""Complete Season"" ones, we can really enjoy the funny day-to-day lives of Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey and Phoebe.
Started in September 1994, Friends have come a long way nearly completing its 8th season this may and the show ending with its 9th and final season. Along with the show's terrific cast, Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Greene, Courteney Cox as Monica Geller, Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay, Matt LeBlanc as Joey Tribbiani, Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing and David Schwimmer as Ross Geller, we have seen their make ups, break ups, friendship and relationships with tons of laughter. The first season however does not deal with much seriousness until the end of the season, which I won't tell you ;). The cast also look completly different then than how they look now, and it's interesting to see how the show first hit off.
The Complete Season 1 dvd edition of F.R.I.E.N.D.S consists of 24 episodes in a 4 dvd disk set, which are :
01-  The One Where Monica Gets A Roommate
02-  The One With The Sonogram At The End
03-  The One With The Thumb
04-  The One With George Stephanopoulos
05-  The One With The East German Laundry Detergent
06-  The One With The Butt
07-  The One With The Blackout
08-  The One Where Nana Dies Twice
09-  The One Where Underdog Gets Away
10-  The One With The Monkey
11-  The One With Mrs. Bing
12-  The One With The Dozen Lasagnas
13-  The One With The Boobies
14-  The One With The Candy Hearts
15-  The One With The Stoned Guy
16-  The One With Two Parts (1)
17-  The One With Two Parts (2)
18-  The One With All The Poker
19-  The One Where The Monkey Gets Away
20-  The One With The Evil Orthodontist
21-  The One With The Fake Monica
22-  The One With The Ick Factor
23-  The One With The Birth
24-  The One Where Rachel Finds Out
Along with this, you get to see Never Before Seen Footage, which alone is worth spending your money for this boxed set! Im sure all the Friends fans out there such as myself are impatiently waiting to get a hold of the dvd, but we cant help ourselves; it is, after all, the best tv show ever! A must have for everyone!",1018828800,69,2392,4.299776286353468
1678084,5,B00005YU82,"After having four best of DVD's released, Friends finally gets a complete season box set treatment.  The show's first season was an instant success, making the six previously unknown actors major celebrities and the toast of television.  The first season upon reflection, holds up extremely well.  From the first episode where we are introduced to the characters via Rachel's aborted wedding, you are immediately comfortable with them.  The first season's main continuing storyline is Ross' infatuation with Rachel and his attempts to tell her how he feels.  The first season ends with Rachel finding out about his feelings while Ross is in China and the cliffhanger of her going to the airport upon his return to tell him she feels the same.  It is interesting to see some of the changes the cast has gone through (hairstyles being just one item) from the first year until now.  Matt LeBlanc's Joey is now the lovable dope, but in the first year his dopiness is not played up as much.  David Schwimmer's Ross plays for more Chevy Chase pratfall humor (he trips alot, gets knocked down repeatedly and even gets his nose broken by a hockey puck at a Rangers game).  Lisa Kudrow's Phoebe is the character that has grown the most.  Courtney Cox was the best known of the Friends and her  Monica acts as the emotional center of the first season while Matthew Perry's Chandler is as acerbic and cynical as ever.  Jennifer Aniston is superb as Rachel and she shows some great comedic timing.  In the first year, she is a definite supporting player, but her extremely quirky personality provides many of the first seasons funniest lines.  Friends is experiencing a rebirth of popularity in now its eighth seasons and is great fun and highly entertaining to see how it all began.",1018224000,,1771,4.801980198019802
1678104,5,B00005YU82,"Seinfeld, started it, and Friends defined it.  The idea of urban family did not start with ""Bridget Jones Diary"" it started with ""Friends"".  ""Friends"" is such a popular show because it defines society today and it revived itself this year because our world needed some old friends to lean on.  If you have not seen ""Friends"", just buy it because you will just keep watching it over and over and over..............",1017792000,,413,4.788732394366197
1678105,5,B00005YU82,"...To realize that they needed to release ""complete seasons of"" box set DVDs here in the US too, and not just in the UK! Finally all US resident ""Friends"" fans are getting what they want and what they need. If you've been keeping track of all the ""Friends"" episodes since season 1, then you should have some sort of a clue on what will be included in this box set: every single episode of season 1, and I am sure there will be some great special bonus features added to it. It's kind of unfair that the UK already has the complete seasons box sets up to season eight...and they haven't even released season one here in the United States! So if you really cannot wait, then you can probably order every single complete season of ""Friends"" on the UK version of Amazon.com. ""Friends"" is the best comedy show on TV! It's been the best since it first aired and still rules! It's a clever show, about six friends living in New York City and dealing with the everyday problems of life. Joey and Rachel are my favorite characters--and I'd think they'd make a great couple!... I just love ""Friends"" and I can't get enough of it. My favorite episode from the first season is ""The One With The Ick Factor"", where Monica dates a guy who thinks he's a senior in college but, while they are ""doing it"", he confesses that he's actually a senior in high school! I also love the very first episode, of course, as does most fans of ""Friends"" do. For all ""Friends"" fans, of course I'd recommend this! It's better than THE BEST OF FRIENDS collection because even though they only show episodes from season one, it's every single episode and not just the most popular ones polled by ""Friends"" fans...",1017360000,20,1679,4.472312703583062
1678106,5,B00005YU82,"This one is definitely better than the ""Best of Friends"" Collection.  Instead of watching bits and pieces without getting a total idea of why the scenes are funny, you now get to watch the full episodes without interruption.
I got to say, this is one of the funniest TV series I have ever seen, and I can wait to get a hold of all the episodes. GET IT NOW!",1016841600,,356,4.159420289855072

But for those who can't wait, ""Friends"" has been out on DVD in Europe for quite some time.  If you have a multi-region DVD player, you can order via the other [Amazon.com] web sites.  [Amazon.uk] has all series 1-7, and two volumes from series 8 are due in March.  [Amazon.fr] has all seasons from 4-7.  The DVD boxes are in French but the DVD menus etc. are all English.  It's very easy to order, as it is the same familiar [Amazon.com] interface.  I've ordered from both [Amazon.uk] and [Amazon.fr], and the delivery is very eliable.

1678110,5,B00005YU82,"Being in the UK we are fortunate enough to have had the complete series for a while, but with the extras on this it's worth doubling up. The Best Of's were ok but obviously they didn't match everybody's favourites episodes. That's why the boxed sets with the extra footage are an absolute must. This is an opportunity for all Friends fans to take a trip down memory lane to remember how it all began and a chance for all non-Friends fans to see exactly what they have been missing all these years. I only hope there's not too much of a delay in bringing all the other series out.",1013558400,,579,4.321100917431193

In fact, the only reason I purchased my multi region DVD player was to purchase the Friends DVD sets.  Its about time AOL Time Warner gave their home town fans equal treatment.
