8454057,3,B0052N8NAY,"This set claims to contain the ""most well-known and well-regarded"" films of Jess' career, but not true; missing is ""Vampyros Lesbos,"" considered by many to be his most accessible film.  Also absent is ""Eugenie De Sade,"" with Soledad Miranda, one of his greatest and rarest titles.  Instead we get some lesser works from the master, such as ""Ilsa: Wicked Warden,"" and ""Inconfessable Orgies of Emanuelle,"" and ""Sexual Story of O.""  Any true Jess fanatic knows that these are hardly among his best works.  And where is ""Venus In Furs"" and ""She Killed In Ecstasy?""  Now these titles are among his ""best."" I will say that the best title of this set is ""Love Letters of A Portuguese Nun,"" a rare title and one of his absolute best. But there is not indication whether this is the super rare uncut Euro version. A mixed bag, probably not worth the asking price..",1351900800,5,855,4.673333333333333
