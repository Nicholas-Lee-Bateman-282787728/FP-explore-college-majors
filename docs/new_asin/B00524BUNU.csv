8453519,5,B00524BUNU,"I actually owned the Blu-Ray version of this buying at a bookstore in 2011 but for me, I have a hard time getting used to Blu-Ray's functions also, I'm used to DVD functions, anyways, I'm still learning all the names of their videos though, I saw many of them on Youtube in early 2011 but wanted a collection of their videos (i'm  still a new fan) I love the most of the music videos in the first two discs but disc-3 in my opinion is a bit slow but that's just me another thing I didn't like was the menu screen where you choose 'PLAY ALL or select a certain video all the texts are a bit hard and difficult to see or read (texts in Japanese also, a few smattering of English but hard to red) While there's no bonus features which I don't mind, if You choose 'PLAY aLL' you'll see the girls talk about each videos and introduces them etc. While not all their videos aren't on the discs (some came out later after it's release) but all in all, I'm happy since I'm a fan and it's a definite must for any AKB48 fans new or current  also a notable note, one of their videos which I heard was heavily edited was 'Beginner', here you get the un-cut 'Director's Cut 'version which is pretty gory compare to their other videos among others which is a bonus instead of a edited version again that's what I think. Again, I have to say I enjoyed it and glad it's in my collection and I know I haven't listed what's on there it's a bit hard to read  what's-what but that's a minor compliant for me but it's definite buy (if you can afford it) for fans of AKB48 .",1366848000,3,1551,4.146179401993355
