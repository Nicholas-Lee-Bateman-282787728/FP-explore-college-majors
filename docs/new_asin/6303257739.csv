616302,5,6303257739,"Far from the humorless exercise in torture you may have been led to expect, this movie is a tour-de-force of rapier wit and twisted hysteria. A potent cross between comedy and psychological horror with a twist of  sarcasm thrown in for good measure, this movie is a monument to the comic  genius that was the Akroyd & Belushi team. No serious comedy collection  is complete without this  masterpiece.",917136000,7,400,4.838235294117647

616384,5,6303257739,"From the moment I finished watching 1981's NEIGHBORS and left the screening room, I immediately wanted to take the DVD downstairs and watch it in the dark by myself--that is, I instantly wanted to watch it again! There is something very quirky and unidentifiable about this movie. Since you probably have come to this film based upon the star power of its two (or, for my money, three--Cathy Moriarty is a sexy-as-hell icy blonde fox who commands my attention every time that she's on screen) leads, and if indeed you have you might want to know in advance that this isn't your average ""funny"" comedy in the fashion of ""The Blues Brothers"" or ""Doctor Detroit."" Of course, Dan Aykroyd has always been a notably oddball figure who has appeared in a lot of, er, offbeat productions over the years, but in NEIGHBORS he takes his sense of the outlandish to the next level. Despite all of the chaos and harassment that was (allegedly) going on behind the scenes during the film's production, NEIGHBORS emerges as a kind of unorthodox masterpiece about modern paranoia and modern day hysteria. It's not really so much funny as it is psychologically engrossing, but because of the comic nature of the two leads (both of whom ""switched roles"" in midstream, allegedly, and wound up creating even more unique characterizations as a result) and because of Avildsen's haphazard direction the picture emerges as one of the most unique comedies of the 1980s. And herein lies a rather sad commentary upon the state of American film--it was around this time that the makers of comedies started to lose confidence in themselves and decided that it wasn't okay to experiment with scenes that weren't utterly ribald (or, in today's case, grotesquely offensive) in comedy film stories, thus sacrificing the genuine ""human"" comedy films for ones that were increasingly unrealistic and offered little human qualities whatsoever. Even Saturday Night Live, when it first began, was much more of a satirical show more so than an overt comedy program, and as a result the earlier sketches were much edgier (and much funnier) than they are today (not that I watch SNL anymore, but you get the idea). NEIGHBORS is neither knee-slappingly funny nor is it always all that serious, and therefore you will be as unbalanced as the filmmakers and the actors themselves were when you watch it...but it is by way of this truly unbalanced view that a very entertaining commentary upon the nature of human relations in the 20th century emerges. As the familiar phrase goes, ""they just don't make 'em like this anymore.""
Mill Creek's DVD transfer is moderate but the picture looks about as good as I remember it looking years and years ago. There are no extras included (a real shame, considering how much fun that a cast audio commentary track would have been!), but the package (including the cover art on the insert sleeve) has some TLC about it, and it was enough to sell the DVD to me, at least. Now that I have seen this film, I am wary of reading the Thomas Berger source novel, as I fear that Aykroyd's and Belushi's characterizations will color the way I interpret the characters on the page, as a novel, of course, is a much different affair than a film production. However, Berger himself (the author of LITTLE BIG MAN) wrote several interesting novels over the years, and more of them could have been turned into equally interesting movies perhaps, had producers had the vision to pull off cinema stories as bizarre and engrossing as NEIGHBORS. Enjoy! A+
(Oh, and NEIGHBORS is rated ""R"" by the MPAA, but there are no scenes of nudity or sex in the film, and the language--while occasionally strong--is hardly the stuff of a hard ""R"" rated picture.)",1514246400,,3720,4.823161189358372

616427,1,6303257739,"a very underated comedy by John Belushi & Dan akyroyd NEIGHBORS
it was John Belushi's last film before he died of cocaine overdose
first released on dvd over 15 years ago by sony columbia, with no extras at all
well the dvd is now out print
so sony pictures Choice collection has reissued the film on blu-ray now
but again tragically no new extras not even the original trailer for film & the HD transfer is only Good, not excellent
what sony should've done is get a new interview with Dan Akyroyd, Cathy moriarty & Director John G Avildsen
but of course they didn't bother, pretty tragic this old film going to waste without a respectable blu-ray reissue
amazon is selling this for $21 big ripoff for a crap release, this blu-ray is only worth under $5

616481,4,6303257739,"This is an old movie--so old that John Belushi has a lead role. It's a comedy and is rated R. Nowadays it might not warrant more than a PG-13. There's little in the way of violence (a punch or two, and a few shots fired which don't hit anyone), minor swearing, and no nudity to the extent that you would see on any beach in America in the summertime. However, sexual situations are implied.

The interesting thing about it is that Belushi is the ""straight guy"" in this story, while all his favorite roles are ones in which he's the crazy guy. Belushi and his wife are a conventional boring (and bored) couple at the end of a cul de sac. The house next to them has been vacant, but unexpectedly another couple moves in next door. This couple (Akroyd and his wife) are the crazy ones, and immediately Belushi and wife are sucked into a vortex of craziness.

Two minor characters contribute more than their share of the comedy, as the world's most ornery tow-truck operator and his son.
The ending is the weakest link here. It's a decent comedy that does not demand any deep thinking.",1490140800,3,1081,4.454545454545454

Belushi plays your basic middle-aged, middle-class white guy whose life is forever changed by the new neighbors, Vic and Ramona, played by Dan Aykroyd and Cathy Moriarty, and his own wife and daughter.  And let's not forget the crusty garage owner and his enormous, menacing son.  Critics and the population in general hated it when released.  Maybe they were expecting Belushi's role to be as it was in ""Animal House"", but he plays the straight man here,  And very well too: his facial expressions and posture as his Friday evening devolves into chaos, much his own making, are classic.

You do need to have a little bit of a warped sense of humor to fully enjoy the film. It's not for everyone that's for sure. But for those who like obscure comedies this is right up your alley. A bored husband living a mundane life's world completely changes over a 24 hour period after his new eccentric neighbors move in next door.

What follows is zany, quirky, laugh out loud situations that keep you wondering just how far the new neighbors will go  as far as driving John Belushi's character insane! Highly recommended.",1437523200,2,803,4.5625

617154,4,6303257739,"Neighbors is still a wonderful black comedy being one of the 1st ""neighbors from hell"" movie in the modern age. The chemistry between Aykroyd and Belushi still holds up some 30 years later as well as the entire film. It's mind boggling why this film has never been released on DVD until now. What could possible have held up a film that saw release on Beta, VHS and Laserdisc for 17 years on DVD? And add to the fact that it probably should have been released on Blu at this point. Whatever the reason I'm glad to have this back in my library after all these years.
What I always loved about this film is the way it sucks you into its crazy world of bizarre behavior that treads on insanity with a pinch of surrealism. Even though there are no supernatural forces at work, at times you think that Belushi's character has entered the Twilight Zone.
The DVD picture quality is good with no complaints there but there are no extras. It would have been cool to get a commentary with Aykroyd on the making, but on the other hand the DVD was only $6.99 at the time I bought it so I guess any extras would have jacked up the price. One thing for sure, this comedy from the short lived team of Aykroyd/Belushi is one to see and have in a collection.",1433462400,7,1241,4.285106382978723

617242,4,6303257739,"The critics didn't like it, unsuspecting fans scratched their heads and it was a truly strange and bizarre movie.  I enjoyed it and my neighbors looked at me like I was mad.  With John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd switching roles just prior to making the movie, a movie in which the actors fought constantly with the director and the writer, it just seemed to come together in a weird and crazy dark comedy.  And it did make money so it was more than just me that watched it.  Belushi tried his hand at a straight role earlier in Continental Divide and handled the straight man fine.  If you could call it a straight man as a man totally on edge and paranoid with everyone around him seemly in on the joke that he did not understand.  Aykroyd was bouncing off the walls with the totally insane Vic, completely over the top and loving it.  Cathy Moriarty was steamy as Romona, Vic's wife(?).  The storyline had boring straight laced Earl Keese living a dull life with his wife in a quiet little two home cul-de-sac when new neighbors move in one night and Earl's life is completely turned upside down.  If you like strange, dark comedies and are looking for something different you might want to give this a shot.  Not for everyone, but an interesting film to see.",1429660800,,1258,4.478070175438597

617247,5,6303257739,"Kudos to Mill Creek Entertainment for releasing this hard to find title on DVD! Neighbors, John Belushi's last film, is a movie I've been searching for on DVD but never had any luck in finding on any store shelves...until now. Mill Creek, who now have licenscing rights to many titles from Columbia Pictures, have released it in 16X9 wide screen format and it's an excellent print, too. Unfortunately, there aren't any extras. Certainly the theatrical trailer would have been a nice addition. Still, this is nice to have in your collection. Neighbors was only previously available as a made on demand DVD-R and expensive to buy.
I won't get into any of the plot specifics here, others have done a pretty good job in describing the film. I will say that most of the critics panned this movie when it first played in theaters. I don't agree with them at all, I've always liked this dark comedy. Surprisingly, I remembered a lot of the jokes and plot points, even though it's been decades since I last saw the movie. I guess It made a favorable impression on me. The cast all turn in excellent performances, especially Tim Kazurinsky who has a few hilarious scene stealing moments. Neighbor's follows a slightly different comic formula, Belushi is the mild mannered quiet one, and Aykroyd is the wild man!
No, it's not quite the Blues Brothers or Animal House, but I think fans of SNL will enjoy it. Neighbors succeeds on it's own merits as an oddball dark comedy with plenty of bizarre storyline twists. It's also the last teaming of Aykroyd and Belushi in a film together. Recommended.",1427587200,3,1584,4.742753623188406

NEIGHBORS: Funny as heck and 100 percent unpredictable, this celebration of rampant insanity is basically one big cartoon, complete with the goofiest incidental music ever--a cartoon soundtrack featuring an eerie theramin, a moaning trombone, and minor variations on the ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Looney Tunes"" themes. The action all takes place within about 24 hours--but it's certainly the strangest day in Earl's life; one that subverts everything he ever thought he knew and shatters every illusion of ""normality"" he's ever believed in. The dialog is hilarious; the relationships, as odd as the music; the action, a bad acid trip.

I saw it a few times on cable, and each time I found myself drawn back to it. The older I got, the funnier it became. Now I am a little older than Earl's age in the film, and I get it - you can choose to sit in front of your TV, clicking through the channels, or you can head out with Vic and Romona and have a life.  I agree with one reviewer who said it was a ""baby boomer"" film, so I don't know how it would be received by my daughter's generation, but I have to agree with the basic gist of the movie - the older you get, the more absurd life becomes.

617527,4,6303257739,"An eccentric young couple (Dan Aykroyd and Cathy Moriarity) move in next door to a reserved man (John Belushi) and his wife's (Kathryn Walker) residence. It's evident from the start that these two misfits are out of place in the cul-de-sacs of the suburbs. As the night progresses, things get more and more zany and out of control.

Whether John G. Avildsens cinematic adaptation of Thomas Bergers best-selling novel Neighbors is cinematic gold is still up for debate 33 years later. Some call it an uneven comedic misfire. Others would claim it to be a foreshadowing of the darkly and quirky genius that would become a popular and respectable sub-genre thanks to Tim Burtons rise to fame a few years later.

Although Neighbors has Belushi and Aykroyd successfully switching roles, its still a perfect example of the charisma the two had when they paired up together. Belushi would usually play crazy to Aykroyds straight man. However, the two decided to switch parts at the beginning of production for this film. It gives the movie a unique spin that sets it apart from all the other team ups the two engaged in.

One thing Neighbors does well is suck you into its crazy world. You truly forget its a movie and are taken on a wild ride that unfolds over the period of one Friday night. It gives you that fuzzy buzzy feeling you get when you stay awake all night long after the last day of the work week. The sensation adds to the quirky viewing experience.

Although its rated R, Neighbors would achieve nothing above a PG-13 if released today. Theres quite a bit of profanity and adult content. However, no nudity is found. Its tame by todays rating standards.

Neighbors was only re- released on DVD, which will no doubt make many consumers depressed. Its still nice to be able to get our hands on a copy of the movie after so many years off the grid. There are no special features included. We can only dream about new interviews with Dan Aykroyd, Cathy Moriarity, and Kathryn Walker about the making of the film and working with Belushi.

A new edition of Neighbors is a welcome addition to any film enthusiasts library of 1980s comedy classics. It captures a unique moment in the careers of John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. Even without any bonus material or Behind-the-Scenes featurettes, its still worth picking up thanks to an entertainingly dark romp through suburbia.",1413331200,,2375,4.738498789346247

Update here it is 33 years later, and I actually can't believe a 8 year old would think this movie is at all a comedy, it fact it should have been a Twilight Zone movie, that would at least explain the sheer dumbness.

In the first few minutes the wife goes in the kitchen to cook dinner the new neighbor rings the doorbell like 8 times and the wife doesn't ask who is a the door? and the whole time the newbie sits himself and talking loud but the wife doesn't hear anything?

When the new neighbors move in, this stiff guy feels very threatened by the husband(Dan Aykroyd) and strangely attracted to his blunt tease of a wife(Cathy Moriarty).  The new neighbors completely disrupt Belushi's household and test his sanity.  The movie is hilarious to me but to someone who likes straight-ahead comedies, this one may not be for you.

618122,5,6303257739,"I saw ""Neighbors"" on it's opening day during the holiday season of 1981.  I loved it so much I went to see it a couple more times.  For the most part the critics trashed the film though as I recall Siskel and Ebert liked it.  Leonard Maltin's movie guide assigns the dreaded BOMB rating.  Some thirty years on time has been kind to John Belushi's final film.  Either that or the critics are mindless lemmings who wouldn't know a good movie if it bit them.  This movie led me to Thomas Berger's source novel which was good too but the makers of the film take obvious liberties.  Truth be told when they are true to the book ""Neighbors"" feels a little flat.  It's in the improvisation of Belushi and Dan Aykroyd where the film takes off.  It's interesting how they cast the lead characters.  Belushi was better known as the anarchist and Aykroyd the straight man.  It's an inspiring fluorish making Belushi the repressed suburbanite and Aykroyd the maniacal bohemian.
""Neighbors"" is a terrific bit of dark comedy peppered with inspired verbal and physical wit.  There are so many terrific bits but one particularly stands out.  It involves Aykroyd's Vic inviting Belushi's Earl over for a cup of coffee.  Vic presents him with a filthy cup and Earl's reaction is pricelessly classic.  Also noteworthy is a terrific comic score by Bill Conti, one of my all time favorites.

Neighbors is one of my all-time favorite dark comedies.  It's John Belushi's last film and features a Dan Aykroyd that is absolutely nuts.

For those not in the know, here is the basic story: Earl (Belushi) lives on the end of this cul de sac which appears to be in the middle of nowhere. There are only two homes on the street. Earl lives in one and the other is vacant. There's a swamp in the yard (how cool is that?!) and there are these dangerous-looking power lines running through the back yard emitting bolts of electricity every few minutes.

The movie begins with Earl coming home with his wife from a hard day of work. He's this ultra-conservative guy with a boring evening routine. As he sits in front of his TV to watch the evening news (as his wife prepares dinner in the kitchen) he hears a car door slam shut. Minutes later, the door bell rings (ding, dong). Enter the new neighbors, Vick and Ramona. Get ready for a ride! The next 24 hours gets interesting. Little ol' Earl has his life turned totally upside down by these crazy, crazy new neighbors. I mean, these neighbors don't even sleep!

It's nice that Amazon has it for download (which I purchased), but this is a film that I would take to a friend's house to enjoy together. Need a DVD for that, not a download to my PC or IPhone. It's been 10 years since the first review and demand for a DVD here on Amazon. This cult classic certainly warrants a DVD more than some third- and fourth-rate movies.

While I'm writing this, I want to mention the comedic, over-the-top performance given by the person that plays Belushi's daughter, Lauren-Marie Taylor. Why does Amazon not have her listed in the cast? She is not in the opening credits of the film, but rather, the closing, where after the film ends, the black screen comes with ""Introducing (or featuring - I forgot which) Lauren-Marie Taylor"".

618255,5,6303257739,"I don't know what it is, but I see this in music and movies too:  those things you instantly love are the ones that you tire of more quickly.  The ones that grow on you over time are the ones you love for years and years.  Well, Neighbors is one movie that just has to grow on you.  This is a black comedy with lots of dark humor, so some scenes you're not sure whether to laugh or cringe on first viewing, and the subtlety of the excellent score also doesn't necessarily grab the viewer on the 1st pass.

The first time I saw this movie, I just found it ODD.  However, upon a 2nd viewing, I found more and more of the entire film very funny and by the third I was laughing at pretty much every scene wondering how I hadn't found it more appealing the first time I saw it.

As the many other reviews state, this is Belushi playing a ""straight"" and ultimately bored suburbanite until ""Vic"" (Dan Aykroyd) -- a crazed lunatic with an apparent sadistic streak and overly seductive ""wife"" (played fantastically by Cathy Moriarty) -- moves in next door.

From there, nothing is what it seems and all you know for sure is that Vic and his wife seem out to get Belushi, and Belushi's wife even seems in on some of the madness.  But every time Belushi tries to call them on it, HE somehow comes out looking like the bad guy.  Every time he tries to expose how everyone is against him, it just backfires until...

Well, I won't play spoiler.  Just check out the movie if you haven't already!!  And be sure to give it at least a couple of viewings.  It gets funnier every time I watch and I've seen it probably 30 times now!  The stories of Belushi being out of it on cocaine during the filming of this may indeed be true (he clearly had a problem....), but you can't tell from his performance.  This is his most demanding comedic role and he delivers, as does Aykroyd and all the cast.  Remember:  popular does not equal ""good"" and UN-popular does not equal NOT GOOD!

618257,1,6303257739,"You couldn't find a bigger fan of John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd going into the Christmas holiday of 1981...and then they released NEIGHBORS.

At least with Spielberg's 1979 bomb, ""1941"", there was enough special effects and mayhem to keep the audience distracted from what a vapid stinkbomb that movie really added up to.

When NEIGHBORS came out, everyone knew it stank after the first screening.  Siskel and Ebert's thumbs didn't know what to do.  All the elements were there.  How could this miss?

If you read Bob Woodward's excellent book about Belushi's final days, ""Wired"", there was no hope WHILE THEY WERE FILMING IT.  The producers fumbled when they chose ROCKY director John Avlidsen to direct (their logic was that they could hit comedy gold by hiring a humorless, serious director--say, like a Stanley Kubrick--and letting him direct a dark comic screenplay--like DR. STRANGELOVE, for instance).

Wrong.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.  Belushi wanted to kill the director just days into shooting, publicly announcing that Avlidsen knew nothing about humor or comic timing.  Switching Aykroyd & Belushi to play against type was a bold move but this movie just flogs along, never finding itself and definitely blowing any chance for a funny scene.

It's too bad.  The movie sank like a stone in Christmas of '81.  On March 5th, 1982, John Belushi died on Sunset Boulevard, a sqaulid death and a Hollywood tragedy because he never got the chance to prove himself after NEIGHBORS.  Sad.

At least we'll always have ""Saturday Night Live"" (which is being released by each season, thankfully) and NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE.",1207785600,13,1625,5.098484848484849

Dan thought and said, ""wanna switch?""

Danny's played loud and boisterous before (and since) but this is the first (and last) time John has ever played a straight man, and THAT'S what makes this film special.

Something about it though, made me want to watch it again. Maybe it was the odd dialoge, or the surreal atmosphere. I found myself quoting it with other friends who had seen it as well.
I found the video in a sale bin some years later, and invested the $5.00 in it, and have probably never gotten so much milage for so little money from anything else.
I'm glad to see that many people like it (I'm glad to see also, that not eveyone gets it). One thing that has not been mentioned in the reviews is the weird Nazi theme that runs through the film. From Vic's ""Arian"" look, to the book on the Third Reich that is in Earl's den, to Vic speaking German to the dog. I'm not sure what it all means, if anything, but it adds to the bizarre nature of the movie.

618399,5,6303257739,"I'm in the first catagory.

I have to make one thing clear, before I delve into why I like this movie so much, and it's the misconceptions about the title. It's called ""Neighbors,"" not ""The Neighbors."" This seems a small point, but it's not. ""The Neighbors"" denotes the people next door only, and calling it ""Neighbors (no 'the')"" tells the viewer that it's about the people in both homes. It's the interaction between both families.

This film has a creepy, dream-like quality to it, and that itself, is a part of the cast, as much as the actors. The odd sound effects, and the fact that a large part of the story happens overnight, adds to it all. Just look at the scenery, even in the daylight shots.

It's a bizarre film, it's hard to describe, and all I can say, is you have to see it for yourself to see what is meant here. John Belushi plays the straight man to Dan Aykroyd's lunatic, and even though Aykroyd's and Cathy Moriarty's characters are free-wheeling and likable, to a degree, they are ANNOYING! Very little consideration for the people they just moved in next door to, they are an exaggerated version of the neighbors we all dread having.

Little sublties are important in this kind of film, like the choice of music; In a scene where Belushi's character is dressing up to impress the woman next door (Moriarty), the soundtrack is playing ""Stayin' Alive"" by The Bee Gees. Things like this, are what make it funny, but it's actually the characterizations and the ""ATMOSPHERE"" which make this such a good film. Look at the camera angles, listen to the eerie sound effects, and the blue contact lenses that Dan Aykroyd wears, they just change his whole persona.

I didn't think I could appreciate John Belushi acting the part of such a straight arrow, especially after seeing him in ""1941"" and ""Animal House,"" and even more so, his years on ""Second City TV"" and ""Saturday Night Live,"" but he does the part well, and I'll admit, I fell into that trap, where I was expecting him to be typecast, and was disappointed at first by his being cast as such a harmless character, but he does it well, and I think it was proper casting. Great comedian, but here he proves he's a versatile actor. As a fan, I miss him.

As I said earlier, you'll either love this movie, or you'll hate it. And if you ""get"" it, in the least, you'll absolutely love it.",1130544000,8,2354,4.527058823529412
618439,2,6303257739,"I saw this movie years ago shortly after it was released in video.  Belushi and Ackroyd had made a pretty good name for their cooperative efforts back then and virtually anything they did was going to draw a pretty good crowd.  A lot of that had to do with the fact that these guys were pretty darn funny.  However, that fact alone doesn't guarantee success and ""Neighbors"" was a good example.

For me, ""black humor"" is something along the lines of ""Dr. Strangelove"" and there have been a lot of great movies that came close to that standard.  However, the ""black humor"" that this movie supposedly delivers is just a bunch of mindless, quasi-violent chaos.  I didn't care for it but, obviously, many people did.  What really got me about this movie was the opening statement that was shown before the cast and credits.  I don't know if this is still a part of the movie but back then this statement appeared that said that ""Neighbors"" was based on a highly esteemed off-Broadway play.  It went on to expand briefly on the high praise the critics gave it.  I sat there reading that and realized that these guys knew they had a turkey but that they wanted to shame everyone from figuring it out for themselves.  I've been waiting for the opportunity and after all these years, I'm proud to say that ""Neighbors"" is a highly mediocre film",1126656000,4,1334,4.563025210084033
618440,5,6303257739,"Wow, I thought I was the only person on the planet that loves this movie.  I am pleasantly surprised to see so many reviews here (positive, no less).  When I tell people this is my all-time favorite dark comedy, they have no idea what I'm talking about.  ""Neighbors...what's that?""

For those not in the know, here is the basic story:  Earl (Belushi) lives on the end of this cul de sac which appears to be in the middle of nowhere.  There are only two homes on the street.  Earl lives in one and the other is vacant.  There's a swamp in the yard (how cool is that?!) and there are these dangerous-looking power lines running through the back yard emitting bolts of electricity every few minutes.

The movie begins with Earl coming home with his wife from a hard day of work.  He's this ultra-conservative guy with a boring evening routine.  As he sits in front of his TV to watch the evening news (as his wife prepares dinner in the kitchen) he hears a car door slam shut.  Minutes later, the door bell rings (ding, dong).  Enter the new neighbors, Vick and Ramona.  Get ready for a ride!  The next 24 hours gets interesting.  Little ol' Earl has his life turned totally upside down by these crazy, crazy new neighbors.  I mean, these neighbors don't even sleep!

This is a must-see for anyone who loves dark or offbeat comedies.  Watch this with an opened mind and enjoy the ride!

Edit 01/28/2009:  I thought some of the fans of this film would be interested to know that the Universal HD channel aired Neighbors in all its HD glory just a few weeks ago.

618441,5,6303257739,A real classic of dark comedy!  Brilliant role reversal with Belushi and Akroyd.  One could watch this movie 100 x's and find something new to laugh at everytime!  Highly recommended!,1124064000,2,183,5.033333333333333
618442,5,6303257739,"I'm glad to see so many people love this film. It truly is brilliant. I have loved it since first seeing it on HBO in the early 80's. I remember when it first came out, all my friends were so disappointed that it wasn't like Animal House. In fact, it got so many bad reviews that I never went to the theater to see it.

It has since become my most loved film; I know every line. The reviews I have read here already expound beautifully on the movie's brilliance as a Black Comedy, so I won't try to elaborate any further.

Rather, my main reason for writing is because no one has mentioned Bill Conti's wonderful musical score. (Bill Conti wrote the theme from ""Rocky,"" among many other things) This is some of the most brilliant and creative film music I've ever heard. When I was a student at Berklee College of Music in the 1980's, this score was used as a ""textbook"" case study by the Film Scoring department. The masterful use of leit motifs and ""Mickey Mousing"" (taken from cartoon scoring of the 40's and 50's where the music mimicks the on-screen action), along with the multitude of original melodic and harmonic compositions, makes it, in my opinion, one of the finest and most ambitious film scoring efforts of its time.

In fact, I would go so far as to say that the score for Neighbors IS cartoon music. It was probably intended to be as such.

This is the classic film scoring ""style,"" if you will - played in orchestral form, usually conducted ""to picture"" by the composer. This means that the entire orchestra is seated in a big recording studio with a screen behind them on which the movie is played. The composer then conducts the ensemble by watching the ""live"" action.

There is so much going on musically here, that I would really need part of a semester to disseminate it, but next time you watch the movie, listen to all the incredible detail in the music. I especially love the minor-key reharmonization of ""No Place Like Home,"" and all the other themes and leit motifs he created, often with 2 or more variations of each. (A leit motif is essentially a character's own theme music - Earl's is always played with a trombone to impart the feeling that he's a chubby, hapless victim, while Vic's is played with a creepy Theremin sound).

I also love the scene where Earl comes out of ""The Swamp"" - this is classic 1950's Sci-Fi thriller music - maybe even borrowed from ""The Creature From the Black Lagoon"" or some other film of that era.

While watching this film recently, I realized just how important Mr. Conti's music really is to the film. It wouldn't be the same movie without it, and that is the film composer's ultimate goal - to create a score that becomes as much a part of the film as the visual elements, while also supporting character development and providing continuity that binds the whole story together.

Bill Conti achieved that and so much more in spades here.",1123286400,5,2904,4.528625954198473
618443,5,6303257739,"Wow, this is the funniest movie I've ever seen. Every time you watch you catch something new. Great musical themes, great insanity.

618445,5,6303257739,I love this movie.  It was one of my all time favorite comedies.  It isn't for everyone but if you like dark humor and the teaming of Akroyd and Belushi then this is a must see flick.  The script is brilliant and the acting by Belushi in particular is top notch.  There is a lot going on in this film.  Very well directed and shot.,1071100800,11,331,4.030769230769231
618446,5,6303257739,"This movie is extremely underrated. John Belushi plays Earl, a normal guy with a (fairly) normal wife. But when Vic (Dan Aykroyd) and his wife Ramona (Cathy Moriarty) move in next door his life is turned upside down. Whilst Vic's lunatic behaviour has Earl running round in circles, Ramona's over-the-top seductiveness leaves him panting. If it's laughs you want, then I strongly recommend this film!",1059004800,4,400,5.1692307692307695
618497,4,6303257739,"Neighbors is a startling character switch for John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd.  Belushi has always played the somewhat whacked out lunatic fringe personality, while Aykroyd always stays just a little bit saner. In Neighbors, Belushi plays a regular boring middle class guy living a regular uneventful life until the totally whacked out lunatic fringe Aykroyd moves next door. The events that follow are great comedy and not as predictable as you might think they would be. This is a very funny movie. If you are a Belushi/Aykroyd fan, you cant miss this flick.",1054512000,,557,4.989247311827957
618498,4,6303257739,"Neighbors is a pretty interesting movie cause John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd's roles are reversed meaning John Belushi plays the serious role while Dan Aykroyd plays the crazy role.
This movie is about a middle aged man named Earl Keese (Belushi) who is a bored suburbanite and he and wife don't speak to each other often, then a younger couple (Dan Aykroyd and Cathy Morarity) moves in next door and the fun begins.
This movie doesn't have much of a plot but it's a good way to spend an hour and a half by watching this movie, for those who want a great performance by John Belushi may not think much of this movie but I truly think that you should give this movie a try, unfortunately this was John Belushi's last movie cause a year later he died of a heroin overdose and he will always be in my heart cause he has done so much is his short lived career from Animal House, Saturday Night Live, Blues Brothers and the underrated romantic comedy Continental Divide.",1046563200,6,963,4.446327683615819
618499,5,6303257739,"This movie is sheer genius.  I think you have to be a bit ""messed up"" to truly understand it.  Conservative, normal folk just won't get it!  I hope it comes out on DVD soon.",1021248000,3,173,4.029411764705882
618500,5,6303257739,"When I first saw ""Neighbors"", I didn't get it.
On the way home, I found myself tranfixed by lines and scenes in the movie. After seeing it a second time, I was hooked. This is one of the funniest movies Belushi and Ackroyd made.
Without sounding too high-brow, it is an excellent character study of the up-tight white suburban male. Earl(Belushi) struggles to maintain his calm, normal lifestyle in the face of a nagging wife, wild teen daughter, and zany neighbors. However, in the end, he gives up and goes along. It would never work to have the reverse (have Vic, become the straight one).
As I said in the title, you have to watch this a second time. When you do, you will find yourself saying things like,
""I like my coffee black and tepid.""",1015459200,6,746,4.492647058823529
618501,5,6303257739,"Vic: We're waiting, or do I have to pound it out of you?
Earl Keese: Don't ever speak to me like that in my own house!
Vic: Why would I?
Earl Keese: You just did.
Vic: I didn't mean anything - it's just something a guy says.
Earl Keese: I never say it.
Vic: I don't blame you.
Simply one of the witty exchanges in the post-modern Robert Riskin vein.  Much too much.
What more can one say... experience it with some spaghetti from Caesar's Garlic Wars, a Small Spaghetti and Wine Dealership at Valley Field Mall on Route 3 next to the Cinema-Cineplex and the Singer Sewing Center.
If I could, I would buy a beer for every single Amazon critique who graced NEIGHBORS with 5 Gold Stars.  I'm a Guinness Monster myself.
What next:  DVD including these features - DTS and Dolby 5.1; Isolated Score Track; Audio Commentary by Dan Aykroyd, Cathy Moriarty, Gerald Hirshfield, Bill Conti and John G. Avildsen; Deleted Scenes; Outtakes; Script-To-Screen Comparision; Behind-The-Scenes Documentary; a list of all the drugs John Belushi scored while shooting the film on Staten Island; and an interactive trivial knowledge game.  The box set with CD soundtrack, lobby cards and film frame would be nice too as a Limited Edition type thing.
It will happen.  They did it for BUCKAROO BANZAI.
Buy this piece of late 20th Century Avant-Garde Midnight Cinema.

618503,5,6303257739,"I don't know what it is about this movie, but I just can't get enough.  Akroyd dressed up in the diving outfit, carrying a shotgun, and making a couple cups of late night coffee just cracks me up.  Belushi is in rare form (you won't see him in another role like this!) as the straight man.  He still does some great visual comedy, such as when Romana hits him with a pool ball and he crashes into a bookcase filled with expensive glassware.  When you think an awkward situation can't get worse, the plot twists and you are in for another ride.  This can make some people uncomfortable which I find strange.  My wife can't stand the movie because it never centers on comfortable ground.  Most movies gear up/set up a laugh, while this one keeps rolling and punching the entire time.  Every scene that is shot is meaningful to the movie's zig zag plot.  Contrary to my wife, I love every uncomfortable twist.  I can quote more from this movie than from Blues Brothers and Raising Arizona.  If you liked those movies, you'll probably love this one.",987465600,8,1045,4.50531914893617
618504,5,6303257739,"I saw this movie when it was first released at the ""Grauman's Chinese Theater"" in Hollywood. It was unbelievable which is what made it so incredible. Sorry, Leonard Maltin, you really missed the boat on this one! Most intelligent movie goers can pretty much tell where the plot line in a movie is taking them but not so with ""Neighbors""! It is so outlandish, so abnormally weird that it's hard to keep up with it, and that's why it is so raucously funny! You may not not catch all there is in your first viewing of ""Neighbors""  as it is a continous stream of, (if you will excuse) soliloquy-isms used so often in our daily conversations, i.e., ""True change comes only from within."" You really have to pay attention and be alert to catch half of the things alluded to in this brilliantly acted movie. I too am sorry this was John Belushi's last movie but at least in this one, he and Akyroyd have left us with, ""Say what?"", ""I can't believe what they just did!"" and ""We'll have to call Ceasar's and thank the chef!"" I own this movie and think it's a great gift to give so it can be watched over and over again, until you think you get it!

618505,4,6303257739,"Academy Award winner John Avildsen ruined this what good of been one of the greatest Aykroyd/Belushi movie since 1941 and Blues Brothers. It was humiliating. This was a complete flop for Belushi,The last thing that he needed. I Thought The director was a moron trying toput a comedy together. John Belushi went after this total embarrisment to write his own script NOBLE ROT. Dan Aykroyd was supposed to play the straight placed neighbor and Belushi was supposed to be the party animal. Then before this they went to the head of Columbia pictures and told Frank Price that they were going to switch roles. Belushi and Aykroyd got together and rewrote the Larry Gelbart script. According to the movie and manager Bernie Brillstien that the script wasn't good at all. Instead of a funny movie,it is a dark black comedy about the suburbs. Low budget 1981 film only filmed in two houses. There are scenes in the movie where John looks like he's upset with his character and is out of it. He sometimes wouldn't come out of his trailer. They wanted Rodney Dangerfield(Natural Born Killers) to play Earl Keese. Director:John G. Avildsen Cast:John belushi. Tim Kazurinsky. Dan Aykroyd. Cathy Moriarty.",978134400,2,1193,4.940298507462686

Dan Aykroyd is always fantastic,but Cathy Moriarty  really steals the movie. Everywhere John goes,in the shower,to bed,any part  of the house,Cathy's there.
