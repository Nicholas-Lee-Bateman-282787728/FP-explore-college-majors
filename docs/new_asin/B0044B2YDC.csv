8416047,5,B0044B2YDC,"I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewer's positive comments about this video. *Families of Afghanistan* is going to be screened for our ESL students because it's timely, well made, interesting, and even features two girls as its profile subjects.

Madina and Zamora live in a war-torn country, and the video doesn't shy away from what that means in their daily lives. Zamora's family in particular has felt the overwhelming effects of decades of civil war and foreign intervention. Seeing her with her relative who was injured by war was something that the kids and adults who saw this video had questions about, among the many others that came up about Afghan life. We talked about the war in Afghanistan, Afghan culture, madrassahs, and the lives of girls in Muslim countries. I thought this video was a first-rate way to introduce my students to how kids live in countries and cultures so different from their own, while helping them see that kids are universally kids, and the dailiness of family life has common themes and rhythms no matter where you live.

The add-ons to this new product in the *Families of the World* video series are great, particularly the teacher's guide, activity guides, and maps. Check out the trailers on YouTube, and share this video with your students. It's a great introduction to a country many of them have questions about these days.",1290038400,,1378,4.935344827586207
8416048,5,B0044B2YDC,"We've had kids in our school district and at our local libraries who want to learn more about Afghanistan, because they have parents or other family members or friends who are serving in the military there. This video, a new entry in the *Families of the World* series, is an excellent introduction to the country, and it's age appropriate for elementary- and middle-school students and yet interesting enough to engage adult viewers. I also found the narration in kids' voices in English was easy for my ESL students to follow.

*Families of Afghanistan* features two girls (most of the *FOTW* videos focus on both a girl and a boy). Zamora's extended family lives in a way that is perhaps more traditional, and they have directly experienced the devastating results of 30 years of war. Zamora's uncle's severe injuries from a land mine are not downplayed by this video, and Zamora helps care for him on camera. Her faith as a Muslim and her schooling (based on the Koran) will be something that many North American kids will also have questions about, and the video will intrigue them. The kids can see Zamora as a teenage girl who shares most of their concerns (family, home, friends, learning, chores, faith) but whose culture is in some ways radically different from their own.

Madina's life style in Kabul offers more modern conveniences and less traditional schooling that Zamora's. Madina will probably seem more ""like them"" to many viewers than Zamora will, but both girls have something to teach viewers about a country that has been prominently featured in the news for decades but is still little known to many foreigners.

Check out the two video clips on YouTube under ""Families of Afghanistan (Families of the World) Rural Trailer"" and ""Urban Trailer."" I highly recommend this video and the accompanying materials (including maps, a glossary, and discussion guides, which will be a big plus for any classroom use). And the recipes in the discussion guides sound delicious! We've asked our local library to play this video as part of its movie series on kids around the world. Since they've already bought many of the *Families of the World* videos and have many library users with ties to service members overseas, I expect they'll buy a copy soon if they haven't ordered one already.",1289174400,2,2300,4.907455012853471
