8022713,5,B00026L8IA,I remember this show when I was 13 - it was so adorable and it protrayed preeteens and teens in an animated with in a real light. It was a very good show - sad it was not released in a full DVD complete set. Its three episodes per DVD and its still nice though - hopefully they release it all on DVD.,1391817600,,300,3.7777777777777777
8022714,5,B00026L8IA,"I purchased this show for my daughter when she was 10, she will be 13 next week and still loves it.  It deals with a lot of ""tween"" girl issues in a funny manner.  We really enjoy this show, too bad Ms. Silverstone wasn't able to keep it going.",1320019200,,244,3.9591836734693877
8022715,4,B00026L8IA,"Braceface is definitely a family program.  My eight year old daughter loves to watch it.  Some of the episodes that we have seen are geared towards kids in the pre-teen years, but most are very family oriented.  I wish that the program still came on tv here in the states, but unfortunately it doesn't.",1225670400,,302,4.555555555555555
8022716,3,B00026L8IA,"It's a cute show. I've seen it a couple of times on Disney, but it really isn't anything for kids under 10.  It basically deals with situations that a preteen to early teen would be dealing with in middle school.  It's very realistic and insightful into the minds of kids (my kid sister enjoys it very much).  There's a lot of real relation to be had.

And the reviewer below (Grady P.) has got to be the most uninformed person on the planet.  Owning every Disney game doesn't make him a Disney expert (or a gamer geek, for that matter); it just makes him a 30 year old man who still lives with his mom, sitting at home all day watching the Disney channel because he has no life.

Times change.  Children are growing up faster.  They're dealing with stresses at an earlier age, and while this show isn't as innocent as Snow White, that doesn't mean that it doesn't teach kids a good lesson or two.  And I've heard three year olds say ""oh my God"".  Not a big deal.  ""That's So Raven"" has used ""oh my God"" before.  It's better than a one star review.

Sorry... I get a little worked up by people like that...  What it boils down to is this:  It's a cute show.  Not for young children, but for preteens.  But if you can, view it on the Disney Channel first so you know what you're getting into.",1142812800,,1291,4.225409836065574
8022717,5,B00026L8IA,"Is a very real show.  If you like Kim Possible you'll love this show.  Not for anyone under 12 or so.

<3~Kp~",1119830400,,109,3.8636363636363638
8022718,5,B00026L8IA,"Braceface is a great cartoon for teens, tweens and even adults. Some of the awkward moments and situations are hilarious and the problems are problems that everyone has or will face at some point. Gets good points accross without being preachy, a great change of pace from the typical cartoons of the day.",1100217600,3,305,4.773584905660377
