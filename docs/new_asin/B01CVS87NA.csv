8754298,5,B01CVS87NA,"Look, this was never one of your top-tier anime series, and the dub isn't the greatest. English voice actors shouting to match the intensity of Japanese shonen voice actors over occasionally static animation was the style at the time, what can I say. But I've got a lot of affection for this weird little show.

Ahead of its time in many ways, Dai-Guard marries the classic monster-of-the-week plot formula to a humanist tale of people just trying to get along in this increasingly messed-up world of ours. They bicker and get on each other's nerves, but at the end of the day, they're all there to do a job that they consider important. Think of it like The Office, but instead of a paper factory, they pilot a giant robot (and they're not such jerks).

Basically, it's a feel-good show with a satisfying ending, and if the dub's not your thing, these DVDs let you watch it subbed instead.",1512518400,,890,4.591194968553459

8754301,5,B01CVS87NA,"Fun series with an interesting premise. It's not one of the pillars of anime and I'm sure ""aficionados"" will turn their noses up at it, but if your a casual viewer this is worth a watch. Come on, what other giant robot show protagonists have to worry about insurance claims after the heroic fighting!?",1474156800,,301,4.592592592592593
8754302,4,B01CVS87NA,"This series is a great blend of the Mecha Genre and Comedic Drama. About a group of misfit office workers that inherit a giant robot and lend their services to the military to combat Aliens attacking the earth. Dai Guard often feels like a blend of Neon Genesis Evangelion and Patlabor and succeeds at being entertaining throughout.

Recommended.",1470787200,3,346,4.9655172413793105
