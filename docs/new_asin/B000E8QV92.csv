8107462,2,B000E8QV92,"I tried to like this movie but it just wasn't happening.

My main complaint is the subtitles...the movie is subtitled which is fine; however, the white subtitles are difficult to read at times since the movie is in black and white.  Yellow subtitles stand out a little better than white and is more pleasing to the eye.  At times I had no clue as to what the actors were saying because I was unable to see the subtitles.

The film looks like a highschool/college student shot it.  It reminds me of a home movie and at times the acting seems rather off like the person isn't sure what to do.  Some of the actios are awkward too...like the actors are awaiting direction or confirmation that they did the scene correctly.

I don't know how the movie ended and I don't really care since what I did see was substandard and yes, I am aware of the shoestring budget....but what I did see didn't motivate enough curiousity to try to watch it till the end.  Also, it didn't matter since I couldn't see the white subtitles on the white background.

There are NO extras or any kind on the dvd...just play movie, scene selection and trailor.",1331769600,,1129,4.46829268292683
8107463,4,B000E8QV92,"Director Adrian Garcia Bogliano does terrific work here

on a shoestring budget. Finely crafted screenplay. I liked the editing, score, perfomances; just a nice job all around.

Bogliano is probably better than most filmmakers working in the genre today.

The only minus, and I hate to even bring this up, because it's obvious they had next to no money, it seems it was shot on Hi-8 (or something). It's also B&W. Now, mind you, I don't mind Black & White at all, but the picture is not as sharp as it ought to be, etc. Like I said, though, this is a very minor complaint.

RE: Extras. Don't expect much. No commentary, no behind the scenes--and it's too bad. Would have been interesting to hear what the filmmakers had to say.

Bottom line: one of the better scare flicks in some time.",1147478400,5,786,4.507042253521127
