8489339,4,B005YRQLC0,"You can tell who is an adult man starved for soccer on TV or the films here in soccer (the ""real"" football) starved Canada! ('Tis I, in cae you need the prompting.) I'll watch almost any film about soccer, and that includes even movies like these aimed at soccer kids and their soccer moms. That said, the sequel, ""Soccer Dog: European Cup"", released in 2004, is a more interesting and involving film than the first one from 1999, ""Soccer Dog: the Movie"". The two films are only dimly related in story line, apart from starring a cute, athletic hound (each differently off-bred from mongrel) in both of these canine sagas. The setting of the sequel is in small Scottish town, more colourful than the earlier film's American suburb, the dramatic situation of father and son brought together in the sequel by the transatlantic mother's demise, with bonding taking place only with difficulty, and, let's face it, playing in the sport itself which, in the 2004 movie, is a whole lot more interesting on the part of its adult players (plus on the part of its own particular dog and kid), combining to result in a more involving movie than the 1999 film, which is a bit longer on sap-sucking than on soccer.

Of course, children's and family viewing being at what these films aim, the acting is exaggerated and goofy a lot of the time in both movies. However, that is pardonable in motion pictures of this kind and for such targeted audiences.

Actually, the soccer playing scenes, at first buffoonish, then more intensely professional in quality, in ""Soccer Dog: European Cup"", are worth a soccer fan's time watching for their own sake. As for how the dog, Kimble, plays, the trainers were able to coax and to instill into that li'l fella much more visually interesting moves than they had done so for Lincoln, the soccer-playing hound in ""Soccer Dog: the Movie"". Kimble, in the sequel, when he is with or without the ball, darts, and dodges, runs in various directions as the game's progress requires, and does some exciting scoring himself. Lincoln, on the other hand, pretty much always just runs  down the field with the ball in a straight line, therefore, as a putative quadruped soccer player, not nearly so much fun to watch compared to clever Kimble!

The sporty males among the grown-ups, when they get down to some serious, competitive soccer moves, are genuinely exciting to watch. Of course, the players in the original movie were children, not adult men, so perhaps it may seem unfair to some to make such invidious comparisons. Even so, for soccer's sake, ""Soccer Dog: the Movie"", for this soccer fan, is worth it as a warm-up to the greater fun and frolics of ""Soccer Dog: European Cup"". So, get both films together so conveniently in this double feature. The edition which I have (which may not be quite the same as this one, so far as some of its technical features are concerned) includes both films in the English-only soundtrack, as obtained here in Qubec, is Sony Pictures Home Entertainment 11589; it comprises both movies in full screen display, which seems adequate to the purpose for both of these barkin'-fun films!",1477267200,,3136,4.780442804428044
