778945,5,6304108842,Airport 77 is one of those adventure movies that I enjoy and remember as a child.  The DVD came out recently and I'm surprised I'm the first to make a review about it.

779219,4,6304108842,"Jimmy Stewart, Jack Lemmon, and George Kennedy lead a cast of stars in Airport '77.

A customized 747, owned by a wealthy industrialist, played by Stewart, is hijacked and crashes in the Atlantic Ocean.

Aboard the luxury jet are wealthy friends, his daughter and grandson, and the crooks who intended to land the plane on a remote island and steal the valuable artwork stowed onboard.

The survivors have only hours to live as the limited oxygen aboard is depleted.

The captain of the plane, played by Lemmon, risks his life to find help.

The backstories of the passengers is a bit overdramatic, but the producers had to develop something to keep the audience interested before help arrives.

The list of stars reads almost like a guest cast list of an episode of ""The Love Boat"", and I am certain some of the stars in this movie later appeared with Gopher, Doc, and Isaac soon after this movie was shot.

It's an exciting film. The performances are nothing extraordinary. The special effects are above average for the era.

779330,5,6304108842,This is one of my old time favorite movies. I thought the acting was pretty good as well for the script they were given,1395705600,,119,4.0
779331,4,6304108842,"Airport '77 took a lot of flak. lt was retroactively nominated for Razzies and was so knocked around that Jack Lemmon even finally said he regretted taking his role in it. And it is in fact sort of a cookie cutter 70s disaster movie, with a premise that is no more than a gimmick.

However, the guys behind this movie assembled an excellent cast. I don't think you could write a script so terrible that the likes of Jack Lemmon, Robert Foxworth, Darren McGavin, Olivia de Havilland, George Kennedy, Christopher Lee, Lee Grant, Brenda Vaccaro, James Stewart, Kathleen Quinlan and Joseph Cotton wouldn't make it look good. These were pros whose performances were always anywhere from solid to brilliant. Their contributions to this film, along with others in the cast, saved it from the level of utter dross it could well have become.

There is nothing special about the plot and  sub-plots, yet there is real tension as the sunken airliner begins to leak and Navy rescue operations begin. Potential scene chewing moments of dialogue are given real life and emotion by the expert cast of talented actors. And while the idea of the sunken airliner is almost mild compared to the over the top disaster contrivances in decades since, it truly was an innovative idea for its day.

It's mind candy, but it's mind candy with a cast that demands attention and respect.

779401,4,6304108842,"Of the three sequels to the 1970 blockbuster film AIRPORT, the film that is generally credited with having begat the first wave of disaster films that were so popular with audiences (and so vilified by the critics) in the 1970s, the 1977 offering AIRPORT '77 probably has the most to offer in terms of suspense, plot, and acting, and the least in the way of the kinds of clichs that were to be skewered to no end by AIRPLANE! in 1980.  Even though some of the situations depicted in the film seem incredible to believe, it is due in no small part to the above-average quality of the acting of a lot of the cast that they seem fully credible, and the tension is often palatable.  And this time around, there is a slight element of the supernatural, as most of the goings-on in the second half of the film take place in that part of the Atlantic bounded by Miami, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda--the infamous Bermuda Triangle, where it is said ships and planes have been known to vanish without a trace.

The plane in question is the new Stevens Corporation jumbo jet, whose owner (James Stewart) has invited many dignitaries onboard to take a flight from Washington to his place in Palm Beach, Florida for the opening of his new art museum and library grounds.  There's several million dollars worth of paintings onboard in the cargo hold, which makes it a target for a trio of art thieves (Michael Pataki; Robert Foxworth; Monte Markham).  During mid-flight, the thieves allow sleeping gas to seep into the passenger cabin of the plane, and cause the passengers to go to sleep, while they try to get their hands on those paintings.  Foxworth, meantime, sets the plane on a course that takes it right into the Bermuda Triangle, and underneath coastal radar.  But the whole thing goes awry when, flying through a fog bank, the jet strikes the top of an oil platform, and is sent out of control onto, and then under, the Atlantic.  When the passengers come to, they find their plane under one hundred feet of water.  The combination of outside water pressure and the lack of oxygen inside the plane doesn't give them much time; and the chief pilot (Jack Lemmon) is forced to swim out of a flooded cargo hold and up to the surface in a life raft equipped with a homing device that will allow the Navy and other rescue parties to find the plane.  The end rescue sequence does admittedly stretch plausibility, but it works well enough.

Lemmon's performance as the pilot is one of many reasons why AIRPORT `77 works as well as it does; his typical Everyman quality is the kind audiences appreciate (much like pilot Chesley Sullenberger in the real-life 2009 Miracle on the Hudson).  And although Lee Grant's performance as the obnoxious wife of a philanthropist (Christopher Lee) is so over-the-top that it weighs the film a bit, the solid supporting performances of Joseph Cotten, Olivia DeHavilland, and Darren McGavin more than compensate for that fault, as do the performances of others in the cast, including Kathleen Quinlan, M. Emmet Walsh, Pamela Bellwood, Robert Hooks, Gil Gerard, James Booth, and (in a cameo as Joe Patroni) George Kennedy.  Jameson, normally a TV director who nevertheless earned his pedigree in the disaster genre on the small screen through films like 1974's HURRICANE and TERROR ON THE 40TH FLOOR, does a fairly good job of handling what at first seems to be a typically implausible disaster film plot.  A lot of the credit for that success must go to the skillful visual effects work of Albert Whitlock, who had worked on many a Universal film, including Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 horror classic THE BIRDS, and Frank Brendel, who won an Oscar with Whitlock in 1974 for EARTHQUAKE.  The other important element is the music score by John Cacavas, which varies between brooding avant-garde sounds and typical grandiose orchestral gestures.  The end result with AIRPORT '77 is a film that manages to be suspenseful and entertaining while dialing down some of the worst excesses of the disaster genre that so alienated critics, and doing so with solid performances from virtually everyone concerned.",1267747200,2,4114,4.78954802259887
779402,2,6304108842,"This is the least memorable entry in a mediocre movie franchise. The original Airport is a terrific movie! Airport '75 is silly fun, and Airport '79 is ludicrous. '77 is in comparison pretty tedious. Something that I have never seen anyone comment on is that it is very similar to an episode of the excellent children's TV Show from the 1960s 'Thunderbirds'. In the episode ""Operation: Crash-Dive' a futuristic airliner crash lands in the ocean and sinks to the bottom. The crew are trapped inside, with the air slowing running out. What's more the plane was sabotaged and so there is no accurate radar record of it's location, making hope of rescue very unlikely. The crew are thanks to the arrival of International Rescue who use Thunderbird 4 (their submarine) to cutting off the airliner's waterlogged motors and thereby allowing the fuselage to the float to the surface where the crew can be safely evacuated, seconds before the plane sinks again. For anyone who has seen Airport '77 this will sound very familiar. Thunderbirds is much more fun, and dramatic!",1246579200,,1064,4.916666666666667
779403,4,6304108842,"In this installemnt, a 747 is taken over by would-be art thieves (who are assisted by the co-pilot) andultimately crash in the Bermuda Triangle.  Fortunately for the passengers, the plane lands on a sandbar in relatively shallow water.  Tensions raise and eventually the Navy comes to the rescue, but not before we get the usual 1970's drama of watching people come unglued.

There is a good bunch of characters, including three guys who intend to be drunk the entire flight, the nun who plays guitar, the old lady with a taste for boilermakers, and of course the bad guys.  Some, well most, of the acting is mediocre though there once again is a surprizing number of big name stars (Jack Lemmon, Jimmy Stewart, George Kennedy, etc.) who for whatever reason became part of the cast.

While this movie isn't awful, it's not great, either.  But it makes for a good night of entertainment provided you don't have something more important to do like cleaning your bathroom or changing the oil in your car.",1225584000,,1001,4.757225433526012

Jack Lemmon in a dramtic performance is very good as the pilot with Brenda Vaccaro as his girlfriend and in charge of overseeing making sure all the passengers are attended too.  Olivia De Havilland and Joseph Cotton are old friends who met again.  George Kennedy returns as Joe Patroni.  Darren McGavin, Monica Lewis, Kathleen Quinlan, Robert Hooks, Robert Foxworth, Monte Markham and James Stewart as Philip Stevens also star.

Stevens tells the media that the usage plane he built will revolutionize the airplane industry. While in a local airport a man and a pilot changes briefcases in a magazine store.

The sequels that followed: Airport 1975 (1974) and Airport '77 (1977) did not have that big of a success, though the former fared better at the box office. I was not really that impressed with the latter in scientific terms. The plane crashes at sea and sinks to the bottom when only the forward cargo hold flooded. There was plenty of air inside the rest of the plane that, in reality, could keep it afloat for as long as it was available. The characters, like Airport 1975, overacted as well.

779500,4,6304108842,"""Airport '77,"" directed by Jerry Jameson, is a good example of the disaster flick genre.  In this film some aspiring thieves attempt to hijack a luxury aircraft full of valuable works of art.  But when the plot goes horribly wrong, the plane's heroic pilot (Jack Lemmon) must lead the crew and passengers in a harrowing struggle for survival.
Although some corny, soap opera-ish elements give the film a dated feel, overall it's a gripping and entertaining adventure.  Lemmon makes a solid, likeable action hero, and he and Brenda Vaccaro (as his character's love interest) have an engaging onscreen chemistry.  The rest of the cast is full of both big stars and recognizable character actors, among them Lee Grant, Joseph Cotten, James Stewart, George Kennedy and Robert Foxworth.  Veteran film villain Christopher Lee is particularly memorable; here he is successfully cast against type in a sympathetic role.
The film strikes a solid balance between character-driven drama and hardware-driven action scenes.  The cooperation of the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard (noted in the closing credits) undoubtedly contributed to the flavor of authenticity in certain key scenes.

779501,4,6304108842,"Airport 77 has the best thing ever any movie could have - Jack Lemon. He is and always will be my favorite actor of all time. He can be intriguing, enchanting, enlighten, scary and above all he has an incredible sense of timing and humor. The industry lost a genius last year when he passed away.
Now besides this movie having Jack Lemon, the movie also contains extensive talents from people like - Brenda Vaccaro, lee Grant, Joseph Cotton, Olivia De Havellin, Darren McGavin, Christopher Lee, Robert Foxworth and Gil Gerard
The story is one of the scariest you could think of if you have ever travel on a 747 or larger airplane. What it the plane was taken over by the 'bad guys'? Scary? What is the plane crashed because of their take-over? Is that even scarier? What if it crashed in the ocean? Now that's got to be real frightening!
The movie contains a lot of action and drama and some great miniature effects with the plane crashing into the water and the final lifting of the plane to the ocean surface as well. The whole search and rescue sequence is very interesting too.
The DVD doesn't contain any extras, but as far as movies go - it does have a good sense of drama - and - Jack Lemon is worth it alone! (12-11-03)",1071100800,3,1227,4.409691629955947

A great movie a total real diaster flick in picture quality. Non anamorphic, deffintaly not remastered or digitally transfered.

Sounded like mono to me.

While I must admit, the plot of the movie is rather fantastic, consdering a 747 hitting the water at 200 knots+ would break up. But, one thing that I am impressed with is the aircraft realism (the same goes for Airport '75). The production unit really went out of their way to represent the 747 in an accurate way. This film, along with Airport '75, utilized the American Airlines 747 flight simulators in Dallas, TX, thus providing the audience with a true-to-life cockpit environment. Therefore, this is a MUST for aviation buffs...
My only complaint about this movie is the quality of the DVD...Despite being a below-average transfer, it offers no special features or deleted scenes. Anyone who has seen the TV version of this movie knows that there is a lot of extra footage, especially in the beginning. Hopefully, there will be another release somewhere down the road...Maybe a collector's box of all the Airport films?",1040515200,5,1150,4.994791666666667
779505,3,6304108842,"When millionaire collector James Stewart is talking about the guests he will be flying in for the opening of his museum, he tells reporters, ""I think you'll all agree we brought them here in style.""  The sharp viewer will, of course, recognize irony in those words because this is an Airport movie and his guests are guaranteed anything but a comfortable flight.  I've always had a soft spot for the Seventies' disaster flicks, and this is one of my favourites.  Art hijackers plan to take control of Stewart's jet to steal his cargo and leave his passengers, put to sleep by gas, sitting on the plane on a remote island.  But this is a disaster movie and the hijacking doesn't go quite as planned, leaving the airplane sitting on the bottom of the ocean instead. It's intact, but slowly flooding and with the fresh air disappearing rapidly.  It becomes a race against time to somehow signal for help while the Coast Guard and Navy search for the missing plane, well of course from where they expect it to be. The Seventies' disaster flicks usually had great casts, and this is no exception.  Jack Lemmon is very intense and convincing as the heroic captain and Brenda Vaccaro brings warmth and vulnerability to her character as the stewardess/assistant to Stewart.  Lee Grant chews the scenery (as she sometimes did), playing the drinking bitter wife of the emotionally distant Christopher Lee, while Olivia de Havilland is amusing as a poker playing art patron.  Darren McGavin, Pamela Bellwood, and M. Emmett Walsh are also quite effective in supporting roles.  Given the time, the special effects are good, both as the plane crashes and as it floods during the rescue attempt.  The set design of the unique jet is excellent.  The rescue procedure is hard to believe, despite the mandatory disclaimer at the end that it was a real technique used.  Far from a great film, Airport '77 is an entertaining film, well cast and fun to watch.",1033689600,2,1938,4.786786786786787
779506,3,6304108842,"I remember this movie from when I was a little kid and it played on television like a mini-series, airing over 2 nights. I loved it then and was excited when my copy of the DVD turned up in my mailbox. I wasn't disappointed. Sure, the special effects are a bit dodgy, but this film was made in a time when movies were meant to be fun and didn't take themselves too seriously.
As with all the Airport movies, as well as all the disaster flicks I suppose, the stellar cast reads like a who's who of 1970's Hollywood. The plot is good, if not beleivable and the acting is strictly high camp and the movie itself is second only to Airport 75 out of the four movies in the series.
Once again, unfortunately, I was disappoited with the features on offer. It is a pity and an oversight as far as I am concerned, as all of the Airport movies had such big name casts and were such hits in their day that there was ample opportunity to flood us with tidbits and trivia.
If you enjoy nostalgia and all those old disaster flicks I would happily recommend Airport '77.",1029369600,,1055,4.253731343283582
779507,3,6304108842,"Airport '77 features a wide array of Hollywood stars, including Jimmy Stewart, Jack Lemmon, Olivia DeHavilland, Christopher Lee, Joseph Cotten, and Lee Grant.  There's probably a few too many stars to keep our eyes on in this story of a privately-owned Boeing 747 luxury jetliner that gets lost in The Bermuda Triangle and crashes into the ocean.  But the action and rescue scenes somewhat make up for the weak script.  There are some good visual images in the film, especially of the Jumbo Jet smashing into the sea!  (Very realistic looking!)  Lemmon, as always, gives a good performance, as the plane's #1 pilot.  I guess they didn't have room on board for Charo.  But she does show up in the 4th (and thus far last) installment of the ""Airport"" series -- ""Airport '79-The Concorde"".  That last one gets ""zero"" stars!  Good only for a healthy laugh or two!",1007251200,,859,4.75
779563,4,6304108842,"The Airport films are a guilty pleasure for me, and have been since I was very young. I finally got around to buying this DVD just recently and I was both pleased and disappointed. What was pleasing was seeing the film with clarity and in widescreen. All I had previously was an old 1980's VHS copy of the movie. So that was quite good.
However, the DVD transfer is very disappointing. In the beginning where we see Philip Stevens (James Stewart), his jacket moves around something horrible (due to it being a checked pattern). The same thing happens throughout the film with other costumes, and certain portions have a digital overtone to them (there's a term for it but I can't remember what that is).
The film itself is quite good - you get to see people like the aforementioned James Stewart, the delightful Olivia de Havilland (seeing her as a card shark in a scene in this film is vastly amusing!), Brenda Vaccaro (always talented), and a host of other stars. Jack Lemmon is also extremely good as the hero in this film - taking the role seriously and producing something different for him.
A fairly gripping storyline that you should take for what it is. It manages to hold up without succumbing to the usual 70's disaster flick bad lines and formula - and I would hazard a guess that the stellar acting from the very talented cast is partly the reason for this. As James Stewart said, ""It's an adventure film, and there have always been adventure films"".
Finally, what would have been nice on the DVD? The original trailer... the approximately 40 minutes of scenes that appear only in the Network TV version (which I have on VHS as well - a lot of gems there - even as an extra feature, it would be good)... and of course the original bios and photos that came in the original press kit (which I also have). Of course, a better transfer would be nice too. So I am hopeful that someday a new one will be released... until then, this is better than my VHS copy!",1001894400,2,1967,4.481894150417827

779567,3,6304108842,"Airport '77 is a fairly exciting and suspenseful disaster movie.  The all star cast give professional performances in roles that require them to just fill in the screen until the special effects and action can take over.  Pretty standard stuff, but the overall look of the movie is expensive and plush, the Oscar nominations were deserved.
The film itself has aged fairly well, Edith Head's costume design is far, far better in this film than it was in the eye melting Airport 1975 and it was mildly amusing to see the now obsolete Atari Pong video game and Laser Disc trotted out as the highest of tech toys on the plane.  The only quibble I have with this movie is the visually inert direction by Jerry Jameson.  Jameson, like Jack Smight (director of Airport 1975) and David Lowell Rich (director of The Concorde - Airport '79), was primarily a director of television movies and series episodes and it shows in the movie's overall lack of any real visual character.

Recently, I saw this film again for the first  time in 23 years.  Seeing it again, I wondered if it would hold up after  all these years and be as enjoyable as I remembered it.  Often, a movie  that was great when you were a kid suddenly becomes a steaming pile of crap  from an adult perspective.  To my pleasant surprise, this picture is quite  good.  What I like most about the flick is that it is different from other  disaster movies.  It features a hijacked 747 that crashes in the ocean,  intact, and sinks 50 feet to the bottom.  The creators of Airport 77 take  an admittedly loopy idea and makes it work.  One aspect that really sells  the plot is the great cast.  The lead is the great Jack Lemmon.  As the  pilot of the 747, he brings a lot of believability to his character. Lemmon  plays a man trying his best to save lives in the face of a hopeless  situation.  Darren McGavin is the designer of the plane and really makes  you believe that his character knows every square inch of the plane.  The  rest of the cast also delivers a fine job.  The special effects were done  the old fashioned way ( without CGI ) and are very convincing.  Unlike its  predecessor, Airport 1975, Airport 77 has a polished, big-budget look and  feel. This Goodtimes Home Video DVD release presents the film in  wide-screen and is a good transfer of this older release.  Some bare-bones  production notes are also included to give the viewer some background on  the cast.  I would have liked to see some behind the scenes info about the  production of the film.  The trailer for the flick would have also been  nice.  I understand that deleated scenes from Airport 77 do exist.  In  fact, they were added to the movie for TV broadcast.  Sadly, they were also  not included.  At least, the movie is presented in wide screen so that the  full sweep of this fun little epic is preserved intact.  If you like  disaster movies, seek out this little gem.  It is not the greatest movie of  all time, but it is one of the best examples of the genre.

779570,5,6304108842,"This is my favourite on the AIRPORT series(the second best being the CONCORDE - AIRPORT 79 for its sheer hilariousness - although look what happened outside Paris in the news today!) with some rather impressive  special effects for its time. The plot revolves around an art billionaire  Philip Stevens, played by JAMES STEWART, who invites an assortment of  characters on to his private 747, piloted by JACK LEMMON. Lo and behold,  his co-pilot(ROBERT FOXWORTH, who was also in THE PROPHECY and OMEN 2) has  masterminded a hijacking, which goes horribly wrong when the plane hits an  oil rig, ditches into the sea and settles underwater! Somehow the fuselage  remains intact - who will survive!  We can surely guess the outcome. Also  there's a vet treating human injuries - this was done a year earlier for  spoof value in Paramount's disaster movie send-up THE BIG BUS! Dear me! But  this is a great piece of 1970s vintage cheese which will be enjoyed by all.  The effects and underwater photography during the submarine-style rescue  attempt are still superb, the plane interior sets are quite realistic for  this type of movie and the cast of stars, as well as LEMMON and STEWART you  get JOSEPH COTTEN, Dynasty's PAMELA BELLWOOD, Buck Rogers star GIL GERARD,  LEE GRANT, OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND and once again GEORGE KENNEDY as Joe  Patroni, liasing with the US Navy(some great military action here as well!)  with the rescue attempt.

An enjoyable piece of nonsense to wile away a couple of  hours.

7861520,3,6304108842,"I wasn't even alive when this hit movie theatres, or even on video, but I've recently seen the first two, so thought I'd check out the third.  This scenario, a plane on the bottom of the ocean full of passengers actually looked more interesting a plot that the other two.  So I decided to give this one a go.  It's obviously very apparent we're in the past, people smoke in airports/on plane, security barely exists at the airport, and everyone is dressed up to fly.  Obviously the audience in 1977 probably didn't fly a lot, and the wonder of a new technologically advanced plane where you have a heap of room to walk around inside, and can have poker chips stacked on your table, and heavy alcohol filled glass (made of glass) on tables that don't tip, fall on the floor and smash into seats when the plane takes off, might have been believed.

Spoilers follow - For modern day audiences we've seen too many reports and footage of actual plane crashes into the ocean to buy the premise that this plane going 600 miles an hour (according to crime gang pilot) would stay completely intact when it hit the ocean.  Even a smaller plane on New York's Hudson that managed to do so, we know how much luck and skill was involved in that and it was being slowed down and positioned right for impact by a whole crew.  But letting that slide for being made in the 70's there still a lot that makes rescue seem too easy.  There's no damage bringing water except a few drips into the plane, the air is normal down there (but crucially for the plot will run out if they can't work out how to get out or are rescued).  Even though the plane was off radar (you'd think the oil rig personnel would have mentioned the wing clipping them to authorities) it was found way too easy.  Spotting one small life raft is extremely difficult for slower aircraft, yet fast moving planes can see a guy in the middle of the ocean no problems.  Likewise even though the sea is fairly choppy, they can easily see the plane on the ocean floor.  Why did the plane have a life raft that fits just one person on it?  Not to mention it takes no time at all for ships, helicopters and everything to get there.  I was waiting for Bruce from Jaws to make an appearance to make the rescue a bit more exciting. I was also reminded of the Poseidon Adventure for a lot of the film.  Also that maybe this is what happened to that missing Malaysian Airlines flight?

It's worth watching just for the entertainment value of how unrealistic is this factor as you're watching. It's extremely easy to knock someone out for ages with a blow to the back of the hand with your hand or the back of a gun. You could start a drinking game with how often this is done.  Some of the characters are simply annoying.  Such as the old woman who is blackmailing a younger guy she's involved in some cougar action with and letting on will cost him his job.  She just treats her husband like dirt.  I was waiting for some satisfaction for her to die, but movie writers hadn't worked out we like to see these sorts of characters get their comeuppance before the movie is over back in those days I guess.",1514678400,,3140,4.353344768439108
