It has a lot of shocking information about the persecution of Falun Gong, including the organ harvesting that the CCP has been doing.  Falun Gong is a peaceful, ancient Chinese self-cultivation practice based on the principles of ""Truth, Compassion and Tolerance.""  100 million people in China are being brutally persecuted since 1999, for their belief in this practice. [...]  Thousands have been tortured to death.  [...] The Documentary explores why the media is paying so little attention to this genocide.  My only problem with it is that a couple of statements made about Falun Gong were false or exaggerated.  A NY times reporter, although he was trying to be supportive of Falun Gong, made some exaggerated statements about the content of Zhaun Falun.  He says that Zhaun Falun is ""teeming"" with references to ""aliens"".  As far as I know there are only one or two references to life on other planets.  Here's the whole paragraph.

""The same is true with human molecular cells. People ask how big the universe is. Let me tell you that this universe also has its boundary. Even at the level of Tathagata, however, one will regard it as boundless and infinitely immense. Yet the human body's inside is as big as this universe, from molecules to microscopic particles at the microscopic level. This may sound very inconceivable. When a human being or a life is created, his unique life elements and essential quality are already composed at the extremely microscopic level. Thus, in studying this subject, our modern science lags far behind. In comparison with those lives of higher wisdom on the planets throughout the entire universe, our human race's scientific level is quite low. We cannot even reach other dimensions that exist simultaneously in the same place, while flying saucers from other planets can travel directly in other dimensions. The concept of that time-space is completely different. Thus, they can come and go at will and at a speed so fast that the human mind cannot accept it.""

Other then the NY times exaggeration, the documentary is very good and definitively  worth watching!",1245974400,,2185,4.986225895316805
8205134,5,B000SDT956,"This is a very courageous video. When people talk about China, very often they talk about money, growth, etc, and find certain excuse to turn a blind eye to human rights and persecution. Someone has to start the wake up call to face what's really happening in China. No doubt, this video producer did the job.

Time won't change China, if the world does not do something during the time.",1195603200,3,387,4.5285714285714285
