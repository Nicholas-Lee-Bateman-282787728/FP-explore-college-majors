8662789,1,B00KZ1WBKG,"BUYERS BEWARE!!!!  This is  The version with Seth Herzog, not Richard Hammond! It's hugely disappointing when you go to buy a product and you expect the host that you've been watching & the description of the product does not include this information.",1499817600,2,251,4.9523809523809526
8662790,3,B00KZ1WBKG,Loved the concept.  The narrator is a bit dorky and says things that aren't really appropriate for kids.,1447372800,2,104,4.777777777777778

8662792,1,B00KZ1WBKG,"Was hoping to get the English narrator, Richard Hammond.  Instead, I got a boring American narrator that really detracts from the show.  Wrote to NatGeo and was told the version I wanted was not available.  Paid a hefty price for the version I really do not want to see.
If the Richard Hammond versions ever comes out on DVD, I will definitely buy it.",1437609600,11,351,4.453125

8662794,3,B00KZ1WBKG,This show idea had the potential for greatness. They have three guys watch and review some of those crazy fails on You Tube then explain the science of why it was a fail.,1422576000,2,170,4.181818181818182
