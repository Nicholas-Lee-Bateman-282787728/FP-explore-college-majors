It had that film noir quality.

And the music was very good for each scene.

A very strange movie normally not what I would watch but it was good.",1486425600,,232,4.348837209302325
8404129,3,B003SAKYY6,"Set in the backstreets of Paris, Todd Verow's The Final Girl is a French mystery that intertwines the lives of three women with that of a fourth who is missing.

The film begins with Wendy Delorme as a tattoo covered young stripper looking for a room to rent. Judy Minx is seductive as the temptress roommate who makes it clear that in the absence of a security deposit, she would accept sexual favours. This is portrayed through a graphic S&M tinted sex scene filmed raw with an almost voyeuristic feel.

The missing girl, Leena has made a hasty departure either by jumping, falling or being pushed off the roof. Her diary, read voraciously by the stripper, reveals the missing girl's character incrementally. Brenda Velez brings Leena to life in gritty, dreamlike, black and white; almost documentary style.

Veronique Lindeberg brings vulnerability and yearning to the role of Leena's ex-lover. She describes Leena as a chameleon, lying to get what she wants or needs but not allowing anyone to know the ""real"" Leena.

Pascale Ourbih portrays a timid but needy woman who offers the stripper 100 euros for sex but, only wants to watch as she pleasures herself. This too is brought to the screen in raw close-up footage; it is hard not to feel a bit sorry for the stripper who seems to stumble into situations where sex and love have no intersection.

As the film moves forward building layer upon layer, the mystery of who Leena is and where she has gone twists tighter.

8404131,2,B003SAKYY6,The story line is forced and the movie is hardly about what it claims to be. Cant say say i was 100% disapointed because i was intrigued by some parts of it. The lead is an interesting actress just wish she had more of a plot to play with.,1294617600,5,239,3.8979591836734695
