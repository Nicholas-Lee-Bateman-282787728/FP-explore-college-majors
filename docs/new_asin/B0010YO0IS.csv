3055565,5,B0010YO0IS,"In order to recompense for wicked deeds of the past, the descendants of Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, and the Wolf Man have become modern-day, teenage superheroes under the guidance of Count Dracula. When the evil Dr. Dred embarks on another dastardly plan, the seemingly ordinary trio of teenagers come together for a hi-five and shout, ""Whack-O,"" to transform into their monster counterparts. Together, they thwart Dred and his minions at every turn, though often it takes a while to get the upper hand.

I was around 5 in 1980, yet this Saturday morning show is something I have never forgotten. It was a HUGE influence on me, and Howie the werewolf was my personal role-model, even if Drak Jr. was the leader of the Drak Pack. It's been since I was a small child that I've seen any of this show, which was such an influence that my own comic has a werewolf in the lead role, and I was both excited and nervous when I finally got hold of this complete series DVD release. All 16 episodes are her on this three-disc set. The front cover art makes you wonder if it is a legitimate release, yet the disc art and back definitely put your mind at ease. I haven't seen such lovely disc labels in some time. Of course, the main concern here is the show itself, and I'm happy to say that, while at first it appears to be a far too simple, small-kid aimed program, the more you watch it and the closer you pay attention to it, the more you enjoy it. It's actually really witty and all its silliness is intentional. This is really a great show that, as it turns out, holds up pretty well. The characters are funny and fun, as are their designs, and the plots are the goofiest ever, but that just makes them so much funnier. Add to that the great Hans Conried as the voice of Dr. Dred! What more could you ask for?

There are no bonus features, but all the episodes look and sound great for a show of this age, except for maybe one that has the dialogue audio too low compared to the music and sound effects. The back of the DVD case makes note of  this by stating, ""These DVDs contain technical anomalies inherited in historical footage.""

They're all here in this great set! Now, if only we could get a release like this for Teen Wolf the animated series here in the U.S., I'd be content (or at least as content as I can be with Disney sitting on all their great 80's and 90's shows...).",1338854400,11,2822,4.459302325581396

3055567,3,B0010YO0IS,"Here's a mostly-forgotten bit of monster fun from Hanna Barbera, circa 1980.  The Drak Pack centers on three teenage descendants of the legendary Dracula, Wolfman, and the Frankenstein monster.  Instead of perpetuating the monsterous mythos of their ancestors, these guys are trying to do some good.  Leading the pack is the ""Big D"" himself.  Their comically-inept adversaries comprise the group O.G.R.E. (Organization for Generally Rotten Enterprises).

Mix Scooby Doo and The Groovie Goolies and, well, you'd probably still come up with something a bit more fun and engaging than The Drak Pack.  Still, it's good clean fun, especially for monster fans.  As is typical of HB animated releases, the video and audio presentation are more than adequate, if unremarkable.  There are no special features in the 3-disc set.

3055568,4,B0010YO0IS,"The other day I was browsing Amazon.com for that one ""extra"" item that would put me over the top and get me ""free"" shipping when what do my wondrous eyes see... why the ""Drak Pack"", of course!

I hadn't seen this sweet little cartoon in ions, but the minute I saw a photo of the main characters, I knew I had to see if the show was on YouTube.com to verify that it was indeed the same show I remembered watching as a child.

And sure enough, it was!

So, being the Halloween film fanatic that I am... I ordered it!

It's an 80s cartoon about three teenage boys who team up to rid the world of evil doers and monsters. And since they are descendants of Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, and a werewolf, they have the ability to transform into their ancestral counterparts; thus giving them a secret identity.

The teens live in a somewhat haunted mansion by day, and a bat lair with high tech gadgets by night, or anytime they need to call upon their superpowers. One of the boys is known as Drak; Drak can change into a vampire, a bat, or a patch of fog. The biggest boy is Frankie; and he can use brute force thanks to his strength. The smallest boy is Howler; Howler can use his lungs and breath to create strong winds.

They also even have a multi-functioning car named Drakster. The Drakster can help them travel by land, by air, or by sea... all with the turn of a dial.

In some ways the cartoon reminds me of Scooby Doo meets the Monster Squad. It's a simple, entertaining cartoon for kids of all ages. And there's absolutely nothing scary about it. It's just pure fun.",1322352000,23,1575,4.336734693877551

 I only gave it Four out of Five Stars because there is no Director's history behind the scenes with some interviews with some of the voice actors/actresses. (Keeping in mind, they did not advertise this as part of the set, but is always a nice bonus to hope for.)

3055581,4,B0010YO0IS,"I am a big fan of Hanna Barbera. And so when I saw this set available I ordered it.

I am unsure what other Saturday Morning cartoons it was up against originally, but I think I watched a cartoon on a different channel instead of this one. (Back in the days before On-Demand, DVRs and wide usage of VCRs for taping shows so you were limited to watching shows on only one channel at a time.) It is not totally unfamiliar, but I don't remember it as vividly as the Super Friends or Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends.

The show pits 3 Henshin Heroes(need to transform to have powers), who are inspired by the classic Universal Monsters of Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolfman, against more classic monsters.

The leader of the villains is Dr. Dread who is a cross between Vincent Price, Dick Dastardly and Liberace. Helping Dr. Dread is the Mummyman, a mummy larger than Frankie, Toad, a cross between Igor and the X-Men's Toad with a Peter Lorre voice, Fly, a small goggle-wear version of the character from the Vincent Price movie, and Vampira.

 Dr. Dread and his team come up with completely ridiculous plots to take over the world or whatever, that the Drak Pack must foil. All of the characters take everything more or less seriously, but the storylines get a bit silly.

The similarly themed Monster Force from Universal approx. 15 years later is a more serious take on the subject, though that series only got a 7 episode DVD, instead of the complete 13.

The DVD release is pretty basic. The DVD has 2 menus. The First is a Play All or Episode List, the second is the episode list. The packaging does not contain an episode list.

It is a silly show, and there is little chance of blowing through all 16 episodes in one marathon viewing, but it is fun and probably won't be available for very long. It is better to get it now for $20 than pay 10 times that later.",1426118400,2,2597,4.623913043478261

I remember this show and didn't even know it was out on DVD. According to IMDB only 7 episodes were made at 30Min each. As a collector of all things horror, I thought I might buy this until I saw the price. $52.99 for a series that obviously didn't go over and only 7 episode content. Shouldn't this be more like $10-$15 range? Even if this set is out of print it's still a crazy amount for what you get and its DVD not Blu.

3055594,5,B0010YO0IS,"""Drak Pack"" originally ran on CBS from 1980 to 1981 and produced by Hanna-Barbera Pty. Ltd (Australia).

The Canadian DVD company VEI released this series and ""Dinky Dog"" which was part of the ""All New Popeye Hour"" and was also animated by Hanna-Barbera's Australian studio (later re-named Southern Star Productions) but with US voice actors and US post-production staff (Hoyt Curtin's theme music, sound effects).  It seems Time-Warner owns Hanna-Barbera's shows animated in the US for dvd release and VEI has the rights for H-B's Australian studio output.  The animated ""Teen Wolf"", 1980s ""Berenstain Bears"", and ""Cbs Storybreak"" were also Southern Star productions not  yet released on DVD.  Hanna-Barbera's ""Popeye"" cartoons are owned by Kings Features Syndicate and a few of those cartoons were released by another DVD company.

The cartoons were amusing.  Scheming Dr. Dred, played by Captain Hook and Snidely Whiplash's voice Hans Conreid, and his band of evil monsters Toad, Fly, Mummy Man, and Vampira formed the Organization of Generally Rotten Enterprises (O.G.R.E.) and plotted various nefarious schemes.  The good guys, Drak Jr., Frankie, and Howler would band together to use their various powers (Drak can shape-shift and turn into a bat, Frankie had super strength when angered, and Howler can huff and puff and exhale with tremendous force) to battle OGRE under the watchful eye of cantankerous fussy Count Dracula.  Too bad, there was never a female member on Drak Jr.'s good monster team, though.

Some good storylines and dialogue, especially Dr. Dred's insults toward the Drak Pack and his own OGRE minions.  Nice to see the show on DVD since my local CBS station in San Francisco did not air the program...opting to carry a locally produced kids show in the time slot.",1390780800,2,1790,5.180555555555555

They also even have a multi-functioning car named Drakster. The Drakster can help them travel by land, by air, or by sea... all with the turn of a dial.

In some ways the cartoon reminds me of Scooby Doo meets the Monster Squad. It's a simple, entertaining cartoon for kids of all ages. And there's absolutely nothing scary about it. It's just pure fun.",1322352000,23,1575,4.336734693877551

 I only gave it Four out of Five Stars because there is no Director's history behind the scenes with some interviews with some of the voice actors/actresses. (Keeping in mind, they did not advertise this as part of the set, but is always a nice bonus to hope for.)

This series showed great imagination for this time and Kids young and old will probably enjoy the ride.",1434585600,,642,4.378151260504202

3290078,4,B0010YO0IS,"I am a big fan of Hanna Barbera. And so when I saw this set available I ordered it.

I am unsure what other Saturday Morning cartoons it was up against originally, but I think I watched a cartoon on a different channel instead of this one. (Back in the days before On-Demand, DVRs and wide usage of VCRs for taping shows so you were limited to watching shows on only one channel at a time.) It is not totally unfamiliar, but I don't remember it as vividly as the Super Friends or Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends.

The show pits 3 Henshin Heroes(need to transform to have powers), who are inspired by the classic Universal Monsters of Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolfman, against more classic monsters.

The leader of the villains is Dr. Dread who is a cross between Vincent Price, Dick Dastardly and Liberace. Helping Dr. Dread is the Mummyman, a mummy larger than Frankie, Toad, a cross between Igor and the X-Men's Toad with a Peter Lorre voice, Fly, a small goggle-wear version of the character from the Vincent Price movie, and Vampira.

 Dr. Dread and his team come up with completely ridiculous plots to take over the world or whatever, that the Drak Pack must foil. All of the characters take everything more or less seriously, but the storylines get a bit silly.

The similarly themed Monster Force from Universal approx. 15 years later is a more serious take on the subject, though that series only got a 7 episode DVD, instead of the complete 13.

The DVD release is pretty basic. The DVD has 2 menus. The First is a Play All or Episode List, the second is the episode list. The packaging does not contain an episode list.

It is a silly show, and there is little chance of blowing through all 16 episodes in one marathon viewing, but it is fun and probably won't be available for very long. It is better to get it now for $20 than pay 10 times that later.",1426118400,2,2597,4.623913043478261

I remember this show and didn't even know it was out on DVD. According to IMDB only 7 episodes were made at 30Min each. As a collector of all things horror, I thought I might buy this until I saw the price. $52.99 for a series that obviously didn't go over and only 7 episode content. Shouldn't this be more like $10-$15 range? Even if this set is out of print it's still a crazy amount for what you get and its DVD not Blu. I respect my wallet and hard earned cash enough to take a back seat on these genre shows and items that have crazy prices associated with them.",1412380800,,608,4.033057851239669

3290091,5,B0010YO0IS,"""Drak Pack"" originally ran on CBS from 1980 to 1981 and produced by Hanna-Barbera Pty. Ltd (Australia).

The Canadian DVD company VEI released this series and ""Dinky Dog"" which was part of the ""All New Popeye Hour"" and was also animated by Hanna-Barbera's Australian studio (later re-named Southern Star Productions) but with US voice actors and US post-production staff (Hoyt Curtin's theme music, sound effects).  It seems Time-Warner owns Hanna-Barbera's shows animated in the US for dvd release and VEI has the rights for H-B's Australian studio output.  The animated ""Teen Wolf"", 1980s ""Berenstain Bears"", and ""Cbs Storybreak"" were also Southern Star productions not  yet released on DVD.  Hanna-Barbera's ""Popeye"" cartoons are owned by Kings Features Syndicate and a few of those cartoons were released by another DVD company.

The cartoons were amusing.  Scheming Dr. Dred, played by Captain Hook and Snidely Whiplash's voice Hans Conreid, and his band of evil monsters Toad, Fly, Mummy Man, and Vampira formed the Organization of Generally Rotten Enterprises (O.G.R.E.) and plotted various nefarious schemes.  The good guys, Drak Jr., Frankie, and Howler would band together to use their various powers (Drak can shape-shift and turn into a bat, Frankie had super strength when angered, and Howler can huff and puff and exhale with tremendous force) to battle OGRE under the watchful eye of cantankerous fussy Count Dracula.  Too bad, there was never a female member on Drak Jr.'s good monster team, though.

Some good storylines and dialogue, especially Dr. Dred's insults toward the Drak Pack and his own OGRE minions.  Nice to see the show on DVD since my local CBS station in San Francisco did not air the program...opting to carry a locally produced kids show in the time slot.",1390780800,2,1790,5.180555555555555
