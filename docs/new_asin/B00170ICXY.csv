8264386,4,B00170ICXY,I know a good quality print is probably not available and that's so sad--this show was pretty good for a print from old fifties tv.,1412121600,,131,4.28
8264387,3,B00170ICXY,"If you think in show advertising is something new, check out ""Martin Kane Private Eye."" Presented by pipe tobacco manufactured by the US Tobacco Company, they weren't content to just have ads at the beginning and during the breaks. They actually incorporate the pipe tobacco into the program. Martin Kane is a pipe-smoker, and he frequents a tobacco store throughout the shows to stock up on his favorite US Tobacco pipe brands.

The show itself is typical early fifties, with organ music providing the soundtrack, the sets simplistic in their design. Marty proves to be adept at solving crimes, and many of the characters are quire interesting. I recommend this show primarily because it gives a glimpse into television in the early fifties.",1361836800,,742,5.032520325203252
