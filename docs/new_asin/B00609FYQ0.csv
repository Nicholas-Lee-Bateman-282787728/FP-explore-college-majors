8490214,5,B00609FYQ0,"This 1970's Nixon era look at the average working American and the bigoted views, but inherently a good heart is totally topical in the Trump era. Archie Bunker is the central character who is racially biased, conservatively bibolatrous, somewhat ignorant supported by his wife Edith (things are not always as they seem), daughter Gloria and son-in-law 'Meathead', college student and pinko liberal. Suddenly, this forgotten America has resurfaced...
