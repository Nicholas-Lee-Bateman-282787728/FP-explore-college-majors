2546223,5,B000EXZFHG,Great product; brand new condition and arrived on time. Watching the man play the bass is truly inspirational. A must have for all bassists or even guitarists.,1156032000,,159,4.925925925925926
2546224,5,B000EXZFHG,"I like the segment where John admits that his little finger is used just for show. John honestly demonstrates his style of playing. He says that he would be bored to just play the bass in the standard way; he needs to solo to completely express himself . John had a easy going side to his personality, and he carefully answers questions. Some things can't be explained in words, but John does a great job at it. He turns his treble and volume to full and lets the chips fall where they may. This is a great DVD to watch over and over; I plan to watch it many times. Thanks John for taking the time to show us your style.",1155686400,17,620,4.132231404958677
2546225,5,B000EXZFHG,"John Entwistle demonstrates bass solo and rhythmic techniques by himself, and then jams with lead guitarist Arlen Roth, who questions The Ox further on his approach to bass. This gives viewers the chance to focus on Entwistle's bass playing without having to strain to hear it through the deluge (as John described it) of The Who's power chords, drum assaults and slinky synthesizers. Entwistle emerges as an unselfish innovator who was willing to share his skills with others. His deadpan wit quietly perks up the proceedings as well.",1154304000,17,535,5.090909090909091

But how come there aren't any reviews yet for this DVD, which has been out for more than a week now??

8115740,4,B000EXZFHG,"Get DVD of John playing, but the guitar player who was doing the interview was not very good in the questions ask or in his ability to play.",1457654400,,140,4.035714285714286
8115741,3,B000EXZFHG,"Let's get this out of the way first: John is one of the three greatest influences on my playing (Macca and Carol Kaye being the others). Having said that, this is a pretty bad DVD unless your goal is just to watch John jam hot bass licks for an hour. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but the DVD does promote itself as a ""Master Class"", which to me suggests an instructional component that simply isn't present.",1455494400,,421,4.410256410256411
8115742,5,B000EXZFHG,"John Entwistle: Bass Guitar Master Class  John was the Bass master, even if you do not play, understanding how he did what he did and seeing it done is priceless!",1377907200,,162,4.4
8115743,1,B000EXZFHG,"John Entwistle may have written some great bass lines in the songs that he played on with The Who, but I have little confidence in his overall ability as a musician/teacher. I watched this DVD and I'm sure a paycheck was the motivation to do this and I feel like Mr. Entwistle could care less about teaching anybody anything. In fact I'm pretty sure he doesn't even know what he is doing. As he babbles on about his anti-technique and tries to give examples on the bass, everything is done with a distortion setting that never gets turned off.....EVER. The whole pointless DVD is a buzzy incoherent mess. I was so angry with this supposed instructional video that it did motivate me to play the bass better than I had been before. If a ""Bass God"" with musical blinders on can write awesome bass lines, anybody can. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",1262908800,2,834,4.529801324503311
8115744,2,B000EXZFHG,"I have been playing bass for over 30 years and I have always admired John Entwistle's bass playing. Although I never studied his style (or anyone else's for that matter) I have been told I play a lot like him. After watching this DVD, I can see why these people had come to this conclusion as I use a lot of the same techniques John discovered. I learned to play bass by listening to the songs I wanted to learn and I never learned to read music.

I picked this DVD up to see if I could learn a trick or two and get some kind of insight on this musical genius's playing style. Well, you're not going to learn much from this DVD, unless you're just starting out and then watching this might discourage you! It's basically John noodling around for a half hour or so not really showing more than finger positions etc. I would also like to point out that his bass tone sounds terrible and distorted to the point that it isn't enjoyable. It would have been nice if we could see both hands when he is playing as it make it even harder to learn anything while watching either hand. It's interesting to watch a couple of times, but not anything you need to own. John Entwistle was one of the greatest bassist of all time, it's a shame we will never get a true insight to his incredible talent.",1206316800,8,1285,4.244897959183674
8115745,1,B000EXZFHG,Save your money unless you want to watch a bored Entwhistle go through the motions demonstrating his eccentric style.,1201651200,4,117,5.2105263157894735
8115746,1,B000EXZFHG,"How disappointed I was to watch this wasted effort. So much more could have been done to actually give some insight into Entwistles playing that was just frittered away with what is basically an interview and some rambling licks that do nothing to really give us any true insight into the thinking behind the playing.

Where is the instruction? It isn't here. Sadly, now, we can't rectify this because John is no longer living to make a truly worthwhile instructional video.

Pass to the other side of the road on this one.",1201564800,13,523,4.673913043478261
8115747,5,B000EXZFHG,"Not so great as a beginning lesson, but outstanding for Entwhistle fans. It's a fascinating inside look by the master himself. It was made during the ""slap"" craze and he reminds us that there are alternatives to slapping, which is kind of interesting historically as well. This DVD is useful, interesting and collectable. Better buy it if you like Entwhistle.

It was transfered from video, so it ain't high-def.

Highly recommended for Entwhistle fans, beginners should find a primer instead.",1201046400,4,493,5.15
8115748,4,B000EXZFHG,"and I found this DVD interesting.  There are insights about how he played that I, as a fan of his playing, which you must be if you're bothering to read this, found enlightnening,  especially regarding his ""country western"" influence.  (HA! HA! Now you're curiosity is piqued and you HAVE to buy it.  Hey Amazon, do I get a commission?).

I can only imagine how this DVD would benefit someone who does play bass guitar.

8115749,5,B000EXZFHG,"I'd like to say this DVD made all the difference in my playing, but I'd have to be John Entwistle to figure it all out.  The DVD is great because it is an archive of the creative process of a lost musical genius.  Getting past the few practicable tricks, there's some of John's musical philosophies saved for future generations.  I know it sounds silly, but imagine having Hendrix sit down and dissect his playing, or Mozart discuss his thoughts on composition with someone who asks the questions you would.

Its also amazing how video production has changes over the past 20 years.  The picture is good, but you can see the improvements in cameras and tapes.",1156204800,20,659,4.646551724137931
