3161651,1,B0016MJ6GK,"""People here are happy to be separate from a corrupt American government.""  So says the chief bad guy on his walkie talkie, as convincingly as if he were griping about overcooked spaghetti in a cheap restaurant.  ""You have some seriously wounded people there,"" intones the good military guy, in a sleepy monotone.  ""Yeah?  So send in a medic,"" snarls the baddie.

Way beyond unconvincing, descending into a total grade Z snoozefest. If you can sit through this drivel without thinking that you've got something else you'd really like to do, then you might have fallen asleep.  For desparate nothing-else-to-do viewing only.",1271376000,2,623,5.118811881188119

3161654,5,B0016MJ6GK,"Dean Cain, William Forsythe, Tracey Gold, Lea Thompson, Anthony Michael Hall, and Ernie Hudson all in the same movie? How could it get any better? Hopefully the sequel will star Scott Baio, Ricky Schroder, Lark Voorhies, Daphne Zuniga, Harry Anderson, and Carl Weathers. And to top it all off, it's the unrated version.
How come this makes it out but I can't get Howard The Duck on DVD? It stars Lea Thompson too.",1215648000,3,413,4.671232876712328

8263405,4,B0016MJ6GK,"You don't know how this is going to finish.
Cain again puts in a great performance as an Air Marshal
trying stop a terrorist an a plane. Tony Hall's performance adds
to this movies appeal. Another I'd recommend.",1394496000,,211,4.578947368421052

8263407,5,B0016MJ6GK,"Loved this movie, the suspense of the movie kept me on the edge of the seat.  Dean Cain had an excellent role in this movie, and made it very convincing.  The people on the plane working together to try and keep people safe reminded me of the 9/11 attacks, where people took charge to defeat the bad guys.  Movie is a little long, but full of suspense.  I highly recommend this movie.",1306540800,2,384,4.291666666666667
