5170051,5,B008MMONCE,"This 3 disc set is Oscilloscope release #45. Inside is the documentary feature about LCDSSs' final performance at MSG. The movie has whole songs from the concert which emphasize the quieter and meditative tone of the interview segments and over the shoulder next morning footage.  There are extra extended interview segments with James Murphy if you didn't get enough during the movie.  The main feature really is the double disc set of the concert, which features 2.0 stereo and 5.1 mixes both sounding rich and clear.  The near 4 hour show is documented in its entirety including backstage breaks.  While it can be exhausting to sit through everything this set offers, you will find a greater understanding of yourself and the band if you listen close and loud. My speakers were buzzing by the finale and I was fine with it.",1348444800,21,826,4.836879432624113
5170052,5,B008MMONCE,"This movie is just awesome, the images, music, story, it tells a story with deep emotions and thoughts and you don't even feel it, its just amazing how they were able to do this as fun and light. just loved it!",1344643200,2,210,4.146341463414634

5170054,4,B008MMONCE,I love Lcd Soundsystem and this is a really great concert and documentary. The package arrived a day early and was in great condition. The only complaint I have is that i only recieved part one of the concert. Part two is not there. It's just a second part one. Any way i can fix this?,1455408000,,285,4.107142857142857

5170057,5,B008MMONCE,LOVE LCD - and loved the documentary and its delivery of the process James and co. experienced leading up to --- and after -- their final show. What a thoughtful group  of people who really cared about each other - and the music. Never out to make a buck - just out to realize their creative abilities and desires. Who just happened to attract a major following. Curious to see if they decide to get back into the swing of things....,1453680000,,433,4.345679012345679

5170070,3,B008MMONCE,"I liked the music, LCD Soundsystem is a VERY interesting band, but I was a little disappointed by the music.  I had thought that they would read the title of the movie and heed its advise.  A concert movie, with the eclectic musicians would have been more fun that all of the talking about how they felt about their art.  The title of the movie was ""Shut and play the hits"", well in the end they did play the hits and it's always fun to see who is making the indie music that I enjoy.",1443139200,,484,4.073684210526316

This, along with ""the long goodbye"" vinyl box set, is the perfect tribute to one of the greatest musical project from the last 30 years.
The film is beautiful and progresses in a natural way with beautiful sequences. And the whole concert. Oh, the concert. The mixing is precise and neat, and the color correction is beautiful. Plug your Blu-ray to a good sound system and let the bass make you walls shake. It'll change the way you think about live performances.",1438041600,,566,4.451923076923077

5170075,5,B008MMONCE,"The documentary is ok, though I wish I would have been more in depth. I feel like LCD's history would make a compelling movie, but this one sticks to just the end of the band and the final show.
The real goodness here is the concert, which might be my favorite live concert movie of all time. 4 hours of pulsating light and sound and amazing music. Must watch for any LCD Soundsystem fan, or fan of music at all.",1435449600,,412,4.1625

5170078,4,B008MMONCE,This is a great behind-the-scenes look at James Murphy and his incredibly energetic band as they prepare for their final performance at Madison Square Garden.  Why would he dissolve LCD Soundsystem in the very midst of great popularity?  Murphy attempts to answer this in snippets of an interview woven throughout this engaging documentary.,1431302400,,340,5.39622641509434

5170084,5,B008MMONCE,"This is for the Blu-ray version.  It sounds absolutely fantastic. Looks very nice too.  It's a great final concert  - if your going to have a funeral then have a great funeral - and worth every penny for just the 2 Disc concert in HD 5.1.  I could write a lot of crap, blah blah blah but the highest phrase I can give this is to say it gives Stop Making Sense a run for it's money as far as sound goes and might.. just might be a bit better.  It really kicks butt.  So if your a fan of LCD Soundsystem and have the ability to play this  - blu-ray player and decent 5.1 sound system - I highly recommend you check this out.  I consider it essential.... period regardless.  The documentary is just cream.  I haven't stopped listening to the concert yet, I'm on my second pass...I wanted to view the complete concert before I watched the documentary which is parts of the concert.  I NEVER give stuff 5 stars... never but I was pleasantly surprised.  Wow!  Be careful about cranking this up too much, it gets really loud at parts.",1424044800,3,1027,4.259067357512953

5170096,5,B008MMONCE,"I had never heard LCD Soundsystem before I watched this film. This is a riveting documentary of their last performance. Every player contributes. The style is an amalgam of electronica, rap, punk, new wave, etc. James Murphy is an artist. Some similarity to David Byrne but, overall, a unique musician.",1402012800,,302,5.06

5170105,5,B008MMONCE,An emotional roller coaster journeying through the last performance of James Murphy and LCD Soundsystem. GREAT MOVIE! A MUST SEE!,1391558400,,129,5.5
5170106,5,B008MMONCE,"I came to this film/set of discs not as a fan of LCD Soundsystem, but as someone wanting to buy a concert film on Blu-Ray (that was not of some new boy band or some has-beens.) This fit the bill in spades. I really enjoy the band and their sound, which seems to be an electronic take on some intersection of soul and punk for grown-ups.

As much as I enjoy Murphy and his band of friends playing like there is no tomorrow, one of the real strengths of this package is simply the quality of the film and the recording. This has a visual clarity that is not present in many bigger budget films and the music has a tactile and immediate quality that exceeds most other CDs. Maybe it has to do with the fact that the audio on the Blu-Ray is a step up from most CDs.

Highly recommended.",1391299200,,782,4.1381578947368425
5170107,5,B008MMONCE,This is such a well made documentary.  I bought this a month ago and have watched it several times already.  I love it!,1390867200,,119,4.130434782608695
5170108,5,B008MMONCE,"""Shut Up"" is an excellent account of LCD's final days as an official band. I wish there was more on the history of the band but it was fascinating to see James behind-the-scenes, how he handles the day after a mega-blowout concert at MSG.  LCD is one of the most important indie bands of the past 15 years. It's worthwhile for any fan of rock/indie rock music.",1390867200,,360,4.373134328358209
5170109,4,B008MMONCE,I enjoyed some of the behind the scenes stuff. And the concert footage was great.  A must watch for and LCD soundsystem fans,1390348800,,124,4.391304347826087
5170110,5,B008MMONCE,James you are a king among men. Thank you for the years I have and will enjoy your music. Enjoy your next adventure as when you live it right it only gets better. Loved the soft cell closer. My best!,1390262400,,199,4.0
5170111,5,B008MMONCE,Really great glimpse into the last concert of an awesome band. The only bad part is you'll wish they never stopped making music!,1389830400,,128,4.608695652173913
5170112,2,B008MMONCE,"I had never heard of the music group portrayed in this movie and that's why I watched it.  Music much like food is a personal taste and preference. Their music was enjoyable, nothing to write home about but as a movie it was bizarre! It's one of those movies that you sit through thinking the whole time that it's going to get better and it doesn't. In this case, it starts off slow and bad and by the end your sound to sleep dreaming you had watched something else.",1389398400,3,466,4.235955056179775
5170113,4,B008MMONCE,Very intriguing situatuation with a group having success and deciding to stop. The story doesn't provide much clarity on the reasons for stopping.  The musical components are very compelling and have allowed me to discover an interesting band that I would not have otherwise been aware of. Worth a watch.,1388793600,,304,5.08
5170114,5,B008MMONCE,"Epic final concert, behind the scenes footage and interesting back story all in one.  Great for anyone who likes their music, and obviously a must watch for fans of LCD Soundsystem.",1388188800,,181,4.838709677419355
5170115,5,B008MMONCE,"I have to admit I had heard a few random songs from the band before watching this doc, but I wouldn't even go so far as to call myself a fan. I was told by a friend that this is worth watching. Now that I've seen it probably 5-8 times, I can't help but kick myself for not listening to the band years earlier. I wish I could go back and see this concert live. Short of that, I'm ecstatic that we have this film to rewatch for eternity.

The concert footage is incredible, and the interviews and footage between songs is really fascinating. It's not overdone. A perfect balance between the two. It's really a unique story, of a band choosing to go out on top.

We get to gaze into Murphy's thought process and get front row tickets to one of the best MSG concerts in recent memory. You really should buy this!",1386806400,5,808,4.2064516129032254
5170116,5,B008MMONCE,"You get 3 disks of content with this blu-ray. 1 disk is just the awesome documentary, the other 2 disks are the THREE AND A HALF HOUR LONG final show in Madison Square Garden. A must have for any LCD fan, or just any fan of quality music in general.",1383004800,,249,4.0

5170118,5,B008MMONCE,"I wish I could have been there, at Madison Square Garden! But this was a cool look inside LCD's final shows for those of us who couldn't go. Even for those who got tickets, this movie showed things even they hadn't seen!",1382918400,,220,4.261904761904762
5170119,5,B008MMONCE,No need for a long review here. Simply an amazing performance by a solid band. Not many out there making music of this caliber in my opinion. Would have loved to have been there but the DVD is great substitute. One of the better Live performance DVDs I have seen.,1379894400,,263,4.28
5170120,5,B008MMONCE,I found this documentary to be very entertaining. James Murphy is a cool guy and has a pretty interesting insight. I also liked that when songs by LCD started they usually completed the entire song on the DVD.,1377734400,,209,4.526315789473684
5170121,4,B008MMONCE,"But I love behind the scenes music movies. I couldn't understand the leader's motivation for disbanding-but I think that was kind of the point. He didn't understand, either. I liked that it showed the tightness of the friendships, in short little clips. And how sad it was to leave it all behind. The musical performances were excellent and great fun, but none of it was was compelling enough that I would watch it again.",1377561600,,421,4.702702702702703

5170124,1,B008MMONCE,I've had never heard of this band and now I know why. What's the appeal? I don't like their music.,1376179200,,98,3.95
5170125,5,B008MMONCE,"I had never heard of LCD Soundsystem before late one night, bored and with nothing to watch, I was flipping through the Netflix instant suggestions and came across this film. I figured I'd give it a shot and though the first two minutes had me questioning my choice, I stuck with it and am so glad that I did. I watched the film all the way through and found myself sofa dancing without even realizing it. I was in love with the music. But not just the music, the story of the man too. Heartbreaking at times and uplifting at others, this film was done so well. In this one film I learned (albeit very limited) about the band itself, the man who created it, and a little bit about why he decided to end it. The mixture of storytelling with actual concert footage is what makes it. Being able to see dance music performed live on stage, and all the complexity and talent that goes into it, was mind blowing. It isn't someone standing on an empty stage with turntables and dials bobbing his head while you hear complex orchestrated music playing, not sure how or when it was actually created. No, it's a group of happy and talented folks right there in front of you strumming every string, hitting every cow bell, hitting every snare, playing ever key, and booping every beep-blop! And they look so happy and euphoric doing it! It's spellbinding.

So after I finished on Netflix I jumped here to Amazon to see about picking up the film to own. I was so happy to find that the blu-ray edition actually includes the full 3.5 hour final concert which the documentary is in service of. Incredible. The concert itself takes up two of the three discs in the set, leaving the documentary and some extra features on the third. The packaging is also very well done and includes a really touching and spot-on essay printed on one of the flaps. This is a fantastic package and it has made a fan of LCD Soundsystem out of me. Too bad I'm so late to the party.

I can only think of two negatives for this set. First, at least for me on my system, the concert discs seem out of sync. The video is slightly slower than the audio. I don't have this problem with any other blu-rays on this setup so i don't think it's a system lag issue. That's with the 5.1 mix, btw. The stereo mix I had better luck with, it seems closer, but it's still just a bit off. My second negative would be that while there are subtitles on the documentary which include the concert footage (so you can see the lyrics to the songs being performed) the concert itself does not have subtitles. My wife is hard of hearing and while she would really love to watch the entire concert (like me this is her first experience with the band and was equally impressed) she can't. And even though my hearing is fine, it would be nice as a new fan, to be able to see the lyrics to these songs since occasionally (by design) Murphy's vocals are hard to make out over the music or distortion. This may not be an issue for most people, but if it could be done for the concert footage in the documentary, i would think it could have been done for the concert too.",1376092800,,3103,4.329896907216495
5170126,1,B008MMONCE,A very annoying collection of loud unpleasant noise. From start to finish you need hearing protection and a good fast forward.,1375747200,,126,5.0476190476190474

Well, except that all the players were fully aware that it was the end of LCD Soundsystem beforehand...
It's funny and sad- a funeral and rousing wake for James Murphy's incredible band and the reality and finality of the end of its run shot on the day after. I hope that at some point he takes up the LCD mantle again but until then it sure was cool for him to film this and release it for us to watch over and over.

Say what you will about the documentary (I thought it was lovely). The concert accompanying the doc is where your time is best spent. It wasn't three hours of crying with a few singles thrown in between the hugs. Genuine emotion was delivered. This band didn't have to be dragged off of the stage. This band went out screaming.  If you want the best 5 hours you will ever have with one music purchase, then buy this concert. From my personal favorite ""Dance Yrself Clean"" to... well, I won't ruin in but you can probably guess... this concert explores the career of one of the most revolutionary bands of this century, not through neat facts and anecdotes, through the music.

5170158,5,B008MMONCE,"I've been interested in electronica music  and the Amazon computer suggests a lot of things that it thinks I might like. About five years ago it suggested a CD by LCD Soundsystem titled ""Sound of Silver."" I took the suggestion seriously because I'd read a review in ""Rolling Stone"" and I'd already decided that this would probably be a disc I'd enjoy. I bought and I indeed liked it very much and followed up later by also purchasing (and reviewing) ""This is Happening"" and ""London Sessions."" This was just a very good band and I loved their music and  James Murphy was a terrific singer! Excellent recordings!

Well, LCD Soundsystem quickly and easily worked it's way into my list of a half-dozen favorite musical acts (including deadmau5, Daft Punk and Matthew Dear) that were the highest on my playlist. Then the notice came out that they were shutting the band down. Quitting? How can this be? This is one of the freshest and best bands around and they're quitting right as they reach their peak? Say it isn't so! Well, unfortunately, it was so and they gave a final concert at Madison Square Garden (a very large boxing arena) to a near-capacity crowd last April in New York City. The 3 1/2-hour concert is now available on DVD. Well, if you're a LCD fan this package is a must-have! They call it ""Shut Up And Play The Hits"" and it makes for an outstanding three-disc DVD package. The first DVD presents selections (highlights) from the concert together with assorted scenes and interviews with James Murphy and other band members. It's quite an interesting and well-done DVD. Be sure to look over all the extras. The second and third DVDs present the entire concert. The total package is just overwhelming and is probably the best concert DVD set I own (out of about 25). It's a wonderful addition to my collection.

It's a terrific concert presentation, both the short version (disc one) and the long version (discs two and three). The boxing venue turned out to be a surprisingly good setting. The concert was staged toward the center and the cameras were set both to record the activity on the stage and look out over the large audience in all directions. Well Done! The acoustics and sound quality of the recording were rather good for a live concert. I was surprised at the size of the band. There might have been about 15-20 people on stage, including the singers. I was also surprised that an emphasis was placed on actual musical instruments, in that I had the idea from the LCD CDs that the reliance was more on electronic music.

The band was disbursed all over the stage, seemingly almost at random, rather than a set facing the audience as in a more normal concert-hall setting. Most of te band members had a specific setting, particularly those playing large instruments, but James Murphy wandered about the stage and the scattered musicians carrying his microphone, playing with a few instruments now and then and interacting with the audience. In his wanderings, he was then able to face most of the audience from time to time. Nice arrangement.  Murphy put on a terrific performance and demonstrated that he was an excellent multi-instrument musician. He really stood out as a percussionist! Murphy left no doubt that he was the heart and core of the LCD organization. And what a terrific singer he was. Previously, I'd only listened to him on CDs and this guy really put his everything into this concert. All of the other band members were great too and were fun to watch. Evidently there was no dress code at all. Band members were each doing their own thing and you had everything on stage from tank-top undershirts to shorts to some rather formal looking outfits. One fellow looked as if he was in audition for those Sasquatch Jerky commercials you see on TV. Murphy, himself, looked as if his haircut was about a month too old and that, somehow, he had forgotten to shave in the last week, although he was wearing a rather formal jacket (sans tie). No matter. It seemed as if everyone was relaxed and just having a really good time, and the audience responded warmly to it.

The concert was both a joyous and sad experience to watch. The band was obviously having a lot of fun, but as the long concert came down to the final songs you could feel the sadness gradually set in. Very late in the concert, they played New York, I Love You, But You're Getting Me Down. It fit. Most of the songs were newly updated versions of the songs on the ""Sound of Silver"" and ""This Is Happening"" CDs, but there were a few new ones (to me, at least), including one 23-minute-long extravagenza. Then it was over.

What's going to happen here? Murphy and his motley collection of musicians (but quite excellent, I would hasten to add) aren't just going to go away, Will Murphy be reincarnated in some other form? Will the other members of the band regroup and form new bands? Stay tuned.

LCD Soundsystem gave its last live performance at the Madison Square Garden in early April, 2011, in one of those rousing ""last-concert"" sending-offs, not unlike, say, The Band's ""The Last Waltz"" all those years ago. You know it'd only be a matter of time before the entire experience would be released in DVD and/or CD format. Turns out that it's in the DVD format only (without a CD co-release).

""Shut Up and Play the Hits: The Loud Ending of LCD Soundsystem"" (3 DVDs; 290 min.) brings a whole lotta music, and then some. Let me comment on what I know: I saw the movie when it was screened at selected theatres in the country a few months ago (July, 2012), here in Cincinnati at the Contemporary Arts Center, and what a great evening that turned out to be. We get to relive and spend the last 48 hrs. of James Murphy, brainchild behind and singer/songwriter of LCD, leading up to the actual MSG show itself. You may recall that in early, 2011, LCD released a live album called ""London Sessions"", which in all-but-name served as a Greatest Hits Live set. Now that we have this new release, ""Shut Up and Play the Hits"" should carry a tag screaming ""the really, truly, all-inclusive greatest and not-so-greatest hits live"" as the movie has all of the songs of ""London Sessions"" and then some! Beware: if you are concerned that the editing would be too ""MTV-like"" (if MTV would actually play music videos anymore), I had feared the worst, and while there certainly is plenty of angle-changing editing, it is not as bad as I suppose it could've been. As to the sound quality, it is nothing short of pristine. It sounded fantastic at the CAC screening, and yes it was LOUD.

As to the extras (which I have not yet seen), there apparently are a ton of them including a documentary and a bunch of other goodies. I doubt that I will spend much time with them. Amazon is selling this set at a very fan-friendly price, so there is a great bang-for-the-buck from that side as well. I had the good fortune of seeing LCD Soundsystem in concert a number of times over the years, including a memorable set at the 2010 Coachella music fest where the massive crowd was begging the band to just keep playing at the end of their set. As memorable that was, the farewell show at the MSG is something a lil' more special. Last but not least, ""Shut Up and Play the Hits"" is one of the great album titles of all times, dripping with irony (since of course the band didn't have a single ""hit"" ever in the Billboard Hot 100) and reminding me of Roxette's equally memorable greatest hits album, titled ""Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus"", ha! This set of course includes ""You Wanted a Hit"", James Murphy's cry against the music industry that LCD doesn't do ""hits"". All that aside, ""Shut Up and Play the Hits"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED and a must-have for any and all LCD fans!",1348704000,5,2938,4.529190207156309

Ill be honest, I never heard of these guys, and I listened to a LOT of electronic music in the 90s & 00s
So I looked them up on the net and seemed like Id missed out on one of the best bands Id never heard of.
In that sprit I watched Shut Up And Play the Hits. One and a half times. Because I thought I missed something the 1st time, or maybe I was in a poor mood.
But no. This is just straight up awful no matter what label you want to put on it. Ill rephrase that, the band actually seems quite talented in spite of being paid to play loops a few Boss RC1s could handle 90% of. And 2 of the tunes straight up rock.
The lyric content is awful. God awful. Repetitive atonal self-indulgent dreck yelled into a low-fi mic by guy whom I liked less with every painful behind the scenes clip.
