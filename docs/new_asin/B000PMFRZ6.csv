2825339,5,B000PMFRZ6,"......AS Good as the movie..""Last American Virgin"" is a true Rare 80s classic where the story,characters (ALL Actors in this film are great)and SOUNDTRACK are A+..Steve Antin (Brother of pussycat dolls founder)played Kevin and was a true player....
Porkys was riding high at this time and ""Last American Virgin"" didn't get as much political movie industry power behind it like Porkys did but this movie was so much better (in my opinion)..
One of the MANY funniest scenes in the movie was the Character ""GARY"" and the drug store Pharmacist...lol
""The Last American Virgin"" & ""Risky Business"" are KINGS of 80s fun goodtime movies....What happened to the great 80s movie writers???
Especially Boaz Davison!!!!!
Again,,,Great Soundtrack!!!!!",1248220800,7,738,5.370689655172414

2825362,3,B000PMFRZ6,Losin' It sucks.  The Last American Virgin is a remake of an Israeli film and has the most realistic conclusion of any 80's teen romp I've ever seen.  Worth it for TLAV.,1483574400,,169,4.25
2825363,4,B000PMFRZ6,"This is a review of the Last American Virgin, I never watched Losin' It.

So here we have a lost gem, The Last American Virgin.  Overshadowed by the more prolific Fast Times at Ridgemont High, which was released the same year, it can be argued that this one actually started the raunchy 80's teen flicks.  It's a remake of a film called Eskimo Limon, which came out several years before Fast Times, and holds a few similar concepts... (SPOILERS!)

So, we have a loser, who has a much more suave friend.  The loser has a crush on a pretty girl, and she ends up hooking up with the friend, and gets pregnant.  She needs an abortion, and the friend bails on her.  Sound familiar?  TBH, this is the part of the plot that sets Fast Times apart from other raunchy teen flicks, as it grounds it more in reality, and shows the consequence of making a bad choice.  Virgin also uses this plot, but to a much grittier, gut wrenching, heartbreaking end.  And it's predecessor Limon beat Fast times to it by 4 years.

In any case, Fast Times and Virgin are otherwise very different movies, with different themes.  I enjoyed both.  If I had to guess though, most of you have not even heard of The Last American Virgin, and for good reason.  I personally like it, and the end of the film is its highlight, but otherwise, it is mostly about a bunch of kids getting into trouble with their ""downstairs brains"", and not much else.  Funny, and pretty good for a low budget film, but there is a reason you are quoting Fast Times 30+ years later, and have never even heard of The Last American Virgin.

If you like 80;s teen flicks, give this one a chance if you can find it (it's kind of hard to find a copy outside of buying it from amazon).  Otherwise, not sure why you would even be looking into it.",1481932800,5,1782,4.335347432024169

2825398,4,B000PMFRZ6,"As a pair this is four stars.  5 for Last American Virgin, but maybe a 2 or 3 for Losin' It.  But these are on separate DVDs which is nice - many double features cram both movies on one disc and tend to suffer a bit of quality loss.  I think Blu-ray could improve the video quality somewhat for rabid fans (like me) but DVD looks pretty good.

Losin' It is sort of silly and funny, and Tom Cruise sure is young here.  Reminds me a little bit of My Tutor but nowhere near as good and not even close to the amount of nudity or sex (here there's barely any, just some topless dancing once they get to Mexico).  Shelly Long goes down to her underwear but non-nude and (well I can't say more without spoiling it but) not that exciting.

Last American Virgin has that great story and so many funny predicaments they get into... and a considerable amount of sex and full frontal nudity.  And yes some of it is disturbing, but a lot of it is quite sexy (like the ""I'm not on the pill"" ""neither am I"" scene, or the hot chica who takes them on for ""Spanish Lessons"", or even the very brief peek into the girls' shower room before the ""measuring contest"").  I simply can't believe this movie hasn't been released on its own and perhaps even Blu-ray - to me it's as important as Porky's which is awesome to have on Blu-ray!!",1424131200,4,1312,4.216

2825407,5,B000PMFRZ6,"I have to admit that a lot of the movies from the 1980's go either way...either I love them or I'm angry I wasted a portion of my life. Both of these movies were fun, Losin' It with John Stockwell as the star and with Jackie Earle Haley and Tom Cruise as his followers was terrific the guys need to go to Mexico to ""lose it"". fun. By far though my favorite of the 2 is ""the last American virgin"", attractive cast, very well acted, funny when it needed to be and authentic when dealing with the problems of youth.
