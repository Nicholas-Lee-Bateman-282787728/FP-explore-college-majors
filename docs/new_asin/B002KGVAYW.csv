3940436,5,B002KGVAYW,Awesome DVD!  It is truly a family dance party every time it is on.  Our 4 year old and 2 year old have so much fun singing and dancing and pretending like they are at a real concert.... in our living room.  Good for parents AND kids.  You WILL love it!,1289174400,2,253,3.9019607843137254
3940437,4,B002KGVAYW,"We got a great price on this item used and it's in great condition. Seller got it here really fast! This dvd if fantastic! I had it on for my girls in the living room while i was making dinner and found myself dancing to ""pollito chicken""!!! The only reason for 4 stars is ""catch that train"" is one of our favorites and it could have been done a little better on this video.",1281225600,3,374,4.0675675675675675
3940438,5,B002KGVAYW,"As a family we have been listening to Dan Zanes since we caught some of his videos on Disney.  Bottom line is that he makes great music that is not just kids music, but music the whole family can listen to.  This new DVD has many different songs on it including some of the newer ones.  Though I miss his band from the first DVD with Father Goose and Barbara his new band on this DVD is tight.  They are all great musicians making great music for not just my kid but my whole family.  We really like this DVD just like we like all of Dan's Records plus Father Gooses.  Dan Zanes, Jack Johnson, Choo Choo Soul, Baby Loves Jazz....its nice to have music for kids that adults can get into.  This is a great DVD for the whole family to dance to.",1254009600,6,741,4.104166666666667

8371996,5,B002KGVAYW,It's so nice to have a children's video/music that doesn't make your skin ceawl. I'm sure other parents know what I mean. The style of music is enjoyable for kids and parents alike. I want to go to a Dan Zanes show with a washboard and a tambourine and party down with my children..thank you Dan Zanes & Fine Friends for making this mom and dad happy campers. Please come to Chicago?,1450483200,,383,4.333333333333333

8371999,5,B002KGVAYW,We became Dan Zanes fans about 4 years ago when our oldest son was 3. We now have 3 sons and we still LOVE this DVD in particular. Some kids need their blankies; ours need their DZAF. We've been watching it for 2 years--even had to get a second copy. You won't be disappointed--even has some breakdance with Cyclone and a Spanish song that's super fun and creative (Pollito chicken). Enjoy!!,1377302400,,391,4.52112676056338

8372002,5,B002KGVAYW,I love Dan Zanes and this DVD is our favorite thing to watch. My 1 year old daughter loves to dance to the music and so do the adults in the house.,1370217600,,147,3.625
8372003,5,B002KGVAYW,"My four-year-old son and the rest of the family love this DVD. There aren't a lot of things we can watch with our kid that is not a little painful to sit through for us, although we try to show some enthusiasm when he's enjoying some TV.

Even the band looks like they're having a great time!",1364515200,2,292,4.12280701754386
