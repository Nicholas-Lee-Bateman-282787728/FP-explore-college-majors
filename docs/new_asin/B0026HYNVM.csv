8352613,5,B0026HYNVM,"This comedy is how they should be.  Twists and turns throughout.  A comedy how they used to be with not just verbal, but physical humor to laugh at, even if you don't understand Chinese (there are English subtitles).  Besides Sandra Ng, the entire cast is at their best making this a movie worth seeing.
The plot involves Yu Bo, a man waiting for his sister to marry so he can (traditional Chinese families want daughters married first).  His sister Yu Chu, however, has no desire to marry and abhors the very idea of marrying, having written books extolling her single woman status.  Her frustrated brother does woo other women and feels cursed when they get injured.  Solution is he hires the famed love doctor, Dick Cho, who proceeds to romance the at first reluctant Yu Chu.  From then on it's one twist after another, confusion and mistaken identities as romances blossom among the people involved.  My favorite is ""Bucktooth Jane"".  I can't go any further lest I spoil it for anyone.",1355702400,,989,4.7368421052631575
