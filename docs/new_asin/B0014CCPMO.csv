  I bought these sets for the movies from the '30s and '40s. 'Cowboy Classics' and 'Guns of the West' are mostly movies from these two decades. 'Western Classics' has 41 films from later decades.
  Quality of the transfers may be an issue with some people. I was able to buy these movies for about a quarter for each movie. These movies are great for the price. Anyone that isn't too demanding should be thrilled with any of these packs. I'm happy with all of these sets and believe any of them are worth owning.",1254873600,14,1334,4.43265306122449

Both of these packs are very good public domain packs if you enjoy old Western movies and serials. The pace is good in nearly all of the films, and there are quite a few famous stars of the old western movies such as Hoot Gibson, Tex Ritter, Roy Rogers, and even four John Wayne movies from before his big break in ""Stagecoach"" in 1939.  If you go to the parent products of this movie pack you can easily find the names and ratings of all of the movies, so I won't repeat that information here. The breakdown of films by decade is as follows:

1930's - 55
1940's - 39
1950's -  5
1960's -  1

The best movies in the pack are:
Big Boy Rides Again (1935) - Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams
Call the Mesquiteers (1938) - (Three Mesquiteers)
Ghost Town (1936) - Harry Carey
Harmony Trail (1944) - Ken Maynard
One-Eyed Jacks (1961) - Marlon Brando/Karl Malden
The Ranger and the Lady (1940) - Roy Rogers
Riders of the West (1942) - (Rough Riders)
West of the Badlands (""The Border Legion"") (1940) - Roy Rogers
Below the Border (1942) - Buck Jones
Buckskin Frontier (1943) - Richard Dix
Forbidden Trails (1941) - Buck Jones
The Legend of the Lone Ranger (1952) - Clayton Moore
The Range Busters (1940) - Ray Corrigan
Red River Valley (1941) - Roy Rogers
Ridin' Down the Canyon (1942) - Roy Rogers

The oldest films in the pack were made in 1930, and they can be hard to sit through due to the halting nature of dialogue and action in early talkies. However, watching the evolution of the sound western is part of the fun too. You'll also see some unlikely stars for western films such as silent slapstick comedian Al St. John in ""Billy the Kid's Range War"" from 1941 and Lou Gehrig in 1938's Rawhide. If you're a fan of the old western movies that used to be a staple of Saturday TV back in the 50's and 60's, I highly recommend this pack.",1204243200,12,2244,5.117486338797814

Both of these packs are very good public domain packs if you enjoy old Western movies and serials. The pace is good in nearly all of the films, and there are quite a few famous stars of the old western movies such as Hoot Gibson, Tex Ritter, Roy Rogers, and even four John Wayne movies from before his big break in ""Stagecoach"" in 1939.  If you go to the parent products of this movie pack you can easily find the names and ratings of all of the movies, so I won't repeat that information here. The breakdown of films by decade is as follows:

1930's - 55
1940's - 39
1950's -  5
1960's -  1

The best movies in the pack are:
Big Boy Rides Again (1935) - Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams
Call the Mesquiteers (1938) - (Three Mesquiteers)
Ghost Town (1936) - Harry Carey
Harmony Trail (1944) - Ken Maynard
One-Eyed Jacks (1961) - Marlon Brando/Karl Malden
The Ranger and the Lady (1940) - Roy Rogers
Riders of the West (1942) - (Rough Riders)
West of the Badlands (""The Border Legion"") (1940) - Roy Rogers
Below the Border (1942) - Buck Jones
Buckskin Frontier (1943) - Richard Dix
Forbidden Trails (1941) - Buck Jones
The Legend of the Lone Ranger (1952) - Clayton Moore
The Range Busters (1940) - Ray Corrigan
Red River Valley (1941) - Roy Rogers
Ridin' Down the Canyon (1942) - Roy Rogers

The oldest films in the pack were made in 1930, and they can be hard to sit through due to the halting nature of dialogue and action in early talkies. However, watching the evolution of the sound western is part of the fun too. You'll also see some unlikely stars for western films such as silent slapstick comedian Al St. John in ""Billy the Kid's Range War"" from 1941 and Lou Gehrig in 1938's Rawhide. If you're a fan of the old western movies that used to be a staple of Saturday TV back in the 50's and 60's, I highly recommend this pack.",1204243200,12,2244,5.117486338797814

This set of twenty-four double-sided DVDs contains a hundred different movies. These monochrome films are now mostly banned from broadcast TV but some may remember them from the 1950s and 1960s. These low-budget ""B-pictures"" ran for about an hour. You can compare them to current dramas on TV. Back then most farms, stores, and ranches were owner-operated small businesses; no national chains or franchises. Many are concerned with the economic struggles of that era. The right to keep and bear arms was well-recognized then. Most of these films were set in modern times where they have automobiles, telephones, radio, to provide more realism to the audience. They were often classical morality plays where the evil doers were punished at the end. Most stories are concerned with saving a small ranch or business from economic disaster. Big landowners, or robber gangs, threatened these small businesses. [Did this echo the fears of small movie producers who were threatened by the big studios and their movie theater chains?]

The movies from the late 1930s often had music and singing as part of the story (""horse operas""). There was a limited amount of gunfire. The usual story showed the hero saving the ranch or farm and being thanked by a young woman. Other stories have the stars working undercover as US Marshals or Texas Rangers to neutralize various criminal gangs, like the private detective stories that were popular then. In the some stories a volunteer militia or Sheriff's posse protected people from big landowners (collective security). The classic westerns began to decline by 1950s when stories became concerned with personal conflicts rather than economic troubles. Horses became scarcer when replaced by tractors. Increasing costs harmed these low-budget movie studios. The decline in movie audiences matched the increase in television viewing. ""Shane"" was one of the last movies where small farmers and ranchers were threatened by a big landowner's greed for their lands. ""High Noon"" was an example of the new style of story about personal conflicts.

The first fifty movies are from the ""Western Legends 50 Movie Pack"". Most date to the 1930s and 1940s, the prime era for traditional Westerns before expenses went up for producing these low-cost films. There are big stars such as Roy Rogers (5), John Wayne (4), Tex Ritter (2), and Gene Autry (1). There are movies with real cowboys (like""Hoot"" Gibson and Tim McCoy). The other stars are: Tom Tyler, Ken Maynard and brother Kermit (circus and rodeo riders), Buck Jones, Bob Steele, George O'Brien, Ray Corrigan, and others.

The next fifty movies are from the ""Cowboy Legends 50 Movie Pack"". There is a wide range of actors in this set, many now long forgotten. About a third star Roy Rogers, a popular actor who played in a wide range of stories. Four feature Gene Autry, the best singing cowboy in those times. Other films star: Harry Carey Sr., Johnny Mack Brown (a football star), Buster Crabbe, Hoot Gibson, Ken Maynard, Buck Jones, Tim McCoy, Tex Ritter, Bob Steele, Randolph Scott, and others.",1346284800,,3106,5.084313725490196
