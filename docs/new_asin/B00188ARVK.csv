8268770,5,B00188ARVK,"My sisters, brother and I are all Baby Boomers and found ""Saving Our Parents"" one of the most useful tools to ensure the safety and happiness of our elderly mother.  We were are stunned to see the realities of today's criminals and their ways of harming the elderly to gain money and valuables.  We now check in on our parent at least a few times a day to ensure that no strangers are asking for donations or that a service person doesn't not show up to fix something that does not need repair. And in case we are suspicious, we now know clues to look for when something doesn't seem quite ""right."" Bravo to ""Saving Our Parents!""",1214524800,,629,4.367521367521367
8268771,5,B00188ARVK,"Thank goodness someone has produced this timely and incredibly
enlightening documentary.  It highlights what I think we all are turning a `blind-eye' to - the exploitation and victimization of our elderly citizens.
I recently learned that one elderly person is victimized every 2.7 minutes!
Very sad and shocking!  This DVD teaches us to take an
active role in the lives of our older family members.  We are their first
line of defense against scam-artists and crooks who prey on our elderly in their golden years.  Our parents protected and watched out for us when we were young and vulnerable, and this documentary teaches us how to return the favor!
Bravo to Bitticks, Breininger, Asner and other celebs.  Buy this DVD, you'll be so very glad you did!",1214438400,,754,4.905511811023622
8268772,5,B00188ARVK,This is the best and only documentary I have ever seen that addresses all the problems you might encounter as you begin to care for an aging relative or just to educate yourself.  It shares solutions to guard against senior scams and has interviews with actual victims that both touch your heart and inspire.  It also has interesting footage of a family who created an intergenerational home as well as other inspirational tips from Ed Asner and the other experts and celebs.,1213747200,2,475,4.780487804878049
