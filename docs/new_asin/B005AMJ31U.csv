4641127,5,B005AMJ31U,"Michael Winner's LAWMAN  is an interesting western capturing the end of an era with sentimentality of sorts combined with a brutal cathartic streak of graphic violence. If the legends die, they certainly end here with director Michael Winner's vision of one era ending and a new one beginning. This one of Burt Lancaster's best performances and is an almost symbolic operatic parable that parallels his own career as a major film star whose time in the spotlight was slowly coming to an close. This is a film that bears repeated viewing. Its multi-layered structure is very stark yet haunting and the final confrontation in the street leaves the viewer mesmerized. This is very much-overlooked classic from director Michael Winner.

THE DAY OF THE OUTLAW is strange filmmaking indeed. This Western film noir, directed by Andre De Toth, is curious stuff. THE DAY OF THE OUTLAW seems like a cross between directors' Sam Fuller and William ""Wild Bill"" Wellman ventures into the Western film genre. Robert Ryan is pitted against the evil Burl Ives in this cold and stark black and white production. That vision of starkness is the greater substance and very effective essence of this outstanding film. An interesting score from Alexander Courage and Russell Harlan's cinematography are very effective here.

An often overlooked film is 1967's HOUR OF THE GUN directed by John Sturges, which is a direct sequel to his 1957 film GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL. HOUR OF THE GUN begins with the gunfight, which was the protracted climax to the 1957 film. In the 1967 film the gunfight is short, concise and a thoroughly bitter affair. From that point on we see James Garner's Wyatt Earp begin a transition from a highly moral individual who upholds the law to a man who gradually turns into a dark and unattractive character who uses the law to seek revenge with growing ferocity as he falls deeper into an abyss of moral decline with each act of vengeance. In a total role reversal we also see Jason Robards' Doc Holliday questioning Earp's motives as he acts as his ever present conscience throughout. When Earp's vengeance is finally complete we see him return or attempt to return to the man he once was. However, the friendship between Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday is no longer what it was. Doc Holliday was a man who had fallen from grace long before he befriended Wyatt and to watch his friend go down that same path obsessed and devoid of conscience was too much for him to bear. Doc Holliday had befriended the upstanding Wyatt out of some sense of self-redemption. By the end of HOUR OF THE GUN that notion is destroyed. James Garner's performance as Wyatt Earp is one of his best. His moral decline and final realization of his vengeful acts come full circle as you visually examine his performance. Edward Anhalt's script and John Sturges' direction are a powerful combination. There is quite a bit of moral ambiguity at play in HOUR OF THE GUN.",1336780800,30,2945,4.804733727810651

4641135,4,B005AMJ31U,"The high rating for these movies if more for the quality of the reproductions than the movies themselves. Clear, sharp and full screen they were fun to watch. If you are a Robert Ryan fan it's fun to watch him in three different roles (okay they are all westerns but still). As far as the rest of it, they are average westerns.",1430697600,2,327,4.290322580645161

4641137,4,B005AMJ31U,"These movies from a movie history point of view are the progression from the John Wayne hero flicks of the 50s/60s through the shock of Eastwood spaghetti anti hero stuff to a more subtle, a good guy in a lousy situation. Hour of the Gun is the Earps and Holiday post OK Corral. Lancaster in Lawman is great as a guy who wants to do the right thing. Day of the Outlaw is the slowest of the three and it is the Wyoming winter that can keep you watching if for no other reason than trying to understand why people would film in that kind of weather. Short version, the 3 pack is worth the money.",1424044800,,593,4.120689655172414

4641148,5,B005AMJ31U,"My husband is like me.....we have not patience.  He can't stand commercials on TV so he watches a lot of old westerns and Perry Mason TV.  Then he saw ""Hour of the Gun"" and loved it.  He loved the way the subject matter was treated so differently in this version of the old fav.  Even our neighbor who is in his 40's was draw to it when he came over to check out our new computer.  He watched 5 minutes of it and asked to borrow it.  I doubt if he'll be able to get it away from my hubby who has the entire movie memorized.
Guys and western flicks will never go out of style.",1382313600,8,575,3.913793103448276
4641149,4,B005AMJ31U,"Hour Of The Gun has always been a favorite film of mine. It covers the period of Wyatt Earp's life immediately after the famous Earp/Clanton/McLaury Tombstone shoot-out. As with all 'Hollywood history' it bends some facts (even though at the beginning of the picture it states ""this is the way it actually happened"") but it's an entertaining story well performed by many talented actors.
Lawman was an interesting movie for me up until the last ten minutes. It just fell apart with a jarring conclusion that seemed to have come from a completely different writer and script. Many great actors. good picture quality but . . . that ending! Sheesh!
The real gem in this collection is Day Of The Outlaw! A film noir western! Superior story, superior acting, superior cinematography!
It's the only film here in black and white but it is definitely the most colorful one in presentation! Robert Ryan, Tina Louise, Burl Ives, even David Nelson all turn in finely tuned performances! I highly recommend it!",1381104000,13,998,4.911242603550296
4641150,4,B005AMJ31U,"good movies.  I had seen and liked ""Hour of the gun"" and ""Lawman"" but had not seen ""Day of the Outlaw"".  Good movie in the end.",1370390400,,127,3.8461538461538463
4641151,5,B005AMJ31U,"Gritty, real west, no bull or frills.  The way it was.  Burt Lancaster at this remote and taciturn best.  Robert Ryan at his sardonic best also.  James Garner great in an out of character strictly business role (as Wyatt Earp).  Jason Robards at his sardonic best also.
Lawmen is an unusual but haunting movie.  Noir to the max.  Not a trickle of a laugh in it.
Day of the Outlaw also a noir gem.  Hour of the Gun the way it was (the OK Corral story that has been butchered in other films).
Three top notch films.",1369699200,5,513,4.216494845360825
