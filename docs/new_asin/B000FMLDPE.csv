8124720,4,B000FMLDPE,I heard the review of the movie and thought I had to get it so judge for myself. Not enough nudity and if you can make this film work in the U.S. then wonderful.  I had to use my computer to watch it since our items here in the U.S. only allows us to view our own movies and since this is a French film and produced it is only able to be used on French dvd players.  Silly I know..... Thank God for computers to access everything literally.  I thought it was a great film I thought it could have had more nudity It was hard to understand didn't make much sense.  A girl killed a boy and they couldn't make sense on who could have done it until the girl confessed and during that time a homoerotic moment came out of it and still made no sense. Definitely an indie film for those people that love indie films.,1437868800,,808,4.03125
