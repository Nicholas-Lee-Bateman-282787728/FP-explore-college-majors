5464867,5,B00APK6KEK,"Brilliant and funning family movie. Mr. Peterson, played brilliantly by the extraordinary David Tennant, has just moved to town and bought a new house with his very expectant wife (Joanna Page) to start a new job as a primary school teacher. The class, Mr. Peterson is to teach, has been temporarily under the control of Mr. Poppy (Marc Wooten) the class room assistant from hell. Mr. Poppy has devised a plan for the class to enter the Song for Christmas contest to be held in Wales. Mr. Poppy kidnaps Mr. Peterson, to go along with him and the children and a baby to the contest. The group gets detoured and runs out of gas, and must make their way on foot and by boat with all kinds of adventures on the way, and soul searching by Mr. Peterson on his relationship with his father, and twin brother and Mr. Poppy. When they get to the site of the contest, Mr. Peterson is confronted with his Twin, who is conducting another group and the games begin. The story is well written, the acting is brilliant, the music from the kids is extraordinary.  The ending with Mr. Peterson delivering his twin babies in a barn is sweet, and charming, and very heart warming. I would recommend this movie to anyone for family movie night.",1385769600,9,1224,4.513513513513513
5464868,5,B00APK6KEK,I truly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it highly for a family movie night.  You will totally love it.,1384905600,,109,4.45
5464869,4,B00APK6KEK,"This story takes place in a school in England. The unconventional assistant teacher, the new teacher and the children decide to head to Wales for a competition. The competition involves writing and singing an original song for Christmas.

The children and the adults embark on a driving experience which is quite an adventure and you wonder if they will arrive at the castle where the competition is being held, in time for the song fest.  Be assured they do but with many challenges and opportunities to problem solve along the way.

There are funny moments but also moments where you see families connect in a new understanding of each other. You will see the ""underdog"" rise to the occasion and meet the challenges of the trip and competition and then there is the surprise ending in the stable on Christmas night.

This is a family movie. The beginning may be a bit confusing but as it progresses , you will become involved in the momentum of the children and the adults singing their way to the end.

5464871,5,B00APK6KEK,"Although this is the sequel to Nativity!, you do not need to have seen the first movie in order to enjoy this hilarious story/musical. It follows the story of British schoolchildren as they strive to enter and then win a Christmas song contest. You will likely be exhausted from laughing and shouting at the TV. David Tennant does his usual fantastic job at acting as the bemused and bewildered teacher, and the child actors are funny and adorable. There is a fair amount of rude humour, but that's to be expected in British films.",1480896000,2,531,4.659574468085107
5464872,4,B00APK6KEK,not as good as vol 1 Nativity but still full of laughs,1477699200,,54,3.5833333333333335

5464874,5,B00APK6KEK,"Came across this during the Christmas season. Too funny, My husband surprised me with the dvd so I can watch it a few times each year.",1463875200,,134,4.1923076923076925
5464875,5,B00APK6KEK,"I first saw this movie on Netflix. I was excited, because I love Christmas movies and I love David Tennant.

So, the plot's nothing groundbreaking - a new teacher tries to get his class on track, but the class just wants to have silly fun. They decide to enter the ""Song for Christmas"" competition, where schools across the country write a new Christmas song and perform it to win a prize. A chunk of the movie is the class trying to prepare for the competition, despite the school's headmistress forbidding it and the class's teacher - played by David Tennant - preferring they work on their studies as opposed to entering a silly singing contest, and then the class's misadventures just trying to get to the actual contest venue. They're hindered along the way by the class's old nemesis, a Mr. Shakespeare from a much better school, as well as David Tennant's character's more successful twin brother.

The main thing that's great about this movie is the humor - the jokes are inoffensive, and not stupid. The kids all act totally natural - partly because this and the other Nativity! movies involved a lot of adlibbing - and they're all SUPER cute. The songs in this film (as well as in the first Nativity! movie) are really catchy and fun as well.

So, certainly this movie isn't Oscar-worthy, but it's an extremely enjoyable movie that I found myself watching over and over again when it was still on Netflix - even during the summer.",1461801600,,1440,4.661417322834645

5464879,5,B00APK6KEK,"This movie has become a new tradition in our house! We were introduced to it over a year ago by some British friends and just died over how cute it is! We ended up watching it another 3 times over the year (once in JULY) because we wanted to show other friends! This year we couldn't find it to rent again and were so sad! But now I have my own copy and am thrilled!!! So will you like it?

Here are some insights:
The humor is British.
David Tennent is wonderful! (so is the other guy!)
But the children steal the show! They are so adorable!!
The premise is cute, but a little campy. Making fun of ""has been stars"" trying too hard, and the theater culture, like beauty pageants, or choral contests.
It is very clean, and lots of situational comedy.
Simple story, quite predictable, pure entertainment, with some sweet morals.

All in all, so entertaining and cute!",1456876800,2,865,4.4
5464880,5,B00APK6KEK,Hilarious and such a good family movie! My mom watched it on tv years ago and wanted to share the experience with me so she asked me to order it. I bet we turn watching this into a yearly holiday tradition. I'm almost 30 and i thought it was a great mix of family fun and good humor!,1455494400,,283,3.896551724137931

This movie was silly and lighthearted and clean fun for all ages. There are even some catchy tunes (I'm impressed by all the original Christmas songs that the creators of the movie came up with). This is now one of our favorite Christmas movies and new tradition to watch during Christmastime. Brilliant!",1449446400,2,419,4.6

Mr. Poppy and the kids from St. Bernadette's are back again in this sequel to the equally awesome 'Nativity!'. All these elements come together to create a beautiful story, showing that Christmas is not just about presents and decorations, but about the birth of Jesus and love. 'Danger In the Manger' is a wonderful family movie, and I would recommend it to anyone. But don't miss out on anymore than you have to. Go check out 'Nativity!' for even more family holiday fun.",1446508800,2,647,4.837837837837838

David Tennant does a good job playing twin brothers in the film.  A nice comedy for the holiday season.  If there is any negative points in the movie it would probably be the no restraint performance of Marc Wooton who is too over the top in this one.  Also the climbing down the mountain scene was unnecessary.  In this story the new teacher (Tennant) goes along with Mr. Poppy's decision to go against the Principal's wishes to take the children to a singing contest in Wales.  Being a fantasy the children, with no rehearsal at all, are tremendous in their performance.  Like I said - ridiculous but cute.",1402272000,,755,4.45985401459854

If you are buying it because you LOVE Mr Poppy, well, then, we have very different taste, but ok. Mr Poppy takes over the show in this movie. His antics that make you cringe in the first movie will make you sigh and roll your eyes in this one. Not funny. Not clever. David Tennant, an actor I love and but movies just because he is in ( Decoy Bride, which is fantastic) did not deliver. It felt like he was trying for a different play on Martin Freeman.

5464974,4,B00APK6KEK,"Cute movie with typical British humor. I got this movie because I like David Tennant.  All in all this sequel to Nativity is a very cute story and I liked it better then Nativity. It has nice kid's singing acts and the similarity to the real nativity at the end may be viewed as somewhat disrespectful, but it really isn't if you keep in mind you are watching a comedy and not a real depiction of the nativity.

The children singers are nice to see. There is some real talent there. The bumbling teaching assistant is mostly funny, sometimes too ridiculous to be realistic. There is a competitive side to this story and hopefully this teaches that cheating is not the way to go, however that could have been made more clear in this storyline. But this is entertainment and not lesson teaching. It is good fun.",1389052800,,809,4.496598639455782

I have to consider this one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I've seen some stinkers!  Mr. Poppy's role was totally unbelievable and inappropriate.  How could he keep his teacher's assistant job, behave like that, and not get arrested?  David Tennant's teacher roles were an insult to his skills and to teachers everywhere.  Children were traveling the countryside and lost without their parents knowledge an not one of the parents was looking for them.  Imagine what else could have been done with the money it took to make this movie that would have actually benefitted mankind.  Pam Ferris from ""Rosemary & Thyme"" seemed an unbelievable idiot!

5464983,3,B00APK6KEK,"Given this has the same director and many of the actors from the first ""Nativity!"", I had high hopes, because I love the first film. But this one lacked the same genuine heart of the first.

This is in no way a blight upon Mr. Tennant, whom I adore -- but it was not HIS story, not really. I never got to know his character well enough to be invested in Mr. Peterson. The insanity kicked in from moment one and didn't let up. The new teacher became a sidebar of a rather haphazard plot.

Honestly, Mr. Poppy should have been not only sacked, but arrested by now, the school closed a dozen times over as a result of his genuine stupidity. In the first movie, there was a restraint; people were able to rein him in when it got absolutely too much, too dangerous--too, quite frankly, stupid. That was the charm of the relationship with Mr Maddens -- there was a point where this overgrown child was made to see SOME reason. None of that materialized here, the character being allowed to run roughshod over everyone, to the detriment of the film. And the references to Mr. Maddens were nice, but obviously Mr. Poppy forgot everything Mr. Maddens ever taught him.

The first film also focused on a single rivalry between schools--and so the music and performances were narrowed to two sets of children. This, with the national competition, diluted the focus to the point of trope and cliche -- no reason was given for WHY these students suddenly wowed the judges and the audience, and the point of Gordon cheating his way to the prize was left hanging.

""Nativity!"" leaves me in tears and smiles every time. ""Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger!"" just leaves me tired and a tad depressed.",1387497600,8,1680,4.534653465346534
5464984,1,B00APK6KEK,"I am a huge David Tennant fan, and I enjoy funny holiday movies. I was let down on both counts. David Tennant's teacher character takes a big backseat to his man-child of a teaching assistant. The plot is unbelievably absurd, and, by the end of the movie, the parents seem to have forgotten about their recklessly endangered children. For me, the only bright spots were the songs. When compared to the storyline, they should win awards. If you are looking for a quality David Tennant movie, watch The Decoy Bride. If you are looking for a funny holiday movie, watch Four Christmases.",1387324800,4,583,4.7254901960784315
5464985,5,B00APK6KEK,"I watched Nativity! with Martin Freeman to prepare myself for this movie, and was a bit apprehensive because I didn't much like the first film.  Not that the acting left anything to be desired, but when I want a family movie there are certain lines that I draw in the sand.  The two biggest problems I had with the first film were:
1) Martin's character Mr. Maddens had clearly been living with his girlfriendthey were not married, and there seemed to be no assurance they ever would.
2) Some of the dance moves that Mr. Poppy taught the children were clearly sexual in nature.

My family believes in the sanctity of marriage, and a movie that does not encourage that isn't acceptable.  And since there are young people in my house, any content that is sexually suggestive is also a big no.  The first Nativity movie failed to meet our family's requirements.

So, I was pleasantly surprised when this sequel contained much less rude content than the first, as well as a married couple rather than a man with a live-in girlfriend.  And while the first movie seemed focussed more on worldly success, the sequel addresses more important themes such as fatherhood, the true meaning of Christmas, family, and forgiveness.

My dad is very choosy about movies and he's difficult to impress, but he absolutely loved this one.  This is definitely a great family film.",1386806400,3,1358,4.74468085106383
5464986,4,B00APK6KEK,"Despite the absurd (really, really absurd) plot twists, I found this movie to be totally charming and quite funny overall.  It's a good choice for family viewing, as it contains no foul language or sexual innuendos, and my 8-year old daughter actually sat in one place for the entire running time (nearly 2 hours), and laughed her head off.  David Tennant is his usual ""adorkable"" self as the beleaguered new teacher Mr. Peterson, and Marc Wooton, well, I don't really know how to describe him or his character, teaching assistant Mr. Poppy, except as maybe the love child that would result if Jack Black got together with Jim Carrey in his Ace Ventura days.

Really cute rather than obnoxious kids and some fine holiday tunes round out the pleasures that this movie has to offer.  Sure, there's a few cliched moments, but what holiday films don't have at least some of them?  In my opinion, this movie is definitely worth the price.",1386720000,2,933,4.734567901234568
5464987,1,B00APK6KEK,"Nativity! is one of my favorite movies, and I like David Tennant, so I was excited for this.  I shouldn't have been.  The first movie is incredibly charming, even in it's absurdity.  This movie ramps the absurdity way up, looses the charm, and throws in a heaping dose of fart and poo jokes.  And the songs are forgettable at best.  Unless you saw the first one and thought, ""Mr. Poppy is the best thing ever! I need a movie that just lets him be as insane and annoying as he wants to be, and doesn't care too much about anything else,"" then give this movie a pass.  I'm sure it will make little kids laugh, but don't expect it to be one the whole family enjoys.",1386460800,,662,4.214285714285714
