2509732,4,B000E8JO32,"I just bought this set and did not encounter the technical difficulties that a previous reviewer had.  However, it would have been nice if the set had been packaged better.  The Busby Berkley set has each film/DVD in its own case.  This set has a fold out with the discs stacked on top of each other in groups of two.  Of all the films selected, Four Frightened People seems an odd choice if one is trying to do a retrospect of this man's achievements.  Perhaps, like stories by Edgar Allan Poe, this film was tension filled during its time, but it seems rather bland by today's standards.  It is a film that could have been directed by anyone.  I found myself more concerned with the fate of the King Charles spaniel than the rest of the cast.  They should have selected a more worthy film for this collection, like Samson and Delilah, as DeMille was known for the pagentry and casts of thousands in his films. Sign of the Cross is presented in its original entirety, with Intermission and several scenes cut out by the censors now fully restored.  Cleopatra is typical thirties fare, coming off more like Dinner at Eight than a study of the exotic Queen of the Nile.  Perhaps someday someone can tell me....why Claudette Colbert as Cleopatra?  She was better in Sign of the Cross.",1148515200,3,1282,4.554585152838428

Sales figures show that classic titles sell surprisingly well when they are accompanied by background documentaries and commentary tracks. DeMille isn't exactly a household name nowadays, and this series cries out for a better release. Shame on Universal!",1146700800,53,452,5.277777777777778

2509764,3,B000E8JO32,"Who is writing these rave reviews??? All these movies have some merit and interest but with the exception of Union Pacific are almost unfathomable from the modern perspective. IE: they don't hold up. The best is Union Pacific but not for the direction. The sheer force of the actors here are outstanding. Stanwick, McCray, Preston, are all fabulous. You don't want to miss a minute of this and it holds your interest. The 2nd best is the one most panned and that's Four Frightened People. While its a bit old fashioned is very droll and amusing, sometimes laugh out load funny. I really enjoyed it. I've never seen Colbert look LESS glamorous...well at least until the end.  Now she shines and glitters in Cleopatra, this movie I enjoyed, visually fascinating and great performances by Colbert and Henry Wilcoxon and talk about sexy!!!. The end of the first seduction scene  between her and Mark Anthony shows absolutely nothing but is one of the sexiest scenes I have ever seen on film. I will say no more....just watch it!!The Crusades is just painful to view. Slow and completely UNcompelling. Lastly The Sign of the Cross which is so lauded is only interesting because of all the naughtiness in it. Pre code with lesbian dances, nude male slave to the emperor etc. Fun but the subject matter sucks and the characters are TOTALLY unbelievable.",1438041600,2,1346,4.822510822510822

2509777,5,B000E8JO32,"The transfer on these films is amazing and gives them an unexpected immediacy. Maybe because of that, the surprisingly contemporary looking Sign of the Cross has horrific arena scene highlights (and I mean, dang!)  that are almost an hour long, far more graphic than anything made in the 50's or 60's, with heartfelt Christian scenes a most welcome theme; DeMille proves he was a genius and great master of cinema. ""Four Strightened Strangers"" has been given a pass by many perhaps only because it stands out in contrast to other movies DeMille made, but we found it a well made, exotic and enticing tale of survival.  I always wanted to see Union Pacific because of the train wreck in it, I wasn't disappointed. The Crusades is next and I am confident it will please as have the others. The movies in this box set are terrific and appear as beautifully done originally with what must have been a loving restoration job. They are pristine and sound great.  Side note: I remember standing in a Borders a few years ago looking over this handsome package, not quite willing to spring $60 for it at the time because I had no idea how well restored they might be. I can safely say they were worth $60 bucks then as they are today, but what a bargain price I just paid. These are totally worth it.  By the way, I am reading the DeMille book that just came out along with it and find it all a much entertaining value.",1429920000,2,1410,4.474708171206226

DeMille is what the likes of Cameron and ike will hope to be remembered: he was the first to stretch a story to fit the screen... DeMille did provide the emperor's needs for the masses of the 30's.

2509833,5,B000E8JO32,"This is a 1930's glitterati combination of films. Cleopatra, is my favourite. It is campy, super over-gilded and sparkly. The script is a little goofy, but it is also a very, very old melodramatic film. The scenes with Caesar are wonderful, they are so much in love. Some of Ms. Colbert's costumes, are pretty risqu, especially by 1930's standards. Wonderful costumes, fabulous huge clanking jewelry!!! Heavy music and thrilling vistas. The rolled up rug scene is hilarious.

Ms. Colbert, is fashionable, glittery, gilded, bejeweled, entertaining, funny and sensuous. She makes the film and I so glad that this version of Cleopatra, has been preserved. A real hit, if one enjoys older movies. I loved it and watch this film often, it cheers me up when I am sad. The overdone sets, the fabulous, heavy gilded costumes and the great campy dialogue.

WARNING: to animal lovers, there is an extensive use of dead animals (cheetahs, lions, etc.) and animal skins, parts of this film are difficult  to watch, with all the wasted Cheetah skins. There ARE NO ANIMLAS KILLED IN THIS FILM!! that was already done long ago. It is just that, years later where many people have developed a sensitivity to scores of dead animals in films, it is a little bit sickening to see so much animal skin and fur usage.

But then again this film is from the 1930's when an animals life meant absolutely nothing, unless it was dead.",1385164800,,1407,4.801652892561983

2509848,4,B000E8JO32,"These films are created and directed by Cecil B DeMille.  He felt that the BIGGER a motion Picture was, the better.  In all his history films, except the westerns, the characters are almost cartoon characters- they repersent what DEMille thought they should be instead of what a real person would really be like.  In this set, two of these films(The Sign Of The  Cross and Cleopatra) fit this description.  They are very heavy going and rate 2 stars each.  The Crusades rates 3 stars because the plot and acting are better than the other two history films in this set.  Four Frightened People rates 4 stars- the acting is very good and the plot keeps your interest.  The last film in this set is Union Pacific, it rates 5 stars  and is one of the greatest westerns ever made.  The acting is first rate and the plot is great.

2509879,4,B000E8JO32,"Beginning in the mid-30's and continuing until a dispute with his Union in the 40's led to the termination of his association with the Lux Radio Theater, DeMille was able to reinforce his position as one of America's Premiere Film Directors through hosting that program. Hosting (not directing, as much of the Public believed), meant he came in once a week, rehearsed his part in the script, as did the other actors, acted the host during the on-air broadcast, and collected roughly $5000 dollars a week for his efforts. More important than the money to the director of many highly popular films over many years, was the showplace it allowed him for his own films and the status it afforded him as the best known of Hollywood Directors. Critics had a field day with many of his films, never did he receive attention as a ""serious"" film'maker, but he did make money for his studio..and that is what gave him Power. (Only in his last days, did his All-Star circus film win an Academy Award, even if the film won more for the need to recognize the then Grand Old Pioneer, than as a symbol of critical success).
This collection well-represents his body of work in the thirties, when he was at the top of his game.  Each contains at least one leading star and a handful of top feature and supporting players,and a plot that touched all bases with popular sentiment while suggesting but never showing ""shocking"" behavior. In some, the length might induce a certain degree of impatience today, but this is a minor drawback. For an older audience there might be a bit of nostalgia in seeing some of the stars of the period, for younger audiences, there will be the historical interest. For all of us, these are part of a culture which, with essentially minor updating, is still what films and television are all about. The surface may be more ""sophisticated"" but the story is pretty much unchanged.",1342137600,,1890,4.675675675675675

2509886,5,B000E8JO32,"Cecil B. DeMille is one of the pillars of American film and therefore one of the world's pillars of film.  Presented here are some of his efforts from the early 1930's.  There's the usual pre-code sexual tones, especially in ""Sign of the Cross"" and ""Cleopatra"", that were characteristic of movies made before late 1934.  Claudette Colbert sizzles in both of the films above and Loretta Young was never more beautiful than she appears in ""The Crusades"",

Overall, I think the Universal transfer could use some work.  The films do not appear to be re-masters but taken from quality prints.  Hey, Universal, we are talking about one of the founding fathers of the movies.  His work diserves some work in return.  Re-master these films then the collection would be worth 6 stars.

Of the 5 flims presented, ""Cleopatra"" stands out for it's humor and collective performances.  I will say it right now, DeMille's Cleo is 10 times more entertaining than the film that broke 20th Century Fox (Cleo with Liz Taylor).  This is why Universal has recently re-released ""Cleopatra"" in a 75th anniversery edition.  All the films are very watchable.

2509899,3,B000E8JO32,"This collection of 5 films from Paramount in the thirties is a fair introduction to the epic film maker, Cecil B de Mille. In a long career, de Mille's films were certainly big but that did not mean that they were good. There is some dreadful rubbish in this collection but that is actually part of de Mille's appeal. No-one could make a film so big yet so bad. The public loved the junk even when the critics swooned. Let's start with the rubbish.

In 1934, ""Four Frightened People"" describes the trek through the Malaya jungles of 4 passengers who have abandoned a cruise ship carrying the bubonic plague. Credibility does not even remotely arise not only in the dumb screenplay but in the generally poor acting of the principals, William Gargan and Herbert Marshal, in particular. Mary Boland, with dog in her arms and plenty of makeup, is completely absurd as a divorcee trying to curb the birth rate and Claudette Colbert plays a mousy teacher who breaks her glasses and transforms into both a leader and a beauty. Colbert actually is quite good, the best of the quartet but the film is corny and predictable. It was both a critical and box office flop in its day and it is no surprise.

In 1935, De Mille made one of his religious epics for which he was famous. This one stars the magnetic but charmless Henry Wilcoxon as King Richard and Loretta Young as his queen, the fictional Berengaria. They make an odd team. The film has far too much talk with some dreadful dialogue (one soldier says to Young ""That's kinda rough on you""). As a result, it is really boring and, of course, as history, complete fiction. For the enthusiast, catch Ann Sheridan as a slave (""The cross, the cross, let me kiss the cross"") and J Carroll Naish as the head of the slave market.

The next 2 films star Claudette Colbert and are good examples of De Mille's expertise with crowd scenes. They have their share of delights, mainly visual, amidst the generally ludicrous dialogue and distorted history. Released in 1932, ""The Sign of the Cross"" is another religious epic with Charles Laughton's Nero fiddling while Rome burns and Colbert as a his evil wife Poppea. These 2 play it for laughs (Laughton very camp and Colbert very sexy) and elevate the film every time they appear. Unfortunately, the rest is bogged down by that prize ham, Fredric March, as the prefect of police who falls for Christian Elissa Landi, an ethereal beauty with lovely but ludicrous English diction. The film was reissued during the war and cut but we have the restored road show version here so we see Joyzelle Joyner's lesbian dance, tantalising glimpses of Colbert's torso as she bathes in ass's milk and some gratuitous violence in the Circus Maximus scenes. The film is corn but ripe corn at that so it is worth seeing.

De Mille's 1934 version of ""Cleopatra"" is an improvement. Compared to the overblown Taylor/Burton opus from the 60s, this is a simpler and therefore more entertaining film. Warren William is OK as Caesar and Claudette Colbert's sensational figure is very provocatively draped. She acts with that tongue in cheek quality which became one of her trademarks. There are some stunning visuals, particularly the capture of Marc Antony on Cleopatra's barge. One scene when Calpurnia hosts a lunch is hilarious due to the ludicrous dialogue. There are lots more - ""You and your friends, Romans and countrymen"" etc. The film has undergone some restoration so it looks good.

The final film is the best of the set. ""Union Pacific"" is a rousing western set around the building of the railroad which opened up the west. A sterling cast is headed by Barbara Stanwyck at her most appealing as a rough and tumble Irish heroine fought over by Robert Preston and Joel McCrea. The film was made with the co-operation of the Union Pacific Railroad so it looks and sounds authentic.

The films are in excellent condition but there are no extras, not even original trailers. The set is sometimes available at a fraction of its very expensive launch price and that is just as well because the high proportion of poor films and the mediocre packaging don't warrant a high price. The lack of extras, particularly information about De Mille's place in the history of Hollywood, means too that the uninformed may be disappointed by the corn.",1230422400,8,4303,4.738317757009346

2509904,5,B000E8JO32,"The movie that made me want to buy this collection was ""Cleopatra"" with Claudette Colbert as a kind of ""flapper queen of Egypt"" which to me has always been a great hoot.  While these are not the sorts of movies I would use to illustrate a particular historical epoch due to their accuracy, I would show them if I wanted to entertain someone. The Crusades is a good example with its characterization of a fictional king ""Michael of Russia"" when Russia as a state did not even exist.

De Mille was a larger than life figure and he was drawn to showing larger than life figures Colbert plays both Cleopatra and Nero's amoral wife covorting in mikl baths with passers by in ""Sign of the Cross.""  The Crusades, while not historically accurate has hosts of memorable scenes.  Union Pacific features Barbara Stanwyck in an adventerous role.

  The Crusades, 1935 - (***) -  henry wilcoxon is a fine richard the lion hearted, and ian keith a fine saladin, in cecil b de milles plea for tolerance.  unfortunately, apart from the usual spectacle, the movie falls rather flat, probably victimized by the bland righteousness of leading lady loretta young: surely one of the more deservedly forgotten stars of hollywoods golden era.  watch it for the size of the thing, but you might want to have a book handy during the dialogue sequences.",1181433600,4,1057,4.822222222222222

""Four Frightened People"" is a curio; okay to see once but that's it. ""Cleopatra"" and ""The Crusades"" are ponderous and boring. The boxed sets have their downside in that the titles one wants might have to be purchased along with films that wouldn't normally be desired for one's collection.

2509921,3,B000E8JO32,"Of the many screen incarnations of the romantically foolish, politically shrewd Egyptian queen, this was Cecil B. DeMille's... His Victorian puritan's approach to the sex and scandals surrounding Cleopatra's throne reflected her continuing appeal to the imagination - even if that imagination were really a childhood fantasy of adult desires...

Authenticity, except as decorative embroidery, took second place to his desire to capture her timeless appeal on film... Facts and figures may vary, fashions and desirable objects may be ever changing, but sex, sin and punishment make up a triangle of eternal allure...

Travis Banton's wardrobe transformed Claudette Colbert from a flirtatious star into a splendid, seductive woman with fanciful art direction... The film had the opulence, the barbarity, the epic sweep and shocking decadence of certain books and paintings that were at the heart of so much of this film...

The French-born, American-raised Claudette Colbert made three films with Cecil B. DeMille, but felt more comfortable in contemporary comedies, for one of which, 'It Happened One Night,' she won an Oscar, and in all of which she identified herself with the most American of American secretaries, sweethearts, wives and mothers...

Colbert's popularity lasted well into the fifties... but her magic rests with 'Cleopatra'.",1166832000,7,1342,5.563725490196078
2509922,4,B000E8JO32,"Universal's collection of several of the great showman's biggest hits is a half-hearted affair - the films are there, but the showmanship is completely missing in a lackluster presentation.

De Mille's Cleopatra is much more fun than you'd expect, played as much for deliberately camp comedy as for spectacle and a lot pacier at 104 minutes than the Elizabeth Taylor version. Warren William plays Caesar as De Mille himself, Henry Wilcoxen plays Anthony as an oaf and Claudette Colbert takes centerstage as the kind of vixen who knows which side of the Roman Empire her bread is buttered. At times De Mille's tongue is firmly in his cheek - not least a wonderfully drawn out death scene from Leonard Mudie that wouldn't look out of place in Carry On Cleo or Cleo's spectacular seduction of Tony on that fabled barge - but there's some fine filmmaking here too, not least a great battle montage padded out with footage from the silent Ten Commandments and a fine bit of censor baiting as a foreground hand ostensibly playing the harp seems to almost paw at Colbert's body. It ain't history but it is fun. Nice score from Rudolph Kopp too.

De Mille's The Crusades isn't history either, but it's certainly a lot more fun than its reputation implies. Wilcoxen reprises his macho oaf routine as Richard the Lionheart, but despite the film being best remembered for failing to make him the major star De Mille thought he could be, he's a surprisingly confident and rather likeable oaf: Wilcoxen was always a better actor than he was ever given credit for, even if his sword has a better part in the movie than he does. Loretta Young is the gushing God-botherer Berengaria and many of De Mille's regulars pop up - Ian Keith, C. Aubrey Smith, Joseph Schildkraut and John Carradine (all of whom feature in Cleopatra) - to add color to the monochrome proceedings. It's no Kingdom of Heaven, opting for simplistic melodrama at every turn, but it's done with zest and passion, not to mention some remarkably ambitious camerawork at times. And the songs are maddeningly catchy.

The Sign of the Cross was a surprise too, but not a pleasant one. Obviously intended as a pretty blatant ripoff of earlier movie versions of Quo Vadis (although the play its based on was first performed in 1895, the year Sienkewicz's novel was first published), it's hard to believe just how monotonous and relentlessly static De Mille managed to make it. Claudette Colbert and Charles Laughton are fun as Poppea and Nero, but they're hardly in the picture, far too much time being taken up with Frederic March hamming it up as Marcus Superbus (no, really) as he falls for Elissa Landi's Christian gal Mercia (no relation to the county). It's restrained to the point of being inert at times, with far too much of the dreary Christians, although it does perk up for the arena finale which features dwarfs battling Amazon women, elephants crushing Christians and gorillas menacing naked women. The last 15 minutes aside, Dreary with a capital D.

It's hard to avoid the phrase `run of De Mille' for Cecil B.'s Four Frightened People, one of his lesser efforts that sees four white folks jumping ship after an outbreak of Bubonic Plague and taking an ill-advised and badly guided trek through the Malay jungle that rips off their stereotypical civilized veneer to reveal the stereotypical clichs beneath. Claudette Colbert's Miss Jones goes from downtrodden mousy schoolmarm to red-hot, husky voiced wisegal almost as soon as she breaks her glasses, henpecked Herbert Marshall discovers his inner he-man (yes, they really do use that phrase), William Lundigan goes from self-obsessed indifference to obnoxious would-be lecher, while only Mary Boland's matron remains unchanged in her determination to bring civilization and a reduced birthrate to the islands. On the plus side, Leo Carillo is entertaining as their local guide who seems to think owning a tie makes him English and there are a few good exchanges - ""It's practically virgin territory."" ""Perhaps that why Mr Corder doesn't like it."" - and it's only 78 minutes long.

De Mille's last black and white film, Union Pacific is something of a rarity these days, rarely revived on TV and forgotten in the wake of the Biblical epics that form only a small part of his repertoire. Harking back to his earlier The Plainsman, instead of friends Gary Cooper and James Ellison fighting over Jean Arthur against the background of the Indian Wars on the Great Plains we get friends Joel McRea and Robert Preston fighting over Barbara Stanwyck against the background of the building of the first coast-to-coast railroad. McRea's the agent assigned to stop Brian Donlevy's saboteurs, with old friend Preston among their number and Stanwyck the Hollywood Irish engineer's daughter they both love. Throw in train wrecks, Injun attacks, the odd gunfight, plenty of spectacle, Akim Tamiroff and a complete disregard for history and you've got the closest thing to talkie version of John Ford's The Iron Horse going. It's not up to the 1939 gold standard, but it is entertaining hokum.

While this set does boast uncut versions of all five films, it's maddeningly devoid of any extras whatsoever - a real crime, since De Mille's overblown trailers, usually hosted by the man himself, are great value, as are the many promotional short films that were made for the films. Since all still exist and are regularly excerpted in documentaries, there's no excuse for such lazy treatment.",1166140800,21,5487,4.932900432900433
2509923,4,B000E8JO32,"Producer-director Cecil B. DeMille was one of Hollywood's great storytellers.  His movies are sometimes derided as hokum, as with the magnificent remake of THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (1956 that shows on TV every Easter season.  But give the man credit for truly believing in the plots he was telling and for hiring the finest people on both sides of the camera.  Decades later, his films are still being watched and greatly enjoyed.

Universal's THE CECIL B. DeMILLE COLLECTION contains no less than four grandly entertaining and gorgeously photographed masterworks--THE SIGN OF THE CROSS (1932, Paramount), CLEOPATRA (1934, Paramount), THE CRUSADES (1935, Paramount), and his masterpiece UNION PACIFIC (1939, Paramount).  Only the badly written and ludicrously acted FOUR FRIGHTENED PEOPLE (1934, Universal) is a dud.  DeMille's actors in SIGN OF THE CROSS include Claudette Colbert as an evil empress, Charles Laughton as Nero, Fredric March as a Roman officer, and Elissa Landi as the Christian girl whom March will sacrifice his life for.  Watch for Colbert bathing in asses' milk, which two kittens lick.  This is the uncut roadshow version.

Two years later, Colbert is Cleopatra and her leading men are Warren William and Henry Wilcoxon.  I can never remember which is Julius Caesar and which is Marc Antony.  This visual feast won a Cinematography Oscar for Victor Milner, who would work frequently with Mr. DeMille.  The Interior Decoration should have won also.  This 1934 production, running a tight 102 minutes, is light years more entertaining than the four hour 1963 epic.

THE CRUSADES has Henry Wilcoxon again, this time as Richard the Lionhearted.  We are in 1200 A.D., where the Christians are fighting for control of Jerusalem.  Joseph Schildkraut has a great supporting role as a power-mad soldier or general, C. Aubrey Smith is deeply moving as the Christian wise man willing to give up his life for Christianity, and Loretta Young is at her loveliest as Verangaria, who is willing to marry Richard so that his army has enough food and drink for a trek across the Middle East.  THE CRUSADES is one of my favorite movies as a Christian about people willing to die for the power of Christianity.  And, once again, Victor Milner makes it look absolutely gorgeous.

My favorite in this first-class boxed set is UNION PACIFIC, a thrilling 139 minute saga about the building the Transcontinental Railroad in the 1860's.  The cast is magnificent--Barbara Stanwyck (with Irish brogue) as an engineer's daughter torn between marshall  Joel McCrea and train robber Robert Preston.  The chief bad guy is always dependably evil Brian Donlevy, while Akim Tamiroff and Lynne Overman are McCrea's aides, always ready with pistol and whip.  Boy, I love this movie, which has impeccable sets and photography.  I know movies were frequently made on studio back lots, with a lot of rear projection.  But UNION PACIFIC really looks as if it were shot out in the desert and with real trains.  It may be fiction, but it makes me feel like a kid again, watching all twelve chapters of a cliffhanger serial at one sitting.  It is one of Mr. DeMille's crowning achievements for me.

These prints are shimmering knockouts, seemingly all from the UCLA Film and TV Archives.  They are great fun, but also tell intelligent stories and have passionate triangle romances.  If only Universal Home Video had included some serious bonuses and individual cardboard cases for each movie, like the incomparable Warner Home Video does.  Because of that lack, I am giving this set a 5 star rating for four of the movies, but knocking it down 1 star for the packaging with the disks loose, two on top of each other on open up cardboard.  Heed this, Colleen Benn.  The lack of bonuses and protective casing on the movies is especially galling on a set selling for $60 ($52 from Amazon), the same price as the Warner Home Video deluxe sets.  No, it is actually MORE expensive than Warners, and for LESS bonuses.  I only paid $42 for a six film Clark Gable collection from Warners with a ton of bonuses and each movie in protective casing.

2509924,4,B000E8JO32,"DeMille started in silent movies and his directorial style was to awe and tease. Cleopatra has a number of set pieces that are wildly, baroquely theatrical. DeMille was certainly a showman. He could also be a tease - dialogue and costumes (Colbert's outfit in Cleopatra is as revealing as the censors would allow) must have raised eyebrows back in the thirties - of course, DeMille is always determined to have a moral - no matter how hypocritical it seems after the wild burlesques he tosses at the camera. When Marc Antony and Cleopatra finally kiss and proceed to the next step, flowers drop from the roof, dancing girls pull curtains in front of the camera, and the ship's leader beats a drum in rhythm - the only thing missing is Bolero blaring from the orchestra. It is all good fun in the old Hollywood style. Dated but well worth seeing if you haven't done so before.",1151712000,2,875,4.615384615384615

Technical quality great considering the age of the movies.",1151193600,4,396,5.26984126984127

So Universal, with an impressive library of Paramount movies from the 30s and 40s, and a less-impressive but still significant library of its own films from the classic era decides finally not to smoosh films onto DVD-18s like they are cattle, and give a more ""proper"" presentation"" to some of the jewels in their vault.

So applause to them for even knowing that they own THE SIGN OF THE CROSS, and releasing the restoration that UCLA did on the film, along with some other notable DeMille classics in a multi-disc set (along with a rather boring turkey [FOUR FRIGHTENED PEOPLE}.

The marvelous Kevin Brownlow created an epic biography of DeMille, but is it to be found here? No.

Did Universal create any extras for this set? No.

Did they even try to find the 1960s TV special about the man?

No.

While it's commendable that instead of the annual re=release of FRANKENSTEIN or 16 CANDLES that they dug into their vault a bit, these acceptable transfers with no supplementary materials are pathetic compared to what kind of presentation they could, and should have been given.

Rightly so.  Saw Union Pacific myself just a few months ago, boy, it's B-A-A-A-D, even given the acting conventions of the time. Cliche heaven.

But, there's no doubt the DeMille was ""da man"" right up to the mid-50s, with ""Greatest Show On Earth"" and ""Ten Commandments""--as hammy as they were (and still are.)

So, here's what I'd propose in a perfect DVD/Blu Ray movie world: a great 2 hour + (hey, epic proportions, right?) documentary on De Mille, with all sorts of insights, behind-the-scenes stuff, interviews (old and new) with whoever's left alive, and others, and lots of and 60 & 90 second clips of the masterworks, including these.

8107273,5,B000E8JO32,"I must admit that my main reason for buying this collection was to own ""Union Pacific"". A favorite of mine that I had not seen in many years. The last time I viewed it was on the afternoon movie that played Mon-Fri from 1-3pm. This was on an independent station in the late 70's when your TV was 21"" and weighed 50 lbs! However, not only did I thoroughly enjoy ""Union Pacific"" but the other titles are outstanding on their own. ""Sign of the Cross"" has two of my favorite golden age actors, Fredric March as Marcus and Charles Laughton as Nero. While not going in depth suffice to say that this is a story of the horrific persecution the earliest Christians suffered for their faith. This movie was obviously done with a lot of love and respect from DeMille for these early martyrs. In this restoration it has been returned to all its glory including some pre-code scenes that are surprising for the time. Such as the milk bath Claudette Colbert takes and the Dance of the Naked Moon scenes. But, at its core, this is a love story between a high ranking Roman man, that just happens to be the ""boy toy"" of Colbert's Empress, and a devout Christian woman.
In Cleopatra Claudette Colbert returns as the queen of the Nile weaving her spell on both Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Especially the rolled up rug scene. While it does require you to suspend your good sense what movie, at some point, doesn't! Miss Colbert also returns in ""Four Frightened People"" as a very plain, almost drab, geography teacher. The four are on a ship when three of them notice an outbreak of bubonic plague and, wisely, decide to exit the ship, unannounced of course. As the three are making their escape they hijack Ms Colbert as a member of the party to stifle her screams as this would have given away their escape. Ms Colbert eventually finds the woman inside her and her soul mate, played by Herbert Marshall, recognizes this after a slinky waterfall bath. To help this line along DeMille has a chimp steal her clothes during the bath. This results in her being ""dressed"" in large leaves and a scarf for much of the movie. Not Mr DeMille's best effort, by any measure, but certainly not a waste of time to watch. ""The Crusades"", with Loretta Young, Henry Wilcoxon, and Ian Keith is an excellent movie if not anywhere near historically accurate. But all three of the actors mentioned do superb jobs in their roles. Ms Young as Berengeria-Princess of Navarre, Henry Wilcoxon as Richard, The Lion Hearted, King of England, and Ian Keith as Saladin the Sultan of Islam. One thing that struck me about this movie is how, even after all these centuries, very little has changed in the middle east. Christians and Muslims arguing/fighting over Jerusalem and associated sites. The movie is, naturally, based on/set in the Holy Crusades. This movie was set in the first Crusade around the year 1095. Also playing his normally evil role is Joseph Schildkraut as Conrad-The Marquis of Montferrat (also see him as Fouquet in The Man In The Iron Mask-1939) ""Union Pacific"" stars Joel McCrea, Barbara Stanwyck, Robert Preston, and Anthony Quinn. I was most impressed by Ms Stanwyck playing Mollie Monahan and Robert Preston as Dick Allen. Mr Preston normally played ""good guys"" but in ""Union Pacific"" he plays a morally conflicted part that, in the end, tries to do the right thing. All said this is one of my favorite collections and I strongly recommend you buy it. Especially at the prices I have being seeing on Amazon.",1490918400,,3521,4.671497584541063
