8450620,1,6302796733,"Very disappointed. Quality of video was poor. Virtually no mention (less than one minute) of the destroyer involvement in the Persian Gulf War (Desert Storm), despite this being in the description and on the VHS sleeve. Even the destroyer depicted on the VHS sleeve, DDG-13, was only shown briefly at the beginning. This should be labelled as WWII destroyers because that's all this video is about. No mention of any post WWII class of destroyer, save the Burke at the very end of the tape. I had purchased this hoping to glean some information on Spruance class destroyers, which have all been discarded, save the Paul F. Foster, which has been so heavily modified as a ""test ship,"" it is hardly a Spruance anymore. Was no video of Sprunace class destroyers ever produced? I have scoured the Internet without success. It's all Burke, Burke, Burke!",1436400000,,848,4.855172413793103
