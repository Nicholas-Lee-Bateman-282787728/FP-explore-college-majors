6486481,5,B00LH192CI,"This plays on US blu-ray players!
Much to my surprise, when I ordered this from Amazon (because the product details said ""All Regions"") I found it to actually be Region 4, which is South America. I contacted Amazon and because of the chance someone filling the order picked up the wrong one, another was over-nighted to me. Alas!! Also Region 4. I was desperate to get this Hallmark movie to add to my collection. I opened it anyway, popped it into my blu-ray player, AND IT PLAYS!! Clearly!  In English! In it's entirety!
Anyone waiting for the American version will probably be overjoyed to have this!!

6486484,4,B00LH192CI,"The other brief reviews do not give a clear idea of what this film is about. I hope this helps, albeit with some plot spoilers.
An Old Fashioned Christmas is a SEQUEL to An Old Fashioned Thanksgiving which is set in the latter 1800s, a while after the American Civil War, and based (apparently only VERY LOOSELY based, using the title, the character-names and general setting, but with a strong period feeling of Alcott!) on a short story by Louisa May Alcott (the famous author of Little Women), in which a daughter and estranged mother argue over family ties. The Amazon (USA) plot summary says: Isabella Caldwell is a high-society woman in late-1800s New York. When Isabellas estranged daughter Mary becomes ill and is too proud to ask her mother for assistance, Marys daughter, Tilly, takes it upon herself to contact her grandmother and plead for help. Isabellas arrival causes an upheaval in many lives, but may also lead to reconciliation within the family. One reviewer adds: [include] a little romance, a disapproving neighbour, sisterly jealousy, a scandalous past, poverty, scarlet fever, and a rambunctious little boy, all woven around the Thanksgiving season and you have a story that will hold your interest. In one scene the young widow accuses her mother of having married her father (who was quite a bit older) for his money and only had a child (herself) so that his older children from a previous marriage could not contest the will.
Both films star Jacqueline Bisset as the grandmother, Isabella, and Kristopher Turner as Gad, the love-interest for Tilly.
Most reviewers prefer the Thanksgiving film.
An Old Fashioned Christmas happens to be set around Christmas, and ends with a Christmas dinner and includes some carol singing (including Jingle Bells that had not been written at this time!), although NOT the Christmas dinner that had been planned. (However this is a green-leafed, sunshine-filled summery version of late-December in rainy Dublin: the film was NOT made in the actual season. Alas.)
But the story is NOT about Christmas. Instead it is a Henry James-like tale of American wealth, democracy, and no-nonsense, versus traditional British, classism, complicated by an Irish setting.
Wealthy American grandmother, Isabella, invites herself to visit and spend Christmas with the Earl of Shannon, the Irish Poet Laureate. She hopes he can help her granddaughter, Matilda, known as Tilly, progress in her attempts to become a writer.
Unfortunately, the Poet Laureate has suffered a stroke, and although his intentions are good, he is unable to do or say much. He spends his time sitting and reading, and making quiet negative noises about his scheming wife and rascal son. However, when Isabella shows some of Tillys journals to the Earl, although at first he says he is unable to help her because he has lost contact with publishers, following his stroke, he recognises Tillys talent as a writer, and gives his encouragement for her to pursue this as a serious career or vocation. (Tilly quotes poetry, and is besotted by Lord Byrons life and poetry. But it is not clear, apart from her travel journal, what she is writing, or might write.)
The Earls wife, Lady Shannon, however, has spent the Earls money. She has accepted Isabelles request to visit the Earl, and have Christmas at the castle, because she hopes that her handsome devil-may-care, wastrel, playboy son and heir will marry heiress Tilly, and her money will restore the fortune of the earldom. The earls son tries to romance Tilly, and she finds him attractive. But she has been engaged for the last 2 years to an American, known as Gad, who has been patiently waiting for Tilly to end her European travels.
Moreover, she is the daughter of Isabellas daughter and a stable boy, the (relatively) poor son of an Irish farmer. Angry that her daughter would marry for love, and marry beneath her social status, Isabella had cut all ties with her daughter and husband. But after the Irish husband dies, Isabella intervenes, taking young adult Tilly away on her Grand Tour.
Tilly writes letters to her mother, in America, and hopes, while she is in Dublin, to find and meet her Irish grandfather, and establish a reconciliation between Isabella and her grandfather. With the help of the Earls son, who has admitted his mothers would-be marriage schemes, this is (surprisingly easily) accomplished, but Isabella and the Irish grandfather quarrel. She thinks he is a mere farmer, and he blames her for being snobbish and hurting, instead of helping, his son and his family.
Meanwhile, Tillys American fianc, Gad, is in Manchester, and, with some complications, is invited to spend Christmas in the Irish castle with the Earl. Rivalry quickly erupts between the Earls son and Tillys fianc, and they come to blows. Tilly is unable to make up her mind, and the fianc leaves. But with some encouragement from her Irish grandfather, Tilly speaks her mind to scheming Lady Shannon, resists the marriage proposal from the playboy son (who sees Tilly as a possible muse for his own writing, rather than wanting to encourage Tilly to be a writer), and 
 the Christmas dinner is NOT at the castle but at the farm; not with the Earls family, but with newly established warm feelings between Isabella and the grandfather, and with renewed marriage intentions between Tilly and her fianc. A multiplicity of happy endings.

6486485,4,B00LH192CI,"Just a note for those of you looking for a DVD of this movie which will work on American DVD players.  I found a version available on Amazon which is part of a collection of Christmas movies, so it's a bit more expensive, but it is a way to own it and view it.  In Amazon, search: Holiday Romance Collection Movie 10 Pack.

I enjoyed this movie, but not as much as An Old Fashioned Thanksgiving. It's still a fun watch though!",1450915200,11,426,4.170731707317073
6486486,4,B00LH192CI,"I don't have this DVD because for some odd reason it is only to be seen in Europe not in the states. Jacquelyn Bissets  other DVD movie called Old Fashioned Thanks Giving can be seen in the states so why  has this not been made yet to be able to be seen in the states and this movie came out about 5 years ago. You think they would have done the same for this one by now.

My question also is ""When will they make this DVD so we Americans can watch it also""?",1449360000,5,458,3.851063829787234

It's my own fault for not seeing it, but it's incredibly frustrating that DVD's are being sold that won't work on most DVD players.
