2640329,4,B000HT387G,"The concept is pretty simple -- Robin-Hood-style pirates on Mars, in an unspecified future time when the whole planet is covered in seas.

And fortunately its simplicity is part of ""The Mars Daybreak's"" charm -- comedy, plenty of action, magical necklaces and big underwater mechas. And while some of the characters never quite endear themselves (the snotty Vestemona), the imaginative underwater adventures and likable pirates are plenty of fun.

Mars' economy is crumbling, and both food and work are hard to come by. Former dockworker Gram gets swept off a city-ship while rescuing a pal. His necklace starts glowing, and he is scooped up by a mysterious ""round buckler"" (read: underwater mecha). Unfortunately Earth Forces attacks him, thinking that he's with the pirate submarine Ship of Aurora -- and soon Gram finds himself as the Ship of Aurora's newest pirate.

He quickly becomes invaluable to the crew (for his super-powerful Round Buckler AND his brilliant cooking skills), but is unaware that a childhood friend named Vestemona -- now an Earth Forces cadet -- has returned to Mars and is obsessed with getting him to mend his ways.

But when Gram's necklace is revealed to be a Mars Aborigine treasure, the Ship of Aurora finds itself on the trail of an ancient treasure -- which is also wanted by cruel mercenary pirate Kubernes. And they have plenty of problems already -- ghost ships, seaborne brides, disastrous parties, mutinies, idiotic communists, baby rays, and the Earth President's daughter, who is smitten with Gram and insists on joining the crew (much to the Mars president's chagrin).

But when Vestemona's obsession with Gram leads her to disobey orders, she ends up pronounced dead and captured by Kubernes. But as she and Gram settle their differences, the Ship of Aurora is threatened by Earth Forces -- and it may the end of the line for the jolly pirates, unless Gram can save them.

""The Mars Daybreak"" has no deep message to impart, no tormented heroes, no realistic action, no complex storylines, and (admittedly) not a hugely imaginative concept. But its lack pf pretensions is one of the reasons it's such an endearing series -- it's a simple adventure yarn with floating cities and mecha.

Along the way it develops a plot arc -- mysterious artifacts, treasure, Martian history, and a villain (Kubernes) who actually seems halfway competent (unlike the idiot president) and has a Round Buckler shaped like a mermaid. Lots of underwater battles, killer construction equipment, sword fights and battles with Earth Forces. In fact, the final few episodes become downright grim, as Gram and Vestemona becomes the only things between the pirates and death.

But fortunately ""Mars Daybreak"" never takes itself entirely seriously -- most of the episodes focus on the quirky pirates. We get lots of comic relief, the required onsen episode with required double-entendres (""Wow, I guess mine IS twice as big as yours""), some haunted-house spookiness and lots of good-natured internal clashes (the captain becomes obsessed with a hit-and-run sub).

Gram is a likable hero: mellow, friendly, and honest about having no life goals except making enough money to live on. The pirates are a colourful bunch as well -- stern but kindly Captain Elizabeth, stoic Sea Witch Ester, vaguely immature Aki, timid psychic Megumi, chilly pilot Yagami, and a talking cat and porpoise. Even the Earth Forces officers are well-done (including the aptly-named Captain Doolittle).

The one flaw? Vestemona redeems herself somewhat late in the series, but before that she's a self-righteous, snotty brat who despises everything. She and Gram eventually fall in love, but she practically stalks him across Mars first -- and tries to convince him to go back to being starving and unemployed.

Fortunately Vestemona is not enough to taint the rest of ""The Mars Daybreak,"" which succeeds in being a gung-ho sci-fi story with an action-comedy twist. Definitely worth seeing.",1231286400,,3977,5.1503875968992245

2640331,3,B000HT387G,"I swear, the next time someone puts a 5 star rating on a show like this, I'm going to rate it 1 star just to bring the universe back into balance.  What value is a 5 star rating when it gets put on everything?

The story is, Mars has been terraformed (don't ask how, they don't say) and now its a water world (don't ask how, they don't say - did something go wrong?  You can terraform a world, so you cover it completely in water?) and life is oppressive in the massive floating city ships where most people scrape out a living.

The show is not bad.  The Mech designs are pretty standard with a couple new ideas to account for underwater combat.

The characters are ok, no one jumps out as very compelling but the whole bunch of them are well fleshed out.

The show lacks the usual topless and panty scenes that Japan anime tends to have, which indicates that this was more of a show for kids, but then the translators put in enough swearing too (the talking Dolphin (don't ask how, they don't say...) says ""Son of a Bit** quite a bit) so its not a show for young kids either.

The first third of the story doesn't seem to have any real plot to it, but then a couple stories start to weave through and it leads... somewhere.  There is an ending, but the lack of detail leads me to think this really was a kids show.

The only reason I didn't give it 2 stars is the amount of content.  There are 6 DVD's with a whole lot of episodes, so you get a lot of content.",1223251200,6,1462,4.112676056338028
2640332,5,B000HT387G,"Mars Daybreak is amusing and pure entertainment, well worth adding to your collection.  This more than a mecha series, there is plenty of backstabbing and double-cross to keep the story going between battles. It is Robin Hood on Mars with government and corporate villains galore, along with a few mercenaries and bumbling villians.",1185321600,6,332,5.264150943396227
2640333,5,B000HT387G,"Excellent story and plot, has its funny moments, and awesome mecha fighting. To me for such a short series compared to other mecha series, like the Gundam series, it stood up there with them.",1180915200,,191,4.647058823529412
2640334,4,B000HT387G,"I took a chance on this set after watching the first two episodes on youtube and boy did I make the right decision. If you want a fun ride thats action packed with cool characters, then this series is for you. If you like a series that has heart with comedy, again this series is for you. The animation style is good and unlike some shows you don't notice when the animators take a day off. I hate it when one volume looks spectacular and the next looks like [...]. You won't find that here. Although the animation isn't ever stellar, its good, consistantly. As for music, it has a great up beat opening that immediatly gets you going and involved. The ending song is inspirational reminding you that even though this is a fun ride, it is moving toward a deeper place. As for the music during the show, its average I guess, until a battle sequence which then moves from average to emotionally charged. I also think the writing is well done. Its not perfect, but where as most anime series have a fair share of filler episodes, for a 26 episode series, Mars Daybreak only had 2 in my oppinion. Yes, some episodes moved the story farther than others but all in all, every episode had action and/or more character development as not to be boring. Speaking of characters I believe this is the strength of the series. Although we only go very deep into 2 of the characters, most everyone had their own personality and problems, and for a show that easily had over 20 characters, I think it is a job well done. Now even though Ive spoken very highly of the writing it is by no means perfect. If I had one complaint it would be that sometimes they reveal something big and then they don't get back to it for awhile, so be patient. When I watched it on youtube it was in japanese with english subtitles, but the english dub is very good as well and preferred.  As for price, $50 is amazing for this set. With 6 single volumes priced at $20 or more, thats $120 easy. A savings of $70 or more is awesome. True, you don't get any extras, but for this price who really needs them.  In conclusion, this collection and series is a keeper and one I will watch over over again for years to come.

If you want a more in depth review about characters and storylines then check out my single volume reviews, but watch out, after volume one their are some spoilers.",1171584000,20,2345,4.3493150684931505

8141032,5,B000HT387G,The name is odd when you see it. But its a beautiful well written story with everything a person could dream of action drama excitement filled with turns left n right you won't expect in a anime. I brought it bast on something new but I got into it the story begans with a simple man who doing some raiding to make ends meat then progress to him being a fighter n finding himself this anime the charaters all have heart n shows what they would do for one another how the main person in this anime finds love and what he will do to be with the one he loves I love the ending as well I wasn't disappointed this will keep you on the edge of your seat the voice cast is awesome the anime is great its beautiful and well worth buying I am not going to give the story away but you will have to take a chance buy it and see for yourself what I am talking about some anime in the end kills the story this all comes together perfect you will luv watching this as much as I have .,1286064000,,970,3.9289340101522843
8141033,3,B000HT387G,"Mars Daybreak is not a bad anime. It has some very interesting ideas, including underwater pirates and forbidden technology on Mars. The problem is the execution. The show has no real tension so no action sequence or life threatening situation feels genuine. The objectives and treasures of the show don't seem all that important or valuable. The plot twists are all in the ""meh"" category. The villains and other opponents don't seem all that dangerous and the romances real and potential all feel tepid. When you add the fact that several characters feel unnecessary and that the potentially interesting backgrounds of several characters and plots aren't dealt with then you end up with a show with a lot of potential but a lukewarm delivery.",1274745600,,743,5.0
8141034,5,B000HT387G,"Mars of the future has become a flooded, ice-covered planet where humanity lives in drifting city-ships. The economy has turned bad since the end of an off-world war reduced demand for water, the planet's main export, making work hard to get for Gram and his friends, and governmental corruption only worsens the situation. The environment makes a perfect setting for pirates using futuristic submarines, who regularly raid the city-ships for supplies. The most renowned and feared of the pirate vessels is the Ship of Aurora, which makes a habit of reselling its booty cheap so that it can be redistributed to less fortunate folk. Such a problem do the pirates pose that the Earth government, which still controls Mars, has dispatched an elite team of fresh military recruits to help deal with their threat. The story follows Gram River who joins the pirate ship Aurora and his ex girl friend Vestemona Lauren who is part of the military out to get Gram and the crew of the Aurora.

I really enjoyed this anime. Though the overall story wasn't original it did bring a few new ideas. For example, Mars covered in water, and the design of the Mecha used in the anime. The story also did a great job mixing the elements of drama, action, romance, and a little comedy. The characters were also great, Gram River, Chrysalis Milch, Enora Taft and all the rest. They brought the anime to life. The animation was done by BONES. I was disappointed with them, after all their the ones who did RahXephon, Wolf's Rain, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Eureka Seven. Though it was still good, it just didn't live up to their standards. Another small problem I had was the music, which lacked emotion to add to the series.

Overall a very good anime, that's worth checking out",1240704000,,1755,4.750819672131148
8141035,4,B000HT387G,"Having no expectations at the outset, Mars Daybreak turned out to be a refreshing, fun anime with colorful characters and a plot that is generally lighthearted but most entertaining.  The story's concept centers around a young man named Gram who falls into the clutches of the most notorious pirates on planet Mars (the setting of this story), pirates who possess a bad rap despite their Robinhood-like nature (looking out for the interests of others).  And these are not your run-of-the-mill everyday pirates--all pirate characters (human, animal, and alien alike) are quite unique with interesting personalities, skills, and traits.  Without going into any great detail, the story is chalk full of mecha action, swash-buckling sword fighting, high-speed ship chases, espionage and double-crosses, plenty of comedy, and  deep-seated romance.  I thoroughly enjoyed this series because of the adventurous plot that centers around a mysterious Mars secret treasure that Gram unknowingly holds the key to opening, the lighthearted nature of the action (no gory blood or extreme violence), the sincere development of some of the main characters in the story, the colorful and well-drawn animation, and feel-good feelings one comes away with after watching any number of the episodes (not to mention the great music in the opening and closing songs).  I would highly recommend this anime for most viewers (as I am a fairly new anime viewer, here is a brief rundown of anime series I have completed and my personal ratings to provide some relevance to this review: Ruroni Kenshin--9.3 out of 10; Basilisk--6.5 out of 10; Full Metal Alchemist--8.7 out of ten; Neon Genesis Evangelion--7.3 out of 10; Mars Daybreak--8.5 out of 10).",1231545600,3,1723,5.293040293040293
