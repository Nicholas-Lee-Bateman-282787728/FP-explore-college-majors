8207533,4,B000T28G0U,"After looking forward to The Prince of Tennis second season, we were disappointed to find out that the Japanese opening/ending themes were the same that were included on the first two volumes (from first season; ""Future"" and ""You Got Game"", instead of second season's ""Driving Myself"" and ""Keep Your Style"" [and alternate end ""Walk On""]). Actually, it's a bit disconcerting overall that even when you watch the Japanese version, the American (instrumental) opening/ending are shown as well as the English title screen, and the Japanese opening/closings are stuck in the Extras on Disc 3, and they're not even subtitled...not to mention that the Japanese promos on Volumes 2 and 3 are the same. Also, not sure why Volume 3 has only 12 episodes when the others each had 13. We LOVE The Prince of Tennis - please do a better job with Volume 4.",1193875200,2,840,4.840277777777778
