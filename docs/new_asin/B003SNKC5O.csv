8404521,5,B003SNKC5O,This is a good book about the nurses on Bataan during the siege of the Philippines at the start of WWII.,1523404800,,104,4.0
8404522,2,B003SNKC5O,it was kind of interesting if you know nothing about Bataan but it was so short and very scattered.  I was incredibly disappointed.  it should have been free.  it's the only thing I have ever purchased from Amazon that I felt was just terrible.  I will screen purchases more closely from now on. terrible documentary.,1439078400,,317,4.709090909090909
8404523,5,B003SNKC5O,"Well done on a group of women that were in many ways over looked. The men of Bataan aptly named them angels. This film gives a touch of the idea of the brave, courageous and loyal help they gave our fighting men and later civilians in the camps in the Philippines. Everyone in the Philippines fought hard, suffered at the hands of the Japanese during the war. It is great to respect for their loyalty recognized.",1408147200,,412,4.434210526315789
8404524,1,B003SNKC5O,"After having just read a book about the nurses in Bataan, I was very excited to see a documentary about these amazing women and eager to see and hear footage of them.  This documentary does nothing to honor or inform the audience about the nurses except mention them in passing.  Instead the documentary describes the military action on this island.  If you're primary interest in watching this was for the history of the nurses, don't waste your time or money to rent.  If you have general interest in the battles of Bataan, maybe you'll get something from it, but overall it's just bad.  I never write these kinds of reviews either!",1312416000,6,634,4.675675675675675
8404525,3,B003SNKC5O,"Some good footage but I thought, by the title, that this would be more about the nurses. Little detail is actually said about them. A great deal of information is available so some could have been included. And, though most people would not know, I expect the narrator of a film about Bataan to take a minute to learn how to pronounce Bataan correctly. It's not a two sylable word Ba-taan. It's three sylables Ba-ta-an (accent on the an).",1297555200,2,438,4.556962025316456
