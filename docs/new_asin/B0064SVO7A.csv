8492900,1,B0064SVO7A,I was looking forward to this set of DVDs but after watching the first disk I have to agree with the other reviewers. The last episode on the first disk has the audio for the battle of Crete but the video is about the Burma campaign which is what the listed episode is about. Totally unacceptable. The most of basic application of quality control should have caught this error. I am now reluctant to even bother with the remaining two discs. I can see why the price is so low on this product. It could have been a great set to add to my collection of war DVDs but I am now considering sending the product back to Amazon. Very disappointed.,1336780800,,639,4.289256198347108
8492901,3,B0064SVO7A,"As others have said ""Burma"" episode has ""CRETE"" soundtrack. Disk 2 the menu bar stays on screen during playback. The footage is real good and if not for those problems this would be an excellent set.",1336348800,,199,4.555555555555555
8492902,1,B0064SVO7A,"Wow, this product should not be put out. Less than Blu-ray quality would be forgivable if the product was actually done right. Instead disc two has the menu bar up the whole time. That is is the biggest of numerous problems with the this three disc set. Audio is wrong. The third disc is about the the Atlantic- why? this is titled the Pacific Campaign, why have a whole disc on the Atlantic. This product is terrible and should not have been released on the Blu-ray format.",1336262400,3,474,4.459770114942529
8492903,1,B0064SVO7A,"In chapter on Burma, the pictures cover the Burma theatre but the sound appears to be covering Crete in the Med.  The other disc covering Gilbert Islands through Mount Hot Rocks the submenu remains on during all these presentations and is so distracting the it makes that disk unacceptable.  This is unacceptable and I intend on returning the disks.",1336176000,,349,4.898305084745763
8492904,1,B0064SVO7A,Totally unacceptable. Where is the quality control and attention to detail?  As the other reviewers stated the Burma episode has the wrong soundtrack :(  Why is Amazon still selling this product?,1335225600,3,195,5.258064516129032
8492905,1,B0064SVO7A,"Show is good of what I could watch.  The last episode of the 1st disk had the TOTAL WRONG audio, audio was about Britian vs Itallian forces on Crete, video was what it was suppose to be the Pacific war.  2nd disk clicked ""play all"" it starts up and video playing and audio BUT there is a menu bar across the bottom of the screen saying ""main menu and episode selection"", skipped forword still there.

Of what I watched it was very educational and well done, that gets 5 stars.

So back it goes. :(",1334966400,3,497,4.2
8492906,2,B0064SVO7A,"While the combat footage and commentaries are good, Disk 1 of this set had the sound for the Battle of Crete on the Battle for Burma, which was less than amusing. My presumption is that this set was rushed into production and someone didn't check the disk for errors such as this. As the Battle for Crete is on the next set, I am curious as to whether the Burma soundtrack is to be found in that set....",1334880000,8,403,4.17948717948718
