4579459,1,B0055PK77Q,"You will love this video - if you enjoy seasickness!  The camera moved around so much, up, down, over. I can't believe someone produced this and said ""yep, this is ready to release to the world"". I give this guy points for try to show something other than a path, but that's about it. I watched about 15 mins of this and stopped, afraid it was going to give me a headache. Not worth the $",1324512000,2,388,4.105263157894737
4579460,5,B0055PK77Q,"I really enjoyed this. You really feel like you're on a foot trek through Yosemite! You don't need the aggravation of driving, traffic, parking and camping fees. Just press play and be transported. The production values are unbelievable! The music, the photography and the editing all work together so beautifully! I also watch this with my own music over and it works equally well. The subtlety of the transitions just makes this a wonderful ambient journey. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Yosemite or just scenic beauty.",1316304000,3,536,5.033707865168539

4579462,5,B0055PK77Q,"I like using this video for my workouts for a number of reasons. The camera angle is at the right height so I get the feeling I'm really moving through the scenery, over logs, across rocks, etc. The pacing feels about right, never too slow or too fast. The trails shots aren't boring, but constantly changing from trees, to meadows, to rocky paths, to waterfalls. And the music is engaging and professionally done, although usually I put on my own music and switch it over to the nature sounds track. And I like that it has a long cool down segment at the end for stretching and relaxing. It's a pretty good deal at $15. And if you love Yosemite  as much as I do, I would highly recommend this one. I've paid a lot more for other workout videos that weren't half as good.",1308700800,5,771,4.317241379310345
8458568,3,B0055PK77Q,the walks are too slow for a stepper. Would be ok for a treadmill pacing on very slow.,1440892800,,86,3.8333333333333335
8458569,1,B0055PK77Q,"I was looking for a video to download to my Fire to exercise with and came across this video. I thought it would work for me while I used the stationary bike. Well... I was wrong. The quality was poor. It jumped around and the music was corny, especially when the camera would pan a scenic view at the end of a trail. I think the camera person enjoyed watching the lady at the end of the final destination.",1342828800,,406,4.151898734177215
8458570,3,B0055PK77Q,"I am so glad that I purchased the inexpensive digital copy rather than shelling out the extra $ for the DVD because I would have been utterly disappointed at the price.  This is a beautifully-shot film and the scenery is unbeatable for an indoor workout, but the pace is that of a leisurely hike and not one that I find compatible with training on indoor cardio equipment.  If you are planning to walk or ride at a snail's pace, then this might work well for you.  If you like to move briskly, I would recommend looking elsewhere.  I will probably just end up playing this on my computer while working at my desk.  The views are gorgeous and make the digital copy worth the minimal price.",1340496000,,688,4.428571428571429
8458571,2,B0055PK77Q,"The camera moves too slow for running or jogging. The frequent scene transitions destroy any immersion you might otherwise experience. The bouncing of the camera is annoying, if only because it won't match your own pace. The panning left and right and stopping altogether is also irritating -- I'd rather the camera stay pointed forward, because after all that's the direction my head is pointing. And keep the camera moving, please. Because I'm not stopping.",1334966400,,459,5.133333333333334
8458572,3,B0055PK77Q,"The scenery was beautiful and interesting.  However, the video wasn't produced with a steady motion.  There is large up and down motion throughout almost the whole video.  This is very distracting to me.  I like to have a steady foward pace with no up and down motion of the camera.  Also, the movement didn't seem fast enough for a run.  It seemed more like a walk or brisk walk to me. I do appreciate the good scenery, but I'm looking for a video with steady forward motion (very little bumps or up and down motion) at a running speed.",1333497600,2,537,4.373737373737374
8458573,1,B0055PK77Q,"I was really looking forward to viewing this. I could not stand more then a few seconds viewing. If you don't mind feeling you are walking during a massive earthquake, I guess you may like. Too bad because it could have been great if whoever shot the video would have been more thought into how to shoot it properly. I will stick with Scenic Trex videos. Everything else seems like a joke.",1332633600,,389,4.416666666666667
8458574,5,B0055PK77Q,"This is a workout for nature lovers. If you love spectacular mountain scenery, waterfalls, ponds, bubbling brooks, deer in meadows, lots of long paths through forests with rocks---lots of rocks of all sizes, it may entice you to get off the couch and start moving---how ever fast you decide to move. It works with a heavy-duty session and just as well with a slower walk-through-the-woods pace.  I really enjoyed it. I also found it motivating, although there is absolutely no narrative, and relaxing at the same time. It's nature, after all, and you can't beat being able to enjoy a big dose of the outdoors while you are getting fit.

It has been years since I've gone to Yosemite. I may not get a chance to go back. This is definitely a great way to visit. In fact, if I went in person, I probably would be time-limited and would do all my viewing by car, never even having an opportunity to see these sites or even knowing they were there.

I got a great workout, even though it's only 45 minutes. There is what seemed to be a fairly long cool-down, but that was okay too. I wanted to stand under those waterfalls and cool off. I wanted to jump in those ponds and splash around. That was a great way to relax before having to face the stresses of life again.

Workout benefits for me were excellent, because it was a walk that you can do at your own speed. I was using my treadmill and usually don't work up a sweat on it. This time I did.

Music was more like sounds, pleasant sounds, easy to ignore or enjoy---your choice. It added to the experience for me. Others will want to use their own music, of course.",1330041600,3,1615,4.37
8458575,1,B0055PK77Q,"This seems to have been shot with a helmet cam. It is very jerky and amateurish. It was distracting when we first previewed it. It made me nauseous and dizzy when I tried to watch it while on the treadmill. Also, at least 5 or 6 times, the camera faces right into the sun. For the last 10 minutes or more, the videographer must have gotten tired. All he does it sit and look at a stream. I would say don't waste your money.

8458576,5,B0055PK77Q,"I really enjoy this DVD. In reading the reviews about the motion sickness, I was a little concerned, but I use it while on the treadmill and have had no problems. It moves along at a good pace and the scenery is wonderful.",1327881600,4,222,4.186046511627907
8458577,5,B0055PK77Q,"Let's face it, walking on a treadmill can be boring. Sure you can watch TV or read but I wanted to switch up the routine a little bit so I ordered this video to download to my Kindle Fire. It's great fun to watch as you are walking and does make the time go by faster. I wish there were more available for download.",1327795200,,315,3.9375
