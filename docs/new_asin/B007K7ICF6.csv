8518713,5,B007K7ICF6,"Some of the interviews can be a bit difficult to understand, but then my hearing is not the best and those English gentlemen were quite old .
Regardless, I found this program to be very good, well worth watching and the old footage very interesting.",1456531200,,249,4.555555555555555
8518714,5,B007K7ICF6,"I donated this to a school library - excellent.  I felt the torture, love and pain of the horse.",1428796800,2,96,4.052631578947368
8518715,4,B007K7ICF6,"We all seem to think that war is fought with tanks, airplanes and trucks fed by gasoline and diesel fuel. That was the case since WWII.But for WWI  the automobile was just becoming common, farm tractors were not common and ninety percent of all power was still provided by horses and oxen. England confiscated 140,000 horse within two months of the start of the war. For England, the Fordson tractor had to replace the horse on English farms or else the country would starve.  The Englished used over 1,000,000 horses during the entire WWI. It was the horse that provided the supplies of food, guns and ammunition to troops that fought the war.

The photos commonly seen of WWi are of men and trenches but their supply was by horse in extreme conditions. Cruel conditions that is only seen in wartime. This movie shows the sacrifice made by horse owners in England and beyond. It shows the cruel conditions under which the horse did its job. It also shows the end disregard of the value of this ""disposable"" soldier after the war ended. Of the 1,000,000 horses used by the English during WWi less than 100,000 returned home.",1417824000,,1124,4.666666666666667
8518716,5,B007K7ICF6,"This is a respectful presentation of a difficult subject  the ""recruitment"" of horses needed for use during WWI.
The process went from a necessary/noble idea, to a disastrous/heartbreaking reality. A well-documented and filmed video, focusing on one of the many hard details most of us are never even aware of, which exist during large, world-changing events.",1379808000,5,359,5.410714285714286
8518717,4,B007K7ICF6,"Loved the movie and would recommend it, the only negative is the ""Brit-o-centric"" view of the war. Naming Brit battles/victories as the turning point in the war when indeed it was the US that was the game changer and I believe that the French were involved in some minor way...LOL!  Beyond the British ego stuff and it is really informative and quite good. Rule Britannia, for horses anyway .... enjoy.",1375315200,6,402,4.742857142857143
8518718,5,B007K7ICF6,"They gave their lives, they could be Messiahs in their sacrifice for God and country. Fortunately the animals who gave their lives in WWI have been recognized and a tribute paid to them.",1367280000,4,186,4.666666666666667
