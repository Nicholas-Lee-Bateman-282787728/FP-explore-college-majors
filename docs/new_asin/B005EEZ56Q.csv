4665139,5,B005EEZ56Q,"I've enjoyed this show since the beginning, and considering it's a kids show, I've always found it to have some surprising maturity and depth. And the things that really annoyed me about some of the early Dr. Who episodes (e.g. fart jokes and childish ""gross-out"" moments) were always present but less annoying in the Sarah Jane Adventures, because of the context and target audience. Well, I'm happy to say that season 4 not only does away with childish gross-out-ness (for the most part), the stories have a more serious and mature tone than seasons past, with more emphasis on character (although they have always been very good in this respect). Also some noticeably improved acting from Tommy Knight, and very solid performances from the other two. Even a moment from Rani that moved me to tears. Clyde, as always, is my favorite, and he has a great season here. And Elisabeth Sladen, of course, is simply stunning as the Sarah Jane we've known and loved for so many years. She will be very missed.

There was only one episode I didn't care for (and it was a huge disappointment, being the one I was looking forward to most), but it still had some fine moments. All five of the other episodes were truly stellar - much better than I was expecting even after three very good seasons. In fact, I honestly think with this season, the Sarah Jane Adventures has finally arrived - yes, it is AS GOOD as Dr. Who, and considerably better than some of it.

Even if you haven't watched previous seasons, do yourself a favor and grab season 4. Dr. Who fans won't be disappointed.

And yes, there is a season 5, currently airing in the UK. Obviously there will be no more, so I hope it lives up to the very high standard set in this season.",1321660800,19,1733,4.548076923076923

4665148,4,B005EEZ56Q,I like this series. Matt Smith is in one episode. I gave it 4 stars because it won't play in my older Blu-ray player. It does play in the newer player.,1476057600,,151,3.903225806451613

4665150,5,B005EEZ56Q,What can I say. It is a Dr Who spinoff geared toward teenagers. Showing you don't have to be an adult or have a TARDIS. Plus it makes teens also know they shouldn't take unnessary risks and the show is fun!!,1474416000,,207,4.073170731707317

4665155,5,B005EEZ56Q,"It is a rare show that can manage to be family-friendly, exciting, and profound all at once. The Sarah Jane Adventures is all of these and so much more. Each season grows in depth and pushes new boundaries. The only drawback is the foreknowledge that the show ends abruptly with the passing of its extraordinary lead and anchor, Elisabeth Sladen. That being said, do not let its tragic end keep you from watching the gang and their exciting, and sometimes poignant, adventures.",1473033600,,477,4.829268292682927

There are about 6 stories per season, each keeping you glued to the screen to find out what happens next. The 11th Doctor, Matt Smith, also makes an appearance in the 4th season, which made for a fun episode. I would definitely recommend this show to all fans of Doctor Who, as I feel they will enjoy it, even if they are an adult.",1471737600,,429,4.308641975308642

4665166,4,B005EEZ56Q,"I have enjoyed The Sarah Jane Adventures, but it's not as good as Dr. Who. However, watching the 2 episodes featuring David Tennant and Matt Smith, respectively, definitely made it worth watching. :)",1468195200,,199,5.0606060606060606

4665173,5,B005EEZ56Q,"If you liked "" Dr Who"" you will probably like ""Sarah Jane"" as it's the same craziness and the old-time monsters of the Tom Baker era ( although the photography is better), and her teen companions are worthy of her. It's all happy endings, of course, but absorbing enough getting there. I quite enjoyed this series although I am no longer in the ""Child"" category. If you like easy, interesting entertainment you will probably enjoy this series.",1466380800,,443,4.766233766233766

4665213,4,B005EEZ56Q,"This is the best season of The Sarah Jane Adventures so far.  The season is bookended by stories showing how close the characters have become.  I've seen a few of the classic Dr. Who stories with Jo Grant so it was good to see her again.  Also, Matt Smith makes an appearance.  This show is worthy to be viewed by any fan of the Who universe because even though The Doctor is in only a few of the episodes, his influence is felt throughout.",1401062400,,440,4.2023809523809526
4665214,5,B005EEZ56Q,"The extremely talented Elisabeth Sladen brought so much life to the show and put so much of herself into it. There was something almost magical about Lis, something unreachable and raw, a sort of acting that just came naturally and was performed with such a passion. From her time with the third and fourth doctors in the 70s to having her own spinoff in 2007 she has managed to brilliantly enchant millions of children across multiple generations over a span of 40 years. She is hands down the best Doctor Who companion, so much so that she was given her own series, and portrayed it so beautifully. If there was chaos and loss, then you could feel her pain and sorrow, and it burrowed itself into the deep depths of our hearts, leaving footprints that would last forever. She made everything, from creatures found in the shadows of our nightmares to the brilliance and wonders of the universe, so real and you felt like you were there. Unlike the alieness associated with the Doctor, Sarah Jane, like Sladen herself, was generally warm and loving. You couldn't help falling in love with the show along with all of the characters within it. Sarah Jane inspired the characters in the show as well and gave them better lives, from Clyde and Rani to her adopted son, Luke. Sarah Jane had this familiar and comforting sense about her and her presence made you feel at ease, no matter the situation. The slight catch in her voice as she confronted the latest intergalactic terror could transport you. It's hard to explain really but she made me feel like as though I had known her my entire life. She brought the world of Doctor Who to life and played the role with such conviction and truth and she never seemed to age, either in looks or spirit. I have found no fault within the series and will, with certainity, announce that this is the best show that I have ever seen and has exceeded my  expectations. Sarah Jane Smith, the Doctor's one true assistant, will always be remembered and never forgotten. Rest in peace, the remarkable Elisabeth Sladen.",1397347200,3,2049,4.644628099173554
4665215,5,B005EEZ56Q,"Having never seen the series I didn't know what to expect.  I actually enjoyed it and even though it was a children's series I didn't feel like it was dumbed down.  I knew that David Tennants doctor had been in the series but I was surprised and overjoyed that Matt Smiths Doctor also made an appearance.  It was a good story and to see not one but TWO old companions was like a school reunion of my own!
I highly recommend this episode, especially if you were a fan of the old series and a nod to David Tennant's regeneration was a warm fuzzy as well!",1392940800,,552,4.188679245283019

4665217,4,B005EEZ56Q,"I should not that I am old enough to remember Sarah Jane Smith from her Tom Baker days. That era was my first introduction to Dr Who and it will always hold a special place in my heart. Whenever I think ""Companion"" the first one I think of is Sarah Jane! That connection alone is enough to draw me into this show and too fully enjoy it. The appearance of K-9 help here as well.

I stop short of giving it 5 stars as this show seem best targeted for younger viewers. Yes Dr Who is supposedly targeted for younger audiences as well but Dr Who fully understand that it has a very large adult audience and it makes sure that they are served. The Sarah Jane Adventures fall a little short here. They are still very watchable for an adult Whovians as long as you don't expect too much.

Note to all Whovians! If you don't invest the time into this series that's understandable. However you should at least make the time to go back and watch the year three appearances by David Tennant and the year four appearance by Matt Smith!",1386979200,2,1022,4.290155440414508

Now we come to the Doctor (Matt Smith) I thought he looked out classed by the two ladies in this. He looked more like he should be one of the kids than the Doctor. I also didn't like the snide remark he made to Jo Grant when she said he looked like a baby, and he said she looked over baked. Did like the reference to Doctor # 10(David Tennant) having gone back and looked in all previouse Dr. Who companions that he could find.",1368489600,,638,4.186991869918699

4665229,5,B005EEZ56Q,"THE SARAH JANE ADVENTURES started its fourth season with a surprise, the departure of costar Tommy Knight (""Luke"") and K-9. He reappeared via web conversations with the main cast and occassional walk-ons.
The high point is the long-delayed onscreen meeting of Sarah Jane and her immediate predescessor, Jo Grant.  It's a great story.  Even better, it includes a postscript where Sarah Jane gives a rundown of the post-Doctor activities of all the Companions known to modern Earth.
The bittersweet part is at the time none of the viewership knew how ill Elisabeth Sladen was.  She and the producers knew. The final episode plays with the idea of replacing Sarah Jane by a new character but ....  no, I'll stop there.
The series ends with a fitting curtain call, both for the series, the character, and the actress.",1331164800,9,813,4.912408759124087

What a gift to us fans that she was given this Doctor Who spin-off.

The team of fine young actors, Luke (Tommy Knight), Clyde (Daniel Anthony), and Rani (Anjli Mohindra) do a great job. The superbly talented Gareth Roberts wrote several episodes, as did Russell T. Davies, and we're treated to a wonderful, poignant reunion between the Doctor's companions with Sarah Jane Smith finally meeting Jo Grant (Katy Manning). This can't be missed by Doctor Who fans of all ages. Enjoy!",1329868800,5,1024,5.743421052631579

In the U.K., this series was released with a fantastic special feature--the complete ""Doctor Who"" adventure from 1975, ""The Pyramids of Mars,"" with the 4th Doctor and Sarah Jane. They should have included it in the U.S. edition as well.",1326499200,24,330,4.7894736842105265

The Sarah Jane Adventures are all GREAT!

My granddaughter age 9 watches these with me!
I don't ever pre-watch these shows.
I have NO reason to worry there will be something unacceptable,
while I might not let my 3 & 5 year old grandkids watch as I
don't want to scare them, 9 years old is ok to watch.

The Stories are::
1. The Nightmare Man
2. The Vault of Secrets
3. Death of the Doctor
4. The Empty Planet
5. Lost in Time
6. Goodbye, Sara Jane Smith

All stories are family friendly!
You will enjoy these if you have a joy of the good winning over evil.

Gotta say again that the Sarah Jane Adventures are all GREAT!
It is really sad that there won't be any more!
Maybe the Doctors Daughter - Jenny could take over?",1325635200,2,721,4.128571428571429
4665236,4,B005EEZ56Q,"Considering that this was the last season before we lost Elisabeth Sladen to cancer, some of the story lines this season were sadly ironic, but that didn't keep Sarah Jane Adventures from being as entertaining as ever. I will miss it!",1325462400,5,234,4.7317073170731705
4665237,3,B005EEZ56Q,"The show is lovely, and I'm sure the script is brilliant.  However, trying to hear the words over the overwhelming music takes away from the enjoyment and delight of seeing Elizabeth Sladen's scintillating performance as Sarah Jane.  I hope that in future, Russell T. Davies will see fit to tone down the music in the Dr. Who series as well(same problem, but Matt Smith's dialogs aren't quite as a disappointing loss).  The 3 stars are for the poor sound quality, while I would give Miss Sladen 5 stars for her acting.  She will be sadly missed, and fondly remembered.",1323648000,4,568,4.707070707070707
4665238,5,B005EEZ56Q,"This Doctor Who spinoff is entertaining and not just for children; it's for adults, too--the child-at-heart, the ones who love Sarah Jane Smith, ending on a happy note, as Sarah Jane defeated the aliens that once more try to invade our world, with the help of her teenaged friends, Clyde and Rani, son, Luke, a computer, Mr. Smith, and her dog, K9. In a separate adventure, they meet up with the Doctor (currently played by Matt Smith) and companion Jo Grant(played by Katy Manning). This is the last chapter, unfortunately, as Elisabeth Sladen, the actress who played Sarah Jane, passed away in April of this year, and she will surely be missed in the world of Doctor Who.",1323388800,7,673,4.711864406779661
4665239,5,B005EEZ56Q,"A spinoff from the Dr. Who collections, Sarah Jane Adventures is a wonderful science fiction for young people of all ages. She and her band of youth armed mostly with their wits do battle with alien forces all around us.
This Fourth Season is her final as she has passed away shortly after it was finished.  I expect it to be a collectors serise before long. May she rest in peace and may the children grow into the ideals they acted out so very well.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sarah-Jane-Adventures-Complete-Fourth-Season/dp/B005NHZBAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sarah Jane Adventures: Complete Fourth Season</a>",1322352000,3,656,6.053763440860215
