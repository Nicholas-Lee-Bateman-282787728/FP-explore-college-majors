727223,5,6303694721,"This is a very interesting and very different opera, by Sergei Prokofiev  (1891-1953) one of the major Russian composers of the 20th century.
Inspired by  a novel by the same name written  by Valery Bryusov (1873-1924) - among the principal members of the Russian Symbolist movement -  Prokofiev  wrote both the music and the libretto for The Fiery Angel.  Unfortunately, although he completed the opera in 1923, he never saw the performance.  For political reasons,  the opera  only premiered in 1955, that is two years following his  death  on March 5 1953,  coincidentally enough, only two days after  Stalins death.
The Fiery Angel was presented for the first time  at  the  Venice Festival,  during the 1955  August-September  season.  It  was then shown  in a full official performance at the Theatre des Champs-Elys&eacute;e  in Paris, the following  November 25.
The reviews were mixed  for different reasons, although, as often has been the case with works by great composers,  many  people enjoyed the music more  than the staging.
The present performance -  recorded live  in 1993,  at the Marinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Russia - could very well be the best one available on DVD.  In  five acts lasting 124 minutes,  it is sung in Russian by  the Kirov Opera and Main Chorus, with Galina Gorchakova  playing the main character, Renata,  and Valery Gergiev conducting.
Subtitles are available in  English, French, German and Spanish.
The place  is  Cologne, Germany, and surrounding areas.  The time is  the 16th century,  when women were accused of witchcraft,  persecuted and put to death, usually burnt at the stake.  There is a specific year of 1534.
Although written in the 20th century, The Fiery Angel  brings to mind  some of the operas of the Romantic period -  for example,  Faust by  Charles-Francois Gounod  (1818-1893) and Robert le Diable by Giacomo Meyerbeer (1791- 1864) -  where  main theme is the eternal conflict between  good and evil -  represented by angels and demons -  with  the realistic and the supernatural occurring together.  Unlike in the  operas of the Romantic period, good unfortunately does not  prevail here.
The story is sad and disquieting, as central subject is demonic possession.  Renata, a young woman in love with, and searching for  an elusive angel, is surrounded by demons instead, depicted  as evil looking  naked male creatures entirely gray in color.  The creatures are  always  around  her - and anyone else accompanying her - to pester her and to remind her of her sad condition.
Unable to  make  constructive relationships under  such conditions, Renata  retires to a convent.  The demons follow her with the result that the nuns are affected  as well.  The Mother Superior sympathizes with our heroine and suggests  the old practice of exorcism.  Unfortunately the Inquisition discovers  the problem and  takes Renata  away to be tortured, then burnt  to death.
Because of the complexity of the subject, this opera is regarded  as one of the composers most challenging.
The  Fiery Angel  is well worth watching, but, like many operas of the 20th century, may  be disturbing to the more sensitive among the viewers.

727224,5,6303694721,"... to see&hear this spectacular production, unless you have a DVD player that can handle ""region 2"" format. The DVD IS available from amazon.uk and other European sellers. Here's the text of my review of the CD of the same performance:

""""This is easily the best of the two CD recordings available of ""The Fiery Angel"" but I can't recommend it whole-heartedly to anyone who can possibly see the opera on DVD or -- fat chance! -- on stage. There's a stunningly fine DVD released by ArtHaus, with the same cast as this CD, performed by the Kirov Opera in 1993. The same production was offered in London and San Francisco, and perhaps in other cities. What's the problem then? Alas, the DVD is available only in ""region 2"" format and will not be playable on the ""region 1"" equipment of nearly all American homes. You'll need an ""all region"" DVD player, or possibly you can watch it on your desk-top computer, using headphones. Americans, unite and riot! You're being cheated, mistreated, deprived of many very fine films, not just of operas, that are available to Europeans but not to you!

""The Fiery Angel"" is indeed a flaming spectacle of an opera. It begins with a scene of demonic possession, or else of dementia, in which the beautiful Renata is found raving, tormented by writhing near-naked demons (the men of the Maryinsky Acrobatic Troupe), who continue to lurk on the stage throughout the production. Eventually the drama will include a sword fight, a lurid ludicrous tavern scene, and a climactic orgy in a nunnery, in which the nuns are stripped of their habits by the demons and flung naked around the stage, while the Grand Inquisitor hurls imprecations and exorcisms in vain. It seems that even today The Fiery Angel is too flamboyant for many opera audiences, and it remains 'controversial' even while off-stage nudity has become standard fare at the Salzburg Mozart Festival.

Renata has been ""possessed"" since childhood by her vision of the beautiful spirit Madiel, but whether Madiel is indeed a 'fiery angel' or a devil is the core question of the drama, amounting to a synedoche of the conflicting perceptions of Religion of any sort, as Possession by Good or Evil. But expect a straightforward resolution of that conflict! The Grand Inquisitor is no more patently the spokesman for God in this opera than is the cynical Mephitopheles, who appears in the tavern scene of the fourth act, with Doctor Faustus in tow. Both the Inquistor and Mephisto are costumed in bright red. Renata is 'rescued' from her tormenting visions, in the opening scene of the opera, by the wandering knight Ruprecht, who first attempts to seduce her but who then becomes ""possessed"" by unreciprocated Love for her. Together, Renata and Ruprecht travel to Cologne in search of Renata's previous lover, Count Heinrich, whom she identifies as the incarnation of Madiel but who abandoned her in disgust. The duel in act three will be fought by Ruprecht and Heinrich, after which Renata will seek 'sanctity' in the convent. This plot might sound convoluted and obscure, but it isn't. The libretto, which Prokofiev prepared himself, is quite lucid, and the dramatic structure of the opera makes the bizarre magical events of the tale expressively immediate. This is surely one of the most intense, emotionally challenging operas ever composed!

Sergei Prokofiev (1891-1953) wrote The Fiery Angel slowly, over the course of at least eight years, from 1919 to 1927, as he traveled from the USA to the Bavarian Alps (Oberammergau) to Paris. He interested conductor Bruno Walter in staging the opera in Berlin, but the project failed. In fact, The Fiery Angel was not staged anywhere until 1954, a year after the composer's death. That production used a French libretto; the original Russian libretto was lost until 1977. The opera was not performed in Russia until the onset of ""perestroika"".

Meanwhile in 1933 Prokofiev returned to Russia, to the Soviet Union of Josef Stalin, the Grandest Inquisitor of all. It was perhaps the lack of acclaim for his music in the West that sent Prokofiev back to Russia and into a kind of ""possession"" as demonic as anything suffered by Renata or Ruprecht in his opera. In fact, Prokofiev was highly successful in Russia, despite his avant-garde dissonance. He found an outlet for his music in the greatest films of the Soviet era and in his ballets. His later operas, including ""War and Peace"", were successfully staged and well received. Even so, in 1948 he was condemned for 'formalism' and forced to humble himself in apology; his wife was condemned for anti-Soviet acts and sentenced to prison. Prokofiev's health was damaged and he had to compose the merest hour a day for the rest of his life. Aptly and symbolically, he died on precisely the day in 1953 when Stalin's 'cult of personality' was publicly denounced. The composer of this potent operatic drama of Possession and Inquisition had lived to experience his own nightmarish vision.

""The Fiery Angel"" is one of the very greatest operas of the Twentieth Century. I'd go out on the limb and call it one of the ten greatest. But it's not just the drama and the symbolic depths that make it great. It's the music, which is as fiery and witty as anything Prokofiev ever wrote. No other composer except Leos Janacek succeeded as completely as Prokofiev in subsuming the melodic lyricism of 19th C Romanticism with the astringent tonal/atonal complexities of modernism, melding the best of both. Ironically, Prokofiev's 'Soviet era' music has been extremely popular in the United States; in fact, his compositions are heard more often on American 'classical music' radio broadcasts than those of any other composer! One of the marches from his early opera ""Love for Three Oranges"" was the theme song for a radio serial about the FBI in the 1950s. Even so, his music has been persistently under-rated by critics and musicologists of the elite in the USA, and his operas have been neglected in favor of other inferior works. Let's all shout at or write to our local opera impresarios and try to change that!

The role of Renata in ""The Fiery Angel"" is extremely demanding, by the way. Renata sings about two-thirds of all the vocal passages in the opera; the difficulty of the role might be one of the factors that limit the productions of the work. For a successful staging, everything depends on the casting of Renata. Galina Gorchakova, who sings Renata on this CD and on the DVD, is superb both vocally and dramatically, from her first shrieks of madness to her final fiery apotheosis.""""",1298764800,4,6571,4.8931777378815084

7855040,4,6303694721,"This is a dark opera. The main character is portrayed by Galina Gorchakova and I don't think she smiles in any of the five acts she is in.
She sings well and is convincing as a tormented religious women. The fortune teller is mezzo Diadkova and she sings well and acts well. The men sing and act well also. My favorite character is the Inquisitor. He doesn't appear until Act 5. If you like the Grand Inquisitor in Verdi's opera Don Carlo you will love this guy.
The sets are slightly minimalist. Everything that needs to be there is there however. The camera work is good but not great. Sometimes the camera comes off a singer to show something inconsequential. The biggest problem in my opinion is the audio balance between singers and orchestra. With my volume control set at a comfortable level for the orchestra the vocalists can barely be heard. The engineers could have done a better job. The video quality is good.
Some may find Act 5 controversial. There is nudity. I don't consider it gratuitous. Others might. Nuns don't go nude in Sour Angelica
or Dialogue of the Carmelites. That would be gratuitous. Those nuns were not possessed. These nuns are possessed by demons.
Some people believed in demons back in the 16th century so I think it is reasonable for the director to take this approach. I recommend

 Also, whoever did the sound mixing, should be sent back to school. The vocal sections were recorded so low that the volume had to be brought way up; then, when the orchestra kicked in, it was deafening.

 The directors concept, for the portrayal of the demons, was in poor taste and substantially overdone. Also, watching nuns
strip, then writhe around, on the floor, was in poor taste.

 Lastly, the quality of the singing, which is crucial to opera, was far from good.

 This presentation was so awful that I could not finish it. Avoid it, if you can.",1405900800,3,774,4.7669172932330826
