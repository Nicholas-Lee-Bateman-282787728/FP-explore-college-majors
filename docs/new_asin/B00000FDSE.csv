7908767,1,B00000FDSE,"This detestable sequel to the okay DRAGON FURY has nothing to recommend it.  Robert Chapin, Mike Norris and all the so-called ""Actors"" are laughable.  The fight scenes are staged like ballroom dancing, the plot is ridiculous, there is about a three minute love scene that is also laughable, a little girl with psychic powers, and a satellite poised to rule men's minds.  A total waste of your time---please don't bother.",1092787200,,420,4.9714285714285715
