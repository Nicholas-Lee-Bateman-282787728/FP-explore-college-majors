8062325,4,B0009K74Q4,"the DVD freezes in a few sections.  The ""Just For Fun"" workouts are exactly that...fun, fun, fun.  Not too complicated but not so simple I get bored.  The ""Heavenlies"" are a bit more complex so I don't try those very often.  I don't like to spend too much time learning.",1365552000,,270,4.34
8062326,5,B0009K74Q4,"Christi's choreography is definitely not for beginners. However, there are PLENTY of workouts geared towards beginners (too many really), so for those who want much more, this is it. It is normal to get frustrated when you keep getting lost, but with each try it gets better and then all of a sudden it comes together. Christi is an excellent cuer and every word counts, so paying attention is half the battle. The intensity overall is intermediate while the complexity is advanced. It took me more than a few tries to master the 2nd stage of Step Heaven, but when I got it, it felt great. What I like most about all of her workouts is the music. When I need a pick-me-upper I reach for them and it works. I wish more instructors realized the importance of this. Sometimes I like to mix and match the sections from the different step workouts based on how much time I have. A good add-on is offered in Stage 3 of Step Heaven: circuit training (cardio + weights) that is less complex but gets your heart rate way up and provides nice variety instead of just cardio.",1209427200,,1064,4.461538461538462
8062327,5,B0009K74Q4,"I'm only reviewing the STEP portion of these videos.

This is an AMAZING, FUN workout.  Yes, the choreography is complex, and the first time you view the workout, make sure you have a good hour extra to learn the routines.  There IS a learning curve, but for the time spent, it's way past worth your time.  It's a great workout, and it's so much fun!  I ended up getting a bunch of Christi's STEP workouts.  She's got a great attitude.  She's not annoying.  Her cueing is flawless.  For advanced steppers.  Anyone else will not be able to keep up.",1142985600,,547,4.434343434343434
8062328,1,B0009K74Q4,"I am an avid stepper and I found the step workouts on these dvds to be way too difficult for any normal person.  Christi gives you the option to follow herself as she does the more complex moves or you can follow her fellow steppers, but the camera view is mainly on Christi so it is difficult to see the other steppers and her queing is not easy to follow.  I would not recommend this dvd.",1130889600,,390,4.118421052631579
