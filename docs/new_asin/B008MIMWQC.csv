Their speedy service was awesome and as such, I hope to purchase more from them in the future too!",1357603200,2,274,4.5

5169875,5,B008MIMWQC,What can I say Drew Barrymore is in these movies. Good chick flicks.,1412467200,,68,4.3076923076923075

5169877,5,B008MIMWQC,This buy ended up being a hit with me (Wedding Singer) and a hit with my wife. I figured for the price the other two titles  would be welcome.,1396396800,,142,3.896551724137931
5169878,5,B008MIMWQC,I think if you like Drew Barrymore you will love this triple play. All three movies are good and the story lines work well with each other. Sometimes they put movies that have nothing to do with each other together. But in this case I think they did a pretty good job of matching the movies together well. There is cohesion between them! God job Warner!,1395705600,,353,4.363636363636363
5169879,5,B008MIMWQC,"I don't love Going the Distance, but the other two movies are well worth the price. Wedding Singer is a classic, and Music and Lyrics is underrated.",1380672000,2,148,4.518518518518518
5169880,5,B008MIMWQC,"Here are three movies, starring Drew Barrymore, that are just plain fun to watch.  Lots of laughs with great co-stars.",1369353600,2,118,4.9
5169881,4,B008MIMWQC,"If you're a fan of Drew Barrymore, this is a definite buy.  I honestly bought it more for ""The Wedding Singer"" as that movie always makes me laugh.  However, I really did like the movie ""Music and Lyrics"" with Hugh Grant and ""Going The Distance"" was one I had never seen and was pleased with as well.  The blu-ray transfer looked great on all three movies, and when I bought this, it was only $10 so you couldn't ask for a better deal to have three good movies at this price!!",1362787200,,476,4.208791208791209
5169882,5,B008MIMWQC,"As always. Drew Barrymore shines in these three movies. Hughly recommended for  all three of these. My favorite DB movies are ""EverAfter"" ,""Never Been Kissed"" and ""Duplex.""",1362787200,,172,5.37037037037037
5169883,5,B008MIMWQC,Drew Barrymore has really grown as an actress.  These three movies not only show that but also her comedic talents.  These are no brain er movies that are just fun to watch.  Seeing Hugh Grant dancing and singing was a great treat.  For the price you can't beat this deal.,1358553600,3,272,4.38
