4906804,5,B005Z5CP8A,"""A Guy Called Dad: A Daughter's Journey"" is a intimate and revealing documentary that explores how mental health (schizophrenia) effects a father / daughter relationship. The complex array of affective, behavioral, cognitive and perceptual components makes even the simplest of tasks a real challenge.

Producer/Director Kacey Arnold sheds light on the realities and complexities of mental illness with sensitivity and humor. This documentary is a ""must see"" for anyone who is impacted by a psychological or behavioral disorder. Stigma and discrimination add to the suffering associated with disorders.  I feel that this film compliments the greater social movement towards increased awareness and acceptance. Well done.",1321833600,4,720,5.847619047619047

4906816,5,B005Z5CP8A,Heartbreaking and real. Her sense of humor and loyalty are commendable.,1426464000,,71,5.545454545454546
4906817,5,B005Z5CP8A,"This is a very touching documentary by Kacey Arnold to her schizophrenic dad. She obviously cares very much about him and wants him to get help. I could feel her frustration during the movie as her dad was stubborn and didn't see that he had anything wrong with him. Some people with mental illness lack the insight into their illness like Staven. I applaud Kacey for not giving up on her dad and caring about him even when he is difficult.

I'm glad Kacey went to NAMI (national alliance mental illness) for help for herself to deal with her dad. Great documentary.",1388188800,,566,4.549019607843137
4906818,4,B005Z5CP8A,This was a powerful documentary on mental illness.  The personal relationship between the creator/director of this documentary and the subject (her father) made the story compelling and real.  That made the simplicity of the production work.,1373673600,,241,5.666666666666667
4906819,5,B005Z5CP8A,Very realistic portrayal of a schizophrenic person and the trials and frustrations experienced by their family.  Helps other to understand what family goes through and how difficult it can be to deal with.,1368489600,,205,5.212121212121212
4906820,5,B005Z5CP8A,"A Guy Called Dad is the real deal. When we follow Ms. Arnold, a Los Angeles based producer, writer and comedienne into the not-so-funny world of her father's schizophrenia, we are faced with the question: Damn, how would I handle this situation? It's a good question. And Kacey shows us how to do it. At once witty and challenging, the film confronts us with one of life's most difficult challenges: a parent who needs parenting through no fault of his own. Ms. Arnold's compassion in handling this situation does not yield to martyrdom. There is anger, there are difficulties and not a little frustration. But she is up to the task and, in the end, we are left with a sense of how we all can rise to help each other in the most difficult of circumstances. A Guy Called Dad is a gift of love from a daughter to her father. It also illuminates a growing problem in our society and a call to the compassionate in all of us. A most compelling and absorbing film.",1340582400,2,959,4.423728813559322
4906821,4,B005Z5CP8A,"I watched this movie becuase I just finished my Psych class for my RN.  This movie was sad for both the daughter and dad. As a society we try to dismiss the population of people who suffer from mental illnesses because it is not our normal. What I gained from this movie is that it is a reality to many people and families who probably live within our communities and do not have the support or do not know where to receive support for the mental illness affecting their lives. Also, the person afflicted with the MI has to accept they have a MI and want to receive help. How do they do that when they do not have the mindset to come to that conclusion? Autonomy is just as important to someone in this situation as to someone who has a cold and can choose to follow or not follow a physicians recommendations. I admire his daughter for wanting to help her dad in the midst of her frustration.  I do not have this degree of mental illness in my family and thank God for that because that is truly a blessing to be able to say that.  I will never take for granted that I am blessed but in the same feel such a sadness for people and families who deal with severe degrees of mental illness on a daily basis.  My heart goes out to them !",1331078400,3,1234,4.129166666666666
4906822,5,B005Z5CP8A,"A courageous daughter hangs out with her Dad who has become increasingly unavailable to her over time because he is under the inescapable spell of his schizophrenia.  We experience the frustration of Dad's total lack of motivation to try to escape even though we want him to.  I am especially struck by Kacey's patience as she and her cameraman allow Dad to just BE.  The result is an observation without judgement allowing the viewer to feel their own emotions and a deep sense of the reality of the dis-ease.  Kacey is our guide through the reality of her Dad's world, done with humor and pathos, without self-pity, giving us an honest experience and a deeper understanding of an unrelenting psychosis . With grateful admiration, Thank you, Kacey Arnold!  (As a psychotherapist I worked for several years with schizophrenia and lived as the primary caretaker of a paranoid schizophrenic teen for 3 1/2 years.  So I can vouch for the truth of the film - which is inescapable anyway.)",1328659200,3,984,4.8273809523809526
4906823,5,B005Z5CP8A,"This film is a daughters personal journey into learning about her fathers mental illness, and exploring her realtionship with him. It is moving, and heartbreaking but has the filmmakers sense of humor mixed in which makes it heartwarming and inspirational.

Watching an incredible woman go through a personal self-discovery, and learning about mental illness at the same time has opened my mind. When I see people on the street who could be characterized as mentally ill, I wonder if they have a family out there... And if they are lucky enough to have a child who cares like this filmmaker.",1322524800,2,591,4.91
4906824,5,B005Z5CP8A,"If you have a family member with a severe mental illness (or know someone who does), this is a must see. Poignant, touching, funny and sad, this unique look at the life of a schizophrenic (from the perspective of his own child) will haunt you for days. It is also a way to educate yourself about the subject matter. Don't miss the bonus features!",1321833600,7,346,4.421875

8489463,5,B005Z5CP8A,Did not have a dry eye by the end of this video. This video is a harsh reality of the toll mental hear5th can take on a person. It also highlights the need for better care for those who suffer from mental illness.,1489449600,,213,3.9767441860465116
8489464,2,B005Z5CP8A,"Stagnant!  The relationship between daughter and Dad did not improve.  The situation with Dad did not improve.  I understand the daughter's knowledge about schizophrenia seems limited and she may have not known the severity of the condition of her father when she went for her visit.  However, in some way, I believe the daughter must have recognized she could not help her Dad in a week.  Overall, it seems like the trip was frustrating and agitating for both the daughter and her Dad.  I am glad that the daughter joined NAMI.  This will provide her with the knowledge, understanding, and skills needed to communicate better with her Dad.",1487203200,,640,4.87037037037037
