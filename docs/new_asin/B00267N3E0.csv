3852952,5,B00267N3E0,"Santa Buddies is a 2009 Disney direct-to-DVD edition of the Disney Buddies series, just in time for the Christmas Season. Directed by Robert Vince, this new installment of the famed Disney DVD franchise features the Buddies helping Santa Claus and his canine colleague Santa Paws spread Christmas cheer throughout Fernfield, Wash. and the entire world. Also, they must help Santa Paws' son Puppy Paws learn the true values of Christmas, and bring happiness to a hard-bitten dog catcher who had lost the Christmas spirit years ago. Just like other Buddies films, this sequel has an excellent cast(Chrisohper Lloyd, George Wendt, Little Person character actor Danny Woodburn, Richard Kind, comedy legend Tim Conway, and the late Tom Bosley, in his final performance)as well as the terrific CGI special effects. The DVD also includes special features like a behind-the-scenes featurette, and sneak peeks of upcoming Disney DVD favourites.

3852976,1,B00267N3E0,"This was terrible. I'd give no stars if I could.

My 5 year old NOW knows that the Santa Claus at the mall isn't the real deal. And that these guys aren't even necessarily 'helpers' which WAS going to be my backup once he figured this out in another year or two. In fact, he now knows the 'Santa' there might throw away his letter, not pay any attention, and not believe in Santa himself. Great, yay. Way to kill the magic!

If that weren't bad enough, at one point in the movie the director skips from kid to kid in various homes, all on their knees, PRAYING to Santa. Great. Here's another good one. We pray to God. Santa is suddenly religious? He's right up there eh? I know that some may do 'st nick' and pray to saints, but they are praying to the fat man in the red suit at the north pole who by the way is oblivious!

That's right, Santa is oblivious. Where's PuppyPaws? Santa doesnt know. Whats going on, who is where, how did this or that happen? The man who sees you when you're sleeping and knows when you're awake, apparently has no idea what the heck is going on in the world or even his own stupid icicle.

Killed the magic, thanks!",1354665600,4,1146,4.195454545454545

When I finally found thhis set I was thrilled and although we already own the movie (and have watched it 100's of times) it was worth it to see the thrill on my little girls face! Every night in her prayers she would pray to meet the Buddies and we would wish on a star five individual times - wishing to meet each Buddy! I hope and pray they come out with more Buddy sets! The only problem was B-Dawgs necklace broke and was a bit flimsy although (once we find all the pieces I will try to fix it), Budda's necklace was fine.

My daughter is four and loves animals.  Anything with talking animals in it pleases her, but the actual movie itself was horrible.  Story line, plot, characters, everything about it was so cheesy and lame.  But chances are, if you have small children, they will love it.",1303084800,9,437,4.851351351351352

It really explains the true meaning of Christmas. Plus the cuteness between Puppy Paws and the buddies is great humor.

3852999,5,B00267N3E0,"I loved this movie! The only mystery was, it's never mentioned who was Puppy Paws mother. But the buddies were so darn cute. Especially near the end when all the buddies and Puppy Paws made their last stop and visited the little pup (Tiny) who was hoping for a Christmas miracle and find a home. They showed the movies numerous times on the ABC Family Channel and when it got to that particlar part, I get choked up every time. It is a movie worth getting and worth watching!",1293321600,,475,4.348314606741573
3853000,1,B00267N3E0,"I watched this on ABC Family with my son instead of the DVD -- I imagine the DVD is better because you don't have a movie twice as long as it should be because half of the showtime is ads.  Then again, the other half is dogs sitting there with animated mouths.  Talking.  And god help us, singing.  The smaller dogs sing in high falsetto.  Basically, a nightmare.

The narrative consists of moments when, just when you think it can't get anymore saccharine, the singing dog gets noticed by people who, up till that point were having a glum Christmas, and then discover the singing dog and their lives because extremely happy.",1292976000,3,625,4.535714285714286

Puppy Paws does not want to be Santa's dog.  It is the homeless and impounded Tiny(similiar to Tiny Tim, from Scrooge) who helps Puppy Paws find the Christmas spirit.  It is the friends Puppy Paws makes that support Puppy Paws in his taking over for Santa and the reindeer.  Themes include love, faith, friendship, teamwork, responsibility, compassion and forgiveness.

The effects seem to have been rendered at well below HD quality (the reindeer look like wii quality graphics, and there are many scenes where the effects seem to be running at 5-10 frames per second. A fun story, with kids and pets, and a high cuteness factor, but a bit mind numbingly predictable for the adults and the poor effects quality just brings you right out of the moment whenever you see them.

3853013,4,B00267N3E0,"My daughter loves these puppy movies, so we thought she would enjoy this one, too. Well, she did enjoy it once, but hasn't been clamoring to see it again (like she does with her favorite movies.) She is a little older (age 10) but still likes the ""cute"" things. I think past the age of around 7, kids seem to demand a little more of an interesting plot and character development in their movies(and I think that is a good thing!) This one is a little short on that end. There is a story, but it is more just to move along the scenes of puppies doing adorable things. Adults, don't expect to get really involved in the story. Some children's movies can indeed be great for adults, too. This one? Not so much. Not horrible, but not a classic (like say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beauty-and-the-Beast/dp/B00003CX8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beauty and the Beast</a>&nbsp;or something.)

I don't really understand the ""combo"" concept of Blu-ray + DVD. I imagine the thinking is, that if they throw in the Blu-ray for free, they may eventually entice non-owners to get a Blu-ray player. Maybe they think folks might end up with a few unwatched Blu-rays lying around and figure they should switch. Then they will want to buy more copies of their favorite DVDs....which likely would include new versions of all the classic Disney movies. And they do that goofy ""Disney Vault"" thing, so they further try to coerce you into buying stuff because it ""will be gone soon!!!"" Sorta like having junk food in the cupboard...you know you don't NEED it, but since it is there anyway, you keep thinking about it, and eventually eat it!",1271289600,2,1666,4.9928057553956835

The north pole is losing its Christmas magic.  In this north pole has Santa Paws and his son Puppy Paws.  PP is always looking for new ways to have fun.  He see Budderball on Santa's puppy naughty list and decides to visit Budderball.

But PP is even more mischevous than the Buddies and he gets all of them into trouble.  He eats the Christmas cookies at Budderball's. Breaks a vase while break dancing at B-dog's.  Gets muddy and gets Dude Dog's master's white livingroom all muddy.  He turns Rosebud's Christmas outfit into an elf costume.  Turn's Budda Dog's Buddah statue into a snowman (PP has christmas magic).

When PP finds out that the Buddies are mad at him, he runs off and gets caught by the dog catcher.  Back at the North Pole, the icycle with the Christmas magic is melting even faster since PP left.  A rescue party is sent to bring PP back.

This is a fun but nothing special piece of Christmas fluff.

The one thing I do not like about this edition is the Blu-ray/DVD combo pack.  Most people only need one and the other goes to waste.  For Disney promoting being green, this is not very green!

This might be  because it's a Christmas movie and it's now February but I think it has more to do with the fact that the movie just isn't very engaging.
To me the story line seems like one big generic Christmas themed mess with a really pathetic appearance from Christopher Lloyd (as a mean, Christmas-hating dog catcher who later has a change of heart...of course). It didn't keep my kids' attention at all.

The blatantly stereotypical blights that children will learn from this movie are not something any responsible or socially aware parent would want to promote, and definitely not the values I want my children to embrace! Stop for a moment and consider what your children are really LEARNING, not just how much they may be laughing, before you decide if it makes sense to financially support this movie and risk encouraging like content from Disney in the future. If you really feel the need to see puppies on-screen on a seasonal basis, best case scenario is to rent it from the local video store once a year, but even exposing children to these offensive stereotypes once a year is something those who consider themselves socially responsible members of enlightened society will choose to forego.

If you liked the offensive content of Transformers 2, you'll probably love this movie, too. They're both chock full of negative references and stereotypes of non-anglo ethnicities.",1265846400,3,1190,4.9798994974874375

3853023,4,B00267N3E0,"I have to confess this is the first ""buddies"" movie I watch. When I was offered the opportunity of watching it and reviewing it I thought it would be a good idea to watch a movie like this with my kid.

The movie tells the story of how a magical Christmas icicle is melting as too many people nowadays have forgotten the ""true meaning of Christmas"". Puppy Paws, the protagonist, has grown tired of the north pole. The movie tells his adventures and how he has to believe in Christmas so he can share that and make others believe as well. From then on we see what he has to go through to achieve that.

Considering this is a movie for kids about talking dogs I can't really be picky about it; we watched it and enjoyed it. There was a lot of discussion among other reviewers about the puppies saying that Santa is not real and that their parents are actually the ones who get them presents. Well, I am not sure I see a problem with that in this movie, yes, there is a conversation with the puppies were this is mentioned, but the real Santa appears in it, actually the movie opens with Santa in the north pole explaining the icicle melting issue. With that said, I did not mind that and don't think my kid will even care about that dialogue as it is demonstrated in the movie that Santa does exist, but that's just me. It was sometimes kind of creepy though to look at the inexpressive faces of the puppies while they talk  (my kid kept saying they were 'ugly') The presence of  Christopher Lloyd as Mr. Stan Cruge was fun and enjoyable.

The presentation, as usual with Disney, is stellar. The movie is presented in 1080p high definition / 1.78:1. Image looks detailed and the definition in colors is great/ The only problem this high definition transfer represents is that it actually reveals some cheap special effects and certain flaws are more noticeable (but kids don't really care about those things, so). The only extras are a sing along and a music video, both are presented in HD.

Languages included are English 5.1 DTS-HD, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital with subtitles available in English, French and Spanish

3853025,2,B00267N3E0,"SANTA BUDDIES is the latest installment in Disney's series of films about the ""Buddies"" clan of puppy Golden Retrievers. The dogs are cute and not only that, but they talk. In this story, Santa Claus (George Wendt) and his dog companion, Santa Paws (Tom Bosley) are worried that Christmas will soon disappear because the North Pole icicle which contains the magical spirit of Christmas is melting at a rapid pace. People just don't believe in Christmas and if Santa Paws son, Puppy Paws, doesn't start thinking of others instead of himself, there will be no hope because he has to pass on the spirit of Christmas to future generations of puppies. Puppy Paws, though, is tired of his life and wants to be an average dog. So, he hitches a ride to a small town in Washington to visit the Buddies: Budderball, B-Dawg, Buddha, Mudbud, and their sister Rosebud. But Puppy Paws still seems selfish as ever until he is caught by the local dog catcher, Stan Crudge (Christopher Lloyd) and taken to his shelter. Santa Paws and Santa Claus discover what's happened and with some help from their elves and the Buddies, the set out to rescue Puppy Paws and save Christmas.

SANTA BUDDIES is the first of the ""Air Buddies"" movies I have seen. As an adult who has worked with children, I realize that the movie was not for me. Most of the dialog is atrocious, the plot is filled with all kinds of giant holes, the computer effects are laughable, and there is very little emotional depth to the story (a subplot with the dogcatcher is the most moving part of the whole piece). It is a movie clearly marketed toward a very young audience. With that said, I really can't even recommend this movie for that audience either. The movie promotes a very secularized version of Christmas (with famous Christmas carols rewritten and erasing any Christian connotations whatsoever). I also found it a bit weird that the Buddha puppy celebrated Christmas; how is it that all Christian references are erased but Buddhism remains as the only religion in the movie? I did like how the movie illustrated that the department store Santas and elves are ambassadors for Santa, but for very young children this is a concept that might not grasp. Even though it's cute, it's also a bit disturbing to see a bunch of dogs delivering presents to all the ""nice"" children and puppies of the world.

On a more positive note, the subplot with Mr. Crudge is perhaps the best part of the film. Christopher Lloyd is almost always a joy to watch. It was nice to see George Wendt again, too, though his Santa didn't seem very jolly (perhaps emoting what Wendt actually felt about the project). I also enjoyed listening to the voices of Tom Bosley and Tim Conway, people that only adults will recognize.

The special features on the DVD include a ""Sing Along to Christmas Carols With the Buddies"" that offers three songs that viewers can sing with the Buddies; a music video of ""Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town"" featuring a newer Disney singer, Steve Rushton; a promo for Blu-Ray featuring Cole and Dlyan Sprouse from Disney's ""Suite Life"" series, and a bunch of trailers for upcoming Disney features and products.

Overall, SANTA BUDDIES isn't a great piece of entertainment. It's about what you would expect. It's definitely a feature that uses Christmas as a marketing ploy, which is ironic because part of the ""message"" of the movie is about how we shouldn't be so self-centered. Young children might enjoy the movie, but parents and caretakers should just be aware of what they are watching.",1264809600,,3544,4.7390599675850895

3853028,2,B00267N3E0,"It's an indication of the quality of the film that the most positive thing that can be said about it is the fact that the edition of this movie comes as a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack. It's unfortunate that the purpose for buying such a combo pack - to watch the movie over and over on a variety of devices - will never be realized.

To say that this movie insults our intelligence would be to underestimate it. The most bothersome thing about it are the talking dogs. However, having said that, it seems that the movie is a cutsey attempt to teach great values - those of friendship and caring and helping others. It's a shame that the movie attempts to do this by totally underusing a talented canine cast and Christopher Lloyd's superb comedic abilities.

It's a shame that this movie doesn't use it's 90-minute running time to say something negative and uplifting about dog shelters, or to show how much rescuing dogs benefits the human and the canine spirit.

Ultimately, the most regrettable thing about this movie is its erroneous repesentation of dogs. Who wants children to grow up thinking that dogs give them Christmas presents?",1264636800,,1133,4.712121212121212
3853029,3,B00267N3E0,"I haven't seen any of the other movies in the ""Buddies"" series, but if they all depend on ""dawg"" puns and the humor of canines saying trend words like ""dude"" and ""fo shizzle"" then I must say that this is one of Disney's weakest efforts.

There was also some confusion as to who the target audience was for this.  The plot was elementary enough to only appeal to toddlers, yet the film is littered with rap jokes and quotes from Mean Girls, which seem to make it more aimed for a junior high crowd.

In any case, only you know if you're child will be amused by a poor acted, low budget Christmas story starring admittedly cute dogs.  So if you are interested, let's move on and talk about this Blu Ray combo pack.

First I have to praise Disney for pushing Blu Ray so hard.  It really is the future of home entertainment.  So if you haven't upgraded, stop wasting time and do it.  Disney even caters to the stubborn though, and throws in a regular DVD with the Blu Ray.  I think this is a great idea, more so so that the movies can be watched on computers, laptops, second TVs, or other media playing devices that will take more time before going Blu.

The special features are scarce but fun.  I must admit the sing-a-longs were pretty cute, and the music video is actually a better summary of the movie than the movie itself.

Overall, I must say that with there being so many timeless family Christmas classics out there, it'd really be a shame to waste 88 minutes of your holiday on this.  That's not to say it's a complete disaster though.  If you and your family are partial to dogs and are able to forgive atrocious acting (especially by Santa Claus), poor animation, and clich&eacute;d writing then by all means this could be worth watching.",1264464000,,1748,4.421875

First, you can buy it now and enjoy it even if you don't have a Blu-Ray player and have the hi-def version on hand when you get a Blu-Ray player. Second, if you don't have a Blu-ray player attached to every TV, you can still watch it on any TV you own. This is great since like most people with kids we have a DVD player in our van.

As for the movie, it was pretty funny and my wife and six year old enjoyed it a lot. We are ""dog people"" so it was especially fun for us. I look at some of the reviews on here and have to disagree. My daughter still believes in Santa after watching. And we watch Christmas movies throughout the year. Anyone who ever saw A Christmas Carol knows that the morale of that story is keep Christmas in your heart year round, and what a better way then to watch a funny movie filled with cute puppies.",1264032000,,999,4.176165803108808

My 2 year old liked it for awhile when the dogs are up to their tricks, and my 8 year old wanted to like it but he lost interest as well.  The package is exceptional with a DVD included as back up/kid copy either way I love these two packs, and the image is reliably impeccable in HD format, I just wish the whole set was centered around a less maudlin film.

Without giving away the plot Santa Buddies is about a group of lovable talking puppies who are out to help Santa Claus and save Christmas.

This is a 4 out of 5 in my opinion, if you are using the Blu-Ray it features full 1080 hd with 5.1 DTS HD and 5.1 Dolby Digital in French and Spanish. It comes with wonderful extras including: Sing Along Christmas Carols with The Buddies and a Special Santa Claus is Coming to Town Music Video.

The plot is a traditional ""we've got to help Santa save Christmas!"" tale, although in this case it's referring to both Santa Claus and his canine sidekick, Santa Paws.  But really, in this case the Christmas Spirit is secondary to watching a bunch of cute puppies running around.  It's rife with cliches, but its target audience isn't old enough to be tired of them yet.  A few decent songs spice up the adventure.  The under-8 set will eat this right up.

As with most Disney Blu-Rays -- well, every one that I've seen, at least, the A/V quality is excellent.  I don't know that I'd call it reference quality, but I doubt many people will be examining it closely enough to tell.  Some of the CGI animation is less than perfect when viewed carefully in HD on a 65"" screen, which might not be noticeable on a small screen or in SD.

Unlike most Disney titles, the disc doesn't include much in the way of special features.  There's a music video for a teen pop version of Santa Claus is Coming to Town, and 3 karaoke-style sing-along Christmas songs.  Aside from a nice set of trailers, that's all she wrote.  The included regular DVD is, as always, a welcome addition.

Just a bad movie in general, despite the rest of the franchise being kid-friendly and cute.  For children who believe in Santa, watching a movie where the emphasis is on Santa not being real is pretty stupid.  Not even sure why this was past of the movie.  The praying to Santa is also disturbing, as others have said. I think this movie is just further proof (as if we needed more...) that Hollywood just doesn't get it.

On the plus side: cute puppies doing things that younger kids find funny and cute, blu-ray quality (mostly). That's about all this one has going for it, unfortunately.

On the negative side: very limited window of age appeal (3-6 years of age, maybe, and adults will find it mind numbing), limited re-watch appeal (in my opinion, I can still watch Charlie Brown Christmas and Rudolph, better message and entertainment value), very limited added feature set on disk (personally, I just watch the movies, but I know others that spend more time with the added features than the actual movie, and I can think of a good number of add-ons for this movie that would have been great for the kids).

When I summed it up, I could not see watching this again next year, unlike the many other movies that I drag out each Christmas to re-watch with the family, so I give it three stars (for me that equates to 'entertaining, but I see no reason to own a copy').

The story was genuine, and, like many in our time period, the true meaning of Christmas is forgotten among all of the materialism. The 1st part of the film was a bit slow and repetitive, but the second part unfolded with a good unfolding of storylines, including getting the puppy to the little boy, changing the heart of the dog catcher, and saving Christmas, formerly in danger due to the dwindling spirit. I did expect more from Disney, regarding the animated sequences (house, crystal, and dogs/reindeer talking). Given the incredible achievements of this studio, the animated sequences looked highly artificial. I realize more resources are poured into certain franchises, and not others, and not all films any studio can release, can be ground breaking, but as an adult, it was a bit difficult to watch those sequences, coming from a major studio, and having been spoiled by stellar effects.

Our favorite parts were the ""international"" segments, as it tied in some education for youngsters,as well as a multi-cultural feel, Tiny's character, and of course the little boy's joy over receiving his puppy. Lastly, this one seemed to be geared towards a slightly older audience, as some of the dialogue had some older humor and nuances that adults or older kids may have understood, but not smaller children.

This was more of a made for TV special in my opinion, I was recently surprised to see that there is another movie called Space Buddies so I can only assume that this is a successful franchise.

I wasn't expecting to enjoy this but I really expected my son would.  Since it failed to hold his attention I'd have to say it was a failure.  Perhaps he'll appreciate it more when he gets older, but for now I will stick the Pixar movies which he always loves.

Unfortunately, it never gelled, and the movie has a number of problems. Here it is, the good and the bad.

- In general I found the acting to be adequate. Mr. Lloyd put in some of his best work ever, and those moments really worked.
- The plot was not very logical. Where in the world did they come up with the idea that dogs have such an important part of Christmas at the North Pole? My kids watched this with me, and were also puzzled. Ditto with the piece of Christmas ""magic ice"" in a cave. The concept of having an elf drive a mail truck was very funny.
- The special effects were tragic. The reindeer didn't look at all real, and one could immediately tell when the movie switched from live action to computer animation. I expected far more from Disney, and it was so obvious that it detracted from the movie experience.

Overall, the combination of the above meant that one could not get ""caught up"" in the plot. The few occasions when Mr. Lloyd put in some excellent portrayals almost got me crying. They something stupid would come up, either bad animation or some strange plot twist, and everything was ruined. The other good moments revolved around the head elf driving his mail truck around.

I thought kids would enjoy the movie yet after watching it for about 20 minutes with 2 kids, both had their attention concentrated somewhere else. Cute dogs dressed as santas are simply not the only ingredients necessary to make a movie work. Let's not offend the kid's intelligence. Santa losing his fake beard, making the movie appear to have more with zen and Buddhism than with Christianity, an evil and scary dog catcher - who can make this kind of stuff up?

3853055,3,B00267N3E0,"Santa Buddies isn't going to change any lives. It's a talking dog movie on roughly the same quality level as talking dog movies have been since Benji had a point of view. What is painful to adults is beloved by children, so my 5 year old has asked to watch this movie at least once a day since she got it on Christmas eve. With dozens of movies to choose from (and a mother eager to rent something else) that proves that it passes muster with it's target audience. The movie has already been reviewed exhaustively and well, as has the technical presentation. So from the point of view of a parent who has already committed to a talking dog film, is Santa Buddies worth getting on Blu-ray?

In a word, no. If the combo is the same price as the standard dvd, there's no reason not to go for the deluxe package but viewing Santa Buddies on the blu-ray disc is to expose it's technical flaws. Making dogs talk requires special effects, and lots of them. When watching on the standard dvd, the sudden fuzz added to the background is less glaring. On the very clean and crisp Blu-ray version a dog in full conversation suddenly stands out sharply against the blurred background as though it's a cut out laid upon it. In the next scene the background and the animals are roughly equal in definition, but let a canine converse and the split feeling returns. Santa Buddies didn't go all out for the technical effects. Your small child won't care which version they watch, but you might find you like Santa Buddies better without the definition. Speaking for myself, I think I'll be buying another in this series, if only to move on to a different film by Valentine's Day.",1262908800,,1662,4.503311258278146

Yes, our daughter (4) was amused, but that's like saying doughnuts are good food because your dog will eat them. Crap crap crap. And poor George Wendt looked like he wanted to be anywhere else but frolicking with the Santa Buddies. One positive: The expressionless talking dogs make you appreciate how important the eyes are in human communication. Irrelevant, but interesting.

So - I don't do many reviews, and most of mine have been positive. Was this one ""illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights, or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable""?

3853057,1,B00267N3E0,"I love dogs, Santa Claus, and Christmas... so I thought a movie with all three would be great. Alas, ""Santa Buddies"" is no Christmas classic. It is more like a piece of Christmas crud that might (hopefully, accidentally) get placed in your stocking.
The magic icicle that stores Christmas Cheer throughout the year is melting fast. It seems that society as a whole has grown too cynical for Christmas. As a result, Santa Claus ( an especially pained and uncomfortable George Wendt) faces a major crisis/power failure at the North Pole. Also, Puppy Claus chooses to ignore his responsibility of  delivering gifts to dogs all over the world. He runs away and meets up with the ""Dog Buddies"" gang; who all must evade the clutches of dog catcher Christopher Lloyd.
  ""Santa Buddies"" piles on every Christmas cliche in the book. Will Lloyd's cold and crusty dog catcher develop a heart of gold and give a free dog to a disabled boy? Will enough Christmas cheer be found in the hearts of cynical, jaded humans to save Christmas? Well, yes, but the production values on this ""Direct to DVD"" Christmas clunker are terribly shoddy.  Wendt and Lloyd, who have both had much better days doing ""Cheers,"" ""Alice In Wonderland,"" ""Bye Bye Birdie""  and ""Taxi"" and ""Back To The Future"" films, respectively,  don't seem too happy to be in this movie, for painfully obvious reasons. The best that can be said about ""Santa Buddies"" is that it is occasionally cute. But it is the type of Christmas movie that parents might put in the DVD player to act as a ""video babysitter"" for their children while they are otherwise too busy or too stressed out during the holiday season. I can't imagine any family taking time out of their busy holiday schedules to sit down and watch this together.  After watching ""Santa Buddies"" (and remember, I love dogs, Santa Claus, and Christmas) I regret purchasing it and do not intend to watch it ever again.",1262822400,3,1919,4.744744744744745

The movie is typical of the Buddies franchise -- take that as you will -- but of course the charm of this gift set is the plush dogs. They're fairly high-quality, and each has its unique feature -- Mud Bud's dirty spots look so realistic, my husband and I find ourselves absent-mindedly trying to brush off the dirt! Rosebud has a pink Santa cap, setting her apart. Budderball has his own football jersey, and Buddha and B-Dawg have unique necklaces. The price at first seems steep, but if you consider how much five plush toys typically cost, plus the movie, it's a decent deal.

But otherwise, it is very popular in our house.

As for the movie, I have not watched it in full, but the general reaction was luke warm.  I think it was the least favorite of the four movies.  But it is seasonal anyway, so maybe not a bad thing.",1262563200,,653,4.134920634920635

3853062,4,B00267N3E0,"Disney's popular Buddies, those 5 darling little golden retrievers named Budderball, B-Dawg, Rosebud, Buddah and Mudbud have now joined the dozens of Christmas movies that teach us about the importance of Christmas Spirit.

The movie begins at the North Pole where Santa Claus and his dog Santa Paws are worried that without Christmas Spirit, the magical icicle that gets it's energy from Christmas Spirit will run out of power that keeps Santa's workshop and his sleigh going. Matters only get worse when Santa Paw's little son, Puppy Paws leaves the North Pole wanting to be a regular dog like Budderball.

Santa Claus is played by George Wendt (Norm from Cheers) and the local dog catcher named S.Cruge is played by Christopher Lloyd (Taxi). Christopher Lloyd plays a great Scrooge, but George Wendt's Santa Claus is almost robotic. The reindeer look like stuffed plush animals and there is a little dog named Tiny who gets to be the Christmas gift of a little sick boy.

The only bonus features are Christmas sing-along songs with the Buddies, where the words are included.

You will immediately notice how much of the movie is copied from the great Christmas movies, but when you realize that this is merely an introduction of the Spirit of Christmas to little children, you understand what Disney's storyline is all about. As I watched our traditional Christmas movies this year-A Christmas Carol, Miracle On 34th Street, A Charlie Brown Christmas, Elf and many others, I noticed that 90% of the best Christmas movies ever made are based on the same theme- that Christmas Spirit is what makes Christmas.

This movie is just that, only with Disney's Buddies showing the littlest children what Christmas Spirit is all about, and for that reason alone, Santa Buddies merits my 4 stars.",1262476800,,1788,4.966555183946488
3853063,4,B00267N3E0,"Santa Buddies is your usual Christmas romp and takes no risks. Kids will love the talking dogs but adults will probably not. Santa Buddies is intended for kids, not adults, so whether you can sit through a viewing of this with your kids totally depends on your tolerance for inane children's programming, cutesy stuff, and cynicism. All the dogs are voiced by child actors 10-15 years old. The story itself is safe, standard Disney family-friendly fare that sticks to a well-trodden formula, featuring no surprises or shocks of any kind. It's the same story of the ""true meaning of Christmas"" (which is that the holiday is not about presents, but about friends helping each other), which you've seen a thousand times. It's mostly&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Christmas-Carol/dp/1416534784/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Christmas Carol</a>&nbsp;with canines, down to the dog catcher (Christopher Lloyd) named ""S. Cruge"" (Scrooge), and a tiny pipsqueak of a dog later in the movie named, rather imaginatively, ""Tiny"".

At the North Pole, the magical Christmas Icicle is melting because people don't believe in Christmas anymore. For adults, the eye-rolling starts now. Christmas spirit powers Santa's workshop and his sleigh, like it does in so many movies, including the adult-friendly Will Ferrel comedy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elf/dp/B001E5CH0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elf</a>. The main character is Puppy Paws, the mischievous son of Santa Paws, who is the dog version of Santa Claus. Puppy Paws is grounded after causing havoc to the workshop. He wishes that ""Christmas would just disappear"" and wants to be an ordinary pup. He then hides in one of the elves' USPS mail trucks and runs away to the real world, the town of Fernfield, an idyllic representation of small Anytown, USA.

Here he meets the buddies, each a character stereotype. We have the surfer dude who ends every sentence with ""dude"", the b-boy who says ""dawg"" and ""fo'shizzle"" a lot (named B-Dawg, naturally), a fashionista (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosebud/dp/B00003CX9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosebud</a>), and a super-chill dog who speaks in more complicated sentences (named Buddha). Puppy Paws gets into more trouble with each of them. Eventually, they save Christmas and turn S. Cruge around, just like A Christmas Carol. It's all very predictable family-oriented stuff that you can expect from Disney. You can leave your kids alone with this if you can't tolerate the onscreen antics.

One criticism from another reviewer is that this movie kills the magic of Christmas for kids who still believe in Santa, but I disagree. Near the beginning, some dogs talk about Santa being their dads dressed up with a beard and a red suit. In a later scene, a mall Santa is shown being grumpy and taking off his beard. The movie makes it clear in dialog that such mall Santas and elves are Santa's helpers. The real Santa Claus (portrayed by a comatose George Wendt) is at the North Pole busy preparing for Christmas and can't be everywhere at once. To a kid, this would be a logical and plausible explanation for seeing Santas all over the place, or their dads dressing up as the jolly fat man.

Blu-Ray Disc Features:

The disc itself is only average. This is a straight-to-DVD release and it shows. The transfer is excellent, crisp, and detailed, but some of the CG is very fake looking (like Puppy Paws tumbling out of the chimney and him break-dancing). The reindeer and North Pole landscape also look fake, but kids are unlikely to notice. Special features are thin. Included are 3 sing-alongs (""Deck the Halls"", ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"", ""Santa Paws is Comin' to Town""). The music video by Steve Rushton is very irritating and I had to turn it off after 30 seconds. If this is part of the ""never-before-seen bonus material"" advertised, it should not be seen. The Sneak Peeks (upcoming Blu-ray and theatrical releases) is probably the most interesting part of this disc for adults! There's about 8 of them (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ponyo/dp/B002ZTQVBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ponyo</a>, Dumbo 70th Anniversary Blu-ray, The Princess and the Frog, Toy Story 3, etc). BD-Live continues to be a nearly worthless feature. It took more than 2 minutes to load and is just trailers. The only purpose I see for the cumbersome interface is just to frustrate kids and adults alike.

I'm giving this movie a 4, considering the age target. Kids'll likely enjoy it if they like talking animals and cutesy stuff. I was able to tolerate it and sit through one viewing, but you might not. Mercifully, this video is only 88 minutes long, which may be 88 minutes too long for some parents. I don't think I laughed once, except at the bad CG. Fans of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Watchmen-The-Ultimate-Cut/dp/B002IYEQR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut</a>&nbsp;film will recognize Danny Woodburn (Eli the Elf). The disc itself is only average, but a DVD version is included, so it's a good value.",1262390400,,5222,5.537593984962406
3853064,4,B00267N3E0,"Disclaimer:  If you can read this review, you're probably outside the age group this movie was made for.  I happen to be one of those people who are outside the target age group.  Luckily, I have an 8 year old daughter who IS within the target age group, so someone in my family actually liked this movie a lot.

So, why do I dislike this movie?  The CG reindeer looked like moving stuffed animals.  The story was formulaic.  The plot was amazingly predictable.  The whole concept of a magic icy stalactite that was melting because no one was believing in Christmas made me think this was going to be a movie about global warming!  And let's talk about cliches.  The ""bad guy"" dogcatcher's name is S. Cruge?  The little boy was sick and all he wanted was a puppy?  There's a little pupply named ""Tiny""?  At least they didn't call him Tiny Tim.

Of course, none of this means anything to my 8-year old.  She loved it.  And why not?  ""It's got puppies!!!""  (spoken about 2-3 octaves higher than my speech)  That alone would guarantee 4 or 5 stars from a kid's review.  Anyway, my daughter liked the puppies running around, even the breakdancing and flying and all those silly puppy antics.  ""Tiny"" singing in a kid-soprano voice was a good thing, not a cringe-inducing thing.  And of course, this being a Disney movie, there's a happy ending for all, the icy stalactite is restored, and the sick kid gets Tiny.  Puppy Paws (yes, that's his real name), and his Buddies save christmas.

Please note that I normally don't like to put in spoilers, but as I said, if you can read this, you're already probably too old to truly enjoy this movie.

Finally, a lot has to be said about this being a direct to DVD title.  I think that it's perfectly appropriate for this to be on DVD, since the parents have the option to ""be called away on a task at home"" or just sneak in a book or smartphone on the side as a distraction for the parent.  Also, this allows for rewatching the movie, which is perfect for the little ones.  In fact, we watched this last Saturday (day after Christmas), and by this Monday and Tuesday, my daughter wanted to watch it again.  So go figure.  To that end, this package that comes with both the Blu-Ray and regular edition is great, since it'll allow your kid to watch it on the smaller TV while the main TV goes back to Terminator Salvation (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-Salvation-Director-s-Cut-Blu-ray/dp/B001FB55I0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator Salvation (Director's Cut) [Blu-ray</a>]) or Harry Potter (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince-BD-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B000ZELISO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (+ BD-Live) [Blu-ray</a>]) or anything else that truly deserves a blu-ray treatment.

I was so excited to see the ""Santa Buddies"" coming out.  I pre purchased it on Amazon and bought 2 copies.  Fortunately I only paid about $7.00 each.  I was disappointed in this movie.  The story was not nearly as cute as the previous 3.  My grand daughter like it OK but has only asked to watch it again one time.  She constantly asks to watch the other 3 over and over.

3853091,1,B00267N3E0,"I agree with C. Buck -- this movie is not suitable for any child who still believes in Santa! Our 5yo son *loves* the ""Buddies"" movies (he darned near wore out the ""Space Buddies"" DVD), and he fell in love with this movie, too -- which is a bit of a problem. The problem starts when the Buddies are talking about why they do NOT believe in Santa Claus. To a 5yo child, the existence of Santa isn't even a question -- OF COURSE Santa exists. So the discussion among the Buddies, where they are exchanging reasons why they do not believe in Santa Claus, opens the door for a young child to start to consider whether Santa is ""real."" And the part where they pull the beard off the mall Santa just adds insult to injury.

My wife and I finally had to hide the DVD and tell our son that it ""must have gotten lost."" (We can trot the disc back out in a few years when the magic of Santa Claus has worn off.) Not a great solution, but considerably better than letting the ""Santa isn't real""  message  get drilled into him over and over again. I expected quite a bit more from Disney Studios; they really let us down on this one (and I won't ever again blindly purchase another Disney children's movie, on the assumption that it's actually suitable for children).

Aside from the ""Santa isn't real"" aspect, the movie is actually very well done. It ranks right up there with the other ""Buddies"" movies for quality and content, and is a fun story for both children and adults alike.

So, bottom line: If your child still believes in Santa (and you want him or her to continue believing in Santa), then this movie probably isn't for you. If ""Santa isn't real"" isn't anything new for your child, and if he or she has liked the previous ""Buddies"" movies, then this one is sure to be a hit.",1260835200,11,1775,4.318318318318318

3853095,3,B00267N3E0,"I settled down- well, forced to, really- with my young son for a movie hour with him. I'd heard of these 'Buddies' movies before, and since they looked reasonably cute for my son's age group, I bought the most recent one and popped it in the DVD player.

Perhaps on the chart for top 10 worst things I ever decided to do in my life.

I sat through 88 minutes of dogs that didn't really talk, predictable and impossible situations, and a wispy storyline. I know that there is some heart to this movie, and if you're a kid, it's cute, I guess. The dogs are adorable. But there's so many weird elements to this movie, it makes me wonder.

For example, the real Santa Claus in this movie looks like a creeper. There was one scene with a fake Santa Clause, like the ones you see at malls, and it revealed to the viewer that he was fake. Dogs talked about how they doubted Santa was real. Do I really want to poison my kid's mind with doubts when he's just a little kid?

No!

Now, the other things that disturbed me, were the Buddhist parts to this movie. Umm.... so is the one dog a Buddhist? That means he doesn't believe in God, and call me over-reacting, but if I find my kid praying to a Buddha statue, I know what movie to blame. And that brings me to the next situtation- kids praying to Santa Claus. Um, WHAT?! Yeah, exactly my reaction. A really weird thing to throw in there, I half-heartedly wondered if they were literally drinking while chucking that part in.

But the other thing that bothered me was how fricken faky the CG was. I know it's a low-budget kid's movie, but STILL, it bothered me. The computer graphics were terribly poor and made me laugh at it, literally.

Oh, yeah- so like one dog is a ghetto gangster, talking like ""oh, snap"" and ""he's trippin'"" and always going like ""dawg"". Gets old, trust me. Another dog is a bit of a pig, having eaten the whole Thanksgiving turkey, and of the last two- Mudbud and Rosebud, I think- one is constantly dirty, the other is prissy. Like I said, cute dogs, but weird personalities.

Anyways, I felt bad for great actors like Christopher Lloyd- tumbling from ""Back to the Future"" blockbusters to bottom-of-the-$5-movie-bin movies like this. He did his best though, and there were some touching parts to this movie, enough for children to somewhat apprecitate.

So honestly, it wasn't terrible, just- weird. Buyable, but not exactly something Wal-Mart would want back on their shelves.",1260662400,2,2445,4.513574660633484

We had some explaining to do with our kids about this as well as a few other little things that took place in the show, but that was the main one. We didn't have any Santa issues as some of the other commenters have had. We've never done the Santa thing...our kids have always known he just pretend.

I cannot recall a single Disney movie that I haven't enjoyed, until now.  The dialogue was unbelievably poor, the action totally disjointed, and the plot, if one exists, was completely confusing.  If there is an entertainment value here for children 0-4 years of age, I can only hypothesize that it would be watching a handful of cute puppies running around with their mouths barely moving (quite stiffly) but saying things that make no sense.  I watched it to the end, hoping for some redeeming feature to miraculously present itself, but it was a tedious 88 minutes of mental torture.  When the DVD falls into the $5 bin, it might be worth buying for your children under age 4 as a time-filler when the TV is doing babysitter duty.

3853104,4,B00267N3E0,"We can all breathe a big sigh of relief now that yet another licensed character franchise has saved Christmas from being destroyed. This time, it was the cute little technically-enabled-to-talk puppies from Disney's video series.

Christmas is either under siege from a bad person or a lack of spirit in these stories. This time, it's spirit that's under attack, with a general sense of lethargy and disillusion. Forgive me for spoiling the ending, saved by, as Scrappy Doo always says, ""Puppy power!"" (no, he does not appear in this film; that's another franchise).

I had no idea that Santa Claus had a canine business partner with the voice of Tom Bosley! But then, I also couldn't help thinking, when Santa entered the scene, the crowd would yell ""Norm!"" since Mr. George Wendt portrayed Kris Kringle with astonishing similarity to his Cheers TV character.

Sarcasm and snippiness aside, there are some pleasant aspects to Santa Buddies. Christopher Lloyd, who never phones in a performance and tackles each role with intensity and intelligence, brings quality to the Scrooge-like dog catcher.  Danny Woodburn carries much of the film as the head elf and Ben Giroux embodies the ""over it"" aspect of the holiday as a retail elf.

The North Pole & Santa's workshop were also nicely realized, and would be especially vivid in Blu-Ray. For a film of this kind, there is certainly a limited budget and clearly most of it was budgeted for these scenes (the cost of which may have inspired the filmmakers to overextend the film's conclusion when it seemed to be already resolved). The musical score was nice, too, with some original songs and a full chorus. Such touches add richness to the overall experience.

The extras were not plentiful beyond some sing-alongs and a music video. I would, and the kids would have, enjoyed a making-of feature, considering the somewhat expanded nature of this particular Buddies entry. Another nice idea might have been to have a ""video fireplace"" type feature with the cute puppies being cute, to leave on when during the holiday festivities. You could turn it on during those family get togethers to avert the pitfalls -- not that there are any, are there?",1259366400,,2192,4.942934782608695
3853105,3,B00267N3E0,"Colorful and frosted (if a touch sticky and stale) as hard ribbon candy, Robert Vince's ""Santa Buddies - The Legend of Santa Paws"" stars the popular talking golden retrievers in a sweet, quick-melting (88 minutes) Disney Christmas confection.

If the film has the feel of a Disney Channel TV movie (or a holiday ""Wonderful World of Color"") it's because the popular, precocious pups star with a Who's Who of 70s-80s sitcoms. Tom (""Happy Days"") Bosley voices Santa Paws, Tim (""Carol Burnett Show"") Conway kindly deputy dog Sniffer, and George (""Cheers"")Wendt a fittingly fat, mostly jolly Santa Claus.

The plot scatters more than the pups as little rebel Puppy Paws (son of Santa Paws, Santa Claus' dog, stay with me) goes to Fernfield, Washington to escape his place in the snow circle of life and be more like a real pup(echoing ""Pinocchio"" and ""Little Mermaid""). He's helped by Budderball, a buddy only wanting back on Santa's nice list after eating the Thanksgiving turkey. Together they help a hampered Santa deliver worldwide on Christmas Eve (shades of ""Santa Clause"") and restore weakening Christmas spirit. This is personified by drab portrayals of cynical, earthbound Santa and elf counteracted by ""real elf"" Eli (a fine Danny Woodburn), with magic icicles at the North Pole and around Puppy Paws' collar.

The ""true meaning of Christmas spirit"" advertised on the DVD's back cover doesn't stem from the icicles or from human voices stuffed down puppies' throats (""B-dawg"" and ""Buddha"" only the most annoying). Christopher (""Taxi"") Lloyd nearly (if not literally) steals the dog show as Fernfield's dog catcher Paul Cruge (rhymes with ""Scrooge""). At first he's dressed dark as Freddy Krueger driving a 50-year old van to a decrepit pound, cynical as former TV boss Louis DePalma.  But when he's lovingly attacked by puppies, meets a family in church then reads a child's pleading letter, Lloyd turns a cheesy echo of Christmas past into a real, pained person.

When puppy Tiny (who gets the film's only song) joins sickly boy Mikey on Christmas morning, when the buddies' owners pray for their pets' return and gleefully play with them when they do, you see the charm and love people feel for their dogs who, in their own way, talk with them.  ""Santa Paws"" even concludes with a surprising version of a classic Christmas hymn. (DVD extras include the Buddies singing traditional holiday songs.)

""Santa Buddies"" won't replace modern classic Christmas films (""Christmas Story,"" ""Elf"") which understand and subvert the season's cynicism in ways Disney by its mission cannot do. But puppies will always be cute, and when allowed to do so naturally ""Santa Buddies"" becomes a light, sweet Christmas treat for young children and dog lovers.",1259020800,,2742,5.093541202672606
3853106,4,B00267N3E0,"This is the latest in a series of Air Buddies films that includes Air Buddies (2006), Snow Buddies (2008), and Space Buddies (2009) as well as Santa Buddies. The five ""buddies"" visit the North Pole where Puppy Paws (son of Santa Paws) has become bored and restless. The major crisis involves a magical icicle that is melting as the world seems to be losing the Christmas spirit. Without any assistance from Al Gore, Puppy Paws and his friends rise to the challenge.

My rating is based on a compromise of two perspectives:  My own as an adult who has seen all of Disney's films and judges each new one according to the high standards set by classics such as Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, and Bambi (Three Stars), and, the perspective of children no older than six (Four Stars).  Add another Star for the ""bonus materials"" and the production values (image and sound) and divide by two. (The two-disco ""Combo Pack"" really is quite a bargain, offering both DVD and Blu-ray HD plus 5.1 Dolby Digital sound.) Younger viewers will have favorite scenes they enjoy seeing again and again and again. (I can't think of one I am eager to see again.) The combination of adorable puppies, the North Pole, Santa Claus, and the spirit of Christmas creates an exceptionally pleasant experience for them but, at least in my opinion, much less so for adults.

One final point. Unsupervised younger children have easy access to what Robert Burns characterizes as ""man's inhumanity to man"" in his poem, From Man was made to Mourn: A Dirge, (1785). Although I do not consider Santa Buddies to be comparable with a number of Disney classics, it does have a quality of innocence that I find refreshing and consider commendable. I hope that leaders in the film industry will continue to have the courage as well as the talents to produce films that affirm traditional values rather than glorify and (at least by implication) condone violence in one form or another.",1259020800,,1951,4.7804154302670625
3853107,3,B00267N3E0,"The talking puppies are back!  For those who have enjoyed the `Air Bud' and previous ""Buddies"" films... families, especially the young children will definitely enjoy this holiday film featuring the puppies in a Christmas adventure as they try to save Christmas in ""Santa Buddies: The Legend of Santa Paws"".

The Buddies are back and right on time for the holidays.  These ""Buddie"" films are just so cute and enjoyable, family fun films with cute puppies that you can't get enough of.

Since the 1997 debut of the film ""Air Bud"", from that film of a talking canine has launched several ""Buddie"" films featuring the golden retriever puppies in ""Air Buddies"", ""Snow Buddies"", ""Space Buddies"" and now their fourth film titled ""Santa Buddies: The Legend of Santa Paws"".  The Blu-ray release contains a Blu-ray and also a DVD for the film as well.

As with the previous ""buddies"" films, ""Santa Buddies"" reunites the golden retriever puppies (children of the original canine ""Air Bud""):

Budderball: The athletic puppy

Rosebud: The female puppy of the group

Buddha: The puppy who likes to eat everything

B-Dawg: The hip hop loving, street talking puppy

Mudbud: The puppy who just can't get enough of getting himself dirty and muddy

In ""Santa Buddies"", both Santa Claus (played by George Wendt, ""Cheers"", ""Sabrina the Teenage Witch) and Santa Paws worry about the weakening of Christmas Spirit.  Many children and dogs who do not believe in Santa Claus are now weakening the magical power of Christmas and its causing problems in the North Pole.  To make things worse, for some reason, the North Poe is starting to melt and the reindeer have all caught a flu.

Meanwhile, Santa Paws worries about his son Puppy Paws who has stopped believing in Christmas and leaves the North Pole without telling anyone after he sees a naughty list and sees a page of the buddy Budderbawl. Puppy Paws comes up with an idea to help Budderbawl get off the naught list if Budderbawl can teach him become a normal dog.

While Santa Claus and Santa Paws go to find the troublesome puppy,  things continue to get worse as the North Pole.  Elf Eli (played by Danny Woodburn, ""Watchmen"", ""Passions"") goes to retrieve the yearly Christmas mail from children and there are hardly any.

As Santa Claus, Santa Paus and the elves worry about Christmas Eve and people starting to not believe in Christmas anymore, Santa Paws meets up Budderbawl and tries to help him understand how Christmas and Santa is real.  Budderbawl ends introduces Puppy Paws to the other buddies and each buddy tries to teach him how to behave like a normal dog as Puppy Paws teaches them the Christmas spirit.

The film then showcases the buddies in an adventure trying to save dogs that have been captured by the dog catcher Stan Cruge (played by Christopher Lloyd, ""Back to the Future Films"", ""Stacked"", ""Taxi"") and an adventure that leads Puppy Paws and new friends having to save Christmas.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Santa Buddies: The Legend of Santa Paws"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  Despite being a direct-to-video title, one thing that Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment is good at is making their films look great on Blu-ray.  Picture quality showcases the Christmas colors of red and also warm colors of the holiday season.  Colors are vibrant, the detail of Santa's white fur on his clothing to the dog's hair is well-detailed.  Of course, there is CG utilized in the film beyond the mouth movements of the dogs as some special effects look quite low budget.  There are some banding issues that I saw during the film but nothing that interferes with view.  If anything, for a family film targeted towards children, picture quality is very good.

As for audio, the film is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD (48 kHz/24-bit), as well as French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The lossless soundtrack is pretty much front and center channel driven as dialogue is clear and understandable while the Christmas music comes out nice and clear.  This is not a film that has action sequences that utilize the whole soundscape, so for the most part, the audio is satisfactory for children.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are a few special features on this Blu-ray edition of ""Santa Buddies"" presented in 1080p, English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish.  Included are:

  * Sing Along to Christmas Carols With the Buddies - (3:29) The buddies sing ""Santa Paws is Comin' to Town"", ""Deck the Halls"" and ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"" while karaoke style sing along lyrics show up on the bottom of the screen.
  * ""Santa Claus is Comin' To Town"" Music Video - (3:29) A music video featuring Steve Rushton singing ""Santa Claus is Comin' To Town"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have watched the Buddy films alongside my son for several years now and for the most part, he has grown up watching these films and enjoying it.

""Santa Buddies: The Legend of Santa Paws"" is definitely a film directed towards the children.  For parents or teenagers, if they are dog lovers, they can probably enjoy the film and be entertained by the cuteness of the puppies and seeing the Disney magic at work and watch them talk.

I'm sure that young children will enjoy this film.  In fact, the inclusion of the DVD along with the Blu-ray can definitely be useful during those long holiday commutes.  But I will say that I was disappointed by the small amount of special features included with this release.  ""Space Buddies"" featured fun facts, bloopers and even a game for the children.  But this time, ""Santa Buddies"" only features a music video and a Christmas sing-along.

But that's the parent in me wanting a bigger bang for the buck.  But in the end, children will find this latest adventure featuring the buddies probably as entertaining as my six-year-old son did and in the long run, I suppose that's all that matters.

Overall, ""Santa Buddies: The Legend of Santa Paws"" was family tested, child approved.",1259020800,,6049,4.839337877312561
3853108,4,B00267N3E0,"I just finsihed watching a preview copy of this and I believe that it will be a Christmas must film for any family with very small children.  This is not a movie for adults.  It is, I repeat, a movie for kids.  (Though I know of dogs that enjoy watching dogs on TV, so perhaps it is also a movie for dogs and their owners.  I do not have a dog, but I recently dog-sitted an absolutely magnificent German Shepherd -- Hi Lion! -- for a couple of weeks with my daughter.  I noticed that he liked seeing dogs on TV, so this might have been something that he would have found fascinating.)  I mean, what kid wouldn't flip out for a movie with talking puppies?

The story itself will make a Scrooge-hearted adult cringe a bit.  I frankly didn't quite follow it.  Somehow or other Puppy Paws, Santa Claus's puppy, who has fled to some town in Washington in an effort to be a regular puppy and gotten himself caught by pound owner Stan Crudge (Christopher Lloyd), must be found and returned to the North Pole or Christmas will be in danger.  And there is something about a melting icicle in a cavern that also has to be saved so Christmas can be saved, though how this relates to Puppy Paws escapes me, though maybe this has something to do with the necklace around Puppy Paws's neck.  But hey!  This isn't about story.  It is about cute talking puppies who are able to fly at the end pulling a sleigh that takes Puppy Paws back to the North Pole.  And a poor kid who is sick and needs to a puppy to feel better (and gets the puppy named Tim).  And when Santa's reindeer are unable to pull Santa's sleigh, the Buddies (from Robert Vince's various Bud and Buddie movies) step in and pull a smaller one, with Puppy Paws dropping down chimneys to deliver the toys, to save Christmas.  And Tiny gets to sing a couple of songs.

Best scene:  a Golden Retriever puppy and the all white dog (not sure of the breed) who plays Puppy Paws roll around in moist dirt, enter the house, go into an all white room, and get dirt over everything.

Look, adults are not going to like this (except in cases noted above).  The plot is pretty hard to take (to the extent that it makes any sense at all) and it milks every emotion possible, but anyone who has had a small child or simply knows the taste of very young children (I'm talking ages 3 to 7) will recognize how they will get a kick out of this.  So remember, this movie is all about the kids.  And puppies.

This is another one of the Disney's dual packs, which contains both a DVD and Blu-ray copy of the film.  I think this is a great idea.  The one package is appropriate for any household.  And if a kid watches this at home on Blu-ray can watch it on DVD if they take it over to a friend's house.  Of if you watch it at home on Blu-ray, you can watch it on DVD in the car.
