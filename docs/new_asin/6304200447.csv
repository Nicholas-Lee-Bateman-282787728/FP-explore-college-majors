809832,5,6304200447,"As good as this made for TV remake was, I still think the original Piranha was a bit better even though I rate both this and the original 5 stars. I thought the prettiest female in this movie was Kehli O'Byrne (who did the  part of the boss at the kids camp Gina Green). Too bad she was killed by  the Piranha. Soleil Moon Frye (who did the part of the Gina's employee  Laura) was also very pretty. Too bad she was killed by the Piranha, too. Oh  well. If you liked the original Piranha, see this remake as well. Even if  you don't like this movie it will be worth the time. Too bad it was never  in the movie theater. Oh, well.",955152000,2,628,4.024193548387097
809852,4,6304200447,Piranha is a pretty good movie.  I bought this movie to see Mila Kunis as a.little girl and she was cute. When people was bitten by the Piranhas and their legs and arms were bloody it was kind of fake looking but it was still a good storyline.,1410480000,,243,4.0625

809856,1,6304200447,About the only reason to get this is that Lorissa Mccomas is in it.  They kill her character off at the 5 min mark! GRRRR,1265155200,8,121,3.84
809857,2,6304200447,"When I ordered ""Piranha"", I was expecting the B-Movie masterpiece by Joe Dante about killer fish invading a river which is also home to a childrens summer camp. What I got was this 1995 remake? I know there is a remake due out next year (in 3D to boot!) but had no idea this thing was sitting out there. Apparently this lousy little update produced by Roger Corman is a Showtime original movie. I remember the original had it's fair share of laughs, often times playing like a backwater homage to ""Jaws"", but while the original was a rip-off at least it was entertaining, this one tried to duplicate the horror/comdey formula..and fails.
Right off the bat, Corman goes for the gratuitous nudity, and things begin going downhill fast. Two kids on the make accidentally stumble into a secret research project while going skinny dipping in a piraha infested pool. Soon, the swarm of biters are making their way downstream to a populated area. There are tons of underwater shots of bubbles and and the water turns red, and that is about it as far as the gore content. There really isn't anything here that is inspired or original.
Alexandra Paul stars alongside William Katt (Greatest American Hero), and they do a decent job with what they are given, it's just that there is so little to work with, both seem kind of bored with the proceedings....and the viewer isn't far behind.
I guess there is good reason why this disk isn't readily available, but I'm sure when the next remake hits theaters, this disk will get a re-release....but unless it's under $5 don't waste your time.",1244419200,13,1576,4.693140794223827
809858,1,6304200447,"The original ""Piranha"" was an entertaining cult classic but the decision by Roger Corman to remake it, nearly twenty years later, must have entirely been for finacial reasons because this straight-to-video retread is about as half-baked as it gets. Aside from a few changes of some character's ethnicities and gender, this is almost an exact copy of the first film.
As was the case in the original, two troublesome kids decide to go swimming at a government test site and end up ""fish food"". Enter Alexandra Paul as a very butch-looking P.I. who is hired by one of the kids' legal guardians who also happens to be the owner of a new resort that is opening up. With the help of overacting hillbilly hermit, William Katt, she ends up at the test site and drains the pool causing the piranha to run amok in the local river system. Of course, the greedy resort owner isn't going to let something like giant man-eating killer fish ruin his plans to open his resort.
This new ""Piranha"" offers very little added value aside from possibly a little bit more gore and nudity but not even enough to really make it worth your while. Of course, we get to see a grown-up ""Punky Brewster"" as Soleil Moon Frye shows up as a summer camp counselor with Mila Kunis (many years before she broke out on ""That 70's Show"") as Katt's hydrophobic daughter. Alex Simon's screenplay should barely qualify as a ""studio rewrite"" as it is practically a word-for-word duplicate of the original John Sayles script. Even worse, the severe overacting of the cast really kills the memorable dialouge. Only Roger Corman would save production costs by recycling the underwater photography from the original for a remake. Needless to say if the producers of this film wouldn't waste their money on it then you probably shouldn't either.",1068163200,4,1798,4.766025641025641
809859,4,6304200447,"I really love this movie for one reason:  I was in it.  I play one of the kids in the summer camp (I'm wearing green and blue shorts).  I've even got pictures with Solie to prove it.  The funniest part about making this movie was that in the trailer that I would get dressed in, they kept a bloody skeleton prop that looked like it was eaten by piranahs.  Everyday as I would change into my wardrobe, that stupid thing would be staring right at me.  I really hated that.",1049328000,,470,4.166666666666667
809860,2,6304200447,"I baught this film for Soleil Moon Frye only and she does an excellent job in this cheesy horror film that is not scary and the pirahnas a little rubbery, also bad acting by William Katt.",1000684800,,187,4.222222222222222
809861,4,6304200447,"When a mutant school of Piranha are accidentally unleashed into the calm waters of northern Texas, all hell breaks out as tourists at a lake-front resort and kids at a nearby camp are savagely devoured by the monstrous fish.
The movie has a good cast, a good plot, good special effects (except that the fish don't actually move their fins while swimming), and tons of blood & gore.  You'll definitely like this new spin on the tired ""Jaws rip-off"" genre.",976406400,2,454,4.675

7864830,4,6304200447,"I like the cast, the actors actually act, the storyline was simple and the movie was going at an even pace. The only bad part ( spoiler alert) the piranha looked fake on screen. Considering the year it was made, and knowing that they couldn't use real piranhas, they did the best with what they had.",1467331200,,299,4.357142857142857
7864831,4,6304200447,"The main characters are Paul Grogan,  Maggie McNamara,  J.R. Randolph,  Dr. Leticia Baines, and Susie Grogan.

Maggie is a private investigator, tracking  J.R. Randolph's runaway step daughter.

Her job leads to a woodland area, and she convinces a reclusive man,  Paul Grogan, to assist her.  They track the runaway to an abandoned military institute deep in the woods.  While searching the base, they unintentionally release a pack of genetically modified Piranha.  Dr. Leticia Baines had created the Piranha, and had cared for, and guarded, them since the project had been abandoned.

These mutant Piranha were created to be able to live in any type of water - warn, cold, hot, fresh or salt.  They were also designed for increased intelligence and to breed rapidly.  They were living weapons, meant to do nothing but Kill.

The Piranha kill several people while travelling down river, including Dr. Leticia Baines.  Then attack a summer camp, where Paul's daughter, Susie Grogan, was spending the summer.  Finally they devour the guests at the opening of a luxury lake resort, financially ruining J.R. Randolph.

For fans of B Grade Horror Movies, Piranha is quite entertaining.",1454630400,,1182,5.169312169312169

7864833,3,6304200447,"Follows the same exact formula as Joe Dante's 70's classic rip-off of JAWS, but with plenty of comedy elements (even borrowing a lot of footage from that film, in true Roger Corman cost-saving fashion), but still a fun little film, especially of you have not seen the original. Nothing fantastic, but a good film for a rainy day.",1449532800,,329,4.689655172413793
