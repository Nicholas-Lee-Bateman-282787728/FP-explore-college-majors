8292684,5,B001DC159E,"A true game changer.  I am running this with my 6th-7th and 8th grade girls basketball team and it is leading to easy baskets and teaching my girls how to become better basketball players.  We are working our way through the layers and may get to incorporate all of them by the end of the season, but even if some players are using all of the layers and some are only using one or two, we can still function as an offense and the opponents don't truly know what we are doing.",1417737600,,475,4.1521739130434785
8292685,5,B001DC159E,We just purchased this and are going to be coaching elementary girls this year.  Looks like a GREAT way to really teach kids how to PLAY basketball and develop good instincts rather than teaching them just how to run the mechanics of a play.,1408579200,,241,4.4772727272727275
8292686,5,B001DC159E,I have seen this program used first hand and it's a great way to teach. I work with Jr High/High School aged kids and they really respond to it. Just a note!: those cheap spots that people buy are very thin and don't stick very well to the basketball floor. I have found fabulous spots that work perfectly with the program from ColoradoActiveLearning.com. They stick well and are very durable! I highly recommend this program.,1383177600,,426,4.693333333333333
8292687,5,B001DC159E,"This system would allow you to teach a motion to 4th graders if you wanted to.  I will be using about 10 of the layers with my 7th grade team.  It teaches the kids to play basketball vs following plays.  Just teaching the first 3 layers would allow most teams to win while playing great basketball.  As a team masters the first 3 layers, you as a coach can mix and match what and if you add any of the last 17 layers.",1381536000,,417,3.9879518072289155
8292688,5,B001DC159E,"I coach at a middle school in a very competitive league.  My team was going to be down in talent this season and I wasn't sure if they would be able to pick up on the Read and React.  The video was designed so that you could add little bits and pieces of it and build upon what you have learned.  I loved the fact that it just taught ""good basketball"" skills, yet in the framework of an offense.  It wasn't just a set of plays that would blow up if the defense didn't react in a certain way.",1372636800,,491,3.9292929292929295
8292689,2,B001DC159E,"I got this as a gift.  A 2 dvd set. the first DVD was just a lecture on the R&R offense - much too long.  the 2nd DVD goes through the steps of the offense, needs  more of the R&R drills ---- instead of trying to sell me another dvd and book to get these.",1358208000,4,255,3.6
8292690,5,B001DC159E,"I've been running the read and react for a year.  It's excellent for building a strong foundation while teaching the offense.  The drills include a number of skills while also implementing the offense.  No need to do seperat passing and layup drills when you can do them in drills that flow into the offense.  As Rick says, ""It allows you to crunch time frames.""",1332892800,2,362,4.609375
8292691,5,B001DC159E,"This is an excellent overview and plan for Basketball training.  I am planning to utilize this strategy for a youth league (both Boys and Girls team).

The instructions is easy to understand and implement.  It will provide the teams with a great foundation.",1323388800,2,257,4.930232558139535
8292692,5,B001DC159E,"I think this is a great offense to teach kids how to play basketball. Because I had only 4 weeks of practice before the New England Super Regionals, I was able to only put in a few layers - dribble penetration including post slides, pass & cut & laker cuts.

I had a lot of height on this team so I went with a 3-out 2-in set.

Below is a link to some video highlights of my 12U team. While the video doesn't necessarily have great ""textbook examples"" (I had limited game footage and many of the highlights are baskets off transition), notice the passing! I attribute much of this great teamwork to the principles of the R&R offense.

[...]

Next year, I am looking to put in a few more layers. These kids are still very young and are soaking this stuff up!!!

Thanks,
