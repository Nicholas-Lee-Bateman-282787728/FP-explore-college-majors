5168423,5,B008KCGQD0,"I came across this while looking for a good mystery series.  It is a very well made Australian series.  I am looking forward to Series 2.  I have now read a couple of the books and the show takes a bit of liberty with the story, but I really enjoyed the characters as they were presented in the show.  PBS should pick this up if only to give us the opportunity to watch it without having to pay a fortune for foreign DVD.  If you are looking for a funny, action filled murder mystery series this one will be a real pleasure.",1355788800,13,524,4.098039215686274
5168424,3,B008KCGQD0,"This DVD won,t play on a US DVD player but they will on a computer.
If you expect to see the exact plot line from the books, forget it. However if you're looking for a mystery series, you're in luck. Some of the characters aren't as I had imagined them and some have been left out entirely. The story line holds up and the period costuming is on the money.
I enjoyed them and intend to get the next set.",1348963200,8,403,4.05
5168425,4,B008KCGQD0,"Move over, Mrs Bradley - there's another jazz-age lady sleuth in town! Author Kerry Greenwood first began writing her series of ""Phryne Fisher"" books in 1989, and earned legions of fans worldwide with her glamorous, sharp-witted 1920's heroine, Miss Phryne Fisher.

The Hon. Phryne Fisher has returned to Melbourne, Australia after many years of living abroad.  Despite her well-heeled manner, Phryne hides a hardscrabble childhood spent in abject poverty, and is still haunted by the mysterious disappearance of her beloved sister Janey.  It takes only a few moments after Phryne's arrival on the Melbourne dock for the murders and mysteries to start, but with her talent for attracting friends from all walks of life, including cab drivers Bert (Travis McMahon) and Cec (Anthony Sharpe), Mr Butler (Richard Bligh), Constable Hugh Collins (Hugo Johnstone-Burt), Aunt Prudence (Miriam Margolyes), Dr Mac (Tammy Macintosh) and new ward Jane (Ruby Rees Wemyss), Phryne is ready for anything!

Essie Davis plays the resourceful Miss Fisher and it is indeed a sensational performance.  One of Australia's finest, Ms Davis beautifully covers all the facets of Phryne with style and boundless energy.  And that's not a wig - the quick turnaround on the filming of this series required Davis to dye and blunt-cut her own hair into Miss Fisher's sleek signature black bob.

Volume 1 includes the following episodes:

""Cocaine Blues"" - Fresh off the ship from London, Miss Phryne Fisher's Melbourne homecoming will have to take a backseat when she is asked to unravel the bizarre link between a chain of murders and a continental bath, which Phryne soon discovers disguises an opium syndicate and an illegal abortion ring.  Guest stars Maria Mercedes, Kristof Piechocki and Miranda Otto.

""Murder on the Ballarat Train"" - Phryne and new companion Dot Collins (Ashleigh Cummings) board the train to Ballarat in order to collect her new Hispano-Suiza sports car, but when the train makes a short overnight water-stop at Bacchus Marsh, a corpse is later discovered dangling from the water tower.  Guest stars Maeve Dermody, Jacek Koman, Victoria Eagger, Abbe Holmes and David Berry.

""The Green Mill Murder"" - Phryne must untangle a web of blackmail encircling old family friends when a dead body shows up on the dancefloor of Melbourne's most decadent new speakeasy, the Green Mill.  Guest stars Deni Hines, Arthur Angel, Wendy Hughes, Lauren Clair, Rohan Nicol and Toby Schmitz.

""Death at Victoria Dock"" - Whilst she investigates the disappearance of the daughter of an automobile factory owner, Phryne also becomes caught up in the world of the Latvian anarchists who are striking on Victoria Dock.  Guest stars Robert Grubb, Penne Hackforth-Jones, Karlis Zaid and Vladimir Tsyganov.

""Raisins and Almonds"" - When the owner of a bookshop in Melbourne's Jewish community suddenly drops dead, Phryne is led into a fascinating case involving old family wounds and the formula for synthetic rubber.  Guest stars Tim Draxl, Kat Stewart, Adam Schmerl, Brian Lipson and Adrian Mulraney.

""Ruddy Gore"" - A vengeful theatre ghost doesn't have much of an appreciation for Gilbert & Sullivan, as Phryne soon discovers in one of her most bizarre cases, which also leads her to her first encounter with Lin Chung (Phillipe Sung).  Guest stars Peter Cousens, Christie Whelan, Alex Rathgeber, Debra Lawrance and Bille Brown.

""Murder in Montparnasse"" - Phryne's post-war occupation as an artist's model in Paris comes back into the spotlight when Veronique Sarcelle (Linda Cropper), the widow of the artist who considered Phryne to be his greatest muse, travels to Melbourne and asks Phryne to help solve his puzzling death.  Guest stars Vince Colosimo, Peter O'Brien, Nick Carrafa, Renaud Jadin and Ben Prendergast.",1344902400,12,3793,5.257048092868988

8528647,5,B008KCGQD0,"This series is sooo good. They changed it from the books and it is worth it for Phyrne's clothes, they are fabulous.

and she always does the right thing!",1383696000,,275,4.52
8528648,1,B008KCGQD0,It was not able to play on my CD player.  I had opened the package before I realized this.  I returned it but did not receive credit for it as I was told the requirement had been indicated on the description of the product.  It was an expensive mistake.  I suggest the limitation be made more obvious so that other people ordering what they think is a regular or customary CD are not surprised that it isn't.,1376524800,,408,4.259740259740259
