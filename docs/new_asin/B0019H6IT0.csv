8274031,5,B0019H6IT0,"After being reunited, Arika and Mashiro decide to head back to Windbloom and settle things with Nagi. Fortunately, Natsuki and her friends are heading that way too. Mai and Mikoto from My Hime also show up to join the battle. Once the fight reaches Garderobe, Nina and Nagi are there to stop their advance. Nina cannot disobey Nagi because her father's life is hanging in the balance. The final battle is intense, emotional, and very cool.

This series started out weak, and disappointed me quite a lot. As the story moved along, I got into it more. By the 4th DVD I was sold. This series still isn't as good as the original, but it is very entertaining in its own way. The ending is very emotional and there is tons of action in the last DVD. If you saw the 1st series, I think that you will enjoy this one.",1356307200,,808,4.3509933774834435
8274032,3,B0019H6IT0,3 STARS because most of the fun declined after the take over of the school. But it is still had action /adventure of course. It is still well done and creative as before. But what i do not like is the war. But the theme of creating a world of peace is what i like the most.,1355961600,,273,3.807017543859649
8274033,4,B0019H6IT0,"I enjoyed this Anime collection very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was amusing and enjoyable.
In its way as good as the original My-Hime. Buying from sellers of good used dvds I bought this collection for a price a little less than a collection box set would normally cost. The shipping cost can be reduced if you go directly to the sellers web site when ordering more than one item. Make sure you can trust them.",1253577600,,510,4.322916666666667
