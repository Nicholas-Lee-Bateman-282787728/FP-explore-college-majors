8325505,4,B000NQRWWU,"The product is a great introduction to the interface of Vue which guides you through functionality of the tools. The tutorial was most useful when using the ""Geeks at Play"" material which can be found on the web. Geeks at Play assume that you understand the Vue interface and tend to concentrate more on how to accomplish spectacular scenery. If you aren't familiar with the tools in the Vue interface you can quickly get discouraged because the results won't be as nice. Although Geeks at Play does offer a Vue Interface tutorial I found this DVD to be more in depth in that respect.

There are two issues which were not great. The first is that the DVD was released during Vue 5 and makes references to the now permanent features of Vue 6 which were in beta at the time. EcoSystem 2 and the new Clouds are briefly mentioned but not how to use them. Similarly some of the new functions in function editor were not covered either. This was not a huge problem since the Vue 5 and Vue 6 interfaces are very similar and I bought the Vue 6 Revealed book as a supplement.

The second issue is that the media will not play on my standalone DVD player (manufactured 2006 Panasonic) connected a Television. It would only play on the PC. I found this a little awkward because I had to keep switching from the Media Player to the Vue 6 application in order to do the tutorials. To resolve this, I played this DVD on my laptop and used my desktop to work with the Vue 6 application. For those who don't have the two computer option be warned!

Overall I found the product useful and educational. I reduced the rating of the video by one star because it is dated to Vue 5 and does not cover the latest Vue 6 functionality well.

Unfortunately, there is a learning curve to Vue in order to produce the types of results that production studios achieve. After two months of working with  Vue 6 Infinite I am getting much better at producing realistic scenes. As I am learning, it takes a while to learn how to get up to the quality of ""Pirates of the Carribean."" This product has had a significant role in achieving that goal.",1205107200,6,2111,4.402564102564103
