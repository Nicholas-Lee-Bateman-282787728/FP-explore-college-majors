1711441,4,B0000665S8,"I remember watching this movie when I was about 7 years old around Christmas time. For the next few Christmases, I would check the TV guide to find out when it would be on again. Sadly, I don't think this movie has aired since the 80s. This is a truly wonderful, heartwarming story that really captures true Christmas spirit, which I feel is lacking in most modern Christmas movies.

Young Robbie's grandfather (Mickey Rooney) has promised to show him Christmas time in NYC. Grandfather dies shortly before they are to leave for their trip...but heaven gives him a second chance to take his grandson to NYC.

Now I am almost 30 and I still check the TV listings every year just in case it airs. It never does, so I am going to purchase the VHS .

I recommend this underated movie for anyone who loves Christmas.",1102464000,17,811,4.503401360544218
1711442,5,B0000665S8,"My mother and I both love this movie and wish it would either air again on TV, or come out for purchase on DVD.  It is a sweet Christmas movie that brings the real meaning of Christmas to light.  Mickey Rooney is great in it!  I just wish it was available again!!!",1102032000,12,264,4.038461538461538
1711443,5,B0000665S8,"This is one film that I wish was still aired during the holiday season.
Mickey Rooney stars as Mike Halligan, a loveable, devoted grandfather to Scott Grimes who plays Robbie Westin. Robbie and Mike are extremely close and are looking forward to spending the holiday season together. When Mike suffers a fatal heart attack, Christmas joy suddenly turns to Christmas sorrow, devastating Mike's daughter (Robbie's mom), Robbie and the rest of the Westin family.
As Mike arrives in Heaven (a very short montage), he asks for a second chance at life, because he has promised Robbie that they would go to New York for Christmas.  An angel gives Mike an assignment that allows him to return to Earth, but for only a short time.  Robbie accepts and welcomes Mike's second chance at life and Mike and Robbie take off for New York without the rest of Robbie's family knowing it, which sends the family into a confused, astonished dash for New York in search of their son.
The real impact of the movie comes when Mike and Robbie arrive in New York.  Annie Potts (Ghostbusters, Pretty in Pink, Designing Women) who plays Cindy Mills, a news reporter, sets out on assignment to find the true meaning of Christmas in New York, and is left empty-handed and wondering  what has happened to Christmas.  Mike and Robbie, in the triumphant conclusion, help her and many other New Yorkers re-discover the meaning of Christmas.  The ending is quite a tear-jerker as Mike and Robbie are reunited with their family on Christmas Eve.
It Came Upon a Midnight Clear is a family film.  It sends that warm feeling through you that causes you to appreciate your family and the memories that come with each Christmas.  Although this movie is not aired on television anymore (obviously because of it's family values), I still recommend that you search for it in the dusty holiday corner of your local video store.  It really brings the holidays right to you, and may become a holiday viewing tradition.",1067644800,74,1972,4.793510324483776

While his granddad was putting up the outside Christmas lights, he had a heart attack and everyone thought he had died.

We watched it the night it came in and while the VHS is not the best picture the film was fun to watch and just as good as I remembered it.  The plot is pure fantasy but it is a Christmas movie so what else could it be.  Mickey is the grandfather to the kid and has promised to take him to New York to see what a real Christmas is like, I said it was a fantasy right.  Mick dies before the trip but is sent back to earth from heaven to find the spirit of Christmas who is missing in NYC.  It plays out well and there are some good supporting players to help with the story.  Interesting side note for me is the child who plays the grandson is Scott Grimes who is a pretty good singer/actor today and gave such a great performance in Band of Brothers as Malarky.",1354665600,2,971,3.8542713567839195

The relationship between grandpa, (retired police officer,NYC) & grandson  is the kind of relationship all kids wish they had. Put together a New Yorker & a California kid  & It spells true adventure. I don't want to give the story away; but what I can say is this. They search for something I think all of us has lost today, & I hope we can get it back before it's too late. I can honestly say, to me, this movie ranks right up there with Natalie Woods & that Thanksgiving Parade. There are just some movies that are timeless & certain times of the year you really want to visit them like old friends.  This is a 5star must. Sit back pop popcorn & put on the christmas lights.

It can however be purchased (for a substantial wad of cash) from eBay or Half.com on VHS.  I was so grateful to find a DVD of it on Amazon!!! I give it nine stars for being one of the best of its genre (Family Holiday Movie). It's wholesome without being too cloying. There are a few scenes of heaven and angels but it isn't dreadfully religious. The young child star in this movie, Scott Grimes, is a great actor. He is a nice, kind but not disgustingly cutesy kid (how I miss this sort of low-key child acting in movies today). Mickey Rooney and Scott Grimes have a very amazing synergy in this movie. I really miss watching this movie on TV. I watched it repeatedly during the couple of years it was playing, which is something I don't usually do. It's as good as Miracle on 34th Street, so why don't they show it anymore?  Why doesn't anyone digitally restore this classic masterpiece?

1711595,5,B0000665S8,"A real treasure for Xmas - Mickey Rooney stars in this underrated tale of retired NYC detective and grandfather Mike Halligan, living in Southern California with his daughter's family, which includes his devoted grandson Robbie. Suffering a fatal heart attack, Rooney arives in Heaven and strikes a deal with the head angel to return to Earth and find a missing Christmas angel-enabling ""poppa"" to keep his promise to Robbie;
Rooney's character is given an extension until Xmas, flees with Robbie to NYC  to show his grandson a real Christmas, find the lost angel and restore the spirit of Xmas to the Big Apple before returning to Heaven.

A heartwarming story that is not too sugary, with a stellar performance by Mickey Rooney aided by an able cast of characters straight out of a Damon Runyon novel (including the venerable Lloyd Nolan). Just right for family viewing this flick has been a holiday tradition in my household each christmas for the past 26 years.

Rarely broadcast these past ten or more years, it has been shoved aside in favor of the Hallmark Xmas movie du jour (and it seems like there is a new piece of slop every day leading up to Christmas).

Brings a basket of smiles along with a tub of emotions and tears. Met Mickey Rooney a few years ago at a show and he said it was one of his favorite films due to its message and holiday warmth: he was truly happy so many people included it ""right near the top of their Christmas viewing favorites-alongside gems like ""It's A Wonderful Life""!

I have an old worn out copy of this and I watch it all the time, not just at Christmas. Being incredible close to my own grandfater and having him pass away not long before Christmas makes this movie even more speical to me. It's a very classicly simple story about family, love, loss, letting go, acceptance and the things that you value most in life. Every time I see it I do cry because it's so heartwarming. I wish that the TV stations would run this movie so that I could get it on tape again. To buy it again costs a lot of money but it's worth it.",1276819200,3,677,3.985294117647059

1711599,5,B0000665S8,"This TV made movie is a little silly, but the message is really something touching.
Mickey Rooney's character suffers a heart attack before he can take his grandson
to New York for Christmas.  When he goes to heaven and protests being there, the
angels send him back for three days to find the angel who was to bring the spirit
of Christmas to New York.
There are some funny moments, some that maybe could be eliminated.  But the
conclusion with Mickey Rooney understanding that he must bring the spirit of
Christmas really is worth the whole movie.  It makes you want to hear his
talk over and over  because it inspires you to make a difference.

The main character does die in the end, but the grandson knows that his
grandfather helped bring Christmas to New York,  .. Our family has watched
it over and over and it is part of our Christmas tradition along with Wonderful
Life.",1263772800,2,880,4.537974683544304
1711600,5,B0000665S8,What a great find this was for me.  For years I have been watching for this to come on TV again but it has never happened.  I remembered as a great Christmas about a boy and his grandfather.  It was as great as I remembered it.  It arrived quickly and as soon as I found a video player (not on dvd) I viewed it. Thank you so much,1262995200,3,329,3.7941176470588234
1711601,5,B0000665S8,"Of all the Christmas movies I have ever seen, IT CAME UPON THE MIDNIGHT CLEAR is definitely one of the best.  Unlike most of the so-called ""Holiday"" movies that come out today, IT CAME UPON THE MIDNIGHT CLEAR is a Christmas movie with no apologies.  It was first aired on television in the early 80s, and back then people weren't ashamed to have the word ""Christmas"" in a title or description.  And they made much better Christmas movies back then (and before) than they do now.  MIDNIGHT CLEAR is top notch family entertainment.

In this film, Mickey Rooney gives one of his finest performances (almost as good as his Emmy and Golden Globe Award winning portrayal of Bill Sackter in 1981's BILL).  And in my book, this movie ranks right up there with IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.

I really, really wish IT CAME UPON THE MIDNIGHT CLEAR was available on DVD.  Occasionally, an old, obscure made-for-television movie like this will be released on DVD for a very short time and then suddenly go out of print again.  This is what happened with BILL/BILL ON HIS OWN.",1259452800,,1055,4.629032258064516
1711602,5,B0000665S8,"I love this movie.  My kids love this movie.  My husband nearly wore out the VHS copy watching it over and over.  It is such a wonderful Christmas movie, and watching Mickey Rooney is pure joy.  I keep waiting year after year to see if it will make it to DVD, so we can have a better experience watching it, without the really slow spooling of worn and loose tape that makes the sound so terrible it is nearly unwatchable.  We watch it anyway, and wait for someone to release it on DVD.  I will buy five copies for myself and family members!  Is anybody listening?",1259452800,,564,4.264150943396227
1711603,4,B0000665S8,the movie arrived on time looking ok. box was slightly worn but i was more interested in the tape quality. the beginning looked a little pinched but when i put it in my vcr it played perfectly with good quality. was somewhat deterirated in quality but not enough to bother me for the dvd copy i made of it. dealing with the seller was ok. they reqested this review and i am happy to comply and share this . if i needed something else and they had it i would have no problems ordering from them in the future.  kenduski.,1255305600,,519,4.19
1711604,5,B0000665S8,"As so many have already noted, this is a wonderful Christmas film,
and it has not been shown on television for a long, long time.

According to Copyright Office records, the copyright is held by
CPT Holdings (the CPT stands for Columbia Pictures Television),
and this entity was subsumed by Sony around 2001/2002. The
IMDB site lists Sony Pictures Television as the distributor.

So, maybe if Sony Pictures Televsion starts getting some
requests, they'll put out a DVD.

It would be great if they could do it while Mickey is still
alive--would be a nice tribute to him.",1229385600,,569,4.785714285714286

1711620,5,B0000665S8,"I agree with all these other reviews, that this movie should be aired every year.  I have strong, fond memories of being at my grandmother's house on Christmas Day and watching this with my family.  It was an annual tradition until one year we realized it wasn't aired any more.  With all the cheesy, uninspired TV movies that are playing around the clock this holiday, why not put a real, family-values style holiday movie back on the air?  There was a place to show this back in the '80s when most of us had three channels.  You can't tell me there isn't room on the hundreds of channels we have now.  If a movie I remember from childhood has such a lasting impression on me today, aren't today's viewers missing out?  Bring this back to the airwaves, or at least release it on DVD for this generation.",1197936000,5,804,4.428571428571429

It's a shame that this movie hasn't been released on DVD yet - much to the disappointment of my Fiancee, who this was a gift for since it is her favorite Christmas movie - but if you have to have a VHS for anything, then you should hope that it's of this type of quality!",1186876800,3,431,4.070588235294117

And contrary to the films mentioned, It Came Upon the Midnight Clear can appeal to all audiences.  And Mickey Rooney is great!

There is a Mickey Rooney Website that takes feedback and I wrote strong comments about them releasing this movie again.  I don't know what it can do, but maybe something.
