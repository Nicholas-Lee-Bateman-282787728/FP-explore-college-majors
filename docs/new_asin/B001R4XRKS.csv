There, 20 words... AVOID .. unless you're the type who washes your floors with raw bleach and keeps your dvd's in a stack on a living room speaker, but always wonders ""I wonder why my  movies be freezin' up??"", then this this film is definitely for you..",1398124800,,464,4.578313253012048

3773405,4,B001R4XRKS,"Barney Bumble is a fool as usual and Larry Poppins, played by James Bridges, is hilarious!! I'm glad to see that Turtle finally get's his in the end, although I think Oscar took things a little too far. The soundtrack music is SLAMMIN!!!! Hardcore fans of the first film may enjoy this. Anyone else, they should watch the first installment, then this.",1241913600,,351,4.67741935483871

3773407,5,B001R4XRKS,"Todd Bridges is dynamite in this picture.  I am going to watch it again, for a third time!  However, I didn't like the scene where the latino actor pooped in the cat's litter box.  And I thought the obese actor who went around the set with an open umbrella, even going to the bathroom with it,--was lame.  Overall.though, I give the movie six stars and thumb-ups!!!!!!",1476576000,,368,4.53030303030303

3773418,1,B001R4XRKS,"The current rating of 2.5 is way to generous. If you don't mind wasting over an hour of your life to a movie that could be filmed better on a i-phone then go for it.
Pros: If you know who Todd Bridges is then this is the only pro for the entire movie is his 80's star power name..
Cons: *Terrible Acting *Everything is way overacted *Music score is terrible and for being in the bay area there is way more musicians/rappers they could have got to make this movie gel and actually work better *Director is Terrible as the film had no direction or vision and it just ""bumbled"" all the way through to the end *Some reviews have said if you like the Friday movie Franchise you will like this movie: UH...No You won't as this is pure garbage *Some reviews say that if you like Cheech And Chong movies you will like this...NO, you won't and the only similarity is both movies had weed in it other than that this is the worst acted worst produced piece of garbage of a movie that looks so dated. * Pretty much this cannot be compared to any other movies as this one is pure and utter garbage! So embarrassed for all of the bay area for this movie as this one is ridiculous! This maybe funny if your a three year old because you won't understand what the heck these guys are saying!
If you value your time at all stay away! Support and watch another independent flick that is actually decent. This movie quite honestly deserves 0 stars! If you paid a cent for this movie you paid too much and hopefully you can get a refund on your money",1467417600,,1529,4.239726027397261
3773419,2,B001R4XRKS,Two stars because I think Todd bridges owed drug dealers money so he made this movie. Worth the entertainment value,1466985600,,115,4.8

8337421,3,B001R4XRKS,"Basically this is a goofy, low budget, B movie with less than experienced actors. But I still rated it a 3/5 you say? ""Watchu talkin about Willis?!"" Well...if you take it for what it's worth and watch it with a BUD it can be a quite enjoyable experience. The picture I included is to show that my case came damaged so be carwful if you order this movie from Amazon. Less popular movies sit in the warehouse longer and are moved multiple times and have more potential to come broken.",1501200000,,482,4.366666666666666
