1848584,5,B00008J2OP,"DEA agents risk their lives,some are killed,their sacrifice is  swept under the rug by Mexican and American Gov....mexico owes american banks billions of dollars, pay banks millions in interest, this is the reason American president and gov. in 1985 wanted the  focus on domestic drugs not foreign because america does not want to upset foreign gov.....guess the same goes for Americas unsecured borders.........",1154736000,,412,5.523809523809524
1848585,2,B00008J2OP,"The true Camarena case is a rather interesting story that deserved to be brought to the big screen but it was at least brought to the small screen as a 6 hour TV miniseries spanning 3 days in January 1990. Well I was too young to have seen it then, and I guess I missed out terribly because in 2003 a TWO HOUR (what the...?) DVD version came out. It is obviously a watered down and extremely edited version of the original but I can only assume, since I never had the chance to see the original series. What were the producers of this DVD thinking? Serious loop holes, little to no character buildup, key figures in the case are simply ommited or they were edited out, like Ernesto Fonseca, Caro Quintero's partner and accused accomplice in the torture/murder of Agent Camarena, is seen only twice (?) and doesnt speak a word? Felix Gallardo another key figure, is only but a name in the credits, he is NEVER introduced in the DVD movie (although Caro Quintero and Fonseca Carrillo are) so viewers unfamiliar with the case don't even notice him or his role in the torture/murder...also along with Camarena, his Mexican pilot was also kidnapped, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, and in this movie he is ""played"" by Pepe Serna of Kingpin and Scarface fame, yet he is seen for like 5 seconds, flying an airplane, and only mentioned ONCE by a US official, so people watching this movie don't even know WHO he is, or where in the movie he is? His kidnapping from Guadalajara airport is not even depicted in the movie. Why omit an important part of the story? Jacob Vargas is also in the end credits as ""Jose Zavala"" yet in the movie, Jacob Vargas NOR ""Jose Zavala"" ever come up. What gives? I just hope in the future, producers come to their senses and release the FULL miniseries in a multi-disk pack instead of a chopped up, sloppy excuse for a movie. If your gonna release a movie that many say is one of the greatest TV movies of all time, then why erase more than half of it? It makes no sense, avoid this movie if your interested in the real Camarena story and pick up a book instead, Desperados by Elaine Shannon on which this movie is based (loosely).",1136851200,13,2144,4.444162436548224
1848586,3,B00008J2OP,"There is just too much going on in the movie for the producers to have condensed it into the 2 hour 15 min time frame on the DVD. While this is a decent summary of the original series, there isn't enough in here to get the point of the story across.

Should have been a double disc. This abridgement of the movie doesn't justify the power of these drug cartels and the political strength they have on both sides of the border.",1130803200,6,426,4.195121951219512
1848587,5,B00008J2OP,"Drug Wars: The Camarena Story is a great movie, but scary cause it's true and really happened.

the story centers around Enrique ""kike"" Camarena, a DEA agent in Mexico who is kidnapped, tortured, and killed by a mexican drug cartel.  what follows is the war on the drugs, the war on corrpution and evil, and the war for justice for Camarena.

the acting is amazing, the story is amazing, the movie is amazing.

editing is rather poor, and i honestly didn't know it was a mini-series before. the movie runs about 2 hours 15 minutes, but it's worth it, every minute of it. the sound in some parts is bad and i think some parts are dubbed over, but aside from that, this is an amazing movie because it's all true.

if you thought Traffic was good, check out the Camarena story. you'll never forget it...",1113091200,4,800,4.4520547945205475
1848588,1,B00008J2OP,"When I first saw this mini-series I was impressed by it's depth and it's message.  A group of policemen fighting against all odds, corruption and politics.  It could even be stereotyped as a plot of good against evil.  That was the original series.  What they have done on the DVD was to condense it so much that the message, the rhythm, all the meaning is if not lost, very hard to find.  Critical scenes were cut and the plot doesn't make sense any more.  If you have never seen the original, this might entertain you, but if you saw it, you will be disappointed.",1073260800,23,565,4.384615384615385
1848589,1,B00008J2OP,"When I heard that 'Drug Wars' was being released on DVD, I was pleased. It is, in fact, one of the best American TV miniseries' ever made. However, this disc is not 'Drug Wars', but is rather a crude approximation of it. They took the 280 minute feature and edited it into a 130 minute trailer. All narrative depth is gone, and character development is non-existent. Also, it seems to have been re-edited so randomly that the plot ceases to make sense at several points. The reissue of this film was pointless, because it is not 'Drug Wars.' Why even bother releasing the film if you are going to deliberately sabotage it?",1059091200,32,622,4.5625
1848590,5,B00008J2OP,I really enjoyed this movie and it is reminder that nothing has changed in the war on drugs except that it has become worse. All the actors did a good job.,1438473600,,155,4.032258064516129

1848599,5,B00008J2OP,Correct depiction of what actually happened. Del toro performance was immense. More true to life dvd are more in demand,1362268800,,119,5.0
1848607,1,B00008J2OP,"I had read about the complaints customers made about the DVD to this movie, how a huge chunk was cut from the original.  But, for some crazy reason, I thought the VHS tape would be different.  Boy, was I wrong.  It's exactly the same as the DVD version.  Worse yet, I saw the running time of the original movie, and it's supposed to be a two-part mini-series.  That's over 240 minutes of air time.  The DVD and VCR tape only show 130 minutes.  That's 110 minutes that was cut which is a big rip-off.  I'm glad the tape was cheap, but, at the same time, it also means that I got exactly what I paid for.

So, to anyone who happens to read this review, if you plan to purchase a DVD of a TV show, or TV movie, be very cautious.  These companies who are putting this stuff on DVD are making a ton of money off of unsuspecting customers who buy them expecting to get the entire show.  It's not there, folks.",1339027200,6,903,4.132183908045977
1848608,1,B00008J2OP,"I SAW THE MIN-SERIES AND IT WAS GREAT.  VERY INFORMATIVE.  BUT I BOUGHT THE DVD AND I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH
IT.  WHY WOULD YOU CUT OUT THE KEY POINTS OF THE MOVIE?  I HAVE NO IDEA.  I WOULD LIKE TO THE THE MINI-SERIES BUT
UNCUT.  UNTIL THEN I WILL LET OTHERS THAT HAVE SEEN IT NOT TO BOTHER BUYING THE VIDEO BECAUSE YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED AS I WAS.",1325203200,3,355,4.0
1848609,1,B00008J2OP,As with many other reviews I was truly disappointed. The editing is spotty at best.  Seeing the whole mini series would have been alot better.  The shorter version lost alot of the characters and isn't really worth the time watching it.  I have heard of the mini series and hav not seen it.  So as many people who have already commented - I am waiting for the mini series to come out on dvd.  It is truly an injustice of what they had done with the film.  It would have been better to release it in its entirety.,1296518400,9,512,4.173469387755102
1848610,2,B00008J2OP,I saw this movie when it aired on tv and so much of the movie was not included in this video. this video does not tell the whole story and it's a shame because this was a really great film. i tried contacting the company who released the video and had no success. Drug wars the whole movie is a great film.,1296345600,,306,3.9516129032258065
1848611,2,B00008J2OP,"I bought a copy of the ""Drug Wars"" and was extremely disappointed; all the main plot were eliminated. There is one scene in which the drug lord started to explain to his guys why he got into the drug business, selling it to America; it was a beautiful scene that was
eliminated. They condensed it very badly. I would advice buyer to be very careful about this buy; now if a buyer had never sean the series, he/she might not know what is missing. I would have returned the VHS, but decided to throw it away instead.",1293580800,4,514,4.309278350515464
1848612,3,B00008J2OP,"Drug Wars II was 10 times better than this one.  If I could find it on dvd, I would get it.  I thought this one would be similar.  But, not really.",1241222400,,147,3.6774193548387095

1848614,5,B00008J2OP,"this dvd is based on a true story. lot of young people, men in many examples,think they are drug lords because of 'the money they gain'. it is independent of nationality, in this case, a mexican young man. I think this dvd will be better if artisan home entertainmente and zzy production release it again, including more 2 hours from the original.",1215216000,2,347,4.612903225806452
1848615,1,B00008J2OP,Too many scenes were cut out from the original film. The scenes that were cut out greatly dilutes the full impact of this case and the conclusion as it relates to the consequences of those corupt individuals involved in the murder of Kiki Camerena.,1207440000,3,248,4.659090909090909
1848616,5,B00008J2OP,"Drug Wars: The Camarena Story was a 1990 TV mini-series based on Elaine Shannon's book 'Desperados' and the Time magazine article of the same name.  This is a fact-based story of undercover DEA agent Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena,  While stationed in Guadalajara, Camarena (Bauer) uncovered a large-scale marijuana operation in a region of Northern Mexico. This discovery led to Camarena's death.  His disappearance sparked a massive U.S.-led investigation, which unraveled an unsettling conspiracy involving military cover-ups, the drug mafias, and political corruption in Mexico.

Starring Steven Bauer, Craig T. Nelson, Treat Williams, and Elizabeth Pena. Executive Producer: Michael Mann.",1190678400,2,686,5.969387755102041
