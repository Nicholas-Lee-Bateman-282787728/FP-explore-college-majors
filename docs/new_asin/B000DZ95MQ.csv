2475381,5,B000DZ95MQ,An excellent and touching documentary about a period in American history when racism was strong and human decentcy was sometimes absent.,1147219200,,136,5.523809523809524
2475382,5,B000DZ95MQ,"This film is ""required reading"". A true story with a compelling message that resonates globally, this movie reveals God's heart. It is about people; a boy who was murdered, men who murdered, injustice, fear, hate and undying love - the only kind of love.

High praises to the filmmaker, whose transparency allowed the truth of a now 50 year old story to speak fresh as if the news broke live today on your TV screen or on your Blackberry.

Sometimes you need more than an RSS feed, an iPod moment, or an action drama to invigorate you to the truth of life. You need truth and the Untold Story of Emmett Till is about Truth.",1144627200,5,623,4.408695652173913
2475383,5,B000DZ95MQ,"The "" Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till"" is told from the real experience and voices of Emmett Louis Till family, friends and leaders of the nation taking an active role in bringing this case to justice.

50 years ago, 14 year-old Emmett Louis Till was kidnapped from his uncle's house in Money, Mississippi, beaten to death, murdered and thrown into Tallahatchie River, for whistling at a white woman Carolyn Bryant.

The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till revisits Till's death and the trial acquittal of the two men, Roy Bryant and J.W Milam, who later confessed to the crime in a magazine interview (both men have expired).  Mamie  Till-Mobley recounts her struggle and seeking justice for Till.  An event that shocked the world when Mobley wanted the world to see what they did to her son.

By allowing these voices to be heard, Keith A. Beauchamp, Director of this documentary does an excellent and powerful educational screening to bring the black experience in deep south to the reality that racism and discrimination is real in this country and exist.  The story of these people are told in the context from not misery but from the deep south experience of the brutal murder of Till.

Mamie Till Mobley expired on January 6, 2003, I know she would be proud that she mentor someone to bring awareness to our people by having the story from "" Untold"" to Told like it is.

Beauchamp's documentary has prompted the federal goverment to re-open the case. I am sure the Department for Justice will make the right decision and bring this case to justice this year.

It's does not matter if it was 50 years old.  Racism and the brutal murder of Emmett Louis Till should not be tolerated in this country.  The documentary could be used in University, workshop and session forum of educational purposes for older adults and children.

A must see documentary.

2475384,5,B000DZ95MQ,"For the August of 1955, Mamie Till-Mobley of Chicago sent her son Emmett Louis Till to the Mississippi Delta to visit friends and family.  Eight days after his arrival, Emmett was abducted from his Great Uncle's home by a group of white men for allegedly whistling at a white woman at a convenience store.  Emmett was brutally beaten and murdered, the violent act epitomizing the virulent racism of the time.  When two of the men involved were put to trial, the all-white jury acquitted them in less than an hour.  Outraging many of the leaders in the black community, the murder and subsequent trial served as the catalyst for the entire American civil rights movement.  The symbol of this act is the mangled face of Till, shown by the mother at his open-casket funeral.  While her decision was controversial, her reason was simple: ""I want the world to see what they did to my son."".

I have had the great pleasure of hearing Mr. Beauchamp speak about his documentary, and I can truly say that he put a great deal of work and effort into it.  The documentary is not told with narration, as instead Mr. Beauchamp uses interviews with eyewitnesses, family members, and historians to tell the story.  The documentary provides a concise view of the murder with the first-hand accounts, and while it does not bombard the viewer with biases or Mr. Beauchamp's personal views, it does evoke a clear message about racism back then as well as today, due to the lessons that can be learned.  Mr. Beauchamp's thoughtful documentary serves as a brilliant reminder of the consequences that feelings of racism and hate can bring.",1137024000,10,1617,4.763440860215054

2475452,5,B000DZ95MQ,"The image of Emmett Till has left its mark on America's conscience, and his story has become a essential part of American history, but this documentary shows a sincere, human side to the friends and family of Emmett Till who were directly impacted by his kidnapping, torture and murder.  These are obviously not people who have been coached or scripted, but people speaking from their very hearts.  Especially touching is the testimony of Mamie Till, Emmett's mother, to whose memory this documentary is dedicated.  Her courage and bravery come through in this documentary as do her humanity and individuality.  One is able to see one's own mother or grandmother in her, and this brings to the foreground the shock, the sorrow, and the human element in this whole tragedy.

One reviewer warned of the graphic image shown in this documentary of Emmett Till's mutilated face.  As an educator, I strongly feel it is important that we present the absolute truth of Emmett Till's kidnapping, torture and murder, no matter how unpleasant it may be.  My fear is not that a parent or administrator will question me on my decision to present this documentary to my class, but that we as teachers will become afraid to present the uncomfortable yet essential truths of our country's history; and isn't this what more than anything makes possible the kind of society where routine atrocities are able to flourish -- a society which, as Harper Lee states in _To Kill a Mockingbird_, ""...[preserves] polite fiction at the expense of human life""?

The tragedy of Emmett Till is a defining moment of the U.S. in the twentieth century, but in order to fully appreciate the significance of this tragedy, we must feel how it impacted the lives of those closest to him.  It is impossible to feel the horror and loss experienced by his mother, closest family and friends, but this documentary at least does justice to a tragedy we may rather forget, but must not.",1331251200,,1943,4.8459214501510575

Like many, I have heard the story of Emmett Till's murder and seen the gruesome pictures, but this documentary adds more dept to the story. I learned some details that I never knew before now.

2475504,5,B000DZ95MQ,"Tremendously powerful, simple, straightforward documentary about the brutal, horrific lynching of a black teen in 1955 Mississippi for whistling at a white woman, and the pathetic lack of justice that followed.  The incident itself helped launch the civil rights movement that carried into Dr. King and the 1960s.

The film is basic: mostly interviews with Tills remaining family and friends, and a few other witnesses to the events , interspersed with some bits of stills and movie footage from the time.  But a story this strong doesnt need a lot of gloss, and if the film feels almost amateur at moments, that pales before its heartrending  infuriating, and terrifying story, conveyed and made real by those who were there.  The film itself was responsible for re-opening a federal investigation of the crime, 50 some odd years after the fact, with the hope of finally bring some justice and closure to the noble and brave Till family, and to all African-Americans, to whom this crime represents the worst of America.  An important moment in recent history that should never be forgotten.",1323734400,2,1091,5.033333333333333

2475508,5,B000DZ95MQ,"Emmett Louis Till's tragic murder and injustice should always be remembered. This DVD documentary provides a perfect account of American history. Emmett Louis Till was 15 years old who was the loving son of Mrs. Till. His father died in World War II under suspicious circumstances. His mother and family migrated north from Mississippi to Chicago, Illinois. When he was 15 years old, he traveled with his family to Money, Mississippi to spend time there before going back to school in the fall.

Chicago and Money were different as night and day. Emmett had no idea of the dangers that lurked in the South. According to reports, he made a pass at white woman which was totally ludicrous at Bryant's Deli when he handed her money. He also supposedly whistled at her as well. According to his mother, he had a speech impediment because he survived polio and he was only out on one date with a girl his age by that time.

According to his mother, Emmett was a beautiful son who was naive in the South. Emmett's crimes which were ridiculous was found out by Bryant's husband and her brother-in-law. He was kidnapped and savagely beaten. He was found in the river in Mississippi. During the time period of 1955, this documentary recounts Emmett's final days and moments with his beloved mother, Mamie Till-Mobley. She would die after this documentary finished. His body was left deformed and badly beaten. The Southern authorities wanted to leave his body in a grave right away but Mamie wouldn't have it. She wanted her son in Chicago and she wanted to see him one last time.

According to her, we got only a hint of the horror that she saw when he returned home in a locked coffin. Nobody in Mississippi wanted anybody else to see what happened to that 14 year old boy. Finally enough was enough and the story of Emmett Till's murder and his open-casket funeral opened the door to the civil rights movement. Who is to say that his savage, heinous murder which was unjustified and nobody held accountable led to the civil rights movement? Emmett Till was just a young man who was wrongly taken away from his family and from us.

I am angry at the lack of injustice which led to a revolution and the Civil Rights movement for African Americans during the terrible time. I think this story should always be told in schools especially in the United States whether middle or high schools. This documentary is very suitable for education and enlightenment.",1304467200,,2447,4.696969696969697
2475509,1,B000DZ95MQ,"I watched this documentary but was very disappointed.  It did not included any of the information in the original Look magazine article of January 1956.  The documentary left out a completely different story of a young mother, small at just over a hundred pounds and five foot one, with two small children, who was grabbed around the waist and forced back onto a store counter by a 160 pound ""man"" (Till's uncle Moses describes him as big as a man in the article) and threatened with sex.

2475510,5,B000DZ95MQ,In yesteryears it was wrong for a black man to even look at a white woman today its more popular than anything.

An all white jury (come on) you know they would be found not guilty. If they didn't give their life to christ while they had a chance no white jury will save them now.

It was a great DVD in telling what should be told every year especially during Black History Month instead of our usual mention of a couple inventors, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa Parks and be done with BHM.

With the uprising of race hate groups such as the arian brotherhood, the ku klux klan, and other seperatists groups which makes the dream of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. become unfilled to envision an america that is not bound by color but by love for one another as the Lord above would have it to be and allow america to be a place of racial equality and respect for one another and something should be done about it to put an end to this serious issue with the United States the race issue, once and for all.

2475552,5,B000DZ95MQ,"I was about 15 years old in the tenth grade when I heard about this story for the first time as Emitts mother re-told the famous story again to Oprah Winfrey on her show. I remember Oprah warning the audience about the upcoming images being very graphic...I didn't care, (as usual) I wanted to see how the boy looked after hearing that horrible story. Oprah said that photo of his face was on the cover of JET magazine etc.... When that photo flashed across that screen I was literlly in shock, could not move. I dreamed nightmares of that image back when I was younger. That was in the 90's I am 33 years old now with 2 children of my own & my god forbid that ever is to occur with any of my kids. That image has haunted me all these years until I would tell & ask anybody about this story.

I got this DVD a couple of years ago. I watch it every Black History month with my now 11 year old daughter. As a child you realize this is a terrible story. But as an adult & parent you feel this mothers pain, you respect her as a woman & mother- having so much courage...as to show the world the UGLY face of EVIL & RACISM during that time. & To know that this 14 year old young man was beaten, toutured, shot & killed, by these evil cold hearted white men because the boy ""whistled"" at a white lady (& not hardly the best looking white woman, at that---trust me, if you seen her, its like ""OH PLEASE""!) you think OMG...this was senseless & rediculous the boy had to lose his life over something like that? White people made their own STUPID RULES back in the South against Black people & they were called ""Jim Crow laws"".

The Killers didn't get to do any jail time during that time thanks to an all WHITE JURY (as usual). But later on many years later sadly after Emitt's mom passes away...Justice does prevail. But I am almost certain that image of Emitt's disfigured, decomposed, face haunted those evil men for many years (thats a form of justice in itself). Especially since they thought that body would never be found.

And beyond that, the willingness to cover the truth by the guilty parties and peer citizens goes beyond the ugliness of the act itself. The family and friends that recall that day in their lives amazed me that they could do so in such a calm and factual manner.  I commend their courage for the sake of telling Emmit's story so that his death would not have been in vain.

2475599,5,B000DZ95MQ,"Although I greatly enjoyed reading Mr. Bernabo's excellent and well-written review above, I wanted to correct him on one fact. Roy Bryant did not die in 1990. He died on September 1, 1994. I know he didn't die in 1990 because I met and briefly spoke to Roy Bryant in May of 1991. I had just read the book A Death in the Delta by Stephen Whitfield (professor from Brandeis University) when I met Mr. Bryant. In his book, Mr. Whitfield wrote that Roy Bryant had an unlisted number because he was afraid somebody would try to avenge Emmett Till's murder and come to his Ruleville house in order to exact revenge. If my memory is correct (and this was almost 18 years ago), Roy Bryant lived in Ruleville, Mississippi. In mid May 1991, I called directory assistance and they gave me Roy Bryant's phone number and address. A week later, I drove from Chicago to Mississippi. After visiting Money and several of the other places that are mentioned in books about Emmett Till, we drove to Mr. Bryant's Ruleville neighborhood and got the name of a nearby street. We then drove past Roy Bryant's house and he was outside in his driveway in black pants and a white shirt (his clothes looked pretty much the same as the ones he was wearing in the 1955 photos).  After driving past his house, I turned my car around and drove back to Mr. Bryant's house. I stopped my car about 15 yards away from Roy Bryant. I pretended that I was lost and I called out to him. I wanted to see him up close to make sure he was the same Roy Bryant who had murdered Emmett Till. He approached our car and I asked him how to get to some street (which I knew was located close to his street).  He looked exactly like he did in the photos from Life Magazine (just older).  He had aged but it was definitely him. He leaned down to talk to me  and his face was less than a foot from my wife's face. I thanked him for the directions and we drove away. Of course there were things I was dying to ask him, but I was fairly certain he wouldn't answer my questions and I also wasn't willing to let my curiosity and search for truth put my wife's life in danger.  From about a distance of 80 yards from Mr. Bryant's house,  I took a photo of him and we drove off. I took the photo only because I wanted to prove to author Stephen Whitfield that what he wrote in his book ""A Death in the Delta"" was inaccurate and that Mr. Bryant could easily be found. Authors have a responsibility to write accurate information and I was disappointed by this obvious error. Mr. Whitfield lost a lot of credibility with me.  I never sent Mr. Whitfield the photo but I did call him when I returned from Mississippi and I told him what I did and what I found out. Stephen Whitfield was an extremely nice man and he wasn't at all defensive about what I had discovered. I greatly enjoyed his book in spite of the one innacuracy regarding Roy Bryant. Mr. Whitfield told me that his wife would never be willing to make the trip to Money, Mississippi and he was amazed that my wife was willing to go there during precious vacation time.  I was disappointed that Stephen Whitfield never travelled to Money, Mississippi before writing his book. I never understood how one could write a book on Emmett Till without going to Money, Mississippi. It's like writing a book on the New York Yankees without having ever been to Yankee Stadium or New York. I've been to Money, Mississippi twice. The first time (May of 1991), it was in the evening and the people at the gas station next to Bryant's grocery store were giving my wife and I really dirty looks. I don't think it was just because she was Asian and I was white. They knew why we were there and they resented us for being there. The second time (May 1996)I was there with my wife and my daughter (who was just a few weeks shy of her third birthday).  The three of us met a local man at the Money, Mississippi post office who said he had been a juror on the Till case when he was young man. He was a very nice man as well, and I just couldn't understand how he could have allowed Roy Bryant and Big Milam to go unpunished. Bryant's grocery store had deteriorated significantly in the five years since I had last been there. I've always tried to find the exact location of the tar paper shack from which a confused Emmett Till was taken in the middle of the night in late August of 1955. The shack was destroyed years ago but I wanted to know where it once stood. I hope someday I can go back and somebody can show me where it once stood.",1232236800,4,4518,4.2748538011695905

2475634,5,B000DZ95MQ,"One day when the kids were home I forced them to watch this story on PBS.  Fast forward a few years.  My youngest daughter needed a history fair project and she chose this story.  Her history teacher did not know this story nor did her classmates.  She won the history fair at her school with a dramatic reacreation in which two of her friends also played some of the characters.  My daughter plays the guitar and played amazing grace for the scene where the mom sees her boy in a coffin and allows the world to see her 14 year old and what racism had done to him.  He was almost unrecognizable.  I can't imagine the strength of that mom to show the true color of racism.  My daughter and her friends went and competed in the regional history fair and THEY WON!  They are now scheduled to perform in the State fair.  It is the first time the middle school has ever won the history fair in over 30 years.  We purchased this so she could share the original inspiration she had when she saw the story.  For those who have not heard of Emmitt Till, he was a 14 year old black boy who whistled at a white woman.  He was taken that night and murdered by the white bubba's that ran the town.  They were tried by an all white jury and were NOT convicted even though they admitted to the crime.  Double jeopardy assured they were never tried again.  In 2002 the Till Bill was enacted that allows a re-trial when all white juries exonerated defendants based on their color.  They can now be re-tried.  It is too late as all the players are long gone but it rights an injustice that started on that day when a 14 year old was ripped from his moms arms for whistling.  My daughter and her team mates now have an interview with Emmitt Tills cousin who is still living and they also get to have a conference with either the president or vice president of the NAACP.  They compete in May and if they win there they go on to Washington to compete at the national level.  This story had a great impact on my children and it really is a good way to get teens to look at racism and relate it back to them being a teen.  As a parent I highly suggest this be one of the stories that your teens see.",1207958400,,2177,4.170263788968825

2475639,5,B000DZ95MQ,"This Documentary was well done, based on the 1955 brutal lynching of 14 year old Emmett Louis Till, an African American teenager just trying to have a good time with his family and friends.  Until he whistled at a white woman, Carolyn, wife of Roy Bryant, Sister-n-Law of J. W. Milam.  These 2 men were accused and aquitted of the heinous crimes that took Emmett Till's young life.  This is true crime and is well worth the money, watching this film has made me cry for the family of Emmett, it was devastating to watch how the Mississippi court system back in 1955 let 2 animals go after admitting they kidnapped and murdered someone.  How gruesome.  Emmett Louis Till deserved what any other person deserved, to live and love, instead his life was cut short.  This is very painful to watch.  Emmett's Mother, Mrs. Mobley, was such an inspiration, her words touched me, she was a wonderful woman.

This is a must-see film, it is always a good idea to see history so we do not forget what ""civilized"" man is capable of.  This unfortunate young man's death sparked the Civil Rights Movement.

2475640,4,B000DZ95MQ,"This is a great documentary about the Till case, as director Keith Beauchamp clearly cares a lot about this subject and it shows. It does feature a few people who were not interviewed in previous Till books or documetnaries (some who appear only in shadows and under assumed names on camera) and one lady witness even reveals one of the biggest mysteries of the Till case-the name of the Black traitor who told Milam and Bryant about the alleged ""wolf whistle."" (This appears in the director's commentary). We also see some post-production footage of the Till case being reopened because of some of these interviews.

However, I would have to give the edge to the ""American Experience"" documentary DVD on this subject, as that one does a better job of getting the viewer to know who Emmett Till was as a person before the murder and as he grew up in Chicago.

Both are good, so I would recommend to those who want to know about the Till case to watch both of these DVDs.",1160179200,5,970,4.537142857142857

As I grew older, this story haunted me so I tried to find more information, but the history books at school were limited and pieces of information gradually surfaced more and more as the year went by.  I am gratefully for this documentary.  It is well put together and the truth is as palpable as the memories it conjures up.  Till's story is an American Story.  Unfortunately, remnants of those very issues still linger in our society and education is still the key to finding solutions.",1155945600,3,829,4.682758620689655
2475642,5,B000DZ95MQ,"It was in August of 1955 that 15-year-old Emmett Till was sent from Chicago by his mother to spend the summer with his great uncle, Moses Wright, in Money, Mississippi.  On August 24, Till and some other black teenagers who had been picking cotton went to Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market to get some candy.  In the store Till allegedly whistled at Carolyn Bryant.  When her husband returned from a trip several days later and heard about the incident, Bryant and his half-brother J. W. Milam decided to ""teach the boy a lesson.""  On August 28, they kidnapped Till from his uncle's house, too him to a plantation shed, brutalized the boy, shot him, and dumped his body in the Tallahatchie river, having tied a seventy pound fan from a cotton gin around Till's neck with barbed wire.  The two men were tried and found not guilty by an all-white jury.  In January 1956 their confession was paid for and published by ""Look"" magazine.  Both men would die from cancer, Milam in 1980 and Bryant in 1990.

I do not remember when I first heard of Emmett Till, but the story of the black teenager who was killed by white men in Mississippi for the crime of whistling at a white woman was a pivotal event in energizing the Civil Rights Movement and I have known about it for a long time.  However, I never saw a photograph of Emmett Till's body until I was at the Seattle Art Museum looking at an exhibit having to deal with depictions of race and gender in art, and there was a small photograph of Till's body on display at his funeral.  The photograph was too small to tell any details, but you were struck by the swollen and misshaped head.  It did not look human, but then to Milam and Bryant, Emmett Till was never a human being.

The title of Keith A. Beauchamp's documentary is ""The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till,"" not because the story has not been told, but because the people he interviewed, including Till's mother, Mamie Carthan Mobley, along with several cousins and friends from that summer in Mississippi, never had a chance to tell their story in court.  Beauchamp provides them with that opportunity, using newsreel footage from 1955 as well.  It follows the chronology of events, from Till's birth to the present and Beauchamp's own investigations into the case (his chief claim is that up to 14 other people were involved in the crime in various ways).  For just telling the story and covering the facts, Beauchamp keeps things pretty basic in his documentary, letting people speak for themselves.

The most unforgettable part of the documentary is when Mobley tells the story of getting her son's body back home.  Officials in Mississippi wanted to bury the body before anybody got a good look at it and when Mobley managed to get it back to Chicago the coffin was nailed shut.  But she got it opened and then describes what it was she saw in simple and graphic details, emphasizing not the horrors but the child she remembered (e.g., she smiles as she talks about how she thought Emmett's teeth were the most beautiful things she had ever seen and then remembering seeing only two of them and wondering where the rest of them were).  It is only after Beauchamp lets her tell of the pivotal point where she decides to leave the casket open at the funeral so the world can see what was done to her son in Mississippi that we go from a school photograph of a smiling Emmett Till to the wrecked ruin of his face and head.  This is the most disturbing image from the Civil Rights movement, but that is exactly why it is the most important one and why its publication in ""Jet"" was an important catalyst.  You really cannot tell the story unless you look at the photograph, and teachers who want to show this documentary to their students should be prepared to defend their decision.

In addition to Mobley, it is Moses Wright, who stood up in court and pointed to the two white men who came and took away Till (there is a photograph of the dramatic moment), who stands out here.  But it strikes me that somebody who is not mentioned by name, William Bradford Huie, played a key role as well.  A journalist and author (""The Americanization of Emily,"" ""The Klansman""), Huie was often criticized by mainstream journalists for using his checkbook to get stories.  But it was Huie who paid the murderers to confess in a national publication five months later.  A follow up story revealed that the businesses of Milam and Bryant had gone under because they were ostracized by local whites.  I am sure this did not happen because of the murders, which clearly the jury representing the town supported, but because of the published confession that took away the thin veneer provided by the not guilty verdict.

This documentary received a lot of publicity because it fueled an effort to reopen the case.  The U.S. Department of Justice did reopen the case to determine whether others in addition to Milam and Bryant were involved.  The F.B.I. and Mississippi officials worked on a joint investigation, and while Till's body was exhumed so an official autopsy could be performed, the federal investigation was closed in March of this year.  Consequently, justice in this case will not result in anybody ending up in jail, but rather with preserving the testimony of these witnesses for posterity (Till's mother died after the documentary was completed).  Carolyn Bryant (now Donham after her fourth husband) is still alive and living in Greenville Mississippi.  Signs in her front yard warn that uninvited visitors will be prosecuted, an apparent indication that she believes the law in Mississippi continues to protect her a lot more than it ever did Emmett Till.",1151884800,88,5664,4.683148335015137

It so emotionally touched me that I also purchased Mamie's book and several others to unearth the details that never came to light back in the time frame it occurred.  Emmitt's mother is a role model of how we can be so terribly abused and emotionally wounded yet live to not have it defeat us into a closet of bitterness and hatred.  The book inspired me so much that I made a key reference to it and quoted an entire paragraph in a work-related award acceptance speech to drive home how significantly mine and others' lives have been blessed to know the true story and how a grieving mother handled herself and did not allow the despair to ruin her life.  A movie needs to be made about this indespicable chapter in American history to put a real face on what hatred and discrimination of any kind can lead to such acts.  My speech can be viewed on YouTube.  It was the highlight of my professional career to give center stage to this tragedy to let others become aware of the triumph of the human spirit despite what could have easily caused a grieving mother to ne deeply depressed and angry over the loss of her only son.,1473292800,,1231,4.3304347826086955
