1099342,5,6305963126,"Everybody who knows TITUS, seems wary of it. This is decidedly the play Shakespeare wrote to pay the rent. Not the bard's finest, not the bard's deepest but as far as Julie Taymore's rendition, it is definitely one of  his wackiest.  And for a difficult play, it was adapted excellently. I'd be  even bold enough to suggest this play is better suited for the screen than  the stage.  The events are ten times larger than life and completely  overblown.  If you're looking for subtelty, see Hamlet.  But wait, you say!  I hate Roman brutality! I will end up watching this movie through covered  eyes! Even if Roman brutality is not your thing, the actual gore/graphic  content turned out to be much less than I anticipated and the wonderful  dark humor therein makes up for any major scenes of nastiness. The acting  was superb on all counts but particularly the role of Aaron the Moor in my  opinion.  It is a visual amusement park and even the non-Shakespeare fans  loved it. It was anything but expected.
As the movie ended, someone in  the rear commented ""That movie had no point!""
Prehaps not. And  it isn't trying to make one.  No morals, no deeply impressed tragedy, no  understanding even necessary. This movie is a great time and that, to me,  is the point.",959126400,,1265,4.633484162895928

The talk of the extreme violence in this movie is just gibberish. There is more violence in the  first 5 minutes of Saving Private Ryan than in watching this movie 4 times.  The characters and plot stick in your head and this movie is one to think  about.,957484800,,377,4.28169014084507
1099345,5,6305963126,"Tonight, I saw Titus a second time. Although I rated it 5 stars after my first viewing, I'd rate it 10 stars after seeing it a second time. I remarked after seeing it the first time that its acting was ""very  competent."" This second time, not paying so much attention to plot, I  could see that the acting of ALL the actors and actresses was superb,  worthy of all sorts of Oscars--perhaps even a sweep, maybe for music, too.  This movie is heads and shoulders above almost all other movies.
During  the first viewing, my impressions were of on-the-fly reactions to plot,  anticipation and surprise. With attention to plot out of the way, what I  continuously noticed the second time was the extraordinary quality of  everything in the movie.
Concerns about violence in the movie are  overblown and overstated. The violence was mild compared to most action  movies. Instead of violence, emphasis was instead on murderous intent, upon  the shocking passions of the men and women for revenge, and not upon the  blood, itself.
I believed I understood the movie after my first viewing,  which was that it was a morality play taught to a 21st century young boy  dragged back into time to witness up close real violence contained in a  Shakespearean play. Now, after a second viewing, I'm not so sure I  understand the ending (that the boy, really the only ""adult"" in  the movie, learned his lesson and walked away from violence to a new dawn  of caring). I'll probably have to see it a third time and listen more  closely to the ending dialog.
This is a highest-quality movie. You won't  be bored, ever. It deserves multiple viewings. It's visually rich--and  that's an understatement--in the best Felini style. The acting performances  will always entrance the audience. I had much higher opinions of all the  other actors besides the two or three most important ones, this second time  around.
This is more than a good movie. It's a masterpiece on a par with  only a handful of legendary movies. If you want a high-quality video (when  it finally comes out), this is one that will entertain everyone on many  different levels. But if you can, see it in the theater!
I'd now agree  that the director of this movie is a genius, just like the hype says. This  is a director to watch for in the future, like Felini.
Again, don't worry  about the violence. Violence is low key compared with modern action movies.  What makes the violence much more riveting are the passionate performances  of the actors and their focus on unrepentant revenge and viewing some  purely evil-minded people. I personally would highly recommend this movie  for young-teen audiences, too, as a morality play with a message. This is  high-school-class material that teachers should think about showing to kids  and talking about it later.
Don't miss the first minute of the movie, or  you won't have a chance of understanding this movie adaption!",954806400,17,2915,4.792756539235413
1099346,5,6305963126,"I'm still in awe after leaving the theater. ""Titus,"" based on one of William Shakespeare's lesser-known tragedies, has become an amazing and (dare I say?) brilliant film directed by one of the most daring and  creative directors known to us. That director is Julie Taymor, who remained  in virtual anonymity until her production of a puppet show called  ""Juan Darien: A Carnival Mass"" garnered a Tony nomination for  Best Musical. Disney almost immediately snapped her up and put her to work  transforming the animated film ""The Lion King"" into a stage  musical. Taymor created a work so intense, so vibrant, and so breathtaking  that she received a Tony Award for Best Director, and ""The Lion  King"" was named Best Musical of 1998. Now, Ms. Taymor has proven yet  again that she is a directorial force to be reckoned with: her film  directorial debut is simply astonishing, a dark and haunting film that is  easily one of the best films of the year. And this in the last week of  January.
The plot of ""Titus"" reads like a bloody, Shakespearean  soap opera. Titus Andronicus (Anthony Hopkins) returns victorious from war,  having defeated the Goths and their Queen, Tamara (Jessica Lange). He  arrives into a period of unrest: Caesar has just died, and Titus is offered  the throne. Rather than accept power, Titus defers to Caesar's son  Saturnius (Alan Cumming). Saturnius takes the crown and almost immediately  declares that he will take Titus' daughter, Livinia (Laura Fraser), in  marriage. Little does Saturnius know that she has already fallen in love  with his brother, Bassianus (James Frain). The plot starts to get confusing  here, so pay attention and I'll try to make it as simple as possible:  Titus' sons guard Livinia and Bassianus, secreting them away so that they  can be married. Titus, convinced that he has now been dishonored, slays one  of his sons. Saturnius marries Tamara, and Tamara sets to work plotting the  undoing of Titus. That undoing includes murdering Bassianus, raping  Livinia, and framing two of Titus' sons for the crime. Titus, however is  not stupid, and realizes that Tamara and her two sons are behind his many,  many, many troubles. The play ends in a typical Elizabethan bloodbath, with  everyone dying at the dinner table. (I hesitate to reveal the main course  of this fatal meal; undoubtedly you could discover it for yourself in just  about any other review about this movie, but part of the ""fun,""  ho-ho, of the movie is this surprising plot twist.)
The performances are  sensational. Hopkins brings a sort of lewd dignity to Titus Andronicus,  espousing the sort of tragic hero that Shakespeare so loved writing about.  We know that MacBeth and Titus would get along great - and probably end up  trading war stories. Jessica Lange's Tamara is sexy, devious, and utterly  irresistible - one of the best villainesses since Lady MacBeth. Actually,  ""Titus Andronicus"" was written before ""MacBeth,"" but at  least now I know where Willie got his practice for those characters in.  However, the best performance in the movie is Alan Cumming's as Saturnius.  Cumming goes right over the top and stays there, teetering on the brink of  madness. All three main performances are Oscar-worthy, but Cumming may find  this to be a star-making role. After conquering Broadway as the Emcee in  ""Cabaret,"" he'll now be conquering Hollywood with this  movie.
One of the best aspects of ""Titus"" is the wildly  inventive production and costume design. Neither a portrait of ancient Rome  nor a true updating of the story, ""Titus"" instead chooses to  evoke a feel of the oldest literary phrase in the world: ""Once upon a  time."" ""Titus"" exists in a fantasy world somewhere in  between: a place where men in togas watch men in motorcycles go down the  street, where the villains gather together to play video games and smoke  cigarettes and where the heroes shoot arrows inscribed with prayers towards  the heavens, begging for divine intercession. As decidedly anachronistic as  the setting is, it works. The opening shot, of a small modern boy staging a  war with toy soldiers sets the stage for a film that is blindingly  original, even while retelling a story hundreds of years old.
There are  few adaptations of Shakespeare's plays that have been translated well into  film. Most play like a filmed version of a play, and while not an  inappropriate medium for Shakespeare, it is rare to find a director and  cast willing to take that leap and transcend the written word in order to  provide a true film experience. Kenneth Branagh's ""Hamlet"" and  Baz Luhrmann's ""Romeo and Juliet"" both had the required genius  and innovation required to make Shakespeare come alive on the big screen,  and Julie Taymor has the same magic touch. ""Titus"" may not be one  of Shakespeare's more popular works (in fact, most Shakespearean scholars  view it as one of his worst) but after seeing this film, one wonders why.  True, it's almost pure melodrama, but potboilers existed long before  ""Independence Day"" and ""Cats."" In any event, this  ""Titus"" is a brilliant (there's that damn word again) film  directed by one of today's most inspired directors.",954201600,8,5173,4.948717948717949
1099347,5,6305963126,"Sometimes art must be endured rather than enjoyed.  Titus is a harsh story, with little sympathies to be given to either hero or villain. This is the first movie I have seen for along time that made me flinch at the  sheer brutality of its characters.  Every conceivable crime manages to make  it's way into this film. Rape, mutilation, murder, cannibalism, war, lies,  and betrayal are all dished up in liberal portions.
And yet, Julie Taymor  has taken this play and made something amazing. The characters exist in a  blended world of Rome under Caesar and Mussolini.  It is a visual  masterpiece.  Titus Andronicus (Anthony Hopkins) is a military man, who  trusts in the divine right of the emperor.  When that trust is betrayed in  the harshest way possible, Titus begins a slow descent into madness and  revenge.  Tamora (Jessica Lange) is the conquered Queen of the Goths who  finds a new seat of power as the wife of corrupt Emperor Saturninus. And  most impressive is Aaron the Moor, who has no loyalties other than his own  love of evil.  A villain who can be said to be the only winner in this sad  tale.",952905600,117,1114,4.615384615384615
1099348,5,6305963126,"If you liked Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs, you'll love him in this. This was a truly disturbing and draining film. The special effects and costumes were breathtaking.

1099458,5,6305963126,"Even though the film's conflation of the old world with the newer seems awkward at times, the acting performances in this film of both Hopkin's and Lange are nothing but short of amazing as is this incredible drama.",1484956800,,215,4.684210526315789
1099459,5,6305963126,"Ok.  This is the harshest play Bill S. ever wrote, and a production that pretty much highlights that brutality.

1099460,5,6305963126,"Titus Andronicus seemed silly when I read it, but it's rather violent and intense as done by Taymor, who almost brings a ""Moulin Rougue"" arty-Bess to it.  Jessica Lange is great!",1482019200,,178,4.741935483870968

1099462,4,6305963126,"This is one of the most difficult plays by Shakespeare. First it takes place in many very different locales from the Imperial court of Rome to some forest scenes out of Rome and other wild areas, not to speak of private homes, particularly that of Titus Andronicus himself. The BBC chose a constructed setting that could easily be transformed but it basically always had the same semi-circle structure which was in fact a full circle giving the possibility of entering or exiting it at different points diametrically opposed.

The second difficulty is that several scenes require massive armies and massive crowds. This is of course not possible in a constructed setting. It only becomes possible in a real or realistic outdoor setting, like streets, squares, roads, open countryside, etc. So it is not a surprise that these massive crowds or armies are not shown on the stage, in fact on the screen. In other words the BBC chose to keep a rather limited space; a little bit the way it is in a theater, which is in a way surprising for television, but it is a remark that can be done for most of these productions.

The third great difficulty is the tremendous number of people who are killed in a way or another on the stage itself, or maimed and killed just in the wings, parts of whose bodies are brought onto the stage for some kind of provocation against one character or other. We can think the black baby is probably a prop.

But what is important is not at all such details but the very Shakespearian meaning of the play. A crime is committed at the beginning, a legal crime but a crime nevertheless, because Titus Andronicus showed no pity, compassion or empathy and he was cruel. Titus Andronicus yields to a demand from his officers to have one of the sons of the Goth Queen given to them to be sacrificed in order to atone the pain and suffering of the survivors of the war campaign as for the dead who are brought realistically on the stage in the shape of four of Titus Andronicus sons on stretchers. The four bodies are not very good taste, but they are martial looking, though they would have been in a state of advanced decay and not the very presentable state in which they were shown here. In spite of the Goth Queens pleading, Titus Andronicus dispatches her eldest son to be sacrificed. We are luckily not given any detail, though knowing the refinement of a death sentence known as hanged, drawn and quartered in Elizabethan times we could easily do what the audience probably did: imagine the details. And it is when the news that this has been performed that we proceed to bury the fours sons. Thats martial but ruthless, crude and gory beginning.

Titus had been cruel then and he did not demonstrate any mercy and forgiveness after the war. It might be legal, it is a human crime nevertheless. The Shakespearian treatment of the situation is typical. All protagonists will be dispatched to death except two: Titus Andronicus brother who represents the Senate and has the power to appoint the emperor, and as such who had proposed the throne to his brother Titus Andronicus when he returned from the war. Titus refused and favored the elder son of the dead emperor. This was not a human crime but it was vanity on his side to refuse what he should have accepted to provably resign later, and a political mistake not to see that he should never have appointed any one of the two sons of the dead emperor because they hated each other and what was to happened did gappen, the brother who was the new emperor started with the killing of his brother. The second survivor is Lucius, the eldest son of Titus Andronicus who had been banned, or had escaped on his fathers order, to get into an alliance with the Goths, returning to Rome at the head of Goth armies (that sounds a lot like Fortinbras in Hamlet). A third one is spared: the grandson of Titus Andronicus, the Young Lucius, son of Lucius, Titus Andronicus eldest son, probably because he did not come back from the war due to his young age

And that was the beginning of the descent. This new emperor married the Goth Queen out of spite for Titus Andronicus who had appointed him, and he liberated the prisoners, her two sons and her Moor adviser Aaron (black on the stage, why not, though Moor was more on the Jewish side at the time, especially with his name, but that is a detail.)

All protagonists will be exterminated. Titus Andronicus brother Marcus Andronicus will be the one who orders the transition once again as the tribune of the Senate and he will call Lucius to the throne. The end is then close. They have to throw Tamoras body to wild beasts and to bury Aaron, her adviser, alive but chest-deep only for him to die of starvation and thirst. The production has Young Lucius holding the open box containing the black baby at the end and the box is gently closed by his father who brings him to his grandfathers body to kiss him. This production makes the child not kiss his grandfather in spite of considerate nice words.

Altogether this production is very tamed and even mild. All violent acts that take place in front of the audience are either very symbolical or realistically performed though outside the screen, like the cutting off of Titus Andronicus hand; just the hand is off the screen though it takes Aaron two or three blows to manage the cutting, and those we see. When we know that 15 years earlier John Stubbs had his right hand chopped off with a butchers cleaver and a mallet for the authorship of a book that displeased  not without any reason, true enough  Elizabeth I, we may find this particular act of violence still active in the memory of quite a few people. I say this because we do not seem to understand that England at that time was just getting out of some religious turmoil that meant many executions and killings and violent acts with the reformation first and the attempt of Mary I, aka Bloody Mary, to re-establish Catholicism. It was a violent time. Luckily women married early, often under 13, and had many children so that a couple could reach procreative time and perpetuate, even develop the species, at least the English branch of it. That was not a unique case in Europe, and probably the whole world.

The level of the director's invention is startling, and the cast is extraordinary:  Sir Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, as well as Alan Cumming, Colm Feore, James Frain, Laura Fraser, Harry Lennix, Angus Macfadyen, Matthew Rhys, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers.

Sir Anthony gives the greatest performance of his film career, at the time calling it his ""swan song"" to Shakespeare; he is electrifying.  And has Miss Lange done anything better?  All are superb.

It is never a easy task to adapt Shakespeare to T.V. or the Big Screen, because of time constraints generally half of his words must be edited & this must be compensated with great cinematography, actors & musical scores!  While I don't like the alternate universe this film is set in , it is visually striking & the musical score accentuates the mood very well.  The acting is top notch by all involved!  Julie Taymor did a great job directing this but even with the changing of Prospero to a woman I liked where she took ""The Tempest"" better than ""Titus"".  This is because of my personal quirk of wanting the works of Shakespeare to be as close to the time frame as possible & if not in the same time period at least the same universe.  I think she would have scored a much better adaptation using the wild music & beautiful color palate but leaving the story in ancient Greece.  I do find it interesting that she directed one of Shakespeare's first & last story's.  This is the only movie adaptation I could find of Titus & it is a very dynamic adaptation & for the price I got it for a happy addition to my William Shakespeare movie adaptations.  I am a huge William Shakespeare fan & have been since I was 12.  When I was 12 I loved his rhythm & word play at 50 I am falling in love all over again appreciating how masterfully he is able to capture the full range of human emotions!

Anthony Hopkins is so good that in the dvd extras, you can see the other cast members terrified of him in just the read-through, because he already has the entire script memorized and is in character from day one.  The plot is not the strongest of Shakespeare's plays, but remember that he was competing for an audience in a London in which bear-baiting was entertainment and public executions were occasions for family outings, so he went over-the-top knowingly.  The play is of its time, and Taymor does an incredible job of turning our expectations on their ear with her production design (the wardrobes, the lighting, the sets, etc.).

Many of the speeches lack all emotion, and the whole burlesque element that is brought out so well in most productions is completely ignored here, though it could be argued that this is a valid interpretative choice.

In fairness, and in spite of the foregoing, it should be added that some of the key scenes were quite well done; the ending is particularly well handled, and it shows why such revenge plays, and this one in particular, were so popular in Shakespeares day.

Oscar winners Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange are at the top of their game. Hopkins portrays Roman general Titus Andronicus, who captures Tamora, Queen of the Goths (Jessica Lange). Under Taymor's gifted direction, the photography is spectacular--there are chariots in one scene, and motorcycles in the next! Visually, it's flawless--the action is non-stop. It's been said that this film is one of the most FAITHFUL adaptions of Shakespeare's works ever captured on film. I think it's a masterpiece. The DVD is a 2-disc set. It has many special features including several trailers, a 49-minute documentary ""The Making of Titus,"" that has great interviews with Hopkins and Lange; and shows both of these great actors rehearsing scenes with Julie Taymor. I was so happy to find a copy of this special 2-DVD set at an extremely reasonable price.",1429660800,5,1254,5.117073170731707

Sir Anthony Hopkins as the title character who is hell-bent on revenge and destruction of his enemies to the point his own destruction of his family, is absolutely perfect.  Harry Lennix steals the show though as the only character of color in any of Shakespeare's works - Aaron the Moor - his diabolical shenanigans and betrayal of all sides is played to perfection by Lennix.

Alan Cumming as Saturninus, and Jessica Lange as the scheming Queen of the Goths, round out this stellar cast.

Titus is a play that tells a wicked story about wicked people and the wicked people's victims.  The written play itself does not shy away from gore or detail nor does this marvelous film adaptation.  Stylized with modern and ancient objects and symbolism, the film takes on almost a surreal view to depict the downfall of a Roman general's family and the uprising of a most terrible group of barbarians.  The film stays true to the original play by never leaving out a horrific scene.  Rape, cannibalism, murder and insanity are brought to us in full color without hesitation.  Titus, while strange at times, is very deep and very moving.  This film is for those who love a Shakespearean tragedy but with a horror twist.  Those who have not read the play or are not familiar with  Shakespeare's writings may not fully appreciate the film because without reading the play the film will seem strange and nothing more than artistic surrealism blended into film.  For those who haven't read the play, i strongly recommend doing so if you are fond of gore movies (stories) or thrillers.  It isn't a long story and it can be found for free online through a quick google search.  Even those who don't care for Shakespeare's other writings have a tendency to enjoy Titus Andronicus.",1345852800,,1623,4.52054794520548

1099989,5,6305963126,"TITUS is an horrific William Shakespeare play that transcends the description ""tragedy.""

In two and a half hours, we see in this stylish Julie Taymor film: a father kill his son, two boys murder their stepdad after they rape a girl and leave her alive but horrendously mutilated, also the beheading of two of the main character's sons and him consenting to the lopping off of his left hand.

There's striking scenes of hallucinogenic quality, also a peek into an empiric bath hall of enormous proportions with a human level of decadence that exceeds its dimensions. Several more murders occur, none more shocking than the last four and before the curtain comes down, the unwitting are turned into cannibals. You have NEVER, EVER seen anything like this linguistically literal adaptation of ""Titus Andronicus"" that's set in a nightmarish WWII-era Roman state.

Highest possible recommendation.

But they do not help Julie Taymor's Titus at all, which, with its extreme vulgarity, muffles any serious reflection and spoils the otherwise sublimity of Shakespeare's writing.

I had the occasion to see part of this movie on HBO and was absolutely blown away by all of the performances.  I don't think that there could have been a better cast assembled for this particular play.

However, this involves the true spirit of a warrior who is undone by his honor to his country and his family.  Ultimately succumb to the pains and sacrifices that he makes for his country and to the detriment of his family, he executes the most vicious revenge on his enemies, who think that he has lost his mind.

1100075,3,6305963126,"I was really looking forward to `Titus', but as the film progressed it became apparent that Julie Taymor's stage oriented mind couldn't balance out the big screen quite as nicely.  The film because too cluttered and chaotic for its own good, relying too heavily on a visual structure to carry the film, which actually did it detriment.  The story loses some of the intimacy needed to convey emotional points because the director was having her actors race around the screen, filling it instead of dwelling within it.  The approach to a stage production and that of a big screen production is very different, and Taymor didn't quite get that.  Still, she did squeeze out some tremendous performances, especially from Jessica Lange (who just devours this role with ferocity unmatched) and the cinematic efforts here are truly memorable.  I wouldn't say necessarily that one should avoid this film, but one should know what to expect.  The film lacks any restraint; instead becoming extremely brash and overwhelming at times.  Yet, it is beautifully constructed in moments and certainly contains some memorable visual delights.  I just wish that it could have all come together a little more soundly so as to truly deliver an epic masterpiece.  In the end it feels a little `style over substance' instead of `stylized substance'.",1301616000,2,1326,5.073732718894009

The motivations are all very simplisitic. Its all about the violence.

The film has interesting backgrounds and costumes, but they generally have nothing to do with the story. They are fun in an arts for arts sake sense. But nothing can really rehabilitate or elevate the core story. The production design is ten times better than the story itself.

The cast is also far better than the story. Everyone does a fine job with what they are given. Laura Fraser puts in an amazing performance in a role that could go wrong in so many different ways. Hopkins is Hopkins of course.

And so in the end, you have an A-list team producing a c-list story. If you can get past that, there are interesting fragments of things in the film that can be enjoyed.",1288656000,4,1055,4.691891891891892

1100080,5,6305963126,"I actually saw this movie 4 times when it was in theaters in 1999. Some have made comments that all the good Shakespeare roles were taken and that Anthony Hopkins got stuck with Titus. I have to question if they actually understood the movie.

Julie Taymor, perhaps one of the least appreciated directors of our time, picked Shakespeare's ""Titus Andronicus"" was one of The Bard's first works to be published around 1594 and may be his earliest tragedy. The story revolves around the fall of a Roman general (Titus) and the series of events set in motion by his enemy Tamora, The Queen of the Goths (played to perfection by Jessica Lang) and her sons Chiron and Demetrius (Johnathan Rhys-Myers and Matthew Rhys respectively.) Aided by Aaron the Moor (Harry Lennix), one of Tamora's lovers and the newly crowned Emperor of Rome, Saturninus (Alan Cumming), Tamora extracts her revenge on Titus in a brutal and vile manner.

There are decapitations, drug use, rape, cannibalism and nudity throughout the movie so it isn't for everyone. The play itself was labeled as Shakespeare's gruesome work. It is a difficult film to watch at times because of the pure hate the brews within some of the characters and the depravity of their souls. A stellar cast that includes Colm Feore (""Chicago,"" ""24"" and 2011's ""Thor"") and Angus Macfadyen (""Alias,"" ""Saw 3,4 and 5"" and ""Californiacation,"") ""Titus"" is a definite must see for movies that march to a different beat.

Director Julie Taymor (perhaps one of the least appreciated directors of our time) first came to fame with her elaborate and creative staging the ""The Lion King"" on Broadway which made history when Taymor won the Tony for Best Director of a Musical, something a woman had not accomplished prior. She is currently working with U2's Bono and The Edge on the stage musical ""Spider-Man:Turn off the Dark."" She has also directed the films ""Frida"" with Salma Hayek and ""Across the Universe,"" a musical set to songs written by The Beatles. The next film up for Taymor is another of Shakespeare's works, ""The Tempest"" which stars Alfred Molina, Alan Cumming, Russell Brand and Helen Mirren.

""Titus"" is good, very good. But like I said before, it's not for everyone. Just be patient with the film. Like Baz Luhrmann's 1996 film ""Romeo + Juilet,"" ""Titus"" is Shakespeare like you've never seen before.",1258416000,5,2345,4.899244332493703

1100141,5,6305963126,I saw this film in theater and I said to myself..THIS IS REALLY STRANGE.....Hopkins plays this for all its worth as Titus. I think of this as Hannibal for the Shakespeare crowd with a touch of head trip of Masterpiece Theater Truely a very strange surreal travel to a very strange part of Rome where the one has to see to really believe,1244937600,,336,4.349206349206349
1100142,5,6305963126,"The critics have historically rated Titus Andronicus as a weak early work of the great Shakespeare. Yet Julie Taymor's film interpretation is startling in its presentation, challenging the viewer with visually shocking scenes and superb acting so as to allow the viewer to reconsider this work. Even though I found the play to be blood thirsty and cruel with rash behaviors contrasted against devious and evil plots, the quality of the acting propels the film forward and the unique set designs and costumes continually keep the eye amused even when the plot becomes preposterous.

The storyline is centered around the mindless violence that humans inflict upon other humans, the desire for revenge which can take on a drive like thirst or hunger, the nature of sarcastic cruelty that objectifies another human being and thus makes it permissible to torture them. It is about power, the consequences for rejecting power, and the consequences of confronting power.

Titus is a man who makes many mistakes. He is superbly played by Anthony Hopkins.  He makes a series of mistakes that set the world against him. He selects to make a human sacrifice of the eldest son of the Goth Queen Tamora, setting her on a path of vengeance that does not end. He kills one of his own sons for disobeying him when the sons were making decisions based on genuine regard for the wellbeing of their sister whereas Titus had begun to make decisions in the rare air of honorable loyalty to an Emperor who did not deserve the crown. He is offered the throne by the Senate and yet he gives it to the decadent eldest son of the emperor rather than to his upright younger brother and beloved of Titus' daughter Lavinia.  He makes a series of terrible judgments and brings terrible ruin upon his family and himself.  The emotions of Titus are not predictable or stereotypical. For he laughs at the death of his sons as he contemplates their severed heads. He is cold matter-of-fact when he encounters the vile tortures inflicted on his beloved daughter. He rashly trades one of his hands in a bad deal that he foolishly and emotionally falls into. But the redeeming aspect of the story is that finally Titus gets smart. He finally becomes cunning and acts like he has gone insane. He finally learns to control and hide his emotions and his revenge becomes as sweet and terrible upon Tamora as her cruelty had been to him. In his final scenes, Hopkins gleefully dances in his revenge as he watches Tamora eat a meat pie made from her two younger sons. And then we see the coldest of calculations as he breaks the neck of his poor tortured daughter whom he knows he can not longer protect.

Jessica Lange is wonderful as Tamora, the Goth Queen, who rises from a poor and dirty political prisoner of Titus, to the wife of the Emperor and thus in a position to carefully plot and execute revenge on Titus and his family for the death of her elder son. Tamora is a wonderful character with an outstanding wide range of emotions displayed. She is the cunning advisor to the foolish young Emperor and seductress to the handsome black slave, Aaron the Moor. I found some of her strongest scenes to be when she begs for the life of her eldest son and when she must deny Lavinia assistance as Tamora's two younger sons rape Lavinia, cut out her tongue, and cut off her hands.

Tamora's handsome black lover, Aaron the Moor, is a fascinating character for he is a slave taken from his people, and having a brilliant and wicked mind, he plots great evil deeds and pits the two warring families together like a master chess player. He finds most of the people in either family to be highly suggestible fools. Harry Lennix is a fantastic actor in a chilling role. I understand that this may be the first black character in English drama. How wonderful that he is a character of shrewd cunning cruelty. The scene where he tricks Titus into cutting off his hand, the scene where he kills the nurse who brings him his illegitimate newborn son, and the scene where he negotiates for his son's life by confessing all his deeds are all three totally superb chilling acting.

All the cast were powerful. Laura Fraser is fragile and beautiful as Lavinia. Michael Gross was outstanding as Marcus, the brother of Titus. Angus McFadyen is masterful and believable as Lucius, the elder son of Titus. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Matthew Rhys play the parts of the queen's two younger sons, totally wild and decadent and cruel. Alan Cumming's was good as he Emperor Saturnalis, but he screams many of his lines.

I have an affinity for Hopkins (who doesn't?), but even he can't save this jumbled flim-flam from the very beginning. The ticker-tape parades, the ""Dr. No-esque"" costumes of the wannabe emperors, the Goth ""teens"" obsession with a simpering, unimpressive, slightly *unattractive* (could they put more color into her face please!) Lavinia, were completely unbelievable.

One thing I disagree with several of my fellow Amazonians is the violence in the film. I didn't notice an overabundance of torture, mayhem, and destruction (the end result of Lavinia is the pathetic aspect of that scene with her Uncle Andronicus-but the film doesn't show the Goth sons actually mutilating her). It's violent, but not gratuitous violence (the ending of the film is perhaps the most visually nauseating; be prepared).

1100211,5,6305963126,"When people think of Shakespeare, they usually think of Remeo and Juliet or Midsummer night's Dream.  Happy comical theatre that they read in Highschool or latter classes for the young lovers.  But he explored the darker side of human nature as well, and just as effectively. King Lear and McBeth (the Scottish Play, for all you superstitious thespians) showcased it but perhaps the strongest and most deep observance was Titus.  This play had everything, murder, betrayal, maiming, rape, intrigue and famillial strife all in a well written package.  The film is true to the written text, it maintains the meters and the dialogue very well and the acting, especially by Hpkins (of Course!) is top notch.  The Over the top revamping of the previous years Romeo and Juliet are somwhat oresent as some artisitc liscence was given to set and props (like having cars in Rome with gun toting guards) but the embelishments are not so hard to distract from the plot or deviate from what i think was the authentic aim of the piece.  It is not for the squeemish at all mind you, as it graphically depicts violence and depravity as only humans are capable.  it has been said that ""what the tiger does by tooth and nail, man does for pleasure"", and Titus is proof.  It is an emotionally engaging work and it almost forces the viewer to associate with every character, including the ""bad ones"" as, through the gift of seeing through the 4th wall, we know the stories of all involved.

1100213,2,6305963126,"I cannot give this film a one star rating as I have seen far worse films. But those ""worse"" films were usually excessivly offensive, exploitve, very dull and in many cases very low budget.

Titus is not a low budget film and I don't think it is an exploitation film, although it might be offensive in its own way - and it is dull - but for my money - the dollars to dumb gap and the talent to inpetitue gap seldom gets to the mega-level that is in this production of Titus Andronicus.

Some Shakespearian historians give Titus Andronicus the dubiously honor of being one Shakespeare's least good plays so it boggles the mind that it would ever be the choice for an ultra expensive film.  I stayed for three quarters of the film before my eyes went crossed and I packaged up the DVD and sent it back to Netflix. Poor Netflix. My wife didn't make it through half the film - her eyes are fine. Mine? I'm not so sure.

I found it virtually impossible to care about Shakespeare's original pot boiler due to a multitude of astonishing production choices and distractions in the film.  For example: an incomprehensible time in history and location, ludicrous props (such as the emperors ludicrous sheet metal throne), absurd costumes, affected posing and notice-me readings by the actors, needless slow motion gore scenes and questionable camera choices by the director. These are the techniques that one might find in a parody but Titus Andronicus is, even on its best day, a dreary downer of a play and this film version is no parody. It's pretty obvious that everyone involved with Titus took it very seriously and had not an ounce of sense of humor.

Oddly, Titus appears expensive (at least when one notes the cast,scenery and props) yet the film still maintains a cheesy quality.

What we have here is unadulterated pretension laid on layer after layer with a trowel.  The effect is you feel you are watching a hodgepodge of outlandish ideas with no center and no cohesion.  There is such a lack of restraint that after a while you become deadened to anything that is happening on the screen.

The ideas in the film may have seemed interesting on paper. I'm a Shakespeare nut and Ive witnessed Shakespeare productions performed in a multitude of different ways.  Many of these imaginative turns on Shakespeare can be very entertaining and involving when done correctly - unfortunately this realization of Titus Andronicus just didn't work for me.

There was allot of talent involved in Titus - maybe too much to be put in one room together - for there seems to be no lack of upstaging and no limit to the non-believable and sometimes over-the-top performancesl. Where was the director when these people were acting? To be fair Mr Hopkins didn't over act. Instead he gave what we now know now to be his typical performance - competent and low key - if anything he was underacting - which may have been the his only choice with this crowd. At times he seemed to be a bit bored.

To be fair to the filmmakers, the original story was all over the place - the play meanders and often feels like a hodgepodge anyway - so there really wasn't much to work with.  But doubling...no quadrupling down on the hodgepodge with outlandish costumes, make-up, scenery, acting and other distractions wasn't the answer.

So be warned - the photo of Titus's face on the cover is a good indication of the mind-numb expression that you may have if you sit through this entire film.  This film version of Titus Andronicus just may be the Ishtar of Shakespeare productions.

In all fairness to director July Tairmor. i have since seen her version of Shakespeare's The Tempest.  Although i didn't care for all of the changes to the original story.  It is an entertaining, imaginative and very coherent production and i would recommend for Shakespeare fans.",1199145600,6,3830,4.6895522388059705

TITUS is such a mixed bag of tricks that your attention is repeatedly drawn away from the story and is focused on all of Ms. Taymor's razzle-dazzle.

The movie adaptation is very good.  It stylishly and artfully brings to the screen the evil, violence, vanity and sorrows of humanity illustrated in Shakespeare's play.

The acting is absolutely superb on all counts...I could not imagine it being better.  The creative theatrics are interesting and soften the brutality of the play.  The meshing of different eras helps to span the gap of time from the Roman empire to today and make this relevant to our time.

This is Shakespeare's raw tragedy, unrefined by the divine eloquence of Hamlet or Macbeth. Even Richard III cannot measure up to the corrupting evil nature of Aaron and the Goths.  Still, the verses are profound and measured to stir the heart of listeners.

This is not for the squeamish and I would recommend reading the play prior to watching the movie so you know somewhat what to expect in action and plot.

You don't already have to be a Shakespeare fan to get hooked. This film, like the others mentioned, will grab you and it won't let go.

War, cruelty, vice, decadence, horror, death and sex are all still with us. The only thing lacking these days is honour, which proves to be Titus's big mistake. And there's a little less hope now than there was then. What struck me as specially brilliant is the way Taymore keeps us teetering on the top of the text, without ever quite toppling over. Just sometimes, you think you're about to laugh --- it's all so hideously gruesome: but, then, you don't laugh. It hits too hard. Superb performances, superb visuals and visionary imagination. This is far, far superior to McKellen's Richard III: the mixture of Shakespearean text and temporally cross-cut settings actually works here, where in Richard III it doesn't. Only one thing, Ms Taymore: shouldn't Tamora have the stress on the second syllable, not the first ?

Actually, the film is so powerful, it demands a rapid second viewing, since it can't be fully absorbed the first time round. Some of the points made by other reviewers seem just. Hopkins certainly speaks the lines as they should be spoken. It is essential not to fall into the trap of letting Shakespeare's rhythms run away with you: the inner sense and meaning has to be retained. The other actors aren't bad, but they could be better --- not in their performances, but in their delivery of the verse. Several other features fall into place. You realise that several of Shakes's later plays are foreshadowed. In Othello, the characters and colours of Aaron and Titus are switched: Titus becomes Othello, who puts personal honour above everything else; and Aaron becomes Iago, the devil with a chip on his shoulder. Titus also foreshadows Lear, whose judgement falters with his age. There are slight elements of Julius Caesar, and Hamlet. Probably also Coriolanus, which I'm not so familiar with. There must have been something in the contemporary Elizabethan scene which caused Shakespeare to reflect so frequently on the way that constitutional duty and military discipline were manipulated by the corruption and insane amorality of those with the ultimate power. There is of course more than a suggestion of Hitler in the character of Saturninus, and his relationship with Titus is not unlike Hitler's with the Wehrmacht. I must bone up on Shakespeare's sources. In the end the Goths sacked Rome, as we all know. This is a highly thought-provoking and generally wonderful production.",1161907200,2,2575,5.002331002331002

This is a truly nightmarish universe, where people are sliced and diced and bled and baked in pies.  Sick, sick, sick.  Definitely not for the squeamish.

Swords and uniforms from hundreds of years ago are juxtaposed with automobiles and tattooes.

Anthony Hopkins is great, as always, raging in his various uniforms and Jessica Lange is wonderful as the Queen of the Goths.  Everyone else is first rate.

As most reviewers have noted, it is definitely not for everyone, and it can be gruesome to watch.  Titus is Julie Traymor's adaptation of The Bard's ""worst tragedy"" (it was also his first), Titus Andronicus.

Traymor, who won a Tony for her Broadway version of The Lion King, originally wrote Titus as a play.  It is full of complete anachronisms-chariots, jeeps, and motorcycles all inhabit the Roman streets.  Romans wear rubber-soled boots and make use of Plexiglass.  Yet the lines are all pure Shakespeare (intense concentration and use of closed captioning are recommended).  As someone who enjoys historical movies, the anachronistic style made watching this movie difficult for me, but it is original and different from the norm.  The costumes are absolutely amazing, too.

1100378,5,6305963126,"In Julie Taymor's magical hands, William Shakespeare's most dismissible work - one which some experts even claim was not his own creation - is turned into a modern masterpiece of violence. Taymor's vision of Shakespeare is dark, surreal and highly stylized and is a perfect fit for this play. Some reviewers have criticized the many anachronisms in Titus. The point is that, unlike Loncraine's Richard III or Luhrmann's Romeo+Juliet, Titus isn't built around the point of transferring Shakespeare's story to modern age; Taymor's Titus doesn't occur in any specific time in history, and the anachronisms are there to help create the confusion and intense, psychotic surrealism that Taymor wants. And to describe Titus in one word, it would have to be 'intense'.

Titus is a wild ride through the human psych, through madness and violence and evil, one that is very nearly unbearable. The story is indeed crude, overtly violent at every turn and quite nearly infantile, and the dialogue is hardly class A Shakespeare; Taymor's film relies heavily on her highly imaginative and sensitive visual sense, one that comes from years of work in the theatre; as well as on her cast. Supported by a group of fantastic actors, including Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming and Harry Lennix among others, the film still lies on the shoulders of Anthony Hopkins, who gives an absolutely dazzling performance as the title character, and proves that he's one of the best living Shakespearian actors. Again, none of Titus's dialogues has the flare of the best of Shakespeare's work, but Hopkins's ecstatic performance gives the character depth and strength. Combined with Taymor's art direction, the film is a true experience, a gripping and uncompromising piece of cinema that refuses to let go of its viewers.

For these reasons exactly, Titus is not to everyone's taste. Many may find it excruciating and painful; but never for a minute dull. No matter what you've heard of it, Titus is unlike any other film you've seen, and in my opinion, that's what makes a film truly essential.

Being considered his worst play, ""Titus"" does not necessarily belong in this category of ""sacred plays"".

Julie Taymor manages to create a fascinating atmosphere and story with humorous elements as well as shocking scenes of cut-off heads and hung-up people being stabbed. Somehow she manages not to let this movie slip into a bloody splatter genre but by using many gothic elements and with the incredible cast (Hopkins as T.A.!), Titus remains to be one of the best Shakespeare movie adaptions ever.

Taymor's placing the plot in some sort of a parallel world with no clear signs of any historic era (there are strange cars driving around with drivers in 1930's uniforms as well as in antique armour) is just another well-picked trick to let this movie appear so surreal and yet so beautiful.

Sets and costume design are so good and so striking that they alone make this a film worthy of purchase. And the script is true to the evil and brutality that characterize the bard's original play; the social commentary is also extremely pertinent as we try to balance the degeneration and moral depravity of our own modern western society with honor, ethics and morality.

1100384,3,6305963126,"I am not a fan of movie adaptations deviating in the slightest detail from the source material.

Think of how much better such film tragedies as ""The Haunting"" and ""Hannibal"" could have been, were it not for the irresponsible and downright stupid interference of that most reprehensible of all Hollywood employees, the Adapted Screenplay Writer.

However, this is one case (and to date, the only one I've come across) where a little more omission on the part of the screenplay would have catapulted this Herculean effort into the ranks of 'Classic'.

'Titus' tells the tragic story of Titus Andronicus (Hopkins), a heroic general of Rome, and his family's trials as they suffer at the hand of their newly-crowned Empress Tamora (Lange). As with all Shakespearean titles, there are several sub-plots afoot, peppered liberally with treachery, murder, lust, intrigue and that hoariest of all chestnuts, revenge.

The cast here is utterly magnificent (save for a campy and overworked Chiron, portrayed so boyishly by the unfailingly amateur Johnathan Rhys-Myers). Hopkins is his usual excellent self, lending delerious humour and fragmented pathos to the titular character. Jessica Lange is similarly magnificent as the ruthless (if very wronged) Queen Tamora - here's an Actress of the first magnitude, who really ought to be in more films. Other cast nods go to Alan Cumming as the weak-willed Emperor Saturninus, and the charismatic and sensual Raz Degan as Alarbus.

In her directorial debut Julie Taymor has made brave and some brilliantly-executed moves with her visual treatment of this tragedy. Her neoclassical gothic visuals blend seamlessly with the disenfranchised tragedy emanating from the script, and her use of contrast in terms of visual tone is exciting and vivid - although her use of symbolism is somewhat obvious. In places her overreliance on the novelty of the visuals is uncomfortable, but on the whole she's created an exciting and somehow fitting visual motif to go with her grandiose treatment of 'Titus'.

The problem with 'Titus' is the source material: this is a dreadfully disjointed Shakespeare play. With so much high-octane drama unfolding in the first hour or so of the movie, the remaining two hours tend to overplay a very limited number of events. There's no real build in the tension, save for the last ten minutes of film, and though Hopkins, Cumming and Lange do their level best with what they have, it still can't save 'Titus' from sinking in the centre like an underdone blood pudding. Similarly, the pivotal scene at the end of the play where Tamora and her sons attempt to fool Titus with disguise just does not translate at all to the screen - or at least, not on a screen where everything is taken so seriously. Disguise is fine for 'The Merchant of Venice', maybe, but here it's just unbelievable.

And that's the final word on 'Titus', Magnificent performances and interesting direction are unfortunately marred by some visual fluffing and a truly lacklustre Shakespeare script. Which is a shame - had such a treatment been applied to 'MacBeth', or to 'Hamlet', we'd have had Oscars.

After reading the play in college years ago, I was just disgusted with the story and considered it my least favorite of his plays.  I wouldn't have rented this DVD or started watching it if I had known what it was.  Wow!  I was just blown away by the wonderful adaptation!  The acting was so fine, and the direction just so perfect, that even with the gruesome, impossible story line, it will now join my favorite performances of Shakespeare.  Lange is wonderful as the Goth queen -- her pleas for her son's life (and I am assuming that everyone knows the basic story of the cycle of revenge)are so true and heartfelt that my sympathies were always a little bit with her -- even at her worst moments (and she is indeed a bad person!), I could understand how she got that way.  She had seen the worst a person could see -- her son's ritual sacrifice by the Romans.  Her lover and henchman, Aaron was played very well indeed -- and my heart was even moved for him, who regretted any good deed he may have done, when he asks for his son's welfare.  And as to the two Goth bad boys (or as my old copy of Yale Shakespeare called them, veritable bashibazooks [isn't that a great word?}), well I thought them well done.  They are just violent, ruthless, idiots, and the actors did a good job.  The character of Livinia is one of the most pathetic in Shakespeare's works -- raped, hands hacked off, tongue ripped out -- good grief!  Yet the portrayal was riviting.  I liked the way of dealing with the hands.  It lead to an almost mythic presence -- a woman so ruined that she has stepped outside of humanity in her own eyes.  Finally, the portrayal of the emperor was just so much fun.  I loved it. I agree that there was a strong Fellini presence in the film, but I also was reminded of Pasolini's Oedipus, switching time frames and full of anachronism.

It's not quite a tragedy, not quite a black comedy. It belongs neither in Ancient Rome, Fascist Italy, or the here and now. It belongs neither in reality nor a dreamworld. Instead, it all belongs in the great mind of Julie Taymor. ""Titus"" would be a difficult play to create a great film about. It lacks a lot of the grace and human beauty that exists in Shakespeare's later plays and it actually doesn't feel very Shakespeare-like, hence why critics have tried to have it attached to a contemporary rather than sully the canon. It's a tale of rape, treachery, cannibalism, corruption, and vengeance, which lacks any real hope. In her grand vision, Taymor has given us the gore that exists without flinching from it and trust me you'll need a strong stomach at some points, but she also at the very end gives the viewer a sliver of hope that the violence won't repeat itself. The visual style is striking with the constant references to different times, which could've looked muddled, but they all look like they fit, even Tamora's get-up when she first meet Saturninus in comparison with her sons' punk outfits. Taymor's Rome looks very stylized, not quite like Rome ever has looked ever, a sort of dream Rome. Of course with anything involving Shakespeare, you can have the best looking movie, but without the acting to back it up, you have nothing. Fortuantely for Taymor, the performances are incredible. Anthony Hopkins, who is it must be said channeling Hannibal Lecter at points, and Jessica Lange play well off of one another as two parents who wound one another because of wrongs that began in war. Alan Cumming is at his best playing Saturninus. Harry Lennix is of course the marvel of the film. Aaron ,as a character, is so complex and has to go through so many different emotions that it takes a great actor to do the role. Lennix is that great actor. With intensity and incredible understanding, He is the person to watch in the film. All in all, ""Titus"" is a stunning movie, one that almost overpowers.

1100439,3,6305963126,"Julie Taymor's adaptation of one of Shakespeare's more obscure plays comes short in everything except the acting. This is due mainly to Julie Taymor's poor direction and choice of scenery: lacking any vision or purpose as to what theme she wants to convey by choosing such over-the-top disconjointed stage backgrounds.

  The story revolves around the Roman general Titus Andronicus (Anthony Hopkins) who returns to avenge the death of his sons against Tamora(Jessica Lange), a Gothic queen who has seduced the new emperor to advance her own ambitions. Factions form and a bitter power struggle ensues with murder, rape, incest, and cannibalism. This great play was horribly mutilated by Julie Taymor's pretentious attempts at using flashy montages that had no point or message other than for shock value and being pretentiously provocative.

  Taymor carelessly mixes modern motifs with traditional ones (e.g. motorcycles and guns with togas and swords, etc.) and turns the play into a pseudo-intellectual farce. Such techniques are hardly new and were effectively used by film makers who, unlike Taymor, had a point to make. Fellini sparingly (emphasis added) used some futuristic costumes and designs in his 'Satyricon' to convey the theme that the norms of ancient Rome were both strangely distant yet peculiarly near to those of our post-industrial culture. More recently in a modern adaptation of 'Richard III', Richard Loncraine changes the context of Shakespere's play into an imagined England which succombs to the fascism of the 1930s. Here Loncraine's approach is less symbolic than Fellini and simply transplants Shakespeare's entire play into the future. Unlike the latter films Taymor seems to want to imitate the techniques of her predecessors while forgetting why these techniques were used. The formidable acting of Antohny Hopkins and Jessica Lange is therefore suffocated along with the story itself by a careless montage aimed at shocking the audience without clear purpose.

  This is nothing more than a mediocre adaptation where the director is trying to change a Shakesperean tragedy into a melange of flash costumes and scenes that hamper rather than augment the force of the play. In terms of Shakespeare adaptations, I prefer Brannagh's 'Henry V' and similar works a lot more than this film.",1090886400,2,2318,5.346153846153846
1100440,2,6305963126,"Ms Taymor, let me say at the outset, is a highly creative director. Loved the Broadway show (The Lion King). She's innovative, imaginative, extremely adept at visual imagery, etc. What she isn't is adept at interpreting The Bard. The DVD version had her meeting with a group of NYU students discussing the production and the play, in which she showed exactly how shallow her understanding of Shakespeare actually is. Her focus was entirely on her vision, rather than his text. That shows up, rampantly in the movie. It's all about her and her imagination, never centering on the text or the innner beauty of Shakespeare's most brutal play.
I'm not saying that all the bard's plays have to focus on the grand design of the poetry, the meter, the frangrant, redolent language, but at least lip service should be paid there. In this version, we get stuffed with so many Taymor pipe dream (and I do mean a loaded hookah!) visuals, that the language is submarined into oblivion. Even so consummate an actor as Anthony Hopkins (why isn't he Sir Anthony, by now? ..get off your keister, Queenie!) can't compete with the hyperactive Ms Taymor and her busycam. She's obviously aiming for the Art House crowd (of which I am a sometime member, but not in good standing here, obviously), but she misses even that mark. Most of the ""innovative"" interpolations, such as the young kid who provides the framing device, are entirely superfluous, thereby losing any actually artistic force they might have achieved. It's nothing but empty window dressing.
The performances are largely execrable, including Sir Tony, I hate to report. His version of the Brando mumble is ill suited to the title role. Jessica Lange gives a nadir plumbing performance in a career that features a few of them. She was a lot more convincing in King Kong, trust me. The rest of the Mad Max rejects were even worse.
The reason I gave this film four viewings before sending the DVD on to a friend, was I thought perhaps it was just me, and I was being too reactionary or cynical about this brave new look at what is actually, in a way, one of my favorite Shakespeare plays. Then, midway through viewing #5, I thought, ""nah....this thing really is as bad as originally perceived.""
Last I heard, ""The Lion King"" was still playing on Broadway. My suggestion is, buy tickets to that, next time you are in NYC. As for this Turkey, my advice is to rent it if you must. Otherwise, don't put yourself through the torture I did.

Taymor's production, instead of trying to somehow mitigate the remorseless violence and moral vacuum which characterized the much-maligned play, intentionally plays it up. The garishness of the plot is complimented by the garishness of the anachronistic costumes, the elaborate staging and the delerious, overdramatic acting. It gets right to the heart of what a revenge drama is, and what value can be found in Andronicus just as a pure visceral experience. A lot of great performances, and the images are brilliant. My only complaint is, given the pacing of a modern film, it's difficult to hear and understand all of the dialogue sometimes, since none of it was 'updated' from the original Shakespearean. Given the stylized nature of everything else, maybe some of the dialogue should have been simplified.
Writing this now, comparisons to Kill Bill are inevitable, and, while it can't quite claim to reach that pedestal, and lacks the ultimatley morally redeeming value of the complete KB, I recommend it to fans of the KB pt. 1 as a similiar experience.",1087776000,2,1278,4.86697247706422
1100442,5,6305963126,"Titus is based on Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, which is an extremely bloody and terrifying tale of vengeance and its consequences.  The cinematic adaptation that Julie Taymor wrote is set in a Roman Empire-like environment with crossings of ancient and modern as the mise-en-scene displays cars as well as tanks with soldiers in ancient armor.  This creates a link between then and now, which could suggest that the displayed horror is timeless and possible even today.  Taymor creates exaggerations in this cinematic environment with brilliant cinematography, grand directing, and mise-en-scene that amplify the abstract atmosphere as it elevates the unnatural doings of Titus Andronicus (Anthony Hopkins), Tamora (Jessica Lange), and Saturninus (Alan Cumming) among others.  The Shakespearian violence that Taymor presents serves as the means to an end as the story plunges into a dark realm that most do not wish to visit, but must contemplate as it could have devastating effects on all.

The film opens with a scene where a young Lucius is sitting at the kitchen table, with a brown paper bag over his head, eating dinner while sadistically tearing the heads of his warrior dolls while violently smashing the items on the table and pouring ketchup over the ""killed"" dolls.  This is followed by an explosion where Lucius dives bawling to the floor for protection.  Lucius is a clear resemblance of his father Titus in the opening shot.  The rest of the film is a carnival of hideous acts and morbid behavior that alll falls around Titus with a domino effect trigged by one wrong decision.  Despite the distressing elements of Titus, the film offers a brilliant cinematic experience that devours the audience as it supplies several subplots and themes, which the audience should ponder under the light of human compassion and the word ""consequences"".",1085443200,3,1856,5.201342281879195
1100443,5,6305963126,"Titus Andronicus was always a powerful challenge for any director. Even, literally , this work has been often missunderstood. The young Shakespeare, still in his twenties , was just developing in this play, the future.
But what it's worth to state is the glorius stage the employement of a outstanding color effects to introduces us into the film.
The opening sequence in what we watch a child playing with toys a simple game like the war and the violence in a domestic and secure kitchen , inside a home placed surely in a protected neighborhood, and suddenly this child , like everybody of us are sent to the Roman Coliseum in just a second, since now it belongs to the story of the cinema.
The dazzling marche of the roman soldiers is spelling. And Titus emerging from the shadows with his twenty four died son, plus Hopkins giving that amazing speech make that film (with the wonderful exception of Touch of Evil (Orson Welles))be the overwheelming introduction fifteen minutes in many years in any other film of any genre.
I know this statement may be surprise to many people, but I think Anthony Hopkins has never been so comfortable in any  past role. He is surrounded by his natural environment, like the shakeperian universe. And maybe Hopkins has never been so extraordinary well in any of his performing and powerful roles. I mean, we are talking about one of the three best world actors.
From the opening to the end Hopkins and Jessica Lange go ahead all the rest of the cast. And this is the primal strength and perhaps his its only sign of weakness.
Who can deny the no restiction violence in this play? And what's the trouble with it?  That's precisely what the greek wanted when you went to a teatral play. It's what it has benn called the cathartic state. And believe or not, Julie Taymor could make it.
That's his the most relevant aspect to remark. All along the film you are in the presence of the most incredible feelings of revenge, cruelty, greed, ambition, betrayal, hunger of power and murder.
If you are able to say yes to the Shakespeare mood , come in to the movie. But if you still want to see just violence as simple entertaining , forget that film.
This work has another great virtue: Taymor made an adaptation which links brilliantly, past and present, because the clue is just to make us see that that story is not a horror tale in the perverse mind of a famous genius. We clearly can identify many characters and traslating without too much effort to the actual age.
This film is a ravishing gaze to the sordid but real facts that the human being, under certain circunstances may reach.
Don't miss this picture. Forget all the negative reviews you may listen or read. Experience by yourself this tragedy. Not only you'll be able to identify in Lavina a famous femenine character in his future works, but also another.

1100493,1,6305963126,"Despite the extremely positive reviews regarding Titus, I found the movie to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  I was attracted to the movie because I enjoy Shakespeare, historical dramas, and the great acting of Anthony Hopkins.  But this movie--what were they thinking?  There is one word to describe this movie: ugly.  Shakespeare's theme are ugly, the cinematography is ugly, the costumes are ugly.  The best movies with dark themes can be redeeming if they reveal imbedded truths of humanity.  This one fails miserably.  It is a long depressing ride.  Even worse than rollerball.
Some reviewers appreciate the mixture of the modern and Roman costumes.  I also enjoyed the mix, but within ten minutes the novelty wore off.  What I was left with was a movie with an extreme focus on novelties and the visual impression, but a senseless story meandering in pointlessness.
To waste time or not waste time?  That is the question when considering investing your time in this movie.",1081123200,13,1028,4.878612716763006
1100494,5,6305963126,"On a personal note: I took my fianc&eacute;e, who was suffering from some MAJOR pre-wedding jitters, to see this movie the night before our wedding. Whatever else can be said about this movie,  I can definitely say that her anxieties about the next day's nuptials had been utterly obliterated by the time the lights came
up. She is glad that she saw this movie, but has demurred on several occasions when I offer to rent it and bring it home.
Suffice it to say, this movie is an acquired taste, and a gentle reminder that even High Art such as Shakespeare can revel in blood, gore, sex and mayhem alongside the tawdriest of slasher flicks. In many ways, ""Titus"" is even more disturbing than the generally over-the-top slasher genre. The images of ""Titus"" burn themselves onto one's memory for all times.
Some reviewers gripe about the juxtaposition of Ancient Rome with 1930's Europe, but as another reviewer has pointed out, Shakespeare himself was hardly scrupulous in his historical accuracy, nor in minor details like stage settings and the like.  Whatever moves the story along works for the Bard. Even his ""historical"" plays can only be understood in the context of the political currents of Tudor/Stuart England. Shakespeare's plays lend themselves quite naturally to modern adaptations.
Of course, it is another issue entirely as to whether or not the adaptations are well done or not, and I would rank ""Titus"" alongside Ian McKellan's ""Richard III"" as one of the more memorable Shakespeare films in recent years.
Anthony Hopkins is fascinating to watch as a man so committed to duty and honor that he is willing to sacrifice virtually everything, including his own sanity. Equally fascinating is Jessica Lange, equally committed to the principles of vengeance no matter what the cost. Way back when Lange nearly demolished her career in ""King Kong,"" it would have been impossible to imagine her in a role such as this.

Some people may find this movie to be violent to an appalling degree --- if ever there were a need for ""viewer discretion advised,"" this would be it. But if you know what you are getting into, this will be a most memorable viewing experience.",1080691200,,2171,4.878048780487805
1100495,4,6305963126,"I am not a squeamish person -- I can sit through pretty much anything -- but this film had me squirming. Based on one of Shakespeare's first efforts it makes Macbeth and Hamlet look like sitcoms, the play is rife with murder, beheadings, evisceration, cannibalism, and revenge sweet revenge. That alone would be enough for me to recommend this film, but it doesn't end there.
Unlike earlier Shakespeare adaptations like Baz Lurhman's Romeo and Juliet, or Gil Junger's The Ten Things I Hate About You that take place in the here and now, this film is a walking talking anachronism that flits between the past and the present. Set amidst the decadence of 1930's fascist Italy, and the glory of the Roman Empire, it juxtaposes classical Roman stylings with post-modern architecture and dress. Furthermore, it combines elements of the classic Hollywood epic with the bombastic visuals of a 90's music video, and boasts sweeping vistas and grandiose sets that scream excess.
The acting is marvellous too, what else do you expect from any Hopkins fare! As the stoic leader reduced to an emotionally distraught outcast, his agony is palpable but not overwrought. Jessica Lange's effortlessly slips into the role of the revenge-obsessed matriarch determined to destroy Titus and his clan.
This movie is not perfect - some of the visuals (especially during Titus' bouts with insanity) are overblown, Allan Cumming is horribly miscast as Saturninus and the runtime is over three hours. But if you are a Shakespeare fan, or a serious action-flick buff, don't miss this brilliant piece of cinema.",1078617600,2,1584,5.0727969348659006

Julie Taymor certainly ""gets it.""  How many limbs are hacked off?  How much blood is spilled?  As with any true tragedy, you can guess from the beginning, ""not many of these people are going to be alive at the end.""
The production is a fabulous mixture of 20th century fascist and neo-classical.  She is taking MAJOR cues from Peter Greenaway, though without the same over-the-top gore and sex.
One would hope that such a successful revival might mean that other less-popular of the Bard's works might see the light of the silver-screen, but few get this dark.

(I suppose the blame for this must go to Shakespeare, who wrote it.) The small ray of hope shown at the end of the film is too small and comes too late to redeem the movie from the dark, miserable images which overwhelm it.  I can't forget this movie, but I would like to, because when I think of it I want to cry again.  Inhumanity brings only misery.  Perhaps that is the point.

1100498,5,6305963126,"I just wanted to say. . . a few of the reviewers are absolutely clueless and wrong in regard to the mixing of classical/contemporary motifs (i.e., ""this horrible misinterpretation of Shakespeare"" . . . ""people dressed as ancient Romans, riding around in motorcycles and cars, speaking ancient gibberish"").  The belief that contemporary interpretations of Shakespeare should ""[e]ither keep it classic (with ancient sets, costumes, and speech), or make it modern (with modern sets, costumes, and speech)"" totally negates and ignores the actual nature of Shakespeare's works.  It is no small wonder that the reviewer I'm alluding to found little enjoyment from this production. . . knowing a bit about Shakespeare's aesthetic and method of making art does help in enjoying how people interpret his plays. . .
I guess that I'm saying all of this because in Shakespeare's times (and in many of his plays). . . his plays (and the productions of his plays) were meant to be anachronistic.  They contained chronological mistakes. . . for example, if we saw an actor wearing a watch in Mel Gibson's Braveheart. . . it doesn't fit.  Well, Shakespeare's plays contain purposeful (and accidental) mistakes like this. . . in essence, watches all over the place.  His plays combine elements of the ""old,"" classical times. . . say, Ancient Rome in the case of Titus. . .  But, they also contain references to topical events and British culture/society.
Shakespeare (whether by pure intent or mistake) often blurred the line between time and setting in the way his plays are presented.  Taken from real, historical perspectives. . . plays like Richard III would make no sense to our disgruntled reviewer. . .  Richard III contains a character (Margaret) who had been dead for several decades (maybe even centuries. . . I can't remember, exactly) before Richard was even born.  However, she is a living, breathing entity in the play and even a British audience in the time of Shakespeare would have known that she was out of place. . . BUT ACCEPTED THE DISCREPANCY AS PART OF THE PLAY'S STYLE.  Shakespeare put this character from the past in his play (and she almost seems like a ghost) to haunt Richard and represent the lingering shame of a bloody Bristish history of vengence and betrayal.  Thus, mixing an out of place element into a Shakesperean play is not bad. . . Shakespeare does it all the time, even in his choices of characters and setting. . .
This isn't even to start citing examples of how certain props in certain plays are completely out of place in the supposed ""reality"" of the production.  For instance, scores of flowers that appear in Shakespeare's plays stick out like sore thumbs in the setting they're in.  The gloomy blooms of Ophelia's despair in Hamlet (DENMARK) are mostly (if not all) flowers from the British countryside located around Stratford on Avon. . .  Even the flower names murmured back and forth between the lovers of A Midsummer Nights' Dream (GREECE). . . yep, those flowers aren't Greek either. . . they're primarily British. . . from around Stratford on Avon. . .
I ramble, I make little sense and discredit my own assertions by continuing to talk.  Still, I thought it was important to mention this stuff because it actually demonstrates what a quality production Taymore's Titus is. . .  Her choices and decisions regarding people wearing Roman armor (who also drive around in cars) is little more than paying homage to Shakespeare's own love of mixing and matching different cultures, time periods and elements within his plays.  The combination of modern elements with the savagery of ancient Rome has a special power. . . to miss that is to miss the better point of Shakespeare.
By looking at the ""savagery"" and bloodlust of a classical civilization, Taymore allows us to realize how little difference exists between our culture and that ""savage"" time period.  The whole point is. . . as you are disturbed by ""ancient roman armor"" next to an arcade game like Space Invaders. . . or the ruins or Rome being the setting for motorcycles and modern vehicles. . . I think you come to realize that there is no juxtaposition. . . no jarring difference or uneveness about classical and ""modern"" elements being present, side by side. . . Taymore's work is powerful because it points out that be it Ancient Rome (legions and all) or the United States/Western World, year 2000. . . . the brutality and lesson of Titus is timeless.  Any revulsion to these weird combinations is actually a revulsion to the truth. . . that they are no different to each other within the fabric of the play.  Titus is an endearing, sad commentary by Shakespeare about the downward spiral of murder and needless death represented by stories like Cain and Abel.
Hence the reason Shakespeare's work is so often called ""universal"" and ""timeless.""  This production is a fine, postmodern interpretation of the disjointed elements of revenge. . . and it also portrays Shakespeare's (and our own society's) eventual preoccupation with violence and tragedy.  There are many, many better reviews here. . . I mainly wrote this to point out that playing with the time and chronological elements of a Shakespeare play is not sacrilege. . . it actually demonstrates that Taymore knows about the play and the spirit in which it was conceived/performed/observed by audiences.
I doubt I even explained what I wanted to. . . still, check out (Sir) Ian McKellan's Richard III if you have the chance and are interested in another excellent contemporary portryal of a play by Shakespeare.  However, I still find Titus more riveting and visually brilliant than McKellan's Richard III. . . . so, buy, rent, steal Titus if you're a fan of Shakespeare (or just interested in the sociology/the human psyche).  It's not for the faint of heart, but. . . then again, which tragedy by Shakespeare is. . . ?

1100500,5,6305963126,"The fault with ""Titus"" is basically the original play by William Shakespeare.  ""Titus Andronicus"" was his first and clearly the least of the Bard's tragedies.  It is also the bloodiest, in which a series of ghastly mutilations is but prelude to the slaughter of the principles in the final scene.  In that regard the end is similar to ""Hamlet"" and ""King Lear,"" but without the artistry or the more developed sense of tragedy.  What artistry is present in this 2000 film comes from first time film director Julie Taymor, who has done a theatrical performance of ""Titus Andronicus,"" but who is best known as the Tony award winning director of ""The Lion King.""
Taymor claims this story with the title sequence of the film, in which the Roman general Titus Andronicus (Anthony Hopkins) returns to Rome after his victorious campaign against the Goths.  His soldiers, in full armor and blue mud, march into the coliesium in a grandly stylized and totally arresting manner, bearing the bodies of Andronicus' twenty one dead sons along with his four living ones.  Among the captives brought to Rome are the Queen of the Goths, Tamora (Jessica Lange) and her three sons, the oldest of which is sacrificed (drawn and quartered, for starters).  Tamora vows revegne against Andronicus and his family, and the story heads towards its bloody conclusion.
My single memory of the play, reinforced by a photography of a stage performance with Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, was of the fate of Lavinia, the daughter of Titus, who is raped and then has her tongue cut out and her hands amputed by her assailants.  Later in the play, holding a stick with the stumps of her arms, she is able to scratch out in the dirt the crime committed against her and the names of her rapists.  However, this is put one horrible aspect of the larger tale.  If this is not the most depressing Shakespeare play it is simply because we have little sympathy for the title character, who gives over the crown, the empire, and his family to Saturninus (Alan Cumming), who might end up being short of Caligula on the crazed Roman emperor scale, but is definitely heading in that direction.
Listening to Hopkins declaim Shakespeare is a joy, but his casting for this particular role becomes problematic at the end when comparisons to Hannibal Lecter become unavoidable (all due to Shakespeare's play more so than anything the actor or director bring to the proceedings).  For me the troublesome bit of casting is Cummings, because allowing him to become emperor is just such a bad move.  At least Lear with his stupid divide the kingdom in thirds nonsense thought it over.  Titus refuses the crown and tosses it to Saturninus, only to be stunned when things go bad in a hurry.  He then compounds this mistake with a series of others ending in the bloodbath at the end.
Ultimately it is Taymor's creative way of dealing with the text andthe problems it presents, that makes ""Titus"" worth watching for students of Shakespeare.  To put it in the same context as Ian McKellan's ""Richard III,"" misses the mark, for there is more here than changing the period in which the story is told.  There are stronger similarities to Baz Lurhmann's ""William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet,"" but Taymor's stylistic excess goes far beyond that production as well.  I am sure there will be those who take issue with her choices, but you have to respect the ambitious effort to dress up the shortcomings of this play into something more palatable.  In ""Titus Andronicus"" there is really nothing to be learned, beyond the idea that you should never let somebody else be emperor and kill all your enemies as quickly as possible.
This is one of those DVDs where the extras earn the fifth star for the rating (by itself the film is at least a 4).  No doubt it is Julie Taymor's theater background that explains the depth of the commentary track that she provides (there is also an interview on the second disc), but in this regard at least she puts every director who shows up for such things are mumbles a few anecdotes about making the movie to shame.  When you see what Taymor has done with the least of Shakespeare's tragedies, you have to be intrigued by what she might be able to accomplish with one of the classics.",1073692800,5,4258,4.728378378378379

Don't attempt to be ""artsy"" by combining the two, because in this case the result is a mixed up mess (posing as art).

1100502,4,6305963126,"TITUS ANDRONICUS is perhaps the least regarded of Shakespeare's plays, and there are several reasons.  Written early in his career, it shows little of the brilliant language we associate with Shakespeare's work; moreover, the plot is extremely derivative and so extravagant as to be virtually unbelievable, owing a great deal to both Roman ""closet drama"" and the ""revenge tragedy"" popular at the start of Shakespeare's career.  At best, most critics regard it as developmental; at worst, a virtually unperformable mishmash of spurting blood and grotesque comedy.
The plot is notoriously bloody.  Titus Andronicus has returned to Rome after successfully subduing the Goths, and he brings with him Tamora, Queen of the Goths, and her three sons as prisoners.  Upon his arrival, and in spite of Tamora's pleas for mercy, he sacrifices Tamora's oldest son--but when Tamora's charms cause the newly crowned emperor Saturnius to crown her as empress, Tamora and her Moorish lover Aaron plot to destroy Andronicus for his refusal to show mercy to her oldest son.  And the revenge they wreck is horrific indeed, as is the revenge Andronicus seeks against them in return.  Before the story ends, we've seen rape, limbs lopped off, tongues plucked out, and two heads baked in a pie.
Given the outrageous nature of the story and the very loosely constructed plot and script, it shouldn't be a surprise that director Julie Taymor's film is not entirely successful.  What IS surprising is that TITUS is as successful as it is.  Coming from a remarkably strong theatrical background, Taymor follows suit with the script, giving it the most extravagant visual and highly theatrical style her limited budget will allow.  When it works, it works extremely well; when it fails, which is fairly often, it is at least visually interesting.
Although I found that Anthony Hopkins' performance in the title role left something to be desired, he is at worst rock solid; this aside, the overall cast is amazingly good, with the major laurels going to Jessica Lange as the evil Tamora and Harry J. Lennix as her doubly evil lover-slave Aaron; Alan Cumming also makes a vivid impression as the weak-minded and ineffectual Emperor Saturnius, as does Laura Fraser as Titus' hapless daughter Lavinia.
But as previously noted, the great attraction here is the look of the thing.  In terms of the script itself, Taymor is very faithful to the original--but in order to bolster its weaknesses she transposes the story to a collage-like never-never land that includes elements of ancient Rome, the roaring 20s, set pieces that would seem lifted from the notorious film CALIGULA, and fascist Italy.  There are moments when the effect is flatly awkward--the first few opening minutes of the film being a case in point.  But for the most part, Taymor's stylistic vision is quite remarkable, and while you may not care for the basic vision it remarkably done nonetheless.
For myself, I did not particularly expect to enjoy this film, but even though I was extremely critical of some of Taymor's ideas I found myself watching it straight through from beginning to end.  The extras here are also quite impressive, including an extremely memorable ""making of"" documentary that includes interviews with Taymor, Hopkins, Lange and other members of the cast and crew; an extremely interesting director's audio track on selected scenes; and a video of a ""Q & A"" session Taymor did with film students immediately following a screening.
Those most likely to enjoy the film are people with a strong interest in theatre, design, and art films with an extreme edge; for them it will probably be a ""must own.""  At the same time, however, I do not put it entirely out of bounds for more casual viewers, for there is much to recommend it--but I would also suggest they watch it before making a purchase.

1100583,5,6305963126,"If it please you all, let me tell you of a movie that will vex your souls, yet as one of the best, imaginative Shakespearean movie adaptations.  There is murder, rape, massacre, acts of treason, villainy, complots, and violent revenge.  I speak of none other than the story of Roman general Titus Andronicus.
Andronicus has returned victorious from a war with the Goths, but for him it was Pyrrhic, as it claimed twenty-one of his sons, four surviving.  In time-honoured tradition, he has the proudest of the captives, the eldest son of the Goth's queen, Tamora, sacrificed by having his limbs hewn and his entrails offered to the gods.  He ignores the tearstricken pleas of the queen, who begs on her knees.  This only has her thirsting for revenge when by a chain of events, she becomes the betrothed of Saturnine, the new emperor.  ""I'll find a day to massacre them all"" she vows.  Andronicus himself refused the crown in order to pacify the factions between Saturnine and his brother Bassianus.  He prefers a ""staff of honour, not a scepter to control the world.""
However, he and his remaining sons and only daughter Lavinia are caught in the traps of Tamora's revenge.  And it is the scheming Moor, Aron, Tamora's lover, who guides the queen's odious young sons, Chiron and Demetrius, in their desire for Lavinia, already pledged to Bassianus.  Those who have read the play will know the horrific ordeal she goes through.  Even though the actual act is not portrayed, the results are graphically disturbing but vivid.  ""No tongue to call, nor hands to wash"" taunt Chiron and Demetrius.  When her uncle Marcus finds her, his expression speaks for him before he utters the words, ""If I do wake, some planet strike me down that I may slumber in eternal sleep.""  When he asks her to speak, she opens her stricken mouth and a stream of blood comes cascading out where her tongue was.  ""Come, let us go, and make thy father blind, for such a sight will blind a father's eye.""  The sight totally breaks Titus in a mixture of grief and madness, and the revenge that follows is horrible.
This is Anthony Hopkins' greatest performance, exceeding Picasso (Surviving Picasso) and Stephens (Remains Of The Day).  As Titus Andronicus, he portrays the general with the tragic flaw of his blind obedience to the state and tradition before that of his own sons, at the cost of his compassion.  It is an irony that he begs for such when two of his sons are framed and condemned to death.  Alan Cumming does Saturninus as a petulant and effeminate emperor, complete with greased hair, yet his makeup sometimes does make him resemble a garish clown.
Laura Fraser does exceptionally well as Lavinia, exhibiting a young woman completely shattered in her traumatized and mutilated state.  Yet another irony follows when how one moment she haughtily taunts Tamora during her forest tryst with the Moor, yet when she is captured by her to-be mutilators, she complete changes her tune, begging for her life, then asking her to be kill her with mercy.
Harry Lennix's portrayal of Aron, the grand schemer who seeks to topple all, is perfect as ""the devil incarnate.""  Never has there been a more chilling portrayal of a pernicious schemer who shows no regrets to his foul deeds.  Jessica Lange plays Tamora as a woman bent on vengeance for the horrible loss of her son, but whose guile isn't infallible.
What really makes this film amazing is the visual style, wild, sometimes garish, and graphic.  It can be seen in director Julie Taymor's other film Frida.  The anachronistic liberties to the film may befuddle Shakespearean purists.  The confrontation between Saturninus and Bassianus is translated to the two of them in a motorcade, shouting into bullhorns at their supporters.  Trucks and armoured vehicles are joined with the usual march of Roman soldiers, and there are the grey fascist uniforms worn by soldiers.  And Tamora's two sons are more at home in a bogus punk band like Green Day.  And punk guitars are heard at certain times to capture their attitude.
Yet despite the killing, mutilation, and violence, the final shot has a note of hope for a new tomorrow, where all hatred and blood will be washed clean.  Despite all the tragedy, a memorable film not to be missed.",1062806400,12,4261,4.798630136986302

I'm not even going to pretend that I know good Shakespeare or bad Shakespeare.  I imagine if Anthony Hopkins is doing it, it's probably being done well.  So when it comes to this type of material, I just sit back for the ride and try to be entertained.
I suspect that the makers of this film also realize that most people aren't brushed up on their Shakespeare, so they take a slant on the film to attract a modern audience. ""William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet"" a few years ago did this fairly successfully by bringing the story to California street-gang level.  This one also goes for a bizarre touch, and I will at least agree it held my interest.
This is a story where there don't seem to be any really good guys.  There's a king who has power, but then there's Anthony Hopkins who seems to have money and military might.  The king takes on Jessica Lange as his wife, and they proceed to party the way Rome was famous for in it's heyday.  She also has two grown sons who perform some unspeakable acts on the grown daughter of Anthony Hopkins.  How he reacts to this becomes the rest of the film.
The visuals are amazing in that they throw everything but the kitchen sink on the screen.  The plot is supposedly ancient Rome, but the most dominant period seems to be the Middle Ages.  Yet we also have cars and rock and roll music.  And much more brutal, shocking violence than you can imagine.

1100587,4,6305963126,"Shakespeare scholars routinely dismiss Titus Andronicus as the Bard's ""worst"" play. History shows he wrote it as a potboiler designed to fill the Globe Theatre with Elizabethan fans of sex and violence. Julie Taymor has thrown in the rock 'n' roll element, turning this so-called ""worst"" play into a fever dream of epic proportions.
It's both horrifying and beautiful. The players in this film are fighting for power, be it political, personal or in the bedroom. The play is set in ancient Rome but the landscape of this film turns the setting into a strange mix of past, present and futuristic. There's elements of A Clockwork Orange to the violence, and Anthony Hopkins, in the title role, takes a few satirical jabs at his Hannibal Lechter performances. Industrial music fills the soundtrack, surreal dreams play out before your eyes, we tour ancient catacombs, a Mussolini-era building gives the underlying fascist elements a real punch. Performances are uniformly excellent, as characters engage in an unrelenting melee of betrayal, revenge and human depravity at it's most despicable (and most sensuous too!)
For those unschooled in Shakespearean language, the plot is pretty easy to follow. Try turning on the subtitle function of your DVD if you need a little help following the plot. Gore fans won't be dissappointed. The bloodletting and cannibalism genre didn't start with Herschell Gordon Lewis, as Titus proves time and again.",1047427200,6,1439,5.206896551724138

1100590,5,6305963126,"William Shakespeare's tragedy ""Titus Andronicus"" gets something of a Baz Luhrmann ""Romeo & Juliet"" style treatment from director Julie Taymor, in her visionary film adaptation of the play, ""Titus,"" starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange.  It's one of the more brutal and disturbing offerings from the bard, who seeks to expose the myriad chambers of darkness that can be found within the human psyche, which Taymor (who also wrote the screenplay) ferrets out and presents to optimum-- if often disconcerting-- effect.  It's a tale of revenge and madness; of revenge born of grief, and madness born of sorrows layered upon sorrows that are simply beyond the endurance of mortal man, the attendant emotions of which Taymor captures in a tapestry of images plaited throughout this blood stirring drama, making it-- for better or worse (as this is one that's definitely going to ""stay"" with you awhile)-- an altogether unforgettable motion picture experience.
A soldier for forty years, General Titus Andronicus (Hopkins) has commanded the Roman legions to countless victories on the field of battle, and along with his army is just returned home from their latest conquest.  Once in Rome, Titus will oversee the ceremonial salute to the fallen and the burial of those who died in battle; then he will attend to his prisoners, the Queen of the Goths, Tamora (Lange) and her three sons.  For Titus, life is in order and all is well; but though he doesn't realize it yet, all of that is about to change.
Titus has four sons, but it is his only daughter, the beautiful Lavinia (Laura Fraser), who will play a leading role in the drama that is about to unfold, which begins with the untimely death of Caesar.  Though it is but an opinion, when Titus is asked which of Caesar's son's he favors for succession, Saturninus (Alan Cumming) or Bassianus (James Frain), his choice holds sway, and subsequently triggers an irreversible chain of events which ultimately beget the final tragedy of the story.  Before the end, however, Titus Andronicus will suffer the agonies of hell; but into that dark night, he will not go quietly.
Within the first few minutes of a film, a good director will let you know what you're in for, and Taymor succeeds in doing so here.  The riveting opening sequence, in which Titus and his soldiers march in hypnotic cadence into Rome, sets the style and tone for all that follows.  Taymor's staging and choreography are brilliant; orchestrated to draw in the audience and hold them, and she does, in absolutely mesmerizing fashion.  Set in ancient Rome, Taymor nevertheless refuses to be bound by the parameters of ""era,"" going ""out of the box"" to draw upon and blend time periods in an effort to realize her personal vision and bring her imaginative presentation of the play to fruition.  There are microphones, for example, in front of the Capitol; and in procession through the streets of Rome, chariots are preceded and/or followed by automobiles and motorcycles.  All of which is played out against a rhythm of excitement that effectively impacts the drama, bringing it all so vibrantly to life.  To find the true pulse of the story, Taymor evokes a sense of Olivier/Welles/Branagh and fuses it with a combination of Luhrmann and ""West Side Story,"" which makes her film not only emotionally involving and compelling, but visually stunning as well.  And though she draws upon the best of the best to make her film all that it can be, what you see on the screen it pure Taymor; the expression of a unique and inimitable artistic genius.
As Titus, Anthony Hopkins gives a solid, if not his best, performance.  His portrayal is thoroughly convincing (which goes without saying, of course, with Hopkins), but the usual pure and resonant timbre of his voice occasionally and quite noticeably falters, though his elocution remains a study in perfection.  An actor who can play any role, Hopkins may always be remembered as Hannibal in ""Silence of the Lambs,"" but without question, he was born to play Shakespeare.  One would think, in fact, that his resume would be filled with cinematic adaptations of such; curiously, however, it is not.  And while his Titus may be comparatively sub-standard ""Hopkins,"" in the end, he manages to make the role his own with yet another memorable performance.
Initially, casting Jessica Lange as Tamora seems an odd choice, inasmuch as this is her first foray into the Shakespearian arena.  In the final analysis, however, it is very much in keeping with the less than conventional approach Taymor employs here, and Lange comports herself well with her portrayal of the malevolent Queen of the Goths.  She lends a definitive physical countenance to the role, and in her eyes you can discern the shadows that plague her soul and the fire that sparks her quest for revenge.  It's a performance that goes far in demonstrating that Lange is, indeed, a consummate actor, with a range that substantiates her stature as an Oscar winner.
Also turning in performances of note are Cumming, who is deliciously loathsome as Saturninus; Fraser, whose Lavinia is endearingly fragile and vulnerable; and Harry J. Lennix as the manipulative, despicable Moor, Aaron.
The supporting cast includes Colm Feore (Marcus Andronicus), Angus MacFadyen (Lucius), Osheen Jones (Young Lucius), Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Chiron), Matthew Rhys (Demetrius), Kenny Doughty (Quintus), Blake Ritson (Mutius), Colin Wells (Martius), Raz Degan (Alarbus), Ettore Geri (Priest) and Constantine Gregory (Aemelius).  There's no escaping the fact that the story of ""Titus"" is gruesome, to say the least.  Many will find it offensive, even insufferable, especially the ending, which is a sordid business no matter how you slice it.  But the vigor and vision of Taymor's production makes it engrossing, stimulating entertainment that is entirely accessible and will appeal to an audience that transcends hard core Shakespeare aficionados.  If not madness, there is definitely magic in her method, which is more than evident on the screen.  And that's the magic of the movies.",1034380800,18,6079,5.061061061061061
1100591,4,6305963126,"Now, modern interpretations of Shakespeare are welcome in today's society, but sometimes I wonder is if this really what Shakespeare had in mind. I think Julie Taymore takes it a bit too far here in her feature debut, ""Titus"", based on Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, his bloodiest play.
Anthony Hopkins plays Titus Andronicus, a triumphant and veteran Roman general who returns home to Rome for the last time to bury the dead and retire. The Senate is ready to proclaim him Emperor when he denies and reccomends the thrown to Saturnius (Alan Cumming), who is weak and impressionable. He eventually takes Tamora, queen of the Goths (Jessica Lange) as a wife. It all starts going downhill from there. Tamora's two sons rape an brutally assault Lavinia, Titus' daughter. When her uncle discovers what has been done to her, it is a gruesome scene. Lavinia in the swamp will be a scene I never forget. But, this is Shakespeare, so the film is about the breakdown of Titus, not of the Empire. Hopkins portrays what has to be one of the best of his career - he's always seemed to be a reserved kind of actor, not wanting to risk his body because of his age, but in ""Titus"" he's on the ground, climbing, freaking out, moving, the whole deal! Incredible!
But, this is Shakespeare, so sit back and relax for 2+ hours of big words and actors talking so fast you've got to backtrack. I think Taymor's only flaw is that she put too much emphasis on the costumes and scenery - I know it's what won all the awards - but it just gets too much in the end. It's almost sensory overload for your eyes. Eliot Goldenthal's score, however, is a feast for your ears! He mixes jazz, classical, and opera all in one score - fantastic. To sum it up, ""Titus"" is a stylish bloodbath (oxymoron?) with the true Shakespeare enviroment, even down to the asides, where the actors look right into the camera and into your eyes.
""Titus"" makes you feel uncomfortable at times with violence, dazzle your senses through sight and sound - and may even make you feel dirty...incredible how a bard over 500 years ago could do that even today.",1026864000,7,2102,4.593085106382978
1100642,5,6305963126,"Not to be (overly) rude, but I think some people are cut out for this film and some aren't. It's not a popcorn-munching film that you sit down to watch with your wife because Anthony Hopkins and Alan Cumming are your favorite actors; it's not - as all have heard - a traditionally filmed, straightforward Shakespearean production; it is not for people who do not like, or at least know, Shakespeare.
Some of the complaints I have heard about this movie are: that it is too violent, that it was disappointing that the screenplay was taken from the actual text of Titus Andronicus, that the anachronistic touches - or ""smatterings"", depending on who you are - were ridiculous... and to those people I can just say one thing: sorry.
Seeing a Julie Taymor production requires imagination on the part of the viewer - if you've seen her production of ""The Lion King"", that's something you already know. You have to walk into the movie - or the show - with the attitude that what you are going to see is a show, it is an artistic interpretation. It is certainly - at least in this case - NOT a straightforward reading from ""Titus Andronicus"", a few cuts to make it fit on a two and a half hour disc, some banal sets and strong performances. In a way, if there weren't a few people that hated this movie, I'd be... worried?
By the first time I saw this movie, I had already heard of it's quasi-legendary violence, it's ""ridiculous"" juxtoposition of the first and third millenium. This is a VERY violent movie, and if you can't deal with violence, take my word that it is indeed a good movie, but don't see it. There's a difference between a violent movie and a bad movie.
It's almost frustrating that some of the films more harsh critics (the general public) couldn't see the second disk of Titus before throwing it to the wayside, a disk on which both Taymor and the actors explain their individual motivation in their part and, more importantly, Taymor's cut. For those who think that Titus is merely stylized violence, know that there is MUCH more to Titus than meets the eye.
The performances in Titus are fantastic. The images are vivid and haunting (Lavinia looks much better WITH hands and a tongue...)... and for those that think that Taymor's interpretation is sick, know that the story itself was written by Shakespeare. The hand-chopping, tongue cutting, etc, was not her idea. I'm sorry if some think that it's too realistic, but don't we see movies - as opposed to plays - when we WANT to see something more realistic (set-wise at least)?
I think Titus is quite something. Yes it's in Shakespearean English, but as long as you know that going into the movie and have read Shakespeare before, you shouldn't have any trouble... or much at least. The voices are very, very clear, and the lines are very rarely awkward, which in a modern movie of a Shakespeare production, is a rare thing (see ""Romeo and Juliet"").
Believe me, this movie is very unorthodox, as you will notice from the very first minute, but stand back, look at the style - both the visuals AND the acting - and, at the very very least, give it the artistic credit it is due. It is ENJOYABLE to watch, and a movie I would happily own.",1026432000,10,3202,4.551126516464471

1100644,5,6305963126,"This is one of Shakespeare's earlier works and like most of them the language is hard to understand without seeing it performed on stage, however, to produce it for the theatre is difficult due to the extreme violence.  Believe me, this is not for children; this play in particular was written in the style of the Roman playwright Seneca with it's emphasis on supernatural elements, bloody violence, and obsessive passion.  Although these elements are prevalent in Shakespeare's later, tragic works none (in my opinion) are to the graphic degree of this piece.
Taking that into consideration the director did an excellent job of redeeming this difficult play and Anthony Hopkins plays the titular character in such an excellent way one relates to his madness.
One thing of note is the character Aaron, Tamora's moorish lover.  One can see how Shakespeare later developed Othello's Iago from him.",1024963200,2,895,5.116438356164384
1100645,5,6305963126,"Julie Taymor has done a wonderful job with this film.  It is a richly textured, visually sumptuous film.  Taymor manages to create a setting which evokes both ancient Rome and a nameless post-apocalyptic world.
The set design (by Dante Ferretti) is beautiful, at times stark and frightening, at others, majestic and dazzling. The costumes also are perfect, blending the past, present and future, to create a look which perfectly complements the set design. This is not your typical summer stock Shakespeare with the cast dressed in their Elizabethan best.
Taymor manages to give us her own unique vision without sacrificing Shakespeare's words; her screenplay is remarkably faithful to the source material.
The actors are perfect in this film.  Anthony Hopkins demonstrates his ease with Shakespeare's words and flawlessly takes Titus from victorious leader to grieving father, then on to madness and revenge. Hopkins manages ferocity without the least bit of scenery-chewing.
I've read other reviewers who have derided Jessica Lange. I completely disagree; she is excellent as Tamora.
The supporting cast, too, are excellent.  Colm Feore as Marcus Andronicus, Harry J. Lennix as Aaron, and Laura Fraser as Lavinia are all right on the mark.
As good as the actors are, it is Taymor's film.  It looks like no other film, it manages to achieve the level of true art without pretense, and it does justice to the source material.

The costumes and sets are out of this world.  They are a strange mixture of beauty, the like of which I've never seen.  But Julie Taymor's greatest gift to us is that she shows us the eternal genius of Shakespeare.
Taymor's cast animates Shakespeare's words and characters into the fabulous full life they deserve. My personal favorite is Titus with his profound expressions of grief, loss and despair.  No matter how many times I watch it, I am moved to dumb wonder again and again as Anthony Hopkins recounts his sorrows to the stones.
It becomes apparant that the long tradition of disparaging criticism of this play, which started well after Shakespeare's death, was due primarily to a general distaste for the type of strong violence that is an essential theme of the play. But as the public's taste shifts back towards a greater tolerance for violence, Julie Taymor's inspired organization of great talent proves this tradition wrong and shows us that ""Titus Andronicus"" was in fact one of Shakespeare's most perfect works of art.

This movie is very graphic in it's violence and sexual content and should NOT be viewed by young children, incest and cannibalism being among the more disturbing themes that run their course in this film.
The acting of course is impeccable, but then again what do you expect from Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange. That being said I have to profess my bias for the traditional approach to Shakespeare and would have loved to see them in something a little closer to what the Bard had in mind when he penned his famous prose.

1100648,5,6305963126,"Let me assure you that this is one spectacular movie. I doubt you will find any film adaptation of a Shakespeare play that is as visually impressive. As for the story, this is not the Shakespeare you were introduced to in high school. This was The Bard's first tragedy, as well as one of his first plays. History has it that he was very young when he wrote it, while legend claims that he was out to top his arch rival, playwright Christopher Marlowe. He pulled out all the stops, intent, it seems, on writing a real crowd pleaser. As a result, Titus Andronicus is so sexy and so violent that it rivals the stories in many of today's movies. Some English professors, in fact, refuse to believe it was written by Shakespeare at all, though I believe it has been proved that he did.
Titus, played by Anthony Hopkins, is a respected Roman general. The movie opens as he returns to Rome after successfully defeating the Goths. Victory has come at a price. He is about to bury many of his sons, who died in battle. He has taken prisoner the Queen of the Goths, Tamara [Jessica Lange], and her three sons. For retribution and to appease the Gods, he orders her eldest son put to death, despite her cries for mercy. The Emperor of Rome has recently died, and the Senate asks Titus to take his place. Wisely, or so he thinks, Titus declines and nominates Saturninus [Alan Cumming], one of the Emperor's two sons. Saturninus choses Titus' daughter, Lavinia [Laura Frasier], to be his bride. She spurns him for his brother, Bassinus [James Frain]. The new Emperor is furious at both Bassinus and Titus. Immediately, he asks Tamara to marry him. She accepts readily, for she knows that this position of power can enable her to get her revenge against Titus and his entire family. She enlists the aid of her remaining sons, Chiron and Demitrius [Jonathan Rhys-Meyer and Matthew Rhys]. Meanwhile, Aaron [Henry Lennix], a disgruntled Moorish slave, has dreadful plots of his own to implement.
Before long, everyone is headed for a climax that will both surprise and appal you.
Hopkins and Lange are in top form. Nobody plays an intriguing madman better than Hopkins. As Tamara, Lange is both sensuous and cold-blooded, so much so that she will send chills up your spine. Other notable cast members include Henry Lennix, Jonathan Rhys-Meyer and Colm Feore as Titus' brother.
This is director Julie Taymor's first movie. She is well know in the theater world for her imaginative staging of such musicals as The Lion King. She has made a minor masterpiece of Titus, and I expect her to be a major movie presence in the coming years. She stages the film as the tragedy it is, but she also plays to its aspects of black comedy. Its as though she knows that Shakespeare wrote this as dark entertainment and not as something to be taken seriously. She gives it all a surrealistic air, which is appropriate, and is sure to let us know that the dreadful behavior that was going on over two thousand years ago is still going on today.",1016409600,3,3010,4.617537313432836

1100651,4,6305963126,"It was with mixed feelings that I bought Titus without having first seen it...I would like to give my bit of commentary.
Overall, this is a very brave attempt at producing a play others would not dream of touching. It handles some of the parts previously thought to have been impossible to show without seeming ridiculous with admirable dexterity, and for the most part they work ( for instance, there's enough dismembering to rival The Texas Chainsaw Massacre). Some will find this production ""too much"" in its outlandish mixture of styles and times, and yet some of the scenes are simply breathtaking.
On the negative side, I personally don't think the casting is the best. Jessica Lange (Tamora) just doesn't do it for me and some of the others are one-dimensional. I could easily skip over some of the antics of Tamora's sons.
On the plus side, however, Harry Lennix (Aaron) the only survivor of the stage production from which this production originated, is excellent. He actually makes you reassess the accusation made at Shakespeare that his having the black man as the devil incarnate was just the typically racist action of white man playing to the crowd. After listening carefully to Lennix's deliverance of the ""...is black so base a hue?"" speech, you begin to suspect that Shakespeare had an ulterior motive for having such a strong black character in his play.
As for Hopkins, well, he's simply magnificent. This dvd is worth buying for the ""I'll tell my sorrow to the stones"" scene alone. Crucially, from my point of view, this production is faithful to the text.
On the whole, this is probably not for the casual movie watcher or the first film that should be watched by someone introducing themselves to the Shakespearean film library. But for any serious patron of Shakespeare it is a must; to see how it works, how it doesn't and most of all for Hopkins's spellbinding performance.

Titus is a combination of violence, sexuality and comedy and shows Shakespeare was well aware of the dramatic appeal of these features four hundred years before Tarantino ever dreamed up Reservoir Dogs.  Titus has all the early elements of Coriolanus and Richard the Third. A sense of a moral dilemma that is always with us; how do the good cope with the corruption of the powerful?  Titus the character moves convincingly from the authority of an Othello to the madness of Lear.  This is a fine production.  Well edited and directed without being pretentious.  It is successful because the issues the stage play raises are communicated well in film and the stylised dramatic features the director employs keep the production edgy, timeless and vivid.",1012521600,,968,5.173076923076923
1100705,5,6305963126,"This is the essence of Shakespeare stripped of soliloque and intellectual discourse. I do not believe this to be Shakespeare's worst play, on the contrary, this is one of his best, since it drives home the violence, the betrayal, the suffering and the consequences of the characters' actions that come from the business end of their motives. Unfortunately it takes graphic violence to bring it home, lest everyone dying on stage is an abstarct conclusion to two hours or so of tongue in cheek Shakespearean discourse.
Actually this is one of the more plausible plays that Shakespeare had written. Every action is probable in its historic content - from the capture of the Queen of the Goths to the sacrifice of one of her sons to her seduction of the Emperor to the eventual revenge and counter revenge. These events have happened historically, including the pivotal point where Titus abdicates his rule and suffers misfortune for it. Carry a mighty sword lest it be used on thee.
Anthony Hopkins is fundamentally Titus. He is a duty bound career military man who puts his loyalty to the Emperor above that of his family and because of that his family suffers. The cruelty of the Emnperor and the debauchery of the Princelings swallows his family and in this production there is no filter of the archaic speech to distance us from the impact. Contrary to Hopkins' other, on the basis of which he was chosen (his insanity as Hannibal Lector, his conventionalism as a Butler) in this role Hopkins actually endures adversity without going insane, though his optimism and composure make it seem the contrary.
The staging and the props, while anachronistic, are actually among one of the strengths of this film. It makes the imagery more vivid and truly adapts Shakespeare to cinema. The sets and actors are given contemporary look, and that removes the distance of time and period, making the actors our contemporaries, thus driving the violent action of the play home to the audience. The fact that the supporting characters are caricatures isolates the action further still and is quite effective, given the mass the negative reviews that the perceived violence of this film has generated. To those of you turned off by the violence film, I ask, are those other Shakespearean plays truly less violent or are you deluding yourself by getting lost in the Elizabethan language and long character speeches that separate instances of destruction?",1010188800,4,2439,4.965770171149145

Taymor's fantastic casting and direction shows through the dark story. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant at a very sultry and mysterious role. Jessica Lange is suprisingly brilliant for the dark and sexy role of Tamora. But appart from the obvious leads the real star of this film is the young actor who plays Young Lucius the hope of the whole film. Osheen Jones is incredle in this role the best acting i have ever seen from a child actor. He plays the role with sesitivity and strong emotion which creates a fantastic moving atmosphere to all his scenes. An all together brialliant film. You must see it.,1009497600,3,730,4.375
1100707,5,6305963126,"I myself have never been a big fan of Shakespeare. I find most of his work hard to follow and after having to read Romeo & Juliet so many times and watch almost all the videos adapted from it, I characterized all his works as horribly dull.
I soon stumbled upon Titus though, and it did look rather interesting. I read it was based on 'Titus Andronicus' another work by Shakespeare. So I read the work and found it very entertaining, so I decided to rent the DVD as well.
I watched it all the way through with my eyes glued to the screen, it was captivating. When I finished it, I wanted to watch it again. It was a powerful story made even more so with a amazing set and spectacular cast.
Anthony Hopkins portrays a perfect role of Titus. He is admirable in almost every movie he plays in, but in this role he was shocking. His descent into madness at the end was incredibly realistic. Jessica Lange did an equally amazing job herself, capturing the role of Tamora with stunning accuracy. Laura Fraser was the perfect women to play Lavinia, and I truly felt sympathy for her character in a way I never had when I had read the play. Alan Cumming in one of his better roles (I personally think) was the pompous and impressionable ruler Saturninus. He gives a lot of passion into the role and makes it incredibly convincing. Everyone else; the Rhys Brothers, James Frain, Angus MacFadyen, they all were equally talented and helped turn Shakespeare's ""worst play"" into a living work of art.
On the more negative side though, some of the images in this movie were rather disturbing and graphic, perhaps not for everyone. Also not everyone will find this movie entertaining, do to the fact of it's unique direction. Some will and have called it an 'artsy' film. Which I agree it definitely is. Not as odd as 'The Cell', but it's definitely a whole new look upon directing.",1006732800,3,1867,4.510324483775811

Yet, for all it's grandurer and stomping about, it manages to be honest and relevant, a commentary on modern society as well as the human condition.  Work like this can not be missed or ignored.
This DVD presentation also offers the best making of docmentary I've ever seen.  No, it doesnt focus on the amazing sets, exotic locations, SFX, or any other such extraenous material, but instead focuses almost entirely on the acting process.  We see the cast (wearing jeans and sweatpants), in rehearsals, discussing their characters, learning accents, picking apart the story and figuring out how best to translate it, blocking scenes and practicing fighting techniques.  It's an incredible glimpse into the creative process and goes to show how much was put into this film.  Having done much preforming myself, I found it to be most illuminating and refreshing to see such a focus on the most human aspect of creating a film.  I even find myself watching the documentary more than the film itself!",1005264000,,1159,5.031413612565445
1100709,4,6305963126,"Titus is one of the films I wanted to see for so long and have now gotten a chance. This was a very impressive film to me, but I was also a bit shocked and disturbed that this film had a lot of erie images.
The first scene that got to me the most is when Lavinia was taken away with Tamora's 2 sons. The twigs and the blood really made me feel extremely sorry for her. Also the violent feast fight (The Matrix style at the end of the film gave me a little giggle)
The Cast acted beautifully and flowed so well in the movie, which is why this film makes it what it is. Anthony Hopkins gives us some of Hannibal Lecter charateristics in this movie (mostly at the end). Jessica Lange is seductive and looks very raidiant as always.
The music fitted perfectly, the filmaking style of director Julie Taymor is excellent! I like the way she used tigers, lions, owls etc. in this film that gives us the feeling of rage, anger and terror in each charcter.
In all I thought this film should have been a bit more well know, so that everyone could have experienced such a strong movie and play from William Shakespear.",1004140800,,1107,4.251184834123222
1100710,4,6305963126,"I agree with the other reviewers who have pointed out that there are narrative creaks and groans inherent to Titus Andronicus, so enough said on that. The performances are fantastic, and the individual who plays the Moor is especially good -- his understated menace a welcome counter to Hopkin's bluster and rage (the banquet scene though is darkly hilarious). However, this is worth watching as much as anything for the film-making. The juxtaposition of classical Roman archictecture (at the Forum and the Palatine) with the Mussolini-era Fascist architecture of suburban Rome is fascinating, as is the use of vehicles and uniforms either directly connected to, or reminiscent of, fascist regimes in the 1930s. The use of color and space is fantastic. And, there are a variety of small details that add some humor when you catch them: the sons of Tamora play an Italian video game where one delivers pizza on a moped, and have a dartboard with Titus' picture on it; the radio microphones, in place of the old style ""RKO"" or ""BBC"" letters have ""SPQR"" -- for (if memory serves) ""Senatus Populi Quirites Romani.""

The DVD has allowed me to catch up on one of the most powerful interpretations of a Shakespeare play that I have ever seen (and having been raised within spitting distance of Stratford-Upon-Avon, I've seen a few in my time). This DVD edition is particularly worth getting for all the insightful extras that it contains. Julie Taymor is an articulate, passionate and, above all, incredibly coherent lady. I can't wait to see her take on the life of Frida Kahlo. The performances are astounding. Hopkins towers over the whole production but he finds his match in Jessica Lange's perfect Tamora (the American accent may grate on British ears at first but even that has its justification in Taymor's approach - and it works). Equal praise to Alan Cumming, Harry Lennix and the touching Laura Fraser. The artwork by the geniuses working at Cinecitt is worthy of the rest. It's tragic to think that few directors use these guys' talents anymore. ""Titus"" may shock some people with its violence but simply because it strikes closer to the bone than any Hollywood ""shoot 'em up"" spectacular.

In movies like this one, where the historical setting is
wrenched into some quasi 20th century setting, some things
work well and some things jar horribly and simply don't fit.
As an example of the former, I think the depiction of the
returning soldiers is masterful. Roman soldiers on motorbikes?
Well, it works for me.
As an example of the latter, Tamora's sons playing on their
arcade video games, this just seems contrived.
Killing the nurse with the pool cue on the other hand - that works.
So I suppose it is a tight line the director has to walk in an
adaptation like this and I think Ms Tamor acquits herself well.
Towering over this movie is Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Titus.

1100794,5,6305963126,"Beautifully symbolic and intricate scenery almost seems to interact with each individual character and all characters together as if it were a character in and of itself.
The movie chooses a deliberately slow pace to give the audience a chance to contemplate in depth the human aspects of revenge, wrong-doing, sin, grace, forgiveness, and the almost supernatural role of the tribune (for a few examples).
Jessical Lange (though she does suprisingly well) is probably the weakest actor.  Anthony Hopkins will make you weep with his ""When the Heavens Doth Weep"" and his pleading towards the stones.  Though he does fall into some rhthymic patterns of speech that will distract you with its resemblance to Dracula, overall his performance is stunning.  Harry Lennix is a perfect villian, never faltering in his role or using giggles and leers as a crutch.
There is a shocking amount of violence in this movie.  So please be warned.  P>Overall, this movie was excellent in scope and granduer.  It is a must see for all lovers of Shakespeare's work, this play must be one of his best and most thought-provoking.",999734400,,1107,4.989130434782608

The cinematography and character developement are excellent.  The vagueness and darkness of the script could have made a awful movie (and did- check out the original stab at this play titled Titus Andronicus), but the director and producer, in my opinion, did something marvelous with Titus.  They made it human.  Darkness, fear, death, and vengeance of the human soul are all exposed.  Not to mention one of the best orcheastrated soundtracks I can remember.  Rent it, then buy it.

Then I saw a special on Julie Taymore (egg or something like that on PBS at about 2 a.m...)  I couldn't have been more wrong.  She was perfect.  Visually, Titus is one of the most impressive movies I have EVER seen, and I have seen a lot of movies.  The costumes, the colors--everything--is without equal.

Rome or the Goths are irrelevant, Rome can be replaced with the U.S, or Izreal or anything. This was a quite powerful film incorporating a significant amount of symbolism.

Well I am most certainly glad I did. Julie Taymor's adaption of ""Titus Andronicus"" is a spectacle of theatrics, brilliant acting coupled with stunning photography and a deft amount of wit. A story of crime, punishment, and most importantly, revenge, the play is generally considered the least of Shakespeare's works (although I'd take it over one of his banal comedies any day) but it stands as one of the strongest film adaptions of the Bard's work I have seen. Hopkins plays the title role with all the elgance we've come to expect from one of our greatest living actors, but it's clearly an ensemble. Every actor here gets his or her moment to shine, including a surprisingly strong Jessica Lange and the scene-stealing Henry Lennix. His performance is brilliant as the embodiment of evil in that he doesn't sneer and brood and cackle with devilish laughter but rather delivers his lines with eloquence-he's charming,intelligent and TOTALLY unrepentant. Some contrivances in the plot do occasionally hinder the screenplay, as do some of the anachorisms; at times they're brilliantly symbolic and at other moments just distracting. But it all adds up to a very powerful film that is  TRUE tragedy in the sense that there is no moral to the story.

I am not a Shakespeare purist in any way: I relish the chance to see quality works of time tested merit brought to life through NEW and intriguing stagings.  But Titus is an incomprehensible mound of garbage piled upong the grave of Shakespeare himself.  The sets are unforgivable.  Unbeleivably plastic, lit with the bulbs of discarded kiddle lamps.  The art direction is altogether heinous, with its anachronistic microphones and automobiles.  None of which have any meaning to the actual story other than ""Hey look at me I'm a director and I made these wild and quirky choices that you are going to notice!!!""  Still, these are not the fulcrum point of all that makes this movie bad.  The most unforgivable crime is that the characters are made to stand as mere shadows of characters.  When  Titus makes a choice, you might want to suppose that perhaps he is making this bad choice for a reason.  But Ms Taymor decides instead to forego any semblance of character development or motivation.  instead she portrays him as a buffoon, doing this and that for no reason.  (When of course you know he's doing it for Rome)  And the same goes for Saturnine.  We see him, through Taymor's eyes as a ohhhh dare I say it ""Bad Man"" and everything he does is so ONE dimensional.  When truly, there should be more levels of treachery behind his face.  ENOUGH.

Anthony Hopkins is brilliant in the title role, and Jessica Lange (whom I ordinarily find fairly insipid) is brilliant as Tamara, Queen of Goths.  The take on the play is very interesting ... the opening scene has a young boy in modern times playing with toy soldiers and eventually having a huge war in the midst of the kitchen table.  Suddenly, a warrior on horseback breaks through the wall and takes the lad to a coliseum of sorts, where Titus and his troops are returning from war.  The troops move as though their feet were rooted in place -- not unlike the way little boys move their green plastic army men from foot to foot.  The boy, still in modern dress, is an observer through most of the play; this juxtaposition very clearly sends the message that war is not a game.

Others have mentioned the inspired mixture of imagery from different eras, and the inspired acting by the entire cast, and I agree.  Anthony Hopkins once again reminded us why he is held in such high esteem by his peers.  Laura Fraser was truly heartbreaking as Lavinia.  Jessica Lange was brilliant as the Goth Queen/Empress.  And, while I don't recall the actor's name, the man who played the Moor did so perfectly.  The rest of the cast performed in a similarly admirable manner.

I consider this movie to be an instant classic, and I highly recommend this to anybody who is interested in great cinema.

I first saw the preview for Titus on the Fight Club VHS I rented a bazillion times. I rented Titus the day it came out on video and loved it from start to finish. There are only a few small complaints. One, the very beginning, and the very end are VERY confusing. Taymor should've given up on the whole WW2/child's nightmare schtick. The only other complaint is that the technology mixing is very distracting. On to the good parts. Hopkins does a terrific Titus, though the final scenes of the movie make  me think silence of the lambs. Lange plays a cunning and evil Tamora. Alan Cummings does Saturnine as a flashy, decadent emperor. The Rhys brothers performed well in their roles as Chiron and Demetrius. The shining star of the movie (or shall we say diamond in the rough) is Harry Lennix as Aaron the Moor. Aaron is considered to be the prototype for The Bard's later villian, Iago. Lennix gives Kenneth Branagh a run for his money in the villian department. Lennix plays the twisted Moor to the hilt. I wholeheartedly reccomend this movie.",993254400,2,1239,4.736111111111111

You realize this isn't going to be a standard Shakespeare adaptation when only 15 minutes into the film, you see a modern boy messing up his whole dinner table and action figures with ketchup, male full frontal nuditity, and someone's guts sizzling in a sacrificial flame.  Surprisingly, Julie Taymore's adaptation doesn't stray too far from the original Shakespeare tragedy, 'Titus Andronicus' although it may seem like that because it's so damn entertaining.  What brings Titus truly alive and makes it comprehendable from a modern standpoint is that each scene contains elements from separate time periods- architecture, cars, and guns from Fascist Europe; pool tables, arcade games, and heavy metal from the MTV age, swing music and Chaplin-ey dark makeup from the roaring 20's, and old, clanky military costumes from ancient Rome, the time period in which the original play was set.  Titus follows an ensemble cast, Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Laura Fraser, Angus McFayden, Colm Feore, Alan Cumming, Jonathon Rhys-Meyers, and the standout Harry Lennix through a cold and bloody revenge spree started when Roman general, Titus (Hopkins) returns from war and sacrifices Gothic Queen Tamora's (Lange) eldest son for religious purposes.  Soon after, Tamora vows revenge and marries the bufoonish emperor Saturnius (Cumming), sends her two obnoxious sons off to brutally rape and mutilate Titus's virginal daughter Lavinia (Fraser- in what's sure to be one of the most harrowing scenes in film history) and has Titus cut off his own right hand in vain.  Everything about this is horrible.  But it's directed with such a furious zeal for the material that each scene plays like Scream- in poetry.  Indeed Titus is much closer to a modern horror movie than any Shakespeare adaptation in sight.  And believe it or not there is a message behind Titus.  A message that speaks volumes about violence, and directly reflects back on our culture.  The way violence can either be passed on generation through generation.  The way cruelty backfires.  And the constant reprucussions because of one violent, maybe even righteous act.  If Taymore supplies the entertainment, Shakespeare supplies the meaning.",992822400,29,2261,5.350282485875706
1100867,5,6305963126,"Julie Taymor has hit the ground running with this her first ambitious effort as a film director. In spite of some minor flaws, this ecclectic film based on the most popular play of Shakespeare's lifetime is a modern masterpiece. Taymor has found the thread that connects the grand guignol, blood and guts revenge tragedy of Titus Andronicus with our modern global decadence. Freely mixing images of modern Europe with Ancient Rome, Taymor reminds us that we may have far too much in common with the corrupt and amoral society presented in Shakespeare's first revenge tragedy.
Added to the visual beauty and intense imagery of Ms. Taymor's eye are a number of outstanding and outlandish performances. Anthony Hopkins is riveting in the title role. His quick descent into villany shows the true mark of most revenge tragedy heroes (Hamlet excepted). Jessica Lange rises nobly to the occasion in a role that is both exciting and challenging. If in an isolated moment or two she seems overwhelmed, the moment is short-lived as she both attracts and repels us as the evil antagonist, Tamora, Queen of the Amazons.

For her first film she chose Titus Andronicus, Shakespeare's most violent and under valued play. Shakespare's dialogue in this film is the least complex of all his works and that makes this film a hell of alot more cohesive and fun to watch. The visuals are amazing from Lange in her corn rowed hair with touches of gold to Cumming's blood red cloak. Taymor mixes modern images and technology such as tv's and motor cycles with the setting in ancient Rome and for some unexplainable reason it works never once do you question it. Sheh gives cultural nods to such film classics as Westside Story to Gone With The Wind. But the film isn't all about looks the story has substance since  it's based on revenge for ones family and respect for ones power we all can relate and the acting by all invloved is breathtaking most noteably Laura Fraser as Lavinia. What is done to her in this film will stand out from all the other acts and it will leave ice on your heart-the act is that cold and callous!

1100869,3,6305963126,"Some minor spoilers ahead!
I have to say that I used to hate this film. However, after being introduced to some studies on post-modernism, this film suddenly came back to my mind because it brings onto screen a fairly important aspect of post-modernistic style: the ""retro-fashion"" (thanks to my prof), that is, the deviation from historical accuracy and confounding mixture of various periods of the past (and the present as well, I think)... The ""stages"" of history are broken and everything gets mixed up into this incoherent concoction of noise and gore and vibrant colors.
""Titus"" is innovative and reflects a daring director's hard work. The film appears to bear many of the popular attributes of modern cinema, namely scenes with people getting whacked and hearts with burning desire of vengence. To fully appreciate the experience one probably has to read the play first, because the first time I watched it I only knew that Titus was a violent literary experiment by the early and inexperienced bard. Consequently,as I have said earlier, I developed this abhorrence of this heap of nonsense. Now I still have not read the play but I have the feeling (through my customary assumption) that the film is quite faithful (in the sense of actors reciting the text) to the play, if one can pardon the noise.
If you are looking for demonstrations of violence and audacity, you would probably find only a few satisfying segments in this film. (I was disappointed) ""Titus"" is worth checking out for once, just to see how the filmmakers can accomplish with such a low budget, and above all, get a visualization of the result of eliminating the boundaries of culture and historical periods.",991094400,,1687,4.943661971830986
1100870,5,6305963126,"i can't say enough good things about this movie. julie taymor truly deserved an oscar for the directing. the sets and costumes were just breathtaking. the acting was second to none. and of course it's shakespeare so you can't go wrong with a twisted, engrossing plot and a shocking end. it IS a tradgety tho: there is a lot of violence and death, so this may not be one for kids. the movie plays out in a mix of eras- ancient rome, 16th century england, the romance of the 1940s, with modern and futuristic fashions. this is a feast for the eyes, ears, and emotions. don't pass this movie up!!",991094400,,593,4.4
1100871,5,6305963126,"This production is ""off the charts"" in most every category! Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lainge (among others) are giving career performances here. The production is VERY lavish - and yet not at all over-done. Upon viewing this film I re-read the play to see how faithful the movie was - and I was astonished to realize that the film did not substantively add anything to the play. This film successfully undermines the conventional wisdom that ""Titus Andronicus"" is a ""dismissible"" play. The film is one of the most powerful productions one will ever find and is a true work of genius!",991094400,,582,4.83
1100900,4,6305963126,"First off, I'll cover other reviews.  Any scholar who says this play is badly written simply doesn't have the capacity for a well laid-out story.  It is a thought provoking script by a brilliant man.
Second, the director has problems of her own.  The opening scene with the young child is an obvious political statement that should have just been avoided.  Also, the actors and actresses had a better understanding of the script than the director.  Anthony Hopkins does a brilliant job except for about three or four times when you can see the directors influence through literal translations of the text.
Third, the past, present, and future settings all at once create a surreal, timeless atmosphere that ANYONE should be able to understand.
Finally, although I don't agree with the casting choice of Saturnine, the rest of the actors and actresses are VERY talented and should be commended on their understanding of the script.
BOTTOM LINE:  A well written script acted out by very talented people, but directed by a liberal who had little understanding of the text.  A great film with minor issues that has become one of my favorites.",991008000,,1138,4.895833333333333
1100901,5,6305963126,"Julie Taymor's lavish arthouse film ""Titus,"" based on one of Shakespeare's least-known plays, ""Titus Andronicus,"" is a uniqe chimera of beauty, elegance, and social responsibility.  Titus Andronicus, Shakespeare's first work not to draw directly on historical fact, lacks the depth of its immediate predecessor play, Richard III, instead succumbing to horrific violence and action without much of a point.  This is probably why it hasn't been preformed or studied greatly, as it was clearly intended for a ""groundling"" audience, specifically to make money.  The fact that it was the Bard's first true commercial success in his time attests to this fact, and the parallels between the sacrifice of content for the ""bread and circuses"" violence that people craved and modern, ""braindead"" action films today should be obvious.
Instead of turning her back on the work, Taymor openly embraced the violent nature of the play, but instead of making a blood-splattered production, she turned it into a powerful metaphor for the levels of violence and sexuality in our culture - and the lack of responsibility we take with such things.
The movie opens not in the past, but in the present - a young boy is playing ""war"" in his kitchen, and robots and toy soldiers explode around him and die.  As a tank breaks down his wall, we are left unsure as to exactly what is fantasy and reality anymore - another brilliant take on the cause of violent actions, especially high-profile cases of violence by children, like the Columbine massacre.
The boy then enters the world of the play, where ancient Rome and modern times freely intermingle (and, despite my misgivings before seeing the film, this production choice does not detract at all from what happens onscreen).  Titus (Anthony Hopkins, in the role that brought him out of his semi-retirement) and his soldiers - covered either with the grime of battle or a kind of caked-on, archaeological dirt, as if they were excavated from the ground, march into Rome, almost like the automatons the boy was playing with moments before.  We learn they have just concluded a successful campaign against the Goths, and sacrifice one of the sons of the Goth's queen, Tamara (played to a ""t"" by Jessica Lange) as thanks.  Tamara vows revenge, ends up supporting an upstart punk politician who takes over as emperor and sets out to destroy Titus' life.
This play has it all - disembowlments, rape, dismemberment, mutilation, insanity, political backstabbing, and sexual orgies.  Through it all, the boy watches goggle-eyed and slackjawed, and becomes a kind of moral focal point for everything that happens around him - the lessons he ""learns"" (or rejects) in a strange fantasy world.
In a time when the lines between fantasy and reality become blurred, Taymor's Titus takes an uncompromising look at saturation of violence in our lives, and in the lives of our children.  Because of this, it manages to take one of Shakespeare's worst works, an almost-parody of the levels of violence and action people so desperately seem to need, and makes it an incredibly moral story.
The Special Edition DVD is a two-disc set, the first disc featuring the film in glorious 5.1 surround, with some subtitle options and an interesting commentary track.  The transfer is great, as should be expected from Fox, and the sound is crystal-clear.  The second disc contains most of the special features, among which is an interview Julie Taymor gives at Columbia University.
As an arthouse play, and one that requires a good deal of thinking, Titus obviously isn't for everyone, but if you've studied Shakespeare, enjoy Shakespeare, or are interested in what an artistic director can achieve with some pretty crummy source material, be sure and check it out.  You might want to consider renting it before you buy it, but try to stick with the widescreen version - the pan-n-scan doesn't do the beautiful cinematography justice.",990748800,3,3930,5.038520801232665
1100902,4,6305963126,"The key to Julie Taymor's amazing film ""Titus"" is that it's the play as imagined by a child--in this case Titus' young grandson. It is made pretty clear that it's his point of view that we're seeing, which accounts for the fantastic, surreal atmosphere. It's like when you were a kid reading a book that was perhaps a little too mature for you--you don't quite understand it all, but you are drawn in by the story and try to picture it on the terms you are familiar with. Here the grandson is obviously jaded by media overload, (video games and cable TV,) and he is turned on by the mayhem. But he soon learns the difference between play violence and the hideous things he witnesses. Does he really learn, or does he become as corrupted as his surroundings? Taymor keeps you guessing. Once again Jessica Lange proves she is the scariest woman in the movies. And Anthony Hopkins is a stoic Titus who descends into a special kind of madness--and yes, there is more than a hint of Hannibal Lecter in his performance, which may be the reason why this wild film got financing (there's an hommage on ""Titus"" at the end of the film version of ""Hannibal. Check out how the good doctor escapes from his handcuffs.) It's a throwback to a braver time in filmmaking, when chance-taking dinosaurs like Ken Russell roamed the earth. It makes me laugh that this was directed by Taymor, who conceived Disney's family-friendly ""Lion King"" for Broadway. This is not Will S.'s best play of course; it's like a first draft of characters and themes that would later show up In ""Lear"", ""Othello"", and ""Merchant of Venice."" But this movie has the poetry, and it's a bloody good show.",990403200,,1660,4.611486486486487
1100903,3,6305963126,"I studied ""Titus"" in college as part of a Shakespeare Tragedy course, and our professor actually was mocking some of the scenes for the overblown violence and gore. By modern standards, the story is not one of the Bard's best works, nor best known. However, over the years, I have seen some very well-done productions both on public television and onstage. So, I was anxious to see what the film version would be like. While I appreciate Julie Taymor's rather 'artsy' take on the story, the most powerful scenes are those that are played straight without all the anachronistic elements and overblown costumes and sets.  Jessica Lange and Anthony Hopkins are perfectly cast, and give great performances. The final 'banquet' scene with the pie still has a grotesque element of humor (onstage the same scene had the audience laughing out loud). Also, getting inside of Titus' madness came across better in film - particularly his encounter with ""Revenge"" (although this scene still plays rather silly no matter how it is staged). Overall, 'Titus' could have been better, but it is worth a look. Not for all tastes.",989366400,4,1111,4.9411764705882355
1100904,5,6305963126,"Julie Taymor's interpretation of the play Titus was not what I was expecting.  From the opening all the way to the ending this film never ceased to shock and amaze me.  It took several viewings to take it all in.  This tragic story follows the descent of a Roman General (Titus) at the deceitfulness of the Queen of the Goths (Tamora) and Aaron the Moor.  The performances in this are quite exceptional.  Anthony Hopkins is extraordinarily powerful in his role as Titus.  Jessica Lange shocked me at how well she can perform Shakespeare.  And Harry Lennix stole every seen he was in as the ruthless and truly evil Aaron the Moor.  This film however is not for everyone, so buy with caution.
The DVD itself is quite impressive.  The video is simply put very good with only a few artifacts here and there.  The sound is equally impressive with Elliot Goldenthal's impressive score coming through all channels.  The special features are quite extensive also.  There are two audio commentaries one with Julie Taymor and the other with Anthony Hopkins and Harry Lennix.  Also included is an Isolated Score with comments by the composer.  Worthwhile mention must go to Fox for including the two extensive documentaries.  The Q & A session with Julie Taymor at the university was fascinating and gave a real insight into filmmaking.  Also the ""Making Of"" Documentary provided an interesting look into how the film was made (especially interesting was the rehearsal process).
Fox has given the DVD public a great 2 Disc Set.  The movie deserves to be experienced by as many people as possible as it a gripping adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most controversial plays.",988848000,,1662,4.857651245551601
1100905,5,6305963126,"Julie Taymor sure doesn't shy away from creepy imagery.  While the Shakespeare play, Titus Andronicus is already quite fascinating with one of the most hilarious scenes written in at the end - Taymor makes this film an experience you will NOT forget.  If you don't like clear haunting imagery, keep your eyes squinted so you can close them when you need to!  Jessica Lange is BRILLIANT...my god is this woman brilliant.  Anthony Hopkins has only been better than this in the original Silence of the Lambs.  He's a riot.  And Alan Cumming is...well, if you know who Alan Cumming is...you know exactly what I'm talking about.  The director and art design really deserve the big cake on this one...the movie is beautiful.

1100906,1,6305963126,"The critics said that Titus is the worst play of Shakespeare, although I may not fully agree... but difinitly this movie is the worst of Anthony Hopkins.
The movie should have not been placed in the current century, this has killed the movie and made it senseless!

1100907,4,6305963126,"To show Shakespeare and not to repeat someone's job already is a hard task. Ms Julie Tamor dared to present us with her own version of this tragedy, very original and visually daring and sophisticated, where modern meets pagan. There are plot holes and illogical action in the movie, but it's the usual Shakespeare style, and good that Ms Taymor has not changed anything in the plot. After 15 minutes of Romans driving motorcycles, playing pool or wearing quasy-Nazi uniform seem to be as integral part of the movie as their Roman names or gear.  The costumes, decorations and general artful design of the movie are worth alone to watch. All in all, it's a play on a stage, so allow the Director's fantasy roam as she wishes.
About plot: we forget that Shakespeare has been not only a genius who created Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet, but could also try his pen with such tragedy as Titus. All his ""trademarks"" are here: a noble and popular Roman general (A Hopkins) who spent 40 years fighting for the glory of Rome, return, having captured Goth queen Tamora (J Lange) and her sons 3 sons (ugh, what brats!). He misplaces his loyalty with the new Caesar just for a moment. And as usual, while he realizes he's been betrayed and used, several close to him have suffered horribly already. In the beginning, Titus himself is hard to root for - he's ruthless (sacrifices Tamora's eldest without mercy), stubborn and tyrannical father. But after he suffers blow after blow when vengeful Tamora becomes the wife of new Caesar, he can only laugh for no more tears are left to cry over his losses. Tamora and her lover Aaron, are proverbial villains to the last cell in their bodies: bloodthirsty, merciless, depraved. Both Tamora and Titus become similarly atrocious in their all-consuming revenge, and as a result, it annihilates them both and about a dozen of other characters.
Violence of the movie is not that arresting (besides the last 20 minutes of the movie, when A Hopkins really goes over the top, and that makes you cringe an spit): almost all killings, rape and mutilations happen off the screen and viewers are presented with results and surrealistic visions in the minds of the suffering.
If Ms Taymor presented us with the usual toga-wrapped version of this tragedy, it would have been another boring and moralizing spectacle. Due to its originality and strong images the movie is a challenge to watch till the end, and requires strong stomach. It also proves that whatever we can come forth with, the Great Bard has already ""been there, done that"". And A Hopkins should earn credits for posterity by such roles as Titus, not men-eating Hannibal.",987465600,,2653,4.77995642701525
1100908,4,6305963126,"Some reviewers commented that Titus Andronicus is considered one of the worst of Shakespeare's plays, but not all students of Shakespeare believe that. I teach a course in Shakespearean Literature, and I taught Titus long before the movie came out. I was thrilled when the movie was released, with the modern look making it more tangible to many of my students. It mantains integrity with the artistic look while providing elements high schoolers (and others) can relate too. While the play itself tends to be uneven in spots, the movie polished away many of the rough edges. People need to remember that Titus Andronicus is considered by many historians to be Shakespeare's first tragedy, so it's certainly not his best work, but the movie still transforms it into a disturbing and entralling film.",986947200,3,799,5.015037593984962
1100909,4,6305963126,"During Shakespeare's prime time, TITUS ANDRONICUS was the most popular of all his plays. The audiences ate this work up. However, as time went on the play was produced less and less and in the past hundred years has only been performed about a dozen times worldwide. Many critics argue that it is Shakespeare's worst play, some claiming that it's so bad Shakespeare probably didn't even write it.

Granted this is one of the most violent of all Shakespeare's plays. Granted the dialogue isn't as impressive as HAMLET or KING LEAR. Granted there isn't as much psychological investigation into ones soul (e.g. HAMLET). Nevertheless, TITUS ANDRONICUS is a better play than many would lead you to believe. It's a play that looks at human nature in its most base and primal form, yet still raises some big questions: What is the worth of ones' family? , What happens to a nation when it ignores its veterans?, What happens to ones soul when one gives oneself over to power and decadence? These (and many more) are serious issues that the play raises and examines.

With that said about the play, TITUS the movie is stunning. The visuals, costumes, and choreography in the movie are just amazing. The movie stays true to the plot of the play and much of the dialogue is left intact. The combination of various twentith century designs with those of ancient Rome results in the most interesting visuals of any film in recent memory. The acting in the movie is superb and the direction almost flawless. The only negative criticism is that the film moves rather slowly, rushing from crucial scene to the next, but dragging in between those scenes. Overall a great adaptation of Shakespeare's most campiest play.",986774400,,1702,4.825342465753424
1100958,5,6305963126,"It's unfortuanate that this film didn't garner more recognition. This may be due in part to the fact that the original play was considered to be sub-par; perhaps it was, but this hardly detracts from the film.
The first thing one notes upon viewing are the stunning visuals- modern things like arcade machines and automobiles are put alongside older, archaic things (such as wardrobe and old English speech). This has been done in previos adaptations of Shakespear's work, but never to such dramatic effect.
Another thing that stands out is the unending violence. It really never lets up. Director Julie Taymor thought this went perfectly with the crisis of our modern times- an era accustomed to things like war, genocide and urban decay. This film makes a statement about our society.
The acting is certainly first rate, with Hopkins in the title role. The other actors are all on par with his stunning performance- it never comes across as scripted or contrived.
The underlying current of the film is about man's own inclination toward cruelty, and what some will do to seek revenge. In this film, it creats a domino effect, one revenge traded for another until no one is left standing.
Stunning visuals, stunning performances, superlative film. I feel it's one of the best in the last five years. In fact, after one viewing on HBO, I came to this website and bought my own copy.

1100959,5,6305963126,"I bought this movie with no pretense, it was inexpensive and looked pretty interesting. After seeing it I can say I thoroughly enjoyed it which is saying something because I don't like movies where the dialogue makes me think ""what language are they speaking?"" Oh that's English, ok, maybe I missed a few English classes in high school. First of all this movie rocks. The story is very interesting(see editors insights) but the highlight of this movie are the set designs and the costumes. The mixture of modern and ancient clothes, styles and sets is genius, contemporary interpretations that stimulate even those who are not, dare I say, into Shakespeare. This movie allows young people, who are forced to try and understand the antiquated language of Shakespeare something visual that captures the imagination, brings questions to mind, allows for insight to be given by the Shakespeare ""experts"" in the group, and quite possibly a better understanding of what all the big deal is about some dead guy who wrote plays. I watched this with my teenage boys who were mesmerized by it and wanted to know more about the story. Judging from the reviews written here, you either love it or hate. I loved it because it was a brilliant adaptation, innovative, visually stunning and well acted by standouts Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange. It is a schocking and odd mixture of literary art brought to the screen for a most memorable viewing experience. This film by Julie Taymor depicts Rome yesterday with today in such a manner that it is absolutely stunning, visually haunting, even horrific at times, but always masterfully entertaining. This is a movie well worth the money as it can and should be viewed numerous times. If you like something out of the ordinary this movie is for you, if you're a Shakespeare purist maybe not, but regardless this movie is an epic bargain.",986256000,2,1872,4.889937106918239
1100960,2,6305963126,"Sorry, but Shakeshere proved with this play that even the best authors will write a bomb once in a while.  This play is simply not very good.  The only thing that the iambic pentameter does in this play is make the gory, ugly, and senseless play less comprehensible, which with this story is a good thing.  Of all of the great plays that the greatest English writer ever, wrote, why this one was made into a movie baffles me.
  My best guess to this, is that the director was just looking for a backdrop to show off the well done visuals and cosutume and set design, that this movie is full of.  The problem is that even though they are individualy well done, they just do not go together that well, and makes an aready bad story more muddled and depressing than before.  It is nice that these sceanes can be made, now this director should go and make them in a movie that can use them.
  Titus is a not so tragic, tragic hero who gets himself into trouble through his own stupidity, mindless cruelty, and strict adherance to tradition.  The only character in this play that is interesting at all is the smart villian, who acts like Iago and looks like Othello.  The plotting and character devolopment are not very good, and sorry but Shakesphere needed some prozac really badly around the time he wrote this play.  Many people seem to really like this movis as a kind of modern art.  But sorry this is the kind of art I feel that I am better off not seeing.",985564800,3,1458,4.355555555555555

The blending of Ancient Rome and the modern world in the set and the costumes is surprisingly effective -- Roman armour and weapons fit in perfectly beside cars, microphones and other modern props.  The on-again, off-again ""play within a play"" idea was annoying and never really went anywhere, but it wasn't shoved in the viewer's face too much.
Beautiful as it is, the film is a disturbing parade of violence and cruelty that makes most horror films look tame by comparison.  In this, it is true to the play on which it was based, and the Shakespearean dialogue actually lends a certain creepy respectability to what would otherwise be a spectacle of depravity.",985392000,3,813,4.83453237410072

The play Titus is completely over the top, so this film goes way over the top too, but it's appropriate and thrilling to watch. Lange, Hopkins and the Moore are all played brilliantly. It's a long film but not one that you end up resenting for keeping you occupied so long. Titus' daughter was also excellent. I found myself wondering how much this film cost to make, it appeared to be very extravagent. A very impressive adaptation.

1100963,5,6305963126,"Sometimes I really like Shakespeare and at other times I am all too happy to give his plays a pass.  I certainly wasn't eager to see what has always been regarded as his bloodiest and worst play,""Titus,"" despite the awesome acting abilities of Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange. What I was totally unprepared for was the writer-director's surmounting all obstacles by mounting the most artistic adaptation of this or any other Shakespeare play.  I thought I had already seen it this past summer in ""Hamlet 2000"" with Ethan Hawke in the title role.  ""Titus"" goes even beyond that splendid production. The film has one of the strongest, most well choreographed openings I've ever seen.  And it never lets up from there.

The essential plot is that when Titus murders the Queen of the Goth's (Lange's) son, she spends the rest of the play wrecking vengenance on him and his when shortly thereafter she marries the young emperor and power comes into her hands.  The visual effects are simply astonishing and Shakespeare would be delighted beyond compare if he could but see it himself today. These are the most artistically rendered visuals I've seen in a film since ""Prospero's Books,"" which wasn't as good a film but had stunning visual artistry.  This should have won all the Oscars, without question.

1100964,5,6305963126,"What a feat Julie Taymor has performed: she, a first-time film director, has taken one of Shakespeare's most garish and lambasted plays and turned it into a work of cinematic art. The original material was brash and barbaric, and Taymor chose to embrace this and in doing so gave its brutality a strange sort of audacious beauty. The film comes at you with its teeth out and keeps a firm lock on the throat until the cataclysmic final dinner, at which point it's hard to know exactly how to react. The stunning sets, costumes, and a beautiful and eclectic score by Elliot Goldenthal place the story in a bizarre alternate universe which combines ancient Rome with Mussolini-era Italy and some sort of aggro-punk future, where mud-caked soldiers still wear armor and carry swords but also drive tanks and motorcycles.
The performances from the large cast are uniformly spot-on. Anthony Hopkins in the title role is his usual grand and charismatic self and particularly fun as Titus slides into a sort of calculating madness. Jessica Lange is perfect as the fiendishly vengeful Tamora, Alan Cumming is wonderfully near hysteria and just campy enough as Saturnine, and there are still Laura Fraser, Colm Feore, Osheen Jones...I could go on. The biggest standout, certainly in part because he has such a great character to play, is Harry Lennix as Aaron the Moor, a fabulously Machiavellian villain as charming as he is despicable.
Indeed it is a movie full of those old stand-bys sex and violence, but the treatment the material is given rises above the bloodbath. If you can stomach it, Titus is more than worth seeing.",984096000,,1617,4.905109489051095
1100965,5,6305963126,"This movie, quite simply put, is stunning. Titus is decidedly not the greatest play that Shakespeare ever wrote but now after watching this adaptation I'd say it's probably the most underrated of his works and with help of Julie Taymor has the potential to be the most memorable.
After watching it last night, I had nightmares. The violence, on the first viewing at least, defies the boundaries of human imagination - I plan to watch it again, trying to concentrate more on the story and the scene-by-scene commentary given by Anthony Hopkins. And yet for all the gore that is served up in this dish, it is surprisingly beautiful. This is, after all, a tale of revenge and mayhem.
Anthony Hopkins as Titus, a celebrated Roman general, makes this slightly long movie well worth watching through to the end. Supporting cast is also astounding - Laura Frazer as Lavinia will haunt me for some time to come, I still shudder when I think about her performance and her character's cruel fate. Jessica Lange as Queen of Goths has a difficult task but she performs admirably. Her goal is making Titus' life a living hell after she becomes a wife of a new airhead emperor. Pay more attention also to the black slave who serves her, perhaps the real villain of the play (there is no shortage of those, although some are just pawns). Together, they succeed admirably but Titus gets a chance to revenge his family once again. The last banquette reminded me of Hopkins' role in The Silence of the Lambs.
Excellent things about the movie besides the stunning visuals and patience in unraveling the story while keeping the brisk pace are: music is great, great, great and the costumes and architecture that get a modernized texture. Something that I would vote for excising out of the movie are the dreamy parts in which Titus has visions of angels and scapegoats. Because the entire movie is so lucid in its unapologetic darkness, they just break the atmosphere.
But the part in which Titus lies on the stones while the faceless crowd moves around him on their way to watch the deaths of his unjustly punished sons, screaming to anyone who'd listen about mercy, is perhaps the most telling of all. There is little forgiveness to be shared between the participants of this play, and in the times when mercy is begged for, the ears on which the pleas fall are always deaf. Including those of Titus.
Buy it, rent it, run to see it, in other words. This is one of the best movies - and DVDs - to come in years.",983404800,12,2492,4.6275395033860045

If revenge and heartbreak are your cup of tea sit down and enjoy the over two hours of cinema at its best.

1101028,1,6305963126,this was the most boring movie I have seen for a LONG time. The quintessential 'arty' movie that critics praise because they don't understand it. just awful,980985600,8,156,4.814814814814815
1101029,5,6305963126,"I'd like to join the growing chorus of reviewers who confesses to being distracted and somewhat annoyed by the continual ""modernization"" of the bard.  Its now officially a cliche in Shakespeare film adaptations, and even in modern-day theater groups - albeit one that can be used very effectively (_Richard III_, or Branagh's _Hamlet_) or overused poorly (_Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet_).  Here we have a bizarre mix of what is probably fascist-era WWII Italy pureed with classic Roman Architecture, cars, radios, and video games.  Compounding the confusion, we have an innocent and bewildered child, presumably the director's metaphor for our own innocence.  The child mostly acts lost in the continual carnage and bloodbath around him.  These are pretentious distractions and can be set aside for the good things director Julie Taymor does for Titus.  She's not a blatant postmodernist as another critic here described her as, scribbling graffiti all over the hallowed halls of the bard's home; don't be fooled into thinking this is another _Romeo and Juliet_ debacle.  Her use of color and texture is striking, and she puts some images on the screen that are at times hilarious - sometimes offensive - and oftentimes truly terrifying and on par with the subject matter at hand.  You'll never be bored by her vision, that's for certain.
The other aspect of _Titus_ I credit the critic Roger Ebert for originally examining in his review, is the racial struggles of the character Aron the moor.  Harry Lennix gives just a touch of tenderness and humanity to the seemingly boundless evil plotting of Aron by daring to spare his own child, borne of illicit interracial philandering with Tamora and otherwise doomed to sure death at the hands of an enraged Saturnius.  Othello was also a moor, but he was essentially a man dealing with more basic emotions of jealousy and betrayal - not in the context of someone who is discriminated against because of race.  The racial struggles of Aron are truly universal and strikingly modern themes, and seem to be central to his bitterness and hatred for the world about him.  Im not sure if Taymor played the child subplot up more for the film, but even the cursory and tender examination of such themes makes Aron one of the more fascinating and complex of the Shakespeare villains and truly brings home the universality of the Bard's examinations of human interactions.  Lennix gives a brilliant performance, and Aron's final speech, which moves from racial and fatherly empathy to perverse evil, is one of the most riveting scenes of the entire film.
It must be noted there's not a single bad apple of any of the other actors in this movie.  Kenneth Branagh, the modern ""king"" of Shakespeare movie adaptations, has miscast several of his movies with bad supporting actors (Keanu Reeves springs to mind) but here nearly every performance is standout: the aforementioned Lennix; Alan Cummings as the shady Saturninus; Jessica Lange is quite a surprise as the sexy yet ruthless queen Tamora.  And Hopkins is a revelation as a nuanced, distant Titus.  You can see the apathy grow in him as his family is beset by tragedy after tragedy - approaching his ultimate distance from his final bloody revenge.
Titus is a bloody, overplotted mess of a play, and it does not have the graceful dialogue that his later plays did.  Nevertheless, the actors and the director's bold collective vision breathe new life into what could have ended up as simply another ""Caligula"".",980208000,,3502,4.979416809605489
1101030,5,6305963126,"Titus blew me away.

1101031,3,6305963126,"""Titus"" is an undoubtedly beautiful, innovative film, yet about halfway through, I could not help but wishing I was Bassianus (James Frain), who gets offed about 45 minutes in and doesn't have to endure any more of this film.  To be sure, the acting is commendable.  The actors display full commitment to their roles. Alan Cumming (Saturninus) and Jessica Lange (Tamora) give compelling performances and nuanced, intriguing interpretations of the text.  Matthew Rhys and Jonathan Rhys Meyers are revelations as Tamora's punk sons, and Anthony Hopkins creates a very human, complicated character.  Yet this is not enough to make ""Titus"" a truly great film.
The director usually must bear the blame when a production goes south, but the fault does not lie entirely with Julie Taymor.  The mastermind behind such dazzling stage spectacles as ""Juan Darien: A Funeral Mask"" and ""The Lion King"" creates a brilliant view of Rome that is at once ancient, postmodern, and futuristic, drawing parallels between the Rome of the Caesars and the Italy of the Fascists.
All this makes for interesting filmmaking, but it does not place ""Titus"" in the pantheon of exceptional films, because it cannot cover up the central problem with ""Titus"": the play itself.  ""Titus Andronicus"", like many great playwrights' first works, displays hints of Shakespeare's nascent genius at work, but the work is not genius itself.  Shakespeare's words alone are often enough to enthrall an audience, but none of Taymor's bells and whistles could keep me interested in these.",979257600,,1542,5.193548387096774

1101036,5,6305963126,"Titus is by far the most visually stunning film of 2000.  Gladiator has its CGI, but Titus has its craning, sweeping camera, its double and triple exposed film, and its magnificant pallette of colors.  In Julie Taymor's adaption of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, Sir Anthony Hopkins plays the title character of Titus, an excrutiatingly loyal Roman general who, early in the film, kills one of his four sons for betraying his good name.  His foil is the Goth queen Tamora, whose eldest son was executed by Hopkin's sons after his return from battle.  After taking the company and hand in marriage of the emperor, Tamora and her lover, Aaron the Moor, attempt to bring the downfall of Titus and the entire Andronicus family, starting first with Titus's daughter Lavinia, played by the beautiful Laura Fraser.  Titus's family is then set up in various ways that are too delightful and menacing to tell, for the entire film is something to be seen, all the way to the incredible visual and powerful ending.
The sets and production design are perhaps some of the best in film in many recent years.  The levels of beauty are mirrored by the level of amorous behavior by the characters.  While the traditional style of filmmaking used by Taymor and her crew may look cheesy and old to some viewers, every single shot works, from the first gittery camera motions to the state of the art computer aided shots at the end.  This is an exquisite film with grand performances by the entire cast, and I do mean ENTIRE, and brilliant visuals by director Taymor.  You do not have to be a fan of Shakespeare to enjoy this film, as I can guarantee it is like no other Shakespeare film you will ever see.",978220800,3,1687,4.672297297297297

The next thing you know, the boy is carried into an ancient stadium with a wall of a burning building in it.  Then, dozens of blue mud-slathered roman soldiers march in.  Not making much sense?

1101087,5,6305963126,"I saw this film in its original theatrical release earlier this year and was blown away by its visuals, music, and the mesmerizing performances.  The one element however that really stuck in my mind was its violence.
Upon a second viewing - on DVD - I found myself concentrating especially on the piece as a cinematic whole and found myself less horrified by the gore and more entranced by the story that was being told.
This is a story about family - preserving family honor, restoring it when honor has been lost, and exacting revenge upon those who dare try to take it away. It is also about the lengths some will go to to protect their loved ones against wrongdoing.
Anthony Hopkins as Titus Andronicus is an awesome cinematic force from beginning to end.  His performance throughout is filled with subtle embellishments that horrify and delight, and his final scene - which is just shy of camp - is perhaps one of this actor's finest moments.
Harry Lennix as Aaron the Moor is devilishly frightening.  Angus MacFayden as Titus's eldest son Lucius suitably regal.  Laura Fraser as Lavinia, Titus's beloved daughter who has perhaps the story's cruelest fate (and one of the most spectacularly visual/metaphoric scenes in the film - of perhaps any film) is touching.  Alan Cumming's Saturnin is right up there with his ""Cabaret"" MC for its lascivious menace.  I could go on...
The only performance I'm somewhat hesitant about is Jessica Lange as Tamora, Queen of the Goths.  Shakespeare's language for some reason doesn't sound a comfortable fit in some of her line readings; however, she improves as the film progresses and is quite powerful the second hour or so onward.
Juliet Taymor proves once again that she is a master of the visual element.  This film contains scenes of staggering beauty which are beautifully rendered in the DVD's letterbox format.
While certainly not for the faint of heart - the climactic banquet scene is a doozy - this film is a triumph not just as a Shakespeare adaptation but as a work of art in its own right.
I eagerly anticipate Ms. Taymor's next film endeavor.",977961600,4,2099,4.795013850415512

Julie Tamor and her staff did a wonderful job giving the movie a unique look and each shot has a real theatrical style.

1101091,2,6305963126,"I don't mind it when Shakespeare plays are adapted to locales and time periods different from those that Shakespeare wrote for them.  So long as the are tastefully done, that is all well and good.  After all, one of the best features of Shakespeare drama is the timelessness  of his plays;  they depict human nature today with as much veracity as they did in Elizabethen England.
However, I draw the line at renditions of Shakespeare such as this one.  The film is full of anachronisms of ancient Rome blended with the milieu of modern day technology.  The production has an overall 1920s style feel to it, with all sorts of Nazi images mixed in.  This combination makes for a rather incoherent and nonsensical movie.
Make no mistake, however, this is a very well done film (for what it is).  Julie Taymor is a remarkable director and the movie is full of superb acting (Anthony Hopkins' perfomance stands out - as usual).  It is also filled with lavish sets, all of them wonderfully designed.
I suppose the bottom line, for me, is that I would very much like to overhear a conversation taken on between Sam Beckett and one William Shakespeare.  However, I don't believe that even they would dream of attempting to merge their diverse styles into a hybrid.  That, I'm afraid, is the task this project endeavors to undertake.

1101092,1,6305963126,"Julie Taymor is a designer, not a director.  She lavishes all her creative energy on scenery, props, costumes and other inanimate objects.  She can treat human beings as stage-dressing (the lock-step soldiers, the orgiastic revellers), but she cannot cast them properly or convince them to give good performances.  Anthony Hopkins murmurs, rants and snarls without once achieving significant emotion; Jessica Lange and Harry Lennix can barely speak, let alone fill their roles; Colm Feore (Canada's idea of a major classical actor) does nothing with his apostrophe to Lavinia; and Alan Cumming is not convincing as a heterosexual.  In brief, Taymor's film is a characteristic specimen of postmodern Shakespeare:  heavy on production design, but dramatically and histrionically mediocre.  One cannot do justice to Shakespeare through imagery alone, a truth that postmodern auteurs seem unable to grasp.  And Titus, of all plays, is about flesh and blood, the very elements that leave Taymor at a loss.",977011200,13,1000,5.454545454545454
1101093,5,6305963126,"I bought this movie for the only reason that Alan Cumming was in it. I did not know that I would watch it repeatedly, each time getting that same, tingiling feeling of disturbance and utter beauty.  When I realized that Julie Taymor had directed the film I automatically knew that it would be an extravagant and extremely well acted motion picture...which, in turn, it was.  many people believe that the modern/ancient Roman/surrealism of it all defeats the purpose of it being Shakespearian anyway, but I found that it added (if not improved) the entire story.  The soldiers fight with automatic guns, the women wear full metal bodices and the emporers drive around in antibellum classic cars. It is not so ""modern"" as to ruin the story -or even distract- but to compare and contrast the human flaws felt even today.  Murder, rape and revenge. These are the three evils faced throught the motion picture. TITUS is uniqe because it dosen't just have a protagonist and antagonist like so many other films today. It shows that although you may be living the story through the ""good-guy's"" eyes, the ""good-guy"" still does a lot of really bad things.  The actors of TITUS are equally stirring. From the war torn Titus (Anthony Hopkins) we see that war, blood thirst and pain will drive one mad. From the sexpot Tamora (Jessica Lange) we observe a mother trying to survive no matter what. From the innocent Lavinia (Laura Frasier) we witness the brutal rape and nightmarish mauling of a loyal daughter and loving wife. And of course from the extremely vain, over-dressed Saturninus (the AMAZINGLY sexy Alan Cumming) we find that placing power in the wrong hands is like tripping down a flight of stairs with an unpinned grenade.  In conclution, TITUS stayed with me long after I first saw it. Between the disturbing imagery of severed hands repalced by twigs, the revolt of subdued cannabalism and the awe of such a masterful work from such a mutilating story.

1101094,5,6305963126,"As a play, ""Titus Andronicus"" is not the best of Shakespeare's works.  It's an early piece.  It's violent.  It's relentless in its downward spiral.  Nevertheless, one can see elements in it that Shakespeare would use later - existential dilemas, outcast Moors (he really had a thing against Moors, didn't he?), honor, pride, treason, madness, questions of lineage and heritage, among others.  These elements are in such proliferation here that it's difficult to talk about them.  Later plays explore these themes much more thoroughly because each play has fewer themes to think about.
As a movie TITUS is an amazing piece.  The acting is superb - especially from Hopkins, Lange (but is that really surprising?) and Fraser (whose Lavinia is stunningly beautiful, strong and tragic).  Taymor's visuals are fascinating - I'd be tempted to compare them to Peter Greenaway's, but Taymor's are more accesible, though they share a sort of ecclecticism.
Yes, you've seen more blood and guts in other movies.  Yes, they still speak in complicated iambic pentameter.  Yes, the plot is murky and slow at times...  but these are all part of the experience of TITUS.  Even the slow parts reveal much about these characters if one is paying attention.
All in all, this movie was an experience I would not have foregone for anything.  Very worth a viewing, but make sure you're not in too good a mood when you watch it.  Your mood could sour quickly.",975715200,,1435,4.949790794979079

1101096,2,6305963126,"From everything I had seen regarding Titus, I expected a film of epic proportions, perhaps understated by the box office, but very good nonetheless.  What I got was a confusing, and very little of what I was expecting. In fact, it was bad enough that 50 minutes into the movie I turned it off because I was unable to follow the plot well enough.
I had expected a Film about a Roman General (Titus) and a woman (Tamora of the Goths) who eldest son was put to death by Titus's orders. I did not expect the film to open up with a child playing with soldiers on a kitchen table. Nor did I expect to see soldiers on motor cycles, people running for emperor in automobiles, or a Big Band at Emperor Saturnine wedding to Tamora.  I understood that it was director's way of merging past with present, but I wasn't expecting and I think that's what ruined the movie for me.
The acting in the movie was decent, but from what I saw there were weak spots.  Alan Cumming appeared as your typical slimy power hungry man, which has it's weak and strong points, namely that every slimy guy always seems to act out of anger.
Anthony Hopkins pulls off a Decent Titus, although it seemed that whenever he was getting to a point where he must play the heard hearted general/father, his facial expression belied his words. He appeared to be nearly smiling in some places where he was casting off his family for causing him to lose face.
Jessica Lange presented Tamora, Queen of the Goths well, although there were places where she appeared to drift off into another character all together. One notable account was when she encouraged Saturnine to restore Titus back into his old rank, and forgive his children for acting against him. She appears to go into a trance, and spits out words about avenging her son's death. It wasn't the words of a queen wanting revenge, it was more like the ranting of a madwoman, which she didn't seem to be.
All in all I was disappointed with the film, and if I ever see it again and change my thoughts on it, I'll re-review it, but it was a let down after all the rave reviews I had heard of it. Perhaps if I had been warned it was merging past with present I would have liked it more, but my initial confusion threw me enough that I could not enjoy the film.",975196800,6,2271,4.376777251184834

The result is very theatrical and uber-decadent, with faint echoes of Fellini's Satyricon (which I did not like), and a complete disregard for historical period constraints---yet all of these potentially ruinous elements are held in check by the solid structure and dignified language of the original script.
The initial and final scenes are slightly dubious; aesthetically refined, but probably unnecessary.
The architectural set design, cinematography, and acting are all excellent.  And I might add I was almost ready to become a vegetarian after the climactic ""feast"" scene....",975024000,,739,5.589285714285714

For the most part, I love Julie Taymor's style.  The set design, the costumes, the locations, and the casting all intermesh in a way that leaves you hungering for more.  Ms. Taymor liberaly and wisely cut Shakespeare's original script.
More magnificent than the Roman armor, the classical and neo-classical sets, the vivid blue clay, and the blood red cloaks, Anthony Hopkins made this film more than an art film.  His connection to the character is evident and moving.  Titus is a ruthless, almost heartless man.  Hopkins relishes in the subtleties the part requires and helps the viewer explore these subtleties with his characterization.  By the end, your heart is with Titus . . . so much so that it may frighten you.
The other performances were all very impressive.  Jessica Lange and Alan Cumming did admirable jobs.  Nothing more or less than you would expect of them really.  The actor who portrays Aaron, name escapes, filled out his role well.  I am sure we will se more of him.
My only criticism was the superficial treatment of the two Goth brothers.  I understand Taymor's decision to make them pleasure seeking, video-game playing punks, but the music video approach to shooting them left me disappointed.  The actors themselves looked and performed like rejects from Duran Duran than heartless and vicious young demons.  They should have reflected a greater darkness.  They do not haunt, frighten, or energize.  They are a bit ridiculous.

I also figured it had to be half-decent if Anthony Hopkins was in it, and my girl-friend said thet Colm Feore was amazing in the films she had studied.  I had heard very little about this film when it was in theaters - just that it was based on Shakespeare's first blockbuster play and that it was quite violent.  I have since watched this thing about 7 times, and at almost 3 hours in length, that means two things ... 1: that it must have depth, both visually and character-wise, for it to keep my interest again and again, and  2: I must have a lot of free time ...  This film is definately not for everyone, I had some trouble following it at first, I never was much for Shakespeare back in school when it was forced upon us (which it should've been) but after watching it a few times, occasionally with captions on, and then again with the most insightful commentary I have heard about a film, or anything for that matter, this is at the top of my list of favorite films, amongst StarWars, Twin Peaks, and Buffalo 66.(these films are in no way similar to each other?!)  The extra's on this thing are amazing.  The most interesting ones would be the feature commentary with Julie Taymor, the Q & A segment she held after a screening with theatre/film stidents, and the very indepth 'making of' documentary - which shows EVERYTHING: including the actors practicing lines and reading the script together for the first time, and set designers and prop-makers designing sets and making props (tee-hee).

This movie is so MTV, generation X that I was cringing all the way through(suprisingly Titus' mobile didn't ring at all, maybe it was turned off, or maybe I just slept through that part).  The violence that everybody is talking about is not at all graphic and is very infrequent.  The ending is the only graphically violent scene in the whole film and is no worse than you have seen a million times before.  Even the scene where a girl has her hands cut of and replaced with twigs is not as bad as it sounds.  The cutting off of her hands is not shown, just her stumps after the incident, even then it's all nice and clean, somewhat sterile actually.  The orgy scene has a bit of nudity, but this is also no more graphic than any other film.  The ending is well played out and is really the only time that the film starts to get a little gritty and atmospheric.  This simply isn't worth nearly three hours of your time.

1101140,5,6305963126,"For all its gruesome detail and its history of critics' attempts to deny it a place in Shakespeare's canon, Titus Andronicus remains the most popular of Shakespeare's plays in the author's own time. From this fact, we must take away the painful truth--this is Shakespeare's most representative play of his age. If we delve into this play demanding meanings we can easily comprehend or values we will share, we may well be demanding too much. Certainly, the stage history of this play over the last century supports this--Titus is rarely staged, and I have sat among audiences that dwindled by 90% by the intermission during excellent productions. In other words, this is a hard play to watch, with a history of hostility from both audiences and critics.
Clearly, Julie Taymor considered this carefully when she was assembling her cast. I would have sat through this film if only to watch this amazing group in action. Of a cluster of simply stellar performances, Jessica Lange's stands out for me; she is incredible as she switches seamlessly back and forth from grief-stricken mother to vicious avenger to political virago. Anthony Hopkins balances her powerful performance with a Titus who chills the blood, swerving from iron general to abandoned veteran to confused patriarch of a family doomed by his lack of understanding and vision.
Taymor sets this amazing cast in a fusion world of fascist, Roman (classical and modern), and current elements; she crafts each moment--indeed, each second--to fit flawlessly into a unified vision of horror. Costuming, settings, effects, props are all wonderfully united to create the nightmarish world of patriarchy unable to examine its own realities and its need to deal with those outside its logic.
I wish so much that this film had been available when I was teaching this play at the university level. Taymor has given every university-level Shakespeare teacher a fabulous instrument for teaching Titus from a variety of perspectives. I am grateful, too, for the inteviews and descriptions included in the DVD version, as they provide even more fertile material for discussion at a graduate level. I would start at Taymor's lack of discussion of the ferocious xenophobia and sexism of this play; I would also love to discuss the Elizabethan elements of the play with a group of advanced readers. I am grateful to Julie Taymor and her wonderful cast and staff for providing us with an excellent version of a truly difficult and painful play.",972777600,,2486,5.065853658536585
1101141,4,6305963126,"An adaptation of what is perhaps the least regarded, least performed, and most shocking of William Shakespeare's plays, Titus makes Natural Born Killers look like Patch Adams -- severed body parts, orgies, torture, incest, rape, and cannibalism, oh my!  Romeo + Juliet it ain't; it is, however, brilliant.  Contemporary audiences are blithely accustomed to sex and violence.  What takes theater director Julie Taymor's lush production to a higher level is her attention to aesthetics; the emotional power of Shakespeare's language is leavened rather than eclipsed by absurdity and dark humor.  The sets are a hybrid of ancient Rome (swords, banquets) and modern day (techno, skyscrapers); the result is not confusion or artifice but a sort of timelessness that serves to highlight the raw drama of the events.  At moments of peak brutality the mood veers into absurdist black comedy, aided by Anthony Hopkins' manic, intense, razor's-edge performance.  The immediacy of the violence is sometimes hard to watch, but never casual or thoughtless.  Tarantino's disciples could learn a thing or two from this Bill Shakespeare fellow.",972345600,3,1128,5.411428571428571

Neither disappoints but the end result is not a satisfactory experience. It isn't enough to say that this is not one of Shakespeare's best plays; it is so bad that it is hard to credit it as the work of the same man who created Hamlet, Macbeth, and King Lear. Even two talents as great as Hopkins and Taymor can't redeem this mess.
Like Taymor's Broadway production of The Lion King, the movie is visually stunning and original in every frame. There are images that are so unexpected and satisfying in their own right that one is tempted to forget the reason they are on the screen in the first place. Then Hopkins appears and one has to turn the sound up again. But only for him. Jessica Lang, always a great beauty, has never been mistaken for a great actress and proves it in Titus yet again. Simply wrong for the part and no match for Hopkins.
The supporting cast members are uniformly either weak or bad or both. It is a shame, but even great talent would have trouble breathing life into this story with its excessive violent horror and lack of human feeling. I wound up rewatching parts of the film with the sound off just because it is so much fun to look at.

The costumes are Cabaret meets Julius Caesar meets the Untouchables.  But it works.
This isn't for the sqeamish either.  I don't think I'll be able to eat ground beef for weeks.
But Taymor has given  us a fast paced spectacle as entertaining as any action/adventure movie ever produced.  The only thing that is disappointing is that she leaves Hopkins to play essentially the same characters he played in Dracula and Silence of the Lambs - uncontrolled where control would have served the material better.  More emphasis is given to the look, feel, and pace than to character development.
But for Shakespeare fans, this DVD is a welcome addition (if not departure) from the standard Shakespeare fare.  I would still love to see Taymor take a stab at Macbeth.",972086400,,1075,5.005649717514125

This is almost like watching Mel Gibson in Hamlet;Some things may go over your head, but you get the general idea...In the end it's all about basic human emotions,needs, wants, and (darkest) desires ranging the gamut from romance to revenge from their most delicate and tender frail moments to sadistic, savage, and inhumane acts.

1101194,4,6305963126,"Judging by the state of modern adaptations, it's not possible to take Shakespeare literally anymore.  Either you bump him up a couple of centuries, a la Branagh's Hamlet, or you set him in some strange alternate universe (the most recent Romeo and Juliet).  Director Julie Taymor (Broadway's Lion King) opts for the latter with Titus, and brings feverishly heightened visual acuity to the larger-than-life story.
The play Titus Andronicus is Shakespeare's first tragedy, and it shows.  Though the dialog is top-notch, he hasn't got a handle on the mechanisms of tragedy yet.  The action veers from bloody misfortune to misfortune without the internal logic of, say, King Lear.  In modern terms, it's more ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" than ""Fargo.""
None of that matters, however.  Taymor has chosen a fantastic cast, including Hopkins as the titular Roman general drivin to the brink of madness, Jessica Lange as his sultry nemesis, the Goth queen Tamora (proving how smolderingly sexy middle age can be), and Laura Fraser skillfully underplaying a potentially histrionic nightmare.  The superb performances thoroughly mask the creaks in the plot.
More than anything, however, the production design is worth ....  Taymor's absolutely insane in the best possible ways.  Her Shakespearean Rome is an anachronistic stew -- jeeps and motorcycles share the roads with carts and horses, soldiers fight with arrows, knives, and guns.  The costumes must be seen to be believed.  Taymor keeps a firm reign on the disparate design elements, filling each frame with fever-dream colors and subtle symbolism.  There are images in this film that will be permanently seared into your subconscious.
I recommend this to everyone (over 17) except the usual crowd -- Shakespearean purists won't like it, the squeamish will lose their lunch halfway through it, short attention spans will balk at the 2:30 running time.  If you're none of those, snag this DVD and watch a fantastic flick.  Then watch it again with the director's commentary.

A lot of Shakepeare is but this takes it to another level.  I love how the director stages the Ancient Roman scene in a world that is strangely modern but holds all the ancient traditions.  She uses 20th century Rome as her backdrop, an example is Mussolini's government building.  The story is engaging and exciting and the performances are great, especially Anthony Hopkins and the other supporting leads.  As someone who studied the Roman world throughout college and beyond and also as a fellow actor of the cast this movie was all around interesting to me.

1101197,3,6305963126,"The audiences of Shakespeare's time didn't just enjoy his plays.  They
also were rather partial to cock-fighting, brutal bare-knuckle boxing
-- and public whippings, pillories, hangings, beheadings, and
burnings.  Large crowds turned out (with picnic lunches) to enjoy the
average public execution.
Shakespeare was no fool; trying to build
up his career he had to write some shock-schlock to appeal to the
people who these days like to slow down and take a good, long, loving
look at major car accidents.
Unfortunately, Taymor has quite
authentically crafted a _Titus_ that appeals to that same regrettable
taste.  There's some good acting (notably the Moorish villain,
beautifully played!) but the appalling violence is the star of the
show -- this is just ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" in fancy
dress and with more melodious dialogue.
Of all Shakespeare's plays
this is perhaps the one best adaptible to our current nadir in
cinematic and dramatic values. Redemption there is none; Taymor had to
write in a kitschy, wordless end-sequence to spread a little positive
icing onto the relentless despair of the script. Taymor in her
obligatory interview congratulates audiences of the early 21st century
on their ability to find humour in violence and brutality.  I am not
inclined to congratulation; barbarism doesn't become more attractive
just because it's contemporary.  If contemporary audiences find
murder, rape, cannibalism and insanity amusing, then I suggest we need
look no further for reasons for most of our social ills.
Brutality
and psychotic selfishness have been fashionable in American culture
for a couple of decades now, and somehow we are all wailing and
tut-tutting about the inevitable consequences (like Littleton) yet
patting ourselves on the back for our ""sophistication"" and
our admiration for evil.  We can't have it both ways. When we admire
and vicariously snigger at evil, we teach our kids what to admire and
how to be.  When they learn what we teach them, we have no one to
blame but ourselves.
There is some fine location filming here, some
derivative but pleasing surrealism (mostly cribbed from Fellini and
his followers), and of course Hopkins is always worth watching (the
sole reason I bothered with the film, actually).  What was tedious and
at times quite appalling was the ""see how shocking we can
be"" self-conscious nastiness of the directing.
I'm not saying
it's inauthentic; updated, yes, but I think true to the same spirit
that led our beloved William to spill fake blood and dismembered
bodies all over the stage for his finale.
The question that troubles
me is, how much farther is there to go in the shock/schlock genre?
Personally I am not only bored by now, I'm more disgusted (not less)
with each insult to my intelligence, each director who thinks the only
way to entertain me is to show me a newer and fancier car wreck, a
more protracted hanging, a heretic screaming more loudly in the
flames.  At what point do we decide that perhaps human misery and
suffering are not all that entertaining after all?
Or shall we just
kiss off the idea of a civil and democratic society, open up a few
arenas, and start selling tickets for the new gladiatorial games?  Are
we all that far from doing so now?  This latest ""Titus""

The arrogant Julie Taymor is obviously trying to ""teach"" us things with this mess, but instead has produced a haphazard melange that is neither entertaining nor particularly attractive.

This movie accomplishes that by using what seems like perfectly  casted actors who speak their lines as a shakespearian actor  should...slowly, and with no background noise or score.  Many times the  language is ruined because the actors rush the lines.  The first 45 minutes  is a little harder to understand than the rest, but only because the  charcaters are talking about things that have taken place before the movie  started, and it requires alot of inferencing.
Many people also get  turned-off by the fact that it does not seem to take place at any one time,  but rather spans all of time.  Modern meets old.

1101260,4,6305963126,"""Titus"" is yet another vain attempt to ""update"" Shakespeare for  consumption by the masses.  Like others before it, this film maintains the  original verse intact, while providing imagery that is artsy and hip with  no real relationship to the original story.  The good news is that the  acting was potent and delivered a forceful rendition of Shakespeare's most  disturbing play.  The bad news is that the dark and bizarre imagery was at  best distracting and at worst detracting.
Julie Taymor's imagery was  somewhere between nightmarish and hallucinogenic.  It was typical of a  style I call Noir Bizarre, where dark themes are augmented by weird and  disjointed images, replete with gruesome scenes and morbid undertones.  Tim  Burton's work is illustrative of this style.  Taymor conjures a surreal  version of ancient Rome with contrived retro/futuristic costumes, and  modern period props such as motorcycles, automatic weapons and arcade games  interspersed with horse drawn chariots and swords.  Tamora's (Jessica  Lange's) costumes were particularly outlandish.
It is invariably  mentioned by the directors that make these Shakespearean updates that they  provide an opportunity to bring Shakespeare to a new generation.  They hope  that adulterating his work by repackaging it with pop culture imagery will  somehow make it more appealing to the masses.  The irony is that just about  all of them have been abysmal commercial failures.  As soon as the masses  discover that the Old English verse has been preserved, they steer clear.  The only people who ultimately see these films are the people who liked  Shakespeare in the first place, and they generally resent the visual  perversion.
Despite my disdain for Taymor's strangely fantastic vision,  the film was effective mostly due to the superlative acting of Anthony  Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming, and Harry Lennix.  Hopkins'  sophisticated and wieldy presence provided a dominating force that  bolstered the entire cast.  Jessica Lange was maniacal as the evil  seductress intent on revenge upon Titus and his family for the death of her  son.  Harry Lennix gave an absolutely demonic performance of Aaron, the  malevolent moor whose only repentance was for the good deeds he had done in  his life.  Alan Cumming was also excellent as the sniveling Emperor being  manipulated like a puppet by powerful forces on all sides.
In the final  analysis, the peculiarity of Taymor's vision distorted but did not negate  the excellence of the acting and the power of the play.  I rated it a 7/10.  I recommend that Shakespeare lovers not be driven away by the avant-garde  presentation and allow themselves the opportunity to enjoy the awesome  performance of a terrific cast.",968025600,2,2742,5.2727272727272725

However, it must be said that the portrayals of Gary Coleman (as the innocent animatronics babe) and the guy in the blue down jacket (with the backward baseball cap) were nearly as moving.  Thank God that we obtained this DVD gratis, because had we spent one one-millionth of the percentage of the production budget, we would have been sorely wronged.  Julie (the director) had been better off sticking with the Broadway productions, for had she ever produced something as long and drawn out for the stage -- half of her audience would have died from plot asphyxiation.

The surreal atmosphere that unapologetically mixes 20s noir, mid 20th century machinery and ancient Rome is what makes the melodramatic plot and dialogue of the play work:  when an unbelievable script is mixed properly with an unbelievable execution, another world, with its own rules and dynamics, is created.  It's how Tolkien works, it's how 2001 works(with it's otherwise cardboard characters that take a seat behind Kubrick's elegant, awesome imagery.)  It's vaguely cartoony in it's mechanics and epic, grotesque violence, and ends up being so much more than anything, I suspect, Shakespreare intended.  Titus is a critique on the karmic nature of brutality, and also a gruesome look at human childishness.
Another aspect of this film I often see unfairly denounced is its blunt imagery.  The scene in which a lamb is presented, echoing of the Biblical tale of Abraham and his son, and superimposed upon it is Mutius' head, the background awash with flames, is a prime example.  Again, I insist that its non-esoteric, animated nature is what saves this wonderful gem of a movie, the dance number that begins Titus, and the hardcore techno blasts that accompany the presence of  Tamora's villainous sons,  all serve to expand(both ridiculously and aptly) on the glorification of violence and revenge.  The ending scene(which, I admit, is bit heavy on the length; it could have been trimmed down, but ultimately does not ruin the movie) with two children of the play, one of which proves to be the only real adult in this entire story, is a symbol of new hope, hints of a Spring to follow the cold, merciless goings-on that they were victims of and voyeurs to.
On a somewhat digressive note, I would like to point out the superb acting that plays almost as much of a part of this film's success as Taymor's direction. Anthony Hopkins et al do a wonderful job of fleshing out plot-cog characters, and making them interesting and compelling through creative and witty inflection and facial expression.
To finish: I'm as critical of the avant-garde and nouveau-outre as anyone, I know crap can sometimes be sneaked into the spotlight under the guise of being innovative, but this is not crap.  What we have here is perhaps the best interpretation of a Shakespearean play since Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet.  This, I say with the full confidence of seasoned movie goer and critic.  Please, do yourself a favor and rent this tonight.",967507200,,2920,5.00206611570248
1101320,5,6305963126,"There is no doubt that Titus is a brutal play, and it would be ridiculous to say that Taymor manages to redeem its more sordid moments...but she  comes very close. Taymor knows the power of image and how a beautifully  shot scene can take your breath away even when the words are less than top  drawer ( of course, it must be said that even bottom drawer Shakespeare is  pretty damn good). This film abounds with images of haunting and disturbing  beauty that seem to ask that most frightening of questions : can acts of  evil be beautiful? Perhaps the most heartstopping image is that of Lavinia,  raped and mangled, standing alone atop a stump in a barren marsh. Her hands  have been cutoff by Tamoras animalistic sons and they have been replaced  with a bunch of twigs and as she stands Taymor pans out framing a picture  of extraordinary pathos -- this is brilliant filmaking, this is filamking  that takes your breath away. Of course the film would be nothing without  the actors, who are a virtuosic lot. Hopkins Titus is a marvel of prismatic  acting -- his move from noble (if flawed) father to a madman,who in his  lunacy finds the light of truth, is remarkable and assured. Lange, the only  non brit in the cast gives a bravuric performance, proving that she may  well be one of the finest actresses in the world today. Her fabulous face,  with its ability to go from angelic beauty to twisted ugliness on the turn  of a dime only adds to a masterful performance. Of course one cannot forget  Alan Cummings performance as the preening emperor -- brilliant! Lennix is  GREAT as Aaron (clearly the model for Shakespeares greatest villain Iago).  The supporting cast is flawless (especially the Lavinia and Tamoras two  sons). Don't miss this movie it will move you deeply...how many recent  movies can you say that about.

One of the great things about film is its ability  to visually comment on text and ""Titus"" does so in a way that is  both accessible and challenging. Seeing Saturninus as a decadent Fascist or  Chiron and Demetrius as S&M-chic Droogies resonates more than a period  production would; the images help the viewer understand the characters  while at the same time encouraging a more complex analysis of the play's  outrageous violence and cruelty.

In addition, the ""grand finale""  of the movie consists of 3 entire minutes of NOTHING but a boy walking out  of a theatre in slow motion.

This movie version doesn't improve the play so much as  salvage and accentuate what was good about it.  Perhaps that was precious  little, but it was an admirable attempt nonetheless.
For example, Titus  Andronicus is not a very sympathetic character, but he does challenge the  actor to display a wide array of skills; there are great moments of grief,  pride, madness, vengance, even subtle moments of loyalty and blindness.  Anthony Hopkins' brilliance really shines through.
Of course, the best  portrayal is of Aaron.  Harry Lennix does wonders with one of the best  roles for black actors today.  The Moorish tutor seeths with facinating and  attractive evil--like Darth Maul, but with more speaking lines.
Check out  the scene where the Goth princes try to kill his son; you won't forget it.  Is it racist?  Sure.

1101326,5,6305963126,"Julie Taymor, of Broadway's ""Lion King"" fame, creates a dazzling surreal anachronistic fantasy world with her feature film directorial  debut. ""Titus"" (lately, ""Titus Andronicus,"") though  thought to be Shakespeare's worst play, is a beautiful symphony of  distruction, murder, deception, seduction, rape, and cannibalism...at least  it becomes so under Taymor's careful direction. The choreographed opening  scene of marching soldiers weary from battle in the middle of the collesium  sets the tone for a very unlikely brilliant piece of film. Alongside  armored soldiers on horseback, people ride down the street in automobiles  of various periods. A jazz band accompanies the new young emperor's wedding  night orgy. And two young Gothic barbarians in furs trade in their furs for  leather and video games. This movie is beautiful, intelligent, and above  all unexpected. You can't help but like Aaron the Moor, who prides himself  on his villany. Even the queens young sons you can't help but find  fascinating, despite their rape of Titus' young daughter Lavinia.
Anthony Hopkins, as always, is brilliant in the title role of Titus. A  man dedicated to his country and his emperor and upholds duty above all  else...even willing to risk his daughter's unhappiness by consenting to her  marriage to the young corrupt emperor Saturninus. Saturninus however  eventually marries Titus' captive Gothic queen, played with true sinister  brutality by the unrepentantly sexy Jessica Lange. One of her sons you  might even recognize from the movie ""Velvet Goldmine."" Saturninus  is played by the always talented and sexually enigmatic Alan Cumming who  seems to take great pleasure in imitating more politicians than you could  shake a stick at. But hands down the show is stolen by Henry Lennix,  playing the evil Aaron, the queens trusted friend and consort. Aaron never  apologized for all the pain he has inflicted or his evil ways...he revels  in them.
The ending is not unexpected considering most Shakespearian  tragedies...but I won't ruin the finer points. Suffice it to say, my  personal favorite scene involves the queens two sons, Lavinia, and some  twigs put to some very interesting use...this scene sticks with you long  after the movie has ended...as beautiful and haunting as it is horrifying.",966470400,12,2306,5.345403899721449

However, this weird mess of  a film is little more that a deranged hybrid of Dallas, Sweeney Todd  and Psycho, as family members chop off one another's hands, cut  out tongues, gouge eyes, eviscerate torsos, slit throats and concoct  unique recipes (Gee, sounds like everything a great movie  needs, eh?)

1101389,4,6305963126,"In recent years, a new fashion has sprung up among filmmakers who have attempted to bring Shakespeare's works to the screen. No longer content to  keep the plays bound to the historical eras in which they are set, many an  adapter has chosen to transport the plots and dialogue virtually intact to  either a completely modern setting or a strange never-never land that  combines elements of the past with elements of the present. In just the  last few years, we have seen this done with `Romeo and Juliet,' `Richard  the Third' (albeit this one made it only as far as the 1940's) and even  Kenneth Branagh's `Hamlet,' which, although also not exactly contemporary  in setting, did at least move that familiar story ahead in time several  centuries. Now comes `Titus,' a film based on one of Shakespeare's  earliest, bloodiest and least well known plays, `Titus Andronicus,' and, in  many ways, this film is the most bizarrely conceived of the four, since it  creates a world in which - amidst the architectural splendors of ancient  columned buildings - Roman warriors, dressed in traditional armor and  wielding unsheathed swords, battle for power in a land disconcertingly  filled with motorcycles and automobiles, pool tables and Pepsi cans, punk  hair cuts and telephone poles, video games and loud speakers. The effect of  all this modernization may be unsettling and off-putting to the  Shakespearean purist, yet, in the case of all four of these films, the  directorial judgment has paid off handsomely. Not only does this technique  revive some of the freshness of these overly familiar works, but these  strange, otherworldly settings actually render more poetic the heightened  unreality of Shakespeare's dialogue. Plus, in all honesty, Shakespeare's  plays are themselves riddled with so many examples of historical  anachronisms that the `crime' of modernization seems a piddling one at  best.
Those unfamiliar with `Titus Andronicus' may well be caught off  guard by the ferocious intensity of this Shakespearean work. Moralists who  decry the rampant display of unrestrained violence in contemporary culture  and look longingly back to a time when art and entertainment were  supposedly free of this particular blight may well be shocked and appalled  to see Shakespeare's utter relishment in gruesomeness and gore here. In  this shocking tale of betrayal, vengeance and rampant brutality, heads,  tongues and limbs are lopped off with stunning regularity and it is a  measure of Julie Taymor's skill as a director and her grasp of the shocking  nature of the material that, even in this day and age when we have become  so inured and jaded in the area of screen violence, we are truly shaken by  the work's cruelty and ugliness. Yet, Taymor occasionally injects scenes of  daring black comedy into the proceedings, as when Titus and his brother  carry away the heads of his sons contained in glass jars while his own  daughter, who has had her own hands chopped off in a vicious rape, carries  Titus' own dismembered hand in her teeth! There are even meat pies made out  of two of Titus's enemies to be served up as dinner for their unwitting  mother. Thus, even though we can never take our eyes off the screen, this  is often a very difficult film to watch.
`Titus' is filled with elements  of character, plot and theme that Shakespeare would enlarge upon in later  works. It includes a father betrayed by his progeny (`King Lear'), a  Moorish general (`Othello'), a struggle for political power (`Julius  Caesar' among others) and - a theme that runs through virtually all  Shakespeare's tragedies - the need for revenge to maintain filial or  familial honor. Anthony Hopkins is superb as Titus, capturing the many  internal contradictions that plague this man who, though a beloved national  hero and military conqueror, finds himself too weary to accept the popular  acclamation to make him emperor - a decision he will live to rue when his  refusal ends up placing the power directly into the hands of a rival who  makes it his ambition to bring ghastly ruin upon Titus' family. Titus is  also a man who can, without a twinge of conscience, kill a son he feels has  betrayed him and disembowel a captive despite the pleas of his desperate  mother, yet, at the same time, show mercy to the latter's family, humbly  refuse the power offered him, and break down in heartbroken despair at the  executions of his sons and the sight of his own beloved daughter left  tongueless and handless by those very same people he has seen fit to spare.  Jessica Lange, as the mother of the captive Titus cruelly dismembers,  seethes with subtle, pent-up anger as she plots her revenge against Titus  and his family.
Visually, this widescreen film is a stunner. Taymor  matches the starkness of the drama with a concomitant visual design, often  grouping her characters in studied compositions set in bold relief against  an expansive, dominating sky. At times, the surrealist imagery mirrors  Fellini at his most flamboyant.
The fact that this is one of  Shakespeare's earliest works is evident in the undisciplined plotting and  the emphasis on sensationalism at the expense of the powerful themes that  would be developed more fully in those later plays with which we are all  familiar. At the end of the story, for instance, many of the characters  seem to walk right into their deaths in ways that defy credibility. We  sense that Shakespeare may not yet have developed the playwright's gift for  bringing all his elements together to create a satisfying resolution. Thus,  it is the raw energy of the novice - the obvious glee with which this young  writer attacks his new medium - that Taymor, in her wildly absurdist style,  taps into most strongly. `Titus' may definitely not be for the faint of  heart or the weak of stomach, but the purely modern way in which the  original play is presented in this particular film version surely  underlines the timelessness that is Shakespeare.",966470400,,5995,4.963709677419355

But Titus  Andronichus is a 'difficult' play, with extreme violence and even more  extreme black comedy, as well as such controversial issues as rape, racism,  and 'family values'.  Therefore, the film itself comes as a surprise,  for several reasons; firstly, because it isn't all that violent; secondly,  because it does a remarkably good job of bringing out all the contemporary  nuances by deliberate anachronisms; thirdly, because it is superbly acted  by such greats as Hopkins and Lange; lastly, because Julie Taymor manages  to take the material further than a better-known director might have wanted  to.  The DVD is excellent-ish. Taymor's commentary is as useful and  relevant as you might have imagined, and the isolated music score is good  (although Elliot Goldenthal's score is a bit too 'Batman Forever'-esque in  places). There's a good documentary, a useful Q and A session with Taymor,  an interesting bit on the SFX and....that's basically it. Although it's  really good stuff, it would have been nice to perhaps have had a  documentary about Taymor's theatrical staging of Titus, or even the  director's cut (some stuff was apparently removed to avoid an NC-17).

I love films which are able to stare at the darkest side of humanity and even get  a chuckle or two out of what is presented (Clockwork Orange for example).  Julie Taymor (I can only hope she gets more chances to do this kind of  thing) was not  afraid to take big risks. For me the risks all paid  off.
It is easy to see why some say this is Shakespeare's  ""weakest"" play (some insisting he never even wrote it). The  subject matter, human cruelty and the urge to revenge are not easy to  acknowledge traits we like to speak about in ""polite"" society.  The terms ""morality play,"" or ""good vs. evil"" (who was  good in this story?) don't make sense to me in relation to this film.
The  Bard's poetry was powerful and accessible. I was engrossed from beginning  to end by the visuals, the acting (Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange are  magnificent as are others), and the visceral nature of the emotions  presented. I believe the film is meant to be timeless and does not jump  between Ancient Rome and Italy of Mussolini or any other modern setting.  The ""modern"" young boy is a touch of genius.

He declines the proffered emperor's crown,  nominating Saturninus, the last ruler's venal elder son. Saturninus, to  spite his brother Bassianus, demands the hand of Lavinia, Titus's daughter.  When Bassianus, Lavinia, and Titus's sons flee in protest, Titus stands  against them and slays one of his own. Saturninus marries the honey-tongued  Tamora, who vows vengeance against Titus.
