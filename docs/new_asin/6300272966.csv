292453,5,6300272966,If your a Cars fan like me you will love this VHS. This is at the height of their popularity. The late Benjamin Orr is amazing. Every song here is great. I think Heartbeat City is their best album. It is to bad that three years later they broke up. I belive as a group they had alot more to give to thier fans.,1362355200,5,310,3.859375
292454,5,6300272966,"This truly is an excellent compilation of hard work, time, and effort on the original group (RIP Benjamin Orr) that sounded different than anybody else for their time. The videos were historic and were the groundwork for what defined a theme-based generation. Surely the original, pristine master tapes must still exist somewhere. Like my review if you agree they need to be digitally transferred then issued on DVD",1351468800,17,415,5.117647058823529
292455,5,6300272966,"Wonderful music,most of all their big hits are in this collection. I have a copy and its over 25 years old and still plays real well.
  I don't know where they find these beautiful models and the ""r"" rated scenes are no offense to me.
8-20-14 Finally!-they released a DVD version and i got it because it looks a little cleaner and sounds better. It is just basically the same as the VHS copy i have- all the same songs and the making of with Andy Warhol-which is in itself nice to have.",1347840000,3,486,4.21505376344086
292456,5,6300272966,I have been a fan of The Cars for 21 years.  I am ordering this most excellent collection of Cars videos because I have worn out the one I bought upon its release in September of 1984!  The documentary with Ric  Ocasek and the late Andy Warhol at the end of the video is priceless!,942624000,6,281,4.072727272727272

7808148,3,6300272966,"5 starts for the music and the video themselves. 1 star for the quality of them, no effort was made apparently to remastering the video or audio which is very poor, like in the video for ""Hello Again"", after experiencing quality videos from Ultravox; these are pitiful. I never owned the japanese laserdisc so I can no compare to it. The one pro is that it was finally made available.",1484179200,,384,4.5
7808149,5,6300272966,"I own the fantastic quality original  80's Japanese Laserdisc edition of this title from and I confess that I wasn't expecting nothing out of this world from this DVD release, but it was a good surprise when I played it on my Denon 32 bit player! This Warner Archive DVD has excellent quality! Picture is crystal clear and sound quality is top quality too! Maybe the Japan Laserdisc has better colours, but if you cannot get a copy of the Japan LD you can buy this DVD-R from Amazon and enjoy this great compilation of 80's classics! I also think that Warner Archive is doing well in releasing stuff like this from the archives. More like this please!",1481500800,3,651,4.516949152542373
