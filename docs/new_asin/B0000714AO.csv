1798749,3,B0000714AO,"Serious times call for serious movies. This is truly a propaganda film. it is set during the Spanish Civil War, and sympathetic to the partisan side of the conflict. Its star, a very young Henry Fonda, is adequate to the task of a young man learning about the troubles of life. Filmed in glorious black and white, with no frills, and not much in the way of special effects, although, actually, they are not needed. The story, of course, is written for the screen, but is adequate for its purpose. All in all, an interesting look at Spanish Civil War and its history, a bit over wrought perhaps but informative. and the question needs to be asked is any movie about war overwrought?",1414627200,,681,4.544715447154472
1798750,4,B0000714AO,This otstanding 1938 movie part of Henry Fonda's film legacy confirms that the road to world war was paved not that long ago.,1412467200,,125,4.478260869565218

1798752,2,B0000714AO,"In the mid 1930s several film makers began to address the growing threat from fascism. Pro French films like The Story of Louis Pasteur (1935), Life of Emile Zola (1937), and Marie Antoinette (1938) appeared, and Hitchcocks Sabotage (1936) with Sylvia Sidney and Secret Agent (1936) with John Gielgud were even less subtle. But this film, produced in 1938, was the one of the first films to formally address the threat and it does so by attempting to portray the Spanish Civil War even while it was ongoing.

The Spanish Civil War began on July 17, 1936 with an attempted coup by fascist-backed generals against the elected government. The fascists, led by Franco, were backed by the Nazis and the Italians while the loyalists (Republicans) were backed by Russia and Mexico. The war ended on April 1, 1939 with the occupation of Madrid by the fascists

Henry Fonda (1905-82) plays a farmer who takes up arms against the invaders. AFI lists him as the 6th Greatest Male Star of All Time. He won one Oscar (On Golden Pond) and was nominated for 2 more (The Grapes of Wrath, 12 Angry Men), plus 3 Emmy nominations, 2 Golden Globe nominations, and he won a Tony for Mister Roberts (1948). This is one of his poorer roles. He is unconvincing as a Spanish farmer (although one year later he would be marvelous as an American farmer in The Grapes of Wrath)

Beautiful British born Madeleine Carroll (1906-87) plays a spy and Fondas love interest. She was a major star in the 30s, best known for her films with Hitchcock (The 39 Steps, Secret Agent) which won her a contract in the U.S. making films like The Prisoner of Zenda (1937) and Safari (1940).

Leo Carrillo (1881-1961) is best known as Pancho, the sidekick of The Cisco Kid in film and on TV. In this film he plays Fondas sidekick. For whatever reason Carrillo is very subdued in this film.

Vladimir Sokoloff (1889-1962) has a brief role as Carrolls father. Sokoloff was a terrific character actor and stole almost every scene he was in, in over 100+ films from 1926 to 1962. I remember him best as the village leader from The Magnificent Seven (1960), one of his last films.

British born Reginald Denny (1891-1967) plays a journalist. He was popular in the 30s with films like The Lost Patrol (1934), Of Human Bondage (1934), and Romeo and Juliette (1936). In the late 40s he made the switch to TV where he flourished.

German born director William Dieterle (1893-1972) was nominated for an Oscar for The Life of Emile Zola (1937) and at the Venice Film Festival for The Story of Louis Pasteur (1936) and Portrait of Jennie (1948). Personally I think his best film was The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939). This film is pretty poor. Dieterle seems uncomfortable with the action genre.

The writer John Howard Lawson (1894-1977) specialized in war films, especially involving the Navy, and was nominated for his first Oscar for this film. He was a founder of the Writers Guild and served as an ambulance driver in France in World War 1. But with the red scare in the late 40s, Lawson was identified as a communist and his career ended.

The production values in the film are poor, even given the time. At times they are even laughable. Poor production values may work in a drama or a love story, but in the action genre they are deadly.

The Spanish Civil War has been covered in dozens of films including The Spanish Earth (1937), Hemingways For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), Confidential Agent (1945), Fred Zinnemanns Behold a Pale Horse (1964), The Disappearance of Garcia Lorca (1997), and  The Devils Backbone (2001).

Leonard Maltin called the film a vivid romance drama. Variety said Blockade is a film with a purpose - a plea against war. But it misses any claim to greatness because it pulls its punches. The Classic Film, Guide called it a below average war drama. The NY Times lamented that it was mild. The film was criticized by various religious groups for being too leftist. It was criticized by others because it avoided identifying the two sides, and while we can assume that Fonda fights for the Republicans and the people starving and bombing the cities are the Fascists, its never made explicit.

1938 was a pretty good year for films. The top grossing films were You Cant Take it With You, The Adventures of Robin Hood, Boys Town, Alexanders Ragtime Band, Sweethearts, and Marie Antoinette. The Oscars were to You Cant Take it With You (Picture, Director), Boys Town (Actor), and Jezebel (Actress). Other notable films released that year were Algiers, Cagney and OBrien in Angels with Dirty Faces, John Garfields film debut in Four Daughters and Gable and Tracey in Test Pilot.

Bottom line  poor production values, wooden acting, and a convoluted script do not make for a good film. OTOH it is one of only a handful of films about the Spanish Civil War, although it is not historically accurate.",1361664000,2,4867,4.709411764705882

1798755,5,B0000714AO,"I watched this grand film a couple of months ago and I want to share my views with you.

Since a teenager I had read about this film, especially being one of its stars, Madeleine Carroll, an absolute favourite of mine...she shines brightly here, indeed.

I had read that this was one of the few or the only Hollywood film of the period that dealed with the Spanish Civil War, and not only that, 'cos it took sides with the Republicans, in other words, it portrays the Republicans as the heroes here.

To tell a long story short: after King Alfonso (Alphonse) XIII os Spain (grandfather of current King Juan Carlos (John Charles) I), was deposed by a Republican-Socialist Government?, Spain entered one of its most difficult times of its History; then the Civil War began, around 1936, with the Republicans (Socialists) on one side and Nationalists, lead by Francisco Franco on the other. Well Franco became Dictator Supreme in 1939, after he won the war, and mantained his position as such, until his death in 1975, when Democracy and Monarchy was restored.

Well, I was always so intrigued about this film,until I bought Image's DVD release in March, I hadn't seen until early June this year.

Henry Fonda plays a peasant who lives in a farm near the city-port of ""Castelmare"", he meets mysteriours foreigner Madeleine Carroll....the war begans...and the story goes on...

I must say that this film gained space and grew in my heart, with each passing moment, when the action, the war, the famine, grew more & more...it's greatly paced, photographed....by the underrated William Dieterle...who (what a coincidence!!) also was responsible for the breathtaking ""Portrait Of Jennie""...which is one of my ""top 5"" films.

Filmed in glorious B & W, with excellent supporting performances by Leo Carrillo, Reginald Denny and John Halliday (what a villain!!....I recommend to watch him too in Dietrich-Cooper's Borzage ""Desire"", produced by Lubistch)

Some sequences almost seemed to belong to the expressionist (german), neorrealist (italian) movements.

By the way, among the supporting cast, in small roles,I catched glimpses of Lupita Tovar (Susan Kohner's mother and the female star of 1931's spanish version of Lugosi's Dracula, in which the main character was played by Carlos Villaras) and Katherine DeMille (Cecil B. DeMille's daughter and Tony Quinn's first wife and an excellent actress too).

Henry Fonda, as usual, is excellent, his performance reminds me of his role in the great ""The Grapes of Wrath""...and Madeleine Carroll is equally grand.

The picture quality is very good. Image's releases have never ""deceived"" me. Their ""Evangeline"" release is great too.

Blockade is a Walter Wanger picture released thru United Artists.

After watching films like these, I feel great. 'Cos although it is a drama, in these hard times, it gives you hope that there's a chance for peace and justice in this messed-up world, if all people had the principles & views of Fonda's character.

BTW, Fonda's character's (Marco) last words (although much shorter; the film runs only 84 minutes) even (IMHO) have hints of Chaplin's final speech in ""The Great Dictator"",yet to come.",1095120000,22,3170,5.1063829787234045

1798789,3,B0000714AO,"This has passages edited out which reflected the Stalinist line, for example the denunciation by the Fonda character that the Franco forces were torturing and killing priests, killing nuns, and burning churches.  People who were enemies of the Franco side did that.  Enough was edited out to make it puzzling sometime as to who is on what side.

I can't get Fonda's final plea out of my mind right now.

1798795,5,B0000714AO,The movie was one of Hollywood's attempts to get the nation to help the forces fighting Franco.  The US at the time was heavy isolationist and the forces fighting Franco were communist.  Only the Russians helped some but that was limited.  There is the final Henry Fonda speech asking the world to come to the aid loyalist aid.  Good movie and recommend it.,1418860800,,357,4.619047619047619

7973720,3,B0000714AO,"The director of this movie claimed that it did not take sides and indeed the movie does not even identify the sides.  However those familiar with the Spanish Civil War can easily see that the movie is pro-Republican, anti-Nationalist.  I don't know what people unfamiliar with the history make of it.  Perhaps just that it is anti-war.  There are long shots of suffering women and children, stoic men enduring and war damage, but few dead people.  This is an almost bloodless movie war.  Most of the movie is about spies and traitors.  Leonard Maltin gave it 3 stars out of 4.  I like 3 stars out of 5.",1452902400,,602,4.5092592592592595
