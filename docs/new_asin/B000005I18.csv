7903376,5,B000005I18,"This has to be the most incredible video I have ever come across. It is called ""Shalom Shabbat"" and has an adorable cast including Chaim Topol (the Father in Fiddler on the Roof - I love him!) and Hanny Nachmias (she is an incredible teacher and a joy to watch). Both of them have the most beautiful, inspiring voices I have ever heard. The video is about students in a school on Friday afternoon and they sing and listen to stories until they go home. The story continues there as they enjoy a traditional Jewish meal. Here you will see the great joy and delight of the Jewish Sabbath!  The movie uses clay people to help illustrate the stories and will hold the delighted attention of both children and adults alike. Chaim Topol is an incredible story teller whether he is talking or singing. His song about a grandfather was absolutely touching and almost brought me to tears while the images behind him portrayed an elderly man with full beard, leaning over the Torah. His voice is incredible. I didn't want the movie to be over so when Hanny Nachmias and Chaim Topol faded in the end, I wanted them to come back and spend every Shabbos with us. And you know what? They can! All I have to do is rewind the tape.
 This movie was made in Jerusalem, has English dialogue and beautiful Hebrew songs. It is and worth every penny.",1007769600,,1328,4.460905349794238
