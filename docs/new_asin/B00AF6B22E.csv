5414842,4,B00AF6B22E,"""Flight"" is the first live-action Robert Zemeckis directed film since ""Cast Away"" back in 2000 and after viewing it you'll wonder why Zemeckis took so long to return to the format. This is the man who brought us the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" and ""Forrest Gump."" Despite how charming ""The Polar Express"" might be, Zemeckis kind of wore out the alluring nature of motion capture animation with the sub-par ""Beowulf"" and the decent enough ""A Christmas Carol."" Zemeckis is at his best with his live-action roots. ""Flight"" is also the first R-rated Zemeckis film in over 20 years.

Expectations going into this were somewhere along the lines of, ""So this is basically going to be Denzel Washington portraying Quagmire from 'Family Guy,' right?"" ""Flight"" is driven by alcoholism and the belief in God. Whip (Washington) is an alcoholic, but refuses to admit it. He drinks constantly, relies on cocaine to even him out, and tends to have sex with whoever he can. He has an ex-wife and a fifteen year old son who want nothing to do with him. Whip is eventually put under investigation with not only his job on the line, but jail time as well. Whip lands a plane that fell apart in the air; 96 of the 102 passengers lived because of Whip's incredible maneuvering in the sky, but alcohol was in his system so that's where the jail time could come in.

From the very first scene, you know that R-rating is going to be pushed to its limit as there's plenty of nudity, vulgarity, and drugs as soon as Whip is woken up by that phone call from his ex-wife early in the morning. It's not exactly groundbreaking, but there's this rushing close up of Washington's face as he does a line of coke before it jumps to the next scene that is pretty great. You're introduced to how serious Whip's addiction is as he takes oxygen hits before the plane takes off and dumps alcohol into his orange juice while he's talking to the passengers. This may be the performance of Denzel Washington's career as he finally seems to be stepping outside his comfort zone and delivering in ways you didn't expect going in.

The flight sequence itself is done in a very realistic way. It's already pretty intense when they're trying to get through the patch of rough weather, but turns into a white knuckled frenzy once the plane begins to malfunction. Your breath quickens as the events inside that plane become horrifying and the devastating aftermath will leave you completely breathless. You see Whip get pulled from the wreckage, but the film suddenly switches to first person and you see what Whip sees. It's pretty extraordinary.

The hospital scene is really emotional as Whip wakes up and is told the extent of not only his injuries, but the crash itself. As Whip talks to Charlie (Bruce Greenwood), there's this moment when Whip is smiling but tears begin to stream down his face that just breaks your heart. John Goodman is the funniest he's been since ""The Big Lebowski"" as Whip's friend Harling Mays. He plays interference for Whip during the investigation as he brings Whip everything he needs while reporters wait outside of his condo. On Whip's last night at the hospital, he steps onto the staircase to smoke and meets a heroin addict named Nicole (Kelly Reilly). The cancer patient they encounter in that stairwell (James Badge Dale) is the most entertaining character of the film and you'll wish there was more of him. He's extremely humorous and witty while offering a little bit of insight.

As the film progresses, Whip loses more and more control. It's kind of ridiculous what finally triggers Whip to realize things are bad. Losing his family didn't do it and neither did being responsible for six people losing their lives, but once blame is about to shift directions that's when Whip decides he's had enough. The film also teaches you that if you're incredibly drunk, you can just do a few lines of coke to even out. That bathtub full of cocaine you've got sitting at home will finally come in handy. The ending also feels like a bit of a cop out. It becomes more acceptable after you see it and you're looking back on it, but it still feels like a bit of a letdown.

""Flight"" slightly comes off as this glorified support video for AA, but the main (and even most of the supporting characters) are written so well that you can't help but sit back and enjoy the ride. It feels like Robert Zemeckis is finally back in full swing as Denzel Washington taps into some talent you may have forgotten he had. Gripping and sentimental, ""Flight"" puts one man's downward spiral on display to show that one broken man's journey can be pure intoxicating entertainment.",1351814400,,4672,4.684531059683313

5414859,5,B00AF6B22E,"Apart from technical aspects as the aerial acrobatics at the beginning and a personal side as Captain Whitakers problems, the movie is also a love story.  (Perhaps this aspect of the movie could have been made just a bit clearer?  Judging by the comments, it may have been wiser.)

Two incidents are especially relevant here.  The first is the Captains silent tears as he learns of the death of the stewardess Katerina with whom he was intimate.  A seasoned man, especially one as self-assured as Captain Whitaker, is unlikely to shed tears on the death of a woman with whom he was having just an affair.  The intimacy that was portrayed in the nude scene at the beginning of the movie (which many people found offensive and also unnecessary  going about bedroom chores nude without giving a second thought) also supports this (and presenting that intimacy was  in my opinion  the aim of that scene, particulary the way it was presented).  Given this, the death of Katerina would also have been at least partly responsible for the worsening of the Captains already dire problems.

But the first incident is a mere prelude to the more important second one, which in fact precipitated the movies finale.  When cornered with the hard choice of either tarnishing his lovers memory to save his own butt or sacrificing himelf to save that memory, the Captain chose the latter  by forcing himself not to succumb to the almost lifelong habit of lying to cover-up his objectionable habits.  The pain of going against a life-long habit would indeed be real.  Yes, God help him!  (The loss of Katerinas own life while attempting to save an innocent child has little to do with his final decision  but it would indirectly reinforce viewer-sympathy to that decision.)",1522195200,,1754,4.832214765100671

5414890,5,B00AF6B22E,"Im 15 and I know Im not old enough to watch r rated movies yet but tbh this movie was the best!  Im autistic and then simply fell in love with the beautiful flight attendant Katerina Marquez, played by Nadine velazquez from my name is earl. Nadine became my most inspirational role model and crush back in July and August by writing her quote stating to help teenage girls like me overcome tough times in their lives.
I wanted to cry when katerina was killed in the crash in the movie and on the funeral scene and those scenes were pretty dramatic to me.  But really denzel is amazing Ive seen him in the movie where he plays the football coach too.  The reason why l like katerina is that when my mum took me to Orlando on a plane, it was my first time flying up in th air and weeks later after our vacation, I felt inspired by this movie and planes but glad my pilot wasn't a drug addict nor alcoholic or otherwise be in the same situation like in the movie and the flight attendants were also nice on my plane too and thinking that they are kind and the best people that will care for you and make your flight happy so thats what i thought about all along.

5414894,2,B00AF6B22E,"I, too, am a fan, but had I known how the story unfolded, I would have made another choice,  being  familiar with different kinds of addiction and how they change one's life.

From the other reviews, I didn't grok how it was presented:  it opened up at the very beginning with alcoholism, casual sex without caring, love or
continuity, drug abuse, domestic abuse (not only his character, but others'),dysfunctional relationships with family and friends, and lies, lies,lies,
topped off with a wonderfully outrageous drug king played by John Goodman. We see the depravity in which this very talented pilot is living, but keeps hidden from coworkers and  friends, so it's like seeing behind the screen:  we, the audience are privy to his very worst, while those who respect and depend upon him are treated to his ""best.""

However, the apex of the story is his utterly amazing , intuitive rescue of this passenger jet with  fatal internal damage, landing it in an open field because there is no  where else for it, and managing to save all but a few people, costing 2 their lives,  the others injured.  That feat alone is so
awe-inspiring, it's almost worth the effort to watch the  very disturbing drama.  The crash, though, is what precipitates what is both  his downfall,
and salvation.  Lawyers, investigators, fellow employees, friends and officials circle round as the very professional investigation goes forth.  There is one utterly stunning dramatic moment, when, after lies, lies and continuing lies, right in front of the head official, his coworkers and friends, he hangs his head and says ""I just cannot tell one more lie.""  and finally admits that he was drunk during the flight, drunk the night before, and on  coke the night before.  The denouement is his  healing time in jail, not a very long sentence, considering, and the final scene is his estranged son
coming to visit him in jail , doing an interview on ""the father I never knew.""

I gave it a low rating only because I was not prepared for the long, very sordid lead up, not because of poor acting or story.  Could the producers have handled that differently?  I don't know and don't really care.  I am not condemning or judging, just expressing what was too uncomfortable for me.  You may find a different experience.",1510790400,2,2289,4.8076923076923075

The one-star reviews are what's known as 'adventures in missing the point'  his drunken debauchery IS the point  at least of the first 90% of the film ... or rather, of a descending percentage from beginning to end.

Geez. You can't complain about Denzel's character being a drunk when the whole point is that he's a drunk, and will he find a way out. AA and other progs of its kind speak of hitting rock bottom, 'the last house on the block,' and 'no matter what' precisely BECAUSE you have to do the first, find the second, and proceed on the basis of the third. That's what the movie is ABOUT.

From Dante to Willy Wonka the truth of all great human stories is 'You have to go down before you can go up.'

5414918,1,B00AF6B22E,"Oh my, WHY did I waste my time on this one?! I thought it might be worthy to spend 218 minutes on because of pilots and airline based film. I wanted to be a pilot growing up and love to fly so I rented this movie at the library. I'm SO glad I didn't spend a cent on it! This movie is a disgrace to the airline industry.
First of all, a co-pilot is going to report an intoxicated pilot! It was obvious that Denzel's character was intoxicated. The co-pilot even said later that he reeked of gin. Like I said, this movie made a complete farce of the airlines.
Pilots must be issued a medical certificate and must renew it regularly after an exam from an aviation medical examiner specifically licensed to give medical certificates. My dad was a road engineer (drove the trains) for Santa Fe RR for 30 years and had to pass a medical exam and alcohol/drug test each year by a physician who gave exams in accordance to Santa Fe guidelines. So Denzel Washington's character could not have been an alcoholic, druggie for years without the airline knowing it.
Well, Hollywood provides entertainment that is not always based in fact. It is not likely that a jet transport airplane would fly inverted for an extended period of time. Rolling a commercial airliner and flying for like that - very, very low chance. It was just not realistic.
The producers and directors couldn't even keep things consistent! Anyone who has any knowledge of airplanes would see that there is a MD-80 airplane in one scene and some kind of regional jet in another. They think we wouldn't notice?!
This movie had vulgar language, full nudity of one woman that added zero nothing to the movie. Outside of the airplane scenes, it was very boring. Denzel Washington's character was an arrogant, rude jerk.
I do not recommend this movie whatsoever. If you want to see a good airline movie, watch ""Sully"". That movie was fact-based and realistic.",1499040000,2,1909,4.617647058823529

The real story is not about that or even ""addiction"" it's about being trapped. Stuck in a place you can no longer control. The grind just like you are stuck, the routine, being controlled, having to have the JOB you hate, despise or required to do just to earn a paycheck to get you through the next week.

The escape comes in many different forms. Alcohol is the common denominator for most of the population. Ah, cocaine. and the Story is now packaged and ready for sale to the widest audience possible.

Still the struggle to be whom you dream to be continues and there is the story. You are him. Realize it as soon as possible and maybe one of you can escape the rat race as I have.

5414953,5,B00AF6B22E,"Flight is an outstanding  film drama from 2012 about addiction and chemical dependency. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, it includes among its stars Denzel Washington, Bruce Greenwood, Kelly Reilly, Don Cheadle, John Goodman, and Melissa Leo.

Captain William Whip Whitaker (Washington), a pilot for a fictional airline, is waking up early one morning in an airport hotel near Orlando, Florida. He is scheduled to pilot a jetliner from Orlando later that morning. Whip has a problem  he is hung over on alcohol and cocaine. That morning, he continues drinking and takes a hit of cocaine before departing for the airport.

Whips aircraft takes off in a downpour and experiences severe turbulence during the 52-minute flight.  Soon after takeoff, the jet experiences a catastrophic mechanical failure and begins a steep, uncontrolled dive from 30,000 feet. All of Whips impaired physical, mental, and psychological faculties are immediately and severely tested as he, along with his co-pilot, attempts to regain control of the jetliner

 Whip miraculously saves his aircraft by crash-landing it in a field. Six people (out of 102 on board) die. At first, the public hails Whip as a hero. However, as the investigations into the cause of the crash begin, it soon becomes evident that Whip was both drunk and high on cocaine.

Whip refuses to admit he has a problem, and continues to find refuge in a bottle. He befriends a heroin-addicted hooker who is struggling to reform her life. As Whips legal challenges mount, he tries to evade responsibility through denial, deceit, and manipulation. The questions become: will Whip ever stop lying and manipulating people long enough to admit he has a problem? And, will he ever face the consequences of the actions he took before and during that ill-fated flight?

I think Denzel Washington delivers one of the finest performances of his career in this outstanding film. I also think Flight is one of the best in a long line of movies about drug and alcohol addiction. John Gatins screenplay is intensely dramatic and captures the reality of alcoholism and drug addiction at a very personal level. The special effects in the crash scenes are truly amazing.

At a time when the focus of most movies seem to be fantasy, science fiction,  and pure action, its refreshing to find a film like Flight that concentrates on real-life issues faced by ordinary people. I thoroughly enjoyed Flight, and I think it ranks as one of the best pure dramas of recent years. Highly recommended.",1488844800,,2512,5.028915662650602
5414954,4,B00AF6B22E,"This is a good movie and it will keep you interested. Denzel Washington is one of the most intriguing actors that I have ever seen. He has a way of making you feel invested in characters and he is able to play many different character types very convincingly. This movie centers around a pilot whose plane ends up crashing. He saves most of the people onboard and is considered a hero. Then they discover that he may have been drunk at the time of the crash. All of a sudden, he is on trial. You will have to watch the movie to see if he ends up going to jail or not. Personally, I did not feel like the movie ended the way that I wanted it to, but I also felt like it was the right ending for the film.",1488758400,5,703,3.99290780141844

5415000,3,B00AF6B22E,"I was really surprised by this film I thought it would be more upbeat and positive more like the Sully film.  Flight is anything but a happy go lucky feel good flick.  Denzel Washington is without a doubt one of the best actors in Hollywood but it was hard to watch him in this film.  It is not that Denzel hasn't played a bad guy before in movies just watch Training Day but he does so well in films as the lead hero character.  It is kind of like watching John Wayne play the villain, you still want to root for him and see him succeed even if he is made out to be the bad guy.

The film really has a great cast besides Denzel you have John Goodman, Don Cheadle, Bruce Greenwood, Kelly Reilly and all the pieces fit together.

I always like films that try and take a more realistic point of view.  Seems like everything coming out nowadays is made out to be fantasy with all green screen technology and I enjoy watching a movie based in reality where the physics of the regular world come into play.  Maybe this film is more honest in its depiction of what actually happens.  I doubt that most airline pilots are alcoholics or do tons of cocaine but who is to say that it could not happen.  Pilots are human just like the rest of us.

I am pretty sure that the majority of regular airline pilots do have romantic relationships with their stewardess simply because of the traveling schedules they are always on.

The pivotal part of the movie is Denzels testimony in front of a grand jury summoning.

Overall the film never really grabbed me and made me love watching the movie.  It is a little bit like Monsters Ball in that regard where the acting is good but the subject matter is kind of morbid.  I would rate this movie 3  stars.  It is not bad film but it definitely is not a classic Denzel Washington movie either.  The high drug and alcohol abuse will really turn off a lot of viewers.",1482883200,,1894,4.272471910112359

5415046,3,B00AF6B22E,"I like Denzel Washington but this movie is kind of boring still. I watched it as I'd recently watched Clint Eastwood's Sully film. Washington is a superior actor to Tom Hanks despite them both having the baggage of us having seen them on screen for closing in on half a century, which let that sink in. Unfortunately, he's saddled with the inferior director who hasn't been on and behind the camera for over half a century, which I guess just give that time. It's not that he doesn't give it his best.

Washington let down terribly by the direction and the writing. I know from having worked with various people with addiction problems that they often change their favorite addiction within minutes. Here, they ham that up. Flight is a strangely artless film. It's got all the subtlety of sitting on bed of tacks covered in hot sauce without pants. Literally all the class comes solely from Washington. Eastwood's Sully film had similar issues but was so low key it was easy to ignore. Washington has no such luck here.

The other actors are equally good. It's the sort of movie where I feel bad for the actors and crew while wondering what the producers, director, and writers were thinking. I think the vast majority of the people on this movie outside of the 2 groups and director I just mentioned understood what to do and did their best. It's amazing how much can be destroyed by a handful of people.",1474848000,,1405,4.5936254980079685

5415091,5,B00AF6B22E,"...to this film!

Denzel Washington was seriously robbed an Oscar for this role because we all know the Academy is racist... (just kidding? Will Smith/Jada did not force me to say that. Go easy on me). But honestly, Denzel gave so much incredible performance range in this film that the Academy really take him for granted. Daniel Day-Lewis won Oscar that year instead (for playing Lincoln), but it's a shame because, underneath that high quality cosmetic makeup and all, playing Lincoln is just really being a lethargic person! It's really nowhere near Denzel's level of incredible wide range of emotions portrayed in his character, where he so genuinely pulled off in this film. Actually, everyone in this film is fantastic.

You will not believe the female actress in this film, Kelly Reilly, is actually British! Wow. Also the guy playing the smoking cancer patient (James Badge Dale), a very memorable powerful scene (he deserves some sort of award just for that scene!), is extremely convincing; it really doesn't seem like he's acting at all!

While the beginning flight scene has the most incredible intense action sequence, if you're expecting to see just a film about a pilot and airplanes and have low attention span/just want more action/blowup action/Air Force One film, this is NOT for you.

If you enjoy character study and deep psychological discussions, this is for you.

This film is about addiction (alcohol and drugs) and has some interesting religious undertone to it. Do things happen for a reason? We all question it. If you are or know someone in denial living a lie, this can be a compelling film for you too.

The climax of the film does NOT need any explosions or action to give the viewers an emotional ride - the whole dilemma the character has to face is just very intriguing.

This is really a beautiful engaging film. This film is dark, but Zemeckis really knows how to throw in comedy too. There were some cheesy moments (the fridge scene), but overall, it's a very powerful film.

Robert Zemeckis is a genius. He also directed Back to the Future and Forrest Gump... Flight is easily another classic. I really love how Robert Zemeckis is not just a director that knows how to make great action and comedy, but really understands and shows the viewers the deeper levels of human emotion.",1467504000,,2319,4.838383838383838

5415122,3,B00AF6B22E,"This is a good movie, but it can't quite decide on what tone it wants to set.  On the one hand we have Denzel Washington turning in a great performance as an airline pilot with a plane-full of substance abuse issues.  Though his foibles are well known to many of his colleagues, he flies under the radar, so to speak, until his superior skills as a pilot prevent a crash from being infinitely worse.  OK so far, though the idea of flying a DC-9 inverted is a bit much, and somehow most of the plane is later seen in a hanger largely intact and free from fire damage.

But so what? - creative license is just that.  But I just couldn't believe John Goodman's character, much less the part he plays later in the movie when the Heroic Captain is about to go before the National Transportation Safety Board.  He's first there for comic relief, later as a plot parachute so that the filmmakers can have it both ways.

In the end, the surrounding characters become cliches - the morally malleable lawyer (Don Cheadle, doing a great job), the loyal former Navy Air buddy (Bruce Greenwood), the girlfriend trying to straighten herself out, who ultimately has to go her own way (not before leaving a card, which Kelly O'Reilly does), and the bottom-line obsessed airline owner (Peter Gerity).  Let's not forget Tamara Tunie as one of the surviving flight attendants with a conscience, and her designer little boy.

In the end, it's too bad that the film couldn't be as nuanced as Washington's performance.  Alcohol and drug abuse among pilots is a serious and under-reported subject, which with a could have stood on its own with a deft script without wash-ashore and cardboard characters.",1464220800,,1680,4.683673469387755

5415142,4,B00AF6B22E,"A powerful movie with excellent acting and direction.  This movie is really about addiction, stuffed into the story of an airline accident, blended together with another person's life of addiction.  If anyone who has experienced someone with an addiction problem, this movie hits the nail on the head.  The main theme seems to be the public trust that an airline pilot has in his or her profession, and you certainly don't show up drunk to fly a plane. People with addiction problems will probably feel that they can fly a plane drunk, and drive drunk, and ruin other people's lives because they have that monkey on their back, and the only thing that makes that monkey feel good, is another drink, hit, or toke. John Goodman's character is there to show/reveal that the only thing that can make Denzel's character function after a night of intoxication, is a cocktail of drugs that will even out the alcohol, and allow him to function at a nominal level.  All of the lies, denying, and violence is part of the addition process. Only when someone gets help and admits that they are an alcoholic, will the process of healing begin, but it is a lifelong process that very few people can recover from, and that monkey is always there resting on the back side, waiting to be fed.
A very good movie, that was done with great taste, and sends a powerful message about addiction.  It makes one wonder just how many people are flying, driving, and traveling while intoxicated.",1462060800,9,1468,4.696498054474708

5415167,4,B00AF6B22E,"I still can't get over the feeling that after having watched this entire movie I was duped for a ""bait-and-switch"" of story.  However, I can only blame myself for only watching the flashy trailer and not reading the entire description of the movie.

If you have seen the trailer and think you are in for a wild action-packed ride of a movie, *think again*.  Then read the description.  The best way I can describe this movie is it is an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting set to a story line.  AND, the reason for the events that happen in the beginning of the movie have nothing to do with the main character being an alcoholic or being drunk during the event.

After the first rip-roaring action-packed 15-20 minutes of the movie, you are left with a slightly romantic story about an alcoholic and a drug addict.  While this movie will certainly give you insights as to how certain alcoholics and drug addicts behave and the lifestyles they lead, it doesn't get any more exciting than that.  Another insight it gives you is into how corporations will go to great lengths to protect an employee so as to limit their liability (as if you needed another example.)

My only other complaint about this film is the extremely gratuitous frontal nudity at the very beginning of the film.  It is so not needed to establish what the characters were doing and once again leads you to believe this is going to be an action-packed, nudity-filled movie.",1456963200,2,1435,4.658730158730159

The plane landed with more ease than the story structure and character arc, and the theme was lost until I watched it the third time.

This should be up in the top 5 movies for Washington, as usual he is a commanding force in all of his efforts to become the role. The funny parts of this movie are slipped in with such actuality it takes you off guard. Best movie I've seen in years. I have already watched it 3 times which is rare for me. Every actor deserves the best reviews for their parts. The movie did what all should do, take you right into the scene and story and you can't believe it is ending so soon.",1443139200,,654,4.232

The gut wrenching pain I saw on denzel washingtons face was real.  The girl that plays his girlfriend is really good.  I saw her in ""Heaven is for Real"", and she was Vince Vaughn's girl friend in the latest True Crime series.  So to see her in this gritty portrayal of a heroine user was strange, but she does a fabulous job.  In this day and age when so many people have issues, and addictions to see their pain hit home.  I have an ex who was an alcoholic, and he is in his 29th year of prison.  So at the end of this movie I was crying.  I have a few movies that I can watch over and over and this will be one of them.",1440720000,2,752,3.9271523178807946

I watched the movie ten times already and there is a missing and quite important question for me that was not dealt with in the ""jail confession"" with the other inmates.  Why five years?  100 plus people lives were saved (I do not condone the premises of drinking and drugs while actively flying) and wasn't the public trust withheld hence?  I think that there ought to be a sequel to this remarkable story where the lawyers will make the case either way where the family of the ones who survived will give their teatimonies nd whereupon Ellen block will, despite herself, will talk about mitigating circumstances and where finally the truth will be the meaning of Katrina's death (ok my bad that was the movie) a self promise to be better just to be better for a better and just cause. I would pay fifty dollars to watch the pro and con of a court battle with Kevin spacey either pro or con sentencing. My verdict: loss of license yea. Rehab yea.

5415366,5,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington's character is an alcoholic & drug addict who, during an airplane malfunction, saves the lives of his passengers when the plane crashes in, ""Flight"".  I am usually an exclusive lover of science fiction, fantasy, or military- cop action films alone.  Rarely ever do I even see a drama movie nor enjoy one as much as I did watching this.

 Going into this movie I expected the film to be about the mechanics of what happened during and after a civilian airliner crash, but instead I found a movie that was a deep character drama about a man with incredibly powerful demons.  Even though Denzel's character isn't always the greatest person in the world, often times acting like an irresponsible out of control party animal addicted to sex, cocaine, and alcohol, you as the audience member and fan of Mr. Washington's work are drawn to him and spellbound by his coolness.

  That is the power, the dynamic magnetism, and the true soul driven depth that Denzel brings to ANY movie he is placed in that makes ""Flight"" a very enjoyable film.  You see and feel the extreme emotions and ups and downs of a man who is an addict and loses complete control of himself, often not only hurting his own life but the lives of others around him.

  When Denzel saves everyone on board an airplane that faces serious mechanical trouble in mid flight, he wakes up to find that he is not only still alive but also a subject of an intense investigation due to his toxicology report indicating he had been under the influence of alcohol while in control of the plane.  The real questions morally are brought him and debated with in his character's soul, does he take responsibility?  Does he truly wish to rid himself of his demons and stop his drug use?  These are the powerful elements and mountains he must climb in the film.

  We find ourselves rooting for him all the time, especially when he out wits and stands up to the low class LOSERS who live on the fringes of our society such as the pimp and landlord who tries to push over a young prostitute he meets from the hospital.

  Over all I give this movie a big A- and two thumbs up.",1432252800,,2138,4.515625

5415368,3,B00AF6B22E,"At first glance thanks to trailers and teasers the movie appears to focus on an ill-fated plane flight, however in actuality the movie's main focus is truly about what comes afterwards. The movie itself is very powerful with the high quality of acting that you would expect from those in the cast, but if you were looking for a ""plane flying"" movie, you might find yourself disappointed as that is only a minor part of this movie.",1431734400,,430,4.597402597402597

Denzel Washington is ALWAYS good, and is one of my favorite actors.  He portrayed a very believable hero and anti-hero.  His drunken scenes were superb and so well-acted, you could believe he was an actual alcoholic. The redemptive final scenes made you love him even more.  And John Goodman!  Whew!  Too awesome!

5415416,5,B00AF6B22E,"'Flight' took me on an unexpected journey.  While not being at all what I expected, what it became was more than one could hope for.  Having life-long addictions and being proficient at hiding them is something more people face than we all realize.  The fact that it was a pilot flying 102 'souls' while under the influence of alcohol and drugs simply amplified and publicized a problem so many people face today.  How many times have you gotten in your car, strapped your children's seatbelts and driven somewhere under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  This story is about us, we are all pilots of our own lives and often connect with others, sometimes with tragic results.  Denzel Washington's portrayal of 'Whip' was raw and beautiful.  To so clearly demonstrate what this pilot must have felt had to be difficult at best.  I've never been moved enough to write a review before, but for 'Flight', I had little choice.  That said, Id give the movie four stars and the stars of the movie five if I could.  Watch 'Flight', it'll do you good and entertain you at the same time.

Denzel was PERFECT in it, his leading actress was amazing!

I will say that I grew up around alcholics and drug addicts. It was hard and for some odd reason the memories of my childhood were floating in and out.
To FINALLY see a movie that is REALISTIC about what REALLY happens in the loves of people with problems was great!

Predicting a mid-story lull in a Zemeckis piece doesn't take a film critic. And no one missed the foreshadowing of the father-son reunion. I was moved by how much identity and power the actor and his director were able to give to the addiction. I watched him walking toward the daylight only to be engulfed by darkness. I felt her fear for her own life and gain strength through admission of weakness. I felt the grace coming from all around him as he continued to dance with his demons. Very good acting and direction. Some unnecessary inclusion. For me, and millions like me, the most heart-wrenching predictability was watching the 'adjoining room' relapse with tears in my eyes. Powerful scene.

Everyone considers him to be a Hero but the investigation reveals that someone on board had two bottle of some alcohol in the flight when due to bad weather it was not served on board. The airline company tries their best to save Denzel by trying to keep him sober and making him lie that the person who had those bottles of rum was an on board flight attendant who died in this crash. But Denzel confesses in the court that he is the one who was drunk and was given life imprisonment. Irony is that he saved hundreds of lives but still charged as murderer.

Surely, The opening scene of the movie is excellent but lets not be fooled here folks. The film is exceptional for everything that happens AFTER that sequence.

Denzel Washington delivers a stunning performance. All hands on deck for a man and actor who delivers his character wholeheartedly in this epic drama about substance abuse and the lives affected by it. Its not just the addicted that suffers, but all those that love them also. This movie, its cast of characters, the struggles, the pain, and the anguish are all evident and played out well. The script was an amazing piece of work, compassionate, funny, and emotional. This movie is certainly worth the watch, for sure, it did bring tears to me eyes...as the stunning confession play out in a federal NTSB investigative review. Mr. Washington's riveting reality and confession ends in freeing himself from the disease which has controlled his entire life. This movie should be watched by those who struggle with substance abuse. Excellent!",1425772800,6,928,5.152317880794702
5415807,1,B00AF6B22E,"There is so much wrong with this movie, that it's hard to know where to begin. SPOILER ALERT--do not read if you think you might want to see Flight.

First, the good:

1.  Denzel Washington is an amazing actor and he made you believe that he WAS that character.
2.  The flying-before-the-crash sequence was gut-wrenchingly believeable.

That was it for the good.

Now, the bad:

1.  There is absolutely NO WAY for a pilot to have been that far gone in drugs/alcohol to have ever been able to fly a plane.
2.  There are drug checks. He would have been caught, again, for the reason in #1.
3.  There is not a co-pilot alive who would have admitted (during the hospital scene) that the pilot reeked of alcohol and yet continued on as though nothing was wrong, ESPECIALLY as the two had never flown before. There's not a chance that anyone is so afraid of being considered a ""narc"" that he would risk his own life.
4.  I find it extremely hard to believe that the drug and alcohol equipment wasn't calibrated, etc, giving the pilot a way to have the results disqualified. No way would that have occurred, not with so many lives on the line.
5.  While Denzel Washington is an amazing actor, he was not in ""beefcake"" condition for this film. You can argue that he's an older pilot and that the glimpses of his nudity were needed, but seeing his flabby ass through the hospital gown and his rolls when he went shirtless just didn't add anything to the film. I think his ego may be as out of shape as his body since most actors of his stature could have squashed those glimpses.. Having said that (and no, I would not do well in front of a camera, but at least I know it), I do have to say that it's refreshing to see guys having to do nudity now instead of just the usual female t&a. Long live equality! (let's just improve the quality)
6.  In the scene in the hotel room, right before his hearing, you see DOZENS of smashed up bottles. If he had actually imbibed that much alcohol, he'd have been in an irreversible coma or dead. Yes, he's an alcoholic and can put away more than 99.99% of the population, but there is ability and there's credibility. This was not credible.
7.  At the hearing, he suddenly has his ""OMG"" moment and confesses, saves the reputation of a DEAD woman (who won't contradict him)  and damns himself.. Uh, what? Considering he was s***-faced right before this hearing and had to have drugs to ""pep"" him back into shape, the one thing he would never, ever believably have done was to not save himself.
8. The cuddle-bear nature of his dealer. Again, WHAT? And worse, two men (the lawyer and pilot's union rep) ARE GOING TO CALL A DRUG DEALER TO PROTECT AN INEBRIATED/DOPED-UP PILOT? Oh, I so don't think so.  Two more people who would stake their reputation on a guy who could have killed 102 folks instead of 6 if they were caught helping him lie (not to mention getting the drug dealer)? Holy crap, Batman! This looks like the work of a brain-dead writer or regular Hollywood resident.
9.  My favorite...the plane goes down, more or less nose first, and the two pilots are still alive yet folks in the back die? That front end would have been a crumpled up accordion if it had landed the way they'd shown.
10. A close runner-up to #9:  when they show the plane in the field, THERE ARE BARELY ANY MARKS IN THE GROUND. This plane made an emergency/hard landing and yet left the grass for next week's mowing??

I could go on, but I think you get the point. If this film had been located somewhere else (and if the ""hero,"" and I use the term very loosely, had been a teacher, or a doctor, etc, etc), then his descent into drug hell and his later self-salvation would have been a true 5 star all around. As it is, I'm glad I didn't pay to see it but got it through a subscription; however, no one will ever be able to repay me my lost 2+ hours watching it.",1425772800,,3872,4.352777777777778

5415926,5,B00AF6B22E,"Flight is not about an airliner crash. It is not an action film, or a thriller. It's about an extraordinary man, blessed with many transcendent gifts; a loving family and friends, heroic ancestors, and marvelous piloting skills. But he is also cursed with implacable demons, not the least of which are drug and alcohol addictions. The question the movie asks us is this; does that man have the courage to conquer his demons with the same courage he has shown in the face of seemingly certain death in an airliner he is piloting?

Flight is a well written and directed film, but it is also a somber, cerebral, and contemplative film filled with interesting characters, played by fine actors and actresses at the top of their arts. If you are looking for stereotypical heroes, thrilling scenes, and fast paced action look elsewhere. If you want to reflect on the human condition, Flight is a film to see.

Would I watch it again? Yep.

And then, a deeply multi-woven human being emerged and gave us a movie ride so worth taking.  High fives for touching on our humanness and dilemmas - hard choices - and how hard one can fight and struggle and what that costs to a life.  Fine acting, directing, and an opportunity to bear witness.  The power of this film is still with me and I expect I'll continue recommending it.",1424476800,,535,4.771739130434782

5416022,3,B00AF6B22E,"Whats It About?

Only one man could have saved the passengers of Flight 227, and the survivors are grateful that Captain Whip Whitaker is on board when their plane suffers catastrophic equipment failure. The problem is, Whip is an alcoholic with a penchant for cocaine, and before he gets into the cabin, hes higher than the plane will ever get.

What Did I Think?

Flight asks a simple question: how do you measure a man's worth? By his deeds or by his honesty?

Its a tumultuous journey that just happens to include a plane ride that will give your sphincter its exercise for the day. Flight is more a parable about being true to yourself than air crash investigations. Thankfully, Denzel Washingtons nuanced performance of a man in a terminal downward spiral is entrancing. Without his strong performance, Flight could easily have gone straight to video.

The music, while outstanding (The Rolling Stones & R&B classics), is used a little heavy handedly. But the direction, effects & supporting actors are high quality.

A good movie, but not a great one.",1423872000,,1058,4.85

5416028,5,B00AF6B22E,"Flight is stars Denzel Washington. It is a story about Whip Whitaker, an airline pilot who miraculously crash lands his plane after it suffers an in-flight mechanical failure and manages to save most of the people on board. The Academy Award nominated screenplay was loosely based on the actual events of the 2000 crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 that left no survivors behind.

Whip Whitaker is a seasoned airline pilot. While flying a plane from Florida to Georgia,the engines fails and got into a mid-air catastrophe. Realizing that they won't make it to the runaway,he decided to roll the plane upright and make a controlled landing in an open field at Clayton County. He loses consciousness and was taken to the hospital. When he awakens in an Atlanta hospital with moderate injuries,he is greeted by his old friend Charlie Anderson,who represents the airline's pilots union. After that meeting,the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) official informs him he manages to save ninety-six out of one hundred two people on board and they are conducting an investigation behind the accident. Aside from the NTSB investigation,we also get to see Whip coming into grips with reality particularly with his addiction to drugs and alcohol.

Too bad that many men would probably enjoy the first few minutes of the film due to Nadine Velasquez's nude scenes and find it the only reason to see the film. Others who disliked the film due to the fact that it only told the story of Whip coming into accepting the fact that he needs help with his alcohol and drug addiction. But there is more to reasons why one should see it. First,it was a thoughtful and provocative study of a dark character in Whip Whitaker. Aside from his addictions,we also get to see him develop redeeming qualities in the end such as humility and he becomes a better person particularly as a father who started to develop a better relationship towards his estranged son. Secondly,we get to see a movie that portrays the effects of addiction very well and how it damages one's character and the relationships with others. Finally,it consists of great performances from the cast especially Denzel Washington,whose Academy Award nominated performance is well-deserved as he portrayed Whitaker very well that viewers will definitely empathize with him and with the crosses that the character is bearing. He truly elevated this film into greater heights especially when he was caught in a moral dilemma while at the NTSB hearing. Overall,this is one good character-driven film about addiction that one should see.",1422921600,,2583,5.046838407494145

I was very refreshed by this movie.  At times it seems to glamorize Whip's drug and alcohol addictions, almost making him so invincible and awesome that he can cruise through life drunk and still be awesome.  At other times, it's very UN-glamorous and reveals how his addictions are only ever bad, and how they hurt him and others.  Really, it's hard to imagine anyone other than Denzel nailing both halves of that performance (bad boy badass, and humble breakdown).",1421971200,,690,4.947826086956522

5416041,3,B00AF6B22E,"This is a re=telling of the Alaska Air crash of a similar plane that went down in the Pacific off the coast of Los Angeles or San Francisco. The Alaska Air plane was giving the pilots trouble in that they could not control the ""Elevator"" (the horizontal part of the tail of the plane which makes the plane ascend or descend).  The Alaska Air crew tried to free it with disastrous results.  Procedures now in effect say to get the plane on the ground as quickly as possible. No troubleshooting in the air. In the Alaska Air crash it was discovered that the ""Jackscrew"" ( a threaded part which is long enough to allow the elevator to swing from X number of degrees to X number of degrees had not received the lubrication that the manufacturer set forth. The result was that the ""jackscrew"" stripped the threads and pieces of metal (stringers) was preventing the elevator from ""smoothly"" going up (to descend) or ""smoothly"" going down (to ascend). The real life tragedy was that an Alaska Air machinist (read maintenance technician) wrote that the ""jackscrew"" was to be replaced, due to his inspection of it. The next shift of workers came on and the foreman ""vetoed"" the earlier techs order to change the jackscrew. The result of the flight which originated in mexico and was on its way to a west coast city was the ""jackscrew"" did not break but it caused a single large ""Nut"" on the bottom to break away and the result was the elevator of the plane was allowed to remain in an 'attitude which made the Alaska Air plane dive toward the ocean. The pilots also ""Inverted"" the Alaska Air plane but could not control it. There was no saving the plane and no pilot, regardless of his experience would have been able to get the plane even to a crash landing. An aircraft that hits the water at speed is like hitting a solid surface.",1421625600,,1824,4.507552870090635

5416048,3,B00AF6B22E,"I feel duty bound to reference how Black Women are portrayed in this movie. First Black Women are superficially religious and  try to use religion to tie manly men to their apron strings as portrayed by Margaret. Secondly Black Women don't appreciate provision from their husbands and don't require their children to respect their fathers, because they themselves don't respect them. Referring to the scene where the Black ex wife allowed her son to cuss his father out and demand he leave the home that the father provided, when all the man was seeking was moral support. A moral women would have given her ex husband and father of her children some moral support during such a tremendous crisis; and kicked her son out for disrespecting his father, when it was totally unnecessary. The Bible says ""Honor Thy Mother AND Thy Father"" period. The Black man had to turn to a White Man's wife and family to help him.  Thirdly, the only thing the Black son was interested in for visiting his father was doing a paper to gain financial aid for his college when his father had been destroyed and sent to prison. It was as if the outstanding achievement his father indisputably a accomplished meant nothing as an example for his son. No wonder the man used drugs. He was a hell of a man, but only a man nevertheless.",1421452800,,1308,4.633620689655173

I tried to finish the movie, but I just couldn't make it after the first hour. It's long and stretched out. It's not a bad movie, I just need more action.",1420588800,,328,3.984848484848485

Zemeckis has made better films than this one, which suffers from with an all too predictable climax, but it's very solid, with good performances across the board and an in-flight sequence that is genuinely well done, terrifically scary...I wouldn't watch the whole thing again, but there are places in it, where the filmmaking and acting is bravura.",1420416000,,816,5.135338345864661

5416102,1,B00AF6B22E,"Boring. The scenes in the plane are good, but before and after the crash the scenes get long and drawn out. The next 90 minutes or so was like the same scene over and over again: he gets drunk, acts like a jerk, and lets down or hurts those who care about him. There are two stories here: 1) he's being charged with flying drunk, and 2) he's an alcoholic jerk. Throughout the movie he isn't really trying to recover from his drinking problem, he's just hiding it, so that part isn't really much of a story anyway. Without all the filler this story could have been told in under an hour.

And as others have mentioned, the use of F-bombs was gratuitous.",1420329600,4,652,4.300813008130081

In fact, I stopped it 3 or 4 times over several weeks because, I reasoned that no story was good enough to have to wade through all that filth.  However, I came back to it out of curiosity and fast-forwarded through as much of that garbage as I could to try to catch the gist of the aviation adventure.  The flying part of the story was fantasy after all.  I'll never say it was an impossible feat, but, let's face it, no one could have done that, not even a ""few good men.""

However, the last 5 minutes of the movie make the rest of the movie make sense, It is so powerful, maybe one of the best scenes in movie history, and then you are left wondering about your own soul.

So, when u see a movie like this, maybe not a blockbuster, but a good, well written, interesting story with great actors, you notice.  I give this movie top billing because just very recently,  I've seen some very bad duds, mainly the ones with Octomom (yes her) that were difficult to even watch.  Octomom's whiny voice and acting is what u expect = OMG x awful x infinity.  However, John Goodman in this movie is excellent and deserves a big nod, as he played his character to a tee.  You almost want to know a person like the one he plays in real life.  Like almost everything he does, he comes off as genuinely likable and/or lovable.  Also worth mentioning was Don Cheadle.  I really liked him in his role and was another example of great acting.  I would recommend Flight to others.

5416319,4,B00AF6B22E,"The brief description didn't sound promising. My wife said she had no interest so I added Flight to my watch list on a whim and ran it while she was traveling with her sister. What a stunning show. I've read criticisms of the portrayal of the airline industry and how those characters are portrayed. But after decades of watching movies mutilate my interests (bicycling and motorcycling) I've given up hope of seeing accuracy. Besides, it doesn't matter. This film is about a man coming to grips with his drug and alcohol dependency and their impacts on him and those around him. As a recovering alcoholic and addict with more than 30 years' sobriety I found this story line to be achingly accurate. It's a phenomenal character study, expert in every facet. It would be five stars but for a minor glitch in pacing; it bogs a bit in the middle. Not sure my wife will ever watch or, if she did, if she would have my appreciation for the power and beauty of this story-telling effort.",1418860800,,981,4.579545454545454

5416356,1,B00AF6B22E,"Flight is a movie obviously made to glorify falling down drunk, alcoholic and cocaine snorting pilots. For the life of me, I can't figure out why the boozed & drugged up captain is the hero. Somehow, in the world of wild fantasy, even though high on coke & boozing it on board, he miraculously lands the plane after taking off in weather that only a complete fool would fly in. I guess the moral of the movie is that drunk & high pilots can perform miraculous deeds & land any jet in any situation even if the wings fall off. I have no idea what the director was thinking, other than he wants to glorify drug use and drunks who fly jets. Perhaps he is a junkie & a an alcoholic too, who knows? For the bulk of the movie, we are asked to feel sorry for the poor coke head pilot because he saved most of the the passengers. Frankly, I found myself despising him & hoping that he got life in San Quentain. So, if your are addicted to cocaine & an alcoholic, the message here is that you can become a professional pilot & fly while jacked up & spaced out out of your mind. I'm sure crack house residents & skid row alkies would just love this film as it excuses criminal behavior. The pilot seems petulant, childish & encourages people to lie about the facts of the crash. He also feels sorry for himself as he was divorced & has a kid to support. Flight is a real stomach turner. It made me want to burn the CD. Don't waste your time unless your high on coke or drunk.",1418256000,3,1465,4.161971830985915

5416428,5,B00AF6B22E,"(possible spoiler)  Denzel Washington and the rest of the cast is excellent in this movie.  The movie portrays the struggle of an airline pilot who relies on substance to ""stay focused"".  It is at best arguable whether or not his substance use is putting his passengers in direct danger even though it is immoral and wrong and definitely illegal-  this becomes clear when he decides to pour 3 mini vodka's in his bottle of orange juice shortly before take off the morning after a sleepless night and is able to miraculously land a failing aircraft with minimal loss of life..  He is hailed as a hero until investigators go a little bit further into the investigation and determine facts that uncover what is to that point a problem he's been denying.  We then learn about just how much of a problem he has and whether his courageous and life saving actions should outweigh and eradicate the immoral decision and legal consequences of operating a commercial airliner under the influence.

This movie will have you questioning what you would do in the position of each cast member and has an ending that really justifies the efforts of the rest of the movie.  I enjoyed it very much and would definitely recommend it to others.",1417478400,,1225,4.71830985915493

He (Denzel Washington) spends the entire movie drinking his life away and making bad choices (yes, we get it, he has a problem. We don't need it drilled into our heads for 2 hours) while everyone tries to save him. Finally he goes to jail by choice (he could have gotten off with one word and no consequences, which is completely unlike the character for the rest of the movie. And no, he hadn't ""changed"") and finds redemption in AA in life in prison. WTF? The movie also goes to great lengths to show that even though he was smashed and on drugs, that he was really a hero because no one else could have landed that plane. So it was really all about his battle with himself because he could totally fly airplanes GREAT while out of his mind. WTF? The movie must have been paid for by a rich AA member looking for glory, because that is the only audience that has any business watching this movie.

5416482,5,B00AF6B22E,"This intense, compelling, drama, unfolds with a catastrophic airplane accident and instead of healing and being grateful to be alive, the human trauma takes off and accelerates. Academy Award winning Actor - Denzel Washington stars, and is absolutely mesmerizing as Captain Whip Whitaker, a seasoned, commercial Airplane Pilot, who lives his life on the very edge. An affair with the Flight Attendant - Katerina Marquez complete with alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, beer and a co-dependent association with a drug dealer who charges much and then..., snorts and sniffs right along with his clientele, makes for some interesting dynamics. In addition, Captain Whitaker is a divorced husband and father and his relationship with his ex-wife and only child and son, is worse than estranged. On top of that, unresolved issues and memories of his late father, who was an Air Force Pilot turned crop duster - who taught him how to fly, still haunt him. And, after his girlfriend Trina (Katerina), the Flight Attendant gets killed, he helps out and temporarily finds comfort in the arms of a drug addict, named: Nicole. A woman, who nearly overdosed on heroin. But, he is so 'out of control' with his own acute alcoholism and various drug addictions, as well as an invincible mindset, Nicole - who has joined a support group to stay clean... leaves him, so that she won't be tempted to use drugs, again. Meanwhile, he battles it out with attorneys who are trying to help him, as he faces an investigation over the plane crash and his now - known, drug and alcohol usage while piloting the plane. This brilliant and riveting, 2012, Paramount Picture, movie masterpiece, comes to it's audience in technicolor with widescreen format and runs approximately 138-minutes. It comes in spoken English but it features spoken English, French and Spanish in 5.1 Dolby Digital Sound with the added bonus of subtitles: In English, French, Spanish and Portuguese. This courageous, big-screen, endeavor written by: John Gatins and superbly, Directed by: Robert Zemeckis, confronts and exposes the ever-growing problem of substance abuse within the 'white collar', professional world. Whether it's alcohol, prescription medication or illegal 'street' drugs or any combined forms thereof..., don't just affect the substance abuser as an individual, alone. Rather, the ramifications extend to ones: Spouse, children, relatives, neighbor's, co-worker's and the trusting and unsuspecting public. In short, because of the abuse of the one, all are somehow affected or suffer the consequences. With that in mind, there is a touching, deeply moving and memorable scene when Nicole - who almost overdosed, was in the hospital together with Whip, shortly after he survived the horrific plane crash. They are joined by a young man who is dying of cancer and together, they all gather within the hospital stairwell and have their own version of: Group Therapy. And of the three, the cancer patient is the only one with enough courage to be brutally honest about his condition and is totally at peace with himself, as he  faces his issues, head on. And for her part, Nicole is half-way there. Whereas, cocky Whip, is still in arrogant denial. Deceiving himself and endangering others, by thinking that he can go on with his present lifestyle. Drugs and booze in excess while piloting a plane. This gut-wrenching scene is only surpassed by the climactic ending when Whip - publicly and on record, comes to the end of himself. And ironically, it is because of a dead woman's picture and her toxicology report which was made public, that broke Whip's deceptive pride and brought him to his knees. Deep within his soul. This captivating film courageously deals with the stark reality of substance abuse among the professional, the educated and the elite working class, and how their financial and seemingly 'secure wallets' and earning potential, pays for both, the drug peddlers that supply them with the poison that they have become addicted too, as well as, for the attorneys who can be bought, when need be. Why? To cover up and legally 'exonerate' their client's, self-destructive habits while substantially lining their own pockets. As statistics will confirm, the blue-collar, addict finds him or herself addicted, too: Cheap wine, beer, marijuana, crack or the most diluted form of heroin. Whereas, the white collar, substance abuser has the luxury of being able to afford the very best vintage, the most expensive version of brandy's or cognacs, an array of cocktails, the purest form of cocaine along with, any and all, prescription medication. But, regardless of whether or not ones profession is white or blue collar, the fact remains: The bottle and any sort of drugs (legal or non), do not discriminate. Prolonged usage of either, will make an alcoholic or an addict out of you! Without a doubt, this engaging film is a sobering depiction of the hold that alcohol and drugs separately but particularly when combined, have on the abuser and how it adversely affects others, around them. Namely:They are the ones with the problem but they expect everyone else, to do all of the ""changing."" It's all about accommodation. They are the user of either drugs or alcohol, or both. And with this substance usage, they end up abusing, themselves. And in so doing, they directly or indirectly abuse others. How? With their prolonged addiction and subsequent behavioral issues, as a direct result of their substance abuse. And the more money that they have or make, pay's for others to change (be quiet about their habits, cover-up, make excuses or legally 'make deals', etc...), so that they (the user), don't have to ""change."" Why not? Because you have already done all of the ""changing"", for them. And now, they have got you right where, they want you! They (like Whip), make big money and money talks, doesn't it? Because the person who can be bought such as a greedy attorney, has already done the necessary ""changing"", right?! Not all, but increasingly weak, greedy and corrupt attorneys are catering, pandering and selling themselves out to wealthy substance abusers, for the love of money. Yes, this movie - FLIGHT, is a shocking depiction of someone that is running from, running too or caught in the web of addictive indecision. It's hard to pull out the 'mirror of reality' and take a good, hard, look at ones self. Because self-deception is very binding and hardened pride has an excruciatingly, painful fall. This powerful, shocking, stunning, revealing and thought provoking film is as educational, as it is, entertaining. It is an intense, emotionally-charged, 138-minute, motion picture which will take you into dramatic, new heights which perhaps, you weren't aware of or haven't experienced before. Then, it plummets you into the burrows of unbelief. It's a unique, wild ride to be sure, so fasten your seat belts and prepare yourself. Because this heart-wrenching movie with a silver lining, will enlighten and leave you with much food for thought. In addition too, hours of discussion time. Accountability and responsibility for ones actions? It's all here. Whether applicable or not, you can't help but be impacted by this riveting film. A useful tool and keepsake. Purely powerful!

I wish they would have kept the CGI more realistic. That being said, I am glad that some idea of how tough and under appreciated this line of work is. The long and crazy hours, the very low pay for many years, the fact that pilots are more like tagged cattle than white collar professionals. The underlying story of the pressure, stress, and critique rings true. It's a sad story, but one of very few that shines a light into our world. I wish more people understood the path traveled to be an airline pilot. Maybe then would be looked at as more than glorified bus drivers by the public.

5416697,5,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington is a hard-partying airline pilot who is both a hero and tragic foil in this dramatic story.  Washington's character is an alcoholic in denial who uses his outstanding piloting skills to save a doomed flight from being a total loss of life.  The story unfolds as he wakes up in a hospital after the crash, and participates in a cover-up to avoid jail time. A side story develops early on involving a beautiful heroin addict - and the story lines converge masterfully as Washington's character hits his bottom. I was on the edge of my seat during the flight scenes, and deeply engaged with the characters in the story the entire movie.  This one is not for the kids - as there is some nudity in the opening scenes, as well as adult language throughout the film.  I'd watch this one again in a minute.",1412812800,,816,4.530612244897959

I don't think that I was supposed to understand him. His decisions made him uniquely human. The hero of this movie falls from grace in ways that are neither heroic nor nefarious. He has great instincts that are partially driven by dependency. I have been conditioned by the news media to expect that anyone who does something that demonstrates a great gift will be vilified by a great failing in the upcoming issue.

5416724,5,B00AF6B22E,"Flight
 There has been a lot of chatter about Flight.  I sort of expected something like The High and the Mighty, the 50s hero airline pilot film.  Instead, we get something more like 28 Days, the Barbara Bullock re-hab flick of some years ago.  And Denzel Washington makes it work magnificently.
 Washington plays pilot Whip Whitaker, a divorced boozer and womanizer heading into the last few years of a successful career.  We meet him the morning before a flight when he wakes up in his hotel room with one of his flight attendants.  Warning-----Nadine Velazquez is a very beautiful actress and absolutely nothing is left to the viewers imagination as to just how lovely she is.  This is an R rated film.  Hung over and maybe still drunk Whip clears his head with some cocaine and heads for work.
 Due to an investigation proven mechanical malfunction, the aircraft doesnt make it to the airport.  Whips amazing flying ability is the only reason that it lands at all, saving nearly a hundred people.  When we know Whip as a rogue, Washington makes us like the guy.  When he is a super pilot, Washington makes us admire him.  When we discover his serial addictions, he makes us root for Whip and we wish him well.  At each stage Washington is convincing, accessible and just plain grand.  I thought the film to be about spiritual heroism and redemption.  And there is some cool airplane stuff too.
 John Goodman has the chance to play the flamboyant drug supplier pal of the flawed pilot while Don Cheadle appears as the lawyer who tries to defend the pilot.  Kelly Reilly plays a down and out heron junkie who finds Whip when he is at his lowest.  All are well played minor planets to the blazing sun that is Denzel Washington.
 This is a strong three and a half saw blade movie that drama fanciers will enjoy.  It is tough to watch as Whip goes into his personal downward spiral but it is very well acted.  It cost a slight $31 million to make and in 17 days has brought in some $63 million which puts it in the solidly profitable zone.  Flight runs two hours and 17 minutes.
 Director Robert Zemeckis lets his star carry the movie and pretty much avoids making his presence known by doing anything cutesy.  He is a successful director of such major hits as Castaway and Forrest Gump.  John Gatins inked the script.  He also wrote last years robot boxer film Real Steel.
 Flight is a strongly acted drama aimed at the mature adult audience.  Powerful dramas used to be the stock in trade in Hollywood but are less popular now.  But movie lovers still appreciate the genre.  Denzel Washington is being talked about for an Oscar.  He may be contesting the award with Daniel Day Lewis for his role in Lincoln which we will see next week.",1412208000,,2737,4.55441478439425

A bit of a cynical take on the airline industry many real pilots won't appreciate. I've worked for the airlines in back office some field and find some of the premise a bit of a stretch.

  Wow... I can't  believe this review got past your very alert screeners.  Think I'll add more...and maybe  be a little more positive.
  Flight  was an entertaining movie and they  did their best to scare the wits out of viewers with the crash evolution.  Mr. Washington is a cute guy and a good actor but as I said earlier,  what a bunch of low-lifes.  I'm an old grey-head dude and the culture of dopers and drunkards is very unappealing.  How are their kids going to turn out?  I hope the pilot;s brother wasn't a brain surgeon.

This film is sometimes difficult to watch because of the subject matter, and that is actually a testament to the great acting, directing, and writing. Great art communicates emotion, and this film does exactly that. I felt a wide range of emotions, including a lot of awkwardness as the main character attempts to hide his addiction. This film is definitely for mature audiences, with explicit scenes of drug use, nudity, sex, and profanity -- examples of which are in the first few minutes of the film. I suppose I would have liked this film even better if I knew in advance what I was going to watch. I expected an action film, and got a gritty character drama, instead.",1406764800,,873,4.675324675324675

5417022,4,B00AF6B22E,"This was actually pretty good.  I was a little surprised at the story line, but found it sad, disturbing and anguishing.  I'm a recovering alcoholic myself of 14 years.  This is my second time around with recovery.  I first came to AA in 1983, and was ASTONISHED to find the number of commercial airline pilots in rehab and recovery for alcoholism, and the stories they told of flying these enormous planes with hundreds of passengers while completely intoxicated to the point of being near unconscious.  Scary, but as they said, these planes fly themselves with autopilot, so they didn't see a big need to curb their behavior.  I lived in a major city that had two major airline hubs, and according to them, it was a common practice of behavior among a number of pilots.  Not so much today - thank God - things have changed dramatically.  So I wasn't surprised to see a movie about this, but what I ached about was the despair and hopelessness of this man, and then to redeem himself in the end.  That level of responsibility doesn't happen very often, but made it a feel-good ending that I was thankful for.  A different kind of role for Denzel Washington, and as usual, he pulled it off beautifully.  It's worth watching.",1406678400,,1224,4.62037037037037

5417086,4,B00AF6B22E,"I was completely overjoyed to read these reviews and see the bible-thumpers so vehemently upset over portrayals of foul language and nudity.  Unsurprisingly, the majority of them have positively reviewed family-friendly movies and Christian rock albums, yet negatively reviewed movies with R ratings.  Perhaps a dose of common sense is in order--movies with strong language and nudity might actually contain strong language and nudity.  Maybe, and this is a big maybe, but MAYBE you should forego future viewings of R-rated movies.  Crazy, right?  A big shout out to all of you that rated a movie one star after watching it for 10 minutes and experiencing shame over human sexuality.  Way to deliver a firm, fair, and impartial judgment of someone's cinematic work due to your own self-installed guilt.

Anyway, I digress with that whole personal rant.  Denzel turns in a performance as, well, Denzel.  Denzel is always Denzel.  Like others have said, the movie is about personal demons.  Like my unrelenting habit of being an orthodox practicing Christian yet repeatedly choosing to view movies that are R-rated and then complaining about the factors that go into an R-rating by negatively reviewing the movie on the strict basis that it offends my sensibilities.",1405814400,,1264,5.207920792079208

I give this five stars simply because it caused us to talk about it for several hours afterwards.  Not very many movies will cause a major discussion about addiction afterwards.  Know that this happened in our family, makes this movie worth watching.",1405036800,,419,4.791666666666667

5417133,3,B00AF6B22E,I felt the nudity in the beginning was totally unnecessary to the movie. The scene of the porn shoot could have done without the naked man.

I've never known an alcoholic/addict, so it didn't resonate with me personally but a star cast executes stunning delivery. There were points that distracted from the plot entirely but not for long. I found myself angry at the main character  more than one once and asking ""why would..?"" quite a bit during the 2nd half. Definitely worth watching.",1404864000,,490,5.2025316455696204

The acting was great, but it just didn't hold my attention. It didn't move me at all. I shed tears during ""INSIDIOUS"", a horror movie but this film didn't make me emotional at all. The whole druggy girl story line could have been cut out, it wasn't interesting at all.

Oh, and how could I forget, was the naked woman in the beginning really necessary? Could they possibly have shown her boobs any more times? Not a very smart way to start a ""serious"" film. She could have easily been in a skimpy outfit without all the nipple action.",1404777600,,776,4.49645390070922

Now someone needs to be responsible for these casualties and in the midst of the truth his alcoholism, and party hard lifestyle are about to be revealed which would ultimately win him hard time in prison.

This view is rarely seen by anyone outside the transportation industry, but it does shed some light of the unknown truth about the men and women that conform the airline crews.

5417167,1,B00AF6B22E,"Sadly disappointed, having high hopes for a great movie. I was disappointed in both the technical aspects as well as the personal perspective.  From the technical aspect, the aircraft depicted in the movie could not have sustained any flight time in an inverted attitude.  Large aircraft are not designed for such forces in such attitudes, unlike acrobatic aircraft.  At best, a skilled pilot could potentially execute a ""perfectly"" coordinated roll for such an aircraft (360 degree).  In the movie any such attempt to perform an 180 degree roll and sustain such a flight attitude would likely result in the wings shearing off in flight.  On the personal and relationship side, the movie never got off the ground for me with the starting porno scene. It is sad to believe that there are people whose life is so damaged and metaphorically as out of control as the plane in the film.  I am aware that there are people in countless professions who have personal challenges and dependence on harmful substances, but I cannot believe that so many people connected to and dependent on Whip for their safety and well being and with so much at stake personally, would not take action.  The redemption that finally comes in the last 10 minutes of the movie was too late for me.  The movie, overall was too painful to watch and a struggle to discern the positives from so much trauma and filth.  I lost 2 hours and 10 minutes of my life that I cannot get back...",1404518400,2,1452,4.68503937007874

5417208,2,B00AF6B22E,"Sex, nudity, and language aside it was a fair movie about drug addiction and alcoholism although is was shallow hoping the nudity and language would make up for it I'm sure.  Too bad Hollywood can't just make decent movies.  They don't need the trash to sell them if the plot is good and the acting is good.  The plane flight takeoff and crash were the best part of the movie from an action perspective.",1403827200,,403,4.418918918918919

5417214,5,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington kills it again! Great story, with characters that the viewer can truly empathize with. Great plot, Goodman is hilarious in his limited role, and the heroin addict (forgot her name) does a superb gob supporting the storyline of addiction and its consequences, and a truly remarkable portrayal of someone who made it. I watched it several times, an extremely powerful film, I highly recommend it.",1403740800,,412,5.164179104477612

5417220,5,B00AF6B22E,"This is more a comment on the reviews than a review. Recommended by Amazon because of my viewing history, why? Student of military history with an interest in the medical conditions caused by drug addiction. Great cinematography and acting skills with an interesting storyline . . . add a twist.  Definitely recommended and worth the time. Form your own opinion!

'FLYBOYS' was one of the other recommendations . . . good storyline about the American pilots of the Lafayette Escadrille during the early years of WWI. Some original foootage included.

5417224,4,B00AF6B22E,This is a departure for Denzel. Some have complained that what's done with the plane in the beginning wouldn't work but who cares? Some also say that there are better movies about people with substance abuse problems but they don't have Denzel in them. Good movie even if you don't love Denzel.,1403568000,,294,4.673076923076923

I should have stopped watching after the opening 3 minute titty/coke scene and the ridiculous side story about the girlfriend he met at the hospital, but I kept holding out hope the story would pick up at some point. I am still trying to figure out the scene where he went to the hospital and then prayed with the copilot and his wife.  Huh?  What was that all about. Why didn't they add a scene about UFO's and Martians being the cause of the crash. At least it would have made for a more interesting story.",1402617600,2,600,4.283185840707965

No matter how much we appreciate how wrong an attraction (drugs, alcohol, smoking, sugar, caffeine, soft drinks, friends and lovers, etc.), the addiction circumvents reason and wins.  It's a story well told.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it reminded me too much about how ugly addiction can be.  It wasn't fun watching the pilot's ""train"" wreck.  Not the film's fault, just my feeling about it.  The film's name is clever.  It conjures multiple meanings, just like the feelings it stirs.  Not a movie for young children, but worth a family discussion about the attractive force and stupidity of addiction.  It demonstrates that addicts aren't useless people, but rather people making poor choices, set on their own internal trip away from where they are, leaving behind all that is both good and bad.  Don't watch this movie to unwind or escape.  Watch it to remind yourself to be a better you.",1402099200,,968,4.841463414634147

I rated it 3 stars just for my personal preferences in movies.  3/4 of the way through I was so upset and just wished I didn't watch it but by the end I have to admit it was a good movie.

The best thing about him is that race doesn't seem to enter into the equation, although its always there, Denzel is just that good.

Not sure if a jumbo could really fly like that.  The plot is probably pretty close to some of the real world happenings as they relate to drug and alcohol abuse.

My friends and family told me it was a good movie and I knew I could turn it off if it was too intense.  Intense isn't the word.  The movie was very thoughtfully laid out from the beginning. You had a good idea of who this man was and what he was about.  I know pilots and for a pilot to enter the cockpit in his condition was appalling but I knew it was a significant part of the story.  Cut to the end of the movie.  The end was not predictable at all. I really enjoyed that. Good movie. I kinda wished I had seen it in the theater.

I was drawn into the movie, however, by Denzel Washington's superb acting and a plot which deals with his alcoholism and the aftermaths of a horrific plane crash.

And of course Denzel Washington is excellent as well. The story line detours a bit from expectations. No plot details in this review...not going to spoil it for you.

5417442,4,B00AF6B22E,"Have most of Denzel's movies and always appreciate & enjoy his prep and delivery.  Great cast carefully chosen to execute the old plot in a riveting way.  Loved John Goodman's character and performance.  Overall the movie to us was somewhere between Man on Fire and Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas with thought provoking dialog and edgy cinematic purview.  A little surprised with the pretty high R rated content and the high end Zemeckis films of the past, giving us a bit of a shock, but luckily balanced well by terrific acting and dialog.  Definitely not for kids in my opinion.

Not a big fan of the aeronautical scenes and felt they were pretty contrived and unlikely...although the first 707 did a barrel roll, modern avionics and control systems would make this difficult.  A stuck elevator, gear and engine failures would be fatal in almost all cases, but did provide a heroic outlet for a natural born pilot and a plot meant for the mind.  Wish they would have given us some more of the stuff most pilots are made of, like his crop dusting Dad or his previous military experiences with Bruce Greenwood's character (another excellent performance).

Overall an edgy, well acted movie that provoked healthy, moral discussion afterwards...A solid 4 stars for the right audience.

I also want to shout out to Amazon Prime Instant Video.  Have been a prime member for years and this streaming is another quality gift of value that Amazon provides.  The movies load fast and play flawlessly via wifi.  Haven't used any of the other streaming services to compare but are very happy so far.  The only minor thing is fast forward/reverse does not visually jog making it difficult not to overshoot where you are going.  Also wish they would add some of the extra features in the future as we do enjoy them.  Great Job Amazon.",1399507200,,1821,4.751592356687898

5417456,5,B00AF6B22E,Denzel is absolutely amazing in this movie. I loved the role he played and how he bounced back in the end.,1399334400,,106,4.095238095238095

5417459,5,B00AF6B22E,I wasn't expecting this movie to be as good as it was. Watching the Denzel's character go through the different progressive steps of denial until the apex when guilt brings it to a closure with his admitting his shame. I've always enjoyed Denzel as an actor this was a highlight,1399248000,,278,4.58
5417460,5,B00AF6B22E,I love Denzel but he outdid himself. Excellent portrayal of an alcoholic life out of control. Should have a sequel!,1399248000,,115,4.8

5417466,5,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington is excellent in his role... as usual.  The airline flight action early in the movie is somewhat far-fetched, but the portrayal of the alcoholic pilot played by Denzel Washington is ""spot on"".",1399161600,,209,5.147058823529412

5417468,3,B00AF6B22E,"I've been as drunk as one can get and think I was close to dying when I quit for the last time over 20 years ago.  0.24% BAC is pretty high.  I have never been measured but I'd say I was that drunk and more.

No way a man is gonna walk decently, much less than fly a passenger plane.  You can get away with a lot, but this beggars belief.

Other than that, it was a good movie to watch.  I don't watch many movies as most are disappointing.  This had it's share of oddities, but overall it was okay.  Denzel is a terrific actor.  John Goodman was an interesting character, but did he make Denzel all better by giving him cocaine?  C'mon!",1399075200,,637,4.064516129032258

5417474,3,B00AF6B22E,"...but this movie was not the best use of his skills.  He, as usual, did a fine performance, but the script was slow and provoked incredulity at times (like the main character hooking up with a heroin addict, his co-pilot being an over-the-top religious fanatic, his lawyer calling for some cocaine to sober him up, etc.).  The movie focused too much on Washington's character as a drunk - while that was an important element of the plot-line, it would have been more interesting to see additional juxtaposition of his hero elements.  A parallel development of both sides of his character as the story played out would have been more interesting to observe.  Everyone has a good and bad side!  Instead there are a few small mentions of the amazing feat he performed to save 96 people and the rest is all him falling on his face.",1398988800,,828,4.6438356164383565

5417476,4,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington is at the top of his game in this movie. As an alcoholic pilot who saves almost everyone (but 6) on a plane that
is coming apart, is first viewed as a hero. Then the evidence begins to mount up, showing that he was not only drunk and high on cocaine but that he was a hibitual user. The tension builds as his character faces interogation and the possibility of a long prison sentence. Is he a man willing to whitewash the situation for his own gain, or is he an honest man willing to face the truth? They will never show this movie on an airplane.

5417477,5,B00AF6B22E,"Here is the male actor whose skills very few can rival.  I would watch any movie he is in for I've seen a poor performance yet.  In this film, the protagonist (Washington) plays a seasoned and highly skilled aircraft pilot who ingeniously saves a large passenger airplane from certain disaster.  Although some deaths and a few injuries resulted from the crash, the pilot's skill was uniquely able to prevent total disaster.  But here's the rub:  the pilot is an out-and-out alcoholic.  The tension in this movie is seeing the developing realization of the uncontrollable urges the pilot has to drink alcohol, while denying his problem--step one:  admit you have a problem.  Denzel Washington carries the movie, along with a fine supporting cast, as he struggles with the truth of who he really is--the last question of the movie.",1398902400,,829,4.956521739130435

5417484,4,B00AF6B22E,Brilliant acting by both Denzel Washington and Kelly Reilly. They were able to bring you into a roller coaster ride of emotions that only great acting can elicit. Brian Geraghty as the co-pilot was riveting. The first part was hard to watch but overall I enjoyed the movie.,1398816000,,273,4.708333333333333
5417485,4,B00AF6B22E,Good movie!  It was interesting how Denzel Washington changed at the ending.  It could have ended earlier in the movie.,1398816000,,119,4.9

5417487,4,B00AF6B22E,"This was tough to watch, not necessarily because of the crash, but the internal struggle of Captain Whitaker.  Denzel was incredibly convincing; I found myself very frustrated with his character.  I would alternate between routing for him and being angry with him.",1398729600,,264,5.261904761904762

5417489,3,B00AF6B22E,My husband said it was a good movie.  I personally muted it at least half way through.  Just didn't do it for me.  Would not have been happy paying for it in the theater.  I have not been too pleased with DW lately.  I would say it's more of a guy movie.  Sorry,1398729600,,261,3.830188679245283
5417490,4,B00AF6B22E,"This was an enjoyable movie.  It was well-acted, entertaining, and suspenseful.  Even though Denzels character was flawed, and clearly in the wrong, I was hoping everything would work out for him in the end.  I won't say what happened in the end, but its one of those situations where he did something that virtually no one else could do and because of his mistakes he may have to pay dearly (i.e., loss of job, income, freedom, etc).  I felt that the pacing was great throughout the movie and I wasn't terribly disappointed in the ending (I feel that it delivered a good message).

Interesting side note: This movie was loosely based off of a true story.  In the true story the plane experienced the same type of malfunction as in the move and the pilot tried to use the same maneuver Denzel Washington did in the movie.  Unfortunately for victims and the victims families the maneuver did not work and everyone on the plane died.  Im guessing someone read up on the tragedy and pondered what would happen if everyone, or nearly everyone survived, and it turned out the pilot had been drinking?  The results made for a good movie.

5417534,3,B00AF6B22E,"It came in a timely manner. The movie plot didn't seem to be up to Denzels quality. There were a few nude scenes which didn't enhance the plot and could have been left out altogether, but looked like an attempt to get an R Rating. Not worth the time to watch.",1398297600,,259,4.098039215686274
5417535,3,B00AF6B22E,Formulaic but held my interest for most of the movie. Denzel Washington is always a sure bet to give a solid performance.,1398297600,,121,4.545454545454546
5417536,1,B00AF6B22E,"First of all, let me say the reason I watched this movie is because I like Denzel Washington.
Don't waste your time. I am an airline pilot, and I'll tell you the flying scenes are beyond belief. They don't even use the same airplane for all the shots. There are many impossible, implausible, and downright stupid scenes when it comes to the flying.
What I object to even more is the depiction of a pilot that knowingly breaks so many rules. Yes, occasionally a pilot becomes an alcoholic. I'm sure there are even pilots who use cocaine. But this is VERY rare. Your career and your life are on the line if you drink or use illicit drugs. No other pilot is willing to sit next to you in the cockpit if he knows or suspects that you're drunk or high.
I should have stopped after the first several minutes (to avoid an aneurism), but I plowed through thinking it would get better. I was wrong. This is the worst flying movie, bar none, that I have ever seen.",1398297600,,954,4.335195530726257
5417537,5,B00AF6B22E,"I love this movie.  Denzel does his usual magnificent job of portraying a pilot that does the impossible, then pays for it.  All too human, he struggles through.",1398297600,,161,4.714285714285714

Denzel is true to his form. He can portray nearly every character. He sucks you into the movie every time.",1398211200,,123,4.636363636363637
5417541,3,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington can deliver a walloping good performance when given the right kind of script. Unfortunately, this was the wrong kind. After the gripping character development and action in the first 25 or 30 minutes, the movie seems to lose its thrust, settling into a long, long glide to its predictable conclusion. Far too much time is devoted to Whip Whitaker's bouts with the bottle as court hearings loom. A rather disappointing viewing experience.",1398211200,,455,5.162162162162162

5417563,3,B00AF6B22E,"I like Denzel Washington in anything, and his acting was excellent in this movie...but the story
was depressing.  The title 'flight' either implied a disaster/adventure story or something 'uplifting',
and this was neither.  It's really a character study of a complex man, with complex strengths
and flaws.  It was hard to admire the character, hard to empathize with the choices he made.

For a well-acted, thoughtful two hours, this is a good choice.  It's just not a 'feel good' movie, nor
trying to be one.",1398124800,,509,4.9411764705882355

5417569,4,B00AF6B22E,We streamed the movie Flight over fiber optic cable at our cabin in the mountains and the experience was great.  The movie was also very good as we really like most movies with Denzel Washington. There were some great supporting roles as well with Don Cheadle and Kelly Reilly offering up powerful characters.,1398124800,,309,4.830188679245283
5417570,3,B00AF6B22E,Good movie but the story was over the top at times.  Drinking binge scenes were exaggerated wildly. Flight scenes were cool.,1398124800,,124,4.904761904761905
5417571,1,B00AF6B22E,"I took a chance and finally watched this awful movie. I can understand people liking it for the action but the whole movie is worse then just another fictional story with a big star in it. Not knowing anything about how an aircraft or the aviation industry operates is the only way to get through this movie.
Alaska Airlines actually had a jammed jack screw which controls the up and down (pitch) of the aircraft years ago, the flight crew could not correct the pitch down attitude of the horizontal stabilizer and so it crashed. These aircraft were not designed to fly upside down would and starve the fuel pumps in the wings and engines would quit. Pulling the fire ""T"" handle as depicted shuts the off the fuel to the engine and the engine quits, pull the second T handle and it's end of flight and end of story.  Of course in a good aviation movie you have to have an engine fire or two even if there is no good reason for it.
The story also forgets about random drug testing which includes alcohol. When you get the call you have to leave immediately to be tested.  The whole story is a technical disaster and a waste of time, just as I thought it would be when it first came out.",1398038400,,1185,4.309417040358745

movie as to what normal alcoholism actually is.  There was no real reason to make this movie because none of it was
believable: from the flying to his ability to hide-out @ a relatives place to the chance meeting in the stairwell smoking in
a hospital of his future lover to legalized abortion of his medical records.  Disappointed that Denzel would make this movie and have it on his back for the rest of his career.",1398038400,,531,4.3979591836734695
5417573,5,B00AF6B22E,"Tough to watch the main character's failings unfold on screen, but it is rather riveting.

He is a pilot, an alcoholic and a drug user. Circumstances bring him to where he lands a plane under terrible conditions after having drunk vodka and used cocaine that morning.

It was unclear to me how that woman was supposed to relate to the pilot, and so the film lost my interest.",1398038400,,408,3.9390243902439024

5417587,4,B00AF6B22E,I chose this movie because Denzel Washington is a favorite actor.  It was a good flick as it told a fairly accurate story of how an alcoholic could often function in what appears to be a sober manner as his/her body is used to high levels of blood alcohol.

The moment of truth arrives when he must choose between a lie that will allow him to continue flying or the truth that will leave a co-worker's memory untarnished.

In fact, they actually bring you to a porn set. You don't see anything other than a man's behind as he bares his goods to a lady. I'm sure that all fit in somewhere in the movie. I stopped the movie quickly for 1) peace of mind and 2) what if my daughter should walk in as I'm viewing something near pornographic (and actually is). If you have any morals against viewing this sort of thing then do yourself and your family a BIG favor and skip to another movie selection.

5417664,4,B00AF6B22E,"this movie jumps right into a fast paced, thrilling start. but once that part is over, it is more about compelling character development. It's really a story about denzel Washington's character as the pilot. I was a bit disappointed when I realized the actual exciting, action part of the movie was done with in a short time. but the ensuing portrait of how Washington's character got to the point he was in at the start of the movie  is a deep, enthralling depiction of the deterioration of his life due to his escalating alchohol and drug use and how it ultimately comes into play with his heroic landing of a jumbo jet. I didn't give the movie 5 stars because I felt it's depiction as a fast paced thrill ride was a bit deceptive since that only described a small part of the movie. absolutely worth your time!!!",1397174400,,815,4.506756756756757
5417665,3,B00AF6B22E,"the movie is well done, no doubt, good acting, good script, however, it didn't quite make me connect with the character because it doesn't give out too much information outside the present time. The plot is very linear, the only really unique feature of the story is that a pilot turns over a plane, but that becomes only important in the first few minutes, after that the movie becomes straightforward. Even the supporting character lacks strength. Despite the criticism, it is, I repeat, well done, it manages to take you to a different state of mind, full of gaps, yes, but being positive, probably that gives you a chance to fill in your own troubles without feeling too personally connected to them, that is just a big hypothesis.",1397174400,,735,4.75

They can have their pick of any woman young or old they want and make them look good!  3.

5417693,4,B00AF6B22E,"Definitely worth watching. Don't like plane crash/disaster movies but this was much more than that. It was good of a story about a man, his life and struggle. Highly recommend.",1396915200,,176,4.9
5417694,5,B00AF6B22E,Excellent movie albeit unapologetically raw. Denzel is a tour de force as a broken addicted man trying to changed. The movie inspires hope for all and illustrates the chains of addiction.,1396915200,,187,5.064516129032258
5417695,1,B00AF6B22E,This film is an unrealistic portrait of aviation. Begins with sex and drugs and alcohol. Two hours later the captain is doing his walk-around in preparation for a flight with 100+ souls on board. In flight he makes himself another cocktail and on and on. Not very interesting and actually boring. Pilots I have known are very careful to separate consumption of alcohol and other mind altering substances from flight. Acting is OK but not an attractive character.,1396915200,,462,4.935897435897436
5417696,3,B00AF6B22E,"this movie shows no matter how well you think you know somebody you really don't know them

5417699,2,B00AF6B22E,"The flight and rough ride, the crash etc were exciting and worthy, but the back story with the drugs and drinking were over the edge.",1396828800,,133,4.36
5417700,1,B00AF6B22E,I thought that this would be better with Denzel Washington in it. I was wrong. The movie was boring and very depressing.,1396828800,,120,4.5
5417701,2,B00AF6B22E,Gratuitous nudity in the beginning then a long grind of the depressing life choices of an addict. It's a painful slog to get to the payoff in the last 5 minutes of the movie.,1396828800,,174,4.147058823529412
5417702,4,B00AF6B22E,The movie at times was depressing because Humans are weak and succumb to things that as onlookers we cannot believe.,1396828800,,116,4.85
5417703,4,B00AF6B22E,"Even though I'd seen a trailer for the movie, I didn't know the underlying plot.  While unexpected and dark at times, it was a thought provoking journey.",1396828800,,153,4.666666666666667

5417706,2,B00AF6B22E,"This is a fabulous cast for a moralistic story. The protagonist is a superb pilot who happens to be an alcoholic and drug user. His alcoholism has caused many problems, as it does in the events of this film -- but not apparently the breakup of the plane or his incredible landing of it in a field, saving almost all passengers. One thing comes to another, and finally he has to choose whether to blame a colleague or fess up. In the end, he reconciles with those he has hurt.

The main surprise in this film is that the story is so unappealing. In order to balance the clear message that the pilot functioned brilliantly while drunk and high, we get an ending that is supposed to be heart-warming but instead makes even me wonder how this story drew such a star cast.",1396828800,,767,4.363636363636363
5417707,1,B00AF6B22E,"I can see why this movie is rated R, because you can't even get through the first scene without it showing nudity from the beginning
of the scene til who know when- we turned it off at that point!",1396742400,,196,4.051282051282051
5417708,1,B00AF6B22E,"I tried to watch this movie twice and couldn't get past the crash sequence.  The special effects are terrible.  Maybe the drama in the second half is better, but I couldn't get there.",1396742400,,183,4.515151515151516
5417709,5,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel, my man! You can't do everything perfect, and that's good. But put you in the right role, and you give it everything but the lighting. Flight is the best example to date. Obviously studying well for the role, your cockpit procedures and demeanor is pure pilot. Denzel pure. The complexity of human self destruction has been projected on the silver screen countless times. You reinvented the wheel here.

This is an collection of Hollywoods best- screenwriting, excellent casting of a group of greatly different characters, digital FX, editing, direction. Human tragedy, redemption, recovery. A reminder to all that it's never too late.

Not a movie about a plane crash, it's about people crashing. Don't rent it, buy it. This ones well worth it, and you'll watch it enough times anyway. Cockpit incident on a 65"" HDTV with cranked up 5.1 Dolby sound will leave you dizzy. Denzel dizzy!!",1396742400,,893,4.9865771812080535
5417710,2,B00AF6B22E,"Of course Denzel can act. But depressing role, trying to be this quiet, thoughtful movie about this pilot and his struggles... I turned it off. He was flying the plane while high on cocaine.",1396742400,,190,4.617647058823529
5417711,2,B00AF6B22E,Denzel Washington is a superb actor but the movie is a bit below his standard. I have to admit that I did't watch the whole movie. I lost interest early on in the picture.,1396742400,,171,4.0588235294117645
5417712,1,B00AF6B22E,From almost the first scene there was vulgar and unnecessarily unpleasant language. The scene let me know that it is going to be a sex oriented movie as well as plenty of sniffing of Cocaine. I dispised it. I don't know what has happened to movies that can show an interesting plot without offensive and illegal habits that encourage people to get hooked on drugs and encouraged to have cheap sex rather than a wholesome married life.  Old fashioned---yeah. I've been there and done that and I really don't want my kids and grand kids thinking this is the way life should be lived.,1396742400,,581,4.586538461538462
5417713,2,B00AF6B22E,"As others, I felt the bait and switch from what I believed to be a drama, to a 1960's drug and alcohol movie, which I despise. The acting was good. Denzel Washington was fabulous. But, I am sick of this genre. Two stars for the acting.
As an additional note...come on, planes just don't plop down. They leave trails, you know, skid marks. This alone gives this a B movie aura.",1396656000,,376,4.309859154929577
5417714,4,B00AF6B22E,Denzel Washington is a very good actor. The story line was very good and it enlightened me on the things pilots and the crew go through.,1396656000,,136,4.269230769230769
5417715,5,B00AF6B22E,"Talk about flying by the seat of your pants type thriller...well, Flight delivers.  One of Denzel Washington's better movies, in my opinion.  Watch it.",1396656000,,151,5.25
5417716,1,B00AF6B22E,"Terribly written and weakly acted.  No purpose except possibly to falsely instruct people that the right coctail of drugs will negate a hangover.  Completely unbelievable behavior and disposition of a real addict - feel free to consult millions of sources for reference material.  I resent this movie, and I dislike that Amazon hyped it and baited me into watching it.  What a load of crap.",1396656000,,390,4.953846153846154
5417717,1,B00AF6B22E,Did not even finish the movie.  Very hard to follow and did not get the plot in relation to preview.,1396656000,,100,4.0
5417718,4,B00AF6B22E,Good movie to watch. But contents are inappropriate for family viewing. The explicit content and language wasn't required to convey the theme,1396656000,,141,5.454545454545454
5417719,5,B00AF6B22E,This is one overwhelmingly powerful movie.  Denzel Washington is outstanding as a cool and absolutely talented pilot whose life has withered to substance abuse; at his own hand.  Yet also a dramatic story of redemption and justice.,1396656000,,231,5.216216216216216
5417720,4,B00AF6B22E,Flight was a thrill packed movie that make me think every time I step on a commercial jet... who flying this puppy!.  Denzel and the supporting cast were great.  I recommend watching it!,1396656000,,186,4.606060606060606
5417721,1,B00AF6B22E,"Turned ot off because I saw no reason for the nudity and raw language. When a film has to resort to filth, it's not worth watching.",1396656000,,131,4.076923076923077
5417722,2,B00AF6B22E,"Well it certainly was not what I was expecting.  I thought this was going to be a feel good kind of thriller, clearly about something that goes wrong during a flight.  Boy was I wrong.  I won't spoil it for you but suffice it to say that the crash was much more emotional than it was physical and that the thrill part was short lived",1396656000,,333,4.092307692307692
5417723,5,B00AF6B22E,"Apparently some reviewers here did not do their homework before watching this film. It is NOT for children. Oh me oh my --adults have sex & then drink & do cocaine..............well yeah....esp if they are ADDICTS. That is what this movie is really all about -- the fall-out that happens when you drink/do drugs & do anything..........drive...........fly a plane..........get married/have kids...........it is very well acted by everyone here & Denzel is captivating as a man who IS a hero but a flawed one at best. The 2 are not mutually exclusive. That is what makes this movie worth seeing. Put yourself on that plane...............do you want this Pilot flying it??  If so..........why or why not?  Being morally perfect doesn;t make you a better pilot. I thought the overly ""Christian"" Co-Pilot part may have been a bit pat & overwrought but it played well enough against the moral carelessness of the main character. The heroin addict was the best foil to play off of Denzel because you could see..............she knows the routine.............the lies, the deceit, the false sense of outrage & courage, the loneliness & the fear. Denzel knows who he is and what he is & you can see the slow realization that he has become a person that even HE cannot abide. A lying, dis-honorable man who had the potential to be a much better human being. And wants to get back to that guy he used to think he could be. The ending is a melodramatic mess & I didn;t believe he would ""come out"" at that public of a meeting BUT Denzel pulls it off because you believe him by then. He inhabits this person. We all know someone who would be much better off if they never had another drink & we all know the utter frustration of watching them keep on drinking. Denzel becomes that guy -- the father,the friend, the Hero pilot, the husband, the junkie ,the drunk who cannot stop himself from destroying himself ....... the user, the role model & finally the convict. Denzel covers a lot of emotional ground  & he does it with style. The supporting actors are all very good. And the crashing plane sequence is astonishing. Accurate? I have no idea but Holy Moly it grabs you & throws you around the plane along with the crew & passengers & frankly -- heck yeah - I want him as my Pilot in that situation! And I want him fully juiced so he can handle it and THEN he can go to re-hab. When you're up against the devil you need a Priest who has seen Satan a time or 2. Not some person who has only seen it in virtual mock-ups. We love to make people Heroes & then we love to see them fall. Sin & redemption, sin & redemption brother & this movie covers that arena in a skilled & entertaining manner.",1396569600,,2679,4.508230452674897

5417727,3,B00AF6B22E,I chose this rating because of the constant bombardment of foul language and the sec scene in the opening mins. of the movie!!  I personally don't think that bad language adds to a movie.  I think that it detracts from it.,1396569600,,222,4.390243902439025
5417728,5,B00AF6B22E,The study of a deeply flawed hero who has spent his life living a lie.  Denzel brings it home. Great story.,1396569600,,107,4.095238095238095
5417729,5,B00AF6B22E,"Thoroughly enjoyed this film.  Denzel Washington is one of my favorites and I don't think there is one movie he has been in that I haven't enjoyed.  As former airline employees my husband and I always like to see what Hollywood can do with a film about the air line industry.  There are many times when we laugh our heads off as there are some things that just can't happen the way they are portrayed.  This film was about a man with a troubled life and how he handled the addiction.  We were pleased that the script let the main character step up and do the right thing.  I can't believe that Mr. Washington will be sixty years old this December, we look forward to seeing him in many more films before he retires.  This is a terrific movie and if you have any connection to the air line industry it is a must see.",1396569600,,815,4.219354838709678

5417732,4,B00AF6B22E,I actually wasn't enjoying this movie because I felt that the focus seemed to be on how blame gets passed along rather than accepted. About half way through I began to see the bigger picture and was pleased with the ending. They really handled the subject of addiction well and the acting was believable. The heavy religious leanings were a bit much for me but otherwise would recommend this movie.,1396483200,,398,4.7

5417781,4,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel has given plenty of ""powerful"" performances by Hollywood standards, but he has never been more realistic and polarizing than in Flight. His performance is brilliant and believable in every respect.

The movie was good, but should have been great. There were deliberate shifts from drama to ""dark comedy"" as one editorial describes it, which I have no problem with in most instances, but the potential for this movie was too high to take it down this path. John Goodman is a talented actor, but his character, at least it's portrayal in this movie, had a ""nails on a chalkboard"" affect. This movie could have been one for the ages if it hadn't gone ""Hollywood"" in some spots.

5417797,5,B00AF6B22E,"An extraordinary film.  Contrary to the promotion of this film it was not a ""thriller"" in the sense of an action/drama film  It was something much, much more.  I am not slighting the action and drama elements in this movie but I am saying it was richer and more substantive while still retaining the thrilling and entertaining aspects of any good action movie.

The movie ""Flight"" was not just about flying conventionally but about the ""flight"" of the soul.  It is a film about falling from Grace, restitution, redemption and finally freedom of the spirit.  An intelligent very well directed and produced movie.

The acting was fantastic for all the characters but Denzel Washington is in a super-class by himself.  Denzel Washington brought the character of Whip to life and made us revile him, hate him then ultimately love and admire the man.

This is a good film.  Watch it.  There is more to this movie than fluff.  If you know anything about Denzel Washington you know that he is not just religious but a truly spiritual man and this movie and character must have been chosen by Mr. Washington to show the archetype journey of humanities spiritual evolution and ultimate transcendence.",1395964800,,1191,4.841584158415841
5417798,2,B00AF6B22E,"Get over the fact that Denzel plays an unforgiving, emotionless lout and a drug and alcohol addict, and what you have is an airplane-based ""Bad Lieutenant"".

This moribund stinker isn't even capable of being saved by the wonderful John Goodman.  After the first 20 minutes what we're left with is a case study of excess and one of the most loathsome, one dimensional film characters of the 21st century.  Contrary to some popular beliefs Denzel doesn't always have to be the good guy for a film to succeed. But the depravity of this guy (without adequate and convincing character development) undercut a very weak story.  All you need to know is the guy loved to drink, do drugs, have sex and fly airplanes.

Put him in rehab and keep him away from airplanes.  A memorable movie for all the wrong reasons.",1395964800,,805,4.673758865248227

5417817,4,B00AF6B22E,"Whip Whitaker (Denziel Washington) is a commercial airline pilot. On a flight from Orlando to Atlanta something goes wrong with the plane and it starts to make a nosedive. Without many options, Whitaker decides to crash the plane saving 96 lives out of 102. Whitaker is considered a hero that is until his blood test comes out and reveals that he was intoxicated with alcohol and cocaine. Now under investigation he is told to stay away from alcohol however letting go of his addiction is not easy, as it seems.

Denziel proves again why he is possibly one of the best actors out there. He plays the role of an alcoholic to almost perfection. In addition, this movie was Denziel's first Oscar nominated role since his early 2000's role in the movie Training Day. He made the audience believe that no matter what he did he could not stop drinking alcohol, which is not an easy part to play at all.

Whitaker vs. Alcohol. Alcohol is a recurring theme in Whitaker's life. All he is ask of after the plane crash is to refrain from the use of alcohol. However, it's harder done than said. It seems like every opportunity Whitaker gets he drinks some kind of alcohol. More importantly he is in denial that he may be an alcoholic. He describes himself as someone that just likes to drink. Throughout his life alcohol has always got the best of him, but will he find a way to overcome his obsession and admit that he may have a problem? You will need to watch the movie and find out for yourself.

I recommend this movie. However keep in mind this movie is mostly based on events after the plane crash and Denziel's alcohol addiction.

He ends up, in the process, recovering the son he thought he had lost as well, and in doing so, relieved himself of enormous stresses previously held in his life. In giving up and revealing his addictions, he became, in effect, a ""true man""! An outstanding film - I highly recommend it to everyone!",1395619200,,670,4.455284552845528

5417849,1,B00AF6B22E,"A black man is the pilot.  He has some drinks and some drugs, then flies the plane and they crash. The end. No, because they have to have a trial about the plane crash and drag it out forever. During that long boring time the pilot keeps being a drug user.

Sure when the plane was crashing he handled the situation very well. (He got the plane to fly upside down.) That doesn't make up for the fact that he was high while flying!

He says to the co-pilot, do you think you would be alive if I WEREN'T flying the plane? He means look how well I handled the crash. But the person with a brain would be thinking would they have crashed with a sober pilot? That is a 15 minute discussion.  This movie is 2 HOURS long.

They go into extreme detail about the plane crash trial. The bulk of the movie is the trail, and it's boring, and unnecessary.  He flew while high, open and shut case. They try to have some sub-plots about other characters, but who cares.  It has nothing to do with the flight and the crash, and just makes the movie longer because we have to watch them do the stupid stuff they are doing,that does not matter at all.

No reason to drag this out for 2 hours.

This is why I hate streaming.  If this was on dvd I could press the double-time speed setting or just fast forward with out having to wait for things to buffer.",1395532800,,1336,4.1434108527131785

Every day the news has a story about another famous person that has fallen prey to substance abuse. I do not claim to understand it; since, I neither drink to excess or use drugs. The ending is fantastic; and, Denzel Washington's performance is outstanding. This is a must watch film.

5417963,1,B00AF6B22E,The opening scene had nudity and filthy language that turned me off. I don't enjoy movies that have that kind of language in them and since it started out with that language in the first 5 minutes I decided not to watch the rest of the movie.,1394668800,,242,4.170212765957447

5417968,4,B00AF6B22E,Awesome movie. I saw this at the movies opening week. My only complaint then and now is the unneeded nudity in the opening scene. The film is gritty and a true representation of the struggles of addiction. Denzel remains my favorite actor by giving an award worthy performance.,1394582400,,277,4.791666666666667

Denzel Washington can't be bad in any movie he makes - he is a great actor and this movie showcases that. His coolness under pressure and the subsequent events that unfold were both logical and unpredictable. Finally, John Goodman - great - his role was too small.",1394582400,,349,4.645161290322581

5417979,4,B00AF6B22E,"A bit formulaic but entertaining. Denzel Washington's character is, in my experience, pretty much in line with someone with a drug dependency - denial being the foremost in my mind.

The truth of the matter is, NO one wins in this movie, but sometimes loosing everything is what redeems to find the answer.

5418021,4,B00AF6B22E,"I like movies that are based on true stories. This is an excellent true story of a pilot who against impossible odds kept his head and crash landed a plane with only a few loss of life when any other pilot would have crashed with no survivors. He was a junkie and alcoholic and because of this he was criminally charged even though he saved many lives with his heroics. However his most heroic deed was when he could have blamed some missing alcoholic beverages from the plane on a stewardess who died in the crash, but refused to do so and admitted that he drank them, and this truthful statement sent him to prison for many years. He did go to prison with honor however. In prison he became clean and sober and warned the other inmates about the danger of drug and alcohol addition. He also admitted that his punishment was justified. This is the story of a good man and great pilot who made a lot of mistakes but lived to have a second chance at a great life. WONDERFUL STORY",1394064000,,978,4.320652173913044
5418022,5,B00AF6B22E,"I had heard that this was a good movie and that the main character, the airline pilot played by Denzel Washington was not a very like-able guy even though he is a hero. The pacing, the acting and storytelling is almost hypnotic. There is much in this story that is revealed over time and took me to an unexpected place emotionally, by the end. I don't want to spoil this movie with bits of plot so all I can say is this: if you love good drama (with great comic relief brought to you by John Goodman, another great actor) you will probably enjoy this one.",1394064000,,555,4.245283018867925
5418023,4,B00AF6B22E,This movie...gah... I absolutely loved Washington's performance and the movie is written excellently so that it allows the creation of a character that you both pity and despise at the same time. His drive (or lack thereof) being so perfectly displayed that it shows the real struggle that people with addictions must face.,1394064000,,323,5.113207547169812
5418024,4,B00AF6B22E,"This movie surprised me. The plot was predictable but Denzel Washington gave an academy awards performance. Reading what the movie was about made me not want to watch the movie, it sounded so depressing and one dimensiional but in fact it gave a pretty accurate depiction of an alcoholic and drug addict but also showed people that were trying to get clean and what the price of addiction cost. The flight scenes before and during the crash were awesome. Great special effects. Most definatly not for children or young teens.",1394064000,,525,4.844444444444444

5418027,2,B00AF6B22E,It was an okay movie. I would have enjoyed it more if the language and nudity had been toned down. The ending left you with a better feeling for the movie overall but I wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to others.,1394064000,,219,4.116279069767442
5418028,1,B00AF6B22E,Major nudity right up front. There should be some type of warning that it's a porn flick. DW doesn't seem to mind but I'll be more careful with his films in future,1394064000,,163,4.125

Sometimes I waited up to two minutes for the buffering to finish.  3/ 4 of the movie I went to viooz (probably a pirate site) and finished the movie i. HD, free and without not one buffering or stuttering.  How can I site without the infrastructure of Amazon beat them in quality and performance?",1393977600,,340,4.451612903225806
5418043,5,B00AF6B22E,Great movie.  Full of suspense.  I will probably watch it over and over.  Denzel is a great actor.  Wonderful movie.,1393977600,,116,4.65
5418044,2,B00AF6B22E,I did not watch this movie after it started due to the very coarse language.  I just do not understand why movies seem to thrive on filthy language.  It could have been a great movie without the vulgarity.,1393977600,,205,4.368421052631579

5418052,1,B00AF6B22E,Terrible movie. Denzel's character is such a sleaze that you don't even care about what happens to him. The nudity in the beginning is absolutely unnecessary.  I didn't even finish watching it. Don't watch this movie!,1393891200,,217,5.027777777777778
5418053,4,B00AF6B22E,An amazing insight into addiction. I was not expecting such a dark movie.  I  was an eye opener for me.  How little some of us know about the power of an addiction.,1393891200,,164,4.0625
5418054,3,B00AF6B22E,Movie was good and well acted but a very depressing subject.  It will make you never want to fly again or be a little nervous.,1393891200,,126,4.04
5418055,4,B00AF6B22E,"Flight turned out to be better than I anticipated.  I lot of action and suspense early, then it slows a bit with story lines developing.  Overall though a very entertaining flick.",1393891200,,179,4.741935483870968
5418056,2,B00AF6B22E,Boring movie.  I normally like Denzel Washington but this role was done poorly.  All about drugs and denial and then trying to cover it up.,1393891200,,139,4.52

5418058,2,B00AF6B22E,"Didn't expect all the ugliness that was part of the movie. I like Denzel Washington, so I wanted to see his story, but had to stop watching it due to the message the movie portrayed. I hope this was not based on reality, because the story could apply to many lives today.",1393891200,,271,4.230769230769231
5418059,4,B00AF6B22E,THis movie was not quit what I thought it was going to be. It gives a pretty real life look at how powerful addiction to drugs and alcohol can be over people.,1393891200,2,158,3.96875

5418063,4,B00AF6B22E,Denzel played this part well. Very action packed and it has many surprises in it. If it wasn't for the naked woman at the beginning I would have given it a 5.,1393891200,,158,3.96875

5418067,4,B00AF6B22E,"An excellent movie with all the elects. Excitement, drama, love and a very good story. Denzel Washington is simply superb and plays a credible alcoholic. The message I got from watching this movie is about the consequences of our actions and being responsible to assume them. One part of the story line particularly important in this movie was the fact that he, as the pilot, save a lot of lives despite flying a defective plane that crash, but the alcohol and cocaine in his system made him a no fit to fly person.
The lesson I've learned watching this movie is that no matter how hard you try to hide the truth, it always comes out and in this case despite saving lives, at the end he goes to jail and tries to save other, not from death, in this part of the movie, but from their actions.",1393891200,,791,4.351351351351352
5418068,2,B00AF6B22E,"The amount of time this movie spent with Denzel Washington either drinking, trying not to drink, thinking about drinking, deciding to drink then deciding not to drink was tedious.  Even worse was glorifying the cocaine dealer as saving the day.",1393804800,,244,5.1
5418069,3,B00AF6B22E,"Flight was a bit depressing, but well acted.  The run time was a little too long, especially for a story of alcoholism and redemption that has been told a number of times before.",1393804800,,178,4.393939393939394
5418070,5,B00AF6B22E,This movie keeps your attention and just when you think you know...you don't! Loved the sound and special effects...great movie!,1393804800,,128,5.45

5418072,3,B00AF6B22E,"It started off fast paced but then after the crash, the movie kind of dragged.  It was not one of Denzel's best movies.  I watched it all the way through though.  I would not have paid to see it in the movie theater, I would have waited until it came on Cable.",1393804800,,260,3.9615384615384617
5418073,5,B00AF6B22E,One of his best........he made the movie...which is not unusual for Denzel!!  My husband and I never miss any of his movies!,1393804800,,124,4.636363636363637

5418075,3,B00AF6B22E,"The movie is not about flying; the flight sequences at the beginning of the movie are just there to set the stage for a personal struggle and they seriously strain credulity in trying to create a situation like the real-life ""miracle on the Hudson"" ditching of an airliner where the pilot was the hero.  That said, the rest of the story is well-told and the acting is excellent.  It's a story about addiction, though, not flying",1393804800,,428,4.618421052631579
5418076,3,B00AF6B22E,"This was a dark movie, difficult to watch a person's decent and their oblivion to their situation, ignoring any attempts to help them.  Of course no one will change unless they want to.  Denzel is a terrific actor and he played the part terrifically but this was not a movie I would rave about.",1393804800,,294,4.425925925925926
5418077,2,B00AF6B22E,I am a retired flight attendant.  Everything about this movie was unrealistic.  No crew member would be willing to risk their life by flying with an impaired pilot--he would have been reported before the plane left the gate.  Another example of lack of realism is that  the only cockpit check that he did before take-off was of his oxygen mask.  Whatever happened to check lists?  Then there is the total absurdity of flying the plane upside down.  This movie unnecessarily scares the flying public.  Give me a break!,1393804800,,517,4.795454545454546
5418078,5,B00AF6B22E,Denzel Washington played a great part as the pilot who is an alcholic.  It was a very emotional movie which I love.  I'd watch it again for sure.,1393804800,,145,4.142857142857143

5418081,4,B00AF6B22E,Yet another powerful and moving performance from Denzel. A friend recommended this movie. I would have otherwise past it up. Definetly glad I didnt. Gripping from beginning to end. I highly recommend this movie.,1393804800,,211,5.235294117647059

5418090,3,B00AF6B22E,Story was a good subject about the strain that commercial pilots have to go thru and the dangers of flying. Did not see the need for the sex scenes in the show as it really added nothing to the story about the problem drinking and taking drugs by the pilots. Certainly nothing I would take my children to see.,1393718400,,309,4.254237288135593
5418091,4,B00AF6B22E,"You've heard and read all about this movie already. It's a really good movie, maybe even the best of the year. However the 2 issues I had with this movie are sex and justice.

It seems it  still would have been to much for audiences to see Denzel get sexual with his white counterpart (see: Cheerios commercial with mixed kid/family outrage). Completely unrealistic, two addicts trying to cope-they're gonna have sex...period.  America is so damn square. I GUESS it's is implied they have sex, but then again, it is also implied that they didn't.

Now justice; didn't like the ending, glib and overly-moralistic. Had it been Bruce Willis or Brad Pitt or the like playing that character, he wouldn't be going to jail. Go ahead, name a movie where the like-a flawed anti-hero and voluntarily goes to jail...I'll wait, cause even if you do succeed its going to take some time to name a movie or two..... Ok, back on point, Going to jail doesn't really help him or his family. His family (son) would face shame for having the drunk-drugged out dad who killed all those people...and most importantly: NO ONE wants to go to jail. Especially someone who almost died. People don't choose to go to jail (unless it's a  mob deal-thing), even to save the reputation of a dead loved one... People don't choose to go to jail. Also, how can he be so damn cool in a harrowing landing but fall apart with some easy questions, that doesnt really happen...Hollywood...I would have like to seen an alternate ending or two. That would have done the story justice.

Because of the acting, directing and overall production and entertainment value of this movie (even if you only watch it once or twice), it is a 4 star movie.",1393718400,,1703,4.66
5418092,5,B00AF6B22E,"A fantastic film.
 The deep struggle through substance abuse and addiction is shown through the eyes of a pilot. The story is heart-riveting and will pull you in, even more so than many other fantastic films. See people struggle to get back on their feet and help one another in an incredibly accurate portrayal of addiction. All the while, lies and the past envelop everyone. One of the best films I have seen in a while.",1393632000,,422,4.552631578947368
5418093,5,B00AF6B22E,The move is great and it was a good deal.  My family really  enjoyed the movie we showed on our movie night at home. Great success.,1393632000,,131,4.0

Not sure why this has such a high rating.  Watching a man live in denial and self-destruction for 2 hours to turn it around in the last 5 minutes is something Hollywood did for both Ray and Walk the Line.  At least those movies had characters that you could like (and the music didn't hurt).  Denzel's character started off as an ass and while it was nice to see the turn around ultimately it was time for him to sit in a cell for a while.",1393632000,,459,4.193181818181818

5418102,1,B00AF6B22E,"This movie does not leave you wanting more.  All the actors in the film are talented but that is not enough.  The scene where the plane flies upside down is shot from all the wrong angles and not on screen long enough for one to comprehend the magnitude of such an action. The drug scene in the hotel room (the morning of the trial) is the best part of the whole movie.  I think it lasted longer than the plane flying upside scene.

If you watched the trailer, you may have thought this a mystery or a thriller.  It is neither.  It is a looooonnnnggg walk off a very very short pier. Almost two and a half hours to find out.... (quasi spoiler alert) that the guy needs redemption.  Aaannnnd admits it in the last 5 minutes so every thing gets wrapped up with a bow.

5418121,5,B00AF6B22E,I enjoyed the movie. It made me realize what a struggle a person can have with addiction and how hard it is to admit. Denzel did an excellent job portraying this character and what he had to come to grips with before he could heal.,1393372800,,231,4.155555555555556
5418122,2,B00AF6B22E,The film was okay.  Denzel Washington is so wonderful that it was worth watching just because he rescued this dog of a movie from direct-to-video.  John Goodman was surprisingly funny in it.  I loved the music in it.  Unfortunately the film was too too long.  Way too long.  Did I mention it was too long for what it had to say?

I did not much care for the violent behavior nor from the scenes that included the cocaine elements and severe alcoholic episodes but, the acting on the part of many of the supporting actors/actresses in this film was equally outstanding.

Denzel took me through a world of strange, seemingly hopeless characters, one of whom was John Goodman's character, which he played brilliantly with apparently some familiarity with addiction. The ending was an extraordinary act of redemption. This was a stunner that left me feeling ""wow!""",1393286400,,413,5.088235294117647

5418178,5,B00AF6B22E,Good movie; great performance by Mr. Washington.  I enjoyed the pilot's prospective as well as the NTSB team prospective of the incident.,1392854400,,137,5.2272727272727275
5418179,4,B00AF6B22E,"""FLIGHT"" is primarily a vehicle to showcase Denzel Washington. Of course he's great, as is the supporting cast. But the story line is pretty far-fetched. As you probably know already, Washington plays the character of an airline pilot who is a drunk and a druggie. The freak crash of the airplane he's piloting puts him on a collision course with the NTSB. After considerable drama, he concedes defeat. And here is my beef: based on my knowledge of addicts and alcoholics, he gives up far too easily.  There is no ""wailing and gnashing of teeth"" - no indication of any internal conflict. It's much too facile. It almost looks like the film budget hit the max and they had to wrap it up quickly. The movie is definitely a feel-good look at alcoholism/addiction, and if you're a Denzel Washington fan you'll enjoy it. But if you're after a serious look at the problem, keep in mind this is not ""Days of Wine and Roses.""",1392854400,,917,4.591463414634147

This movie explores the complex narrative of being human, showing this troubled man achieving a feat so remarkable that no other pilot could duplicate his actions in the simulator.  Was he able to do this because he was drunk and high on cocaine or in spite of it?  Does it matter?  One of the more interesting subplots involves the struggles of the media and authorities to deal with this issue.  They alternate between trying to vilify him and glorify him.  Denzel Washington's performance is uneven and a little forced at times, but the movie is well worth watching.",1392854400,,624,4.669724770642202

Should he have been praised for his amazing job of saving lives by his flying expertise or persecuted for his personal problems?  His actions leading up to the hearing made no sense.  Also, the addition of the random woman, who he immediately brought to his father's house seemed like unnecessary filler. All in all, it was disappointing.",1392768000,,484,4.795180722891566

He stole the mood and was brilliant but ultimately felt out of place.  Acting overall was good if not great.  But still just an AA meeting.,1392422400,,310,4.545454545454546

5418264,1,B00AF6B22E,"First I was highly disgusted in the nudity at the beginning, then the language just added to the disappointment. They may want to consider another rating for a movie like this. Something with a higher rating for such nudity and language. I don't think this should fall under the rated R!",1392422400,,287,4.647058823529412

5418267,5,B00AF6B22E,Denzel Washington gives one of his best performances.  This is a thought provoking movie on how addiction affects souls of any background.  A must see!,1392422400,,151,5.0
5418268,4,B00AF6B22E,Amazing and powerful film about how alcoholism can effect families and the struggles of overcoming this battle!

5418283,3,B00AF6B22E,Don't watch this if you believe you may die in a crash.  Good movie on the consequences of drinking on the job.  I am just hoping this isn't true.,1392249600,,146,4.0

I thought I'd be watching an intense drama about a crash and here in the first 5 minutes all you see is sex, nudity, drugs, and alcohol. Waste of time they should really do a better job telling what the movie is REALLY about! Is it so hard to make a decent movie nowadays without this kind of filth!",1392249600,,413,4.048780487804878
5418285,4,B00AF6B22E,"I really liked this film. While the physics of the accident seemed cartoonish, the story really focused on how strongly an addiction can take hold and control someone's life. Denzel did a wonderful job portraying the character and showing how people under control of drugs or alcohol can function and even sometimes thrive, yet are always inevitably going to come crashing down to Earth. I also appreciate how the movie didn't attempt to put a happy face on the struggles of this character, or show him making a miraculous recovery from his disease. But the self-awareness in the final scenes did maybe signal the hope that can come out of the depths of affliction",1392249600,,664,4.833333333333333
5418286,5,B00AF6B22E,"I loved this movie!! Please look at this movie until the end, made you think about real life situations.  I always love Denzel Washington acting because whatever roll he plays he becomes that character, villian, victim, victor he can make them all most believable.",1392249600,,264,5.0
5418287,4,B00AF6B22E,This movie had some things that I was not overly enthusiastic over but overall it was a decent movie.  It was worth seeing but not a movie I would add to my collection.,1392249600,,168,4.090909090909091
5418288,5,B00AF6B22E,Flight; A film with an excellent cast and story line. Denzel Washington's character looks like he is going to stick to his story and at the last minute he confesses and takes his punishment for his actions. The film is very well acted. I rate this film 5 stars.,1392249600,,261,4.346938775510204

5418290,1,B00AF6B22E,"Interesting premise, but completely detached pieces make this almost unwatchable. Most of the film is pretty boring after the initially flight. The plane takes off, but the film never does.",1392249600,,189,5.333333333333333
5418291,4,B00AF6B22E,An outcome that is both moving and realistic.  It is a movie of integrity verse love.  Very good film and recommended,1392249600,,117,4.523809523809524
5418292,1,B00AF6B22E,"Spoiler: This is essentially an ad for Alcoholics Anonymous. As someone who doesn't drink and doesn't use drugs, but just wanted to see a movie about, I dunno...flight, this was pretty lame.

Denzel Washington flies a plane which crashes because of a mechanical failure. He's drunk and on drugs when the crash happens. He tries to sober up on his own but fails. He almost gets away with having been drunk and on drugs. The movie's ""message"" is that you're all a bunch of alcoholic drug addicts who need to join an AA-like organization because you are absolutely helpless to control your own behavior. A CGI aircraft does make a brief appearance during the first act.",1392163200,,666,4.741379310344827
5418293,5,B00AF6B22E,The program was very interesting and the showing of the plane upside down looked realistic. The picture quality was good.,1392163200,,121,5.1
5418294,4,B00AF6B22E,A well put together story from beginning to end.  The airplane scene felt very real because as you watch it seems like it is something that could actually happen and it truly feels like a terrifying event.  I would recommend it to someone who likes drama and light action movies.,1392163200,,279,4.56
5418295,4,B00AF6B22E,This movie grabs your attention from the first scene.  I was surprised at how much I liked it.  I don't think this movie got enough attention as it should have when it was out in theaters.  A sad story with a surprising happy ending.,1392163200,,233,4.25
5418296,3,B00AF6B22E,I wouldn't put this at the top of Denzel's performances but overall it was worth the watch and I would recommend.,1392163200,,113,4.428571428571429

5418298,4,B00AF6B22E,Very good movie about the struggles of an alcoholic. It is not really a thriller though but in some parts,1392163200,,105,4.3
5418299,4,B00AF6B22E,"It is a great look at the crash of Alaska Airlines flight 261, which had similar characteristics and the world of drug and alcohol addition.  There are some far fetched inconsistencies with aircraft operation and piloting but nothing major and overall a very entertaining and interesting movie.",1392163200,,294,5.25531914893617
5418300,2,B00AF6B22E,The movie as a whole was pretty good but it seemed like it had some gratuitive sexual and drug content but it got a lot better after the first 30 min were over,1392163200,,159,3.8484848484848486

5418304,2,B00AF6B22E,"Great premise that just falls short.  The plane crash is riveting.  The story line after that is not quite believable.  Best looking smack queen I've ever seen, and with a heart of gold too.  Sure that happens every day!
Denzel seemed flat in his performance too.  I just didn't buy his character.  Almost fell asleep halfway through and ended up turning it off.",1392163200,,362,4.666666666666667

5418312,3,B00AF6B22E,"There is a reason that Denzel Washington wins awards, he is a tremendous actor who has you feeling the way his character wants you to feel.  Having said that, Flight shows off his acting ability.  The remainder of the cast does an excellent job with a touchy subject.",1392163200,,267,4.541666666666667

5418314,5,B00AF6B22E,"I'd seen that this movie was available on Amazon Prime for a while, but continued to just browse past it despite my love for Denzel. I am ever so glad I watched it. If you like stories with suspense, and human struggle, and an unpredictable ending, this is for you. Some reviewers were upset that the first scene was sexual. There was a naked woman in the opening scene. They were not having sex. Someone else mentioned not liking the fact that Denzel's character was an alcoholic... that pretty much is the running theme/basis for the movie. I can't believe I waited so long to watch it, but I'm glad I did. Highly recommended.",1392076800,,628,4.517543859649122
5418315,4,B00AF6B22E,The movie started out as the actor was doing drugs. this movie shows how doing drugs can really mess up your life.,1392076800,,114,4.2272727272727275
5418316,4,B00AF6B22E,This is a great move with Mr. Washington at his best.  Somehow he seems to play down and out folks or villians the best.  The beginning of the move with the nude woman is kind of shocking but if that is what you have to do to make your move realistic than that is what it takes.,1392076800,,278,3.8596491228070176

a good thing. It is good to remember that we are human and have the capacity for

The first time I watched it it was sort of disconcerting because of the huge pace change, the second time I watched it I more appreciated the drama. Worth watching for sure.",1392076800,,275,4.392156862745098

5418327,4,B00AF6B22E,Decent movie about alcoholism and how it affects not just the person but their whole support network. Not a suspense movie about a plane crash.,1392076800,,143,4.76

5418336,4,B00AF6B22E,Acting and storyline were excellent.  The story about a troubled pilot was not clearly established early enough to understand how the situation was brought about.  It wasn't until the last 10 minutes that it made sense.  The viewer wasn't sure there was enough to warrant continuing to the end.  Hated John Goodman's role as being over the top.,1392076800,,344,4.879310344827586
5418337,5,B00AF6B22E,"I enjoyed this movie, from start to finish. Denzel Washington shows us how a functional alcoholic/addict lives. It works out for a long time, and then it doesn't.

5418345,3,B00AF6B22E,"Troubled people living troubled lives set in the midst of disaster. I see this movie as a study in ethics where powerful and influential forces focus on a heroic action of one drunk pilot. Was it the plane or the pilot? What was the play for the pilot's union and how did the girl figure into the plot? In a way, it was too close to the hopeless situations I see with addictions.

This is a boy about a drunk and drugged airline pilot that landed a plane with equipment failure and how he endures the aftermath. He's a drunk and a druggie, so what happens isn't a surprise.
Overall, Washington does an excellent job of being the drunk druggie, but that isn't so hard of an acting job. If you like this kind of film, you'll enjoy this one. If like me, you aren't, you won't like it. It's a depressing and sad film.",1391904000,,600,4.463636363636364

Its like they wanted to torture you, and then climax at the end so you have to watch the whole long movie!  If homer watched this flick there would be a thousand do'ohs before the final huge do'oh. There is a little sprinkle of hope on the dissapointing ending though",1391472000,,391,4.328767123287672

5418436,5,B00AF6B22E,I'd been told this movie was nice and wanted to check it out.  I was not disappointed.  Denzel was great in this.  In the end I know it was hard for him but I really liked the end. Very nicely done.,1391472000,,198,3.7804878048780486

5418447,4,B00AF6B22E,"I thought this was a good movie with a great ending.  I will try not to give it away but it was action packed and unpredictable.  There were plenty of twists and turns partially due to Denzel's battle with alcohol and drugs.  While it isn't necessarily a feel good movie, the ending shows the personal benefits of getting honest which is a struggle for those battling addiction.  I would recommend watching this movie.",1391385600,,418,4.684931506849315

5418452,5,B00AF6B22E,Denzel Washington once more did not disappoint.  This was a fascinating and thought provoking movie.  Although I purchased it by mistake (thought is was part of my Prime membership) I'm still glad I saw it.  A small price to pay for a quality film.,1391385600,,248,4.590909090909091

5418454,5,B00AF6B22E,"This is the Denzel we love watching; truly phenomenal performance by what I believe to be one of the best actors in the industry. Not only is the mayday scene thrilling, but the aftermath and witnessing of his alcoholism offers a multi-faceted approach to the film.

5418465,4,B00AF6B22E,"Of course with Denzel in it, it has to be good.  Starts out a little lame, what you would expect from a plane crash movie.  But it gets much better after that.  Well worth watching.",1391299200,,181,4.114285714285714
5418466,5,B00AF6B22E,I thought that the acting by Washington  was excellent. The ending was a surprise but so right. The use if drugs & alcohol left me with an uneasy feeling about flying.,1391212800,,167,4.387096774193548
5418467,2,B00AF6B22E,"While this movie's action scenes were good, the character played by Denzel Washington had much to be desired. Denzel, as always, played the part perfectly.

5418468,2,B00AF6B22E,"Good casting and acting. Denzel can do wonders with any role. However even his greatness can't overcome my distastes of screen writers writing complete fiction and not giving that fiction credits. From rolling a comercial upside down, flying it that way for minutes, then rolling the aircraft back right side up and making a survivable landing can only be fiction. Not only that, but I have flown 21 years with another 21 years as an instructor, and I just can't believe that flight crews would support drunken, hopped up crack head captains, much less first officers. It may happen once in real life, but amen to that crew member's flying days.
The movie was entertaining, I just did not like the premise.",1391212800,,706,4.795081967213115

5418483,4,B00AF6B22E,"Bruce Greenwood is a reminder that there was another movie ""The Pilot"" that covered this ground pretty well a long time ago.  That film starred Cliff Robertson, and while not as gritty as ""Flight"" did a nice job of exploring the complex personality of the protagonist.  He looks a little like Cliff Robertson, and in his role as the elder advisor is a nice touch.

The film is a very powerful exploration of the dark side of human nature.  I don't think that Denzel Washington has ever given a more deeply convincing performance, and THAT is saying something.  Calling the move ""Flight"" was a mistake, which I presume was done to give the movie some sense of glamour, not that there is any of that in aviation anymore.  It would have been more honest to just call it a remake of ""The Pilot"".  One which is a very powerful and disturbing look into the how demons hide.",1391126400,,867,4.484076433121019

5418485,3,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington is always entertaining, but I don't think he is at his best in anti-hero roles. In this one he plays an airline pilot who manages to save a planeload of passengers from a catastrophic malfunction by flying it upside down. A later toxicology report confirms that he had cocaine and alcohol in his blood at the time, thus the original heroic deed quickly becomes tainted. The bulk of the film explores the moral dilemma of using legal technicalities to avoid prosecution versus a confession of the truth. Worth watching, particularly the exciting early flight scene special effects, but it descends quickly from that point.",1391126400,,639,5.037735849056604

Have to say the nudity in the opening scene caught us off guard and had us wondering what the rest of the film was going to be like.  I'm no prude, but it really wasn't necessary and would make me be careful about recommending an otherwise good movie to certain friends/family who wouldn't appreciate that.",1391040000,,460,4.654320987654321

5418512,4,B00AF6B22E,"Our Amazon Prime just kept spinning - even once the movie startedand it took 5 minutes to start - it just kept spinning every few minutes. So we skipped over to Netfix to finish the movie.

Movies good - not as action packed as we had hoped, but it ended well.",1390953600,,260,4.098039215686274

5418515,2,B00AF6B22E,Too much emphasis on the alcohol and drug addictions. I also did not appreciate the frequent use of four letter words when they didn't add any substance to the general plot.,1390953600,,173,4.612903225806452
5418516,3,B00AF6B22E,"I love Denzel so really wanted to see this movie. I had no idea how dark it would be. The raw honesty was powerful, he did an incredible job portraying this pilot with amazing honesty about his situation. I won't say much else so as not to give anything away, but don't see if you're looking for a ""feel good"" movie!",1390953600,,316,4.19672131147541

5418518,4,B00AF6B22E,Enjoyed watching this movie.  Was very surprised at the ending. Would recommend for anyone. not sure any real life pilot could handle a landing like that.,1390953600,,154,4.923076923076923

5418520,3,B00AF6B22E,I expected a stronger plot and felt it resulted in a lower than normal performance for Danzel Washington.  Going overboard on the landing seemed to reduce the effectiveness of the remaining story.,1390953600,,196,5.125

5418522,2,B00AF6B22E,Slow movie for Denzel Washington. Lots of drugs and lots of drinking seemed to be the focus! Not our kind of movie,1390953600,,114,4.2272727272727275
5418523,1,B00AF6B22E,We turned it off after the first few minutes of nudity and substance abuse!  Our poor eyes!  No more viewing for us with this movie.  Our love for Danzel wouldn't change our minds!,1390953600,,180,4.393939393939394
5418524,5,B00AF6B22E,"This to me, by far, is Denzel's best performance! A dark, intense, drama with a powerful performance. Watching this makes me realize he is now my favorite actor!",1390953600,,161,4.785714285714286
5418525,5,B00AF6B22E,Excellent movie with a well written storyline. Denzel at his best! Not Training Day good but still very good. This is a must see.,1390953600,,129,4.416666666666667
5418526,4,B00AF6B22E,"In a way this is a feel good story about a plane crash.  Six died but most survived. Tragedy is ALWAYS awful but when placed in context this is a relief. The captain an alcoholic was able to bring the plane down in a field thus sparing even further tragedy and when this flight is patterned later by more experienced pilots, no passenger would have survived. The subsequent machinations before the trial belied how the result turned out. A good movie.",1390953600,,451,4.567901234567901
5418527,5,B00AF6B22E,"THE MOVIE WAS REALISTIC, SHOWS 24/7 STRESS A COMMERICAL PILOT LIVES EACH DAY.

TECHNICAL DETAILS WERE ALL EXPERTLY DONE, I USED TO WORK AT THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION AND RIGHT FROM THE START OF THE INVESTIGATION IT WAS CLEAR THEY WERE GOING TO PUT THE BLAME ON THE PILOT.

I DO NOT THINK HE COULD HAVE LANDED THE PLANE WITHOUT THE AID OF COCAINE AND ALCOHOL.

THE STEWARDESS IN THE OPENING SCENE WAS BEAUTIFUL.",1390953600,,419,4.635135135135135
5418528,5,B00AF6B22E,"At the urging of friends, I watched the movie.... I loved it.  What an honest portrayal of an alchoholic and how they twist truths and manipulate - So glad to see the consequences of his behavior played out - great movie",1390953600,,220,4.365853658536586

5418531,3,B00AF6B22E,"The begining of the movie was not what I expected. There seem to be no indication of what the actual plot was going to be at first. Once the plot which showed a man who was fighting very serious drinking and drug issues was set, it became interesting. To me the fact at the end he admitted what he was and in doing so realized only he could confront his addition and only he could change his life was the point. I think maybe it could have been do a bit sooner.",1390953600,,461,4.021739130434782

5418535,5,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel was great in his cavalier and reckless portrayal of a pilot who gets away with the most ridiculous maneuver imaginable and somehow, by the perfect alignment of physics, manages to invert and reinvent a plane to a ""safer"" crash landing. The movie demonstrates just how unethical attorneys can be (knowing he was smashed during the flight), and yet they're no match for the power of addition in a reckless human; which again Denzel nails in this role!!!",1390953600,,458,4.884615384615385
5418536,4,B00AF6B22E,Great performance from Denzel Washington. Food for thought considering the recent exposure of pilots flying impaired as well as sleep deprived. Loved the underlying lesson that the prediction of the co-pilot came to fruition. There was a life changing plan for this tortured pilot's addictive life. Good movie with a powerful message.,1390953600,,334,5.4423076923076925
5418537,5,B00AF6B22E,"I thought it spoke well about how strong the power of addiction is in ones life !  The last question is one that we all need to answer.

5418544,1,B00AF6B22E,"Programs with foul language, explicit drug use, and explicit sex are disgusting. These kinds of movies just promote the use and indulgence of immoral and life destroying activity.
Cursing and swearing are used by lazy or unskilled writers, directors, and actors. Get a dictionary and start using words people have to look up to improve themselves. There is a perfect word for every situation, and none of them have to be gutter language.
I didn't finish watching the film.

Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors...I was very disappointed he played such a demeening part.",1390953600,,579,5.03125

5418547,4,B00AF6B22E,This was an entertaining movie but not for younger viewers. Denzel Washington's character goes through some major life changes because of his actions.,1390867200,,150,5.565217391304348
5418548,4,B00AF6B22E,Denzel Washington is again great.  Flight seemed to be a movie of a spectacular air plane emergency and turned into a deep introspection into addiction.  All of it a little beyond belief and yet Denzel Washington brings it home.,1390867200,,228,4.82051282051282

5418550,3,B00AF6B22E,"This movie has a little bit of everything. It starts out with some serious action. Denzel does his thing and it has a good cast of actors.

This is not a soft movie. There's a lot of drinking and emotional moments. If you've got a squeamish stomach, this might not be the best movie for you. Not a good kid movie.",1390867200,,313,4.131147540983607

5418552,2,B00AF6B22E,"The airplane incident in the first 20 minutes of the film is great.  After that, it's all downhill.  The acting is OK, but direction is weak, characters are inconsistent as a result, and the plot is not believable.  John Goodman's character is striking, but his place in the plot makes no sense.  The film has a message - drinking is bad for you, you need to come to grips with it, but along the way, cocaine can help.",1390867200,,418,4.32051282051282

5418554,5,B00AF6B22E,I'll admit. I was expecting a totally different type of movie. In watching the previews I was thinking the movie was about a conspiracy plain crash of some sort. Low and behold it was even better. It was about addiction. And Denzel played the heck out of his character. From the cocky pilot down to the cocky alcoholic in total denial about being in control of his condition. I love how how conviction finally caught up to him and he took it like a man! Bravo.,1390867200,,460,4.3604651162790695

5418557,3,B00AF6B22E,"This movie is interesting and Washington is great, but it is a movie about a man's struggle with coming to terms with his faults rather than focusing on the amazing flying he displayed.  I saw it in the movies and I watched it streaming a time later so I guess I would recommend it.  Just bear in mind it is not an action movie.",1390867200,,328,4.109375

5418560,2,B00AF6B22E,2 stars because Denzel is such a good actor.  This is a depressing drama with no point in watching.  My wife liked it and my parents.  I guess if a depressing drams about addiction is something you want to see then watch it.  Not my cup of tea in fact I like coffee better.,1390867200,,273,4.0

5418573,5,B00AF6B22E,Not condoning alcohol and drugs but he performed a miraculous feat.  Makes you wonder if your pilot is sober flying,1390867200,,115,4.75
5418574,1,B00AF6B22E,Soft porn with a drug theme. Too raw and rough for me. I'm a fan of Denzel. This is not one of his better works.,1390867200,3,112,3.52

No need for that to be the opening scene. I am shocked Denzel would do something as tasteless as this.  Directors need to know, we can get the jest of a guy without nudity. She could have been in a night gown and he could have just yelled at his ex but the profanity was sickening.",1390867200,,420,3.872093023255814

5418581,5,B00AF6B22E,"This movie reminded me that amazing things can be done and that they can be done by extremely flawed people. This is a concept that we tend to reject because we want ""choir boy"" heroes and ""devil"" anti-heroes, comic book cutouts that run counter to reality. The director took his time to develop his characters so that we could fully understand their pathologies. It was this portrait of the clash between the inner self and the external actions that is the whole point of the movie. That and the concept that only in self-sacrifice can there be a measure of redemption.

This movie is not fluff; it is the real deal. Watch it, only if you are ready to see some important truths.",1390867200,,679,4.520325203252033

5418590,5,B00AF6B22E,Is there anything this man cannot do as an actor? This film shows the struggles of an alcoholic who happens to be an airline pilot. I was drawn in from beginning to end based on Denzel's gripping performance. Would recommend.,1390608000,,225,4.65

5418599,4,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington does a terrific job of playing a man who has some severe addiction problems (to alcohol and to drugs).  Somehow, he is able to function supurbly under these conditions.  He appeared to be a person who was selfish and all for himself but in the end he 'does the right thing' which is always a good way to end a movie.  Some 'adult' scenes (which were not necessary) makes this a movie I wouldn't want my children to view until they are adults.",1390521600,,460,4.3882352941176475

It is a matter in which our society has not clearly defined the gray area in which functioning addicts are contributing to everyday life yet threaten our safety or well being with recklessness.  If you would like to see a thought provoking movie, this is one in which we are all affected by the actions of everyday people and if we as a society chose to neglect the ramifications and net effect of inaction, we will be exposed to the neglect.

5418617,5,B00AF6B22E,"Saw this movie in the theater and loved it. Was glad when it became available to buy. It's just done very well, the other actors are perfect against Denzel's character, and especially John Goodman, who is an absolute hoot in this!  It shows the ravages of alcohol and other drugs that destroy us, but it also brings us a story of how self-indulgence and playing with our lives can most certainly affect others a great deal. Especially when you're a pilot in a plane full of trusting people. The ending is amazing. From the time that Denzel's character enters the hotel room, is locked in for the night, and his friend and lawyer come to pick him up the next day, it becomes a movie that you have no idea where it's heading.................you just think you do.",1390435200,,761,4.554744525547445

5418622,3,B00AF6B22E,I was a little disappointed in this movie.  I thought it would have been better.  The ending made up for it a little but didn't really save it.  I was a taken aback when the first this I saw a nudity...glad my son didn't come out of his room!  That really wasn't needed and let a bad taste in my mouth for the movie right from the beginning.

And this is about a pilot and a drama-filled flight? How did this contribute to the story?

I turned it off. If that's the opening scene, who can guess what other salaciousness awaits my eyes? That's not what I look for in good story-telling. If that's what I want (and, by the way, I don't), there are plenty of slut-sites available online and slut-racks in the magazine sections.

His character in flight was perfectly done.

A recently divorced commercial airline pilot who suffers from drug use and basically a well know alcoholic. On a bright sunny morning, his nose is filled with cocaine and his body filled with alcohol from the previous night, his task that morning was to pilot a plane full of passengers on a routine flight. A faulty plane and a high/drunk pilot is not a good mix, but the plane is landed (sorta) and he is a hero! But wait .. what does his toxic screening say .. YIKES!!

Good movie!!",1390348800,,699,4.531746031746032

It was gripping, funny at times, heart wrenchingly real. Denzels character portrayal was spot on! Watching him struggle with his demons, I became both empathetic and aggravated at him at the same time. How far does someone have to go before they see how their behavior is ruining them? I found myself torn between wanting him to come out smelling like a rose and being terrified by the reality of his actions! Makes you think twice when getting on a plane. The ending was not what you would expect it was going to be while your watching it but an excellent and satisfying ending non the less! I highly recommend this film to adults.

5418676,5,B00AF6B22E,Great movie! Denzel is awesome in this movie and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Watch it tonight,1390176000,,104,4.0
5418677,5,B00AF6B22E,"Extremely intense for the first 40 min. or so. Then, what I would say is a well acted different part for Denzel Washington. I have to say that about half way through I was annoyed with him, but then I realized what was going on and enjoyed the movie. I wish that Hollywood could stop using the ""F"" bomb so much. It does detract from an otherwise excellent movie.",1390176000,,362,4.260869565217392
5418678,4,B00AF6B22E,"I can highly recommend this movie to anyone. Some parts are really thrilling, some are funny. Denzel is a great actor and did great in this movie too.",1390176000,,150,4.392857142857143
5418679,3,B00AF6B22E,Great cast and acting but disappointing story. I expect more from Zemeckis. Not sure why this movie was even made. It's a sad story of alcoholism and we don't really end up being interested in the main characters redemption. There's nothing sympathetic about him.,1390176000,,263,5.0
5418680,2,B00AF6B22E,Good at first. Then very slow. Thought I would like it but then turned out to be a dis appointment,1390176000,,98,3.95
5418681,2,B00AF6B22E,"Slow moving. Good story line, but it wasn't presented well.  Denzel did well with that which he had to work, but he should have said NO after reading the script.",1390176000,,161,4.366666666666666
5418682,3,B00AF6B22E,"Anything denzel does is amazing! Although his last movie with that woman married to Robin Thicke , he could've kept that one, what's her name?",1390176000,,142,4.72
5418683,3,B00AF6B22E,"I went into this movie not knowing a thing about it, assuming that it would be a little bit of an action/adventure with the heroic pilot managing to do what the pilots of an actual Alaska Airlines flight could not. As it turns out, the only similarity between this film and the Alaska Airlines flight is that both had a broken jackscrew and they both tried to fly the plane upside down. Only the movie version of that worked. In any case, that whole sequence takes a back seat to the true reason for the tale: a pilot's fight with substance abuse.

The fact that they took an active commercial pilot and turned him into a virtual junkie stretches all credibility. It might have worked better if he had been a fireman or policeman. I just can't imagine any co-pilot simply being a little uncomfortable sitting next to a pilot who reeks of alcohol. It also felt a bit that the story perhaps unintentionally glorified being high or drunk... Denzel's character pulled off some amazing stunts where it's almost insinuated that he accomplished them as a result of his stupor, not despite it.

In any case, this is one of those movies that received its share of awards and nominations I think mostly due to the names of the actors, director and its serious subject matter, but it's also one that I think over time will turn out to be somewhat forgettable. In a few years it will mostly just be a line on the resume of Denzel and director Robert Zemeckis.",1390176000,,1447,4.519083969465649
5418684,5,B00AF6B22E,A good movie that keeps you entertained through out. Worth watching while spending time with family on the weekend. Good acting also,1390176000,,132,5.045454545454546

5418686,2,B00AF6B22E,"Flight is too long and overblown. Denzel Washington's performance is good. That said, I can think of better ways to spend 2 hours and 18 minutes. ""Fearless"" is preferable and a superior film dealing with similar subject matter. A major stumble for Bob Zemeckis",1390176000,,260,4.931818181818182
5418687,5,B00AF6B22E,"This movie was pretty good. I think the acting by Denzil was awesome as usual. The story itself made you wonder what the lives of pilots are like. Although, those of us who fly want to believe all pilots are above standard. Great twist in the movie.",1390176000,,249,4.319148936170213
5418688,1,B00AF6B22E,"If you think this movie should be seen simply because it is staring Denzel Washington, think again.

Put this out with the garbage before it fouls the air.",1390176000,,380,4.602941176470588

5418691,5,B00AF6B22E,This story is well told. Denzel did a great job! He brings real depth and complexity to this role.  Supporting cast also did a great job!,1390176000,,137,4.269230769230769
5418692,5,B00AF6B22E,Denzel Washington plays a flight captain who has a drinking problem. John Goodman plays a short but hilarious role. Without him the laughs would have been minimal. This is a great movie. I've seen it 3 times now and since purchased the blu-ray. The ending brings it all together and has a meaning to it.,1390089600,,303,4.527272727272727

5418697,5,B00AF6B22E,"Having never been an addict, I'm not sure if the writer's portrayal of addiction is quite spot on, but thanks to good acting it feels real enough for anyone to understand the message of the film and feel all the emotions they are supposed to feel for the characters in the film. It doesn't take a genius to see that addiction ruins lives and the film conveys that. However it also shows that people can recover from their addictions and that even though not everything they've done wrong can be set right, things can get better. It is a clear enough message that it should make us all think about our actions and what they could lead to, whether it be texting while driving, drinking, doing drugs, or being jerks to the people around us. Those actions have consequences and sometimes they are dire, but until the day we die it's never too late to turn things around and start making better decisions.

Besides the above average drama told, this movie packs THE most suspenseful scene that i have ever seen in a movie. Even if you aren't a fan of dramas, watch the plane crash. It is worth having your gut knotted up and palms sweaty.",1390089600,,1133,4.473429951690822

5418702,3,B00AF6B22E,Realistic portrayal of the agonies of active alcoholism and the unthinkable effect it could have on others. Plot was a bit too predictable optimistic but painful to watch until the positive ending. Denzel Washington's superb acting makes it all very believable. Not so much an airplane disaster film as a human disaster and redemption film.,1390089600,,340,5.2

5418704,2,B00AF6B22E,It was just ok. Moved so slow that I actually turned it off and finished watching later. Denzel Washington plays a good guy much better than a troubled character. Just not at all what I expected from a highly promoted movie. Boring and easy to expect outcomes.,1390089600,,260,4.553191489361702

5418706,3,B00AF6B22E,"I'm not sure what I expected. It was a tour de force by Denzel Washington. He was so good, he became hard to watch. I'm glad I watched it to its conclusion and can recommend it to you.",1390089600,,184,3.8684210526315788

5418711,5,B00AF6B22E,The story lingers long after the movie is over. Extremely powerful movie challenging your thoughts on ethics. Very believable story line with excellent acting.,1390089600,,159,5.666666666666667
5418712,4,B00AF6B22E,"While this wasn't the best movie of all time it was very watchable and good entertainment. Some of the acting could have been a bit ""better"" but overall it was pretty good. I'm glad they didn't cover up all the nudity, coke snorting, and alcohol infused anger scenes by some 'soft' garbage. They did a great job depicting how alcoholism can and will destroy someones life. I honestly thought it was going to end differently but I was wrong! I would have liked a little more detail at the end but I guess you get the picture as to what happened.

Some of these reviews are hilarious to read, 1 star because we turned it off during the first 5 minutes due to nudity. Far too many soft, sensitive people in this world. Read what the movie is about, look at the rating ""MPAA: Rated R for drug and alcohol abuse, language, sexuality/nudity and an intense action sequence"" -- if that's not for you then simply move on - don't complain about it!",1390003200,,938,4.421965317919075

5418722,4,B00AF6B22E,Denzel did a fantastic job as always.  Great story line.  It makes you wonder though about flying and what frame of mind the pilots are in.,1390003200,,139,4.3076923076923075
5418723,1,B00AF6B22E,As huge Denzel Washington fans this was a complete disappointment. The language and nasty scenes right at the opening made us turn it off in about 5 minutes.,1390003200,,157,4.642857142857143

5418727,1,B00AF6B22E,I absolutely agree with the other reviewer that this movie is way to slow and no plot whatsoever. It has been promoting its own religious agenda all the time instead of having any consistent story in it.,1389916800,,203,4.513513513513513

But the movie itself seemed a bit too long for the story, and it may be me, but a couple connections weren't clear to me.  First, I didn't realize the flight attendant who died was the girl in his room when the movie opened.  Second, I never quite figured out how the John Goodman character figured into this - where the heck did he come from?

But after the initial set-up, the movie follows tried-and-true Hollywood formulas, right down to the barfingly cliche ending.  Acting is fairly solid, with a fun cameo by John Goodman.  But my guess is that you have better things to do with your time.",1389830400,,417,4.763888888888889
5418741,4,B00AF6B22E,If you can get by the unrealistic flight film is very good in portraying a functional alcoholic. There are many in this world with some at helm of important jobs. Some not quite this dramatic but important non the less. Denzel deserves better direction. Difficult to express internal turmoil of addiction.,1389830400,,305,5.0
5418742,5,B00AF6B22E,I think it was great that I could watch Flight on Prime for Free.  The movie is quite a ride and a great statement.  I really enjoy the movie.  I saw it on the big screen as well.,1389830400,,179,3.6578947368421053
5418743,5,B00AF6B22E,I gave this five stars.  It was a very moving story and I am never disappointed with Denzel Washington.  He is a terrific actor.  This was not a usual part for Denzel but you felt what he went through and the story had a meaningful ending.  I would watch this movie again. It was definitely a keeper.,1389830400,,300,4.2105263157894735

5418745,5,B00AF6B22E,One of Denzel's finest movies. I am a big (HUGE) DW fan so I am a little bias here. He did better here than in Training day. When you actually hate the character you can tell if is good acting.,1389830400,,193,3.85
5418746,3,B00AF6B22E,"Good dramatic story, fantastic flight crash scene, and super acting by Denzel Washington -- his addiction to alcohol was spot on.  However, the slow pace was starting wear down both my wife's and my patience.  So we paused the movie, ate dinner, and saw the rest later in the evening.  I suggest you watch the film, but don't expect an action suspense show by any means.",1389830400,,370,4.575757575757576

5418827,2,B00AF6B22E,"As in, I don't hate the actors for why I hate this movie. Or any of the crew, really. It's nicely acted, nicely lit, nicely decorated, ect.

I assumed that there was going to be a lot of forensic investigation - that the main issue is the flight itself. I was aware from the previews that he had a drink or two before the flight, so I also assumed that there would be discussion of the legal issues there, and maybe a look into the morality of that, and whether saving a bunch of lives mitigates doing something wrong.

There's none of that. This is 100% one writer's love affair with 12-step programs.

It's the story of a terrible, terrible person getting more terrible as the movie goes on. It opens with him being terrible to his ex wife, then condescending to his co-workers. Speaking of - the other characters in this movie only exist to respond to the main character. His co-pilot is not a person, he's there to look at Denzel sternly, and ask if he's alright. He's foreshadowing disaster. 'This guy should not be flying', his face tells us. Meanwhile, there's a subplot about some junkie chick, who I had to assume was going to be connected to the plot at some point, but it's just a huge interruption to the plot at this point. Turns out that they meet in the hospital after he crashes and she OD's. They don't JUST meet ... they meet out on the stairwell where they can smoke, and sit around and talk with a third guy that you never see again. It's a rather long scene where they just sit & talk. And talk. And talk. It's one of the more boring scenes I've ever had to sit through in a movie. But you know what they do at 12-step meetings? Sit. And talk.

Denzel's char eventually 'rescues' her from her landlord who lets her pay her rent with sex & takes her home to his place, where she shows him how grateful she is with sex. And also proceeds to treat her like s***, just like everyone else.

Get it? He's a terrible person! In the grips of a terrible addiction! Heading toward his ""rock bottom""!

What passes for a surprise twist is (I'd say ""spoilers"", but I'm trying to tell you to NOT watch this movie) is him deciding to finally admit, in the middle of the inquest, to admit that he'd been drinking. We're supposed to care that he did it to protect the reputation of the flight attendent who was killed saving a kid who had become unbuckled. Who was either flying alone, or who had terrible, terrible parents who just sat there 'til a stranger did something. But the kid AND the flight attendant didn't matter as characters - they only exist as props for the main char to react to, like everyone else in the movie. Most of them are only there for one scene. Don Cheadle tries & tries to make his lawyer into a character that matters, but as good as he is, there's just nothing there for him to work with.

There's no discussion of the impact of his admission. We don't get to see any deliberations. We don't know how anyone else in the movie feels about this, or anything. We go pretty much directly to him sitting in a circle in prison, talking. He knows he's a terrible person now, huzzah!

But. Are we supposed to forgive him now? Is getting sober the last thing you need to do? Do all addicts, aside from movie and TV writers, mistake ""apology"" for ""amends""? Once you've damaged someone as badly as this character has his son, you can't expect them to give a s*** that you now understand that you're awful, and you're sorry.

Unfortunately for the movie, that's exactly how *I* felt at the end of it, too.",1389657600,,3528,4.349544072948328

5418831,5,B00AF6B22E,This was a great movie as all movies Denzel is in.  Unusual role for him as he pays a very imperfect human but does become his own hero inthe end.,1389657600,,146,3.8666666666666667
5418832,5,B00AF6B22E,Denzel Washington has again played a serious role to perfection.  Sad but real message is delivered through his portrayal of a talented professional plagued with substance abuse addictions.,1389657600,,189,5.75
5418833,5,B00AF6B22E,I can honestly say I like the way the show ended..  It was not what I was expecting at the end.  Did like the role that Denzel Washington played.,1389657600,,145,3.9655172413793105

I have spent a lot of time around addicts and know that addiction is a tough subject to talk about...to go through...to watch in a motion picture. Most of the time we want to be entertained with the fun, funny, joyful films rather than take a look at things that are more serious. This film takes a very serious and challenging subject and with great acting from Denzel, John Goodman and other supporting actors creates a triumphant story. I love to see great films made of important subjects like this.

There are a few things about this film that are just not very realistic but I personally found it thrilling still.",1389657600,,840,4.630872483221476

The role of enablers is always featured though not emphasized enough.

More to be desired in latter half regarding cinematics/drama. The first third to half was gripping but then the issues of trial and his BAC should have been played out in a more suspenseful fashion.",1389657600,,334,5.072727272727272

5418845,2,B00AF6B22E,"Wasn't too bad actually until 1/2 of the way into the movie.  After that, it became an AA movie that pitched nothing more than an alcoholic's sob story.

5418847,4,B00AF6B22E,One of Denzel Washington's strongest performances as a flawed airline pilot who performs an incredible act of bravery which results in confronting unpleasant truths about himself. An Oscar-caliber Denzel carries the movie with able support from John Goodman. Worth watching.,1389571200,,274,5.875

5418854,5,B00AF6B22E,Movie grabs the audience from the beginning; Denzel Washington performance is convincing and a realistic portrayal of someone dealing with alcohol addiction.  The plot weaves together what can be lost when consumed by addiction and how even saving others one cannot save yourself until you let it go.,1389571200,,300,5.25
5418855,1,B00AF6B22E,Can't believe this movie only put me to sleep once.  Description says thriller?  Not a chance.  Maybe if the movie took out an hour of dragging it would have been OK.  Not worth stealing any more of my time away typing!,1389571200,,219,4.2682926829268295

5418865,3,B00AF6B22E,"Movie was OK but a bit farfetched.  I found it a bit incredulous that a pilot as drunk and strung out as he was could function well enough to pull off the stunt he supposedly did.

That being said, the tale of the lonely alcoholic who finally did the right thing was poignant and touching.

I wouldn't recommend this film to my friends though.",1389484800,,343,4.328125

5418871,1,B00AF6B22E,"Everything about this movie is bad, no BAD. The plot is unrealistic, the acting is uncomfortably weird, and it drags on forever. Not sure how this got nominated for Academy awards, possibly for acting to try to fake it. The only redeeming quality is Whip finally admits to alcoholism.

5418876,5,B00AF6B22E,I always thought of Denzel Washington as a great actor- but in this role he is superb! This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It is certainly more drama than action - although the beginning really brings you into the movie. I enjoyed all the characters in the movie- which is what makes is real. Alcoholism affects not just the alcoholic- but everyone around him/her. It is also true that alcoholics can be very successful peoples. I found the movie wonderful to watch and recommend watching it when you have few distractions. There are details that you don't want to miss. Well done.,1389398400,,602,4.532110091743119
5418877,2,B00AF6B22E,"While the flight in the title is hyped in all of the previews, it's simply a catalyst for a movie about addiction. That's it.  Denzel Washington is a wonderful actor - and does a great job with the role - but the entire plot line is 'get drunk, get high, get sober, repeat.""

The ending was a tiny bit redeeming but we came away just feeling like this movie was just ""meh.""",1389398400,,373,4.166666666666667

At first I thought she was the one he was in bed with in the opening scenes. It was a decent morality tale explaining that: Even though something remarkablly fortuitous happens during incredibly hazardous, dangerous, and stupid behavior does not validate that bad behavior. It was very trying to wait out his trial and frustrating to watch the predictable outcome.",1389398400,,471,4.8875
5418879,5,B00AF6B22E,"The movie was great. Not over or understated.  The plot is plausible.  There are ordinary people who have extraordinary abilities and whose gut instincts are dead on.  Also, despite the fact that he saved many lives by his with his flying skills, he violated all the rules of correct conduct, as a pilot and a citizen, by drinking and using cocaine.  He was sentenced to serve time in prison and because of his strength of character he was able to accept his sentence and realize it was deserved.  He went on to improve himself and become the better man within him.",1389398400,,565,4.554455445544554

Its obvious no one ever consulted a professional pilot when this was edited as the flying scenes were riddled with errors.

With respect to Amazon's HD streaming, I have always assumed that the content is streamed at 720P resolution.  As as long as your streaming ""player"" has the ability to automatically upconvert, you should not notice any difference in the playback.

I expect that most American films will have no shortage of general religious references, but this film focuses so much on the writer's pre-determinist theological beliefs and promotion of A.A.rubbish that I could barely tolerate sitting through it.  This movie belongs in the ""Religious Fiction"" section.

Also, I find it funny that so many films that are made to appeal to fundamentalist religious zealots also happen to contain nudity and glorified drug use, as in the case of this film's opening scene!  Not that I have a problem with a film showing either, just that it seems like it was intentionally put there so the targeted audience of religious hypocrites could enjoy watching some ""sinful"" acts and excuse it because ""there's a 'good' moral to the story"".

It is both pathetic, sad, and ultimately frightening to see what transpires to his friends and family...who are the ""real"" victims in his life.

The great movie demographics are definitely for teens and adults...not pre-pubescent children.

I would definately recommend it but I'm glad I didn't spend money to go see it at the theatre or buy the disc.

Then, the majority of the film is the ""same old, same old"" look at the how he loses all those who love and want to help him to the disease but, in the end, he shows his true colors; something I did not expect.  And, there were a couple of scenes where Denzel Washington's character reacts quite differently than what one would expect; this is what kept the movie interesting to me.

As a pilot, I thought the inverted fight sequence was far-fetched and typically Hollywood (unrealistic); but the rest of the story, thankfully, was quite believable.",1389139200,,298,6.071428571428571
5418995,5,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington did an excellent job, as usual, in his role as a drug addict. I have first hand knowledge of people who have battled with addiction and he got it right on. This was a very powerful movie and I have told all my family and friends to watch it.",1389139200,,259,4.098039215686274
5418996,5,B00AF6B22E,Kept you on the edge of your seat all the way to the end. DW is an amazing actor! Great movie!,1389139200,,94,3.5238095238095237

5418998,3,B00AF6B22E,Although I usually love anything that Denzel Washington is in this movie just doesn't deliver the wow factor. It's a good movie just not great.,1389139200,,143,4.76
5418999,5,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel doesn't disappoint. I thought it was a great movie. The story sets up that time in America, and shows the political economic side with the airline and the personal struggle with the main character.",1389139200,,204,4.857142857142857
5419000,4,B00AF6B22E,"Was pretty good, is much less about the crash and more about addiction...LOVE Denzel in any movie, he is fantastic!",1389139200,,115,4.8
5419001,5,B00AF6B22E,The streaming was great and the movie as well. It shows how a smart man can make dumb things and at the end he had the courage to admit his mistake.,1389139200,,148,3.806451612903226
5419002,2,B00AF6B22E,Does the nude part add any value to this movie? One with a negative life style provided positive energy to the society. Pretty encouraging.,1389139200,,139,4.833333333333333
5419003,3,B00AF6B22E,"Sometimes the hype for a movie is warranted and your expectations are met.  FLIGHT, while an interesting movie, is not outstanding.  The movie's trailers suggest that it is packed with action and thrills.  Yes, there are moments like that, but the majority of this film is a character study of a commercial airline pilot, played by Denzel Washington and of others.

There were a few places where better direction and tighter editing were needed and some scenes could have been shortened.  The character of lead investigator for the NTSB (Ellen Block) was intended to be a no-nonsense, strident individual.  IMHO, she over-acted, making the role a caricature of women in power.

Washington captured the nuances of his pilot character (Whip); a fast-living sky jockey who eventually needs to come down to earth to face his demons and accusers.

John Goodman's character of a 'candy-man' was well-played.  Casting him in this role was an excellent choice and he brought comedic relief to an intense scene.

Kelly Reilly played Nicole.  Her character was a troubled and struggling young woman who desperately wanted to live a different life.  Her portrayal was realistic and touching.

Set your expectations.  If you ignore the hype and watch FLIGHT more for its characters and less as a powerful, action-filled movie, you will probably enjoy it more.",1389139200,,1347,5.091324200913242
5419004,1,B00AF6B22E,Would not recommend this movie to anyone. Denzel must of been hard up for cash to subject himself to this kind of script.,1389139200,5,121,4.304347826086956

5419006,4,B00AF6B22E,Good movie but a little scary to fly without knowing the Pilot. Sure kept my attention. I surely would recommend.,1389139200,,113,4.7
5419007,4,B00AF6B22E,the movie captured your interest right in the beginning and kept it interesting for you right to the end. would have been nice if a little more content added to make it longer.,1389139200,,176,4.363636363636363
5419008,1,B00AF6B22E,I'm sure the Air Line Pilots Association endorsed this movie.. depicts poorly on a professional group of individuals that are highly regulated. Took elements (cause) of a tragic event (Alaskan Airlines crash 261) and turned it into a farce..  pitiful...,1389139200,,253,5.325
5419009,5,B00AF6B22E,Denzel was phenomenal in this role. The storyline is something different then a regular love story or action movie. I'd definitely watch it again!,1389139200,,146,5.125

5419013,2,B00AF6B22E,"If you want a realistic movie about an alcoholic airliner captain, see, ""The Pilot"" staring Cliff Robertson.  Cliff Robertson is a pilot in real life, and wrote the movie, so the procedures are genuine. I have tried to find it on DVD and streaming, to no avail.. Perhaps on VHS at a Blockbuster going out of business sale.
The movie seems to be sympathetic to the pilot played by Denzel, and keeps you hoping that he will beat the rap. Not healthy, if you ask me.",1389139200,,463,4.383720930232558

5419017,2,B00AF6B22E,Was hoping for something else - not an AA meeting. This is about addiction - not flying. Duped. Watched first half - then skipped to the end. It was painfully slow.,1389139200,,164,4.32258064516129

5419020,5,B00AF6B22E,"I love this movie its great ive seen it over n over again originally I thought it was about flying and a story of a pilot and a crash and I myself am working my way to becoming a pilot as we speak but it has nothing to do with that. The story is based around addiction and how addiction doesn't only harm the user but everyone else that person encounters addiction is a TERRIBLE thing not to be taking lightly. This movie has a dark evil to it and can deceive a younger audience to think you can get away with anything if you got a good lawyer.

Going back to the story great cast great movie (It can be slow at times)
NOT FOR PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF 18 strongly recommend not because of the sex but because the message it sends and the drugs that worse then your kid having sex they are gonna do it anyway

JUST WATCH IT AND SEE FOR YOUR SELF",1389052800,,843,3.9822485207100593

I like Don Cheadle's lawyering antics, but the final twist is what I liked the most. I wonder if what Denzel did in the movie still happen in our society where we are obsessed with NOT being found guilty of things we've done. If you want to watch a good movie, this is a really good movie.",1389052800,,387,4.243243243243243
5419030,3,B00AF6B22E,"I thought this movie was very close to the real thing...except, for the turning of the plane upside down.  Then it was a stretch that even drunk on stuff, the pilot would even think of doing such a thing.",1389052800,,204,4.230769230769231

5419033,4,B00AF6B22E,This movie was good in far as it made you think about how addiction affects more than just you.  You didn't realize that anyone even noticed his addiction until he started to talk to his fellow co-workers.  I gave it a 4 star because I don't think you needed the naked woman walking around in the very first scene and the flow of the movie could have been a little better.  Awesome landing though.,1389052800,,397,4.337837837837838

5419037,5,B00AF6B22E,"amazing acting by Denzel Washington; it is frightening to think that it probably happens quite often - alcoholic pilots,  on the other hand the pilot's reaction in this situation probably requires more than perfect training, almost supernatural instinct reaction... worth watching! especially the end!",1389052800,,301,5.840909090909091

5419043,5,B00AF6B22E,Surprising that this story would be so compelling and that one could be so drawn to these extremely flawed main characters but this movie was really awesome. John Goodman provides much needed comic relief.,1389052800,,205,5.0588235294117645

5419050,4,B00AF6B22E,"This movie was very good. It was rather predictable, but I still enjoyed the drama. Defiantly people will enjoy this film, if they are in the mood to watch a somewhat depressing story.",1389052800,,184,4.606060606060606
5419051,4,B00AF6B22E,"A total nail-biter...We didn't know much about the subject matter, only that we'd heard it was another great job by Denzel. Wow. This explores the depths to which we go sometimes, without quite knowing why. And yet, the man was unique and amazingly cool and experienced in his job, but sadly, so flawed in his character. He took a long time in learning hard, life lessons.
Recommended highly, though a bit long.. But certainly redemptive in a way that you only get hints about in the beginning.",1389052800,,494,4.689655172413793

5419055,5,B00AF6B22E,"The ending surprised me.  At first I thought the movie was glorifying drugs and excessive alcohol, but it captured the truth and utter degradation of the spirit and body of those two dangers.  Whip was finally free when he admitted it.",1389052800,,235,4.7073170731707314
5419056,5,B00AF6B22E,Not what I was expecting. I was expecting some thriller about plan accident and failure while it is more related to the human side of the characters.... Really strong performance from the cast. Highly recommended..,1389052800,,214,5.142857142857143

5419073,3,B00AF6B22E,The first 30 minutes are gripping. It is downhill after that yet this lost soul is found at the end of the movie. Anyone who flies will be scared during the flight scene. I recommend this movie as long as you know that 60% of it could be considered slow.,1388966400,,254,4.1

5419079,4,B00AF6B22E,"When I watched ""Flight,"" I kept thinking of the many times I have flown without knowing the condition of the pilot and crew.  When you think of it, it is almost more dangerous than a serious medical procedure because in those cases you at least have the protection of the other staff available to cover for the doctor.  Denzel Washington delivers a very convincing portrayal of a gifted but flawed pilot in trouble with drugs and alcohol and how the better side of his character at last triumphs.  Having flown under some less-than-optimal weather conditions, I can say the film also is pretty accurate in how it depicts the feeling inside a plane during bad weather / emergency conditions, and of course the crash scene is truly gripping.

5419123,3,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington plays an airplane pilot who is an alcoholic and a drug user. The exciting part of the movie happens near the beginning. Overtired, and under the influence, Denzel's character - Whip Whitaker - is the captain of a commercial flight. While on the flight in bad weather, the plane suffers a critical malfunction which forces the plane to dive toward the ground. Despite being under the influence, Whip's experience (presumably) and calmness causes him to take the drastic step of inverting the plane to stop the dive and give him the time to find a field to set the plane down in a crash landing. While six people die in the crash, the vast majority survive and he is lauded as a hero. We later learn that when they used a flight simulator to recreate the problem, and no other pilot could safely land the plane.

The rest of the movie focuses on the investigation of the accident, Whip's alcoholism, and his unraveling life. I felt the alcoholism was overplayed. There were also a few areas that were a little unrealistic. For instance the character Nicole. Their chance meeting in the hospital then later again as she is vacating her apartment and her lusty landlord.  I also thought the movie dragged a bit as it tried to play up the alcoholism, whether he or the plane was responsible for the accident, and the preparation for the hearing. Finally, while I thought the ending was disappointing, I think they did the right thing about accepting personal responsibility.

Despite not liking parts of the storyline, overall, I felt the acting was very good and if you like dramas, this is definitely worth watching.",1388880000,,1631,4.756183745583039

5419133,4,B00AF6B22E,You start off hating the main character played by Washington. You start to identify with the struggles the character is going through and in the end you are pulling for his character. A film that keeps you involved and stimulating.

5419156,4,B00AF6B22E,This was a pretty good movie. Seeing the main character continue to drink and do drugs in the face of a lot of problems got a little tiresome but I suppose it correctly portrays some drunks and substance abusers.,1388880000,,212,4.461538461538462
5419157,3,B00AF6B22E,Denzel Washington is an amazing actor and have seen too many better movies. This was a good movie but not comparable to some of his other work,1388880000,,142,4.296296296296297

5419163,4,B00AF6B22E,Denzel delivers. Supporting cast also delivers. Alan Silvestri (music/score) --always delivers.

5419164,1,B00AF6B22E,"Let's face it; this film has very little to do with being a pilot, flying, a plane crash, etc. It's mostly about a drunk and coke head who befriends a heroin addict.

This film has been done many times before of course, even the drunk pilot concept with Cliff Robertson in ""The Pilot"". The script writer was able to cram enough elements into this film to have something for everyone...that is except for those of us interested in well done original film-making. It's got a plane crash, sex, drugs, rock'n'roll, John Goodman as a coke dealer, a cancer victim, a heroine addict/hooker, a father-son thing, an all-star cast.

But the worst aspect of this aside from its trying to squeeze money out of a weak script by over-blowing it, is the unbelievability of the scenario. This is extremely unlikely to occur in a US commercial flight: a drunk coked-up pilot mixed with a catastrophic failure of the aircraft all at once. My final comment is that the actor playing the copilot's wife gave the the most ridiculous performance I've seen in a long time.

On one level though they came in for a perfect landing. The destination was the twin airports of BBD (big bucks made by dumbing it down) and ILD (injecting a lethal dose of Stupid into film junkies). They had a slight diversion to the city of BSC (big stars act like cartoon characters), but after connecting through the airport of OHC (overhype and crass), came in smoothly and landed on the tarmac of OPA (overpaid actors) and the final destination of OCM (overcharged moviegoers).

I recommend instead 1964's ""Fate is the Hunter"" starring Glenn Ford and Rod Taylor or my favorite flight film: ""Flight of the Phoenix"" (1965) with Jimmy Stewart, Richard Attenborough, and Hardy Kruger.",1388793600,,1737,4.78
5419165,4,B00AF6B22E,John Goodman was great - he stole the show.  Makes you think about pilots when you fly. lol good show,1388793600,,101,4.05
5419166,4,B00AF6B22E,"Alright so here it goes, Personally up until the end i hated this movie. The whole movie is basically a bunch of people trying to convince people this pilot isn't an alcoholic to save themselves. Hell he even is drunk to his court date and has to take a hit to get over the hangover. So that part i didn't like to much. What i did like was the ending. He told the truth in the end and became a better person. So i'm giving this a 4/5 not cause i like the movie but how it shows the struggles of alcoholics.",1388793600,,506,3.9705882352941178
5419167,5,B00AF6B22E,"I was disappointed to see the pilot making these types of lifestyle choices.  I know it happens, but it was shocking to see it all in the raw, unedited form.  I was sad for the pilot, because it just shows how powerful and debilitating alcohol addiction is!

It was also educational to see how big corporations (like the airlines) use lawyers to twist things around in their favor and to the detriment of the consumer.

It was also cool and funny to see the supporting actors get caught into the web of lies and dysfunction.

This movie makes me look at all pilots sideways and wonder what they did the night before!",1388793600,,616,4.464285714285714

5419172,5,B00AF6B22E,"I thought this was a great movie.  Denzel does some of his greatest acting in this film as a functional alcoholic who struggles with coming to terms with his addicition.  There's no major epihpany, no major love story, the character comes to terms on his own, and Denzel is able to tell us that story.  Well done.  Good acting, good cinematography.",1388793600,,348,4.655737704918033
5419173,3,B00AF6B22E,"As usual, great acting job by Denzel Washington!  Well done analysis of the issue of alcoholism, denial, and it's tragic consequences.  The issue of ultimately taking responsibility for our actions is well done.  It was depressing, but entertaining.",1388793600,,249,5.5
5419174,1,B00AF6B22E,"I was expecting something else, perhaps an epic court battle or an airline cover up.  This was about battling personal demons.  Sad and a little scary to think this might go on.  Sorry, but it wasn't my thing.",1388793600,,209,4.447368421052632

It merely seems to use the crash of an airliner to tell a story of previously broken lives, immorality and drug/alcohol addiction.  I thought it was going to be the story of an heroic effort to avert an air tragedy and the dramatic investigation that followed.  Instead, the writer merely used an air tragedy as an excuse to justify onscreen nudity, unfettered sexual and drug escapades and filthy gutter language.  What a waste of acting talent!  I do not recommend this movie for anyone, as I cannot name a single redeeming quality of this story and there is certainly nothing admirable about the characters portrayed.",1388793600,2,680,4.869565217391305

And he does it repeatedly. If you have the discipline to clean up your life WHY would you fall back on the eve of the chance to turn your fortunes around? What a douche.

5419216,5,B00AF6B22E,This movie kept my attention all the way through. We really have no way of knowing if the pilot who we entrust our lives to is impaired with numerous addictions. Denzel Washington made us think how we are at the mercy of the pilot and crew when traveling by air. He earned the five star rating  for excellent acting in this movie.,1388707200,,330,4.32258064516129

5419244,2,B00AF6B22E,"I was looking forward to this movie, because I thought it was about falsely accusing a pilot over a plane crash, and Denzel was going to have to fight the system to prove his innocence. For some reason that was an impression I got from earlier previews. However, that is really not what the story was about. The movie reminded me of something that might have been made int he 70's. Dark, with nudity for no reason, and a lot of drugs ad alcohol. The very beginning of the movie has a full on nudity scene (female, of course), that was just totally unnecessary to the story. You can give us the idea that this couple is having an affair without having to do that. Then after the crash, the movie is just basically about an addict who can't and doesn't want to take responsibility for his actions. The movie dragged in parts, and much of the scenes look like they can be cut out to shorten the movie for regular TV and you won't miss a thing. I had to speed through to the end of the movie, cause I just couldn't sit through the long boring scenes with watching another irresponsible person in denial. I was hoping for some spectacular ending which could make all that other stuff worth it, but I admit, it fizzled as well. I can not recommend this movie.

It is not.
This is a very gripping, compelling character development story about alcohol and alcoholism and its effects on even the most gifted and talented of people.  It about the slow spiral into the abyss and ultimately redemption.

5419260,3,B00AF6B22E,"I hated this movie's story. But that is because I am a child of an alcoholic and also an ex drug user(been sober 18 years). Seeing the scenes in it brought back memories of my old life style. I could not stand it. It was disgusting to me to watch. I cringed in some of the scenes. I almost turned it off, however I realized at the end what this movie was made for. It was not made for just anyone. It was speaking directly to alcoholics and drug users. It shows the pathetic life of a user and all the lies you have to tell just to maintain that lifestyle. It shows all the people who get hurt along the way in a users life. It wasn't speaking to non users or pilots or plane crash survivors or those who have lost loved ones in a crash. It was speaking to those who need help and don't know it. I think this movie was intended to change the drug addict or alcoholic. Or at the least make the user think about their life more seriously. If you know a user or alcoholic and want them to think about their life and their bad choices, play this movie. Make sure your not alone with the user though when watching it. You may want to invite sober people to watch as well so your not alone with an angry drunk or user when they start realizing what this movie is about. Nude scenes and heavy drug and 'alcohol use' scenes. Not for children.",1388620800,,1334,4.095419847328245

5419264,4,B00AF6B22E,"An excellent movie. However, I thought the opening scene with the naked woman parading around was completely unnecessary and had no bearing to the story line at all. Truly inspiring movie and I liked how the movie dealt with addictive behavior in a brutally  honest way. I also liked how threaded throughout the movie is the belief and disbelief in God and how non-christian's come to believe. Denzel Washington did a great job portraying a mean drunk. The movie leaves you guessing all the way to the end as to what will happen. I was totally surprised by the ending. This is not a christian movie given the language and adult content.

An addict who makes questionable life choices - choices that include sleeping around with co-workers and doing a bunch of blow before flying a commercial airliner.

In some ways this is good as it explores Whip's character, played wonderfully by Denzel Washington, as he journeys through the moral abyss of his alcoholism. However, some scenes plod along too long and the film should have been edited from 2.25 to a thirty minutes less. Also the crazy John Goodman character is a retread from his legendary Big Lebowski role.

5419291,5,B00AF6B22E,"I'm a big fan of Denzel's movies, and this one did not disappoint me. Although I doubt a pilot like the one in this movie can fly through his mishaps in real life and still maintain his job, it was interesting to see a man so cunningly get his way so many times. His acting was nothing short of excellent, and any person viewing this will find themselves spiting the main character more and more as the movie progresses.

The ending was just slightly sappy, but I don't mind. It certainly didn't take away from the overall feel of the movie.",1388620800,,541,4.356435643564357

And the visual effects of the plane maneuvering were astonishing - and scary (interpret this as ""I'm never getting into a plane if there's a storm brewing!"").  I couldn't quite believe the sudden turn-about in the hearing especially because he was still high and had been such an ultra-egomaniac.

I agree that the movie has too much nudity in the opening 10 min I think the purpose was to show the degree of consumption in all area of the character's life.

5419307,4,B00AF6B22E,"This is not another Hollywood action film, although the opening 30 minutes portrays the the crash of a passenger airliner in spectacular fashion.  As tense and unbelievable as the crash sequence is, it is not the real story here.  It merely opens the door to the lives of several people whose lives are effected by substance abuse.  The acting is top notch.  I found Denzel Washington's performance to be excellent.  The movie drew me into the story as it progressed.  In my opinion the best part of the film is the second half.
It may be important for some to note that there is some nudity in the opening scene with the use of harsh language.  Unfortunately a number of reviewers rated this film poorly due to the nudity in the early scene.  The film may not be appropriate for children.

I wanted to watch this movie for two reasons; Denzel Washington received an academy award nomination for his performance and because I was a flight attendant in my former life.  But as far as the pilot alcohol/drug problem is concerned, his behavior was pretty unrealistic, unless his behavior the morning of the crash was a one time occurrence but his actions throughout the rest of the movie suggest otherwise.",1388534400,,576,4.938144329896907

5419323,3,B00AF6B22E,I would have rated it higher but it dragged along at times.  Became fairly predictable from one episode of inebriation to another.,1388534400,,130,4.909090909090909
5419324,2,B00AF6B22E,"The first third of this movie is somewhat suspenseful/exciting (even in its negative sense), but after that, there is really no plot or story short of his drunkenness until the very end.  I would expect Denzel to have chosen a better script/message to reflect his talents.",1388534400,,272,4.913043478260869

A must watch movie. I hope it is a wake up call for some people.",1388448000,,111,4.090909090909091
5419328,3,B00AF6B22E,A fair movie. Not as good as I would have anticipated since the Star is one of my favorites. Still glad I ordered it.,1388448000,,117,3.9166666666666665
5419329,5,B00AF6B22E,This a different kind of movie for Denzel Washington--I love all of his  movies--in this movie he was a pilot  for a major airlines but he loves drugs and hard liquor and can not controll it,1388448000,,190,4.25
5419330,4,B00AF6B22E,"I would probably tend to say that most movies fit into a typical and almost predictable outcome. This movie however was different than I expected and followed through with some uexpected senarios and outcomes. This always makes a movie much more enjoyable and memerable. I will not detail any actual subject matter here because I would not want to ruin one second of the experiance for you. I will watch this movie again, so a 4 star for me. Just so you know a 5 star goes to a movie that I want to replay immediatly.",1388448000,,517,4.395833333333333
5419331,4,B00AF6B22E,I decided to watch this movie after my own flight during Christmas week.  I'm glad I waited because I don't think I would have gotten on the plane.  The possibility of the plane going out of control wasn't as frightening as the chance that the pilot could have an abuse problem.  Denzel Washington was  excellent as always & a very different type of role where he is & isn't the hero.,1388448000,,384,4.366197183098592
5419332,4,B00AF6B22E,"In this 2012 film, Director Robert Zemeckis shows-off his filmmaking chops in the films first forty-five phenomenal minutes. The plane crash in Flight is spectacular and original. A fresh new take and a welcome addition to the genre, its unlike any other plane crash Ive seen before.

Preparing for its final decent into Atlanta the MD-80 aircraft of Southjet Flight 227 severely malfunctions. The elevator, the hinged wings on the planes tail stick downward, sending the plane into a steep dive. A disastrous crash is almost certain, but with ace pilot Captain Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) at the controls, he and his crew pull off a remarkable feat and save hundreds of lives.

After the gripping first act, the rest of film the film is propelled forward solely by Washington who is in fine form, yet despite this, the film mostly drags on. Many long, unnecessary, and awkward scenes could have easily have been cut, and the film would have been better for it. Parts of the back-story of Whitakers life work great, while others are just too convenient to be believable.

Flight tries to be more than just a plane crash film. The film delves deep into the destruction alcoholism can cause, and also attempts to tackle the question of what it is to be a hero.

While drudging up some very interesting and heavy material, considering the films length of 2hr 18min, a much clearer statement of intent would have been nice. Since Captain Whitaker is an alcoholic, there is a ton of backlash against him, but the dialogue on the subject of whether or not a drunk can be a hero, is far from concluded.

7.5/10

Errata: Can an MD-80 aircraft fly upside down? These aircraft were never designed to fly inverted, obviously, but can they? According to Larry Goodrich, the films flight consultant, the answer is no, or at least not for very long. He says the aircrafts wings would lose lift, and after that the plane would come down[1].

5419337,2,B00AF6B22E,Wasn't really able to hear the movie.  The volume was so that I had to cancel before the first 20 minutes,1388448000,,105,4.0

5419339,1,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington has been one of my favorite actor and never thought this movie will be ruin by nudity scenes. There was no need for that.  I won't recommend for a family movie with young kids, teenagers.",1388448000,,205,4.54054054054054

5419342,4,B00AF6B22E,Great story line but nude scenes and cursing were unnecessary.  Could have cleaned it up went with a PG-13 rating and got 5 stars.,1388448000,,130,4.416666666666667
5419343,4,B00AF6B22E,"After viewing, I wondered why it stayed in my queue so long! Pulls you in hard and fast. Denzel seldom disappoints. A great perspective on life lessons also. Pull the trigger, it won't let you down.",1388448000,,198,4.527777777777778
5419344,5,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington, what can I say. This is one of the all time greatest actors of our time, this guy is so unbelivably versatile it's not even funny. Excellent film, this is a movie I can watch once a month.",1388448000,,207,4.2

5419348,2,B00AF6B22E,"I liked this movie somewhat but thought it was slow moving and that there was unnecessary nudity which I did not enjoy.
Danzel seems to play the same character no matter what the movie is and this is getting old.

Also found it hard to believe that flight crew would be comfortable flying with a pilot  known to drink and use drugs before flights as was revealed in this movie.  The one flight attendant lost her good friends and was hurt herself yet still hugged the pilot whom she knew was using cocaine the night before and drinking heavily.. And crashed the plane.. Give me a break!  Punch in in the nose ?.. Yes,  Hug him??? No way!!",1388448000,,638,4.372881355932203

5419355,5,B00AF6B22E,My husband & I enjoyed this movie. We rarely go out to the movies but thanks to Amazon Prime we are able to enjoy top notch movies in the comfort of our own home. As always Denzel gave a great performance & loved the suprise endind.,1388448000,,232,4.065217391304348

5419357,1,B00AF6B22E,I found the sexual/nudity content and drug use to be gratuitous.  I would not have opted to watch this movie had I known beforehand.  Beyond the aerodynamic feat there was nothing impressive.  The alcohol/drug use is the central theme to the plot but is not mentioned in the description or trailer as such.,1388448000,,306,4.735849056603773

5419362,5,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel at his best. Very cunning cerebral film.shows you how when under the influence when you have to get it together you can.

5419363,3,B00AF6B22E,"Well, it was Christmas rerun time so I watched the movie.  Very unbelievable for an airline pilot.  However, the underlining problems in his life could be somewhat believable.",1388448000,,175,5.214285714285714
5419364,2,B00AF6B22E,Whip's moment of epiphany is too convenient and gratuitous which ends up robbing any authenticity his character showed up to that point.,1388361600,,136,5.2272727272727275

5419372,5,B00AF6B22E,"Love the opening scene and wish there was more of that in there but that's just a guy being a guy I suppose! Fantastic story of an alcoholic pilot. Get this movie, you WON'T be disappointed!",1388361600,,190,4.305555555555555
5419373,3,B00AF6B22E,"I found this hard to watch.  It is slow in places, but makes its point well.  The story is one of self-discovery and coming to terms with ones choices and behaviors.  As such, it serves.  But other movies do a better job at making such a point in an entertaining fashion.  I'd recommend ""Changing Lanes"" as better entertainment with the same ""moral"".",1388361600,,350,4.580645161290323
5419374,3,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington is always a great actor, so it was worth it to watch him, but the writing of the story could have been better.

5419377,5,B00AF6B22E,"Special effects didn't realistically portray the crash because they had to be slowed enough that people could see what was happening.  I find this irritating even though I can grasp the necessity.  Much of the rest of the flight scenes are well done, though I question how well an MD-80 will fly inverted.  BTW this aircraft really did suffer from a problem with an elevator actuator problem and there were problems identifying what was going on.  There was a crash with all aboard lost.

Anyway, I found DW's anti-hero character really engaging, and the justice he accepted at the end good to see.  It was ultimately an uplifting story.",1388361600,,637,4.798165137614679

5419406,5,B00AF6B22E,"I was surprised to see the low rating of this movie.  Yes it's not all action or intense drama, but it seemed realistic to me.  It's a movie about how addiction can consume someone.  I have watched quite a few ""bio"" movies that are more about looking into a person's life verse just action or drama so it's a genre I personally enjoy.  I thought it was very good and I liked that it took a good hard look at the topic.

5419436,5,B00AF6B22E,"This was a very powerful movie about heroism. The character played by Denzel Washington, despite his heroic act, had his flaws. The question for us to consider was whether his heroism outshone his flaws. To a limited extent, we escaped the obligation to answer that question because Denzel's character was not only flawed, but self-destructive. Yet, we were left wondering if heroism had received its due or if our flaws triumph over all else. A great flick and a magnificent character study.",1388275200,,492,5.012195121951219

This movie is not just about a plane crash, it's about a man's struggle with his addiction to drugs, alcohol, lies and denial. This movie is about a pilot addicted to drugs and alcohol, who was able to (more or less) safely land a plane full of passengers completely drunk and high. But it's also a movie about his struggle to come to terms with his addiction, all the while trying to prove he was not at fault in that same plane crash.

5419481,4,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington continues to show why he is one of the best actors in Hollywood. In 'Flight' Denzel plays Whip Whitaker, an extremely capable airline pilot who also happens to be an alcoholic. After pulling off n incredible maneuver to save his plane and virtually all of the passengers and crew on board Whitaker is lauded as a hero. A series of events though reveal that Whitaker may not be the man the media has propped him up to be.

I loved Denzel's performance. He hasn't played a character this flawed and nuanced since 'Training Day.' There are many times in this film when you won't like his character. Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle both give solid performances as Whitaker's support team. John Goodman plays an almost caricature-like drug supplier. A little bit of Goodman goes a long way in this film.

The story is well written and full of moral and ethical choices the characters need to make. It's not a film for children. There is an extended nudity scene at the beginning and the language is pretty coarse throughout the film. But it's a good movie with a great performance by Washington.",1388188800,,1108,4.706185567010309

Over and over, religion is brought back to Washington, and he's uninterested. Maybe that's really what it's like to experience dependency addiction. But it was hard to get past the religious intonations constantly being shoved down your throat.",1388102400,,471,5.12987012987013
5419511,4,B00AF6B22E,If you're looking for a great action movie this isn't the one for you. Don't get me wrong the plane crash scene is outstanding! However it's only about 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of the movie you see Denzel's struggle (which he did a phenomenal job of acting). You learn in the first minute of the movie that Denzel's character clearly has a huge alcohol and drug problem. However he does the impossible he saves 100 lives while only loosing 6. No other pilot could have done what he did. However he was still drunk and high when he managed the impossible. The question in the movie is does his heroic actions eliminate the wrong of what he's done? Denzel thinks so and the movie goes on with his struggle when he won't even admit he has a problem and views himself as a hero. The true plot of the movie is truly a heart wrenching film about a man struggling with his addiction and denial. Extremely well done drama and very realistic job by Denzel.,1388102400,,955,4.370786516853933

5419513,5,B00AF6B22E,Denzel has been pitchy patchy of late so didn't know what to expect but this blew me out of the water.  It was gripping from the very first scene right to the last.  It is a great human drama of the choices and decisions we make and how those choices affect others.  It is about courage and lack of and it is about the search for happiness.

His portrayal of airline pilot Whip Whitaker, a high-functioning alcoholic in deep denial of his substance abuse, showed a complex man who is selfish, charming, strutting, stammering, cruel, heroic and vaguely aware of his moral compass. I have seen ""Flight"" 10-12 times, each time riveted by Washington's performance.

First of all, the airplane crash was so tense I forgot to breathe, but thankfully there was very little gratuitious bloodshed.  Aside from this being about the investigation into what happened to cause the plane crash, the movie is really about how a high functioning alcoholic lives his life, and what happens when it falls apart.

5419588,4,B00AF6B22E,"Drug abuse, a seldom addressed topic in any culture but even more so in aviation. This film and brilliant acting is realistic in the tactics but not the outcome. The aviation profession is not willing to risk covering someone like  the character played by Denzel Washington. So while this film provides anything but realism it is entertaining how the culture is bred around the pilot organization. Supplant another profession like surgeon, and you might even have larger protective culture around the individual. Impressive performance by all which puts many in uncomfortable positions requiring ethical decisions on the spot. A great performance which showed the disparity between denial of addiction (Washington) and fear of it (Reilly).

5419629,3,B00AF6B22E,"Hollywood is not restricted to reality.  I enjoyed watching Flight as a piece of pure fiction. I am a former pilot who worked for the FAA for 15 years.  I know almost none of the events depicted in the movie could take place in the real world.  The drug dealing union rep would have been turned in by 99% of the pilots I knew.  A pilot can roll a fighter plane upside down. Fighter planes are built for severe flight maneuvers.  An airliner would probably break apart if a pilot rolled it intentionally. Airliners are not built to fly upside down. Engines do not deliver 'full power' after they the fire extinguishing system has been used, etc.  Cocaine only masks the effects of heavy drinking in the movies.  In real life the combinations get you a ride to the ER.  In the only real incident similar to the flying conditions of Flight the airliner crashed killing all on board.  I had to get all that off my chest.  In the movie, Denzel Washington and the rest of the cast did a fantastic job of making the bizarre seem as if it could have been real.  That makes it a good movie.  I would have appreciated a disclaimer at the end saying that all of the events and people depicted were fictional.  My only real disbelief is that a pilot who could stay calm during the harrowing landing would fall apart during an NTSB hearing.  I found myself imagining alternate endings where he would have handled the final question in the same manner as the character portrayed the entire rest of the film.",1387756800,,1493,4.4411764705882355

I thought it was going to be an action movie and the action was the plane crash at the beginning.  Nope - not my kind of movie!,1387584000,,303,3.8548387096774195

5419664,5,B00AF6B22E,very good movie. pushes the line between what is right and what is wrong. you have to watch it to fully understand what I am saying,1387584000,,131,4.076923076923077
5419665,5,B00AF6B22E,"Once again, a top-notch role portrayed by a top-notch actor and supporting cast! This movie leaves you gasping for more, in what becomes a bittersweet film about the essence of a man's fragmented life as an airline pilot. I have seen many reviews stating this film was a ""bait and switch,"" advertising as one thing, but is actually another. I think that mentality comes from a person not reading between the lines, and making assumptions about a movie before they watch it. If anybody claims to know the caliber of actor that Denzel Washington is, they should realize that his characters always add another dimension or two to any movie he is in. The point is to never underestimate Denzel Washington's ability to breathe a visceral reality into any film.

I will not go into much detail about the movie in this review, but I will tell you that this is not a story about a plane crash as much as it is a story of a struggling and flawed human being. This is the story about ""Whip,"" a pilot who has become a drug-dependent alcoholic, leading to his wife divorcing him and the estrangement of his son, who he loves dearly. He is a man holding it together by a very thin thread, and by very unacceptable means. Despite his flaws, he is very good pilot. He is forced to make a life and death decision when a plane he is piloting malfunctions at 30 thousand feet. Because of his composure under pressure, he is able to save a lot of lives. This event merely sets the stage, and the movie revolves around the resulting investigation by the NTSB over the weeks following the event. The Investigation results in him being praised for his actions on one hand, but on the other, focuses in on toxicology reports the day of the plane crash, showing alcohol and drugs in his system and bringing to light his alcohol dependency. In this discovery, he stands to face a lifetime sentence in prison despite his valiant efforts. Throughout the movie, you see just how much he struggles to keep himself sober, and level-headed in the face of the inquiry. You start to see the strained friendships of the people trying desperately to help him, and the new friendships he makes along the way. The movie leads up to his own revelations about himself and the people he has lied to and hurt through his alcoholism. In conclusion, this film provides a realistic and visceral glimpse into the lives of functioning addicts.
I would recommend this film to anyone wanting to escape into a world that makes them grateful for what they have and the people who love them. Yes, there is some nudity and drug-use depicted in the movie, but the film would not work without this aspect. This movie is for those who realize that ife isn't always rainbows and butterflies, so if you want that sort of thing, I would recommend something else... say, from the Disney-Pixar line-up.",1387584000,,2842,4.605522682445759

This movie takes the lives of the way too many people dealing with addiction and digs a hole in your indifference to them. Yes there is nudity right at the start, shocking you into the scene, for there is no quiet way to bring your mind into this space.

You continue to watch through the crash scene only to find yourself once again face to face with addictions lies and loss. How will he recover? Will he find his way out? What will become of this drunken hero? The word ""Powerful"" at the bottom of the cover only scratches the surface of Denzel Washingtons performance here.

I felt the story line had realism although the movie kind of dragged in the second half.  Denzle stayed true to form delivering a good performance for the role as captain. I felt the writer could have given us more storyline and even more sub plots would have helped this movie not to drag so much.

I have to say this turned out to be one of the most gripping movies I've seen all year. Denzel Washington gives a superb, Oscar calibre performance as a pilot, a man who obviously had the potential to do great things, but whose addiction consumes him and threatens to destroy his life and the lives of those around him.
The movie gets off to a wild start with a fantastic action/adventure scene on a plane, then quickly shifts to a compelling study of addiction. The cast was solid, the story, in no way predictable (other than a last minute ""falling off the wagon"" scene- but even that took an unexpected turn). The characters had great depth, and humanity and the movie didn't stop with exploring the addicts' behavior, but also turned the lens on those people surrounding the addicts, both enablers and those who help them recover.

5419694,3,B00AF6B22E,"This is a story (not a true-life story), but a story about an ace-pilot, who is an alcoholic and cocaine user.  All the way through the movie he lies to himself, his family, his friends, and everybody else because of his underlying desire to drink all the time.  He is so drunk all the time that he ""has to"" use cocaine to get him up and running, so he can function as a pilot. As a ""functioning alcohol"", only those close to him know what is really going on with his alcohol and cocaine abuse.  The ""big day"" finally comes when he has to pilot a 102 passenger plane with what turned out to be a defective elevator.  He has to roll the plane upside down to get it out of a nose dive, and then roll it back again right-side-up to land it in a field.  Everyone believes he is a hero, until things start to unravel because of his alcoholism.  What I loved about this movie was the ending, because the pilot finally came to gripes with his addictions.  It all came to a head in a Federal hearing, when he was asked if it was his opinon that one of the deceased flight attendants consumed the two, (empty) vodka bottles found on board the doomed flight.  Up to that point, he had been lying all through the hearing. He could have pinned it on her and walked away ""free"", but his conscience finally gets the best of him and he admits he drank the vodka on board, that he drinks all the time to excess, that he was drunk every day up to the date of flight, and that he was drunk now in court.  I won't tell you the whole ending - but it gets better.  I gave it three stars because of some nudity, rampant use of the ""f"" word, and cocaine use scenes.  The movie story and acting was very good and the movie made an impact on me concerning the importance of always being open and honest, telling the truth, and thus being truly free from living a lie and carrying around all the baggage that goes along with it.  Great impact at the end.  That's it.",1387497600,,1940,4.1550802139037435

As myself a recovering alcoholic for over a year now, I was a little surprised he convicted himself when he did not have to since he was ""taken care of"" by his attorney's, but the message here was had he not admitted complete defeat from his alcohol problem, he might not have been sober and recovered as he was in the end.

The aircraft would then have entered an inverted climb, eventually resulting in a stall/spin from the inverted position.  Even if rolling inverted has worked, when he rolled back up, the A/C would have immediately nosed over and crashed, not allowed him to now fly the aircraft and make a crash landing.

The narrative itself was wonderfully nuanced; Washington's character is both heroically capable as a pilot and utterly inept as a human being, saving lives and wrecking them. On the surface, the action is initiated by the incident with the plane, but the movie develops into a compelling drama centering on the inner space of an alcoholic.

I agree that the drugs, sex, and alcohol had to be established in the film, but, for my taste, it was a bit too graphic and gratuitous.  Heck, the very first scene flaunts a fully nude female and the use of two lines of COKE.  As you no doubt suspect, there is a plane crash and the condition of the pilot becomes an issue.  The film's success is assured because a very flawed man finally sees the truth about himself and steps way up to do the right thing.  I would've given this film five stars if it had toned down the use of drugs a bit and maybe been a little less graphic with the nudity.

Some of the acting and even the actual flight was hard for me to stomach. I found the flight and the actions of the plane to be a bit on the unrealistic  and dramatic side. That is just my opinion, others may disagree.  I guess that is just the hollywood spin tho.

5419751,1,B00AF6B22E,"This movie should have been a great movie, but it was more about messaging, product placement and cliche. I've never seen a bad Denzel Washington movie until now. The film gave me the impression it had been written and directed by two different sets of writers and directors.

One moment I found my self completely involved in the story saying ""great movie"", then suddenly I'm holding the remote warning the thing "" your about to go."" It had just enough thin story most times to stop me from turning it off except twice. Once when he discovered the open room with the booze. I turned it back on just to see if this movie could really be this stupid. Then John Goodman's character shows up, and Denzel does the strut to the hearing. At that point I was glad I turned it back on, but when the pilot regressed back to that 'Movie Of The Weep"" character, I turned it off for good.

I'm sorry, this movie was not a believable nor plausible story or plot. It was a compilation of random information, cliches and gibberish. If they wanted to make the point that heavy drinking will make you act stupid and crazy, well they succeeded in that. Washington's character stepped out of character many times.

5419798,2,B00AF6B22E,"This movie had a lot going for it but just did not live up to its potential.  The actors are great and the story concept is very interesting.  Credit is also due for the special effects wizards that realized the plane crash (the cell phone footage version of it toward the end of the film is spectacular).  Below is a list of some things that I feel could have been done to make this a more enjoyable film.

1. Cut out about 20 minutes of the existing film.  The majority of this could come off of the repetitive story between Denzel and the Nicole character.  Also, cut the annoying scene on the hospital stairwell with the creepy cancer guy.
2.  Give Melissa Leos character more screen time.  They mention her a few times early on but she doesnt get a real scene until the last 15 minutes if the film.  This is a pity since she is so great in this part.  They should have tweaked the script to make her more of an antagonist with scenes throughout the entire film.  This could have added some excitement to the film up a bit since it bogged down so much after the crash.
3. Let Denzel get away with it.  They spend the majority of the film trying to make us sympathetic to him and convincing us he is a hero only to pull the rug out in the last five minutes.  Wouldnt the victims and the public at large be better served by believing he is a hero (he did save hundreds of lives)?  His substance abuse problem at least according to the film did not cause the plane to malfunction in any way.",1387065600,,1492,4.207746478873239

5419836,5,B00AF6B22E,Flight is a tremendous movie in my opinion.  The only flaw in the whole thing is at the beginning when they took off in bad weather.  In real life that wouldn't have happened.

5419840,3,B00AF6B22E,I don't want to spoil this for others. it's doubtful someone engaging in the pilot's behavior is likely to have an attack of conscience but the movie keeps you engaged and was overall a good story line. worth a try although don't be surprised if instills a 'fear of flying' if you've ever wondered what really goes on in that cockpit.,1386979200,,334,4.491803278688525

5419847,4,B00AF6B22E,"Other than the plane crash,  I thought it was realistic and heartfelt.  Not a pretty sight to see but a problem that plague's a large percentage of society. Alcoholism and drugs that is. Plus what I thought was top notch acting.",1386892800,,228,4.536585365853658

5419857,4,B00AF6B22E,This is a pretty ugly truth about humans - very compelling and a little frightening.  Don't watch just before flying - you will definitely be looking twice at the captain of the plane,1386892800,,183,4.545454545454546

There were a couple of minor cliches, but, again, the story was solids, the main characters well developed and I learned that cocaine can mask the obvious signs of intoxication.  I do neither, but it could come up in Trivial Pursuit.  As a pilot with 35 years experience, I was humbled that I would have crashed the plane.  Perhaps that's why nobody has ever asked me to sly their plane in a movie.",1386892800,,553,4.649484536082475

5419917,3,B00AF6B22E,"This movie struggles in ways a movie shouldn't.  The acting is tremendous and the dialogue is in most cases frank and honest.  Denzel is obviously playing an addict who is used to covering up his drinking issues in life.  But what begins as a powerful movie about a pilot dealing with his demons and regrets finding redemption through what one might call an 'Act of God' (whether he found faith in himself or a religion would be irrelevant) ends on a depressing and irritatingly incomplete note.

Denzel's character 'Whip' Whittaker is obviously skating through life with no real purpose, using his excess income for booze, women and to partake in illicit substances.  The first third or so of the movie sets up an engaging story and plot where you are invested in this genuinely good but misguided antihero who cares about everyone but himself.  However, instead of character growth throughout the movie and a resolution the audience can find solace in (a fundamental justice or equity for him saving so many lives), the movie is a downward spiral of personal struggle and poor guidance from his friends.  We are thrown into the realm of wheelings and dealings to beat the bureaucracy of the NTSB and the court system.  This destroys Whip and causes him to eventually give up and although sober, he goes to prison a remorseful man.

The seriousness of addiction should be counterbalanced by the hope for redemption.  In this movie we are watching a train wreck of a man who is ignored on a personal level by friends who don't realize the degree of help he needs.  As train wrecks are won't to do, it leads to an inevitable conclusion of being jailed for addiction when all the evidence clearly shows a mechanical failure is to blame, namely a jack-screw failure.  It is thoroughly irritating that ultimately circumstantial injuries or deaths the audience and the characters know to be out of his control are blamed on him and used in the story to drive a sense of guilt for saving the lives of so many people.

That isn't to say this movie is poor, but simply uninspiring and depressing in the inequity of the ending.  Instead of focusing on his good aspects and on the fact that addiction can be overcome and while it consumes it does not eradicate a person, the movie focuses only on the negatives until its heartless (though sober) conclusion.  This movie simply tries too hard to flip a great deed into a terrible evil simply to illustrate the destructive effects of addiction instead of telling a story with a more honest appraisal of how alcoholism ultimately hurts everyone.  Instead we are told it is irrelevant and not only can you probably operate a vehicle safely while on a cocktail of substances, if you're good enough you will save lives.  It just doesn't matter because it's illegal anyway so don't try it or you'll go to jail.  Huh?",1386633600,,2849,4.721212121212122

His performance  was simultaneously refreshing and disturbing, yet lending an air of believability that subtly nudges you to quietly root for his triumph. Denzel plays both the protagonist and antagonist as he battles the tortuous demons within. Although the ending was predictable, the events leading up to the conclusion were solid and self-affirming, leaving little room for argument or debate.

I sure didn't.

I got so sick of watching the character portrayed by Denzel Wahington, I stopped the film about halfway through.  I didn't enjoy the film's preachy tone, and farfetched story line, which I think is insulting to professional airline pilots and crewmembers.

5419981,4,B00AF6B22E,"I wanted to see this movie originally in the movie theater thinking with the big screen and nice sound system, it would be a great film for that. But as usual (mostly anyway), I let the first week go by and after that, there are other things to do and this movie got put on the 'backburner' to watch when it came out to rent. But with Amazon Prime, I didn't have to even do that. I was able to stream it 'free' at home which was nice. Another thing I seem to do lately with Prime movies, is to not watch all of the movie in one evening. This one took three different days and not all concurrently. I would say that it took a good week until the third night to finish this. But I am glad I did. It is a very powerful movie in it's message of life and death and of Alcoholism and freedom, and friends and family.

Anyway, I don't want to give away any of the story, other reviews might do that? I just want to say that there is a lot going on in this movie on a few different levels. It has nudity in the beginning, a bumpy plane ride, smoking, drinking, snorting, language, drunkenness (first time I ever spelled that word), so for the younger kids, I don't recommend it. But for adults, by the time you finish this movie, you will have cried some and laughed some and felt something emotional when it's all said and done!

I recommend this movie for sure for adults that can handle all of the above which does occur in the movie to portray this story around the pilot played by Denzel Washington, who does a believable role for this movie. All of the supporting cast does a fine job also to make the movie what it is.

I recommend it, I just wish for the good old days when I was able to watch a movie in it's entirety!! in one seating.",1386374400,,1736,4.1

The action is nail-biting (first 35 minutes of the movie are pure white-knuckle, grip your chair), the acting is fantastic (this is expected of Denzel) and the characters are deep - deeply complex and flawed. This is an all around fantastic drama. Highly recommend it. It was just as good if not better the 2nd time (even though you know the turns the story takes).",1386288000,,418,4.5131578947368425

I had high hopes for the movie, but it's very ordinary...and rarely misses an opportunity to give you a cliche character or scene.

However there were several dragging scenes which were unnecessary making this movie long. At the beginning of the movie, there was frontal nudity which was uncalled for (dont know if that's supposed to be an art!) & made the movie cheap. Profane language was also used throughout the movie. There was a time wherein the momentum was building up then was flattened again by a dragging scene. We just wanted to finish the movie coz we already spent time watching it! It's a good thing we didn't watch this in the theater & save ourselves money!

As a recovering alcoholic, I was truly amazed that a movie could capture the feeling of the absolute trap that alcohol is. There are other movies that straddle the same storyline, but this was deeply moving and in the end inspiring in the way that religion, love, and forgiveness can make all the difference in the world.

The scene in the hotel room near the end is priceless... and every alcoholic knows that quiet knock, that barely perceptible call that  alerts us that there is alcohol somewhere close. This scene may seem hard to believe for others, but believe me it is very real.

Everything wrapped up nicely when Denzel's character was in the courtroom at the end. I was truly surprised by the choice he made.

Very powerful movie!",1386115200,,1013,4.732954545454546

Very seldom have I been disappointed by his movies, that said, when I started watching Flight I was not so sure I made a good choice.  I kept watching and I have to say I grew to love it.  The story information may be hard to watch for some but it rings very true because I remember the days when some Pilots used to drink all the time in the various lounges in the airports I traveled through.

As a matter of fact I met quite a few pilots back in the day and shared a few drinks with them to settle my fear of flying nerves.  These days though I am glad that the Airline industry is doing a better job of helping pilots with their possible addictions.  Denzel portrayed a very likable but Flawed human being who just happened to be a pilot, John Goodman is funny enabling friend and Don  Cheadle plays a great lawyer trying to save Denzel's character. Tamara Tunie is a great Stewardess friend too.

Don't want to give away too much but this one is a keeper and good addition to my Denzel collection.  See for yourself.

5420048,5,B00AF6B22E,Great Movie. Don't miss first 5 minutes. Based on a real commercial Aviation accident. Yet in real life they did not make it.,1386028800,,125,4.478260869565218
5420049,3,B00AF6B22E,"Well acted with a good cast (and John Goodman is a special treat, as always). The special effects at the beginning of the film were really sub-par for Hollywood these days, but this movie is not really about a plane crash at all. An interesting psychological drama about a man's destructive lifestyle and his testing to see how far he can run from it before facing his ultimate judge: himself. This has been done many, many times over in better films (Elmer Gantry, Citizen Kane, Picnic, and on and on). It was an entertaining movie, just not a great one.",1386028800,,555,4.56

5420054,5,B00AF6B22E,"Enjoyed the movie -- that ends with an unexpected twist.  Not so much about the flight itself, but about people, real human beings, not just ""heroes"".",1386028800,,150,4.769230769230769
5420055,5,B00AF6B22E,I love Denzel and this was a great character for him to play. It is more about alcoholism and relationships than the crash.,1386028800,,123,4.391304347826087
5420056,3,B00AF6B22E,"I liked this, but I thought the build up toward the end could have been done better.

5420062,5,B00AF6B22E,"Acting is excellent, casting is good, moves along well in spite of the action and graphic stunts all being up front in the first 15 minutes.  There is a moral conflict that is thought provoking and the movie has an ending positive message.",1386028800,,239,4.558139534883721

5420064,4,B00AF6B22E,Held my interest. Good story line. I iike Danzel's movies. He is rich enugh so that he can pass on scripts that are lacking in quality so if you watch one of his movies it is giong to be worth it.,1386028800,,196,3.8048780487804876
5420065,4,B00AF6B22E,Denzel delivered again. powerful performance depicted a drunkard pilot who lands a falling plane. Stupendous performance. Bravo! I would see this again.,1385942400,,152,5.954545454545454

5420067,5,B00AF6B22E,Very good show. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Some nudity/drugs/foul language; wouldn't recommend for younger audience. Denzel Washington is awesome.,1385942400,,151,5.608695652173913
5420068,5,B00AF6B22E,Excellent movie!  I'd heard how good it was and never had the chance to see it in the theater.  When it popped up as a choice the other day we decided to watch it.  Denzel Washington absolutely rocks his character in this movie.  It's a must see!,1385942400,,246,4.170212765957447
5420069,3,B00AF6B22E,A good drama that dealt with the internal struggle with alcoholism.  Overall i would recommend for someone who likes other Denzel Washington movies.,1385942400,,148,5.434782608695652
5420070,4,B00AF6B22E,Entertaining! Drags a little throughout but maintains its suspense. Story ended favorably well. Denzel of course comes off smashing as usual.,1385942400,,141,5.761904761904762

5420072,3,B00AF6B22E,"The whole story seemed totally implausible that he was the only one who could land the plane having been a drunk most of his life and the fact that he was drunk the night before and the day of the flight.
The ending was so forced and moralistic.  The best part of the whole movie was John Goodman's drug dealing character.

It was free for me because I have Amazon Prime but I wouldn't have paid for it.",1385942400,,403,4.153846153846154
5420073,2,B00AF6B22E,"Glad this movie was ""free"" with Amazon Prime, if I'd paid to see this I would've been beyond pi$$ed.

The only reason to watch this movie are the first 20 minutes including the full frontal nude scene with Nadine Velasquez and the crazy flying and crash. Hence the two star rating 1 star for epic nude scene and 1 for unique airplane crash creativity.

The rest of the movie is weak on plot, reaching, and typical of modern Hollywood ""drama"" BS.

That this movie averages above three stars on Amazon makes me doubt the IQ of my fellow Amazon users, I mean seriously doubt it.",1385942400,,575,4.457142857142857
5420074,4,B00AF6B22E,"Very moving film. Not what I expected, but the story was compelling and while not as much action as I had hoped for, it was definitely worth seeing. This is more of an emotional drama with some very hard to watch scenes. Denzel pulled it off in remarkable fashion and there are quite a few moments where I wanted to yell at the screen.",1385942400,,335,4.25

I have a friend who wanted to see it. I warned her over and over about how trasy it was in the opening. She was a senior lady. She watched it and was appalled! I told her. He must have needed money to make this movie. MD-80s can not fly upside down. Get past the opening and its a pretty good movie.",1385942400,,473,4.096774193548387

This movie was totally predictable if you are a airline pilot or even a mechanic, the reason I say mechanic is because I was one for about 16 years.  That was the sorriest job I ever had or ever will.
Screw drinking.  I used to have to work 16 hours a flippn day(mandatory), sometimes 3 or 4 days in a row, for s*** money as well.  It's a damn wonder that this s*** doesn't happen more often.  BELEIVE me,  There is not an airline out there that can't kiss my lily white.

5420099,4,B00AF6B22E,"This movie is unique in the way that it was not only about flying, not only about addiction, not only about getting sober. It's a story about all of the above, and after all said, it's a story about hope. Although tragic and legally defeating that the pilot has to go through the stages of trials and tribulations to reach his shore of peace, there was a morally uplifting and liberating aspect about someone's being honest to himself and moving forward. The flight scene was awesome and I find that critical moment of controlling the descent a technical marvel, seems very plausible.

5420102,4,B00AF6B22E,"I agree that the full nudity was not necessary to the plot. The other girl who he met in the hospital was definitely not needed in the movie either, but for some odd reason, the writers wrote her into such a large part of the movie. However, I did think that Denzel's performance was top-notch and his performance was moving (as always). I liked the change and self-realization his character experienced and he did the right thing in the end. I wish we could transplant Denzel's performance into another writer's story who didn't choose to keep all the ancillary stuff that did not add to the plot at all. I still give this a 4 as Denzel redeemed it from a 3.",1385769600,,659,4.409836065573771

5420128,3,B00AF6B22E,"It's okay - pretty unbelievable movie - and I realize it's a movie, but it's also rather depressing and bleak in addition to the almost-horrific plane crash.",1385683200,,157,4.851851851851852
5420129,5,B00AF6B22E,"All the comments about nudity are silly. It's just a scene to set the tone for the reckless lifestyle the pilot is living. Besides, Nadine Velazquez is quite beautiful in that scene.

There are so many, but here are a few of my favorite scenes:

The lead up to the crash. ""We're gonna roll it."" Washington and Brian Geraghty were brilliant in that. Washington for his cool control and Geraghty for his aghast yet still maintaining professionalism and executing commands.

Harling Mays enters the hospital ward. Classic modern day pusher. Bling, blending in. Seeing Goodman with Washington brought back memories of ""Fallen."" You hate that cocaine is what makes them ""buddies"" in Flight, yet there is something about their relationship that also feels good. You know they have each others back.

The hospital stairway scene with Washington, Kelly Reilly and James Badge Dale were great in that unusual scene. Dale philosophizing as a dying man was really thought provoking. His insight into why they had ""accidentally"" converged in that stairwell proved to be key to the rest of what happened in the move.

Washington pays unexpected visit to his ex wife's home. Great scene showing how a drunk no longer processes decorum properly. Washington thinks he is being a great dad in that scene, but has actually brought terror into that home. I almost felt sorry for Washington in that scene. I knew he was lost when I saw it. Of course, like a good alcoholic, seconds later he was giving a sentimental statement to the press that indeed garnered sympathy.

All the scenes with Kelly Reilly. Great actress. The British actresses Georgia peach accent was awesome. The real fun was racking my brain trying to figure out who the heck she was. I nearly kicked over the table when ""Caroline Bingley"" popped into my brain. Yeah, she plays a fairly raunchy character in the beginning, but there is still something pure about her and that plays out well in the final scenes.

Washington finds the stash of booze in the adjoining hotel suite. Like a lot of viewers, I really prayed on that one hoping he wouldn't mess up the effort at staying sober. The long focus on that lone tiny bottle of destruction and then his hand swooping in to grab it was great cinema.

Washington with Reilly outside her new job. Really a nice, hopeful, scene, but when she mentions the AA meeting, you know things are about to go downhill.

The hearing scene with ""Miss Block."" All the great men sitting there waiting for Washington to put them back in secure positions. The press waiting to confirm him a bona fide ""hero"" but his love and respect for all of the women in the movie, especially Trina, Nicole and Margaret, overcomes him and he decides it's ""now or never."" Again, I was left a bit dismayed thinking about all the effort that had gone into patching things up for him, but the overriding thought was that him taking himself out of the sky with lives in his hands at the controls of jet airplanes was the right thing to do, despite the appearance that that is not why he did it.

Overall, a 5 star movie for me because it was just so very different than any movie I've ever seen. Very entertaining and thought provoking.",1385683200,,3196,4.691071428571429

The acting was over the top.

Rating this only one star because the director and productor used the olded cliche in the book - the Perry mason defense; where the person on trial stands-up at the last minute and confesses.

This crappy ending has been the part of the movies for 70+ years and is is stupid - was hoping that the writers would be smart enought to figure some other way of ending but it looks like they just reused the same old legal drama that nobody in their right mind would find convincing",1385683200,3,576,4.26605504587156

5420154,4,B00AF6B22E,"For those of us in the airline business, the early scenes of Flight hit too close to home. I see myself and my cohorts as potential causalities in these scenarios and it's plain uncomfortable. It's a dangerous job we do-- when rules aren't followed. I've never been guilty of intoxicating late night overnights; in fact, most of my cohorts are darn responsible on short overnights and follow the rules. Believe it or not. However, every apple has it's seeds, bad ones included.

Whip's expert recovery skills are nothing short of impressive. Sober or not, his ability to recover an inverted plane is heroic and left me, guilty so, internally applauding him despite the fact that in preceding scenes he is shown illegally consuming alcohol from the airplane's galley.

I felt conflicted. Is he likeable? I didn't know what to make of the Whip. I spent the entire film with a devil on one shoulder and an angel on the other, both being little Whip's trying to change my mind.

On one hand, he's an arrogant prick that breaks all the rules. He's in denial and doesn't believe he's an alcoholic and drug addict-- this tragically resulting in a divorce from his wife and estrangement from his son. He is a liar, who immediately after the crash, tries to shift blame on faulty maintenance and manufacturing issues. At the funeral of Trina, a flight attendant with whom he had an affair, he selfishly and inappropriately asks a surviving flight attendant to lie to the NTSB about his condition that day, leaving her in disbelief.

One the other hand, he does show genuine remorse. Guilt even. He trashes his alcohol and flushes his drugs, determined not to use again, then he relapses. Again. And again. There is a long pause in a hotel scene where he puts down a bottle of alcohol. We wait. We think he's resisted only to see his hand violently grab the bottle after all. He is a struggling individual and I sympathized with that. He's relatable because many of us have addictions and we all have internal struggles. He rescues a drugged addicted woman from an abusive landlord. He is also a talented pilot that calmly saved all but six lives on his plane, a feat every other pilot failed to do in a simulator.

In the end, we see an epiphany in Whip. Ironically, what happens to him is a happy ending. He is no longer lying to himself and even states that he is now ""free"" and is approached with a question from his son that many of us struggle with, ""who are you?"" Once again, a question I was conflicted on throughout the film when trying to determine if I liked Whip or not.

Overall, this is a very enjoyable film. It does a very interesting job at examining the complexities of a human being. No one is strictly good or bad, right or wrong. We all have faults and we all have strengths, as evident in Whip's character. Great film.",1385683200,,2830,4.571992110453649

It's hard playing an addict for any actor. The reason is, they have to really understand the underlying issues in order to pull it off on screen. Denzel does this and more. The writers really had a direction with this movie and I really love how they put it together in the end.

This movie does have a great action seen with a large passenger jet flying inverted to a crash landing, but the movie is much more than that. It's about an addict who finally realizes that his actions (while using) do not only effect himself, but everyone around him he is responsible for.",1385596800,,735,4.364963503649635

I haven't watched an R-rated movie for a long time and this just blew my mind. My husband and I were shocked with the amount of nudity in the opening scene. The woman he was with (who was one of the flight attendants on his plane) openly flaunted her body, and I mean the whole thing! I was stunned that they showed everything, front and back! Usually you get a glimpse of some boob or butt, but it was the whole thing - pubic hair, boobs, and butt. Several times too! The part with the drug addict girl going to the porn studio was terrible too. And the language was so foul! It's gotten much worse than I remember. I waited to turn it off because I wanted to see the actual plane crash, because those effects are what caught my eye in the trailer, but it wasn't that great either. We finally turned it off when his friend came to see him the day after the crash. It was just so full of terrible language! I couldn't stand to watch it anymore. I must be very sheltered, but I didn't see the need to continue to fill my mind with the garbage they were portraying in this movie.

5420196,5,B00AF6B22E,In the end he had the integrity to own up to his problems and did not let the innocent airline attendant take the fall for him. The acting was outstanding.,1385424000,,155,4.2
5420197,3,B00AF6B22E,Compelling story tells about 2 very different sides of a hero. You are torn between supporting him for his heroics or scorning him for his weak character.,1385424000,,154,4.7407407407407405
5420198,5,B00AF6B22E,I had never seen this so the movie was definitely a pleasant surprise!  Denzel Washington is a wonderful actor but really shows his skill in his craft in this movie!,1385424000,,165,4.5
5420199,3,B00AF6B22E,"Good morality play.  The theme of ""Flight"" was carried of pretty well.  Goodman character was a sort of cartoon and a little distracting.",1385424000,,137,4.913043478260869

5420205,4,B00AF6B22E,Always enjoy Denzel; smooth and real actor regardless of the likability of the character. He's always human. Great action sequences. Unexpected outcome,1385424000,,151,5.909090909090909

5420207,4,B00AF6B22E,Can't really ever go wrong with a Denzel flick. John Goodman was funny as hell for the little bit he was in the movie.,1385424000,,118,3.9583333333333335
5420208,4,B00AF6B22E,"A good representation of a person with serious drug and alcohol problems and the consequent serious messes it creates in his life. However, the story --- the plot --- has twists and turns that I found hard to believe. John Goodman steals the show as the ""friendly"" drug dealer.

5420212,4,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. He is such a versatile talent, and in this movie he delivers once again. He plays an air-force veteran and pilot who struggles with substance dependency and struggles to manage the loss of his father and the alienation of his wife and teenage son. Things get worse following an all-night bender. His plane suffers a critical mechanical failure, and despite skillfully saving most of the passengers and crew on what everyone agrees was a doomed aircraft, investigators learn of his intoxication prior to and during the flight. During his post-crash recovery, he meets a woman going through a very similar drug dependency who is struggling with the loss of her beloved mother. They strike up a relationship as they try to free themselves from their addictions. Despite her success, he fails to follow in her footsteps, and he falls heavily to drugs as it appears he may lose his career and go to prison. His friend, a pilot-union-rep who has known him since his military days, sets him up with a top attorney, and they just might be able to save him from himself..if he can lie well enough..but he trips and falls flat on his face when he can ill-afford it. In the end, he decides what is most important is his family, his friends, and coming clean, admitting the truth, and accepting responsibility. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",1385424000,,1366,4.743697478991597

5420218,5,B00AF6B22E,"I tend to rate movies for performances, so 5 stars it is. As I watched ""A Soldier's Story,"" I remember thinking, this is the moment Denzel Washington becomes a star. It's a weird and rare opportunity when a viewer gets to witness that moment in an actor's career.  In ""Flight"", so many years later, I again witness a star in the making, this time a mature actor embarking on the next wealth of roles to come.",1385337600,,408,4.368421052631579

5420224,4,B00AF6B22E,Well done balanced movie. Will Smith is superb and believable. More than a crash movie. Good backstory and definitely an adult's movie.,1385337600,,135,5.181818181818182

5420229,3,B00AF6B22E,"Unlike most movies, this one started out with a bang and fizzled out as it approached the predictable end. Good acting though and it was refreshing to see a movie that was not carried mostly on the shoulders of just special effects.",1385337600,,232,4.5476190476190474

From the first scene, where he expertly guides his plane through a horrific thunderstorm during takeoff, to his brave manipulation of the plane during the crash scene, and finally his breakdown when being questioned under oath, he made this movie very exciting!!  This movie was a combination of Apollo 13 and Leaving Las Vegas!!!  One of Denzel's best!!!",1385337600,,422,5.268656716417911
5420236,3,B00AF6B22E,Slow moving after initial opening scenes.  More action scenes would have made it more enjoyable.  Just another story of a person fighting alcoholism.,1385251200,,149,5.434782608695652
5420237,5,B00AF6B22E,Very very good movie. Another highlight of the Denzel Washington filmography. It start like an action movie but turns into a good and powerful drama.,1385251200,,149,5.0

5420239,2,B00AF6B22E,"I found the trailer more intriguing than the actual movie. The ending was particularly disappointing as it didn't present a clear explanation for the conclusion which seemed to contradict other evidence presented over the course of the movie.

5420244,3,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington is portrayed as a gifted airline pilot who performs an exceptional flight maneuver on a jet liner in a spiral death dive due to mechanical failure within the aircraft flight controls; he manages to invert the aircraft flying upside down to avoid crash and manages to revert flight position to crash land in a field, thus preventing loss of all person's lives on board.  He does this while intoxicated with alcohol and cocaine in his system.  During the NTSB investigation toxicology reveals his intoxicated status; however, he maintains that he saved all the lives of the survivors.  In the weeks following the crash he continues his alcoholic and drug consumption in spite of the necessity for him to give them up; on the night before the NTSB hearing he goes on a binge of alcohol and is found intoxicated on the bathroom floor; in order to ready himself for the hearing, he calls in a drug dealer who gives him cocaine to recover from his binge.  He is informed during the investigation that nine other airline pilots were placed in simulators and could not maneuver the jet liner to avoid a crash  under the flight conditions that he faced during the morbid crash.
In the interim from his recovery from the crash injuries and release from the hospital, he has had ample opportunity to obtain assistance for his alcohol/drug additions but refuses and maintains that he chooses to drink and has control.  In the end, all of his denial catches up with him, he finally admits at the NTSB hearing that he was intoxicated during the flight, goes to jail for several  years, and finally feels ""free"".  For all the pain and misery caused by his addiction to his family, friends, the crash victims and all those who tried to help him, he feels exonerated of his guilt and addition problem by his apologies written to all those offended.  This film portrays the influence of the current drug/alcohol addition culture in society and how that culture attempts to deal with the issues of living a lie and addiction by imposing more addictive remedy for the victim.  The redeeming feature is revealed finally when the addicted individual admits the truth to him/herself and society and can become free of the addition, denial and lies in their life.  The unfortunate issue raised by this film is that there is much truth about modern societies' dependency upon drugs/alcohol in order to function.  I gave this a three star rating due to the promoting attitude in the movie that addiction and alcoholism is treated with cocaine inhalation to bring about a semblance of ""normal"" function in a social setting, i.e. the NTSB hearing event.",1385164800,,2643,4.823008849557522

5420246,4,B00AF6B22E,Denzel Washington was great--as always. Was glad to see the character do the right thing in the end.  Good story but one that made you wonder;  could this actually happen!?,1385164800,,172,4.7

5420251,2,B00AF6B22E,Such good actors but we did not finish due to the nudity and language that I believe was not necessary and not welcome in my house. I respect my family enough to turn it off.,1385164800,,174,4.0

5420254,4,B00AF6B22E,Plot was intriguing as  hints were given and later materialized as facts in further plot development. Movie challenged viewer to assemble and determine hints relevance in later stages of plot development.,1385078400,,204,5.580645161290323
5420255,4,B00AF6B22E,"Hands down one of the best movies of the year!!!

5420273,4,B00AF6B22E,"Overall a must-see film.  The premise is quite engaging, and the film takes a serious look at alcohol addiction.  It reinforces our awareness that people we know or depend on could be closet alcoholics.  Washington, as usual, is amazing, but the directing could be crisper.  At critical times Flight falls for the temptation to depend on computer-generated action scenes, especially in the critical scene in which Washington's character saves the day by landing the plane.  Although visually spectacular, the scene defies probability to a degree that the film momentarily undermines its overall credibility.

5420309,2,B00AF6B22E,"This movie could have been a modern day Antigone. Instead, it's an asinine heavy moral lecture about the evil of alcoholism.

[spoiler alert]

The premise of the movie is that the pilot is a wretched alcohol and cocaine addict with an uncanny ability to fly a plane. Despite being drunk and stoned, his instinct and heroics helped saved most of the lives on a fateful flight in an impossible situation. In fact, 10 sober pilots tried the simulation of the incident and no one could save the plane from a free dive and killing everyone on board. Although investigation cleared him for being responsible for the incident, ultimately he decided to admit for being drunk thus became automatically guilty for manslaughter. And even though he is in jail, he is a happy man free of his devil.

It's a given that flying a plane while drunk is usually a recipe for disaster, just as breaking the laws are bad and evil most of the time. But even back in the ancient Greek, the question has been raised: there is always exception to the rule, and what do you do about these exceptions? Here is this pilot, flying better than everyone else while drunk. Actual, he could function extreme well in a physical condition that would knock out most people. Is he living a wretched live? Yes. Should the airline continue let him fly? I certainly won't feel secure knowing my pilot is drunk. But is he guilty of killing those who died in that crash? Heck no! This is a logic false equilvance that goes like this -- flying while drunk could cause flight accidents; There was this flight accident involving a drunk pilot. Therefore, the drunk pilot is guilty of manslaughter despite that all the evidences prove otherwise. In a rational, sane world, this pilot would lose his license but should have never gone to jail. But as a popular country song goes ""...people are crazy"". And they have been for millenniums. This movie could have explored into the hows and whys on such absurd punishments are dished out. Instead, the movie gives a heavy-handed moralistic lecture -- alcohol addiction is bad, doing drug is bad. Don't do it or you're a criminal. That's why I gave this movie a two stars. 4 stars for Denzel Washington's acting. He is always a wonderful actor. Minus two stars for this inane movie, which comes out a net two stars.
Here is your food for thought of the day. The flight crew knew the pilot's alcohol problem all these time. They can smell the reek of liquor on his body. Yet no one ever bother to report him to the authority. Shouldn't the flight crew, or the airline for that matter, be guilty of negligence? How come no one makes a fuss about that in the movie?",1384819200,,2660,4.584033613445378
5420310,2,B00AF6B22E,"Pretty disappointing from the standpoint of plot and writing.  I like Denzel and the acting was generally good.  The writing moved from one contrived situation to the next.  The dialog did not ring true, and the same applies to the behavior of the characters.  The main character is totally overwhelmed by his addictions.  That much is believable, although presented at the extreme end of the spectrum.  Throughout the film, though, people behave and talk in unrealistic ways.  There is a final hearing scene on the plane crash (the driver of the plot here).  The hearings scene makes no sense at all and is just one example of the writers wanting certain things to happen and forcing the characters into behavior and situations that don't seem natural or believable.  I would take a pass on this, and hope that Denzel will find better vehicles.  He's been on a bad roll lately.",1384819200,,878,4.793333333333333

5420322,3,B00AF6B22E,"Yes, even with three stars, the movie is worth watching for Denzel Washington's and Kelly Reilly's fantastic portrayals.  They are truly compelling characters that you cannot ignore.  But unfortunately, that is where this movie stops being great and becomes merely good.

Flight is a movie that missed a great opportunity to explore a very important concept.  If you remember Vanishing Point with Barry Newman (1971), you remember a movie that dealt with a critical angst of a generation that was coming of age and felt that ""the rules"" (""the man"", ""the system"") should be challenged...that older moralities no longer applied to a generation that was, quite frankly, too good for the system.  That was where I thought this movie was going.  But it got mired in a straight exposition of the ravages of addiction, in depressing detail, with no real message of hope other than you can end up in jail, but with real freedom in your soul.  Spare me.

But it could have been great: there is this Barry Newman-esque character that can fly a plane better stoned and drunk then any other pilot flying sober and straight.  The maneuver Denzel's character makes to avoid a deadly crash cannot be duplicated by 10 other pilots in a simulator...they all crashed.  So this wonderful opportunity arises to deal with the true dilemma of whether ""the rules"" apply to someone who is so talented at what they do, that all the rules do is blunt the excellence with which he does his job.

And all the pieces are there, because as Denzel's counterpart, Kelly Reilly is an addict with no special talent or abilities for whom ""the rules"" are a God send that when she embraces them, her life improves.

Think what Zemeckis could have done with that.  And it wouldn't have to have been resolved in order to be a great movie.  Zemeckis could have left us with the unanswered question that survived in Vanishing Point (and A Thousand Clowns - 1965 - for some of us older movie buffs):  is conformity to a norm always good?

Instead we are treated to a somewhat pedestrian examination of the deconstruction of a personality, not by drugs and alcohol, but rather by the system that attempts to force Denzel's character into Step One (admit you have a problem).  In the climactic NTSB panel interview of Denzel's character, the investigator admits that what he did saved people's lives, that the crash was a mechanical failure rather than pilot error; and in fact, the pilot was talented and heroic.  But yet there is this pedantic, jack booted march to the inevitable point where Denzel's character admits he flew under the influence of drugs and alcohol even though everyone admits this was not the issue at all.  In fact, if you watch carefully, it is only because he would have to falsely accuse his flight attendant lover of drinking on the job (she died in the crash, so this is truly an altruistic thing he is doing) that Denzel's character admits to drinking and taking drugs.  Did he really see himself as an alcoholic?  Or did he say that because he was so beaten down by the system that it was the only way to actually get the system off his back?

And is this really the point of the whole movie?",1384819200,,3178,4.667863554757631

5420343,5,B00AF6B22E,Excellent Movie--Denzel Washington gives his usual stellar performance and John Goodman is a delight. Remember that it is rated R and the subject matter rather harsh and sordid at times but overall an excellent movie.,1384819200,,217,5.228571428571429
5420344,5,B00AF6B22E,An excellent movie starring Denzel Washington. I'll watch it more than once.  Highly recommend buying this movie. You will want it in your library.,1384819200,,147,5.125
5420345,5,B00AF6B22E,"As an aerobatic pilot and psychiatrist, I was very impressed by how well both the flying, and the depression, possible PTSD and above all, substance abuse, are handled.  Being a huge fan of Denzel, I was a bit sad to see him once again play the fallen hero, and I wonder about his repeated interest in playing heroic figures who have had to grapple with alcoholism.  I hope it's not a personal problem for him, but he does undergo the transformation from fit, larger than life men of thought and action, as he also did so well in ""Courage Under Fire"", into slack jawed, sagging, slouching, defeated shells of their former selves, their power sapped by their addiction.  This is a bittersweet movie at best, but it faces the problem head on, with gritty realism.  No easy landings here, but as pilots say, ""any landing you can walk away from is a good one...""",1384819200,,858,4.5519480519480515

5420349,5,B00AF6B22E,"Very few films can touch the soul of the viewer. The acting, dialogue, and content of this film is superb to say the least. I was pleased that the film had adult subject matter, nudity, and adult content because the real subject's discussed were not necessarily meant for someone who is shy to such things. The story is about adversity, honor, truth, and above all the ability self criticize. It's a tale of leaving behind all the things that hold you back from truly living. Denzel Washington's' portrayal is nothing short of fantastic. His clear cut ability to show the true heart of addiction and the pain that comes along with it should speak to anyone who has dealt with struggle or loss. Writing, acting, action sequences all 5 stars. Worth the watch.... You can bet money on it ... or just pay for it!

They are real men and women who face their flaws and the obstacles that life throws at them, no matter how painful, truthfully and honestly. Denzel is a deeply flawed pilot in this movie, who manages to save hundred of lives, but struggles with addiction and does everything he can to avoid admitting this. It isn't until he faces up to this and takes personal responsibility for his flaws that we see the real hero in him emerge. A very powerful drama.",1384646400,,577,4.5576923076923075

Mr. Washington's character in this movie was multi-dimensional, conflicted, deep and well-represented.  The story did not have a magic escape that left everyone feeling happy.  The movie did not jerk around from scene to scene like a meth-addict, but stayed with the characters and followed the story below its surface.  Well done.",1384646400,,571,4.978947368421053

5420382,4,B00AF6B22E,"I believe Denzel Washington's acting performances are always phenomenal. Crimson Tide and The Book of Eli are my favorites. The only aspect I question in pertinence of this movie, Flight, was when the co-pilot's wife sternly exclaiming ""Praise Jesus!"" in some sort of an odd occult-like fashion. Otherwise all actors did well in this realistic movie of co-dependency & addiction. Mind you, the airline stewardess has an amazing physique, and braved to prove this fact.

5420387,5,B00AF6B22E,"I started watching this movie with no information as to what the plot was about. I just knew it had to do with a plane crash, and I was thinking it was an action movie or something like that. To my surprise, this is not at all what this is about. The accident is the catalyst for a wonderful story to come.

This is about a man's battle with his addiction, and how this affected his life. The way in which the situation is presented is clever and thought-provoking. The reason I am saying that is because Whip, a pilot that is an alcoholic and drug user, is in charge of a flight when things go wrong with the plane. Even though Whip was inebriated, he performed a series of miraculous maneuvers and landed the plane saving most of the passengers. Almost no one could have prevented everyone from dying, but now comes the question, even if the fault was mechanical, is the fact that Whip was fulfilling his duties in that state criminal behavior?

The moments after the crash get a little slow, but the intensity of the movie soon picks up. Denzel Washington delivers an amazing performance, and we completely believe he is drunk / high when we see him on screen. The many relationships Denzel's has in the plot provide this story with multiple layer of complexity and we end up feeling like we watched a masterpiece.

This is not a movie to watch if you are looking for some light entertainment, or for a relaxing-have-a-good-time type of film. But if you are looking for a compelling story, that will make you think and that provide drama at the highest level, this is it.",1384560000,,1574,4.477351916376307

The day I saw this movie was available I watched it and wow, completely blown away does not even scratch the surface of my reaction to this film. I've seen several amazing Denzel movies and for me, this is the finest performance he has ever put forth. While his character carries an air of confidence (and to a certain degree can even come off as cockiness) he is an incredibly vulnerable man who is extremely flawed and quite broken. His portrayal of this broken man was both heart wrenching and gorgeous to watch. Any decent actor can play a drunk and make it convincing but Denzel's performance, he takes us inside of his tortured and troubled soul and really lets you look into the darkest all places.",1384473600,,852,4.364779874213837

5420404,5,B00AF6B22E,"I enjoyed the movie immensely and watched it 2 times.  I was very pleased how it dealt with addictions and the fact that we can find ourselves in a situation where the elements are out of our control, however, they become expanded based on the choices that we make.  Denzel is an excellent actor and his acting ability showed well in this movie.

I loved the dynamics that existed between him and ALL the other cast members, family, friends and his new girlfriend.  I also liked the fact that he realized that life was not life in the state that he was in and at some point, he could no longer be ""enabled"" and as a result lost the favor of ALL THOSE who truly knew him based on his addictions.

I like the fact that it showed he tried to change, but could not until an external situation brought him to the point of change and that he could NOT LIE ANYMORE.

Great FILM and GREAT ACTING.  This is a film that makes you think of it long after the credits stop rolling.

The use of The Rolling Stones  song ""Sympathy for the Devil "" was perfect. and I hope it will remain to be Goodmans theme song. I was wondering if  Goodman had to return Charlie Sheens shirt and sunglasses after the wrap party. The ending is gripping and sensational.

Ok, trying to view it from someone else's eyes. . . it was a gripping movie, very well made, and Denzel's acting was superb. Maybe a little too good. lol... which is why it just hit too close to home and brought back so many HORRIBLE memories of living with my EX husband who is a meth addict, as I tried to ""save"" him, but when I died in '05 b/c of him, I gave up, divorced, been single ever since and so free from that evil world. I have never been addicted to anything in my life, except maybe music, and never did drugs, so I had no idea what living with someone like that was like.

5420495,4,B00AF6B22E,"Ever since the movie Flight came out, people have been raving about it, but I didn't understand why until I actually sat down to watch it. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors, so I was going to see it either way, but I wasn't expecting it to be what it was. The previews and commercial all focused on the crash and the hero who made an impossible move to land the plane safely, but in reality that's just a small part of the movie. The true focus of the movie is on the troubled life of pilot, Whip Whitaker (Washington), whose demons seem to find him wherever he goes. When he's in the air, Whip is at peace and away from a life of hardship and disappointments, but after the crash, he's unable to fly and has to face that life head on. The film itself was actually a bit slow after the thrilling introduction and the excitement on board the plane. At parts during this film, I was bored, but it's necessary to bring the story together into an unexpected conclusion. Sometimes, a film is slow and it's just not worth it to sit there, but Flight is different. The film may lack something in the middle, but it is well worth you're time. The story is out of this world and Denzel Washington shows that he hasn't lost a thing. This man brings such a strong presents to everything that he does, that often times I find myself overlooking the entire rest of the cast. There are a lot of big names in this film, that all become forgettable after the performance Washington gives. Even though this film came out at the wrong time, if he doesn't receive the Academies attention for this role, then there is a gaping flaw in their system. The story is fantastic, Denzel Washington is nothing short of amazing, and this story will stick with you long after the film is over, I can not recommend it enough!",1384214400,,1807,4.364985163204747

The reality  of a pilot's life, the pressures that come with it, and the role an alcohol, and drug addiction can play on one's life, and career choices. Teaches us humility, in the sense the consequences should not effect our choice to be honest and forth coming in any situation. Shows us we should accept the facts, and avoid pointing fingers at others, to save our own hide. The truth shall set you free, Denzel's Final and most important message in this film.... A man choosing to be free behind bars, rather being imprisoned by his guilt in the world. Awesome Film, do watch!",1384128000,,669,4.395161290322581

5420512,5,B00AF6B22E,"I thought this was a film drama about a plane crash but really its a drama about an alcoholic who was in a plane crash. Its not surprising that many people do not like seeing Denzel in a role where the character is completely flawed, we like to see Denzel as the nice guy, good guy hero. I think Denzel should be very proud of this performance as it is a difficult role. The flight crash in this film is thrilling but it only takes up a small portion of the film, the rest is a character study of a man who had achieved greatness but sacrifices it all. Its a morality play where someone has the choice of lying and ridding themselves of a steep penalty or telling the truth where the only reward is a clean conscience and a sense of personal integrity. The choice may seem obvious but its not. After watching the film there was a part of me that felt he should have just lied, just one more time, that the stakes were too high and he would sacrifice too much but those stakes are ones that would have saved this characters life.  This is a grown up film so if you simply want to be entertained without having to think too deeply about the moral issues involved then this probably isn't for  you.",1384128000,,1195,4.213973799126638

I guess he did that in Training Day too (I'm counting the character in Man on Fire as a good guy with a few flaws). The fact is I enjoy almost every movie he has ever made. And this one was no exception!!

Let's not listen to airplane engineers or their enthusiasts diss about how structurally implausible it is to fly a plane upside down. Really, the plane wouldn't even last the few, 5 minutes it had to go thro landing upside down?

5420523,1,B00AF6B22E,"I hated this movie so much, my husbands detailed reviews sum up my opinion precisely. Reviews will tell you ""Flight"" starring Denzel Washington, is a ""riveting and powerful thriller."" It is not. There is about five minutes of interesting Airmanship in the first fifteen minutes of the movie. After that it is a boring crapfest about alcoholism. It's two hours and eighteen minutes of nothing. Garbage. Don't even watch it if its free. It won't be worth the time of you burned to watch it. You can better spend that two-plus hours of your life watching a cat sleep, or some paint dry, or a corner do nothing. Light yourself on fire maybe. Any of these choices would be better use of your time than watching this movie. The cat sleeping is probably the best one. I would sue someone but I didn't pay to see this cinematic refuse, except with my life, two hours of it. I don't think I can get that back, even if I won the lawsuit. That would be great if I could get it back. Maybe I'd watch ""Last of the Mohicans"" again. The excellence of that movie could erase the memory of the horribly depressing and suicide-inducingly boring travesty that was ""Flight"". Look, I've only seen one movie that sucked more than this. It was ""There Will Be Blood"" which starred Daniel Day-Lewis who was, ironically, also the lead in ""Last of the Mohicans."" ""There Will Be Blood"" was so terrible I had nightmares. Not about any of the things that happened in it, just that I was still watching the movie. I hope when I go to sleep tonight I don't see Denzel  Washington. I'll be pissed and there will be nothing I can do about it because I chose to hit PLAY. I could have hit myself in the face with a hammer for two hours but no, I watched ""Flight."" I could go on for a while but I need to go to bed and try to sleep. I bet I won't because I'll still be thinking about this terrible, awful movie but whatever. Good night.

5420525,2,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel did a great job, and the initial flight and crash sequence should have been in 3-D. Unfortunately the script is padded with the timeworn ex-wife, addiction, and inner struggle cliches that Hollywood often uses. The movie could have been a lot shorter, and if it had focused on the real problems of air travel a bit more (that the airlines shred maintenance and overfly their pilots while underpaying their crews), it would have been a winner.",1384041600,,449,4.8441558441558445

I firmly believe this movie represents all that is wrong with modern drama and Hollywood in general. It is formulaic, and one dimensional, It treats alcoholism and drug abuse like an after school speacial, and in essence that is all it is. To say that 'Denzel Washington's performance is strong, or in any way profound', is a slap in the face to any of your local community theater actors (where ever you live). He is just 'phoning it in'  so to speak. I beg you not to support this film with your $3.99. Lets instead support truly independent films. This movie is poorly executed, in so many ways and gives the audience very little credit. We are smarter than this S@#t! When we buy it they make more of it! Don't buy it so they don't make more of it!

Tough Denzel is whom I would describe as a functional alcoholic in my fantasy/real world, I assume he knows what is legally acceptable versus unacceptable.  The storyline seems to be simple but it keeps providing blind turns throughout the movie.  If someone asks me if he or she should watch this movie, I would say 'yes'.",1383955200,,418,4.621621621621622

I watched through to the end because I kept hoping for some unexpected twist however it never came.  The entire movie was about alcoholism and addiction, nothing else.  A few other reviewers mentioned the sex scene at the beginning of the movie.  I agree that this was unecessary and didn't fit in with the movie at all.  It wasn't necessary to have the flight attendant in full nudity.  The point of that scene just seemed to be to show that particular woman's goods to the world.  She's probably make high dollar porn now.",1383955200,,691,4.464

It's the one dirty lie at the end, the one lie that would be the easiest one to tell...that no one would ever question but that would be the point of no return for him...even WE want him to tell the lie and be ok!!!..that gets him straight.

But if not for his condition, the flight probably would not have ended up so favorable. Just like Denzel's porformance, honorable...Great movie!",1383955200,,444,4.426829268292683
5420536,3,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington plays an alcoholic pilot that is, as another character says, an arrogant scumbag. From the first scene we are dumped into his sleazy, depressing world and we don't really raise our heads until the end. Everyone in this movie is to some extent a scumbag, from the slick lawyer, to the union rep, to the airline president, all of whom conspire to hide the fact that the hero pilot was drunk while piloting the plane. This is a dark, dark film and if you watch it you may never fly again.

Washington pulls out all the stops here, but after the suspenseful plane crash segment, the film turns into every Hollywood movie about alcoholism you've ever seen. The climactic moment is telegraphed way, way in advance, and the flourishes during the hearing at the end, designed to increase the suspense (will he or won't he throw her to the wolves?), become almost comical, especially the actor's trademark overacted stuttering. If you've ever seen a movie before, the ending is never in doubt.

Given he was supposed to be a very competent flier, I suppose that you could roll an airliner inverted provided that the Never exceed velocity was too far over... it was done slowly... and all that accumulated force (from the dive) was expended in a gentle bank.

And it isn't even a climax or anything. Denzel can do better. All that tooth-sucking drove me crazy. Watch it you'll see what I'm talking about.",1383782400,4,514,4.421052631578948

In the first scene, Denzel is naked in bed, covered with a sheet, and the woman who spent the night leaves the room, exposing you to full frontal nudity.  Not too long after, there is a scene with a porn actress leaving the set with rather explicit comments about anal sex.  At that point, I turned off the movie.  Perhaps the movie got better, but I wasn't taking the chance. If you don't want that stuff for your movie night, you can skip this one.

Definitely not a family movie and probably needs a stronger rating than R.",1383782400,4,760,4.438848920863309

The movie's premiss is an obvious drunk and coked-up pilot gets behind the controls of a commercial airliner and no one stops him? (we know the flight attendant saw his condition and chose to do nothing).  Really? I wouldn't get on a bus with a drunk no less an airplane.  The only saving grace is (1) the predictable ending is in fact the ending and (2) I didn't have to pay to see the movie.,1383782400,3,487,4.3076923076923075

5420588,5,B00AF6B22E,"Well I never liked Denzel that much and didn't expect much but like anything about aircraft so thought I'd watch it.
Turns out the movie was a bit long and there was more subject matter than just a plane crash, but those subjects are actually extremely common among pilots, so it made a lot of sense. I've seen most and pieces of his other films he acted in, but this was by far the most serious. There was no shortage of surprises either. Everything was done extremely well.
A bad movie would have been a movie about a plane crash only. They could have drug it out and impressed you with mountains of CGI, but without good actors and actresses it would have been garbage. The movie was about life not just a crash so job well done.
I like action movies but am not about to complain that this was not one.",1383782400,,805,4.26797385620915

5420592,1,B00AF6B22E,This movie started out to be a winner and turned into one long drag of someone trying to hash out their personal demons in a public forum. I expected to see an ad for the 'faith in god through jesus in the light of holiness church' at the end of it. It started out to be a great movie and spiraled into a blubbering condemnation of drugs and alcohol. Let's just bring back prohibition to force us to not indulge. This is a pro drug war propaganda film.,1383696000,,452,4.1477272727272725

The story really isn't about ""Flight""...but more about the fact that ""drugs"" destroy otherwise brilliant minds, bodies and lives.  Frankly, the story was too much reality for this gal.  I would have much preferred a story ABOUT flight and the passion that one has for it....a lighter venue.  I gave it four stars because of the talent that was cast in making the film.  As for the story, 2 stars would be good for me.",1383696000,,495,4.632183908045977

5420604,1,B00AF6B22E,"Sigh. I love Denzel. And I LOVE movies about plane crashes. I have had a fascination with both actually for quite some time, so when I saw the preview for this movie I told my husband we HAD to go ON opening day. If you knew me, you would know how strange that was coming out of my mouth. Normally we never see anything in the theater because its a 40 minute drive and always packed with unruly teenagers and people on their phones.

So this movie comes out and we make a date night of going to see it. Dinner and a movie. I was excited. Great dinner. HORRIBLE MOVIE.

Like anyone who watched the original trailer for this movie, you would ASSUME that this is a movie about a hero pilot who does some risky maneuvering to save a lot of lives. There was a hint of some substance abuse issues there too. OK. No problem. So we have a plane crash movie with some drug undertones. That I can deal with, because it has Denzel staring.

Unfortunately, that is NOT AT ALL what this movie is. This is 98.5% a substance abuse movie and the subject just HAPPENS to be a pilot. Seriously. Of the entire 2 hours and 19 minutes, MAYBE 10 minutes MAX is about the plane at all. This movie is about a DRUG ADDICT. The main character is horrendous. Let me say first that Denzel did a stunning job; but I wanted to beat the crap out of his character. The main character was a complete and total POS. He had ZERO redeeming qualities. And as the movie progressed I hated this guy more and more. Then nearing the end his poor choices really set me off and I really wanted to leave the movie, but my husband asked me to sit back down. So i did. I sat through this crap. I HATE drugs. Having grown up in a house with a drug addicted parent, I also hate drug addicts. I have no sympathy or feelings at all towards them except HATE. This movie was not about a plane crash. It was about a horrible man who happened to fly planes. I hate that we spent $20 watching this movie. I hate that Denzel even was in this movie. This movie should not be called ""Flight"" it should be called ""Druggie Middle Aged Man"" because THAT is what it is about.

Yes, there is nudity and language. Those I could totally care less about, they don't bother me a bit. I am giving this movie 1 star because it is over 2 hours of a drug addict doing what drug addicts do, and who the hell wants to watch that? Just go watch an episode of intervention.",1383609600,7,2398,4.150537634408602

5420611,5,B00AF6B22E,"The movie had me from the beginning, knowing the plane crash was going to come did not prepare me for the actual crash, it did not prepare me for the second less damaging, but needed crash.  I did not know about the alcohol part of it, that was a surprise, but that was the only surprise for me. This movie works on every level and it is an experience that I'm glad I had the opportunity to endure.  It is a stressful, in your face ride through what life can do to you when you let all of your control come from the substances that can make you feel good or feel bad.  It was a hard movie to watch, because it makes you think about what you would do in that situation, but knowing that you would never want to be in that situation.  THE STORY - had me from the beginning and took me on a ride that was never boring and never dragged, because I was in for the duration.  The writing was tight and every minute worked and was needed.  Would love to see what they filmed, but never used.  THE DIRECTION - was top notch and invisible, because the people and the situations and the writing were so real and true to life all you could think about was the characters and what was going to happen next.  No wasted moments veering away from the story being told.  It was in your face as ugly and broken as life can be sometimes.  It's hard to watch, but when a movie is this good you can't turn away till it's over.  THE ACTING - The acting in this movie works.  The only character that seemed tacked on and made me dread his appearances was the John Goodman character, but thankfully his time on the screen was small.  His was the only character that did not ring true to me and seemed out of step with the story, but I guess his character is the kind of person that would be out of step and not ring true, but somehow for me even as I think about it now, his character did not work.  Every other character worked and did well and they are gave award worthy performances.  THE SPECIAL EFFECTS - It's like being in the middle of a miracle and a horror story all at the same time.  I was tense as the crash was so realistic to me I felt I was in a seat and going through it.  I was in awe of what can be done now with movies and with a standard like the one displayed in FLIGHT why would anyone want to make anything that doesn't reach achieve or exceed that level of craftsmanship.  MY FINAL RATING AND RECOMMENDATION - I highly recommend this movie and will own it and will watch it again, but not soon I will have to recover from this flight.",1383436800,,2535,4.086868686868687

5420657,4,B00AF6B22E,"Whip Whitaker ( Denzel Washington) is a high-functioning alcoholic, and  a commercial  pilot, a man who is routinely flies planes drunk . So routinely drunk on a rainy morning he manages the impossible that is to save the life of many people.  Robert Zemeckis has made films in the past which have ordinary folks in extraordinary events and this film is no exception.
Denzel Washington is simply superb as Whip right from the start to the end and delivers one of his more memorable performances in recent years. Robert Zemeckis also makes a return to live action fter years of animation and displays why he is one of the best in the business.
The crash scene is very scary and well directed and makes you wonder about the sobriety about pilots ( not that they all drink before flying). I would not recommend watching this film just before you are going to catch a flight.
The story is not about a functional alcoholic hero but his journey afterwards as federal investigations reveal that Whip was drunk and that caused the crash and Whips  insistence that the plane was faulty. This clash of facts and opinion make the film watchable.
The film is about an addicts insistence that they are not having a problem with drinking. Kelly Reilly as Nicole, a woman on a downward spiral through addiction who meets Whip in the hospital is great and so is John Goodman as Whips drug dealer- I felt that his role should have been more developed. Don Cheadle is good as the lawyer.
Denzel Washington is the heart of the movie from the beginning to the end. Almost 60 he looks great and gives us one of his best performances in recent times. Flight is a great film about the pitfalls of addiction and consequences and the power of honesty. 8/22/2013",1380412800,,1736,4.608414239482201

I am a big Denzel Washington fan, and this may not be my #1 favorite film of his, but he plays a compelling character. The story at its core is a ""Greek Tragedy"" of the anti-hero's hero.

You will be instantly drawn to this movie from the first 30 minutes alone. The first portion has a lot of action, but this is not an action movie. I'm not sure if this is also a book, but it would also make for a compelling read.",1380412800,,562,4.155963302752293

5420660,5,B00AF6B22E,"This film went beyond any concerns I had about it not having a plot worth keeping up with...in fact, it completely destroyed those notions (Thank God!)  Denzel Washington plays a pilot with a serious drug and alcohol problem who nevertheless manages to guide a plane smoothly through some serious turbulance and later crash-lands it when the machine's engines fail, preventing what would have otherwise been a horrif disaster.  However, his heroic efforts are forgotten when a blood test taken while he was unconscious in the hospital after the crash shows that he had been drinking and doing drugs before takeoff.  Now faced with the very real possibility of losing and going to prison, Washington turns to his friend, a union representative played by Bruce Greenwood, and an attorney played by Don Cheadle to get him out of this mess while still keeping in touch with his friend, a drug dealer played by John Goodman (a likable drug dealer...who'd have thought...)  Along the way, Washington's character, who has one marriage already behind him, meets a recovering addict played by Kelly Reilly who has her own demons to deal with.  This film succeeds largely because we can be drawn in by Denzel Washington's performance of a man we can't exactly like but nonetheless want to root for.  All the cast work together nicely even when their characters don't and this film isn't the crash it portrays.  It's definetely worth watching.  Enjoy.",1380240000,2,1440,4.99581589958159

5420666,4,B00AF6B22E,"The acting is solid, and I've never seen Denzel Washington disappoint, but the real strength of this movie is the story, especially its ambiguities: the pilot truly saves the day, yet the event exposes his problem with substance abuse; the plane's mechanical failure is called an 'Act of God' and there are other religious elements, yet the pilot seems doubtful about religion and God; the pilot's union defends the pilot, despite knowing of his substance abuse; the pilot can't bear telling one more lie about his substance abuse and thus goes to jail, yet he could have gone just as clean after telling that one more lie to stay out of jail and be perceived as a hero by most.  The one criticism I'll offer is that the movie opens with explicit female nudity, but this is just an obvious ploy to hook the male audience and the movie doesn't need it.

The substance abuse themes run throughout the story and the director does a good job of making you root for, or hate the characters as needed. The problem is Hollywood gets in the way. You can see the ending coming about 30 minutes before it does and despite Washington's best efforts, the excellent acting is just not enough to save this film. It's almost as if you're watching Shawshank Redemption in reverse, right down to the last scene. The dangerous and self destructive alcoholic theme has been explored in movies like Leaving Los Vegas. This movie incorporates the danger to others into that familiar plot. I almost gave this movie two stars but the strength of Denzel's acting pulled it up to an OK.

5420690,4,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington and Robert Zemeckis team up to make a movie that is way out of the common mold for both. Neither have worked together previously. It's a raw and edgy role for Denzel, but I thought it was a terrific film for all kinds of reasons; and I highly recommend seeing Flight without reviews or spoilers (such as follow this paragraph) for maximum impact. Just the fact that Denzel is in it should be enough.

Washington plays Whip Whitaker, an alcoholic, commercial airline pilot, whose plane crashes for ambiguous reasons. Though he miraculously crash lands the plane in a Georgia field, saving many lives and emerging a hero, his troubles slowly begin to mount. Airline pilots are among the most respected professions in our society, but when Washington as an icon of the public trust comes under suspicion of having piloted a flight under the influence of a drink, his life slowly falls apart.

Any number of A-list actors could have turned down a role such as this, which probes the fundamental weaknesses of a man under the influence of an addiction. But Denzel picks up the mantle of a character full of contradictions, and delivers a fully-fleshed, depressing yet fascinating story of a man in crisis.

There is also a parallel story of a heroin-addicted woman, played by Kelly Reilly, who manages to pull herself out of a death spiral, while also watching Captain Whitaker go down the tubes.

Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood play Whitaker's supporters from the Airline Pilots Union, who will stand by their man to the last straw, but their efforts are sorely tested by Whitaker's alcoholism. But if Cheadle and Greenwood are the angels on Whitaker's right shoulder, Harling Mays as Whitaker's coke dealer (John Goodman) is perched on Whitaker's other shoulder, ready to lead him into a paradise of vice, injecting massive doses of humor into the film's most tense moments.

The film seems a bit long, but as the story drove on to its last third, I was totally absorbed in what was going to happen next. Will Whitaker fly to Jamaica and escape his legal troubles? Will the airline be found negligent because pilots are forced to fly stressful schedules?

Denzel's willingness to take on roles that probe the inner crisis of a middle-aged man demonstrate great flexibility and a prolonged career path for Washington. Whitaker's aircraft and his life may be falling apart, but Flight holds together marvelously.",1378598400,,2426,4.919315403422983

I won't review ""Flight"" as it seems about 2000 people have beat me to it already; I will, however, say that if Denzel Washington doesn't achieve at least an oscar nomination for his performance here, Hollywood sucks more than 99% of all good Americans already believe.  And THAT said - to see John Goodman (the ""ex Mr. Roseann"") playing a dealer - maybe John & Denzel will have to share the oscar.  And being a Stones fan from way back, I dig the way ""Flight"" plays ""Sympathy For The Devil"" before most of Goodman's entrances - infinitely better and much more appropriate and believable than that embarrassing sixties band ""Steppenwolf,"" and their three chord wonder, ""G**da** the pusherman."" M Scorcese likes to babble about how much (and to my mind, how poorly) he has used my favorite song-of-all-time, ""Gimme Shelter"" - but ""Flight"" makes MUCH better use of it in the scene where Goodman takes Washington home after he's released from the hospital.",1378166400,,1167,4.767326732673268

5420714,4,B00AF6B22E,"From the opening scene of Washington waking up in bed with a stewardess, drinking leftover booze and snorting a line of coke - before heading to the airport to fly a plane... we know we are in for a role from him than we have seen for a while.  This is a man whose life is figuratively, and pretty soon literally, in freefall.  The opening act of the movie is a plane crash that is both visceral and believable.. a reminder of Zemeckis the director who knows the value of special effects and how they help you tell a story.  The rest of the movie reveals a different director altogether, the director of Castaway, Forrest Gump and Contact, who understands how to reveal character and make people 3 dimensional.  After that crash, the movie's drama is all based on the character.  He is told he has to stay clean and off the booze, and his battle with that is what drives the movie forward, as the movie explores the period up to the Federal investigation hearing.  As the debris from the plane is pulled to together to investigate the crash, the movie starts to explore the wreckage that is Denzel's life.  The middle stretch of the movie is a bit baggy for sure, but it's hard to say what should have been cut, because every minute of Washington on screen is electric.  If it hadn't been for Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln, I'm sure the Oscar would have been his.  A memorable scene involves him and a hotel mini-bar, in a will he-won't he moment that is wonderfully cut together and shows the director and actor in top form.  His personal flight from facing his addiction is gripping in its own way, but it's worth also mentioning a supporting cast that rise to the occasion - from Kelly Reilly as the woman he meets in hospital who tries to sober him up, to Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood his support system for the legal battle, to John Goodman his supplier of medicinal pick-me-ups and source of most of the movies few laughs, there isn't a wrong step.
There are plenty of ideas explored here, about relationships, faith as well as addiction, which stretch the running time a bit.  So yes, it's a little sluggish to be a masterpiece.  But the performances here make this a must see nonetheless, and if you have had experience with alcoholics then the lies and behaviors here will ring scarily true.  A slightly long, but satisfyingly nuanced success.",1377993600,,2353,4.54739336492891

The opening scene grabs you and carries you until the end.  6 stars for Denzel.  I also loved John Goodman who nailed his role as the ""pharmaceutical friend"".  He must have laughed at how much meat there was in this role which is relatively short in the film.  Well done John.
The strength in casting also was something that held the film together seamlessly.  There is not a weak character in the cast and you feel for them and sometimes feel nothing for them.  I'd see this one again which is very rare for me.

This is worth seeinbg just for the joy of seeing a great actor at work.  It is an excellent movie even fpr frequent fliers who might not enjoy the very realistic plane crash.  It is about how a man crashes and finds his way to redemption.  You will not see a better performance by any actor in any movie this year.",1376956800,,637,4.504347826086956

5420737,3,B00AF6B22E,"A Denzel Washington movie is always a pleasure to watch: Until I sat through to the end of ""Flight"".

Here, the director, Robert Zemeckis puts together a great cast, and anti-hero in Denzel's character. You love him but want to close your ears and eyes at his shenanigans and seedy character.

In what should be the climax, despite his inebriated state, Denzel manages to save all the passengers and most of the crew on his disabled jetliner.

The legal maneuvers that follow make it clear that Denzel, the airline pilot, is a pathological liar supporting his secret habit of sex, drugs, divorced wife and son, and more sex and drugs.

Yet, when he is called upon to denigrate the character of the deceased stewardess, he does the honorable thing and ""falls on his sword"".

We are supposed to buy this ridiculous turn of truth-telling as his redemption from his drug habit, and lying ways. Of course, in the process he loses his job goes to prison and thereby ends the free lunch that his salary provided to his ex-spouse and child.

Pity. The end is so utterly an illogical discontinuity of Denzel's character. It is a great piece of acting nevertheless by all involved.

Wish you had stayed around to see it through Zemeckis. You ruined a perfectly good film for me.",1376870400,,1268,4.684684684684685

One of my major issues is  Don Cheadle,  he is more Actor than the roles he gets.  I have no doubt he is a much better actor than the jerkwad Jamie Foxx, yet he keeps getting second Banana roles.  Denzel Washinton did a great job - as always.
Having been associated with the Aviation World for 50 years or more.  I was offended how they portrayed the problem solving / punishment process.  Yeah, there are those both Professionally and Pleasure Pilots that think they are Sky Gods and can get away with Drinking and Drugs.  A good number of them are either presntly Wal-Mart Greeters or embedded in a smoking crater.

I liked the actors from other movies so this also is a plus if you are into recovery and new this may not be for you as there is lots of drinking drug use throughout the movie . If you have sober time under your belt and need a reminder of the lies, deceit we were all about in active use until the crash.  In the end the mind of a good person takes back over and realizes enough is enough.

For the lay person not fighting any addictions I am not sure you will understand a movie and the demons that are with this disease and follow us threw every waking moment and often into our dreams forcing use to wake up satisfy those demons to return to sleep .
I am glad I bought this movie (prime customer)  and have looked at it many times since ,every time I seel a item things start going great ,and the drinking thought pops in .I simply put this on within 20minutes I know I am glad to be sober today ,this movie reminds me and will you where you do not want to be if you take that drink,or drug again.

It's the slyly deceptive marketing that made my rating three stars instead of the four stars I otherwise would've awarded the film. I also didn't care for the gratuitious sex scene that contributed nothing to the story.

His depiction of an extremely skilled but troubled airline pilot deserves an Academy Award.  He reminds me of Dustin Hoffman, in the original Midnight Cowboy, or Gena Rowlands, in ""A Woman Under the Influence"".  He has the extraordinary ability to make the character entire believable, and demonstrate, as if he is the actual person, the downward spiral that this skilled pilot experienced.  The final scenes, involve his reconciliation and ""with god's help"", the revelation to himself and to others, that he was an alcoholic.

Trust me, I flew as an airline pilot for 29 years, and one of the airplanes that I flew as a first officer and captain was this model airplane (MD80) used in the movie.

A brilliant part by Washington, whilst the premise of flying an MD-83 upside down (I am a pilot) is a wee bit far fetched, I found the way they did everything else about the accident, very believable.

When they combine ""crackle talk"" with ""low talking"" it is impossible to follow ... I might as well be watching a foreign film with subtitling.  In real life I ask for a repeat.  In a movie or TV show I'm likely to loose the flow of things.  I understand that a drunk might not be understood in real life.  But in a movie, play or TV show understanding the spoken word is required.  So speaking in a manor in which your audience can know what you are saying is part of being a good actor (IMHO).  Dean Martin and Foster Brooks and other great portrayers of drunkenness would not have been funny if their audiences could not have understood the dialogue.",1375315200,,793,4.35374149659864

It gave you a brief glimpse into the life of an alcoholic, and many of the issues that are associated with this very real DISEASE.  This statement is kind of a ""Spoiler Alert"", but what was the most striking scene in the movie (for me)was the one where the character is looking at the nips in the fridge. He's made up his mind not to drink anymore. He's serious! He's not playing this time... everything is riding on this pivotal moment... and then the demon takes over... He's helpless to resist it, and so... he gives himself over to it... and the fall of it was great. Addiction is exactly like that. People often wonder, ""...why don't they just quit?!"" But what they don't understand is, it is not as easy as that. There is something that goes on in the chemistry of the brain, that the addict is helpless against, without the necessary resources and unwavering support.

The film is  really one of the best that I've seen in a long time. As thrilling (or absurd?) as the plane crash can be, do not expect to see a Disaster film, though. It is the refusal to accept his alcohol dependence and the subsequent moral dilemma consuming the main character that leads the plot, making you wonder what is he going to do about. You cannot help taking his side no matter how wrong the idea of an aircraft with 102 people under the command of a person who has consciously consumed drugs and alcohol can appear. To be an extraordinary pilot, skilled enough to save so many lives, should be what counts in the end, drunk or not drunk. And yet, what is intrinsically wrong tortures our hero, as it should.

Can't you appreciate the realism even if it's not the way you like to conduct your own life?  Movies are supposed to transport you to a different world.

Also, I can't believe all the people who said ""I watched 5 minutes and shut it off because it was porn.""  Porn???  Really?

There is a pee-your-pants airplane crash to start the story off but what this movie is about - truly about - is substance abuse and it's effect on the abuser and those around him/her. And it is one of the better movies I've seen on that subject.

Pilot Whip Whitaker miraculously lands his damaged plane, while heavily under the influence of more than one addictive substance. Does it matter that no one believes that ANY other pilot could have landed this plane, sober or not?

Washington plays a gut wrenching role of a man struggling with his demons. Masterful.

There were some excellent co-stars in the movie, too. Kelly Reilly, Don Cheadle, John Goodman were just some of a superb cast. Reilly especially in her role as Nicole, who has her own demons to fight, was splendid.

5420853,4,B00AF6B22E,"This is a great movie. Once again, in ""Flight"", Denzel Washington proves his ability to carry an entire movie by himself. For whatever reason, the director and producer felt the need to introduce a ""complication"" to the plot and in the process add the extra minutes that make this legitimate 2-hour movie into a 2.5+ hour movie. I really don't see what purpose whats her name (that's how memorable she is in this movie) serves in this movie other than to add time and make the movie longer than it needs to be. She gets clean, he doesn't. Big deal. The tie-ins and coincidences (his plane flies over her apartment building upside down while they're hauling her out after she ODs and they end up in the hospital stairwell smoking together and fall in love - yeah right) that bring the two of them together are laughable and there's just no need for a female main character in the movie. Especially as she actually plays such a small part in it. This is a story about one man and his demons and his strengths and his weaknesses and she doesn't fit into the story. Otherwise, this movie is great. Once again, Denzel Washington excels at playing a mix of good guy/bad guy and as he ages he's not afraid to show that he's aging. Which could be the biggest difference between male actors and female actors and why male actors continue to get good parts as they age. They ACCEPT THAT THEY'RE AGING AND USE IT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE. Female actors try to stay young. Men embrace their age.",1373500800,,1477,4.4944237918215615

The first 5 minutes features full nudity so be forewarned. The crash scene, while somewhat preposterous, is very, very riveting! The first 30 minutes ranks right up there with Saving Private Ryan. It is a great movie with a very important message but, perhaps, not for everyone. Just one note - notice especially the conversation in the stairwell at the hospital.

The best part of the movie was the beginning air flight and the big crash. The remainder of the movie was one long sickening dive into the bowels of human depravity and the pointless pounding portrayal of a man out of control.

Starting with an open mind from the very beginning, not knowing what to expect, I got to see a truly amazing story unfold with parallels of my own life experiences, which made this even more reallistic.
As far as the technical details and nuance of an actual airline pilot, I found to be inconsequential to the true story line.

5420877,5,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington crafts a powerful performance as Whip Whittaker, a pilot who has put his life on autopilot as substance abuse derails his personal life. The controls of a jumbo jet are well within Whip's superb control, despite a serious alcohol and cocaine addiction. A functioning alcoholic, Whip's personal life and career success are disjointed pieces of a puzzle that begin to form a picture of a flawed, sometimes unlikeable, often endearing, heroic, and complex man. On the fateful morning that begins the film, Whip is hungover after drinking the night away with a stewardess. In the early morning light of a hotel room, Whip faces a telephone argument over child support with his ex-wife and has a line of coke to start the day off right in preparation for work. In the cockpit later that day, it's clear that Whip is a natural- while his type A copilot freezes up during in-flight turbulence, Whip takes command of the situation, and all appears right. Steadying his nerves afterwards with a couple of small vodkas from which Whip concocts his own in-flight screwdriver, the jet hurtles forward until more turbulence is hit. What enfolds during and after the fateful flight comprise the movie's plotline. But the real plotline is a man struggling to find his integrity and sobriety, and what the definition of truth is that he can face up and live with. A spectacular cast, soundtrack, script, and film, ""Flight"" is not  for the faint-hearted or those who want escapist entertainment.

5420892,5,B00AF6B22E,"In ""Flight"" when John Goodman's drug dealer enters the picture he's accompanied on the soundtrack with the Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil"".  This theme could very well be the theme for airline pilot Whip Whitaker(Denzel Washington).  There isn't a controlled substance Whitaker doesn't like.  He's even prone to sniffing oxygen before takeoff.  On a routine flight form Orlando and Atlanta a midair accident occurs.  More than likely it's due to mechanical failure.  Regardless, despite his inebriated state Whitaker lands the plane with only four casualties among the hundred people aboard.  Despite his heroics questions will inevitably be asked.  That's okay because Whitaker has any number of enablers.  Toxicology reports?  Quash them.  While you're at it attribute the two empty liquor bottles to the dead flight attendant.  Everybody is willing to make Whitaker a hero but can he face himself in the mirror?  From beginning to end ""Flight"" is a fascinating character study.  Whitaker is probably one of the more interesting characters you'll encounter in any film.  Washington ingeniously enacts his complexities to make him sympathetic to the audience.

5420918,5,B00AF6B22E,"I have been meaning to watch this movie for a long time.  What held me back is that most of the people would describe this film as a story about one man's fight with his addiction(s) to alchohol and drugs.  Once I saw the film, I found that for me personally, this movie is far more than that.  It is a story about a man with intelligence and talent.  As successful as he is in his profession, his personal life is in shambles.  He cares about his personal life, his marriage, his wife and child, but it seems that differences and divisions are so deeply seated between all of them that reconciliation of any kind is impossible.  Any human being can identify with the pain of loosing someone we love dearly and not being able to do anything about making things right again.  Everything seems to get in a way: job, family members, cruelties of everyday life itself.  And when pain becomes unbearable, people turn to ways of making that emotional pain more managable.

This particular story is a a story about a pilot.  In his job, he is responsible for lives and safety of both his passengers and his crew.  He is deeply aware of it and in  his own mind he finds the best way possible to reconcile his personal failures and shortcomings with self medication by combining alchohol and drugs.  As faith will have it one day acident happens.  This accident is not entirely his fault but the main character (played by Denzel Washington) is ""found out"" to be under influence of drugs and alchohol while on duty.  There is too much at stake: financially, legally and ethically.  Can a slick Chicago lawyer (played by Don Cheadle) rescue this pilot and his union and shift the blame on plane manufacturer?  Can this case be won on technicality and what is the price for that?

This is where I found film to get its full value.  At the cruicial moment, when all of this can be put side and pilot can walk away free simply by following technicality of the investigative (not even legal) proceedings, his true self comes out.  Behind all addictions and pain there is a decent human being, honest and kind - willing to take a full responsibility for events that took place on himself even though techncially he is not at fault.  He is willing to sacrifice everything and even go to jail in order to preserve dignity and integrity of another human being he cares about.  In spite of all of his weaknesses this man is a hero - because he follows his own convictions and is own moral code.  By the time story comes to its end we learn to respect him and what he stands for.  This is one of the best movies I have seen recently.",1372032000,,2612,4.439075630252101
5420919,3,B00AF6B22E,"When it comes to acting and affects, as well as story, this is a good one, and keeps your attention throughout the entire movie as you pray this jerk goes to jail and justice is served. The down side is that it brings into sharp focus the downward slide the trajectory of this society's morals and ethics continues to travel at breakneck speed. It shows how the unions will protect and defend even the worst of it's people, and of course most lawyers will say and do anything for money as we all know. The justice system was never intended to let the clearly guilty go free, but was designed to ferret out the guilty and give them a ""FAIR"" punishment, and not the death penalty for jay-walking lets say as an example.

In this society, we've made the guilty all victims of our society, when the real victims are now the good people that do the right things everyday and on the side of right. NO ONE is ever guilty today, and deny, deny, deny is the battle cry for any wrong doing or person in trouble. We are a society of lies and half truths and political correctness that has taken us all down. You won't hear the truth today especially from a politician or the news because the TRUTH will offend someone so the entire country suffers so one may feel good about himself and not deal with reality.

Denzel does such a good job of acting, you hate this man all the way through the film and pray something bad happens to him, or at least I did. The shame of it all is how much of this film is the truth and smacks of a system gone horribly wrong, and how money seems to rule more than ever in a society where our leaders are corrupt.....our government is totally corrupt...... and big business is the worst of them all. We kill people for money and business in this land of the free and call it something nice of course.....freedom fighting....anti-terrorism.....freeing people and on it goes when in fact our companies make billions and we steal the resources of the country we invade that belong to the people.

I ask you this...what have we given our children to look up to? What hero's or examples of goodness that get justice or rewarded at all, have we taught them and left them something to strive for and be like??? I'm afraid the Charlie ""drugged up foolish clown Sheens, and the Courtney ""no class"" Loves far out-weigh the Colen Powell's, and Ralph Naders of our day I'm sorry to say. I can name 100 athletes and stars that would make me sick if they were my kids, and totally ashamed of how I raised them, but in this society........hahahahahahaaha......no one is ashamed anymore no matter what they do or get caught at. In fact, the more of a scum bag they are....the better the public likes them unless it's your neighbor or family that acts like that, and then you want to kill them and have no love at all or patience.
The movie is simply too accurate for me to have liked it anymore than I did, as it left me unsettled and ashamed of who we've become.",1372032000,,2966,4.379310344827586

Alcohol can be legally purchased on almost any street corner, so imagine how hard it is to fight that addiction.  It WILL make you worry the next time you have to fly.  Denzel Washington plays ""Whip"", the pilot, and John Goodman has a standout performance as his supplier!  Kelly Reilly does an amazing job as an addict who manages to get clean and stay clean while having to decide whether to let Whip go to save herself.  I love the surprises in this movie.

5420957,4,B00AF6B22E,"Plot: Substance abusing pilot pulls off truly miraculous airplane recovery with relatively little loss of life. Investigation probes his secret life of addiction while other stakeholders try to keep his name clean, whether he's willing or even capable of going along with their hopes and efforts.

Acting: Doesn't get much better. Everyone is believable.

Photography: Very easy on the eye visuals throughout.

I just had to state that. This IS a very good film for many reasons, but it has one aspect that is hard for me to get over- the premise.

Denzel's character recovers the plane from an inevitable crash, but how he does it makes every recovery effort in the history of mankind seem like child's play. His recovery IS a true miracle, and an outstanding bit of directorial work that makes the film worthwhile on it's own. In addition to pulling off a miracle, the manner in which Denzel's character executes it is legendary. He's in the middle of a true catastrophy overloaded with bewildering amount of information (bad and good info, all that has to be sorted faster than the blink of an eye), yet he eases through it like he was driving a van through a car wash. Again, this character's feat is miraculous. It doesn't go unnoticed, either- people directly next to him during that feat live to tell.

Do they tell a story of heroics? Do they talk about a miracle that boggles imagination? Are they grateful and feel any debt of gratitude?

NOOOO! No one does. In fact, most seem somewhat indignant about it and the investigation brushes all that aside to make the point that the character has a possible drinking problem. Actually, the investigators findings only prove that, at most, he's had two mini-bar sized vodkas before or during the flight.

So, put all this into perspective. A meteor the size of a lake is about to destroy the Earth. A man with a bow and arrow believes if he can be lifted into space with a hot air balloon and aims at the right angle he can deflect it (Others have deflected pebble sized meteors like this before in this scenario so bare with me). Beyond all hope and odds, he pulls it off but five people die from some a spoonful sized bit he couldn't deflect. We found out he had two mini-bar sized bottles of vodka before he went up, and what do the people of Earth do? They crucify him! They want his blood! They want him in jail for life, at the very least!

That's basically what the premise of this movie felt like and it was VERY difficult to sit through.

I mean, it's easy to see Denzel's character has serious substance abuse issues- but that's something WE know about, not the investigators. But we still have to consider their logic- drinking is bad. Even under the guise that it impairs performance, how does that reasoning stand up to a miraculously, flawless, incredible performance?

What if Michaal Phelps drank a bottle of vodka before every meet and STILL managed to win all his gold medals? Would we want blood? Would we vilify him?

5420959,4,B00AF6B22E,"As Denzel Washington matures in age, so do the roles that he plays.  In this film he plays an aging airline pilot who becomes a hero after a turbulent flight turns catastrophic.  Or is he a hero?  There's more to this story than meets the eye. Whip Whittaker(Washington) has a lot going on in his life--he's a divorced dad who is estranged from his family and to make matters worse, he has serious addiction problems.  During his hospitalization after the crash, he meets an addict, played by a very talented Kelly Reilly.  If Whip's life is already a mess, this woman  is a walking disaster. She lives in a weed infested neighborhood in a rundown apartment run by a sleazy landlord.  Her jobs to support her habit consist mostly of being a porn star or masseuse.  She and Whip bond, move in together, but the bottom line is she's ready to quit her habit, but he's not.

Whip is also facing NTSB hearings in regard to the crash, and even though he probably saved a lot of lives was he really fit to be flying that day?  He's lawyered up and the ball's in his court.  Will he tell the truth or will he try to salvage his career?

Denzel Washington did a good job  portraying a man who is on a downward slope from which he can't seem to recover.  It isn't until the end that reality starts to set in and he finally is at the realization that he can't control his life and the people that surround him anymore.",1371427200,,1407,4.320610687022901

5420961,4,B00AF6B22E,"Stories of alcoholics and other addicts have been a fertile ground for melodrama in cinema for a long time. The success of a film that relies on the protagonist's addiction for its conflict rests on two key elements: the characterization of the addict and the believably of the accompanying melodrama. Flight succeeds brilliantly in the characterization of Whip Whitaker's struggle. Denzel Washington gives one of the best and most varied performances of his career, and the writers and director deserve tremendous credit for creating a complicated character that gave Washington so many opportunities to exercise his craft. Unfortunately, the characters surrounding Whitaker are barely drawn. An extremely talented supporting cast struggles to give them life, only Bruce Greenwood, playing Whitaker's old Navy buddy and union representative, manages to present a character with any depth. While this would usually be a large problem, this is Whitaker's story and Washington's presence in nearly every scene keeps the movie compelling. While ultimately falling short of delivering the definitive film on addiction, Washington and the writers may delivered the screen's most fully realized addict.",1371427200,,1196,5.65
5420962,4,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel has nailed this kind of role - where the audience is rooting for a very flawed character. His acting is great.

5420964,5,B00AF6B22E,"FLIGHT.

I witnessed the crash of Aeromexico 498 (DC-9) in Cerritos CA. (8/31/1986, Sunday Noon) after losing the horizontal stabilizer in a collision with a smaller plane at 5000 ft. altitude.  I saw the stabilizer falling like a leaf, and the small plane spiraling down. Flight 498 went straight into the ground in seconds with no time for heroic maneuvers or a dramatic landing on the nearby 91-freeway. No survivors.

I remember hearing about the hard landing of UAL 232  (DC-10) at Sioux City IO. (7/19/1989) after losing all control functions (except engine speed), from which the pilots and many passengers walked away.

So turn off your scepticism and get all excited as you watch senior First Officer Denzel Washington pull off a recovery from a situation ala Cerritos (fortunately with 5 miles more altitude) and make a landing ala Sioux City right there in front of God and everybody. Hot damn!!

Now be prepared for the improbable part: it turns out that Denzel himself has been flying on alcohol/cocaine overload for a long time, somehow managing to escape detection. All of this must come out at the inquiry, because the FAA are not shmos, and Denzel must pull off another recovery for a happy ending. Stick it out `til the last frame because the son asks the question that the movie viewer may be asking also.

Over all, a great movie!",1371340800,,1350,4.793103448275862

Please do yourself a huge favor, if you have not seen the trailer or read spoiler reviews, or if you know someone in this situation, get this movie and just watch it or buy it for that someone.

I knew very little about Flight, saw it in the store, bought the blu-ray and was blown away!!

The quality of the production, cast/acting, script/dialog, plot, cinematography, action, and the raw humanity of the film are all top notch. This film can be ranked up there with the best of the best, with one caveat: The subject matter of the film is raw and intense. In fact, it is the theme that makes it shine as a movie of timeless value.

Robert Zemeckis is the producer/director of this film and you will remember him for movies like Cast Away, Forest Gump, and Back To The Future. However, this movie deals with a far more serious topic which I will not spoil in this review therefore, Flight is quite a bit more intense than his previous works. If you are a very conservative person, there may be aspects of this film that will be uncomfortable for you such as; the script/dialog is quite ""in your face"" as it were. With that said, you may want to read some spoilers so that you know what you are getting into, the material is not family oriented, this is not Forest Gump.

I am convinced that if you have little or no previous knowledge about this production and you just get it and watch it, you too with be floored, as it can be a very profound experience. It is the humanity, the culture, the sociology that gives this work its power.

Much like other movies such as The Game, The Edge, Seven Pounds, The Village, there is meaning to be gleaned from the greatness of the story. Do yourself a favor and purchase it ""sight unseen"" as the old saying goes and I am confident that you will not only be glad you did, you will understand exactly why I suggest this so strongly.

Denzel does what he does, and that is act his butt off. As always, he commands the screen, but is surrounded by a good supporting cast as well.

5421030,5,B00AF6B22E,"This is not a movie about airplanes or pilots. Or not only about these. It's a drama. A very deep drama with regards to alcohol, drugs, freedom and redemption. Fasten your seat belt.",1370131200,,182,4.545454545454546
5421031,1,B00AF6B22E,"A routine commercial flight from Orlando to Atlanta goes dreadfully wrong when a flight-control malfunction occurs.  The aircraft's pilot, a former naval aviator hopped up on booze and drugs, does what should've been impossible - recover an MD-80 series aircraft from an uncontrollable dive and with his first officer manage to land it in a field, near a church, and right across a stream from where baptisms are occurring.  Alas, one of the flight attendants dies, which means the NTSB must investigate, putting the pilot's career in jeopardy and leading to a major crisis in courage.

In real life, an Alaska Airline MD-83 aircraft, a relative of the MD-80, did experience such a failure, putting the aircraft into an extreme dive, in early 2000.  Though the pilots were able to recover from one dive, they couldn't recover from a second, even when they tried to roll the aircraft inverted.  Eighty-three passengers and five crew members died that day.  Which means that when the MD-80 in ""Flight"" tried the same thing, it should've all been over.

""Flight"", then, is a movie built around a premise that it simply cannot sustain.  In fact, everything after the crash is essentially a moot point.  All this despite normally reliable star power than includes John Goodman (who was grating), Don Cheadle (who was wimpy), and Denzel Washington (who did not have Rosario Dawson, Chris Pine, and 2,000 tons of locomotive to bail him out as he did in ""Unstoppable"").

A much better movie in a similar vein is ""The High and The Mighty"", which is considered to be one of the prototypes of the modern disaster movie.  It starred John Wayne and Robert Stack as two pilots who run into trouble with their DC-6 during a routine flight from Honolulu to San Francisco.  That movie blends mechanical trouble and human pathos into a satisfying story.  The folks who made ""Flight"" would have done well to watch it before they started.",1370131200,,1918,4.864615384615385

5421035,2,B00AF6B22E,"I thought this movie was going to be about an airline crash and a pilot who landed it in heroic fashion.  I'm not sure what this movie aimed to accomplish.  It was really about alcoholism.  I think. The pilot was a full blown addict, alcoholic who had alienated his family and everyone else with his drinking and drugging.  The movie was all over the place, with a little bit of this and little bit of that thrown in to really confuse a viewer.  Like me.  Was really confused when Whip, the drunk pilot, went to see his co pilot in the hospital who first seemed angry he ended up severely injured in a crash, which was not caused by the pilot's drinking at all.  But then, the co pilot suddenly spouts cult like religion stuff, that the crash was pre ordained, with his young wife joining in with ""praise Jesus, praise Jesus"".  Ok.  Whip, the drunk pilot, briefly takes in a young female addict, trying to get clean, who quickly leaves when she discovers what a mess he is.  Once she walks out, that storyline is abandoned.  Then there's Whip's drunken drug pushing friend.  When he enters a scene, rock music, The Stones, I think it was, is blared, like this guys really cool and going to take the movie in a hip upbeat direction instead and get the plot and viewer out of the depressing downward spiral the movie has become.

This is a movie without a clear plot line or reason to be.  I rented it thinking it was about an airline crash.  It's not about an jet passenger plane crash, that's for sure.",1370044800,,1502,4.391304347826087

5421039,3,B00AF6B22E,......mmmmm should be XXX rated as the first moments of visual female anatomy leaves nothing to the imagination. These scenes could have been left out as they held little value to the whole plot.  To show the pilot as a womanizer could have been done w/o the nudity. The story line is good & there is a lot of human failings that are shown and can be overcome with honesty & grace.

Denzel never fails to deliver a clearly complicated character. No one walking the earth is any less than a complicated mixture of strengths and frailties, should we ever doubt that, and despite our lowest iniquities, we are capable of redemption.

5421066,3,B00AF6B22E,"In my opinion, the preview made the movie out to be some kind of intense legal thriller. While the story was based around the plane crash and the impending trial, I felt that it primarily focused on the addictive/alcohol driven lifestyle of (Washington). I thought that this made the movie long and drawn out. I was constantly waiting for more 'plot' to develop, but it just kept circling back to the same struggle with alcohol and drugs. Further, I thought many of the scenes were distasteful and crude.
The movie has a nice ending, and sort of leaves you off with a feeling of accomplishment and true progress and rehabilitation.
However, I'll admit that I have no interest in seeing the movie again. And, if I would have known about the overwhelming emphasis put on the alcoholism, I probably would have avoided it altogether.
In general, I like Denzel as an actor. Many of his movies I enjoy watching again and again. This one, will not be on that list.",1369440000,,957,4.635294117647059

As an alcoholic pilot you wouldn't have been flying in the first place because too many people knew of your alcoholism and someone would have blown the whistle to prevent you from piloting a plane.  The only part of this movie good enough to mention was the way Denzel handled the plane when it became disabled - that was a noteworthy and suspensful piece of acting. The plot did not move me, the acting didn't move me, and this Flight should have been cancelled.  The ending of this film was ridiculous - it completely ruined any part of the movie I might have enjoyed (which part was miniscule overall). Obviously, the film movie-makers didn't check out the law regarding culpability of an individual in what they regarded as a criminal act.

5421102,5,B00AF6B22E,"Done well from the video and audio standpoints and very well acted! This movie was very real and an honest 'look' at alcohol and drug use.

As an aside; Drugs and alcohol have an effect on all humans, some good and some bad, but have an effect they do! Some ""addicts"" simply obtain their jobs through skills learned at a young age (prior to drug and alcohol use) which may eliminate many adult people. That job, coupled with an income and a bit of freedom, might then lead them to alcohol or drug abuse. I saw this first-hand as an Air Traffic Controller and those persons were eliminated as well.",1368921600,,597,4.427272727272728

5421104,1,B00AF6B22E,Apart from the actual plane crash - this was a very formulaic B movie. The inclusion of the female drug addict was totally irrelevant to the story line and if - thanks to Don Cheadle - Denzel Washington's blood alcohol level was inadmissible due to poor QC on the instrumentation - how come the flight attendant's was? Utter rubbish - and about 40 mins too long,1368835200,,361,4.484848484848484

5421111,2,B00AF6B22E,"I just finished watching Flight and I must say it was a surprising presentation.
For the most part, I am a fan of Denzel Washington and truly enjoy the majority of his movies. In this one, one positive note was that the acting by all was good. However, after the much publicized showing, of the air craft, malfunctioning and his  flying the jet upside down and bringing the plane in for a landing on an open field,is where the film begins to crash and really slows down for me. The theme of drugs and alcohol in pilots are  serious issues but,as far as I could see, there were scenes that were repetitive and even one of nudity that added nothing to the overall story. You know how movies are rated 1,2,3,4,or 5 stars,this one for me was rated in yawns and I give it 4 yawns.",1368748800,,775,4.301369863013699

Overall a riveting exploration into the life of a deeply flawed human being who gets caught up in tragic circumstances while doing the one thing he does best, in fact, better than anyone else.

5421141,4,B00AF6B22E,"Here's a breakdown of what I enjoyed and didn't enjoy about Flight:

Pros:
 Denzel's great performance
 John Goodman, as Denzel's drug dealer and old friend, is absolutely hilarious
 The cancer ward patient (who has a smoke with Denzel & Nicole in the hospital stairwell) makes for a very enjoyable scene
 A 60's and 70's laced soundtrack (i.e., The Rolling Stones, Lou Reed, etc.)
 Don Cheadle gives a short-lived, but solid performance as well

Cons:
 Scenes involving Nicole (Kelly Reilly) whose character could have been done without IMO
 Didn't understand the purpose of the scene with Denzel's co-pilot and his ""Jesus freak"" wife set in the hospital

Honestly, I walked out of this movie the first time thinking that it was great and after seeing it a second time I still think it holds a solid 7 or 8 out of 10.  A lot of people seem to dislike the ending.  Personally, I didn't mind it - I thought it fit the story line pretty well.  To all of you who disliked the end, what do you think would have made for a good ending?",1368316800,,1030,4.532608695652174

5421143,3,B00AF6B22E,"We watched this movie as a family. I think it's better to watch this movie with teenagers. The whole story has a very gloomy mood, shows the harsh reality of drug and alcohol addictions, but in the very end, the main character redeems himself a little, showing that people may still be decent and do the right thing in a given situation.",1368230400,,337,4.451612903225806
5421144,5,B00AF6B22E,"I liked the pilot character with all his flaws and weaknesses.
The ending where the pathological liar can't tell one more lie was overwhelmingly stirring.",1368230400,,154,5.2
5421145,3,B00AF6B22E,"I thought it was a good movie, however, somewhat predictable.  I waited a while to see it.  As it turns out, too long, as I saw it after the Oscars.  Unfortunately, the awards show should have come with a ""spoiler alert.""  I think had I not seen the most pivotal part of the movie on the Oscars, I might have given the movie 4 stars (or at least 3.5).  It was entertaining.  Denzel's performance was good, not his best, but Denzel will never give a bad performance.  If you haven't seen it and haven't been ""spoiled,"" I would recommend it.  You will be entertained.",1368230400,,565,4.365384615384615
5421146,5,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel Washington, certainly one of my top ten actors, plays this part spot on.  It is a very difficult story.  You want him to be an unsullied hero, but his behavior, his speeding away from reality and truth, is so much the human tragedy, and certainly a central characteristic of our age.

But do we see how we, as a people, avoid reality and truth?  Virtual reality doesn't just happen in video games, movies, and drugged highs.  Can we handle reality?  Can we handle the truth?  Would we know what it is when it is biting our butts?  Well it is biting us, and we don't seem to know we must turn around and embrace it, for that is where true freedom is found.

The acting is excellent on all parts, but especially Don Cheadle and John Goodman.  Goodman, on target in his part as the drug pushing ""expert"", makes me wonder at his experience.

Folks, if you shy away from this movie, you probably need to see it and consider it.",1368230400,,929,4.343023255813954

5421151,4,B00AF6B22E,"This is a story about addiction and the price it extracts in human suffering and failure.  Washington does an outstanding job in the role of the airline Captain that has allowed drugs and alcohol to impair his professional life and to continue down a path to personal disaster.  He ingests copious quantities of booze until he is virtually lifeless.  He is excessive in every way and he seemingly is on a long road to hell with no ability to stop.  The airline crash is the ultimate failure in a life that has grown from great promise to a massive failure.

You could probably write this story many different ways but the outcome is always the same.  Addiction is slowly ripping away the moral fiber of our country.  ""Flight"" is just another chapter in the decline.",1368144000,,765,4.622222222222222
5421152,3,B00AF6B22E,"The opening scenes were riveting.  However, the following story was unbalanced in the way it treated the saving of so many lives as somewhat trivial when compared with the pilot's too human failings.  Once it became obvious there would be hell to pay for the pilot's alcoholism and addictions, the relentless pressure to confess quickly became a path too clear to be interesting.  The one exception to the inevitable storyline leading to the dramatic revelation at the trial was John Goodman's ""rescue"" scene.  While painful to watch, the skill in acting the part of the drug and alcohol EMT to Washington's ailing tragic role was a joy to see.  In my opinion, the film would have been improved by leaving about twenty minutes of failed attempts by the pilot to avoid embracing his disease (alcoholism) on the cutting room floor.",1368144000,,829,4.892857142857143

Somewhat overly dramatic performances by the actors portraying ""religious zealots"" and a surprisingly lack-luster performance by Cheadle as the Pilot's Union lawyer detract form the authenticity of the events portrayed in the film. Goodman's performance adds a touch of dark humor to the tragic events that unfold. The film, gritty in it's portrayal of human frailty, ultimately celebrates the strength of the human spirit.",1367884800,,764,5.891891891891892

5421184,1,B00AF6B22E,"This film struck me as a hollow (hence my review title) Oscar vehicle meant to appeal to those who have never truly dealt with people in positions in which they may benefit from their complete lack of morals. A lot to digest in one sentence? So is the naivete engaged in by the writers of this loose, wholly unrealistic film. Unfortunately, a good performance by Washington was wasted because some Hollywood writer who was obviously out of ideas, felt the need to make the character an abusive, selfish heel rather than giving his character other conflicts.

SPOILER ALERT: Washington plays a narcotics-addled alcoholic airlines pilot who (after getting completely pissed & coked-up the previous night) manages to crash-land a mechanically-deficient airplane in a heroic act. That is the high point for Washington's character. As the movie progresses, you'll see his character devolve into a verbally abusive, soused, completely unappreciative (of friends and family alike) ___hole who is hailed by the media as a hero until questions arise as to his blood-alcohol level immediately after his rescue. To save time (and I'm not exaggerating) Washington's character spends the next one hour and thirty minutes in a beer and drug-induced stupor which spans literally right up to his tribunal before the FAA.

The kicker? The reason why spineless syndicated reviewers hailed this weakly-conceived film as ""Powerful?"" Just as he is about to go scot-free despite being three-sheets-into-the-wind AND freshly revved on cocaine (AT the hearing, mind you), Washington's character decides to come clean and tell the truth that he was on a coke binge the previous evening before the fateful flight. That's right. His character - after almost 2 hours of repetitive unredeeming character flaws - decides to FINALLY tell the world that he was drunk AND high while piloting the airplane.

Did a child write this movie? This was nothing more than typical Hollywood candy-coating and extremely weak, amateurish writing. Think of the ambitious, upper management types in your life. When faced with the option of: A) getting away with a heinous crime and being hailed as a hero, or B) admitting wrong doing when they don't have to and then going to prison - which do you think an ambitious person would choose. I pointed out ""ambitious"" people because make no mistake, had Washington's character simply lied, he would have been lauded as a hero and easily could have coasted into retirement on a book and movie deal. But, he chose prison instead? Yeah, okay.",1367539200,,2539,5.113253012048193

I now understand how stress from so many difficult factors, can, and perhaps overcome those, that we take for granted.

5421208,4,B00AF6B22E,"""Flight"" is the story of pilot William ""Whip"" Whitaker (Denzel Washington) and his life of excess which becomes exposed following an act of great flying skill and bravery.

At first he is a hero but then he is identified as a drunk becoming the subject of media and legal scrutiny.

In hospital and recovering from injuries he is in the company of people far less fortunate than himself and he becomes more aware of his need for urgent self-change. It is also these very people who help guide him to a better self.

Whilst Whitaker could sidestep responsibility it is the realization he needs to accept accountability with an honest conscious which is perhaps the most significant breakthrough of the film.

As a movie narrative it is a rare case of right becoming a badge of self-worth but also a punishment for poor decisions.

The cast consists of a unique group of personalities from all walks of life and as a unit their performance is quite absorbing.

5421212,4,B00AF6B22E,"I saw many previews for this movie before I actually watched it with my family. Based on the trailers, it seemed to be a movie about aviation. Actually, the core theme is how alcoholism destroys lives, families, relationships, etc. Over the years a great many movies about the nightmares of drugs and alcohol have been produced. This is one of the better ones. Denzel Washington does a great job as an alcoholic pilot whose life is destroyed by the bottle. The supporting cast was impressive as well.

Part of the charm of this movie is the absence of racial and political cant. The principal characters are of several races and sexes. However, they are Americans first and foremost, troubled Americans to be sure, but regular folks nonetheless. Sadly, too many movies turn every character into some sort of racial stereotype. Not this one.

Captain Whitaker's attacks on the Pilots union were a bit off. However, his character is an alcoholic recovering from a devastating crash. The actual union officials in the movie are depicted as serious and supportive individuals (too supportive of Captain Whitaker actually).

The only serious negative is the PC treatment of Christian fundamentalists who are (predictably) portrayed as crazies.

5421219,4,B00AF6B22E,"As many of the excellent reviews before this one have said, this is first and foremost a movie about a functioning alcoholic (Denzel Washington) battling his inner demons and coming to terms with his disease. It is NOT a movie about a plane accident with a heroic pilot, as some of the previews would have you think, although that is part of the plot. I think the trailers for this are a bit misleading, and that might bug some people. Denzel does play a pilot, and the story does begin with an absolutely riveting plane crash after which he is indeed portrayed in the media as a hero. But as the investigation of the crash unfolds, it's clear that the truth is closing in on him, as he continues to drink to excess and to deny it whenever he can. How he eventually faces up to this does make for some dramatic moments, and Denzel is brilliant, as are all the supporting cast. But the movie is too long, with several scenes drawn out too much, and others that could have been cut entirely. I docked a star for that and the misleading trailers; otherwise, I think this would have been a 'best picture' nominee this year.",1367107200,,1119,4.4106280193236715

5421240,4,B00AF6B22E,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Flight, for me, is one of those movies that takes you completely by surprise. The way I understood it from the trailer we had a pilot (Denzel Washington) who does the unthinkable by saving close to 100 people in a plane crash. Then it turns out that doctors found high alcohol levels in his blood after performing a toxicology report while he was unconscious. Now, originally, I thought Flight was going to be a movie about him proving his innocence. Maybe someone set him up or something of that nature, but I was completely wrong.

Flight follows the story of Whip Whitaker (Washington) after the aforementioned plane crash. What the trailer didn't tell you was that Whitaker is a raging alcoholic and, essentially, that's what this entire movie is about. Yes, there is a plane crash and yes he did save those people, but that lays the groundwork for something much more powerful. On the surface you have the plane crash, but when you dig deeper it's a strong story about alcoholism and drug addiction.

While in the hospital recovering from his, surprisingly, mild injuries, Whitaker meets a drug addict by the name of Nicole (Kelly Reilly). These two eventually form a bond when Whip finds her being thrown out of her apartment complex not too long after he was released from the hospital. After we reach this point in the story things start to get really serious as the viewer starts to see just how bad Whip's alcoholism really is.

One of the things I found most enjoyable about Flight was not only the powerful narrative, but the strong character development as well. As you watch Whip constantly get hammered it's hard not to feel something towards his character. Time and time again we see him attempt to quit and every time I found myself rooting for him, but he just doesn't have the willpower to put down the bottle of whatever his drink of choice is that night. It's almost heartbreaking because you can tell that he wants to stop, but he can't.

Then there's Nicole. Towards the beginning of the movie I had a hard time understanding what her role was in the big picture because they give you little to no explanation about why she's there, but eventually her role becomes more apparent and, just like Whip, you feel for her. The only difference is that she truly wants to get clean. So she gets herself a job and starts going to AA meetings. Now I don't know how difficult it is to play a recovering addict, but Reilly did a fantastic job at portraying the constant struggle that these individuals have to go through to avoid a relapse.

Along with the main gunners you have the supporting cast which consists of Don Cheadle, Bruce Greenwood, and John Goodman. Cheadle plays Whip's lawyer Hugh Lang. I don't know if it's just me, but it feels like everything I see Cheadle in he's basically playing the same character with a different occupation. He's not a bad actor by any means, it just feels like he gives off the same persona in every role and that stops the viewer from creating any sort of emotional attachment with the character. With that said, he did a solid job as Hugh and I couldn't help but chuckle at a few of his facial expressions towards the end of the film. Bruce Greenwood plays Whip's old friend Charlie Anderson (talk about a plain name) who works for the airline's pilots union. He doesn't get a lot of screen time, but he gave a solid performance in the scenes he was in. Then you have Goodman who plays the hilarious drug dealer Harling Mays. What I loved about Goodman's character, other than his fantastic performance, was that it provided just enough comic relief so the movie didn't feel like an emotional burden. This is a serious topic so that little spice of comedy scattered throughout allows you to enjoy the story without leaving depressed.

Overall Score: 8/10 - To say that Flight caught me off guard would be an understatement. I went in expecting one thing and instead was given a very powerful story about drug and alcohol dependency. Denzel comes through with another fantastic performance proving once again that he can bring just about any character to life. Couple that with a solid supporting cast and you have yourself a nice little film. It's hard for me not to recommend Flight because I grew up with family members who dealt with the same issues that are addressed in this film. Still, I understand that it's not for everyone, but if you have the time I definitely recommend you give it a chance.",1366934400,,4512,4.646616541353383

The crash was not very realistic and seemed contrived to boost the action. If the reaction by the rest of the crew and his friends to a serious drug addict and alcoholic is anywhere near realistic then American air safety has a serious problem. The same could be said for the law enforcement and legal team. Captains like Washington need to be rooted out and put in jail fast and it was appalling that it was left to Washington himself to stand up and be counted. The world is not like that and this movie failed badly in my view by using such a bad script. Rent at best but mostly ""don't bother"".",1366070400,,707,4.2835820895522385

5421322,2,B00AF6B22E,"There are some films that are just so overbearing in their `LET ME DRIVE THIS POINT HOME' that they lose all appeal and wind up being an exercise in the obvious.  `Flight' is that kind of film.  It isn't awful, but it becomes rather pointless by film's end because it never manages to become anything more than an elaborate exaggeration.

`Flight' attempts to be a moral tale revolving around an alcoholic pilot named Whip who uses cocaine to sober up after binge drinking before a flight.  When the plane has problems and starts to descend rapidly, Whip winds up landing the plane in a rather remarkable manner and saves the lives of many on board (only losing a few).  He was a hero, until his toxicology report shows that he was drunk and high at the time of the flight.  Over the course of the next two hours, Zemeckis beats us over the head with Whip's addiction to the point where I just wanted him to get hit by a drunk driver and let the irony completely take over.

I'm not trying to belittle addiction, because it is truly something serious, but the manipulative nature of `Flight' is too much.  Washington is in fine form, but this is a breeze for him.  He's played a similar character before and he doesn't really shade Whip with anything other than the obvious.  The introduction of Nicole was unnecessary and yet again completely part of Zemeckis's approach.  There is no subtlety here.  Everything is overdone and oversold to the point where I was exasperated and completely uninterested by the film's end.  In fact, the ending courtroom scene made ZERO sense.

And don't get me started on John Goodman's take on a drug dealer.",1365984000,,1642,4.617241379310345
5421323,3,B00AF6B22E,"SPOILERS...........SPOILERS................SPOILERS.............SPOILERS..........

 Denzel Washington did a great job in portraying a chronic alcoholic, how they can function while drunk, how lying can be come as easy as breathing. He certainly was not always a likable person, and couldn't be trusted in some ways. However, he was a damn good pilot, and he saved nearly all of the persons on the plane, due to his skill. They proved that there was mechanical malfunction of the plane, and it was also a fact that the one flight attendant died because she was not seated and buckled in. Was the child in his own seat and fell out, or was he being held on his mother's lap? At any rate, I thought it was wrong that Whit was sent to prison. It was not his fault that the plane malfunctioned, there was no negligence on his part, and there was nothing that he could have done to change what happened. Instead, as said, he saved 96 lives and avoided the deaths of everyone nearby on the ground. He was a hero. I didn't like the relationship with Nicole and felt it pointless. It added nothing.

I also didn't at all like his exwife or son. While he may not have been the best husband and father, he was supporting his son, as we see in the first minute of the film. He was paying for the son's private school, and also the home they were living in, and yet they treated him like dirt, while they were trying to get money from him. I didn't like the ending scene with the son either who seemed to want to twist the knife, and just demanded that Denzel spill his guts. They didn't seem to have any real relationship. I say again, if you don't want someone in your life, then stop harassing them for money, and pay your own way.

Maybe Whit needed to have a house fall on him, in the form of being sent to prison, to finally get that he needed to change his ways, but I thought that the ending didn't fit the crime, since it was said that he had lost everything, and had no future.  Again, it was not his negligence that caused the plane to crash.",1365984000,,2041,4.388888888888889
5421324,5,B00AF6B22E,"I really enjoyed this movie because it was great life story, and it showed Denzel in a different type of character role. It shows the wide range of his talent and ability to bring different characters too life.",1365897600,,210,4.552631578947368

It is a number of things, besides this beautiful profession, Pilots situation is not well respect by their companies..what brings to sometimes dangerous result.

5421388,2,B00AF6B22E,"I like Denzel Washington and in this story he shows he's a star with the heart of a character actor, but I didn't like the character he played, who became a criminal to me as soon as he took cocaine before heading out to fly a plane full of passengers.  I was not impressed with the character's flying abilities and I blamed him for the plane crash, though the story showed that there were mechanical problems with the plane.  Had he not been high, he may have done his walk around (the plane) properly before the flight and discovered the mechanical problem or he may have turned the plane around when he initially encountered the storm.  I think the storytellers also made a mistake suggesting the co-pilot was green - the audience, most of us having no idea how to fly a plane, had to rely on the co-pilot as he was the only non-impaired pilot in the cockpit and the co-pilot showed very clearly the captain was off the rails (though the audience already knew this as we witness his cocaine use and drinking on the job).  Had the audience been given a medium level experienced co-pilot, perhaps we wouldn't have seen the Denzel Washington character as bizzarly as the co-pilot obviously did.  Anyway, a more experienced co-pilot would have helped serve the audience better, in my opinion, than a greenish one; would have helped us understand more clearly that the captain, even impaired, had a huge flying talent - that would have been a better story strategy; it would have helped us see the captain as something more than just a negligent drunk, though he obviously was both negligent and a drunk.  A more experienced pilot would have helped us see the Denzel Washington character's genius; I think that was what the storytellers were aiming for, but they missed the mark, sticking the audience with a green co-pilot.  Also, there were four people who knew the pilot was not capable of flying the plane; the pilot, the co-pilot, and two of the stewardesses, none of those four people stepped up.  The pilot was deranged from coke and alcohol, but the stewardesses and co-pilot were not impaired and risked their lives and the lives of all the passengers, why?  Didn't like how the Denzel Washington character tampered with witnesses in a federal investigation, and got away with it - also not believable that he would have gotten away with it.  The only thing I liked that the character did was confess he was an alcoholic, and that was nearly at the end of the film, so I spent the entire film with a character I disliked, ugh.  What I did like was the flight crash sequence, seriously scary, had me shaking.  All the actors were good, nice to see John Goodman.  Two and half stars.",1365206400,,2688,4.621848739495798

I didn't know if was going to be a tale of one man's journey from severe addiction of multiple substances. It was pretty depressing and pretty scary if you thought your pilot was actually doing this amount of drugs and drinking.

Denzel was his usual great self, but a lot of the other characters actions were either pretty unbelievable or downright ridiculous. The story would probably have made a better TV mini series, in the time of a standard movie, many of the relationships were rushed to the point of being difficult to believe.

I would not have watched if I had known what it was about, and even as a story of one man's road to redemption it has a lot of issues. Maybe that was my real problem with it, the director and writer tried to tell too many stories in the time allowed.",1364947200,,913,4.396449704142012

5421446,4,B00AF6B22E,"This is the first live-action film Zemeckis has directed since ""Cast Away"" in 2000. Like that film, it has a huge, edge-of-your-seat plane crash scene then becomes a two-hour character study. The trailer makes you think it's either an action-packed rage-against-the-system flick or a courtroom drama. It's neither, although it has elements of those. It's really more like ""Lost Weekend"" or ""Clean and Sober.""

The airplane is a metaphor for its pilot, William ""Whip"" Whitaker (Denzel Washington), a functional alcoholic who is privately crashing during a time when he is publicly flying high as a national hero. Whip coolly and inventively landed the defective airliner, saving most of the 102 souls aboard. But it's discovered that he was legally drunk when the accident occured. Can he come out of his nose-dive before he loses the one soul aboard his personal flight?

Washington's tremendous skill and intense humanity keep you invested in Whip but it's not easy. Whip - as addicts often do - gets increasingly repugnant as the story progresses and the movie dares you to keep caring about him no matter how bad he gets. Kelly Reilly (Dr. Watson's wife in the current Sherlock Holmes movies) also does a terrific, natural job here as a fellow addict/love interest who wants to get sober.

The film poses many questions about God's role in tragedy and accidents, his help in self-control, the efficacy of prayer, and predestination. Christian symbols appear throughout the film. Some of the questions are taken very seriously, some not.

It also keeps you in a very tense, emotional Catch-22 between definitely wanting Whip to be absolved for this particular crash, for which he was not responsible and in which he acted heroically, and definitely wanting to see him be held accountable for his long history of flying drunk.

Some conservative viewers may admire the film's message but may not be able to sit through its very graphic and realistic content.",1364774400,,1959,5.052631578947368

5421453,4,B00AF6B22E,"FLIGHT is a great, dramatic film. I'm not here to tear it apart. And I've studied film and acting for many years and worked in production since 1992. Denzel never disapppoints. And hopefully some of the people who worked on this movie will understand where I am coming from here. Regarding John Goodman's character in this film... It is sad to think that the producers feel Goodman ""brings"" something special to the production here. John Goodman's role is very much like Phillip Seymour Hoffman's annoying character in TWISTER and Goodman's own role in BIG LIEBOWSKI, they seem to think that his vulgar language and attitude puts some special ""character"" icing on the cake here. It was not needed at all. It sucked. He's not a great actor, just a personality. No hard feelings Mr. Goodman. And why do men of director Robert Zemeckis' age, like Scorsese, feel they have to use these classic Rolling Stones songs that we have fresh in our minds from films like GOODFELLAS. Use some other tunes people!!! Introducing John Goodman's character with the Stone's ""Sympathy for the Devil"" song was predictable and not very original at all.

Spoiler Alert. Don't read the next paragraph if you plan to see this movie.
The plot isn't all that complex. An airline pilot named Whit has been up all night and presumably needs to rush to the airport for a short flight between Atlanta and Orlando. To give himself a little pick me up he does a couple lines of coke. looking not exactly bright eyed, Whit is working with a new co-pilot. The rest of the flight crew are the flight attendants he knows, including his current girlfriend who is his partner in sex, drink, and drugs. The takeoff almost immediately turns bad. I wasn't sure if this was his own bad condition or a legitimate problem, but the plane was shaking like crazy which reminded me of a recent flight I took that left me ill and white knuckled. Once things are stabilized, Whit personally comes out to tell the passengers that it was all a freak occurrence and that everything is o.k. However, he is standing by the galley while making all this comforting banter and what the passengers and crew can't see is Whit emptying three bottles of booze into a bottle of o.j. He returns to the cockpit and ends up taking a snooze (or is passed out) when a system malfunction occurs.  Whit wakes up and all hll is breaking loose. The plane loses altitude, is destabilized, and eventually starts nose diving before it does a 180 degree flip that has it flying upside. Whit manages to pull off the impossible and lands the plane in a field, but not before shearing off a church steeple. Loss of life was inevitable, but only four passengers and two flight attendants die. Whit is hailed as a hero to the extent that he us up there with Sully Sullenberg. Everything is sort of blissful. Whit goes to his farm and destroys what can only be likened to a mini liquor store appears to be shaken enough to possibly change his bad habits ...... for awhile. What Whit doesn't seem aware of, but most viewers would is that they have taken bloods samples that reveal a very high alcohol level and the presence of cocaine. With the NTSD investigating, the airline hires hires a lawyer that will kill the blood test results and all Whit has to do is stay clean and evade and lie. Whit denies initially that he is an alcoholic and that he has a drug problem, but he is so far beyond self control that he proceeds to have a running party with his favorite addictions.
I liked this movie but found it depressing and hard to take as the movie progressed. The movie might have been called Addiction instead of Flight. It was brutal, sad, frustrating, and no doubt too realistic. While Whit has something akin to a moment of clarity near the end when it was obvious that the cause of the crash was poor airline maintenance, the ending that was tacked on seemed a little unrealistic based on Whit's abysmal relationship with his son. I didn't things would seemingly heal only fourteen months after the crash and logically trust would have to be earned over a period of time. However, that was probably my only real problem with a movie that was very realistic and very painful for someone touched by alcoholism or drug abuse.",1364688000,,3334,4.465573770491804

After Whip threads the plane through severe turbulence at takeoff, copilot Ken Evans (Brian Geraghty) flies the airplane while Whip discreetly mixes vodka in his orange juice and takes a nap.

I hate the movie ""Training Day,"" the movie for which he won an Oscar. Anyone who is a fan of Denzel will see how well he played this character. It wasn't a movie about a plane crash. It was a movie about a man, with all of his wants, desires, needs, heart, responsibilities, and addictions. The plane crash was the impetus that brought all of these to light - to the world, and most of all, to himself, the man. And Denzel played that man superbly.  In the end he faced up to his flaws and his heart and true character shone through, at great risk to his reputation and freedom. The question asked of him by his son at the very end of the movie sums up it all. Don Cheadle, Bruce Greenwood and Tamara Tunie were perfect for their characters. I can't think of anyone who could have played John Goodman's character better. He was AWESOME!!! I thought all of the casting was very well done.

Every aspect of this movie is first-rate and reveals the insanity of alcoholic behavior exactly as it is.  Those who are not in recovery or who don't know anyone who is will probably neither understand nor appreciate the progressive, self-destructive and ultimately fatal nature of this disease.

5421508,1,B00AF6B22E,"Spoiler Alert: Had potential until it became an afternoon school special. So the moral of the story is that it's okay to crash the plane (as every single other pilot did in simulation) as long as you're not an addict. Got it. He did what no other pilot could do, but let's crucify him since he's an addict. Great lesson to turn out more sheep. HATED IT!  Had the drunk drug addict NOT been piloting that flight that day, everyone on that flight would be dead.  For me, End of Story.

Updated my review for clarification April 2, 2013:  My problem with this movie's message is...  Crucifying someone because they went to work drunk & high, eventhough they do a better job (are a better pilot) EVEN drunk & high than most, if not all others in any condition.

I understand why we have these rules and limits, because MOST people cannot function well on diminished brain function.  However, here is a pilot that not only can, but did so stupendously.  Yet, we hang him out to dry for his drug & alcohol abuse, no matter how amazing of a job he did do while on it.

We have gone so far overboard on watching and enforcing measuring sticks (limits), that we have lost sight of why we put those limits in place in the first place.  He landed the plane like no other pilot was able to in the simulations.  Honestly, that's all I need to know.  I don't care if he was drunk, high, blind or ANYTHING else.

Think of it like this from a documentary I saw on aging:  There is this heart surgeon out there that is amazing in his field.  But he is forced to live a lie and hide something from his patients because of the stigma put on his affliction.  This surgeon's affliction is that he is 95 years old.  On the surface, who would want a 95 year old doing anything so important?  But he is the best at what he does, nothing else should matter.  Right?  Just a thought...

And that also goes along with when we hear about a fatal car accident.  The penalty is greater if the person was DUI and then THAT becomes the focus.  Why?  DUI may be the reason they caused the accident, but the end result is the same - they killed someone.  End of story.  Again, we are paying so much attention to those aids we use to identify possible trouble spots that we can't see the forest for the trees.  If an inexperienced and reckless teenager had the same fatal car accident, but was sober, the end result is the same - at fault manslaughter.  We don't crucify the teenager for being reckless or stupid or inexperienced...and shouldn't.  Crucify him for killing somebody.  Judge the end result.  Rise above your emotions.

Setting ""standards"" is an aid to help us make pre-determinations on what we can reasonably expect from most people / situations.  But those ""standards"" should be merely aids or tools and NOT the final word.",1364256000,2,2804,4.4035087719298245

5421570,3,B00AF6B22E,"I agree with the reviewers who said ""the movie crashed after the plane did"".

The idea of (SPOILER ALERT) a drunk pilot who makes a heroic landing is a fascinating premise.  Hero or villain?  Would the accident have happened if he'd been sober?  For that matter, would he have been able to pull off the death-defying maneuvers that saved most of the passengers if he was straight and terrified like his co-pilot?

Unfortunately, the movie never really explores any of these themes.  Instead we spend 90 minutes watching a drunk and a liar basically circling the drain.

His epiphany, when it comes, is hard to believe.  Crucial evidence about the plane's condition is saved until the end, even though this would have been known by everyone involved much earlier on in the piece.  And the Hollywood Happy Ending is forced so hard it hurts.

Denzel Washington is, as usual, terrific.  And he makes as much out of this role as anyone could.  But at the end of the day not even he can salvage a great idea that was left hanging in the air.",1364083200,,1035,4.565217391304348

5421613,3,B00AF6B22E,I belive Denzel portrayed and did an excelent job showing what a real alchoholic goes through and how one can hide it so well. The same is true of drivers who get behind the wheel and think they are indistructable.,1363737600,,214,4.375

5421623,3,B00AF6B22E,"I think the movie tries to make you have sympathy for the drug-abusing alcoholic pilot, who flew stoned but somehow saved most of the passengers during a malfunction (fault of the airline/manufacturer), by flipping the plane and flying upside down to keep it from diving. Then right-siding it again. Yeah, right. If you have drug abusers or alcoholics in your family, you will not enjoy this.",1363737600,,392,4.954545454545454

5421628,5,B00AF6B22E,"This is a great movie...with a realistic depiction of alcoholism and treatment...Denzel gives an Oscar worthy performance.

5421634,1,B00AF6B22E,what a dreadful movie. What was Denzil Washington thinking about when he agreed to do this lemon. The first half hour about a plane crash is OK then it dissolves into a dreary molodrama ambout the pilot who is an alcoholic and ddrug user. What a dreary film I hate films about people who have no will power....alcoholics and drug users. What a total waste of money.......Denzil Washington has just lost a lot a brownie points.,1363651200,2,426,4.618421052631579
5421635,3,B00AF6B22E,"Robert Zemeckis has returned to live-action drama since ""Cast Away,"" about a man who survives a crash landing on a desert island. Now in ""Flight"" Denzel Washington plays a pilot Captain Whip Whitaker, who pulls off a near-impossible landing, saving the lives of most of the passengers and crew.

Despite the suspenseful crash landing sequence, ""Flight"" is no more an action film than ""Cast Away"" is. Robert Zemeckis's new film focuses on the character Whip Whitaker, who, though hailed as a hero, has a secret that he desperately wants to keep from the people. We learn what the secret is right at the start of the film. In ""Flight"" an airplane accident serves only as a starting point for the story that follows, which is pretty predictable, but manages to keep us interested thanks to the star Denzel Washington's nuanced acting.

The same cannot be said about the supporting characters, however. Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle deliver solid performances as a union representative and a lawyer respectively, but their characters are rather flat. John Goodman's comic relief and the romantic subplot involving a recovering heroin addict (Kelly Reilly) only make the film longer, not better.

But the filmmakers have made one right choice and that is Denzel Washington. He does not disappoint, though I think the film itself does.",1363651200,2,1331,5.068493150684931

5421645,2,B00AF6B22E,"I am a HUGE fan of Denzel Washington. With that said, this movie is NOT what I expected AT ALL! I watched the commercials, trailers, talked to friends about the movie, and ALL signs pointed to a man being surprisingly sued for wrongdoing after saving a flight from catastrophe. The trailers were misleading... Maybe he WAS the ONLY pilot that could've pulled off a landing like that w/ a manfunctioning plane but, he WAS bad! He did terrible things! (which were ALL shown throughout the movie!) YES, in the last few minutes of the movie, he realized that he was a terrible person! But, after watching all of the deprivation and degradation that he engaged in thought the ENTIRE movie and even used the same things he was in trouble for, being used to help him out in the end.... AWEFUL & DISGUSTING! Maybe that is the way the movies have gone, but I found the buildup very misleading and I was totally disappointed with this film.",1363651200,,930,4.574850299401198

5421647,4,B00AF6B22E,"Anytime that you can consistently be nominated for an academy award, you are certainly doing something right. Washington has been nominated many times and he has won twice.  It goes without saying that he is one of the best actors working today.

I am of the opinion that characters who seem to have it all, a successful career, charisma, looks, etc. who succomb to drugs and alcoholism, are particularly impressive to the public and the academy.  A long time ago, I watched the movie ""The Days of Wine and Roses"" and Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick received accolades for playing a couple destroyed by alcohol.

The scene is set in ""Flight"" in the very first scene when Washington is shown, doing cocaine and alcohol with a stewardess, she is later killed in the movie, before he has to go on a fairly routine flight from Florida to Georgia.  At first, Washington is hailed as a hero for landing a plane that was flawed and it is mentioned that no other pilot could have done this.  However, when an investigation indicates that he had drugs and alcohol in his system while flying the aircraft, the end result is that he ends up in jail for at least five years.  He actually admitted to the fact that he had coke and alcohol in his system at the time.

I thought that Tamara Tunie was good as a surviving stewardess, and I wish that Garcelle Beauvais had been in the film for more than one scene.  Don Cheadle is a great actor but I think that he was miscast as the attorney for Washington character.  The greatest supporting character was John Goodman who was the supplier for Washington and who actually saved his life.  Goodman was hilarious. I am not familiar with the man who played the co-pilot but he did well as the moral conscious of the movie who knew that Washington was drunk during the flight and the co-pilot is now going to ruined for life and blames Washington (not the fact that the plane was flawed).

Many stories are written about people who's downfall is within themselves.  It is known as hubris and most of us are existing with it.  This portrayal is one of the better ones in recent years and is truly brought to light by a great actor,  Denzel Washington. However, I do believe that like a lot of great actors, Washington is playing himself more in movies than playing the character.  John Wayne and many others became so comfortable playing themselves that they are hardly to be considered acting anymore. Unfortunately, Denzel is falling into that category as well but if you like him as an actor, you will certainly enjoy this film. It is well written but not suspenseful because you can pretty much tell what the end result will be.",1363651200,,2657,4.550420168067227
5421648,3,B00AF6B22E,I was disappointed about a film that didn't show more of the details on this plane crash The pilot used a manuver that only he could have performed that resulted in only 2 casualties.  The drama just wasn't there.  It is a story mainly about alcoholics.  An alcoholic pilot is every passengers nightmare!,1363651200,,304,4.69811320754717
5421649,1,B00AF6B22E,"This movie was ridiculously terrible.  It was deplorable in its presentation and decadent in the extreme.  This movie glorifies drug use, prostitution and then tries to say you should have a conscience.  It drags on and on in places and is not enjoyable at all.

5421694,5,B00AF6B22E,"While there were a few unpleasant surprises in this movie, I thought it was awesome in the sense that it is like having a front row seat in a train wreck without being directly involved, and seeing what happens before and afterward.

I prefer to learn from other people's mistakes, and dude, some of this movie felt real. Just looking at it made me grateful that I am only addicted to computers, movies and reading books.

There was one point where Denzel and John Goodman were doing a sort of cowboy swagger down a hallway, and it reminded me of that scene in Malcolm X where Denzel and Spike Lee, I think it was, were striding down the street in their zoot suits.

After making a movie like this, Denzel has carte blanche from me, even if one of his future movies winds up like Fallen, where he doesn't win and it's never over. I didn't like that one at all. I even watched Fallen twice to make sure I was giving it a fair shake.

Fallen aside, I wonder why he doesn't make even more movies than I've seen him in. (Oh wait. Maybe he has.) After an IMDB check of their movies with actor creds, Denzel Washington, 53; Bruce Willis, 94; Tom Cruise, 40 (really? wow.); and another favorite actor of mine, just for kicks, Don Cheadle, 74. That's an eye opener. I had no idea Don Cheadle had that many. He's in ""Flight"" as well. Something to look forward to.",1363478400,,1354,4.339920948616601

5421701,4,B00AF6B22E,"I was thoroughly surprised by ""Flight"".

I thought it was going to be a movie about a plane crash and its repercussions. But this is the backstory for a movie about redemption and grace. We see three characters who are addicted to substances. One unfortunately, never gets the chance to recover, however in her final act of saving a passenger from dying, did something magnificent. Another, has the courage to tackle it head on, acknowledge her weakness and seek help. And then we have the third, played by Denzel Washington. For the majority of the movie he refuses to accept his addiction even though he is powerless to stop its grip on him.

Some tremendous acting by Denzel and Kelly Reilly. An outstanding support cast. Even Melissa Leo's fleeting appearance at the end was powerful in her compassion for Denzel when he finally admits his struggle. She sees a broken man, but one who's courageous act in admitting his addiction is able to start the ""flight"" to freedom.

Very powerful. And I'd encourage you to watch it.",1363392000,,1025,4.779661016949152

Denzel Wasingtion delivers a five-star performance of a flawed man with heroic capabilities, but then the carefully drawn persona turns to mush when a PC ending in tacked on to the tale. Reviewers, I note, seemed to like and dislike this movie for wildly varying reasons. Personally, I wanted to see the anit-hero theme (which is seldom portrayed in mainstream films these days) carried through to the end, to see Whip beat the committee once again and then fly out over the blue Pacific in his dads' cropduster, vodka as a co-pilot, on the last heroic mission available to him.

5421733,4,B00AF6B22E,"I haven't read any reviews of this film as of yet, but almost everyone that I have spoken to has offered pretty much the same feedback. Many believe that the first half hour, the ""flight in the air"" segment, is terrific; but the reactions of most people to the remainder of the film, i.e., the ""flight on the ground"" segment, range from ""just O.K."" to ""a snore,"" with many people putting the blame on ""the television-quality script.""

Upon further questioning, I have found that what seems to bother people the most is their belief that, drunk or not drunk, high or not high, Whip Whitaker would have landed the aircraft successfully, so what's all the fuss about Whip being legally drunk while piloting the aircraft?

It doesn't seem to help that many people are cognizant of the fact that many alcoholics and heavy drinkers eventually reach the point where almost no one can tell if they are drunk because they don't act drunk; and if they don't act drunk, then they are most likely not significantly impaired, or so goes the reasoning.  So people ask, ""How does the film justify Whip going to jail?""

I surmise they have some difficulty dealing with the ambiguity and the complexity of what is going on.  That it was illegal for Whip to be piloting an aircraft with a blood alcohol level above the legal limit just isn't enough reason to justify Whip going to jail.

Interesting.  In real life would these same people be concerned if, for example, they found out that a person driving under the influence went unpunished because a court determined that the person was driving with a blood alcohol level above the legal limit but  was not significantly impaired?  Of course not. But evidently they can accept this in a film.  They can handle the ambiguity in real life but not in a film.

(I loved the ""flight in the air"" segment, but didn't like the rest of the film, upon my first viewing.  But I felt compelled to figure out why I didn't like the remainder of the film, so I watched it again, and came up with the above. This helped place the remainder of the film into proper context.)",1363305600,,2091,4.576407506702413

Curious why investigtors didn't say right off, Oh BTW, you were under the influence? Then he just quits using and all? Makes no sense. No one I ever heard of would have done that. They'd do the denial in short order for quite some time first. Why was co-pilot going 'Oh, no!"" Would YOU say ""Oh, no"" if you were on the plane?? No, me neither. Not even something logical like dammit? He was on my last nerve.

I hated this script, and the music made little sense. but all of which was expensive, or overpriced. Guess how much the Stones must charge to use 'Sympathy"" in a movie? But the song didn't add anything there! Hated the FX. They could have looked at ""Socerer's Apprentice,"" where I was enthralled right off, and looked for Industrial Light and Magic right away. Weird, senseless script. Someone must have called in a favor unfortunately. This could have been so much more. Where was Stallone? He at least knows how to write a good drama script if you're going to pay someone a lot. Get this/order from the library like I did.

The challenges presented to this semi-heroic pilot following his landing were too easy for him to manage but the ending where he is speaking to fellow inmates made me enjoy the story at large.

Flight is about 30 mins.

I really enjoyed the first 30 mins of the movie, it was interesting how we are introduced to Denzels character.
I know many pilots and his character does not quite fit the mold of a normal pilot, this was very hard for me to look past.

After that the movie dives, just like the plane did, however, the movie does not come back up.

This is a hodgepodge of yelling, drug use, and morals.

A seasoned commercial pilot is an alcohol and cocaine abuser(isn't alcohol alone bad enough?)

When the plane failed, he conducted a miraculous maneuver and landed the plane with minimum
causality.
While recovering in the hospital, he met a female heroin addict and developed some kind of relationship.
With unclear reasons, once the addict met the pilot, she seemed to have kicked her habit.
To protect the pilot union, its officials managed to cover up the evidence of the pilot's blood content of alcohol/cocaine.
Only at the end, the pilot' conscience made him admitted his guilt.

5421921,3,B00AF6B22E,"I am somewhat surprised to see Flight on so many Top 10 Best Movies of 2013 lists.  It is a good but not great film, with more than a few flaws that cannot be overlooked.

Lets start with the positive.  Denzel Washington gives strong performance in a role that is absolutely the centerpiece of the film.  The events of the actual airplane flight of the title are gripping, and the action sequences of the flight itself are very well done, and will cause many a viewer to wonder how they were faked. (Did they really crash a plane into a field to generate that footage?)  The story Flight is really about, one mans battle with alcohol and drug addictions, is a compelling one.

Now to the flaws.  Flight aspires to be a serious film, yet it has characters and scenes that detract from the emotional impact the film is attempting to make.  One of these characters is the pilot's drug dealer friend, whose appearances are so over-the-top with quick wittedness that he comes across as a stand-up comic doing a rehearsed routine, rather than a real person.  The co-pilot is an idiot (could any trained, licensed pilot really be that bad under pressure?) whose stupidity is only exceeded later in the film by his wife, a mindless Christian automaton who could have been portrayed by a piece of cardboard with ""Praise Jesus!"" written on it.

As for scenes, several of the ""drinking to excess"" scenes seem over-the-top (is it really possible to consume that much alcohol and survive?), and it is a bit hard to believe that the pilot would think and act that well during the crisis in flight after a night of heavy boozing and drugs, with barely any sleep.  The movie builds towards a courtroom drama scene, yet the courtroom is really a NTSB hearing, and any viewer will immediately be able to cite several hundred other more dramatic courtroom scenes from film and TV history.

If you are looking for a much more compelling film about the evils of alcohol and how they can put a person on a long downward spiral, I recommend ""Leaving Las Vegas"" with Nicholas Cage and Elisabeth Shue.  That film is more difficult to watch because of the powerful emotions its images conjure up, but it ultimately does a much better job than ""Flight"" of conveying the same messages.",1362873600,,2257,4.64070351758794

He plays a pilot in this movie that has flying abilities (even with his drinking problem) are superior to most other pilots.  I don't want to spoil the plot for others.  I'll just say that while under the influence he is faced with an equipment break down in the airplane he piloting that results in him having to crash land.  Only the fact that he was a great pilot and that his natural ability took over was he able to land rather that crash with loss of all lives on board.

There were, however, deaths and injuries and as in all cases for airplane incidents an investigation.

It's filled with caricatures of ""horrible Christians"" like the ungrateful, incompetent, evangelizing co-pilot ( a good Georgia boy) and his hate-filled born-again Christian wife.  And a very, very thin veneer of redemption.  Yes, in the end, he realizes he's a drunk; I guess that's what you call dramatic irony. And it's only the 50th movie this year to have the Rolling Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"" in the sound track? - completely lame. The movie sucked.",1362873600,3,789,5.069767441860465
5421928,5,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel is fantastic, and everything about this movie is excellently crafted. Even the audio is perfectly constructed; it serves to heighten the drama of a tormented man suffering from addiction. Don't see that too often with a movie.

The only dislike? It's 2.5+ hours long. This is me being picky, and to be frank, I actually didn't regret the length of this movie. However, I'll need to be critical about something...",1362873600,,419,4.901408450704225

""Flight"" was well written, and the performance of the entire cast was exceptional.
In particular, I enjoyed John Goodman; additionally, Denzel Washington performed from the heart.

It will not win any awards (worth mentioning) but it's a great movie to watch when you want to be entertained, want to be able to watch and 'not think' about the plot.

5422024,4,B00AF6B22E,"Honestly, I'll give any movie a chance that includes Denzel Washington in the cast.  The story is good, with a great moral in the end...but there was something about the telling of it that seemed to drag a bit.  It works as a character study about a strong and capable, talented pilot, who struggles with denying his addictions.  In a profession where egos flare easily and stress can be high, I'm sure alcoholism can be a problem--for all involved.  It was encouraging to see the lengths to which the profession and the legal system continued to go to pursue the truth as well as justice.  No easy answers here.",1362787200,,612,4.577981651376147

You're watching a man struggling with his own demons, and although you don't want to route for him because in real life you would be upset if a pilot was intoxicated while you were on a plane, you are. I have seen many people struggling with the pain of addition, and it takes a dramatic life situation for them to get clean. I thought this movie brilliantly showcased how someone could struggle with such addictions and not be a bad person.",1362700800,,536,4.37

The film is actually quite deft and subtle, it is a good drama. I can't think of a more compelling American actor around than DW, he is often overlooked because he doesn't play the Hollywood Game but is, apparently, a decent family man.",1362700800,,353,4.709677419354839
5422041,1,B00AF6B22E,We typically are Denzel Washington fans but the story line and dialogue really turned my wife and me off.  We have no problem with language so long as it supports the story and there is a meaningful story line.  Neither was present in this movie.  I gave it 1-star because that is the lowest you have.  I would expect (& hope) Denzel Washington's future roles are nothing like this.  He is too talented for this.,1362700800,6,412,4.44
5422042,1,B00AF6B22E,"The little sock-puppet skit that Seth MacFarland did for the Oscars was sooo much better than the actual movie. The movie dragged on and was so awful that I kept asking my husband if he really wanted to finish it. It was simply painful to watch Denzel Washington continue to fall off the wagon and not get any help, meanwhile his heroine junkie white trash girlfriend has no problem with recovery? I'm sorry, but I think not. Totally unrealistic and so far from ""powerful"" I can't imagine who was paid to say that in the first place.",1362700800,3,533,4.505154639175258

5422063,1,B00AF6B22E,"Having worked for the airlines for about 30 years, I can tell you that Flight is a terrible movie-laughable in spots and just plain dumb.  This is pure Hollywood fantasy. 1. Commercial Airplanes ( ie 717's or MD 80's)  do NOT fly inverted. Ridiculous.  2. Pilot unions do NOT enable drunk pilots- house them or pay for their highs.  3. Airline CEO's fire drunk pilots faster than a jet at VR.  3. If anyone suspects a pilot (or any crew member ) of drinking during the 8 hour ""bottle to throttle"" rule, EVERY time they land, (or even prior to take off)  they'll either pee in the cup or blow in the tube. 4. Once you are under an NTSB investigation you are literally locked away until they finish their questions.  5. The FAA in a situation like this is your WORST enemy and where were they in this movie? 6. If this guy is a drunk pilot who killed people, it's Federal..so the FBI gets involved, too.  7. Drug dealers do NOT have access to people under investigation in hospital rooms. 8. NTSB hearings are Federal hearings; there are no ""objections"" during hearings, especially by the pilot union. A lawyer can NOT get information disqualified ...totally stupid, inaccurate and typical Hollywood nonsense.  Who ever wrote this clap trap...next time write about what you KNOW.

If the aircraft is rolled to the inverted position (as done by Washington), the aircraft will enter an ""inside loop.""

Washington's performance is noteworthy BUT taken as a whole the movie is nothing but an 'infomercial' for Alcoholics Anonymous.  Two of my adult (ages 40+) children also have seen the movie and they agree.

5422081,4,B00AF6B22E,I thought Denzel Washington did an excellent job in this role. I'm glad he did finally admit to what he did and not let the airlines and lawyers  get him off.,1362614400,,158,4.096774193548387
5422082,2,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel is great as usual, but the story is really stupid at times.  My husband and I were laughing out loud during a part where Denzel is confined to a guarded hotel room to keep him sober, but he just happens to wake up and find an adjoining door open and a mini-bar full of booze.  Please.  Then, on top of that when they find him laying in the bathroom drunk and bleeding the next morning, a union official and his lawyer ask Denzel's friend to come and give him some lines of coke to straighten him up fast.  Please.  Probably the oddest thing about the movie is that we never really understood whether he was really responsible for the crash or not (which was the main question of the movie).  We thought 'no' based on the review of the plane, but then 'yes' since he kept apologizing to the passengers (whose lives we thought he really saved)...  just confusing and not well written.",1362614400,,889,4.384146341463414

If you can overlook that scene the rest of the movie is exciting and emotionally dramatic.  I can see why Denzel got the nomination for this role.

5422104,5,B00AF6B22E,"I found this movie to be riveting. The story highlights a plane crash and the investigation into the cause(s) afterwards. I don't want to give too much away, but suffice it to say, you can look at the movie as either an action film with amazing character development or a character study with an awful lot going on in the background. Either way, the acting, the script and the cimetography are all top notch. Add a great soundtrack and a very realistic yet insightful look at a common but tragic and poorly understood affliction and you have a phenomenal movie.",1362614400,,561,4.62

The problems people can get themselves into does not discriminate, so good the story was on target with this situation as well.  Sometimes the stereotype for durg/alcohol problems are not correct.  Anyone anywhere may end up with problems much bigger than they can handle on their own.

It turns out she is a flight attendant who has a brief part saving a child as the plane is crashing.  We need to know that she and Denzel are ""close"" to explain why he tells the truth later about what happened, but this could be done without so much nudity.  Another sequence visits the set of a porno movie and has dialogue that is quite vulgar and unnecessary.  How any of this relates to the main message about substance addiction is largely undeveloped.  I felt that the movie tried to make up for it's limitations by throwing some grossness our way at the beginning.  After 10 or 15 minutes the movie begins and is a fair movie otherwise.",1362528000,,907,4.4397590361445785

5422139,4,B00AF6B22E,"Intense.  Confounding. Disturbing.
  ""Flight"" is an excellent movie.  It opens with a daytime scene of 2 people in a hotel room who have obviously been partying pretty hard.  Next thing you know, they're boarding a jetliner....they're part of the crew.  Oh yeah, and one of those people are your pilot....welcome aboard.
  This is not a disaster movie.  At least not in the sense we are use to.  It's a character study of an addict.  Thing is, you don't hate him.  You root for him.  But not in a rah rah way.  You know this guy.  He's your friend, cousin, uncle, dad.  He's a good person deep down, but seriously, seriously flawed.  You pray he gets the help he needs.  Well, it's never a smooth road.
  Denzel Washington is one of our great actors.  He's so good, you kind of take it for granted he'll always deliver a great performance.  He is amazing in this movie.  Think about it...he plays a self-destructive addict who pretty much burns every bridge...and you don't hate him...WOW.  His performance in ""Flight"" was nominated for an Academy Award deservedly so.

Moviegoers who can endure this type of movie have been desensitized to the point of not being shocked by anything. It is shocking to me that Hollywood has gone this far.

The film then turns into a F-bomb dropping advocate for drugs and alcohol usage. The characters have NO redeeming qualities. After the first ten minutes you hope for someone to like or even care about to show up in the film...Don't hold your breath. After twenty minutes, and the film still not getting interesting-I mean I didn't even care what happened to the guy or anyone else in the film-we walked out. This was the first film I have ever walked out of at the theatres, and that is saying a lot!!

If you like watching cheap naked woman, using drugs, hearing the F-bomb A LOT, and characters that you don't care about with a story, that could be interesting but isn't, then by all means watch this movie.

5422230,1,B00AF6B22E,Headline's enough. Another Forest Gump glossification of events. This one's got a great first act and nothing else. Zemeckis should retire.,1362355200,3,139,5.666666666666667
5422231,4,B00AF6B22E,"From the title and cover thought it would be about a WW2 pilot, but after talking with my partner in crime Blade Braxton,(Wrestlecrap), I was corrected. Denzel usually delivers the goods, and he goes all the way in this film. Some nice eye candy from Nadine Velazquez, and dark humor from John Goodman. Anyone whose ever struggled with addiction can relate, hits hard. Don't sleep on this one!

5422233,4,B00AF6B22E,A compelling if difficult to watch story about alcohol and drug addiction. In-air sequences were authentic and riveting and as always Washington brings depth to a character living with a lot of pain.,1362355200,,199,5.0606060606060606

5422235,3,B00AF6B22E,"This was a well-acted gripping thriller, but ultimately left me feeling more stressed out than anything else. Denzel was, as usual, impressive and totally believable!",1362355200,,166,5.68
5422236,4,B00AF6B22E,"Really good. Very intense. I was expecting more of an action / investigative thriller, and while it had components of that, it was largely about alcohol addiction. They did a great job of portraying that addiction. Denzel is always great.",1362355200,,238,4.975
5422237,1,B00AF6B22E,Certainly didn't promote confidence in those who fear putting their lives in the hands of druggies.  Too convincing of stupidity.,1362355200,,129,5.45
5422238,4,B00AF6B22E,Denzel did an admirable job with this movie.  It did not lack for interest and kept your attention.  Woulod recommend this movie.,1362355200,,129,4.818181818181818
5422239,5,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel does a gret job portraying addiction.  Very well done and worth watching.  It brings a great understanding of the struggles and the lengths,addictive behavior,will go in order to continue and hide their behavior.",1362355200,,219,5.411764705882353
5422240,4,B00AF6B22E,"Denzel is a great actor and he is what makes the movie great.  The flight and crash scenes were amazing and so was the charter of the Capt.  I also felt quite sad for many of the characters whom had just thrown most of their lives away.
Overall, it was exciting but also caused pause to consider the lives of the characters and what could have been.",1362355200,,349,4.1940298507462686

5422242,3,B00AF6B22E,Denzel W. did a superb job of acting. But the film was more like a commercial for AA. The idea that he could function so well at that level of intoxication and addiction was not plausible.,1362355200,,188,4.25
5422243,5,B00AF6B22E,"Tough story about alcoholism. So wanted to cheer for a hero, but in the end. .. Great story.  Well done.",1362355200,,104,4.2
5422244,5,B00AF6B22E,Downloaded this movie to take on vacation.  Actually watched it on our flight....ha ha.  The story turns out to be different than you might expect.  Really about addiction and redemption.  Excellent portrayal by Denzel.,1362355200,,219,5.352941176470588
5422245,5,B00AF6B22E,Very well written and acted.  Very intriguing as this problem could be evident in any profession.  Denzel Washington did give an academt award performance.  In retropsect he was just about every scene and gave a stunning performance.,1362355200,,233,5.243243243243243

5422247,4,B00AF6B22E,"This a gripping portrayal of a man's struggle with alcoholism and drug addiction, set in the context of an airplane crash and its aftermath.  The crash sequence is exciting but isn't the main point of the film.  It's a story about the unreasonable highs and profound lows experienced by addicts and the people around them.",1362355200,,322,4.836363636363636
5422248,2,B00AF6B22E,10 minutes into the movie you understand he is an alcoholic. For an hour following they are still reinforcing that fact.,1362355200,,120,4.761904761904762
5422249,4,B00AF6B22E,Fine acting.  Denzel gives another superb performance. Action is intense during the early stages of the film. The story line then takes the viewer on a journey.,1362355200,,160,4.925925925925926
5422260,4,B00AF6B22E,Enjoyed the movie and Amazon was quick to give credit when I mistakenly ordered online when I should have ordered through my Tivo service.  Only downside was it took several hours to download the HD version of the movie and couldn't stream it because it didn't download fast enough to stay ahead of regular viewing (prob b/c of HD resolution),1362355200,,342,4.7

5422262,3,B00AF6B22E,Perhaps I was not too thrilled about the topic--alcoholism--rather than the movie.  Or I felt that the alcoholism of the pilot should have been dealt with separately from the heroics involved in the landing of the aircraft.  Something just fell short for me in completely enjoying this movie.,1362355200,,292,5.0625
5422263,5,B00AF6B22E,"Like every other role he's taken on, Denzel Wahington's performance here is extraordinary. The screenplay too is simply and painfully true.",1362355200,,139,5.666666666666667
5422264,1,B00AF6B22E,"I watched this movie all the way to the end but should have stopped watching it when it became clear this is about alcoholism.  I feel misled by the trailer and movie description.  It makes it seem that the movie is about a hero saving everyone by taking a risky move to fly a plane upside down.  Instead it is about a functioning alcoholic in which case a more realistic ending would have been the pilot continuing to lie to the very end, getting reinstated, keeping his job, and getting in the cockpit and flying again and again until he kills everyone on the plane and on the ground some two more hours of movie later.  Don't waste your time and money on this.",1362268800,,663,4.32258064516129

5422266,4,B00AF6B22E,"A solid good entertaining movie!!!!!!!!! It made me think,, could something like this happen.....a possibility.......Denzel acting skills shine in this movie.  I wish he would take on more interesting stories like this in the future, as he shines in this role.",1362268800,,260,5.341463414634147
5422267,3,B00AF6B22E,"Well, the best thing about this movie is the actual plane crash. Very exciting. Denzel Washington is so cool during this scene. Love to meet the writer who thought of telling flight attendant to talk to black box. The other parts are a little too disconnected. Not too crazy about the female lead actress, reminds me of a weak Diane Keaton, although I loved the flight attendant, nice and believable relationship between she and captain,D W.Too repetitious,we get the point he had a problem, good acting on part of lawyer but unrealistic scenario at hearing, not believable.",1362268800,,574,4.927835051546392
5422268,4,B00AF6B22E,"When my husband and I started watching this I almost stopped the movie because I felt the nudity, drugs, and alcohol were going be the theme of this movie.  I'm not a prude, but I thought the movie was about a plane crash.  The story is told about addictions and broken relationships.  I thought the characters and acting were very good.  I won't give away the ending, but it is surprising and emotional.  Worth the wait.",1362268800,,421,4.4868421052631575

5422280,5,B00AF6B22E,This is an excellent movie that demonstrates how politics distort an excellent act.  One's personal life should not be used to diminish superior accomplishments unless that personal life had a detrimental effect on performance.,1362268800,,227,5.676470588235294
5422281,5,B00AF6B22E,"I toughly enjoyed this movie,exciting and frustrating at the same time. Superb acting by Denzil giving just the right touch devil may care ,recklessness and finally sensitivity to the role.",1362268800,,189,5.333333333333333
5422282,2,B00AF6B22E,Just another part of media and government propaganda. Presenting people in positions of power that rarely exist in reality. Wanting to show how it should but is not. Don't try to brainwash me. I resent it.,1362268800,,205,4.722222222222222
5422283,3,B00AF6B22E,"Great story, lots of great moments. A few too many Hollywoodisms, and way too long. I think film makers are too lazy these days, editorial no longer means cutting a film down to it's bare essence, and movies seem to labor on and over indulge in moments that really aren't necessary. Sure, you want to tell the story without a narrator, or lots of expository dialogue, but when you hammer a point home half a dozen times with the same tricks it gets a bit tedious.

Great story otherwise, nice performances, 3/5.",1362268800,,511,4.554347826086956
5422284,5,B00AF6B22E,"The scenes in the airplane are about as nail-biting-exciting as you can get but, in reality, this is not a movie about an airplane.  It goes much deeper than that and delves into one aspect of the human condition.  I found it to be an excellent movie, with Denzel doing a superlative job as he seems to always do.
The DVD has an excellent widescreen picture and the sound is also quite good.
I am glad I purchased this item, and would do so again.",1362268800,,447,4.247058823529412

5422286,5,B00AF6B22E,This is a wow movie.  Great story line.  He had acting like an alcoholic down pat also.  I could swear he was really drinking in this movie.,1362268800,,140,4.111111111111111
5422287,5,B00AF6B22E,A great movie. Avoided all the Hollywood cliches.  Love Denzel Washington. What a credible acting job.  A interesting take on the hero story.,1362268800,,141,5.086956521739131
5422288,4,B00AF6B22E,Would rate it 4.5 stars.  Great cast - John Goodman is over the top.  Showed the power of alcohol addiction.  Was not expecting that ending.,1362268800,,140,4.52
5422289,4,B00AF6B22E,I really like Denzel Washington movies (not all).  I hate to see characters that are down on luck and have chosen to destroy their life and those around them.  What I did like was finally some integrity and honesty shine through.,1362268800,,229,4.560975609756097

5422301,4,B00AF6B22E,The movie gets off to an intense star and has some great acting - although I thought the John Goodman character was a bit cliche/over the top.  Denzel is excellengt as always and I did appreciate the honest end of the movie.  Some nudity/drug and alcohol use make this movie inappropriate for young teens.,1362268800,,305,4.62962962962963

Excellent flick!",1362268800,,265,5.82051282051282
5422305,1,B00AF6B22E,It wasn't what I thought it was built up to be.  Turned it off about 1/3 the way through.  It just wasn't good.,1362268800,2,111,3.782608695652174

5422307,1,B00AF6B22E,This movie stunk. The description describes a mystery surrounding a plane crash. This was nothing more than a movie about a drunk/junkie and his own personal struggle. I've never been more disappointed in a film.,1362182400,,212,5.085714285714285
5422308,4,B00AF6B22E,This movie does a great job at not only showing a pilot and his struggles but also show the strangle hold that alcoholism can have on people.,1362182400,,141,4.2592592592592595
5422309,2,B00AF6B22E,"I've enjoyed Denzel Washington in many of his movies, but I didn't like the plot of this movie or the language.

5422321,4,B00AF6B22E,"I am not a huge Denzel fan, but I always give his movies a try. He is such a diverse actor that you slmost oew it to yourself to him. This movie showed the not so sexy side of him and think I prefer him in these types of roles. I think movie was underrated and missed. Very good plot and actors.",1362182400,,295,3.774193548387097

5422323,1,B00AF6B22E,This is the worst movie i ever saw. The story was very wreak and the best part of the movie is the flying scene that it 15 min boy this movie suck. Forgod sack we know this is has a drinking problem why do we have to keep going on this has a drinking problem. The movie is way to go long. The other problem unnecessary nudity in beginning of movie PEOPLE GROW UP WE DON'T NEED NUDITY IN MOVIE IT WRECK THE MOVIE!!!!!. This the most boring movie i ever saw. Don wast your money on this piece of crap!!!,1362182400,,501,3.9702970297029703
5422324,4,B00AF6B22E,This DVD was another in the line of successful dramas from Denzel Washington.  It was good but somewhat predictable.  Performance was sensational.,1362182400,,146,5.590909090909091
5422325,1,B00AF6B22E,Denzel did a good job acting but this was the worst film I watched in years because all he did was drink and snort thru the whole movie.  If Alcoholics Anonymous or Drug Users Anonymous ever wanted a good promotional film this was it.,1362182400,,234,4.318181818181818
5422326,4,B00AF6B22E,It's more of a rare occasion nowadays to see a movie where brilliant actors are given the chance to fully immerse in their characters.  This is easily one of Denzel's best roles. I was very enchanted watching his broken character's struggle to overcome his demons.  A very lifelike and humble story.,1362182400,,299,4.8431372549019605
5422327,1,B00AF6B22E,"This movie was not ""powerful"" it was terrible.  People who fly should be even more afraid that their pilot has alcohol and drug abuse problems.  Sad, sad movie.

5422346,4,B00AF6B22E,"The official movie trailer pretty much sums up what you will see in this movie, unless of course you want to catch a glimpse of 2 pretty actresses.

WARNING:

The first 30 seconds consist of full nudity of sexy Latina actress Nadine Velazquez! This scene would be interrupted by a toilet flush (that sound could have been edited out!). LOL!

You will also see the lead actor snorting cocaine and getting drunk in this over-rated movie and a 5 second shot of his rear ass.

If the movie trailer isn't obvious enough, it's about an alcoholic pilot (played by Denzel Washington) who saves his passengers from a faulty plane that comes apart while he is flying it. Not all see it that way though and he is blamed for the crash. Along his road to recovery, he meets with interesting people who reminds him of the existence of God and his alcoholism. Is he going to be reminded as a hero or a drunk? He has to make his final choice.",1362182400,,926,4.39766081871345

Denzel Washington's acting is superb, teamed with hilarious comic relief is given by John Goodman during his brief appearances in the film.  Excellent storyline and intense moments.

5422348,5,B00AF6B22E,This was a great movie during the flight I was upside down and holding my breath.  Denzel did not over act his part.  It's hard to write a review without being a spoiler.  I would recommend this movie.  A  good story is hard to find these days that's simple most people can relate to or have gone though themselves.  Well done,1362182400,,326,4.262295081967213
5422349,2,B00AF6B22E,The movie was good up until the plane crash.  Then same old storyline of how an alcoholic remains in denial then finally realizes his problem in the 11th hour to save his girlfriend.,1362182400,,182,4.515151515151516
5422360,5,B00AF6B22E,This is a True to Life movie I am a close friend to an intercontinental pilot who could put this kind of movie to shame ..The difference is the person (pilot) I know NEVER had an incident with any kind of investigation needed...I've been here & Seen the partying just the same as the opening scene... Great Movie ..NO GUNS NO Shooting ..Just REALISTIC LIFE of A SINGLE person with a TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY !!,1362096000,,411,4.5675675675675675

I didn't know much about this movie except for the 30 second trailer on TV, so I was truly shocked at the real story line.  Great anti-hero plot.  I was sucked in from the opening scene.  Not for the faint of heart!!!",1362096000,,331,4.190476190476191

5422366,4,B00AF6B22E,"This movie definitely showed a different side to pilots that I wasn't aware existed.  Wasn't an uplifting movie but at the same time, was entertaining.  It came packaged appropriately without any issues.",1362096000,,203,5.3125
5422367,4,B00AF6B22E,"Fans of Denzel Washington will not be disappointed with his performance in FLIGHT but their expectations of what the movie is about may not be met.  IMO, FLIGHT is a perfect title for the movie because that in a nutshell is what it is about:  one ""would have been"" mid-air catastrophe if it were not flown by the experienced pilot, Whip Whitaker, with an outstanding 30-year career as a commercial pilot in denial about the cause and effect both in his career and personal life due to his drug and alcohol addictions. FLIGHT as in an on-the-job pilot high on alcohol and drugs; FLIGHT as in the movie's theme of one life ending plane crash diverted by a pilot everyone labeled HERO who finally had to come to terms with his addictions and the consequences of his choices.",1362096000,,771,4.579710144927536
5422368,4,B00AF6B22E,"This movie was good. I thought that it would be good. It was. I was right about that.

5422369,4,B00AF6B22E,I am surprised that Hollywood created a movie with such a powerful message about damaging personal habits. Very powerful. Denzel Washington is awesome in this role.,1362009600,,164,5.346153846153846

5422383,5,B00AF6B22E,Denzel was extraordinary (not his usual character) in this film as was John Goodman.  The plot and story line were excellent.  I watched it on a flight from Minneapolis to Tucson and would love to watch it again.  I think it would be even more dramatic on a screen bigger than my 9 inch Kindle.,1362009600,,294,4.3090909090909095
5422384,4,B00AF6B22E,Denzel does a creditable job portraying an alcoholic pilot.  The opening scenes are quite exciting.  A story of redemption and responsibility..,1362009600,,143,5.761904761904762
5422385,3,B00AF6B22E,"Well, the story line hit home, and I was entertained the whole time, but Denzel just wasn't sparkling like he has done in the past.  Perhaps that is the point, not sure.",1362009600,,169,4.28125
5422386,3,B00AF6B22E,"A very well-produced (scenes of the plane in distress, in particular) and acted movie.  Denzel once again shows his chops for portraying a charismatic and extremely flawed character that is believably motivated.  But the story simply began to lose my interest.  The title character, while charismatic, is not honorable and, as he devolves further into self-destruction, becomes less and less likeable, despite his charisma.  I began to not really care about his life. No other characters in the movie were interesting enough to keep me engaged (except one character who sort of disappears mid-movie).  There is some incentive to keep watching to find out if the title character will ever take the fall he deserves or if he will redeem himself, but by the end I wasn't invested enough to be moved by the impact all of his previous actions finally took on him.",1362009600,,858,4.930555555555555

5422389,2,B00AF6B22E,"Flight was a movie built around an amazing, though fictional, event. An inebriated airline captain uses his vast experience and knowledge to pull off a maneuver which saves most of the lives on board his doomed airliner. The story leading up to the event showed some promise with the introduction of Denzel Washington as the airline captain and an as yet unrelated female co-star's (Kelly Reilly) story line involving her drug use. The moving tends to bog down after the miraculous stunt pulled off by the pilot. It then becomes a character study of Denzel as the flight captain as well as that of the female costar (Reilly) as they meet and form a relationship. The remainder of the movie involves the drunken antics of the airline captain as his life stalls and he descends to his own bottom. In general, the movie left this viewer unimpressed as it devolved into somewhat stereotypical characters and their various attempts to deal with the fallout. I will say that Bruce Greenwood and Kelly Reilly were very good as co-stars in an otherwise average movie. Flight left me with the feeling that the movie had a sterling cast of actors whose talent was less than well spent on an average script.",1362009600,,1196,4.7548076923076925

5422406,5,B00AF6B22E,I absolutely loved Flight.  I began watching it thinking it would be 'ok' and ready for the usual Hollywood action movie.  What it was instead was a deeply moving introspective into the mind of a very complex character played perfectly by Denzel Washington.  An EXCELLENT film.,1362009600,,277,4.978260869565218
5422407,3,B00AF6B22E,"Decent movie. A bit predictable but I would definitely recommend it as a decent movie for a night in.

I usually will shy away from 'flying' movies or anything about 'addiction' due to my lifetime vocational saturation! I was drawn to this film because Denzel has so few vehicles for his incredible talent. This did not disappoint and the theme sat fine with me ... it was dealt with so well - and with the kind of humor that comes ONLY from a full appreciation of the absurdity of life. I am very glad I took the (rare) time to see this. The story will stick with me in the same ilk as films like ""Crash"" ... (such writing that depicts men with truth - in all their soulful humanness, there are just too few, in any medium.) Five Stars for Denzel. Speechless.",1361923200,,822,4.24203821656051

The comment of the pilot that now that I'm in jail I'm a free man is insane and gross. Punishing someone for their dysfunction does not address the cause of their drug addiction. To address the cause of their drug addiction they need to explore the distorted thoughts that lead to emotional pain within and they need to address the nutritional needs of the body. If the nutritional needs of the body alone were addressed, you can usually get a person 100% free of the desire to do any drugs within a short time.",1361923200,3,676,4.504065040650406

Like Malcom X Denzel gave a really good performance, for me he usually seems so wooden and like he phoned in his performance for a pay check but not so this time. He really was invested in the character. This was a Denzel screen fest and he chewed up the screen except for the occasional assist from John Goodman.

For me the plot seemed a bit far fetched but for the most part Denzel sold it. You could call it The Uglies of Alcoholism. The best part for me was when Denzel was trying to get people, even long time friends to lie for him.

I ended up fast forwarding through the opening scenes hoping it would improve, but by the third or fourth encounter with what were truly pitiful characters, I'd had enough. Not my kind of movie, that's for sure. If you like a story that opens with titties, drug addicts, and alcoholics, go for it. Really bad movie, IMO. Ever since Training Day, I've had enough of Densel. Never again. His choice in character roles sucks. Big time. Buh-bye.

UPDATE 11/10/2013: So I tried to watch this again now that it's available as an Amazon Prime movie, and I stand by my original review. I just could not get into this story at all. My apologies to Denzel. You are too good an actor to do this kind of crap. I absolutely loved The Book of Eli. Best movie you've ever done.

5422500,2,B00AF6B22E,"here's a certain wobble to Denzel Washington's chin that starts to appear when he's getting emotional. He sucks it in, he juts it out. With most actors, their eyes let you know when they're feeling deeply. For Washington, it's his chin. And in ""Flight,"" for which he earned his sixth Academy Award nomination, Washington's chin works overtime.

As Whip Whitaker, a cocksure but troubled pilot who wakes up to naked flight attendants, lines of cocaine and angry calls from his ex-wife before heading to the airport to get behind the controls of an airplane, Washington's chin seeks not only to convince those around him, but, ever so subtly, to convince himself of his strength and reliability.

But when the flight equipment goes wonky on what should be a straightforward 52-minute stint from Orlando to Atlanta, Whitaker must seize control of both his own mind and his plane. With help from his mustachioed copilot (Brian Geraghty) and the head flight attendant, Whitaker pulls some daring steering stunts (beautifully and brutally executed by director Robert Zemeckis) and crash-lands the plane in a field, sparing the majority of those on-board a terrible death.

Alas, Whip Whitaker is no Sully Sullenberger, and despite his seemingly heroic efforts, his toxicology report reveals unconscionable levels of intoxicants in his system, raising new questions. Was this crash due to equipment failure or human failure? And how much does it really matter? More importantly, how much can be proven?

A big-shot lawyer from Chicago (played with a detached intensity by Don Cheadle) is sent in to protect Whitaker (and the pilot's union) from a damaging trial. Let the behind-the-scenes cover-up begin.

Meanwhile, Whitaker meets a stunning junkie (played with a nice mix of grit and brokenness by Kelly Reilly) and is in the right place at the right time often enough (twice) to have her move in with him and provide him with attention, connection and a clear example of the redemptive power of self-rehabilitation.

Along with composer Alan Silvestri's rich score, the film's weightier themes attempt to mask the heavy-handedness of it all, but the kind of deep-seated serendipity Zemeckis hooks into in films like ""Forrest Gump,"" ""Cast Away"" and even the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy feels too obvious here, as screenwriter John Gatins blatantly lays out our hero's path to destruction (and possible redemption) while slathering on the religious undertones.

""The way you landed that lane was nothing short of a miracle,"" says one breathless friend. ""God landed that plane,"" declares another. A chain-smoking cancer patient, more plot device than actual character, appears in a hospital stairway and solemnly intones ""You're a stupid *&%#@! if you don't believe in God."" For you-know-who's sake, the wing of the plane takes out the steeple of a church before crashing in a field as a group of believers are praying.
By the time ""an act of God"" has been declared as one of the probable causes of the plane crash we get the point. God's doing his very best to look out for Whip Whitaker, to warn him towards the straight and narrow. The ""Big Book"" of Alcoholics Anonymous lays it out fairly succinctly:

""The alcoholic at certain times has no effective mental defense against the first drink... neither he nor any other human being can provide such a defense. His defense must come from a Higher Power.""

All this set-up means that when Whitaker angrily claims ""I choose to drink,"" we know it's not true. He must drink. He must drink until he can face himself and face this higher power that is monkeying with his flight equipment, sacrificing innocent passengers and setting him up with hot heroin addicts. But why is that more interesting than a functioning alcoholic who actually does choose to drink? Wouldn't a twisted man who crashes a plane, sobers up enough for a phony, finagled trial and then goes unhappily on his way be fascinating?

Gatins carefully carves a path from action-thriller to detective drama to character study and Washington tears admirably through all of it, his wobbly chin lending gravitas to every scene. Sure it's nice that there's a story of redemption deep down at the heart of this fast-paced and engaging film, but it feels a bit unnecessary. Not everybody needs to be saved.",1361836800,,4306,5.018207282913165
5422501,1,B00AF6B22E,"The opening sequence of the plane going down was great. Five stars for the first five minutes.
After the plane crashed so did the movie. Considering this movie stars my favorite actor it had to be really bad to get one star. And it was.

This meandering, boring portrayal of a sad, drunk guy was depressing with no redeeming value.

Definitely not entertaining at all.  The fake Hollywood psudo ""redemption"" court scene was also entirely stupid.

There has to be a ""redemption"" to sell the script. This one was ridiculous. A functioning alcoholic has an epiphany & in a moment when he could have won his entire life back all of a sudden decides he wants to lose & go to jail for ten years?  Then when in jail says he is now ""free""?  What a pile of manure.

Disney meets drug/substance abuse addiction. What a pile of XXXX.",1361836800,7,822,4.476510067114094
5422502,1,B00AF6B22E,"This was a horrible movie. When I watched the trailer, I thought, hmm, here's a strong actor who plays a character with flaws, but probably overcomes them to do something good with his life.' I was SO wrong. This movie is all about booze and drugs, and while the character half-ass tries to overcome his addictions, he cant. So when he has to face the 'court' at the end, he has to snort coke so he can be serious enough to act like he's not drunk and high. It's ridiculous. I would not recommend wasting your money on this movie. And don't let teenagers watch it. Two thumbs down from me.",1361836800,11,589,4.315315315315315
5422503,5,B00AF6B22E,I really liked the man with a vision both for work and drugs and alcohol.  The movie demonstrated what it is like to be a drug addict and alcoholic.

She was supposed to be in Orlando and wound up in Atlanta. It was entertaining. I didn't believe that he wouldn't have just said, ""I have no idea"" when asked about the bottles and let it go. He could have even said that he would not comment on a hero like the dead attendant.

5422516,5,B00AF6B22E,"For all of the people who found this movie boring: please go & seek more depth for your souls. This movie is not about a plane crash. Just sit back & think about it: If the entire movie LITERALLY centered around the plane crash, then it only would have lasted for maybe 20 minutes...if that long. Plane crashes, in reality, only last for a few minutes, and that depends on the severity of the crash itself. This movie is about addictions, taking responsibility & appreciation. It's a movie that most of us can relate to because either we've had or someone we know has had some sort of addiction. 9 times out of 10, that person, or even US-are sometimes in denial about it, and it takes drastic measures for us to snap out of that addictive spell that's over us so that we CAN straighten up & fly right. As always, Denzel Washington delivered an epic performance. John Goodman? Hilarious!!

For the ""nay-sayers"": Please open your minds & look beyond what ""wasn't"" of the plane crash. Only then will you understand & really appreciate the movie.

This is a movie I will happily watch again!",1361836800,,1088,4.545918367346939

The movie is great but the movie buffered at the two most dramatic scenes (plane crash and review board).  After the initial buffering the picture quality went down dramatically.  The picture was blurred and never regained any sign of HD (which I rented at a higher cost).  I checked my computer and other devices to verify internet connection which were great.  We all know what happened.  It was Saturday night and Amazons servers (or whoever they use) were overwhelmed. Come on Amazon, upgrade your technical capabilities.

As a senior Captain for a major airline and previous MD80 driver which this movie portrays, it is very fake from the beginning. Even from a non pilots perspective this movie is more about heavy drug use in hookers and very poor dialogue.  Its also slow moving and computer generated. Please do not waist your money buying this piece of junk. Rent it if you wish but that would be a mistake too as its that bad. If you want to see a much better and more realistic movie about flight or a pilot movie, try to find the old VHS movie called THE PILOT with Cliff Robertson. He died recently BTW.

Though very much a part of the reality of these lifestyles, the nudity and very direct inclusion of pornographic references was way too much, even for a rated-R movie.  Denzel Washinton is usually such a classy actor and this felt more slimy than anything of his I have to watch yet.  I think the graphic nature of the movie drove the point home, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't want lingering images in their minds.",1361664000,,655,4.629310344827586

5422623,4,B00AF6B22E,Once again Denzel nailed the role. I like the way the movie portrayed him as one of the best at what he does. The movie is a good example of what drugs can do to a person and why it's not an option to use. This is great in every movie he acts in.,1361664000,,246,3.574074074074074
5422624,2,B00AF6B22E,"I'd like to see the movie, though I haven't.  I'm afraid Amazon has jumped the proverbial ship when it comes to integrity.  Five bucks for the standard definition?  Six for HD if you really even get HD after forking out the dough for it.  720 is HD to Amazon via streaming, but even that isn't guaranteed.  Amazon determines your bandwidth and streams what you can handle. Who can justify that?  I don't care how big your big screen is, it's not as big as a big screen at a theater.  When these online streaming options even get close to the cost of seeing it in a theater, they lose my $$$'s every time.  Golly, sometimes capitalism blows.",1361664000,,640,4.410256410256411

I have seen Lincoln and agree that Daniel Day Lewis did an amazing job, but I think Denzel actually does a much better acting job in this film.  His portrayal of the arrogant, miserable, alcoholic pilot is entirely believable and nearly flawless.  The script is great, but I think Denzel did some serious work to get into character and has given us one of his best career performances.

Brought up on charges, his union hires a lawyer who can get him off if he just plays along.

5422649,5,B00AF6B22E,This movie was not about the flight but the fact that the Pilot is held to such a high standard that we forget his human weaknesses. It also reveals how people with problems hide behind their problems rather than face them.,1361664000,,223,4.463414634146342

5422653,4,B00AF6B22E,I can agree that it starts off fast then slow. I drifted off a few times on the slow parts. Am a true action pack fan and hoped the action was going to keep me awake but the music did. I love seeing Denzel as himself without the makeup and disguise but he looked as himself which he looked good. Also love seeing him standing against another great actor Don which the two are no comparison. The story had its twists and turn which I kind of find interested. I wish there was some consecutive plane crashes instead one big one in the beginning that wrapped itself around the plot. There should have been minor ones then the big showed in the movie last that would have suspected something was wrong with the plot for sure. Overall I like the movie and the message about alcoholism it was trying to send. And I seriously doubt that there will be a sequences.,1361577600,,856,4.3229813664596275

5422657,3,B00AF6B22E,Denzel Washington's performance is one for the ages. This is one of Washington's most complex characters. He really takes this character to a new level. Flight is about an addict who is also a pilot. He has mastered the craft of appearing normal while still highly intoxicated. He resembles so many people who suffer with addictions and are able to function in a normal capacity. I was irritated with him during the movie because of his inability to drop the habit. That's a true testament to how hard it is for addicts to come clean. Great movie! Not recommended for kids.,1361577600,2,573,4.683168316831683
5422658,4,B00AF6B22E,Mr Washington is a great actor but I was not wild about this movie.  He played a good part and did a great job but my spouse enjoyed it very much.  Maybe I was just tired when watching it.  Any movie with Denzel Washington is worth watching.,1361577600,,241,4.085106382978723

5422672,2,B00AF6B22E,"Good theme, and drama.  It's a very well polished film, but to suggest someone ""high and drunk"" can coordinate the required actions to land a plane, like no other pilot can, is simply going against logic and scientific tests.",1361577600,,225,4.769230769230769

5422676,3,B00AF6B22E,"The previews for this movie made it seem like an exciting story about a pilot and flying. Also the drama of his legal problems. The movie has a ridiculous amount of screen time for apple products; there is a 20 second segment of the screen of an iphone. The movie was a little slow for me; the beginning was five minutes of denzel in bed and a naked woman walking around. I thought this would be a movie similar to Unstoppable with pilots instead of engineers. Despite the drawbacks there are positives to the movie. The airplane segments were correct and possible in real life. The sound track was okay, but the same style of music the entire time. I enjoyed the parts about the accident and his legal battle, but everything else was boring to me.

5422689,1,B00AF6B22E,"Mainly, I ordered this movie because I admire Denzel Washington, also because the story was meant to be about an expert pilot who was charged with FUI, in spite of having saved many lives during a spectacular plane crash.  This film was a huge disappointment from the very first scene, until I finally gave up watching in the hope that the character, never mind the film, would rise above itself.  I'm shocked that DW would even consider being involved in a film this low. Any more roles like this from Denzel and I'll give up on him too.

There was a part when he and the heroin girl were hooking up, that I thought this should be a made for TV movie.  Then the movie took off, as Denzel battled with the demon of alcohol.  During the board hearing, Denzel's character could not continue the lies.  This was the scene when he first admits that he is an alcoholic.  This scene and the hotel room scene was more than worth the money.  Beast of the southern wild will dominate the academy so I would be surprised if Denzel's movie even gets a mention.",1361577600,,606,4.3097345132743365

I have several very talented, highly skilled, functioning alcoholics in my life, most of them now on-the-mend and long time sober - and his portrayal brought back many old memories of how they truly could not help destroying their own lives as long as they drank.

5422697,1,B00AF6B22E,"I watched this movie because I was intrigued with the idea of a hero saving everyone by taking a risky move to fly a plane upside down to save everyone. I like hero movies.  Unfortunately, this is NOT a hero movie, and the trailer showing the plane maneuver really misled me. There is almost no redeeming quality to this movie. The most significant lesson I learned is that an alcoholic can take cocaine to wake up and function while drunk. I also learned that by taking cocaine, he at times might appear not to be drunk when he really is. I didn't know that. Now I do.

This movie to me was offensive with nudity and language, primarily because my young daughter was sitting on the couch next to me. I can look past that in movies that have some redeeming quality, like a good moral or lesson. The only lesson here is that an alcoholic finally told the truth to protect the name of a dead person, and this resulted in years of prison time for him. Did he finally do the right thing? I think many people would say no, that he was stupid to tell the truth.

The movie did accurately portray the problems of substance abuse, causing broken families and hospital stays. It also highlights that sometimes a drunk can be functional even when flying an aircraft. Okay, we already know this. The problem was that it was so boring and depressing to watch this play out. I was expecting a movie with a hero that perhaps I could emulate or aspire to be. Instead, I got a movie about a drunk who constantly lies and in the end gets sentenced to years in prison when in an emotional outburst he finally tells the truth.",1361577600,12,1607,4.367892976588629

Real pilots are not like this, and if they are, they don't fly ATP. Too add insult to injury, Amazon charged me $10 for returning a movie I only watched for 5 minutes before turning it off.

Not just smoking and drinking, but cocaine and speed as well? This is beyond any stretch of the imagination. As for the flying, that was absolutely unrealistic as well. I did not expect the movie to be like a documentary, but I did expect at least a semblance of realism.

Anyone who has loved someone with a substance abuse problem will appreciate the heartache caused but the chance at redemption is something Americans just love - and will love in this movie as well.",1361491200,,524,4.634408602150538

I was booked to act in the cabin crash scene, but was bumped at the last minute, and moved to the NTSB hearing.

This is a movie I would deem good to kill time.

Yes, it has its exciting moments. It has a good acting.

 There are holes in the storyline but you forget that while you are watching it.( it is after the movie ends that you start to dissect everything and realize, it could have been done better.)

Minutes could easily have been shaved off this movie- it was a bit protracted and some scenes didn't add much to the story.

Love Denzel but this is not one of his best.

 He is convincing in the role he plays. So convincing, you feel mixed emotions about his character.

  Enjoy it while you are watching it, because it is doubtful this is a movie you will want to watch twice.",1361491200,,715,4.1911764705882355

THE LOST WEEKEND - RAY MILLAND; DAYS OF WINE & ROSES - JACK LEMMON; UNDER THE VOLCANO - ALBERT FINNEY; and Denzel's performance in this film. A complex and dark character, who at the same time, still warrants our sympathy. We cant help but root for him, even though we know, he will eventually succumb, to that next drink. The ending, although a bit Hollywoodish, is really the only acceptable ending this film could have had.

Denzel had me believing this character was real. I was ambivalent about the ending as I was so wrapped up with the character and the choices he made. I won't say more so as not to spoil it for someone who hasn't seen the movie but you won't be sorry watching this one.,1361491200,,424,4.120481927710843
5422772,3,B00AF6B22E,I certainly wouldn't call this his best role ever and the scene in the hotel room at the end was also a stretch. A guard right outside the door didn't hear any of it?  I have to admit though that I didn't like Denzel's character at the end of the movie so in that respect he did an excellent job.  (It's hard to dislike Denzel!)  John Goodman as a drug dealer wasn't the least bit believable.  Really hard to explain other than to say I won't be buying or watching the movie again.  Enough said?,1361491200,,495,4.168421052631579

There are many alcoholics who manage to perform their jobs well, maybe even more than well. None the less, they hurt and neglect many of the people around them, and they need help.

If you are a Denzel fan, and I am, then this is a solid movie with a very interesting first 25 minutes.

If you are looking for a movie that spends most of the time in the air, on a plane, then this isn't that movie.

This is the story of a very flawed pilot who makes a remarkable landing and saves a lot of lives, but is himself a drunk and drug addict.

I think it does an interesting job of showing how people are complicated.

It is not a perfect movie by any means, but Denzel is always interesting to me.

The DW charachter is the most capable I have ever seen, in an impossible circumstance, and despite the fact that he is drunk and on coke. The rest of the film sees him in a self destructive, alcohalic, arrogant, stuper. He's eventially set up to get off scott free and be called a hero, and then confesses for a non-reason. Maybe it's ten percent terrific, then ninety percent depressing and stupid.

Like most of the movie. When you first watch it it is very interesting, but when it's all over you won't want to relive it over again. Not even once. It's just one of those movies. Sorry flight, you won the battle but will lose the war.",1361318400,,395,3.95
5422838,2,B00AF6B22E,"Most movies about alcoholics show us the downward spiral; some show the process of recovery.  OK, fine; we know what we're getting into.

But this movie is incurably dishonest about addiction.

First, a pilot who's drunk is not going to perform a miraculous, highly creative and physically coordinated landing of a fatally damaged plane.  If being drunk made you a better driver, there'd be no such thing as a DUI.  This kind of presentation is exactly what makes drunks feel empowered to go out and prove how heroically and well they drive while loaded.  (That said, the landing sequence is the best part of the movie - really exciting and well-filmed.)

The secondary story of the adorable nubile prostitute who miraculously recovers from her heroin addiction in two weeks - clutching a copy of the Big Book to her chest and enabling the pilot when he's passed out drunk - is preposterous.  Perhaps - am I  pushing it here? - the girlie crap/love-interest stuff in this film (beginning with the opening sequence) is there to titillate, and not to advance the story in any kind of honest way?

The final scene, which seems to be an attempt to impose meaning on all this disorder, rings entirely false.  A guy who's been lying his way through his life - an addict - is unlikely to behave that way under public pressure.

There's one thing that I learned from this movie:  when your plane's crashing, it's not safe to get up and move about the cabin, just like they always say.  ;-)

Denzel's character's brief hard-drinking turn in the excellent *Courage Under Fire* is a much more realistic portrayal of why and how people drink, and why they come to believe they need to stop. (Matt Damon's performance as a heroin addict in that movie is also worth mentioning.)",1361318400,2,1764,4.700325732899023

Denzel is such a great actor he could convince you that pulling a tooth is fun.  He plays another broken and dysfunctional character but he plays it in a way we can admire, that we understand.  You will end up rooting for him even through his flaws.  The movie will leave feeling like nothing was really accomplished but at least you were there to witness it.

FLIGHT is part action, relationship, and drama. All the parts perforate and come apart but Denzil in this movie blends the seams into a watchable viewing experience. The action is wonderful; the relationship aspects are a bit disjointed.
All in all I enjoyed this movie. One I rented to view, which demonstrated my chagrin to rush out when the movie first released. If you enjoy Denzil the actor you won't be disappointed, nor if you just like seeing him on the big screen.",1361232000,,725,4.716535433070866

In this interesting and deeply felt story that opens with the first 15 minutes or so of high drama, the story of addiction and the struggle to overcome it is once again the main plot.  It's directed and acted poignantly and realistically, and should be heeded by all of us who know someone or are, in fact, someone who needs to find a way to get their life back from the very difficult attachment to mind-altering substances.

I mean really nearly everything in this movie is a cliche.

The roller coaster ride gets really old when Denzel puts you in that position of, ""will he do it?"" and he does it every time. By the end you hate his character and can't continue to cheer him on in trying to redeem himself.

OK in-flight action, but it didn't last long.  Denzel's dialogue was also dry and uninteresting the entire time.  I understand he was playing the role of staying calm under pressure, but it was very lame.  He seemed very out of place in this role.
POOR message.  i.e. Possible to not only fly an airplane well, but also crash land one at a .24BAC and high on cocaine.  AND have corrupt lawyers and union leaders get you off scott free.  DRUNK and drugged driving is a huge epidemic, and this film plays right into the ""i can do anything and get away with it"" attitude so prevalent today.

A great performance (Oscar worthy) by Denzel Washington, in a movie with a good script, and great acting but with a predictable ending. Whip Whitaker (Washington) is an alcoholic airline pilot who saves everybody's life (except four people) while trying to land a defective plane. He is also a cocaine addict. Because of the investigation, his drug addiction is revealed and we are in for a solid, amazing, and great performance from Washington that ends as expected. During the movie John Goodman's role as a drug dealer is just fabulous. He is arrogant, funny, and efficient and he is needed by the upper echelon of our society! The movie also reveals the corruption of the pilot's union who are trying to get out of the NTSB investigation by lying. It is not surprising that the union thugs will lie, will do whatever it takes to save their own, and are all corrupt. It just confirms my opinion of the unions.

I am not certain that Denzel Washington will win the Oscar against Daniel Day Lewis in Lincoln, or Joaquin Phoenix in the Master, but all three of them deserve it, although Lincoln is an outstanding movie and the entire cast was nominated as expected.

Four stars because of Washington and Goodman and because of the music. The soundtrack is fabulous. When Goodman appears on the scene with his back pack, sunglasses, and the ""merch"" (he appears in two scenes) he really steals the show...",1361059200,,1454,4.739130434782608

While the underlying story is a good one (even heroes can suffer from addictions and need help), this movie wasn't that enjoyable for several reasons:

1. A nude scene that was completely uncalled for and did nothing for the story. It seemed totally out of place and was just really stupid.

2. Oh so much profanity! Again, this did nothing for the storyline and was just overkill. This movie would have only been better without it.

3. The Christians in this movie are portrayed so falsely and weirdly that I really can't tell if the writer and director were mean-spirited or just ignorant. They neither acted nor spoke like any Christians I've ever met, and it was just a really poor portrayal of Christianity.

In the end, there was very little in this movie that I liked. This may be my least favorite Denzel Washington movie ever.",1361059200,,1007,4.640449438202247

Part of the story line is taken from a post-accident aircraft crash where maintenance issues of a worn elevator jack screw were discovered by the NTSB in a real airliner crash in US history.

By thinking out side of the box of what is considered normal operation of a passenger airliner.  This story will have you on the edge of your seat right at the beginning of the story, and during the flight emergency.

5422969,4,B00AF6B22E,"Akin to cancer, there are no rules when it comes to alcoholism. Victims come from every background. By the time the epiphany takes place -- ""I am an alcoholic,"" -- there's usually a huge wake of subtle destruction in the rear view mirror. What happens in ""Flight,"" director Robert Zemeckis' harrowing 2012 film, is anything but subtle. Denzel Washington plays airline pilot ""Whip"" Whitaker, a likable veteran who arrives at the airport after a night of booze and cocaine. He wears sunglasses and stumbles as he boards the jet airliner with more than 100 souls. He requests black coffee and Advil and his young co-pilot (Brian Geraghty) gives him a troubled stare. Maybe he has the flu.

It's not a spoiler when I say the airplane's going to crash, as the scenes are heavily emphasized in the trailer. After contemplation, I realized multiple incidents taking place before the crash are open to interpretation. Whip decides to fly through a violent thunderstorm much to his co-pilot's consternation. Certainly not the product of sober thinking, was such reckless behavior a contributing factor to what eventually happens? There's a loud metallic bang, and suddenly the airliner is nose-diving for the ground.

Everything that happens during the beginning of ""Flight"" is plausible. We are familiar with Sully Sullenberger's miraculous landing of his crippled airliner on the Hudson River. There's also the 2000 tragedy of Alaska Airlines Flight 261, suffering an identical malfunction as the plane of this film. What pilots attempted in an effort to halt a dive is exactly what Whip achieves. It's an incredibly unorthodox maneuver which could only have been accomplished because he was under the influence. Okay, that's as far as I'm going on the crash, suffice to say it's one of the most extraordinary scenes ever devised.

Zemickis has forged a unique r&eacute;sum&eacute;  over the years marked by experimentation and respectable gloss. He gave us the hilarious cult classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Used-Cars-1980/dp/B004INJ7GI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Used Cars (1980)</a>, followed closely by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Back-to-the-Future-Trilogy-Blu-ray/dp/B003AQCV08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Back to the Future Trilogy [Blu-ray</a>]. His high mark was the American fable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forrest-Gump/dp/B0035JRVBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forrest Gump</a>, which won him the Academy Award. He gave us another fable with the wonderful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cast-Away/dp/B0026O475M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cast Away</a>. ""Flight,"" his most serious film, is arguably his least commercial. It too is a fable, replete with demonic tapping and the haunting siren call of a refrigerator possessing glistening bottles of vodka.

Saying Washington gives a great performance is redundant, as he never gives a bad performance. His undeniable gifts are coolly reminiscent of Spencer Tracy, Cary Grant, or more recently Jack Nicholson. Whip Whitaker is one of the greatest roles of his career. He's chunky, in need of a shave and on the verge of a breakdown. He repeatedly awakens with a hangover, quickly striding to the kitchen to pour the remaining liquor down the drain. The hangover wears off, and his coffee table is soon covered with beer bottles. He begins a tentative relationship with Nicole (Kelly Reilly), a recovered heroin addict. She tries to help him attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. In the immortal reaction of all alcoholics, he uncomfortably sits in the back and leaves early.

""Flight"" is a brave film dealing with a serious subject, though one wonders if the airliner crash was the hook allowing it to be financed. I admit I enjoyed details involving the investigation, including the political machinations of a lawyer (Don Cheadle) and union rep (Bruce Greenwood) as they attempt to hide Whip's failed toxicology report. Slowly, Whip achieves his epiphany, though in a forum so public I found it unconvincing. Call me cynical, but I don't believe Washington's character would announce his sickness in such a manner. Epiphanies take place in a jail cell, or hard Sunday mornings on the bathroom floor.

In spite of its symbolism, not to mention comedic forays with John Goodman as drug dealer Harlan Mays (who knows, maybe the devil does wear a Hawaiian shirt), ""Flight"" has moments of overwhelming truth. I knew a friend who turned his life around after viewing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clean-and-Sober/dp/B000I5UYTE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clean and Sober</a>, the brilliant and underrated 1988 film starring Michael Keaton.

5422974,5,B00AF6B22E,"In many ways, this story is ripped from headline news stories.  You cannot help but think of so many public figures who have failed us and inspired us:  Tiger Woods, Lance Armstrong, Mark McGuire, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Bill Clinton, Oscar Pistorius.  The list goes on.  By stepping into the public spotlight, it exposed their brilliance and their flaws.  We held them up to a higher standard because we believed.  We found in the end they were just like the rest of us.  They were human.

I gave this film a chance because I wondered what the director Bob Zemeckis was up to after having his motion capture studio shut down by Disney after making several mediocre movies that underperformed at the box office.  I once believed that Zemeckis was a master storyteller who could do no wrong:  Back to the Future, Castaway, Forrest Gump, even the okay films like What Lies Beneath and Who Framed Roger Rabbit had appealing stories.

After seeing this story unfold on screen, it's clear that very few directors can hold a candle to Zemeckis.  This is a story about redemption.  How you have to lose everything to reclaim your soul.  How you pay for your sins in ways you don't ever expect or imagine.  It is a heartfelt journey that is impossible to look away from.

Denzel Washington is in top form.  If you saw his performance in Man on Fire as a bodyguard with an alcohol problem or his Oscar winning role in Training Day, you see how this actor has matured and grown.  It is one of the greatest performances in recent memory.  This is a brilliant, earnest performance.

The movie is not perfect.  John Goodman kicks the doors in and in many ways, his comic performance takes us out of the story.  It's distracting unlike his performance in Argo where he stole the show.  At times, it is too much.  Don Cheadle is excellent and understated as a smart union lawyer.  The actor in the stairwell playing a cancer patient is amazing.  The apex of the film happens at the hearing.  I only wish it was a close up on Denzel's face when he says ""God Help Me.""

I also think some of the characters are underdeveloped.  The NTSB interrogator does not seem scary enough.  Please see a movie called The Verdict with Paul Newman and see how they created a demon with James Mason in only a few scenes.  I wish they showed a close up of her at the plane wreckage scene.  Also, I got lost with who the pretty woman was in the hotel.  Was she the same character as the stewardess on the doomed flight?

On another note, I think it is time someone tells the director that showing women with ample assets is an immature choice.  Did anyone see the scene in Beowulf where the barmaid is scantily clad?  It was embarrassing to watch it with my pre teen son.  Same sort of feeling with the opening scene.  You get the feeling that the actress is preening for the camera.  Why the angle with her chest in the opening shot?  Doesn't the director know how distracting this choice is for the audience?  Please make the same choices with showing less at times and more at other moments.

There was a scene of intimacy between the pilot and his new found love.  Please see Monster's Ball and how honest and true it was when Halle Berry let her guard down.  Flight leaves us short changed emotionally as these two consenting adults find an emotional connection.

It is worth a look.  Give it a chance",1360972800,,3376,4.487644151565074

5422981,2,B00AF6B22E,"People now tend to laugh at 1950s movies like Reefer Madness made with a reformers zeal for impressing on young people the horrors of drug addiction. But this movie is not far from that sort of mentality. Only its unlikely that Flight will ever achieve the status of being campy. Its preaching is too self-conscious. It takes a certain innocent obliviousness to produce a movie like Reefer Madness that becomes camp.

Here the airplane pilot, played by Denzel Washington, anguishes over the fact that he was drunk and high when he maneuvered his defective airplane to a landing. So the film, intent on sending a message, sends a mixed one. The viewer is supposed to deplore the fact that Washington habitually flew his plane with at least a buzz on  and yet much of Washingtons skill seems to stem from his mind-altering indulgences.

The film devolves into a commercial for AA, with a heavy dose of religiosity thrown in. When Washington wishes someone a good day, he is primly corrected. No, have a blessed day, comes the reproach. Washington, and by proxy, the audience, is made to pause to supposedly find some real meaning in this rebuke.

The point of the film is not, as I thought, to take us through a crash scene investigation. The point becomes to pilot Washington into a 12-step program where he is chastened into proclaiming a mea culpa and where he is made to atone  for exactly what were not sure.

If you want a real movie about the investigation of a plane crash to determine whether the pilots drinking was at fault, or whether there was some other cause of the accident, I suggest you check out the 1960s classic Fate is the Hunter.

5422985,5,B00AF6B22E,"This is a powerful movie about a man you to want to love's struggle with alcoholism, he just happened to be in a plane crash. This is not a courtroom drama, not an action flick (the plane crash happens in the first 30 min of the movie and lasts maybe 5-10 minutes tops, after that all drama.

The movie starts out with an epic plane crash scene, one of the best I've ever seen in a movie. Denzel's character takes control of the plane like a pro, with every ounce of drug and alcohol seemingly vaporized from his system and his instincts as an ex-Navy fighter pilot take over.

The movie is great in it has you rooting for this guy throughout, but he keeps letting you down as the viewer, as well as all of the characters in his life. You saw how awesome this guy was in the cockpit, he was a hero, yet he cannot overcome this addiction. How can a man who could do such extraordinary things be so vulnerable to addiction? The movie does this part very well.

Well it's the flight gone to hell and the extraordinary action that takes place as a pilot does something that not one other pilot is later able to duplicate in a simulator.  Yes, this pilot is just that good, as is the knuckle-whitening action of this part of the movie.  5 stars for the flight scenes.  This is what had me purchasing the movie instead of just renting it or getting it from the library.  I fully expected that I'd be watching this movie again in the future.

What we aren't told just from watching the trailer is that more than the flight, this movie is about a man with a serious alcohol addiction and his ability, for the most part, to function while drunk.  As a matter of fact, this aspect is the bulk of the movie.  Denzel Washington once again does an incredible job and not just because he stumbles around drunk on occasion.  We get to know a man who is a very flawed hero as we witness his complete denial about his problem,  Much of the movie has you  disgusted with this person, amazed at the quantity he drinks as well as hopeful that he'll beat his addiction.  It's difficult to watch him mess up time and time again as different people in his life try to help him.  5 stars for the acting.

But it's a very difficult movie to sit through.  Worth it?  Yes.  Could I have said that 3/4 of the way through the movie?  No.  The ending isn't what I expected, but we do get some closure and I liked the movie more because of it.  Would I want to watch it a second time a few months from now?  I don't believe so.

To sum it up, I think my boyfriend said it best, ""Its the little things"" in this movie that make it good, the little details Robert Zemeckis puts throughout the movie that really set it apart.

5422996,1,B00AF6B22E,"This movie had unnecessary nudity, drinking, smoking, up-close drug use, and numerous uses of the f-word, and that was just the first 5 minutes. There was PROLIFIC use of the f-word (52, according to imdb) and lots of other foul language.

There were about 10 minutes of exciting flying in the plane, and the rest of the 2 hour 13 minute movie was an utter waste of time. Most of the story dealt with what a drunk and drug user Denzel's character was, and in the last 10 minutes or so there was a lame redemption of sorts that didn't make much sense. My husband and I looked at each other like, ""THAT's what we watched this whole stinking movie for?""

There was close-up nudity, close-up use of cocaine and heroine, tons of totally unnecessary cussing, and general depravity during almost the whole movie. If you enjoy that kind of stuff, then rent this movie. If, however, you thought this was going to be an uplifting movie that lived up to the standards you thought Denzel Washington usually upheld, don't waste your time. There is no way I would watch this movie again, even if it was free. I felt like I needed to wash out my brain.

In addition to the ""redemption"" moment at the end being ""too little, too late"", it didn't make any sense when you considered the rest of the story. The main character was a drunk who used cocaine to ""get himself straight"" enough to fly while he was still drunk. He partied all night with a woman who apparently meant nothing to him, based on the fact that he took the news of her death with no emotion and quickly moved on to another. He lied throughout the whole movie and at the NTSB hearing about being an alcoholic, and about being drunk and high when he flew that flight. He lied about knowing the woman outside of work.

*SPOILER* Then he was asked a question to which he didn't even have to lie, a question that would decide his fate - heroism or jail. The question was, ""In your opinion, did Katerina Marquez (the flight attendant with whom he partied, who died in the crash) drink those two bottles of vodka (that were found in the plane's trash)?""

He's a liar. He is, in his own words, very good at it. He's the pilot who flew a horribly difficult flight that ended in a crash, so he was more than a little busy. He didn't even have to lie in this instance. Here are a few possible answers (in addition to the ""I don't recall"" that his lawyer fed him before the hearing): ""I have no idea."" ""I'm the pilot, not a stewardess. I don't know what Ms. Marquez was drinking."" ""I didn't see her much during the flight."" ""I really had my hands full with flying a damaged plane.""

In addition, while he was taking sips of water and asking to have the question repeated four times, surely his bulldog of a lawyer would have objected to their asking the pilot if, ""in his opinion"", a flight attendant drank any vodka.

In the end, this drunk liar chose to say that he drank the vodka? I don't buy it. And I certainly wouldn't buy this movie.",1360886400,10,2979,4.366425992779783

5423006,4,B00AF6B22E,"Right out of the gate, I believe that the screenwriter did an excellent job here.  The dialog is very believable, and funny, throughout appropriate parts of ""Flight.""  There is a scene in a stairwell at a hospital -- after the crash -- that involves Denzel Washington, Kelly Reilley, and some guy (I don't know his name) who has cancer.  Now, the cancer part surely isn't funny, but the cancer patient's dialog is hilarious.  As a matter of fact, I was cackling for the majority of the film.

Personally, I feel that this is Mr. Washington's finest performance to date.  He is a very flawed protagonist in this film, but he's simultaneously also very sympathetic.  I would imagine that this is a tricky role to pull off as an actor, as you most likely walk a very fine line trying to pull this off.  But he is excellent.  Throughout, I was really pulling for his character, and I believe that he and the director did a great job in this respect.

Even Don Cheadle is really good.  I've been a little hit and miss with him, as I feel that many times, his characters come off as a little preachy to me.  It's not necessarily him per se; it's strictly the roles that he has chosen in his career.  Now, he's a little straight-laced once again in this role, but there is a comic scene in the third act (let's just say that Nancy Reagan would be rolling her eyes) where Mr. Cheadle lightens up a bit, and I had a really good laugh.

But naturally, this is supposed to be a somewhat serious film as well dealing with serious subjects.  The film doesn't get too preachy; it allows the viewer to make up his or her own mind on some of these issues.  That is a big plus.  And for the film overall, this would be a pretty big recommendation by me.",1360800000,,1736,4.341614906832298

5423036,5,B00AF6B22E,"Spoiler alert! This movie is not about an airplane crash, although one takes place early on in the film. Flight is about the extraordinary pilot who, despite being very drunk, performs a crash landing that saves nearly all onboard. I found the character as written to be real--I have known ""functioning alcoholics"", and nothing here seems exagerrated. Denzel Washington plays this guy perfectly. The story explores the character's flight from truth--his failure as a husband and father, his failure to acknowledge his addiction, his failure to live with any sense of integrity. Stories about alcoholism and addiction are hard to watch, especially if the character has great talent. This one approaches classic Greek tragedy. Is Washington's pilot a hero? Yes, but, without giving any more of the plot away, his heroism has nothing to do with flying an airplane. Flight is Zemeckis' most adult film to date, a film about grownups to be viewed by grownups. When you consider his body of work (Roger Rabbit, Back to the Future, Romancing the Stone, Forest Gump, Contact, Cast Away...all good, some great), this film is a pretty significant departure. I think it is also the best thing he has done.",1360713600,,1194,5.0353535353535355

An even slightly intoxicated pilot would not be able to fly or function in the cockpit,
no matter if that's a small or a big airplane, and it would not be possible to hide an
intoxication or an addiction to alcohol or other substances from other flight personal.

I like Denzel Washington as an actor, and I am surprised that he accepted to play
in such a badly researched movie.

There was about 15 minutes of excitement in the air, and you saw a teaser of what it was marketed to be. Then it turns into a very depressing movie about the Pilot of the plane played by Denzel, being addicted to several substances, and his character in question. The music was boring, the subject was done too many times before, just different addicted guy in a different job.

We see the debauchery before the flight, the flight and crash, the modest self-loathing and self-destruction, and denial, denial, denial. ""Yawn"" Better movies have been made about addiction, this one has a great soundtrack though, so it got 3 stars.

Mediocre story telling. A tired, recycled plot about addiction starring, men, yet again. The usual female roles as love/sex interest, angry ex lover, and a sprinkling of female nudity for those who cannot watch a film about men without questioning their heterosexuality.

The film doesn't ever feel deep or engrossing. While it is still watchable, that's all it really is. If you remove the soundtrack the movie loses a star.

There is nothing new here. Nothing gritty or truly moving. I failed to ever feel much for the characters. It's truly just another recycled story, average plot, average directing and acting. After the taught flight/crash sequence the movie loses altitude quickly, pun intended.

The film is about a ""functioning junkie"" who when given the chance to save himself... chooses instead to throw his body on a grenade. What a glorious feeling it is to KNOW you had the courage to do the right thing even though it means you'll get punished for it.

As for the title, unless those involved want to imply it's Denzel's flight from responsible behavior, it's really just a con job. The love story is shoe-horned into the plot, likewise the gratuitous nudity, the ridiculous presentation of people with faith is an eye-roller, the John Goodman character is from another type of film and the addiction scenes we've seen in other, better films. And don't get me started on the unlocked connecting hotel doors! And how did the filmmakers manage to lose the audience's sympathy for Denzel's character?

I do not know, perhaps other movies have dealt with the subject or perhaps not. I guess it is an important topic to address and Washington being an airline captain puts emphasis on the danger.

It makes me wonder what dark secrets are hiding in Zemeckis' and/or star/producer Denzel Washington's closet that they felt compelled to make this film.

I was a little disappointed in this film because it wasn't what I thought it would be. As a film that showed a man descending toward his own ""bottom"", still unwilling to accept his addictions even after a plane he pilots crashes and kills 4 people, I found it difficult to identify with the Denzel Washington character. This is more unusual than one would imagine, as I am in recovery for 16 years myself and have heard many different stories of despair and salvation in the rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.

Perhaps it was simply because I had never met a commercial airline pilot in recovery, or perhaps it was because I had long ago accepted that sobriety comes only to those who want it, but in all honesty for over 2 hours I couldn't figure out what Zemeckis was trying to say with the film. In retrospect, I now do and can appreciate the message much better.

As far as films about addiction and recovery are concerned, I was much more affected by the 1988 film ""Clean and Sober"", but Washington's performance here is excellent.

5423140,2,B00AF6B22E,"I often think big-budget Hollywood movies fail to meet their potential. Considering the millions of dollars invested to produce a film, the hundreds of people employed, the endless weeks, months, years of revising the script, I guess when I press play I expect something pretty spectacular. But like a lot of movies I see, Flight left me wondering why it wasn't.

Nothing wrong with the subject matter really. Of course alcoholism is something that touches the lives of a lot of people. The problem is that any film that dares to tackle this kind of story has a pretty impressive act to follow: The Days of Wine and Roses, Leaving Las Vegas, Factotum -- just a few of the better films about alcoholism that come to mind. I would think a new release would at least attempt to meet the bar set by these earlier examples. Unfortunately, Flight seems perfectly content with its more shallow treatment of the topic.

Actually I think this film would have fared better if alcoholism had been left out of the picture completely. The flight trauma scenes in the beginning are top-notch Hollywood movie making, and are strong enough that I think the entire film could have taken place inside that plane (Airport 1975?). Instead, Flight uses a plane crash early on to simply set the stage for the rest of the story, which in its own way seems chaotic and out of control.

A good example of this is the character Harling Mays (John Goodman), an overly-comical, overly-stereotyped drug dealer straight off the pages of a Quentin Tarantino script. It's a horribly awkward transition whenever Goodman enters a scene, and makes me think that Flight was probably rushed through production without much thought about what really makes sense in the movie, and what doesn't.

Can't knock the performance by Denzel Washington, though. I think he's a stunning actor who can make even the most unbearable movies somehow worth watching. I hope movie lovers are familiar with his better films -- The Book of Eli, Malcolm X, The Hurricane.",1360627200,9,2014,4.84593023255814

Denzel gives a good performance, pulling off yet another character that is outside the typical type for him.

I want my money and time back, I purchased this movie thinking it was going to be a thriller/ mystery which the back states ""nail-biting thriller... No way, I would rather watch Scooby Doo..

The nude scene was pure trash and uncalled for. There was no need to have a scene so distasteful. There was no need for the all the bad language, over kill on the drugs and alcohol use. Story line/plot the dots did not connect.

Yes pilot's who drink are a problem, but I would rather see a solution focused movie on how to solve that problem than one that shows the nude, drug etc.. Pilots drinking and using drugs is a real problem. And this happens in real life, nothing to play with.

Addiction is real, and nothing to play with, yes this shows what an addict looks like, goes through, etc. However I would have rather have seen something more tasteful. Denzel performance was great as usual, which is the reason we purchased the movie as it has a great cast.

I tried to give this movie to a family member and they told me no thanks.

Denzel is one of my favorite actors and we own most of his movies. We liked him in out of time, unstoppable, the good movies.

Denzel don't lower your standards for a movie roll, you are top quality keep it that way. This was way different, we understand the addiction, but the nude scene was distasteful. Keep it classy and not trashy.

Would not want to leave a movie like this behind for generations to see. Legacy is everything.

We should have purchased Taken 2, Skyfall, Avengers, etc.

Yes the movie has rated R on the back, many movies do, but the content is not like this.

This isn't an action movie, though there is some action during the ""Flight"" that gives the movie its name.  This isn't really a movie about flight, though, or at some level even about a pilot - while that element gives the movie its dramatic tension, it could be about anyone.  Almost all of the movie happens while the lead character is grounded, after the crash.

Flight is a good movie with a very good performance by Denzel Washington.  If you go in expecting a realistic movie about alcoholism and addiction, with an often wrenching story, you'll be better able to appreciate the movie for what it is - rather than being surprised at what it is not.",1360540800,,796,4.570422535211268

5423174,2,B00AF6B22E,"The plot device, that a staggeringly intoxicated man can perform some outstanding feats in an emergency, doesn't do much to move the plot beyond the first few scenes. It poses the question, can he do the right thing?  Well, he's seriously endangered people's lives on the road and in the air for years, but so long as he gets clean, that's what's important right? So the main character concludes at the end of the film. The main character is intensely alcoholic. And where can this film go? Either he fesses up at the end or he doesn't. This is Hollywood; he does. Of course, due in no small part to the chronic alcohol and cocaine abuse, the character doesn't have much left to lose by the time he confesses but maybe we are meant sympathize with his realization of just what a moral crud he has been. So after the first few scenes the movie, limps towards its obvious conclusion. Washington does a decent job of appearing like an alcoholic that maintains rather well at very high blood alcohol levels -- thanks in part, supposedly, to prodigious applications of cocaine.

If you like Washington, you might enjoy the film. But for many, it will be a bit of a slog. Ray Milland's ""Lost Weekend"" wasn't any more accurate but it was more involving.",1360540800,14,1246,4.582959641255606

It wasn't just the nudity-it was shot deliberately for the erotic value and totally exploitive-more exploitive than some scenes I've seen in movies in which there was more sexual content...

Anyway, another lame excuse of an ad for 12 step programs for alchoholics, the same old tired and shaming/blaming idea that the alchoholic has to hit bottom yada yada all the while the sucess rate of AA is shockingly low and many of it's ideas harmful particularly to those who have endured any kind of abuse....for some people it works, but c'mon stop showing these idealized 'everything is great now' easy outcomes...you know, the old 'it's all my FAULT and I'm a bad person but now I'm in AA and my life is so GREAT' cliches......

Now many reviewers are not happy at all with what this movie, I suppose because the trailer leads one to believe it's an action packed movie and just that.  Well, there was the plane sequence and it was lively alright.  But the movie turns out really not to be about landing a plane expertly at all.  It's focus is about drug and alcohol addiction and how it affects your life and the ends people will go to to maintain an appearance of a normal life, and some pull it off pretty darn well, as was the case here.  I was not mad or bothered by the fact that the movie took a different turn than I expected.  Fact is, anymore, I don't really have an expectation that I know what a movie is going to be about, as trailers are really good at fooling you and leading you on.  So, if I like the leading actor or actress, and I like the general type of movie, (action,  adventure, etc)  then I roll the dice once in a while.
As far as getting upset about the nudity in this picture,  all I can say is where there are drugs, alcohol, and a general out of control lifestyle, there is going to be sex.  It was not overly focused on, in my opinion,  that's just the real world, why sugar coat it.  I will say, I like the fact that in the end, the pilot confesses that he was drunk and had been for a long time, and made the decision to tell the truth instead of having it end with a slick lie and sliding out of it.  Some would probably have preferred that ending, and in reality it would be possible.  Well I don't want to go on and wax philosophical about all of this, but it was an Ok movie and that's it.",1360454400,,1740,4.02332361516035
5423196,4,B00AF6B22E,"After reading a few reviews on ""Flight"" I was hesitant to rent it for fear of expecting the worse, which means falling into a ""this movie isn't good"" spell of other's reviews. Without going in any depth of the story (I believe they would call it spoilers) I would just speak of why I thought the movie a good Denzel Washington flick. His work in this film mirrors his performance in ""Training Day"", meaning someone whom you like and dislike all in the same 2 hours. His character being someone who is lead around the story by his demons and that struggle is felt through the TV screen as good acting does. When thinking about the movie as a whole - that struggle stands out the strongest in the film even though this movie is filled with notable actors.

5423203,2,B00AF6B22E,"In Flight, Denzel Washington plays boozer alcoholic jet pilot Whip Whitaker who is always living on the edge of disaster. Frequently before flights, he drinks himself into oblivion, then snorts lines of cocaine to get himself in shape to fly. This occurs sometimes less than an hour before taking the lives of his crew and passengers into his hands.

In the opening minutes of the film, Whip's routine jet flight takes a turn for the deadly when his plane carrying 102 passengers experiences a mechanical failure which causes it to nosedive towards the ground. Making an unorthodox and risky aerial manuever, Whip is able to crashland the plane with minmal loss of life. Of course, after the accident, a NTSB investigation team arrives and one of the first things they find is that Whip's blood shows that he was intoxicated and high on cocaine at the time of the crash. Suffice it to say, things don't look good for Whip.

Flight asks a great question of the viewer. Should Whip get out of his predicament because he saved the lives of almost all of his passengers and crew, or should he be punished for his substance abuse? It's a tough question, and it's one that Denzel's character wrestles with most of the movie. I mean, yeah, he might be able to beat the charges and walk away a hero, but then again, if he gets off, eventually his boozing and drugging are going to get people killed. It's just a matter of time. It's an age old question really. Does one heroic act make up for criminal behavior. Should he be forgiven? Should he be able to beat the system. Does his saving of 96 lives make up for the fact that over his career, he has put thousands if not tens of thousands of lives at risk? The more I think about it, to me the answer is NO.

Denzel Washington has been nominated for Best Actor for his role as Whip, and I would have to say he might win it, because the Academy has a soft spot for roles portraying drug addicts and the mentally and physically disabled. But he's gonna face stiff competition in the form of Daniel Day Lewis, who I predict will ultimately win the award. The problem with Flight is that too often when Denzel gets drunk in this movie, it almost comes off as comedy or even a parody of alcoholism. It isn't helped by John Goodman's farcical take on a drug supplier that makes the audience laugh. Some people say it's not pleasant to be around a drunk. I would codify that more. It's ANNOYING. They get on your nerves. Everytime Whip got wasted in Flight, I was like rolling my eyes and muttering ""OMG, do I have to see this AGAIN!"". When you see him fall into a coffee table, instead of being horrified, it strikes you as akin to a Saturday Night Live sketch.

There's also an underlying religious theme at work in Flight as well. Time and again we are reminded that God Himself is making this movie happen. That God caused the deaths of the innocent people on the plane just so Whip could be taught a lesson. That part came off as so much hogwash. That God would allow people to die just so a drunk scumbag could see the truth of his life. Ugh.

It was nice to see Bob Zemeckis try his hand again at live action moviemaking instead of his bizarre and disturbing experimentation with performance capture, which I feel had driven him to a 10 year dead end. He's like George Lucas, but to an even worse extreme. But unlike George, I feel that Bob could return to making good movies if he tried. Much like Ridley Scott's return to sci-fi in the gloriously flawed Prometheus, I think Bob is rusty at doing what he used to be one of the best at. Here's hoping his next film will be better.",1360454400,,3623,4.409566517189836

The promos gave the impression that this movie was more about the flight itself and not so much that he was a womanizing, alcohol and cocaine addict.  We thought that the possibility that he might have had a drink or three the day before the flight MIGHT have been the cause of the crash but the mechanical investigation was secondary to his being a full-fledged addict.

The part played by John Goodman glamorized drug dealers.  He played it well, I laughed at him, he was a fun drug dealer.  But that's not reality.",1360454400,,676,4.735042735042735

5423214,4,B00AF6B22E,"Being a pilot and former air traffic controller, I was looking forward to an all-too-rare, technically accurate, and well-executed drama/mystery about an air disaster.  However, ""Flight"" is more of a study an addict (who happens to be an airline pilot) and the way he eventually deals with his addiction.  The air disaster is almost incidental to the overall story and could have been replaced by any set of circumstances portraying an addict who is directly responsible for lives of the public.  I was not very happy with the ultimate cause of the aircraft's crash, either.  My feeling was that the cause of the crash was too 'pat' and  didn't lend as much drama to the film's conclusion as it could have. (I won't say any more so as not to spoil the film for those who haven't seen it.) Those are my personal disappointments with the film, but most others who watch the film may not be looking for techno-drama as I was and may find the film very enjoyable.

A truly real topic and it just shows that no matter how ""right"" you were in the time of crisis, even saving hundreds of lives in the process - you can still be very wrong as well.

That is the focus of this movie the humanity of Denzel's characters situation.  He did an amazing job staying calm, and never panicking like the co-pilot.  His level of experience and gut instinct about all aspects of how an aircraft works, the physics of aerodynamics, etc. These skills he possessed saved nearly all of the lives on his flight, but he was totally wrong at the core.

Very moving, and something really to think about not only regarding Pilots, but all professionals in charge with the care of safety of other people's lives.

Highly recommended!",1360368000,,309,4.7924528301886795
5423243,4,B00AF6B22E,"""Flight"" is about Denzel Washington, the actor who has taken chances, proved himself worthy, and now accepts all kinds of roles. Playing an alcoholic and becoming that person convincingly highlights once again Denzel's exceptional talent. I've always been a fan.

That said, I must include in my positive things these negatives:
1. I don't like it one bit that he is showing signs of aging. He can't help it, none of us can, but I want to remember him as that beautiful man he was when he was young. I am being totally unreasonable, but there it is.
2. My biggest objection is also questionable. In my memory Denzel has never had a relationship onscreen with a white woman. He does this time. She is also half his age, but then again, her race and age are irrelevant to the arrogant, obnoxious dude he plays. Being a player is part of who he is only as it reflects his addictions to both drugs and alcohol. In a movie from his younger years he plays a sheriff in Haiti who has a brief affair with a white woman. The test audience, or the black women in that audience, were incensed and the film maker changed that part of the film to a black woman. I think, here in this film, he had to break with his tradition because that is what his character would have done. So, I guess I say kudos now.
3. I did not realize the film was about addiction. Not my favorite subject. A personal dislike. Also unfair to the film.

What I did like about the film:
1. Denzel's acting. He is completely convincing as an addict. Completely.
2. The addiction is dealt with in a fair way.
3. Two lines are memorable and will be repeated as such: He tells his paramour: ""I chose to drink. I chose to drink"" even in face of losing each person in turn in his life. Bravado, false. Braggadocio, false. But still a line memorably shouted. The second line almost makes hair stand up on one's arms: ""Who are you?"" To give it in context would be a spoiler, so I'll leave it at that.

This is a review about Denzel, my man. Others have written excellent reviews about theme and events. I'll stick with Denzel because he does redemption like no other.

Oh yes, the title. It's obvious: a flight goes down. However, the pilot, loaded on drugs and alcohol, miraculously lands it. He's a hero, but not a hero. What takes flight is the symbolism behind the title. Flight. Flying. Freedom. Yeah.",1360368000,4,2358,4.413793103448276

Outside of that, Denzel once again proves himself a five star actor.  He does an outstanding job of portraying a drug and alcohol addict out of control, yet still can be functional enough in an emergency.

5423257,5,B00AF6B22E,"Like many fellow reviewers, I was expecting FLIGHT to be more of an action-oriented examination of the plane crash.  It ultimately is a story of addiction, denial, loss and redemption.
Director Robert Zemeckis artfully guides a powerhouse cast in an uncompromising portrait of a man refusing to admit his addiction, regardless of the collateral damage.  Oscar winning Denzel Washington is deservedly nominated again this year for his stunning portrayal of Whip, a pilot who miraculously crash lands his plane, saving 96 people but losing 6.  He is a hero until evidence emerges he was drinking and using cocaine the morning of the disaster.  Washington shoulders the weight of the film and gives perhaps his best performance in a totally controlled portrait of the addicted pilot.
The opening crash scene is brilliantly executed and disturbing.  Denzel is surrounded by a stellar supporting cast---Don Cheadle. John Goodman, Bruce Greenwood, Brian Geraghty, Melissa Leo and the underappreciated Tamara Tunie (Law and Order SVU's Dr. Warner).  I liked Kelly Reilly as fellow addict Nicole, but often had trouble understanding her which diminished my appreciation of her performance.
I highly recommend FLIGHT mainly on the basis of Washington's devastating performance.  He probably will lose the Oscar to Daniel Day Lewis, but his nomination cements him as one of cinema's best actors.",1360281600,2,1385,5.3842592592592595

Given the ""assumed"" plot, with the upside down plane (I am a 12 year AF vet) and making Denzel Washington (whip)a hero was my kind of movie. I have loved everything Denzel has been in, and with a supporting cast of John Goodman playing a part he was born to play and with Don Cheadle how could I go wrong. I hate slow dull movies, overly sentimental love stories(which this was not), and movies like this one that don't end with the HERO coming up on top. That being said, when I watched the ending twice, the movie had to be what it was, to bestow true HERO status on ""Whip"" and the inner strength he found. Great movie,highlighting the horrible effects of drugs and alcohol, the refusal of help and endearing love, and clearly showing the weakness in ""man"" as he struggles to get free from his downward spiro. Watch it, buy it re-watch it, and share it with your friends. MAYBE someone with a weakness or character flaw might see themselves in Whip and learn to `FLY RIGHT"". A full 4.5 star movie, but Amazon does not allow 4.5's and I only give 5.0's to true epics.",1360281600,2,1133,4.374407582938389

Since that stuff does not bother me, I had no issue with it in the movie. Most of the plot has been rehashed in other reviews so I will not do that here. Whip was not an easy guy to like he was arrogant and so full of his own importance that he failed to see his life imploding around him. Therefore, it was only a matter of time until he screwed-up so seriously that it would all come crashing down around him- which it did an amazing fashion. At first, when he knew the jig was up and was still refusing to accept responsibility for his actions, I admit, I wanted to throw something at the tv. However,as I watched on and saw the transformation, the moment he finally ""got it"", I knew this movie would stick with me long after the credits stopped rolling. While I could not give it five stars because of some of the more contrived plot elements, in the end this movie had some positive messages. It is reminder that our lives can always be turned around as long as we are willing to accept responsibility not only for our actions, but the need to change our lives into something we want it to be.

The problem with that is that you wind up hating his character even though it is a superb acting performance.

The rest of the cast performed well and were believable.  (Well, John Goodman was a little over the top, but his character was likable.)

Which is really odd, considering that it states something very poignant early on: Is it better that he was able to save so many lives that virtually no one else could have even due to his dependence with drugs, or does that make everyone worse off?

5423278,3,B00AF6B22E,"FLIGHT has an A-list cast and direction in a C-list story. I understand why so many people had such mixed reaction to this film in the theaters. Here is one of the best action footage of an airplane in trouble over a rather dreary and mundane story. The action happens early in the film and then the adventure fizzles.

We know from the beginning that Pilot Whip Whitaker, played wonderfully by the great Denzel Washington, has a drinking and drug abuse problem. He knows how to fake ""sober"" as he gets into the cockpit of his plane but the signs are clear. While into the flight, the plane is struck by mechanical failure and certain doom is on the horizon. The few minutes of a flight in peril were amazing and spellbinding. This is filmmaking at its best as it grabs the attention of the audience and we feel the peril.

Whitaker performs the miraculous and saves the plane with only 4 lives lost. He becomes an instant hero having saved the majority of the occupants from certain death. Here we have the fascinating moral twist of the story. Whitaker is legally drunk while at the helm of the plane. Here is the moral conundrum. Despite being intoxicated, it appears that Whitaker is the only pilot on earth who could have saved the plane from a deadly crash and a total loss of life. It is thought provoking situation to consider as the NTSB investigation begins. Here the promise of the story is muddled in a stream of predictable cliches. Whitaker begins a romance with a drug addict on her way to being recovery while he decends further into the depths of his hell. The story becomes so tedious and so predictable that all interest is lost.

Don Cheadle has a understated role as the pilot union attorney eager to keep Whitaker ""clean"" and ready for the investigation. While Cheadle is understated, add in John Goodman in a flamboyant roll as the drug dealer. So many talented actors in a mediocre film.

The light of the film returns near the end of the film as Washington gives his all to Whitaker. Finally, we see why Denzel Washington is one of America's top actors. Will there be redemption? There is a great twist to the story that finally adds credibility to the story.

FLIGHT is a film that excels at the beginning and at the end--everything in between is the low point. So much potential was missed in what could have been a great film.",1360195200,4,2354,4.5424528301886795

Whether or not that was the intent of identifying the process of addiction or not, it made for a grim movie start to finish. The acting was okay, but story so narrow that there wasn't much room for a more multi-layered character piece. Goodman's overt over-the-topness was just plain getting-on-your-nerves'ness.

In the movie Pelham 123, Denzel played the ""good guy"" - an amazing role, but John Travolta's use of the ""F"" word in every sentence killed the movie in my opinion.  Again in ""Pelham,"" I believe Denzel did an amazing job with his role of acting.  In the movie ""Flight,"" even though Denzel owns up to his addictions and his faults, attributing to a ""righteous end"" to the film - I still hold this movie at the bottom of the stack of what I've come to expect from Denzel.  If you're going to watch this movie hoping to see the Denzel from ""Book of Eli,"" ""Remember the Titans,"" ""Man on Fire,"" or ""Safe House"" - I think you'll be let down, as I was.

I suspect the same cost benefit analysis may apply to the airline industry.
As many have noted, the gratuitous sex was really unnecessary.  Denzel deserves high marks for acting in a difficult role.  I know characters like John Goodman exist, but  . . . I have always purposely avoided them in real life.

Also, strains the credibility factor.  A man who refuses to admit his addiction is unlikely to do so when he has the most to lose. It actually seemed a tad clich. Even though the plane crashes, it is not due to pilot error. Nicole's (the woman Washington 's character meets in the hospital) struggle to overcome addiction seems like a far more interesting story.

I saw a review describing this as Washington's least sympathetic role to date.  Nope, that was, ""Training Day."" It still boggles the mind that he received an Oscar for THAT performance.

Didn't anyone else wonder about this through the whole film? It's never addressed!

Second ... oh, this is totally politically incorrect, maybe one of those things you might think but not say, but in no way suggests that flying or driving drunk is EVER a good idea ... I feel like this question hangs unanswered over the film ... am I the only one who wondered if it was his very lack of inhibition -- which one often sees in people with a buzz on -- that allowed him to take the crazy risks and make the wild maneuvers that kept the crash from being much worse? Ten sober, careful pilots couldn't recreate what he did in a simulator. Maybe this sounds crazy, but I waited through the whole movie for one of the characters to wonder about that.

5423302,4,B00AF6B22E,"FLIGHT is a film that attracts devotees of Denzel Washington - and for good reason because he gives a convincing performance as a conflicted alcoholic cocaine addict who despite the fact that he wastes most of his life and relationships with his substance abuse, he still is one of the finest pilots in the air. And if that is the reason for watching his overly long attenuated movie then the rewards will be there.

The story as written by John Gatins and directed by Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Back to the Future etc) begins correctly enough with a wasted Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) still drunk and drug addled with his flight attendant girlfriend Trina (Nadine Velazquez) interrupted by a telephone call form Whips ex-wife requesting tuition, money for their son. The two snort cocaine to get going from their hangovers and they are off to a flight to Atlanta.  Once aboard Whip's instability is noted by his anxious new co-pilot Ken (Brian Geraghty) but despite poor weather the flight takes off only to crash a bit later: Whip manages to pull it together enough to bring the airplane down in a field losing only six people in the crash (one being Trina).  The rest of the film is an endless diatribe of Whip recovering, getting control of his substance abuse only to repeatedly lose if again, meeting a pretty junkie Nicole (Kelly Reilly in a stand out role) who becomes his lover, meeting a terminal cancer patient Tiki (Charlie E. Schmidt), being counseled by his best friend Charlie (Bruce Greenwood) who brings in a lawyer Hugh (Don Cheadle) to attempt to coverup the fact that the investigation of the crash has shown that Whip was impaired by his excesses. A `resource' Harling Mays (John Goodman) keeps Whip supplied with drugs up to the last moment and it is only at the hearing (finally) that Whip confesses to investigator Ellen (Melissa Leo) that he was indeed drunk during the flight and in turn pays for the guilt with which he has been struggling in his semi-sober moments.

The cinematography during the airplane crash is excellent and the supporting cast is very strong, but despite Washington's performance the movie misses on so many levels due to incomplete working through of sidebar plot lines.  The salvation for the film is in the last five minutes of fine acting by Washington, but by that time the audience is very tired of the manner in which a gifted pilot has wasted his (and everyone else's around him) life that clock watching takes over.

At its heart it is about substance dependency. Washington plays a pilot who is  a functioning alcoholic and drug abuser. While high Washington heroically saves all but six ""souls on board"" of a commercial aircraft by executing a masterful controlled crash into  a Georgia field. That he was high may not have been a contributing factor to the loss of the aircraft.

So we go from action to soap as the captain and his representatives attempt to conceal his impairment from the NTSB. And herein lies the problem. The heroics are difficult to envision and the idea that good pilots can fly and even perform extraordinary feats while lit up is dangerous. Most airline pilots I know rigorously refrain from alcohol and other intoxicants from to taking command of an airplane. There have been pilots arrested for attempting to fly while intoxicated and those pilots have been turned in by a whole bevy of informants from initial security, to gate personnel to flight crew. This is how it should be and why I am glad this is fiction.",1360108800,,1473,6.0

The blurbs on the DVD box read ""a triumph"" (Richard Corliss, TIME), ""nothing short of a masterpiece"" (Jake Hamilton, KRTV/Fox), and so on. I thought, ""That's a good sign, but they can find people to say these things about virtually ANYthing."" In FLIGHT's case, however, I was not disappointed.

This is one of Washington's finest 2.3 hours as alcoholic/cokehead womanizing airline pilot ""Whip"" Whitaker. The entire film is painstakingly directed and detailed, and the near-catastrophe is every bit as riveting as the one in ALIVE. FLIGHT also painstakingly shows the dilemmas that Whitaker, the airline unions and investigation teams, and everyone else face: There are plenty of small but effective surprises here. Despite the repetitions, dragginess, and heavy-handed moralizing in the middle, FLIGHT remains a long film that goes by very quickly.

All that being said, the aforementioned middle portions descend way too far into a morality play/soap opera regarding Whitaker's frazzled life.

I had no idea I was in for such a wild ride. I will point out first and foremost that this is a very well put together piece of cinema. The acting, pacing, cinematography, character development is nothing short of top-notch. That being said, I can understand how marketing and trailers could have caused many people to become mislead to what the film would be covering as many of the negative reviewers seemed to have missed the point. This movie was about a plane crash in the way that The Shawshank Redemption was about escaping prison. Yes, those are both the  fundamental plot points but they're more like a side effect of the central themes. (Not to say that the crash scene in Flight wasn't one of the most intense scenes I'd seen in years or that the prison escape scene in Shawshank didn't give me an all encompassing feeling of joy). But in my humble opinion, a movie shouldn't be spelled out for you in the trailers. Too many films do that already (mainly comedies/action/romance). Instead you should go into a film with an open mind and see where it takes you. Without giving too much away, you may be pleasantly surprised, as I know I was.  This is the kind of film that makes you reflect on the choices you make. What you would do to save your reputation. How your words affect those around you. How your actions affect those you love. And how to find salvation when it feels like its impossible to grasp.",1360108800,213,1570,4.429065743944637
5423312,4,B00AF6B22E,"The title of ""Flight"" refers to much more than the flight and plane crash that changes Captain Whip Whitaker's (Denzel Washington in a much deserved Oscar nominated role)life.

SPOILERS:

Whip is in flight from everything in his life and has drowned himself in drugs and drink. Whitaker runs into mechanical trouble during a routine flight from Florida to Atlanta and the plane crashes but he manages to save the life of many of the passengers due to his skill as a pilot. Unfortunately, the NTSB investigation uncovers Whip's problem putting into question if he could have caused the crash himself.

While in the hospital recovering Whip meets Nicole (Kelly Rilley)a recovering drug addict that he becomes romantically involved with as his life continues to take a dive as severe as the plane crash he walked away from.

END OF SPOILERS:

The taunt direction of Robert Zemeckis adds to the power of John Gatins script which features well drawn characters giving the actors plenty of material to work with during the film.

The blu-ray looks marvelous--the transfer is sharp, filled with detail and nice, natural skin tones/color.

Audio sounds terrific as well with dialogue clear throughout even during the most active sequences.

We get four featurettes on the production of the film. The best piece is ""Anatomy of a Plane Crash"" that takes us behind the scenes on the stunning visual effects of the film and the on set physical effects that sell the sequence.

We also get a  question and answer session done after the film was screened featuring Gatins and Zemeckis.

It's a pity we don't get a commentary track for the film.

This edition includes a DVD with just the feature film.

Please note that ""Flight"" is rated ""R"" for nudity, language and drug use.

5423315,3,B00AF6B22E,"Flight(released Oct/12)stars Denzel Washington as William ""Whip"" Whitaker,John Goodman as Harling Mays,Don Cheadle as Hugh Lang,Bruce Greenwood as Charlie Anderson,and many others in this nice tight cast of acting veterans and new comers. The story starts out with a bang but the rest of the film is taken up with the protagonist wrestling with both inside and outside demons. I saw this film in theatres and I knew from the get go it would elicit a variety of reactions. On one level Washington is bringing in close to an OSCAR winning performance. On the other the story,as good as it seems,works against him throughout.
The story finds Denzel as a flight captain. The movie starts in a rather shocking manner as he wakes up beside,as it turns out,a good looking stewardess and snorts a line of cocaine. Off he goes to pilot a passenger plane,having some vodka and OJ along the way. Just before landing approach time,the plane runs into severe turbulence. Denzel takes the controls and the upshot is,through his amazing piloting skills,while the plane crashes in a field,only six lives are lost. Denzel lays in a hospital bed and is visited by the NTSB and his union rep. Also someone comes along(Goodman)who we at first think is quite the flamboyant friend,but turns out to be his go to drug connection. While there he meets up with a red head who also has been going through her own hell with booze and drugs.
Denzel meets with the union rep and their lawyer,then the airline boss. This sends Denzel into the deep end and again he is drinking like a fish. Drunk he seeks out the redheads apartment,who it happens,is just getting kicked out. He offers his residence to crash in and and they end up closerthanthis. The investigation starts getting hot and heavy which sends Denzel heading for more drink and drugs from his pusher. This also pushes his girl friend to the limit,who leaves. Denzel has an emotional meeting with his ex and his son,who doesn't really know or want to know his alcoholic father.
The union and their lawyer only can do so much,and a formal hearing is held. Time and again his union has tried to get him sober,and gets all the promises from Denzel,but he never fails to disappoint. This time,of all times,is no different. With the help of his pusher he is ""sobered"" up and attends the hearing. All Denzel has to do is lie,as he has all along,about whether or not he had been under the influence of any substances or drink that flight. His team is expecting a ""no"",but Denzel cannot take it any longer and says ""yes"".The ""hero"" pilot goes to jail. The film ends as a now sober Denzel,in the can,meets with his son and reconciles,apologizing for all the years of hurt and pain he has caused.
I found the opening scene with Denzel in bed,a little ""raw"" for my taste,but I could see what the director was aiming for as far as realism goes. Then comes the titled""flight"" and it is gripping. Afterwards,the emotional ride we just experienced starts to quickly wane as Denzel recovers,then slowly but surely the film shifts its focus from pilot hero,to a drug and booze soaked man with alot of inner demons. The fact that Denzel was one of only a few who could have done what he had done gets pushed aside as Denzel spirals ever downward. The rest of the film turns into a look at the sordid life and the extremes people in Denzel's state will go to to maintain their habit/addiction. Alongside this is his girlfriend who has gone through what he has experienced too,and we watch as she is able to overcome her problems,and Denzel sinks ever deeper. The pace never changes too much as we switch back and forth between watching Denzel abuse himself,to his on off relationship with the red head and to his legal problems. This,it seems,is the films real focus,the flight was just the catalyst for the events to come. And it is a long and windy road we go down;some of it interesting,but most I found a bit ponderous,with a been there,done that feel in so far as the addiction part goes. It was just dressed up prettier. This is an approximately 2 1/2 hr.film after all. As I said in the beginning I could see a lot of divergent opinions about this. Some will concentrate just on Denzels fine performance,while others will dislike it for its pace and length. Personally I am torn,as both sides have a point,and that is why I'm falling somewhere in the middle here.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all a good film but saddled with a terrible length and slow pace after the initial flight takes place. Denzel turns in a good performance but the film itself works against him,I thought, far too much. 3 1/2 stars.",1360022400,2,4706,4.630382775119617

(1) Miracle working by the unworthy. Denzel Washington plays an excellent if arrogant/clearly troubled pilot;

(2) God's will in the midst of tragedy.  There's a plane crash in the film in which some of the passengers clearly suffer a lot (and some die), while others suffer hardly at all.  How to make sense of that?; finally

(3) Can even a ""miracle worker"" earn his/her ""Salvation?"" Can being ""really good"" at something (like being a ""really good pilot..."") really be ""good enough"" to excuse/justify one's conduct/failings in other aspects of life?

All in all, this was a great movie. Absolutely riveting, particularly during the flight scene, you cannot look away from the screen. Denzel gives a great performance, though he'll never be my favorite actor. I find him very one-dimensional, always intense, broody, smug, cocky; but he did a fantastic job with this role, despite that. All of the acting in this movie is excellent, from the pitifully endearing addict, Nicole, to the loud-mouthed, bigger-than-life pusher played perfectly by John Goodman, to the heroic and selfless stewardesses on the plane, who risk their lives to help others without hesitation.

The first half of the movie revolves around the tremendous suspense and action sequence of the titular ""flight"", then the second half slows down a bit and focuses in on the characters, their struggles, their pain, their setbacks, and ultimately their redemption.

If the producers had skipped the aforementioned drug/sex/profanity, I would've given this 5 stars. You can tell a story without so graphically portraying these things. Show a man and woman closing to the door to the bedroom, you knew they were going to have sex, you didn't have to show anything. Show a drug addict contemplating a needle and then pan away; you know what they're about to do. Shoving the gritty, awful images into the audience's fact does not make the story better. Long gone are the ""classy"" methods of telling a hard-hitting drama tale, and it's a shame. We all know the realities of life and the world, the audience isn't ""learning"" anything by watching such scenes. But I digress.

My only other complaint is the painfully obvious socio-political slant on some of the characters and stereotypes. Whites are sparse and portray the weaker characters, while minorities get to play all the heroes. The heroic pilot is black (granted, he has other issues, but he ""overcomes"" and is still the hero). The heroic stewardesses are black and hispanic (the lone white stewardess stupidly ignores safety regulations on the plane). The uptight, nerdy co pilot is white (said co pilot and his wife are later shown to be radically Christian, which comes across as comical and loony, not by accident I'm sure). The one other mention of God is by a white cancer patient who has ""chemo brain"" and behaves spastically rather than coherently. The brilliant young lawyer is black. The drug addict Nicole is white. The persecuting NTSB staff is white. The drug pusher is white. The life-saving doctor is Indian. Oh, and Denzel has ONE white friend in the entire movie.

Great story, incredible action and suspense, excellent acting, just a shame it was tainted with too-graphic imagery and language, and a very blatantly politicized undertone.",1359331200,5,2839,5.083690987124464

I love to watch movies with Denzel Washington because he makes you feel the emotions of the character, as with this character, Whip Whitaker. Also noted, Flight had an all star cast with Don Cheadle and John Goodman.

The character of Whip Whitaker, takes on what should be just another every day domestic flight. The weather condition was bad and Whip had not slept the night before with alcohol and cocaine fresh in his system. Almost at their destination, and after battling strong weather and turbulence, the plane begins to malfunction. Whip takes control and does what no other pilot can do to try and save lives.

What happens next throughout the story is Whip Whitaker battles within him self the aftermath and the uncertainty of his future.

Anyway, as the movie progresses, other than multiple expletives and seeing drugs & alcohol in a non serious manner, you get the point of the movie.

5423326,5,B00AF6B22E,"Director Robert Zemeckis has given us the latest ""disaster"" movie. In the case of Flight however, Zemeckis' first live-action film since 2000s Cast Away, this is less the Die Hard kind of ""disaster"" and more the Leaving Las Vegas type. Zemeckis is a well-known director, whose films have peppered the pop-culture lexicon for the past 35 years. He is a pioneer who took Marty McFly Back to the Future, taught Forrest to run in Forrest Gump, and broke new ground in live-action/animation film making with films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Beowulf, The Polar Express, and A Christmas Carol. This year, Zemeckis showcases his craft with a strong character study of a disturbed pilot in Flight.

The intensity and effectiveness of Flight rests on the shoulders of its star, Denzel Washington, and it turns out Denzel Washington has some pretty strong shoulders. Washington dives head first into the character of pilot Whip Whitaker (a classic ""pilot"" name). Whitaker is a closeted addict, shrouded in denial. He routinely drinks to excess and uses stimulants to even out before flights. His lifestyle has cost him virtually any relationship or contact with his wife and son and has led him down the path of womanizing and heavy substance abuse as a desperate form of distraction.

Flight sets out to tell a story of moral ambiguity. Its protagonist is one who tests the ethical boundaries of the audience where at one moment we are rooting for him and the next, we are disgusted by him. This ambiguity fuels the pace and power of the film, and makes its 138 minute running time literally ""fly"" by. Washington is excellent, but Zemeckis is precise in his style, editing, and (yes, Pam and Eric) in his cinematography. Washington makes us see Whitaker's struggle, but Zemeckis makes us feel it with expert use of camera movements, showing us a static sober Whitaker and a flowing, frantic intoxicated Whitaker. The crash sequence is compelling and exceeds expectations, regardless of its assumed predictability. These nuanced touches make Flight deeply engaging and provide for some harrowingly primal audience reaction.

Furthermore, Washington's stellar performance is complemented at every turn with a pitch perfect supporting cast including Don Cheadle, Bruce Greenwood, Melissa Leo, and John Goodman (who is 2 for 2 with electric supporting roles this year with Flight and Argo). While the performances and the story are excellent, Flight does not accomplish all it is trying to do. A motif of religious purpose and providence feels crow barred in. Also, while excellent, the soundtrack is a bit heavy-handed in its relevance to what's happening on the screen, which can be distracting. However, these are minor quibbles. Overall, Flight is an excellent narrative that explores the dangers of addiction in an impressively unique way. This is a strong film that expertly demonstrates the talent of its cast and director.

5423327,4,B00AF6B22E,"Robert Zemeckis's ""Flight"" is one of the standout films of the year. This absorbing and unique story of a pilot fighting his addictions is another brilliant showcase for Denzel's Washington's talent. It is heartening to see Denzel Washington getting better at his craft with age. The aura of this veteran actor still transcends the movies he is in, and as much as he effortlessly repeats this in Flight the brilliant direction and story is a worthy complement to his performance as ace pilot Whip Whittaker, who runs into bad weather, literally and figuratively.

Flight's writer, John Gatins, an unpretentious and upcoming talent who penned the imaginative, underrated, Real Steel with Hugh Jackman from early 2012, proves that he is only beginning to find his Hollywood muse. Flight is similarly entertaining, but it is much heavier on serious drama. It is that curious mix of old fashioned big budget entertainment and intimate involving drama focusing on human foibles leading to tragic consequences.

Robert Zemeckis is one of the least self-indulgent directors working in Hollywood. He is a master of light-hearted, entertaining fare, for kids and adults alike, in the best tradition of Hollywood films -  Romancing the Stone, Back to the Future - being proofs of his great sense for spectacle and storytelling. But he has also made big mainstream movies with remarkable emotional power  and seriousness that has stood the test of time - Contact and Castaway, being notable examples.

With Flight he has proved once again that he is also a master of this more serious fare that instructs and delights. Much of his effectiveness in making big budget films that turn into lyrical, intimate dramas, stems from his remarkable eye for casting, and his ability to hire great actors and leave them alone to find new directions in performance they have not gone before. As such, he seems to be that rare example of an action director who is also an actor's director, a great collaborator with the actors he has chosen for his title roles. One hopes there is more to come from the Washington-Zemeckis collaboration in the future because Washington, like Zemeckis, has broken new ground.

Seeing Denzel Washington play the tortured role of Whip Whittaker to perfection in ""Flight"" got me thinking of his acting talent once again. He plays the victor and the vanquished with his characteristic pathos and honesty. The ups and downs of Whip's life are relentless and the chaos in Whip's life is hard to watch only because Washington gives his all in a precise and controlled performance. It takes a good deal of serenity, paradoxical as this may sound, in an actor to convincingly portray extremes of self-loathing and self-confidence on screen without it all floundering clumsily into messy melodrama. Denzel Washington as Whip in ""flight"" from reality is my pick for the best actor Oscar.

Strength and failure converge remarkably well in Washington's portrayal of a pilot superbly alive to his craft but lost to life. In one blinding moment of decision his life descends on his craft. A man too used to success has to steel himself for a harrowing admission of failure.",1358812800,3,3166,5.019047619047619

If it weren't for the decent acting job by Densel Washington & John Goodman, I would have given this movie 0 stars.  While the movie trailer gave the impression that this was a miraculous bit of piloting by another well trained and talented pilot like Captain Sully, that portion consisted of about 20 minutes of the entire movie.  The rest was about the destructive effects of drugs and alcohol addiction on a pilot's life who could have had it all, but instead flushed his life down the preverbal toilet.  If you want to be depressed and watch somebody destroy their life, then I would recommend this movie.  I can't imagine anyone buying this movie and watching it repeatedly.  I certainly NEVER want to watch it again.  Personally, I watch movies to escape reality & be entertained for a couple of hours or to learn something new & applicable, certainly not to feel worse than before I began watching. Unfortunately, that's exactly how I felt after watching this film.

(Flight- briefly, a frontloaded two hour plus movie - all the action and viewer interest in the beginning. Denzel Washington plays a coked-up & drunken pilot who pilots a full plane of a cheap poorly maintained airlines. The elevators or ailerons on the plane break and jam midair. The plane goes into a sheer dive. Washington's' character performs an impossible maneuver, he glides the broken plane near the ground, flips it over upside down in the air to slow it, flips it over again and miraculously lands the plane  in a field  saving most of the passengers. This excitement happens in the first half hour.

The remaining hour and a half is about the FAA investigators looking into the landing and Washington's character coming to terms with his cocaine and booze addictions. AA & Narcotics Anonymous 12-step stuff. Realistic and very well acted, but sad, depressing, gritty and not really what I call entertainment.  Probably a good object lesson for addicts.

5423331,3,B00AF6B22E,"I am getting tired of films and TV shows that glamourize and glorify alcohol and drug abuse.  This does both.  The film centers around Captain Whip Whitman (played by Denzel) who miraculously crash lands a jetliner that suddenly starts to nosedive.  Before the plane takes off we see the Captain drinking and taking cocaine. Now the important thing is that the drug and alcohol abuse has nothing to do with the plane crash.

After the plane crash the movie crashes. After the crash, Whip rids his life of alchol.  This is a great series of scenes where he goes through his grandfather's farmhouse (which he owns but is trying to sell) and starts by flushing his pain killers down the toilet and then bottle after bottle and six pack after six pack.  It appears that Whip is going to straighten out his life.  But then the film starts down the wrong road.  Whip goes to a meeting with his friend, now working for the pilot's union.  When he gets there he finds a lawyer (wonderfully played by Don Cheadle) and is told that there is a drug and alcohol report that states he was three times over the legal limit for alcohol and he tested positive for cocaine. If these results hold up, this means jail time.  My first thought is the film is going to be about Whip being railroaded and made the scapegoat.  But no, what next happens is he gets drunk and picks up a recovering drug adict he met in hospital (another great performance). Before the big finally, he is once again sober, its the night before his testimony before the ATSB.  He is in a hotel room, his mini bar is stocked with Coke products.  He hears a knocking.  He determines it the adjoining door.  He opens his side of the door to find the other side unlocked and he finds an empty room and a full mini bar which he proceeds to empty.  The next day, his friend and attorney buy him cocain to bring him around!  Come on without you stupid ending there would be no consequences for his actions.

How can you make this worse, start making it preachy.  Whip and Nicole (Kelly Reilly) attend an AA meeting with an over the top preachy testimonial.  Then another preachy scene is when he goes to visit his co-pilot in the hospital. And it ends with when Whip has a chance to escape it all with one final lie he decides he cannot and finally tells the truth which puts him in jail.

Now Denzel's performance is be hailed by many but come on its easy to play a drunk.  The better performaces come from Don Cheadle (and I am guessing many of his scenes probably wound up on the cutting room floor because he outclassed Denzel in every scene), Kelly Reilly who makes you feel that she is in love with Whip but will not let him bring her down and Tamara Tunie as the surving flight attendant who helps save the plane and then Whip.  These are the reason that I gave this film three stars and not Denzel or the script.

One final note, John Goodman is one of the greatest character actors around but this performace is one of his worst.  So over the top (almost as bad as performance in A Christmas Carol at the Kodak Theatre).

If you really want this film, I would say wait a few months and pick it up in the clearance bins at Big Lots.",1358035200,4,3188,4.342905405405405

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

'Flight', Robert Zemeckis' first live-action film in twelve years, starts off with one of the most spine-tingling, harrowing plane crash disaster scenes in cinematic history. Denzel Washington as the plane's alcoholic pilot, Captain William ""Whip"" Whittaker, crash lands his jet into a field after a broken jackscrew causes a catastrophic loss of control. Loosely based on a fatal Air Alaska crash in 2000, Whip successfully saves 96 out of 102 lives, by inverting the aircraft, right before it goes down.

Whip winds up in the hospital and soon recovers from minor injuries. Despite being hailed as a hero (a la the real-life Captain ""Sully"" Sullenberger), Whip was drunk during the flight and the National Transportation Safety Board now has a toxicology test taken when he first arrives at the hospital, that proves it. Fortunately for him, his tough as nails attorney, Hugh Lang (played by Don Cheadle), is able to quash the report due to irregularities in the blood test.

While the aforementioned plane crash is riveting, the bulk of 'Flight' is unfortunately just another tale of a sad sack alcoholic wrestling with his demons. Some may be impressed by the ambiguity of a man who can be both a hero and an angry, aggressive, self-destructive alcoholic at the same time--but most of 'Flight' is a story we've seen before.

While in the hospital, Whip meets Nicole who is recovering from a heroin overdose. Earlier, we see Nicole before she meets Whip and it's quite clear that her addiction is extensive. It seems rather odd that Whip would take Nicole under his wings at this juncture especially with the possibility of extensive media scrutiny, but he decides anyway to bring her back to his (now) deceased father's farm (why it takes the media a few days before they actually go out and confront Whip at the farm, doesn't ring true at all).

Nicole is there to contrast her quick transcendence over her addiction as opposed to Whip's continuing denial (it seems awfully convenient that such a severe addict as Nicole, is able to see the light, so quickly!). Still, Denzel Washington does a fine job in conveying just how hard it is to deal with someone who is an alcoholic (some of the best later scenes are Whip's confrontations with Nicole).

The rest of 'Flight' chronicles Whips' continuing downward spiral. There is Whip's visit to his ex-wife and son which ends quite badly and Charlie Anderson (the union rep) along with his attorney's attempt to sober him up before the big NTSB hearing. That whole scene is perhaps the least convincing in the film. You'll recall that Whip is placed in a hotel room where he has no access to alcohol. Even though they hire a bodyguard to watch the room, they don't bother to check to see if the adjoining room is stocked with alcohol. Furthermore, why would the door to the adjoining room be unlocked?--unless you've paid for the other room, a hotel would not leave such a door open.

In the end, Zemeckis must opt for the 'Hollywood' ending. At the crucial moment, Whip suddenly has a change of heart, and admits 'everything' at the NTSB hearing. In this case, he won't let the flight attendant he was sleeping with before the ill-fated flight, be blamed for 'drinking while on duty' (Whip won't impugn her reputation since she was responsible for saving a child during the crash). Is this enough for a man so in denial as Whip is, to suddenly 'come clean'? Unlikely. It would have been a lot more troubling if Zemeckis showed Whip staying in denial and is cleared at the hearing--but Zemeckis needs a feel good ending. Whip does go to prison afterward but is on his way to reconciliation with his son (who visits him in prison) and presumably with the ex-wife. There's also a rather obvious moral tale here--Whip articulates it when he states at the film's conclusion that he finally feels 'free' in prison, as he is no longer hitting the bottle.

Despite a pretty positive critical reception, there were a number of critics who refused to jump on the bandwagon--recognizing that the story surrounding Denzel's performance, in the words of LA Times critic Kenneth Turan, ""is not as subtle or involving as his performance."" Turan feels that 'Flight"" ""plays at times like a feature-length infomercial for the powers of AA."" David Fear agrees: ""Take out the opening jaw-dropper, and you've essentially got The Lost Weekend Redux. Despite Washington going the full nine yards ugly-drunk-wise, there's little to distinguish this from every other entry in the cinema du addiction genre: You'll get the requisite denial, hitting rock bottom and then rockier bottom, relapse and, finally, a moment of clarity.""

Stan Hall in the Portland Oregonian feels that Zemeckis' ""best-known work has a tendency to go for grand gestures, old-fashioned moralizing and outcomes that can often be spotted from miles away."" And he finds that, ""there's not much real value to this oddly slick stab at popcorn entertainment about a person's debilitating alcoholism."" Andrew O'Hehir in Salon concurs that Zemeckis is a ""technical wizard"" but ""drama just isn't his instrument"": ""Slowly but surely, ""Flight"" degenerates from a tale of moral paradox and wounded romance into a mid-1990s after-school special about addiction and recovery. You get the feeling the filmmakers are aiming for a star-driven combo of the Sully saga and ""Crime and Punishment.""

I quote these critics to point out that I'm not the only one who has reservations about this film. I think most of us will agree that the plane crash scene and Denzel's excellent performance are the highlights of the film. I'm not sure how many will agree with me and these other discerning critics, that Flight's narrative is nothing special, with its pedestrian emphasis on one man's quest to purge his alcoholic demons and the obvious exhortation to embrace sobriety.",1357862400,7,5915,4.934673366834171

And if you really want to ruin a moive - just add John Goodman to the mix. The only redeeming part - was the clever 'plane roll-over' which was right in the movie trailer. Shame on the creator, director and Denzel taking an inspiring story - and making even this charactor's 'recovery' sickening too.

The director (Robert Z.) crafts a beautiful story here, every scene seemed to grow more intense as the movie played out, ending with a very emotional end. This isn't an action flick like those stated above so be prepared for an emotional and  dramatic tale. Don Cheadle delivered a great performance also as well as the supporting cast.

However, that's not what ""Flight"" is truly about. Not to undermine its wonderful story but it is a simple one. Denzel Washington portrays airline pilot Whip Whitaker, an alcoholic and drug user, who saves many lives aboard his flight when a technical mishap occurs. He's hailed a hero, but it comes up that there was alcohol in his blood after the crash. Now, Whip is trying his best to avoid jail time when an investigation into the crash is conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Along the way, he meets various characters who are there to ""wake him up"" to his addiction, but it is up to him to come to the realization. Washington shines as the troubled protagonist (in fact, you might say he's a mirror image to Tom Hanks' Chuck Noland from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cast-Away-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00003CXRP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cast Away (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>).

Denzel gives us another oscar-winning performance showing all sides of the character professionally and in the charcter's personal life.  The story is great-makes you think-how do you know who is really flying the plane you're on!  Don Cheadle, as Whip's (Washington) lawyer is also a plus in this movie-makes you wonder what lengths lawyers go to protect clients-or is it just airline lawyers?? I felt that Cheadle's character knew how flawed/guilty Whip was but did so much to portray him as innocent.  And John Goodman-does anyone else think Best Supporting Actor??
While some say an over-the-top performance, I say right on!!  What a surprise (shock?) when he explodes into the room and spouts his ""cure-all"" recommendations.  I thought he was priceless!

5423340,4,B00AF6B22E,"This movie isn't an action pack movie - not at all. Instead this movie is more of a story about the life of the pilot after the amazing landing, he did after the plane failed in mid-air. It is said that no pilot could had done what he did. They even tested that many times with many different pilot in the simulator.

The movie is a slow peace movie there is no action but just talking after the landing of the airplane. And, all the of the major action scenes will be in the beginning, so you can just get up and leave after the crash, if you just wanted an action movie. Please, leave now.

Now, for the rest of you that are still willing to learn what happens to a pilot after a big crash, you will be pleasantly surprised. This movie can be very entertainment, if you give it a chance. You can get into the movie earlier on and enjoy finding out a little by little who is this pilot and how he could had done his amazing landing? You will find out that later, after a big crash, there is a court case and hearing for the pilot. The hearing is to see if the pilot is responsible for the crash or was it something else?

The movie does a great job trying to build up to the final climax for the court appearance. At the appearance is where, the pilot future will be. Would the pilot ever fly again? Will he go to jail? Will he just skip and leave the country? These are the things you will find out, if you watch this movie.

If this is a spoiler, I apologize, but I did not need to see a completely nude woman walking around a hotel room for about - I don't know, maybe ten minutes.

Flight is about more than just a plane crash. When I viewed the trailer, I didn't expect this movie to be so gritty. Not a fan of gritty. There is drug use, nudity and quite a bit of profanity. Still, all in all, this is a good film. Whip (Denzel Washington) was a drunk, arrogant, drug-addicted pilot in a lot of pain. The whole struggling to get sober and stay sober was so real and educational even. Denzel's performance was great! I also think John Goodman did a terrific job and all other performances were good.

Favorite line: ""No one could have landed that plane like I did. No one.""

The plane crash and investigation surrounding it are merely obvious metaphors for his own turmoil (drug and alcohol abuse, a broken marriage, a life of missed opportunities) and Zemekis has woven these two elements together and brings them to stunning and heartbreaking conclusion and Denzel Washington (my choice for best actor of 2012)  will reduce you to tears.

Side note, I seriously have no idea why half the audience gasped at this scene in the film. Read the freaking rating. Flight is rated R for a bunch of reasons, one of them being nudity. Nudity means private parts, like boobs and butts, and sometimes genitals, so don't be surprised when you see that in the movie. The film continues to follow the life of Whip Whitaker, pilot and alcoholic. Whip leads the fast life of drugs, booze, and sex, and it catches up to him when a routine flight goes wrong. This film focuses on his addiction to alcohol and how it destroys his life and those around him. I really liked the man vs. self theme in this film, as well as how Whip is his own worst enemy. Whip is the only thing holding himself back from moving on with his life and reconnecting with his ex wife and son. Some critics say this is Denzel's best film. I would argue there are much better films he has been in, but his performance here is still nothing short of fantastic, as always.

I had a lot of issues with this film. A lot of the characters aren't likable (especially the lead) which makes it difficult to have any real moral compass in a film that lacks any moral center whatsoever. Plagued with lies, drinking to excess, and an almost abusive father figure, Whip is not a very likable character. Even his girlfriend gets annoying. I didn't like John Goodman either, even though it seemed like most of the audience did. My biggest issue with this film is one scene that features Whip's attorney and NTSD buddy helping him cover up that he's drunk by doing cocaine. This seemed extremely far fetched and silly, and it took away from the serious tone of the film.

Flight takes off because of Denzel Washington's fine performance as an alcoholic and unrepentant liar, but doesn't quite level off because of some silly scenes that make what could've been a great film a good one. Still, this is worth watching, especially if you are a big Denzel fan like I am. This is certainly not a bad film, but it's not really a great one either.",1356912000,,2151,4.443037974683544

The movie opens with explicit nudity and drug use. Preboarding his flight, Whip is totally loaded. So after the crash, the investigation procedures produce test results showing intoxication and presumed impairment. Thus, the stage is set for a legal and moral battle.
There is MUCH drug and alcohol use in this movie. There is nudity but no sex. All the acting is very good. This movie is not for children.
BOTTOM LINE, DENZEL WASHINGTON IS A STAR. His ACTING ABILITY is ENORMOUS. That was more than evident with another SPECTACULAR PERFORMANCE. I will give the movie 4 stars, but Mr. Washington's performance is 5 star.

5423349,5,B00AF6B22E,"FLIGHT is film that belongs in the ""airplane disaster"" genre of films. In a nutshell, a senior-level airplane pilot has a severe and chronic problem with alcohol, recreational drugs, and hookers. During a routine flight, the plane experiences a mechanical problem which prevents the tail rudder from functioning, and the plane spontaneously dives into a crash mode. Fortunately, the pilot is able to rescue the plane (by flying it upside-down), releases excess fuel into the atmosphere, and skillfully lands it in a grassy field. Most of the film is spent disclosing the pilot's indulgences in alcohol, cocaine, and other sleazy behaviors.

The entire film is a journey to a destination that takes the form of a plus/minus choices. An example of the plus/minus choices are: (1) Should the pilot be held responsible for the crash and for the few passenger deaths, because of his unique alcoholism and recreational drug activities with the consequent loss of control of the craft, or (2) Should the pilot be lauded as a hero, because of his astonishing skill in maintaining control of the airplane during the mechanical failure, and because of the fact that he prevented the deaths of dozens of passengers? The surprise ending is that the destination of the movie is located in a legal ""gray area."" (Don't worry, I do not tell how the story ends.)

TECHNICAL ASPECTS. The technical aspect of the film is based on a real event, namely, Alaska Airlines flight 261. In flight 261, a McDonnell Douglas MD-83 aircraft experienced a fatal accident on January 31, 2000 over the Pacific Ocean about 2.7 miles north of Anacapa Island, California. The two pilots and 83 passengers on board were killed.
The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the cause was a loss of airplane pitch control resulting from the in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system screw assembly's acme nut threads. Towards the end of the movie (Flight), the viewing audience watches a federal inquest as to the causes of the crash, and the viewing audience learns that the failure was due to excess wearing of the same screw assembly.

OPENING MOMENTS. The opening moments of the movie will come as a surprise. The viewer will be treated to an abundance of mammary footage and gluteal footage of Denzel Washington's drug addict girlfriend. I was wondering if we were going to see naked footage of Mr. Washington, but fortunately the viewer is spared. In the opening minutes, we also see Mr. Washington snorting cocaine, we see bag of marijuana, and we see the girlfriend injecting heroin. Now the question that arises is, whether adult viewers will have a stomach for this sort of thing. Certainly, male viewers will welcome the excellent anatomy of the female actress. However, the nude scenes, and the drug scenes, seemed to me, to be X-rated material. At any rate, this is the only nudity that occurs in the film, and the nudity is similar to that shown in KRAMER VERSUS KRAMER, when we see Dustin Hoffman's girlfriend. It is my opinion that the material is suitable for children, but only for the age of 12 and over. Younger kids will likely respond with bad dreams. In my opinion, this film is an excellent teaching device for kids of the age of 12 and up, since it provides a case history of alcoholism and addiction. The film does NOT include any Sam Pekinpah-style violence. However, parents who have made up their minds that their children should NOT see nude scenes and should NOT be exposed to scenes of alcoholism and drugs, should refrain from buying the DVD.

TENOR OF THE FILM. The film provides a guided tour of some of the gray areas of life. During the flight, the young copilot is alarmed by Mr. Washington's bizarre activities in the cockpit, e.g., his behavior in pretending that the oxygen mask is a recreational drug that is to be inhaled. And so the viewing audience is given the choice of siding with the naive young copilot, or of not making any committed decision at this point. While on the ground, Mr. Washington tries to become reacquainted with his son, who lives with the divorced mother, and who is totally alienated from his father. And so, the viewing audience is given the choice of siding with the son's decision to cut of ties with the father, or to favor Mr. Washington's attempts at reconciliation. As the plot matures, Mr. Washington's girlfriend takes him to an alcoholics anonymous (AA) meeting, but Mr. Washington resists the hackneyed preaching of the meeting leader, and excuses himself from the meeting. And so, the viewing audience is given the choice of deciding that Mr. Washington is a lost cause, as far as his alcoholism is concerned, or of maintaining some belief that Mr. Washington will be able to reform himself eventually. For your information, it is the case that up to the very last minutes of the film, Mr. Washington continues to snort cocaine and to drink hard liquor. Another gray area is that blood samples were withdrawn from the entire crew and passengers, as well as from the dead crash victims. The result was that Mr. Washington's blood tested positive for cocaine and alcohol. The relevant gray areas (or sources of ambiguity) are as follows. The equipment from the clinical testing laboratory was not calibrated thereby leading to doubt of the validity of the lab results, and leading to the airlines officials successful sealing Mr. Washington's laboratory results, thereby preventing the positive results from being disclosed during the federal inquest. The gray area is, therefore, were the lab results really incorrect, or were they valid, in showing Mr. Washington's high alcohol and drug levels.

SPECIAL EFFECTS. The crash landing scene is a work of art. After flying the airplane upside-down for several minutes, Mr. Washington rights the airplane, approaches a grassy meadow. One of the wingtips slices through a church steeple, causing parishioners to scatter, and we see the plane twisting and buckling as it lands in the field, in a dramatic manner that recalls the drama of the whaling scenes in MOBY DICK, starring Gregory Peck. Another special effect (though a low tech special effect) occurs when Mr. Washington is in a hotel room at night, waiting to meet government officials the next day. During the night, the door to the next suite, accidently left unlocked, invitingly bangs against the door latch, due to the evening wind, puffing into the adjoining hotel suite. Mr. Washington rises, walks through the door to the next suite, and stands before the open window. This is a great suspensful moment, achieved with zero expense, aside from the need for one of the film crew to jar the door a few times (thus simulating the wind). The suspense of this scene continues, when Mr. Washington spots the hotel fridge and opens it, revealing dozens of bottles of liquor and beer. Mr. Washington takes out one of the liquor bottles, and the movie camera focuses upon it closely, and the 4 inch high liquor bottle takes up the entire screen. Suspense comes, because the audience will wonder if Mr. Washington will open the bottle, or if he will resist to temptation (and decidedly turn a new leaf before his meeting the next day with airline officials who are investigating the crash).

CONCLUSION. The film is one of the most intelligent films to come out of Hollywood. The film is similar to another movie starring Denzel Washington, namely, CRIMSON TIDE. CRIMSON TIDE also featured a government inquest, this one involving a submarine, and the issue of firing nuclear weapons. The journey of this movie navigates through the black and white territory involving the question of who behaved correctly, Denzel Washington or Gene Hackman. But unexpectedly, at the last moment, the plot line of CRIMSON TIDE takes an unexpected turn, and navigates away from the black and white area, and concludes in a harbor known as the ""gray area."" FLIGHT also takes a similar unexpected turn at the conclusion of the film. FIVE STARS.",1356566400,,7995,4.927299703264095

5423351,4,B00AF6B22E,"This fast-paced film stars Denzel Washington as an airline pilot with a drinking problem.  When there is a flight crash killing several people there is an investigation.  Mostly, Denzel is worried about the findings of this investigation which causes him to drink even more even though he has a legal team that is doing everything they can to protect him.

There are great scenes in this film including the way his lawyers try to spin the facts and save him from going to jail.  His fine acting makes the audience identify with him even though it is clear that his drinking problem is out of control and he is guilty.

There are no surprises in this film but the acting is really good, the plot moves swiftly and the story is tragic as well as very believable.  I saw this film in a theater but I expect it should be available for rental soon.  It's well worth watching and I recommend it even though the formula is familiar.",1356480000,4,925,4.470238095238095
5423352,4,B00AF6B22E,"This Flight peaks with a crash-landing. It happens at the 25-minute mark. The plot descends into an extended epilogue from there, not as much about the airplane as it is about the pilot, nicknamed Whip. It was his technical know-how that saved 96 of the 102 ""souls"" on board, but, as far as the National Transportation Safety Board and a blood test are concerned, it could be his alcoholism that endangered their lives in the first place.

Director Robert Zemeckis cues the legal drama movie music, scored by Alan Silvestri, and lets the story coast along. What Whip, played by a somber, if not sober, Denzel Washington, does at the end is an automatic nominee for stupidest movie character decisions ever. It seems highly unlikely that a real-life pilot in his position would do such a thing on the grounds of mere morality. But I'm with him, and the movie, up until that point.

The remaining more than two hours glorify gratuitous sex and nudity, how alcoholics can fake sobriety by abusing cocaine, and how a drug pusher can save the day though the ""proper"" use of his wares.

He put in a great performance, probably much better than he did in ""Training Day"", for which he won an Oscar, and definitely superior to the ""phoned-in"" performance on ""Unstoppable"", a totally not-believable train movie. (Please, ""Runaway Train"" was a million times better!) But..., and this is a BIG but...., Flight was not about airplanes, or particularly about a flight. It was about alcoholism and drug addiction. If you want to see Denzel get drunk over and over, snort line after line of coke, and smoke a bunch of joints, this is your flick. John Goodman plays his drug dealer, and Kelly Reilly, a really fine English actress, plays a heroin addict, cooking her goop in a spoon and injecting it in her arm, then passing out. Family fun. Language? Forget about letting the kids see it!

I was terribly surprised. Denzel and Robert Zemeckis, of ""Forest Gump"" fame? I thought, it's gotta be good. I was expecting a movie more along the lines of ""Flight Plan"" with Jodie Foster. That movie was about a flight; ""Flight"" isn't. It's about drug abuse, lying, deceit, very bad, stupid behavior, and the inevitable decent to the bottom, where Denzel loses everything. He could just as easily have been a bus driver, a riverboat captain, a truck driver, or a cable car conductor. Anyway, it's not how you want to see Denzel, or remember him.

5423357,4,B00AF6B22E,"After a series of mainstream action flicks, Denzel Washington stretches his acting chops again as Whip (really?) Whitaker, a seasoned pilot for a regional airline. Whip is so good at what he does, that he also manages to bed one of his flight attendants (stunning Nadine Velazquez) and gets plastered the night before seemingly without consequence.

Hung over as he is, he straightens out by polishing off warm beer with a couple lines of cocaine as a chaser. I don't know if that works in the real world but it does for Whip. Some of the TV ads give the impression that Whip is a hero by pulling off a Sullenberger landing maneuver (he does) but is being hounded because of a small amount of alcohol was found in his system. Make no mistake this guy was hammered and should not be flying.

Still with the help of a little vodka, he manages to control a doomed airliner saving the vast majority of the passengers. Unexpectedly once the NTSB/FAA begins their investigation, Whip feels invincible and doesn't slow down. Washington performance stands out of course. He plays a realistic drunk and seems to have all the facial tics, bobs and wrinkles on full throttle. Washington gets plenty of supporting help along the way. Kelly Reilly is a reformed druggie that gets involved with Whip after a hospital meet. Brian Geraghty is Whip's born again co-pilot. Tamara Tunie is the supervising flight attendant and longtime friend. Bruce Greenwood is Whip's union chief. Melissa Leo is the lead federal investigator. Don Cheadle is his lawyer and John Goodman brings some needed comedic relief as Whip's ""Goodtime Charlie"" supplier.

It all works, including the great flight scenes leading up to the crash and some well-placed rock classics. Director Robert Zemeckis must be the go to director when it comes to simulating plane crashes. Remember the dizzying ocean ditch in ""Cast Away?""

Despite the slowdown in the narrative momentum, the actor lends a chilling honesty and his considerable charisma to his textured portrayal of Whip Whitaker, an ace commercial pilot for a regional Southern airline whose debilitating alcoholism forces him to live in a world of denial and distrust. He's middle-age, divorced, and estranged from his son, but he can still party hard with a sexy flight attendant and fly a jet airliner the morning after with the help of a line of cocaine. Their 9AM flight to Atlanta faces severe turbulence upon take-off, but it's nothing Whip can't handle with his skillful bravado intact. Having achieved momentary calm, he falls asleep at the controls after downing a couple of airline-size bottles of vodka mixed with orange juice. Suddenly the jet loses its hydraulics and descends uncontrollably with its engines on fire.

To the shock of his by-the-book co-pilot, Whip decides to invert the plane and fly it upside down to achieve some stability in order to maneuver a last-ditch attempt at an emergency landing in an open field populated with a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses. Miraculously, only six of 102 passengers and crew perish upon impact, and Whip is hailed as a hero much like Sully Sullenberger after he heroically saved a jet on the Hudson River.

What follows this life-changing incident is far less unique as it becomes clear that Whip's blood alcohol count was well over the legal limit during the flight, and the ensuing investigation could easily destroy his career and send him to prison on manslaughter charges. He gets help from former colleague Charlie Anderson, the pilots' union representative for the airline, as well as Hugh Lang, a severely humorless lawyer who is pushing hard to discredit the toxicology reports which prove Whip's unfit condition for flying. The ongoing public pressure of the case sends Whip into isolation at his late father's farm where he begins another downward spiral into alcohol.

He gets involved with recovering heroin addict Nicole whose own story of desperation is juxtaposed with his until they meet at the hospital and enter into a relationship. All this leads to a climactic hearing with the National Transportation Safety Board where his fate will be determined. Washington is onscreen for nearly the film's entire 139-minute running time, and his impassioned performance is fiercely without vanity.

5423361,3,B00AF6B22E,"Many films suffer from under-exposure. People don't hear about or have the opportunity to see a great film filled with great performances because the film is produced and released by a small company and it never reaches movie theaters in the suburbs. When it reaches DVD and Streaming, people have another opportunity, but a theatrical release is the main driving force behind a DVD release, so it may be ignored here as well.

Robert Zemeckis' new film ""Flight"" suffers from just the opposite. From the moment people started to see it, at festivals and screenings, praise and hype has been heaped on the film and Denzel Washington's performance. All of this praise has amped up our expectations to a place it would be difficult to meet. And it didn't meet my expectations.

Zemckis has spent the last few years making motion-capture computer animated films. He uses this technology to film actors wearing specially designed suits as they act out their roles. Then, his technicians add a layer of computer animation to place these characters in rich and impressive landscapes. This technology allows Zemeckis to put his characters in created landscapes it would be too costly and prohibitive to make otherwise.

The experiment has yielded very good (""A Christmas Carol""), good (""Monster House""), strange (""The Polar Express"") and abysmal results (""Beowulf""). But the experiment seems strangest of all because Zemeckis, a director made famous by his fantasy and action films, films memorable because of the humanity of the actors, became so enthralled with technology that ultimately takes away that layer of humanity.

In ""Flight"", Zemeckis returns to a story very much grounded (har har!) in reality. This may be one of the reasons the film is receiving so much praise; people are happy to see humans in a Zemeckis' film again. No more soulless, blank-eyed zombies trying to entice children onto a train destined for a far away land.

The other reason ""Flight"" is receiving so much praise is Washington's performance. It is pretty remarkable and unlike anything he has done before. Raw, vulnerable, emotional, very conflicted. On the outside, he appears to be every bit the archetype Washington hero. But as we watch the performance unfold, Washington brings so many new layers to the role, giving us a three-dimensional portrait of Whip Whitaker, a very troubled pilot working for a small airline.

From the opening frames, you realize Washington is going for something different, very different from what we have seen before. The actor has stated in interviews that he avoids scenes of intimacy because he doesn't want to make his wife uncomfortable. Because of this, we rarely if ever see him kiss his on-screen love interest. In ""Flight"", all of these notions are thrown out the window.

Whip Whitaker is an addict. He shows up hung over for his quick flight from Orlando to Atlanta. After checking the exterior, in torrential rain, he boards and gets every one ready for take-off. The flight immediately runs into very bad turbulence, but he and his co-pilot lead the plane out of the bad weather. About a half hour later, the plane experiences more trouble.

As soon as Whip realizes the plane is in trouble, his senses and faculties kick into razor-sharp focus. All of the previous alcohol and drug-use seem to completely dissipate. He guides the plane to safety, saving most of the passengers and crew from a more fatal crash landing.

All of this happens in the first act. And it is compelling and insanely watchable. Every so often, a film depicts an event so well, your mind remembers it every time the subject is broached. In ""Flight"", the turbulent landing of the jet is such an event. You won't find this film playing on any commercial flight. Nor should you watch it while flying on a plane. No good will come from such an act. ""The Gray"" was the last film I saw with such an intense, realistically depicted plane crash. ""The Impossible"", out in December, features a harrowing depiction of the tsunami that hit Thailand a few years ago.

But once act 2 begins, ""Flight"" veers off course. It really starts to do this much earlier. As we watch Whip starting his day, the narrative suddenly, inexplicably shifts to follow Nicole (Kelly Reilly, Mary Watson in ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"") as she tries to score. Ultimately, Nicole's life intercepts with Whips, but these initial moments are jarring because they pull us out of and distract us from Whip's more interesting story. Worse, Nicole's story has been done and seen millions of times. And many of these have been much more convincing. Just about every time Nicole enters the story, the film loses focus.

As Whip recovers in the hospital, people begin to show up. Everyone is ready to acknowledge he is a hero, but there is also an undercurrent of sentiment leading people to begin questioning his sobriety. Enter Charlie Anderson (Bruce Greenwood), the Pilot's Union President, and Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle), the lawyer they hire to represent Whip. The entire second act is about Whip trying to fight his addiction; he retreats to his childhood home and camps out, trying to evade reporters. He tries valiantly to stay sober, but the urge proves too great.

Ultimately the film mars Washington's performance by becoming too preachy. He seems to be doing well; he throws all the alcohol away, he attends AA, he meets various survivors and their families, all-eager to heap gratitude on Whip. But all of this only serves to drive Whip closer and closer to the bottle of the drugs as he falls back on his old, self-destructive habits.

Washington's performance is very good and very realistic. He is clearly going to some dark places to reveal parts of Whip's character. But the story doesn't show us anything new or take Whip to anyplace we haven't seen before. Charlie and Hugh, both charged with helping Whip avoid any criminal charges, pop up every few minutes to explain the situation and warn Whip about the consequences of his behavior. Ultimately, they are warning us, preaching to us about the consequences. It makes the progression of Whip's problems seem a little too 'movie-of-the-week'. At one point, Whip attends an AA meeting, but leaves early because it isn't for him, he doesn't need it, and he can handle his addiction. Really? We have seen this so many times before, in television shows, television movies, feature films, etc. I understand that most addicts will probably go through this type of experience, but it doesn't mean we have to watch every addict on screen go through the same thing. Unless they experience something new related to it.

John Goodman appears as Harling Mays, Whip's dealer. His performance is another scene-stealer and worthy of praise.

Melissa Leo pops up in the final moments as a NTSB Investigator. Her role is too brief and one-note to add anything special.

Written By John Gatins (""Real Steel"", ""Coach Carter""), the story was inspired by his own travels through addiction. But he doesn't really offer anything new because we've seen these highs and lows before. And his background writing Hollywood-style inspirational movies lead us to a similar extremely conventional, and predictable, Hollywood-like ending in ""Flight"" that just seems false.

Zemeckis has assembled all of the elements of a fantastic, intense nail-biter. But he wimps out; he doesn't seem to have the conviction to show us a true depiction of a man's harrowing journey through addiction. He seems to shy away from painting a truly dark, uncompromising vision, something that would be truly memorable.",1353974400,,7598,4.97478329393223

It's a comically anomalous turn but something of a relief especially during the sturm-und-drang of the film's second half.

5423367,5,B00AF6B22E,"Chances are you will not see this film as your in-flight movie the next time you fly the friendly skies. And for good reason, too. The opening sequence includes perhaps the most hair-raising plane crash scene ever, so spectacular that even if you know what to expect, that won't prevent you from crushing your popcorn box from the tension of it. This scene alone is worth the price of admission.

At the wheel of the stricken jet is Captain William ""Whip"" Whitaker (Denzel Washington) who pulls off a landing only less miraculous than the real life exploit of Chesley Sullenberger who landed his own craft in the Hudson River in 2009, losing not a soul aboard. There is one major difference however. Whitaker is both drunk and stoned when he is piloting the craft although his condition is not the reason the airliner malfunctions.

It is the twin truth, acknowledged by all involved (including the viewer,) that Whitaker is both a self-centered alcoholic AND the only pilot with the chops that could have saved the 96 passengers on Flight 227. However, six others perished, including a crew member with whom he was having a fling with, and so the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is called in to investigate.

Despite his heroics, Whitaker is under suspicion for the high level of alcohol found in his system and the two empty vodka bottles retrieved from the airliner's trash compartment. It having been a non-beverage service flight, only the crew is suspect although we had seen Whip empty them into an orange juice container right before the airplane lost control.

As Whitaker waits for the NTSB hearing that will either clear his name or place him in prison for manslaughter, the audience is torn between sympathy and revulsion. Sympathy because he did indeed save the plane and revulsion because he is a classic addict, living a life encumbered by lies and excuses.

What transpires at the hearing and the night before is the watershed moment of both the movie and the life of Whip Whitaker.  The subsequent ending, based on what transpires, contains an ambiguity that is both justified and satisfying.

Washington is flawless here, his acting abilities never put to better use. He is ably aided by John Goodman (as a jolly scenery-stealing drug pusher), Don Cheadle as his hard-pressed lawyer and a sweet turn by Kelly Reilly as the waif-like heroin addict who is Whitaker's moral conscience. Melissa Leo appears at the finale in a somewhat muted role as the main NTSB investigator.

In conclusion, there are many movies out this holiday season. ""Flight"" is worth the hype as long as you aren't about to board an airliner to spend Christmas with your far-off relatives.",1353456000,,2689,4.894505494505495
5423368,4,B00AF6B22E,"Having seen the previews several times for this I was fairly certain what I was in for. Turns out the previews were misleading. I have to assume were they more truthful, fewer people would have forked over the dough to see it.

Here's the scoop. Denzel wakes up on the morning of his next flight. He's in bed with a flight attendant. They're drinking and doing cocaine. During said flight a malfunction threatens the plane. He's able to miraculously bring it down and only lose 6 ""souls"" in the process. During his recovery it's discovered that he has a lot of liquor and drugs in his system, so industry politics sets in to try and keep him from going from being a hero to a criminal. It's a rough road and he stumbles a lot.

I thought this plot was going to be more mechanical. That it would tighten and tighten until the investigators found the crucial element that brought the plane down and exonerated Denzel. Nope. This is a drama about him coming to terms with his alcoholism. You see all the fits and starts. You hear all the lies he says to everyone, including himself, as he journeys down an uncertain path.

Zemeckis has come a long way as a director. This is much more subtle an outing than we're used to seeing from him. The scene where the plane is going down, as harrowing and white knuckling as it is, is much less 'in your face' than it might have been had he done it a decade ago. It's quieter overall as well. Given the subject matter there could have been a lot more histrionics than there were. The scenes and performances are more subdued and introspective. It also sports a softer look. He goes for a more natural feel. His projects usually aim for visual excess.

Michael Phillips, reviewer for the Chicago Tribune, loved this film. He gave it his highest rating. As much as I liked it, I didn't think it achieved quite the level he did. Not because it wasn't done well. I'm just not convinced that some of Washington's struggles with his beast haven't already been done before in films such as ""Clean and Sober"" and ""The Lost Weekend"" to name just a few. So this is not breaking new ground at some levels. But it is done as well as it could be given the material. Phillips thought the ending was a bit pat but felt the film makers ""earned"" it. I liked the end. It's the cliff that Washington will either jump off or not.

This is a heck of a flick. It's good at every level. If you're into dramas they don't get much better than this.",1352937600,,2460,4.37417943107221
5423369,4,B00AF6B22E,"Let's begin with the obvious... you probably won't find this film on the list of choices for in-flight movies the next time you ""fly the friendly skies"".

We've come to expect great performances from Denzel Washington and his flawed character in ""Flight"" does not disappoint. His portrayal of ""Whip"" Whitaker, a skilled veteran pilot battling his demons via booze and blow, is believable and near brilliant. From the first scene it is obvious he has issues. And as the film progresses, layer after layer is of his chaotic life is exposed. After painting himself into a corner, Washington's character must make a life altering decision. And it is this journey that's the subject of the film. It's a movie about choices, and how one man finds redemption, if not peace, by shelving his denial and taking personal responsibility, but not without great sacrifice.

As is abundantly clear in most of his roles, Denzel Washington as Whip Whitaker has the gift of cool. Even as all hell is breaking loose at 20,000 feet, he has the skill to do the impossible and at the same time displays the forethought to tell crew member Tamara Tunie's character: ""...Tell your son that you love him. Remember the black box. Tell him how much you love him"". He does all this without a wink's worth of sleep the night before, assisted only by a rookie first officer, a couple of lines of coke and an in-flight vodka screwdriver. And all without breaking a sweat.

Anyone who has dealt with issues related to substance abuse should be able to identify with Washington's character. The at-times feelings of invincibility and highs that often result in the lowest of lows. Capable in the face of disaster, Whip's impairment plays a role in his greatest triumph and is responsible for his personal destruction. He eventually redeems himself at great personal loss and it is this transformation from denial to acceptance that makes his performance so compelling. Denzel Washington has never looked more human than he does in ""Flight"".

Not to be overlooked, director Robert Zemeckis returned from his 12 year hiatus without missing a beat. His vision of the roller coaster that is Whitaker's life is well planned and transferred to the screen with the skill of an artisan. As is the case with Washington, Zemeckis can be counted on to deliver the goods whenever his name is on the marquee.

Good supporting performances by John Goodman, Bruce Greenwood, Kelly Reilly, Don Cheadle, and Tamara Tunie.

5423370,5,B00AF6B22E,"Have you ever wondered if you really have to fasten your seat belt on an airliner? This film will leave NO doubt! We open with scenes that provide background for a subsequent, harrowing, plane crash. Director Robert Zemeckis (""Cast Away"") knows how to set the stage.

After the astonishing but miraculous crash of an airliner, bits of disturbing information begin to surface about the brilliant pilot whose amazing skills dazzled the experts. Was he drunk? Was that cocaine in his blood? Watch the attorney for the pilots' union as he tries to formulate our hero's defense.

Here is the high-flying cast:
  * Denzel Washington (""Safe House"") This guy is clear about one thing: He is NOT an alcoholic! We see why flying is in his blood. He's a better pilot while impaired, than most other pilots at their very best. Yes, he's arrogant, but to quote Dizzy Dean, ""If you can do it, it ain't braggin'.
  * Tamara Tunie (""Law and Order, SVU"") Here we see a truly heroic flight attendant in action. Wow!
  * Don Cheadle (""The Guard"") This is how attorneys strategize. We may not respect his methods, but even though we know better, we still root for the defendant, so we appreciate how this guy thinks.
  * John Goodman (""Argus"") practically steals the show as a skilled purveyor of controlled substances and pharmaceuticals. His name is ""on the list.""
  * Kelly Reilly (""Sherlock Holmes"") looks like a young Dianne Keaton in her portrayal of a down-on-her-luck sometime actress who tries to hold onto a few standards for herself.
  * Bruce Greenwood (""Super 8"") is always a good utility man; this time he is our hero's last friend.

As a private pilot, I am unfamiliar with the instrument panel in an airliner, but I could certainly relate to issues as they came up. When the rudder, elevator and flaps malfunctioned, my heart was pounding along with everyone else's. Brace yourself for lots of nudity, profanity, drug use, and an extended, very effective scene with an airliner in distress. Whew!

Denzel Washington rarely disappoints, and his role in Flight is one of his most interesting performances in years. Unlike many of his roles, this one casts doubts about whether Washington's character is a hero or a villain.

If you haven't seen any reviews of the film, you might think that Flight is going to feature a lot of action, but the action is over once we experience the crash sequence. This is very much a drama.

The opening scenes show Captain Whip Whitaker (Washington) in bed with a flight attendant. He's been awake all night and he's drunk and high on cocaine. That's not exactly the best preparation for work when you are going to be entrusted with the lives of everyone on board a plane. Would you be happy if you knew that your pilot was in such a state?

Whitaker feels the need for another drink before the plane takes off, and drinks vodka without anyone noticing. When he takes his seat next to the co-pilot, Ken, his behavior appears a little odd. Whitaker orders coffee and Aspirin and takes off as though nothing is wrong. Ken's suspicions heighten when Whitaker exceeds the recommended speed while climbing to escape bad weather.

If you remember the crash in Cast Away, you'll know that Robert Zemeckis knows how to portray such an event effectively. In Flight, the crash is even more terrifying. If you are nervous about flying, this won't help you overcome it. The plane starts to fall apart at 30,000 feet, but Whitaker remains calm, although everyone else is panicking. In  one of the best scenes in the film, he takes the aircraft into a controlled roll and flies upside down to recover from an uncontrolled dive, before landing it in a field. Six of the 102 people on board are killed.

That all happens during the first 30 minutes of the film. Whitaker is apparently a hero, and we later learn that what he did was something that other pilots were unable to duplicate in simulated tests. So why isn't that the end of the story?

Someone has to be blamed for the crash.

A parallel story shows Nicole (Kelly Reilly), who is addicted to drugs. She meets Whitaker in the corridor of a hospital, when both sneak out to smoke a cigarette. Addiction is a key theme in the film and the two develop a kind of bond, recognizing similar character traits in each other.

The remainder of the story is a character study, and shows how Whitaker deals with life after the crash. Addictions to drugs and alcohol have affected some of the most important relationships in his life. We see him struggle to face that fact and the impact of the decisions he makes.

Whitaker isn't completely free to confront his personal demons as he is being investigated to determine whether he was at fault during the crash. We see him prepare for a hearing, which is not a trial in court, but could lead to him being found responsible for the six deaths, and ultimately result in him serving a life sentence. His preparation is aided by Charlie (Bruce Greenwood), a former pilot and colleague, and Hugh (Don Cheadle), who is a lawyer. Both give strong performances in small supporting roles. The most colorful character in the film is Whitaker's friend, Harling Mays (John Goodman). If Goodman had played The Dude in The Big Lebowski, he would have looked something like this.

Melissa Leo does a good job as Ellen Block, who leads the investigation into Whitaker's performance. Although I would like to talk about that sequence, I have already given away more than enough details about the plot.

Flight contains elements that make it a little hard to categorize. It's certainly not an action movie, but the crash scene will have you on the edge of your seat. It's more about addiction and what drives people to do what they do. It also makes the viewer question what is right and what is wrong.

If you have seen the film, is Whitaker a hero? What about the airline itself? Is the outcome fair, or would you have liked to have seen a different resolution?

Whatever your opinion of the events on the screen, it's hard to argue about the quality of the film itself. Washington gives one of his best performances, and Zemeckis treats the audience with respect and raises a lot of questions.

Flight is one of the best films I have seen in 2012.

5423372,3,B00AF6B22E,"The funny thing about the cinematic experience sometimes is that, for all that moviegoers seem to want more ""realism"" on the big screen (e.g. the dark, gritty, ""Dark Knight"" series, a movie completely steeped in reality falls a bit short.  Why?  Because, generally speaking, we go to the cinema to ESCAPE our own realities, not get sucked up in them once again.  Thus, for all the good things that ""Flight"" accomplishes, it is just too ""grounded"" to ever real produce the kind of emotional response needed to make it truly great.

For a basic plot summary (containing some minor spoilers), ""Flight"" sees pilot Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) perform an incredible feat of flying by landing a large commercial airliner that is literally falling apart around him.  The only problem?  Mr. Whitaker is an alcoholic who also uses cocaine to ""rev himself back up"" and continue flying.  When both substances are found on his toxicology report after the crash, Whip embarks on a personal journey that ultimately ends with him confronting his own personal demons.

There are some things that this film does very well.  The direction from Robert Zemeckis is sound, Denzel turns in a great performance, and the airplane sequences are absolutely captivating.  The plot and auxiliary characters are also just good enough to make it a solid effort despite my biggest critique:

I have never viewed a film so down-to-earth and utterly devoid of an ounce of contrived drama.  Usually that is a good thing (as so many films go the opposite route), but in this case it just makes for a flick that doesn't really arouse any deep emotions or feelings towards the on-screen proceedings.  Every step of Whip's journey is laid out for us, there are no surprises, and even the moments that could have been filled with drama are instead a bit anti-climactic because they have already been explained to us.

Overall, then, I can't rank ""Flight"" as anything significantly better than average.  It is a good role for Denzel, but other than that it just fails to capture any emotion enough to be a huge success.",1352073600,5,2084,4.880681818181818
5423373,2,B00AF6B22E,"Unfortunately I was really disappointed in this film from director Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forest Gump) because of its length and his use of stagnant shots. He chose to stay on faces, floors and eyeballs for a really long and inappropriate (and sometimes obnoxious) amounts of time. His direction seemed very dull and not as dynamic as most of his other films. It wasn't a fun film to look at, although definitely an interesting subject.

The shining points of this film was definitely the performance of Denzel Washington (Unstoppable, Safe House) and his honest portrayal of a man who is a true alcoholic. He is real, he is direct with his intent and most of all you understand the angst of what an alcoholic does to hide his addiction.

What makes this film a little different was the fact that this was a pilot of a major commercial airline who saves a plane from crashing while under the influence of over double the legal limit in his blood of an average alcoholic. And yes, he saves the plane in some fantastic flying maneuvering and incredible special effects.

Written by John Gatins (Real Steel, Coach Carter) who gave a great series of good scenes and monologues to Denzel, he just didn't fill in the gaps too well, because it was slow and dragging throughout most of the film to the point of boredom.

Other stand out performances included Bruce Greenwood ( Star Trek 2009, I, Robot) as the union rep that was sent to defend Denzel's character in order to keep him from going on trial for negligence. Bruce is always sharp and direct in his performances which complimented Denzel in many ways.

Don Cheadle (Crash, Iron man 2) also chimes in with a good performance as the lawyer that has to keep Denzel out of jail. Don and Bruce together really understand the issues and compassions that this pilot is going through but also know their job maybe too much to handle.

Another noticeably weird, yet extremely humorous performances came from none other than John Goodman (Flintstones, The Artist) who must have had a blast has the hippie who deals in drugs and cures for anyone who has an addiction of any kind. John was giving it his all but overall the character didn't seem to fit the film for me.

Overall the film is very slow. Not a lot of camera movement and other than the performances mentioned, when they are performing, it was an interesting movie. However, that said, I would wait for the DVD/Blu-Ray, where you can skip past to long, long, long shots/scenes!",1352073600,3,2495,4.669703872437358
5423374,4,B00AF6B22E,"FLIGHT is a gripping & well-made movie that has far less to say than it thinks it does (I felt much the same about CLOUD ATLAS...only that movie's ""point"" was even more mundane considering the effort spent in making it).  Robert Zemeckis is a consistently solid director, pushing technical boundaries and giving us complex characters.  Whether BACK TO THE FUTURE or CAST AWAY (to name just a couple), he knows how to make truly entertaining movies.  I've never spent a boring time in one of his films.  But FLIGHT is clearly reaching to do more than entertain, and this is where it fell short.  I was WELL entertained, but not terribly enlightened.

Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) is a pilot who apparently frequently comes to work drunk.  He's a ""functional"" alcoholic, but we meet him shortly before his next flight, and get a quick sense of how much booze and cocaine he is pouring into his system.  But flying is so second-nature to him that he's not having any issues flying safely.  But on THIS flight, things go wrong.  The plane has a colossal failure and begins to plummet to the ground.  Whitaker executes an amazing maneuver (I won't spoil it for you in case you haven't seen the trailer for the film), and brings the plane down in spectacular fashion.  (Zemeckis never skimps on the effects in his films).  Whitaker is injured, and when he awakens in the hospital, he discovers he is a national hero.

There's also the uncomfortable fact that the routine blood-alcohol test that was run on him while he was out shows he was enormously drunk.  I don't remember the exact number, but it was something like 0.24 (about 3 times the normal legal level).  There is no doubt he was not operating optimally.  There is no doubt that no one else could have brought the plane down safely.  There is little doubt that the fact that the plane failed at all had NOTHING to do with ""pilot error.""

Essentially, the film is an exploration of alcoholism.  Whitaker is a ""deep"" alcoholic.  His private life has been destroyed by his drinking.  He is enabled by co-workers who see what a great pilot he is.  And during this crisis, he is aided in hiding his affliction because the consequences of discovery by the world at large are pretty heft for the pilot's union, the airline, etc.  We get many chances to see Whitaker drinking a great deal.  And we watch the evolution of his character...his journey to the realization that he is an alcoholic.

This subject has been explored MANY times before.  There is no question that Washington gives one of the most powerful modern depictions of the ravages of alcohol & drug abuse.  It's certainly one of his best performances in a career full of them, because he is well and truly the star of the film.  Lots of close-ups.  Lots of scenes with JUST Washington in them...and he commands them all.  He is never to be over-shadowed (except in a couple of amusing scenes with John Goodman as his old friend and supplier).  Certainly the psychological journey he goes through is compelling viewing.

But FLIGHT tries to overlay this journey onto the much grander story of the plane crash.  It APPEARS to be morally or ethically complex, but it really isn't.  Stripped away of all the legal maneuverings and NTSB investigations...it's the story of an alcoholic.  There is no question that Whitaker's actions were heroic...and there is no question that this man is a danger to himself and others.  The only ethical conflict, really, is the fact that the viewer is inclined to root for this guy to ""get away with it"" because we've spent so much quality time with him.  So one could argue we are complicit in the attempt to enable Whitaker vicariously...but frankly, when you've got an actor as charismatic as Washington, how can you not want things to work out for him?  I hardly felt my conscience stirring because I was somehow crossing my fingers for him.

However, let me say again that the film (despite this serious shortcoming, or overreaching, if you will) is highly entertaining.  Washington is great.  Goodman is hilarious.  Don Cheadle is extremely compelling in his small role.  Bruce Greenwood does solid work.  And best of all in the supporting cast is the relatively unknown Kelly Reilly as a heroin addict who forms a nice, textured relationship with Washington.  Their scenes are probably the best in the film.  The movie is well-paced, often quite tense, frequently quite funny and technically immaculate.  I give it 4 stars, because it is solid & stolid entertainment.  The missing star is for the failed attempt to force something onto this already good story that simply isn't there.",1352073600,5,4638,4.766331658291457
5423375,4,B00AF6B22E,"After a series of mainstream action flicks, Denzel Washington stretches his acting chops again as Whip (really?) Whitaker, a seasoned pilot for a regional airline.  Whip is so good at what he does, that he also manages to bed one of his flight attendants (stunning Nadine Velazquez) and gets plastered the night before seemingly without consequence.

Hung over as he is, he straightens out by polishing off warm beer with a couple lines of cocaine as a chaser.  I don't know if that works in the real world but it does for Whip.  Some of the TV ads give the impression that Whip is a hero by pulling off a Sullenberger landing maneuver (he does) but is being hounded because of a small amount of alcohol was found in his system.  Make no mistake this guy was hammered and should not be flying.

Still with the help of a little vodka, he manages to control a doomed airliner saving the vast majority of the passengers.  Unexpectedly once the NTSB/FAA begins their investigation, Whip feels invincible and doesn't slow down.  Washington performance stands out of course.  He plays a realistic drunk and seems to have all the facial tics, bobs and wrinkles on full throttle.  Washington gets plenty of supporting help along the way.  Kelly Reilly is a reformed druggie that gets involved with Whip after a hospital meet.  Brian Geraghty is Whip's born again co-pilot. Tamara Tunie is the supervising flight attendant and longtime friend.  Bruce Greenwood is Whip's union chief.  Melissa Leo is the lead federal investigator.  Don Cheadle is his lawyer and John Goodman brings some needed comedic relief as Whip's ""Goodtime Charlie"" supplier.

It all works, including the great flight scenes leading up to the crash and some well-placed rock classics.  Director Robert Zemeckis must be the go to director when it comes to simulating plane crashes.  Remember the dizzying ocean ditch in ""Cast Away?""  ""Flight"" is a first class drama filled with excellent performances that follows an extraordinary opening sequence.",1352073600,2,2010,4.9640718562874255
5423376,5,B00AF6B22E,"Moments make heroes not lifetimes, and Denzel Washington's performance of Whip Whitaker in ""Flight"" proves that. While Whip may be a great pilot he's a human being with a lot of problems that take up as much room in his life as his heroism.

Washington's Whitaker is a pilot who we seem from the outset has a lot of problems in his life, an ex-wife, a drinking problem, and a bit of cocaine habit which all might not be so bad if he weren't an airline pilot about to board a flight he's piloting.

The flight starts off rocky, Whitaker takes off through a rainstorm and powers through it to clear air, with a bit of lying to the control tower about what he's doing, the rest of the flight is uneventful until the plane starts to malfunction and to save the plane he flies it inverted before flip it back and landing in a field with only minimal deaths onboard. The rest of the movie deals with how Whitaker deals with his problems and his addictions as its discovered that he was drunk at the time of the crash and the NTSB hearing looms ever closer and jail time is the outcome if he's found negligent.

Washington has one of his best performances in ""Flight"" it's a low key and understated performance and most of it is realized in Whitakers attitude as he moves through the ordeal from a confident and cocky pilot, to a man worried about his future and he tries to influence the testimony of the crew on the airplane, Margaret (Tamara Tunie) and his co-pilot (Brian Gerahty). John Goodman puts in a flamboyant performance as Whitaker's on-call drug dealer and he almost steals the show with a performance that should be over the top but isn't. Kelly Reilly has a great role as Nicole, a heroin addict who moves in with Whitaker but can't take his addictions and denial.

The songs played on the soundtrack are kind of an obvious telegraphing what's going on, but one intriguing aspect was the heartbeat played at appropriate moments.

5423379,4,B00AF6B22E,"This is actually a movie about the life of a pilot, one who makes an impossible landing to save the lives of most of the folks on the plane. So, the plane's crash landing is really secondary to the story of the life of the pilot. This is not the typical airplane crash movie.  Denzel plays an arrogant pilot who has been known to have a drink and is on a self-destructive path to the bone yard.

The movie begins by letting you know that Denzel/Captain Whittaker partied before the flight with a lady.  He takes off in the morning, in a Southjet 227, with 102 people on board headed for Atlanta.  The storm causes a lot of turbulence as he climbs toward a clearing. You already know that the plane gets into trouble and has to crash land.

The whole airplane sequence is at the beginning.  What really makes the movie is Denzel's performance as the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation proceeds to determine the cause of the crash.  It is a top-notch performance by Denzel.

John Goodman says he is Denzel's brother, but whether he is a brother or a business associate, he plays a colorful character.  We also meet a girl named Nicole, who definitely adds to the story line. Great performances by all, this was a really good movie to see.  Not an action film, but a powerful storyline.",1351814400,2,1306,4.542735042735043

8550804,5,B00AF6B22E,Watched this and then watched it again. Denzel Washington is superb. It's about an alcoholic airline pilot so if you are a nervous flier I don't recommend. However if you are in recovery from alcoholism or drug addiction don't miss it. And there is the thread of what a higher power is that runs through it.,1528243200,,307,4.5

8550806,1,B00AF6B22E,"Shows  completely naked women completely! Come on what am I watching porn! Can't me and my boyfriend sit down and enjoy a movie of suspense/action without there being total nudity.. An attractive woman showed her full naked body with waxed bikini lines and all.  I don't think you needed to sere the naked woman walking around in the very first scene.

Ladies do not watch with your boyfriend or husband.",1527897600,,404,4.742857142857143
