3535386,5,B001DO0304,"If you missed this piece about the iconic ship SS United States when it aired selectively on PBS stations around the country, buy this DVD!  It's the story of what has become of a once majestic ocean liner, moored and forlorn at a pier in South Philadelphia.  A history of the ship's glory days and how she came by her present condition and dilemma is lovingly presented. This ship is a floating piece of history and Americana that deserves better, as the DVD recounts.  Once you have seen this movie you'll want to join the SS United States Conservancy and find out how to help save her.
In fact, visit [...] for more information about the SS United States, her current status and a movement underway to restore her to some semblance of her former glory.  SSUSC was instrumental in helping to get this film made and released to DVD.",1239753600,5,833,4.533333333333333
3535387,3,B001DO0304,I thought the movie on the United States was was very  good. I thing the film was sort a waist of money for those that put up the mony to make the film. The ship  has seen her best days  and I realy  think its time for things to  move on she won't  be brought  back its not worth  it and there just is not enought people  who care enought. I hate saying  this  but its true. I think it will go down as a try  to save the  ship  but in the end it will fail.,1237507200,,456,3.5670103092783507
3535388,4,B001DO0304,"We first saw part of this documentary on the local PBS station. I caught my interest as I have good friends who had traveled on the SS United States.
The documentary is well arranged, provides enough detail, and informs and educates about a very proud legacy this country has, but I knew very little about. Very good combination of ""then"" photos with ""now"" video.",1236124800,4,363,4.6875
3535389,5,B001DO0304,"I admit that I have no interest in ships, and only watched this movie at the urging of people I trust. I am SO glad I did, because it was wonderful! I was caught up in the story immediately, and became riveted by this amazing story of the fastest cruise ship ever made. The reason the movie works so well is the way it is crafted, with anecdotes, comments, and reminiscences of people who knew and loved the ship, and stunning visuals of the ship in its glory days superimposed over stark images of the ship as it now rests, decaying slowly in the harbor. There's a great musical score that actually made me cry, especially at the end--and I don't cry easily. Look, all I can say is that no matter whether you love ships or wouldn't walk a block to see the Titanic if it reappeared out of the depths, you'll love this beautifully made, fascinating, funny, and astonishing movie.",1235952000,10,878,4.425925925925926
3535390,5,B001DO0304,"This well-crafted history of America's one and only flagship, the SS United States, is not only informative and entertaining, but perfectly-timed to rouse passion among all of us concerned with preserving this ship for future generations. She now sits, rusted and gutted, in a Philly shipyard with scrap metal vultures circling around.  Her recent sale by Norwegian Cruise Line, who had intended to restore her, has now put her in imminent danger of destruction. She is a one-of-a-kind American icon, in a class with the Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty, and Golden Gate Bridge.  See this film and join the preservation effort!",1235433600,,635,5.155339805825243
3535391,2,B001DO0304,"Having failed, apparently, to properly interpret the title of this item (i.e., ""Lady in Waiting""), I had expected an exhilarating visual history of the great ship in her glory days. Instead, for the most part,what I got was many static pictures of the rotting ship interspersed with far too many earnest talking-head testimonials about how wonderful she was (true) and how she must be saved and restored (in our money-driven world, it ain't going to happen).

Let us hope that whatever the fate of the UNITED STATES(most likely: being subject to the tender mercies of ship breakers in Bangladesh or India, the recent end of the beautiful former FRANCE) let's hope she doesn't wind up like the QUEEN MARY, which has been turned into kind of tarted-up corpse, complete with paper-mache funnels, or some such. If you're a true ocean liner aficionado, you'll find that visiting the MARY today is a really depressing downer.",1235260800,2,919,4.967532467532467
3535392,5,B001DO0304,I found this to be one of the most interesting and detailed insights into this famous and sadly forgotton great ocean liner.,1231200000,,124,4.681818181818182
3535393,5,B001DO0304,"This DVD will bring you joy, and it will also break your heart.  The SS United States was, and still is, the fastest ocean liner ever built.  A generation of American kids built models of her, including this writer.  She was so fast her hull design remained classified for decades.  She was beautiful.  And she was American designed and American built.  She belonged to an era when the US could, and did, design and build astonishing technical marvels.  This is inspiring.

The DVD is also the story of how she has lain abandoned and rusting since the late 1960s, a ghost of her former self.  It is the story of attempts to bring her back to life, thus far unsuccessful.  This will break your heart.  The SS United States deserves to be preserved and honored as one of America's greatest technical achievements.  Hopefully, if enough people are motivated by this DVD, it will happen.

I wish the DVD had more footage of the Big U in her heyday, but I am sure the producers used everything they could find.  The coda of the DVD is absolutely beautiful.  If you love ships and the sea, I strongly recommend this DVD.  The people who made it are committed to the SS United States, and it shows.  A wonderful tribute, and long overdue.",1229904000,13,1231,4.5227272727272725
3535394,5,B001DO0304,"One memory I have of my dad is him taking me to see the SS United States, the subject of Robert Radler's new documentary, when it came to dock in Nerw York Harbor.  I would sit on his shoulders and he would point out, from the dock, the various features of the great ship.  ""There are many liners,"" he said, ""but this one's the grandest ship ever christened.""  He and my mom never went anywhere, they were too bsuy raising a passel of kids out on Long Island, but I remember one time his old wartime buddy and the friend's wife were setting sail on a voyage to Europe, and they invited my parents to a shipboard party before the sail--and I got to go too--course, I was only a tadpole and remember hardly anything except the clouds of confetti that enveloped us everywhere we walked on the huge, wide, sun deck of the United States.  A sun deck big as a supermarket!

When I saw the documentary ""Lady in Waiting"" all these floods of memory came rolling in, but I think the film will work even if you have never heard to the ship before; it is designed to appeal to anyone who has ever sailed anywhere--or ever wanted to, and its clever combination of vintage, newsreel and originally shot footage and contemporary interviews mimics somewhat the easy, almost hypnotic motion of a great craft on the water.

And passion!  The people you will hear and see speaking of their love of the SSUS love the old ""lady in waiting"" (now biding its time in Philadelphia where it has become part of the scenery), and that love shines through every frame of this stirring documentary.  At times you have to pinch yourself and say, ""And this isn't a madeup story, dramatic and inspirational as it is.  By golly, this is real!""

New material supplements well-chosen clips so the feeling throughout is a delicate balance between past and present--the two worlds collide in an eerie, romantic way.  All right, the ship is 700 thousand tons of steel but it comes alive as a living, breathing presence, both in mothballs and in period footage of her glory days.

The whole doc goes by in what seems like minutes.  I can't wait to see what happens with the preservation campaign, more power to the conservancy.  Let it shine as it did for my late father, whose dream it always was to sail away on it.  Sadly, by the time he could raise enough money to take himself and my mom to Europe, the ship he loved had been decommissioned!  Everyone who has ever had a dream should be able to identify with the warm hearts and high hopes of the makers of SS UNITED STATES: LADY IN WAITING.",1229212800,23,2556,4.452789699570816
3535395,5,B001DO0304,"My mom came over here from Germany on the SS United States in 1953, so this was really a gift for her, but it was great for me too to see what it was like travelling back then.  It really makes me want to see the ship restored and put back into service. I'd buy two tickets and go with my mom this time.  Anyway, good DVD, good overview of the ship's history, it's past and present, and hopefully future too.",1227571200,3,408,4.0246913580246915

3535401,5,B001DO0304,Save the S.S. United States I say.  My family and I are fortunate to have sailed on the ship in its early days and have fond memories of our time aboard.  It was outstanding in all aspects.  This is indeed a national icon that needs to be preserved!,1437436800,,249,4.145833333333333
3535402,5,B001DO0304,"Should be required viewing in order to educate folks about the proud history of this ship and her current struggle to ""stay alive"" . . . . a record setting ocean liner that is at risk to be towed to demolition. Wonderful people who love and treasure her and what she represents for this country are working to save her. The video gives the viewer an opportunity to learn about her creation, history, and why it is vital that she be saved from
destruction.",1428019200,,455,4.428571428571429
3535403,5,B001DO0304,"An amazing video about her designer and her journeys, even though her time at sea was short you get an overview of her travels and those that were aboard. It breaks my heart to see her the way she is now, when I was a child she brought me to this country, a journey I will never forget. When she left port from Bremerhafen Germany, there was a flyover by American jets, as the band on shore played Auf Wiedersehen. We went to Le Havre France and Southhampton UK to pick up more passengers, then the crossing began. There was a brass map on the ship where you could see the progress of the journey. It was November and the seas were rough and yet she sped on, cutting through the waves like no other. Her record for speed will not be broken by another ocean liner. She is special and anyone who sailed on this ship has a unique connection to her. When she arrived in New York it was always an event. I will always remember being towed into New York harbor, past the statue of liberty, to my new home, America, where I would be free. Even though I was very seasick on day 2, I will never forget just how special the  SS United States is to me. She deserves to be saved. She never missed a days work and was only out of service to have her bow refit. When in her prime she was magnificent, and in my heart she always will be.",1407715200,,1322,4.104247104247104

3535405,5,B001DO0304,The SS United States is our legacy. We in this country built the fastest passenger liner in the world. And what a beauty she is! This video brings her to life again. She sits in Philadelphia withering away. We as a people need to save her and restore her to her former opulence. I saw her many times when she was in transatlantic service. She was a true Queen.. Speed coupled with beauty. This video is designed to reaquaint us with our ship and our history. Please get this video and watch it. The point is we need to save our ship and our history because she is well worth it! She is an icon!,1392681600,,594,4.173913043478261

We recently moved to Pennsylvania and have driven by this ship many times.  Although the ship is locked up now, he hopes to tour it someday if it is able to be financed for restoration.

3535412,4,B001DO0304,"A great salute to America's flagship, with lots of history and a number of interviews with well-known people. My only real fault is that the general tone is one of having already lost the battle to save her from scrapping - perhaps more realistic than optimistic. Well worth the price, if you're at all interested in liners.",1273190400,3,324,4.701754385964913
3535413,5,B001DO0304,"I live in Philly and see the ship often. When I was 12, I had the pleasure of being able to run around this ship when my family members traveled on it. Back then, you could visit the ships before it sailed.
I will always be watching this DVD, it is very well informative about the SS United States.
If you enjoy ships, seeing one of the ""Grand"" ships of the past, you will enjoy this DVD.
Also, look up the SS United States on the web, you will see how a group is trying to save her.
It is a shame how Philadelphia ignores this ship to restore her and use her as a floating hotel/conference hall/restaurants. Just think, seeing her docked at Penn's Landing at night lit up. But then, when does Philadelphia ever do anything right?",1271203200,4,730,4.258992805755396
3535414,5,B001DO0304,"Very good documentary film on the ship and its history. Would have personally liked a lot more technical detail regarding its construction and capabilities, etc, but that's because I'm of an engineering mindset... Very much enjoyed the film!",1270684800,3,241,5.368421052631579
3535415,5,B001DO0304,This is  a story about one of our nation's greatest treasures! Full disclosure: My dad was the radio officer on the SS United States so this is personal.

8294373,5,B001DO0304,"A respectful tribute to a grand lady.  One can't escape the political implications in watching her decompose in public.  The reality conjures more than one metaphor, be that as it may, this documentary will educate the young in knowing what America and Americans were like 50 years ago and for certain bring back the nostalgia (we who remember) this icon holds in our hearts.",1515369600,,375,4.84375

Instead you get a whole bunch of ""blah, blah, blah"" from the 3rd assistant stoker of the 1962 sailing season.  Half the footage seems to be spliced, generic cruise footage from the 1960s.

  Sadly, I have watched us become so much less of late.  The legal system allows so much to be swept under the rug and the government uses the legal system to route so much of what we had to be proud of.  Our government and legal system are owned by those that like to preach being practical, frugal and efficient by those that have the money and actual power.  I am shamed that the general public has allowed this to come to pass and concentrate on their selves and immediate family.",1509580800,,751,4.159722222222222
