They seem to come off more about the makers than the band. the scenes are terrible and they have to many distractions going on. Too my surprise this was shot fantastic, the point of focus is always the band. Let's face it, it is why you want to see it in the first place. I think it is a great representation of the band live. The Stooges live show is always fantastic. You need this video in your collection.",1325376000,7,578,4.216216216216216
8462046,5,B0058OR3SA,"This Stooges concert shot from six cameras by the fans have Iggy and The Stooges bursting at the seems in this incredibly high energy show. Iggy is in his usually hyped up form but James Williamson guitar is un-freakin' real, playing rhythm and lead at the same time with High Voltage guitar crunch. Bass and drums are great too. These 60 plus year old rockers can out rock bands 40 yrs younger than they are.  Great bonus features too. GET IT,TURN IT LOUD!!!",1522022400,,459,4.530120481927711

8462050,5,B0058OR3SA,"I remember receiving a digital download for the 'Raw Power Live' vinyl lp on a CD-R, but I was simply ecstatic to get the entire gig on this essential live Iggy & The Stooges DVD. Show took place on September 3, 2010 in Monticello, New York at the All Tomorrow's Parties Festival. Keep in mind that this live DVD was filmed by six Stooges fans - very nice. The cinematography here is simply awesome - makes you feel as if you're actually there. It is so nearly unspeakably astounding to experience the Stooges classics being brought back to life as such. First eight songs here is 'Raw Power' it it's brutal entirety. Also dug the rocking ""1970 (I Feel Alright)"", the in-your-face ass-kicking ""I Got A Right"", the Stooges' signature song ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" (I do wish so many other bands would stop covering this tune - as very few do it justice), ""Funhouse"" and ""No Fun"". Worthy many - and I mean a lot od repeated plays in your DVD player in the years to come. So highly recommended, it makes my head hurt.",1460246400,,1011,4.411764705882353

8462052,5,B0058OR3SA,"Iggy Pop and James Williamson together again, performing the most ferocious album ever made, in its entirety (and more).  This DVD is the perfect document of the event, which was literally a dream come true for this writer.  What more needs to be said?",1365206400,,252,4.704545454545454
8462053,5,B0058OR3SA,"This is one on the best DVDs I have. The band is tight, the music sounds great, and they really rock. Along with ""Kiss My Blood"" and ""Avenue B"", you are just amazed by how good this is. I was really surprised by how good it is.",1356220800,2,227,3.851063829787234
8462054,5,B0058OR3SA,"This is nice low budget concert DVD of a fun Stooges show from 2010 in the Catskills with James Williamson on guitar doing Raw Power for All Tomorrow's Parties festival.

A nice documentary style concert video with a plot, of sorts, that doesn't interfere with the actual concert footage.

Think Wayne's World. A contest to win a chance to video the Raw Power show and interview Iggy, with your own equipment at your expense.

I watched the interviews 1st and then the show, so i understood the 6 camera format.

This 6 camera theme is key to the plot as the video jumps around in quality while all six winners are shooting the whole show from various locations. Some cameras are more HD than others, which makes some of the cuts more noticable, it finishes off with the post show interviews where the fans get to ask their questions that won the contest.

The audio is straight from the soundboard and is fantastic, with Iggy unusually clear in the mix.
It sounds better than it did at the show and I was there.",1339200000,7,1012,4.508196721311475
8462055,5,B0058OR3SA,"This concert DVD is by far one of the best live documents of the Stooges bar none. The energy level is through the roof and the band is hotter than hell. James Williamson's guitar is upfront and increbible. He was a much better player than Ashton ever was.
This concert was a showcase to perform the album ""Raw Power"" in it's entirety and the band does a stellar job. Iggy is in A1 form vocally and with his stage presence. He is obviously enjoying himself as much as the audience. Sound quality is excellent. Raw and real. Having five fans film this performance was also a flash of brilliance and the editing is excellent. Part two of this concert has the band performing all the Stooges hits and Williamson does his best to enliven those chestnuts too.
There is an extra that is a lengthy band interview that answers lots of questions and is well worth the price of the DVD in itself.
You would do well to add this concert to your collection if you have any interest in this version of the Stooges.",1332374400,6,1000,4.410810810810811
