8155242,5,B000KA1ITW,"This film, first released in 1975 in theaters, is really well-done and balanced. Peter Graves, formerly of the Mission Impossible TV series, is our host, and really gives it a cool feel. The film focuses mainly on Bigfoot, but devotes brief segments to the Yeti and the Loch Ness Monster, which do not detract from the subject matter at all. Some sightings are included and recreated in the documentary which have not been seen in any medium, printed or otherwise. The major pieces of evidence are analyzed, like photos, footprints, films (including the Patterson/Gimlin film), hair samples, fecal samples, the Minnesota Iceman and other forms of evidence for Bigfoot. Several luminaries in Bigfootery and cryptozoology are featured, including the late Dr. Grover Krantz, Peter Byrne, Robert W. Morgan, Tim Dinsdale, Robert Rines and others. The documentary also discusses the historical accounts of sightings in America and does a great job of documenting the classic Bigfoot stories, like the Albert Ostman story and the Fred Beck story. This documentary is highly recommended.",1198540800,4,1079,5.315789473684211
8155243,3,B000KA1ITW,Im a child of the seventies and that was back when sasquatch was the man! Ive always been a bigfoot fan even though I don't believe he exists I just like the Idea of bigfoot. Anyway I thought this was quite interesting and they did a pretty good job on the make up. Most bigfoot movies or documentarys always have a guy in a cheap monkey suit running around the woods. This documentary made them look more realistic.,1191369600,2,416,4.346153846153846
8155244,4,B000KA1ITW,"In the 70s, if you were doing a show on what would be considered 'paranormal' you got one of two people to narrate, Leonard Nimoy or Peter Graves. This one features Peter Graves and was put out in 1975 by David Wopler productions (who actually put out a couple bigfoot documentaries). As it goes, this is one of the earliest and serious takes on bigfoot. For the time, it was well done and intriguing to the viewers during one of the bigfoot heydays. This documentary is run like a court case with 'exhibits' being put forth in the likes of eye witness testimony, photgraphs, tracks, sound analysis, purported fecal and hair samples and of course the Patterson film. The program runs approx. 90 minutes and includes a 15 minute Loch Ness Monster segment, the rest is all bigfoot. The costumes for the creatures are done by Berman Studios and range greatly in their appearance from pretty good to awful. The encounters tend to be of the scarier versions, thus depicting the creatures as more monster than animal.

As for the dvd - this program doesn't hold up well with time. Besides being dated, there was little effort put into to transfer it to dvd format. There's no cleanup of the images in the program and the sound is actually off in some segments (think badly dubbed kung fu movies). As a whole, the documentary holds up with it's sightings and basics of evidence and while being distinctly 70s, could still run now and be accurate if simple but that's due to other focuses in the field that have arisen since 1975. Overall, one of the best old programs to take the bigfoot phenomenon serious and Peter Graves takes his hosting in equally seriously.",1180310400,,1656,4.651877133105802
8155245,4,B000KA1ITW,"Enjoyable film, other than it was made nearly 30 years ago. There is alot strong evidence in regards to the existence of Bigfoot on this film, if in fact, some of the stories told are actually true...?",1175558400,,201,4.45945945945946
8155246,4,B000KA1ITW,"This is a pretty good place to start if you're interested in bigfoot. It's thorough and keeps the audience interested, I give four stars because I felt they (the film makers) should have reenacted more eyewitness accounts, some of the more hairraising ones I mean. There is a film out there somewhere that was done in the late70's or early 80's that had some scary encounters in it, does anybody remember this film. Anyway this is a solid effort to get the veiwer to think twice about bigfoot. Good film, recommended.",1167091200,,517,4.6923076923076925
8155247,5,B000KA1ITW,"This is the best documentary I have seen on Bigfoot. I mean, I have seen countless movies about Bigfoot and this one takes the cake. There is something about documentaries that were made during the 1970's that just make the subject matter so darn interesting.

 Peter Graves IS the perfect choice for hosting and narrating this ""mysterious monster"". There are some pretty frightening re-enactments of bigfoot sightings as well as a descriptive word that I had never heard used in any context. Peter Graves asks a scientist to ""(watch the film to find out)* what is in his briefcase.

 This is a must see. Get it if you can. D'OH! I almost forgot, they talk about Loch Ness too!!!",1164499200,4,679,4.680672268907563
