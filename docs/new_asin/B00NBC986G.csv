6637605,5,B00NBC986G,Fox is retarded!! Mindy was the best thing on Fox in years! Just glad that Hulu picked it up. Mindy is the best comedy out there. The outtakes are HILARIOUS!! I love when she brings in dramatic actors to play these zany characters. Lee Pace for one. Tate Ellington was particularly hilarious in this season three. Gurglar!! Lol!! Timothy Olyphant in season 2 was an unexpected treat! Everyone looks like they're having a blast & can barely keep a straight face.,1475280000,,461,4.703703703703703

6637612,3,B00NBC986G,I originally loved this show but honestly I feel like they need to do something to freshen it up.  But I really enjoy seeing Mindy in a feature role because we definitely need more diversity on tv.,1453852800,,197,4.324324324324325
6637613,5,B00NBC986G,Love Mindy Kaling and she really has an amazing show here. It's funny and tends to be a bit racy (for network television.) I really enjoy it. Grab the first two seasons so you will know what's going on and get the most out of the jokes!,1453680000,,236,4.042553191489362

6637618,5,B00NBC986G,"Very funny, always witty and Mindy & Danny have amazing chemistry. They start as rivals, become friends and then the most wonderful couple! It is a rare pleasure to watch a show that can put the ""it couple"" together and not constantly throw lame roadblocks in their happiness path. Once Mindy & Danny are together the show just gets better and better.",1446940800,,351,4.67741935483871

6637627,2,B00NBC986G,SO disappointing! After a very funny and entertaining Season 1 and 2 - the third season is very flat - with the occassional funny bit. BUT VERY occassional..... Sadly this one is not funny at all - no highlights - no laughs - not recommendable.,1442880000,3,244,4.444444444444445

6637632,5,B00NBC986G,"Love this show. Season 3 isn't as great as the first two seasons, but I enjoyed it nonetheless and laughed out loud frequently.",1441065600,,127,4.565217391304348
6637633,5,B00NBC986G,"The Mindy Project could arguably be called one of the, if not the best, romantic situation comedy ever created.  The characters are obviously flawed, but are written as continuing to evolve through the series.  Kaling is not afraid to make her own character look ridiculous, to lead characters into taboo situations (the ""anal"" episode), and acknowledges the ebb and flow of success and failure of herself and the characters surrounding her.  Some devolve or disappear, some have acquired drug issues, and others continue to grow, slowly, but relapse into pre-programmed behavior they've always exhibited.

Chris Messina is frustratingly perfect as her romantic lead, always battling a lifetime of wounds just below his character's surface.  The writing/dialogue is hilarious, poignant, humane, and more cinematic than sitcom.  The season one finale's final scene is perfection of nuance, combining disappointment and unrequited desire in a way other great sitcoms have never even approached.  Season two continued the chemistry and development between Kaling and Messina's characters, introducing comedic talents like Adam Pally and Ike Baronholtz to the cast.  Season three expands the cast yet again, as Rhea Perlman plays Danny's(Messina) mom and Dan Hedaya plays his dad, and Messina's character's motivations/compulsions have their origins developed.  The comedic scenes never fail to make me laugh out loud.  I'm not sure why this show continues to be ignored by the Emmy crowd, nor why Fox bafflingly decided to cancel, but none of this is a detraction from some of the consistently best television around.  The Mindy Project is well worth your time.",1440806400,,1658,5.4375
6637634,3,B00NBC986G,While I loved the first two seasons this season lagged a bit. I found the same old gags to be predictable and the characters just playing out the same scenes over and over. It was however still funny at times.,1440201600,,209,4.25
6637635,5,B00NBC986G,Thank goodness Hulu picked up this show!!!! Can't wait for the new season in September!!,1439856000,,88,4.933333333333334
6637636,5,B00NBC986G,Begore becoming a Mindy Project junkie I rolled my eyes at the goofy commercial trailers. After watching the first episode we all became hooked and chomp on our nails while laughing and crying along with our favorite characters. Mindy is a MUST for all adults!,1439769600,,260,4.8

6637648,5,B00NBC986G,"Hilarious!!! I definitely recommend this show as it is well written, witty, has great characters and is a highly entertaining comedy. Definitely better than anything I have seen in a long while, if ever. It is a bit raunchy so that makes it hard when my younger children (pre-teen and teen) want to get in on what's making me laugh out loud. Some episodes I would rate as R while others mostly PG/PG-13?",1431734400,,403,4.534246575342466
6637649,4,B00NBC986G,"Even it's weaker episodes bring the laughs.

The Mindy project continues to be hilarious in its 3rd Season, and even though it was cancelled by Fox, fans can rest easy... the series has been picked up by Streaming service HULU for a 26 episode 4th Season, which means we will see how the cliffhanger at the end of this Season gets resolved.",1431648000,,340,4.483870967741935

6637652,5,B00NBC986G,Love this series! Mindy Kaling is so funny and talented.,1430352000,,56,4.7
6637653,4,B00NBC986G,"Dr. Mindy Lahiri (Mindy Kaling) has finally gotten together with longtime colleague/crush/sometime rival Dr. Danny Castellano (Chris Messina). But of course, nothing in Mindy's life ever can or does go smoothly. First there's dealing with their kooky colleagues at OB-GYN practice Shulman & Associates. Then there's the family angle...and finally, fully accepting all the changes themselves.

Mid-season, the biggest change of all comes along...but despite the shock, Danny and Mindy have to barrel along together. His meddling mother Annette (Rhea Perlman) might feel otherwise, though.

Meanwhile, Mindy's doing a fellowship at Stanford, where she must decide whether she wants to return to New York or not when the opportunity to open a fertility clinic arises.

Back at Shulman, Drs. Jeremy Reed (Ed Weeks) and Peter Prentice (Adam Pally) continue to compete over Lauren (Julia Stiles), and Morgan (Ike Barinholtz) is sure to be underfoot with his usual good-intentioned confusion and mishaps.

No matter what Mindy, Danny and their friends are up to, it's bound to be full of witty dialogue and pop culture references, culminating in lots of laughs.",1430265600,,1154,5.430167597765363
6637654,5,B00NBC986G,"this show make me literally laugh out loud, not many shows do that at all.",1430265600,,74,4.0
6637655,2,B00NBC986G,"I hope this does not reflect how shallow our values have become. The acting is truly sad/ The characters displayed as people who seem to think that we are all entitiled for what ever we want, There were times that this piece played like a teen had written it. No one delivers a clever line though out the entire thing. I am just saying that this is just absurd. What a waste of time!",1430092800,3,383,4.1891891891891895

6637657,5,B00NBC986G,This season was absolutely amazing! Her witty writing staff clearly knew what they were doing when they wrote season 3. I can only hope that the fans will get to see what happens in season 4! We NEED a season 4! Also this will be a great edition to my Mindy seasons collection on dvd!,1428796800,,284,4.181818181818182

6637665,5,B00NBC986G,"TMP season finales never fail to dissappoint, and this one is no exception. I love how Mindy (Kaling) can make Mindy (Lahiri) so confident and almost accidentally irreverant, but still make her real, soft, and tender - like I think most women feel about themselves. We are a mix of complete unbridled confidence and vulnerable insecurity. Laughter and tears, well balanced with a great wardrobe, and a great soundtrack, too! I worried that the season would have suffered because that's what happens with the leads FINALLY get together (Castle, anyone?) but TMP hasn't really missed a beat. Can't wait for more!",1427328000,,610,5.0495049504950495
6637666,4,B00NBC986G,"Like others have said, this is a good show, and it was even better when it was a workplace comedy.  The turn to it being about intimate relationship and pregnancy is much less interesting and less funny to me.  That being said, I applaud Mindy Kaling for being so awesome and creating, writing and starring in her own show.",1427241600,,323,4.4576271186440675

6637694,3,B00NBC986G,"These two (Danny & Mindy)  got together way too quickly.  The show was funnier before they hooked up.  Morgan and Taisha were enough of an office fling to keep us going for a while.  Also- to each his own, but the episode ""I Slipped"" was TMI for me so I wasn't interested enough to finish watching that episode.  The other episodes were just ok.

I know a lot of fans do, but I just don't feel like those two suit each other and it feels a little forced. I thought Mindy was much more interesting going out there trying to find a guy that fit her ideal, and we got to explore her character more as she moved from each love interest. Also, where are her girl friends that used to hang around all the time? I thought they were great, we have not seen any of them this season.

She reminds me of many people I know in one!!!!  It's a breath of fresh air to watch a sitcom that's intelligently written, hip, and funny.  I teach advanced ESL and my students LOVE it too, they learn lots of new vocabulary and slang which they need.  I bought season 1 and 2 and can't wait to buy 3!!!!!  I also love Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm.",1415404800,4,500,4.369565217391305

8677176,2,B00NBC986G,"I know Season 4 has not run to completion, but I want to warn those of you who may be considering watching it: The writers have run out of steam. The first four episodes are terrible, and Mindy has become very unlikable, as I see it. She always was shallow, a glutton, flighty, etc. Now, she's more so, and showing just how fickle and vapid she is. I started disliking her after reading part of her book (I couldn't complete it) and I think that added to my dislike of this final season. In the end, for me, it's a matter of good riddance!",1506470400,,539,4.1923076923076925
