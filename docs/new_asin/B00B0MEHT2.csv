8560332,2,B00B0MEHT2,"When I ordered this movie, I thought it was pricey. It cost me 8.99 altogether. And then a few days later, I seen that I could have gotten it cheaper from somebody else. The cheaper prices were posted AFTER I had paid for my order. After I had gotten my movie, I was very disappointed because it was about how they made a movie about making a parade. It was a very boring documentary with interviews of people who made the parade. I wouldn't recommend anybody buying this movie unless you like this kind of movie. I thought I would see the Santa on the front of the case but, I never seen him. I guess he was just a picture to help sell the movie.",1371081600,2,647,4.142857142857143
