3529309,5,B001DGFGOU,"What a masterly film! What a shock! The viewer is taken to trippes at heart and shaken in all directions. This film is exceptional. To let be yourself more engrossed by such a film would probably be too much for the nerves, both the intensity is violent, acute, sharp.

How to succeed in giving birth to a prison friendship between two women who have nothing in common except a true passion for the piano with a lot of patience, tenacity and tolerance is btilliantly shown in this film ? What a superb story!

The viewer is not indemn from such a projection. The final ""four minutes"" of the film is dazzling.

It is a great film issued by the German cinema that never ceases to surprise us with happiness ( ""Good-bye Lenin!""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Bye-Lenin/dp/B000274THQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Bye, Lenin!</a>, ""The Lives of Others""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lives-of-Others/dp/B000V4NX04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lives of Others</a>).",1220832000,6,1061,6.204081632653061
3529310,5,B001DGFGOU,"This movie was quite an experience.  The story takes place in a Nazi prison I think near the end of the war.  The principal character was a young woman in prison for murder . . . and she was somewhat of a piano prodigy.  An old piano teacher tries to teach her more, and bring her up to competition level.  The story is very disturbing, with some graphic scenes of Nazi brutality, but overall a barn burner, with an anticlimactic finish!  Despite the difficult story line, I did enjoy the movie.  You really don't know the significance of Four Minutes until the end.  The acting was outstanding!",1402012800,,595,4.5046728971962615
3529311,5,B001DGFGOU,"Gertrud (Monica Bleibtreu) is an elderly, uptight piano teacher who works at a women's prison. She has few students, none of whom are promising. Then one day, Jenny (Hannah Herzsprung)--who is as violent as she is talented--signs up for lessons.

What follows is a fresh approach to the mentor-mentee story. Yes, the two main characters have to work out their differences and end up becoming close. And yes, there is the inevitable be-all, end-all competition at the end.  But what makes ""Four Minutes"" stand out is how destructive Jenny is.

Viewers are never sure if or when she will snap. You get the feeling that Jenny could kill frail Gertrud anytime she wanted.  And that's what makes it so much more exciting than other films with a similar central relationship. This movie is fierce, not cloying.

""Four Minutes"" serves up plenty of tension. Director Chris Kraus has created a seamless film. There are no wasted scenes, and sometimes the camera rapidly turns corners to draws the audience closer to the screen.

Herzsprung is mesmerizing as the troubled former prodigy, while Bleibtreu's stiff upper lip and owlish expression invite both discomfort and pity. The film has heartbreak, as well as vibrant bursts of comedy.

Well.....I wasn't dissappointed in the least, it was excellent...in one of the reviews for this movie someone mentioned ""The Piano"" staring Holly Hunter (who won her acadamy award for best actress for her role) this movie was VERY different from that one, but just as emotionally intense and subperbly executed....the piano playing alone makes this movie worth watching!!!",1354147200,,664,4.884955752212389

3529316,4,B001DGFGOU,"I enjoyed this film a great deal because it was in German and a great opportunity to attempt to understand it without the sub titles; however, the graphic violence was a little too much. It was exciting, but extreme. It was also a little far fetched, at times quite believable and then into the realm of improbability. Neverthless, it was entertaining and held my interest to the very end. If you can handle the violence, then this is an excellent film that you will definitely enjoy.",1337904000,,484,4.6395348837209305
3529317,5,B001DGFGOU,"Absolutely stunning movie. There is no question of the acting ability of the two stars, and sadly no question that a free society (even) can railroad an innocent woman into prison because it is easier to prosecute than to find out the truth.",1331510400,,241,4.627906976744186
3529318,5,B001DGFGOU,"I can't even stress how great this movie is.  Someone sat down and really wrote a magnificent movie.  Yes, it is about lesbianism, but only as a ""love lost"" theme.  It is so much more.  It plays like a female version of another great movie, ""Finding Forester"".

I was impressed with the several sub-narratives that are intertwined around one main story: An aged piano teacher, who has worked at a women's detention center teaching piano and looking for the perfect student, is brought a young prisoner piano prodigy with a horrible past.  The two women attempt to break down their social and prejudicial barriers, find empathy with one another, and find some sense of closure in their lives.  Releasing deep, personal pains through the art of music and unleashing anger physically is what repressed memories bring as the story unfolds.  There is the story of a self-absorbed warden who wants to be noticed, a prison guard who, after being both humiliated by having his rear kicked by the prodigy and losing the teacher's sole attention, attempts to get even with both, and a step-father/daughter relationship whose dark past is faced.

Even more important to me (and is the main, parallel narrative) is the story that flashes back to the Nazi era, telling the story of the piano teacher (then, a nurse for the war effort) and how her forbidden relationship killed her love as well a part of her soul.  She attempts to rectify and analyze this past through the prodigy, but still keeps those memories repressed, causing the prodigy to question the teacher's motives.

Yes, the entire movie is multi-layered and multi-dimensional, touching on themes of guilt, sorrow, and closure.  The conclusions to each of the narratives is haunting, deeply personal, and, in two cases, (semi-) non-predictable.

I don't want to give away the entire complex, but overall satisfying, story.  It is well-rounded, with a wonderful ending.  Bittersweet and moving, with some humor in between.  Movies like this do not come around often enough.

Excellent acting all-around, with great direction, cinematography, and music.  Highly recommended!

5 of 5.  I am happy I bought this DVD.",1331078400,4,2163,5.022471910112359
3529319,5,B001DGFGOU,"Don't know how to put it any other way but to say that this is an extraordinary, brilliant, gorgeously acted and directed movie.  I am a connoisseur of foreign and indie films and this is one of my favorite movies; if not my outright favorite.  A must see and own for any connoisseur of foreign film...  Just buy it!  Five stars is not enough.",1330041600,,343,4.3125
3529320,4,B001DGFGOU,"""Four Minutes"" may have been based, in part, upon the real person to whom the film is dedicated, one Gertrud Krger, who passed away in 2004, at 87, and who would have been about the same age as the principal character, the music teacher, ""Traude Krger,"" at the time her female lover in the story was set to be executed in a Nazi prison near the end of WWII.

The cover picture on the DVD is a misleading, sex-sells, studio redressing, an exaggeration of the story setting and characters.  The film, winner of many international awards, is set in contemporary Germany (English subtitles), with flashbacks to the war, and the emphasis is certainly not on sex or the war-time, lesbian love affair of the piano teacher's youth, but rather, how that love and the loss of it shaped her purpose through the rest of her life, and how she saw, in her piano student, Jenny, a unique opportunity to fulfill that purpose:  the celebration and cultivation of beauty, proclaimed as she scolded Jenny at a turning point in their relationship, late in the story, rhetorically asking her, ""What else are we here for?""

The story centers on the relationship of the spinster piano teacher (Monica Bleibtreu) with her troubled student, Jenny (Hannah Herzsprung), a prison inmate who would be a poster girl for Gothic if she could choose her wardrobe, a victim of child abuse, convicted of a brutal murder, but who, throughout most of her childhood, cultivated her natural gift for music, specifically, playing piano.  The two come together as flame to the fuse when the teacher takes her on as one of only four students in the prison's ""piano program.""

There are few light moments, but they are all-the-more striking for their sparseness.  And the story poses questions, unfolds the answers, and invests the viewer in the characters sufficiently to hold interest into the climax, where statements, subtle and bold, of both lead characters are gestured and acted-out with consummate skill, Jenny's musical piece at the final competition, played before a packed concert hall, intended to be ""Schumann's Concert in A Minor,"" turning into a classic-rock mix that is as remarkable for its style as the way it speaks for Jenny, her final bow to her teacher in the audience wrapping up the concert and their relationship, conveying an understanding that is reached between the two with an expression on Jenny's face that lingers in the mind along with the story as the credits roll.",1309564800,,2456,4.875299760191846
3529321,5,B001DGFGOU,"Four minutes is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The story is very close to the reality of prison life today. It is tragic that so many lives are wasted in torturous conditions we think are keeping us ""safe"".",1309046400,,214,4.2439024390243905
3529322,5,B001DGFGOU,"I usually don't enjoy this type of film but it kept my interest. ""Women in prison"" are not my forte. The characters were very well done.

3529324,5,B001DGFGOU,"This is a very nuanced character study of an angry, abused young woman of great talent, and the old woman who tries to help her.  Very interesting representation of German society, prison life, abuse and how it turns the abused person against self and others and a deeply felt, if not profound, idea regarding the ultimate meaning of life.  Thought provoking.  Highly recommended.

So many of the tags are related to sexual identity.  This is a very limited focus.  The older woman was able to look at the younger objectively as a creative being with some choices that could give her life great meaning.  Others, unfortunately mostly men, had all seen her as something to be used.  The teachers effort is not a matter of ""lesbianism"" but of her ability to help her student move forward.

3529326,5,B001DGFGOU,"I saw this movie just a few minutes ago. American viewers need to keep in mind that there is very little of Hollywood and special effects in this movie. Actually, it is a clear example of how it is still possible to make a movie without a trillion dollar budget. It is an excellent movie from start to finish. The music is exquisite, the camera work is skillful and sufficient given the complexity of the theme and the acting is remarkable. Unlike most German films, this one moves fast and keeps you interested. A must see!
I disagree with the one star critique, although I respect his/her viewpoint. The movie is about a gifted person who has been forced to keep an unusual and complex talent bottled up. Since I am a teacher, I know that a person with these characteristics sometimes only needs a word at the right moment to let her creativity explode.",1251936000,4,855,4.52258064516129

3529328,5,B001DGFGOU,"Not cheerful, and neither of the two main characters are particularly likeable.  But, as you find out more about their past, the characters' actions are understandable. We really enjoyed it, and my daughter, who plays piano, was truly inspired by the piano in the movie.  I'm not the first to write this, but the piano playing is incredible four-minute contest piece at the end is unforgettable.  The acting is great. I'm more of a happy-ending type person, and even I have to admit this was a very good movie.
/////////////////////////
I'm adding something to my initial review. After I reviewed this film, I noticed that my amazon.com recommendations were full of movies with a lesbian theme.  This surprised me, because though one character in ""Four Minutes"" is lesbian, it's not a theme of the movie as we saw it.  It would be too bad if you didn't watch this movie because of pigeonholing by amazon or anyone else. It's a well acted movie with two female leads, one who supresses her pain and rage, the other who lets the rage take over, and the music that brings them together. I very much recommend this movie for the raw emotion and exceptionally well-drawn characters.

Happy Reader",1237680000,40,1191,4.785365853658536
3529329,3,B001DGFGOU,"Yes, the storyline is compelling, the music score is beautiful, and the set is suitable. However, it is not a well-done movie. It seems all the characters in the movie are obsessed with Jenny for one reason or anothert, but Jenny manifests extreme violence towards others and is always very angry(those who are obsessed include the piano teacher, the jailers, psychiatrist, the journalist from der spiegel no less, the father, the fellow inmates, etc.). At no time in the movie one feels sympathetic to Jenny, and one would care less about her piano talent when she beats up her way including almost killing a very nice prison guard who was pleading with the teacher to accept her as a pupil. And then when the teacher does take jenny and devotes herself to helping her, the teacher only gets snarls and animosity from jenny, and at one point Jenny violently assaults the teacher and hits her on the forehead head.. Oh this murderous Jenny who has a talent for music!! There is something missing in this movie that the teacher's focus was only on the music talent of Jenny and she would never engage Jenny beyond that point. Towards the end of the movie, the teacher speaks to jenny with authority to get her to participate in the competition. But we are not convinced why such a stubborn, hard-headed, very angry, violent girl suddenly changes her mind and agrees to participate. Why waste 120 minutes just to get to the point where jenny accepts and changes in a jiffy? And why? because the piano teacher spoke to her nicely but firmly about her future.

The concert at the end where Jenny is applauded in the deutsche opera haus is well-acted and deserves stars. However, I did not like this movie.",1228003200,6,1701,4.688963210702341

*** In German with English subtitles ***

Traude Krger (Monica Bleibtreu) is a strict and icy 80 yr old spinster who gives piano lessons to inmates at a German women's penitentiary.  She's hard and set in her ways.  It's classical music only that she teaches to her, eh, less than stellar students.  Few bother to take lessons with her.  When a new inmate comes in full of fire and talent... and intense anger and violence, Traude calmly takes her on and demands submission and discipline.  And because Jenny is desperate for an opportunity and outlet to release her emotionally driven music, she does indeed submit.  The elderly piano teacher instantly recognizes Jenny's amazing talent and makes it her mission to focus this musical prodigy... which she envisions culminating in a grand and very prestigious musical competition.

There will be some spoilers ahead.

And so begins this interesting and sometimes volatile bond.  As their relationship progresses, we get their traumatic backstories and the demons that spiritually stunt them both.  Jenny's (Hannah Herzsprung) history of abuse and loss is clear and understandable; however, Traude's past during WWII as a nurse amidst the Nazi's is a bit murky and weakly integrated into the present. She had a lesbian affair and lost her passionate love to the Nazi violence.  Despite her own talent and potential in her youth... it seems this loss has emptied her of all spirit, affection, and passion ever since... forevermore leaving her to dwell aimlessly among talentless criminals and madwomen for 60 yrs. Her own self-imposed life sentence.  Though I came to these conclusions with the information given, I still think so much more could have been shown from her past to clarify what Jenny is awakening in Traude.

Now don't be mislead by the DVD cover or the women-in-prison genre.  This is NOT a lesbian-themed story.  It's a relationship drama, yes, but not a sleazy one with sex or anything.  One lead just happens to be a lesbian.

There are some very beautiful and emotional moments in this film.  The final ""four minutes"" are just mesmerizing.  And the idea that a ""four minute"" reprieve is all you get from a life sentence of loss is truly heartbreaking- for both of them.  These things you will love about the film.  And yet it feels flawed and unbalanced in the telling. It is very moving, though you might not entirely understand why without analyzing and filling in a few holes yourself.  Perhaps much was simply lost in translation for me... have thought about watching it again.  Still.  The acting is superb by our two leads and the more powerful moments will stick with you long after you've seen it.",1407196800,2,2684,4.908888888888889
