887426,3,6304410433,"I see that this film, the sequel to ""Terms of Endearment,"" has  recieved either great reviews or awful reviews in this forum. The truth is,  it is somewhere in between. Shirley MacLaine is a delight as Aurora  Greenway, Marion Ross holds her own as Aurora's Maid, and I thought Ben  Johnson's performance was beautifully understated and effective. But the  plot founders in  several areas: the affair between Aurora and her  Therapist (Bill Paxton) is unbelievable and borders on nasty (think  ""Autumn in New York"" in reverse); there are too many characters  that don't get developed as needed; and some scenes drown in pathos. Whereas James L. Brooks took a more deft approach to the tragi-comedy of ""Terms,"" Robert Harling unleashes the dying with a vengence here. The  ash-scattering scene on the beach is way over the top (with deafening music  to accompany it) and Aurora's grandchildren range from annoying to  unbearable. Juliet Lewis' character vitually disappears half way through  and Miranda Richardson's phony Texas accent is painfully overdone. Oddly, the pace escalates suddenly in the film's last half hour as Harling struggles to tie up loose ends - perhaps they were over budget and had to finish in a hurry.  This  film is worth a look for sure, but it isn't in the same league with  ""Terms.""",968976000,2,1310,4.967741935483871
887427,4,6304410433,"In The Evening Star, the sequel to 1983's Oscar-winning predecessor Terms of Endearment, Aurora (Shirley MacLaine) picks up where she left off.
The saga now continues with her dead daughter's beleaguered offspring, and  Granny Aurora just ain't doing so well. Her heart is, as always, in the  rightest of places. Every week she's in the state pen visiting Tommy  (George Newbern), but he's content to toss her homemade brownies in the  trash. Teddy (Mackenzie Astin) drives a tow truck and has a little brat of  his own. Most belligerent is Melanie (Juliette Lewis). Like the others,  she's still angry over her mother's death and more often than not takes it  out by doing whatever she feels like, much to the chagrin of Aurora.
All  these problems drive Aurora into the arms of Jerry (Bill Paxton), a  much-younger therapist who, like Albert Brooks in Mother, has some kind of  unresolved Oedipal conflict to work out. Their scenes together are cute and  sexy.
The film's sentimentality is overshadowed by the pure spunk of  MacLaine's portrayal. And her perennial nemesis Patsy (Miranda Richardson)  more than keeps Aurora's blood pumping.
It's fun to see MacLaine in this  role again. She imbues Aurora with a warmth and trueness that reminded me  how much I had missed her. Even the third act cameo by Jack Nicholson as  astronaut Garrett went down easy.
Perhaps best of all is Marion Ross  (Yo, Mrs. C.!), who gives a  lovely performance as Rosie, Aurora's maid.",957916800,8,1468,4.922448979591837
887428,3,6304410433,"The prequel to this movie, ""Terms of Endearment"", has been a  favorite of mine for many years.  I love it, and I was thrilled when they  announced a sequel in the makings.

I wish I could give this film five  stars, but the first hour is touch and go.  The acting is superb, but the  story line leaves a lot to be desired.  I had a hard time believing in the  love affair of the older (grandmother!) Mrs. Greenway and her young  therapist.  And the motivations behind the affair were pretty disgusting.
 The first hour wasn't all bad, though.  The trials and tribulations of  the rest of the family and family friends are touching, engaging and  realistic.
 Once we ditch the shrink, the movie really gets good!  Again, the acting is superb and the evolution of the Mrs. Greenway and her  grandchildren is gripping.  Where I was shocked and distanced from the  film during the first hour, during the second I was completely engrossed.
 Thinking back to 'Terms' we know that Mrs. Greenway is pretty wacky,  and her grand children had a tough childhood to over come.  The movie  begins with all of them just as screwed up as you would expect from  'Terms'.  Aside from the kinky affair, this movie is about overcoming  death with love, albeit tough love in the Aurora Greenway tradition.
  If you loved ""Terms of Endearment"", I promise you want to watch  the movie.  It has its moments that you will want to forget, but it has so  many moments that you will remember and love.  The movie's ending is not  kich or contrived, but unique, and appropriate to this rather nutty family.

  I've wondered about Emma's family since I first saw ""Terms of  Endearment"" years ago.  ""The Evening Star"" completes her  story.",957052800,,1709,4.604026845637584

887693,3,6304410433,This is a sequal to Terms Of Enderment and 4 stars. The movie takes place almost 20 years later where the kids have grown. The oldest grandson is in jail with a second possession charge and is angry over his past. The second grandson is under poverty level and has a GF and son and the youngest is a rebel she leaves with her BF for California and gets dumped by him when he becomes a hot new face on commercials. She asks her moms best friend Patsy for help where that annoys her grandma. who consider Patsy an outsider. She meets a new social worker who helps her see things differently and awakens feelings in her. an old friend of her past shows up to visit and they remiss on what friendship they had. This sequal is sort of a bittersweet movie that's like leaving home and returning some time after you left.,1457308800,,814,4.292207792207792

888104,4,6304410433,"I grew up on Terms of Endearment! My mom took me to see it when I was a boy, and it has always remained one of my favorite films. When I got a little older, I read the excellent book by Larry McMurtry and it's even better sequel The Evening Star. The film version doesn't quite top the original, but it's still excellent with an incredible cast! Larry McMurtry pens the screenplay  adapting his novel, and Shirley MacLaine returns as the formidable Aurora Greenway. Also doing an incredible turn as brash Texas socialite Patsy is Mirada Richardson, one of my favorite British actresses. The whole cast is phenomenal! It's fascinating for a fan of the original to see how all of the characters cope and change after the death of Emma. I think the main thing that holds this film back from the brilliance of the original is the writing. This sounds crazy because the author of the novel adapted his own book, but I can only imagine that writing a great novel and writing a great screenplay are two very different animals and the original novel is nothing if not brilliant!",1421625600,2,1070,4.572916666666667

888187,3,6304410433,"It's so easy to bash this poor movie in comparison to its predecessor, but Terms of Endearment is, in my opinion, the best film ever made and even if you don't agree with me, the facts speak for themselves.. the amazing cast, the awards including Best Picture. A very hard act to follow. To enjoy this vastly inferior sequel you must treat it as a stand-alone film, if possible. Forget where it came from and just enjoy the characters.

I'm reviewing my old original release DVD which I purchased in July of 2006. The picture quality leaves much to be desired. Colors seem uneven. The film looks pretty rough on my 32"" 720p screen. Watchable but noticeably bad. Michael Gore's original themes have been adapted here by someone who had the nerve to take a 'Music by' credit for Mr. Gore's work. It sounds beautiful in 5.1. This isn't an effects movie so there's nothing really to shine in a surround mix other than the music.

In typical old school Paramount DVD fashion, extras are sparse. You get the trailer and a snoozefest of a commentary track by the director, who takes long pauses.. I'd say nearly as long as Rob Reiner does in his commentaries. Very frustrating. What he does say is not especially enlightening.

To sum it up, we have a movie that ranks only among better TV movies (which isn't a compliment to a theatrical film). A DVD that presents the film rather poorly, and no bonus features worth getting it for... yet I still have to recommend it to 'Terms' fans because you need to see the continuation of the story, even if it pretty much sucks. LOL. I cannot recommend paying the current price of the 'Archive' version of the disc. This should be a bargain bin disc. Don't pay over $5 to see this thing.",1413072000,4,1721,4.527331189710611

Shirley MacLaine is at her cantankerous yet warmhearted best as the perfectionist, Aurora Greenway, plowing her way through the lives of all those who love her in ways she seems completely unaware of.  We've all had someone like Aurora in our lives and we all know that we have no choice but to just shut up and love them.  This movie reminds us why.  Marion Ross is brilliant as Rosie Dunlop, Aurora's lifelong companion and maid.  Miranda Richardson nearly steals the show as Patsy, the rich bitch trouble-making best friend of Aurora's deceased daughter (Terms of Endearment).  Jack Nicholson is, as always, the perfectly imperfect hero that the audience secretly hopes will be the answer to what's missing in Aurora's life.... this treat is one to buy and watch over and over again when you just want to feel good about being human...",1409270400,3,1001,4.691428571428571

888339,5,6304410433,"""The Evening Star"" is Larry McMurtry's sequal to the Oscar winning"" Termsof Endearment"".Of course ,these were novels that later became movies. McMurtry wrote quite a few novels and followed them up with sequels. Probably, his best known novel that was turned into a movie was ""Lonesome Dove"".
 His novels are mostly stories set in Texas. That is not unexpected as he is a native son of Texas,and after a number of years operating bookstores in Boston and Washington D.C., he returned to Texas and is now trying to realize his dream of making Archer City into a city of bookstores and booklovers. Most of his books are either westerns,or about times in Texas during the depression.
 ""The Evening Star"" and ""Terms of Endearment"" are all together different. These novels are set in the  the 60's and later. The characters and relationships are much more like the those portrayed in the popular TV Series ,""Dallas"".
 As in all of his novels ,McMurtry excels in storytelling and character development.
 It's little wonder that movies were made on the basis of these book;as I wouldn't hesitate in saying that all of his novels would make excellent movies.
 The first of McMurtry's novels I read is one that not too many remember or have even heard of was ""Cadallic Jasck"".This too,would make a great movie.
 McMurtry develops great characters,and the reader really gets the feeling that McMurtry actually develops his characters on people he has known.
 His characters are anything but cookie-cutter type,but differ greatly. The other thing about his characters is that as unusual as they are,I can't think of a single character that I didn't like.
  McMurtrys books are great reads and even greater movies. McMurtry is certainly one of Americas great writers;and I put him in the same class as Steinbeck,Twain,Caldwell and such.",1394668800,2,1824,5.009933774834437

888406,5,6304410433,"In rememberance of the sequel to Terms of Endearment, Shirley MacLaine reprises her role as Aurora bringing up the 3 children that her daughter left behind after her demise from Cancer. The movie indicates how she must struggle with the Generation Gap between hers and the kids which have now grown up to lead lives of their own but actually still have not left the nest. One of her boyfriends, a retired US General suddenly dies during a get together with her maid and the next door widower neighbor, and to my dismay, the funeral was small with a little group attending the services. I am a retired Army veteran, and I have never seen a General's funeral like this. Usually there is someone playing TAPS, Honor Guard, etc. I guess he could have willed not to have all the ceremony, but most of the family still allows it. So I was very surprised this group was small with no ceremony at all. Her maid played by Marion Ross of Happy Days fame, is an excellent actress in her own right. She played the maid and finally, when she was sick; those scenes were different for all of us because she never displayed her talents like she did in this movie; Happy Days would not allow her to. I had to admit I loved the fight scene between Aurora and Patsy on the plane. An excellent sequel even though it was not as popular as Terms of Endearment.",1382659200,,1339,4.403225806451613

I saw this movie for FREE on my Amazon Prime Membership using my Kindle and a cable to connect to my TV.

Umm ... I can barely remember Terms of Endearment.  She dies, right?  So, this sequel takes place about 10 to 15 years later and those little kids are all grown up and they don't act as though they grew up in posh River Oaks.  They act more as though they are poor trailer trash -- but what do I know about River Oaks or Trailer People?

Here's what I really like about this movie:  Shirley Maclaine and the whole cast.  Honestly, Juliette Lewis could actually be Debra Winger's spawn.  Great roles for Shirley and Marion Ross.  George Newbern who plays Emma's eldest boy all grown up ACTS like that angry little son from the original movie.  You can believe that it's the same kid all grown up.  Bill Paxton, Miranda Richardson, Ben Johnson, Mackenzie Astin -- all good casting.  A great unexpected surprise was to see Jack Nicholson make a good, short, appearance.

The problems with this shamelessly manipulative movie are many, and they all begin with the inevitable premise that tough Texas matron Aurora Greenway can carry on without being challenged by her feisty daughter Emma. However, without Debra Winger's earthy grit counterbalancing Shirley MacLaine's flamboyant disapproval, the story seems to work in a vacuum. Much of the appeal and resonance of the first film came from how these characters dealt with life's unpredictable course and how James L. Brooks captured their idiosyncrasies with a refreshing level of honesty for a mainstream film.

These nuances are completely missed as Robert Harling takes over for Brooks and takes the episodic approach that seemed to work better in his screenplay for 1989's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steel-Magnolias/dp/B00004TJKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steel Magnolias</a>. Based on Larry McMurtry's sequel novel, the story picks up Aurora's story fifteen years after Emma's death as we see true to her daughter's final wishes, that the grandiose older woman has raised Emma's three children. Now adults, oldest son Tommy is in prison for drug dealing, while youngest son Teddy has become standard white trash who wants only to own a tow truck. That leaves granddaughter Melanie who has inherited her mother's independent streak as she struggles through a bad relationship with an aspiring underwear model to become a sitcom actress. Without Emma, Melanie picks up the slack for spats and so do two minor characters from the first film - Emma's best friend Patsy, who has become a wealthy divorcee constantly competing with Aurora, and Aurora's salt-of-the-earth maid Rosie.

The movie becomes a virtual traffic jam of personal problems orbiting around Aurora with the second half an endless series of dramatic climaxes. MacLaine does the best she can under the circumstances, but the rest of the cast is set adrift. Bill Paxton looks particularly lost as the psychotherapist in love with Aurora. Juliette Lewis uses her familiar off-kilter mannerisms as Melanie, while Miranda Richardson is forced to play Patsy on two notes - petulant jealousy and benign resignation. Nicholson's appearance is welcome, but he understandably looks like he wants to leave the minute he arrives to remind Aurora of her enduring appeal. Only Marion Ross and Ben Johnson acquit themselves respectably as Rosie and her husband-to-be Arthur. Except for MacLaine's work, this overlong mess is really unbearable to watch. The 2001 DVD offers no significant extras.",1208044800,,2980,5.864055299539171

888591,1,6304410433,"I adore Terms of Endearment, it's a movie that time and time again has never failed to touch my heart and make my cry. I have known about ""The Evening Star"" for a long time, but I just got around to seeing it for the first time.

While it was fortunate that Shirley MacLaine reprised her role as Aurora, the film didn't have the same chemistry that made Terms of Endearment such a memorable and much loved film. The cast was just off, with nobody except for Marion Ross delivering a much appreciated and genuine performance.

Aurora returns in The Evening Star as a woman who has been weakened, and instead of seeing her as she was (and as she was loved) we see her adapt to the lives of her loser grandchildren with little contest. It's not the same Aurora from the first film. The Aurora we see in Evening Star doesn't have the same essence of ""Houston class"", the same sharp wit, and overall she is a different woman than the Aurora you grew used to in Terms of Endearment.

Watching this movie was painful, just because it was so predictable and, well, it was just lacking that soul that made the first film so special. This movie was put together so poorly, and it really shows. Emotional scenes are poorly done, because whomever wrote the screenplay really tried to make everything over-the-top, so when there was a crisis, it became an emotional spectacle with the entire cast instead of an intimate and thoughtful event between certain characters. When tragedy would strike, you'd have a room full of characters you don't care about dilluting the scene and creating a disconnect in the moment.

I give the film 1 star and that is only because we get a moment of time with Jack Nicholson, Marion Ross did a good job, and Shirley MacLaine came back to do her very best under the circumstances. These people are the only minute saving factor in this entire upset of a film.

Honestly though, if you really love Terms of Endearment, you may find yourself let down by The Evening Star. I personally wish that I hadn't of watched it and allowed for the story to end with the first film. Overall, I advise, if you loved Terms of Endearment never watch this film.",1147996800,7,2163,4.521739130434782

888594,5,6304410433,"""The Evening Star"" is an inspirational film covering serious topics such as moving away, death, and everyday living.

The story focuses on a widowed, well-to-do grandmother living in Houston, TX played by Shirley MacLaine, whose grandchildren have all taken a turn for the worse. Her favorite grandchild, ""Melanie"" has decided that she no longer wants to go to Rice, so she decides at the last minute to drop-out after receiving a ""D"" on her lit paper and decides to move out of her grandmother's home, and moves in with her hapless boyfriend, who desires to become a male model thinking he's going to get rich quick. Ultimately, they leave Houston for the bigger city lights of LA where ""dreams come true,"" but unfortuantely, for ""Melanie"" and her boyfriend things don't turn out as they had planned and now ""Melanie"" is left alone living in L.A. with her grandmother just a phone call away, decides to call her and tell her how difficult life really has become and of course, her grandmother fully understands and wants her to move back, but ""Melanie"" decides that moving back will only make it seem that she's being dependent on her grandmother.

The other grandchildren are two sons, Melanie's brothers, one who has a hardened heart and is in prison and the other one is a tow truck driver--not exactly what ""Aurora Greenway"" wanted her grandchildren to become.

Little by little, as ""Aurora's"" life seems to be taking a turn for the worse, Shirley MacLaine manages to maintain her composure, elegance and fortitude knowing that sometimes no matter how hard life can become, you can always make the best of a bad situation and she does!

I highly recommend this film to adults, who need a little pick me up, but at the same time can cope with serious issues such as death because the movie is a tear jerker.

888595,4,6304410433,"THE EVENING STAR is the long-awaited sequel to TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, continuing the story of Aurora Greenway and the children of her daughter Emma.

Aurora (Shirley MacLaine) has succeeded in raising Tommy (George Newbern), Teddy (Mackenzie Astin) and Melanie (Juliette Lewis), though she's not very happy with the outcome.  Tommy is in jail, Teddy has had a family out of wedlock and Melanie is skipping college and sleeping with a boy that Aurora (to put it mildly) doesn't approve of.

Aurora's lovelife has also taken a nosedive.  Garrett (Jack Nicholson) has moved away and the house seems too big and lonely.  At the `suggestion' of maid Rosie (Marion Ross) she goes to see a counsellor (Bill Paxton).  Trying desperately to keep Emma's family together, Aurora slowly mends the rift between the past and present.

This emotional sequel to TOE is fantastic.  Miranda Richardson fills the role of bitchy Patsy (played by Lisa Hart Carroll in the original film) perfectly, and Marion Ross more than fills the shoes of Rosie (played previously by Betty King).  Juliette Lewis is lovely as Melanie (and does resemble Debra Winger who played Emma).  And no sequel to TERMS OF ENDEARMENT would be complete without Jack Nicholson dropping by!

So lets revisit Aurora as she takes us through the next chapter of the Greenway story...",1106265600,25,1329,5.0228310502283104
888651,3,6304410433,"I really took a while to get into the film, but Shirley MacLaine's part made it for me.  Her honest approach to all she met, couldn't help win her votes.  She was a grandmother keeping her family together as best she could, yet when it all fell apart she still left the door of approach open for them all.  You can relate to many in the film, if you are young and impetuous or older and denying your age or honestly facing it.  A good film in my opinion.

888653,5,6304410433,"THE EVENING STAR is the sequel to the highly popular 1983 film TERMS OF ENDEARMENT. The kids are grown up. The eldest son in jail, the youngest son in a dead end job and fathering an illegitemate son with his girlfriend, and a hell bent daughter. Aurora has to deal with all of this, but her friends such as her maid Rosie, help her out. Rosie decides that Aurora is depressed, and tricks her into seeing a psychiatrist, who Aurora eventually falls for. Then there is Patsy, always integrating herself into Aurora's life, being jealous of her taking care of the kids when they were growing up. This feud is well played throughout the movie, with Patsy trying to upstage Aurora at every chance, and vice versa. They both fall for the same man, who is much younger than Aurora, which only causes more friction in their already tumultuous friendship. Life changes though when her grandson gets out of jail and decides to make a life for himself, and Aurora's granddaughter learns to chase her dreams after life's disapointments. The movie centers around these characters and their interpersonal relationships with each other, dealing with conflicts, death, and whatever card fate hands them. Shirley MacLaine shines once again as Aurora Greenway, and the cast is enriched by Juliette Lewis, Bill Paxton, Marion Ross, Miranda Richardson, and more. Overall, some reviewers don't like it as much as TERMS, but I think this improves on an already great story.",1043712000,31,1452,4.90650406504065

THE EVENING STAR focuses on the life of Aurora, after her daughter died. Having to deal with her daughter's children, and being mixed up in the lives of her enemy Patsy, as well as her maid and ex-lovers, it proves for interest plotline. The movie is just as compelling as TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, but it brings new elements which explore Aurora's life in a different light. The movie is full of smart comedy, as well as tearjerking scenes which will tug at your heartstrings. The story is written extremely well, and all the actors/actresses turned in an excellent performance. If you've seen TOE you must see this movie, its the perfect ending.

I am disappointed that Shirley Mclaine played the part, I guess it's all about money.  I don't blame Jack Nicholson for agreeing to a small part.  Ben Johnson is also much too good for this movie.  He is blessed by the fact that he also missed Texasville.  Very disappointing and not worth even the low price.  One to miss, I wish I had. Sudami",1013212800,2,669,4.304
888657,3,6304410433,"As a big fan of the 1983 film ""Terms Of Endearment"", I was really looking forward to this sequel. I was happy and disappointed both. This film, set 13 years after the original, finds feisty Texan Aurora Greenway(Shirley MacLaine)raising her three grandkids. One is in jail, one has a bratty kid of his own and a rather unfriendly girlfriend, and the other is a wild, out of control sort played by Juliette Lewis. Once again, MacLaine showcases incredible talent and wit in her role that originally won her the Oscar. Jack Nicholson shows up briefly, reprising his classic role. Sadly, Nicholson only has a small cameo. His brief appearence was a reminder of the great original. He makes the most of his few minutes onscreen. Marion Ross(Mrs. Cunningham on ""Happy Days""), is Rosie, Aurora's housekeeper. The filmmakers knew the original had this great emotional impact. They try way, way too hard on this one to create that same feeling. They overdo it to the point where it almost has no feeling. Only one of the emotional scenes, at the end, has real depth and sadness to it. The dialogue is intelligent, and, at times, quite funny. Miranda Richardson, Bill Paxton, Ben Johnson, Scott Wolfe, and Mackenzie Astin(From ""Facts Of Life"" fame)co-star. The movie was written and directed by Robert Harling. He wrote ""Steel Magnolias"".

This film is if anything even sadder than the first, with the sadness being a little relentless towards the end. As the film requires several characters  to age, the Senile Old Git make-up is employed on Shirley MacLaine rather heavily, and is a little over-done on all concerned. However the screenplay is fuller than Terms Of Endearment as it concentrates on just one character. The title sequence is wonderful, being composed of still pictures against the backdrop of well-matched opening theme, and some scenes (driving a car along the beach) are filmed very well.",1001289600,,875,4.9523809523809526

Growing up hasn't been easy, and the movie focuses on the relationships between family and friends, the good times and the bad times.

Character development and nuanced performances by both leading and supporting cast deserve attention.  Shirley MacClaine, George Newbern, Marion Ross and Tom Paxton ( with a particularly fine turn in an especially multi-faceted role ) are superlative throughout.  Even Jack Nicholson's recurrent, extended cameo is well-crafted and adds to the richness of this story.  Looking beyond some of the more obvious sentimentality in many situations, which I feel was far more exploited in ""Terms of Endearment"" to the detriment of that film, this portrayal of the life-long impact of the earlier death of Emma on each of the characters in ""The Evening Star"" makes it a truly significant film; in my opinion far superior to its predecessor.
