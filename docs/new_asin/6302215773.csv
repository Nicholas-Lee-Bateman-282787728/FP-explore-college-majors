7823841,3,6302215773,"A computer error at a mental hospital results in a dangerous serial killer being released instead of someone else with a similar name.  Rather than do the responsible thing and immediately alert the authorities an unscrupulous doctor fakes a death certificate for the man and claims he was actually cremated rather than released.  A female doctor on the staff is suspicious so she investigates on her own and finds that the killer is very much alive and has returned to the college fraternity where he committed his original crimes, although she has a hard time convincing the local sheriff after the administrator at the mental hospital faxes over a death certificate that she knows to be fake.  But the sheriff is an idiot, naturally, and assumes the death certificate is absolute proof that the female psychiatrist who actually saw the murderer with her own eyes is wrong.

Silent Madness is a second tier slasher movie at best and isn't as well made as even a below average Friday the 13th film.  The murders aren't particularly gory, creative or well shot.  The killer isn't very memorable or intimidating--the movie actually does a much better job creating lively villains among members the hospital staff than it does with its actual killer.  Belinda Montgomery's Dr. Joan Gilmore doesn't make for a particularly interesting heroine.  All in all, there's nothing about Silent Madness that merits a recommendation.

Still, Silent Madness isn't entirely without entertainment value as long as you are already a fan of the 1980's slasher genre.  The two crazy hospital attendants who have been sent to quietly retrieve their escaped maniac before it becomes obvious that the death certificate the hospital provided was fake are also sent to permanently silence the female doctor who won't go along with the cover-up.  They are kind of fun if a bit on the silly side.  Silent Maness also manages to finally generate a little suspense towards the end when it's just Dr. Gilmore versus the psycho.  Unfortunately, the twist ending makes no logical sense, but the movie isn't good enough for the nonsensical ending to actually ruin anything.

Silent Madness is pretty much just for fans of 1980's slasher films who will pretty much watch anything in the genre.  If you want to stick to the better slasher films I would personally go with the Friday the 13th series (particularly Parts 1, 4 & 6), or Halloween series (particularly Parts 1 & 4), Eyes Of A Stranger, Just Before Dawn, My Bloody Valentine, Night School, Pieces and Tenebre.  I'm sure there are other movies that fans would put on that list but Silent Madness is not likely to be one of them.",1499558400,,2654,4.903803131991052
7823842,4,6302215773,"SILENT MADNESS is the loving tale of a madman on the loose, murdering anyone he encounters. However, unlike other, similar stories, said maniac,  Howard Johns (Solly Marx), has not escaped from the insane asylum. This time, the homicidal lunatic has been released, due to budgetary constraints and human error. Dr. Joan Gilmore (Belinda Montgomery) discovers the problem, and attempts to fix it. Alas, she is buried under hospital politics and bureaucracy. Meanwhile, Johns sets his sights on the Omega sorority house, where the house sisters are watched over by the over-protective Mrs. Collins (Viveca Lindfors- CREEPSHOW, THE HAND). Bloody mayhem ensues. Can Dr. Gilmore track Johns down before he causes more misery and death? Will the sheriff (Sydney Lassick- ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, CARRIE) ever be of any real assistance? SILENT MADNESS is another forgotten, 80s Slasher film. As such, it has a certain originality and charm. It contains all of the prerequisites, including a murderer-on-a-mission, beautiful female victims, nudity, gore, and an explanatory flashback sequence. Ms. Montgomery is convincing as Dr. Gilmore, and Ms. Lindfors is good, but under-utilized in her smaller role! The sorority gals are suitably silly, like most horror movie fodder, while Marx's goggle-eyed portrayal of Johns is gleefully crazy. Overall, an enjoyable yarn...",1409702400,2,1367,5.5095238095238095
7823843,4,6302215773,"I don't think it's worth a herculean effort to track down, but this rather hard-to-find slasher film from 1984 isn't bad at all.  It does feature a couple of relatively creative kills, even though there's not a lot of blood and gore on display here (and rumor has it that the important few seconds of one particular scene were cut from the DVD release).  Don't get too excited about the fact that the murders take place in a sorority house, though, because the murders takes place over fall break, so you only have a handful of coeds on hand - and they certainly aren't throwing any slumber parties.  Interestingly, though, Silent Madness was apparently shot and originally released in 3-D, which explains why some scenes feature deadly implements being hurled directly at the camera - it's just a shame that there's really no way to experience these 3-D effects on video or DVD.

Seventeen years ago, Howard Johns was locked away in the Cresthaven mental institution after carrying out the murders dubbed the Sorority House Slaughter.  Now, thanks to a ""clerical error,"" this dangerous psychopath has been accidentally released back into the world.  No one seems to care (or even notice) except for Dr. Joan Gilmore (Belinda Montgomery), an idealistic young psychiatrist who investigates the matter herself.  Sleazy Dr. Kruger (Roderick Cook) and his L-ward lackeys Virgil (Dennis Helfend) and Jesse (Philip Levy) try to cover up the mistake by claiming Johns died, but Dr. Gilmore doesn't trust any of her colleagues (especially after she sees the conditions of the L ward for herself).  She heads out to the scene of Johns' barbarous crimes, trying to find the psychopath before he kills again.  The wormy little sheriff (Sydney Lassick) is no help to her, but Mark McGowan (David Greenan), the newspaper guy, comes up with a plan for Dr. Gilmore to learn about the original murders by spending the night in the sorority house (as if the current sorority sisters can give her all the details of a massacre that happened when they were all crawling around in diapers).  Needless to say, Dr. Gilmore does find Johns (actually, it's more like Johns finds her), at which time her lack of a plan for actually subduing him reveals itself quite painfully.  As if that isn't enough, Dr. Kruger has sent Virgil and Jesse, both of whom are basically subhuman monsters themselves, to cover up the whole ""we accidentally released a psychopathic killer"" mistake by catching Johns and then taking care of Dr. Gilmore, for good measure.  There's sort of a two-pronged twist at the end, which works well since one of those surprises is not completely unexpected.

The film does have a couple of oddities, such as a security guard roaming around the sorority's boiler room.  And speaking of that boiler room - Freddy Krueger would be jealous of these digs, as this sorority house boiler room is of TARDIS-like proportions.  It's huge; not only is it absolutely sprawling horizontally, it even develops different vertical levels in time for the big chase scene at the end.  On the plus side, though, Howard Johns is a pretty creative killer.  Like any good psychopathic murderer, he has a fondness for your standard old-school implements, but when he has sufficient time, he's a regular MacGyver of malicious mayhem, adapting whatever  materials are at hand to send someone to their eternal reward with quite a story to tell when they get there.

There are a number of forgettable 1980s slashers, but Silent Madness isn't one of them.  Don't knock yourself out trying to find it, but it's certainly worth picking up if you happen to run across it.",1191628800,8,3632,4.893964110929853
