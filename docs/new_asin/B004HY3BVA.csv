8434837,3,B004HY3BVA,"'Sons of the City: New York'(54 min) features interviews and old clips of prominent NBA players and coaches from the past that hailed from New York. A lot of the old footage shown is rarely seen. Each player or coach featured is only briefly touched upon since the program is less than an hour long and there isn't enough time to say much.  The coolest thing here is the old footage of the NBA.

There are two extended interviews which include 'Basketballography: Dolph Shayes'(15:15) and 'NBA Legends with Johnny Hoops: Bernard King'(23:07). Then some quick interview extras: Phil Jackson on Red Holzman(3:33), Pat Riley on Red Auerbach(4:08), Lamar Odom on Connie Hawkins(2:53), Kenny Anderson on Bernard Hopkins(3:13), Tim Hardaway on Nate Archibald(3:02). Enjoyable program but way too quick and brief. Much more could have been included in this Blu-ray(less than two hours run-time). Good thing is that the Blu-ray is just under four bucks(at the time of this review).",1437091200,,973,5.113207547169812

8434839,5,B004HY3BVA,"Being a big fan of basketball, I was very excited when my wife surprised me with this DVD for Christmas. It covers all of New York's basketball legends, from Bob Cousy to Connie Hawkins to Kareem. It was especially exciting seeing some of the archival footage, most of which I don't think I've ever seen before. Plenty of great action, from layups and dunks to blocks and fast-breaks, the momentum of the DVD never stops! Some cool extras too, really rare interviews and a cool sit down interview with the NYC legend BKing. Definitely glad the wife bought it for me, makes up for last year's gift (A gift card to Banana Republic- what kind of a man shops there!).",1327017600,4,663,4.533333333333333
