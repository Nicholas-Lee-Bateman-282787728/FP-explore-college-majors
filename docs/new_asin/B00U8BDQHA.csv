7030727,1,B00U8BDQHA,"I love film noire, but this has little suspense. Visually, a restoration MIGHT help: as of now, it is not light and dark but rather dark and very dark. I found it fairly boring, with little action or excitement of any kind. A few scenes are interesting. Some of the acting is good.",1473897600,9,281,4.320754716981132
7030728,5,B00U8BDQHA,Good film!,1470873600,,10,4.5
7030729,5,B00U8BDQHA,"I don't have the DVD but I just watched this and it is a great film noir movie. The plot is excellent and well written and directed by
Mark Stevens. The twist at the end is very good. It's not as good as Dark Corner with Stevens and Lucille Ball but it's very close.",1455840000,6,266,3.9444444444444446
7030730,4,B00U8BDQHA,"This review is for the ALPHA release (as pictured) of Mark Steven's classic noir TIME TABLE. I won't go into plot details as that would certainly ruin the viewing experience. This is to let you know that the ALPHA release offers a pretty clear image, free of scratches and multiple splices. The image is also often dark, especially for night scenes, but still watchable, though it would be nice to see TIME TABLE eventually given the same restoration that Steven's other noir CRY VENGENCE got from OLIVE FILMS. For the price it's a good buy until a proper release shows up. I enjoyed it. 5-star movie, 3-star DVD.",1454889600,18,613,4.685185185185185

8704664,2,B00U8BDQHA,This one comes in very poorly. Too dark and won't lighten up. And blurry on top of that. Story is just so so...not that good. I think I will stick to big name studios whenever possible.,1529366400,,185,4.166666666666667
8704665,1,B00U8BDQHA,I took this out of its case and put it right into my DVD player. It turned out to be unwatchable because it kept freezing. I cant review the movie because I didn't get to watch it. Total waste of money!,1528848000,2,202,3.951219512195122
8704666,5,B00U8BDQHA,As described.  This is a good film of its era.,1520467200,,46,3.6
8704667,4,B00U8BDQHA,"Time Table isn't about the robbery - we're mostly just told about it afterwards  - but about the pursuit of the criminals. We see this from the perspective of both the wrongdoers and the investigators. The movie is more talk than action (undoubtedly due to budgetary reasons). There's nothing special going on visually and not a lot of cracking dialog (though someone ""does the dutch""). But there are surprises and double-crosses and, overall, I found the plot engrossing. Jack Klugman and Fred Flintstone have small roles.",1510099200,2,523,5.0813953488372094

8704670,1,B00U8BDQHA,"No stars! A bad reproduced disk. Blurry picture, sticks and jumps to other parts of film continuesly! Worth nothing! JUNK!!! Amazon should drop this company.",1501113600,7,157,5.32
