The parental guide was very informative!  Thank you so much for making it easier to talk with our children about appropriate boundaries and that it is ok to say no.",1411516800,,324,4.732142857142857

He also loved the sticker program and earning the badge. Most of all, I loved having the video to help me adress sexual abuse with my children. I pray they may never need to use the information. However, I feel much better having discussed with them what they can and should do if they find themselves in this type of situation.  Thank you for developing this program!",1411430400,,527,4.536842105263158

By parents educating their young children in the 5 Bees, children will be empowered with knowledge that will not only help to protect them when they are young, but carry on through the teenage years and into adulthood. I highly recommend the program BaileyBeeBelieves, and would like to personally thank you for the incredibly important work you are doing.
