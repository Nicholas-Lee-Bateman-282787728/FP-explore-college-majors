4396678,5,B004KDYR5W,"Thanks for the feedback! Good to know we will see them in their original monochrome!

my original post:
Under ""Product Details""...it says ""color."" The original ""Car 54"" shows were in black and white. Anybody know if this DVD set has been colorized? If so, I don't intend to buy it.",1299456000,2,281,4.62
4396679,5,B004KDYR5W,"I have been waiting for this for such a long time and thanks to Shanachie Entertainment my wait is about to be over. Car 54 Where Are You? is the early 1960s sitcom featuring mismatched officers Toody and Muldoon of the fictitious 53rd Precinct in New York City. Gunther Toody (Joe E. Ross) is short, stocky, and simple, and partner in Car 54 to officer Muldoon. Francis Muldoon (Fred Gwynn) is tall, slender, and sophisticated, at least compared to his partner. Al Lewis appeared in a recurring role as officer Leo Schnauser prior to reteaming with Gwynne in The Munsters, and Charlotte Rae played Schnauser's wife Sylvia. The series was actually filmed entirely on location at what was then the Biograph Studios in the Bronx, New York. The series is presented in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio. This first season of 30 episodes has been remastered for this collection from the only complete set of 35mm prints known to be in existence. The image quality is very sharp with excellent gray scale for the most part. There is some haloing visible around figures and objects but this is very minimal. There are occasional scratches or blemishes perceptible but much less than what we usually see on shows from this vintage. There are some minor authoring errors on a few episodes in discs 3 and 4 in which solid blacks are compromised with some gray and white electronic noise. This may be imperceptible on a small screen but are more distracting on a large screen. The English Dolby Digital tracks are good with dialogue always appropriately audible over sound effects. Audio quality is variable with more audible hiss on certain episodes and less on others. Now can't wait for season two to be released.",1297555200,5,1704,4.819112627986348
4396680,5,B004KDYR5W,"Finally one of the all time classics makes it to DVD and rightfully so. Some many actors in comedy today said that the show was way ahead of it's time with the writing talents from Nat Hiken.
This is the way comedy was meant to be smart, like able characters, amusing and funny plots.
The chemistry of Joe E. Ross and Fred Gwynne were perfect., as was the rest of  the cast including Al Lewis and Charlotte Rae (Yes Mrs. Garrett from Facts of life)
I can't wait till season 1 comes out I remember some classic episodes that I can't wait to see again and season 2 is planned for later in the year to complete the collection.

If you love classic TV or are just tired of the junk they call sitcoms today then you need to treat yourself to a great show.",1297468800,43,750,4.165517241379311
4396681,5,B004KDYR5W,"""FINALLY""!!! They are putting; ""Car 54 Where Are You?!?"", out on DVD. As a teenager, I would never miss this wonderful, funny gem, of a comedy. This show is up there in laugh riot funniness, as is the; ""Munster's"" & ""Mister Ed"".

I have waited & waited for the day that they would release it on DVD.",1297382400,4,299,4.245614035087719

Stars Fred Gwynne (Herman on the Munsters) and Joe E. Ross as 2 inept New York police officers aired on TV from 1961 to 1963.
VERY funny in a 60-ish fashion. For kids (and some adults) this was a ""not to be missed"" TV series in it's time. Worth a look.",1296172800,40,484,4.377777777777778
4396683,3,B004KDYR5W,"Thanks for finally putting this series out on dvd.  It was a very funny comedy and I look forward to seeing it again.  Have not seen it since it was first on the air.

UPDATE:  I wish to also complain about the order on the disks and the lousy packaging. I have the episode list of prodcast order and I am watching in correct order, but having to watch first disk 1 then disk 4 is annoying.  But I am still glad to have the set and will buy season 2.",1296000000,24,450,3.901098901098901
4396684,3,B004KDYR5W,"Just gotta say, one thing really annoys me about this set and that is that the episodes have been put in a seemly random order.  This will lead to some confusion because Al Lewis did two different characters in early episodes that led to him becoming Officer Schnauzer, however, these appear latter in the DVD ordering leading you to possibly wonder if he is an undercover cop or something, which he is not.  This is not a problem with the second season DVD set.  So anyway, if you want to see them in the order in which they are supposed to be watched, visit the wikipedia episode guide then play musical-chairs with the discs.",1495497600,,628,4.491228070175438

4396687,5,B004KDYR5W,"The packaging is brilliant. The best way to hold the discs in place of any I've seen. Taking a few moments to understand how the packaging works is all that's required to realize what a great system this is. One need merely push the disc downward vertically to compress some plastic tabs  then pull the top of the disc outward to remove the disc. To return the disc place it flat on its place in the box,  push down vertically to compress the  lower tabs then release which allows the disc to slide up and be held in place by the upper tabs. Nothing could be simpler or more elegant, dispensing with those bothersome breakable spindles. Child's play really. Perhaps those having difficulty with the packaging could ask a child to help them.

4396690,4,B004KDYR5W,"I want to say I Love It - but a few things detract - Not so much on the show - but the presentation of this DVD.
I see No air dates listed. This DVD just automatically goes from one episode to another.
And the only 'Bonus' is an good interview of Charlotte (something) and a guy who was more of a background cop.
No episodes with audio commentary. Someone like Stephen Cox sharing history of the show would have been cool.
Only a few episodes are Dudes. - Mostly Brilliant show - Fantastic actors/cast. A Must have.

4396721,4,B004KDYR5W,"When I began watching season 1, I figured I would give it about 2 stars.  But now nearing the end of it, I am up to 3.5 stars and its growing on me more every day.  You are most likely looking at this show either because you remember it from when it was on the air; or because you are a Bilko fan.  For me it was both.  This is a warm and pleasant show, but there are none of the standout episodes as you would find in Bilko.  At least I haven't found one yet.  But you will see a lot of familiar faces including:  Pvt. Mullen, Pvt. Paparelli, Sgt. Birch, Sgt. Hogan, The Twitch, Gruber from McHales Navy, Al Grandpa Lewis, Nipsy Russell and many others you will remember from shows of that era.

What makes this show special is the relationship between Toody and Muldoon and with Capt. Block, perfectly played by Paul Reed.  There is a sweetness with these characters which is actually developed.  Oh and I forgot to mention Beatrice Pons who once again plays Joe E. Ross wife.  Her character develops from something much softer than Mrs. RItzik into, well, Mrs. Ritzik again but with just a bit of the edge taken off.

The stories are simple, the plot devices are dumb, but the actors all make it work into a fun show.  And as the show progresses, it gets better and funnier.  Do they overdo the Do you mind and oooh-oooh bits?  Yes, especially the former, which never sounds all that natural (I don't think it worked all that well in Bilko either).  The oooh-oooh on the other hand, I find myself using. It really was the perfect catch phrase for Joe E. Ross.

As long as I have you, allow me to recommend as much stronger shows Hogans Heroes (from Bilko alum Bernard Fein) and Barney Miller, both much smarter and funnier shows utilizing the military and police themes.",1430352000,,1773,4.373088685015291

4396734,3,B004KDYR5W,"The viewing quality of these discs is fine, and the show's humor remains delightful -- but several production decisions about this DVD set are annoying. First, the package design doesn't hold the discs securely, and they tend to fall out. More mysteriously, the Season One episodes were randomly assigned among the four discs. If you want to watch them in the order in which they originally were broadcast, you need to consult a list online, and then determine which disc has the episode you want.  This is more difficult than it should be, because the episode list is printed underneath the clear plastic that holds the discs, and you have to remove all four discs to see which episode is where. Season Two episodes are in order on the four discs.",1414886400,4,748,4.709923664122138

4396747,1,B004KDYR5W,"Car 54 is pure farce, you won't find satire like Sledge Hammer, or clever sight gags like Police Squad.  There is no social commentary like Barney Miller.  It is just a fun show about cops working a precinct in a nice, close knit neighborhood.  The cops and citizens are oblivious to most practical concerns creating genuine belly laughs.  It is a shame that more people don't remember this gem.  Look fast for later African American stars such as Mel Stewart, Nipsey Russell and Ossie Davis playing non stereotypical roles as equals in the department!  Most of the main cast have since passed on, so the DVD extras limited but clever, including auditions and thoughts from costar Charlotte Rae (yes Mrs. Garrett!)  Now for the bad.  The packaging is stupid!  You need the dexterity of a jeweler to remove the DVDS from the package without scratching them and case has no catch or box to keep the DVDs from falling out.

4396762,5,B004KDYR5W,"The bizarre, quirky ""Car 54, Where Are You?"" was not always the cult TV show that it is now. When it was first broadcast on NBC during the 1961-62 television season, the series was very much an acquired taste. At the time, it was panned by many critics as being extremely low-brow entertainment, while steadily becoming a guilty pleasure of the discerning television viewing audience. Case in point: the legendary Southern writer William Faulkner.

A few years ago I toured Rowen Oak, William Faulkner's home in Oxford, Mississippi. The house is still furnished with everything Faulkner owned in his lifetime. I noticed during the tour that there was not a television set in the whole house. I asked the tour guide about it, and he said that Faulkner would not allow any TV sets in the house.

I said, ""So Faulkner didn't like to watch TV?""

The tour guide said, ""Well, actually there was one show that he really liked. It was 'Car 54, Where Are You?'""

I said, ""Faulkner liked 'Car 54'? You're kidding me, right?""

The guide said, ""No, in fact, every Sunday evening Faulkner would walk to a neighbor's house and watch 'Car 54' on their television.""

The thought kept going through my mind of William Faulkner sitting in his neighbor's living room, puffing on his pipe, sipping a large bourbon, and laughing out loud at Toody and Muldoon. It was a mind-boggling thought, but I loved it.

One story goes that Faulkner's daughter told her father that she was reading ""Turn of the Screw"" by Henry James.

Faulkner supposedly said to her, ""That would make a great 'Car 54' plot.""

So just remember, when you are sitting in front of your television, laughing at the off-kilter world of ""Car 54, Where Are You?,"" you're in good company. It made William Faulkner laugh, too.",1363737600,5,1767,4.729641693811075

4396767,4,B004KDYR5W,"Even though I am in my50s, I only heard of this series but I never had the pleasure of watching it. This series was never syndicated on stations I grew up with. But not long ago I finally had the chance to watch this series when it was aired on a station called ME-TV (Memorable Entertainment Television) which only airs older, classic television. From the first episode I watched I knew this was going to be a winning series. As some people mentioned, it was created by Nat Hiken who also gave us ""The Phil Silvers Show"" which, incidentally, also has Joe E. Ross (Tootie) making appearances as the cook. I truly enjoy classic comedy from the 50s and 60s. I never watch the garbage ""comedy"" that's on television today. You can have your sex jokes. There's no originality in comedies today, either. One show looks the same as another. Many comedies from the 50s and 60s play out more like mini-movies which often are VERY distinct from each other. ""Car 54"" is one of these series. It's orignal, clean, and often times hilarious. As a parent, I never had my kids watching ""comedy"" from today's TV. I have many programs from the 50s and 60s which now my children all know about and also enjoy without the adult content you see today. If you have never seen this program, I would recommend taking a look at it. I hope others will find it as entertaining as I have.
I know many people have added this to their reviews but I feel I also have to mention it as well. The packaging truly is absolutely horrible. How someone was able to think up such a TERRIBLE way to hold the discs in the case is beyond me. As I said, I have many other series on DVD and NEVER have I seen such a terrible packaging job as this one. It can easily scratch your discs as well as possibly crack them if you aren't extremely careful in removing them from the case. I read about this so I right away knew to very carefully remove all of the discs and put them in regular DVD cases. Since I have both seasons of this show, I even made my own 'boxed set' complete with the titles of each show on the discs and pictures. I strongly recommend that everyone do the same. But after you see the packaging yourself, you decide.
Finally, it's true that season 1 is out of airdate order. I read on a different review that the episodes were put in the order of popularity. Whatever the case is, it is a little annoying to me because I know the airdate order from a sitcom reference book that I own. But, since every episode is a stand alone story, it's not too big of a deal. And they fixed the problem with season 2 which is shown in the original airdate order.
The prints look great, the stories are great, and it's a pleasure to own the series. I recommend adding this set to your library of classic television. I'm glad I did.",1361664000,,2789,4.304182509505703

Of the few episodes I have watched, the video quality and sound is great.

Many have made reference to the ""different"" packaging, but once you get used to the way to remove a DVD from the packaging, its relatively simple and the disc shouldn't get damaged.  The instructions could be worded a little differently, as ""push down"" is like one normally does when you push vertically down on the center of a DVD to release it.  Instead, gently slide the DVD down a smidge towards you, and the DVD will be released.  If you look carefully at the bottom of the slot for the DVD, you will see there is a kind of plastic spring thing.  It's actually a lot easier than the normal press down in the center of the DVD.

It would be more useful to have had a plastic outer slip cover, where one could slip in a piece of paper with the correct playing order.  There is just a cardboard outer and no-where to put it.  Sometimes it's also useful to be able to slip in a piece of paper reminding you which episodes you have watched

I'm rating it 4 out of 5 stars, due to the bad ordering of the episodes, and the basic cardboard outer covering. The way you remove a DVD from the packaging isn't an issue if you don't go at it like a bull in a china shop! Stop, Look, Release!",1355184000,4,2500,3.781925343811395

I time travelled trying to figure out where the exterior scenes were shot (our house showed up in a couple), and laughed out loud at so many of the bits; Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis were very funny and underrated as actors.  Best of all was that it captured a moment in The Bronx when housing was short, neighborhoods were changing, and urban renewal was the latest and greatest idea in city planning, and here was Mrs. Bronson refusing to move so that her building could be torn down in favor of an expressway on ramp that would allow dentists to get to their golf game in New Jersey 15 minutes faster.",1355097600,,735,4.357664233576642

When I opened the first case two of the cds were loose and I noticed that disc 1 had two long and thick scratches. I don't know if the scratches occured from being loose in the case or if I had been issued returned/faulty discs. I tried to play it and couldn't even get through the very first intro song. I then put the 2nd disc in, which wasn't scratched. Halfway through the 2nd show the disc started skipping. I went through several other shows and found the same problem.

4396782,5,B004KDYR5W,"The smartest, funniest show on TV. Created by Nat Hiken who  also created ""The Phil Silvers Show"". Joe E Ross from ""Bilko""and Fred Gwynne from ""The Munsters"" appear as the two unlikely cops Toody and Muldoon. Every episode is a chunk of gold. Those who have seen this show know how funny this series is. Those who haven't,check it out. This is how to write comedy.
This series only lasted two seasons and both are out on DVD. The reason for this is answered in the extra's on the first season with a round table interview with Charlotte Rae and Hank Garrett who played Sylvia Schnauser and Nickelson one of the cops in the precinct, respectively. Season two's extra's is Joe E Ross' stand -up comedy routine after the series had ended. There are lots of location shots of the streets of the Bronx. The police car had to be painted red and white so it wouldn't be mistaken for a real one which was green and white. The series was shot in black and white. Beatrice Pons who plays Toody's wife, Lucille and Paul Reed who plays Capt Block are brilliant. Lucille has no problem with opening the window and shouting to the world outside what a nut she has for a husband. The exasperated Capt Block who glumly states ""with a precinct like this even Jack the Ripper would have made a good cop"" are priceless.  In fact the whole cast is brilliant. The dialogue between the actor's are a joy to listen to.
Muldoon to Sgt Block on Toody going undercover: "" Toody doesn't look like a cop in plain clothes, capt.
""He doesn't look like a cop in uniform either"" replies the Capt.
Another episode on Capt Block telling off his staff for not filing paperwork and it all collapsing on him:
"" When are you going to file all this. Look, I have a file here from 1927 and that was at the top of the pile. I hate to think what i'll find at the bottom. Probably part of the dead sea scrolls""
Toody on his wife letting him out the house:
""you know my wife doesn't like me going out. She blamed me for starting World War II so I could get out to join up.
Officer Schnauser, played by Al Lewis also from ""The Munsters"", on getting time off for his sister's wedding:
"" You've got to let me go. This is a big thing. I have six sisters and I'm considered the prettiest. Once she gets married men will be able to walk safely on the streets again"".
This is one series you can watch over and over again without getting tired of the routines. Remember the name  Nat Hiken whenever you watch an episode. A brilliantly funny show.",1346112000,,2494,4.3247863247863245
4396783,3,B004KDYR5W,"If you are police Captain Block of the 53rd precinct, you've got your hands full with your district's ragtag company of policemen, but none gives you more pause - when it comes to assigning an important job - than patrolmen Toody and Muldoon.  While Muldoon is level headed, he is as tough as a marshmallow.  And Toody, when he starts spouting, ""Ooh! Ooh!"" you just know he has come up with some halfcocked idea.

In the best episode, ""Put It in the Bank!"", Muldoon appoints Toody treasurer of the Brotherhood Club over the objection of the men.  His first task is to put the club's money in the bank, but gets the idea to gamble it in the stock market.  For those of you interested in the stock market, this is a good episode to learn why stock values are so fuzzy. . . .

Each episode opens with Toody and Muldoon on patrol while the theme song plays.  Apparently Captain Block had never seen them behind the wheel of car 54, otherwise, he would have placed them on foot-patrol.  Talk about your distracted drivers, in one opening sequence they are driving while playing checkers!

Overall:  I can see the humor in these shows, but seldom were they funny enough to prompt a laugh from me.

Packaging:  On opening the box for the first time, 3 discs fell out; disc 4 was still in its mount.  For this box type, the discs are held in place by projecting lips of plastic and two small plastic spring arms.  Luckily, the discs were not scratched, probably because there is no central mounting hub to scrape against and no room for the discs to move around.

Picture (DVD): 3 to 3.5, in a few dark scenes there is noticeable speckling.  Subtitles, Languages, Special Features: none.",1339286400,,1679,4.509933774834437
4396784,1,B004KDYR5W,"This review is not about Car 54 Where Are You? as a TV series.  It's a classic comedy and well worth seeing again and again.  That said, however, this release is very definitely a case of 'Buyer Beware!'. As others have already noted, the packaging is poorly designed, the episodes are completely mixed up so that if you want to see them in order you have to keep changing discs, there's nothing in the packaging to tell you which episodes are on which disc, and most bizarrely, disc four was evidently a screw-up in the manufacturing as, instead of episodes from the show, it contained a travelogue and documentary on Haiti! At first I thought I was the only one but I've found at least one other reviewer mentioning the exact same problem. So if you do order this set, be sure to check all four discs when you receive it to make sure they're what they are supposed to be. Otherwise, you might not be able to return them for a refund.

Also, on a side note, reviewer Paul J. Mular was thoughtful enough to provide a correct viewing list of the season one episodes in his review, so check his review out if you want to see the episodes in their proper order.",1337040000,10,1158,4.376744186046512
4396785,4,B004KDYR5W,"Finally, one of my all-time favorite TV sitcoms is available on DVD. I rank it right up there with the the early '50s ""Abbott & Costello Show,"" ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"", The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", ""Get Smart"", ""M*A*S*H"", ""Taxi"", ""Police Squad"", ""Seinfeld"" and ""30 Rock"". (And speaking of ""30 Rock,"" I'm convinced Tina Fey and Jeff Richman MUST be huge fans of this show. Not only do I hear snippets of Car 54-esque motifs in Mr. Richman's fabulous background scoring, but I believe I've discovered the missing link that connects early raw caveman to modern Tracy Jordan - it's Gunther Toody. (They even have the same body, and they're both playing with 51 cards.) Both programs share a kind of silly, manic absurdity which I've found endearing since I first saw Horsefeathers on TV when I was eleven.) And both programs are decidedly ""writer"" shows, with great concepts, fresh and original scripts and wonderfully drawn characters. You know... the opposite of ""Home Improvement"".

Maybe it's because I read several reviews here before ordering, but I was pleasantly surprised by the packaging. Yes, the shows are not in the correct order, which is annoying, but I had NO PROBLEM taking the four DVDs in and out of the box. The reviews here tipped me off to be careful, and if you simply take 30 seconds to examine how the DVDs are held in their case -- and if you follow the instructions (""To remove disc from tray, push down, pull up"") -- the case holds the DVDs nicely.

The writers assume that the viewer is somewhat intelligent and dosen't mind throwing in off-beat references to a variety of topics. This is so refreshing compared to modern tv shows which assume the opposite. Joe E. Ross as Gunther Toody has got to be seen to be believed. He was a nightclub bouncer who producer Nat Hiken discovered and decided he was such a character that he would put him on tv. Ross reportedly and unintentionally contributed to Mr. Hiken's death a couple of years later. Seriously. That tidbit is shared in a conversation with a couple of the series regulars included on this disc. If you saw the 90s movie that had the same title, do not let that scare you away from this set.

4396803,4,B004KDYR5W,"I used to watch this with my mother when I was little, when it aired on Nick at Nite in the late 80s.  My mom remembered it from it's original run, when she was a kid.  We looked forward to it each time it was on Nick.  It was a hilarious old show.  I had recorded a few episodes and watched them over the years.  They never lost their charm, but I was afraid the first season in it's entirety wouldn't be as funny as I remembered.  I purchased this as an Easter gift for my mother, and we both watched all 30 episodes and the interview in one weekend.  It is still a hilarious show and we were laughing just as much as we did 20+ years ago.  It is a reminder of how good tv used to be when compared to today's reality shows, crude comedies, and hospital and crime dramas; it makes me wish we had shows like this, I Love Lucy, the Honeymooners and more made today.  The quality of the sound and video of the dvds is good.  Some people say the episodes are edited, which is a shame.  I have no idea which pieces are missing but if they are cut I wish they hadn't been.  The interview segment with two of the original cast members, Charlotte Rae and Hank Garrett, was interesting to watch.

I very much hope that season 2 gets released, because there are some more great episodes that we want to see again.  Like when Toody helps the bank robbers.  Very funny stuff.

Like others, I had trouble removing the discs from the package.  I never had a dvd package like this, and it wasn't until my brother told me how to remove them that it became easy to do.  I haven't noticed any scratches on them but I did nearly crack one when I first tried to get it out.  You have to be really careful when removing them.  Now I find it very easy to remove them.

As for the episodes being in the wrong order, I didn't realize this until we got to disc 4.  We knew something was wrong when Schnauzer was 2 different characters and we couldn't figure out why.  It really doesn't make sense that the episodes are in a totally random order.  Or by popularity.  It makes disc 4 seem very out of place when you get to it.  But, we enjoyed all the episodes anyway.  To me it was worth the 20 dollars.  I hope that season 2 is released by any company, uncut and maybe in order of airdates.",1307836800,3,2266,4.1118721461187215

4396805,4,B004KDYR5W,"I agree with most all of the reviews. I find it hard to believe that the episodes on Disc 4 are less popular than on Disc 1. The episode with Charlotte Rae as the bank teller before she becaome Mrs. Schnauser was very funny, likewise those before Al Lewis became Officer Schnauser.  Hopefully the manufacurer will get the hint and never mess up a season broadcast-order again. There is often a progression in a show and it does not make sense to change the order.  I also agree with the fact that the way the discs are held down is one of the worst ever. Luckily my discs were still in place upon arrival and I was careful in opening them, based upon what other reveiwers had said.  Still, great show, so these are merely minor annoyances, since my discs are okay.  By the way, what they mean by push down, is you push down on the top of the Disc. It is sort of spring loaded, so it slips under the two little tabs that are holding it in.  Once it is clear what they mean, then it is not all that hard to remove or return the discs, without damaging them. You would still have to be careful in handling the box to keep them from popping out, but I would not think it would be necessary to store them separately (once they arrive in good shape in the first place.)

4396809,5,B004KDYR5W,"Very impressive tv series about cops from 1961, sort of a pre-historic BARNEY MILLER, but on film, rather than taped.  Completely unique in its day, it now seems to have been a pioneer that has never been equaled. Basically New York actors, many of whom were on Broadway concurrently with doing these shows, are delivering flavorful, extremely funny scripts. Nat Hiken, who had originated the SGT. BILKO show, created this, and it is classic. Every episode is a delight.  Joe E. Ross, an old burlesque comedian, is the head idiot, Gunther Toody, and Fred Gwynne (Herman Munster)  is Francis Muldoon, his partner in the NYPD.  A flock of great character comedians round out the cast. This is a real treat. Series tv was never better than this!

Finally getting this dvd package is wonderful, but there are no real extras, except for an interview with a couple of surviving actors (Charlotte Rae and an actor who played one of the minor cops.) There are no commentaries, and for some reason, the episodes are not arranged in chronological order.  Al Lewis, who played Schnauzer, a particularly colorful character, did a few episodes, early in the year, as other random denizens of New York. Apparently, they found him to be such a hot laugh-getter, they created a specific character for him. But those early episodes are on disc four. Charlotte Rae, who ultimately was cast as Mrs. Schnauzer played a couple of little cameos early on, too. But those episodes are  deep into the mix, too. It doesn't make any sense.  I noticed the copyright notice for most of the  first disc was 1962, and the early ones were scattered throughout the set. The last episode on disc four is the Christmas episode. So, it is a very scrambled kind of display; but what an array of jewels!  Everything looks pretty good, much better than I'd have expected. The packaging is also a problem, with a cheapened version of the plastic contraption that usually holds multi-disc sets. This time, it's very difficult to fasten the individual pieces into their own little nest.

I really hope that season two does show up.  I can't imagine the first one will sell all that well.  It hasn't been promoted in any way that will bring in those who don't specifically remember the original airings.  The really dumb movie version from the 90s didn't help the show's reputation at all.

4396812,4,B004KDYR5W,"To start with, I am very happy that someone finally put out Car 54, Where Are You? on dvd.  It seems to be the forgotten show.

The show itself is a 5 star show in my opinion.  The quality of the mastering is very good.  Easily 4 star for the video but the sound is definately dated but still pretty good would give it a 3 star rating.  It sounds a bit tinny.  I have to admit that I was impressed with the overall quality of each show and yes, the original opening and ending music is complete.  Every show is shown in it's original, luxurious and beautiful Black and White presentation.  I am thankful they did not attempt to colorize this show.

The way that the show is presented on each disc is 2 stars.  I give it 2 stars as they are on the discs but as so many others are saying, they are not shown in the order in which they were broadcast. My question is, why?  A company spends millions of dollars to obtain the rights, they spend more on mastering and put in many hours to master each show, but then sloppily and uncaringly throw it together.  What's up with that?  Not a deal breaker for me, but it may be for others.  Especially since you are paying a premium for this set.  There is only a short extra in this set and no real background or paperwork included, but again, not a deal breaker.

Now, the case that everyone is talking about.  I opened it and thought that it did not look that bad and the discs were secure, so what is the fuss?  OK, then I tried to take one out!  Now I know!  You have to read the directions on the disc, not on the case as to how to remove the discs. My wife liked the case when she saw it and liked the idea of how they did it, until she tried to take one out too.  Of course, now that the disc is out, the next trick is to put it back in.  Again, not a real easy task. I give the case 2 stars as there are so many styles of cases out there in the mass market that the company could of picked one of these instead of trying to be different or fancy on this case.  Be fancy on disc content presentation like putting the shows in correct order.

All I can say is that if you like the show as I do, buy it.  You will learn how to take out the discs and put them back into the case as time goes on or do as some people have done and use your own case or sleeve although it sort of messes up the concept since it all should be together and kept together as a package. Hopefully Shanachie will read the reviews and do it right on Season 2.

UPDATE 5/24/11: I have owned this set for a little while now and have to say I have finally learned how to get the discs in and out of the package easily.  If you do not own this set, don't laugh.  It is a challenge to learn how to remove and replace discs and it's definately an art.  I can easily remove and replace the discs whithout and friction to cause possible scratches or marks and is easy once you have it fugured out.  Now even though I have finally mastered it, it is not bad design but would rather have the standard slim cases in a box.",1305244800,6,3031,3.9701986754966887

4396815,1,B004KDYR5W,"Some of us consider ""Car 54, Where Are You?"" one of the greatest sitcoms of the 1960s, thanks to the genius of Nat Hiken's concept and writing and the brilliant casting. After waiting for years for the DVD release (the only really decent prior release being Republic Home Video's 8-VHS set containing, I think, the first 16 of the 60 episodes), it's hard to contain my deep disappointment at Shanachie's lame treatment.

First, as others have mentioned, the packaging is terrible; when the discs aren't seemingly glued to those godawful molded plastic containers, they're falling out of the case, and the risk of scratching them is considerable. Even worse, though, is Shanachie's incomprehensible reordering of the episodes ""by popularity,"" according to a spokesperson for the company. Here's the guy's statement from the website TV Shows on DVD: ""Actually, after spending time with some Car 54 historians and buffs it was determined that the most attractive presentation would be to have the episodes ordered by popularity. Of course this is all subjective...but the good news is that ALL of the episodes are there!""

This is NOT ""attractive"" or even understandable. You'd be hard pressed to name another company of any repute that engages in such non-industry-standard practices. Imagine releasing ""Season One"" of, say, ""I Love Lucy"" or ""Seinfeld"" and deciding to reorder the episodes based on *somebody's* idea of their ""popularity."" This is so unprofessional and misguided. No consumer could prefer some company person's idea of ""what's popular"" over the order the creators of the show themselves chose. Continuity gets screwed up, and the whole thing is disrespectful. The idea that ""some Car 54 historians and buffs"" would want the episodes ordered so haphazardly is simply not credible, so my guess is that they screwed up and won't admit it.
I'm thankful for the episodes themselves, but waiting so long for them and then getting this second-rate treatment is just maddenining. Let's hope that Season 2 won't suffer the same fate, and that if they decide to do any more extras, they also won't hire unprepared, brain-dead Robert Klein to interview anybody.",1304899200,14,2165,5.165242165242165
4396816,5,B004KDYR5W,"This has got to be one of the greatest comedy sitcoms of all time. I have been hunting Car 54 for quite a while. All that was offered were a few VHS tapes with a couple of episodes here and there. Last year there was a two-dvd set with about 15 selected episodes, the picture quality was not all that great, but I wanted Car 54 and so purchased it to get my fix. Imagine my great anticipation of the release last month of the complete First Season of Car 54! I immediately purchased it from Amazon, after having read the reviews listed above. Let me first say that all of the griping about the packaging of this four-disc set is completely correct and justified. It is really awful. You run a great risk of scratching the discs or breaking them attempting to extract them from the package. It took me a long time to get them out, only after proceeding very carefully. So, fellow Car 54 fans, forewarned is forearmed. After you get them out, don't put them back in the same package if you can help it. I picked up some dvd holders to put them in. Shame (and costly) that you have to do this, but it the best protection for them. I also agree with another reviewer here that it makes no sense that the episodes are not presented in the order they were filmed. I cut, pasted and printed the correct sequence provided here and am keeping that near the discs, but if you want to watch them in order you have to skip from disc to disc! Also, unless you go back to the disc menu to stop after each episode it will automatically play the next episode,which is very annoying. This entire set is presented very badly. One of the episodes had a snippet of a commercial, but none in any other episodes!  The ""added bonus"" interview with Charlotte Rae and Hank Garrett was good, but Robert Klein is a comic, not an interviewer. All this aside, however, this show is unbeatable for laughs. The comedy talent and writing is the best. Each show is so incredibly rich with plots and dialogue that it is like a mini-movie, you can't believe this is just a half hour show! Nat Hiken was a true comedic genius. All you have to do is look at Gunther Toody's (Joe E. Ross) face, which is hysterically funny. Don't know what it is about him, but his expressions and manner are just so funny. Add to that Fred Gwynne (Herman Munster) as Francis Muldoon, his partner and complete opposite, to make for one madcap episode after another. Look for a young Charlotte Rae (Facts of Life) as Sylvia Schnauzer, she shines in ""The Courtship of Sylvia Schnauzer"". Beatrice Pons as Lucille Toody, Gunther's long-suffering wife, is equally good, as is Al (grandpa Munster) Lewis as Leo Schnauzer. This series was filmed in the Bronx at the old Biograph Studios, first home of the early silents. I love the sets as it gives an old fashioned quality that makes the whole series cozy and funny. If you remember and loved this show, as I do, I urge you to purchase this set, despite everything, it is worth it. Now, I only hope that when they release Season Two, the final season of this great show, Shanachie will get the message and do it right, giving this beloved series the respect and first class outing it deserves.

 April 25, 2012 --I am adding an addendum to this review as I just received my copy of Season Two from Amazon and have just reviewed it. (See Season Two if you want to read it). I had originally just given this Season One two stars, but am revising to five stars. Despite the crummy packaging and out of order discs (the order was corrected in Season Two the packaging still stinks) it is a wonderful five-star show, worthy of the highest rating. They just don't make wonderful comedy shows like this anymore. If you are on the fence deciding to get it, PLEASE jump off and buy both seasons.

4396821,4,B004KDYR5W,"First, let's make one thing clear.  This show was funny... sometimes super funny.  In a way, it's a good thing they only made two seasons.  Kind of like with the Munsters, if you push the joke too far, it's not so funny anymore.  Best to go out on a high note.  (However, Farscape, was pulled too early!!!!).

Now, about the episodes not being in order.  I printed out the correct show order online.  I use this as my guide when watching.  Yes, it's annoying, but it works.  Considering these DVDs are the most convenient way to watch, it's better than nothing.  Besides, after watching them in their correct order one time around, I'm not sure any of this will matter to me anymore.  At that point, watching them out of sequence will be fine.  But yes, they should have placed the shows sequentially as they aired.

My advice, don't rate this series 1-star.  If you don't like the presentation, make note of that in your review, but the series itself deserves 4 stars minimum.  Also, in watching this, assuming this is somewhat representative of a time when the police were more friendly, I have wondered what the heck happened since the early 1960s to what we have today.

In closing, I highly recommend this DVD to those looking for a very funny TV show to come home to after work and watch alone or with your family (which I do).  The show is certainly family friendly.",1303689600,3,1373,4.512195121951219

Although the quality of the reproduction is very good, there are still a few flaws, but that's to be expected.

4396823,1,B004KDYR5W,"First of all, let me join the chorus of other ""Car 54"" lovers that I am so glad these shows *finally* appear on DVD. They are quite hilarious in an early 1960s sort of way, and Gwynne and Ross are terrific together. There are some wonderful performances throughout, especially the episodes with Alice ""M"" Ghostly and Carl Ballantine. Look for comedian Nipsey Russell and Billy Sands (from ""Bilko"" and ""McHale's Navy"") in several episodes. Classic TV that holds up well.

HOWEVER, there are many, many reasons TO NOT PURCHASE this set, First of all these episodes are the SYNDICATED versions, and are NOT UNCUT! In fact, several have horrible, disjointed cuts where material was excised and the scene begins in the middle. Each show should run 27 minutes, but instead they are clocking in around 25 1/2, which is unacceptable. This fact is not mentioned in any advertising or the box - which to me is pure deception.

Second, these shows are OUT OF ORDER - they are neither presented by production nor air date! If you're aiming for the hard-core DVD collector market, why would you mix the episodes up - especially as there is character development as the season progressed? In another forum, the DVD makers said they spoke with Car 54 ""experts"" who helped decide the order. I don't believe it. My guess? The episodes are arranged this way for music licensing and the like. Rhino did this with their Monkees TV VHS box set years ago. That is, episodes were not in order due to ""licensing fees"" (read: cheap.)

Menu authoring is barely at a public-domain level. There are no animated menus, no Car 54 theme playing in the background, no scene selection, no play all function. Each DVD menu is a static and colorized photo of Toody and Muldoon with episode titles. No motion at all. Very, very shoddy.

Then there there are the DVDs themselves. Looking for a really neat photo of the cast or member on each disk? Well, don't look here as the disks are this putrid brown, with no photos or other Car 54 art. The packaging is also very shabby, with the four disks falling out immediately when opening. Couldn't they have sprung a little $$$$ for secure packaging? The ""Package Designer,"" Lorien Babajan, should be fired over this botched DVD set and should never again ""design"" any future sets.

Of course, there is NO detailed episode list, NO episode commentaries, NO booklet, NO cast bios. Nothing. Nada. I own probably 60 or so TV series on DVD and this is absolutely the worst one.

Car 54 deserves better handling than this. I've written to Shout Factory (who create amazing DVD sets) and suggested that they license season two instead of the pikers that created this box set.

4396824,5,B004KDYR5W,"This is an excellent comedy. The actors and plots (that take unexpected twists) form the magical chemistry that makes for great shows.

Car 54 lasted only two seasons, but this was due to it's having been scheduled in the time slot of death, being up against ""The Ed Sullivan Show"". Nothing survived in that time slot, for ten years, until Ed faded. Adults were glued to ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" and we kids had homework to do, on Sunday nights, because we left it until the last minute.

Although I give credit to Shanachie for releasing this, they did make some poor decisions in the approach. These are syndicated versions, lacking the full content. Additionally, they decided, in their infinite wisdom, to arrange the shows according to ""popularity"" (who knows how they came to decide which episode is popular and which isn't) rather than their original order. The DVD case is very odd as well and will likely end up causing the DVD's to break in the longer run.",1303516800,5,964,4.6982248520710055

4396826,5,B004KDYR5W,"Car 54 is my favorite TV show of all time. I first saw it growing up on Nick at Night back in the 80's. Since it left the airwaves I have often dreamed of seeing it revived on DVD.

It took many years but finally we have the first season of Car 54 on DVD! Like most reviewers I was put-off at first by the historically incorrect running order of the programs. And then the unusual packaging... But after reading a review from Amazon I knew to open the DVD case carefully in the event that the discs came flying out at me (and they did!).

But I think we're looking a gift horse in the mouth. Yes, the proper episode order would be nice, but it's not a deal breaker. Once you put these discs in your machine and start watching them you won't care about such things anymore. You'll simply roll around on the floor and soil yourself with laughter. This show is the funniest ever made, regardless of the order you watch the episodes in.

The packaging is...different. The discs are sort of spring-loaded into the cardboard digipak. It's odd, but not horrible. If you are careful and treat the packaging with respect I don't see how it could become much of a problem.

The picture quality on these shows is the best we're likely to ever see. It is clean for the most part and very easy on the eyes. The audio has some hiss but is clear and easy to understand. Overall I think the team at Shanachie did as good a job as one could expect.

We should be thankful to have these shows in our possession again at all and not knock the company who has provided us with them. While the episode order decision was questionable, it is not unforgivable. Spend 25 minutes with Toody and Muldoon and see if you can still find anything worth complaining about.

I'm ready for Season 2 whenever you are, Shanachie. Thanks.",1303257600,12,1802,4.348214285714286
4396827,5,B004KDYR5W,"Watched all of them and this is a great collection. The prints looked great and I got a lot of laughs out of them. Robert Klein's interview with Charlotte Rae & Hank Garrett was very interesting. I can't wait until Season 2!

As for the two ""issues' with this release. I would have preferred them to be in broadcast order. That's the order I watched them in. It involved a lot of back and forth but the packaging did not cause a problem. I actually liked the way they were packaged. It was easier to get in and out than some of those that have that annoying tab in the center that I find hard to release. I had no trouble with manipulating the disks in and out of packaging. It caused no scratches.

If they tried to put the ""best"" ones up front, they did a good job selecting them. Disk One had most of my favorites & Disk 4 ended with ""Christmas at the 83rd"", which could easily be called the least funny. Least funny but still pretty darn funny. However, if the casual viewer watched these in order ended  on a slightly ""low note"" (like Captain Block sings in that episode), they might end their experience a little less satisfied & willing to buy Season 2. Of course, even Toody would buy Season 2, but I'm just saying.

But thanks loads, Shanachie! If this goes well, how about some of my other favorites: THE MANY LOVES OF DOBIE GILLIS, MY WORLD AND WELCOME TO IT or (please!) HE & SHE?",1303257600,4,1392,4.281368821292776

Bilko. Every actor / actress on the show was a delight.  Sadly, Car 54 lasted only 2 seasons and I hope the popularity of Season 1 with folks like myself will generate the 2nd season to be put out.  I would like to see the discs packaged differently.  They are NOT on spindles and I was saying a little prayer while releasing them from the case.",1303257600,6,670,4.430894308943089

As for the episodes not being in broadcast order. They should have been but in all fairness you really only need to see the first 8-10 episodes in their correct order since both Al Lewis and Ms Rae appear as different characters in the early episodes of the show.

4396830,4,B004KDYR5W,"In the fall of 1961, Sunday nights on NBC featured two refugees from ABC, and a classic TV western.  From monochromatic ABC came Rocky and his Friends, repackaged in color as The Bullwinkle Show, at 7 pm (pt/et), and the Disney anthology series, rebranded as Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, at 7:30 pm (pt/et).  The western was Bonanza, which took over the 9 pm slot, having debuted the previous year at 7:30 pm on Saturdays.

Sandwiched between these shows, at 8:30, was a black and white island, a comedic masterpiece, Car 54, Where Are You?

Nat Hiken was the genius behind this sitcom, as well as an earlier uniformed classic, Sgt. Bilko.  Both shows, unfortunately, had all two brief runs.  In the case of Car 54, according to the roundtable supplement, it is unclear why the show lasted only two seasons.  Ownership feud between Hiken and NBC?  The incredible difficulty of working with series co-star Joe E. Ross?  Whatever it was, the limited number of episodes made syndication of this property difficult, and, for most of the 50 years since its original production, off of television.

Those of us who watched in its first run remember a little of the well-written weekly farces, as Hiken and company took reality, and coaxed it one step further.  In one episode, the police officers invest their small charoty fund in a solid company, whose stock crashes after investors get nervous over constantly seeing the policemen run in and out of the CEO's office, seeking answers to some rather inane questions.  In another, a plain-clothes operation turns upside down when Wally Cox, playing a wannabe cop turned pick-pocket, turns the tables and arrests his fellow pick-pockets, as well as an out-of-his-depth Toody.

This long-awaited DVD is a good news/bad news proposition.  It is nice to have the episodes, apparently in as good a shape as could be expected.  It is unclear if there are any cuts, but the shows seem to be all there.

I differ with a lot of people on the packaging.  I hate spindles; if they are not precisely sized, you seem to be risking breaking the DVD just taking it out out.  I have not had a problem with the DVD's getting scratched or falling out, so losing the spindle is no big deal to me.

On the other hand, there is minimal information about the contents of the DVD's.  No booklet with synopses and air dates.  And, as has been pointed out, the episodes are not in broadcast order.  Yes, this is not a soap opera, and each episode stands on its own.  But it would have been nice to trace the growth of the show through its first season.  And, as has been pointed out, actors with one-time parts eventually became regulars, and it would be nice to be able to watch that development through a chronological presentation.  Hopefully, they will get it right next time.  And hopefully there will be a next time, for there are some classic shows in the second season.",1303171200,4,2907,4.684418145956608

I have never seen a DVD package that didn't use spindles until now. It is not safe to hold the DVDs in by their edges, it could lead to more scratching of the discs. Plus when I opened the package, two DVDs fell into my hands (not good). Now I purchased this item pretty much sight unseen because the show was memorable. If I had read the reviews I probably would still have bought Car 54, but I would be more careful opening it. I have read reviews of other DVD sets and have not ordered them because the content was produced in a substandard fashion. As for Car 54, it is still a great show with Joe E. Ross as Gunther (""ooh, ooh"")Toody, Fred Gwynne as Francis Muldoon, Al Lewis as Leo Schnauser, Charlotte Rae as Silvia Schnauser.

This deserves a far better release than it's given here. The fact the price was cut in half once and then I received a one dollar discount after it shipped was telling. When I received the set the disks were rattling loose in the envelope. The holder has the absolutely worst mounting ever conceived. The third and forth disks, the middle episode of each refuse to play in three different players... leads me to believe it's the disks.  To return them I need to print a return label,, means buying a printer for the return label, shipping envelope etc. Best to write off the unplayable parts. Even with the botched packaging and faulty disks this is an absolutly brilliant comedy show. I sincerly wish I could award this  five stars, I really do.

4396841,5,B004KDYR5W,"Back in 1961, one of the popular comedy shows on television was ""Car 54, Where Are You?"".  The series had a New York flavor as it was shot in the Bronx and despite rumors at the time that the series used canned laughter, an audience did watch the series and their laughter was recorded and synced to the series before airing on NBC.

Featuring episodes written by Nat Hiken (known for his work on many sitcoms) and episodes directed by Hiken along and also Al De Caprio and Stanley Prager, the series would last two seasons from 1961-1963 but the only reason for it being canceled was not due to ratings but because NBC wanted to own 50% of the show, which the owners/studio responsible for the sitcom was unwilling to give up.

While the series remained dormant for many years, it wasn't until 1987 when many people had a chance to watch the show on ""Nick at Nite"" back in 1987 and it would run on that cable channel through 1990 and then later on airing on Comedy Central throughout the early '90s and led to a 1994 film adaptation which was poorly drafted and didn't do well in the box office (although, original cast members Lewis and Russell did appear in the film).

But many have wanted a DVD release of ""Car 54, Where Are You? and finally, Shanachie Entertainment will be releasing the series newly remastered on DVD starting with the complete first season in April 2011.

""Car 54, Where Are You?"" is a series about two NYPD police officers Gunther Toody (played by Joe E. Ross) and Francis Muldoon (played by Fred Gwynne).  Both work for the fictional 53rd precinct in the Bronx and are assigned to Patrol Car 54.

Unfortunately, both officers are not too bright and are an embarrassment to the police force as they tend to cause more trouble than capturing the criminals.  While the short and stocky Officer Gunther Toody who is not so smart, is more apt to getting in trouble, the tall and skinny officer Muldoon is one to have bright ideas but somehow, due to Toody being the person who tends to make the decisions, ends up getting both in trouble.

""Car 54, Where Are You? - The Complete First Season"" includes the following episodes (spoilerless summaries):

VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Car 54, Where Are You? - The Complete First Season"" receives the special treatment with remastering (mastered from the original 35 mm film) and presented in black and white (full screen), although there are scratches and dust that can be seen if you are focused on looking at them, the picture quality for this TV series that is 50-years-old is fantastic.

I've seen old series that look terrible and it's good to know that the series looks great on DVD.  You do see interlacing and edge enhancement but for the most part, I don't think any fan could feel bad about the picture quality as this series looks very good considering its age. While the majority of all the episodes have very good contrast, strong blacks and good grays, there are some episodes where the interlacing and dust is a slight bit noticeable such as ""How High Is Up"" but for the most part, the majority of all the episodes look very good.

I'm not too familiar with Shanachie's DVD releases but if they continue the quality for their classic series as they have done with this release, that would be awesome!

Audio is presented in monaural and dialogue is clear and understandable.  No hissing, pops, crackle or any terrible audio issues at all!

There are no subtitles in this release.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Friday Night Lights: The Fifth and Final Season"" comes with the following special features:

DISC 4

  * Interview - (30:00) A special interview for this DVD release featuring actor/comedian Robert Klein interviewing cast members Charlotte Rae (who plays Sylvia Schnauser) and Hank Garrett (who plays Officer Ed Nicholson) about the cast, memories of the series and Nat Hiken and to also comment on rumors of the series that have lasted for so many years.  A very entertaining round table conversation.

EXTRAS:

""Car 54, Where Are You? - The Complete First Season"" is presented in a digipack case.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Brilliantly written, hilarious and fun!  ""Car 54, Where Are You?"" is a delightful, classic comedy series that made me people laugh back in 1961 and will continue to make people laugh today!

This series written by Nat Hiken was an absolute blast because the comedy was well-written, the laughter by the audience helped enhance the excitement of the series and interesting enough, the partnership of Joe E. Ross and Fred Gwynne as Officer Toody and Muldoon and the other police officers of Precinct 53 were just fun to watch.  The series had a touch of vaudeville but it was its writing that made it so hilarious and fun!

My first introduction to this comedy series like many people during the '90s was on ""Nick at Nite"".  I have never ever heard of this series until it was shown on television late during my high school years and suffice to say, you would imagine that this series would have received a VHS release during the '90s but unfortunately by the time it did come out on VHS, it was already 1999.

So, there was no doubt that many people have been awaiting the release of ""Car 54, Where Are You?"" on DVD.  And when these were released on VHS, you were only treated with two episodes per video tape.  And many wondered if the format if the series was release on DVD would be four episodes per DVD but time had pass and I figured, may this series was lost.  Sure enough, ""Car 54, Where Are You?"" gets its HD treatment courtesy of Shanachie Entertainment, a company that I was not familiar with and sure enough, this is a solid release!

Among my favorite episodes from this DVD release was ""What Happened to Thursday"", ""No More Pickpockets"", ""Today I am a Man"" and to tell you the truth, every episode was entertaining.  I don't think there was one that I found to be terrible.  Each episode made me laugh and there were many episodes I have not seen before, so it was great to finally watch the first season in its entirety.

In fact, once I received this DVD for review, it was a ""Car 54, Where Are You?"" marathon at my home as I could not stop watching.  It's that good!

As for the DVD, all 30 episodes from the first season, were remastered from the original 35 mm film and picture quality is great.  As mentioned, there is a bit of interlacing and some dust but by no means is bad or does it take away from the enjoyment of the series.  The majority of the episodes do look good especially considering the age of this series. As for audio, there is no audible hissing or pops at all.  And although it would be nice to have some featurette included for the special featuers, I'm so happy that a 2011 interview with Charlotte Rae and Hank Garrett was included and the information from this Q&A roundtable was pretty awesome, especially hearing how Joe E. Ross was during the taping and how he presented himself in public! Wow!

But I was very pleased with this DVD release and fans of the series should expect to be entertained.  Personally, ""Car 54, Where Are You?"" is one of the best situational comedies ever created and it's sad that this series has not been replayed on television as much as it should have.

But its release on DVD featuring all 30 episodes for the first season for under $25 is an awesome deal!  And I look forward to watching the second season!

Highly recommended!",1302652800,8,11132,4.538229376257545

4396843,4,B004KDYR5W,"First of all, This is a great show, and I'm glad to see it out on DVD. The quality of the video is good, they did nice job there. However, what they did not do a nice job with is the packaging - Shanachie should fire Lorien Babajian for providing such a poorly designed package. With a cardboard package I kind of expect there to be a slipcase, but Shanachie does not provide one. That's strike one.

What is even worse are the way the discs are stored within the package. It is just horrendous!!! I have never seen anything like it before, and I hope I never have to see it again! Most cases have some sort of spindle that the discs snap into from the center hole. Not Car 54, no way - this case has slots at the bottom that the discs ""slide"" into and are held in place by a little plastic tab on each side. Very frustrating packaging. I can easily see a lot of returns for people who scratch their discs getting them out, or even people cracking them if they use force, so heads up Amazon! The instructions are printed directly on the discs (how tacky): ""To Remove From Tray - Push Down, Pull Up"" - YEAH I GET THAT, RIGHT? This is also where it would have been a good idea to include a slip case, just in case the discs get dislodged from this dreadful packaging!- That is Strike Two - Needless to say, I promptly removed the discs from the package and stored them in slim line cases next to the original on my shelf.

I STRONGLY RECOMMEND ANYONE WHO PURCHASES THIS RELEASE TO HAVE EMPTY CASES READY TO PUT THE DISCS IN.

Finally strike three is the lack of information that comes with such a great series - all you get is the name of each episode printed behind where the discs are stored, and if the episode had a guest star it says ""with (so and so)"" after the title. No original airdate, no synopsis, no booklet, nothing. Something like that would have really helped this release, especially since Shanachie did NOT PUT THEM IN ORIGINAL AIRDATE ORDER! So, if you want to watch them in the order you aired, you have to do your OWN research first, then piece them together, switching discs. What a botched job. According to the site TVShows on DVD.com, Shanachie determined ""the most attractive presentation would be to have the episodes ordered by popularity"" I tend to disagree with that logic. But anyway, all the episodes are there and the quality is nice, so I am only downgrading one star overall.

If I could rate the packaging that would be less than one star, your flawed designed is forcing me to take up valuable extra real estate on my shelf, no other series has done that to me.",1302652800,119,2595,4.333333333333333

4396845,1,B004KDYR5W,"I was about ten years old when this series first aired, and I remember it as being one of my favorite television programs at that time.  I looked forward to the weekly antics of Officers Gunther Toody and Francis Muldoon. Many years later I was very happy to learn that the first season of the series was being released on DVD.  That is until I heard who the company was that planned to release them.  When I found out that they were being released by Shanachie, I became a bit apprehensive.  This was the same company that, about six years ago, issued four DVD's containing eight episodes of Pete Seeger's landmark folk music TV series ""Rainbow Quest.""  Since 2005 there have been no further releases of ""Rainbow Quest,"" and no word from Shanachie.  I emailed them on three occasions and received no reply.  So I wouldn't look forward to seeing season two of Car 54 anytime soon.

Also, Shanachie has released these programs in random order on the DVD's, not in the order they were produced or broadcast.  This is totally insane. There can be no reason for this other than carelessness.  I have many other DVD sets of old TV programs such as Andy Griffith, I Love Lucy, The Lucy Show, Honeymooners, The Waltons, Thriller, and most recently, Dennis the Menace.  All of them are in original broadcast order.  There is no reason why Car 54, Where Are You could have not received the same treatment.  It is disappointing that after waiting all of these years for this to come out, the company releasing the DVD's screws up like this.  This will be the only release of Car 54 on video for the foreseeable future, and it is a shame that it has been not done correctly.

To be fair, the video quality is quite good for a TV show of this vintage, and the bonus interview is a very informative look back at the program.",1302566400,16,1811,4.495412844036697

Not a major complaint - I'm certainly glad to have these episodes remastered.

4396852,5,B004KDYR5W,"Nat Hiken was a writer for radio comedy programs featuring Milton Berle, and Fred Allen.  He eventually moved to the then new medium of television, where he created the The Phil Silvers Show (1955-59), a multi Emmy Award winning comedy, based on life in the army.  Hiken followed up by creating Car 54 Where Are You? (1961-63), which ran for two seasons, each containing 30 episodes.

Car 54 focuses on the comedic adventures of New York City police officers Gunther Toody (Joe E. Ross) and Francis Muldoon (Fred Gwynne), who patrol the 53rd precinct in the Bronx, under the command of Captain Martin Block (Paul Reed).  Officer Leo Schnauser (Al Lewis) is one of the semi-regular characters.  Ross, a standup comic with big eyes and a gravelly voice, whose trademark saying was ""ooh, ooh"", had previously worked with Hiken on the Phil Silvers Show.  Gwynne and Lewis who both would later star in the TV series The Munsters (1964-66), had also worked with Hiken, during appearances on the Silvers program.

Short and stocky, Officer Toody is not too sharp, is henpecked by his wife Lucille (Ruth Masters), and is something of a schemer.  Muldoon is single, shy, rather intelligent, and towers in height over everyone.  Together, they make a great team, although it is probably fortunate that crime is not high in the 53rd precinct.  Life around the stationhouse has some similarities to an army barracks, and some of the same military gags, easily migrate to the police precinct.

In the series premiere Muldoon and Toody scheme to getaway on a fishing trip to catch some swordfish.  In the hilarious episode ""Love Finds Muldoon"", the confirmed bachelor Muldoon, finds himself the target of the attentions of Bonnie Calsheim (Alice Ghostly) one of Lucille's friends with a strange fixation on the actor Ramon Novarro.  Partners for nine years, Gunther and Francis draw attention from the brass for being together for so long, in ""Change Your Partners"".  It's a crisis at the highest level, in ""How High Is Up?"" when Muldoon finds that he has grown to 6'-7"", and according to regulations is too tall to be a cop.  Officer Schnauser is disoriented, when he is pulled off from his horse, and assigned a human partner, in ""Schnauster's Last Ride"".  Wally Cox guests as an ace pickpocket working the crowd at Yankee Stadium in the outrageous ""No More Pickpockets"".  Cox is nabbed by Toody who is working undercover, but the criminal manages to turn the tables, and Toody, Muldoon, and Captain Block all spend time in lockup.

Nat Hiken, Terry Ryan, and Tony Webster, were the principal writers in Season One, with Al DeCaprio handling most of the directing duties.  Hiken also wrote the lyrics for the catchy opening theme song.  For old fashioned, clean, good-natured fun, check into this very well-written and always lively series.",1300492800,8,2828,4.9261603375527425

Although I was only seven in 1961, I well remember the iconic song and the laughter of my parents as they watched the programme on our tiny black and white screen. Having watched episodes on YouTube, and obtained some dodgy Chinese DVD's of appalling quality, I'm over the moon that the first series is finally being officially issued. Although all the characters are great, my favourites will always be Bea Pons and Charlotte Rae - both still alive, according to Wikipedia!

8432857,5,B004KDYR5W,"CAR 54 WHERE ARE YOU is a television series about the 53rd precinct in the Bronx borough of New York City. All of the episodes were first aired on television from September 1961 to April 1963.

About a year ago, I re-connected with Car 54 Where Are You, and rapidly became a devotee, and in the past year have enjoyed watching the very same episode two or three times. From the first season, in particular, I like ""I WON'T GO,"" which stars Molly Picon. I WON'T GO concerns an elderly woman who is facing eviction from her apartment in a decrepit apartment building in New York City. The building has been possessed by the city, and it has been condemned, and is on the verge of being torn down. A recurring theme in this story is the fact that the door buzzer does not work, the plumbing for the kitchen sink does not work, and that the apartment needs painting. But Molly Picon's charming approach to these problems, is that when city official come to give her eviction notices, or trespassing citations, or other notices, Molly Picon's character always greets them happily takes the notice, and then places the eviction notice in a kitchen drawer along with her other previously-received eviction notices, or she places the trespassing citation in a shelf in the kitchen cabinet along with her previously-received notices, and so on with the other types of notices that she'd received. Another charming aspect of this particular story, is that Molly Picon's character displays Yiddish charm, and manages to convince Toody and Muldoon to sit down for tea and cake, and she manages to convince the engineer in charge of wrecking the building (played by Al Lewis), and she manages to convince other city officials, all to sit down in her kitchen for a snack of tea and cake. Also, Molly Picon further succeeds, using her Yiddish charm, to convince these threatening visitors to fix the doorbell and to repair the plumbing. And then, about 85% into the story, the question is raised as to why Molly Picon does not want to leave her condemned apartment building. The rest of this story, that is, the remaining 15%, is clever and surprising, and I do not disclose what it is. The ending of ""I WON'T GO"" is just as clever and surprising as the best of the black and white Twilight Zone episodes.

Regarding the Car 54 Where Are You series, the main characters are Muldoon played by Fred Gwynne, Toody played by Joe E. Ross, the amusingly strident Lucille Toody played by Beatrice Pons, the weird Schnauser played by Al Lewis, and Captain Paul Block played by Paul Reed. A recurring theme in many of the episodes is the fact that Captain Block reluctantly endures and accepts the incompetance and excessively informal remarks that Toody makes, during the course of his police work. As such, the Captain Block character engages in frequent eye-rolling, when he hears about more of Toody's incompetence. The writers include Nat Hiken, Marty Roth, Terry Ryan, and Tony Webster.",1510012800,2,2968,4.772373540856031
