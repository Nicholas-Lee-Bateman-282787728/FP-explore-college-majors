8304788,5,B001GBIORS,"Great workout! I've been using this for years now, and it's still good. I especially like that you can pick a workout based on how much time you have or if you want to just switch it up. I think there's anywhere from about 30 minutes to over an hour. While their workout does use a good bit of room, it really isn't difficult to make minor adjustments to make it work in your living room. I usually work out in my living room, which is about a 10x7 ft space, and it's been fine. Sometimes I've ever done it in a smaller space and it hasn't been a problem.

Like other reviewers said, this isn't really a dome-focused work out, so if you are looking for that, you probably want something different. I wanted hi-lo aerobics, so I was happy to see that the dome part wasn't really a big thing in this.

People have also mentioned that she moves quickly from thing to thing without much explanation. That is sort of true. She does call out moves, but at first you don't always know exactly what she means. I've taken some aerobics classes before, but not all that much, so maybe if you have done more you will be more familiar with the moves she calls. However you can catch on quickly after doing it just a few times. After doing it around 5 times, you're a pro, so explanation would just slow the workout down a ton. I personally think it's done at the right level for a dvd.

If you're looking for hi-lo aerobics, I would definitely recommend this one! And good luck with your exercise goals!",1484524800,,1491,4.298932384341637
8304789,2,B001GBIORS,She moves way too fast and the routine requires a lot of room. It is hard to do in your living room.,1411171200,,100,3.590909090909091
8304790,1,B001GBIORS,You may get a cardio workout but it will be frustrating. Amy Bento is not a good instructor. She blurts out what moves to do and starts with no direction. If you don't know her terminology you will probably have difficulty keeping up. I've been doing aerobics & kickboxing for 10+ years and would not recommend this to anyone.,1282694400,,326,4.5423728813559325
8304791,5,B001GBIORS,"High/low aerobics has been around for a while.  Amy gives a fresh new look and feel to it.  It's all high energy for 65 minutes.  I start this workout thinking to myself, ""I'll only do about half of it, since I'm tired.""  But by the 30 minute mark, I have my second wind and really put my all into it.  The time flies by.

What I love about this workout:

**You'll get a great workout, no matter what.  Even if you're following the modifier, Jody, your heart will be pumping.

**Amy's energy is catching.

**Amy's teaching style.  She breaks down each move, you do it a few times and then she teaches the next part of the move.  Her moves can be a bit complicated, but I love it since it makes me think.

**The music is peppy and upbeat and really helps push you to work harder.

**The 25 minute dome (aka bosu) total body workout at the end. Amy uses a bosu and a 7 pound woody bag (kind of like a small duffel bag).  I use an 8 pound med ball instead.  This is a total body endurance workout that keeps your heart rate elevated.  Needless to say I can't do this workout on the same day I'm doing the high/low routine since I don't have the energy.

**Modifications are shown for lower impact and also if you don't have a bosu. Angela does the dome workout with a step and small dumbbell.

**The premixes for shorter or longer workouts.  Some of the premixes incorporate the bosu workout as well.

If you're looking for a fun, high energy high/low impact workout, this one is for you!",1281398400,,1485,4.250896057347671
8304792,5,B001GBIORS,"I need my cardio, it keeps me sane.  Yes, I understand the benefits of intervals & using weights.  There are very few options (as far as fitness dvds go) that can compare to the intensity Amy brings!  I end up sweating buckets. After the workout, I feel amazing!  It's an endorphine rush, and I am a total addict =)  Highly recommend this for those looking for an intense cardio workout!!

There is a bosu (dome) workout out on the dvd. For those that don't have a bosu - there is a modifier and she uses a step. It may not be as long, but it is intense. Your legs/glutes will feel the burn, and good luck walking after ;)

The only drawback is the choreography. The first couple of times you do the workout, some moves may frustrate you. You will get the hang of it, be patient, it's worth it!",1276300800,,794,4.218543046357616
8304793,5,B001GBIORS,"I loved this DVD! It's a fun workout with interesting moves that definitely get your heart rate up there. The dome challenge is an excellent secondary shorter workout too. Definitely set up the same as all Amy DVDs with lots of her sunny encouragement and great pumping dance music. If you haven't tried Amy, you're missing out!",1262736000,,328,4.771929824561403
8304794,5,B001GBIORS,"I was excited when i purchased this workout, because I thought it would be a hi-lo/aerobic workout using the BOSU. It turns out it's not a high-lo workout dome challenge, it is a high-lo workout, with a short BONUS dome workout at the end. If you're looking for a BOSU cardio workout, this isn't it. If you want a good high-lo aerobic workout with something different thrown in, this is great for you. What I do really, really like about this workout, is that there are ""nrg"" mixes. You can choose from several different routine mixes and workout lengths 27-80 mins, I choose a shorter one if I want sqeeze in a before work workout.
I initially gave this workout 4 stars, but I changed it to 5, this is one of my favorites, even if it wasn't what I'd expected.",1254528000,12,760,4.397163120567376
8304795,5,B001GBIORS,"This is my favorite Amy Bento workout.  The whole workout is so much fun.  The dome workout at the end is awesome.  If you don't have a bosu ball or woody bag, you can use a step and dumbell instead.  The dome workout gives a whole body resistance workout.  The aerobics section has fun moves and great music.  There is an interval between each aerobics section to keep the intensity high.",1246838400,,389,4.408450704225352
8304796,5,B001GBIORS,I am a fitness professional that every once in a while needs a butt kicking from someone other then me & this video delivered!  Cathe and Amy Bento are two fitness professionals who release the beast!,1237420800,,200,4.555555555555555
8304797,5,B001GBIORS,"I'm a couple of years late in purchasing this one, but that doesn't diminish the fun in this workout.  As usual, Amy's choreography is refreshing and challenging; you are really dripping with sweat early into this one.  The added Dome workout is great and completely modifiable.  I use a step bench (like Jodi) and I substitute a heavy medicine ball instead of the ""woody bag"".  I also use a kettlebell instead of a hand weight for some of the core exercises.",1236556800,,459,4.62962962962963
