2322313,5,B0009UZGAU,"If you are tired of all the twaddle out there in TV land for preschoolers and kindergarteners, you have come to the right place.  Peep not only has cute characters, it has a point to all of it's stories.  And not just facts!

[Not that there is anything wrong with facts, but facts alone do not an education make.]

What really stands out about this series, in my opinion, is it's ability to teach children reasoning skills.  Every episode has a problem and Peep, Duck (my personal favorite), Chirp and company demonstrate the various ways that one can look at the problem; and how one might approach the problem to solve it.

Failure?  That just means you need to think some more, maybe reframe the problem, and try again.

Four Stars.  Great price for these three DVD's.  Cute characters and charming, simple presentation that children can't resist.  (Mom either--lol)  The stories provide teaching moments that most other shows don't.  Logic and reasoning as well as facts.",1138579200,7,976,4.807228915662651

2322389,5,B0009UZGAU,"Our almost 3 year old loves this show! The colors are bold. The drawing are simple. The names are easy. The theme for each show is educational, and MY favorite part is listening to Joan Cusack talk and narrate.",1451606400,,210,4.410256410256411

2322453,5,B0009UZGAU,"Peep is a great show for our 3 year old.  It's humor is right at his level (he's always laughing while watching it), but it keeps up laughing too. Most shows have a science message and a short clip after the cartoon that talks more about the science (buoyancy ,color theory, things like that).

Peep is non-violent, engaging and smart.  Our family loves him.",1384300800,,358,4.5625
2322454,5,B0009UZGAU,My young daughter loves these DVDs. There are quite a few episodes on each and they are very neat. Those who enjoy peep will be very happy with this set.,1378857600,,153,4.133333333333334
2322455,5,B0009UZGAU,"Son loves this show and can't get enough of them. We can watch them over and over and neither of us get bored; which is a huge plus. Glad I invested in these and you should too, you and your kids will enjoy them!",1375488000,,212,3.840909090909091
2322456,1,B0009UZGAU,"This is not the only review warning you not to buy!!  The DVDs almost instantly break when removing from the holders.  The crack from the center out, making them instant land fill.  I have hundreds of DVDs and I know how to take them out of the holder - it is not just me!!!",1372723200,2,274,4.037037037037037
2322457,4,B0009UZGAU,"The disks are hard to remove from the cases.  It took about 6 months (I cracked immediately, the next a few months later and so on) but eventually all three have cracked near the center and are in the garbage.  I have not had this issue with any of the other DVDs I purchased individually.  I cannot say enough good things about Peep but be wary of this set of DVDs.",1372636800,,366,4.126760563380282
2322458,5,B0009UZGAU,"My kids used to watch this on PBS when they were very little (1-3) and they enjoyed the simple bright colors and gentle nature of this cartoon.  On a whim I put in on TV recently and they fell in love with it again (5-7).  They love the quick whit of Chirp, the sweetness of Peep and the sassy Quack.  I enjoy it as well when it is time for them to wind down at night.",1372550400,,368,3.8157894736842106
2322459,5,B0009UZGAU,"Charlotte loves Peep, Quack and Chirp. She enjoys watching in the car.
She can't wait to get some more Peep DVDs",1370822400,,112,4.380952380952381
2322460,2,B0009UZGAU,"My family LOVES this program.  It is the best children's show of all.  So, you can imagine our disappointment when I (Mommy) actually cracked two of the three DVDs when removing them from the case!  I've never encountered this problem before and can only conjecture a problem with the case manufacturing.  I had to throw away two of the three discs.  What a sad waste!",1370822400,,368,4.6
2322461,5,B0009UZGAU,My 2 year old daughter can't get enough of these DVDs.  They are enjoyable and promote learning opportunities as well.,1360368000,,118,4.9
2322472,5,B0009UZGAU,"We love Peep and his friends. The programs are engaging and educational, full of great concepts. I was glad to find a set of these together, well worth the money.",1330300800,,162,4.433333333333334
2322473,5,B0009UZGAU,"My daughter has loved the Peep and the Big Wide World show for a long time, but after we moved to a new state we didn't have access to the show anymore.  So it was great to find these DVDs.  This set comes with 3 individual, full-length DVDs, so I think it is a great bargain if you have a kid that is already familiar with Peep and Pals and you know they will watch them all.

The Peep and the Big Wide World show is great for kids ages 3-8, or so.  The subject of the stories is generally the exploration of the world around you, but in an amusing way.  As an adult, I don't find the characters to be annoying in the way that so many young kids shows can be (everything in moderation, though).",1326067200,,695,4.007246376811594
2322474,5,B0009UZGAU,I have 5 kiddos ranging from 9-1 and we love these video's.  They are no longer on our PBS line up so for my little guys BD we ordered 2 boxed sets for a steal!  The kids will all sit and watch and there is no violence only sweet little lessons!  Plus it is not an irritating cartoon like some!  I know it's probably a little young for my older kids but hey I just put it on for the younger two and as soon as the opening music starts they all find their way to the TV LOL  --great purchase!  Wish they would come out with toys!,1313366400,,528,3.8425925925925926
2322475,5,B0009UZGAU,"We recently moved, and our new cable provider does not include this PBS show. Bummer!  But I was so happy I had purchased this 3 DVD set prior to the move ( 18 hour drive w/ a 20 month old) - she loves Peep!  Over a 3 day period, 6 hours / day in the car, this DVD set really helped to get us through the trip.....

I have to say it is one of my favorites to sit through with her. Each episodes is about 10 minutes in length, and there are 8 episodes on each disk. In between the episodes are shorter snipets of kids doing things (relative to what the peep episode was about).  It's entertaining, educational and short enough that I don't feel guilty letting her watch these.  I will admit that I have continued to watch once she's gone down for her nap. HA!  Highly recommend!",1299801600,,777,4.112582781456954
2322476,5,B0009UZGAU,"My Granddaughter stumbled onto Peep and Quack at the library.  She is three and we took her to the library for her storytime every week.  It was a great program.  Think about it for your children.  While there, she ""did her work"" on the computer and one of the applications was Peep and Quack.  Great animation that teaches children about life and how to act.  Great Series and Amazon did a great job getting it to her.  Thanks.",1298246400,,428,4.410256410256411
2322477,5,B0009UZGAU,"Who doesn't love Peep? It is an awesome cartoon, even for adults. I would recommend Peep to anyone with children ages 3-10",1297555200,,122,4.590909090909091
2322478,5,B0009UZGAU,"My kids LOVE this series and have since a very young age. This is hands down their favorite series. I had bought them one DVD two years ago, and now that we've watched it about 200 times, I thought I better buy a few more to change things up once in awhile.

These cartoon segments are cute, funny, and just the right length of time to hold their attention. In between each cartoon is a segment of real little kids doing different sorts of simple scientific experiments relating to things that happened in the previous episode. I think it's just the right combination and our almost 3-year old has wants to try the ""experiments"" all the time. Our 2-year old cracks up hysterically, so I know it's simple enough for him to understand.

As I mentioned, we watch these over and over on long car rides. Even though I have the entire first DVD memorized verbatim, I am still entertained by the show, and it's not one of those that makes a parent totally crazy to listen to often.

The colors are bright, the animation is simple, and I personally love that Joan Cusack narrates. My kids get up and sing and dance to the intro song every time, and it's just a great addition to your video library. This 3-pack is a great deal because I bought the first DVD for something like $13, and this is 3 movies for about the price of 2. And once your kids fall in love with Peep you'll be glad you have two more movies on hand.",1278892800,,1411,4.316981132075472
2322479,5,B0009UZGAU,"Anyone who has a child in the home will love these DVDs for their child...the characters are amazing and so funny.  My three year old loves them as do we the parents. Everyone will love it. Plus it has such wonderful life lessons, science projects, imagination going on too. Just great. Enjoy:)",1272758400,,294,4.653846153846154
2322480,5,B0009UZGAU,"I bought this as a really early birthday present for my 3yr. old, so we haven't watched it, but we've gotten lots of other Peep dvd's from our library. Peep is fabulous!!! It's a wonderful, engaging show. Good, clean, and funny! Highly recommend, which is why we bought our own instead of library rental.",1215216000,,304,4.648148148148148
2322481,5,B0009UZGAU,Peep is just a fantastic show.  My 2 year old loves it.  My four year old loves it.  And my wife and I love it.  Very few shows can work on all those levels at once without being byzantine.,1211846400,,189,3.769230769230769
2322500,5,B0009UZGAU,"I don't generally buy too many 'videos' for my kids, but this show is SO great! It's cute, they learn from it and with Joan Cusack narrating - you can't go wrong. We love Peep and his friends! :)",1205107200,,195,4.0256410256410255
2322501,4,B0009UZGAU,"According to my toddler and preschool grandchildren, they can't live without watching Peep and his pals at least once each day.  I don't know much about the DVD's but from my grandkids' point of view, these DVD's are ""dancing"" fun.  I got them a set for Christmas and mom played one of the DVD's while I was at their house and the kids started doing the ""boogie fever"" to the music.  It was the cutest thing I have seen in a long while!",1199059200,,436,4.228915662650603
2322502,5,B0009UZGAU,"We love Peep! My daughter is almost 4 - and we just ""discovered"" (pun intended) Peep by accident while flipping channels.

Joan Cusack's adorable narration along with the cute simple animation and silly but smart dialogue make this the perfect formula for escape from all the other high-octane children's TV out there.

So, if you're looking for a refreshing break from computer animated penguins and their ilk - you'll love Peep.

PS: I was cracking up reading some of these reviews. The theme some IS very catchy! ""Oh, its a sunny day - I feel brand new...! There's about a million things, that I can do...!""",1193011200,,610,4.735849056603773
2322503,5,B0009UZGAU,These are great DVDs.  I just wish they had more of then for purchase.,1175558400,,70,4.0
2322504,5,B0009UZGAU,"I absolutely love watching Peep with my daughter. We began to watch it when she was 22 mos old and has loved it ever since. It's comical for adults while at the same time at a different level funny for the youngsters. I like how it incorporates science with humor and great story-telling. We began to watch it on The Learning Channel via satellite while living in the caribbean, and continued to watch it in Canada. If you don't get this on your cable or satellite, order it. You will not regret it. Your child will want to watch it repeatedly.",1171152000,3,544,4.396039603960396
2322505,5,B0009UZGAU,This is an excellent DVD. I bought this for my grandaughter and grandson. They love it.,1169769600,,87,4.5
2322506,5,B0009UZGAU,My 16 month old granddaughter has been watching Peep and His Pals since she was 6 months old. I bought this set for my 2 month old granddaughter. These are very entertaining with alot of bright colors and music that infants and toddlers like. There are six total DVDs that are available. This is a great series to own.,1168473600,,318,4.406779661016949
2322507,5,B0009UZGAU,peep is as good for adults as it is for children. great stories and great animation. the simplicty and humor is for great for all ages...I just wish they sold Peep merchandise!,1168300800,,176,4.53125
2322508,5,B0009UZGAU,"Great series.  Our son loves them and so do we - they never get annoying !.  Calm, funny and educational.  There is now 3 sets available with 3 discs each.  Just get them all.",1167868800,,175,4.0588235294117645
2322509,5,B0009UZGAU,"PROS:

1.  Joan Cusack narrates them.  :-)

2.  They help to introduce science to children.  Of course at 6 months old my daughter was not capable of following along with the scientific examples and experiments but infants do get a lot out of the simple, colorful shapes moving about and the wonderful music!

3.  As my daughter has grown (far too fast too) she has been able to follow along with the real children at the end of each episode.  They not only help her experiment with the world around her but also help give me ideas for projects that will expand her mind and creativity.

4.  No ulterior motives.  I know this may not pertain to many people, but sometimes books and cartoons can go too far for many parents in trying to establish extremities in concepts those parents would rather keep from their children (extreme sharing, extreme or lack of nature conservation, etc.).  If this does not pertain to you, disregard this ""pro"" then.  But if it does, know that Peep and the Big Wide World strives to bring science and exploration into children's lives and does it without any ""hidden messages"".

5.  The theme song.  That theme song along would send my daughter into dance and laughter so fast!  It's catchy, fun and unfortunately too short.  Do not be disappointed if you need to replay the theme song over and over and over!  :-)

6.  The experiments and projects that are featured in correlation after each episode are tailored to children and are meant to extremely for parents to execute for their kids!  Sometimes you like to go to great lengths to provide entertainment and education for your kids, but these experiments and projects are set up so that you can easily execute them on a daily basis.  Bravo!

CONS:

1.  There are not enough episodes.  Hey, it is the only con I could think of!  But then there are new ones being produced.  We will just need to wait for additional DVDs to be released.

CONCLUSION:

If you have children between the age of 3 months and 12 or older, they can benefit from Peep.  I would highly recommend at least purchasing a single DVD.  But a warning, you'll be hooked and want them all!  :-)",1167868800,11,2146,4.557894736842106
