In my opinion,  DVDs are a good SUPPLEMENT to learning.

(( When the instructor faces you on the video you have to remember which hand/leg is left or right.  That can become tricky!!  When the instructor has their back to you - it is much easier to follow along.))

Overall, a very nice DVD which I study as a supplement to class training.....  I view it all the time.",1405209600,,438,4.2682926829268295
8346802,5,B001VYX8WG,This is a great DVD to use as reference if you are doing the Yang form.  Her accent is very strong but you don't really need to understand her when doing the form or gaining some particular knowledge about the movements because most Taiji practitioners understand the universal language of Taiji anyway!!!,1360886400,,305,4.865384615384615
8346803,3,B001VYX8WG,In general it is still good. This one is not as detailed as her first dvd.  A lot of moves are rushed.  I wished they had spend more time on the moves that were not covered in the first video.,1316044800,2,192,3.775
8346804,5,B001VYX8WG,"Real Tai Chi Chuang, every other version of Tai Chi is occidental adaptation, like Tex-Mex food, I recommend this DVD to everyone who want to learn real TaiChiChuang",1260230400,8,165,4.928571428571429
