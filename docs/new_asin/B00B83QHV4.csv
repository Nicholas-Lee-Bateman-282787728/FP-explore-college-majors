5562704,5,B00B83QHV4,"I loved this movie when it aired on Cartoon Network. However, I have not bought it yet, so I cannot comment on the DVD.",1365120000,4,119,4.0
5562705,4,B00B83QHV4,"I really do not get Viz Media. When this movie aired in Japan, it aired with a Pikachu Short, Meloetta's Sparkling Recital, I believe was the title. The movie is only 1hr 11 min. I believe all the cut out parts are in the movie that were previously not seen when aired on Cartoon Network. My main point is, how are we going to buy the Pikachu Short? I know I normally don't like them, but if they were aired with the movie, then why not PUT them with the movie? They did it with Pokemon Ranger and The Temple of the Sea (movie 9, they even made it on its own disc so it was a 2 disc copy).

The only way to watch the Short is to download the Pokemon TV app and watch it there. Who knows how long it will be there. I am very disappointed. I give this 4 stars because I like the movie, but with no Short, it's like you are buying 2/3 of the movie. I was lucky enough to see this movie in a certain store, today, 4 days before it officially gets released (on April 2).

So people who want this movie and are curious about if the Short comes with, no. You get the options: Play Movie/Stereo, 5.1/ Set-Up/Scene Selection/ and the trailer for the movie.

So looks like for the next movie (Genesect vs Mewtwo), we won't get the Short released with it as well.",1364601600,,1252,4.060728744939271
5562706,5,B00B83QHV4,it was a great movie one of the best I own the first 14 movies when I saw it it was really good,1362441600,,95,3.1739130434782608
5562707,4,B00B83QHV4,"The movie is different from previous films in the series. There is less focus on Ash and crew and more attention to the legendary Pokemon of the film. The animation is done well, with Keldeo and Kyurem's battle full of action, tension, and colorful lighting. The music of the film is also done well. Overall, it's a good film for the Pokemon series.",1362009600,5,349,4.555555555555555
5562708,1,B00B83QHV4,I watched this movie on cartoon network and can say i was NOT impressed at all. It was horrible. I still enjoy watching the pokemon movies but this one didn't catch my attention at all.,1362009600,,185,4.314285714285714
5562709,4,B00B83QHV4,"I personally am hoping that this DVD release is the uncut version dubbed into English and not the edited version seen on Cartoon Network. The film was originally 99 minutes long, but Cartoon Network chopped out almost an entire third of the movie. If this version is the cut version, it's not worth it. It's either uncut or unreleased in my book.",1359590400,8,346,4.596774193548387

5562716,5,B00B83QHV4,Great Pokemon movie and I've seen alot. Great story. My kid loves it. It's great for any Pokemon fan. Although I wish they'd come out with more Blu Ray versions of the films,1409788800,,173,4.2727272727272725

5562718,1,B00B83QHV4,"In my opinion, this is the worst pokmon movie. It had no plot, and If I have to hear Iris shout ""It's Black Kyurem!"" one more time, I just might scream. This is one of maybe four pokmon movies I don't like, so check out the actually Good ones.",1398556800,,243,3.979591836734694
5562719,5,B00B83QHV4,"My kid is a Pokemon fan! It was very hard to find this particular movie. She is very happy with it. Great image, sound and subtitles quality.",1392681600,,141,4.2592592592592595
5562740,3,B00B83QHV4,"The film opens with four Pokemon legendaries playfully battling. These include the ""Swords of Justice"" Cobalion, Terrakion and Virizion as well as the Sword of Justice wannabe Keldeo. Right from the start the animation and action looked better than anything I saw in the disappointing Black/White movie. Keldeo's goal is to become the fourth member of the Swords of Justice but to do this he needs to battle the immensely powerful Boundary Pokemon, Kyurem. When the other Swords tell him he's not ready, Keldeo defiantly heads out on his own to face the mighty dragon in his factory lair. The battle goes very badly and not only is Keldeo beaten down but when the Swords of Justice attempt a save they are frozen solid and a battered Keldeo is forced to flee. Unfortunately you don't just walk away from a fight with Kyurem and the rest of the movie is Kyurem's relentless pursuit of his diminutive foe in order to finish the battle.

Kyurem vs the Swords of Justice has about as simple a plot as one can get. It's almost entirely the fight between two legendaries and Ash Ketchum doesn't even show up until minute 16 of this rather short 66 minute film.  In this case the simplicity of the plot works in the movies favor.  I won't deny that the movie feels very small but it's compact and dense with legendary vs legendary action without a lot of the filler that burdens other Pokemon movies. Inevitably Keldeo is forced into a second and final battle against Kyurem but this time he has the power of friendship behind him which is pretty much the plot of every single Pokemon movie ever made.

Having seen the movie once I can't say I have much interest in seeing it again. It was fun and Kyurem is one of the most visually stunning Pokemon ever particularly when he takes on the power of Zekrom or Reshiram but overall it's a rather shallow story and one viewing will satisfy most people. I had to laugh when during Ash's first scene they play a song about friends forever. In Black/White Ash is now travelling with a new pair of friends and besides Pikachu he has all new Pokemon. So much for friends forever. I'm also not a fan of Ash's generation V Pokemon including a Tepig and the goofy Scraggy who spends all his time pulling his pants up. I'm not a huge fan of a lot of the fifth generation Pokemon but this film is almost exclusively about legendaries with the headliner being Keldeo. Keldeo is one of those annoying Pokemon who is almost impossible to get without a cheating device and was a cheap  gimmick Nintendo likes to use to get people in the theater, at least in Japan where the movies still play in theaters. Americans don't even have the luxury to pick up Keldeo at a live event.",1391904000,4,2701,4.526639344262295
5562741,5,B00B83QHV4,My grandson love it very much. He always ask me to buy these kind of movies to see them at home.,1378166400,,96,3.619047619047619
5562742,4,B00B83QHV4,"I like how I finally get to learn how to pronounce names in this movie. The plot was good, but I wish the trio didn't have to spend all their time in ice instead of showing-off their prowess. Also, it would have been nice to give the Pokmon a little more backstory, like, WHY they have to fight Kyurem and what their origin stories were, kinda, sorta like the games do. Other then that, it's a cool movie.",1376697600,2,405,4.205128205128205
5562743,3,B00B83QHV4,"I am a fan of Pokemon. The movies tend to be ""hit or miss."" In my opinion, this one is a miss. It seems less like a movie and more of an extended TV episode. The major event lacked punch. I didn't feel for the characters. The style of the new Pokemon themselves didn't really appeal to me. I can recommend this for kids who haven't developed real movie standards. Otherwise I'd say buy it cheap. If you don't get this one your DVD collection will not notice the absence.",1374364800,2,470,4.233333333333333
