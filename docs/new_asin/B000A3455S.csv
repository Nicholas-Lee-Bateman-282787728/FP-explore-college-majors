The time given to it is only 23 minutes and is very badly presented. Do yourself a favor and buy the Lost Tapes it is much cheaper and deals in fact, this film does not.",1311206400,,315,4.096774193548387
8073830,5,B000A3455S,"Where to start on this perfect gem?  Seldom have I had the pleasure to watch something so thoroughly unintentionally hilarious.  Actually, to be fair, I kinda got the sense that the crew also knew it was going to be on the funny side.  See the team striding out in urban camo!  Watch motion sensors placed in a cow pasture *full of cows* to monitor for chupacabras!  See a night spent in the single all-out most haunted castle in all of Europe without even one single paranormal event!  On one occasion the crack team sets up a high-tech Ouija board with the sensor stationed over ""yes"" and grows despondent when their barrage of yes-no questions gets no response.  Hey!  Maybe the evil spirit was just trying to say ""yes""!  Repeatedly!  Anyway, after watching a Netflix copy of this little beauty, I purchased one from Amazon at not inconsequential personal expense to send to my brother.  That's high praise for me.",1304380800,,917,4.70440251572327
8073831,5,B000A3455S,I really enjoyed this film. The story of the Chupacabra of South America has become well known in the last decade but I never knew the facts about this story until I found this DVD. To my knowledge this is the only DVD on the topic. This DVD also includes great ghost hunter research and real ghost aberrations caught on film coming out of grave sites. They also visit Hermitage Castle in the South of Scotland for some great paranormal research that had me riveted.,1259193600,,466,4.4941176470588236
