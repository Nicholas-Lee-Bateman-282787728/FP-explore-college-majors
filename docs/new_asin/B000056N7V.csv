bOULEVARD IT DISPLAYS ALL T HE greatness of Swanson as a Silent Screen diva.  Her bodily gestures the way she snakes around the screen help us to appreciate all the more the great comeback she made in 1950.  Her work tells us what fine qualities are needed by the actress in silent work.  We can understand why the moguls couln't quite understand why sound took over as quickly as it did. Highly recommended.

1398553,5,B000056N7V,"This DVD is a special treat for serious enthusiasts of classic films because despite its missing end scenes, Kino Video has resurrected this silent film with a reconstructed ending and many bonus features which give ample in-depth and background information about Sadie Thompson.  Based on a real-life person, the story of a prostitute clashing with a religious reformer or minister first appeared as a novella by W. Somerset Maugham, then a Broadway stage play before screen legend Gloria Swanson decided to tackle the challenge of playing the controversial character.  Her second venture as a producer for United Artists, Swanson chose a highly talented crew to complement her own outstanding performance, which resulted in an energy-charged, entertaining and well-balanced drama with touches of playfulness and subtle humour.  Lionel Barrymore is frighteningly convincing in the role of the overly zealous and pragmatic  reformer, who was originally a religious minister in the story and play, but due to censorship rules in the 1920s, any reference to a minister or church had to be removed.  Gloria Swanson also excels in this role which allowed her more acting expression and depth than her `fashion clothes horse' roles she had become so famous for in the early 1920s.  Her mannerisms and even her walk convey the essence of the Sadie Thompson character as she fools around with some US Marines, then challenged by the strict, conservative and judgmental reformer and his wife.  When she finally gives in to pressure to atone for her sins, the transformation to a plain and sullen woman is also quite striking.  Just as the electrifying tension between Sadie and the reformer culminates, the moving film ends and is replaced by stills which reveal the final twist of the story.  This is somewhat of a disappointment, but considering that ""Sadie Thompson"" was believed lost for several decades, most viewers will surely be happy just to see this important film in its present state:  almost complete with only a few segments of poor picture quality due to deterioration.  An exceptionally good orchestral score more than makes up for the few blurry scenes, and enhances the various moods and intensity of the drama throughout.  The bonus features give background information about the film, the original story, as well as comparisons between the written story, play and films, including a sound re-make only a few years later with Joan Crawford entitled ""Rain"".  With hardly any action and most scenes shot inside the hotel in the tropical downpour, ""Sadie Thompson"" is more of an intellectual film which challenges two extremes of thought and life-style, and when or whether a compromise can be found.  The classic story and its author aside, this film is also of interest due to the cast and crew, with Raoul Walsh both acting and directing, and art direction by the renowned William Cameron Menzies whose efforts to re-create the South Pacific inn also add to the overall high quality of this production.",1197590400,,3013,5.122448979591836
1398554,5,B000056N7V,"During his lifetime Somerset Maugham (1874-1965) was best known for such novels as OF HUMAN BONDAGE and such plays as THE CIRCLE; today, however, he is chiefly recalled for his short stories, of which the 1921 ""Miss Thompson"" is easily the most famous.  The original story was soon adapted for the stage under the title RAIN--and it was a tremendous success.  The play has been performed countless times and continues to be revived on a consistent basis; there have also been three major screen adaptations.

The best of these is the 1928 silent film SADIE THOMPSON starring Gloria Swanson (1897-1983.)  Swanson was perhaps the first Hollywood ""Diva,"" an actress as controversial as she was popular.  By the late 1920s her liaison with the infamous Joe Kennedy (father of John, Robert, and Ted) gave her the clout to become her own producer, and with Kennedy money behind her she selected the Maugham story and cast herself in the title role.

It was an inspired choice.  Swanson had somewhat hard features and tremendous attitude, and many consider that this is her best overall performance.  The story concerns the collision of a brash prostitute (Swanson) and a holier-than-thou minister (Lionel Barrymore) who find themselves trapped by quarantine and monsoon rains in a rundown hotel on Pago-Pago.  Needless to say, the sparks fly--especially when Davidson pressures the island govenor to deport Sadie as soon as possible.  But it gradually transpires that Davidson may have more than one reason for wanting Sadie gone: it may be that he finds her a temptation himself.

SADIE THOMPSON would be Swanson's last great success in the silent era--the later QUEEN KELLY was never finished or widely released.  But like most other silent films, it was buried by the advent of sound, and over the years the final ten or fifteen minutes of the film was completely lost.  Without a conclusion, it was rarely shown even after interest in silent films revived.  Fortunately, Kino has been able to restore the conclusion with a mixture of film fragments, stills, and title card recreations, and the brazen Sadie, the dour Dr. Davidson, and the statement made about intolerance, tempation, and hypocrisy live and breathe once more.

The picture quality shows age, but on the whole it is quite good and probably the best available short of digital restoration.  The bonuses are slight but interesting, including comparisons of key scenes from the original story, the playscript, the 1928 Swanson version, and the 1932 Joan Crawford version, which was titled RAIN.  (Comparison with the 1953 Rita Hayworth version, titled MISS SADIE THOMPSON, is not made; this version, however, is negligable.)  KINO Video has done a tremendous job of restoring, preserving, and once more making this memorable film available.  If you're a fan of Maugham, Swanson, or silent film in general, SADIE THOMPSON is a must-have.

1398555,5,B000056N7V,"""Sadie Thompson"" is a brillant film that reflects one of gloria swanson's finest moments.  Gloria Swanson portrays a woman of easy virtue, and for that time period, it was a very controversial film.  Gloria Swanson's superb acting and clean viewing, for that type of story line, makes this movie a time piece of excellence.  There is some strong language seen through her lip movements, but only if you look very closely.  Overall it comes across very strongly and passionately. For the drama within you, you can see the story by the bodily movements which makes this type of film a masterpiece.  Inspite of the distorted damage to the film from throughout the years, Sadie Thompson was restored enough to please the eye and the added orchestra sound makes this film a pleasure to have.  I strongly recommend this film.",1027209600,,819,4.856115107913669
1398556,5,B000056N7V,"Here is the film that the Catholic church tried to stop - and which was financed by Joseph Kennedy for his then mistress Gloria Swanson. This is a very well made, well acted drama about a prostitute, a cleric, and an army sargent (played by the director Raul Walsh). Not to be missed. AN excellent rpint, also, without any scratches.",989193600,,333,4.566666666666666
1398557,5,B000056N7V,"Much like the ""restored"" version of Swanson's Queen Kelly this release is a mixed blessing. On the one hand it is breath-taking to see the beauty and range Gloria Swanson had - yet, as the last reel of the film is missing it's tragic that the dramatic climax of the film is lost.
That said, the restoration as excellent - the reconstruction of the climax works well, and beyond that Kino have also added the last reel of the 1932 remake RAIN and the shooting script.
This, along with essays and stills, as well as other clips and excerpts makes this a must have DVD for any serious silent film lover.
Sad that Swanson's talent in silent films has been somewhat eclipsed by her  - admittedly great - performance as the tragic diva in Sunset Boulevard. This is a rare and welcome chance to see a magnificent star at the height of her powers.",984182400,,839,4.4480519480519485

7932320,3,B000056N7V,"Sadie Thompson is a 1928 silent film based on the 1921 Somerset Maugham short story Rain and the 1923 play of the same name. Its about a prostitute who tries to change her life.

Gloria Swanson (1899  1983) plays Sadie. She was one of the biggest stars of the silent era and was nominated for the first Oscar for her role in this film, a film she also produced. She worked often with Cecil B. DeMille and was one of the first to join United Artists. To modern audiences shes best known as Norma Desmond from Sunset Blvd (1950).

The great Lionel Barrymore (1878-1954) plays a religious fanatic who becomes enamored with Swanson.  Lionel appeared in more than 200 films
between 1908 and 1956, and was twice nominated for an Oscar, winning once (A Free Soul ) in 1931 Though hes probably best known as the evil banker in Its a Wonderful Life (1946) and from his recurring roles in the Dr. Kildare and the Dr. Gillepsie films, he gave us many memorable performances -  as the innkeeper in Key Largo (1948), Thaddeus Stevens in Tennessee Johnson (1942), Grandpa in You Cant Take it With You (1938), and Billy Bones in Treasure Island (1934). He is merely OK in this one.

Though hes probably best known as a director, especially for his films with Errol Flynn, Raoul Walsh (1887-1980) was a busy actor in the silent era (e.g., he played John Wilkes Booth in 1915s Birth of a Nation, one of 40 roles he took on). Here he plays a sailor who falls in love with Sadie. He volunteered for WW 1 and his role in Sadie Thompson was his first return to the screen as an actor since 1915. A year later he lost his eye in an auto accident, so in this film we see Walsh sans eye patch. Thankfully his passion for directing returned and he gave us such memorable films as Roaring Twenties (1939), Dark Command (1940), High Sierra (1941) and White Heat (1949) and ""They Died with Their Boots On"" (1941).

As silent film, there isn't that much to recommend it. The performances are adequate, and if you like Gloria Swanson, you won't be disappointed, but the setting is so poorly done it distracts from the film. It is very clever how they restored the ending.",1453852800,,2141,4.460358056265985
7932321,3,B000056N7V,"Gloria Swanson (Sadie Thompson) plays a San Francisco hooker who travels to the South Seas to escape her past.  Unfortunately she catches the eye of an Evangalist Reformer, played by Lionel Barrymore, who when he isn't teaching the happy-go-lucky natives what sinners they are, manages to worm his way into Sadies' soul-making her believe her Road to Redemption lies in returning to San Francisco and prison.  Of the many service men who flock around Sadie, one emerges to win her heart. He'd like to marry Sadie and settle down in Australia where they happily will live out their lives.  What follows is Sadies' struggle between her heart and her soul.

This is an attempt to restore a wonderful silent movie, but some parts were just ruined and the attempts to fix the ending of the movie with stills is somewhat disappointing.  However this is still a good watch.  Gloria Swanson was in her heyday and gorgeous and she was splendid as the good-hearted hooker. It's also great to see Lionel Barrymore as the Reformer who could not save himself.",1438560000,,1046,4.815642458100559

7932326,4,B000056N7V,"Gloria Swanson was the Sadie Thompson I would have envisioned from W. Somerset Maughn's short novel. Like Gloria Swanson said in the movie, Sunset Boulevard, ""We didn't need words, we had faces"" well, she was right. I had never seen a silent film and the story comes through as clearly as if I were listening to the script. I am glad I purchased ""Sadie Thompson"" and now I just might buy the DVD starring Joan Crawford for comparison. Maughn's short novel RAIN describes Sadie differently in appearance and the ending is also different, but I guess Hollywood felt they had to add a romantic character for Sadie to finally fall in love with and make a commentment.
