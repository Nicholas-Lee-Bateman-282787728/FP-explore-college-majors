3048028,4,B00106469O,"If you missed this sleeper, it is well worth the price. From the creators of Love Actually, 4 Weddings and a Funeral and other recent British crowd pleasers, you don't have to be Jewish to love this movie- but it couldn't hurt. Charming true tale finds a cute nerd's bar mitzvah fall on the same day  that the Brits made it to the World Cup Finals for the first time. Don't miss it.",1236988800,6,382,4.232876712328767
3048029,5,B00106469O,"I only learned of this by happenstance whilst on ImBd movie cite. I chose to watch it because the rating seemed right and the synopsis came off quirky. As for actress Helena Bonham Carter, she has been an actress who intrigues me greatly. There is a dark brooding intelligence, whit, and seductive quality to her. She is kind of a hybrid of Barbra Stanwick and Bette Davis. She has the rare quality to make any film better. It was a fun and engaging movie. If you enjoyed Ben Stiller's film, ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"", then you may love this.",1399420800,,550,4.455445544554456
3048030,5,B00106469O,"I enjoyed watching this movie.  What happens prior to making party plans for a barmitzvah was only too real.  For a young boy reaching manhood, he was in turmoil due to knowing his hebrew passages, where he would have his party and who could attend his celebration.",1384300800,,265,4.617021276595745
3048031,5,B00106469O,Love this.  Such an original plot and good acting.  I've recommended it to several friends.  Family friendly for pre-teens up without lowering itself to the lowest denominator.,1371945600,,176,5.444444444444445
3048032,4,B00106469O,This movie was referred to me by a fellow Brit expat.  He said I would enjoy it and I did.  Very much!  It's a giggle!,1369353600,,118,3.64

3048034,5,B00106469O,"Bernie Reuben (Gregg Sulkin) is ignored and picked on. He is ""not very good at breathing."" His father Manny (Eddie Marsan) is not very assertive and is an embarrassment. Bernie recalls the wonderful Bar Mitzvah  his brother had and relishes the day when he has his celebration, a day that will belong to him. As that day approaches, his family undergoes various hardships, downsizing his celebration. To make matters worse, his barmitzvah is scheduled the same day as the World Cup Final, July 30, 1966. Bernie realizes as his native England is in the tournament, they need to lose for him to have a large turnout.

The film is a comedy-drama. Some of the jokes are quick visuals such as a card that reads ""Kimmel Kosher Katering."" The soundtrack include tunes from the era.

No f-bombs, brief implied sex, male rear nudity.",1336867200,2,824,4.788732394366197
3048035,5,B00106469O,"A charming, funny and heartwarming story about a working class Jewish family in 1966 England. Bernie Rubens (Gregg Sulkin) looks forward to his bar mitzvah being a big success remembering how he was upstaged by the bar mitzvah of his older brother. but potential financial ruin, a house fire and the injury of his uncle preoccupy Bernies parents played by Helena Bonham Carter, who carries off the role as Bernies mother with quirky charm (her usual splendid self) and Eddie Marsan.
Most significantly Bernies' bar mitzvah coincides with the day of the world cup final and Bernie knows if England makes it to the final his Bar mitzvah will be ruined. sure enough England does make it and relatives and friends call in one after the other feigning all sorts of excuses, and it look really bleak for Bernie, but it will end in an upbeat note which I won't reveal so as not to spoil the ending.
Quirky, humorous, avoids stereotypes, shows how Jews can be ordinary working class people in Britain, to the film's credit and also will appeal to people of any background as well as Jewish people. Based on the actual coinciding of the director's Bar Mitzvah with England's stunning 1966 world cup victory, and a highly recommended coming of age comedy.",1301788800,5,1245,4.768518518518518

I found it at Amazon in a non-USA format, but since I have a format free DVD player, I purchased a copy, previously destined for Australia.

It's a cute premise. A Jewish boy in Britain is told the date of his bar mitzvah is June 6, 1966. It turns out that the English national soccer team is slated to play for the World Cup on that date.

The English connection on top of it adds to this period piece drama of growing up in London in the 1960's and being part of a minority group and the customs and traditions surrounding it, woven into the fabric of England's finest sporting hour to date, winning the Jules Rimet Trophy for the 1966 World Cup Final vs West Germany!",1465430400,,415,4.333333333333333

8237196,4,B00106469O,"Wonderful and dreamy trip in time with many nice little observations about a transitional time for England during one of its shining moments.  The awkwardness around Jewish assimilation, a mere 20 years or so after the end of the war is at the center of the film, along with the subtext of latent desires and thwarted ambition that challenge ordinary families.  Neat and funny, and only shortchanged a bit with a somewhat rushed and slightly contrived ending.",1402358400,,459,4.9480519480519485
