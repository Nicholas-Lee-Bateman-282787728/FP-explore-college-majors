8608961,5,B00ESL4RYM,"This is set 2 in, as of this writing, a 6 volume set of mastering statistics volumes Jason has put out, with possibly more to come down the line.  It is still covering basic material, and expanding on the core concepts that were introduced in the first volume, and there is still some overlap with the older set Jason put out years ago,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Probability-and-Statistics-Tutor-10-Hour-Course-3-DVD-Set-Learn-By-Examples/dp/B0016G8HX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Probability and Statistics Tutor - 10 Hour Course - 3 DVD Set - Learn By Examples!</a>.

He starts out discussing discrete and continuous probability distribution, then basically spends the rest of the sections on Normal Probability Distribution (bell curves), finding the area under the bell curves using z-values and the tables in the back of most books.  It should be noted that while he does mention that finding the area can be done with calculus and doing integration, he left that out and just focused on using the tables in the book, how to interpret the information in the problems and look them up in the table.  If you are taking a statistics class in the math curriculum that may be okay, but if you are taking something like an engineering data analysis class you will probably have to do the integration.  But the integrals will end up being relatively basic and easily done with a graphing calculator so it should not cause most people in that situation a lot of problems.

If you have ever seen Jason's material, either because you own another set, or because you have seen sample videos on his site or on Youtube, it follows much the same format as his more recent DVDs.  He introduces as concept in one or two lecture sections, then he does problems.  Sometimes he does a couple problems in one chapter of the DVD, and sometimes just one.  So overall the chapters are shorter, but he still packs a lot of information into the entire disc set.  This is still the material that you will see early on in any statistics course, and would probably not cover all the material that you would get in a first exam.  It probably translates to the material in the first 2 to 3 weeks of a course.  Luckily the later volumes cover material like confidence intervals and hypothesis testing which make up the bulk of what any of the courses will cover.

I personally find that Jason's teaching style meshes with my learning style a lot.  He explains things in a way that I find very easy to follow and I have used his DVD sets from algebra through advanced calculus and engineering.  While none of his sets cover everything you will need to learn in the classes, and not even all the material you will likely be tested on, he goes through the big, main concepts that you have to know in order to be able to handle any other material.  So while this is not a substitute for going to class or reading the book and doing homework, it will help you understand the material much more, so what is in the book is not so hard to follow, and if you have a teacher that is not so great, can make up for what you may not understand from him or her.  They have been a great tool for me, and I cannot recommend them more if you are a visual and/or auditory learner.",1465603200,,3292,4.7373029772329245

8608963,5,B00ESL4RYM,Jason is amazing and explains every concept. Worth every penny.,1446508800,,63,5.4

8608965,3,B00ESL4RYM,Very basic and limited in scope for the price.  Greater life applications would have been more helpful.,1411776000,2,103,5.0588235294117645
8608966,4,B00ESL4RYM,"I love Jason Gibson's DVD series on Statistics.  I even purchased a month long membership to his ""online"" service, in search of Hypothesis testing.  Which, if you are in a basic College Statistics Course, the last 1/3 of the course is ""hypothesis testing"". The summation of the entire college course is for research. Most degrees require stats specifically for hypothesis testing(ie. Criminal Justice, Psychology, ). Great for the first 2 months of college stats.",1398988800,4,463,5.243243243243243
