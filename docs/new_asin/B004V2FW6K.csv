A sensitive and poetic film of this class sank at the box office, leading to the death of its producer Shailendra due to financial crisis. This film is today recognized as one of the best movie by all critics and actors. Film is based on a story of the Phanishwer Nath Renu, one of renowned Hindi writers.

This film portrays story of Hiraman, a bullock cart driver and a dancer Hirabai. Hirabai is attracted to Hiraman due to his simplicity. She is going to a fair by Hiraman's bullock cart to perform in drama. The bond between two grows stronger as the day passes at fair. But finally as the fair comes closer to end, the parting seems imminent due to external factors. Finally when fair is over, Hirabai has to go and two separates.

To quote Star and Style's review of the film, ""The way the cart driver and nautanki dancer meet, talk and discover each other and themselves at the same time and the manner in which they part are like a poem on celluloid with a thread of pain running through it."" Raj Kapoor and Vaheeda Rehamn has given the best performances of their career. Songs are worth listening for hours. A must watch.",1306281600,2,1194,4.422727272727273
