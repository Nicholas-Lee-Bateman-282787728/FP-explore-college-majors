5311861,2,B009AYNOYQ,"I agree with the previous review.  I'm a diehard fan, but to sell the season this way (in 2 parts) is unfair to loyal viewers.  So, why did I purchase it?  I'm asking myself that too ... all I can really say is I want the complete season; that's how much I like the show.  But, the is a poor way to get more money.  If you're going to sell ""the season"", then do just that!",1350950400,25,372,3.8421052631578947
5311862,1,B009AYNOYQ,"Prior seasons sold for $22-$26 for the entire season. Someone comes up with the bright idea to sell it in two parts so they can charge double the price.. I fell for the sale in May believing that we would get the entire season. Fool me once - shame on you... fool me twice, SHAME on me.",1350086400,20,286,4.035087719298246

5311867,3,B009AYNOYQ,It was a little hard watching this long season knowing that so many of the cast were departing at the end. The chemistry among the actors was first-rate and their moving portrayals were what made it a great drama. Season 6 is all about transitioning out the core cast and gradually introducing new actors and it simply doesn't work because you end up missing the original cast too much.,1475452800,,386,4.608695652173913

5311969,1,B009AYNOYQ,The series was broken into 1st half and 2nd half.  With only 10 episodes this is not worth it. Probably will not buy season 7.,1358899200,,126,4.04
5311970,4,B009AYNOYQ,"The second part was good.  Sad ot see some of the main characters leaving.

5311975,5,B009AYNOYQ,"i love the series,l hope they continue the series.  it is one of my favorites. i wonder if there will be a seven season....",1357257600,,123,4.125
5311976,5,B009AYNOYQ,"I gave this 5 stars even though I was unhappy with this season being sold in two parts.  That's just wrong.  However, this is one of the best military-life stories EVER. At first, the only flaw I could see was that the wives of enlisted personnel were such close friends with the wives of officers - which as anyone who ever served knows, that's not the way life is in the military.  But the more I watched, I realized that this is the way it SHOULD be.  The series was cast perfectly, and I was impressed that the problems the characters faced were so similar to those of actual military families.  My granddaughter introduced me to this series when her husband was in Iraq.  She and another Marine wife both watched while their husbands were deployed, and they repeatedly told me to buy this entire series.  I'm so glad I listened.",1356825600,12,833,4.47682119205298
5311977,5,B009AYNOYQ,This was a gift for my sister.  She's already watched all of the episodes in this 2nd part of the season.  She was very upset at the ending...and has guessed that there will be another season.  What a cliff-hanger...,1356739200,,216,4.487179487179487
5311978,5,B009AYNOYQ,Great tv series. Worth owning. Ordered this plus part one because my wife was deployed for a year & wanted to see it when she returned home. She loves the series as well.,1356652800,6,170,4.181818181818182
5311979,5,B009AYNOYQ,I just love army wives however I do feel that both part 0ne and part two should have been together as one not two separate DVD's,1356480000,,128,3.9615384615384617
5311980,5,B009AYNOYQ,"Have all seasons on dvd so far....cant wait for next season to start and new dvd for last season....price is reasonable and cheaper than in stores and ordered ahead of release in stores.  Got mine before they run out each yr and store only gets a few copies in each one.  I would be upset if I couldn't get each season and not have the whole set just in case people died on show, show cancelled I can watch the old ones now again.  One of the HOTTEST SHOWS EACH SEASON AND PEOPLE ARE JUST WAITING FOR JUNE TO COME TO GET BACK IN TO THE NEXT SEASON!!!!!",1354492800,3,552,4.092592592592593
5311981,1,B009AYNOYQ,I've bought all the Army Wives DvD's and season 6 part one is a total repeat of season 5. What a rip off this is. I expected a new complete season not a review of season 5. I will not order what they are calling season six part 2 - they can have it.,1354233600,3,249,3.6296296296296298
