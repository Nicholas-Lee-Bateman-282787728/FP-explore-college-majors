This live club appearance in California features his band with no less than Richie Cole on alto and Randy Brecker on trumpet.  The group is on fire, with great solos by the three front liners, as well as pianist Ron Feuer and bassist Kevin Axt.  Santo Savino is the drummer, and Carlos Vasquez is on percussion.  The tasty assortment of tunes includes Oliver Nelson's ""Patterns,"" Trane's ""A Love Supreme"" Victor Feldman's ""Joshua,"" Golson's ""Along Came Betty,"" Strayhorn's ""Lush Life,"" Shearing's ""Conception,"" Miles' ""All Blues,"" and Cedar Walton's ""Mosaic.""  There's at least 90 minutes of music here (tune lengths are not provided), and while the video quality is not exceptional, the audio is excellent.  Great music!",1356566400,,793,5.304
