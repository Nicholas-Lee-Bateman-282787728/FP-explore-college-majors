8468222,5,B005EHDCAY,"Volume 2 is less boring to adults than Volume 1.

I'd recommend this most strongly for two and three year olds.  Older children (or even adults) might watch it a few times, but a two year old might be happy to see some or all of these episodes every day. What's ""boring"" to adults is just about right to toddlers.

This builds a bit on the basic words in Volume 1, but I don't think that you really need to see Volume 1.  The first DVD in this set (Disc 4) is about objects and rooms in the house.  Disc 5 is about emotions.  If your child is easily upset by seeing a sad child, then parts of this one may not be popular.  Disc 6 is about counting.  If you're worried that this is ""too baby"" for your older one, then start with this.

There's no real story or drama to keep your attention.  Each stand-alone five-minute episode has a brief animated introduction, in which the panda bear, elephant, and bobcat play.  That introduces the concept, and then there are videos of children doing something, while the panda describes the situation by saying something like, ""Sie teilen"" (they share).

Non-German speaking parents can turn on the English subtitles to see the translations on screen.  This will help you figure out things like whether that cute baby is ""smiling"" or ""laughing"".

I don't think that just watching this is going to get kids speaking German.  However, it might be a reasonable supplement to classes or other opportunities for younger children.

If it were up to me, though, they'd be selling each five-minute episode on iTunes and Amazon the same way that you can buy one song off an albumand get it on your iPad or smartphone instead of just on the DVD player.",1414022400,2,1681,4.4983498349834985

found a few mistakes, too!",1402617600,,276,3.7586206896551726
