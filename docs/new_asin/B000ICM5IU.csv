8145113,5,B000ICM5IU,"This is an outstanding triple feature! I bought it because I wanted Shallow Hal, but then I realized that ""Something About Mary"" is another classic w/ ben stiller and cameron diaz. The first movie, ""The Girl Next Door"" released in 2004 is a serious blockbuster. the main kid, emile hirsh, and the girl next door character deliver a convincing take on the high school scene. The typical cool-kid hardcore seniors are not portrayed as jerks or something that the main character hates or needs to overcome. They are portrayed as assets to emile's project. Emile's character is so dynamic as he traverses from seeming like a nerd, a funny kid, a super-smart bookworm, to a badass, to a regular teenager, to a porn star and ultimately- to himself, a combination of everyone who has influenced him in this finale of his high school experience. In Shallow Hal, jack black's character is ridden of any inhibitions to get women by a mysterious curse that lets a girl's inner beauty shine through her exterior, making all women look hot on the outside to his deceived eyes. The plot makes for an entertaining story as his social circle just can't understand how he falls for a watermelon-sized gywneth paltrow. Watching it makes you wonder about the seperation between inner and outer beauty. Is there seperation at all? If she's so pleasant to be around, how ugly can her face be? And if her body seems so hot, how disgusting can her inside personality be? It really raises some questions about what true attractiveness is.",1347580800,,1514,4.804597701149425
8145114,5,B000ICM5IU,"Out of the Dreamgirl 3 Pack, ""Shallow Hal"" is the only one worth review for me.  ""The Girl Next Door"" was tasteless; I shredded it.  Something about Mary was so/so but not worth keeping.

""Shallow Hal"" starts a little slow, but the premise is so interesting, that of seeing someone's heart rather than their exterior, is done in such a hilarious way that I purchased this movie from Amazon after seeing it on TV.

I want to share it with my friends and watch it several times.  It is a sensitive topic done with so much humor that I ended up just loving this movie.

Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1315612800,,602,4.2368421052631575
8145115,4,B000ICM5IU,"First of all, I can't say enough about the classic There's Something About Mary, which is a must have for any movie collection.

Shallow Hal was surprisingly well done, and performs well as a ""feel-good"" movie about a guy who has no respect for women and quickly develops himself into a more caring individual.

The Girl Next Door is probably the best piece of this collection, and well worth the full price itself. Elisha Cuthbert is stunning, as usual, and the supporting cast is very funny, especially given the premise of this movie. Timothy Olyphant also gives this film a nice edge as the pimp that doesn't take any trash from anybody.",1219104000,,641,4.714285714285714
