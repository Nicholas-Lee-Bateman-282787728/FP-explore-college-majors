8344626,5,B0012K3K4A,don't let the dorky beginning fool you... brilliant acting by the lead actress ... well worth a watch just to see what she'll do next ...,1524528000,,137,4.3076923076923075
8344627,5,B0012K3K4A,Compelling and surprisingly good for an indie venture. Excellent lead actress. Well worth a view!!!,1524182400,,99,5.666666666666667
8344628,1,B0012K3K4A,"Not feeling it. Poorly shot, terrible acting and a bad soundtrack. The lead just goes on and on justifying the hows and the whys of her desire to kill people. 35 minutes into it and I'm yawning wondering why am I torturing myself. Pass on this one.",1522195200,,248,4.297872340425532

8344633,5,B0012K3K4A,"4th Floor Pictures continues to push indie horror to it's boundaries with the long awaited release of it's newest flick, Aspiring Psychopath. Was it worth the wait? Hell yeah! For an independent film, there are plot twists and enough suspense to keep the viewer entertained. Big budget horror nowadays spends too much time remaking classic films or putting way too much emphasis on how much gore and violence they put in a film and not enough on a good story. This film is a psychological thriller about Lucinda, a young woman who strives to become to best serial killer she can be. She belives she is doing the right thing buy her murderous actions. You can feel the torment of her character and her struggle with herself. It's a great film, trust me! Check it out!",1206057600,,766,4.639705882352941
8344634,5,B0012K3K4A,"""Aspiring Psychopath"" was a pleasant surprise. It has elements of so-called ""torture porn,"" but labeling it that would be an insult. Though Lucinda is pure evil, she's convinced what she is doing is the way it has to be. In her eyes, she not only gains something positive from the film's body count, but her victims do as well. Her thinking is horribly askew, but we can relate to her because she isn't just some mean-spirited movie villain that gets off to hurting others.",1200787200,3,473,4.642857142857143
