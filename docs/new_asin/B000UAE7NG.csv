2918443,4,B000UAE7NG,"A documentary about the genesis, success, press, and fallout of four Broadway musicals would have to be quickly paced. Besides that, the well-rounded content of Dori Berenstein's 'Show Business-The Road to Broadway' is whole and complete--entertaining, fun, informative, eventful, and fascinating.  If you love musicals, this is a must-see.  If you're only luke warm, you'll probably love it anyway just to trace the creative sparks back to their origins.

Well, it's just so exciting!  Especially if you don't know the outcomes (like me).  Watching four selected Broadway musicals from 2004, we witness each one get created from the piano to the stage.  Only a hair less satisfying are the steps of creation for the choreography, rehearsals, and press conferences.  It's all in the details.  Some of the participants strive for the American dream from the bottom:  One got off of welfare; another was working as a temp.  Then, as the show takes a life of it's own, we make our bets (like on our favorite horse race) and see which one wins (financially and/or critically).  Sort of an entertainment version of 'The Apprentice' without The Donald, Adam Zucker's editing never leaves us yawning in the aisles. The film is effective enough as it reaches its climax at The Tony Awards.

How can you not love a movie that gives you a real look at 'Wicked,' 'Avenue Q,' 'Caroline or Change,' and 'Taboo'?  The film features substantative sound bites from a myriad of producers, actors, writers, and artists.  As an overview, I loved the round-table discussions by critics at a New York restaurant.  Or how about the feistiness and passion of Boy George and Rosie O'Donnell?  Then, we're left in suspense as we see which show is left standing and for how long.

Noting that some musicals make millions in a few weeks and others fold the same night, 'Show Business...' gives us ""the big idea"" and runs off with it.  Off the stage, that is, where all the players sip champagne--and celebrate their triumphs or drown out their sorrows.  Vibrant like Broadway itself, it is quite a show!

(Especially featuring--besides the aforementioned--Tony award-winning Actor, Alan Cumming and 'The New Yorker' Chief Critic, John Lahr.)",1193184000,16,2214,5.03021978021978
2918444,4,B000UAE7NG,"As this film's ending makes perfectly clear, Broadway is brutal: far more shows fail than succeed.  Show Business followed four musicals (Wicked, Taboo, Avenue Q, and Caroline, Or Change) through pre-production to (some would say premature) closing, unveiling the huge amount of work expended to put these productions on the stage.  Not only is it a valentine to the musical, but to the art form's fans.  A must-see for anyone who loves Broadway.",1187740800,4,446,5.082191780821918
2918445,4,B000UAE7NG,"I am giving this documentary 4 stars because of the  backstage access and how well the film is done.  However, after hearing about the film and seeing interviews regarding the film where the makers talk about stumbling into this interesting season, it does not feel complete.  The one major thing missing from this movie, and I think it was intentional, was the big campaign by Avenue Q for the Tony.  We do not see the theater all bedecked in the streamers that they hung, and the acceptance speech at the Tonys where voting your heart was mentioned is nowhere to be found. For those in the theatre community and for  those who follow the theatre closely, we all know about the big push Avenu Q made to win the Tony. It is interesting  that they covered the problems Tonya Pinkins was having in her personal life and touching on the controversy surrounding Taboo and Rosie O'donnell, but not a word about how ""aggressive"" Avenue Q was at Tony time.  This makes this documentary just average.  it is  great to be taken through the rehearsal process of these 4 shows and getting a peek at backstage life.  And the inclusion of the chats between theatre critics was also good.  But with the exclusion of the Avenue Q ""mini controversy"", this documentary could have been filmed during any season.  I was so looking forward to seeing this after hearing good things about it.  Will I buy the DVD? Yes.  And why?  because any peek behind the  scenes of the theatre is worth buying to me.  Just wish this one was better.",1187395200,4,1513,4.565055762081784
2918446,4,B000UAE7NG,"The odds against a Broadway musical becoming a profitable hit make Hollywood studio film deals seem like a sure thing by comparison. However, there is a more palpable energy to live theater and arguably a genuine sense of risk. Filmmaker Dori Berinstein has captured this high-wire dynamic in spades with this enthusiastic 2007 documentary, which covers the 2003-04 Broadway season culminating in the Tony Awards held in June. There are plenty of random shots from the season's shows and even coverage of a little-known rehearsal ritual of having the most prolific cast member wear a gypsy robe before opening. Berinstein's focus is primarily on four disparate musicals - the successful $14-million&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wizard-of-Oz/dp/B000ADS63K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wizard of Oz</a>-inspired extravaganza,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicked/dp/B0000TB01Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicked</a>; a socially conscious period piece, the powerful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Caroline-or-Change/dp/B00028HOG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Caroline, or Change</a>; the glam-rock Boy George autobiography, the financially stunted&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taboo/dp/B00028HBSY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taboo</a>; and the season's underdog, the adult-oriented comic paean to Sesame Street,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avenue-Q/dp/B0000BZK1R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avenue Q</a>.

Bouncing between the productions in various stages of development, the filmmaker intersperses brief interviews with the producers, directors, writers and principal actors, as well as scabrous roundtable conversations about the spotlighted shows among the influential theater critics who have the power to close a show with a scathing review. The diverse combination of perspectives provides interesting fodder, even though given the wealth of material gathered here, the treatment sometimes feels truncated and cursory, for example, composer Stephen Schwartz and star Idina Menzel are given plenty of attention on ""Wicked"", but not nearly as much is lavished on co-star Kristin Chenoweth or the other creative forces behind the show. Intriguingly, the near-legendary backstage turmoil behind ""Taboo"" is mentioned, but very little of that tension is evident in the rehearsal scenes or the interviews with producer Rosie O'Donnell, Boy George or stars Euan Morton and Ral Esparza.

Even though it is not remotely a warts-and-all type of film, there are refreshingly candid comments from O' Donnell and Boy George about the unfair press coverage ""Taboo"" received from the New York Post's smarmy Michael Riedel. There are also moments that are surprisingly poignant like ""Caroline, or Change"" star Tonya Pinkins recounting her grief-filled back story and Morton near tears as he talks about his post-close struggles. Easily the most amusing scenes spotlight the young, precocious composers of ""Avenue Q"", Jeff Marx and Bobby Perez, who seem to have accidentally backed into their show idea and ironically came out the season's true victors. The interviews with Marx's proud but dumbfounded father are especially hilarious. As a Broadway aficionado, I couldn't help but wish there were more musical moments included beyond the snippets shown, in particular, more of Pinkins' stirring turn in her show or the wildly talented Esparza's cross-dressing turn in ""Taboo"". But otherwise, this all-access peek into the Broadway theater scene is genuinely insightful and wonderfully entertaining.",1185580800,13,3706,6.84957627118644

2918469,3,B000UAE7NG,"I bought this DVD with the intention of showing it to my Theatre 101 class thinking it would be good for them to see how musicals are created.  I wasn't a fan of this DVD though for that purpose.  If you teach a class strictly on writing, producing, workshopping, etc. a show particularly a musical than this may be the DVD for you.  I intend to keep this DVD for future use, because it really is a good DVD for any Theatre Instructor out there that likes to use media for their classes.  So, if you're a Theatre 101 teacher and are wanting something more about History of Musical Theatre I would recommend you purchase ""Broadway the America Musical"" DVD set.  I wish we could give half stars because in reality I would give this 3 1/2.

2918471,5,B000UAE7NG,"""Show Business - The Road to Broadway"" (2007) is a Broadway musical fanatic's dream documentary. The creators selected four musicals in the 2003-2004 season and followed them from rehearsal time right up until the Tonys. The four shows couldn't have more disparate. ""Wicked"", a 14 million dollar investment, is an elaborate spectacular that is still in 2010 packing them in and has kept an adoring audience. ""Avenue Q"" was that little quirky musical that had adult themes and adult puppets. It ran for years on Broadway, and is still playing off-Broadway.
""Caroline or Change"" was always problematic and daring in some ways, but it seemed like an earnest, obligatory show that people ought to see. It was developed at Papp's Shakespeare theater. The fourth show, ""Taboo"" was extremely controversial and probably suffered from some distracting Rosie publicity.
""Taboo"" had music and lyrics by the flamboyant, wildly-costumed Boy George, who was in the show, though Euan Morton played the young Boy George. It ran in London for a year and a half. Rosie O'Donnell saw it there and decided to mount it on Broadway with ten million of her own money. She is a theater buff who probably became too personally involved in the production. She was going through a messy court case that got a great deal of publicity at the time. Nathan Lane, who was in the wildly successful ""Producers"", ad-libbed a snide comment in his show about ""Taboo"". Rosie and Boy George didn't hit it off too well apparently.
The documentary is very cleverly constructed. We move between the various creative groups, some producers, and a circle of 4-5 media theater critics who give us insider insights into the shows. Naturally among the creators and performers there's a lot of nervous energy. We get a lot of scenes of the Time Square area. One person says alchemy and timing have a lot to do with a show's ultimate success. The 2003-2004 season was a disastrous one for the theater, and many shows had short, choppy runs. It was one of the worst and coldest January-February periods.
Alan Cumming, one of this movie's producers, was often interviewed and he's a very savvy theater person. Michael Riedel on the ""Post"" was nasty at the critic dinner roundtables, and he helped do in ""Taboo"". Insiders will spot some of Manhattan's theater hangouts in interviews--like the Polish Tea Room coffee shop in the Edison Hotel. This is a great treasure for musical theater buffs.",1286064000,,2441,4.927184466019417
2918472,5,B000UAE7NG,"This is a pleasantly thorough look at the creation of these four musicals (Avenue Q, Wicked, Taboo, and Caroline, or Change). First of all, what an interesting season where four such different shows would be opening! The rehearsal and show footage is great as are the interviews from widely varying sources (eavesdropping on the group of prominent theater critics, the casts and creative staffs of shows, and writer William Goldman for good measure). A great and realistic look at what goes into making these shows fly, and something a theater fan (and especially any theater writer) would love to watch repeatedly.",1283731200,,615,5.099009900990099

2918474,4,B000UAE7NG,"This is a very entertaining behind-the-scenes look at four Broadway musicals that opened the same season.  If you love Broadway, you'll adore this film.  If you don't there is still a lot of human interaction to engage you.  It doesn't quite attain the magic of a real show but it points you in that direction.",1258848000,,310,4.6
2918475,4,B000UAE7NG,"The competition for Broadway's coveted Tony Award has a unique feature that separates it from, say, the Oscars, Emmys, or any other showbiz award.  In many seasons the number of eligible competitors is SO SMALL that practically every show gets nominated for SOMETHING.  One recent year there were only two shows eligible for the Best Musical award.  Hardly makes for thrilling competition, does it?

Also, the community of major NY theatrical critics is comparatively small too.  There are relatively few critical voices to be heard or read in the mainstream press, and thus those views can carry a disproportionate amount of weight.  Readers of Broadway critics' reviews don't get a very large statistical sampling of views from which to reach an informed opinion.  Want to know if a new book is any good or well-received?  Log onto the Amazon website and you may see 400-500 reviews, a healthy and generous sampling.  Want to know if how movie reviews stack up for a new film in the theaters?  There are hundreds if not thousands of professional reviews available online.  But when it comes to Broadway shows, the voices are relatively few in number.  A personal or professional bias will therefore loom larger with fewer counterpoint opinions weighing in.

This matter is not directly addressed or even hinted at in this DVD, but one can infer that from the informal critics ""roundtable"" discussions that are captured for this presentation.  All of them take place in (no doubt expensive) restaurants courtesy of the critics' respective expense accounts.  One gets the sense from watching these roundtables, which took place at various points before, during, and after that year's Tony competition season, that each critic knows precisely how much influence their reviews have, how ""important"" their opinions are, and that some of them may be predisposed to favoring certain shows or talent.

""Taboo"" might have been an example of that.  ""Taboo"" was a musical co-created by and starring Boy George.  Its London incarnation was well-received and successful, so Boy George's friend Rosie O'Donnell decided to bankroll it for its $10 million transfer to Broadway.  It wasn't a smooth transition.  Preview reactions were mixed, one key cast member nearly left over creative differences, the target audience was anything but mainstream, and the concurrent press coverage of Rosie's legal problems at the time cast a pall over the public and critical perception of the entire undertaking.  Key to the show's demise, according the DVD, was a scathing review by the New York Times theater critic, though some other critics were more enthusiastic and the audience exit polls seemed positive.  One fan confessed to having seen 52 performances of the show, which accounted for about half of the show's run.  ""Taboo"" failed to garner a Best Musical nomination.  Whether that was due to the a key poor review or to other factors is a matter of debate, though Boy George has definite thoughts on the matter.
*** Watch for the scene in the DVD that shows footage of Rosie O'Donnell leaving a US Courthouse.  Take note of the officers in front of her on the steps.  Interesting, to say the least ***

What is also addressed in this DVD is that the Tony Awards are really regarded perhaps more as marketing tools than as legitimate achievement awards.  Not that the achievements themselves aren't often spectacular, but Tony Awards (and to a slightly lesser degree, nominations) are the publicity hook that shows wear as a badge of respectability to sell tickets and hopefully secure a long life on Broadway or on tour.  Whereas a film will usually have ended its initial theatrical run well before the Oscars are awarded, a Broadway show may well rely on a major Tony Award to kick the show's awareness factor and ""must-see"" element into high gear for the general public.

Broadway shows are quite the unique animal. A show really has to prove to be successful and/or popular to a relatively small number of people before it is given a chance to be seen by a larger number of people (courtesy of an extended run, open-ended run, or National Tour).  Usually that initial boost comes courtesy of the Tony Awards it may have won.  In other words, it doesn't necessarily win a Tony because it catches the attention of the mass public -- often it catches the public's attention because it won the Tony.  Winning the Tony is often the beginning of a show's chances for a long(er) run, so there is much more at stake for a show come Tony season.

Thanks to multiplexes, cable, Netflix, DVD releases, and the Internet, practically anyone can see pretty much any movie they want, even the new releases, at their leisure and often without ever leaving the house. The initial success of a Broadway show, however, depends on patrons making the trek to a specific theatre in a specific city (NY) and paying often exorbitant sums for a ticket.  Taking a family of 5 down the street to see a new movie might cost anywhere between thirty and eighty bucks.  Taking a family of 5 to NYC to catch a new Broadway show can run the tab into well over a grand after airfare, hotel, tickets, souvenirs, etc.  MUCH cheaper to wait for the National Tour to come to your town.  How likely is that to happen?  Not very likely unless a very select and very small set of critics and theatergoers determine many months or years in advance of that National Tour that the show deserves to have legs.

Big-budget Broadway shows require a significant financial investment just to get staged in the first place.  Often, the bigger the spectacle the bigger the anticipated payoff (think Andrew Lloyd Webber).  As is made clear in this DVD, ""Wicked"" was thought to be the prohibitive favorite for a slew of Tony Awards, including the only one that really counts -- Best Musical.  It had all the necessary ingredients: the renowned composer/lyricist, a huge budget, plenty of spiffy costumes and effects, a marquis theatre in which to premiere, and it was based around much-beloved and universally-recognized source material.  In the minds of the critics it was a foregone conclusion that it would grab the Best Musical Tony.  Only it didn't.  In fact, it missed out on several of the major awards that were thought to be a ""lock"".  ""Wicked"" had an out-of-town preview and was significantly re-tooled before opening on Broadway in 2004.  It lost the major awards to ""Avenue Q"", the Little Show That Could.

I'm getting way off target again.  This DVD spotlights the ""business"" of Broadway show business.  Worth watching, for sure.  We get to see a lot of what goes on into creating, rehearsing, staging, and performing a Broadway show.",1248307200,,6683,4.884649511978704

2918488,4,B000UAE7NG,"""Show Business"" provides us with a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the making of four original musicals that debuted on Broadway during the 2004 season:  ""Wicked,"" an inside-out re-interpretation of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" told from the viewpoint of the Wicked Witch of the West; ""Taboo,"" a Rosie O'Donnell-backed chronicle of the life of Boy George; ""Avenue Q,"" a parody of ""Sesame Street,"" done with live actors and puppets; and ""Caroline, or Change,"" a civil rights drama set in the Deep South of the 1960s.

The movie follows all four shows through their various stages of rehearsal, their opening (and sometimes closing) nights, their reception by audiences and critics, and their recognition (or lack thereof) by the Tony Awards.  To bring this self-contained and exclusive world to life, director Dori Berinstein interviews a healthy dose of Broadway insiders and hangers-on, including producers, performers, writers, composers, fans and reviewers.  The movie captures all the joy and heartbreak, along with all the pressures - both artistic and financial - that go into the creation of a Broadway show (there`s a reason, after all, why they call it ""show BUSINESS""!).

This doesn't quite qualify as a must-see documentary, but fans of musical theater - and of these shows in particular - should relish all the juicy backstage info they'll find here.",1222300800,,1352,5.2407407407407405

2918490,5,B000UAE7NG,"This documentary which chronicles the life and history of four musicals that premiered in the 2004 theater season is amazing.  It is highly entertaining but also highly informative.  I love the theater and live in Boston.  It made me yearn to live in New York where Broadway and the true heart of the theater is.  It takes on a life of its own.

4 musicals are chronicled from creation to the Tony Awards - WICKED, AVENUE Q, TABOO AND CAROLINE, OR CHANGE.  We get to go deep into the lives and thoughts of all involved - writers, songwriters, actors etc.  The previews and Broadway premiers are shown and the great importance that lies with each step is shown.  Very interesting is the conversations of some of the most influential critics as they discuss all the shows throughout all the processes.  Interesting to see how their opinions varied so strongly.

Bottom line, if you love musical theater you will adore this educational piece of work.  Even if you don't it is so well made that you will enjoy it immensely and learn a great deal.

The ending showing how different actors etc. moved on with their lives is very emotional.  You truly see how for all the people involved musical theater is not a job but their life.  They MUST do it.  I also saw that all my thoughts on the Boy George musical TABBOO were incorrect and I wish it had been given its just due.  I would have loved to have seen it.  Each season to fill in the blanks, old musicals are reissued with a new look.  This was original and obviously crashed not because the show wasn't good but for other reasons that are just a shame.  I will let you discover them upon viewing this piece.

2918530,5,B000UAE7NG,"If you love Broadway, or better yet, love the four shows featured in this documentary, you will absolutely love this DVD!
An in depth look at how Wicked, Caroline or Change, Taboo, and Avenue Q make their ways from the imagination of the creators to the Tony Awards.
The documentary gives you an excellent idea of what it takes to grow a thick skin, brave the critics and forge ahead with an idea and dream.

Excellently done and includes loads of footage otherwise never seen!  A must have for the Broadway lover in you!",1199232000,,521,4.531914893617022
2918531,5,B000UAE7NG,"Very informative, entertaining and enlightening film.  Explores 4 shows fromtheri inception to production.  Insightful.  The extras are fun also especially when Harvey Fierstein is talking to people of the TKTS line and they have no idea who he is.

We saw Avenue Q when it was on 14th Street and felt it wuld be the success it turned out to be.

All that said, I found ""Show Business - The Road to Broadway"" a must have for any hard-core theater maven - its educational, amusingly insightful, and, ultimately quite entertaining.",1197417600,,357,5.2631578947368425
2918543,4,B000UAE7NG,"Broadway shows live - or die - on the sound of two hands clapping.  Their origins begin long before that hoped-for sound.  ""Show Business - The Road to Broadway"" traces that road and does it with candor and wit.  There are surprises aplenty as the front runner show, the certain shoe-in winner, the pick of the critic watchers loses by a nose at the box office.  The real winner, the long shot, a decidedly unusual kind of show that might have a footnote in theater annals, triumphs.  A perfect Hollywood ending. This is the charm, and perhaps the weakness, of this documentary.  It's predictable in an unpredictable way - and we get to see the success of the Tony winner without ever really understanding what made it the winner.  I enjoyed watching all that goes into putting a show on Broadway.  I wished I had been given a little more of what that success really finally looked like.  And this may have been the point all along.  No matter how good a show is, no matter how well it is planned and executed, the real test is the taste of the audience.  In the case of these four Broadway shows, we are left with the uneasy suspicion that audiences may not always have the best taste.  Maybe seeing this movie will help make us better audiences.",1197331200,,1247,4.469026548672566
2918544,4,B000UAE7NG,"Very good account of the risks in producing an economic success in the Broadway Musical Theater.  As we might guess, the creators of this documentary give us no magic formula for winning the game.  Nonetheless, the account lets you cheer and jeer the contestants with appropriate background for later discussion with similar-minded folk.

Not being a Boy George fan, I didn't find this portion particularly enchanting.  But, your mileage may vary.",1195948800,,447,5.253521126760563

2918547,2,B000UAE7NG,"Frankly, I was disappointed in the DVD.  What was advertised wasn't what it delivered.  I expected to see and hear actual performances instead of listening to people talking over any reminance of a performance.",1194912000,4,210,5.147058823529412
2918548,5,B000UAE7NG,"If you love Broadway Musicals - even if you live thousands of miles from New York and have to be content with road companies or the annual televised Tony Awards - you need to see this DVD. I'm sure Producer/Director Dori Bernstein had no idea when she chose to follow four ""high profile"" (meaning, in most cases, BIG BUDGET) musicals making their Broadway debut in 2004, that these shows would succeed (or, in one major disaster, fail). But with the help of ""co-producer"" Alan Cumming, she received unprecedented access to filming the productions from early conception to the opening (and closing) nights. Everything happens in ""real time"".

If you don't remember who won the Tony Award for Best Musical you'll find the film even more entertaining as the ""mystery"" is revealed, but - even if you do - you'll learn a lot and hear some great music. The DVD is also loaded with some great surprises. Hang in for the final credits - where Wicked's star Idina Menzel does a hip-hop version of ""Lullaby of Broadway""!

There's 30 minutes of insightful bonus footage with interviews with the performers and other creative team members in each of the four musicals and even a Study Guide on DVD-ROM.

Gone are the days when shows spent a year ""trying out"" in cities like Philadelphia and Boston. Now they head straight for Broadway (or sometimes, like Avenue Q, are discovered ""downtown"" - off-Broadway). The stakes are high and a failure can be costly. And, now, there's always a Disney production to compete with for the theatergoer's dollar (more likely $101.50!).

You'll spend hours with this DVD and it belongs in the collection of anyone who loves the Broadway musical.

2918549,5,B000UAE7NG,"This was a great insight to the broadway life style. It showed how hard alot of people work to make one show a sucess or a failure.

Even if you have a great talent... your career could vanish if you catch a reviewer on a bad night.

IT was SO AWESOME to actually see some parts of the production that i listen to all the time...Wicked and Avenue Q...It also showed us parts of Taboo and Caroline or Change...which is a surprizing story of reality and dreams.

Although i do not live anywhere near New York and the Lights of Broadway...i sure do dream about them everyday, This documentary is a great thing for anyone who loves musical theatre. I recomend an open mind for it all, I wish more people see this and know that even though broadway is a dangerous road its a road well worth it.",1194739200,,789,4.281879194630872

2918551,5,B000UAE7NG,"I'll refrain from reviewing the movie as other reviewers have already addressed that aspect of the film.  The bonus features on this DVD are enticing on their own.  Liza Minnelli, Alan Cummings, John Lithgow, Brian Dennehy, Antonio Bandares, Patrick Stewart and more share their Broadway experiences in a private and personal conversational manner which makes one wish entire films were devoted to these one on one conversations.  Donna Murphy has a particularly passionate and moving conversation about her love of Broadway.  Dori Bernstein, Jeff Marx and Alan Cummings provide audio commentary.  A study guide, deleted scenes, bonus Footage, Tony Awards clips and Broadway cares all round out the package making this a fantastic behind-the-scenes peek into making a Broadway musical which also makes one wish this were one of a nine or ten volume encyclopedic video series.",1193529600,12,875,5.357664233576642

8212633,5,B000UAE7NG,"Me and my authors team we're writing a Musical for the Italian stages trying to steal the secret of the Broadway masters.

We're reading every book about musical crafting in order to learn best practice and I have to say that we enjoyed watching this DVD during one of our writing session.

Watching the composer and lyricist trying to find the right words and mood for the songs, finding the right notes for a musical, we saw the hard work behind the curtain and the light inside the eyes of all the people involved in the creative process.

We learned a lot about a world that is so far from Italian show business and this DVD unveils some of the aspect we always wanted to know.

A musical show will tell you an amazing story, but the crafting of the same musical will tell another exciting story made of passionate people, hard work, anecdotes and authors that are ""real"" characters that act in a big stage made of music, words and street full of lights like Broadway (and shadows)

This is listed as documentary, but instead of calling documentary I would say that it is a ""Storytelling of storytellers""; maybe it could be a new movie genre :)",1378425600,,1148,4.5
