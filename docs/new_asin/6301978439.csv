403200,4,6301978439,"This film contains a superior Joan Crawford performance, and one in which her fans should appreciate. It took courage for Crawford, who was, in 1941, the glamour girl of 49 movies and the idol of autograph hounds to be the face in A WOMAN'S FACE. When you come to know her as Anna Holm on the screen, she is a sullen slattern, the brain trust of a ring of sniveling criminals, a sort of female ""Sea Wolf"" who beats, bullies and blackmails her victims. The reason for this behaviour you discover in a series of flashbacks from a Swedish courtroom, where, heavily veiled, Anna stands trial for murder. From the testimony you learn that when she was 5, her brilliant, drunken father had set fire to her room. From then on she has been disfigured by a ghastly scar that criss-crosses her right cheek from mouth to eye and is only rarely revealed by M-G-M. Shunned by a horrified society, she has sought refuge in music, painting, poetry and alcohol only to find final solace and revenge in a life of crime. All this changes when she meets Conrad Veidt...........M-G-M's remake of the 1937 Swedish film - which starred Ingrid Bergman - unfortunately loses its brisk forward-moving psychological narrative and dissolves into an overexposure of melodramatic sweetness and light. But, in 1941, most critics were impressed by Crawford's savage, snarling performance & gave her a four star rating, calling A WOMAN'S FACE her fortune!",1005350400,3,1423,4.836065573770492
403201,4,6301978439,"Cukor matches Joan Crawford's moral, social and, er, facial transformation with his own generic transformation.  The film, despite its underworld milieu and courtroom framework, begins as ripe melodrama; it closes as a finger-disfiguringly tense thriller.  Crawford plays one of the most remarkable female characters in Hollywood's history - how many female ganglords, blackmailers, thieves and women of easy virtue get not only to morally redeem themselves, but get the man too?  Behind it all, Cukor shapes a fierce, ironic social critique, and pulls off some of his most remarkable shots, my favourite being the hall of mirrors Joan admires herself in after the operation.",985910400,2,675,5.471153846153846
403202,3,6301978439,"A Woman's Face has some great moments.  The problem lies in that you fall asleep between the great moments.  It also takes a couple of watchings to fully grasp the intricate plot.  There's also a child that is first-season-Andy-Griffith-Show-Opie cute.  If you love campy Crawford, you won't find much here.",984787200,,307,5.08
403203,3,6301978439,"This movie, a remake of a Swedish film starring Ingrid Bergman, begins in  a courtroom, with Joan Crawford on trial for murder.  As each witness takes  the stand we learn the background of the case.  Rather soap opera-ish, with  Crawford's character's later softness not too convincing, nevertheless  Conrad Veidt is excellent as Torsten Barring.  END",904694400,3,351,5.2727272727272725

7819151,3,6301978439,"is great.  It's Joan Crawford in probably her best MGM role.  After well over a decade Joan herself said ""this is for me"" and the studio, not knowing what else to do with her, tossed her this bone.  And what a bone.

Away from Gable and Montgomery and Tracy she is the star of the show.  And what a show.  It's not a great show (it gets sloppy in the second half) but this is Joan Crawford without a costar (Melvyn Douglas?) and without glamorous settings, unless you count snowbanks and late night bars as glamorous.

It's her high point at MGM, circa 1941.  And in 1941 MGM was the place to be.  And Crawford knew it.  She took the role and ran.  And she gallops.

George Cukor directs this tale of a scarred woman involved in blackmail.  The first half is better than the second, which slides into melodrama, but the production qualities are wonderful.  It's Crawford's last good hitch at MGM.  And she makes the best of it.

Drama and intrigue and mystery give way, in the second half, to snowbanks and some old guys birthday party and a sleigh ride with Joan toting a gun and some drippy, cute kid who is the reason why all of the snowbanks and suspicion happens in the first place.  It may sound silly but it's her best role at the studio of the stars.  She shines here.  And yes, she shoots the gun.

Melvyn Douglas is his usual self.  Capable and perfunctory.  He's there.  Live with it.  He's integral to the plot, and the plot ends with him and Joan so just get used to him being there.  Okay?

Crawford, after ""The Women"" was really willing to stretch her limited wings and certainly did so.  ""Strange Cargo"", ""Susan and God"" and this film, ""A Woman's Face""  Anyone like that you have to admire.  And she wasn't all that talented, but here, she really gives it her all.",1335916800,,1780,4.3577981651376145
7819152,5,6301978439,"This is probably Crawford's BEST. Crawford plays a woman who is disfigured due to a childhood fire as a child. Because of this, she eventually starts a ring that exploits others for their weaknesses and blackmails them. When she targets a woman of a doctor who is carrying on with a younger man and goes to her house to shake her down and on the way out, falls over and meets up with the husband(Melvyn Douglas), who is also a plastic surgeon dealing with scarred faces and offers to do her face. She accepts, takes the surgery, and she is transformed outside with a flawless face. Yet she is still hanging with unsavory folks like Conrad Veidt, who tells her about his family where the young grandson is the sole heir of a great fortune and by her playing the governess she can help do away with the youngster. Well, she gets the job, but loves the little one and can't do the job, but eventually, she does an act and goes to trial where the movie starts up at. Very interesting case study and good movie. Kudos to TCM for bringing this movie to the viewers. Done originally in 1937 with Ingrid Bergman.",1311811200,,1104,4.416666666666667
7819153,5,6301978439,"In the 1940's Joan's career really started to unravel. She was no longer the sweet little working girl. Joan wanted to branch out and show her true acting capabilities, and ""A Woman's Face"" was her first shot at that, and one of her most ambitious feature presentations.

In this gorgeous black and white film, Joan played Anna Holm, otherwise known as Ingrid Paulson. Anna lived with a severe facial scar that left her disfigured. Joan looked completely different as Anna because she was no longer glamorous or dressed to the nines. Even when she played the poorest working girl, Joan always looked devastatingly beautiful. In ""A Woman's Face"" she relied on her natural talent of acting to shine through by letting the viewers see a unique and diverse piece of her.

Here are Miss Crawford's personal comments about this film: I have nothing but the best to say for ""A Woman's Face."" I finally shocked both the critics and the public into realizing the fact that I really was, at heart, a dramatic actress.

The apparent self-hatred that Anna feels is very evident. This woman can hardly even look in the mirror, let alone allow anyone to look at her face. She is in constant pain. Because, like an old newspaper the world just threw her away and discarded her without a second thought. Anna would think nothing of conning anyone because she hates everyone, but most of all, she hates herself.

Anna soon has a new lease on life, thanks to Dr. Dr. Gustaf Segert (played by the legendary Melvyn Douglas) who performs surgery on her face and transforms her into the beauty that we are all more familiar with. But she gets mixed up with her lover, Torsten Barring, (Conrad Veidt) who only wants to use her and  take advantage of her for his own dishonest gain.

This is one of those rare movies that Joan made where her true acting really shines brighter than anything else. It was also a rather unique picture because Joan's character was so corrupt, yet so vulnerable. I consider this role a pivotal part for Joan, just as Sadie Thompson was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rain/dp/B00011D1MC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rain</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harriet-Craig/dp/6303962068/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harriet Craig</a>&nbsp;was (movie same title.) Because all of these women were so perpetually abused and all of them had so much hostility. But, ""A Woman's Face"" is altered from the others, because the transformation of Anna was perhaps more subtle and mysterious.

The director of the film is the renowned George Cukor (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Camille/dp/B0009S4IH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Camille</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-Faced-Woman/dp/6301976282/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two Faced Woman</a>) and the film is 105 minutes in length. Like the majority of her movies, throughout her fifty year career, this movie was produced by MGM. And, like the majority of her films today, ""A Woman's Face"" is distributed by Warner Home Video.

Some people can't believe that someone who's barely out of their teens would be infatuated with a woman who made movies half of a century ago. There is so much about Joan that fascinates me. She just gave so much of herself. She gave everything she had when she made a movie. Joan was the quintessential example of what a true movie star was (and should be.) And besides, there aren't any stars of my generation who have the talent, determination, stamina, drive and sheer will-power that Joan Crawford always possessed.",1201564800,7,3676,5.56350626118068
7819154,5,6301978439,"Yes,this is Joan Crawfords best movie. It is even better than ""Mildred Pierce"", and Joan always insisted she deserved at least a nomination. Many people say Joans Nemises,Bette Davis was a better actress. However aside from 2 or 3 roles she did, I disagree. Not only do I think Joan was/is an underrated actress, she more than pulls out all the stops she had stored up from being at the best movie studio in the world for the past 15-odd years. Joan morphs into a character part here folks;not just a pretty movie star reciting her lines while the camera is rolling, but an actress. I don't want to give away too much; but Joan really took a gamble on her career to play such an unsympathetic/shocking(for the time)and unsavory part. The nasty piece of work she embodies here rivals any movie""villian"" you have ever seen,and celebrated director George Cukor consistently keeps a tender quality that showcases Annas(Joans character)more humane side...In the past Joan had played not-so nice characters, but never one like this...this is a very meaty part for an actress of any time period, and you can tell she had been starving for a role like this. This is a first-rate production with a stellar cast(Melvyn Douglass,Marjorie Main,Conraid Veidt),all MGM staples that made whatever roles they had been assigned glow & sparkle with talent and grace. The costumes,scenery,(fim-noir)production value are all first-rate as well and the suspense of the pivotal third act scenes rival any Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece. It is too bad MGM ignored marketing this film in 1941 and stuck Joan with the very worst scripts before and soon after this film in an effort to""oust""her. Had this quality continued,she would have been another katherine Hepburn with 4 oscars.",1196121600,3,1755,5.013698630136986

7819156,4,6301978439,"Mediocrity served up competently. Joan Crawford plays a blackmailer by trade with a heart of brimstone - all because of a hideous scar on her face. She meets Conrad Veidt, an even nastier character, and they scheme to murder Veidt's little nephew in order to get his inheritance.

But then Crawford meets a doctor (Melvyn Douglas) who performs an operation on her face and makes her beautiful. She goes back to Veidt, who wants to pick up where they left off, but Crawford is a ""changed"" woman - inside and out. When Veidt tries to murder the nephew himself, Crawford shoots him, which brings about her trial for murder.

The whole plot of the movie is told in flashbacks at the trial as each witness comes before the judge and tells what he knows - an interesting idea, despite being somewhat stagey. Crawford, Veidt, and Douglas all perform admirably, and George Cukor's direction is good, as far as it goes. The ""mediocrity"" mentioned at the beginning of this review centers on the material, the story itself, which seems rather tired and mild, and no one (not Cukor or any of the actors) comes forward to go beyond it. Thus the movie feels like just another day at the office. Not a flop by any means, but it could've been much sharper. Certainly it's worthy enough to be issued on DVD!",1132617600,,1290,4.604347826086957

7819158,5,6301978439,Anyone who doubts Joan Crawford's acting ability should watch the first half of this wonderful George Cukor film (second half dissolves into standard MGM melodrama fare).  She is heartbreaking and constantly compelling.  One wonders what could have happened to her career if she had been used more for her talent than her looks.  Conrad Veidt is her spine tingling costar.  A dynamic and dastardly duo!,1030147200,9,402,5.138461538461539
7819159,5,6301978439,"To the point: Joan once said her performance in A Woman's Face has led her in winning an Oscar for Mildred Pierce. Directed by George Cukor A Woman's Face was indeed a film that shows that Joan was not only a star but an dramatic actress.
