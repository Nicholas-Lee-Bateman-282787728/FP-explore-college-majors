8716866,5,B00XW936XY,"Mrs. Brown's Boys is the best comedy in years!  Be prepared for the language content to be a little raw at times, but it doesn't take away from the comedy, it actually makes it funnier most of the time.  I love this series!",1463961600,,223,4.162790697674419
8716867,5,B00XW936XY,For those who have never watched Mrs Brown's Boys all I can say is that I truly feel sorry for you.  She is a foul mouth mother with the best of intentions.  I can see why this is one the most popular shows in Ireland and England.  I just don't understand why they don't show the series in the US.,1451260800,,297,3.9166666666666665
