7852796,5,6303591531,This tape only comes in VHS.  I am on my third tape of this video because it is always in my exercise rotation and wears out.  Works all muscle groups in a short amount of time.,1333324800,,177,3.888888888888889
7852797,3,6303591531,This wasn't the best but it does work. The trainer(tony) is incredibly annoying and the tape lacks variety in color. If you are trying it purely for more variety go for it but if you are looking for a fun exciting workout. forget it.,1059696000,3,233,4.318181818181818
7852798,5,6303591531,"Honestly, I was surprised at how hard Rachel focused on her workout, and not on the way she looked. She just went for it. Sweat, messy hair and even a few mistakes. The whole experience is effective, the results are  immediate and I never seem to get bored with it. I would reccomend this to  anyone, at any fitness level. Not your typical ""super"" model  workout.",914457600,8,363,4.46969696969697
