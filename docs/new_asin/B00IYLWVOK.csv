8646471,5,B00IYLWVOK,I've always been a fan of Linda Ronstadt.  What a voice!  You won't find any other collection of Linda in concert that captures these performances.  Some say the quality isn't what it should or could be. Not the point.  This is great stuff!,1426982400,,240,4.511627906976744
8646472,5,B00IYLWVOK,"A couple of excellent shows.  I read the concerns about the quality of the videos and I have to say I thought they were fine. I don't know what is expected of video taken thirty years ago. On my TV it was A-OK. As I have never attended a Linda Ronstadt concert, it was a great experience. Great watching Danny Kortchmar at work, as it was watching Waddy Wachtel on another DVD. Very pleased with product.",1424563200,,404,4.315789473684211

8646477,1,B00IYLWVOK,"Over the years, I have listen to everything from AM radio, to 8 track, to FM, to Blue Ray.  This is by far, the worst sounding software I have ever heard.  I love Linda Ronstadt, that's why I bought this disc.  It was actually painful to listen to this.  Whoever put this disc out should be ashamed of themselves.  I don't know how the sound could be so bad.  It's really, really bad.  Very compressed, no dynamics, very limited frequency response.  Really, AM radio sounds better than this, much better!  Linda Ronstadt deserves better.
I hope someone will put out a DVD of her music, that sounds better than this, it can't sound any worse!",1408838400,7,641,4.504347826086956
8646478,5,B00IYLWVOK,Excellent job of creating DVD with very old video and audio footage. Would highly recommend for any Linda Ronstadt fan. The songs are mostly all classics and done as only Linda could do them.,1406073600,4,191,4.647058823529412
