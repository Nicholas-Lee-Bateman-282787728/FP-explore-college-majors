My friends and I laughed so hard I thought we were going to start crying.  I'm counting down the days till it's release.  This is not high-brow humor (think Orgazmo and Shakes the Clown), and it's definitely not mainstream - despite what other reviewers are saying.

1898731,1,B00009ZPU7,"This movie is terrible. I love Mr. Show and think Bob Odenkirk, David Cross, and co. are comic geniuses. But this movie is pure garbage. The best parts are lame copies of what was already done on Mr. Show and they've destroyed the pacing, creativity, and cutting edge humor that made Mr Show great.",1227657600,,298,4.537037037037037
1898732,1,B00009ZPU7,"David Cross and Bob Odenkirk vigorously warned their fans to steer clear of this film, and brother, they weren't kidding. This thing is unbelievably disappointing. And it's not because I don't appreciate Cross and Odenkirk's brand of humor. On the contrary, I find their MR. SHOW program to be a smart, inspired, outrageous, wickedly funny TV series -- which won a loyal audience despite the fact that HBO never promoted it properly. Perhaps their freewheeling, satirical, sketch-comedy style would have worn out its welcome in a feature-length format, but we don't get to see exactly what their true artistic intentions were, since they had no control over the final edit of RUN RONNIE RUN. It was severely revised without their approval. Which begs this question to those decision-makers: Was the original cut really worse than this version?

A fine supporting cast is wasted. Jill Talley, so wonderful on MR. SHOW, is handed the thankless role of Ronnie's (Cross's) loyal spouse. Other great MR. SHOW players -- Tom Kenny, Brian Posehn, Mary Lynn Rajskub -- are also ill-served, though it's hard to tell if they were underutilized in the original version or whether they fell victim to the editor's scalpel.

Likewise, there's cameo appearances by Ben Stiller, Trey Parker, Matt Stone, David Foley, Andy Richter, Gary Shandling, Patrick Warburton, Laura Kightlinger, Scott Thompson, Jeff Goldblum and other folks who don't get much funny stuff to do. Instead, there's footage of Nikki Cox running around in a bikini -- a welcome factor in any movie, although it doesn't add anything to the comedy content.

If you enjoy watching Cross and Odenkirk strut their stuff, my advice is to stick with MR. SHOW instead. Each episode is everything RUN RONNIE RUN should have been.",1221177600,,1774,5.0893470790378
1898733,5,B00009ZPU7,"Don't let that mullet fool you because this is one funny movie! The story centers around Ronnie Dobbs who is one ""Crazy Redneck"", but he's really just a Skynyrd lovin' ""good old boy"" trying to stay out of trouble. Although the film has a loose plot, there are several hysterically funny skits with some hilarious cameos from a lot of my favorite funny people!

From the opening faux theater announcements to the gut busting ""scene that was removed from the film"" this is a hilarious crack up of a satire! I can't remember when I laughed this hard watching a comedy film! It's short in length, but long on laughs and is a must see film that is sure to have a cult following.

1898735,4,B00009ZPU7,"In a day when it's hard to find a comedy that you can actually laugh aloud, Run Ronnie Run is just that. The characters are off-beat, and David Cross is at his funniest in this silly comedy. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that wants or needs a good laugh.",1206057600,12,264,4.196078431372549
1898736,4,B00009ZPU7,"Fans of MR SHOW are well familiar with actors/writers David Cross and Bob Odenkirk. But for those of us who have never had the chance to see the show, we might have no idea what to expect from this film. Here's the scoop on it: it's funny. Laugh out loud funny.

The story revolves around Ronnie Dobbs (Cross), a mullet headed trouble maker whose major successes in life are getting arrested. Always on the lookout for trouble, Ronnie gets picked up at the drop of a hat. One of his arrests is viewed on a C.O.P.S. like show and he develops fans from this appearance.

British inventor and infomercial host Terry Twillstein (Odenkirk) see the effects watching Ronnie has on his staff. He immediately tracks Dobbs down and posts his bail with the promise to remove him from the county. Taking Dobbs to Hollywood, Twillstein gets a weekly series featuring Ronnie being arrested in cities all across America. This redneck, backwoods character strikes a chord with viewers that catapults him to the number one show on TV, knocking out a show that's a dig on the reality series SURVIVOR (a clip of which is hilarious).

With all of the money he ever needed, with his friends living with him, with a chance to even meet the woman of his dreams, the beer poster lady (Nikki Cox), Ronnie still finds himself unhappy. All he wants is his wife of three times Tammy (Jill Talley) to be with him. But he even messes that up.

When Ronnie makes a return visit home for a parade, the ex-sheriff (now governor) keeps his word, arresting Ronnie and tossing him in jail (on death row even!). But terrorists kidnap the Governor's son and hold him hostage, demanding that Ronnie be released into their hands.

If you want to find out what happens, then go rent this one. It's filled with so many jokes and laughs that there is no way to list them all (nor would I want to) here and now. Take offs on television shows (the infomercial one had me laughing so hard I had to pause the disc), censored portions of films (with one of the crudest songs I've ever heard) and even pre-film cartoons supporting the concession stand (right at the beginning so you know what to expect the rest of the way) are all done so well that you can't help but smile after watching.

Cross has always done a great job in the things I've seen him in. One of those familiar yet not recognized faces that you need to know, he makes Ronnie Dobbs come to life.

The film is also filled with cameos galore, featuring stars like Garry Shandling, John and Rebecca Romijn Stamos, Jeff Goldblum, Jack Black, Dave Foley, Andy Richter, Kent McCord, Mandy Patinkin, Ben Stiller, Patrick Wharburton and more.

A word to the wise: this movie is not meant for children. A few off color words and a lot of dark humor pervade that adults will understand and laugh at all the more, while children have no business learning. So don't use this one as a plug in baby sitter. Send the kids to bed and try not to laugh too loud and wake them. It's one of those movies you don't know what to expect and find hilarious.

By the way...I knew Ronnie's growing up. And that makes the movie all the more funny. I think we all did at one time or another. Let's just hope they're not all as successful as this one.",1205539200,,3241,4.461148648648648
1898737,4,B00009ZPU7,"If you like David Cross, or if you like trailer trash as a source of laughs, then this movie is for you.

1898759,4,B00009ZPU7,"I have seen this on the shelf at the rental store for the past couple of years, and just never taken a chance to rent it. Finally on a preview on another movie I saw this one, and it looked funny...and it is. Its just plain stupid comedy that you can eject your brain for 90 minutes and laugh it up.  Ronnie is a hell raiser in a small Georgia town, and he has a loyal following of locals.  He's been married 3 times...to the same woman, and all of his kids are named ronnie...and of course, they live in a trailer. See where this is going.  Well, Ronnie is notorious for being on the TV show FUZZ, similar to COPS, for being arrested the most times, and for doing outrageos things.  Well, a failing hollywood inventor/producer see some video of Ronnie on one of his escapades and decides this is his golden ticket to a hit show.  He sells the pitch to network executives, ant they take it.  Well, the movie takes off from their. Watch the rise, fall, and rebirth of Ronnie.  Many cameos made in this movie by celebreties, Kathy griffith, jeff goldbloom, Rebecca romaine and john Stamos, and some of the Kids in the Hall gang such as dave foley. One bonus are some of the songs in between, just outrageously stupid..but I couldn't stop laughing. Check it out, worth buying here on amazon.",1168560000,,1288,4.38655462184874

surprise surprise! this freaking movie was funny. it borders on dumb redneck humor mixed with dumb and dumber, or something like that. there were a lot of memorable quotes and characters and that is something i didn't expect. i figure if you know about it then you probably enjoyed it enough to be entertaining. i know i did. for those of you who hadn't watched this, it is slightly offensive but worth a look.",1154563200,3,691,4.2748091603053435

For those of you who are fans of Mr. Show and the original Ronnie skit, you aren't gonna find much new here.  Pretty much a rehashing of that same skit, which plays (the skit) hilarious for the ten or so minutes it was on, but not enough material to develop into a feature length film worthy of Bob and David's talents.  Granted it is pretty fun to watch with other friends who are familiar with the show, but the laughs get spread pretty thin.  I subconsciously hoped that the movie would somehow segue at certain points to another skit, as Mr. Show did so brilliantly over its 4 seasons.  The movie's worth a view for you die-hard Mr. Show fans, but can't say I'd add it to my collection. Bob and David recounted their disappointment with the movie and the director on their website.

1898765,5,B00009ZPU7,"Cult Classic. This movie is an absolute riot. I must admit, after reading the less than stellar reviews, I was extremely skeptikal about RRR and wasn't expecting much. My friends, this is one of the funniest movies ever made. Its not the genius comedy of mr. show, but if you like seeing juicer blades fly out of a juicer and lodge into the heart of a tv saleswoman during an infomercial, you'll love this movie. Take it for what it is and love every minute of the white trash roustabouts. Bob's character Terry Twillsteen has some of the funniest lines I've ever seen delivered in any film.

David Cross and Bob Odenkirk are an amazing comic pairing and they've produced some great comedy together over the years.

I thought this movie was funny.  The characters played by Cross and Odenkirk are based on a skit they did on ""Mr. Show"".  They've developed them and stretched them to ridiculous lengths to create an entire film based on the simplistic personality of Ronnie Dobbs - the mullet-wearing hick rebel who can't keep himself from getting into trouble and being arrested.

I would say the highlight of the film would have to be the R&B montage they created for Ronnie's love scene with Nikki Cox's character. It's hilarious. Plenty of star cameos in this movie help it along.  It has its moments, but I don't believe it's the best movie Cross and Odenkirk have in them.

1898782,2,B00009ZPU7,"Making a feature film about Ronnie Dobbs was a bad idea. Trying to whitewash him into less of an abusive moron so he would make a better lead character was a bad idea. Trying to fit Mr. Show sketches and characters into a semi-formulaic movie was a bad idea.

The writing seemed so-so... Sometimes it's amusing. Sometimes it's lame. Sometimes it's just taken right from Mr. Show, which I found annoying. I already saw that sketch, and it was done better on the show. The direction and feel of the movie is pretty terrible, way too mainstream and typically crappy. It doesn't serve off-the-wall comedy at all. This is the laming of the tv show. The movie isn't totally unhumorous, but it really would have been better if it hadn't been made. In comparison to the show, this is pretty much trash. And trash belongs in the gutter, not your mind.

The best parts for me were the brief moment when Ronnie is naked ontop a roof swinging a chain (that actually made me laugh out loud), and the new ""Three Times One Minus One"" song. The song is funnier than either of the ""videos"" that accompany it. You might want to just download the song.

If you're a Mr. Show fan and you decide to see this, set your expectations very low. If you're not familiar with Mr. Show, check out the show instead of this movie.",1125792000,5,1299,4.449579831932773

In fact, however, this is one movie that cannot be missed if you love slapstic, crude, frat-boy humor in a mindless film format. This is better than ""Old School"" or ""Anchorman"" or ""Dodgeball"" or ""Wedding Crashers"" or any other movie of the last few years which has effectively used ensemble cast humor to leave you absolutely dying laughing at the ""I can't believe they said that - man that's messed up"" hilarity of it all.

The gratuituous cameos by hollywood stars as Dobbs climbs the fame ranks (Jeff Goldblum's hippie rant) and small, comedy roles (Scott Thompson does an unforgetable bit role as a recruiter for the international gay conspiracy) make this film worth watching. But what makes the film worth owning is David Cross and Bob Odenkirk, easily two of the most over-looked (commercial success-wise) comedians of the nineties. These guys helped invent Tenacious D with Jack Black and Kyle Gass - they do acerbic, spot-on humor that makes you often question whether they're being serious or just crossing the line a little too much.

""Mr. Show"" was boring, lame postmodern sketch comedy created by actors with a shocking lack of originality and an all-engulfing smugness.  It quoted pop culture without commenting on it, mixed up timelines for no reason, and presented the unoriginal convention of actors pulling themselves out of paper-thin characters, then back in again.  I have never seen anything so unfunny and artless generate such buzz amongst hipsters, who never quit reminding you how much more clever and educated they are than the average Joe.
That is, until I was finally forced into watching Run Ronnie Run.  It started as a very stupid riff on ""Cops"" in one of ""Mr. Show's"" early episodes (maybe even the first one), where its deconstruction was so surface-level that I can sum up the entire thing in one sentence: Ronnie Dobbs is a white-trash screw-up (with a mullet! ha ha!) who gets drunk, then arrested, serially.
Hilarious.  Who woulda thunk of such a creative setup?  Except, of course, for just about every sketch comedy show and live improv group I've ever seen.

Nuh-uh.
For a movie that's supposed to be a comedy, there's scarce humor in the first twenty minutes; we plod along from one scene of Ronnie's life to the next with no energy, no enthusiasm, no point.  We learn that Ronnie Dobbs is a dimwit, but so what?  You'd know that if you started the movie with the amusing house-chase scene, and ran it from there.
'Mr. Show' brought the hard stuff to the party with a variety of characters from Cross, Odenkirk, and their ensemble.  In 'Run Ronnie Run' they're all are stuck, with few exceptions, slogging through the same characters throughout.  I can't help but feel that if they'd put on some wigs and varied things up a bit more (as the Monty Python players did in their classics), the movie could have been a real hoot.
If you stick with the movie long enough to be amazed at all the cameos, eventually you'll laugh.  (How is it that bits like the ""Gay Conspiracy"" weren't worked in more often, anyway?)  But it's just not worth the effort to get there; it is, in fact, a sadistic reminder of Bob and David's absence from HBO.

This movie is still flat-out terrific, even if Bob and David don't endorse it themselves ... it seems like their dislike of the film might be more to do with disillusionment over the final product and less regarding actual disparagement of what was made. Personally - and I'm not the only ""person"" holding this view - I thought that this film captured (no pun intended) Ronnie Dobbs in a manner that Mr. Show never could have, and made him human - whereas before he was simply a hilarious charicature.
It seems to me that there was NO WAY to stretch ""FUZZ: the musical"" into a full length film unless there were significant changes made to the Ronnie and Terry characters. No one does latent homosexuality better than Bob and David, and curse me for saying so, but that little bit of homo-happiness came across as damn sweet in this movie. Ronnie's love for Tammy was also a fabulous motivating force, and really improved upon the ""wife-beatin'-911-it's-me-again"" Ronnie (simply because what's funny in a sketch show must be altered to incorporate an overaraching storyline). I truly liked the ""new"" Terry, who actually cared for Ronnie rather than wanting to exploit him - as in the first ep, first season of Mr. Show.
If a wonderfully written, well-sung and acted brilliant film isn't enough for you, the appearances by Trey and Matt, Jack Black, Scott Thompson, John and Rebecca, Jeff Goldblum et al. should make the film more than worth watching.

1898826,3,B00009ZPU7,"I will start with an opening disclaimer: I bought 'Run Ronnie Run' for Nikki Cox.  I have been a fan of her (and Kevin Connolly) since the WB's ""Unhappily Ever After"" and anxiously awaited the straight-to-video release of this comedy.  I knew/know very little about the acclaimed ""Mr. Show"", other than the character, here, of Ronnie Dobbs was featured briefly during its airing.  What this film is, basically, is a parody of reality television and Hollywood.  What you get from start to finish are endless gags and sick slapstick jokes entwined around a somewhat funny plot and character.
Ronnie Dobbs, played by David Cross, is the textbook example of trailer trash.  He drinks, does not work, his ex-wife lives in a trailer, etc. (It doesn't get much more obvious.)  What makes him interesting is that he spends his time running from the police, after committing such ""crimes"" as messing up a Piggly-Wiggly sign.  One of the funniest bits of the movie was watching the semi-overweight cops chase him through a house and fumble around unlike the ones on television's ""Cops"".  Then when a dim-witted inventor, Terry Twillstein (Bob Odenkirk), stumbles upon the idea of giving Dobbs his own reality show, everything falls into place.  From there Ronnie's left to deal with his own successions and decide if it's the life he wants.  The story is almost pointless, as it seems they just used the story to throw in whatever seemed funniest or fitting at the time.  There are a number of hilarious cameos from such well-known actors as Jeff Goldblum, Jack Black, Dave Foley, Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Garry Shandling, and Ben Stiller (amongst others); and a couple of hilarious scenes--the Three Times One Minus One video and the ""Survivor"" takeoff particularly.  But in the end, cameos and spoofs don't make an entire movie.
At just 87 minutes, 'Ron Ronnie Run' is be no means perfect.  Yes, it is very funny and at times quite smart in its parodies and whatnot.  But the predictability of a character like Ronnie Dobbs, along with such useless running gags as Clay's injuries (which, by the way, are not final until the VERY end of the credits), it's hard to give this movie more than 3 stars.  If you're a fan of ""Mr. Show"" or are looking for a few good laughs, 'Run Ronnie Run' is worth watching.  And finally, if nothing else, you get Nikki Cox in a thong.

1898838,1,B00009ZPU7,"...this is a really lousy comedy, and a great example of the failures of the movie studio system.  At its worst, this feels like the result of some tense boardroom meetings staffed by people oblivious to the talents of David Cross and Bob Odenkirk.
Ronnie Dobbs is a funny character in his two appearances on the beloved and missed MR. SHOW, but expanding his original skits into a barely-90-minute movie just didn't work.  Cross performs well, as do the majority of the actors involved, but the material itself is hackneyed, badly-written, and at times glaringly obvious in its hopes to produce another Adam Sandler-type Hollywood feel-good comedy.  When the movie puts out something funny (the self-help guru scene comes to mind), it's paced so differently that it seems as if it not only has a different writer (most likely Cross/Odenkirk) but a different director as well.  Otherwise, we're stuck with an embarrassing pattern: the cheapest, least clever jokes are repeated as running gags, while the jokes with best potential are left as pulled punches.
Badly-shot, clumsily-edited, with a voiceover and exposition which feel entirely tacked-on, this is a movie that I am happy to have rented before considering buying it.  I'm a huge fan of MR. SHOW and had been chomping at the bit to see this movie for years (yes, years), but having finally seen it, I got no more enjoyment out of it than I would have any other direct-to-video comedy...and that is a total shame.  I hope that Bob and David get another opportunity to make a movie or show with a company that is actually confident enough in them to let them hold the reins themselves.  We may not get a perfect project (they are at times a bit self-indulgent), but we sure couldn't get anything much worse than RUN RONNIE RUN!.",1065571200,6,1785,4.813725490196078

I was actually turned on to this show after seeing the trailer on another New Line film. I recognized David Cross from his appearance on the Drew Carey show.
The opening sequence for the DVD was cute and goofy enough, and I would like to see it appear again on other New Line titles.
The film really takes no prisoners in the things that it spoofs on. From the COPS copycat ""FUZZ"" to the raunchy R&B video spoof Three Times One Minus One, the film left me laughing ... .
Another aspect of the film that I really enjoyed was the cast's ability to deliver realistic southern accents and southern redneck dialogue. I live in Georgia, and I am familiar with the city of Doraville.  I find a lot of forced southern accents to be obnoxious, but Cross and crew sounded real and not just ignorant.
Another great thing to see was all of the cameos that were done in this movie. Gary Shandling, John and Rebecca Stamos and Jeff Goldblum.
Two of the cameos deserve a highlight; Mandy Patikin offers a nude scene as 'Ronnie Dobbs' in Ronnie: The Musical, and Jack Black shows his singing chops in the psuedo-deleted scene from a film that looks a lot like Mary Poppins.

SHOW's choatic, subversive approach to comedy, is almost always amusing, frequently hilarious, and occasionally jaw-droppingly bold.  Some of the MR. SHOW cast members are seriously shortchanged, but both David and Bob shine in a smart, dumb comedy littered with mindboggling vignettes and entertaining celebrity cameos.  While a Bob and David-supervised cut of this film would certainly be preferable (deleted scenes hint at greater things, in particular a dropping out of character into themselves that doesn't just break but demolishes the fourth wall), this version is still worth five stars....Ten stars couldn't do these guys justice, if they were truly let loose.

1898841,3,B00009ZPU7,"I will definitely say that this movie is for Mr. Show fans only, and even if you are a super diehard like me, the movie still is not that great.  Many of the segments are straight from the Ronnie Dobbs sketches so we've already laughed at those lines before.  However, we do get an updated Ernie with a new ""superpan"" and the return of Three Times One Minus One, and of course it could not be complete without great newscasts.  However, it is the type of off the wall humor that MOST LIKELY only true fans will enjoy.  There are probably some newbies that will like it, but certainly more that will not.  The film goes off on tangents that are funny to us, but unrelated to the plot as a whole, like the Scott Thompson scene.  I enjoyed it, but I won't buy it or watch it again unless someone else puts it on.",1065139200,,809,4.187096774193549
1898842,4,B00009ZPU7,"I am one of the few people to actually love Run Ronnie Run.  I am not a diehard Mr Show fan.  In fact I only got into it Mr Show once it came out on DVD and I checkd it out at a friend's.  But they had this really awesome character, Ronnie Dobbs, who always cracked me up with his white-trash 80s rocker attitude and quips.  He was my second favorite part of the show, coming in secondly only to Three Times One Minus One - but we'll get to that later.
Anyway, Run Ronnie Run is a funny story about Ronnie Dobbs, a white trash rocker who stumbles his way into his own reality show (a spoof of Cops) thanks to his hilarious run-in's with the law.  The show takes him to Hollywood, where love and friendship and plenty other obstacles ruin Ronnie's all-day Hollywood fun.
Basically, if you like slapstick comedy, that doesn't have to have the best script, acting, directing, or budget...Then this is your movie.  Any Mr Show fan definitely needs to buy this, and generally if you like goofy, offbeat comedy you will love this too.",1064707200,,1028,4.356020942408377
1898843,3,B00009ZPU7,"This is a terrible movie with a few moments that are completely hilarious.  I haven't laughed as hard at certain parts in this movie since Mr. Show, and probably never before that.  And it's worth watching for those moments.  It has an abundance of disappointing sophomoric jokes, but then they always rally  after with a great Mr. Show-esque gag.  It's perfect for today's marketed movie crowd, the teen and 20 somethings who sit through comedies like this all the time.  The difference is, the other crap they sit through has no diamonds in it.",1064361600,,546,4.75531914893617
1898844,3,B00009ZPU7,"The long-awaited Mr. Show movie, brought to you by those two funny monkeys, Bob Odenkirk and David Cross.  Despite huge cuts and delays (this was supposed to be theatrically released like three years ago, but everybody associated with it balked come distribution time), and the modest panning of it by Bob and David themselves, I'm happy to say Run Ronnie Run is pretty good.  Not great, but how many comedies based on sketch show characters really soar?
This one is about Ronnie Dobbs (played by Cross), a white trash bumpkin who repeatedly finds himself being arrested on a popular reality television show which in deference to Michael Moore, shall remain unamed (`Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do...').  This gets the attention of an effeminate British Tv producer (played by Odenkirk) who has the brainy idea to create a reality show based solely around Ronnie getting arrested.  The show is a hit, and Ronnie must deal with that cursed, cursed demon called mega-popularity and wealth.
Ronnie's character is toned down a little from the Tv series, showing a genuine love for his down-home wife (three times divorced) and basically setting the plot, which is `get back to basics and regain lost love.'  Also, much of Ronnie's gags we've already seen on the show (just about all of them actually, except for a laugh-out loud scene where a drunken Ronnie, `resplendent' in a Sammy Hagar t-shirt, drives a hijacked school bus through a high school dance's giant tiki head and then tips it over on the football field, pinning his buddy underneath).  Bob merges two of his characters from the show (the psychotic British infomercial host and the effete Tv producer) But that's all incidental.  The new gags here are hilarious.
Particular standouts are:
-The piece of glass from the exploding food processor flying into the chick's chest being looped on the editing machine (it sounds sick, but really, you gotta see it)
- The Three Times One Minus One video: 3x1-1 are Bob and David's brilliant R+B alter-egoes, who do a sickeningly funny send up of the played out `I wanna sex u up' set.  The lyrics are amazing...
- Jack Black's chimney sweep musical number on the London rooftops
-The guy sitting in the bathtub during the first Ronnie chase...oh man.
- The fat kid martial arts sequence (particularly for the song being played in the background)
- Mandy Patinkin singing the Ronnie Dobbs theme wearing nothing but a straw hat (and with the same starry eyed passion as if it were Somewhere Over The Rainbow).
This isn't the best structured film you've ever seen, and it doesn't hit every time. If your idea of a good comedy is Airplane or Hexed, you'll love this.  Its a pretty good sendup of the garbage being pumped into our living rooms by reality-programming-happy Tv suits every night, with enough poop jokes to keep the kids laughing.  There's also a slew of cameos; Jeff Goldstein (I mean Goldbloom), Ben Stiller, R. Lee Ermey (Sir! Yes sir!), Dave Foley, Scott McCullough, Andy Richter, as well as most of the original Mr. Show cast, all very funny.  As a matter of fact, I don't see why Bob and David aren't at least marginally proud of this.  Its not the masterpiece Mr. Show was, but its not a total loss.  Maybe all this false humility is just to catch us Mr. Show fans with our pants down...make us lower our guard and be more forgiving of their first film foray.  It'd be just like those creeps...
Well anyway, when its funny, its very funny indeed.",1064188800,7,3468,4.758333333333334
1898845,2,B00009ZPU7,"As a voracious Mr. Show fan, I had expected that Bob & David's feature film debut (as a team) would be as clever and as funny as Mr. Show, the vehicle that propelled them to cult favorite status.
However, operating under a studio that re-edited and reworked their movie, Bob & David lost their creative control over their project.  The result is a movie not worthy of the Mr. Show moniker.  Significantly dumbed-down, and played out like a one-note joke, Run Ronnie Run is less like the fresh inventiveness of Mr. Show, and more like one of those tired SNL movies which features a once-brilliant character just going through the motions.
In the end, it's easy to see why Bob & David wanted to discard this film, a mangled version of their concept.  Shame on New Line Cinema for tainting the genius of Bob & David, and then shame on them for refusing to issue this film a theatrical release, only to offer the film on DVD for a quick buck.
Still, for Bob & David DVD completists, this is a must-have companion to Mr. Show.",1064188800,22,1021,4.478494623655914
1898846,3,B00009ZPU7,"For those fans of Mr. Show, beware.  This movie is not endorsed by Bob and David, and the choice to actually release it was not theirs.  They did make the movie, but they were not happy with it when the finished.  There was an earlier cut of the movie (probably including some of the deleted scenes on the DVD) that Bob and David were actually willing to release, but this is not it.
That being said, the movie is still good (Watch out for a 'dirty' cameo by none other than Jack Black himself, I fell out of my chair laughing).  It kind of breaks down in the end, when the story actually has to take precedence over the sketch style comedy.  My only other complaint is that too much of the movie was already done better in the show!  Bob's speach about letters Ronnie has recieved, and Ronnie Dobbs the musical were so much funnier when they were sketches on Mr. Show than they are in the movie.  And they completely throw out Entitilitis.  ""The killer what took me is entitilitis.  No one knows what entitilitis is, or where entitilitis comes from, but entitilitis kills.""  Comedy gold.
Reasons to see this movie:
-Good movie
-TONS of cameos:
  -THE R. Lee Emory
  -Jack Black
  -Dave Foley
  -Andy Richter
  -Jeff Goldblum
  -Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park
  -MUCH more
-The soundtrack, which features many of the bands created over the years for Mr. Show, including Tool's alter egos.
-Bob and David.  These guys rock.  They rock SO hard.",1063756800,5,1452,4.5096525096525095
1898847,4,B00009ZPU7,"I believe this movie was actually written and filmed before Joe Dirt, but not released in time, as ""thunder"" from this ""genre"" was stolen by more well known, and less funny David Spade.  It is a shame, because even though Bob Odenkirk and David Cross have produced much better work than this, it is still miles better than the half-decent Joe Dirt.
If you have never heard of Mr. Show with Bob and David, but are in the mood for some semi-intelligent white trash laughs, check this one out. Mr. Show die-hard fans will enjoy the opportunity to see the old cast of characters back together again.

1898861,4,B00009ZPU7,"Despite Bob and David's own scathing reviews and the at times slow pace of the film, Run Ronnie Run still stands as one of the best comedies in recent years.
Keeping in mind that Bob and David originally wanted to do an entirely different film but were pressured into making a Ronnie Dobbs movie.
Keeping in mind that Bob and David were eventually snaked by Troy Miller when they were barred from partaking in the editing process.
Keeping in mind that the story is thin and the pace fluctuates between raging Mr. Show hyper-irony and dull Hollywood shlock.
It's really not that bad of a movie.
The Thrilling Miracles segment was pure twisted genius.
The 3 Times 1 Minus 1 video was perhaps the most pointed take on...RnB love songs yet.
And the Ass Kicking Fat Kid scene was the best hurried plot resolution device I've ever seen.
Even if the plot was trite, characters thin and the pace slow, the calibre of comedy in this film is still unmatched by any movies of late and more than made up for its flaws.",1061337600,23,1006,4.502732240437158

1898863,4,B00009ZPU7,"Because Mr. Show raised the bar so high for modern sketch comedy, they actually should have probably left this project alone.  A movie just isn't the right medium for the scattershot social satire of the series.  That being said I love this movie, it is hilarious and very much in the spirit of the program.  A couple of scenes could use some editing and tightening but overall it achieves its goal.  Bob and David denounce this film on their web site, but come on guys, at least people are finally gonna get a chance to see it.  Which pleases every Mr. Show fan I know. Highlights are Terry Twillstein's invention photos, Jack Black's song and dance, Mandy Patikin's broadway song as Ronnie.

1898864,2,B00009ZPU7,"I was excited when i heard Bob and David say they were making this film on Dennis Miller live.  I mean those two are some of the funniest guys out there, their show ""Mr. Show"" was an absolute brilliant piece of work.  For some reason, the film was still in the ""shooting"" stage for several years.  Once it was done it was never released in theatres, aside from being shown at the cannes film festival.  I often wondered why it never came out....until i saw it.
I wasn't exactly sure how how i'd describe this film until i told my brother about it.  He and i both being huge Mr. Show fans.  When i told him just about everything about the film he said ""So....it's one of those films that has some funny stuff in it but it'd otherwise kind of hard to watch?""
Yeah that about sums it up.
About the biggest problem with the film is the Ronnie Dobbs character himself.  In the Mr. Show episodes he was a low class, angry, violent, idiotic, self-centered a-hole.  However, that really is what makes him funny.  The film sort of tones that side of him down and tries to create a sort of sweet side to him, to make him more appealing i suppose.  Ronnie has some sort of crush on some trailer park chick named tammy (no, its really not as funny as it sounds).  You might remember tammy from a few scenes in Mr. Show.  One scene where she's ratting him out to the cops as he shouts ""Lying B$%ch!"" over and over. Another where he meets up with her after being and jail, and noticing that she's pregnent remarks ""Ok who you been F#&$ing?  It travis?""
While thats not nice stuff to say, for some reason its halarious to see that complete lack of empathy.  Which is, once again, the ronnie dobbs charm.  No such luck in this movie though.  He's quite tame in his remarks and actions, he basically spends most of the film trying to win tammy.  Wasnt that the plot to Joe dirt?  And didn't joe dirt show that you cant really have a low class, idiotic, self centered a-hole who's also lovable?  One or the other here fellas.
I only saw one small scene in the movie where i actually recognized the Mr. Show character.  After becoming rich and famous, but still not attaining tammy, he thinks of an idea to make her jealous by introducing her to the beer model he's been dating.  The plan backfires and ronnie just upsets both women.  After tammy leaves, upset, ronnie remarks to the beer model ""way to go b&^ch, you blew it"".  She slaps him and leaves as well.  Thats about all you can expect in the ways of a Mr. Show ronnie.
There are lots of surprisingly funny scenes, one involving R. Lee Ermy and a fat kid and others with the pop group ""three times one minus one"",  but i'd say about 50% of the film is just dead air.  There's scenes that sort of try to be funny, but just come off as dumb or banal, or even just weird.  such as ronnie meets a korean kid in a wheelchair who has some sort of terminal foot disorder and needs some kind of special shoes.  For some reason...david's voice is dubbed over the kids.  But even more strage is that Ronnie just starts wistfully dreaming out loud about the things he'd do to keep the kid from getting his special shoes.  It comes off as odd seeing how much work they put into making ronnie some kind of lovable guy.
The basic plot is bizarre.  You can tell an entire team of writers were working on it and pieced their work together in some sort of shoddy, hacked together final draft.  All in all the story could of been told in about a half hour.  You can basically tell how it's going to end about 10 minutes into the film.
All in all, my brother said it best.  Theres funny stuff yeah....but you'll find yourself wandering into other rooms to do things while watching this film; or wearing out your fast forward button.",1059782400,7,3752,4.30527817403709
1898865,1,B00009ZPU7,"this film was described by bob and david themselves as ""a giant [...] that we took"". apparently the film was taken away from the two genius comedians and hacked to pieces by the studio and the director, hoping to make a mainstream comedy out of absurdist material. the story goes that for every nine hilarious, trademark ""mr. show"" type jokes, there would be one fart gag, and that fart gag would go in to the final cut at the expense of everything else. at least, it seems that way, because there are really good jokes struggling to crawl out of tedious, limp exercises in celebrity cameos and now-dated topical humor. the bit with the ""fooderator"" (it totally destroys food!) should be priceless, but you end up paying quite a bit for it when you think of all the unfunny, bland, trite stuff that surrounds it. david looks physically uncomfortable trying to maintain a  comical southern demeanor throughout the film, and the cinematography and editing are far below the standard set by ""mr. show"". it's exhausting and disheartening to get through this film. but it's to bob and david's credit that despite this debacle they're still working and doing the funniest work of their careers. i'm sure that their next project will more than make up for this disappointing failure. but the only reason to buy this dvd is to hope that bob and david maybe might get a cent out of it (which I sincerely doubt).",1059436800,5,1402,4.699186991869919
