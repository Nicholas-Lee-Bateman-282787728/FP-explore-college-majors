8366762,3,B002E2QHA4,"This documentary seems to be shot by an amateur cameraman and narrator...so be prepared for less than ""fair"" production quality. Filmed in England at a swap meet/motorcycle auction. That said the motorcycles are great..!!!. Tons of old bikes on display with some very rare example of turn of the century motorcycles. If you can get past the amateur feel of the production, the DVD is great for the views of the old bikes.",1259971200,2,421,4.780821917808219
