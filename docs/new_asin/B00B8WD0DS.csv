5563386,4,B00B8WD0DS,"""Lore"" (2012 co-production from Australia and Germany; 109 min.) brings the story of Lore, a teenage girl, and her 4 younger siblings. As the movie opens, seemingly far-away WWII is coming to a close (with the announcement that the Fuhrer is dead). We  soon learn that Lore's parents are high up in the Nazi party and sure to be arrested by the Allies. Lore's mother implores Lore to take her siblings up north to Hamburg to where Omi is (Lore's grandmother). The problem is that Lore and her siblings are in the Black Forest (Southwest Germany) and that Hamburg is far, far away. With no money and no food, the siblings face a quasi-impossible task. Then at a certain point they make the acquaintance of Thomas, who appears to have escaped one of the concentration camps. Now a goup of six, they work their way further north. At this point we are not quite yet half-way into the movie but to tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this is the bleakest movie that I have seen in a long, long time. Much of the movie confronts you with the fact that food was scarce and people will do just about anything to get some food. Just when you think that the situation of the siblings can't get worse, it does. Lore's youngest sibling is baby Peter, maybe 6 months old I'm guessing. You would expect baby Peter to be crying quite a bit under these circumstances, and that is exactly what we see on screen, no sugarcoating of any kind. Kudos to Saskia Rosendahl in the title role, she will simply blow you away with this performance. I must give a caveat about the way the movie is filmed and edited, with numerous extreme close-ups (of hands, faces, plants, anything really) and handheld camera shots.

Bottom line, though, is that this movie about an impossible journey makes for gripping and rewarding viewing. I had seen the previews of this several times and when this opened at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati, I went to see it right away as I figure this will no play very long, given the nature of the movie, but I could be wrong. In fact, the screening I saw this at today was reasonably well attended, although I did see an older couple walk out in the middle of the movie, I guess they couldn't take it anymore. If you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie that makes for at times difficult but ultimately rewarding viewing, do not miss this. ""Lore"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1367539200,20,2503,4.520971302428256
5563387,2,B00B8WD0DS,"I found this to be a pretensious, turgid, hopeless, almost cliche-ridden film with 2-dimensional characters, terrible editing that substitutes for weak story-telling, relentless close-up cinematography and quick cutting, and basically a threadbare story that beats a dead horse of little interest to modern or non-German audiences. Not a single character is sympathetic. The kind of film that uses a crying baby and deliberately half-revealed facts throughout to evoke pity, hopelessness and horror.",1365120000,10,499,5.944444444444445
5563388,5,B00B8WD0DS,"Most of us have seen many films about WW2.  Most of what I've seen has been well-made and correctly shows the insanity of Hitler, the cruelty of the Nazis, the complacency or fear shown by German adults about challenging ""the system"" and the horror of the Holocaust.  This one is different.  Although it passes through all of the above, it asks a question for all of us:  If you loved and trusted your parents (or any role model) and they embedded a certain point of view in your heart and head, how long would it take for you to even be open to another reality when you began to see contrary evidence in the outside world - especially when your parents told you that you would encounter nothing but propaganda and lies?  How long would it take?  Especially if you grew up in a time when there was not much outside media and you were only 14 years old living in a society where everyone around you believed the same thing as your parents or were too afraid to even hint at anything different. As an American, this made me think about all the things we've done in the world during my lifetime that I accepted because, in my heart, I still believe after all is said and done, that we are the good guys.  If we do something on the world stage that seems questionable, there must be a good and ethical reason for having done it.
The feel of the film is totally authentic, the acting as real as you can imagine, the photography and direction brings you very close to the characters and their feelings and it left me with lots on my mind:  What should I believe?  How would a Jewish person react to this film?  What has been the mindset of an entire generation of Germans who grew up during this period?  What should the rest of us learn about our deepest beliefs regarding other people?
This would be a great film for families or groups to watch, then discuss.
Bottom line for me, even if someone could find some flaw in the writing, acting, direction or filming, this film deserves the highest rating and is a ""must see"" for anyone who cares about people.",1364169600,88,2051,4.371052631578947
5563389,5,B00B8WD0DS,"This movie is a beautifully filmed and acted story of a young, post World War II refugee, who walks across Germany with her younger siblings to the relative safety of her grandmother's house. The girl's parents are Nazis, and she has believed that dogma throughout her young life.  Shortly into the story, she is helped and then accompanied by another refugee, a survivor of the death camps, on whose assistance the family must depend.  Without giving too much of the story away, it dawns on the girl, that her father was not who he seemed to be.  Indeed, he was a monster.  And her Jewish savior, whom she ridiculed and yet felt a physical attraction to, ended up not being who he said he was either.  This is a deeply personal story of one young woman's loss of innocence and evolution as a human being.  Through her we see the complex realities of post war Germany and like her, we examine what we regard as truth.",1364083200,10,917,4.493975903614458
5563390,4,B00B8WD0DS,"Lore is a captivating 2012 coming-of-age drama about a 15 year old girl who tries to shepherd her 4 younger siblings 500 kilometers across war-devastated Germany at the end of WW 2. The film was adapted from Rachel Seifferts 2001 novel The Dark Room.

The film is beautifully photographed by Australia born Adam Arkapaw who is best known in that country for films like The Snowtown Murders (2011), Animal Kingdom (2010), and End of Town (2006).

The child actors are marvelous, especially Saskia Rosendahl (as Lore) and Nele Trebs as her younger sister.

This is a German production with English subtitles.

Australia born writer/director Cate Shortland is best known for the award winning film Somersault (2004). She does a good job showing the trials and tribulations of the journey, especially the tension between the once proud elite and the realities of the new world, but her choice of shots keeps us at a distance from the participants.

Lore won awards at various smaller film festivals (Hamburg, Hamptons International, Hessian, Stockholm, Valladolid) and nominated for best film at others (London, Sydney). Hollywood News called it a devastatingly stirring Germany-set drama and said it was unquestionably unforgettable. Variety said it offers a fresh, intimate and most successful perspective on Germanys traumatic transition from conqueror nation to occupied state.

Bottom line  an unusual look at post WW2 Germany that is beautifully photographed and well-acted.

5563396,5,B00B8WD0DS,"I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I watched this movie on a whim, yet three days and three viewings later, I can't get it out of my head. Lore is a fantastic piece of film art whose dark beauty stays with you long after the credits have rolled. With each viewing, my appreciation grows more intense. Director Cate Shortland refuses all forms of exposition, and reveals the story only through gorgeously filmed scenes. This technique will turn off the Hollywood loving types, but patient viewers will be rewarded, because every scene is full of poetry and emotional power.

We witness the the descent of German society into disorder and chaos immediately following the end of WW2. Caught in the political and social maelstrom are five children led by Lore, a girl of 17 years. The disintegration of Lore's physical world is a reflection of what is going on in her mind as she comes to an awareness, then to grips with the awful reality that her most cherished ideals are lies, and her personal heroes are monsters. This theme comes to full circle at the end when Lore sees clearly that the things she has been taught are contemptibly false, and the rules she clung to are irretrievably broken.

One of the catalysts for Lore's shift in perspective is the appearance of a charismatic young man who takes the family under his care. We know scant about ""Thomas,"" except that he may or may not be a Jew, someone who Lore has been trained to despise her whole life. Lore is simultaneously repulsed and attracted to him. This combination of powerful emotions created some of the most electrifying scenes filmed between two human beings. The couple never even kissed, yet the mere brushing of Thomas's foot on Lore's had more erotic power than the entire catalog from Vivid.

Don't watch Lore expecting to be entertained. Its tone is relentlessly bleak. Don't expect plot surprises. There are no clever narrative gymnastics. Don't expect to be informed. You will go away with more questions than answers. Do watch it because it is a thing of beauty. A film whose raw emotional power pulls you into its fabric even as you want to turn away.",1461888000,,2143,4.694148936170213

The Holocaust was a terrible time for everyone, and I feel for the German kids who were indoctrinated and raised to hate a people that is so used to persecution. Everything about it was intentional, which some other reviews don't seem to see. I don't think Shortland meant for this film to wrap up with a little bow in the end. The disjointed filming, sparse dialogue, open ending. The soundtrack. Every character, even those not explored, are very real.

5563421,1,B00B8WD0DS,"I can understand the filmmaker's desire to make a harrowing tale, but one can lead only so far into Hell before those being led turn back and flee.  My understanding was that the premise of ""Lore"" was a young woman's developing fascination with a teenage Jewish refuge.  It would be a coming to understand his culture and perhaps becoming more sympathetic to his beliefs.
  What ""Lore"" delivered was no appearance of the young man until (at least) a half an hour in; prior to that point, there was gratuitous nudity, a man fondling his wife's genitals, a dog being shot, a corpse bloody and being devoured by ants, a man found dead of a gunshot wound to the head, and a perpetually crying infant being feasted upon by bed bugs.
  I have seen horror films less graphic and far less violently imagined.  I found ""Lore"" not so much a linear projection of a tale, but more a series of disturbing images...and I just reached the point where they ceased to resonate or hold an interest.",1399766400,9,980,4.565714285714286

This film brings alive the stories my German landlord told me about when he witnessed the deprivation and depression that the war left in  it's aftermath.

5563425,5,B00B8WD0DS,"What I appreciated most about this movie was the unusual perspective. Rarely do we see a film about post World War II from the viewpoint of the Germans. And there is good reason for that. It would be nearly impossible to create empathy for the characters. This is where this film excels.

Five German siblings under age 14 are abandoned by their parents, a high-ranking Nazi officer and his wife. These children are the privileged ones suddenly thrust into an unfamiliar and threatening world. They have been thoroughly convinced of the righteousness of their parents' ideology. However, now that the war is over and the truth is being revealed, these children have to grapple with both the physical trauma of privation and the emotional trauma of discovering the ugly truth about their parents.

The film is well-constructed and the actors are exceptionally good at their craft. I highly recommend this movie.",1395619200,,910,5.0198675496688745
5563426,3,B00B8WD0DS,"Whether you will like Lore or not depends on what you expect from this German-Australian movie and its unique storytelling. Set in the Allied occupied Germany, a 14-year-old girl Hannelore Dressler (Saskia Rosendahl), a Nazi officers daughter, has to travel about 500 miles to Hamburg where her aunt lives, with her four siblings. During the grueling journey Lore is helped by a young Jewish man Thomas (Kai Malina), and she learns what happened to the people she is taught to hate.

This is an interesting story (based on a Rachel Seiffert novel ""The Dark Room"" which I have not read), but director Cate Shortland chose a rather unconventional approach to tell it in her sophomore feature. Instead of explaining the back story of the Dresslers, or how and why Lores parents have to leave their children alone, the director employs a series of short impressionistic scenes to follow the childrens journey.

This means the film often jumps from one vignette (sometimes in slow motion and close up) to another, without explaining what happened in between. The psychological changes Lore goes through are often expressed with a symbolic act. As a result, Lore may feel somewhat emotionally detached, despite the childrens long journey.

The best thing about the film is the beautifully shot cinematography that manages to convey an uneasy atmosphere of post-war rural community of Germany, and the strong acting from the star Saskia Rosendahl. This is not my cup of tea, but her performance is impressive.",1394064000,,1502,5.0728744939271255

5563428,5,B00B8WD0DS,"Kafka once wrote that good art shatters the ice within.  Director Cate Shortland`s film, `Lore` comes close to doing just that.  A tale of family disintegration set in post-Hitler Germany, `Lore` is a well-crafted and subtly affecting film.

Stunning newcomer Saskia Rosendahl plays Lore, the eldest daughter of a Nazi official who hides his family in the waning days of the Reich.  After burning compromising documents of his Nazi past, the father is swallowed up amidst the chaos of the war`s final days.  His trophy wife turns herself into the Allies for the inevitable `de-Nazification` process of DP camps and `re-education. `
Lore is left with the unimaginable burden of parenting her younger siblings as they make their way across a devastated Germany in hopes of finding relatives who will take them in.  Their journey is fraught with perils of all sorts: starvation, attempted rape, murder and the occupation forces.

When Lore and siblings are caught in the American sector, their game is nearly up.  Yet, another refugee, this time from the death and concentration camps, fibs on their behalf, claiming to be their guardian.  Lore reluctantly accepts the guidance and help of their Jewish benefactor, Thomas.  Having been raised to fear and abhor all things Juden, Lore is confused as to what to make of their new guide and helper.

As the tiny band stumbles ever northwards, truths are revealed and prejudices are questionned.  Lore slowly and painfully sheds the lies and bigotry with which she was raised.  The sheltered Lore fears not only all things Jewish but even those Germans deemed `subhuman` within the matrix of Nazi ideology.  When she meets a local farm boy with a club foot, Lore recoils in disgust and contempt.  But it is when she sees pictures of the concentration camps that Lore`s worldview begins to change irrevocably.  Could her father have been responsible for such unfathomable cruelty and brutality?  Whilst Rosendahl`s Lore wrestles with torment, the background is one of bucolic serenity.  The breathtaking cinematography of Adam Agatow contrasts the nastiness of Nazi savagery with the lush and verdant German countryside.

Moreover, the film accurately shows the level of delusion that ordinary Germans harbored towards their leader and their government.  In an eerie scene, the children, Hansel and Gretel-like, stumble upon an abandoned farmhouse whose sole inhabitant, a stolid peasant woman, has the children sing Nazi lieders for their bread and makes the defiant claim about Adolf, `He loved us so much. `  As they finally reach their relatives, the children`s aunt sternly lectures them about their parents, `They did nothing wrong! ` In the film`s final scene, Lore has had enough of the lies and deception of her youth and breaks with her past.  Subtle and understated, this scene sums up the gentle power of this film.

Agatow`s eye is magnificient. Germany, with her mists, impenetrable forests and gloomy seas is all here.  As are shots of amazing portent and precision:  the peasant woman`s hands stained black with dye, a cigarette crushed out on a pristine marble floor, the languid, oily movements of a caught lamprey in a fisherman`s bucket, all symbols of greater, more malevolent ills.  The film uses a minimum of dialogue.  Instead Rosendahl`s Lore and Kai Malina`s Thomas express a complex mix of attraction, fear and mistrust with the smallest of physical details.

Lore is small-budget gem, just the film for those interested in how external events shape the individual.  More than anything, it masterfully captures tyranny`s greatest crime: deception of the innocent.",1388448000,5,3632,5.160683760683761
5563429,5,B00B8WD0DS,This movie has all the aspects that need a masterpiece: a well-told story and good actors. Saskia Rosendahl is simply wonderful.,1387756800,,128,5.142857142857143
5563430,2,B00B8WD0DS,"This film seems to withhold its story and leaves one frustrated at times at fuzzy scenes, like the beginning long one in which a then-unknown girl tries to get a comb through her wet hair. The comb through hair gets repeated again, both inexplicably. Water figures repeatedly, beautifully, but again inexplicably.

The plot seems to hold back on its meaning at times.

What is new is the perspective of rural Germans the children encounter during their long escape after the war is over. None of the Germans take the attitude of being in this all together and being willing to help children.
It is interesting to learn about 'Russian', 'Polish', 'French' and 'British' zones the children pass through after the war and that they choose the safest to enter.

The Germans have seen photographs of stacks of naked bodies piled in heaps. They typically express denial and skepticism: 'They are actors.' 'They are taken from different angles so it will seem there are more.' Lore is told by her cold, authoritarian Grandmother, her hand holding the child's wrist tightly, 'Your parents' (both Nazis) 'did nothing wrong, do you hear!?'

Lore goes through a transition from a Nazi, anti-Jew, viewpoint to realizing she was wrong but the film stints on her recovery, how thorough it goes.
It is not clear why the young Jewish man who seems to throw in his lot with them and help them, leaves. This is one of the unclear parts.

The worst fact of this movie is the way the 11-month old baby is used. Maybe there are no laws against bad treatment of children-too-young-to-act in the countries it was filmed in. Maybe that's why it was filmed there, in Australia. The baby is being hauled around crying throughout the film. Once, he is reaching out his arms, crying. Presumably his mother is just out of camera range, but she doesn't come to him and these are the negative experiences this child will carry all his life.
In the mivie the baby is used 'to get food' or is offered 'so you can get food' or 'is asked to be left 'so I can get food'. It seems to me the real baby's parents used him in this way: to get money, without regard for the baby's needs; it is shameful and unethical, and it should be unacceptable that film companies use young children's pain to enhance the artistic value of their product. -- I have seen other babies express real pain in movies. This isn't acting. It is squeezing out of a small human being what they can't understand. I saw a very small child in a movie scream in utter terror as she was being put into a car. But the director got the shot. And the parents got paid their money. (I think Sean Penn was in that movie though I may be wrong.) Actors, camerapeople and other support personnel should refuse to do scenes in which children are experiencing real pain.

The reality that, often times, children are both the first to see injustice, and the first to experience it was boldly evident. As the oldest of her siblings, Lore was the last to accept the reality of the atrocities their parents and others had committed; the older someone was in the movie, the less likely it was that they could accept the horrific images of the concentration camps. The movie was a complex, bittersweet portrait of evil through a child's eyes. There were a few moments that I think the filming method and independent genre may have overspun (cue: burgeoning sexuality), but I would call it a must see, regardless!!",1382400000,3,688,4.694214876033058
5563433,5,B00B8WD0DS,"A beautiful film about how nature eventually overturns all our human contrivances.

We meet Lore (Saskia Rosendahl) and her family in the immediate aftermath of the Nazi capitulation in 1945: Mutti und Vati (German for Mummy and Daddy, though curiously not so translated in the subtitles) are SS functionaries based in Munich who have realised that the game - and quite possibly their number - is up. They hastily pack trunks, burn incriminating evidence, shoot the dog and flee in a canvas covered truck to a safe house in the depths of the Bavarian black forest, but even there they cannot escape the American occupiers' tightening net.

Father (Hans-Jochen Wagner) is silently apprehended and eventually Mother (Ursina Lardi), an archetypal stiff, glacial Aryan, walks out of the woods to hand herself in. She coldly leaves Lore, a strikingly handsome girl of 15, to fend for the family, comprising; sister Liesel (Nele Trebs), twin 7 year-olds Gnther (Andr Frid) and Jrgen (Mika Seidel) and baby Peter (Nick Holaschke). Mutti's parting instructions: head to your grandmother's house in Hamburg: we'll meet you there.

Hamburg is a long way from the Schwartzwald. In her face you can read that Mother doesn't believe they'll make it that far, and doesn't believe she will either. In her face you can read the end of days.

As the children of the deposed murderous elite the children find themselves unwelcome in their rural retreat. Lore packs some things and the children set out: at a basic level, the film becomes a post-apocalyptic road movie, as harrowing as Cormac McCarthy's The Road. The environment they traverse, in human terms, is blasted to hell, but nature is having her traditional ball: the countryside is in beautiful late summer bloom: Adam Arkapaw's luscious cinematography often pauses to observe the moss, mould spores, pollen, flies and ants, which settle, feast and propagate as happily on human remains and the detritus of conflict as readily as on any other flora or fauna.

The children are confronted with the residue, all around, of unspeakable and desperate acts; though, by and large, the survivors are now civil, but they are as untrusting of each other as they are of their American occupiers. The locals still harbour resentment for the Jews, as if they somehow asked for this to be brought on the German people. They are obliged to view photographs of Belsen and Auschwitz as they cue for food, but there is open disbelief at their legitimacy.

Lore is well-raised (in her Nazi household), is disgusted by the squalor and insists at first on cleanliness and orderliness. She is poised precisely on the brink of sexual maturity and is aware that this would have currency in the squalor, where her trinkets and keepsakes have little value. She is also aware in particular of a fellow traveller, Thomas (Kai-Peter Malina), who seems to be tracking the children, and Lore in particular, with nefarious intent. Circumstances throw them together: Thomas reveals himself to be of good intentions, but to Lore's initial horror, bears the tattoos and papers of an Auschwitz survivor.

Over this dilemma the film proceeds: this is Lore's coming of age, it is her revaluation of all values and a study in the triumph of nature - our nature, and nature red in tooth and claw - over the feeble contrivances of frail humans. It is starkly captured, often in extreme close-up and low light: there is a graininess to the film stock which supplements the gritty life of the characters. Saskia Rosendahl's debut performance is quite magnificent: magnetic and enigmatic, and a solid centre to this highly recommended film.

Especially recommended because, for all its apparent Europeanness, it is scripted and directed by Cate Shortland, an Australian. I sat through most of this film thinking, ""why can't Anglo-Saxon directors make films like this?"", so Shortland deserves special recognition for the authenticity of her vision. Clearly, they can.

This movie shows the human side of it by exposing the intimate lives of citizens once their governments run wild and eventually crumble. There is an important, understated message in this to all Americans as well: your string holders may be big now, but once they fall, the world will hate you.

5563440,4,B00B8WD0DS,"I never really thought about what happened in Europe immediately after WWII ended. This film gives a devastating depiction of this.

Here's the scoop. WWII is over. A German father and mother send their oldest daughter, Lore, along with her younger sister, younger twin brothers, and an infant, with instructions on getting to a relative's house in the country. Dad is a German officer and will commit suicide. Mom is a Nazi and will do the same. They have no intention of meeting up with their children. The kids start an arduous journey through allied occupied territory. They befriend a Jew who helps them along the way. This is ugly and disheartening, particularly for Lore who needs to remain the focus for her siblings.

This is horribly powerful stuff. Germany is divided between the U.S., the Soviets and the Brits. You need papers to move around. The trains are temporarily shut down. These kids need to barter for food. Lore herself, who is a young teenager, realizes she may need to use her charms to survive. They witness suicides, dead bodies that appear to have been subjected to rape and torture and all other manner of ugliness. But Lore is steeped in Nazi propaganda. She has no idea the Nazis have surrendered. She thinks they are on the verge of their final victory. And when she sees the photos of piles of dead, concentration camp Jews, she hears others say the Americans paid actors to do that, and she wants to believe them. When this Jew wants to help them, she berates him repeating all the Nazi slurs common at the time. But she comes to trust him. He could have blown them off at any juncture but he didn't. This and other things destroy her innocence. And when she reaches her aunt's house in the country, and sees what a witch this woman is, it annihilates any youth she has left.

This is a great film. The depictions of post war Germany and how the war didn't end right away for the non-military folk is heartbreaking. This is a tough watch due to it's content but well worth seeing for any film fan.",1376956800,,2031,4.574175824175824

5563442,5,B00B8WD0DS,"The holocaust, Nazis and racism are common themes in many films today.  In fact, it almost never fails that 90% of Oscar's Foreign Language ballot consists of historical films based on the holocaust.  `Lore', Australia's official entry for the Oscar's last year, is no exception.  Taking place in Germany shortly after Hitler's death, `Lore' gives us a different look at the atrocities, or the aftermath of those atrocities, offering us the perspective of the children brought up to follow Hitler and his regime.

I have to say this; I was completely floored at the direction taken by this film.  It is uncommon to find the lives and views of the `villains' exposed with such sympathy.  Having the film basically follow these young children as they are abandoned and cast aside because of their beliefs and their parent's political stance, we are brought in to their world and find ourselves `fraternizing' with the enemy in a way.  I loved that aspect of this film.  Even though Lore and her siblings are far from `enemies', especially since they are molded by their parents and their surroundings and haven't the full knowledge or understanding in order to make those decisions on their own, following their journey and seeing their venom spiked forbearance is like something I haven't seen before.

Watching Lore mold her persona is astonishing.

`Lore' tells the story of teenage Lore and her younger siblings (sister Liesel, twin brothers Gunter and Jurgen and baby brother Peter) as they fend for themselves after their parents are imprisoned after Hitler's death.  Immediately finding themselves on the outs with everyone in the community, Lore is forced to flee to her grandmother's home in Hamburg.  Fourteen year-old Lore is as composed as she can be, but the journey is more than she can do on her own.  That is when she meets a young man named Thomas who offers his assistance.  He aids Lore and her siblings on their trek, until she uncovers that he is a Jew.  This automatically puts splinters in their relationship, for it causes Lore to question all she was brought up to believe.

The ending is quite devastating, in so many ways.

I must say, this was a refreshing take on a genre that is so well worked it has become somewhat tired.  It reminded me, in a way, of `The Boy in the Striped Pajamas', not in overall tone but in the way that it broached the fact that these young `Nazi children' were blinded and manipulated by society and had the ability to transcend their upbringing.  That is why that final scene is so devastating, because it shows the growth and the understanding, as bitter as it was, in the eyes of young Lore.

Cate Shorthand directs this film with a beautiful restraint, allowing the honesty of every scene to come through.  She reminds me of Jane Campion in her use of imagery (the cinematography here is astonishingly good) and grit.  There is no sugarcoating here.  The full effect of these dire circumstances is exposed in every scene.  There is also a brilliant sense of sensuality that permeates these moments, breaking down the innocence and adding a flare of romance to the proceedings.  It's a brilliant mix of tones.  The performances across the board are top notch.  Saskia Rosendahl anchors this film with a marvelous sense of balance and awareness.  You can watch her crumbling under her composure, always doing her best to be what she needs to be for the betterment of her family.  Kai-Peter Malina is mysteriously charming as Thomas.  You can see the years of mistreatment that melted his heart, not hardened it (what a beautiful contrast to the usual) and the young children (Trebs, Frid and Seidel) are all very effective.  Ursina Lardi pulls out a tremendous cameo as the children's mother.

For me, this was an incredible film.  It carried such a heavy emotional weight, and yet it balanced that with a stunning visual airiness, giving it a light and effortless movement.",1376524800,3,3930,4.82660687593423

Based on the novel ""The Dark Room"" by Rachel Seiffert, the German/Australian co-production ""Lore"" takes a look at post-World War II Europe from an unusual vantage point - not that of Hitler's countless victims but of his many rank-and-file supporters (one might say adorers) in the days immediately following his downfall.

Lore (played by the remarkable Saskia Rosendahl) is a young woman who is forced to flee with her parents and four younger siblings into the Black Forest when the Americans ""invade"" their country, arresting Nazis and Nazi-sympathizers and liberating the concentration camps. When the mother and father are eventually apprehended, Lore is left to struggle on her own to provide for herself along with her sister and three younger brothers (one a newborn) as they search for the home of their paternal grandmother.

The screenplay by Robin Mukherjee and director Cate Shortland challenges the audience by asking us to empathize with a main character who is an unapologetic supporter of Hitler and a confirmed anti-Semite to boot (even if we sense it is a result of her background and upbringing). In fact, most of the people she encounters on her journey share similar delusions about their dear leader, whom they clearly still worship even in death. They've even convinced themselves that all these pictures they're being shown of the concentration camps is mere staged ""propaganda"" by the Americans - an attitude clearly designed to assuage their own guilt and deny their own complicity in the horrors their beloved Fuhrer brought about. This anti-Semitic philosophy is really put to the test when Lore and her siblings encounter Thomas (Kai Malina), a young Jewish man who claims to have spent time in a concentration camp and who helps the family in their struggles.

The writers clearly know that the audience, craving reassurance amid all the moral chaos, would like the characters' actions to be guided by an adherence to at least some type of moral code, yet the movie, aiming for a much more insightful and honest depiction of human nature, stubbornly refuses to cater to that desire. For instance, just as Thomas appears to be settling into the role of noble victim/savior, he goes ahead and commits an act so vile - if understandable in the context of the situation - that we are thrown back in a state of moral and emotional confusion - as is Lore. In a similar way, the relationship between Thomas and Lore remains enigmatic throughout, and, only towards the end, does Lore appear to be coming to terms with the fact that everything she's been taught and raised to believe in may, in fact, be a lie.

Yet, even with that slight ray of hope at the end, the thesis of the movie seems to be that there is nothing enriching or ennobling about war, and that when it comes down to a choice between survival and morality, survival will win every time. Morals and ethics, it appears, are fine when one has the comfort of civilization and the luxury of peace to accommodate them, but when one doesn't, it truly becomes a case of every man (and, in this instance, every woman) for himself. That may be a bleak and disturbing picture of mankind but, in the world of this movie, it seems a brutally honest one.

As director, Shortland consistently juxtaposes the ugliness of the characters' lives and situations with the lyricism of the photography and setting. The result is a though-provoking and artful addition to the litany of films about the Nazi era.",1375488000,2,3488,4.873524451939292

The acting is pitch perfect.

The slow developing awareness of the young woman that her whole mindset about Germany, the Nazis, and the Jews was an indoctrinated lie, is perfectly written, directed and acted.

There is no other film that has done this effectively.

It is harrowing, provocative, and touching.

The performance by the actress who plays Lore, Saskia Rosendahl, is wonderful, especially toward the conclusion of the film when her character confronts her grandmother about this deceit, and is told that her parents did nothing wrong (her parents were National Socialists who were sent to camps by the Allies at the conclusion of the war). If you have a chance to watch the DVD, I strongly recommend that you take the time to watch the extras: ""the making of Lore"", ""deleted scenes"", ""alternate ending"", ""memories of a German girl"", and ""panel discussion"". Other reviewers here have indicated that they were confused throughout their viewing of this film, and I acknowledge that it is much easier understanding this film for individuals such as myself, a first generation American whose parents lived through the after effects of the war as children. The scene where the children encounter bombed-out buildings for the first time, and everyday scenes such as those involving mushroom hunting (there was no meat) are especially reminiscent of my mother, who grew up in an orphanage in what was to become East Germany. While I do admit that there were two scenes I did not understand, the deleted scenes extra on the DVD explains one of them. Perhaps others might find greater understanding by watching the extras as well. I agree with the director that using the ""romantic"" alternate ending for this film would have been a mistake, because the chosen ending brings some closure to the struggles that Lore experiences throughout the film. The question and answer panel discussion (which took place following a special screening of the film in February 2013, and includes the director of the Goethe-Institute Los Angeles and a contributing editor for the Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles) is interesting and provides fair treatment, but it is not recorded very well, so you may need to view it more than once. While I have read quite a few books of this genre, such as ""German Boy: A Child in War"" by Wolfgang W. E.

5563466,5,B00B8WD0DS,"One of the great things about movies is that they can take you to places and times you will never see.  Some are imagined, and some are real.  And some are a mixture.  Frankly, I've never given much thought of what became of children, presumed to be innocent, of Nazi Germany's evil establishment.  Well, ""Lore"" gives you a look.  Based on an interview (Blu ray extra) with a woman who was in this situation as a child, this is an honest look.

As the Allies swarm Germany and Hitler is defeated, Nazi officers and their families head for the hills.  In the case of one family, the father and mother are captured and imprisoned leaving their children to fend for themselves with little more than the clothes on their back, a bit of money and jewelry.  Lore is the oldest at 14 or 15 and is played by the striking Saskia Rosendahl in one of the most memorable performances of 2012.  She has an 11 year old sister, Liesel (remarkable Nele Trebs), twin brothers and an infant.

As they make their way on foot and eventually by train, to Hamburg where their grandmother and aunt live, they encounter a teenage boy who has eyes for Lore.  The boy helps the group get past American soldiers by showing his Jewish papers.  Seeing what she believes to be a sworn enemy, Lore keeps her distance.  This is a difficult film to watch and could have fallen into pretty standard fare.  But director and co-writer (with Robin Mukherjee) Cate Shortland doesn't let the romantic angle control the story.

This is a story about survival.  A story about privileged children having to grow up fast.  The bleak fortunes of the children is counterbalanced by some terrific photography thanks to Adam Arkapaw and the film has a wonderful score by Max Richter.  While the movie is dark and sometimes hard to watch, it is a remarkable piece of filmmaking and I can't say enough about Ms. Rosendahl.",1371081600,3,1873,4.590361445783133
5563467,4,B00B8WD0DS,"Set in the dying moments of World War 2 in Europe, we get to meet 15 year old Lore (Saskia Rosendahl, actually 19). Her father is a big wig Nazi and her mother is one of those German mothers who appears to have produced children purely to become Third Reich fodder, as she shows minimal interest in their welfare. As the Russians close in from the east and the Americans (who kill all children - according to Mutti) close from the west, the father does a runner and then the mother decides to hand herself over to the Americans.

She leaves Lore some money and jewellery and tells he to go to her grandmothers, this is a 5,000 kilometre trek across war torn Germany, with a little sister, twin younger brothers and a seven month old baby. The last thing her mother tells her is `you must remember who you are', which on reflection is pretty lousy advice as it soon transpires that no one wants the kids of known Nazi's anywhere near them. It is also apparent that the nazification of Lore has been complete as she and most of the people she meets along the way are still ardent Hitler supporters, all deny the evidence of the Holocaust and the camps, and still are rampant anti- Semites.

This is a complex but in many ways very honest look at a national psyche at a time of great turmoil and the contradictions and bewilderment that enforced change can bring. The acting is all excellent, there are some upsetting scenes, but all completely within context. The cinematography is brilliant, with all the shots framed and studied to award maximum effect to the storyline. This is not a war film in the sense of battles etc, but it is a film about the collateral damage that war has, both physically and mentally.

With a run time of 105 minutes this does actually fly by, it is in German and English with good sub titles. It was a co production of Austria, Germany and even Screen Australia. This is an intelligent film, it is not pretty and neither should it be based on the subject it deals with, but I found it both very watchable, believable and even moving in places, so can easily recommend.",1371081600,3,2096,4.467362924281984
5563468,5,B00B8WD0DS,"Great symbolism. Beautifully shot. Thought provoking. This movie will leave you thinking about it for a long time. Not for people who like things spelled out. You have to put a few things together while watching this movie. You have to be able to understand the context. Otherwise you will probably be left wondering why someone made such a movie. If you're looking for mindless Hollywood formulaic fare, this is not for you. If you're looking for something that makes a profound statement about post World War II Germany, humanity, and authoritarian rule, this movie is for you.",1370995200,2,579,4.918367346938775

5563470,5,B00B8WD0DS,"This is a great piece of drama in which you don't have to injection a suspension of disbelief to envision the events as true or actually happening.  As others have said the film is beautifully photographed with great acting by Saskia Rosenthal.  She plays the 14yo daughter Hannelore Dressler, LORE for short, whose Nazi parents abandon her and four siblings as the Allies close in at the end of WWII, and the parents realize they will be prosecuted and imprisoned. The father simply disappears without further ado, while the mother gives LORE a feeble explanation of being sent to some camp. She leaves Lore a small amount of money and the jewelry she acquired over her lifetime, imploring her to use it to buy food, shelter and transportation for her and her siblings to reach their maternal grandmother's in the country near Hamburg. Considering that Lore's youngest brother was still breastfeeding when his mother abandoned the children, it is up to the now 14yo matriarch of this five person band to see them through.  Ms Rosenthal gives a superbly believable and highly emotionally charged performance.  That is the basic plot, but what happens along the way to Lore and her siblings is what truly makes this story come alive. Her ingenuity in employing  ways of keeping her family alive is amazing.  For all those loving drama this will keep you enthralled from beginning to end.",1369958400,12,1386,4.876595744680851
