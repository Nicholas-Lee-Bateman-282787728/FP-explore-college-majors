7420213,5,B014LWOLSE,"I really enjoyed the movie, then went back to watch again but Amazon said it was no longer available.  What's up with that?  Will Amazon have the rights to the movie again, or have they been shut-down for good on this title?",1449705600,,224,4.309523809523809
7420214,4,B014LWOLSE,"Loved it. The movie brought back many memories; Franz Klammer's pinwheeling arms, Ken Read (who knew he spoke perfect German?), Darren Rahlves, Didier Cuche and all those horrendous crashes from over the years.",1448064000,,210,5.393939393939394
7420215,5,B014LWOLSE,"One of the best documentaries I've ever seen about skiing and ski racing.

7420216,5,B014LWOLSE,The most storied race in alpine skiing.  Impressive,1456876800,,51,5.375
7420217,1,B014LWOLSE,"It's in German, oh except for the English speaking racers then it's sub titled in German. They forgot to mention it in the description, for the benefit of the buyer!",1456790400,,165,4.533333333333333
7420218,5,B014LWOLSE,Very good,1456704000,,9,4.0
7420219,5,B014LWOLSE,"Anyone who follows ski racing will be totally blown away with this very well done production.
It truly profiles the level of absolute perfection it takes to even compete on the world cup.

The most captivating film I've ever seen on ski racing!",1455667200,,244,4.674418604651163

7420221,5,B014LWOLSE,If you love ski racing... Best ski movie ever!,1454544000,,46,4.222222222222222
7420222,5,B014LWOLSE,"If you live skiing, you'll love this movie. Great insight into the worlds' most daunting downhill and great voice over by Americas only winner of the Hannenkam and Truckee's hometown hero, Daron Rahlves!!",1454544000,,204,5.212121212121212
7420223,5,B014LWOLSE,Great movie,1454284800,,11,5.0
7420224,5,B014LWOLSE,Fascinating look at one of the greatest events in sport,1453680000,,55,4.6
7420225,2,B014LWOLSE,"A wonderful race and a wonderful idea for a documentary, but ruined by endless Red Bull product plugs (logos every 30 seconds) and endless Red Bull attitude: jittery cuts that never let you experience the whole race top to bottom, and endless blather about how you have to go for it, let it all hang out, etc.  There are a few nifty moments, especially when the summer mountain fades into the winter racecourse, but overall it lacks interest and could have been told in 10 minutes. Alas!",1453680000,,487,4.597701149425287
7420226,5,B014LWOLSE,Much better than I expected. Actual tension as to who is going to win this year drives the film forward. Really enjoyed it.,1453680000,,123,4.391304347826087
7420227,5,B014LWOLSE,There is no greater race in downhill!,1453680000,,37,4.428571428571429
7420228,5,B014LWOLSE,Shows you how tough this sport and these guys are. Well shot and documented. Will watch this over and over.,1453507200,,107,4.4
7420229,1,B014LWOLSE,This movie should have been awesome given the subject. It was terrible. It was cheesy. The skiing footage was insufficient. Perhaps the worst sports documentary I've ever seen.,1453420800,,176,5.321428571428571
7420230,3,B014LWOLSE,"A very interesting documentary regarding the annual skiing of the Streif, one of the deadliest downhill ski courses in the world. Weaving between captivating shots of the mountain, shots from previous year's competitions (complete with many terrible wipeouts), interviews with the skiers and the buildup for the current year's competition, the film tells the intriguing story of the Strief and it's many difficulties (and the crazy skiiers who put their lives in their hands to ski it).

I enjoyed the film, but did feel the running time was padded out a bit with too many interviews and awkward recreations of scenes between some of the main 'characters' of the film. Otherwise, an enjoyable film.",1453334400,,698,5.12280701754386
7420231,2,B014LWOLSE,"This movie had the potential to be incredible but the filmmakers got in the way.  The editor should have been fired and should never work on a flm again.  It's one of the most wildly over-edited documentaries I've ever seen.  There's hardly a shot in the entire film that last more than a second.  This stuff is so interesting and so compelling, and visuals are so stunning, that the filmmaker just has to get out of the way.  But they don't there is unnecessary slow-mo, cheesy music to add dramatic effect and other contrivances that made this movie really hard to sit through.  Don't even get me started on the sheer stupidity and and faux-artistic bullsh*t that happened at the end, with the guy balancing a feather on a stick . . .",1453248000,,736,4.496240601503759

7420233,4,B014LWOLSE,Subtitles were a bit quick and hard to stick with the whole theme. Needed a english Knowledgable person narrating,1453248000,,113,5.0
7420234,3,B014LWOLSE,What you need to know is the movie ends with a guy in a skirt balancing a feather on some sticks. The film takes a weird turn.,1453161600,2,126,3.7037037037037037
