8668908,4,B00LXK856M,"The Galinha Pintadinha songs are amongst the best produced and fun songs for kids. While they are in Portuguese, the music and catchy choruses are sure to stick in your head--English speakers don't worry! If you're a Spanish speaker, you will catch on to the lyrics very fast, so don't let the fact that it's in Portuguese hold you from purchasing.  The animation and theme are excellent. However, unlike the previous 3 titles there are a couple of references that one, particularly in the US, may find somewhat offensive: ""When the clock strikes three all the skeletons imitate chinese"" (the animation shows skeletons pulling their eyes)--that's why I gave it 4 and not 5 stars. Regardless, it is a very enjoyable disc.",1416096000,,720,4.901639344262295
