1189319,2,B000005XUU,"The Ugly American is one of those typical political dramas that falls short of what it hopes to accomplish.  Marlon Brando plays Harrison Carter McWhite, an American ambassador sent to the fictional southeastern Asian country of Sarkhan, where a political uproar has begun over an American project.  The project is the building of a road called Freedom Road, and the uproar is over the fact the natives of Sarkhan do not want it.  Enter McWhite to solve the problem.  And he brings a special talent to the table, he has been friends for years with the leader of the revolt, a revolutinary named Cheyung.  Unfortunately much time has passed and it seems McWhite no longer has any influence over Cheyung.  Tensions between them escalate, particullarly after McWhite discovers Cheyoung is in favor of a new communist government for Sarkhan.  Then disaster strikes at the grand opening of Freedom Road.  Cheyoung is responsible, but it is later discovered he is being used to start the revolt, only to be assasignated when it is through.  And thus the picture ends shortly after with the events ensueing.
This movie failed to gain the simpathetic feeling refected by it's tone.  The performances are on the whole pretty good, and Brando creates another interesting personality in McWhite.  However, good acting does not make a good movie, as is the case here.  George Englund's direction is poor and the film seems to hit and miss all over the place.
A decent film for Brando fans but seekers of political dramas will find this film does not deliver.",973814400,14,1546,4.881226053639847

1189324,5,B000005XUU,"The ""message"" of this movie was ""overtaken by events"" when Saigon fell in 1975--or was it?  Gen. Schwarzkopf may have believed that the first 'Gulf War,' Desert Storm, got America 'over' Viet Nam, but I would disagree.  IMO there is no more of a ""national consensus"" with regard to the Near/Middle East today than there was regarding Viet Nam in the Johnson and Nixon Administrations.  Part of the beauty of The Ugly American--i.e., the movie--is that that confusion comes through, right down to the anticlimactic closing scene.  I found the dialogues between the Brando character and his nationalist friend, and between Brando and the cynical prime minister of the Viet Nam surrogate country of Sarkan to be very well written--informative, and yet made to sound like real (and heated) exchanges of opinion that manage not to sound like canned lectures.

This is, again IMO, a rare instance of a movie being a vast improvement over the book.  The book by Lederer and Burdick was a series of short sketches portraying professional diplomats as a gaggle of clueless idiots and concluding that we should just turn some real down-home Americans loose on the Third World.  They would teach the benighted folks there how to grow better chickens, and everybody would love Uncle Sam.  Joseph Buttinger, a leading back-in-the-day scholar of Viet Nam, answered these 'cheap shots' in a short essay, which is today rather hard to find, but worth it--""Fact and Fiction of Foreign Aid,"" 51 pp.  Try Bookfinder.com; I think that's where I got my copy.

In fairness, Senator John F. Kennedy thought the book was great, but when he became President John F. Kennedy, I do believe that he began to see some complications.  Anyway, bottom line is that I think this movie is worth watching for the story and message, and as an artistic effort, as a film, I think that considering its age it holds up much better than a lot of films of comparable age.",1436745600,3,1930,4.835866261398176

In the book the imagery of both authors creates a stark landscape where a nation of people are torn between two powerful agencies (Communism and Capitalism) and the ensuing power struggle. The mix of characters from ignorant American politicians, sly Russian ""Reds"" and the resourceful folks who genuinely want to better the country and its people make the book easy and quick to read while thoroughly exciting the imagination. I am 21 years old and found this book to have great similarities to the problems faced in the Middle East based on culture differences, belief structures, and general society. Americans could learn a thing or two on diplomacy from this book written in the 1950's. The information both real and fiction presented throughout the pages of The Ugly American are still relevant to us 60 years after it was published.

1189338,3,B000005XUU,"Read the Book!!!  The book is such a rich allegory of the political events and missteps of the west that preceded the Vietnam War.  It correctly predicted what would happen politically if the U.S. and the other western powers did not stop their top down approach to helping Sarkhan (Vietnam)and instead focus on the bottom up approach taken by the Ugly American - the good guy in the story and it references his physical appearance, not his actions nor his intent.

The movie, although well acted and directed, loses the richness and subtlety of the book.  The movie does tell a good story and does encompass the spirit and some of the storyline of the book but it loses a lot of it once it gets to the screen.  The film was shot in Thailand and the events and storyline would lead the viewer to believe the allegory is supposed to illustrate the domestic political situation in Thailand which is not the case.

The movie is still worthwhile to watch but if you have not read the book do yourself a favor and get it immediately.",1262217600,2,1028,4.5
1189339,4,B000005XUU,"I have seen many films with Marlon Brando before, but never the ""Ugly American"".  I was thrilled to check it out from my local library.  Although this film was made many decades ago, it still rings true to the ways american foreign politics works today. Set in Southeast Asia it is a film about ordinary people's fight for decent life and local government desire for controlled roll out of the democracy.  Brando plays a journalist who reported on foreign affairs interested in pursuing diplomatic career in a country where he spent his youth.  15 years have passed and many things have changed in the country he once lived in.  His personal friendship with a local influential leader, fighter for democracy is still strong.  new ambassador hopes that their strong persoanl relationship will lead to resolving some of the political differneces they have for everyone's good.

It is amazing to see how their personal relationship influences the way they negotiate national intersts.  But can strong personal relationships improve the state of the nation? Can they continue on on where they left off 15 years ago?  What can a young ambassador learn from this experience and is it possible that his experiences as a diplomat will change the vision american people have on foreign politics?

I loved Brando in this role.  The costumes and glamor of long ago ambassadorship is a true gem of this film.  I also loved the wisdom and grace of the royals of the small country who in their own way love and cherish their nation and lead according to the customs so unique to their own culture.  This film is relevant to the events of today and I wish more people will see it.",1262217600,3,1665,4.7595818815331015

1189341,4,B000005XUU,"Marlon Brando starred in ""The Ugly American"", which despite its title was not liberal, but proved to be prescient. It was loosely based on the friendship developed between an American fighter pilot, shot down and fighting with guerillas, and Ho Chi Minh, who was fighting the Japanese during World War II. Marlon, the former pilot-turned-PR-executive, is named ambassador to a small Southeast Asian nation modeled on Indochina. The reason he is appointed is because of his friendship with a populist leader there who the U.S. fears may be a Communist. Brando assures them the man is not one, but when he gets there he discovers the man is. Their friendship turns into mortal enmity, and America's largesse, goodwill and social conscience are thrown back at us by savage mobs roiled by Marxist ideology. The final scene shows a press conference detailing the crisis, with a businessman changing the channel on his TV to show American indifference to the world's crises.

The politics of this story remain vital.
This concerns the situation in Vietnam just prior to America's full scale military involvement. South and North Vietnam are given aliases, yet it's clear where this story unfolds.

A modern ""Freedom Road' being constructed through the heart of ""Sarkan"" is seen by populist leader Deong (Eiji Okada) not as an effort at modernization, but as a route for the American military to use in overrunning his country. The project is sabotaged by Deong and his followers, and as Amabassador MacWhite arrives thousands flock to Deong's banner. The partisan's message of a small nation refusing to allow a great one to dominate it should be heeded today more than ever.

Watching this story from the distance of 45 years leaves one wishing LBJ had reconsidered his Domino theory and an incursion that was doomed to fail. Perhaps if he had, more recent actions might have also been given deeper thought before American troops were committed to again invade a sovereign nation and wage a war whose outcome at best would be stalemate.

There is a disclaimer on this version stating that although Thailand had just undergone a coup, this fictional country was not meant to be Thailand. Does that mean it was shot there and the Thai government requested the disclaimer? I do not remember it being on the US version but I saw that  one over 40 years ago. I could not place the location as Thailand since the vehicles were left, rather than right hand drive. No indication as to the shooting location that I could find. Any ideas?

Dated story and a simplistic Cold War Hollywood view. I read the book in the 50s and was impressed by it as I was by ""The Manchurian Candidate"".

The film had more impact on me in '59 when I saw it than it did yesterday. Still, not a bad performance by Brando and probably an accurate view of the simplistic view most Americans had about French Indo-China. Ironic that he went on to play Col Kurtz.

Brando stars opposite Eiji Okada who plays his old Sarkanese friend Deong, and herein lies one of the film's major problems. Okada's performance is limited. He does not appear convincing as the leader of his people, his fiendship with Brando appears lukewarm at best and he regularly stumbles over his lines. Brando puts in a quality performance, but this is not enough to stop the relationships between the characters from appearing somewhat forced.

The story itself is an interesting look at American foreign policy during the cold war, the ambiguous reasoning behind it and the reactions of those in the nations whom it effected.

The comparisons with Vietnam for the time are obvious.  The film also provides a study in classic US foriegn relations to 3rd World countries during the Cold War period.  US policy can be seen to be well meaning, but often mis-placed and heavy-handed.  The lessons to learn here are valuable, and all the more so today.  I consider this film a classic because not many pictures like this have ever been made.  If one considers how recent the whole Cold War McCarthy syndrome was as well its all the more remarkable.  Sure it has all the cliche touches of Hollywood films for that time, but there is still educational value for today from watching it.  History teachers should consider showing it to their students.

And although this movie is well-intentioned, the problem is that it offers too simplistic an account of US foreign affairs as they relate Asia. The poor direction, an inferior script, poor cinematography and coloration, generic looking setting, poor casting--and overall poor production sabatoged this film.  Brando gives a good performance, but the lack of chemistry between he and his supporting cast--especially the actor who played the character Deong--is evident.

I especially did not like the allusion to Julius Ceasar--a movie Brando had done years earlier.  I felt that it was a desperate act on the part of the writers to try to capitalize off of Brando's association with and the success of that movie.  Although I agree with many of the sentiments espoused by the character Deong--I was not moved by his performance, nor the movie in general--I was not made to feel the plight of the Sarkanese people--and I should have been--this is a major failure of this film and one reason why it fails and misses the mark.",1104364800,7,1119,5.059782608695652
1189347,4,B000005XUU,"The Ugly American was an interesting film when it first came out in 1963 but it seems even more fascinating now when viewed with the benefit of historical hindsight. A political drama with slight thriller overtones that tells the story of an over-confident and somewhat reckless American ambassador appointed to a volatile Southeast Asian country, circa 1960. The ambassador was appointed on the strength of his friendship with a local opposition leader - a man of the people. But things have changed since they last met. Good intentions, political posturing, and a dash of naive stupidity combine to plunge the country into revolution - and open the door to the communists. Of course, the US must send in troops...

The Vietnam allegory is obvious and somewhat enlightening, and the film remains remarkably pertinent today. It tries to step back to be objective, but doesn't always succeed - which is a kind of blessing. The film's final scene illustrates the danger of public apathy.

As the ambassador, Marlon Brando has seldom been better. The rest of the cast is solid and all the more believable for being largely unknown. The script is taut and incisive, the direction straightforward and unobtrusive. I just saw this film again for the first time in many years and was surprised by how good it still is - the sort of film that engages the mind as well as the emotions.",1093564800,13,1376,4.851063829787234

The two men have good chemistry even as their goals are conflicted.  Despite once being the closest of wartime friends, McWhite and Cheyoung now find themselves to be enemies.
This is obviously at least in part an allegory of American involvement in Vietnam and other Asian countries, a topic that was at the forefront of American politics when this movie was made.  Nonetheless, after watching the film recently after not seeing it for about 25 years, I found that it had lost none of its impact or relevance.

By William Springer

""The omission is the most powerful form of lie, and it is the duty of the historian to ensure that those lies
do not creep into the history books."" -George Orwell

I love Brando, and I like this movie. I'm giving it one star because it is guilty of lies of omission, as is the case with all State propaganda.

In the movie the U.S  Government supports a dictator in the fictional country of Sarkhan, in order ""to keep the free world free"".

What they don't tell you is that there is no ""free world"", and I'm not sure that there ever has been.
We have unverifiable elections.
We have politicians that are legally bribed before they ever get to office (""campaign contributuons"").
Our media, schools, and political representatives are owned by rich oligarchs that are able to use this control to create the illusion of freedom, in the "" free world"".
The science of logic hasn't been taught in State controlled public schools for more than a century (""The Underground History of American Education "" by John Gatto). And as a consequence, the masses can herded off to war like goats, with lies, whenever our controllers feel its necessary (""Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth).

Brando didn't want his children to become actors because he didn't consider it to be an honorable profession. I think he was right.",1515110400,,1367,4.722689075630252

The AIRPORT ARRIVAL scenes as Ambassador MacWhite speeds off in his 1957 Cadillac Fleetwood limousine are a CINEMATIC TRIUMPH alone !!!!!",1471132800,,336,4.810344827586207

7903550,4,B000005XUU,"The Ugly American is a film starring Marlon Brando as Ambassador Harrison Carter MacWhite and Eji Okada as Deong together with Sandra Church and Pat Hingle. The movie was based on book by Eugene Burdick and William Lederer of the same title. The novel became a bestseller, was influential at the time, and is still in print. The book is a quasi- roman  clef; that is, it presents, in a fictionalized guise, the experience of Americans in Southeast Asia (Vietnam) and allegedly portrays several real people who are represented by pseudonyms Its screenplay was written by Stewart Stern,and it was produced and directed by George Englund.

The political drama by George Englund has Harrison Carter MacWhite, an ambassador to a Southeast Asian country in a fictional nation called Sarkhan but stands in well for Vietnam. There is a growing movement against Yankee imperialism and the current government, increasing unrest, and other signs of a complex situation getting worse. At first the ambassador relies on past training and has his own facile explanations for the unfolding events. But as time goes by, he comes to learn that a revolutionary movement is not one-dimensional.

The movie was talky for most parts which makes it mundane. Also,the film does not clarify what it is message it is trying to convey about American presence in Southeast Asia. But nevertheless,the performances of Brando and Okada and their exchange of ideas and political beliefs does elevate it from being an average film.

The film,which was shown in 1963,could have painted a better picture of what things could have become in the future especially about Vietnam War. Apparently,the film did lack clarity on what it stood for about Communism and the American presence in Southeast Asia. Nevertheless,see this film for Brando's emotional and passionate performance alone.",1451088000,,1849,5.173913043478261
