I had to force myself to sit and watch this.  I could not believe the lies they were trying to passing on as truth.  This is a classic example of how people can be deceived and believe in lies.

Don't take my word for it do your own real research.  Not the hear say that has been passed on from person to person.",1377216000,27,419,3.9759036144578315

5667463,4,B00BQXTD4O,I watched it with an open mind and enjoyed it. Some historical details in the film do match with what I have read in books (written by Non Muslims) which to me shows that the writer/director did his/her homework. I would recommend it to anyone (Muslim/Non-Muslim) who wants to have a better understanding of the Islam .,1377129600,14,319,4.614035087719298

Distorts the twisted, murderous life of a megalomaniacal hate monger, oppressor of women and genocidal fiend whose teachings inspired the worst attack on American soil in the country's history."" The movie was released Aug. 20 by PBS, a U.S. government-subsidized corporation. ""I'm sure all the money the federal government put into an advertising campaign for this tripe helped propel it to the top,"" said Farah. ""But I doubt it will have any longevity.

5667467,5,B00BQXTD4O,I just watched this documentary on PBS and I must say that I love the fact that it contained actual facts. Not the junk that is played on mainstream news channels and its not tainted by opinions. I really do recommend watching this docu for anyone...even fellow Muslims.,1376956800,35,270,4.645833333333333
5667468,5,B00BQXTD4O,"I do not own this documentary yet, but I plan to own it. I saw it on PBS, and I learned a little bit about Islam while I was studying for my A.A. degree. But, this program takes what I learned to a new level, and it helped me to understand the mindset of how true Islam functions and is practiced in our world. I remember another documentary I saw on the Muslim perspective it was called, ""Control Room, "" but this documentary covered the war in Iraq from Al Jazeera perspective mostly. It was a great film in it's own right as well, very candid.
However, in the feature, ""Life of Muhammad,"" really pulls together a lot of the facts of the Islamic world, and debunks a lot of the myths spread by the Western world about Islam. It is less tainted politically than most programs you will see on this subject. I like it. I am a practicing Buddhist, and I found many qualities of hospitality toward all religions described within Muhammad's way of treating people. He accepted all peoples and he tried and succeed in non-violence. The documentary also shows why the modern terrorists use the Quran, and debunks their means as false to the original message of Muhammad. This documentary really is worth getting, not only for understanding another culture and their beliefs, but it helps us erase our fears and preconceived notions about Islam, and aide in world peace and respect for others.",1376956800,50,1386,4.592741935483871
5667509,5,B00BQXTD4O,"Very well done, it presents issues of concern, but leans toward presenting the perspective of an inquiring, curious believer. Not being Muslim myself, but being a person of religious faith, this method of presenting Muhammad's life was most appreciated. It is especially of no benefit to hear criticism of others' beliefs without first hearing the views of the faithful. How can you disagree with that which you don't first know? And much of the Islamic faith is worth agreeing with. Thank you PBS. You get two thumbs up from this guy.",1513987200,,535,4.8901098901098905

5667511,5,B00BQXTD4O,"Faris Kemranis documentary The Life of Muhammad is probably one of the best documentaries on the life of the prophet Muhammad out there. It gives one a comprehensive look into Muhammads life and teachings from a very balanced perspective. The director, Faris Kemrani, went out of his way to interview people of all different perspectives. Some of the interviewees defend Islam (e.g. Karen Armstrong, Tariq Ramadan, etc). Others, such as Robert Spencer or Ayaan Hirsi-Ali, are well known critics of Islam. Still others, such as John L. Esposito, Robert G. Hoyand, Gerald Hawting, etc offer a more objective perspective.

I am genuinely perplexed by the bad reviews which people have given to this documentary. I am shocked that some people see this documentary as apologetic, while others see this documentary as anti-Islamic, and others see this documentary as not comprehensive enough. Those who claim that it is too pro-Islamic clearly either skipped over or simply did not realize that some of the more controversial aspects of Muhammad and some of the more controversial events in his life are, in fact, addressed---most notably, the killing of the Banu Qurayza tribe in Medina. Those who claim that this movie is anti-Islamic clearly have not noticed how much the documentary focuses on all of the good things the prophet Muhammad had done for his followers, for Arabia, and for the history of the world. It is clear to me that many of the reviewers of this documentary---regardless of how they felt about Islam or Muhammad---already approached this documentary with their own opinions set in stone and could not stomach the fact that this documentary was OBJECTIVE and BALANCED, and could not deal with the fact that it was either not critical enough or not laudatory enough.
 Given this fact, I really would suggest that if anyone buys this documentary, one must approach it with an open mind, regardless of how one already feels about Islam, about Muslims, or about Muhammad specifically. If you approach this documentary with an open mind, you might actually learn something.
 Either way, I would HIGHLY recommend this documentary to anyone who is interested in Islam, or who is interested in religion or history more generally.",1512518400,,2237,5.08991825613079

Skirmishes occur and soon his new neighbors are drawn into the conflicts.

When he thinks his new neighbors are traitors he asks someone else for decision making assistance, after all, he is only a prophet, he does not actually know anything.

The narrator switched with ease when talking about Muhammad in the past and present. The title implies a story of the man and his times. If I wanted to see his impact on the present, I doubt a film this short could do it justice.
Asking for ""just the facts"" is never fair or easy when the object has such far reaching implications; especially related to faith, religion, and world events. As a documentary, I just wanted to see the man and his life, times, what shaped him and the impact he made on his world while he was alive.

Therefore, I do not consider this to be an objective documentary regarding Mohammad nor the muslim beliefs or foundation.

The controversy regarding Aisha, her age, marriage and consummation as well as the  massacre of the Banu Quarayza, after the Siege of the Trench were addressed but did not adequately deal with the ramifications, particularly from a moral or prophetic position.  Karen Armstrong is often used as well as several other fawning Islamic apologists, which was unfortunate.  Overall, the films are not bad.  A lot of information is put forth, much is glossed over and some is not.  It is good to watch to understand how those sympathetic to Mohammad, his life, tradition and religion deal with the grim realities of the Mohammaden past and hope to see a kinder Islam today.",1448928000,14,1060,5.051724137931035

It then puts the events of his life into a perspective that presents him as a man of peace and a prophet of the one true god.  This presentation achieves much in explaining the tolerant and peaceful side of Islam.  Even the brutality and seeming inconsistencies of Muhammad's life begin to make sense in this framework.  But this presentation fails to deal with the intolerance and bloody spread of Islam that began during his life and continues into our times.  His religion of peace produced no missionaries but only armies.  How did this peaceful man's godly words get so quickly twisted and why is the movement of Islam continuing toward domination, despotism, and medieval cruelty?

This documentary of three episodes at times was repetitive, but it gave me the desire to know more about Muhammad and the religion of Islam. I was inspired by his life and purpose. The loyalty to his family and followers was inspiring and his teachings touched me deeply. Muhammad's respect for other religions and people is what I have strived to accomplish in my life.

We are a poorly educated, self-absorbed and defiantly deluded nation that has very little capacity for understanding foreign cultures or learning history.
Since forces in our country have a desire for permanent war against Islam, it seems like a reasonable task to begin to explore what Islam is, who Mohamed was, and why the Jews and the Muslims have such an amazingly intertwined, twisted and pathological sibling rivalry.  Do most Americans know that Ishmael and Isaac are BROTHERS?  Born of Abraham.  Ishmael and his mother, Hagar were driven out of Abraham's favor by Sarah (who was 90 at the time she gave birth, by the way).

The information given by scholarly Muslims and non-affiliated religionists like Karen Armstrong has made me re-think my view of what Islam was intended to be, regardless of its misinterpretation by many today.",1436745600,14,768,4.7388059701492535

You'll see that if Islam was practiced by all Muslims according to the lessons of Muhammad - at least as those lessons are portrayed in this documentary - then the world would be a better off.  I truly do feel like I learned a lot.

But understand that this is absolutely a biased documentary.  I did get the impression that they wanted to be unbiased, and to their credit, they tried.  There is everything here that you need to know that makes great Islam, but very little about the faith's legitimate criticisms.  It paints the prophet in a very favorable light and merely scratches the surface of his more questionable acts.  I was looking for more information about Islam.  However, I constantly had to remind myself that this documentary is a bibliography of Muhammad and not and in-depth survey of the Muslim faith.

5667789,5,B00BQXTD4O,"I found this documentary to be very informative and interesting. This show primarily discusses the events in Muhammad's life that led to the development of his teachings. It's a refreshing view of the beginnings of Islam, while (to a lesser extent) also examining how his teachings have been interpreted by past and contemporary Muslims. Religion aside, Muhammad was a man who strove to improve the world in which he lived for himself and for others.

This program gives a historically accurate view of the life of Muhammad, and it does not shy away from the negative aspects that some may see in Islamic doctrine. Many of the events discussed in this show correlate with other university classes, peer-reviewed journal publications/books, and other outside research I have encountered previously. The narrator does a fantastic job at explaining the difference between Muhammad's teachings and sharia law (which was written and compiled after Muhammad's death). Additionally, I found it interesting that the narrator actually sat down with 2 Muslim men that discuss their reasoning for their extremist ""jihad-ist"" views. Immediately thereafter, the narrator makes it a point to explain that these views are largely condemned by the majority of Muslims.

Overall, this was a highly educational series that explains the roots of Islam, the historical context in which it began, and the man who brought it to be. Great for anyone who wants to understand what Islam really is, how and why people interpret it as they do (good and bad), and for all people who seek to look further than the popular Western image of Islam as a religion of war, murder, and untold atrocities.

5667847,1,B00BQXTD4O,"This is an Islamist propaganda piece that would impress Goebbels. It is a near perfect whitewash of a totalitarian ideology which masquerades as an ""Abrahamic religion."" It achieves its ends through a selective presentation of the facts as well as outright deception. It completely ignores Islam's triumphalist nature and that Islam, since the 7th century, has been spread through violent conquest and the brutal subjugation of the conquered populations. Islam's fundamentally violent nature is addressed only peripherally with a couple of references to contemporary out breaks of Muslim violence such as the bloody world-wide riots precipitated by a cartoon of Muhammad in a Danish newspaper. The documentary implies that Muslims are justified in resorting to violence anytime their religious sensibilities are offended.  Muhammad is presented, without any question, as an Abrahamic prophet, ignoring the almost complete disconnect between the theology of the Koran and that of the Judeo-Christian Bible. What this documentary exploits is the West's general ignorance of the Koran's barbaric contents and Islam's absolute intolerance of non Muslims, and its animus to freedom and democratic government. It also lies about the true status of women under Islam--it falsely claims that women share equality with men in all spheres when the direct opposite is the case. Women are third class citizens, behind camels, in Islamic societies. If I were to list all of the deceptions, omissions, and plain lies contained in this documentary, I'd need a book. Suffice to say, do not waste your time watching this propaganda piece if you want to learn anything of Islam's true nature. If, however, you are a student of propaganda, this piece rates right up there with Leni Riefenstahl's ""Triumph of the Will.""",1405382400,52,1799,5.402135231316726

It seems like a balanced presentation, as well. The narrator clearly has a passion for the subject matter, but historians' ""objective opinions"" are interspersed throughout, even when it appears the devout might object. This isn't to say the historians are necessarily critical of the message or religious Muslims - only that sometimes an outsider's opinions aren't as gentle or as warmly conveyed.",1403222400,,566,5.031914893617022

Biggest conundrum: a woman was a spectacular sponsor/protector of Mohammad in his formative years.  No explanation for the evolution (or lack thereof) of the traditional role of women in the present.  Production offers precious little connection between 7th and 21st century realities of Islam.  Rushdie and dress codes not enough.

5667923,2,B00BQXTD4O,"Very biased (favorably) in its portrayal of Islam. Glosses over pertinent topics that most people interested in this topic would want deeper clarification of, such as why a fatwa was issued against a Dutch cartoonist (failed to even mention that there was a fatwa), and what a fatwa is, and other 'tidbits' and intricacies of this religion that is calling worldwide attention to itself.",1392768000,6,386,5.046875
5667924,4,B00BQXTD4O,"As you may find from other reviewers, this is very well done film; it interviews intelligent and well informed scholars. They are not presenting opinions but using the Qu'ran to validate their statements. The film presents a very different view on the ""The Prophet,"" some may say ""sanitized,"" but the facts to stand on their own. The documentary does note where the evidence is sparce. The only point I find exception to is pointed out by another reviewer (who gave a ""1"") that the massacre of one of the Jewish groups settled in Medina violated the treatise which had been signed and that the Jews were going along with their valued system, which denounced robbery. According to the film, Mohammed didn't give the execution order but asked the group who they would select to impart judgement; so the issue is a bit muddled. You will have to see the documentary to draw your own conclusion. One of the interviewers asserts that Muhammed is one, of the top three, greatest leaders of all times; and the film shows how the radical Islam of suicide bombers and hateful Jihad, have nothing to do, and in fact and totally opposite to what the Qu'ran teaches, and how carried out his life by example, as is has been documented. Other than that, the film has beautiful photography and animations to illustrate the story.",1390694400,,1313,4.737991266375546

5667929,5,B00BQXTD4O,"Excellent PBS 3 Part, 3 hours total, documentary about Muhammad and Islam.  I watched this on TV when it first came out and decided I wanted a copy to share with family and friends.

I am retired 57 year old white, Catholic, born and raised in the U.S.  I did however work and live in the Middle East for 20 years.  I have an appreciation for the people, their culture and religion.  I find that many of my fellow Americans have very little real knowledge of the diverse people of that region or their predominate religion.

With family, friends and especially meeting new people when they learn my background, I am often engaged in discussion about these subjects.  This documentary explains Muhammad's life which is the basis/beginning of the modern Islamic religion.  I believe it give a good foundation for someone without much knowledge of the subject to understand it.

Conversely, I have also spoken with Muslims that have watch this and they too think it is an excellent documentary.  If you are reading this review you must be interested in the subject and thinking about plunking down $20 for this DVD.  I would highly recommend it.",1386460800,11,1142,4.746192893401015

5667932,1,B00BQXTD4O,"This is a spin of the life of Muhammad. Of the incidents that were told the beheading (all 800 fighters and made captives of the women and children) of a Jewish tribe in Medina is examined here. According to this film Muhammad made a mutual defense `treaty' with the Jews. Muhammad then picked fights with the tribes of Mecca by attacking and stealing from their caravans. Understand that the Jews had a moral code in which stealing was one of the top ten things not to do. Understandably after a period of time some of the Jews became disenchanted with this one sided `treaty'. The excuse given in this film for the beheading of these Jews is that the Jews told the Muslims that they should behead them and that this met the standards of the time. This does not really pass the sniff test. In the Bible God and his prophets met a higher standard than the mores of the time. There are other versions of this incident told in other sources that seem more likely. That there was no treaty, the beheading happened after a Muslim majority in Medina and was the first of many beheading of the infidels in Muslim majority areas.",1384128000,32,1122,4.478048780487805

I'll let that slide though, since the visuals are great and its made for TV for a general audience.

5667949,5,B00BQXTD4O,"I must say I liked the documentaries because it had brought together all different points of views from Christians, Jews, and Muslims. In this sense, it's very valid because all different scholars are accepting Muhammad's prophecy let alone they are questioning it! On the other hand, the narrator or author may be biased because he's muslim, but again he allowed different opinions to appear in his work, even the most hating person of the Prophet, Robert Spencer!

His ""religion"" spread not by persuasion but by conquest, force and murder.  As it still does.  Over 90% of all terrorism is Muslim.  The attributes of virtually all Islamic states, all Muslim-majority societies:  murder, oppression, bigotry, corruption and incompetence.  Hey, PBS/BBC, are those myths?

PBS/BBC aim, through distortion and deception, to paint the propagandist's picture of a fascist movement disguised as a religion.  Why?  Because the people of PBS/BBC have an agenda, a culturally and morally relativistic, left-wing outlook.
