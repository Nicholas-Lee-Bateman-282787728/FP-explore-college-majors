8486008,5,B005T8EM5W,"I have the whole set.  When i was a pre-schooler - i remember watching this strictly for the laughs (especially Ringo's antics)

Now - i bought them for all the great songs they perform.

These dvds had to be sent to Canada - I was completely surprised when they arrived so quickly.",1408579200,,282,4.384615384615385

8486010,5,B005T8EM5W,I purchased Vols. 2 &4 just to try them. I was very pleased with both of them. I will be purchasing the other volumes to add to my collection. If you're a Beatles fan you have to have these. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!,1359504000,,208,3.9761904761904763
8486011,2,B005T8EM5W,"If you are a real Beatles fan, you didn't begin to like them when you were forty or fifty, you had to be in your teenage to fall for them so could accumulate the affection and remain a Beatles fan today. That was why I bought these dvds of The Beatles Cartoon Shows vol. 1, 2 and 3, with expectation of bringing back some memeories long forgotten in my young age. On receipt of the package, I watched a few episodes of vol. 1 and honestly, the quality of the video is not to be praised, after all, they were cartoons from the era of '60s. But who would mind? Passion is priceless, if you feel happy watching them with The Beatles original tunes, there you are!
While these videos have their value, however, I'm not comfortable with the charges for the shipping and handling from this ACME TV!! The total of the 3 dvds is $38.93 with vol. 1 being $8.99 but the shipping charges is $36.87 for one single parcel!!! As I required only standard shipping mode so the package didn't come any faster. I was thinking to order the vol. 4 and 5 but I wouldn't if the shipping charge is such high. I think the resonable charge should be $17-18.00 with 3 items consolidated in 1 shipping. I hope ACME TV would consider that and I wouldn't mind if they refund me half of the shipping charges.

8486012,5,B005T8EM5W,"Their back and so am I, i'm talking about those fab four in cartoon form. Just finish a review on vol. 1 which blew my mind and you didn't think it can get better!!!!!!! Well it just did. First look up this vol. 2 on amazon now click and look what you get before you buy it. Look at the artwork on the dvd case, now look at the picture of john on the disc vol. 1. Now look at the picture of ringo and his drums on the disc vol. 2. By the looks of it this guy put alot of workmenship it that in it self. With this vol. 2 you get ten more shows and with the vol. 1 that will make it a total of 16 shows. In the whole set there are 39 in total of the beatles cartoon shows. The colors are vibrant and the sounds are so clear and crisp for these cartoon that is almost a half decade old. Well I have to go because i'm missing the sing alongs, so sit back and enjoy the show. I can't wait for vol. 3 and see what he has up his sleevse for the next addition of these great cartoons. MR. DRUMMER.",1318377600,4,989,3.736842105263158
