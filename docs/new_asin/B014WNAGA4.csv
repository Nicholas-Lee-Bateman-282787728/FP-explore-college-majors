7425191,5,B014WNAGA4,"I have always loved Jane and her videos. Now that I am older I want a less frenzied workout and her Prime Time Workout is just the thing. It works your whole body. It works your ankles, hands, wrists, hips and helps to get them more flexible. I really feel the difference in my joints after doing it for just two weeks now.",1454889600,2,323,4.142857142857143

7425195,5,B014WNAGA4,"I've been looking for an all over exercise program that wouldn't kill me. I've been looking for the Jane Fonda aerobics, because that's what I did when I was younger, and was excited to see this boxed set. I am so glad I bought it. I have tried those newer types of workouts such as Insanity and they weren't for me. Good old fashioned aerobics provides the perfect workout for me.",1452038400,22,381,4.380281690140845

7425197,5,B014WNAGA4,"My first Jane Fonda workout was in 1984 and consisted of a full color hardback book and cassette tape.  Jane Fonda's Workout for Pregnancy, Birth and Recovery.  I credited this workout as partially responsible for the ease of my labor and childbirth experience as well as the remarkable recovery.  In 1985 I got the video Jane Fonda's New Workout and I was a hot new mom rocking leotards and leg warmers!  The baby's first belly laugh came from watching me and my best friend Tracy do jumping jacks.  The tapes wore out, the 80s were over, and sadly my home workouts ended. For almost 30 years I've remembered them fondly and wished I still had them.  When my now 32 year old ""baby"" told me the workouts she remembered me doing throughout her childhood were now available on DVD it was a great and happy day.  Ordered them immediately, set up a home workout area and this 50-something, stiff jointed, overweight Mimi is now making the grandkids belly laugh.  And making myself laugh each day with how much better I feel. Muscle memory is real!  And flexibility is returning.  Thank you for bringing these back and in a format I can use!",1499299200,4,1136,4.579207920792079

7425202,5,B014WNAGA4,"Fantastic DVD collection set!!! It arrived earlier than expected and in exceptional condition! Brand new!!! In just 6 weeks, I've already lost 4 inches of body fat and am starting to see real results and I'm a 37 year old man! Ms. Fonda had conducted extensive research on physical fitness and exercise and it really comes thru on these dvd's! The beginners workout will have you feeling the burn for weeks! I highly recommend this set to anyone of any age or gender. I do this in the privacy of my home and I couldn't be happier! I'm on my way to a healthier, fitter and very best version of myself! Don't hesitate on buying this set! BUY IT, It really works and this is the first workout DVD I've ever bought or done!!! My advice is to start with one DVD and do the beginners exercise only for 2-3 weeks before moving on to the advanced level. Then move on to another DVD and do the same! A very big thank you to the amazing Jane Fonda! You have inspired me for most of my life with your extraordinary films, your exceptional autobiography: My Life So Far (which one must get on audiobook to feel it's full power) which has changed my life and left an indelible impression on my soul forever, Grace & Frankie and now these Workout dvds! You're an extraordinary and fully evolved human being! Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!!!!",1488067200,5,1329,4.428571428571429

Regarding the workouts, I remember doing the original workout in 1982 with my mother and sisters which brings back that time when my family and I just enjoyed a good workout together. Fast forward to 2018, I love revisiting this workout, the music, leg warmers and stripped purple leotard just make me smile :). I love you Jane!  Regarding results, I love how the workouts is gentle on my joints, as a former gym rat, I was over feeling sore and tight every morning. Jane Fonda's workout are the complete opposite of feeling tight and reaching for an Advil or two the morning after an intense workout. She leaves you feeling stretched and ready for your day. Once of my favorite section of the workout is the waist exercises. It's  unbelievable on how it's shrinking the side of my waist. The hips and thigh section have shrunk my hips and lifted my butt.- full disclosure, they are not easy but worth it! Enjoy!",1522195200,,1086,4.474747474747475
