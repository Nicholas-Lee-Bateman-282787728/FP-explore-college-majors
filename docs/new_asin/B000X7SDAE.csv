2998769,4,B000X7SDAE,"Sleeping Tiger was the first movie directed by Joseph Losey in the UK after he fled the US because of the Blacklist. (Losey's participation was anonymous; the opening credits list the director as Victor Hanbury. Why Amazon Instant lists the director as Sergio Martino is anyone's guess!)

This movie also marks the first collaboration of Losey and actor Dirk Bogarde; their later work together would produce some of the best movies of the 1960s.

Psychologist Alexander Knox (who became another Losey stock actor), after foiling an attack on him by a young thug (Bogarde), takes the younger man home to perform an experiment in rehabilitation; things gets complicated when sparks fly between Bogarde and the psychologist's repressed wife, played by Alexis Smith. (Bogarde, in his early thirties but convincingly playing much younger, is extraordinarily charismatic here, and his scenes with Smith are highly erotic.)

Like many movies from the 1950s, Sleeping Tiger states its psychological rationalizations a bit too blatantly, but as this fascinating sexual triangle becomes increasingly complicated, the movie hurtles toward a powerful climax. In the end, which of these three characters will unleash the most savage ""sleeping tiger""?

The print streaming here has a few missing frames and occasionally shakes a bit, but overall quality was acceptable for this picky viewer. For the Losey fan, an absolute must. For others, a worthwhile noir excursion starring one of the world's best actors in his youthful prime.",1304294400,5,1517,5.361344537815126

2998771,1,B000X7SDAE,"I don't know how Alpha Home Entertainment could possibly release this DVD....they should be ashamed. Believe me, it's not the film that I dislike - I have it on a VHS copy and have viewed it numerous times - but the fact that they can release a DVD with a picture quality so disgustingly poor, I thought I would need eye glasses by the end of the movie. It may be in black and white but the colour is so faded and the scratched and semi-blurry picture quality so annoying, that I definitely recommend that no one purchases this DVD. I was hesitant in purchasing it in the first place as I've read bad reviews in regards to DVD's released by Alpha but, as I'm a huge Dirk Bogarde fan, I went ahead and stupidly made this purchase. Be warned - don't buy this DVD! (I have since acquired the ""Dirk Bogarde Screen Icons Collection"" and the film quality of The Sleeping Tiger in this collection is excellent in comparison to Alpha's atrocious release....give Alpha the flick and purchase this seven film collection instead....available at Amazon.co.uk).",1219363200,28,1048,4.639784946236559

8227177,4,B000X7SDAE,"This under-the-radar drawing room melo-/psychodrama with a heavy noir overlay really hits the mark. A young criminal (Dirk Bogarde) is taken under the wings of a well-intentioned psychiatrist (Alexander Knox), who allows the criminal to live in his house as he tries to reform him.  Alas, the Bogarde character takes a shine to the doctors sexy wife (Alexis Smith), and she returns the sentiment. Events progress rather predictably, and not altogether happily. The Smith character is self-conscious about her older woman status vis--vis the young turk Bogarde. (Actually Bogarde was a few months older than Smith). But no matter. The age discrepancy illusion works well and is convincing  maybe its Miss Smiths wardrobe and her close cropped hair that sells the age difference thing.

Bogarde and Knox give their usual solid performances, especially Bogarde in a quintessentially Dirk Bogarde-ish role as a caddish charmer, but its really Alexis Smiths film. Shes well-cast as the bored, bland wife with a smoldering undercurrent, hence shes the sleeping tiger (tigress?) of the films title. Her performance walks a fine line between scenery chewing and understatement, depending on the situation, and Id rate it as very possibly her best hour as a film actress.

Other pluses include Malcolm Arnolds score which alternates between neurotic symphonic and smoky jazzy, which brings to mind another cool bonus: a  couple of frenetic scenes at a jazz club which ring true. Ive discovered far too few Brit noirs but after viewing this one it makes me want to see more. A solid four stars.",1525564800,,1584,5.171875

8227182,3,B000X7SDAE,"Joseph Losey came from the same Wisconsin roots that produced Nicholas Ray, Howard Hawks and Orson Welles and his films speak with a singular rhythmic pulse and a clinical intellectual detachment. They command our respect more than they entertain as pure cinema, and Losey's ""highbrow"" creds are already evident in this first of his British films-in-exile, intelligently scripted by fellow blacklist martyrs and everyone working pseudonymously to protect the Hollywood employability of stars Smith and Knox.

Alexander Knox, like Dirk Bogarde, became a Losey regular, and SLEEPING TIGER certainly prefigures the more complex and serious Bogarde-Losey-Pinter projects that followed. This film's triangle--an extension of the lopsided steamier one in Losey's great American noir THE PROWLER--had its sensationalist melodramatic possibilities, with the hormonally frustrated Smith married to experimental psychoanalyst Knox but tempted into infidelity with intrusive houseguest Bogarde, a superannuated but supposedly curable juvenile delinquent. So too there was a barely developed class distinction between the professional and moneyed Smith-Knox couple and the common delinquent Bogarde, their resident guinea pig passively subject to their mind-games.

Losey sensibly downplays the sensationalism until Smith's final, bravura, melodramatic meltdown and for the most part civilized but prickly behaviors prevail, with some nervous tension generated en route: Smith, channeling the dominatrix Dominique in Vidor's THE FOUNTAINHEAD, is an expert equestrienne, handy with the riding crop, and Bogarde's in-house conversion therapy will involve intimate curative rides with Smith even as he persists in clandestine, criminally immature hooliganism. The social classes meet interestingly when Bogarde bids Smith join him at Soho's louche Metro Club in a ""cheaper dress,"" and it's worth noting that Knox' obliviously cuckolded character already has his own mistress, a live-in research associate played suggestively, and all too briefly, by Maxine Audley. Hugh Griffith pops up as an incredibly tolerant suburban copper, and look for Billie Whitelaw as the tart-tongued and very busty victim of Bogarde's daring daylight robbery.

Alexis Smith, hitherto squandered in Warners programmers, really excels in a difficult role, and I appreciate Knox' calm and quiet underplaying. Bogarde, a thoroughly unsympathetic sociopath here, seems more assured in his later Losey films, but this was an important step in advancing him towards the serious films of his mature career. England changed Losey, and his filmmaking philosophy, and SLEEPING TIGER is an especially intriguing transitional work between the noir intensity of THE PROWLER and the more detached asceticism and formal ""donnishness"" of ACCIDENT, THE SERVANT or KING AND COUNTRY.",1470441600,,2827,5.958128078817734
