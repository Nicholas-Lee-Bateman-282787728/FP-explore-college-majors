8588623,2,B00D2TY2AU,This anime series is very good but I just can't understand why Amazon is allowing these people or seller's to rack up the price so high where no one can afford it it's obvious no one's going to buy this anime at these high original prices get a clue.,1510704000,,250,4.122448979591836

8588627,2,B00D2TY2AU,"This is NOT the entire series, only the last eight of the 16 episodes. The first eight episodes are sold in a separate DVD set that is currently unavailable on Amazon (I did find it elsewhere).",1410480000,13,193,4.388888888888889
8588628,3,B00D2TY2AU,"I watched it on huluplus. I didn't have any trouble keeping up with the English subtitles. Except for the day dreaming scenes, I liked the Korean version, ""Playful Kiss"", better. For the male star, I kept thinking of a young Neil Patrick Harris playing Doogie Howser, M.D. The dream scenes were not as obnoxious, long and boring as they were in the Korean version. The mother in this Japanese version seemed ridiculous and silly, but very natural in the Korean version.  I liked seeing the differences, what was cut out and added. The other thing I liked was in this Japanese version, the gaps in time were explained, whereas in the Korean version, it made me guess and I didn't catch it right away. Because they didn't explain the time laps, it was confusing at times.",1407369600,4,769,4.654411764705882
