262074,5,6300215970,"This movie is one to put on your list.  A comedy of the old west where greed, corruption and lawlessness run rampant!  James Coburn who is out to get whatever he can including a maiden's virtues is fantastic in this part.  Carrol O'Connor as a wayward sheriff who's more concern for his pocket rather than the law is great as well as Bruce Dern who's at his typical not quite all their best!  Roger Miller's music throughout this morality play gone wrong makes this film.  This needs to be on DVD!",1068940800,31,497,4.417582417582418
262075,5,6300215970,"I heard the Roger Miller soundtrack first and then I HAD to see the movie!  It didn't dissapoint.  James Coburn, Carol O'Connor, stolen gold, Hilb the ""frontier delinquent"" (Roger Miller's term), a wronged damsel, rank discrimination (""arrest the foreigner"") and the not quite good girl winning it all in the end.  Want more?  How about James Coburn called out into the street for a gunfight - which he wins by shooting his challenger with the challenger's own rifle, from behind the challenger's own horse?",1037750400,8,507,5.0

262251,5,6300215970,"So many movies fail to age well. The audience moves on, political correctness changes, society develops different feelings about just about everything, and the movies become pass&eacute;, bland, insipid, stupid. Not so for Waterhole #3. James Coburn leads a wonderful cast of characters which include Carroll O'Connor as the sheriff, Bruce Dern as his deputy, and Claude Akins as one of the bad guys. Coburn is a gambler who finds a map written on the back of a twenty dollar bill and heads straight for the gold, with one hilarious incident after another in the way, and more funny one-liners than a standup comedian could deliver in a fortnight. All led on by Roger Miller singing a ballad between scenes. Beats me why the ballad didn't become a number one hit. Two great thumbs up!!!",1389571200,4,786,4.82962962962963

Even most of the amazon.com reviewers liked it.  What a mistake! This is one of the most ""going nowhere"" plots of ANY film we have ever watched.  There is absolutely no character development, which is a shame because Coburn's and O'Conner's characters could have been outstanding. Even the score by Roger Miller didn't work well.  It struck us that it was trying to be another ""Cat Ballou,"" but just didn't make it.

262382,4,6300215970,"There is a scene where the con-man (James Coburn) does the card version of the shell game to perfection just before going out to do a gunfight. He throws off the scene in such a manner that you can't help but laugh. The gunfight is classic as well. Afterwards, he obtains information concerning a treasure that is placed in the vicinity of waterhole number 3. By the time he gets to the town on the way to the waterholes, he needs a new horse. So he talks to the Sheriff and his Deputy (Caroll O'Connor and Bruce Dern) about the location of a good horse. It just happens that the best horse is the Sheriff's and is not for sale. The con-man, not to be slowed down at all, locks the Sheriff and the Deputy in their own jail and gives them an incentive to keep quite about it. When he gets caught in the barn with the horse (and his pants around his ankles) by the Sheriff's daughter (Margaret Blye), he takes a little time to get to know her. The Sheriff upon finding that his horse is gone is heartbroken, but learns from his daughter that the con-man has gone into the desert. For their own reasons, both the Sheriff and his daughter are intent on tracking the con-man down. General mayhem ensues and when the dust settles, the con-man is left with having to make a decision about his priorities. Once the decision is made and he acts on it, the only thing left is to roll the credits, stop the film and realize that you have enjoyed the roller coaster ride for the last couple of hours (no heavy lifting required). Honorable mention goes to Joan Blondell, Claude Aikens and James Whitmore for fun moments in the film as well. Over all, it's a well paced, fun romp.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waterhole-3/dp/B0007Y08K6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waterhole #3</a>",1260921600,7,1805,4.715189873417722

It's not a bad movie, it's just not a good movie. Coburn is certainly likable as is O'Connor. Margaret Blye is definitely eye candy. But I found the Roger Miller song interjections to be intrusive, distracting & padding. This is a relic of its era; simply Hollywood making the Western irreverent & irrelevant. James Coburn is NOT James Garner who was very successful at doing this. The quality of the DVD is very good but there aren't any extras or bonus features.",1195516800,2,630,4.3931623931623935

262442,4,6300215970,"James Coburn plays a stereotypical bad guy in this movie about a western gold robbery. Challenged in a bar to a gunfight at sundown, he walks out into the street but instead of the classical walk toward the other gunfighter, he walks around to the other side of his horse, takes the rifle out of the scabbard, sites across the saddle and shoots the gunfighter from a distance.  From the body of the victim, he takes a map to stolen gold and the fun begins.  The movie is actually set in a lighthearted vein, with occasional crosses into the dark side. Coburn wants the sheriff's horse, so he locks the sheriff into his own jail with no clothes and proceeds to the sheriff's place to steal the horse.  This movie never heard of politically correct.  The sheriff wants the gold as much as Coburn and of course there is the sheriff's daughter, who is no sure what she wants.  In the background, the soundtrack has a song which talks about the ""code of the west"" even as every body in the movie violates it.  I gave the movie 4 stars not 5, because it is not one of the greats, the plot is kind of shallow and the acting a little wooden at times, but it is a fun show.",1156550400,12,1164,4.2681818181818185

262444,5,6300215970,"This 1967 film is a comedy remake of ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"".  An Army gold bullion shipment is stolen.  Sneaky gambler Lewton Cole (James Coburn -- ""Our Man Flint"") discovers a map and nearly gets shot for his discovery.  Cole curiously follows the map.  Sheriff Honest John Copperod (Carroll O'Connor -- ""All In The Family"") follows Cole seeking revenge after Cole locks Honest John naked into his own cell and steals Honest John's horse.  Honest John's beautiful daughter Billie follows Cole seeking satisfaction after a romp in the hay.
Confusion follows with Cole and Honest John, Billie, the original thieves and an Army cavalry troop running in circles seeking the gold.  Throughout the confusion Roger Miller vocals laud 'The Code Of The West' -- a nebulous and flexible code that bends to fit any situation.
""Waterhole #3"" showcases the (IMO unexpected) worldly chemistry between James Coburn and Carroll O'Connor.  But I do not consider ""Waterhole #3"" to be 'a man's film'.  ""Waterhole #3"" also depicts larceny and satisfaction -- IMO both gender-neutral motivators.",1080172800,9,1085,5.125

Roger Miller makes the movie with his tunes and ""Do unto others before they do it unto you.""

Here is your chance (icky) to see Bruce Dern and Carroll O'Connor naked together. After Roger Miller's singing, I think Lewton Cole's (James Colburn) amorality is what makes the movie. Be sure to look for FiFi LaFlame

Several stories overlap and interweave. MSgt. Henry J. Foggers (Claude Akins) is left alone in charge of the army's gold while the rest of the army is in war games. He was a few acquaintances including a shoemaker deposit the gold in a safer place.

Lewton Cole is a cheap not so scruples gambler who find a map on a 20-dollar bill. Will it cost him his life? We also see gunfights, houses of ill repute, jails, bandits, and some very fine horses.

We are left with a question of ""Do we value gold too much?""",1500940800,,981,4.403314917127072
