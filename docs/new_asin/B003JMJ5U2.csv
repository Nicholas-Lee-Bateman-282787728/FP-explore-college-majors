8398329,2,B003JMJ5U2,I bought it thinking on an Erotic Movie which is not.  Not so good story but it was interesting it to watch.,1298678400,2,108,3.909090909090909
8398330,2,B003JMJ5U2,"WHO do we blame for grossly misrepresenting this film as something it's not??? Look at the box cover - enticingly erotic, right? Check out the title as you peer at the cover - it says ""sign me up"", doesn't it? Read the synopsis - this is gonna be one helluva exploitation flick, isn't it? AND it won awards, so it's gonna be an Art House Exploitation classic, right? And, on top of it all, Amazon has it paired up with two incredible Art House Sexploitation flicks of the highest calibre (read my reviews of both films for additional details and insight), so HOW can you go wrong??? Oh, let me count the ways...

Well, my friends, NONE of those elements we touched upon have a blessed thing to do with the movie itself, much to the chagrin of 95% of those who purchase this flick. This is one of countless low budget, shot on video and released direct to DVD films that appeal to a handful of pompous juries at questionable film festivals that are utilized to brand the packaging of films folks would otherwise have no interest in, and usually rightfully so. The acting's nothing special, neither is the story (other than to delude us into thinking based on the box cover deceit that we're gonna be entrenched in sexual mayhem, nudity, exploitation and solicitation), a non-existent budget, questionable directorial skills and amateurish acting experience, etc., etc. What we're actually viewing is a damned soap opera about a woman with a kid who works in the sex industry (now how rare is THAT in today's world?) but has principles that go way beyond the bar she has established for herself, yet holds others accountable for moralistic ideals she herself can't live up to. Yeesch. I could forgive all the deceit mentioned IF the flick was special in any significant way, but guess again...

By all means, do pick up 'Diary of a Nymphomaniac' if you want to see a transcendent art house slice of high-class exploitation that has both a heart and a soul, a solid story, a budget and great acting, and grab yourself a copy of 'Monamour' if you're into envelope-pushing sexploitation, flagrant nudity and eroticism ala Tinto Brass (again, read my reviews for details), but avoid this flick unless you're a delusional critic who sees artful things in dung heaps. This is one step away from a Lifetime movie... And blame EVERYONE for the gross, negligent, shameless promotion of this dog and pony show...",1287792000,31,2400,4.739234449760765
8398331,3,B003JMJ5U2,"Look at that box cover.  Stimulating, isn't it?  Evocative?  Seductive, even.  Now shut it out of your mind because it has little to nothing to do with the subject matter.  Remember this before you build up any expectations: Carmen is a woman who works in the sex industry, but you won't get to see her in her ""work clothes"".  The only time the film shows anything approaching the eroticism of the cover is when Carmen is getting *partially* undressed to get into bed with her boyfriend, chastely.  To repeat, the star of the movie, Jace Nicole, does not get naked in this film.

This is the dramatic story of a woman who works in what she knows is often a socially unacceptable field.  As well, she has a young daughter she only gets to see when the daughter's caretaker (an ex-boyfriend?) allows her to.  It's the story of her trials and tribulations trying to find love and acceptance.

The acting is pretty much what you'd expect from an independent film with a fairly low budget.  Nobody really hams it up, but you will see overly dramatic gestures, lines spoken in a regular, even tone and pacing when the character's supposed to be agitated, that sort of thing.  The New York location worked well, though.

Overall, it's an OK drama.  The picture is good-quality, though obviously direct-to-video style.  The sound is clear, for the most part.  The story is kind of trite, however, and its theme of trust and being who you are are not as well-presented as they ought to be in such a straightforward movie.  The theme of this movie is trust, expectations, and the judgment of others.  Her trust in others is broken, but many times that's because she deceives them because she doesn't want to face their judgment of her lifestyle and career choices.  I don't expect everything to be laid out in front of me in plain form, but this comes off as a bit garbled, to me.  Still, as I said, an OK dramatic story, but understand that the erotic implications of the cover are sorely lacking.

*** Spoilers Below ***

Carmen works in the sex industry.  When the movie opens, she's working on a parody of the Bangbus movies.  They don't show any bit of skin (but Jace Nicole definitely looks good throughout this movie), and just the beginning of a very sleazy pickup line.  Ah, I like where this is going! *blam* End scene.  At that point, we discover that she's leaving whatever company she's working with to work for herself with a pay site.

From there, we jump into the actual topic of the movie.  The guy she's been going out with for three weeks decides it's time to move things to ""the next level"", which naturally means sex (and using a hidden camcorder to record the session).  She doesn't want to move that fast, though, and discovers his deception.  A period of depression and weepy-time with her porn star female friend (no sexing between them, of course) ensues.  Naturally, after some on-screen thinking and life-evaluation, she finds another dude, but she lies about her profession; he's a moral, fairly religious Christian dude who isn't 100% uptight, but she knows he'd be put off by her porn site.  So she doesn't tell him...until she has to tell him, and he's understandably shocked and hurt that she concealed it from him.  She sits around for a couple of questions, but when she thinks that he's judging her profession, she walks out on him.  Personally, I think that was pretty weak on her part; she dropped this bomb on him and then got insulted when he didn't accept it within a 5-minute conversation.  Anyway, it closes with her spending time with her daughter.  Not exactly a happy ending, but it did depict the messiness of life fairly well.",1287014400,66,3664,4.633540372670807

8398333,5,B003JMJ5U2,"I saw this film at a film festival screening and am glad to see it for sale here.  This film is the best I've seen in years and the actors bring the story to life, especially Jace Nicole who plays Carmen.

Carmen is a young woman who works as a web cam girl but this film is not about the web cam industry.  It is about her search for a man who can love and accept her for who she is without treating her like a sex toy.  The director does not follow the traditional Hollywood route, instead opting for a realistic and honest portrayal sorely lacking in big budget films.

See this movie.  You will not regret it.",1275264000,4,613,4.109243697478991
