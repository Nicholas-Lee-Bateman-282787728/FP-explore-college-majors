8227135,2,B000X7SDTA,"I usually try to cut ALPHA dvds some slack because they deal with hard to find films and present them to the the consumer with great packaging at a very low cost. However, their version of THE WAY OF THE WEST starring Wally (my favorite) Wales is quite frankly, horrible. I knew I was in trouble when the opening credit photo shots of the cast began with the henchmen, leaving out the main characters! Jumpy, splicy, blurry, fuzzy, dark. VCI has this in their current catalog, complete and uncut with a Buddy Roosevelt second feature which is also in great shape. The VCI dvd is the one to buy here. Both features are clean, sharp, and bargain priced! ALPHA could have/should have come up with a better print, they're out there...By the way, did I mention how I loved the packaging, a great old poster shot of Wally duking it out with William Desmond...if only ALPHA would have searched as hard for a nice clean print of this movie as they did for the great packaging!",1292976000,,968,4.505681818181818
8227136,1,B000X7SDTA,Warning- this movie constantly jumps and sputters all over the place and is un-watchable. It's a shame for it is a nice copy but because of the constant jumping I couldn't finish it and threw it away.,1278460800,,200,4.4324324324324325
