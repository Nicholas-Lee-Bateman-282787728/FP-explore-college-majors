I saw youth soccer coaches on the field (who have coached multiple times before) that were really making bad decisions and I thought to myself they really need this video and Dean's perspective.

Are you suddenly a first-time youth soccer coach because the league sent out a request asking parents to step up because they were short on coaches for your child's youth soccer league, and you took on the challenge because you want to make a difference in your son or daughter's life, but now realize you have no idea what you're doing because you never coached soccer before (or perhaps never coached anything before)?

THEN BUY THIS DVD NOW!

This was me last year and I'm telling you, this guy (Dean Jacobs) is an absolute professional; and he has a way to simplify and demystify coaching youth soccer.  I essentially emulated his style until I developed my own and our season (U8 boys) was an absolute success!

I also bought (and highly recommend) ""The Baffled Parents Guide to Coaching Youth Soccer"" by Bobby Clark. I wasn't trying to reinvent the wheel, I just wanted instruction and how to, and I wanted it ASAP!  Get those 2 products I suggested and dive into them immediately and you'll do just fine.  That book and the DVD is all you'll need.",1326844800,3,1335,4.60337552742616

I have a 10 year old daughter who loves soccer and I spent some time online looking for good lessons for her and I can't say enough about this series of DVDs. They are incredibly well done, very thorough and packed with more stuff than I could have hoped for. All the material is displayed very professionally and easy to find. Simple Soccer is simply awesome. Highly recommended !",1183334400,,440,4.5
