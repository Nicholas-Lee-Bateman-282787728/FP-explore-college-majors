4081428,3,B0037MACJC,"[2.5 ~ Campy Bad/Good.] This movie is so bad that it's good, and what saves it from being unwatchable is that it doesn't take itself seriously. As a campy horror comedy about an apartment house haunted by a family of Ghouls & Devil-Worshipers, as well as fully human slaves bonded since childhood, all held in the thrall of a very powerful Demon and her less powerful male sidekick, it has plenty of jarring (and very gross) examples of truly good humans (including a virtuous and brave Mistress of White Magick) being summarily annihilated, all except the few who get away: I won't say who. The special effects are almost cheap enough to be done on a smartphone camera! But the crew and performers all worked hard and it's a fun watch - once. Added bonus: there's some decent original music, soundtrack available as well. Get some lager in and watch it with your besties. Mind, there is a bit of a ""puke factor,"" though. There are some very gross scenes.",1415577600,,955,4.623529411764705

4081431,2,B0037MACJC,I usually like campy movies but this one was just plain stupid.  I would not recommend this at all. Very bad,1374883200,3,108,4.142857142857143

4081433,3,B0037MACJC,"I had expected The Landlord to be scary, and in many ways it is.  It is also rather campy.
I had never thought a bunch of demons to be so funny and in many ways stupid.  And that goes for the landlord himself as well.",1280793600,2,217,3.8
4081434,4,B0037MACJC,"I enjoyed this film, I picked it up last year in 2009 at a horror con in Chicago from the filmmakers. I feel that it is not meant to be true horror film but rather a horror comedy type of flick. The main character in the film is rather funny from the way he does things. Some dude has these demonic things living in one of his apartments that he has somewhat became buddies with. The demonic creatures kills the tenets before the owner can collect the months payment...I like it when the cops come to investigate as they are just waiting for the landlord to slip up and make a mistake...the landlord always gets stuck cleaning up the mess that the demons leave behind (most of the time). I would recommend this film as I have seen nothing like it before.",1272067200,5,754,4.316901408450704
4081435,4,B0037MACJC,"Too many low-budget films are too ambitious for their own good.  What's wrong with making a genuinely entertaining film on the budget you have to work with?  The makers of ""The Landlord"" clearly had this in mind, and the result is a low-budget film that almost completely avoids most of the pitfalls that detract from the entertainment value of many low-budget films regardless of genre.  Lead actor Derek Dziak is excellent and endearing as Tyler, young landlord of a three-flat where the top floor is inhabited by a pair of demonic entities with a bad habit of eating new tenants as soon as they move in.  Meanwhile, Tyler's policewoman sister Amy (Michelle Courvais) and her partner try to keep the city's supernatural forces from spilling out into everyday life while skimming a little off the top for themselves.  The film moves at a good clip, with strong performances across the board, and while the special effects aren't the center of attention they get the job done-- you'll probably be having too much fun to care.  One of the best independent horror films I've seen in ages, definitely recommended for horror fans looking for something fun and unique!",1268006400,6,1163,4.878172588832487

4081446,2,B0037MACJC,"From the impressive poster I was expecting a truly frightening movie with heroes battling demonic baddies in an apartment building. What we got was a cheap, cheesy, bloody, uninspired comedy (?). IF I was in the mood for a humor with badly made up demons and bad acting I might have enjoyed The Landlord but there was just too much BAD in this movie to make it even bad-good. The characters and their motivations were silly and, although an interesting germ of an idea (thus 2 stars) I just did not like the people I saw on the screen or the ""fun"" narrative: Demon serial killing and the much put upon Landlord getting rid of those pesky bodies. Sorry. This one is not recommended.",1425945600,,681,4.5

I couldn't even make it past 5 minutes into this one. The dubbed in voices made it unbearable. Cheesy effects weren't even worth humouring. ""Tales from the dark side"" back in the 80's is more enjoyable. This one just makes you want to find hot pokers to skewer into your eyeballs.  Waste your time if you're stoned and already laughing at your dog scooting his butt across your friend's white carpet.

8390616,4,B0037MACJC,"The Landlord begins with a landlord showing a man and his wife around an apartment room.  The husband thinks he needs a hacksaw for some ominous reason!  He bought one because it was on sale.  There's an element of comedy to the way he says this line!  In the bathroom he uses his finger to draw a red zapping line on the mirror making Elvis appear but it's only his imagination.  We then see the husband chasing his wife around the apartment room with a baseball bat and smacking her  in the back of the head.  He beats her to death and the landlord sees the wife's body parts scattered all over the room the next day.  This makes him barf until a green faced demon appears and says ""You're ruining my appetite"".  The landlord complains to the demons that they couldn't even wait for the couple to settle in before killing them.  The landlord says he's going to the bar and when he returns the demons better have the bodies gone.

When the man returns he paints over the bloody walls.  The green faced demon appears and celebrates another sacrifice.  The landlord asks the demon to take care of the bones in the sink. He does it but groans, lol.  He complains the last few bodies didn't taste too good because the people exercised too much.  The demon wants heavier people.  The landlord tells a woman about the demons and she's upset that they reacted so fast.  When the woman asks if he cleaned up the mess, he sarcastically says he was thinking about trying something new and just letting the bodies rot, lol.  A cop visits and says he's been here 6 times in 7 years concerning 16 missing people.  He thinks it's more than just a coincidence and asks the landlord where he hid the bodies.  The cop asks the landlord if he likes to eat people after they're dead, lol.  He says the landlord's going to fry in the court and he'll personally feed his body to the piranhas.  The cop threatens to tear this apartment down brick by brick.

The sister of the landlord talks to a man behind a building concerning the murder of a little girl.  The conversation finishes with the sister telling him to go home and brush his teeth.  A receptionist guy who works the front desk of the apartment building yells at a customer and says he's on his sh list.  A woman and a drunk couple walk in and give the receptionist a hard time.  The male customer puts cupcakes up to his nipples and pretends to be a woman forcing the receptionist dude to pull out a gun.  At this very moment a robber comes in and the receptionist guy sticks his gun up to him while the drunk people laugh.  The robber says he'll try another place, lol.  It's the next day. A woman asks to see the apartment and the landlord lets her in.

A mouse faced demon appears while the woman walks around.  The landlord's sister tells these long tooth thug-like people to head into a building.  Meanwhile her cop boyfriend in the car goes down on her. The thugs with long teeth break into an apartment and bite a man to death.  The guy's roommate tries to shoot the men and women with fangs while the female cop goes down on her boyfriend in the car outside.  The men and women with long teeth escape with... something.  The new female tenant gets into a fight with her mom on the phone.  She heads to the bar while the green faced demon watches TV in her apartment.  The cop walks in the building and asks himself if he was a psycho killer who killed a bunch of people where would he hide the bodies.  His partner says ""Hide them under the concrete"" and he responds ""I didn't ask for your input!""

The demon watches a commercial for a jerky maker.  He makes a phone call and orders one, lol.  Meanwhile it's karaoke hour at the bar for the female tenant.  The cop dances on an evil symbol painted on the floor.  The green faced demon appears and encourages the cop to shoot his partner.  He points the gun at himself after he snaps away from the demons control.  The green faced demon eats the guts out of the cops head.  The landlord walks in and asks what he's going to do with the bodies.  The demon says ""I'll eat as much as I can, you know the drill"", lol.  The landlord says he can just throw the dead bodies in the floor symbol.  The demon replies ""It's the passageway to hell- not a garbage shoot"", lol.  Meanwhile the demon uses a spoon to eat the brains of the dead cops head and this is rather gross.

The landlord recites these specific words and the two cops placed on that ring symbol to hell get sucked through.  We now see men and women in white clothing reciting words in a basement.  Just then the one woman's son and daughter walk in and say they had a scary dream interrupting the mom's moment, lol.  When the mom tucks her kids into bed, she says she and daddy are going to capture a bad spirit and make the daughter be anything she wants.  The sister of the landlord is handed blood-soaked paper money by a thug with long teeth.  She questions what it is and beats the crap out of him.  The landlord's sister chases him outside with a club and says she's going to kill his undead butt.  She smacks him in the back of the head with the club then takes a broken piece of bottle glass and repeatedly stabs it into his chest getting blood all over herself and her cop partner (lover!)

Meanwhile the female tenant watches a program about a mother stabbing her baby repeatedly.  The message is ""abortion is murder"".  The woman becomes upset and says to the lady behind the desk that she came here for two reasons- one to get a divorce and two to get an abortion.  The female tenant visits a doctor and the doctor says she can have an abortion.  When the woman heads back to hear apartment her ex-husband is waiting.  He questions the divorce papers.  She says he can't come into her place and he responds ""How can it be your place when you're paying for it with our money!""  The man follows his ex-wife upstairs and he grabs her ankles. The green faced demon possesses the ex-husband and makes him apologize and say ""Sorry for being such an a hole- you'll never hear from me again"".

The demon rips the ex-husband's leg off and shoves it into a food dehydrator.  The landlord says ""Do you know what the cops are going to do when they find out about this?"" and takes the food dehydrator away from the demon.  The green faced demon says he thinks the landlord has a problem.  He says ""No kidding I have a problem- I live with two demons who kill people!"" and the demon says ""At least you admit you have a problem,""  lol.  The other demon with a mouse face reveals herself to the female tenant in the apartment, making her scream.  The landlord comes in and acts surprised to see the demons.  The female tenant says ""You have to get me out of here!"" but he runs away.  The demon says ""Can I take your bags?"" to the female tenant.  The green faced demon says she's trapped up there in her apartment only until her baby gets bigger and says to the landlord ""And since she knows we exist, we'll have someone to talk to.""

The landlord has a discussion with his sister.  She asks what the problem is when he mentions the two demons in his apartment.  He says ""I have two flesh eating demons living in my house and I've been helping them murder innocent people for years!""  The mouse faced demon asks the green faced monster if ""The hen has laid its egg yet"" referring to the pregnant female tenant living in the apartment room.  The green faced demon says ""Not until 7 or 8 months!""  The green faced demon says if she needs anything just dream since she's not allowed out of the house until the baby is delivered.  We see a man playing a gambling game on his computer.  Someone's at his door.  His girlfriend opens the door and the men with long fangs walks inside and kills her.  They say to the gambling man ""You're just another dirty cop who doesn't do his job"" while cutting out his girlfriend's insides and putting her liver on a plate before handing it to the boyfriend  The poor guy then gets his neck bit.

The landlord's sister's ex-boyfriend appears outside and says she's better off with him instead of her limp boyfriend.  She grabs a gun and so does the landlord.  She shoots the guy right in the stomach and says ""I'm sorry you feel that way!""  Just then the whole crew of scary men and women with long fangs enter the house.  The landlord's sister shoots a few of them after her ex-boyfriend says she's going to be dead anyway.  The landlord's sister shoots the cute girl with long teeth before she's able to attack.  The landlord's sister asks the scary men and women with long teeth if it's too late to change her mind while holding a gun to her head.  The ex-boyfriend says she's not really going to kill herself.  With the gun to her head she tells her kids who are driving away with her husband ""Mommy will always love you!""  She lets her ex-boyfriend bite her neck.

Meanwhile the woman in the apartment is brought orange juice by the green faced demon to help with her pregnancy.  She asks if he knows the landlord.  He says he's known the landlord since the landlord was a child.  The landlord visits a magic shop.  He says he wants some real magic and now the magic lady has some since his parents were devil worshipers.  She questions if they worshiped a real devil or generic ones like in the movies.  The magic woman believes the landlord when he mentions the devil by name.  The landlord returns to the pregnant woman's apartment.  She gets upset and says ""You knew about the demons all along and never told me!""  He tries to defend himself that his parents were devil worshipers.  The magic woman does her thing (since she's also here in the apartment) but her hand gets zapped.  The mouse faced demon appears. The magic lady is able to prevent the mouse faced demon from coming near her using a magic spell.

The pregnant woman questions what's going on and the landlord says ""I don't know but it's kinda hot!""  lol.  The green faced demon also asks what's going on before disappearing.  The movie turns all kinds of strange blue and red colors as a way to show the demons suffering before disappearing.  The magic lady says ""Return to the hell in which you came!"" to the demons before she's stabbed to death by a woman we saw earlier.  The magic lady walks into the landlord's sister's children's bedroom.  When they ask for their mommy the lady says if their mother looks different they have to love her anyway.  The landlord's sister says to the other demons to brand her kids which makes sense since she's a demon now and doesn't care about the well-being of her kids.  The magic lady says they must listen to their mother forever.

The mouse faced demon puts a burn mark on the landlord's face before putting another mark on his forehead.  The green faced demon tells the mouse faced demon to be good to his slave.  He mentions how he worships her but he's always treated like crap.  The mouse faced demon twists the one woman's face and breaks her neck.  She gets into a fight with the green faced demon and burns his face with a shooting fireball.  This prompts the landlord and pregnant woman to run away scared, but the mouse faced demon is at the top of the stairs.  They try to walk through a door but a series of heads in some alternate realm prevent them from entering.  This scene's hilarious!  The landlord recommends they walk into the portal of hell as a way to escape.  The green faced demon sends the mouse faced demon into the portal before sending himself in the portal.  A weird animation occurs as they go through the portal, then the top of the apartment explodes.

The pregnant woman runs away.  After that ordeal you can't really blame her!  The landlord finds out he has to pay $925 in damage.  He talks to his sister's ex-boyfriend and he apologizes for turning her into a demon.  The landlord says ""It's alright man!"" then follows with ""If you hurt her I will stake you!""  As the landlord hugs his sister she tries biting his neck but he backs away. ""Easy there!""  The end.

The Landlord is a pretty funny movie!  It's not really scary though.  It might try to be scary during the final 10 minutes but it's hard to take any of this stuff seriously.  The story's zany, the pace is intense and the characters are really awesome.  Highly recommended.",1501200000,,12267,4.386939138160818
