8329723,5,B001O5JCZ4,"Imaginative, informative, and playful, this wonderful DVD offers girls a unique perspective on the physical, mental, and emotional changes that occur in the transitioning to young womanhood.  In viewing it we are invited as women to experience the body as fully embedded in the natural world - lush, vibrant, and beautiful.  Both reassuring and reflective, it provides an holistic perspective that is sorely missing from the often clinical approach to menstruation, or the dominant cultural perspective of menstruation as periodic unpleasantness.  This is a film that opens the doorway to dialogue with your daughter.  Better yet, invite a group of moms and daughters (and grandmoms too!) to watch together, and enjoy the lively and meaningful conversation it generates.",1286755200,,770,5.5
