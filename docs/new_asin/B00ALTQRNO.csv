5449614,5,B00ALTQRNO,"So happy to se the last season was finally released Excellent show with a GGREAT cast of characters!!! As one woman wrote it is great to go to sleep to which I do almost every night. Having only the 1st and second season I watch many of them over and over. Been waiting a long time for this one Now only if they woud release the rest of the seasons for Diagnois Murder. All who ordered this, enjoy",1359504000,2,397,4.102564102564102

5449616,5,B00ALTQRNO,"I really like these movies. They are great family movies to watch. I love the romance and friendship betwee
these actors. They are great movies to watch before going to bed and all through the day. It brings me bacik
to a period in my life that they solve mysteries and do it quite well. The Director and Producer should
be applauded for an outstanding performance",1358726400,2,364,4.53030303030303
5449617,3,B00ALTQRNO,"Well, here we go again. I own both Father Dowling seasons and now with the last season Paramount is ripping us off. Heck, the first two seasons of this series hasn't even had the episodes cleaned up or enhanced and they want us to pay nearly $50.00 for the third. I'm sure this third season hasn't seen any digital enhance either.
I also own all seven seasons and the first half of season eight of the Perry Mason series, and they want $50.00 for the second half of season eight with another full season to go which at $50.00 a half season will cost $100.00 just for one season.
Just seems to be a money grab on Paramount's part to get the last buck out of a good selling series that won't have anymore episodes to charge for.",1358208000,8,726,4.268115942028985
5449618,3,B00ALTQRNO,"I pre-ordered the first two seasons of Father Dowling as soon as they became available.  I have been anticipating the release of Season 3.  However, I was shocked at the price for this final season!  For less than double the episodes of Season 2, consumers must pay over two times the cost of Season 2.  I am very disappointed and will continue to hope that the price will go down soon.  Otherwise, I will have to wait to complete my collection of one of my favorite shows.

Follow up:  The price went down $15 after six months, which was much more reasonable and so I ordered it.  The set is five discs of Father Dowling fun.  It includes both my favorite and least favorite episodes of the series.  It also includes several that I never remembered seeing before, which was great to experience.  I'm thrilled to now own the entire series!",1358035200,29,839,4.490066225165563

5449637,5,B00ALTQRNO,"I have all three seasons. My favorite of the who-dun-it series with a religious background. Interesting that only in America can a Jew (Tom Bosley) play a Catholic  Priest. And both Tom Bosley and Tracy Nelson were good in their parts. Together with Father Prestwick and Marie a clear family orientation was in view (in the sense of a mother, two very unnalike brothers and one sister). There is the who-dun-it series of Cadfael played by Derek Jacoby  and the Movie ""by any other name"" with Sean Connery that might be enjoyed if one enjoys religious background in their who-dun-its.",1445040000,,583,4.82

5449639,5,B00ALTQRNO,NBC cancelled this series too soon. Granted there was a slight dip in production values when they moved the shooting from Coloradoto California. But the acting was top notch and so was the writing. RIP Tom Bosley,1439856000,,212,4.756756756756757

5449641,3,B00ALTQRNO,"Enjoyed the third and final season -  but not up to the standard of the first two.  Good for a wet Sunday to watch -  I think the problem was the stories got a bit here we go again, plus not feasible, predictable - but I still enjoyed it.",1438387200,,238,3.816326530612245

5449700,5,B00ALTQRNO,"Like Lay's potato chips ""I couldn't see just one."" I loved all three seasons.  This series features a main character in an unlikely profession for solving murders. Father Frank Dowling is a fine Catholic parish priest in Chicago, drives housekeeper Marie to despair by his habit of being late for dinner as he and his assistant (streetwise nun Stephanie 'Steve' ) solve numerous neighborhood crimes, usually involving at least one murder. Wherever Father Dowling and his assistant Sister Steve Oskowsky go, someone turns up dead.
While the local police are usually quick to find a likely suspect, the snooping priest just as quickly finds a good reason to take a
closer look. They generally outsmart the police as well as the criminals. The sometimes live-in priest Father Philip Prestwick, whose priority is his own ecclesiastical career prospects, takes a very dim view of their crime fighting even when he unintentionally gets involved.",1398124800,,939,5.177631578947368

5449702,5,B00ALTQRNO,Tom Bosley shows off his diverse talent once again. He is joined by a newcomer to the small screen in Tracie Nelson whose roots in TV are legendary. Mary Wickes and Gene Stephens add a little spice to the stew.,1396742400,,210,4.275

5449706,5,B00ALTQRNO,this season was their best ever i liked the first and second but the third was absoultly their best ever.,1394323200,,105,4.3
5449707,5,B00ALTQRNO,"Father Dowling is a fun ""light weight"" mystery series.  Sister Stephanie (""Steve"") is a ""street wise"" nun who grew up on the tough streets (the ""neighborhood"") of Chicago (I keep trying to figure out why she has a New York accent, however).  Steve can gamble and pick locks, and with all her ""street skills"" helps Father Dowling solve mysteries.

This DVD was (listed) very expensive, as others have mentioned, but I watched and waited until it went on sale on amazon.com ($17.49).",1394150400,,481,4.841463414634147
5449708,5,B00ALTQRNO,"Father Dowling from season 1 to 3 is brilliant, a noisey Priest and his side kick a nun go's sluthing and is smart than the cops hahaha a must to own",1393200000,,149,3.838709677419355
5449709,5,B00ALTQRNO,"Were waiting for several years for this to come out - completes the set. A light-hearted light comedy about a  Chicago Catholic priest willing to bend the rules a bit to solve mysteries and murders that he walks into, and a nun who is more than willing to break the rules into poker chips if that is what it takes to sole the crime - they balance each other nicely. Pretty reminscent of Murder She Wrote - many of same actors and production people, but not so dry or intense. Well worth the price, and more interesting for 3 seasons than Columbo or Matlock or Magnum PI, which all got repetitious pretty quickly.",1393027200,,612,4.415929203539823
5449710,5,B00ALTQRNO,"This final season of Father Dowling was just as good as I remembered it.  Light, funny and of course the good guys always win.  Would recommend this series.",1391472000,,156,4.535714285714286

5449712,5,B00ALTQRNO,I chose this rating as it is a great series the characters are funny I would recommend this to anyone,1390262400,,101,4.1
5449713,5,B00ALTQRNO,Our whole family likes these mysteries. Not too graphic so I have no problem with my teenagers watching them. Oldie but goodie,1387584000,,126,4.7727272727272725
5449714,2,B00ALTQRNO,I am writing this review solely based on the packaging of my DVD as I have not even watched it yet.  I was very disturbed when I received this set and discovered that the front cover plastic was badly wrinkled and crimped.  I assume this was caused by the excessive heat they use when they melt the shrink wrap on the box.  It appears to be melted and just looks terrible in my opinion.  This type of DVD case has been around for years now and I really think this issue should have been resolved by now.  CBSs' MSRP for this DVD set is nearly $60! (which I think is just ridiculous).  For that price I think a factory defect like this is just simply a slap in the face to consumers.  I could maybe accept it if I found this on Wal-Mart's $5 rack. Fortunately I got my set for much less by purchasing all 3 sets on Amazon together for $35.  I already own the first 2 sets but should be able to sell the new ones for around $20 making the price of this set comparable to what I paid for the other 2.,1386979200,,997,4.025380710659898

Father Frank Dowling solves mysteries with his sidekick Sister Steve; however, there is his housekeeper Marie and his fellow man of the cloth, Father Prestwick, who add a lot of humor to the situations.

5449724,5,B00ALTQRNO,This series was done extremely well.  Who wouldn't believe Tom Bosley as a priest. I am enjoying each and every episode.,1375833600,,120,4.714285714285714
5449725,5,B00ALTQRNO,"I enjoy all the Father Dowling mysteries and this was no exception. That being said, one episode, the one in Malibu, just didn't work very well. It is out of the traditional Chicago setting that is crucial to Father Dowling, but the characters are different. Father Dowling is less patient, and Steve looks like she is going into acting.  All the other episodes were a fitting end to the series. The last episode has a very nice twist (no plot spoiler) that actually redeems one of the characters.",1374969600,,497,4.6477272727272725

5449729,5,B00ALTQRNO,"First, the actors were well chosen, the stories, even though fiction, still played out as possible, real. There was every emotion that humans might feel or act on but told so well that there was no need for grossness! Love, hate, sexual desire, pride, etc. in other words you aren't likely to see anything like it on television today. Sometimes a movie will be made that has these qualities but not too often. I don't know why it was cancelled so soon, but we enjoy watching them and after time has passed, they are still good to watch!",1371254400,,536,4.479591836734694

5449735,5,B00ALTQRNO,"I do enjoy the Father Dowling series, and I'm very glad all three seasons are now on DVD.  It would have been nice to have some more extra features, but I'm just glad to have the show on disc.",1367625600,,192,3.923076923076923

5449739,5,B00ALTQRNO,A very well produced series.  Tom Bosley and Tracy Nelson are at their best.  Many episodes keep one guessing for quite a while.  I wish they had similar mysteries being produced nowadays.,1367020800,,188,4.8125

5449741,5,B00ALTQRNO,"I watched the series when it came out -- LOVE Tom Bosley.  They're wonderful mysteries that entertain.  In this day and age of improper language and attrocious behavior, this is such a wonderful series to watch.  Again, great for the family...and, for anyone afraid of the ""religious"" implications, it is not ""preachy"" at all.  It's just right versus wrong...and right wins out!",1366934400,,378,5.048387096774194

5449745,4,B00ALTQRNO,I've always been a fan of the simple mystery shows; the story lines are good and not dark; it's also easy to watch and do 2-3 other things while watching.,1366502400,,154,4.166666666666667
5449746,5,B00ALTQRNO,"This was a gift for my Mom, who really has enjoyed watching this t.v. series.  She loves mystery movies, and I get them for her whenever possible.  Unfortunately, this was ""The Third and Final Season"", so I won't be able to get anymore of this particular series.  But, I know she will be watching them over and over again.  She loves it.  Thanks!",1366329600,,346,4.428571428571429
5449747,5,B00ALTQRNO,The quality is excellent for the DVD's. I was and am sad that this series faded after so short a time,1366243200,,101,3.857142857142857

The actors are just natural and great.",1365724800,3,138,4.52

5449752,5,B00ALTQRNO,We really are enjoying this.  We have one more disc to view and then it is over.  I don't know why they did not continue making these.  Maybe the author discontinued writing these.  This program is delightful.,1365379200,,209,4.5675675675675675
5449753,5,B00ALTQRNO,"This was their last season but it leaves you wishing for more. Miss Nelson is fantastic as Sister Steve and Tom Bosley makes a wonderful priest. The quality of all three seasons is super and if you are a murder mystery buff as I am this is a ""must"" for your collection.",1365120000,5,269,4.1923076923076925
5449754,5,B00ALTQRNO,"Before you come unglued at the price of Season #3, keep in mind that Season #3 has more episodes (22) than Seasons ##1 & 2 did combined (21). Season #1 has only 8 episodes, including the pilot, and Season #2 has 13 episodes, so the total for the first two seasons is less than Season #3 by itself.

Moreover, you should consider that Season #3 has ""The Prodigal Son Mystery,"" the single-best piece of TV entertainment ever filmed. ""The Prodigal Son Mystery"" is worth the price of Season #3 even if it were the only episode on the disks. Also Season #3 has the second-best Father Dowling episode, ""The Christmas Mystery,"" so you would be getting good value for Season #3 if it cost twice what it does.

Finally, kudos are in order to CBS for finally getting out the official Father Dowling Mystery sets--it only took them 22 years! I have spent the last two-plus decades watching deteriorating VCRs and lousy pirated Chinese versions (complete with un-turn-offable Chinese subtitles). I even had to buy an all-region DVD player so I could watch this pirated garbage. Bless you, CBS, and may your reward be great in TV heaven for finally supplying us Father Dowling fans with this wonderful blessing. If you want to see some good, thoughtful, witty TV, turn off the inane singing contests, and buy a set of the Father Dowling Mysteries.

What a pity that Mary Wickes, Tom Bosley, and author Ralph McInerny are no longer with us!",1364601600,16,1426,4.673306772908367
5449755,5,B00ALTQRNO,Buy Buy Buy was a great series.  Tom Bosley left Murder She Wrote to star in this series.  The writting and story lines were great.,1363996800,,131,4.2

5449757,5,B00ALTQRNO,"This was the third and final season of Father Dowling Mysteries.  Its too bad it didn't survive for many more seasons!  I guess it was ""too clean"".
