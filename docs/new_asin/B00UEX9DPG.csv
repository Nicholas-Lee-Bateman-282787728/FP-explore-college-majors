8705535,5,B00UEX9DPG,"No, I don't own a copy of these two movies but, I sure do wish I could get my hands on them. It Conquered the World"" was about a funny-looking cone -shaped monster fron space. It once in a while, especially when alarmed, would give ""birth"" to these odd-looking bats. I remember one part there was a Latino guarding an area where this being was being kept and it emitted one of those bat-like creatures and the guy ran away frightened and telling the people while he was running ""I just saw a funny looking bird"". It was really hilarious. The other film entitled ""Invasion of the Saucermen"" was another great flick. These pint-sized aliens with huge bulging eyes injecting alcohol as a way to make people forget what they had seen. What a pair of movies! You'll die laughing! So much fun to see movies like this. You know what they say? ""THEY JUST DON""T MAKE THEM THE WAY THEY USED TO!"" However if amyone knows where to get a copy of this DVD please let me know. Are you listeniing AMAZON?! Correct me if I am wrong - Steve Terrell the star of Invasion and Beverly Garland the star of It Conquered the World?",1461628800,8,1107,4.378640776699029
8705536,5,B00UEX9DPG,"These two masterpieces of science fiction schlock NEED to be made available again.  I never thought these two films would be sold together, as they've both been on my mental Wish List for a long time -- in more than a decade of searching, I've never seen the collection pictured here in any store or catalog!  IT CONQUERED THE WORLD is a Roger Corman laugh fest, featuring an alien that resembles a giant turnip with big teeth and lobster claws.  One of the silliest looking monsters ever created, its demise must be seen to be believed.  The better of these two black and white movies is INVASION OF THE SAUCER MEN.  It was shot on a low budget, and was done cleverly enough that the only four aliens that the budget allowed for creating were utilized in a way that leads the audience to believe there are many more.  The picture has a wonderful, creepy atmosphere, the short, big-headed, big-eyed aliens' method of neutralizing their victims is inventive (they inject alcohol through their fingernails, their hands featuring their own sets of eyes), and there are plenty of teenagers, cars and humorous dialogue. Watch for Frank Gorshin as the town drunk. This is one of my all-time favorite, so-bad-it's-great sci-fi movies.  There are many more movies in this period that are far worse, including two really bad re-makes of this film, and they're available.  Why not these two lost ""gems?""
In response to the reader comment, a general statement about shopping for physical media (as opposed to downloadable material):  I looked for both of these movies many times -- I have several ""Midnight Movies"" DVDs, but I somehow managed to miss this one -- and I used to paw through DVD bins for old favorites almost every week, until the big stores that sold a good selection started closing -- only then, around 2005, did I start regularly shopping on Amazon (and I still miss the tactile and visual pleasures of looking through LPs, CDs and DVDs in person - only a few of the Barnes & Nobles have any kind of selection, and Best Buy is only good for top sellers -- you can no longer find much there in the way of obscure music or movies).  I'm 62, and I never thought I would find myself behind the times and wishing for ""the good old days,"" but I really dislike the transition we're in, with everything in digital form replacing real, physical objects.  While I do enjoy the convenience of being able to download A song, when I don't want the rest of an album, I still collect music and movies, appreciating the artwork and accompanying information.  Sadly, I don't think the equipment to play CDs and DVDs will be around as long as those things will last... Meanwhile, we're seeing a surprising revival of vinyl LP production (audiophiles are especially thrilled). I only wonder how long that will last...",1436227200,19,2805,4.6904276985743385
