1421332,4,B00005B1W6,"Now, Mudvayne totally rocks! Kudd is a great vocalist! But this disc is a SINGLE. So don't expect a disc with like 6 music videos. It only has one, but you can have lots of different angles on the ONE music video (Dig) so it's like having 6 different videos on the disc. But, remember, they have more stuff than that one video. They have interviews, making of...,etc. If you like Mudvayne, get this. I love Mudvayne, by the way. Buy this disc fellow Mudvayners! It's only 10 bucks!",1000252800,,481,4.415730337078652
1421333,4,B00005B1W6,"Reviewer: Ryan Richards from Omaha, NE USA As soon as I heard DIG off of napster; I fell in love with this band. No band has a better bass to kick drum relationship or singing to screaming ability. If you were to listen to Mudvayne for the first time it would resemble Rush on steroids. The bands timing and timing changes are so precise that you could swear you were listening to a MIDI recording straight from the computer. If you were to compare mudvayne to slipknot... the only thing you would find similar is that they are from small Midwest towns such as myself. The video has the infamous multi-view angles of DIG which the user can control, a half-hour making of the video, the EPK package, 5.1 surround sound, and a digital photo gallery. I do agree it could have had some footage of the House of Blues preformance on it. That is the only reason I gave this DVD 4 stars. This DVD is a must have for any MATH METAL fan and it's the reason I bought a DVD player.",992563200,3,969,4.271739130434782
1421334,4,B00005B1W6,"MuDvAnYe is awesome.  I drove over 500 miles to see them in concert...  but this is not about the band, it's about the DVD. In the DVD you get to see how DIG was made along with the Video.  Also includes some other extras (very little).  Anyway I'm happy with the DVD but I wish they could have done a bit more with it, like add a couple of songs from their House of Blue concert.  In this case you get what you pay for.  Best part is seeing SPAG tearing up the drums in the making of DIG.  If your interested in just getting the DVD for the DIG video then this is for you.  Hope this helps.",988329600,7,591,3.907563025210084
1421335,5,B00005B1W6,"For anyone to say MuDvAyNe is a rip-off of slipknot should not even be listening to this type of music, because they have dpont know what they are talking about. Slipknot does alot more yelling than just singing, and they don't have any similiar sounds. Even if they did sound like them, there's nothing wrong with it since they are two of the greatest bands. This DVD gives you the DIG video, which is awsome. The Making of DIG, which is insane, Seeing them record Spag (drummer) is probably one of the best drum solo's i have ever seen. Also other stuff, such as 8 angles of the camera you can control while watching the DIG video. This is a must for any Heavy fan, plus its under $10.",987724800,3,687,4.333333333333333
1421336,5,B00005B1W6,"This is a great DVD that I would recommend to anyone.  The real jewel of the disk is the behind the scenes featurette.  It gives you the chance to see the band members as real people who are more intelligent than many would like to believe.  The multiple angles for the video are also very good.  As for Mudvayne copying off of Slipknot, and Slipknot copying off of Mushroomhead(which they didn't); they ALL copied off of Kiss.  Also, I'm sure Kiss weren't the first band to ever do it, they were just the biggest.",987033600,,514,4.425531914893617
1421337,5,B00005B1W6,"Why is every metal band with painted faces or masks considered Slipknot Copies? Anyway, the Music's great, the video rocks and so does Mudvayne. (Doesn't SOUND much like Slipknot to me, and how a band SOUNDS is what's important right? or have we all been brainwashed by Carson Daly?)(Slipknot's still cool by the way)",986947200,3,317,4.888888888888889
1421338,5,B00005B1W6,"This DVD is a masterpeice. I do have to say though, that the last reviewer said that Mudvayne were Slipknot immitators. They are not, they are a heavy metal band that wears make up sometimes on stage. so does Manson, so do alot of bands. Slipknot are Mushroomhead immitators. If you actually heard the Mudvayne CD, you would probably realize that mudvayne are nowhere near sounding like Slipknot, but sound as though they are picking up where Snot left off(RIP Lynn). Mudvayne aren't your typical Nu-Metal band, they pick up on old school bands like slayer and pantera by seldom using keyboards, turntables, etc. Old School metal fans(like myself) pick this DVD and CD up.",986860800,2,672,4.852173913043479
1421339,4,B00005B1W6,"i just saw the video for this last night and i'm gonna get the dvd to this when it comes out.  Mudvayne are Slipknot imitators, but that doesn't make them bad....",985651200,,162,4.225806451612903

7936946,5,B00005B1W6,"I passed on this when it came out out because it had just one videoclip on it. But it is not only THE best DVD single I have ever seen but also my fav Mudvayne song.

What makes this DVD so special is that you can watch 8 different versions of it; the regular version and 7 others from different angles portraying every musician separately. And the sound and pi are of HUGE quality too !! The pic bitrate is very high and the sound is LPCM. You do not get to change angles during the clips. You select a musician from a menu and you got him playing for the whole duration of the song. How cool is that. This is one of the most enjoyable DVDs I own, and I ownn 1000 !!",1352419200,,667,3.9407407407407407
7936947,5,B00005B1W6,"I am a huge MUDVAYNE fan. I can even sound like KUD when im screaming the words too. When someone says that Mudvayne does not have the write to be called a real ban, that person should be kicked in the Kidneys. But to the DVD. This is an asum DVD, with video footage that you can't get any were elts. And since its on DVD format the most compatible format around, I can play it on almost any DVD reading drive in my house. If you like Goth, Goth rock, or any thing that envolves crazy guys with paint all over there faces then this DVD if for you. Or if you just like the band than this DVD is still for you!!",1054166400,,609,3.9193548387096775

7936949,5,B00005B1W6,"this DVD is bad ...  especially when they're filming SpAg's part for the video.  those that have seen the DVD know what i'm talkin about.  he's a killer drummer.  anyways, i recommend this DVD to all mudvayne fans",1025740800,,213,4.526315789473684
7936950,5,B00005B1W6,"Dig is a huge mosh pit hit and the special features are great!!! This DVD single contains Live footage, the making of the music video for Dig, has surround sound, and the director's cut of Dig. You must get this for it is a buck worth spending!!!",1025136000,,246,4.25531914893617
7936951,4,B00005B1W6,"I love Mu Dv Ay Ne. Ever since I heard ""Dig"" I have loved them. But this DVD is not all that I expected. The music video for ""Dig"" (which all in all wasn't that great), multiple angles for the video, and some great behind the scenes footage. Other than that, there is nothing else, no ""Easter Eggs"" (hidden stuff), no bonus features, nothing really else. I really enjoyed the backsage footage. It was very interesting and in some parts very amusing. But that really is not enough. The song is really great, but they could have at least put some extra stuff on here, like an unreleased song, or a remix (of which ""Dig"" has two). Or maybe even some live footage. But all in all, it is a must have for all true Mu Dv Ay Ne fans...

7936952,5,B00005B1W6,"This DVD is an essential if you are a Mudvayne fan. This DVD comes equipped with the ""Dig"" music video which is one of the most visually stimulating videos ever, photo gallery of the band which is great if you have a DVD compadable computer, behind the scenes making of the ""Dig"" video which is very entertaining and amusing, zeta reticuli... you have to see that for yourself, and multi-angles of the video which allows you to make your own version of the video. Great DVD that isn't that much to buy.",1015286400,,502,4.467391304347826
7936953,4,B00005B1W6,"This is a great DVD.  Despite the fact that it is short, it gives a great look at the band behind the scenes, without the makeup.  The guys are all pretty funny (well, maybe not Gurgg, but the other 3 are all lively with great personalities).  This is a must have for fans of the band.",1002758400,,285,4.053571428571429
