The interviews gave it a really human feel. The chill music added a really reflective feel to their stories of the civil war.
The shots of the surf were awesome and give a really good idea of what can be in store for anyone interested.
Thanks for caring and sharing. I feel like I have a better picture of the people and environment of this country.",1358985600,,439,4.301204819277109
8305105,5,B001GEFIGK,"Stunning movie. Great story line & some great surfing in a land of war & poverty. Very well done & gives hope that something as simple as riding waves can save lives. Gritty when needed, fun & happy when least expected. Highly recommended story.",1356393600,,245,4.590909090909091
8305106,4,B001GEFIGK,"Excelent perspective over surfing on this film, no stars, no ""volcom"" shit, no evident bussiness behind, just a human point of view over other people's reality through the mysterious grace of surfing",1350432000,,199,5.25
8305107,5,B001GEFIGK,"A fantastic movie with touching stories of real survivors in a battered and broken country.  I do not surf, but love the ocean and admire those who have this athletic talent.  It was a fantastic way to get to Liberia and visit and learn about a tragedy that largely goes unspoken.  I have Liberian children and have visited once.  This is a movie that needs to be seen.  I purchased it thinking it would be a nice smarmy home video type production and was blown away by the incredible editing and visuals.  The shots from the water are breathtaking and artistic.  Fantastic sliding footage woven with a painful reality that needs to be publicized so people can step in and help.  Buy it and watch it and then do something about it.",1284249600,,731,4.484848484848484
8305108,5,B001GEFIGK,"Having (and surfed) in Liberia, this DVD brought back many memories. It captured the post-conflict atmosphere - incredibly hospital people in the face of a destroyed country. And of course, great surf. Highly recommend adding this DVD to your collection.",1259884800,,254,5.375

Beautiful cinematography, incredible story, amazing interviews, stellar soundtrack. What more do you want? Buy this movie with your money and watch it with your eyes!",1235779200,3,271,5.634146341463414
