7936705,5,B00005B44O,"I found the movie to have Comedy, Action, and enough turns to still keep me happy until the very end of the movie. If you like CIA conspiracies, then  this movie is a must buy.",1018483200,2,176,4.0285714285714285
7936706,1,B00005B44O,"""Crash and Byrnes"" is, at best, the worst movie ever made when compared to the series it tries to mimic, ""Waize and Means.""  Instead of Bobby Waize and Russel Means we are presented with two awful characters no one cares about.  The plot for CAB borrows heavily from the first Waize and Means movie: ""Congressman Columbia: A Waize & Means Adventure,"" as well as the fourth: ""Kurds and Leans: Another Waize & Means Adventure.""  Other great movies in this series are ""Waize & Means 2: Commander Cow,"" as well as the seminal ""THE WAIZE AND MEANS COMMITTEE.""  Also don't forgot to check out the series, ""Kurds and Leans,"" to see a lighter, more comidic take on the theme.",1002585600,2,667,4.627118644067797
