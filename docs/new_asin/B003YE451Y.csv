4228718,5,B003YE451Y,"I purchased both sets on Battle Field Vietnam and watch a little bit each night until finished.  I looked forward to each evening after work and after dinner when I could settle into my lounger and become better educated on this conflict.  Growing up in the 60's I remember some things from the CBS Evening News casts and from current events in middle and high schools, and then watching this series really helped me put it all into perspective.  I liked the frequent switch to maps, outlining the units and movements and then back to archival footage of troops.  I have viewed other Vietnam documentaries, including a very good one narrated by Walter Cronkite, but this one stands out more like one I would be seeing at in a Military Science course in college where much time was made to look objectively at tactics, troops, mistakes and results.  I have never seen so much footage of NVA-VC origin in any documentary.  Some is very grainy and hard to view but that is the nature of the film quality of the time.  I got a much better perspective of Vietnamization and I think my perspective on war from Tet to the final withdrawing of from the US Embassy in Saigon has been changed and improved by the study of this documentary.  Growing up with this war seeing reports nightly as it happened and now seeing this documentary as a seasoned adult, I know now how much I missed or was glossed over when I was a kid.  Lessons here to be learned so that hopefully we never make the same costly mistakes again.  God Bless those who served.",1363824000,2,1534,4.505415162454874
4228719,5,B003YE451Y,"Great details leading up to the battles and what took place.  I had former Vietnam vets wanting to view this video who were at the actual battles, they all said video was very close to what they remember.  God bless our Soldiers.",1357344000,,229,4.428571428571429
4228720,3,B003YE451Y,"The original episodes of Battlefield: Vietnam were about 2 hours or so.  This, and the other Battlefield: Vietnam DVD cut them into a little less than 1 hour.  I saw the original series on PBS in 1999, and clearly recall many details that are not in these episodes (the tunnels of Cu Chi, for example had tunnel design, layout, fortifications, traps etc. that is missing from the episode on this DVD).

This is still a fantastic documentary and I'm very pleased to have them in my library as they are so very well researched and presented.  I just wish the original episodes could be purchased.  These edit out a great amount of detail that made viewing so immersive.  I recommend getting both DVD's and the original episode order can be found in the wiki article for this series.  That's the best way to watch them, I think.

Enjoy.  If I ever do find the original episodes, I will update.my review.",1355702400,9,900,4.575
4228721,5,B003YE451Y,"Amazon's Editorial Review for this Blu-ray is the same one used for the DVD release, therefore its description for which episodes is included is incorrect.

This 1-disc Blu-ray contains 6 episodes of the 12 episode Battlefield Vietnam series that was first released on PBS in 1999.  The other 6 episodes can be found on the companion disc here:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlefield-Vietnam-from-Dien-Bien-Phu-to-Peace-with-Honor-As-Seen-On-PBS-Blu-ray/dp/B0047XAEKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlefield Vietnam: from Dien Bien Phu to Peace with Honor. As Seen On PBS [Blu-ray</a>]

This is an excellent series that covers the Vietnam War from 1954-1975.  Each episode is approximately 1 hour long and it's one of the best documentaries I've seen on the subject as it provides a very good overview of the many battles and political events that happened during the war.  It presents everything that unfolded in an impartial way and it is done entirely with narration over archival footage and computer generated battle maps, there are no combat veteran interviews.

This Blu-ray disc includes these six episodes:

1.)  Countdown to Tet
- Covers the events in 1967 which lead the Vietcong to plan an all out attack on South Vietnam during the Tet New Year of 1968.

2.)  The Tet Offensive
- Covers the Tet Offensive of 1968 in great detail, especially the street battles in Saigon and Hue and the resulting near annihilation of the Vietcong.

3.)  The Showdown in the Iron Triangle
- Covers the US Operations which try to seek and destroy the Vietcong and induce them into set piece battles in various areas between Saigon and Cambodia in 1966-67.

4.)  War on the DMZ
- Covers the battles and US Operations that raged around the DMZ in the years before 1968.

5.)  Siege at Khe Sanh
- Covers in great detail the largest battle of the war around the US Marine base at Khe Sanh, including the surrounding hill battles and the many B-52 strikes.  This episode is the highlight of the series for me, it covers this battle better than any other documentary I've seen.  A lot of the battle was artillery fire being exchanged on both sides and this episode covers exactly where the artillery pieces were placed and shows how the US was able to resupply its troops on the nearby hills while under heavy fire, it was very well done.

6.)  The Fall of Saigon
- Covers the Easter Offensive of 1972 and the unrestricted Christmas Bombings which leads to the Paris Peace Accords of 1973 and the end of the War for the US.  This episode finishes with the battles that occurred in the two years after the US left and the resulting defeat of South Vietnam with the fall of Saigon.

The episodes on this disc are presented in a full screen presentation as they were when first broadcasted, they're unfortunately not formatted for widescreen tv's, so when viewing the whole picture on those types of televisions you will see black bars on the sides.

If there's any drawback to the series, it's that it glosses over some key US battles that occurred in the final years of the war.  There's barely a mention of the battles on ""Hamburger Hill"" in 1969 and there's no mention of the US Navy's success in 1972 after it had implemented the Topgun school for its fighter pilots.  Also, the episodes are presented in a somewhat confusing way, they're not in production order or chronological order between the two companion discs.

Even with the few drawbacks, this series is very good and I would definitely recommend it to anybody interested in learning more about the Vietnam War.  By the time you're finished with all 12 episodes, it will have been like taking a Vietnam history class, you will be way more knowledgable on the subject.",1339372800,7,3760,4.953748006379585
4228722,1,B003YE451Y,"I saw this on TV - it is the best thing on US war in Vietnam, especially as it gave pretty equal play to the Americans and also the Vietnamese. The Tet series is great.

Only problem with this DVD - mine didn't work. Neither did the replacement I asked for. Sent them both back.",1338249600,3,278,4.054545454545455

As one who studied the Vietnam conflict a great deal, I consider this two DVD set series to be the best visual history of the Vietnam conflict that I have seen.  It was originally issued as a 12 VHS series by Time Life in 1998, although there is no indication of this on the current DVD boxes.  It spans the timeframe of 1954 to 1975, from the end of the French Indochina War to the fall of Saigon.  The Battlefield Vitnam: Tet! series covers the Tet offensive and its prelude, as well as the fall of Saigon, very clearly.  It is best coupled with the accompanying set, Battlefield Vietnam: From Dien Bien Phu to Peace With Honor, which covers the remainder of the Vietnam conflict, including the Air War, the siege of Khe Sanh, the Search and Destroy operations, and the 'Peace with Honor' Paris Peace Accord.  Of particular value to those who wish to know more about the origins of American involvement in Vietnam are disc 1 of Vietnam: From Dien Bien Phu to Peace with Honor, which deals with the end of the French colonial period with the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu, the subsequent political negotiations involving the French, the Vietnamese, the Chinese and the Americans, what was supposed to be a temporary division of Vietnam into a northern and southern politically controlled regions pending elections that were scheduled to be held in 1958 but never were, and the growing American political, economic and military involvement in Vietnam.  This series is also particularly useful because it helps elucidate the stategies and tactics followed by the two sides throughout the course of the Vietnam war.",1292976000,45,2037,5.74750830564784

4228734,5,B003YE451Y,"The battlefield series presentation of the Vietnam War in the Tet offensives is well done and detailed. It goes along with and is a complement to the Battlefield presentation of the Vietnam War. It was, to my mind, a bit odd to present this history in two separate parts but this does not detract from the overall quality of the effort. The first part (Vietnam) goes from the French experience up to the later stages of the US involvement. This part seems to end rather abruptly and leave the final stages of the war untold. This series adds this missing piece as well as telling the story of the various Tet operations. As a veteran of this war I recommend this documentary to anyone wishing to understand this troubled part of American history. I would suggest that anyone considering this series to get both Vietnam Tet and Vietnam: From Dien Bien Phu to Peace with Honor in order to get the whole picture.",1365033600,,909,4.58282208588957

It could have easily been on one DVD. I wanted insight into the TET offensive and information I had not known previously.  This DVD set did not provide any new information I had not read about or seen on other documentaries.
