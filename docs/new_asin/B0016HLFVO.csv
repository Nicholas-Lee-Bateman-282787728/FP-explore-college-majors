3156393,5,B0016HLFVO,"This is a nicely done video. This DVD features 13 Christian songs; there is an introductory period before each song that demonstrates each sign that will be used during the song. The Board Certified Music Therapist, Erin Haynes, has a beautiful singing voice that is very nice to listen to. This is a simple video, but easy to follow.  Parents, teachers and childcare providers should watch with the children, so everyone can sign together and enhance their learning experience. Check it out... simple, sweet and an enjoyable time for all!",1311984000,2,539,4.988888888888889
3156394,5,B0016HLFVO,"We have four little ones who were between the ages of 12 months and 5 years  when we got this DVD two have Down Syndrome and are very visual in their learning.  All of our little ones love this video. They (even the ones with DS) have caught on to the signs and tried to sign and sing along starting the first time they watched it. This is not ""professionally"" done however it has been very useful and worthwhile for us. When we put the Signing Bible songs DVD in they all stop, sing and sign along. If you would like your little ones to hide some of Gods songs in their minds and hearts then I would buy this DVD.",1238976000,6,614,4.066115702479339
3156395,1,B0016HLFVO,"This video is not the best, when the women signs and moves her hands above her head you are unable to see her hands. The footage is bad. Hence you don't know what she is signing.  Also, this video is not for toddlers 18-24 months.  She signs so quickly, moving from one song to the next and leaving no room for learning.",1238371200,2,320,4.145161290322581

8262565,1,B0016HLFVO,"This DVD claims to teach how to sign songs and even says it is ""more advanced"" than its predecessor. If this is advanced, I'd hate to see simple. Much of what the woman does is gestures not signs. Some of the signs she does use, she forms either sloppily or incorrectly. As such, she is a poor language model (language = American Sign Language, not English) for Deaf children or those wishing to learn to interact with them. An example of the poverty of quality is in the song, ""Jesus Loves Me."" For the line, ""Little ones to Him belong,"" she uses one sign: children. A Deaf child watching the video or watching someone ""sign"" who learned from the video gets none of the meaning of that line of the song. Some great signing DVDs are available, but this definitely is not one of them for anyone who wants to learn legitimate interpretation of the music. This is fine for a young hearing child to give them some movement while singing, but that's all. I was extremely disappointed.",1451001600,,979,4.50561797752809

8262570,4,B0016HLFVO,"This DVD is a great deal for the price (about $10).  I would buy more like this if they were available.

The DVD is a collection of a few simple Bible songs for toddlers, Pre-K and K age children.  My toddlers and Pre-K age children like it.

The instructor introduces a song and most of the signs to be used, and then she sings and signs the song.  There are only a few signs used per song, but it is a good introduction to signing for the younger kids.  Many important and common signs are used throughout (God, Bible, Jesus, me, love, sister, brother, serve, etc.)

It is a very basic production.  There aren't any graphics or action, just a single straight on view of the instructor singing and signing.  Sometimes the instructor's hands go outside the camera's view, but that has a minimal impact.

It's simple, but my three 1 to 4 year old children like it and are learning basic signs from it.  I recommend it.",1325462400,3,917,4.398809523809524
