6302210,4,B002RL8P2U,"I PURCHASED THIS MOVIE AND I ENJOYED IT TO THE HIGHEST, I AM GLAD
THAT THERE ARE MOVIES IN A POSITIVE SETTING WITH SOME REALISTIC SCENES THAT PEOPLE MAY BE ABLE TO RELATE WITH.  NOT ALWAYS ABOUT THE SAME OLD IDEAS THAT PEOPLE HAVE OF GAY PEOPLE, THAT ALL THEY ARE INTERESTED IN IS A ROLL IN THE HAY, BUT LIFE CHANGING SITUATIONS IN WHICH MANY ARE FACING AND DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO TURN TO FOR ASSISTANCE OR HELP!!  MAKE MORE MOVIES LIKE THESE AND YOU GOT MY SUPPORT 100%.

6302211,4,B002RL8P2U,"Please ignore attributes like editing, continuity, acting, and easily audible dialog so that you can love this movie as it is.  While these qualities are important for lesser films, the fact of this delicate and loving love story (I have not seen the ending yet...) is enough by itself to widen the world for old white folks like me.  (I hope there is no sad ending.)
Many movies with central gay characters made by people with Asian or ""third world"" identifications carry the theme that true love and caring exists between men more easily than between men and women.  It is as though men can be friends as well as lovers, while a man and a woman, might be one more than the other -- or neither, once they share children.  This would be a regrettable stereotype were it not so universal in semi-pro, gay-themed movies, such that it might represent a stage in social development.  Gay love in society may have to justify itself at others' expense just to rebut the assumption that gay love is a foul business compared to straight love.
In any event, movies like this are popping up from all over, as though filmmaking can lift people from social oblivion into full membership in society.  Rag Tag presents characters one is glad to know.",1285804800,7,1236,4.621004566210046
6302212,5,B002RL8P2U,"finally a film about black gay men I can really relate to...with believable characters living beyond the stereotypic glam shop, party and play and looking fabulous ""lifestyle""...helps that this British film features brothers from the Caribbean and West Africa navigating the challenges of carving out a place for their love across the African diaspora both in England and Nigeria...sweet scenes mixed with the typical comedic style West AFrican film pacing...love, love, love it!!!",1275868800,35,481,5.602739726027397

6302214,5,B002RL8P2U,"Since this movie came out way before ""Esteros"" (similar story of two childhood friends reunited as adults) I appreciate this gem even more...The  exposure of black youth and young men in England's version of low class neighborhood, populated by mostly first generation immigrants ( with  high hopes for the second generation, but sometimes neglectful and defeated), mixed with racial,  cultural and religious boundaries is very realistic. The story of these two is all about unconditional love, respect, trust, and looking out for each other, not without the normal ups and downs, occasional  burst of anger and disappointment...But their love always shines thru. The love scene was tender, highly emotional, happy and giddy, and their future together was cemented. Superb acting by the two main characters (it does not hurt that Rag looks like a spitting image of Channing Tatum...).
Highly recommended. Loved it.",1500508800,2,914,5.370629370629371

6302252,5,B002RL8P2U,"Love stories, especially those that are centered around a specific life style group, are very difficult to review.  We all will refer back to our own, either consciously or subconsciously.  This is an experience for a lot of us.  This story line provides a source of information not garnered by a lot by our very sheltered existence during our childhood in preteen and teenage lives.  The front cover of this dvd sums it up just plain perfectly:  ""When Worlds Collide, Only Love Will Survive!""  NJMJr!",1435190400,,501,4.8352941176470585

6302255,4,B002RL8P2U,Nice to see a gay movie that shows people falling in love that's more in line with real life and doesnt show the same worn out plotline  of the young gay chasing after the jock,1432944000,,176,4.0285714285714285
6302256,1,B002RL8P2U,"I thought that this was about two male childhood friends. It turned out to be a homosexual relationship. After his parents were bludgeoned with the fact of his preference, Rag tried to justify his relationship on the basis of the Bible, which is literally impossible. Absolutely nothing in the bible that pertains to relationships justify homosexuality. It does not condemn them nor does it bludgeon them like some people do. But, the bible is about marriage between a man and a woman and no other relationships are allowed. Even courting is to be for marriage. Any relationship between a male and female must be for marriage or celibacy. The Bible is the only book that does not automatically condemn the person involved in ""same sex"" practice as it is impartial to any sin, period. While the movie had a touching line about the separation of two friends, the injection of the homosexual practice was jarring. The viewer was left without knowing whether the feeling about the absence of one from the other was more because of their friendship as young men, or as homosexuals. If the former, then a great story. If the latter, and this is palpably evident, then the viewer is misled into a scripted effort to justify homosexuality despite the God given right of parents to want grand children (Which is also God's desire as stated in Genesis 1:28: be fruitful and multiply (Biologically is the intended reference here, not some infant shopping center with ready made babies). I was very disappointed in this movie. If the makers of such movies is so all right with the public, why won't the makers of these movies clearly label them and they will find out how we feel about them. They would go unwatched. It is my right to reject anything I know to be contrary to God's will. That right was taken from me by a deceptive advertisement for this movie glorifying a homosexual relationship. Shame!!!",1431907200,,1895,4.780487804878049

6302262,5,B002RL8P2U,"This is a great film. LIke most films that have lasting power, the story covers the developing, strengthening, and power of love. It joins my two favorite films, Beautiful Thing and The Wedding Banquet, as a film worth viewing over and over. At times the movie was very tense and at other times slowly relaxed, patient, and comforting. The scenes in Nigeria were particularly nerve wracking with subtle messages and subtexts. I found the acting very believable. The characters possess a hesitancy that I recognize in my own family, and as such they are all the more believable. Additionally, the viewer never really is certain how things will evolve or even if they will. Some people resist change, some people can not change, for some change comes slowly, but for very few is change something to be rushed into. This is a story about all of them. It is a story about a family like mine.  I urge people considering viewing this movie to do so. It is a hidden gem.",1420934400,,963,4.631578947368421

I understand certain production elements could use polish and acting not award winning, but the effort was one of high worth for people far too often counted invisible.  Although uncomplicated, the story could easily be used as a mini series in the reverse of the groundbreaking development of the American movie, Noah's Arc.  I enjoyed how the character warmth developed even as stereotypical obstacles came to the fore. Even the bedroom scene was tender and not over the top. I enjoyed the film immensely.",1417392000,,613,5.12

One of the themes is the struggle that one of the guy faces accepting his true feeling for the other--he has this problem because of his own internalized homophobia and because of the expectations of his overly-religious and controlling father.  I guess we've all been there, so most gay men should be able to relate to the basic plot.

The movie was well done...except for the subtitling.  Interesting that the Nigerian English was subtitled, but the English spoken in England was not.  Often the English in England was much more difficult to understand.

The acting is done so well, that I felt each emotion expressed and the intensity of the love that the two leading characters have for each other. Even after repeated watching, I am left with a sense of calm, peace, and a deeper understanding and appreciation of extraordinary love between two men.

6302313,4,B002RL8P2U,"This movie is a very important production. LGBT life is often portrayed in white male terms. This movie shatters that popular misrepresentation. Yet, it lacks in certain categories. The story surrounding the young boys was woefully underdeveloped. Most of their character development begins in adulthood. As a result, the viewer does not see them as very close childhood friends.

Also, some scenes should have been eliminated. The Nigeria excursion, for example, doesn't seem to serve a real purpose in the film.

On the plus side, the two male characters were intriguing. And they had great chemistry. The love scenes were quite tender.",1321920000,,638,5.245098039215686
6302314,4,B002RL8P2U,ragTAG is a heartwarming love story between childhood friends which bounces between progressive London and homophobic Nigeria where the death penalty for gay male relationships still stands. These beautiful lovers are a delicious chocolate/caramel confection while the African scenes look authentic and offer a tantalizing glimpse into tribal culture. I wish there were more movies (like this) which portray black gay men as real people.,1319328000,,437,5.7384615384615385
6302315,2,B002RL8P2U,"This is a slow moving and very obvious low budget movie. The acting was amateurish by some of the main characters. A lot of tidying up needed to be done, however the plot did develop but was poorly executed leaving a lot of unanswered questions. That being said, as a gay man, I liked that the main characters were masculine (DL if you will)dealing with their feelings and family with love pulling them through it.  The romance between the two main characters was the thread that kept me interested and was pleasantly surprised how it ended, because i assumed that their love was doomed. I liked that one was ordinary looking and the other gorgeous. It was about love and not about both leads being handsome which we see all the time and I'm so tired of. In the real world opposites do attract. With all it's flaws I think this is worth seeing for the message it holds and for attempting to show a part of gay life that is not stereotypical. There was not one finger snapping queen in sight. Tag(the less attractive of the two)was very engaging and believable in his portrayal of his love for Rag, and you saw it every time he looked at him.",1318982400,3,1141,4.433333333333334

6302320,2,B002RL8P2U,"The title of my review is expressing my feeling I had after I had finished watching ""Rag Tag"".
Rag and Tag are two friends, best school mates (same thing in ""Beautiful thing"").
At some point they are being seperated. Then we meet them 10 years later. And then we watch another part of the movie, and another one and then we can see them making love and...back again to another part and the end.
The plot itself wouldn't be so dull, if the director took care of some important details. Which? Actors. Pictures. Sets.
Acting in some parts is soooo wooden that a spark would set the whole thing on the greatest fire of all.
O.K. it is a low cost film, but it cannot justify such simple things like changing the skin color of one of main characters - first both boys are black, then one of them (in the 10 year gap) changes his eyes color to blue and bleach his skin...wth???
Set. No difference between now and then. 10 years is not 10 months.

6302323,5,B002RL8P2U,"I liked this movie very much. I had to watch it twice because it was so good and felt so real. It's not a blockbuster and I think that made it seem more realistic, more genuine. There aren't too many films out there about us Caribbean, African, African American, Afro-latino and other black men, whether in the First, Second or Third World, that try to show the beauty of our love and our negotiation with our relatively homophobic cultures. This one managed to do that pretty well. It surpassed many of my expectations and hopefully it will do the same for you. I saw so much of my friends and myself in this film and it was good to know that someone out there understands. These guys are just everyday guys trying to make a living, make something of themselves and find that special someone. Their love is strong but they don't let it alone define them. That's a sticking point for me on many other films that I've seen. In those films, being with and being attracted to other men becomes a cultural identity, cause for a crusade - it becomes life. That doesn't happen here. It's just not ""Another Gay Movie"", pun clearly intended.
For anyone doing programming with disaffected or abused gay youth, particularly in the populations previously mentioned, you should get this DVD and have them watch. You'll be amazed at what it can do.",1292025600,27,1335,4.589958158995816

Poorly edited(that scene when Rag steps in on Tag and his girlfriend should have been laugh out loud hilarious and emotional crescendo for the entire movie at the same time & the scene with Tag's father before the credits was totally unnecessary and forced. Tag letting his Father know it was he who started this whole roller coaster was all we really needed to close things out.)

This is the kind of movie that provides the true-sense of complicated yet real culture of our lives. It is respectful and somewhat a little envy for me that people can devote their loves in such an innocent, pure, and authentic way, at the same time, it is also completely believable. The film also presents a hope and positivity against todays overall ugliness  judgmental, discriminative, and unequal-ness based on any excuses of believe system.

These young men's love story is told beautifully and authentically from real life African diaspora perspective set in England.  For folks who aren't black and don't have much connection to black folks/African culture, I imagine this movie shows the intense experience of ""coming out while black"" amid the intricacies of black life in a multicultural African setting-Hausa trash talking Igbos, Yoruba's lashing back and a Jamaican sister going in on Nigerians and the Afro-Chinese! The role of religion to condemn and ultimately liberate the boys from homophobia, depiction of the uncondtional love of family the economic struggle, racism and interracial love all make this movie the closest thing I have seen in ""Gay movies"" to the real lived lives of black same gender loving men; and it wasn't full of heavy sex scenes so I can watch it with family if I choose.
