He offers some great practical advice regarding the body mechanics for the therapist.  I love that he appears to love what he's doing and has a generous heart.

(Amazon initially delivered the wrong disc but the return policy is such a breeze to follow and the correct disc was soon on its way and in my hands.)",1332547200,,454,4.369047619047619
