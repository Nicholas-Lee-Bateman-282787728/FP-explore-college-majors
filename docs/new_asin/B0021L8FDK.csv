8349106,1,B0021L8FDK,"It took me a while to watch all five seasons but each set had at least two faulty discs. They would not be recognized by any dvd player. I am very disappointed that i spent over $100 on a a product that was 50% faulty. When i got around to contacting the seller i received no reply, refund or apology. It is a scam that not a single season was 100% playable.",1305590400,,358,3.986111111111111

8349109,4,B0021L8FDK,"Note: this is a general review about the series, not of each individual season.

Make no mistake: this show is basically a glorified soap opera, with much better acting and plots. However, it is pretty funny. The plots get so off the wall sometimes that it becomes hilarious. Each season has a separate story arch that usually involves a murder or somebody's deep, dark secret. Each episode also features a unique story and many plot twists. Things get pretty zany after several seasons. Over the past 5 years, it has included many (many) extramarital affairs, murders, holdups, hurricanes, gang lords, and dead bodies in the freezer. All of which makes for some entertaining TV.",1254614400,7,679,4.956140350877193
