7063028,5,B00UNDGGCK,"Terrific! I bought this after watching it. The really good stuff after the show I thought was on this, but still
This was delightful. I loved Hurley,Christian just came along for the ride for me. I was there for Bobby!
I was stunned to hear he was blue collar. He is the most blue blooded blue collar guy ever!!",1428192000,2,311,4.288135593220339
7063029,5,B00UNDGGCK,"Christian Laettner, bieng one of the most hated players in Collage Basketball, he had an image that people just plainly didn't like. You see more about Laettner, more of his attitude, more of his plays, and more and all that makes you think why was he so hated. Anyways, it's a really good 30 for 30, I suggest you watch it.",1428105600,2,324,4.327868852459017
7063030,4,B00UNDGGCK,"Having attended Duke and having a daughter who had a crush on Christian Laettner,I found this documentary to be very well made and brought back many memories for me. I remember that within seconds of what is still remembered as ""the shot"" I had a phone call from a Russian friend and basketball fan who had been watching the game.
The film shows how inaccurate prejudices creep into our thinking. For one, the idea of Duke students all being posh spoiled kids. Neither of my parents graduated from high school and my father was blue collar. I had to work and borrow to go to Duke.
Two things were left out that should have been in the program. One, when Laettner went off to the Olympics, he was short one hour for graduation. Coach K told him if it wasn't made up by the beginning of the next school year, his jersey would come down and the NCAA banner would come down. Also the story of Bill McCafferty is left out. One of the highest scoring shooting guards at Duke he could not take Laettner's bullying and transferred to Vanderbilt. This should have been covered.",1427500800,6,1068,4.482051282051282

7063032,5,B00UNDGGCK,"Just watched this on ESPN!  Great 30 For 30!  It really captures what some guys must go through just because they're handsome winners who win win win.  You tend to get a lot of haters, I'd bet.  Some people who aren't super handsome and win at sports and marry certain supermodels from that South American country (you know the one wink wink) find it easier just to tear you and Coach down rather than try harder and get handsomer and win at sports and then own your own bunch of mansions.  Since I went to Michigan (Go Blue!), I didn't like Laettner either, but now I'm thinking of calling him up and seeing of he wants to hang out with the Vinny Chase actor guy or watch a Blue Bloods marathon at my LA guest house. G could cook if she has time for me finally.  Great documentary and you might even see a familiar face (or two!) in it ;)",1426377600,3,839,4.180124223602484

8707630,4,B00UNDGGCK,Chronicles the career of Duke college basketball player Christian Laettner. Features his quality play and due to his good play people dislike him. Insightful.,1459728000,,158,5.625
8707631,5,B00UNDGGCK,"Always, always my favorite Blue Devil. This is very accurate of the complicated person that he is, and sheds light on many things that people outside of the fan base did not know about him.

And does anyone else think it's funny that Jalen Rose hated him so much, yet in the 30 for 30 on the Bad Boys, praised Bill Laimbeer, who Laettner reminds me so much of, both on the court and in attitude? Then again, I'm a firm believer that Jalen Rose's biggest fan will always be Jalen Rose.

Regardless, I still love Laettner, hate Kentucky, and will watch this again and again.",1443225600,2,572,4.386792452830188
8707632,5,B00UNDGGCK,"This was such a great 30 for 30.  It brought back so many great memories of the 90s.  It really exposes a lot about our culture--why we hate certain people whom we perceive as ""having it all"".  Laettner was NOT born with a silver spoon in his mouth--he was a brash, tough, talented kid with an incredible work ethic.  He was born to be a winner.  You see that when the film takes you back to his high school championship.  Laettner's team was winning, and, at the final moments, a fight breaks out between the two teams.  Police were needed to break up the fight (of high schoolers!), and there is footage of Laettner being carried off the court by police and friends, with his fist raised high in celebration--sort of a message to the other team.  Like him or hate him, Laettner was the epitome of a tough competitor.  After seeing this documentary, all I can say is, if you went to war, you'd want Laettner in the foxhole with you.",1440892800,4,933,4.377906976744186
