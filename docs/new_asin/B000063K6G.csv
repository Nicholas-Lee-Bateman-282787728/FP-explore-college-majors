The saddle club has lots of adventures! In the movie you get to see a real foal be born! It's a great movie1 You must get it!",1031702400,,278,3.8947368421052633
1691077,1,B000063K6G,"i'm sorry.. but this movie was REALLY BAD!! the actors were good i suppose, but the storyline was bad and they were acting really chilsish, how old are they supposed to be? they look 11 or 12.
i didn't like it",1028937600,,209,4.121951219512195
1691078,3,B000063K6G,"I don't think any of you reviewers have seen the Saddle Club episodes on TV. I wouldn't blame you because you'd have to have digital cable. Anyway, they chose the sad episodes to put in the video, not the good ones. It's still a good movie. I mean, how often would you find a horse movie? I've seen it so many times.",1027555200,,316,4.112903225806452
1691079,4,B000063K6G,"A mean girl, horses, handsome young men, horses, girlfriends, boys, horses--this movie has everything a young girl on the verge of her teenage years could want.
  My daughter discovered this movie last weekend, just after returning home from a combined swimming pool/horseback riding birthday party and right before  uncovering her case of chicken pox. (mild, fortunately.)
  Since we've been encountering some problems with a mean girl in school, the nasty, spoiled rich girl in the story who has nothing kind whatsoever to say to anyone, except when she's trying to manipulate people, held my attention. I confess, I cheered (quietly but vociferously) when she fell off her horse.
  But that's not really the main focus of the movie.
  Here's what this movie, based an Australian TV series, which itself was based on a series of books by Bonnie Bryant--none of which we'd read or even heard of until now-- is about:
  Three likable girls, Stevie, Carol, and Lisa, all try to perfect their riding skills at an Australian riding club while
coping with the nasty Veronica whose stubbornness leads to the
death of her horse, their own changing interests,the impending birth of a foal, various other horse health crises, and the presence of handsome  young fellows who work as stablehands. Oh, and a boy their age who is, in his own fumbling way, trying to figure out how to let one of the girls know that he likes her.
  Carol is still contending with the loss of her mother, a veterinarian whose shoes she'd hoped to fill, though she encounters doubts. Stevie is trying to stay out of
Veronica's way while maintaining her interest in horses, even as some of her friends strike out in other directions and Lisa is just trying to figure out life.
  The girls go through their paces with their horses, try to
 ignore Veronica and her pal, await the arrival of the foal and visit with an old friend whose interests have changed.
 There are moments of bravery and derring-do, a little skulduggery (Veronica just has to do things her way, and the death of her horse slows her down only temporarily), and some rather wise, no-nonsense adults who pop in and out of scenes, offering mostly good advice. Thank goodness there were no truly idiotic adult types that we see so often on TV.

  It is a pretty tame movie overall, but with great appeal to preteen girls. (Preteen boys would rather take out the garbage than watch it, I suspect.) We, or at least the junior person in the house, has seen it six times so far.
  There's nothing untoward in this movie, nothing to keep parents from letting their daughters see it, with the issues of developing friendships and rivalry sure to catch their attention.
  Because of the death of the horse, some younger girls may not want to watch this, though there's no actual death scene. Overall, it's a pleasant enough  story with a few lessons for girls, and a wonderful musical theme called Hello World.",1025308800,26,2935,4.762376237623762
1691080,5,B000063K6G,"I have been an avid reader of the saddle club for years. I went and purchased this DVD today on an impulse buy even though it cost me an arm and a leg. Though it did not stick to the books AT ALL (since when is Veronica caring and since when does Carole have Starlight IN THE FIRST BOOK), the film was humorous, and Judy made it what it was with her line about wishing to be a cat. Also, many of the actors, such as Max, Red, and Jake were EXTREMELY hot, being as they had accents. Also, the song 'Hello World' was simply marvolous, and the DVD had the music video to boot, and it was grand.  On a sidenote, now, many hours after watching the film, we (my friend and I) are making a funfetti pilsberry dough boy cake. It's one in the morning...THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW! Shelia Bee's a really cool girl.",1024963200,2,804,4.1210191082802545
1691081,5,B000063K6G,"After finishing the whole talented Bonnie Bryant Saddle Club series, I just had to have the video! I was very impressed with how accurate the details were and thought that this recreation of about 5 of the books was superb! I have been a faithful reader of The Saddle Club series for atleast 6 years, and I was thrilled that there was a live version of some of the most memorable moments on tape! Not only did the actors do an awsome job, but the horses get equal credit as well!!! I recommend this wonderful movie to anyone who loves horses or is familiar with The Saddle Club series!!!",1024358400,5,587,4.394495412844036
1691082,5,B000063K6G,"Perhaps this video is why there is not a book 102 out? Maybe they just had to take some time off to do this project? Anyways, I hope it covers books 1, 2, and 3. I am probably going to die when Cobalt dies! I am planning on buying this video as soon as it comes out! What a great week next week would be! It would be even better if my baseball team wins Monday (local Pioneer League Baseball starts Monday!), buy this video Tuesday, and hopefully quit work and buy a pool table! Then I can have a party with some friends over to watch this video and play pool! I can't wait!",1024012800,,574,4.0
1691093,5,B000063K6G,i have read alot of the saddle club books so when this movie came out i was sooo happy!!! its an awesome movie for any horselover!!! its a little different then the book but its still awesome! i watched it everday for like a month and i still watch it just about every weekend!! it is a must have for any saddle club fan!,1107388800,4,321,4.03125
1691094,5,B000063K6G,"THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!!! You just got to love it. If you like horses and if you like to laugh, this is your movie! Many of the actors have Australian accents and the movie is corny at times, but it is great like the books. EVEN BETTER! It will make you wish you were part of the Saddle Club. The first day we got it, we watched it over and over. Atleast 3 times! Its one of those kind of movies that you watch over and over until you memorize all the lines!

""I never want to see a stunt like that again Veronica!

I didn't mean to approach so fast Max.

It's a miracle you didn't break your neck or Cobalt's!""

1691095,5,B000063K6G,"My two girls Katrina (2) & Gabrielle (5) loved this movie & music. My husband and I enjoyed this movie as-well. Excellent family movie. Yes, we have horse crazy girls and now all their little friends are into this movie too. I just bought my second movie for a gift for my duaghters friend. It Very hard to find Saddle club items in the USA. We do have both movies and looking forward to the third one.",1081900800,2,402,4.233766233766234
1691096,5,B000063K6G,"I loooooved this movie! I love horses but this had just enough for everyone!
Sophie Bennett was by FAR the best actor in it. She is such a talented little actor! and to the person who said it was too childish and they looked 11 or 12 thats because THEY WERE can you believe that!?
So good
check out Sophie Bennett in some new stuff!",1074902400,,332,4.123076923076923
1691097,2,B000063K6G,"Personally, I really really don't like this movie. It's basically taking bits and pieces of various episodes of the TV show, putting them together and selling it as a movie. It strays far from the books and their acting isn't very good, neither is the riding. It's nice to see a horse movie, and I suppose the special features are TOO terrible, but overall it is not my cup of tea. I suppose younger kids who have never seen the TV series would like it, but I'm not one of them.",1074384000,,478,4.263736263736264
1691098,5,B000063K6G,"The Saddle Club has inspired me and also it made me like horses much more than I used to. They also tell me that a horse is alot of work to take care of. Horses are so much fun but if you get one yourself, it is more than fun, there is work in it to. You also must exercise your horses besides rididng it. There is so much you can do with horses but you must wear the right riding clothes. Loose clothes may get caught on the saddle or the rians. If you get injured or fall off you should get right back on unless you are hurt or you broke a bone. So always get the right proper horseback riding clothes.",1065571200,3,604,3.879032258064516
1691099,5,B000063K6G,"I think that this movie would be an ideal gift for a girl between the ages of 7 and 14. The movie is definitely for an audience that is familiar with the Saddle Club books by Bonnie Bryant although any horse-crazy kid would like it. There are also a lot of boy English riders in the film which is pretty unusual for a horse film. I have shown this film to some of the younger riders that I teach at the barn and they all like it.
There are tons of horse scenes and it deals with a lot of problems that young girls face. I wish that I knew where the stable in the movie was because it is incredible! The film was evidently filmed in England so it's kindof funny to hear the American East-coast (from the books) girls using English terminology with the British accents but overall it was very well done.
Good gift for a kid going to horse camp, taking lessons or discovering their first interest in horses.",1061078400,10,904,4.23121387283237

1691101,5,B000063K6G,"This Horse-crazy movie is the best. I just love the saddle club I'm their biggest fan. I like Stevie the best and I like her horse Belle. But Stevie doesn't ride Belle in this movie. She rides Comannche. If you haven't seen the saddle club serise that's okay I didn't even know about the saddle club untill I got this movie. There is three episodes from the serise all put in one great movie. I asked my two horse-crazy (just like me their horse-crazy too) if they had ever seen the saddle club and they told me they wacth every night on discovry kids. I started wacthing it and I liked it so much I started reading the books too. In the movie Carole (One of the members of the club) is taking care of Veronica's (The mean girl) horse Cobalt. Then Veronica does something so careless that it puts her horse in danger. Then Red's (the stable-hand) friend comes to the stable. Lisa (Other member of the club) gets to ride Prancer a scool horse, but Prancer is acting crazy and doesn't want to do a thing Lisa says and Veronica is tring to get Max (The stable owner) to let her ride Prancer. Phil (A boy who rides at the stables) ask Red's friend to help him with Stevie (Other member of the club) he askes him how to ask a girl out. Then The Saddle Club is getting ready for a faol's birth.",1054857600,8,1288,4.239837398373984
1691102,5,B000063K6G,"If you love horses, this movie is for you. It is GREAT. It's based on a TV show airing in the US, Canada and Australia. I watch the show every night, and I see the movie about 3 times a month. If you are intrested in this series, you can watch it on Discovery Kids.(In the USA) I am the biggest fan of the Saddle Club and I love this movie. This movie got me intrested in horses and I am now taking riding lessons. The movie is great... In conclusion, I give it five stars. It is a great movie.",1046304000,11,494,3.900990099009901
1691103,5,B000063K6G,"I absouletly LoVe this movie. If you love/ride horses, this is your kind of movie. It's about 3 12 year old girls(Lisa, Carole, and Stevie). They all go to a horse stable called Pine Hollow for riding lessons. An accident kills a horse and hurts the owner(Veronica). Then, The dead horse's mate has a baby foal named samson. I'M THE BIGGEST FAN OF THIS MOVIE! If you don't have this movie, you HAVE to buy it.",1043712000,3,409,4.394736842105263
1691104,3,B000063K6G,Overall I liked the movie... it was great to finally see the book series come to life...but... I thought the movie lacked so much and tended to stray FAR away from the books at some points. I myself prefer the books. But overall... a pretty good movie for any horse lover.,1043107200,,272,4.352941176470588
