7805179,4,6300213447,"In this one the crew faces rapid aging like Spock did in Star Trek III. Only in this one it only lasts one episode.  I wonder if the the actors compare the way they look in this and the way they look today.  They are in as old as they were supposed to be in this episode. It's a good overall.  It's a silly concept but has a good gimmick to keep you watching.  I don't see how the process was reversed to keep the crew to their current ages, however it works for Star Trek.",1032134400,,473,3.8958333333333335
