7855451,5,6303926320,Carnivorous plants are fascinating and this presentation accents the differences and similarities among them. The photography is great. The narrative is clear and easy to follow.  Good intro for those not familiar with carnivorous plants.,1344384000,,238,5.8
7855452,4,6303926320,This program made in 1995 is an excellent introduction to plant carnivory. The photography is outstanding as one would expect from the Nature series. The representative plants is by no means complete but certainly adequate to give a good view of the types of carnivorous behavior in plants-- although the word carnivory is a bit of a misnomer it serves it's purpose. The program is a bit melodramatic and certainly plants have no preditory intent (i.e. brain). I guess this was to enthrall the general public- although not needed with these spectacular plants. One other criticism is that the the mechanism for closing the Venus's flytrap is mostly incorrect and the model presented is far outdated from what was even known in 1995. The movement is far more complex than described in this film. However overall it is an excellent introduction and view of the subject.,1270339200,,867,4.945205479452055
7855453,4,6303926320,"I believe I first saw this video back in my 9th grade science class in the early 80s.  The video alone wasn't responsible for my fascination with carnivorous plants (CPs), but it certainly helped.  I've long since added it to my collection of CP reference materials, and it's still probably the best video I've seen of these amazing plants in action.

There are endless shots of venus flytraps snapping shut, and time lapse videos of sundews curling around their prey.  There's some amazing underwater views of Aldrovanda closing on water fleas, and incredible slow-motion scenes of bladderworts sucking in tiny water bugs in less than a 1,000th of a second.  I was also impressed with the video of a pitcher plant capturing a wasp with surprising quickness, something that never fails to amaze me.  And the microscopic photography of the inner surfaces of the pitcher plant was incredible.

Unfortunately, the plants profiled were not well-representative of CPs in general.  Venus flytraps are a given, of course, but Roridula and it's Assassin bugs seemed an odd choice.  The sundew coverage was seriously limited but decent, but no mention of butterworts is made.  Also, the short pitcher plant shown, Sarracenia purpurea, isn't very characteristic of the whole genus, most of which are tall varieties.  The reason was likely the ease of filming in the smaller plant, but it would have been more accurate to portray the variety, perhaps showing the stunning white trumpet, which I believe is nature's version of a 'glow-in-the-dark' CP.  Other pitcher plants like Nepenthes, Heliamphora, and Cephalotus are only shown a couple of times with barely a mention, but nothing whatsoever of Darlingtonia and it's fake ""windows.""  And footage of mosquitoes was much longer than necessary, as well as a rather disgusting montage of various mouths munching on plants, including one very bearded human mouth uncomfortably close-up.

I was also disappointed that the focus seemed to be on portraying the plants as bizarre and creepy, rather than showing how beautiful and fascinating they are.  The weird soundtrack throughout serves to push this, masking any indication that many of these plants have flowers as beautiful as orchids, with incredible foliage to boot.  They could have discussed the important role CPs have in an ecosystem or Darwin's fascination with and ideas on their evolution, although the description of how a flytrap closes was helpful.  Overall, a lot of nice photography - perhaps the best available - but falls short in really teaching about the plants.",1218585600,,2571,5.156626506024097
7855454,3,6303926320,"CPs, as we who collect these magnificent plants call them, are an aquired passion and I think it must take someone who really appreciates these wonders of nature to make them come to life.
At 57 minutes I wasn't  expecting a huge overview of carnivorous plants but here the focus is  entirely on the trapping of prey. It appears the producers, Oxford  Scientific Films, and the writers were looking to disgust and amaze the  uninitiated instead of actually discussing the plants themselves; to have  done so would have made a vastly more intriguing video and perhaps enticed  viewers to appreciate the unique role these plants (far too many  endangered) play in their ecosystems.
Focusing extensively on dionea,  sarracenia (purpurea-only), utricularia, and, to some degree, roridula and  aldrovanda, this video only gives a few seconds to the genus nepenthes,  genlisea, cephalotus (which they only show in relation to, of all things, a  bear trap!), heliamphora, and completely neglects pingulicula, byblis,  genlisea, cephalotus, and the magnificent triphyophyllum.
If these  scientific names mean nothing to you then you understand my problem with  this video as it certainly won't teach them to you either.
Yes there is  the usual spectacular photography which is the hallmark of the Nature  series and the electon microscope photographs of the inner walls of  sarracenia are something you won't see anywhere else. Magnificent,  highly-magnified scenes of utricularia and aldrovanda at work are equally  spectacular and without question qualify this video for the CP enthusiast's  library--but little else will.
When I think of what this video COULD have  been I am greatly saddened. There are plants far more interesting and  spectacular (save maybe dionea) then the few species illustrated here If  the director hadn't spent ridiculous amounts of time lingering on the  various traps at work over and over ad nauseum, including (inexplicably)  the hatching of a mosquito! No mention is made of the scientific history of  the plants or Charles Darwin or their evolution. It's all gore and guts,  yeah baby! Let's not even mention the odd ""spacey"" syntho-music  (ca. 1986) which sounds like a reject from a sci-fi themed porno film.
To  illustrate the problem the overview of roridula tells us roridula is not  carnivorous but that assassin bugs do populate the plant without hazard.  The video neglects to mention that the assassin bugs excerete waste which  the plant then absorbs thus creating a true symbiotic relationship. A much  more obvious and fascinating example of this is the relationship between  golden ants and a tropical pitcher plant species but since the video barely  shows a few shots of the tropical pitcher plants, the viewer will never  know.
Excellent photography, detailed explanations of trapping mechanisms  in the few genus which it covers, and very good narration redeem  ""Death Trap"" to some extent but for a real eye-opener get Peter  D'Amato's ""The Savage Garden"" (also available from amazon.com).  Even if you have no intention of growing carnviorous plants this book will  pull you in and delight you with impossibly fantastic stories of the REAL  lives of these vegetable predators.",958608000,8,3222,5.24950884086444
