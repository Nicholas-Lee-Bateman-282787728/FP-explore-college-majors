8266420,2,B0017LGCP8,I expected a review of the operations of this ship with views of different areas and functions.  A few interviews with officers and crew would have been helpful.  This was a few rehashed stock images from the Naval archives with no dialogue. Disappointing.,1414540800,,256,4.930232558139535
