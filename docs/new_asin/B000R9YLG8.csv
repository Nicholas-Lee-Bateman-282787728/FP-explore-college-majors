2863048,1,B000R9YLG8,"On June 27 it's predicted that Guestar57 will ""rave"" on this bad movie, then on July 14 Guestar57 does! Is this enough proof for any doubters that Asylum makes bad movies and writes positive reviews in an effort to fool people???",1184716800,5,229,4.609756097560975

Starring : Erica Roby/Directed by Justin Jones
So,There is this modeling agency where people change their moods because of a Ginger Root ?
Erica Roby has a steamy romance with a two-timing older guy.
Couple points -this guy likes it rough and Erica takes a licking and keeps on ticking AND She could be Demi Moore 2.0
Hey,How come there is ONLY 3 male actors and Everyone else is female and maybe lesbian...Oops forgot WHY I was complaining...Hot,Hot,Hot !
Marat Glaser does a great job as almost hero,Not plot spillage here.
The pacing was awesome and tight editing by Kristen Quintrall.
The ending oozed suspense and totally blindsided this critic .",1184371200,3,664,4.9375
2863050,1,B000R9YLG8,"I bet guestar57 will soon write a positive review here, I guess the Invasion of the Body Snatchers remake (Invasion) must be set to come to theaters soon. Dont be fooled by this garbage.",1182902400,5,186,4.5
2863061,1,B000R9YLG8,"Just terrible!  What a horrible movie.  The actresses must have volunteered to do this one...I wouldn't have paid them a dime.  The audio was horrific.  The background sound was much louder than the dialogue.  Then again, perhaps it was done deliberately.  The script was even worse than the acting.  Don't waste your time...even if someone gives you this for nothing.  What an insult to the sci-fi genre.",1328832000,,405,4.940298507462686
2863062,1,B000R9YLG8,"This is another 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' film, only done with poor acting and a muddled plot - with some topless nudity thrown in to keep some interest.

Melissa (Erica Roby) works with a supervisor who is mean to her. When her supervisor Casey (Amanda Ward) starts coming on to her Melissa suspects something has changed.

It's not then highly convincing that she would go to bed with her boss.

Women who have 'changed' offer a small plant as a gift to other women. The plant replicates the women. They don't seem to emerge from any pod - despite the cover-art. At best they might be in some kind of membrane.

What's then silly is that they have to kill the original in a rather haphazard way - the only time this is shown the replicant beats the original up.

It's not explained why they offer the plant particularly to women (rather than to men, especially as one is given the plant at the end of the film).",1322784000,,920,4.420118343195266
2863063,3,B000R9YLG8,"Picked this up in a 10-movie pack for five bucks at K-Mart.

Is it classic sci-fi? No. Is it a very good movie? Hardly.

But I look at it this way: 50 cents for a flick about an alien ginger plant that turns mean girls into sex-starved, naked lesbians? Oh, yeah, K-Mart, here's my four bits. Can't buy me a Hershey bar for that anymore.

Gotta admit, I find a certain charm to The Asylum's ""mockbuster"" movies. They remind me of my childhood, when I'd read ""Cinemagic"" magazine and make my own ""Star Wars"" films on Super-8. Terrible, to be sure, but made with a modicum of love and reverence for the source material.

In rare cases, Asylum's movies are actually better than those they're aping. I'll take ""Allan Quartermain and the Temple of Skulls"" any day over the incomprehensible ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" And while the first ""Aliens Vs. Predator"" was good in a comic book sort of way, ""AVP: Requiem"" didn't make a lick of sense. Asylum's ""AVH: Alien Vs. Hunter,"" starring aged stoner William Katt, was far more enjoyable. And who'da thunk Asylum's martial arts version of ""I Am Legend"" -- titled ""I Am Omega"" and starring that dude from ""Iron Chef"" -- would be as charming as it is? Not me, brother. But it's now my second favorite version of the story, next to Vincent Price's classic ""The Last Man on Earth.""

For the record, I'm not some Asylum company suit posting fake positive reviews, and I acknowledge the vast majority of Asylum's output is crapola. I'm just some guy who appreciates bad movies, and The Asylum tends to make more of those than anyone else. And as long as K-Mart keeps selling them for 50 cents, I'm gonna keep buying them.",1322524800,,1681,4.571428571428571
2863064,5,B000R9YLG8,ITS NEW BUT REMINDS ME OF THE MOVIE INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS  THE POD WAS DIFFERENT IN THIS THEN  THE BODY SNATCHERS  BUT THE STORY SEEMED LIKE A REMAKE AGAIN,1290038400,,164,4.225806451612903
2863065,1,B000R9YLG8,"Wow, this is one amazingly bad movie.  For starters, the whole movie has a yellowish or greenish tint.  The music is limited to not much more than a few drones, ambient noise, and sound effects.  The characters are mean, cruel, and shallow witches.  The sex is gratuitous and not worth watching.  The script may have looked good on paper, or maybe not.  It definitely does not look good on screen.

The lesbian aspect could have been explored more effectively and convincingly.  Why are the pod-people in human form become only lesbian?  Why bother with sex if pod-people reproduce with, ummmm, pods?  Also, the males may be unnecessary in the pod-person world, but why are the human males affected?  Gratuitous nudity and sex is the only thing that makes sense.

The footage all looks like a bad 1970s Hong Kong movie.  Boring framing and composition, predictable and static transitions, etc.  Boring, boring, boring.",1279065600,,918,4.953947368421052
2863066,1,B000R9YLG8,"I saw this movie advertised in SFBC for $9.99.  I have always been a fan of the body snatcher movies, so I decided to try it out.  It's not worth the $9.99 price let alone the higher price advertised here.  I almost turned it off after 5 minutes into the movie.  It was a long 80 minutes that I could have done something else.  The new pod people seemed to become lesbians after the transformation, if they were women, but even these scenes were horrible.  I wished I had read the reviews here beforehand.",1277769600,,505,4.319148936170213
2863067,1,B000R9YLG8,"Everyone is right - there is almost nothing redeeming in this movie.  Acting, plotline, props etc. are just bad.  And who knew Ginger plants could metamorphise into an exact duplicate of a human?  I just thought they were good with sushi.

But I found myself following this movie.  Wondering when the next person would be taken over.  There is gratious sex and not excessive but I still thought it was as expected in a grade C movie.  There were some points that made me actual worry about a character - hard to ever say you were scared - and I did want the main heroine to escape if for no other reasons than to take more acting lessons.

I also agree with the person who referred to them as ugly models.  Considering the reputation some of these women were supposed to have - the looked like second-runs from some old porn movie.",1211241600,4,831,4.4144736842105265
2863068,4,B000R9YLG8,"A new twist on the Bodysnatcher films.  This time the switched personality is a polar opposite of the original.  The action centers around a confused modeling agency.  Strange plants that look like ginger root are the catalyst for the invasion.  Some of the models figure out what is going on and do their best to avoid the pod people and being replaced by one.
This one becomes funny due to the budget.  Using the ginger root is one way.  Another is that the top model in the business is rather ugly.  The agency seems to have a man in charge as he keeps calling meeting and looking like the boss but another woman, who is subordinate to him in the meetings, seems to be the boss.  We really don't see any pod transformations.  Random sex scenes eat up time.  The agency offices make no sense with the downstairs obviously being right under the roof and the upstairs looking like a livingroom.  The main offices are very industrial looking as if filmed in a boiler room.  All in all an entertaining film even if the humor aspects seem unintentional.  Better than Full Moon's Pod People.  Nothing too serious her but a bit of fun.  Check it out.",1205280000,2,1145,4.490291262135922
2863069,1,B000R9YLG8,"The asylum is back at it with another dreadful rip off. For those who don't know The Asylum is a B-Movie production studio which is making a low budget imitation of many theatrical big budget movies. Such movies include The Omen, Transformers, King Kong, The DaVinci Code, Snakes on a Plane and this one which is a rip off The Invasion (the one starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig). Some of the rips off are viewable but this one is horrendously bad. Not even the credits are good that's how bad the movie is.

The plot is sort of similar to that of The Invasion, alien life form arrives and begins to find a host in order to live. Only difference here is that instead of falling a sleep and becoming one of them, the host becomes a clone of the real person. As soon as they are in full form they kill the original. Funny thing is that all the hosts are female and they all turn into lesbians for some unexplained reason. Trust me the cover may seem scary and creepy but the movie is the complete opposite. Interestingly they try to add a plot twist which is quite laughable. If you're a freak and enjoy watching naked aliens turning into lesbians with a movie that has no real plot go ahead and nock yourself out and buy it. But if you're like me and want to watch something credible look elsewhere this is not for you this is garbage.

8199769,1,B000R9YLG8,"Sadly, we're unable to give ""0"" stars, which is exactly what this turrrd fest deserves. To call this a horror film is insulting. It's Skinamax type crud with the most atrocious acting I've seen in a long time. Horrible looking and sounding cast who have no business being in front of a camera, including the lead who looks thinks she's playing it like Demi Moore. The story isn't even interestingly clichd, it's just a poor excuse for this tax write off of a film produced by the schlock junk makers at The Asylum. This has to the single worst of their films, certainly the lowest in terms of budget and production. The dialogue rips off the superior 1993 cult classic ""Body Snatchers"" so many times with ""Where you gonna go"" references.. The climax was so terrible, I finally turned it off before the final 20 minutes..I figured I had to get something back from this crap fest.. I pitty da fool that buys this new thinking they're in for a great good bad flick. It's just bad..annoyingly bad. MST3K, where are you!?!?!?!?!",1458950400,,1023,4.626373626373627

I was wrong.

It's long scenes of droning dialogue framing a few glimpses of a lesbian orgy.  If the dialogue and orgy were supposed to be horrors, then the movie succeeded.",1387584000,,240,4.666666666666667

8199774,1,B000R9YLG8,"If you really do have a need to see female breasts, this movie will give you a few minutes of  gratification. There appear to be no other reasons why anyone would invest the cost of the movie in order to watch it.  If you do want to buy it, for eight dollars and change (at this date) Amazon price will send you a copy along with nine other films, nearly all better than this one.

When her friends and co-workers begin to act strangely, Melissa becomes suspicious of their behavior and what is causing it. What she ends up discovering may be something that is way beyond her control. That's what sums up the plot of Invasion of the Pod People.

I'll admit, this is pretty much a blatant rip-off of Invasion of the Body Snatchers if I ever saw it. Course, if you're one of the reviewers here, you've pretty much made that assumption. Course, for what is, it's a dadgum GOOD blatant rip-off. I rather enjoyed the movie..despite all the sex scenes and girl-on-girl action(which this movie really didn't need).

The writers needed to work on the script abit and the actresses could have put on better performances...this much is true. It could've been way better.

Yet, again- for an Asylum movie & a decent time-waster, Invasion of the Pod People isn't too bad.",1366588800,,948,4.698795180722891

Well worth the low amount it sells for on line.",1356912000,,345,4.476190476190476
