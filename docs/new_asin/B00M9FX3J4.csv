6564981,1,B00M9FX3J4,"i really should have read the 1 star reviews. these do not seem like they were professionally done. 2 of the discs don't play and the quality is what you can get on youtube (if not better). hence, the moral of the story is read all the reviews on the product, not just the 1st ones that come up. i ordered some bowery boys dvds from the WB archives and they played flawlessly. do not buy, goto youtube and watch them there.",1486080000,4,423,4.170731707317073
