2495437,4,B000E5KQM8,"I certainly missed KITT that can become a faster car when going into Super Pursuit mode and using the Emergency Brake to stop at high speeds of 300 MPH.  Then there's his convertible look, which never returned midway through and viewers probably wanted more of the open roof at the show's beginning.",1138492800,4,299,4.75
2495438,4,B000E5KQM8,"I admit that 4th season isn't the greatest of the show, and it certainly has it's dorky moments, but it's still fun to watch and it's still Knight Rider at heart.  True fans will buy this regardless, and new fans should watch this just to finish up the show.

I buy many many DVDs, some I question afterwards, but I've never doubted Knight Rider for a moment.",1138060800,10,359,4.343283582089552
2495439,2,B000E5KQM8,"It's amazing what a season makes. The third season was by far the best of the series, but the fourth was the worst. The storylines were boring and the addition of Super Pursuit Mode made the show look cheesy and stupid (though the function did look cool in the dark). There were many episodes in which K.I.T.T's major functions (turbo boost, super pursuit mode, eject left/right) were hardly, if at all used. I recommend Season three, followed by a tie for Seasons 1 and 2.",1137715200,8,473,4.576470588235294

2495479,5,B000E5KQM8,This is the fourth and final season for Knight Rider.  In this season KITT loses the molecular bonded shell and gets a new system that allows the car to go faster than before and modifies the configure of the car that allow for the added speed and has a braking system to accommodate the new speed.  Also Michael celebrates his birthday and gets married to Stevie Mason but also he loses someone close to him which causes him to leave the Foundation to catch the person and has to struggle whether to go back or not.  Michael even deals with voodoo and a Japanese cult.  He also has a new comrade to help out in the field and is shown driving the Foundation mobile base in several episodes.  This is a great addition to anyone who likes Knight Rider and is a must to add to the collection.,1455926400,,789,4.304054054054054

2495574,4,B000E5KQM8,"Not my favorite season but an absolute necessity to have if you're a die hard fan like me. Overall it's more of the same formula you've seen in previous seasons: Michael and K.I.T.T travel from town to town solving local problems. Random people act comically surprised when they discover that a car can talk. Occasionally K.I.T.T will have a humorous side story where someone tries to steal him or perhaps an animal gets too close to him and he's forced to scold it in his all to proper way. Michael saves a potential love interest whom he'll most likely never see again and then he drives away into the sunset.

This season introduced RC3, an urban vigilante/mechanic type character meant to inject a hint of youthfulness and diversity. I wasn't a fan. They also added ""super pursuit mode"" to K.I.T.T's bag of tricks. Basically it was a poorly designed, evolutionary advancement which caused several tacky wings and spoilers to pop out of awkward places on K.I.T.T. that would allow him to go faster or glide on water or whatever deus ex machina was needed that week. Conceptually it was a sound idea, visually it just made K.I.T.T. look goofy and less efficient.

Sadly all of the desperate attempts to generate new interest into the Knight Rider formula was not enough to save it from cancellation and if KNIGHT RIDER 2000 was any indication maybe it was best it ended here.  The DVD quality is as good as you'd expect and I'm not a historian but I think all the correct music tracks that should be there are there. Wish there were more bonus content, interviews, bloopers or behind the scenes as these sets are always light on this stuff but whatever.",1419897600,,1655,4.680412371134021

When I stream from Netflix the quality isn't the best so I assumed DVD would be better quality... I was wrong. For the price I could pay for 3 months of Netflix which has better quality and all the knight rider seasons.

2495765,5,B000E5KQM8,Overall I loved this season. some tweaks to KITT's appeal and a few new looks such as Super pursuit mode and covertable mode. Only issue is when they moved away from core characters by introducing RC and then not knowing what to do with him. Well worth the price however.,1242000000,2,271,4.44

The introduction of ""RC3"" is lame and the  ""enhancements"" to KITT are silly looking and aren't as convincing as the other gadgets from the previous seasons.

This season is definitely great in wrapping up the show but it could have gone on for a few more seasons. A lot happens in this season: Michael Knight gets married, K.I.T.T. nearly becomes destroyed and a new central character is added to the show. If you have watched the first three seasons of Knight Rider, then you must watch the Fourth and Final Season of Knight Rider!",1206316800,2,504,4.489130434782608

For me, it was a travel down memory lane, I remember watching the episodes when they first came out when I was younger and in school. And now, to be able to share them with him, and to see his face when K.I.T.T. and Michael did their thing on the screen was just awesome.

At times, the acting was bad, the stunts weren't great, the effects were bad, but you can overlook it all, because this is a part of history. This show takes you back to a time when there were actually still decent shows on television. Not all the crap that's on TV now.",1204675200,2,660,4.116279069767442

So they could introduce hip youngsters.  That isn't why I watched the show, thank you.  And it IS why I STOPPED watching the show.  When it was cancelled, it was a mercy.  I was embarrassed for KITT and Michael.

One man can make a difference turned into a herd.

The only reason I'll buy this season is that I like to have complete sets, even if I don't watch them.

While watching I found a lot of equipment visable in the shot, things that just made it seem, they knew it was the final season, and they just didn't care.",1179100800,2,400,4.569444444444445
2495807,5,B000E5KQM8,"It would be ""The day television died"" and that day occurred when Knight Rider ended after four emotionally taxing seasons. The premise of the show was simple enough, a man was paired with a car that could talk. At that point, I don't think anyone thought the show would redefine television as we knew it. No one had any idea that the man paired with the car would be played by David Hasselhoff. One simple casting decision turned the world of television into a medium that once again mattered. Hasselhoff took scripts that, to be honest, left a little to be desired and turned them into the most important memories of my life. I really believed that the Hoff and this car were on the same wavelength. Crime had no chance. I think if President Reagan would have simply produced several thousand KITTs and cloned Hasselhoff, the war and drugs and crime in general would have been defeated.

Season four is a tough one to review because it was the last season of the greatest show of all time. When thinking about season four, one tends to get caught up in the emotion of it all. I laugh some, cry a lot and even have explosive bowel movements. The show is such an important part of my life. I remember my first date when I brought Laura back to my place for some Knight Rider and pizza rolls. I had my replica Michael Knight jacket on and made my hair look just like Hoff. I even started talking to her as if she was KITT. Needless to say, I had a good night and had to break her heart a month later. When you roll like the Hoff, as I did and still do, you can't be tied down to one ladyfriend. You're like a cheetah that just needs to get out and run. If I'm a cheetah, Hoff is a rhino. He's massive and has a horn.

I could go on and on, but I'm tearing up writing this because it was the end of the road. If average is small pizza, I'm an all you can eat italian buffet and Hasselhoff is the whole restaurant.",1178496000,3,1910,4.201634877384196
2495808,3,B000E5KQM8,I always like watch Knight Rider when i was younger. Iwas glad when I found the series on DVD and I went ahead and puchased the complete collection.

2495809,4,B000E5KQM8,"Watching this last season, you'll see a gradual decline in plots and quality in the show.  There are a few gems in this season, and anyone who is a serious Knight Rider fan will pick it up.

I had a great deal of problems with playback of the first three seasons.  Getting a copy that didn't skip on a disk or two was near impossible.  This season played through correctly on every episode.  I have 5 DVD players which are made by various vendors, so its not me.  (3 are computers)

I've had better luck with DVD sets from Amazon than with those purchased through local retailers.  I've only had problems with Universal Studios.

The first two part season opener is one of my favorites.  Devon is impersonated while kit is rebuilt in Chicago.  Super persuit mode is a bit corny, but RC3 and Bonnie are actually rather interesting at the beginning of the season.  The last episode with the vodoo plot is very bad.  I doubt I'll be watching that episode again for some time.",1168473600,2,972,4.454545454545454

2495851,1,B000E5KQM8,I'm really dissapointed on how Universal Studios has done this Dvd set. First of all the episode summary and the buttons on each episode are missing which doesn't happen in previous seasons. The teasers in 2 episodes in disc 2 are missing. Some sound effects in premiere episode are missing. Universal screwed up again giving the worst tranfer a fan can get. The featurette inclued in the set is a retrospective in 80's Universal Tv Shows. The package says that a lot of actors that appeared in the episodes would be there. Not any of them. Only David Hasselhoff appears. The season has a promising premiere a nice ep where KITT's bonder shell is deactivated as Devon's held captive and he reveals the formula so a destabilizer is created. The Juggernaut a battering ram vehicle almost destroys KITT.Thanks to Chicago's RC3 and a crew of mechanics KITT is back to live. But the new one is a insult to the original. The cabrio function and mostly the Super Pursuit Mode and EBS make the show very chessy. Even the Turbo Boost is better. And sadly is not used more. The following eps lack interest and are very formulaic and based only in plain characters. Other thing is the presence of the RC3 character. A trusted sidekick to help Michael and KITT but he is really a pain in the ass and his Chicago accent doesn't makes any good. Famous presence in the eps are by Don King the boxing promoter and Freddy Kruger Robert Englund in a villain role in his KIELS era. A really pity that the season didn't work mainly to the SPM.Even Bonnie doesn't appear in last ep the worst of all.,1146441600,4,1578,4.540350877192982

2495853,2,B000E5KQM8,"I've enjoyed this series for a long time and I was excited about finally completing my collection with Season 4 last week.  Then I find as I'm watching the discs for the first time that Disc 3 Side 1 will not play all of the episodes.  I tried and was finally successful to get episode 18 (Knight Flight to Freedom) to play on a second dvd player I have, but I was never able to get episode 19 (Fright Knight) to play on any of 3 different dvd players.  I checked that side of the disc and found that it doesn't look right.  The best I can describe it as is speckled with little dots across the side and it almost seems like something was spilled on it in the stamping or packaging process.  I don't know if this is a problem on more than just my set, but you should check your discs and make sure they all play as soon as you buy this set.  I am now in the process of exchanging this defective set and apparently I need to cross my fingers and hope that my replacement set does not have the same or worse defects.",1144800000,4,1014,4.045
2495854,4,B000E5KQM8,"This 1985-86 Season of KNIGHT RIDER was great as well as being the season when KITT gets Super Pursuit Mode and when RC3(Peter Parros)joins the Foundation along with the fact that this DVD box set shows us each 4th Season episode complete & uncut like they were originally shown to us on NBC, not the way they were shown in reruns when KNIGHT RIDER was on Cozi-TV, USA, WGN, Sci-Fi Channel, TV Land,  which butchered too many scenes & added too many commercial interruptions, but this DVD box set has them all commercial-free as well as uncut.

This Fourth Season DVD takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC had moved KNIGHT RIDER back to Friday nights permanently followed by MIAMI VICE at 10PM after showing KNIGHT RIDER at 9PM as part of NBC's Friday night line-up and also takes me back to my childhood memories when AIRWOLF was on CBS every Saturday night since AIRWOLF was in competition with KNIGHT RIDER at the time as well, but chances are the producers reason for deciding to upgrade KITT again in this 1985-1986 Season by adding Super Pusuit Mode and a Convertible was probably to beef up competition with AIRWOLF & STREET HAWK, since STREET HAWK had already stole KNIGHT RIDERs thunder when it made its debut on ABC in the Winter of 1985 along with the fact that AIRWOLFs turbo speed feature & STREET HAWKs hyperthrust feature had topped KITT's speed big time, but when they added the Super Pursuit Mode feature to KITT, KITT's speed seemed almost identical to AIRWOLF's turbo speed, except KITT did AIRWOLF's kind of speed by land and on ground instead of up in the air, but KITTs Super Pursuit Mode was still slower than STREET HAWKs hyperthrust power.

However, I distinctly recall that KNIGHT RIDER still got better ratings than AIRWOLF did along with the fact that this show had outlasted both AIRWOLF & STREET HAWK since KNIGHT RIDER lasted for 4 whole years on NBC, AIRWOLF only lasted 2 1/2 years on CBS with the exception of AIRWOLF's resurrected series on USA in the Winter of 1987 with a totally new cast & crew, and STREET HAWK only lasted 3 1/2 months with only 13 episodes on ABC before its permanent cancellation in June of 1985.

Unfortunately, this 1985-1986 Season was also the season when the ratings went sour and ended up in cancellation after showing it's final episode in April of 1986.

In addition, Universal could have done a better job on this KNIGHT RIDER-Season 4 DVD by providing a summary description of each episode before starting it along with the original air-date each episode like Universal did with the first 3 seasons of KNIGHT RIDER DVD's or they could've at least put down the original air-date next to the summary outside of the DVD case next to the episode summary description like Warner Bros. did with the CHiPs DVD's and all THE DUKES OF HAZZARD's DVD box sets.

For instance, the original air-dates to all these 1985-1986 Season episodes were
9/20/85-KNIGHT OF THE JUGGERNAUT
9/27/85-KITTNAP
10/18/85-SKY KNIGHT
10/25/85-BURIAL GROUND
11/1/85-THE WRONG CROWD
11/8/85-KNIGHT STING
11/15/85-MANY HAPPY RETURNS
11/29/85-KNIGHT RACER
12/6/85-KNIGHT BEHIND BARS
12/13/85-KNIGHT SONG
1/3/86-THE SCENT OF ROSES
1/10/86-KILLER K.I.T.T.
1/17/86-OUT OF THE WOODS

2/14/86-HILLS OF FIRE
2/21/86-KNIGHT FLIGHT TO FREEDOM
3/7/86-FRIGHT KNIGHT
3/14/86-KNIGHT OF THE RISING SUN
4/4/86-VOODOO KNIGHT(aka the final episode)

I also enjoyed seeing the reclusive Michael(David Hasselhoff) reuniting with his ex-fiancee Stevie Mason(Catherine Hickland)one last time in ""The Scent Of Roses"" episode before Stevie died off at Michael's short-lived wedding which turns into a funeral instead towards the end of that episode, which was quite touching since Michael was about to resign from the Foundation after nearly dying from a near fatal confrontation with a relentless criminal mastermind(Aharon Ipale), but then Michael assures us at the end of ""The Scent Of Roses"" episode that he wasn't leaving the foundation after all since his marriage plans went belly-up with a tragic ending by telling KITT that they will be going home straight home to the Foundation, indicating that Michael will be resuming his job with KITT and the Foundation after all with many more missions to come, starting with the ""Killer KITT"" episode, which was the following episode shown after ""The Scent Of Roses"" original air date on NBC along with the fact that this DVD didn't even provide the previews to the ""Knight Song"" episode or ""The Scent Of Roses"" episode either since Universal had decided to delete those scenes for some reason.

It was also interesting seeing guest stars like
*Real-life famous magician(Lance Burton)in the ""Deadly Knightshade"" episode

*Former heavyweight champion(Ken Norton)in the ""Redemption Of A Champion"" episode

*The late Pat Buttrum in the ""Fright Knight"" episode after his co-starring days as the shoddy ,oily salesman(Mr. Haney) on GREEN ACRES

*Robert Pine in the ""Burial Ground"" episode after his co-starring days as Ponch & Jon's hard-nosed superior officer(Sgt. Getraer)on CHiPs.

*Mary-Beth Evans making a second guest starring role on this show in the ""Deadly Knightshade"" episode after previously guest starring in the ""White-Line Warriors"" episode before her co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL and her co-starring days as Kayla on DAYS OF OUR LIVES

*Former heavyweight boxers Jerry Quarry, Carlos Palomino, Danny Lopez, & boxing promoter(Don King)doing a cameo appearance in the ""Redemption Of A Champion"" episode

*Henry Darrow in the ""Knight Of A Thousand Devils"" episode during his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA and after his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL

*Robert Englund in the ""Fright Knight"" episode during his Freddy Krueger days in the A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET flicks.

*Peter Mark-Richman in the ""Many Happy Returns"" episode during his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA

*Peter Mac Lean in the ""Out of the Woods"" episode after his co-starring days on DAYS OF OUR LIVES

*Norman Burton in the ""Redemption Of A Champion"" episode after his co-starring days as Diana Prince's boss from the IADC(Joe Atkinson)

*Leann Hunley in the ""Fright Knight"" episode after her co-starring days on DYNASTY and before her co-starring days on DAYS OF OUR LIVES

*Peter Brown in the ""Knight Behind Bars"" episode before his co-starring days on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS and on THE BOLD & THE BEAUTIFUL

The truth is even though KNIGHT RIDER's 4th Season was the most upgraded season of them all throughout KNIGHT RIDERs whole 1982-86 run on NBC, it was also the worst season of them all for KNIGHT RIDER too since this was the season when the show ran out of steam especially since the Fourth Season was a lot less convincing than the first 3 seasons of this show which caused the show to obviously get phonier & phonier which resulted in NBC cancelling the show in the Summer of 1986 around the same time CBS had cancelled AIRWOLF since fewer & fewer people kept watching KNIGHT RIDER by the Winter of 1986 when this show suddenly took a major nose-dive & became obvious that this show wasn't going in the right direction since the last 11 episodes of this series weren't as good nor as sophisticated as the first 10 episodes of the Fourth Season were either since Michael and KITT started using Super Pursuit Mode & even the convertible feature less and less in the second half of this season of KNIGHT RIDER almost as if KITT was going back to just being the Supercar with the new dashboard with no Super Pursuit Mode like he was in the 3rd Season, which I'm sure is another reason why this show went downhill all of the sudden and lost its touch along with the fact that the ""Knight Of The Rising Sun"" episode was the actual last episode when Michael and KITT used Super Pursuit Mode, since they didn't use SPM in the ""Redemtion Of A Champion"" episode, ""Knight Of 1,000 Devils"" episode, ""Knight Flight To Freedom"" episode, the ""Fright Knight"" episode, or the ""Voodoo Knight"" episode, which by the way was the last and final episode of this show before NBC cancelled KNIGHT RIDER as well as the worst episode of them all on top of that.

In fact, ""Redemption Of A Champion"" was the first episode of this 4th Season when they started showing more episodes where they didn't use Super Pursuit Mode at all or even the convertible feature, which was almost like KITT was in the 3rd Season before KITT even had Super Pursuit Mode, but I also noticed that ""The Scent Of Roses"" episode was when they started using SPM a lot less often, since they had stopped using Super Pursuit Mode more than once per episode in the second half of the Fourth Season, starting with ""The Scent Of Roses"" episode, since the ""Knight Behind Bars"" episode was the very last episode when Michael & KITT used SPM more than once in the same episode, which I think was another reason why this show tanked after KNIGHT RIDER's 4th year run on NBC.

Therefore, you could say that KNIGHT RIDER-Season 4 was pretty much the rise and fall of this show since the ratings on this show were sinking drastically to an all-time low along with the fact that this 1985-86 Season was also it's final and least successful season of them all throughout KNIGHT RIDER's whole 4-year run on NBC since the show was dying especially since the premiere of newer shows like STREET HAWK & AIRWOLF were too closely related to KNIGHT RIDER giving viewers too much of the same thing every weekend by giving people too much competition & redundancy since CBS already had AIRWOLF on Saturdays, ABC had STREET HAWK on Fridays, and NBC had KNIGHT RIDER on Sundays, plus all 3 of those Universal high-tech TV shows had all premiered too soon after one another since KNIGHT RIDER made its debut in the Fall of 1982, AIRWOLF made its debut in the Winter of 1984, and STREET HAWK made its debut in the Winter of 1985 which contributed to the cancellation of this show in the Summer of 1986, and to the cancellation of AIRWOLF in the Spring of 1986, and to the cancellation of STREET HAWK in the Summer of 1985.

In addition to what put this show on the chopping block, you could say that this was also the weakest season of them all for KNIGHT RIDER, especially since the ratings on this show weren't nearly as high as they were during the first 2 seasons of KNIGHT RIDER, especially since this show wasn't nearly as popular as it was during KNIGHT RIDERs 1st Season, even though the Fourth Season was a lot more upgraded than the First Season, but I think part of what made this show falter in the 1985-86 Season was due to the fact that they ended up making too many changes too fast, especially between the 3rd and 4th Seasons, since KITT got blown up in the ""Knight Of The Drones"" episode before getting his new dashboard in the Third Season opener of this show and then got destroyed in an acid pit again in the ""Junk Yard Dog"" episode and then KITT got destroyed and nearly killed again in the ""Knight Of The Juggernaut"" episode before getting rebuilt and getting the additional features of Super Pursuit Mode and the convertible style feature, which almost indicated that KITT was getting weaker and more vulnerable to being damaged.

Unfortunately, NBC didn't even have a series finale episode either, even though NBC had already announced back in the Spring of 1986 that KNIGHT RIDER was going to be cancelling and indicating that KNIGHT RIDER wasn't heading for a Fifth Season, since the ratings of this show were obviously not going in the right direction & was axed only a year later after CBS had given THE DUKES OF HAZZARD the boot back in the Winter of 1985, due to a continuance in weakening ratings.

Overall, I still enjoyed the 4th Season as well as the first 3 seasons along with the fact that this season brings back a lot of childhood memories for me too, since KNIGHT RIDER was my favorite show in the 1980's.

Another thing that I can't help finding intriguing about this season was David Hasselhoff started doing BAYWATCH for the first time on NBC 4 years later after KNIGHT RIDER cancelled, which made an interesting comparison by watching him as LA County lifeguard(Lt. Mitch Bucannon) wearing a trunks or an official beach lieutenants uniform having the same hairstyle he had in the Fourth Season of KNIGHT RIDER and looking back on David Hasselhoff's days as Michael Knight wearing his cool slick leather jacket and talking to a snazzy hot car as opposed to talking to beautiful lady co-workers and gorgeous women in bikinis at the beach in Malibu & Santa Monica on BAYWATCH, which was certainly an interesting transition of David Hasselhoff's showbiz career to watch, despite the fact that BAYWATCH faltered the first time on NBC before the show returned in the Fall of 1991 in syndication.

This 1985-1986 Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC's motto was ""NBC:Let's All BE THERE"", since that was their slogan on NBC from the Summer of 1984 thru the Summer of 1986.

By the way, I just got word that the Shout Factory will be releasing the short-lived series STREET HAWK with Rex Smith(Jesse Mach)out on DVD on Tuesday July 13th, 2010 for all you high-tech TV show fans out there.",1144713600,7,13238,4.829655781112092
2495855,2,B000E5KQM8,"""Knight Rider"" has finally wrapped itself up with all of its seasons now available on DVD.  But all is not well in TV on DVD land.  At first, Universal's announcement that Season 4 was to be released within two months of Season 3 was a delight to ""Knight Rider"" fans. However, it is now apparent that this has resulted in a rushed DVD set.

Season 4 is, without a doubt, the weakest in the series.  But that's not to say that it's a bad season as it is still quite enjoyable.  A new character, Reginald Cornelius III (RC3 for short), has been added to the cast to create new storylines.  K.I.T.T. has also received a radical new change in his appearance, with the new addition of Super Pursuit Mode and its corresponding Emergency Braking System.  By this season the show had also taken on a slightly darker tone, but was unfortunately plagued with numerous sub-par plots.  However, the bright spots in this season were some of the best epsiodes in the series (""The Scent Of Roses"" being one in particular).  Other bright spots in this season include: ""Knight Of the Juggernaut,"" ""KITTnap,"" ""Killer K.I.T.T.,"" ""Knight Behind Bars,"" ""Many Happy Returns,"" ""Out Of the Woods,"" and ""Deadly Knightshade.""

Now, the DVD flaws...

First off, the episode synopsis has been removed from each epsiode, as has the chapter selection menu.  While these synopses are included on the back of each DVD case, some consistency with the first three seasons would have been nice.  Secondly, the opening teasers are inexplicably missing from two of the episodes: ""Knight Song"" and ""The Scent Of Roses."" As if that weren't enough, there's overcropped shots, particularly noticeable in each opening credit sequence.  The results are shots that appear to be way too zoomed in.  Next comes the downgrade in sound.  Season 4 was originally the only season of the show broadcast in Stereo.  The DVD set states that the sound is now Mono, which has resulted in dead flat sound.  In fact, my 20-year-old VHS tape of some original Season 4 airings seems to have richer sound which is pathetic.  And speaking of sound, once again there are certain sound effects missing (as there were on the Season 3 set), which are most noticeable in the season premiere, ""Knight Of the Juggernaut.""  Yet another problem with this set: cheap, double-sided, made in Mexico discs, which are becoming more and more frequently defective.  I actually had to exchange this set due to my players not being able to read certain episodes. Universal is in the process of redoing the Season 3 sets, and hopefully they will do the same thing with the Season 4 set.

However, on the positive side, this is surprisingly the first season since Season 1 that has all of its original music intact.  Of course, ""Knight Rider"" was always unique in the fact that it mostly utilized cover songs, so it must never have been too much of a problem for Universal to afford most of the songs in this series.  But thankfully, Tina Turner's ""We Don't Need Another Hero"" is still included in the season premiere (probably the most important song next to ""White Bird"" in ""The Scent Of Roses""), which was not a cover.  Also on the positive side, there are a couple of bonus features.  These are ""The Great '80s TV Flashback"" (which is included on all of the latest Universal season releases), and K.I.T.T. Blueprints (which, in actuality, is a copy of the ""K.I.T.T. Kit,"" previously a blueprint manual that was released during the show's original run). And fans who will watch ""The Great '80s TV Flashback"" just for the brief ""Knight Rider"" segment will be disappointed.  The segment consists of mostly interviews taken directly from the Season 1 set, which most fans probably have already bought.  So it's pretty much a repeat of what most fans already have. Since this was the final season of the show, obviously Universal couldn't cop-out and put an episode of the next season to call a ""bonus feature.""  The extras are nothing great (especially if you own other Universal shows which have the same featurette), but they are better than nothing.  And they come at the expense of many flaws with this DVD set.

Again, picture quality is decent, but not perfect, and for the first time the episodes do not appear dark like the first three sets.  Unfortunately there are still a lot of shots with visible dust and dirt specs, which is a disappointment considering that Season 1 didn't seem to be as plagued with this problem.  But the fact of the matter is that this is still the best that ""Knight Rider"" has ever looked compared to syndication, VHS tapes, or the old Columbia House DVD releases.  It's just a shame that once again Universal has released a half-hearted DVD set.  By this point it's painfully obvious that they just don't care about their shows.  It's a tragedy that this company owns some of the best TV/movie franchises ever, as they in some way screw up nearly all of their DVD releases... If none of these DVD issues bother you, then by all means pick up this set despite the fact that Universal doesn't deserve the money.",1144454400,16,5065,4.735461801596351
2495856,1,B000E5KQM8,"This show is my all time favorite, however Universal has once again dicked it up, just like they did with SEASON 3 and left out various sound effects and some teasers, but with this set, it is the ultimate let down, MONO sound when it was originally in STEREO!

KR, as its affectionately called by some fans, may seem quirky and obscure nowadays with its atari centipede sound effects, poofie aqua-net hairdo's, over-acting and ""sooo not the original artist"" song usage, but we didn't care...

To us this was the best thing on TV besides Smurfs and He-Man and it appealed to our parents as well. KR was like James Bond meets Herbie the Love Bug. While our mothers drooled over the blue-eyed hunky Hasselhoff, we were captivated by the ominous-looking but friendly talking black Trans Am, K.I.T.T. (Knight Industries Two Thousand) we giggled everytime theives tried to steal KITT and failed, and we cried when KITT got destroyed (but they -always- managed to rebuild him).

I found Season 3 in the mall for $24. The visual quality of these discs is pretty good. It would've been nicer if they had director/actor interviews and maybe some behind the scenes words with George Barris (the guy who built all the KITT cars for the show) I can't say I care for the double sided discs as they are terribly easy to smudge, but I guess that's the only way they could fit 8 episodes on each DVD.",1143072000,3,1376,4.777310924369748

Knight of the Juggernaut starts the series off with a bang when KITT is destroyed by an armoured vehicle.  The last episode, Voodoo Knight is the worst episode in the series and I've heard that they are going to put Knight Rider on the big screen.  Let's hope it's better than the Dukes of Hazzard movie.  The actors who played Bo and Luke- were horrible.  Casting ben Affleck as Michael Knight is a bad move. Michael Knight is one character that only Hasseloff can play.
