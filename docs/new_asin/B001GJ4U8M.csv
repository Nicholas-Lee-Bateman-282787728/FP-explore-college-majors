8305612,3,B001GJ4U8M,"I have received this DVD from Netflix today, have already viewed it and it is in it's envelope ready to be returned to Netflix in the morning. The historical contents are superb, but, the production values are poor at best. Several of the performances shown are reasonably good to view and their historical value is invaluable, especially the Rigoletto, Tosca, Otello and Falstaff scenes. It is possible that these are not available elsewhere. Evidently this was first released on VHS in 1970, was probably done on Laser Disc, and many years later put on DVD. But, if there was any restoration process when it was done for DVD, it is not obvious.",1456704000,,646,4.776785714285714
8305613,1,B001GJ4U8M,The notes for this DVD suggest a must for any opera collection.  However the production sound and video quality make this DVD unacceptable at any price.,1243814400,13,152,4.846153846153846
