4104898,4,B003AYYASG,"Yo no vi Querida Enemiga cuando se Transmitio en Television pero Me Tento Mucho la Idea de que este Carmen Becerra y Maria Rubio, por eso Decidi Comprar el Dvd.
Sinceramente no le tengo mucha Fe a Ana Layevska ya que no la conosco mucho, me resulta algo floja como Actriz pero bueno, es un Pre-concepto mio, espero que no sea asi, que no me decepcione con su Papel Protagonico, por otra parte Me Gusta Mucho Gabriel Soto y Jorge Aravena.
Este Dvd Me Lo Recomendaron, espero no arrepentirme de haberlo Comprado...
Carmen Becerra hizo un Exelente Papel Antagonico y se que me va a gustar mucho porque ya la he visto en otras Novelas y Me Encanta, es uns Exelente Actriz.
Cuando tenga el Dvd y lo vea les cuento que tal esta el Resumen...
9/8/2011: Muy Buen Resumen, Contiene lo Mas Importante, esta Muy, pero muy Completo, la verdad la recomiendo abiertamente, no se van a arrepentir...",1311811200,,884,4.566037735849057
4104899,3,B003AYYASG,"I have watched this novella twice on the diffrent channels on TV. I have been looking for the DVD for awhile now and was so suprised when I finally was able to get it.  The DVD focuses on mainly Lorena and Sara and of course Alonzo y Ernesto.  I agree with the other posts... the editing left out key story plots.  I mean it completly left out the sub-stories of Bruno and Diana, Valeria and Arturo, Bettina and Ivan etc... and of course Greta and Don Omar.... So it is a good DVD to add to my collection but as a whole I was disappointed.",1296432000,3,539,4.114285714285714
4104900,3,B003AYYASG,"Nice story, but the editing is the worst I have seen so far. When characters are talking about events you did not see, and this happens again and again, it becomes irritating. Besides, the dvds are not divided in parts, so each dvd is a 4 hour movie, which makes it unconfortable to watch. I have seen some scenes from this soap in youtube and I am sure that this would be a great soap to enjoy if edited properly.",1266710400,4,414,4.1875
4104901,3,B003AYYASG,I saw the full version on TV and this DVD has a lot of parts that are cut.  They were essential for viewers to understand somethings on the drama of the soap.  It was ok but at times didn't make sense.,1262044800,2,201,3.8780487804878048

8393323,3,B003AYYASG,"Querido Enemiga (Dear Enemy - 700 minutes)

We have two chums raised together in an orphanage, one is sweet and the other isn't. When they grow up, each leaves the orphanage, one to seek her fortune as a cook and the other just to seek her fortune.

Our sweet virginal cook Lorena (Ana Layevska) is robbed her first day in the big city but manages to meet a handsome young doctor, Alonzo (Gabriel Soto) who instantly falls in love with her.

In the meantime, the ambitious Sara (Carmen Becarra) has stolen their files from the orphanage and discovered that as an infant, she had been dumped in a garbage can, while her sweet friend had been stolen at birth from her parents because her wealthy and domineering grandmother Hortensia, (Maria Rubio), didn't want her son to marry a peon.

Conniving Sara insinuates herself with the wealthy woman and convinces her that SHE is her granddaughter. With a combination of blackmail and cunning, she becomes her ""grandmother's"" heir.

Sweet Lorena is struggling to stay in cooking school because one of the professors, Ernesto (Jorge Aravena), a guy the students call ""The Monster,"" is so demanding. He falls for our sweet heroine and wants to mend his lady-killing ways.

When Hortensia becomes bedridden and incommunicado, I love the effect of an indomitably upbeat nurse, who insists that crabby old woman is sweet and only needs lots of TLC. Of course the paralyzed woman is unable to chew her out and she just has to lay there and hear all those kind words, day after day. People have no idea that she is sentient, so they say all sorts of things at her bedside.

Both of our heroine's suitors are appealing, thus her quandary.... This 3-disc set offered at Amazon has very choppy editing and would have benefited from a 4th disc so key scenes wouldn't have been missing.",1374969600,,1817,4.731012658227848
