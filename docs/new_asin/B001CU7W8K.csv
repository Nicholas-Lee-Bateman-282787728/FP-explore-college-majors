8289997,5,B001CU7W8K,"WOW! What an interesting DVD. Am amazing project for its time and maybe even today. For someone interested in Russian history, this is a must DVD. This is not a travel DVD but regarding the amazing construction project of a 6000 mile railroad across all of Russia.",1518652800,,264,4.638297872340425
8289998,4,B001CU7W8K,"I like real history and this is real history with photography from a backwards country in very tough times....and yet they accomplished something great. This railroad may very well have sunk the czarist system in Russia because it took so many years and so much money to build. I only wish that it could have been longer with more detail...but it is possible that they gave us all the information that was available. The DVD does state that their government kept the progress and details top secret at the time. Even though this happened after the transcontinental RR was built in the US, they did it mostly without dynamite and modern tools....It was a pick and shovel project....one of the last of those.",1358640000,,706,4.747967479674797
