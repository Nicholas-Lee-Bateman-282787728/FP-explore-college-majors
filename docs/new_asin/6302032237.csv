420793,5,6302032237,"Jimmy Stewart's career was doing great in 1950, and hardly needed a boost, but nonetheless, he agreed to appear in Anthony Mann's Western WINCHESTER '73, and the always superb Stewart's career took a new and more complex path.  In the 1950s, Stewart would make eight movies with Mann, and five of them--WINCHESTER '73 (1950), BEND OF THE RIVER (1952), THE NAKED SPUR (1953), THE FAR COUNTRY (1954), and THE MAN FROM LARAMIE (1955)--would be Westerns.  These five Westerns fully rival the series of Westerns that John Wayne made with John Ford.  They presented the public with a new Jimmy Stewart, one consistently beset with tragedy, often driven to the edge of what human beings can bear.  And sometimes, as in THE NAKED SPUR, Stewart would portray a man so driven by the difficulties that life has thrust upon him, that his greatest struggle isn't with his human enemy so much as it is with his highly tenuous grip upon sanity.
Apart from the Native American extras, this film has only five characters:  Jimmy Stewart as the bounty hunter seeking a man to collect a reward that will allow him to repurchase the ranch he has lost; Janet Leigh as a young girl who has been taken up by an outlaw; Robert Ryan as the outlaw Stewart is after; Ralph Meeker as a dishonorably discharged cavalry officer; and Millard Mitchell as the old timer whose real dream is finding a mother lode.  It is a great cast, and the actors all work together in marvelous fashion.  Stewart and Leigh had marvelous careers, but both Ryan and Meeker were great actors who never seemed to manage to have the kinds of careers you would have expected them to have.  Meeker would turn in magnificent performances in Stanley Kubrick's PATHS OF GLORY (easily one of Kubrick's greatest films) and Robert Aldrich's KISS ME DEADLY, as Mike Hammer, but all in all, he never seemed to get the kinds of roles his talent would seem to require.  Nonetheless, he is superb in this film.
There is actually a sixth member of the cast:  the San Juan Mountains in the Colorado Rocky Mountains.  No director of Westerns was better at integrating the rugged outdoors with his films than Anthony Mann.  We all associate, of course, Monument Valley with the Westerns of John Ford, but in Ford's films the incredible landscapes functioned more like decoration.  They were backdrops for the stories being told.  But in Anthony Mann's films, the land itself was an integral part of the action.  That is especially true of THE NAKED SPUR.  Both at the beginning and the end of the movie, the hunters seek their prey in a locale higher than they are at.  But throughout, the land is palpably a part of the film.
This film also excels at combining psychological complexity with great action sequences.  It is a very dynamic movie.  Virtually every camera shot catches characters who already in motion.  Almost never do we see a cut with a static character who then begins to move.  Instead, every cut finds someone already in the act of doing something.  Yet, much of the appeal of the film lies in the psychological and emotional tensions between the different characters.
In other words, anyone who loves Jimmy Stewart, great Westerns, or just flat out great cinema, needs to see this film.",1016323200,81,3236,4.741071428571429
420794,5,6302032237,"Anthony Mann was known for his great psychological westerns--thanks to him, and the two writers who turned in the script, this film is especially riveting.  The film tightens the screw upon five characters until the  pressure becomes unbearable, and part of what makes the film excellent lies  in the way it is concerned with how people interact in close quarters; the  way they bond through examining what they owe each other and how they  respond to each other's close proximity. If the characters--apart from  Stewart's--remain two dimensional, the manner in which they interact is  very much drawn from the way real people would.  Janet Leigh cannot  redeem her character's more hysterical moments but otherwise shows  sensitivity in her part--you can detect her thoughts move. Meeker is okay,  and Robert Ryan is problematic--he was a highly intelligent actor and here  decides to play the outlaw part jovially. Sadly he winds up sounding  forced--when less jovial he is very good--unlike the actor playing the  Prospector, who is fatally wooden.  It is Stewart who gives the movie  greatness. Unlike John Wayne, who gave the impression of superhuman girth  and will, Stewart looks and acts like an upstanding citizen--until he is  pushed to his limits, and out arises an intensity that is frightening.  Throughout the film he reels his dangerous feelings in and is taut and  seething(even his body language is forcibly restrained)--Stewart is always  best when straining himself, both physically and mentally. By the end, when  he fights for his own humanity, he shocks us by arriving at the point where  he can strain himself no further and what results is a wonder to watch.  John Wayne could never get away with what Stewart manages here. (He'd have  been scared off) Please watch this film and form your own conclusions too.",964569600,11,1834,5.073825503355705

420876,3,6302032237,"Released in 1953 and directed by Anthony Mann, The Naked Spur is a Western starring James Stewart as an embittered rancher-turned-bounty-hunter named Kemp. He seeks a killer (Robert Ryan) in the mountains of SW Colorado and enlists the aid of an aging prospector (Millard Mitchell) and a dishonored officer (Ralph Meeker). Janet Leigh plays the outlaws aid. The ordeal becomes a survival situation as the outlaw implements psychological tactics to turn the wannabe bounty hunters against themselves.

This was the third Mann/Stewart teaming and its good, but overrated in some circles. Ive heard it put on the level of another 1953 Western, Shane, but this simply aint so. The Naked Spur lacks the epic nature of Shane and is just all-around one-dimensional, which isn't necessarily a bad thing; but its marred by glaring flaws, which don't make for great movies.

Concerning the former, the entire film takes place in the wilderness of the high country and the cast is limited to the five noted above with the exception of several Natives who appear for a brief, but exciting confrontation. This scene features a horse spill where the horse topples over sideways, rolls over the rider (!) and stands up straddling him. Its a wild unplanned stunt.  Unfortunately, the sequence is marred by the way the Indians cant hit a target and foolishly ride in the open to be hit by a single bullet.

I favor survival situations with a handful of actors; 1965s Sands of the Kalahari comes to mind. The way the killer works his captors psychologies against each other is well done. But the story isn't as compelling as it couldve been and some of the acting is corny by todays standards. Plus, as noted above, there are some obvious and baffling plot holes:

After the officer sets the group up for the Native confrontation why do they so nonchalantly accept it? Werent they almost unnecessarily killed and one person permanently injured, not to mention several needlessly dead Indians? Then theres the sequence where the thug pushes Kemp off his horse and down a cliff where Kemp just climbs back up the hill, gets on his horse and no one says or does anything to the killer. Really? And how is Kemp able to climb the cliff at the end with a leg that has a bullet wound from a day or two before? Did the eye-rolling naked spur really assist him that much? Why sure!

If you can ignore such stupid flaws The Naked Spur is a worthwhile early-50s Western with James Stewart.

The movie runs 91 minutes and was shot in Durango & the San Juan Mountains in Colorado, and Lone Pine, California

420882,3,6302032237,"I haven't seen all the movies that James Stewart made with the director Anthony Mann, but I have to say that I liked ""The Man from Laramie"" better than this one.  Not that this one is bad -- but it seems as if the idea of this movie was better than the movie itself turned out to be.  That's not the fault of the actors.  The plot set-up and the screenplay are weak.  The idea of three morally compromised men (James Stewart, Ralph Meeker, and Millard Mitchell) in a situation in which they have to take a murderer (Robert Ryan) from Colorado back to Abilene to face hanging and collect the $5,000 dollar reward is potentially interesting, given that there's the temptation to reduce the number of people who would split the reward -- a point that the outlaw prisoner, Ben Vangdergroat (Ryan), keeps bringing up to his captors.  Ben is one of these charming psychopaths who, for much of the movie seems kind of likeable, and Ryan plays him well, but the character is superficially conceived and written for no other reason than to get under the skins of the men who seek a reward for him.  His captors are Howard Kemp (Stewart), a Civil War veteran who has lost his farm through bizarre circumstances and needs the reward to have a chance to get it back.  Ralph Meeker is Roy Anderson, a dishonorably discharged soldier who has run afoul of some Indians too, and Jesse Tate (Mitchell), a prospector of advanced age who is obsessed with making a big strike  and who is open to Ben's suggestion that he knows where gold is.  In the middle of these obsessed and questionable men is Lina (Janet Leigh), who is traveling with Ben, who was her dead father's best friend.  Lina tries to think well of everybody, even Ben.  The movie might be seen as her education.

Without giving away the plot twists, I will only say that the circumstances of the three captors getting together against Ben is highly implausibly handled, even by the standards of Western conventions.  When you think about it, there's no reason why Howard couldn't have done what he set out to do alone: bring Ben to justice.  Getting the other two involved is simply a device to set up the ""noir"" atmosphere, and it's rather transparently obvious.  Howard is wounded during the chase and goes off his head for while, and thus we learn about what has embittered him, but he's not really interesting beyond that.  Stewart plays him with the requisite intensity, but neither Roy nor Jeff nor Ben is really involving as a character.  The sexual tension occasioned by Lina's presence is alluded to but never really dramatized, perhaps given the decency codes of 1953.  The movie isn't dull, and it isn't too long, but the obvious arbitrariness of the set-up is always a bother for me.",1459036800,,2741,4.616494845360824

Not a lot of action; no stampedes, just a fist fight or two and some gun play with Indians and in the final act.  Naked Spur is mostly dialogue and psycho-drama.  Beck wants to take the wanted man back for the $5000 reward in Kansas.  Not because he wants to see justice done, but to reclaim his ranch that an ex-fiance sold out from under him.  He tries to justify his dogged pursuit and capture of this man with the fact that the criminal shot someone back in Kansas.  But the girl friend of the killer knows that Beck is doing this for the money.  She continually throws that in his face, that this is not about justice; it's about money.  The ending is a bit of a surprise although the good guy always gets the girl.  Thing is, this movie doesn't really have a ""good"" guy.",1444176000,3,914,4.261627906976744
420908,4,6302032237,"San Juans are a stunningly beautiful mountain range in southern Colorado and is the backdrop for this classic Jimmy Stewart/Anthony Mann collaboration and perhaps their best next to The Man from Laramie. And the film itself -- a tight, taut drama with a fine cast, merits five stars.

Image quality. As is stated on the cover, it *is* packed with Technicolor thrills. And, overall, the picture looks pretty darn good. However, being picky, it could be better -- it looks somewhat hazy, colors a bit muted and overall somewhat flat. That being said, this is the best it on home video and there are parts were the Technicolor brilliance comes through but this film, well, all the Stewart/Mann westerns, deserve fresh scans from the original camera negatives to allow their brilliance to come through.

Audio quality. The 2.0 mono sound is clean and clear and is never buried in the mix. Some of the later ADR looping sounds like it was recorded in a stdio echo chamber but is ok.

Extras. A couple non-related shorts are included along with the trailer.

Case -- Standard keep case reproduces the standard movie poster which is good.

Here's a list of the Stewart/Mann westerns -- they're all quite good. The only one that been properly remastered to Blue-ray is the Twilight Time release of The Man from Laramie.

Also with Janet Leigh, Robert Ryan, Ralph Meeker and Millard Mitchell.
Each is a well-defined character. Jimmy's a bounty hunter in need of money to buy back his farm, so he's set on capturing alive Ryan, a murderer who's accompanied by Leigh, a little spitfire that may or may not be his girlfriend. Mitchell is your clich&eacute; grizzled, unsuccessful gold prospector that Jimmy encounters at story's beginning, Meeker's a dishonorably discharged Army officer, a man who relishes killing Inj&ugrave;ns.

All thrown together by chance, Meeker and Mitchell are hardly trustworthy, nor the sort of riding companions that Jimmy would choose, but cash rewards make for strange campfellows. And having duplicitous Leigh to also contend with just may be too much for Jimmy to handle....

421063,5,6302032237,"This film's title refers to its final scene where James Stewart climbs a mountain cliff, believe it or not, by pushing his spur into the cliff and hanging on to it while trying to recapture Robert Ryan.

  Stewart is looking for Ryan who shot a man in the back. There is a $5,000 reward. This is the first time that Stewart is bounty-hunting, but he needs the money to buy back the ranch that his fiance sold under him while he was fighting in the Civil War. Stewart meets a poor prospector, who prospected for decades without finding anything, and a dishonorably discharged army lieutenant, who had seduced the daughter of an Indian chief. The two help him and insist upon sharing the $5,000 reward.

 They capture Ryan, who has Janet Leigh with him. She is the daughter of a dead gunfighter. She left her home after her mother's death to see her father and found that he was dead. She joined Ryan because she had nowhere else to go. Ryan is an affable, sneaky, lying, conniving, and smiling charmer. He tells Leigh that she needs to help him escape from the three men so that they can ride to California together and start a new life - which is a lie, but she believes him. Ryan uses his wit during the more than week-long trip to Abilene to drive wedges between his three captors, and to find a way to seduce at least one of the three to help him escape.

 During the trip, the Indian chief and a dozen or so braves catches up with the lieutenant, there is a battle, and Stewart is wounded in the leg. While in a delirium, he tells how his fiance cheated him of his ranch, and how he needs to buy it back from the man she sold it to, for ranching is his life and his delight. Leigh acts as if she feels sorry for him, she tells him that she is not romantically involved with Ryan, and Stewart, a lonely man, asks her to marry him.

 I won't reveal what happens next. Was she leading him on, as Ryan requested her to do? Will Ryan be able to seduce one of the three to help him escape? Will all three take Ryan to Abilene or will one or two of them get killed? Will Ryan hang? Will Stewart buy back his ranch? Will he marry Leigh and live happily ever after, or will he join her and go to California?",1301356800,2,2202,4.211401425178147

421065,3,6302032237,"James Stewart and director Anthony Mann made so many,excellent pictures I would not hesitate to nominate them ""the best actor-director team Hollywood ever had"".Over the top the opinion? Well,anyone can dispute it, and I'd love to hear the nominees from the unsatisfied ones. As for Mann,I don't share the opinion of many of his admirers that he is the most underrated director of all time. I'm a movie critic in Brasil, and one of my pastimes, God help me,is reading critics from all over the world. And I don't remember a single one of them at the time, rating his westerns anything less than ""four stars"". Naturally he had some ""lemons, and bitter ones""(You name them yourself). But he was good or wonderful in any genre. The ancient ""The Tall Target""(look for it),""El Cid""(beautiful spectacle)""The Glenn Miller Story""(among the best of bio pics)and, of course, the field in each he excelled, more than any other director: the western. Although he was good in any of them,Mann, I think, was not confortable with big budget productions. Yet, he made a fine one in MGM's ""The Naked Spur"", not as great as ""Winchester 73"" or ""Bend of the River"", my favorite, but always a big,action filled, and sometimes complex western in his psycological structure. And with the one traditional atraction:the suffering, bitter James Stewart, a kind of precursor of Mel Gibson's masochist and self mutilating quest for vengeance. Plus a young and beautiful Janet Leigh,Robert Ryan going over the top as the smiling psycopath and the marvelous scenery of Colorado. What else would want in a Stewart-Mann western?",1289606400,,1595,5.0
421066,3,6302032237,"As to the 2006 release: the video and audio quality is very poor.

I loaded it and started to watch, and immediately thought something was wrong with my player, which was brand-new from Sony. Then I realized it was the disc. Might be a great movie in a good release. I'll admit there are movies good enough to overcome a poor quality release, but I think not in this case, especially not with dubbed dialog.",1282348800,3,546,4.362745098039215
421067,2,6302032237,"Naked Spur is one of those B westerns produced in the 50s when westerns were at their peak. Although this period did produce some classic films, in general they were disappointing, and specifically, to this film, very disappointing.

The film is basically a film about greed. To me it is reminiscent of 1948s ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"". In that film, 3 prospectors (Humphrey Bogart, Walter Huston, and Tim Holt) turn against each other on a long journey to town after they discovered gold. In this film, 3 cowboys turn against each other on a long journey to town in order to collect a $5000 reward. The difference is that ""Naked Spur"" has Robert Ryan as the wanted man who spurs the conflict, while in ""Treasure"" there is no visible cause, apart from the greed.

The film stars Jimmy Stewart (1908-97). Stewart is a film icon. He was nominated for an Oscar 5 times, winning once (""The Philadelphia Story"" in 1940). He had 2 BAFTA nominations (""Anatomy of a Murder"", ""The Glenn Miller Story"") and 3 Golden Globe nominations including one win (""Hawkins"" in 1971). Twice he won the New York film critics award (""Anatomy of a Murder"" and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"") and he also gave us such memorable performances in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"". Stewart worked extensively with Alfred Hitchcock and together they made ""Rope"" (1948), ""Rear Window"" (1954), ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" (1956), and ""Vertigo"" (1958).

The film is directed by Anthony Mann (1906-67). Mann originally specialized in film noir in the 40s (e.g., ""T-Men"", ""Raw Deal"") but starting in 1950 with ""The Furies"" he began to make westerns and put out a dozen, although he still on occasion, made other types of films (e.g., ""Strategic Air Command"", ""God's Little Acre"", ""El Cid""). Mann received 3 DGA nominations (""El Cid"", ""Men at War"", ""The Glenn Miller Story"").

Naked Spur is the third of eight collaborations between Stewart and Mann, five of which were westerns. Their first film together,""Winchester 73"", is the best of their western films, and it was this film that re-established Stewart as a major star who could command cast and director approval as well as receive a percentage of the profits.

Mann brought his film noir sensitivities to the western genre, and this blend produced a western that was distinct from the Ford (""Fort Apache"", ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"") or the Hawks (""Red River"", ""Rio Bravo"") films as well as the films of Budd Boetticher (""Commanche Station"", ""The Tall T""). Though Ford and Hawks tended to use John Wayne, Mann used Stewart and Boetticher used Randolph Scott. Rarely did one of the directors use one of the stars used by the other director (notable exception being Ford using Stewart in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"").

Unfortunately,  the blend of film noir and westerns has rarely worked well. Raoul Walsh's ""Pursued"" (1947) and Nicholas Ray's ""Johnny Guiitar"" are exceptions to this rule. While noir westerns per se were not terribly successful, they did help turn the traditional western into a more balanced genre. One can only imagine that ""The Searchers"" (1956) would not have been possible without the influence of the noir westerns.

Robert Ryan (1909-73) co-stars as the killer whom Stewart is trying to take back to Abilene for trial. Ryan made nearly 100 films over a 30+ year career. He was nominated for an Oscar (""Crossfire"", 1947) and a BAFTA (""Billy Budd"", 1962) and won an NBR Award (""The Iceman Cometh"", 1973). Ryan was a favorite of film noir directors, working with Nicholas Ray (""On Dangerous Ground"", 1951) and Robert Wise (""Set Up"", 1949). He often played military roles (""Dirty Dozen"", ""Longest Day"", ""Battle of the Bulge"") and westerns (""The Professionals"", ""Bad Day at Black Rock""), and I think his best role was in Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969). Ryan's performance in ""Naked Spur"" is one of his poorest performances of his long career. His villain is far too convivial and his attempts to create conflict are so self-evident it's hard to believe that this script was filmed.

Beautiful Janet Leigh (1927) plays a simple girl who latches on to Ryan as a substitute father figure. We all know Leigh from her role in ""Psycho"" (1960), but she made more than 50 films and gave us memorable roles in ""Touch of Evil"" (1958) and ""Manchurian Candidate"" (1962) among others. She made 5 films with her husband Tony Curtis, and appeared twice with her daughter Jamie Lee Curtis. Leigh's performance in this film is comical. She seems to fall in and out of love in every other scene.

Millard Mitchell (1903-53) plays an old prospector who teams up with Stewart to bring Ryan back and split the reward. Mitchell appeared in more than 30 films and won the Golden Globe for ""My Six Convicts"" (1952). He gave us memorable performances as Gregory Peck's commanding officer in ""Twelve O'Clock High"" (1949) and as the movie mogul in ""Singing in the Rain"" (1952). He gives the only good performance in this film.

Ralph Meeker (1920-88) plays a dishonorably discharged cavalry man who joins up with Stewart. Meeker appeared in more than 50 films and as many TV programs, but never attained more than B star status. His performance here is similar to his performance in other films - nothing really distinguished but certainly adequate.

One of the few good parts of the film is the scenery. Mann is famous for his use of landscape, and this is another one of his prime examples. The NY Times praised the ""settings that are superb and seemingly created for Technicolor.""

The film was a box office success, as were most 50s westerns, and most films with Jimmy Stewart. It received a nomination for Best Screenplay, but didn't win.

Fans of the western can find hundreds of better films. Fans of Jimmy Stewart can find dozens of better films, even from the non-westerns he did with Mann. Fans of the other stars will also find that their favorite actors can be seen in much better films. Even Anthony Mann fans can find better films elsewhere. There is simply nothing to recommend this film.",1278115200,3,6061,4.843478260869565
421068,4,6302032237,"James Stewart is angry, obsessed, and scary in this essential Anthony Mann western. The landscape is the most amazing and menacing element of a compelling story set in an ounfriendly environment with a spare but superb cast.",1269302400,,224,5.081081081081081
421069,5,6302032237,"The tagline for this movie at IMDB says ""Packed with Technicolor Thrills!"" - and this is exactly the case. After seeing a few Technicolor movies produced in the early 50's (notably - ""Picnic"" by William Holden) I'm inclined to view Technicolor as much more than just a color film process, it's rather a state of mind.

Everything is hyper about Technicolor films in general and ""The Naked Spur"" in particular, starting with the color - and all the way up to human wickedness and charged sexuality. No production code is ever violated in ""The Naked Spur"", but it's so suggestive and powerful in its sexual undertones that even the wonderful Colorado landscapes add to this sexual appeal.

""The Naked Spur"" was produced long before anybody heard about PC, so the woman's role in this film is totally secondary and submissive. Even the happy end scene where Lina agrees to become Kemp's wife is very much a show of woman's transferring her allegiance to a powerful winning male. At the very end Kemp generously decides to spare Lina's sensibilities and not to take Ben's body to the authorities to claim bounty, but this  happens already after Lina accepted his proposal.

There are four male characters in the movie, and all of them're wicked to various degrees. Kemp, who's supposed to be a ""good guy"", does not really become one until well into the movie, and even at the very end he does not look spotless from the moral viewpoint. All others are plain bad, and the authors make no excuses, blaming human nature, which takes the first opportunity to follow greedy impulses to commit any crime.

""The Naked Spur"" is much more than a western, it's a psychological drama. Excellent script, superb performance by all cast, very professional camera work, beautiful scenery - the movie is a pleasure to watch.",1265673600,,1804,4.825242718446602

421083,5,6302032237,"The third film in the collaborations of director Anthony Mann and star James Stewart may also be the best of the bunch.

This dark morality tale is about how conflicted loner Stewart is after killer Robert Ryan for a cash reward to restart his life. Along the way he is given unwanted assistance by two strangers(Ralph Meeker and Millard Mitchell) and Ryan's girl, beautiful Janet Leigh.
What ensues is a tale of betrayal and greed, lust and disaster and alot of soul searching for Stewart, who's world weary man must discover a method to the madness, a point to existence.

Stewart is superb in the lead role, conveying a sense of darkness and emotion that Mann was best to bring out. His tortured role is highly relateable and tragic. The conclusion of this film features one of Stewart's most heartbreaking and believable cinematic moments as his character transforms his belief that drove him for the previous ninety minutes in about ninety seconds.

Ryan serves as the anchor to the picture, a devil's advocate that turns the other men against each other bringing about there worst feelings of greed and disception. His character's usually cheerful attitude makes his violence and language that much more disturbing. It's a brilliant performance.

The rest of the cast are entirely believable with Mitchell as a likeable enough old Indian trader with a dream of hitting it big with a gold strike. Meeker is a former Army officer who proves a back stabbing, licentious creep. Leigh is typically warm and likeable, as well as being strong and independent. It's one of her best roles from thais early part of her career.

Mann's use of cinematography is most effective creating a true sense of clausterphobia even among the mighty peaks and valleys of the Rocky Mountains. It may be my fvaorite shot of the Mann westerns for the locatiosn themselves become there own  character, imposing and foreboding.

The DVD features typical Warner Bros  extras including two short subjects and a Theatrical Trailer. The extras are pleasant, but am I surprised that no one did commentary on this classic. A mini-documentary would have been welcome as well.

If your a Western film buff, consider this one a must own. It's one of the top twenty five of the genre's history and essential cinema.",1243209600,4,2283,4.909090909090909

421086,5,6302032237,"A group of people thrown together by circumstance of a $5000.00 reward poster for a back-shooting murder that earlier had taken place in Abilene, Kansas.

Jimmy Stewart heads an all star cast in this 3rd meeting and picture of Stewart and Anthony Mann.  Seldom on the screen has there been paired such good as personified by Janet Leigh juxtaposed with such evil as Robert Ryan.  Ralph Meeker, disgraced-discharged soldier, and Millard Mitchell, burnt out miner-prospector, throw in with Stewart to shepherd the killer to his future hanging.

But the trio must first not only overcome the wild, mountainous country, but Indian attack, and the rain and mud to come.  The eventual raging rivers combined with all this lends abundant psychological stress and interplay to these diverse, mostly greedy, personalities. They begin to mistrust everyone else and everything to a point of each becomming murderous.

The salient feature here is the continous manner in which Robert Ryan is able to promote dissension among Stewart, Meeker, and Mitchell. This 1953 movie allows Robert Ryan an opportunity to provide one of the best performances of his long and varied career.  Just excellant, almost beyond description.

Though this classic movie only times out at 93 minutes, the psychological and physical action never lets up for a moment.  Each time I view this movie I'm drawn in anew as if I'd never seen it before.  The evil present in Ryan's character continues to unfold until not only Janet Leigh becomes aware of it, but we as viewers see it as never before, too.

As the film winds down the raging river and rapids only serve as cinematic background to reinforce the dialogue and plot.  But above all we see the insane evil present in Robert Ryan, an evil which would not only destroy him but anyone foolish enough to trust him. But as is self evident, such degree of evil generally serves as the mechanism leading to its own destruction.

Overlooking the improbable ending of this film, the fact remains that THE NAKED SPUR is a great cinematic effort from half-century back.  Don't miss it.

421087,5,6302032237,"The Naked Spur was the third of five Westerns director Anthony Mann would make with Jimmy Stewart in the first half of the '50's. These works stand alongside Stewart's 50's films with Hitchcock as going along way to revise his ""aw shucks,"" light comic persona. For Hitchcock, Stewart played obsessive, neurotic characters; for Mann he was that too, with an added capacity for violence that is as convincingly portrayed as is is unexpected. Looking at both ends of Stewart's emotional spectrum by watching The Naked Spur and Vertigo alongside Mr Smith Goes To Washington bears out fully Andrew Sarris' accolade -- Stewart was the most complete actor in classical Hollywood.

In Spur, Stewart plays Howie Kemp, once a normal farmer who probably had a moral compass; but a series of set-backs leading to the the loss of his ranch has left him at the end of his tether -- to get himself out of a financial hole, he has turned bounty hunter, stalking a former friend, a career criminal, who shot a sheriff and now has a substantial reward hanging over his head -- dead or alive.

At the film's start, Stewart is alone in the wilderness, and close to catching his quarry. But by the time he apprehends him, and has to make the long journey back to civilization, he had acquired unwillingly a couple of partners who facilitate the capture and now mean to share in the spoils: Ralph Meeker, as a sociopathic cavalry officer, dishonorably discharged for raping an Indian (and the tribe is on his trail, and hence on Stewart's as well); and a kindly but greedy old prospector (Millard Mitchell).

And the quarry? Robert Ryan, at his menacing best. Bound and immobile for most of the film, his barbed humor and disarming good nature disguise a truly dangerous man -- dangerous because he knows all of his captors weaknesses, and plays them off against each other, using his words as weapons only until he gets the chance to get his hands on an actual gun. When he is caught, he is accompanied by a semi-feral young woman, played by Janet Leigh, the daughter of one of his slain associates with whom Ryan has some sort of ambiguous relationship, somewhere between lover and surrogate father; when Ryan sees Stewart is attracted to her, he will use that too as a weapon.

Mann stages this journey employing the rocky barren landscape as another protagonists; he relishes having his actors climbing sheer rock faces, fording rapids, digging themselves into the earth to shield themselves from bullets. The extremity of the characters struggle with the landscape mirrors the emotional extremes they are subjected to.

Stewart plays here a paranoid, bitter, vindictive man, for whom the pursuit of blood money has become an obsession. The fact that this goal is at odds with the moral person he once was leads him to the edge of hysteria; he screams like a woman, rages, menaces, bullies. And he pulls it off beautifully. Mann once said at the end of any of his films, his heroes are more exhausted then exalted. As in The Wages of Fear, these movies, particularly Spur, are ordeals, and we and the characters are spared nothing. This movie,like the others in the cycle, is among the toughest, and darkest westerns to come out of Hollywood.",1221350400,12,3224,4.78096947935368

Paired off with a grizzly prospector (Millard Mitchell), Stewart will also have to face his demons in the face of increasing danger.

421122,5,6302032237,"The Naked Spur was one of the very first spec scripts to get picked up by a major studio, and it's easy to see why. With a strong story, a small but vividly drawn cast and a lot of post-war cynicism, Sam Rolfe and Harold Jack Bloom's Oscar-nominated screenplay has the feel of one of the film noirs MGM chief Dore Schary was so fond of to it, albeit set in Anthony Mann's beloved high country. James Stewart's the rancher turned ruthless bounty hunter haunted by his Civil War experiences who finds himself saddled with two unwanted partners in the form of Millard Mitchell's '49er prospector and Ralph Meeker's disgraced cavalryman, the kind of man who'll ask you to trust him while drawing a map on the back of his dishonourable discharge. The reward's not big enough to be split three ways, and their wily captive makes sure they know it, sowing the seeds of doubt and betrayal at every opportunity in the hope that they'll be too busy trying to kill each other to stop him escaping. Rounding out the ensemble is Janet Leigh as his travelling companion who finds herself increasingly caught in the middle and, like Stewart, has to make a choice between salvation and damnation before the journey to the gallows is done.

They're all deeply flawed characters, every one of them lying as much to themselves as to each other, and even the hero looks more likely to take the road to Hell than the one to redemption: their captive may or may not once have been a friend, but now he's just a sack of money that's worth just as much dead as alive. As with many of their Westerns, Stewart carries his own physical stigmata with him - in The Man From Laramie a shot through the hand, in Bend of the River the scar of a hangman's noose and in this a bullet in the leg - as he travels his own mental Calvary, kicking and screaming against his own redemption every tormented step of the way as only an Anthony Mann Western hero can. He's more than a match for the elements as the weather and landscape reflects the growing intensity of the drama, until he takes on a raging torrent and wrestles a river for a corpse with more pure hatred and desperation in his eyes than any sane man should ever have. And when redemption comes, it's quiet, almost begrudging and unsensationalized, and all the more effective for that.

If that sounds too perfect, there's a catch, and in this case, unexpectedly it's Robert Ryan, whose performance as the jovial puppeteering wanted man just doesn't work. For once he lacks real menace and it's hard to see anyone being taken in by him he's so laughably insincere. Along with the hokey use of Beautiful Dreamer on the soundtrack it's the film's only misjudgement. More than half a century on, this is still gripping and intense stuff.

Sadly, Warners' DVD is problematic. The color may be better than the TV prints, but the definition is often variable, with pin-sharp shots sometimes alternating with ones that are far softer now than they were in 1953.

Stewart gives a performance so intense and taut as to border, in the words of one critic, on the hysterical...

Geographical odyssey reflects the hero's spiritual struggles with panoramic and outstanding views of the Rockies at their best... Beautifully photographed in Technicolor, the film tells the story of a forceful and aggressive Stewart, once a landowner cheated out of his property, who has taken the bounty hunting as the quickest way to regain a measure of respectability...

Stewart is hot on the trail of a wild killer (Robert Ryan) who has a $5000 reward on his head, dead or alive... Once captured, the obscure wily outlaw turns the bounty hunters against each other, and almost escapes...

Janet Leigh is cast as ""a fancy-talking"" jealous type, and apparently, Stewart finds his renewed decency thanks to our heroine... In a widely admired scene, Stewart breaks down and weeps, finally understanding the inhumanity of his bounty-hunting obsession, and is set free for his preoccupation with the fastened body as a merely rewarded property...

Meeker challenges Stewart in his tense, hostile projections, and Ryan is in his element as the crooked hunted killer...

With a short hair and hardly a make-up, Janet Leigh plays the tough, spirited, uneducated pretty companion of a murderer... She does her best to control the energies of four men, who include a discharged cavalryman with dishonor and a selfishly greedy guide (Millard Mitchell).

421124,4,6302032237,"I give the film four stars only because of the very soft picture. Otherwise, it would earn a resounding five stars. I have been waiting a long time for this film to be on DVD, but to find that they are insulting Robert Ryan again by providing poor quality DVDs of many of his films now on DVD. Most recent example in Billy Budd, which I also have been waiting to be on DVD for eons. Both The Naked Spur and Billy Budd should have been given first class treatment. Naked is only marginally superious to the VHS due to the soft picture (Mann's other Westerns have been transferred better). MY VHS copy of Billy Budd is superior to the DVD. I definitely won't buy the DVD. Another reviewer mentioned that a few minutes of Billy Budd were deleted in order to fit it on the DVD. I wonder which scenes they were.

As for The Naked Spur, it is another Ryan masterpiece in engendering some degree of audience sympathy for an essentially psychopathic personality. It is amazing how an actor such as Ryan can interpret malevolence so well, yet be a peace activist in real life. When Ryan's Ben Vandergroat cooly murders Jesse Tate, his deep seated cold bloodedness, which has only been talked about up to that point in the film, occurs at the moment when Ben kills Jesse. Ryan's final line to Janet Leigh as he lays in ambush for James Stewart and Ralph Meeker encapsulates his situation:

""Pretty soon Roy and your friend Howie are gonna show up. Then I'll get me some more insurance against dying young.""",1159574400,12,1496,4.4963235294117645

As you would expect, it's not a simple case of picking someone up and bringing them to justice cross-country (on horseback). As luck would have it, bountyhunter 'Howard Kemp' makes crosses paths and makes use of an AWOL cavalry soldier (the always grinning Ralph Meeker) and an old prospector (Millard Mitchell) to capture the wily outlaw 'Ben Vandergroat' (Robert Ryan).

Now Howard (James Stewart) is forced to split the reward three ways, but of course a lot can happen on the journey home. To make matters worse, the captured outlaw goads the others into killing the other two and bringing him in alone. He also sets his young female ward (Janet Leigh) on Howard to steal his heart (and his attention).

If you can only see one Anthony Mann western this one should be high on your list (IMDB rating: 7.4), but if I were you I'd go for more, a lot more! Westerns were Mann's specialty as the ratings seem to attest.

421126,5,6302032237,"James Stewart was a different man after he returned from World War II. Although still capable of playing the lovable, folksy character he played in comedies, his films upon his return from the war sometimes took a hard, even bitter edge. And the majority of these films were the Westerns he made in the 1950s with great director Anthony Mann. Making eight films in all, including non-Westerns such as The Glenn Miller Story and Strategic Air Command, they formed one of the strongest bodies of work between a director and actor in Hollywood history.

Beginning in 1950 with ""Winchester '73"", Stewart and Mann made Westerns that belied many of the typical genre films of that era. Stewart's heroes, instead of being stalwart, upright and likable, were often times somewhat shady, sinister, and not always likable. Of all of their great Westerns, including  ""Winchester '73,"" ""The Man From Laramie,"" ""Bend of The River,"" and others, probably the best film of their collaboration was ""The Naked Spur,"" a story about a vicious, psychopathic outlaw captured by a group competing with each other to collect the bounty on the outlaw's head. The outlaw, played by relish and glee by Robert Ryan, uses the group's collective and individual greed against them in a bid to escape.

Stewart's performance is spectacular, ranging wildly from bitter to sympathetic, nervous to resolute, and the rest of the cast is also dynamic and evenly matched.

Unfortunately, the DVD of this film is garbage, it's pan and scan, and softly focused to the point of being distracting.  This film desperately needs to be redone for Blu-Ray.  As a lover of Westerns, I rank only ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"" ahead of ""The Naked Spur"".  It deserves better than this third-rate DVD.",1043539200,,812,4.75

7820731,4,6302032237,"The Naked Spur was the 3rd of 5 Jimmy Stewart westerns directed by Anthony Mann and, arguably, the best.  Although many westerns from the 1940s and 50s seem better suited for black-and-white cinematography (checkout Mann-Stewart western Winchester 73  their first) The Naked Spur technicolor is easy on the eye, especially the outdoor sequences, while the leather and dirt and frayed clothing of the era remain gritty and detailed.  The only thing that Always bothers me about color westerns (from this era) is the women Always wear too much makeup (this time Janet Leigh In Naked Spur).  It seems much easier to hide realistic makeup look in black-and-white westerns.
But,
The Naked Spur is led by a cast of characters pretty much all (even lawman Jimmy Stewart) with some suspect moral background or motives.  Ralph Meeker just about steals the show as the ex soldier recently dishonorably discharged who goes along for the ride to transport the manipulating murderer with the 5000 dollar bounty on his head played by Robert Ryan.  Robert Ryan - who can play a villain with the best - overdoes it a bit with the cocky, never scared for a minute laughter.
Millard Mitchell helps carry out the transport as Jesse the gold miner at heart (who has yet to strike it big, of course).
And Janet Leigh is the naive (or is she?) young beauty on the lam with Ryan.
This is a better than 4 star western that is basically a classic for good reason.",1513728000,,1438,4.732
