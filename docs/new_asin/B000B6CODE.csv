2403487,5,B000B6CODE,"I love Jeopardy! and the host Alex Trebek and Jeopardy! is one of my all-time favorite shows and some evenings when you are eating Salt and Vinegar chips and are hanging out with a friend of yours, you and him have to watch those old-time and new Jeopardy! episodes and they are the best and you'll notice in the first Jeopardy! Alex Trebek is a lot younger there in 1984.

Jeopardy! Jeopardy! What a great DVD you can watch in the car someday if there is a DVD player in your vehicle and during the drive, you can just sit back, relax and enjoy JEOPARDY!

For an example, you'll be as close to Jeopardy! without watching baseball or a rodeo without putting a piggin' string between your teeth or a buck rein between your fingers. Remember folks, take a deep seat during a drive, hit the play button of all episodes and let 'er buck!

This DVD is never going out of print and will never be unavailable which I know as it'll be available forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and they'll just keep making more copies of Jeopardy! for other people to buy and they'll always love it. Don't let this DVD be unavailable someday, because that might break someone's heart and they would sure miss it.

OK, don't think about that now, just go onto something different to relax like here's a good one for you. Well, we do things like this. Let's imagine this balloon and this is an uranium atom. We take the atom, and we shoot it with a neutron. BANG! In Paul sakes, vibrates, and splits it into two seperate atoms in a rafter and it gives us energy. Do you think that is very funny! That is in the first episode in 1984 and that's what the contestant Greg Hopkins said.

1987 marked the first teen tournament. Since then, the teen tournament has gone on to provide us with some of our most memorable contestants like Eric Newhouse.

So then, the episodes on this DVD are:

#1: Episode #1: September 17, 1984 -? Season One
Contestants: Greg Hopkins vs. Lois Feinstein vs. Frank Selibas
First Episode of Jeopardy
#2: Episode #4657: November 30, 2004 -? Season Twenty-One
Contestants: Ken Jennings vs. Nancy Zerg vs. David Hankins
Ken Jennings 75th and Final Episode
#3: Episode #4783, May 23, 2005 -? Season Twenty-One
Ultimate Tournament of Champions Finals -? Day 1
Contestants: Jerome Vered vs. Brad Rutter vs. Ken Jennings
#4: Episode #4784, May 24, 2005 - Season Twenty-One
Ultimate Tournament of Champions Finals ?- Day 2
Contestants: Jerome Vered vs. Brad Rutter vs. Ken Jennings
#5: Episode #4785, May 25, 2005 -? Season Twenty-One
Ultimate Tournament of Champions Finals ? Day 3 [FINAL DAY]
Contestants: Jerome Vered vs. Brad Rutter vs. Ken Jennings

My only top favorite episode of Jeopardy! is Jeopardy's 1st in 1984, and that's the only one I would imagine myself to be in as I said, Greg Hopkins is really my favorite character and should really put me in mind of Joe Beaver a lot, and the first one in 1984 is really my only favorite episode, it really is!.

Episodes are:
1. Jeopardy's 1st episode hosted by Alex Trebek in 1984
2. Ken Jennings's 75th loosing episode
3. ULTIMATE I: Anyone's Game, Ultimate Finals
4. ULTIMATE II: Brad Takes Control, Ultimate Finals
5. ULTIMATE III: The Final Showdown, Ultimate Finals

The contestants on this DVD are the best and they are in 1984 are Frank Selibas, Lois Feinstein and Greg Hopkins, and in 2004 are David Hankins, Nancy Zerg and Ken Jennings and in 2005 in the Ultimate Finals are Jerome Vered, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings.

Jerome Vered looks a lot like Rick MacCuish, Brad Rutter looks a lot like Mike Moorehouse and Ken Jennings looks a lot like John Kerr and there's a couple of contestants look like some guys I know and that is so amazing that JEOPARDY! is the best and wonderful.

So, Jeopardy's 1st in 1984 looks simular to the 1987, 1988, 1990 & 1995 National Finals Rodeo (NFR) in Las Vegas, Nevada when Lane Frost was the 1987 world champion Bull Rider and then, 1987 marked the first teen tournament. Since then, the teen tournament has gone on to provide us with some of our most memorable contestants like Eric Newhouse. So the Jeopardy's 1st episode hosted by Alex Trebek looks just simular to the 1987, 1988, 1990 & 1995 NFR in Las Vegas, Nevada when Frank Selibas would be the left-handed calf roper James Zant, Lois Feinstein would be be the Former Miss Rodeo America, past World Champion Breakaway Roper, popular national rodeo spokeswomen, Tad Lucas Award Winner, Lane Frost Award Winner and TV commentator Pam Minnick, and Greg Hopkins would be the 8-time world champion roper Joe Beaver and Jeopardy's 1st episode hosted by Alex Trebek looks just simular to the 1987, 1988, 1990 & 1995 NFR in Las Vegas, Nevada when Frank Selibas would be the left-handed calf roper James Zant, Lois Feinstein would be Pam Minnick, and Greg Hopkins would be the 8-time world champion Joe Beaver. A great unbelievably great character Greg Hopkins is, as Greg's a great character and my favortie top player of Jeopardy, the first man who ever won on Jeopardy, Greg's probably the best man, he really is and I like him as my only favorite man on Jeopardy!- Greg should put me in mind of the world champion of the 8-time world Champion Joe Beaver, as Greg Hopkins is definitely perfect for Joe Beaver, and that's who Greg just reminds me of as the rodeo cowboy roper Joe Beaver! :)

So the Ultimate Finals of ULTIMATE I: ANYONE'S GAME, ULTIMATE 2: BRAD TAKES CONTROL & ULTIMATE III: THE FINALS SHOWDOWN will for sure look simular to the 2006 Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas, Nevada and can't wait to buy the 2006 Wrangler NFR on DVD next year but, no time to think about that yet, but Ken Jennings is the very, very best.

That's all the perfect with the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas, Nevada for JEOPARDY! with the rodeo people like James Zant, Pam Minnick and Joe Beaver, definitely perfect for Jeopardy's 1st in 1984, and that's the perfect done deal.

When they had 30 seconds in the Final Jeopardy, the music was beautiful as they were thinking by writing down there answers.

Here's a great example for Final Jeopardy and the category is Holidays and the question is:
The third Monday of January starting in 1986. The answer is Martin Luther King day.

Well, keep watching all of the four episodes of Ken Jennings.
I am saying so long.
Happy trails to JEOPARDY!
It is the best old time shows ever to watch over and over again everyday.

I loved, enjoyed, and liked this DVD and it is the best ever!!![...]

What a CLASSIC DVD OF JEOPARDY! Let 'er buck!",1225497600,2,6565,4.586177474402731
2403488,4,B000B6CODE,"This DVD has a handful of extras that provide interesting background information about the show, its history, and behind-the-scenes production, but the centerpiece is its presentation of five episodes of the show itself: the first episode with Alex Trebek, the final episode of Ken Jennings's record-breaking run, and the monumental three-episode Ultimate Tournament of Champions. Playing along on these episodes is a super challenge for Jeopardy! wannabes.",1207180800,2,457,5.835820895522388
2403489,5,B000B6CODE,"This dvd is very great and wonderful, especially since it has the complete first Jeopardy show, from 1984! It is really incredible to see that 1st J. show again! I wish all of Jeopardy's (to date) 22 years would be released on DVD. Wouldn't that be something! Alex Trebek is incredible. He is the greatest celebrity of all time, in my humble opinion. Long live both Alex, and Jeopardy, the greatest guy and show ever on TV!",1161388800,9,423,4.5064935064935066
2403490,5,B000B6CODE,"These video is awesome. I have been a jeopardy since I was 5 years and now I am 21.  I thought it was really cool for the video to include the very 1st show hosted by Alex Trebek, man what a difference in 21 years.  I also thought it was cool for them to include Ken Jennings last episode especially because the tape I have it on broke and I was very disappointed when that happen.  I hope that jeopardy last forever.",1140480000,3,417,4.060975609756097
2403491,5,B000B6CODE,"Wow This DOES have it all! The first episode hosted by Alex in 1984. He looks WAY younger! Ken Jennings' last regular game apperance and the final three UTOC games, plus behind the senes featurettes you won't find anywhere else! A must have for any Jeopardy fan!",1136505600,17,262,4.595744680851064
2403492,5,B000B6CODE,"This is a good DVD.  Yup, after Jeopardy! deletes a 5-day champion restriction.  A history is made, Ken Jennings went on to win 74 games and won 2 and a half million dollars before he lost to Nancy Zerg.  I watched that game and it was very good.  Also, I watched the 3 games of the UTOC fianl of Jeopardy!  It is fantastic for me.  It is a totally good UTOC match.  However, it is the fantastic moment for Brad Rutter who wins 2 million dollars at the end.  Also, for the extras, it is good and it provides the fantastic 21 years of questions and answers.  Overall, this is a good DVD.",1132617600,6,586,4.115044247787611
2403493,3,B000B6CODE,"It is just so surprising that when just so many television shows go straight to home video on VHS and DVD, there just happens to be no room for one of the most challenging of all shows, quiz shows. Nevertheless, that has been sad for die hard fand os shows like Family Feud, The Price Is Right, and Wheel Of Fortune, because there just have been so many great memories. But, that has all changed with Jeopardy! This long-time challenging game show which stars Alex Trebek has been a constant for television for over 20 years, and has no signs of stopping. But the real answer is that is this DVD really worth the money to shell out?

Jeopardy- An Inside Look at America's Favorite Quiz Show  showcases one of the best game shows on television around. The DVD hioghlights so many great extras including a glimpse of behind the scenes and a showcase of how the questions are being written and delivered to the viewing audience. While the extras do deliver very well, the DVD also includes 5 Jeopardy episodes to the table as well. That is where the DVD loses a bit of steam. Most of those episodes feature Jeopardy contestant Ken Jennings whose near 80 episode run was just unreal. Those episodes include the final three days of Jeopardy's 2005 four month long Ultimate Tournament Of Champions to see who would be the best from the past against Ken for $2,000,000, and the episode where Jennings finally loses. The only episode standout is the very first time Alex ever stepped on the stage and delivered Jeopardy in syndication back in 1984, and made his way into history. Yet, while this might be the only standout on the DVD, many die hard finds might seem a bit dissapointed that other Jeopardy! greats weren't highlighted equally such as Eddie Timanus, the first blind contestant to win 5 days in a row, or Tom Cubbage who was the only contendor to win the College Tournament and the $100,000 Tournament Of Champions, or even Robin Caroll, the highest grossing female contestant in the shows history.

All in all, Jeopardy doesn't completely deliver to what die hard fans might've hoped for other than Ken Jennings. But, for anybody who hasn't even seen this dynamic contestant in action, this is worth taking a glance at. As for die hard fans, the answer is rent this one and don't buy it.
