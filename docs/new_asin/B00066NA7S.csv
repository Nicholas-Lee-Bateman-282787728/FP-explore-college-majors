The subject, kyokushin kai karate -the first full contact karate style, is interesting (and I am personaly a fanatic about it) but this dvd set is a disgrace.

The first DVD in the set is the worst.

It is available separately on amazon as ""Kyo Ku Shin Way This is True Karate "" and is 58 minutes in lenght.

Someone has gone trough their old video collection and dug up all their old 3rd generation vhs to vhs copies and captured them on their computer (with a bad video capturing program that ""skipps"" when the video signal gets to bad -which is frequently). Mixed the scenes about a bit, added a title screen in some video editing program and decided it was finished!

Im not kidding, it is old vhs copies (old, faded signal, with tension distortions at the edges and everything else that goes with very old and used vhs tapes) from the 70ies and 80ies. Ive  seen most of them before, and I kind of doubt they have gotten the rights to use the material. Most are still commersialy available as vhs (in good quality), in japan.

There are no subtext to the japanese sound and text shown, but that is ok since the scenes are so mixed up that the sound (which are from the originals) makes no sense anyway.

Most of it are barely viewable short clips from old world open tournaments. All mixed together.

The second DVD is slightly better, but not by much.

it is 23 minues in length, and is available spearately ""Kyo Ku Shin Kai's Mas Oyama - d"" on amazon.

It begins almost the same. Very bad quality ripoffs from other releases and then goes on to some videofilms at training camps during the 90ies. It shows a few minutes of black-and-white old footage of Mas Oyama (the founder of kyokushin karate), but then it goes back to the training camp clips again.

Yet again we get to watch a lot of blank screens where the capture program has not been able to capture the vhs video signal.

As a kyokushin karate practicioner, as a fan of martial arts in general and karate in particular, I have to warn people about this one. The quality is abysmal and so far from profesional it is almost funny. At times there are more frozen pictures and blank screens due to the horrible capture, than it is actual moving movie. But with the price set for it (currently $49.95), it is not amusing anymore.

I cannot belive that someone actualy released this!

The subject may be interesting, but this DVD is junk and border line scam!",1116201600,21,2521,4.438177874186551
