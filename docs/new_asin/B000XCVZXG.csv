3001759,5,B000XCVZXG,"A moody exquisitely animated interpretation of the classic story with the familiar musical score by Prokofiev, suitable for adults and older children.  The modern ending is a twist on the traditional finale.  Special Features highlight the laborious process of producing the short film over a 5 year period.",1231459200,5,307,5.375

3001761,2,B000XCVZXG,"I hoped to make it as a gift to teach a youngster about instruments of the orchestra. Very little emphasis is placed on instruments and their role in character development. The story line is revisionist from the original. Hunters are militaristic, mean and ineffective. The duck is a meal for the wolf and never rescued. The wolf is not shot by the hunters, but rescued and placed in a game preserve. I found it to be an overall disappointment!",1229299200,11,444,4.632911392405063
3001762,5,B000XCVZXG,"Suzie Templeton may be little known outside of the world of stop motion animation circles, but she is an incredible talent with a penchant for dark, thoughtful and sometimes twisted short subjects.  With Peter and the Wolf she delves more into the mainstream and handles her biggest project to date.

Templeton has weaved together an international co-production between studios in Britain and Poland, using stop motion animation and digital effects to create a modern retelling of the Sergei Prokofiev musical.

There are plenty of reviews of the movie itself, but the amazon.com description does not include information about the plethora of extras on this new Region 1 DVD.  Included are:

The musical themes
The story in pictures
The making of Peter & the Wolf
Behind the scenes documentary
Audio commentary
Educational workshop

If you are worried about buying an $18 DVD for just a 32 minute feature, you can rest assured you are getting much more than that.",1228953600,54,963,5.063291139240507
3001763,5,B000XCVZXG,"""Peter And The Wolf"" (2008)
Technically stunning, and thematically dark, this amazing adaptation of Sergei Prokoviev's classic children's piece, features marvelous stop-motion animation from director Suzie Templeton.

The film places ""Peter"" squarely back into its Russian origins, but rather than an idealized rural-agrarian past, it places the story in a more modern setting, amid glum, drab, rundown shacks and tattered forests, a grim vision of a Soviet-era or post-Soviet Eastern Europe, complete with gun-toting thugs (the hunters of the original story here seem more like cold-hearted militiamen) and the nearby village appears as a rundown, dismal cinderblock outpost. Amid this crushing gloom, Peter finds wonder and joy, unlocking a secret garden where he and his friends the bird and the duck (both crippled and unable to fly) are able to play and forget the bleakness around them.

While this may sound a bit miserable, the film itself is a marvel: the amount of work that went into this film is amazing, with Templeton devoting a full five years of her life to completing the piece. Equally engrossing are the added special features, including a making-of video and interview with Templeton and her cohorts that gives a sense of the sheer scope of their project, and the level of detail that went into this production. While the film itself may be a bit dark for smaller children, it will enthrall older kids and adults alike... This is a real class act, a film worth having and viewing for years to come.  Recommended!  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1228176000,113,1569,5.1171875
3001764,5,B000XCVZXG,"This unique stop-motion version of the classical musical tale was justly awarded the Academy Award for best animated short in 2007.  With its detailed models and wonderful animation, this is truly an enchanting version of how the young Peter makes a name for himself by capturing a mean and hungry wolf. Prokofiev's classic score is handled in high style here and is a treat for the ear. There are also delightful characters throughout ranging of the balloon-riding bird to the sly cat.  The wolf is especially forbidding and adds a real sense of menace missing in some versions.  Many folks familiar with this classic will be caught off-guard by the surprise ending, which teaches a rather touching lesson.  For fans of the stop-motion technique, this is definitely a must-have flick!",1227225600,9,785,5.015384615384615
3001765,5,B000XCVZXG,"I saw this on British television last Christmas season and am so glad to see it is finally being released in USA/Canada format. I do a big unit each year with my younger children in school on this musical composition, so this will be at the top of my wish list to order. I recommend it highly, as an antidote to the silly, sugary sweet Disney and other versions. It will appeal to your second and third grade students, and will engage and enthrall them with the animation and high production values.",1226016000,7,499,4.434782608695652
3001766,5,B000XCVZXG,"Just watched on PBS.  This film is stunning to look at, tells an amazing story. Incredible articulation of the characters.  Reminds me of vintage russian animations (if you've ever seen ""Masters of Russian Animation"" it's the same feel.)  An instant classic. Can't wait for my copy!",1223769600,34,282,5.086956521739131

3001772,5,B000XCVZXG,"This rendition of Peter and the Wolf has amazing stop motion photography, with no narrative, just Prokofiev's wonderful music.  The beginning, however, shows one of the hunters being quite a bully to Peter and even puts him into a dumpster.  I am a music teacher, so I skip this part and just start it at the next spot of fast forward on the DVD.  That is just before Peter goes out into the garden.  The grandfather is depicted as very stern and cross, actually locking Peter inside the cabin (supposedly so he won't get hurt by the wolf).  The duck does get realistically eaten by the wolf and does not return, as was depicted in the Disney version.  It shows Peter being very compassionate of animals and the wolf, who is let free at the end by Peter after the mean hunter jabbed at the wolf while it was caged and the grandfather almost sold it to a carnival type show.  The music is clear and beautifully performed by the London Philharmonia.  I highly recommend this.",1485475200,,973,4.488636363636363
3001773,2,B000XCVZXG,The music was as great as ever and the animation was good. I really liked the facial expressions and use of eye language between the characters. But the audio was ahead of the video in many places that made it a terrible viewing experience.,1483747200,,240,4.4772727272727275

My only caveat was the depiction of the grandfather as a menacing figure, rather than a protective caretaker.",1482624000,,161,5.48
3001780,2,B000XCVZXG,"The music is always good.  The animation was choppy and weird.  The duck and cat had more facial expression than Peter did.  I can't have my grand daughters (8 y/o) see it.  The wolf is much too scary and scraggly for them. Sorry Suzie, I can't recommend it.",1481760000,,258,4.3125
3001781,4,B000XCVZXG,"Of course this award winning adaptation of Peter and the Wolf is very good.  However, watching it with my 8 year old, leads me to believe that children would probably enjoy it more with a narrator as Sergei Prokofiev originally wrote it in 1936.  Catherine kept asking me questions about who the characters are and why they did certain things.  For instance she wanted to know who the mean old man was and why he was after Peter.  From this version there really is no way for a child to know that the mean old man is Peter's grandfather who is trying to protect him from the dangers of the forest.  In this version too, Children are not told to listen for the duck quacking in the wolf's stomach because in his hurry the wolf swallowed him alive.  In this version the duck is just eaten.

If planning to watch this with children, I would suggest making yourself familar with the original story, not the Disney version and be prepared to narrate or at least to answer questions.  This version does change somethings, particularly the ending, but if you know the story, you shouldn't get lost.",1481587200,4,1091,4.530612244897959

3001807,5,B000XCVZXG,"It is a darker version than what the kids might be used to, but it's a sad story (not that we buy into the bad wolf-rhetoric). The duck is gone. I think it's important every now and than to talk about sad stories even with kids. It's a way of preparing them for their future (which hopefully will be all great and rosy, but most likely not). We had a great time talking about bullies and this version has a nice ending in which Peter actually saves the wolf. There is a very important message of forgiveness and responsibility in here that is highly appreciable.",1462147200,3,562,4.3619047619047615
3001808,5,B000XCVZXG,"Fantastic version.  As a music teacher, we learned the story & music first, then watched - very different (and more affecting) version than I've ever experienced before.  The students felt such empathy for Peter.  Although I didn't show the very beginning (hunters' bullying Peter) to the youngest students.  My own kids who are teens even liked this film.",1461715200,,356,5.086206896551724
3001809,2,B000XCVZXG,"This is a completely different version of Peter and the Wolf from what I remember. In the version I remember, it was much more about the music. It was much more kid friendly. There were no bullies, soldiers, grouchy old men, etc. Sasha the duck did not get eaten by the wolf. Maybe the critics like this version better, but I sure don't. There were some good scenes, like the sliding on the ice outside the gate, and letting the wolf get away at the end, but on balance it was much harsher than it needed to be, questionable for children and not of much interest to anyone else. I could not find the older version that I have seen. I would be interested in getting a copy if anyone knows where it can be found.",1461542400,,710,4.227941176470588

3001811,2,B000XCVZXG,"This is not really for small children, as the compose intended. It is dark and scary for anyone under six, and there is none of the traditional narration. Also. there is not a lot of action to keep young children amused and interested. The first five minutes have no music what-so-ever. May be okay for older children, but will give the little ones nightmares, and I doubt they will understand the story without the narration. The setting is modern day-Peter gets put in a dumpster by a gang of kids in a modern day Russian city.

3001847,5,B000XCVZXG,"Love this video... it's a different take on the classic, as it has no narration. However, that forces kids to really listen to the music and infer from the video. Great way for kids to learn about classical woodwinds!",1439510400,,217,4.589743589743589

3001853,4,B000XCVZXG,"4 out of 5! Why..? Well it is dark, not something I'd recommend for the G audience but as a 20 year old, I could watch it and find interest in trying to figure out what the sort of Unspoken story is (Hint: They don't talk throughout it.) I found it intellectually stimulating in essentially its whole style seeing as it's quite different and you're left to sort of draw your own conclusions (Once again the characters don't talk.) And though I wouldn't call it engrossing, I would call it interesting. It held my attention and that is a feat!",1437609600,,542,4.43

If you like to see very well done technical work watch this. If you let a kid below age 9 watch it, be prepared to do some explaining as some aspects may be disturbing or confusing to a child used to the pablum of main stream TV.",1436400000,,390,4.144736842105263

3001867,3,B000XCVZXG,"I have the 1946 Disney cartoon version of P&TW (color) that I converted from VHS to DVD and found it impossible not to compare this claymation (I think) version with the Disney version.  Disney tells the story in 15 minutes where as this version is told in 30 minutes.  While my grandchildren have seen our Disney version at least five times before they watched this version, I noticed that this version does not hold their interest for as long.  Perhaps because it is not in the cartoon style they are used too.  The story is wonderful no matter how it is told and the music is the glue but I must conclude as do my grandchildren that Disney's interpretation is just better.  Hope you get the change to compare them.",1435536000,,717,4.484615384615385
3001868,5,B000XCVZXG,"My son and I both love this movie... I watched it on PBS when I was pregnant and to my surprise, my son, who is now 4 years old, loves it too! The music is very soothing and helps to display the mood and emotions of the characters throughout the movie, it certainly wouldn't be the same without it. The film uses a stop-frame technique with what appears to be life like clay models. I love this about the film because it gives it more of an old school yet contemporary look instead of it being all computer animated. They don't make movies like this anymore!",1435276800,,558,4.273584905660377

The music is the main player announcing the next actor ....each instrument and melody announces a certain player...........at least that was intended.
This is a total disaster and I bought it for my grandkids  but........... this is the stuff nightmares are made of. Total insult to the composer and mental child abuse. This is the stuff horror movies are made of. It could not be worse. Sorry.",1407801600,,655,4.7368421052631575

3001975,4,B000XCVZXG,"This is a cute adaptation of Peter & The Wolf.  It preserves Prokofiev's music while somewhat changing the story line.  My seven year-old was entranced as was his older sister.  I explained the link between music and character.  This was quite easy for the animals and all it took was one comment for each of the grandfather, Peter, and the huntsmen.",1399248000,,350,4.688524590163935
3001976,3,B000XCVZXG,"I really enjoyed watching this version of Peter and the Wolf.

What I liked was the style of animation, the lack of dialogue, the story, and being able to hear Prokofiev's music.

I would NEVER play this for my elementary music classes.  Even my 5th graders.  A bully pushes Peter, throws him in the dumpster, then points a rifle at him.

I think this is a very unique, interesting, but depressing take on Peter and the Wolf...I find it suitable for teens or adults only.",1398729600,2,471,4.4941176470588236

3001979,4,B000XCVZXG,"I wasn't sure at first if this really was ""Peter and the Wolf"" as I learned it as a child because there is no music in the beginning.

3001981,5,B000XCVZXG,Old school animation but very good.  Story is sweet but poignant.  Wish his pal hadn't been brutalized...not for kids at least American. We tend to want the happy ending but really who doesnt.  Peter's a pretty grim kid and bullies seem to contribute so we understand his frustration.  As someone who grew up in era if Gumby & Pokey..baby boomers will appreciate the work & effort which go into a film like this.  I found it nostalgic too.,1397520000,,439,4.576923076923077
3001982,5,B000XCVZXG,Loved the story when I was a child. Music is of course timeless. This take is a new one and the graphics and characters are fantastic. Don't miss it. It isn't only for the children.,1397088000,,181,4.2
3001983,1,B000XCVZXG,"I bought this DVD to replace the Disney Classic VHS my school currently owns.  I previewed this movie and was stunned!  I read other reviews stating that this would be a great movie for elementary classrooms.  This version is WAY TO SCARY to show to elementary aged children.
I did not finish the movie - the opening scene has Peter being bullied, a gun pointed at him, and people smoking.  That alone is enough for me to know that this is NOT APPROPRIATE for K-5 age children.

Elementary music teachers - save your money!!",1396915200,2,524,4.531914893617022
3001984,3,B000XCVZXG,"This animation was bizarre. There are no words, but the maker did a great job of telling the story without words. There is death in this animation. I wasn't expecting it, but when it happened it didn't seem to effect my 8 y.o. Nephew.",1396656000,,234,4.340909090909091
3001985,5,B000XCVZXG,"Filled with stunning creative skills of the creators of this stop motion movie.
Amazing realism in human expressions, especially of the main character boy and his eyes.
The story is only 30 & some minutes. There is no words in the movie.
No subtitles to read. Very easy to watch it through.
You'd need a taste for ""Indy/Foreign"" movies to enjoy as it is not one of those Hollywood flavored one.

I just read in Wikipedia that There have been some changes from the original Prokofiev story.
I don't know what those changes mean since I don't know the original story.
Nonetheless, I liked this movie a lot.

3001987,2,B000XCVZXG,"This was my mistake. I really did not want my granddaughter to SEE Peter and the Wolf. I wanted her to HEAR it so that she would concentrate on the musical instruments and story line. The visual distracts from my intended goals. The visual is also too dark for my 7 year old.

3001991,5,B000XCVZXG,"In an era of fast paced films with pithy dialogue, at best, this short film is a welcomed surprise.  In less than 30 minutes it developed a character and did it without one word being spoken throughout the film.  My 8 year old son usually only has the patience for big blockbuster action films; however, he was mesmerized by this short and wanted to watch it again.  The score that accompanied the film was a fantastic replacement for dialogue.  Or perhaps it was the visual that was a great accompaniment to the music!",1395014400,,519,4.548387096774194

3001995,4,B000XCVZXG,The quality of the stop-motion animation is superb. Well-crafted characters that look almost real. My 12-year old son also enjoyed it for its beauty (and particularly for the character of the cat).

I am not sure how closely it follows the actual book but it was enjoyable nonetheless.  I would like to see the director/producer create one that follows the storyline to the tee.  I would also like to see him make more of these for the classic stories like Goldilocks, Red Riding Hood and so forth.  It would be a fun collection to own.",1392336000,,461,4.428571428571429

3002040,4,B000XCVZXG,"Peter and the Wolf is one of those stories that I'd always heard about, but never read. I didn't even see the old Disney short based on it! Somehow, the story always seemed to slip by me, while I'd be reading about Little Red Riding Hood and many of the other classics. Tonight I wanted to watch a movie, and while my queue has barely been touched for the last year, I decided to go with something I recently put on there- this version of Peter and the Wolf. Yeah, it's barely over 30 minutes long, and is more of a short film than anything. Still, I started it up, and my daughter decided to join me. She loves stop motion movies too, and even likes it when I show her the special features for movies like Fantastic Mr. Fox where the puppets and their sets are shown being brought to life. So this was a cool bonus for her.

Peter is a young boy who lives in the woods with his grandfather. They're well-protected from the outside, having a massive fence built around their home. Peter has a duck that's basically his only friend, and one day they head to town for some chores. Advertisements for the circus are everywhere, with a ballerina bear shown on the posters. Poor Peter bumps into some local ruffians while there, and they throw him in a dumpster and even act like they're going to shoot him with a rifle after he's been dumped. Back home, a crippled bird lands by Peter and the duck. It wants them to go outside. They eventually do, and that's when it starts. Their home is protected for a reason- there's a wolf prowling around outside, and it has its eyes on these easy targets, which also includes a very fat cat that came out to get the crippled bird. Weaponless, what's Peter to do?

Because the movie is so short, and it's based on a well-known (aside from in my case I guess) tale, it's hard to not spoil the story. We'll just say that overall, the movie isn't too dark and yet it definitely doesn't sugarcoat anything, featuring a small amount of blood and one death. My daughter is six years old and she wasn't disturbed by any of the imagery or violent scenes. It was a downer for both of us when a certain death happened, but it isn't lingered on. I was really impressed with the puppets used in this movie, and most of the animation is fantastic. There are only a couple of times when something wasn't animated very well (the cat drying its legs after it fell through the frozen pond stood out). It's nothing major, and it easily forgiven, especially considering this isn't a huge feature length film. Details like Peter's facial expressions say more than words ever could.

Speaking of words, no one talks in this movie. This may bother some, so it's worth mentioning for those who don't like this for whatever the reason.

After the movie was over and I went to rate it, my daughter saw that I was going to give it 4 stars, but insisted that it should get 5. I was surprised! She was into it, and even quit playing Animal Crossing: New Leaf about 5 minutes in. It's always a pleasure to see new stop motion films, and this was certainly a treat.",1374451200,2,3070,4.371278458844133

3002052,5,B000XCVZXG,"Made with puppets filmed in stop-motion (with real-life backgrounds), this half-hour animated short is an absolute delight. It begins in a very bleak way: Peter lives in a very poor shack, and is forbidden to go out the fences that surround it, presumably because of the lurking wolf. We see his poor daily life depicted in almost complete silence. Only when he finds a way out of the fences does the familiar music, along with the familiar story, kick in. And all of a sudden, everything becomes joyous and playful. The duck, who looked miserably starved, finds a new life on the outside. The cat, which served as a vaguely menacing figure in the first part, becomes first-rate comedy material. Even the disabled crow starts oozing a glowing charm.

The wolf was bound to appear sooner or later though, at which point the movie enters a more nuanced mood. I'm not going to spoil what happens next, in case you don't already know Prokofiev's tale, although even those who are familiar with it may be in for a couple of surprises.

The animation itself is brilliant and I found it genuinely mesmerizing despite the fact that the stop-motion puppets usually are not my favourite animation technique. The puppets themselves are the stars of the show, being incredibly detailed and infused with personality. In fact, only Peter himself appears disappointingly generic. Is it because the director wanted every kid to be able to easily identify with him? If that is the reason, it was not worth the trade-off.

As far as I can tell, the music is completely faithful to Prokofiev's partition, and the animation does play with the music a lot. It sometimes makes the film appear a little too "" literal"", but this is a very minor complain and overall the interaction between music and action is very competent. For the sake of mentioning everything that was less than perfect, I have to add that I found the pacing of the last scene a bit too slow. Again, though, this is easily forgiven in light of everything that is done right!

I recommend this movie to everyone, no matter their preferences in animation techniques. Some might be rebutted by the beginning's grim mood, but stick with it and you'll be rewarded with very delightful scenes. It's also very suitable for children, who will find this version less frightening than Disney's.",1365033600,,2331,4.805486284289277

The mood is set during the first five minutes of the piece, and Prokofiev's music doesn't begin until Petr opens the gate to what seems to be held as ""the wild"", which is wonderful in that it is so much nicer than the world Petr knows.  The music begins at this point and shows the wonder that Petr feels when he steps into the frontier that he's been forbidden to experience.  All in all, a great work.  If only all remakes/retellings could be this good.

Umm, spoiler alert:
Petr has a hard lesson to learn during this story.  It's a lesson that I've been slowly introducing to my young ones as they get bigger.  There are a lot of scary things out there in the world, but a hungry wolf in winter is still not as scary as an ignorant human with a gun.  The wolf is doing what it needs to stay alive, whereas humans that do terrible things rarely have anywhere near as good a reason, and unfortunately there are far more of the latter.  I was surprised but happy that this Petr showed compassion and understanding.  I didn't see forgiveness or contrition in either of their eyes, but I did seem to see some shared understanding, though that could just be because of how late it is...

3002081,5,B000XCVZXG,"This Peter follows closely to Prokofiev's music  - but, if you expect some narrator to carry you along, you'll find yourself all alone. The story emerges by itself, wordlessly, and does so in the most beautiful way. The Cat comes through with all the feline smugness you could hope for. The Hunter - well there's a whole new tension that I think Prokofiev never had in mind. If you grew up on the vapidized versions I did, this comes across with a harsh edge, resolved eventually in Peter's favor.

But, for me, this is all about the animation. As much as I love CGI, it has yet to capture the extra level of human involvement and craft that inheres in puppet animation. This isn't the ""happy ever after"" story the disneyfied version wants you to expect. Instead, it has kids dealing with harsh realities - the way they do in the real world, like it or not.

Good music, good animation, and it doesn't talk down to the viewer. Doesn't talk at all, really, but that's part of the appeal.

3002088,5,B000XCVZXG,"My testimonial: I have no connection WHATSOEVER in ANYWAY to this product other than as a consumer.

Some complaints, like the low rating ones here and others I've read elsewhere, hinged on the notion that because this version of ""Peter and the Wolf"" does not follow the original story line, it is therefore less worthy, and to this I say...

For whatever reason the original was made, this stop motion animation is superb, a masterpiece in its own right.  Do we care what the original purpose or reason for the atom bomb was?--No, as we now use nuclear power in many different ways than the original purpose.  Does it matter that we do not build our modern home like the original mud and stone design?--No, we created new versions of mud buildings.  The original version of this story exists and for those who cannot appreciate different expressions of the original, then please stick with the original--but don't knock this one down.  This modern version of Prokofiev's ""Peter and the Wolf"" is a beautiful piece, pain stakingly done--no one, despite their preference for whichever version of the story would deny this fact, so give credit where credit is due.

The accurate review for this version of ""Peter and the Wolf"" would be: This piece contains the most beautiful stop motion animation work I have ever seen; the story line is not the same as the original but the stop motion craftsmanship is extraordinarily fine and I love it for that; the focus of this version is more on the animated art form with Prokovief's music in the background.  As you watch the animation you get mesmerized by the claymation artists' skills: the expressions are fluidly delivered full with emotional meanings in all the characters.  Making a piece of clay tell you he is hurt, sad, angry, happy, etc., without using words takes exceptional skills--I was in awe, because I couldn't believe the life that came from those clay figures--and all done without words.  This skill-set and the beautiful music created a universal film able to reach into everyone's mind and heart without the barrier of language.  This is the beauty in this piece of work that the die-hard-original-version lovers missed or ignored.  As an adult I love this short film (I wish it was longer)--the kids I saw it with ages 5 and 13 were fine with the content.  They were not scared as in scary; they felt its realism--no different than a realistic Nature film. (I can't speak in this regard for all kids so you have to figure that out for yourself.)  This version is a lovingly well made film and the quality reflects the extra ordinary skills of all the artists involved in making this artistic expression of a story. When purchasing this dvd look for the ones with the extras it really gives an insight into this art form.",1303776000,11,2784,4.74896265560166

The purpose behind teaching ""Peter"" in an elementary music setting is to introduce theme and variation as well as the instruments of the orchestra. I've always been so frustrated by the versions of this which have a narrator. Who needs a narrator when you already have a visual for students to watch? The narrators always take away from students' ability to listen to the music. In this version, no narrator exists leaving the story to the music and the beautiful stop motion animation.

This little movie puts a wonderful new slant on the story. No longer is Peter the carefree little ratbag who gleefully catches a wolf and then blithely marches him off to the zoo. Peter is more closely related to my more interesting students - gentle, unsure of himself, frustrated with being a powerless boy and ready to make some big decisions.

The movie has its comical moments, and the animation is charming, but the brilliant way the story creates a multi-faceted tale means the music moves to an entirely different level for young viewers. They won't just understand the story, they will understand the feelings the music conveys. This brings the music not only to very young students, but to music students of any age.

3002106,4,B000XCVZXG,"Peter and the Wolf is a wonderfully dark retelling of the classic Sergei Prokofiev children's story/musical composition. Technically brilliant, fluidly animated, and lavishly detailed, it is among the finest examples of stop-motion animation. It's great for adults, but parents may want to screen it first before showing their kids, as there are some potentially scary imagery and realistic violence.

For example, right at the beginning, Peter goes to town and gets scared by a stuffed wolf in a shop window. He accidentally bumps into a hunter, who bullies him, and throws him in a dumpster. He then points his rifle at Peter. Later in the story, one of Peter's animal friends gets eaten. Lastly, Peter has the unblinking eyes, icy stare, and dour expressionless face of a plastic doll that younger kids may also find disturbing (see DVD cover). The harsh realities of rural Russian life are depicted here. It's certainly different than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disney/dp/6302961696/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disney</a>&nbsp;version that you may remember.

There is no dialogue or narration. Everything is told through images, music, and silence, and I thought perhaps the musical backbone of the original story took a back seat to the animation. In various versions I've seen, each character is represented by a strong and distinct musical instrument. Here, the soundtrack did not seem to give each character a unique voice. The music just seems to be part of the background rather than who the characters are.

Overall, still very good and definitely worth watching.",1263513600,2,1625,5.597560975609756
3002107,4,B000XCVZXG,"Downside: as observed in some one star reviews, this version scrimps on Prokofiev's music, which is odd, because the music is so ingenious, characterful, humorous, and charming. The rest is all upside: each of those adjectives also applies to the visual and story-book aspects of this Suzie Templeton version of Peter and the Wolf - and even if the fates of the duck and the wolf come out a little differently I couldn't bring myself to become Upset about it - but just enjoyed the ""alternate ending"". This movie made me laugh, but adults need to step back and try to view a little movie such as this from a child's perspective. Suzie Templeton has created an entertainment and a narrative that is deep and involving for a child. It stimulates their creativity, and involves them emotionally. It sensitively deals with a reality that is hopefully more brutal than what most of our children are experiencing, and shows a child overcoming adversity. Its only a million times better to have your child watch this than ""Power Rangers"" and occasionally children do need to take a few minutes break from videogames. If you think Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle, Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind and Henson's Mirrormask are great (although made with very different techniques), then you will probably also like Peter and the Wolf. Children's movies that are good for their little sould are too few and far between.

All feelings, words, and thoughts are expressed through the music and the intense look in Peter's eyes.  I have three children who love this movie, so it isn't too dark for young kids.  The duck, unfortunately, gets dispatched by the wolf.  I used this as a great opportunity to teach my kids that unfortunately, sometimes even the cute and cuddly animals don't make it.

I am glad it is now.  Suzie Templeton's short film is a example of the sustaining power and depth of Prokofiev's program music. The synthesis between the score and visual is seamless although the score was written decades ago. In this format, the descriptive nature of the music itself is clearly exemplified and personified. Film music is often written in response to the visual, while here the process is reversed. Templeton's greatest achievement is allowing the viewer to experience the complexity of this piece that Prokofiev ultimately wrote for children.

Furthermore, the extras included fill out the DVD package. A highlight is the documentary about the use of the ""Peter and the Wolf"" film as an educational tool to teach elementary school children about music, art, and the relationship between the two.

The film is not only entertaining it is educational.

I understand that this may not be the exact Peter and the Wolf story that some of the reviewers were expecting. It is, however, a very good story just as it is. It is a story of understanding, consequence, and acceptance.

First, the main feature is presented with an option to begin with the introduction that shows what instrument and theme are assigned to each character.  The feature itself is an extraordinary accomplishment, presenting a darker view of the tale than we are used to.  No Disney clownishness here.  Instead we have a gaunt, forlorn Peter, up against a pretty frightening wolf.

The extras include not only the making of documentary that was included with the PBS special, but also another subtitled Polish documentary.  Most fascinating is a rough print version, with some scenes fully completed, and others in various stages of completion.  This version shows a lot of the work that went into this labor-intensive project.

As for the reviewer who objected to the story variances, may I suggest that in future you headline such reviews with a ""spoiler alert.""  In any event, I do not find these changes to the classic tale objectionable, and they are certainly not contradicted by the music.

For the reviewer who was hoping for a music lesson, what can I say?  This film is so much more.

3236260,5,B000XCVZXG,"""Peter And The Wolf"" (2008)
Technically stunning, and thematically dark, this amazing adaptation of Sergei Prokoviev's classic children's piece, features marvelous stop-motion animation from director Suzie Templeton.

The film places ""Peter"" squarely back into its Russian origins, but rather than an idealized rural-agrarian past, it places the story in a more modern setting, amid glum, drab, rundown shacks and tattered forests, a grim vision of a Soviet-era or post-Soviet Eastern Europe, complete with gun-toting thugs (the hunters of the original story here seem more like cold-hearted militiamen) and the nearby village appears as a rundown, dismal cinderblock outpost. Amid this crushing gloom, Peter finds wonder and joy, unlocking a secret garden where he and his friends the bird and the duck (both crippled and unable to fly) are able to play and forget the bleakness around them.

While this may sound a bit miserable, the film itself is a marvel: the amount of work that went into this film is amazing, with Templeton devoting a full five years of her life to completing the piece. Equally engrossing are the added special features, including a making-of video and interview with Templeton and her cohorts that gives a sense of the sheer scope of their project, and the level of detail that went into this production. While the film itself may be a bit dark for smaller children, it will enthrall older kids and adults alike... This is a real class act, a film worth having and viewing for years to come.

With its detailed models and wonderful animation, this is truly an enchanting version of how the young Peter makes a name for himself by capturing a mean and hungry wolf. Prokofiev's classic score is handled in high style here and is a treat for the ear. There are also delightful characters throughout ranging of the balloon-riding bird to the sly cat.  The wolf is especially forbidding and adds a real sense of menace missing in some versions.  Many folks familiar with this classic will be caught off-guard by the surprise ending, which teaches a rather touching lesson.

I am a music teacher, so I skip this part and just start it at the next spot of fast forward on the DVD.  That is just before Peter goes out into the garden.  The grandfather is depicted as very stern and cross, actually locking Peter inside the cabin (supposedly so he won't get hurt by the wolf).  The duck does get realistically eaten by the wolf and does not return, as was depicted in the Disney version.  It shows Peter being very compassionate of animals and the wolf, who is let free at the end by Peter after the mean hunter jabbed at the wolf while it was caged and the grandfather almost sold it to a carnival type show.

3236277,2,B000XCVZXG,"The music is always good.  The animation was choppy and weird.  The duck and cat had more facial expression than Peter did.  I can't have my grand daughters (8 y/o) see it.  The wolf is much too scary and scraggly for them. Sorry Suzie, I can't recommend it.",1481760000,,258,4.3125
3236278,4,B000XCVZXG,"Of course this award winning adaptation of Peter and the Wolf is very good.  However, watching it with my 8 year old, leads me to believe that children would probably enjoy it more with a narrator as Sergei Prokofiev originally wrote it in 1936.  Catherine kept asking me questions about who the characters are and why they did certain things.  For instance she wanted to know who the mean old man was and why he was after Peter.  From this version there really is no way for a child to know that the mean old man is Peter's grandfather who is trying to protect him from the dangers of the forest.  In this version too, Children are not told to listen for the duck quacking in the wolf's stomach because in his hurry the wolf swallowed him alive.  In this version the duck is just eaten.

If planning to watch this with children, I would suggest making yourself familar with the original story, not the Disney version and be prepared to narrate or at least to answer questions.  This version does change somethings, particularly the ending, but if you know the story, you shouldn't get lost.",1481587200,4,1091,4.530612244897959

There were some good scenes, like the sliding on the ice outside the gate, and letting the wolf get away at the end, but on balance it was much harsher than it needed to be, questionable for children and not of much interest to anyone else.

May be okay for older children, but will give the little ones nightmares, and I doubt they will understand the story without the narration.

This was quite easy for the animals and all it took was one comment for each of the grandfather, Peter, and the huntsmen.",1399248000,,350,4.688524590163935
3236473,3,B000XCVZXG,"I really enjoyed watching this version of Peter and the Wolf.

What I liked was the style of animation, the lack of dialogue, the story, and being able to hear Prokofiev's music.

I would NEVER play this for my elementary music classes.  Even my 5th graders.  A bully pushes Peter, throws him in the dumpster, then points a rifle at him.

3236478,5,B000XCVZXG,Old school animation but very good.  Story is sweet but poignant.  Wish his pal hadn't been brutalized...not for kids at least American. We tend to want the happy ending but really who doesnt.  Peter's a pretty grim kid and bullies seem to contribute so we understand his frustration.  As someone who grew up in era if Gumby & Pokey..baby boomers will appreciate the work & effort which go into a film like this.  I found it nostalgic too.,1397520000,,439,4.576923076923077

I did not finish the movie - the opening scene has Peter being bullied, a gun pointed at him, and people smoking.  That alone is enough for me to know that this is NOT APPROPRIATE for K-5 age children.

Elementary music teachers - save your money!!",1396915200,2,524,4.531914893617022

Amazing realism in human expressions, especially of the main character boy and his eyes.
The story is only 30 & some minutes. There is no words in the movie.
No subtitles to read. Very easy to watch it through.
You'd need a taste for ""Indy/Foreign"" movies to enjoy as it is not one of those Hollywood flavored one.

I just read in Wikipedia that There have been some changes from the original Prokofiev story.
I don't know what those changes mean since I don't know the original story.

3236537,4,B000XCVZXG,"Peter and the Wolf is one of those stories that I'd always heard about, but never read. I didn't even see the old Disney short based on it! Somehow, the story always seemed to slip by me, while I'd be reading about Little Red Riding Hood and many of the other classics. Tonight I wanted to watch a movie, and while my queue has barely been touched for the last year, I decided to go with something I recently put on there- this version of Peter and the Wolf. Yeah, it's barely over 30 minutes long, and is more of a short film than anything. Still, I started it up, and my daughter decided to join me. She loves stop motion movies too, and even likes it when I show her the special features for movies like Fantastic Mr. Fox where the puppets and their sets are shown being brought to life. So this was a cool bonus for her.

Peter is a young boy who lives in the woods with his grandfather. They're well-protected from the outside, having a massive fence built around their home. Peter has a duck that's basically his only friend, and one day they head to town for some chores. Advertisements for the circus are everywhere, with a ballerina bear shown on the posters. Poor Peter bumps into some local ruffians while there, and they throw him in a dumpster and even act like they're going to shoot him with a rifle after he's been dumped. Back home, a crippled bird lands by Peter and the duck. It wants them to go outside. They eventually do, and that's when it starts. Their home is protected for a reason- there's a wolf prowling around outside, and it has its eyes on these easy targets, which also includes a very fat cat that came out to get the crippled bird. Weaponless, what's Peter to do?

Because the movie is so short, and it's based on a well-known (aside from in my case I guess) tale, it's hard to not spoil the story. We'll just say that overall, the movie isn't too dark and yet it definitely doesn't sugarcoat anything, featuring a small amount of blood and one death. My daughter is six years old and she wasn't disturbed by any of the imagery or violent scenes. It was a downer for both of us when a certain death happened, but it isn't lingered on. I was really impressed with the puppets used in this movie, and most of the animation is fantastic. There are only a couple of times when something wasn't animated very well (the cat drying its legs after it fell through the frozen pond stood out). It's nothing major, and it easily forgiven, especially considering this isn't a huge feature length film. Details like Peter's facial expressions say more than words ever could.

Speaking of words, no one talks in this movie. This may bother some, so it's worth mentioning for those who don't like this for whatever the reason.

After the movie was over and I went to rate it, my daughter saw that I was going to give it 4 stars, but insisted that it should get 5. I was surprised! She was into it, and even quit playing Animal Crossing: New Leaf about 5 minutes in. It's always a pleasure to see new stop motion films, and this was certainly a treat.",1374451200,2,3070,4.371278458844133

3236549,5,B000XCVZXG,"Made with puppets filmed in stop-motion (with real-life backgrounds), this half-hour animated short is an absolute delight. It begins in a very bleak way: Peter lives in a very poor shack, and is forbidden to go out the fences that surround it, presumably because of the lurking wolf. We see his poor daily life depicted in almost complete silence. Only when he finds a way out of the fences does the familiar music, along with the familiar story, kick in. And all of a sudden, everything becomes joyous and playful. The duck, who looked miserably starved, finds a new life on the outside. The cat, which served as a vaguely menacing figure in the first part, becomes first-rate comedy material. Even the disabled crow starts oozing a glowing charm.

The wolf was bound to appear sooner or later though, at which point the movie enters a more nuanced mood. I'm not going to spoil what happens next, in case you don't already know Prokofiev's tale, although even those who are familiar with it may be in for a couple of surprises.

The animation itself is brilliant and I found it genuinely mesmerizing despite the fact that the stop-motion puppets usually are not my favourite animation technique. The puppets themselves are the stars of the show, being incredibly detailed and infused with personality. In fact, only Peter himself appears disappointingly generic. Is it because the director wanted every kid to be able to easily identify with him? If that is the reason, it was not worth the trade-off.

As far as I can tell, the music is completely faithful to Prokofiev's partition, and the animation does play with the music a lot. It sometimes makes the film appear a little too "" literal"", but this is a very minor complain and overall the interaction between music and action is very competent. For the sake of mentioning everything that was less than perfect, I have to add that I found the pacing of the last scene a bit too slow. Again, though, this is easily forgiven in light of everything that is done right!

I recommend this movie to everyone, no matter their preferences in animation techniques. Some might be rebutted by the beginning's grim mood, but stick with it and you'll be rewarded with very delightful scenes. It's also very suitable for children, who will find this version less frightening than Disney's.",1365033600,,2331,4.805486284289277

3236567,5,B000XCVZXG,"The claymation was, strictly speaking, just incredible.  The story was fresh and alive, and also very close to the original given that this one takes place in the modern day.  The mood is set during the first five minutes of the piece, and Prokofiev's music doesn't begin until Petr opens the gate to what seems to be held as ""the wild"", which is wonderful in that it is so much nicer than the world Petr knows.  The music begins at this point and shows the wonder that Petr feels when he steps into the frontier that he's been forbidden to experience.  All in all, a great work.  If only all remakes/retellings could be this good.

Umm, spoiler alert:
Petr has a hard lesson to learn during this story.  It's a lesson that I've been slowly introducing to my young ones as they get bigger.  There are a lot of scary things out there in the world, but a hungry wolf in winter is still not as scary as an ignorant human with a gun.  The wolf is doing what it needs to stay alive, whereas humans that do terrible things rarely have anywhere near as good a reason, and unfortunately there are far more of the latter.  I was surprised but happy that this Petr showed compassion and understanding.  I didn't see forgiveness or contrition in either of their eyes, but I did seem to see some shared understanding, though that could just be because of how late it is...

3236578,5,B000XCVZXG,"This Peter follows closely to Prokofiev's music  - but, if you expect some narrator to carry you along, you'll find yourself all alone. The story emerges by itself, wordlessly, and does so in the most beautiful way. The Cat comes through with all the feline smugness you could hope for. The Hunter - well there's a whole new tension that I think Prokofiev never had in mind. If you grew up on the vapidized versions I did, this comes across with a harsh edge, resolved eventually in Peter's favor.

But, for me, this is all about the animation. As much as I love CGI, it has yet to capture the extra level of human involvement and craft that inheres in puppet animation. This isn't the ""happy ever after"" story the disneyfied version wants you to expect. Instead, it has kids dealing with harsh realities - the way they do in the real world, like it or not.

Good music, good animation, and it doesn't talk down to the viewer. Doesn't talk at all, really, but that's part of the appeal.

3236585,5,B000XCVZXG,"My testimonial: I have no connection WHATSOEVER in ANYWAY to this product other than as a consumer.

Some complaints, like the low rating ones here and others I've read elsewhere, hinged on the notion that because this version of ""Peter and the Wolf"" does not follow the original story line, it is therefore less worthy, and to this I say...

For whatever reason the original was made, this stop motion animation is superb, a masterpiece in its own right.  Do we care what the original purpose or reason for the atom bomb was?--No, as we now use nuclear power in many different ways than the original purpose.  Does it matter that we do not build our modern home like the original mud and stone design?--No, we created new versions of mud buildings.  The original version of this story exists and for those who cannot appreciate different expressions of the original, then please stick with the original--but don't knock this one down.  This modern version of Prokofiev's ""Peter and the Wolf"" is a beautiful piece, pain stakingly done--no one, despite their preference for whichever version of the story would deny this fact, so give credit where credit is due.

The accurate review for this version of ""Peter and the Wolf"" would be: This piece contains the most beautiful stop motion animation work I have ever seen; the story line is not the same as the original but the stop motion craftsmanship is extraordinarily fine and I love it for that; the focus of this version is more on the animated art form with Prokovief's music in the background.  As you watch the animation you get mesmerized by the claymation artists' skills: the expressions are fluidly delivered full with emotional meanings in all the characters.  Making a piece of clay tell you he is hurt, sad, angry, happy, etc., without using words takes exceptional skills--I was in awe, because I couldn't believe the life that came from those clay figures--and all done without words.  This skill-set and the beautiful music created a universal film able to reach into everyone's mind and heart without the barrier of language.  This is the beauty in this piece of work that the die-hard-original-version lovers missed or ignored.  As an adult I love this short film (I wish it was longer)--the kids I saw it with ages 5 and 13 were fine with the content.  They were not scared as in scary; they felt its realism--no different than a realistic Nature film. (I can't speak in this regard for all kids so you have to figure that out for yourself.)  This version is a lovingly well made film and the quality reflects the extra ordinary skills of all the artists involved in making this artistic expression of a story. When purchasing this dvd look for the ones with the extras it really gives an insight into this art form.",1303776000,11,2784,4.74896265560166

I've always been so frustrated by the versions of this which have a narrator. Who needs a narrator when you already have a visual for students to watch? The narrators always take away from students' ability to listen to the music. In this version, no narrator exists leaving the story to the music and the beautiful stop motion animation.

Peter is more closely related to my more interesting students - gentle, unsure of himself, frustrated with being a powerless boy and ready to make some big decisions.

The movie has its comical moments, and the animation is charming, but the brilliant way the story creates a multi-faceted tale means the music moves to an entirely different level for young viewers. They won't just understand the story, they will understand the feelings the music conveys. This brings the music not only to very young students, but to music students of any age.

I thought it was scary for children and didn't offer any introduction to instruments the original animated movie did which I have been unable to find.  I actually would like to return it.,1264896000,7,257,4.565217391304348
3236603,4,B000XCVZXG,"Peter and the Wolf is a wonderfully dark retelling of the classic Sergei Prokofiev children's story/musical composition. Technically brilliant, fluidly animated, and lavishly detailed, it is among the finest examples of stop-motion animation. It's great for adults, but parents may want to screen it first before showing their kids, as there are some potentially scary imagery and realistic violence.

For example, right at the beginning, Peter goes to town and gets scared by a stuffed wolf in a shop window. He accidentally bumps into a hunter, who bullies him, and throws him in a dumpster. He then points his rifle at Peter. Later in the story, one of Peter's animal friends gets eaten. Lastly, Peter has the unblinking eyes, icy stare, and dour expressionless face of a plastic doll that younger kids may also find disturbing (see DVD cover). The harsh realities of rural Russian life are depicted here. It's certainly different than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disney/dp/6302961696/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disney</a>&nbsp;version that you may remember.

There is no dialogue or narration. Everything is told through images, music, and silence, and I thought perhaps the musical backbone of the original story took a back seat to the animation. In various versions I've seen, each character is represented by a strong and distinct musical instrument. Here, the soundtrack did not seem to give each character a unique voice. The music just seems to be part of the background rather than who the characters are.

Overall, still very good and definitely worth watching.",1263513600,2,1625,5.597560975609756
3236604,4,B000XCVZXG,"Downside: as observed in some one star reviews, this version scrimps on Prokofiev's music, which is odd, because the music is so ingenious, characterful, humorous, and charming. The rest is all upside: each of those adjectives also applies to the visual and story-book aspects of this Suzie Templeton version of Peter and the Wolf - and even if the fates of the duck and the wolf come out a little differently I couldn't bring myself to become Upset about it - but just enjoyed the ""alternate ending"". This movie made me laugh, but adults need to step back and try to view a little movie such as this from a child's perspective. Suzie Templeton has created an entertainment and a narrative that is deep and involving for a child. It stimulates their creativity, and involves them emotionally. It sensitively deals with a reality that is hopefully more brutal than what most of our children are experiencing, and shows a child overcoming adversity. Its only a million times better to have your child watch this than ""Power Rangers"" and occasionally children do need to take a few minutes break from videogames. If you think Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle, Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind and Henson's Mirrormask are great (although made with very different techniques), then you will probably also like Peter and the Wolf. Children's movies that are good for their little sould are too few and far between. On the musical side, I suggest you find the Alec Guinness - narrated CD with the Boston Pops, but there are many fine versions.",1253664000,8,1548,4.845283018867924
3236605,5,B000XCVZXG,"This film is so very worthy of the Oscar it won for ""Best Animated Short"" in 2008.  The stop animation process has been perfected in this movie.  The scenery and characters are simply breathtaking.  The story is a wonderfully dark tale, told with no dialogue.  All feelings, words, and thoughts are expressed through the music and the intense look in Peter's eyes.  I have three children who love this movie, so it isn't too dark for young kids.  The duck, unfortunately, gets dispatched by the wolf.  I used this as a great opportunity to teach my kids that unfortunately, sometimes even the cute and cuddly animals don't make it.  Excellent storytelling and a beautifully animated film await.",1253491200,3,694,4.871794871794871
3236606,5,B000XCVZXG,"I first saw portions of ""Peter and the Wolf"" on PBS, and immediately wanted to purchase a copy. I was dismayed to find out that it was not available in REGION 1 format. I am glad it is now.  Suzie Templeton's short film is a example of the sustaining power and depth of Prokofiev's program music. The synthesis between the score and visual is seamless although the score was written decades ago. In this format, the descriptive nature of the music itself is clearly exemplified and personified. Film music is often written in response to the visual, while here the process is reversed. Templeton's greatest achievement is allowing the viewer to experience the complexity of this piece that Prokofiev ultimately wrote for children.

Furthermore, the extras included fill out the DVD package. A highlight is the documentary about the use of the ""Peter and the Wolf"" film as an educational tool to teach elementary school children about music, art, and the relationship between the two.

The film is not only entertaining it is educational.

Highly recommended to those interested in music education, animation buffs, and Russian music fans.",1247011200,,1138,5.037234042553192

3236608,5,B000XCVZXG,This video is fantastic! I used it in my Peter and the Wolf Unit with 6th graders and they loved it.  They laughed at how fat the cat was and the antics of all the animals.  Great way to encourage listening to classical music and introduce the concept of music telling a story.,1242345600,4,277,4.2075471698113205
3236609,1,B000XCVZXG,"This is such a deviation from Prokofiev's original that I cannot recommend it at all.  The original intent of this work is to get kids to apprecitate orchestral music.  This version does not introduce Prokofiev's music until 10 minutes into the feature and during this time Peter accidentally bumps into one of the hunters while walking the street and the hunter proceeds to toss Peter into a trash dumpster and point a gun at his head.  For the love of .... ; is anything sacred... as a music teacher, apart from the animation ...this is just rubbish and I can only imagine Prokofiev rolling over in his grave!",1241395200,23,611,4.638888888888889

3236613,5,B000XCVZXG,"When I was a kid I listened to Prokofiev's Peter & the Wolf a couple of times.  Okay, the various instruments representing Peter and the assorted animals were supposed to accomplish storytelling through music.  This might have captivated kids way back when, but it didn't really work its spell on me.  Not until I saw this stop-frame animation version from Breakthru Films.  This is absolutely charming storytelling that appeals to all ages.  Only the willfully jaded and most tenacious cynics will be able to resist the appeal of this delightful animated rendition of Peter and the Wolf.  It is also an improvement on the original tale; it is largely free of boring cliches of good vs evil, and it has a more uplifting ending. - I would rank this right up there with Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro as a true charmer.",1235865600,,816,4.75177304964539

3236615,5,B000XCVZXG,"I bought this spur of the moment because of the cover art. It just looked cool. I admit I almost didn't buy it because it's a pretty short story, and I paid full price. But it was so worth it. I'd pay three times that for it now that I've seen it.

I understand that this may not be the exact Peter and the Wolf story that some of the reviewers were expecting. It is, however, a very good story just as it is. It is a story of understanding, consequence, and acceptance.

And visually...wow. I'm not usually that impressed with visuals. It's just not what I focus on. But this is beautiful.

I'm so glad I own this.",1235174400,4,615,4.151260504201681
3236616,5,B000XCVZXG,"This DVD features the 2007 Academy Award Winner for Best Short (Animated).  It was featured on PBS last year, but even if you recorded that presentation, there is much that this DVD has to offer.

First, the main feature is presented with an option to begin with the introduction that shows what instrument and theme are assigned to each character.  The feature itself is an extraordinary accomplishment, presenting a darker view of the tale than we are used to.  No Disney clownishness here.  Instead we have a gaunt, forlorn Peter, up against a pretty frightening wolf.

The extras include not only the making of documentary that was included with the PBS special, but also another subtitled Polish documentary.  Most fascinating is a rough print version, with some scenes fully completed, and others in various stages of completion.  This version shows a lot of the work that went into this labor-intensive project.

As for the reviewer who objected to the story variances, may I suggest that in future you headline such reviews with a ""spoiler alert.""  In any event, I do not find these changes to the classic tale objectionable, and they are certainly not contradicted by the music.

For the reviewer who was hoping for a music lesson, what can I say?  This film is so much more.

If you dislike stop animation projects, or have problems with Prokofiev's simple musical sketch, then move on.  Otherwise, this ia a fantastic buy.",1235001600,4,1433,4.8921161825726145
