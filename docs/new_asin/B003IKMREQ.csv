4127242,5,B003IKMREQ,"This is such a sad commentary the United States justice system.  No one wants a guilty person to go free-especially for such a terrible crime.  But how this man was in prison for such a long time-and watched his family disappear, knowing he was innocent was a hard story to dramatize.  Excellent job.  Julia Ormond gave a great performance.  While this isn't a movie to ""love"" it is well done and very thought provoking.",1339891200,,420,4.621621621621622
4127243,5,B003IKMREQ,"How impressive some people are - they stand up for justice and humanity - without thinking about their own comfort. I am full of admiration for Janet ""Prissy"" Gregory, who fought so hard and in the end succeeded to get Calvin Willis out of jail.

This film is based on the true story of Calvin Willis wrongfully accused of raping a neighborhood girl. When Janet Gregory starts digging into his story, she gets convinced of his innocence. Willis served 22 years in prison due to miscarriage of justice and the film shows the struggle to free him and clear him from the indictment.

They are both heroes as well as Willis' grandmother that stood by his side all these long difficult years. Unjust can be righted, even though he will never get back the years he lost. Never give up, keep your hopes and fight the unjust in the legal system.",1317945600,3,837,4.5364238410596025

4127245,4,B003IKMREQ,"The Wronged Man features Julia Ormond in a fine performance as a paralegal who works for over fifteen years to help accused child rapist Calvin Willis prove his innocence of this crime.  ""Based on a true story"" is what we are told at the beginning of the film.  Willis spends twenty-two years in a Lousiana jail for a crime DNA evidence eventually proves he did not commit.  That much is certainly true.  It is also true that Janet Gregory, the paralegal played by Ormond, works tirelessly to exonerate Willis. Year after year her appeals are denied, yet she never gives up. Her patience and hard work are rewarded. At the end of the film we see Willis and Gregory walk out of prison together as family and friends gather around them.

From beginning to end this is Julia Ormond's film and she does not disappoint.  She plays Janet Gregory as a person who has few resources other than her own intelligence, hard work, and determination.  Ormond is a skilled actor who shows us a woman who is almost broken by frustration and disappointment with a court system which opposes her at every turn.  Even when DNA testing becomes available to establish Willis's innocence, years pass before the tests are taken and the results set Willis free.  Watching this film is often difficult because we become angry and frustrated ourselves at a system that does not seem to care about guilt or innocence, only convictions.  Recommended.",1296604800,16,1422,4.7673469387755105
4127246,5,B003IKMREQ,"First, this is not a depressing movie but one of hope and determination by a paralegal, Prissy (Julia Ormond).  The setting of the movie is in the state of Louisiana and Prissy fights with the Louisiana legal system, at a great personal cost to her, for over twenty to free a wrongly imprisoned black man.  I enjoyed this movie and would recommend to anyone and in my opinion this is a five star for me.  Julia Ormond is a great actress and she never disappoints.  I become a big fan of her work.",1291248000,8,496,4.301075268817204
4127247,5,B003IKMREQ,"Being falsely accused of anything you are not guilty of is a difficult situation. To be punished and lose most of your life because of the accusation is tragic. This movie does a great job of showing the difficulties faced when attempting to rectify such a scenario. It is not an action-packed flick, but one that shows how slowly the wheels of justice can turn in this great country.",1285977600,8,384,4.579710144927536
