8249635,3,B0013AXEZ4,"I give this BD 5 stars for the subject matter. A single view of a spot with continous breakers, giving pretty much white noise. It is like having a window overlooking Big Sur. It is excellent for working on the computer or reading or just sitting.
However, it is quite expensive and is only 33 minutes which repeats endlessly. They say ""Some of the profits go to a non-profit environmental org"", which could be a penny or anything at all. As much as I like it, it is a lousy value.",1306886400,,481,4.2967032967032965
8249636,5,B0013AXEZ4,"We all have a choice. Learn to be still and calm or continually seek more stimulation to mask the fact that we are all over stressed and need to wind down. This genre of video has it's place if you are seeking to feel more at peace. If you are seeking to wind yourself up continuously, watch The Matrix. If you are too restless to sit still and try something like meditation, a video like this one is a good place to start.",1229126400,,423,4.108433734939759
8249637,1,B0013AXEZ4,"This DVD is not Blu-ray quality. The video is not the worst part of this DVD,the sound is horrible ! No wonder the insert suggests turning the volume down to look at the picture for relaxation. I purchased this with the intent of listening as well as viewing the video. I was very dissappointed. The whole movie seems like someone sat a camcorder on the rocks and let it go, the sound has pops clicks and all types of cracks.
Nobody could possibly relax while listening to this. There is no way the video resolution approaches high def !",1214438400,6,537,4.434343434343434
8249638,5,B0013AXEZ4,"Like the description says, ""A SINGLE awe-inspiring SCENE of nature is produced without interruptions, special effects, or distracting menus"" is right on.  If you are expecting 200 sub-par ocean scenes spliced together with cheesy editing then you should get an ocean sampler disc instead of this title.  For a truly holistic relaxation experience, this video is one of my top picks.",1211500800,2,382,5.245901639344262
8249639,1,B0013AXEZ4,"I expected several views of the ocean and beautiful coastline instead I got one continuous view of waves crashing on a beach that could be anywhere. In my opinion if there had been a detailed description of the contents I would not have purchased a video I cannot return and will not
be viewing again.",1211155200,5,301,4.490909090909091
