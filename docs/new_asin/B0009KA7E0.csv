2297131,5,B0009KA7E0,"I was very pleased to see that Butterflies is getting a release on DVD over here.  When it was out on VHS I hadn't been aware of it's availability & I found out after it'd been discontinued.  I heard conflicting reports of the tape containing 1/3 episodes.  BFS owned the distribution rights then.  I'm delighted that after they fumbled the ball that Acorn had attained the licensing rights to release the show.  I have pre-ordered & am hoping it sells well so subsequent seasons are available.  I'm confident it will!

Wendy Craig, Geoffrey Palmer (As Time Goes By) & Nicholas Lyndhurst (Only Fools & Horses) are the stars of this sitcom.

If you're a fan of shows like As Time Goes By & Good Neighbors (Aka The Good Life (UK)), you'll love Butterflies, it's a sophisticated & refreshing comedy that you'll want in your collection.",1119398400,15,832,4.689655172413793
2297132,5,B0009KA7E0,"Growing up, this is one of the first Brit-Coms that really stuck out to me and greatly impressed me.  This show, along with other greats such as Ever Decreasing Circles and The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin were shows that, even though I was quite young, gave me hope for great TV.  Butterflies is a series that has interesting characters, is rarely boring, and keeps you wanting to watch from episode to episode.  If you have fond memories of this show from airings on PBS, this is a great chance to get reaquainted with a show that has only become better over the years.  If you hae never seen this show, you need to check this show out.

And if this DVD is anything like the Region 2 release, the bonus features may not be stellar, but the quality of this series is alone reason enough to give the DVD five stars.",1117324800,43,819,4.326797385620915
2297153,5,B0009KA7E0,I was fortunate enough to catch this series on PBS back in the 1990's and fell in love with it.  All the actors are likable and funny! Great series and I'm very happy to find it out here so I can finally own it.,1441324800,,211,3.7954545454545454
2297154,5,B0009KA7E0,Great show,1440288000,,10,4.5
2297155,4,B0009KA7E0,Viewed on Netflix before buying as a Christmas gift. Great for Anglophiles!,1438646400,,75,5.333333333333333
2297156,1,B0009KA7E0,My husband and I did not watch due to poor acting on Wendy Craig's part as we thought she was silly instead of funny!!!  We are crazy about Geoffrey Palmer and have watched the complete series AS TIME GOES BY with Geoffrey and Judi Dench which was excellent!!!,1438300800,,260,4.416666666666667
2297157,5,B0009KA7E0,I liked it when it was on TV and now I can see it again and again!,1428537600,,66,2.9411764705882355
2297158,1,B0009KA7E0,This British comedy is boring I wish I could send it back.  I even order series 2 that I have not opened.  DO NOT ORDER NOT WORTH THE MONEY.  THIS IS NOTHING BUT GARBAGE THERE ARE NOT FUNNY AT ALL.  I want my refund back on both of these comedy.,1424822400,,245,3.84
2297159,5,B0009KA7E0,Geoffrey Palmer is a great favorite in my family. We have followed him as best we could in all the things he does. Recently we saw him in Paddington Bear even. Butterflies is a good situational comedy and he does his usual super job. He is one of the few actors who can make my husband laugh out loud. That is a good thing. In Butterflies he plays a dentist who is going through some type of mid-life crisis as is his wife. It does not make matters any more pleasant that their two adult sons live at home. It is a realistic true series and anything that Mr. Geoffrey Palmer is in should be viewed and enjoyed and most likely re-watched again and again.,1424390400,2,653,4.232
2297160,3,B0009KA7E0,At first I thought it was boring but it has grown on me. The character Leonard border lines on stalking. Geoffrey Palmers character is similar to his Lionel character on As Time Goes By.,1423267200,,186,4.5

2297163,4,B0009KA7E0,It was funny that when I watched this when it first came out I thought it was clever enough.  Now it is so blatant what a bully her husband was.  Sign of the times I think.,1404000000,,172,3.75
2297164,5,B0009KA7E0,"I'll fondly remember this show as it was shown on PBS in the US. I haven't seen it in a long time, and I'm glad to find it on DVD. I'd like to see the rest of the series on DVD, please, because I know there are more episodes.",1401321600,,225,3.6122448979591835
2297165,5,B0009KA7E0,"My family and I love British sitcoms, but ""Butterflies"" was by far our favorite.  I have waited for years to acquire the complete
series.  Why has it never become available in the United States?",1391126400,,194,4.676470588235294
2297166,5,B0009KA7E0,"I love British sitcoms, and I was so happy to find this show on DVD. I actually bought it used, and I was a little scared that there would be issues with the DVD. The DVD is perfect. The same with the cover, it looks brand new.",1386892800,2,227,3.851063829787234
2297167,2,B0009KA7E0,"This DVD is not up to the standards set up by the stars. All the cast members are all whiney, and think they should be put ahead of everybody else. Save your money.",1381881600,,164,4.0
2297168,5,B0009KA7E0,"This series is really great. I have ordered series 1 and 2 but according to Wikipedia, there is a 3 and 4. Does anyone know why it does not come up on Amazon search???? I would like to buy them to watch.",1375228800,2,203,3.857142857142857
2297169,5,B0009KA7E0,"This is an over the top period piece from the sixties or early seventies I would guess.
If you've ever been in a relationship where you are undervalued but afraid to burn your bridges you'll enjoy this immensely.
Wendy Craig is intelligent, vivacious and caring. Geoffrey Palmer, (who seems to be in most BritComs) the husband, truly loves Ria, but has the worse sense of timing and is always doing the wrong thing. He wants to change but is stuck in his old school chauvanism. Her two sons pour gasoline on the relationship but mean well. Between some very poignant moments, you'll find yourself laughing. Set at the dawn of the women's lib movement, Wendy is torn between being unfaithful with an unwanted suitor and constantly giving her situation another chance. I suspect it could become therapy if viewed with your significant other. Overall, excellent, well done and one of my favorite guilty pleasures.",1362096000,3,910,4.915584415584416
2297170,3,B0009KA7E0,I didn't care much for this DVD.  I liked Geoffrey in As Time Goes By with Dame Judy Dench so thought I would try this series as he is a main character in it.  It was done several yrs ago & it shows it as far as the way women were perceived at that time.,1330560000,,254,3.6
2297171,2,B0009KA7E0,I was disappointed in this early series with Geoffrey Palmer.  He is so wonderful in the series As Time Goes By but his demeanor in this series falls flat.  The episodes are rather pointless and silly.,1267920000,2,201,4.555555555555555
2297172,5,B0009KA7E0,"I first watched this series on PBS in the early 80's. Re-watching the first three episode today, I realized that there are layers in this series that I couldn't appreciate as a 20-year old. It's poignant and funny and I fell in love with it all over again.

The characters are believable and understated. It does appear dated, especially the clothing, but, the themes of aging and marriage and lost opportunities are timeless and I like the vintage look of the series, it adds to the slow, gentle, lyrical feel of the writing and understated acting.

Unfortunately series 3 and 4 are not available in NTSC Region 1, an oversight I hope BBC soon remedies.",1251417600,8,654,4.678260869565217
2297182,3,B0009KA7E0,"I remember fighting to stay up to watch British Comedies when I was younger so now as an Adult I have begun purchasing them.
Overall, I enjoyed this though as an Adult I see why my parents had objected, that old ""told you so"", took some of the fun out of it for me.  She is a married lady being persued.  However, the rest of the adults in the house were ""lol"", laughing out loud.",1231718400,,380,4.053333333333334
2297183,5,B0009KA7E0,"I had seen this series many years ago, early '80's.  I loved it then.  At that time I really identified with Ria.  Now I'm passed that time in my life, with teenagers in the house and all the frustrations of that time, but I still love this series.  I will be purchasing the second series.  I highly recommend it.  It's wonderful!",1201046400,18,330,4.327868852459017
2297184,5,B0009KA7E0,This DVD is very professionally made and is certain to bring back memories of the original tv show.  The trials and tribulations of Rea and Ben are fantastic entertainment.  It has been a wonderful experience for us to revisit old friends and to relive their experiences.,1168300800,17,271,4.869565217391305
2297185,2,B0009KA7E0,"I like Geoffrey Palmer in ""As time goes by"", but just couldn't get into this particular show....",1153094400,2,96,4.705882352941177
2297186,5,B0009KA7E0,"If you like British Comedy this is for you.  You won't be disappointed. Also, Butterflies, Series 2 is great.",1138406400,14,109,4.7368421052631575
2297187,5,B0009KA7E0,"This is typical British humour, very quick-witted, CLEAN, and well written.  There are a few innuendos, but I would say it is one of the funniest comedy shows that were produced years ago.

Geoffrey Palmer has appeared in many comedy series. You are selling ""As Times goes By"", another of his great shows.",1126224000,20,305,4.735849056603773
2297188,5,B0009KA7E0,"If sex, violence, and abomnible language, is your thing - this delightful comedy is not for you.

If, however, you like splendid acting; here provided by both Palmer and Craig, and a gently humorous view of married life, you will rave over this unusual (if not far from the truth) comedy series.

The series revolves around the happenings of a Mum, Dad and two son marriage. Marital harmony is always coming and going, while the sons do not make matters any easier.

The show is made even brighter, by the infrequent laconic laments of the couple's housekeeper.

This is, without doubt, a quality show - by all but the 'modern' thinkers.",1123891200,33,637,4.711711711711712
2297189,5,B0009KA7E0,"Butterflies is the first British situation comedy to be a hit in the US.  Most Britcoms were broad sketch comedies and not situation comedies.  This show worked because the base story was something that the average American could relate to.

Twenty five years later, it still works.  Actually, things have gone full circle and it is current again because of the revival of the stay at home moms.

Ria Parkinson was happily married but not ecstatically married woman in her late 30's.  Her husband, Ben, is a dentist who just turned 48 and is trying to figure out his life.  She has two grown sons that are still at home adding additional stress to her life.

While trying to work out her current problems, she meets Leonard.  Leonard is a suave businessman who is divorced, his wife ran off with his best friend.  He is 44 and is also going through his own life crisis.  He is tired of his shallow existence of one young girl after another and would like a woman of substance, like Ria.

This is the basis of all 28 episodes.  Series One is the first 6 episodes.  The following is a summary of the episodes:

Episode 1 - We meet Ria and her family.  Ria and Ben have been married for 19 years and he still cannot fathom her cooking.  The current meal is potatoes, a chop, some green things and gravy.  Ben and oldest son have not been speaking for a year.  Ria meets Leonard in a restaurant.  Ria realizes that she is still desirable and wants Ben to realize it.  Again she runs into Leonard, or he almost runs over her with his car and he asks her out to lunch.

Episode 2 - After a number of nasty comments about her cooking, Ria previews tonight's apple sponge (which looks like a beige bowling ball) and gives the men an ultimatum ""if any one of you dares to utter one word, I will splatter the walls with it and leave this house forever"".  Ria then runs into Leonard who pursues her but she learns even Leonard has his rejection limit.  At dinner, the men unite.

Episode 3 - Leonard loses his license.  Ria decides that now that the boys are grown, she wants more from life - a job.  This is the first episode that shows the neighbors.  Also, there is a great flub.  Adam and Russell are busking.  When the get into the car a woman walks up to give them coin.  Based on Andrew Hall's reaction, this was probably a passerby who did not notice the filming going on.

Episode 4 - We are introduced to Leonard's driver.  It is Leonard's birthday.  He wants to have lunch with Ria but has a hard time inviting her.

Episode 5 - A statue is being sent to America and Russell tries to stop it by chaining himself to it.

Episode 6 - Ria is getting more confused by life and talks to God at the local church.  Ria decides that she will get rid of everything that is not right in her life, including Leonard.

Wendy Craig is perfect as the harried Ria.  She has a natural comic sense of timing.  She knows when to just say the lines and when to put that little extra onto the line or action.  Her Ria is the mother most people wanted.  And the wife everyone wants.  I know I fell in love with her when I first saw the show.

This was America's first real glimpse Geoffrey Palmer (Ben) who is most famous for As Time Goes By.  Palmer is the perfect straight man.  He is the perfect sounding board for Craig.  He knows just when to react or to deadpan.

Bruce Montague plays Leonard as the exact opposite of Ben and Rhea.  He is having problems but while Ben and Rhea repress their problems, Leonard is in your face with his.

Andrew Hall has captured the essence of Russell, a young man wanting to experience life before he is tied down.

This is the first major role for Nicholas Lyndhurst who has become a major UK star floating between TV and theatre.

DVD EXTRAS:

Interview with creator Clara Lane -  This was the first time that I ever saw her and this interview was quite interesting.  She talks about how she came up with the show, casting of the show and dealing with the celebrity that the show brought her.

Cast Filmographies - Bio's on Wendy Craig (Ria); Geoffrey Palmer (Ben); Bruce Montague (Leonard); Andrew Hall (Russell) and Nicholas Lyndhurst (Adam)

I grew up watching Butterflies as a child with my family, one of the things that struck me even then is that we all got something different out of it, but also all got a good laugh out of it.  For me as I child, I enjoyed the sons Adam and Russell and their mini.  For my mother, she identified with Rita and her plight (including the cooking).  As far as my father goes, even though he was not a dentist but a shipbuilder, he seemed to identify with the dentist and the family as a unit.  So if you enjoy British humour and sitcoms from the late 70's and early 80's this might just be for you in one way or another.",1483488000,,698,4.028985507246377
