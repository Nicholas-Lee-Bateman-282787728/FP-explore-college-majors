1371655,1,B00004Y62Y,2000 (NOT 2016) bad flick that is a partial remake of Airport 1977 and uses much footage and plot from Airport 1977. Recycled downgraded version.,1482537600,,145,4.84
1371656,4,B00004Y62Y,I am very happy with my copy Submerged it arrived in good condition,1470268800,,67,4.230769230769231
1371657,5,B00004Y62Y,What a great movie. Kept interest wondering what would happen next. Family loved it. Super cool movie that we will watch again,1395360000,,126,4.7727272727272725
1371658,2,B00004Y62Y,"where to start? The characters were shallow with bad dialogue. The girls were all snippy know-it-alls with chips on their shoulders, The problems were solved waaay too easily....virtually no complications.  The movie was predictable. Blow things up... that will wow the audience...Yawn!. In theory the story idea was OK, even with potential...were this a 007 movie idea it might have been spectacular. Even though theoretically plausible, it was just poorly scripted and played out. No build up of the threat, it was just 'understood', and when played out, almost harmless. They had too many problems to solve so they were all solved easily to save time.  The actors were worse than B movie...almost Porno movie quality with no logistical reasons for attitudes, demeanors... just predetermined outcomes with illogical or simple ways to get there.  ...yes even Dennis Weaver was fairly lame.  No suspense...well maybe 2 minutes where there was some actual suspense. Empty characterization, forced attitudes for no discernable reason other than this is what movies people act like... right? Who do you blame...the actors or the director? Who cares,...I didn't bother to rewind and someone is getting this movie free. I don't ever want to see it again.",1366848000,2,1249,5.261306532663316
1371659,3,B00004Y62Y,"This is not a bad movie - it just lacks from a large enough budget to add some frills.  One reviewer mentioned the Seagal's voice being so different but if he had really been watching he would have seen that Seagal's lines were dubbed in for some reason.  Not all of them, but some.  But it is a typical Seagal movie and worth watching.",1139875200,,336,4.21875
1371660,1,B00004Y62Y,"There are good movies, these are movies worth seeing. Then there are bad movies, movies not worth seeing. Then there is a paradox, movies so bad, they must be seen. That is the category that ""Submerged"" falls into. This is one of those movies where the more serious the writers tried to be, the funnier it ended up. (Not laugh `with' funny, laugh `at' funny!) This movie is filled with appalling lines like ""He's shot, but it's not deep!"", or ""I want a full night search ready by O-600!"" (think about that one). And the story is not even plausible to an elementary school student. If a plane falls from the sky at full speed into the ocean with no pilot, IT WILL CRASH AND BE DESTROYED! It won't just come to a gentle rest, then sink! This movie is so bad it is good. I have never laughed so hard at anything else in my life! And I won't give anything away, but just wait until you see the end, it involves a U-Haul, and handy bazooka supplied by convenient off-screen personnel, and apparently it takes place on Tuesday at 3 o'clock...",1061424000,10,1036,4.373056994818653
1371661,3,B00004Y62Y,"Your typical made for tv movie with unessassary language and nudity.  good job there coolio.  if this movie took place in Glenville, NY at the airport by Price Chopper (HEHEHE)then it would of made more sense!",981158400,2,209,4.777777777777778
1371662,5,B00004Y62Y,"This movie is far from being the best movie I saw, but, for an action movie, it's good. I mean, I actually don't like action movies like those with Stallone, all the military stuff... I don't find that interesting. But this one is a good one in that category, it is as good as Bruce Willis movies or that kind of stuff. The story is original and entertaining. Last but not least, the reason why I put five stars... it's the actress NICOLE EGGERT!!! She is so cute and sexy, now she looks like more to a lady than to a young girl. She's back after her disappearance of one or two years and she's cutest than ever. If you like action movies, this one is for you, and if you love NICOLE EGGERT, buy this movie without waiting!!!",974678400,6,725,4.223021582733813
1371673,2,B00004Y62Y,"I might have to compare this film to Rogue Strike also on Amazon Prime Video. Both of the films suffer from having a weak underdeveloped premise and average cast thereby dooming them to mediocrity. Rogue Strike's production was the main issue, but for Submerged it was the premise at least in my opinion. I know all of the loyal Amazon Prime Members are looking for great memorable films to watch and this is definitely not a memorable film at all. You make your own opinion when you watch this film if you so choose.",1494547200,,517,4.51063829787234
1371674,3,B00004Y62Y,"This is an entertaining action film. Most of the action occurs at the beginning and at the end. Coolio is okay as a cold blooded, villain and Williamson seems to overact every scene as a military commander. The plane crash and rescue were realistic. The FX are good and the script makes sense. I wanted to see more action. However, the characters were well written so they kept my interest. Recommended for fans of disaster films.",1492387200,,430,4.671052631578948
1371675,1,B00004Y62Y,"So, you can watch this irredeemably terrible movie, with special effects sequences made up of clips from Airport '77, or you could just watch the ""so bad it's great"" Airport '77.

Let me put it another way: this is a really, really bad copy of an already bad movie. Bad + bad != good; instead it == unwatchable.",1491177600,,311,4.362068965517241
1371676,1,B00004Y62Y,"This is one of those ""that's 95 minutes of my life I'll never get back"" kinds of films.  A decent plot, although it feels like a rip-off of Under Siege 2, but the film is weighed down by poor acting, sub-par writing, and abysmal special effects.",1489708800,,245,4.326086956521739

The story and filming are from an earlier era before CG special effects, so younger viewers might not be so excited.
