8312683,4,B000PI3UWM,A very solid and thorough presentation of the setup through the aftermath of the Falaise Gap.  Interviews with veterans and on-site filming of the actual locations are some of the highlights.  I did not give it 5 stars because a number of locations are referenced throughout the video without benefit of a map to see where they are.  I had a similar problem at times with the identity of some of the military units.  My only other issue was a number of film clips were reused several times as well as clips that clearly took place at different times and locations (most notably the Battle of the Bulge).  Still a recommended a documentary of a much neglected but very important topic.,1479686400,,684,4.619834710743802
