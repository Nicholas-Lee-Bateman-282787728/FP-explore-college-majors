8320787,3,B001MAEW1K,"In SHELTER, Chris Elston, who stars and directs, brings to the viewer a throwback to a TWILIGHT ZONE episode called ""The Shelter"" in which a family has built a bomb shelter and their neighbors mock them for it.  But when a nuclear attack is imminent, neighbors suddenly beg entrance and failing that threaten violence to gain entrance. Here Elston, plays a son long estranged from his father who has built a shelter that can hold no more than ten.  We never learn what the Armeggedon threat is, but it causes a flood of would be entrants, all of whom face some pretty unpleasant truths about the value of human life.  As a new visitor arrives, the others decide how to react.  Should they draw straws? Use violence? Consider life skills? Or judge only on reproductive futures? These are weighty questions, but where SHELTER goes astray is the preachiness of the script that follows a predictable pattern. In the face of assured death should one leave the Shelter, one by one each of the excess chooses to leave. Only in the realm of a script would a set of parents altruistically and willingly leave their minor child in the hands of strangers to be raised by them. SHELTER is a film of conversation, of which only a small part rings true. Most of it sounds as if a bunch of actors are given a screen test and try not to giggle at moments of high seriousness.",1245369600,,1359,4.53469387755102
