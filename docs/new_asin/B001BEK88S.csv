3490214,5,B001BEK88S,"This film is well worth owning if you're a military buff. I'm finding Blu-ray DVD's that were made with Imax film are excellent quality. If you want to show off to a friend how well Blu-ray works, this is a film well worth owning. It'll catch a persons attention and they'll want to watch the whole thing. I highly recomend Fighter Pilot both for it's content and quality.",1233273600,2,372,4.485294117647059
3490215,4,B001BEK88S,"I enjoyed this movie very much, It is nice to know what it is like to do what I will hopefully be doing some day!  If you want to know what its like to fly, this will help with that desire, but some of the images have cgi plane parts so it looks like they were filmed in the cockpit or from a camera hooked on the outside of the plane, but they weren't, and with blu-ray its not hard to tell.  For anyone that pays attention that much it might bother them, but if you just like to watch and enjoy documentaries like this one then you most likely won't notice.
I still like this show, and if you want to know why the U.S. Air Force is so good at what they do, then this will for sure help you find out!",1232236800,,701,3.861111111111111
3490216,4,B001BEK88S,"It was fun to see Nellis again.  This would have five stars if they could have used some actual combat footage and not use the computer generated footage. It is high quality CGI, but still CGI...",1232064000,,195,4.416666666666667
3490217,4,B001BEK88S,I bought this movie to see how realistic it compared to the real flying. I would say they done a pretty good job. I would recommend this movie if you like action and flying.,1231804800,,173,4.117647058823529
3490218,4,B001BEK88S,"Even tho some scenes looked like they were made in CGI, i very much enjoyed that DVD !  quite amazing pictures in there!",1231804800,,120,4.217391304347826
3490219,4,B001BEK88S,I saw the movie on television and was intrigued enough to order a DVD.  It is a great documentary action film that puts you in the pilot seat.  Great video and sounds great.,1231459200,,173,4.212121212121212
3490220,5,B001BEK88S,"This is 35 minutes of hardcore military aviation porn, with the most amazing cast of airplanes (f15, f18, tornado, harrier, a10, b1, b2, e3, kc135, etc.) ever captured in a live action movie, with live munitions, all filmed in glorious high definition. From the moment they scrambled all the planes inside of ten heart-pounding minutes to the moment that the last plane was refueled for its return to base, I was agog. It is Jane's All The World's Greatest Modern Fighting Aircraft come to life. If you like military aircraft, you will LOVE this movie. Otherwise it doesn't have anything to offer you.",1231027200,,601,4.844660194174757
3490221,5,B001BEK88S,"Excellent video, if you love the air and our military you will love this video. Thank you for explaining how great our military is.",1225670400,,131,4.5
3490222,5,B001BEK88S,"I purchased this, like my blueray player on a whim. It sat unwatched for a couple of weeks until today. OMG - if you like military aviation - there is nothing better out there. The photography is incredible. Be warned - there are some inflight combat shots that I had to rewind to make sure they were real - they are. It is just that you have never seen it from the perspective that It was shot - amazing  stuff. Tip: crank up your surround sound and sub woofer. Some of the take off scenes in particular sound and feel like you are standing right there on the flightlne when they take off - simply awesome .",1224201600,10,608,4.196581196581197

3490234,5,B001BEK88S,This is a great movie.  If you served in the U.S. Air Force this is a must!  Great flying visuals.  Different fighters as well as A-10's.  Touches briefly on the use of stealth fighters and bombers which is one of the interesting parts showing how the airplanes are stacked in different roles.,1470182400,,293,4.576923076923077

3490240,5,B001BEK88S,"Viewed on my 80"" curved screen 4K TV and 7.2 sound system in my home theater, this is as close as it gets to being on the flight line.  Other pilots I have shown this to agree, this DVD is the best they have seen and some of them fly in the air national guard.  If interested to flying, this DVD is worth owning.",1458086400,3,312,3.859375
3490241,5,B001BEK88S,"Outstanding video.  In terms of content, story and production quality.  Just wish I could have seen this at the IMAX theatre.  Will keep an eye out on the Sydney IMAX in case it shows again one day.",1457136000,,198,4.297297297297297
3490242,5,B001BEK88S,"This is a great movie that give you the thrill of riding in an F-15, as well as a fantastic overview of Air operations of the modern US Air Force. It's especially fun when viewed in Blue-Ray High Def and a really good sound system. You find yourself ducking to avoid the ""Bogeys"" as they come up from ""your six"".
I highly recommend this movie.",1434067200,4,343,4.292307692307692

3490256,5,B001BEK88S,Cool movie if you're into fighter jets and the air force and such. Take a trip out to DC and watch this film in imax.,1398211200,,117,3.72
3490257,5,B001BEK88S,A must have if you have a Blu-ray HDTV player and a great sound system but it should be much longer,1389830400,,99,3.761904761904762
3490258,3,B001BEK88S,"This is more like a documentary that is being narrated by a high school kid.  Since it is intended as entertainment, it's okay.  However, if one is looking for real ""turn and burn"" HUD video's; this isn't it.",1373673600,,208,4.447368421052632
3490259,5,B001BEK88S,"Basically the real version of what Top Gun would be like.  Seeing the pilots take off from their respective bases and land at Operation Red Flag in Nevada, with all the different fighter jets was awesome (especially in my surround sound home theater system).  Great insight into how the military do train for real theater war scenarios.",1365292800,,336,4.87719298245614
3490260,5,B001BEK88S,"Some of the best photography, with great background sound. I would definitely recommend this film for any one who likes flight and is a private pilot.",1362700800,,150,4.8076923076923075
3490275,5,B001BEK88S,There are many professionally made films on all kinds of fights jets  and pilots. This one is the best. It belongs to every aviation enthusiast's library.,1353542400,,154,4.923076923076923
3490276,5,B001BEK88S,"I just saw the IMAX version of Fighter Pilot at the Smithsonian Udvar-Hazy Center Air and Space Museum in Dulles, Va.  Loved it!  Sure it's combination of real and Hollywood, but for those of use who will never be able to do the ""real thing"", it's a good voyeristic experience. One of my kids flies as a USAF Crew Chief on a KC-135, so I enjoyed that short ""air refueling"" piece, even though the ""boom operator"" sequence was not so real.  Overall, I am buying the Blu-ray DVD because I want to see it again, several times.  It's exciting to me. The most flying I do is as a commercial passenger...dull.",1322784000,,602,4.396396396396397
3490277,5,B001BEK88S,"I have participated in RF and I can tell you its a little done up and polished over the real thing but it does capture the essence and what we are there to do.  If your interested in how pilots and other operators do real world training then get it!

3490279,1,B001BEK88S,I am still waiting to receive IMAX: Fighter Pilot-Operation Red Flag (Blu-Ray) by John Stratton. Could you please follow up on where it is????,1293580800,,142,4.958333333333333
3490280,4,B001BEK88S,"A well-done transfer from the Imax format into HD. The film follows a U.S. fighter pilot on his first deployment to Red Flag. My son-in-law has bent my ear many times with Red Flag stories, so it was especially fun to see what he has been talking about.

Great flight scenes that make you feel light in the stomach and nifty computer graphics that show how 3-d air combat is supervised by range officers.",1288742400,,404,4.45945945945946
3490281,3,B001BEK88S,great quality great fligth scene but I lttle to military propaganda for me. Anyway overal its was good it gives a good example of what it is to fly a jet figther.,1286582400,,162,4.09375
3490282,4,B001BEK88S,"I know I didn't direct this, but if I could ""enhance"" it any, I would add more footage of plane time. I bought this for my son's 3rd birthday, as he emerges into a fan on airplanes. He loved the film. As a guy in his mid 30's...it would not be for me as it was a bit too cheesy of a documentary.
The cinematography is amazing. The views from the air are fantastic. The CGI...not so much. For a three year old boy...it is almost like being there.",1271376000,,445,4.01123595505618
3490283,3,B001BEK88S,"I first saw this film in an i-max theater in the air force museum in Dayton Ohio. I thought it was pretty awesome so I bought it on blu-ray. There are some great shots of our air force fighters and allies planes as well. The story is also decent and more engaging than a simple documentary about this training exercise would be. The image is clear and sharp, the shots and fly-bys of the desert landscape are amazing.

I think that where it falls a little flat is in the audio, especially the explosions and fly-bys, they don't really engage the subwoofer like other films do. The explosions seem to cut off too soon and miss the rumbling booming effect they could have had. A few of the ""bombs"" dropped are almost lifeless, motionless (except straight up), Hollywood gasoline bombs if you know what I'm saying. You'll see why they used some special effects over the real deal in one of the special feature pieces, so while justified, it is what it is, fake.

If you're into military planes and or operations in general you'll like this film.",1271116800,,1042,4.537234042553192
3490284,5,B001BEK88S,"I purchased this for my boy for Christmas cause he is crazy about fighter jets and he loves it. This footage is awesome and anyone who is into military air combat will enjoy this. I just wish that it was longer. When does ""Fighter Pilot 2"" come out?",1267315200,,249,4.208333333333333
3490285,5,B001BEK88S,Watched this some years ago in IMAX theater but decided to purchase this Blu-Ray nonetheless for keepsake.  No regrets as I find myself watching it over and over again to note the commentary and appreciate the aerial photography and not to mention explosive actions from A-10 busting target tanks/trucks (my favourite part of the movie).  Highly recommended to all military aviation buffs!,1266969600,,389,5.258064516129032
3490286,4,B001BEK88S,Operation Red Flag captures some great footage especially of F-15's and F-16's but unfortunately it is very short. I believe it could have been structured a little bit better and less use of special effects. All in all though the footage is quite exciting. 4/5,1265760000,,260,4.8
3490287,5,B001BEK88S,I can watched this movie once a month and never tire of it. I do have to admit that I am a someone who has never outgrown their youthful ambitions/aspirations of being a fighter pilot. The third fighter pilot movie I own after Top Gun and An Officer and A Gentleman.,1262563200,,266,4.235294117647059
3490288,2,B001BEK88S,"I am very surprised IMAX made this since I thought they were good at showing the real thing, but I must have been wrong. Some of the scenes, like the A-10s ""bombing"" the tanks, are fake. I guess it was for safety, but come on, this should be a real movie, not some crazy Hollywood action. I would much rather have seen real strafing and bombing runs from a distance then fake explosions from close. Other things, such as the AWACS scene, look fake too. I have been in the E-3 sentry and know the screens they showed are completely fake. The real plane doesn't look like that at all. There are also some scenes were cockpits somehow instantly change variants. Like in a few scenes, the views kept changing from an F-15C to an F-15E. There are several more issues I found that makes the video look very fake. These might not matter to someone who wants to see an action movie, but for an IMAX movie, they are unacceptable.",1261872000,10,920,4.385964912280702
3490289,1,B001BEK88S,"it's a documentary about the career of 2 fighter pilot, not many time in the air but a lot of time on the ground to speak with the pilots",1261440000,4,137,3.7586206896551726
3490290,3,B001BEK88S,"Both video and audio are superb!  The first 5 minutes had me sitting on the edge of my seat and I was beginning to think, ""Wow, this is going to be one fabulous show"" but shortly thereafter, my interest level began to drop - and remained that way to the very end. I was rather dissappointed, for sure.

The story is set around the pilot's grandfather - who was a WWII fighter pilot and the grandson wanting to be a fighter pilot as well. For me, this video was a hodge-podge of loosly assembled clips - some for real and others that were computer generated, and it just lacked the excitment and realism I had anticipated.",1256688000,2,621,4.344827586206897
3490291,5,B001BEK88S,"Outstanding, I have watched it over adn over.  You must buy the Blue-Ray, much better than DVD.",1252972800,,95,4.588235294117647
3490292,4,B001BEK88S,"This is a super movie.  we love it, and use it for demonstratons to sell speakers.",1251331200,,82,4.125
3490293,4,B001BEK88S,"I love watching flying, but until high def it's always been iffy. My new player said ""you have to get this one - how bad can it be?"" This DVD brings it all up close and more realistically that I've ever seen.  And, it brings a personal story to all this military aviation. Awesomely filmed and respectfully told, I can only imagine what a massive undertaking this was to produce.

I expected just fighter flying, but seeing so many different aircraft was an unexpected treat. Although certain parts were certainly staged, I can imagine the safety dictated control over things but those parts are not cheesy.

It's a bit short, but effectively tells the story. The ""making of"" is interesting, though it's presented in 4:3, which was just a little disappointing. It would have made an easy 5 stars if they had made a widescreen featurette.

All-in-all, another worthy IMAX adventure added to the library!",1246752000,3,902,4.8
3490294,5,B001BEK88S,"If USAF use this video to recruit they would have a lot more applicants.  In regards to the video it's fantastic film making with breathtaking close ups and incredible aerial shots, the picture crystal clear (IMAX+1080p)and the content captivating.
