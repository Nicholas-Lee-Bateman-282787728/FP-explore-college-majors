8150397,5,B000JHL260,"Excellent boxing for the street, prison or battlefield which is very much like the fighting system that the Navy Seals and elite military groups use. It teaches using now illegal techniques like hammer fists and elbow strikes. This is actually a very technical and effective martial art which I think would be awesome for our military servicemen to learn and use. They would be quite fast, formidable and dangerous and could really ruin their enemies day for sure using the moves in this course. It`s very simple and right to the point with no fluff or useless oriental mumbo jumbo like is taught is traditional Asian martial arts. Unlike those traditional martial arts, this is not sport at all. It`s very serious and is intended to get you out of a life and death situation anywhere in this world. If you want a no nonsense fighting system, brutal and effective you will not be disappointed with this set but you must practice diligently just like Mark Hatmaker recommends.",1455235200,,975,4.809523809523809
8150398,5,B000JHL260,"I have had the pleasure of reading most of Mark Hatmaker's books and viewing most of his video series on grappling, wrestling, jujitsu and boxing.  This DVD covers the basic punches, blocks, slips, combinations and counters of the art of boxing, plus the dirty tricks to use for real life self-defense.

I enjoy the approach Mark uses to emphasize important points of his boxing lessons.  He sometimes goes into more detail than is needed in some techniques, but this is his style of teaching. He always attempts to cover all angles involved in a subject area.  Since he has been involved in numerous fighting arts his experience provides vital information for anyone desiring to learn hardcore boxing for self-defense on the street.

In conclusion, this is a DVD that will be of interest to anyone desiring to learn how effective boxing techniques can be used for real life street combat.

8150399,5,B000JHL260,"This video is extremely good at teaching all aspects of boxing including ""illegal"" shots like elbows, head butts, and a few others.  Mark Hatmker is so good at breaking things down to their scientific components, which was sorely lacking from previous instruction that I received.  The best thing in the video is the rock solid defense it has given me.  If you are looking to improve your striking you can't go wrong.  The info is presented in a straight forward manner, and a good training methodology is shown.",1163548800,8,512,4.784090909090909
