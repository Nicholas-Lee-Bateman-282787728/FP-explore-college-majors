8300580,5,B001F1ZD4Q,"This is a great product. I am very satisfied. I got this movie, (we already had the other one- Mole and the Car), for my little 3-year old sister. She looooves it so much! It is NOT scratched, came in PERFECT condition, and was delivered reasonably fast.
My whole family enjoys watching it- so cute, practically no words, but explains everything without them anyway!
Great movie for children- very basic, introduces skills dealing with friendships, making things, and exploring the world!",1328400000,,488,5.037037037037037
8300581,5,B001F1ZD4Q,"The Mole, no words, just cute sounds... my boys loved it... age 2-4 love it specially, but when my 2 old one watches them the 6 old one still enjoys them (just complains saying that he already saw this and that :))

Would be nice to get the whole series on 1 blue-ray.",1261353600,,268,4.056603773584905
8300582,5,B001F1ZD4Q,"Sweet and eternal. A series of animated shorts out of the Czech republic, these timeless gems deserve to be as widely known and celebrated as the works of Hans Christian Anderson. Mole is the classic un-hero who by the sheer power of innocence and with a little help from his friends consistently thwarts and disarms the tyrant and the bully. He does so with sweet, poignant, light-hearted humor and grace. The stories are allegorical and Mole is a kind of national archetype for the outgunned, dauntless, creative Czechs who found little ways to undermine the Soviet occupation. I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough",1253404800,,621,4.980769230769231
