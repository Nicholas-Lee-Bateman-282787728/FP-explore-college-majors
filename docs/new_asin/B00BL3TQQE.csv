8570169,3,B00BL3TQQE,"This is an OLD (pre 2000)  2 DVD set.  One of the DVDs is so old and the filming is so bad (grainy VHS bad), that I could not watch it and I threw it away.

The second DVD includes all of Joseph Rosendo's TravelScope TV show episodes about Canada.  The quality is better but not HD. The episodes are from early 2000 up to 2009.  Some are widescreen and some are not.  These were for the most part interesting and nice to watch.

Beware that the same Joseph Rosendo's TV show episodes are now (2015) also available as individual DVDs here on Amazon and each 27 min episodes costs almost USD 20. - You can get all the Canada episodes in this set for so much less money!",1449878400,,667,4.124031007751938

8570172,1,B00BL3TQQE,Horrid. Old and outdated.  Obviously filmed in the 1980s and the music sounds right out of Miami Vice.  Also....grainy picture.,1426550400,,127,5.3
8570173,4,B00BL3TQQE,"Being from an island in the Caribbean, it was nice and different to see the wonders,cultures wildlife,people and the many places that makes Canada what it is. I liked the programs that I saw,but thought it to be a 2013 DVD release before I purchase, expecting clear Definition, but unfortunately the visibility is blurry and sometimes not so clear to see. If you are looking for HD quality you will not find that in this set. In other words,great programs but poor visibility.",1385942400,2,476,4.746987951807229
