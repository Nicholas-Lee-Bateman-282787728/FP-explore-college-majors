8236383,1,B000ZUDO6W,"The first minute of the movie gives the first clue that this is going to be a bad movie. A mother on a refugee ship drops her baby into the ocean. It is a plastic toy baby. The film cuts back and forth between the plastic baby in the water and a real baby.

It doesn't get any better. The rest of the movie is just a poorly constructed vehicle to push a far left liberal agenda down the viewer's throat. The message is simplistic. The plot is unimaginative. The production is amateur. You'll only enjoy watching this movie made and produced by 105 IQ point libs if you are one.",1389398400,,577,4.198198198198198

Intelligent sex scene and some nice nightly city views.",1230768000,,290,5.170212765957447
