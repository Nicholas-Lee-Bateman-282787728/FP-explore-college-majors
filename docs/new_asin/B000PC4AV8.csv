8190277,4,B000PC4AV8,"Though it is a melodrama and parts of it are improbable, it was still a movie that kept me watching.

Anyone who likes the French classic novel ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" should enjoy this movie. The wronged man, who does not die when his supposed best friend pushes him from a moving train, searches for justice though he is hampered by partial amnesia. How he finally gets justice is very cleverly accomplished.

The movie is certainly worth a look!",1309478400,,452,4.6375
