2466751,4,B000CNESKI,"My son doesn't care for Blue's room, but this DVD contains two bonus episodes - ""Dress Up Day"" and ""Our Neighborhood Festival"". The latter one has a spot with Marlee (Matlin) the librarian teaching us many new signs.

Besides Fred's Birthday, there's also an episode called ""The Fairy Tale Ball""",1154822400,9,295,4.9
