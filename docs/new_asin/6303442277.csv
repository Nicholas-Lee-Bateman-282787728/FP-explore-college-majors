Sho always does great movies .Sometime they are alittle ""campy"" but the fight scenes are always good. JCVD really out  classed Sho in this one. I give them both 10's anyway. The way that they  interact make you think that they should make more together,but that was at  the end of Sho's movie days and the beginning of Jean's.

644086,1,6303442277,"Now don't take this into the wrong direction. I like Van Damme as well as Sho Kosugi, but even they couldn't save this film from being so boring and so abysmal. I was so bored by this film, that not only did I fall asleep during the film, I couldn't even finish the thing.

An F-11 holding a device that the United States government cannot afford to lose crash lands in the Mediterranean. The KGB lead by Andrei (Played by Van Damme), unfortunately, are much closer to finding the device than the CIA. The United States government decides to send in their best man, Ken Tani, The Black Eagle (Played by Kosugi). Tani decides to head to Malta with his two kids (Played by Kosugi's own children) to find the device before the KGB does.

I have nothing else to say about this crap except that even if you're a Van Damme superfan, don't bother, and just leave it in the $3 bin at BigLots! I'm actually quite surprised Van Damme's career wasn't ruined by this travesty. Then again, he was just getting started.

Not Recommended.

DVD Extras: An okay full frame presentation (Take pride in the fact that I said that, by the way) along with the movie's trailer and production notes that no one really cares about, much like the movie itself. Also, the back of the DVD says that there's a Making-of featurette included, but there's no such thing on the DVD, but for a ""film"" like this, it's no big loss.",1256428800,2,1395,4.458823529411765
644087,1,6303442277,"The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix (JCVD-RM)

1.  Who is he?  Andrei, a knife throwing KGB agent sent by the Russians to steal the top secret U.S. equipment
2.  Which family member/friend must be avenged?  This early in JCVD's career, the mandatory paint-by-numbers plot pieces like this were not in place yet.
3.  Does he take his shirt off?  Half of the movie is on a ship in the water.  You think he'd miss the chance for some rays?
4.  Does he have sex with a C-List actress?  JCVD goes for a little anonymous redhead in this one.
5.  Is there a tournament?  Perhaps if a race is sport, and all tournaments are sport, maybe it's a tournament.  Otherwise it's just the Americans versus the Russians
6.  Is training needed for this tournament?  Only acting training
7.  Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament?  This may be the only movie in which a character not only does the splits while wearing a suit and a tie, but he also does it in khakis.
8.  Does he punch someone in the balls?  To be honest, I can't say I remember it happening.  However, given the fact that I dozed off during several scenes, it's entirely possibly that JCVD performed a fistectomy.
9.  Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks?  In every single fight.
10.  Is his enemy unbeatable?  Hardly.  He's just a little Asian guy with big hair and a black belt.
11.  Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? Aside from being a Belgian, acting as a Russian, and speaking in broken English...not really.
12.  Does he win?  It doesn't matter - the viewer loses.

Some planes go down over the Mediterranean, and three were carrying top secret laser guidance systems.  The rest is a race to get them before the Russians.  Somehow, a Japanese guy codenamed ""Black Eagle"" goes in for the United States and a Belgian guy goes in for the Russians.  And that's probably the movie's biggest problem; it's nearly incomprehensible the majority of the time because of various language barriers that aren't overcome.

A fan of JCVD, action, or good movies will be severely disappointed.  He's barely in the movie, and the rest is just bad.  When you begin to crave the acting talents of JCVD, then you know the rest of the movie is slop.  This is definitely a blemish on his career; I'm just not sure if it's wart or a zit.",1221091200,6,2309,4.453237410071942
644088,1,6303442277,Black Eagle was released a few months after Van Damme became a star with Bloodsport. The film could have made Van Damme a wash up but luckily it didn't. The martial arts chorography in the film is very sloppy and the fight scene between Sho Khogusi and Van Damme is weak. Skip this one,1206403200,2,285,4.296296296296297
644089,2,6303442277,"If you are a Van Damme fan, beware! He is barely even in the movie so don't let the DVD box cover fool you. Actually, he isn't even the star of the movie!! I'm not sure what advice he was given post Bloodsport from his agent, but when you go from being the main star in a very good martial arts movie to having a very tiny role in a very bad movie, I think that would raise some questions as to his choices in roles. Likewise, he is playing the stereotypical ""bad Russian""--much like he did in his brief cameo in No Retreat, No Surrender. With the exception of 3-4 fight scenes and a romance scene, Van Damme is no where to be seen. Trust me though, this DVD is cheap enough (or can be found cheap enough) to warrant buying just for those fight scenes (for the true Van Damme fan).

Plot - D

Typical '80's plot with a downed jet fighter with a top secret device onboard that the Russians want and the CIA wants to get back. The CIA sends Asian martial artist Sho Kosagi after it and the Russians send Van Damme after it. The two have several confrontations, most ending in a draw. The martial arts choreography is very good and Van Damme performs his trademark splits and jumping spin kicks. There is a slight side story about Kosagi's kids and a female agent, but it isn't very detailed and not all that interesting. Again, the main reason for renting or buying the movie is for the fights between Van Damme and Kosagi.

Acting - D

Terrible acting from everyone. There really isn't any redemption for this category. The wooden acting of Van Damme playing a Russian is fine and expected, but the lifeless acting of the rest of the cast is just aweful.

Music/Soundtrack - D

I assume there was a soundtrack and some music, but it was so forgettable that nothing stands out.

Cinematography - C

Very nice location shooting in Malta (or a location doubling as Malta). Other than that, the camera angles are all standard and nothing to set it apart or make it very memorable.

DVD - F

Some DVD's claim to have the making of featurette. BEWARE - I have never seen it or found it on a DVD of this film. The extras are standard with an original trailer and some back story bios. The quality of the image transfer is subpar and is full screen only.

Overall - D

Perhaps Van Damme's worst movie of all time. Only for the true die-hard Van Damme fan and one who will pay $5 for 5 minutes of fight scenes.",1147305600,4,2400,4.2971175166297115
644090,4,6303442277,"From the end of the Cold War comes a movie that was probably written at the height of the Cold War, went through several years of production and finally came out right at the end of the Cold War and this probably killed any chance it had at success.  I mean, who wants to watch a movie about Russians spies fighting US spies when you can get down with that sexy East German girl in your chem class while listening to the Scorpions' song ""Winds of Change"" or that cool Jesus Jones ditty, ""Right Here, Right Now""?  As a result, this enjoyable action movie is a hidden gem that few people remember.  On to the plot...

SHO KOSUGI, Star of tons of Japanese Ninja films,  plays a CIA spy who is called into action when a secret US plane, an F-111, goes down in the waters off Malta.  This sequence is probably the cheapest of the entire movie as we only get to LISTEN to the plane going down instead of WATCHING the plane crash.  Guess they had to spend that extra money on Jean-Claude's body wax.  Speaking of JC, Mr. Van Damme plays the Russian martial arts expert/ body guard who is brought in by the KGB to try to steal the top-secret warhead off the F-111 before the CIA can get it.  The only catch is, first they both have to find where in the ocean the plane crashed...

Along the way, Sho kills multiple Maltese citizens and various KGB agents all while Jean-Claude romances a young lady on the KGB's tugboat.  In fact, all of the killing makes JC's character a lot more sympathetic than Sho's, which I'm sure the producers did not intend.  Anyway, lots of action and things blowing up later there is the final showdown with Sho and JC which...well, you'll have to watch the movie to see what happens.  Take my word, though, it's a great fight scene.

As the movie progresses, the viewers are treated to scene after scene of the gorgeous Maltese countryside: churches, forts and of course lots of the beautiful blue Mediterranean.  Malta is the real star of this movie.  However, almost all of the actors are attempting to speak English as a second language and as a result of the conflagration of Japanese, Belgian, Maltese and fake Russian accents, entire sections of the movie are almost unintelligible.  I challenge even someone with a digital comb-filter, mondo-sound TV to understand what the heck Sho and JC are saying to each other in the final fight scene.  But, since I'm here trying to defend this film, let's just call that a ""minor production glitch.""

All-in-all this is a good action movie that can be bought for a cheap price.  Sounds like a great combo to me.  Since this is an international production, watch out for bootlegs that are floating around.  Also, don't buy the SLP tapes churned out by ""GoodTimes"" movies back in the 90's.  Awful quality.

Those of you who read my other review of a Malta-filmed movie, ""Final Justice,"" be on watch for a couple of actors and locations featured in that movie.  The evil bar-owner has a big role in this movie as does the heroic cab-driver.  Where the heck is Hellena Abella?  Ah, well, only Malta knows and Malta ain't telling...",1124841600,3,3095,4.52972972972973
644131,2,6303442277,"In BLACK EAGLE Jean Claude Van Damme had barely begun making a name for himself.  He was less well-known than Sho Kosugi, with whom he had to share top billing. The plot is a nonsense actioner between Kosugi as a CIA op and JCVD as his KGB counterpart.  What is of interest is Van Damme's interpreation of a Red bad guy.  This was not his first appearance as a Russian fighter. In NO RETREAT NO SURRENDER he was Ivan, a Russian mafia enforcer.  Here he is Andrei, a KGB operative who is battling Kosugi for a secret weapon.  When Van Damme plays the heavy, he is somehow more threatening, more lethal than when he is the punching bag good guy.  One of his best moments in this or any of his other actioners occurs when he is not fighting at all.  He is seen as merely talking to his wife who is genuinely concerned for his safety.  Their verbal interaction marks him as distinctly human as they ponder his looming fate. Further his aggressive fight scenes with Kosugi are first rate. Van Damme's untimely demise with a ship's propeller raises some unexpected sighs of sympathy. BLACK EAGLE is a watchable early slice of a very young JCVD as he proves that given the right script, he can deliver acting on cue with the same verve as one of his patented roundhouse kicks.",1100390400,2,1269,4.439655172413793
644132,1,6303442277,"Could someone tell me who Sho Kosugi is? This guy plays the main character of this crummy movie, ""Black Eagle,"" where he goes up against Jean-Claude Van Damme while defending America against the Soviets in a plot so ludicrous that the people confused by ""Mission: Impossible"" would gnaw off a limb from utter boredom and confusion. Now, Van Damme's not a great actor. He's decent in most of his films, but he's not great. Heck, I wouldn't even call him good. However in this film he does a terrific job for a few reasons. A) He has about three lines, B) He only needs one facial expression through the whole film, and C) No one else in this film can act!!! What we get are blank stares, monotone deliveries, and very uninteresting dialogue. Now the action scenes: they stink too. There are a gazillion chases in this movie, all of them uninteresting (I fell asleep during a car chase, woke up and it was still going on), the much-hyped one-on-one fighting between Van Damme and this Kosugi guy is great at first, but the final battle loses the edge and just can't seem to get very innovative. ""Black Eagle"" may have been a good choice for Van Damme so early in his career.

7846635,3,6303442277,"MVDs Rewind Collection is offering another release, this time the action adventure film BLACK EAGLE starring martial arts star Sho Kosugi in the lead role and a then unknown martial arts actor named Jean-Claude Van Damme as the bad guys henchman. Let me begin by saying that this series from MVD is great for those of us who not only ran video stores back in the day but frequented them as well. The slipcover for this release will bring back those memories complete with the Be Kind Please Rewind stick to the category sticker slight bent tearing off the cover itself.

When a US plane carrying a new laser tracking system is shot down over the Mediterranean the country cant afford having it fall into the wrong hands. With some dastardly Russians led by Col. Vladimir Klimenko (Vladimir Skomarovsky) nearby the CIA needs to get an operative to Malta fast. Their second best man is already on his way but they need the best. They need code name Black Eagle.

Ken Tani (Kosugi) aka Black Eagle, is already in the middle of a mission but is pulled for this operation. Hes unwilling to go since his agreement calls for him to have these two weeks free to be with his sons Brian and Denny (Kosugis real life sons Kane and Shane). His handler Dean Rickert (William Bassett) has already prepared for this having had agent Patricia Parker (Doran Clark) pick the boys up and take them to Malta already. Tani agrees and heads there as well. In addition to Tani and Parker Father Joseph Bedelia (Bruce French), an ex-demolitions expert who once worked for Rickert but is now a priest in Malta, is recruited as well.

Tani arrives and with the help of Bedelia is able to find the sunken aircraft just as the Russian trawler pulls alongside their boat. Helping Col. Klimenko is his personal aide and bodyguard Andrei (Van Damme). Taking photos of Bedelia and Tani they feed them into their computer to find out who they really are. Now the race is on to recover the tracking system first.

Of course this will involve a face to face confrontation ala James Bond between combatants where they act civil to one another. That ends and with the gloves off they can now fight using any means necessary. And since the kids are there why not use them as bargaining chips?

When Tani and Bedelia go after them to rescue them from a seaside castle the bad guys are no match for Tanis flying fists and swirling kicks. As Bedelia helps rescue the kids and Parker who was captured as well, Tani eventually faces off against Andrei. This is the fight weve been waiting for as martial arts fans. But the fight, while well done, is short lived with Tani leaping into the ocean to join his sons aboard Bedelias boat.

With no choice now but to see the mission through Tani sends his sons to safety. He meditates, puts on camouflage makeup and sets out to board the Russian ship to reclaim the stolen tracking system. And there is no doubt that confrontation between Tani and Andrei will finally take place.

I remember seeing the movie when it was first released on video actually having bought it for the store I owned. It was a decent movie then and actually holds up fairly well today. It may not be the greatest of action films but it delivers on all counts. There is story, combat skills, explosions and gunshots enough for any film. Its well shot too and the locations are used to their full effect. Perhaps the weakest component here is the acting abilities of Kosugis sons, much of which is due to their age.

A second weakness is also a problem with the MVD release and that is no subtitles. Both Kosugi and Van Damme, having two distinctive and thick accents, are a bit hard to understand at various points in the film. This isn't a poor reflection on either but it does make you miss some of the dialogue. Perhaps it was decided that the dialogue didn't matter as much as the action. Still, they would have been nice.

As I said earlier the MVD Rewind Collection is showing to be one worth picking up. The transfer of film to disc is impressive and well done. And the extra included are some that will please fans of the old video stores. To start with included in the disc is a mini poster for the movie, about the size of those used to decorate the counters at many stores years ago. The extras on the disc are enjoyable as well starting with the option of watching the theatrical cut or an extended version with over 11 minutes worth of extra footage. In addition to that option there is SHO KOSUGI: MARTIAL ARTS LEGEND a featurette with interviews of both Sho and Shane Kosugi, THE MAKING OF BLACK EAGLE with 2017 interviews with Kosugi, Clark, Shane, Dororta Puzio, director/producer Eric Karson and screenwriter Michael Gonzalez, TALES OF JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME featuring the cast and crew discussing the then unknown who went on to bigger films, THE SCRIPT AND THE SCREENWRITERS featuring both Karson and Gonzales, deleted scenes and the original theatrical trailer.

Its not only a solid movie that can be enjoyed but the extras are entertaining as well. And for fans of video stores youll enjoy being able to find yet another of those movies that at one time could only be discovered by making a trip to your local mom and pop store. The memories generated by this release are enough alone to make it one worth picking up.",1520208000,,5315,4.567681007345225

But the KGB team, headed by Andrei (Jean-Claude Van Damme, Bloodsport), is beating the CIA in the race to find it. The CIA has no choice but to call in their best man, master martial artist Ken Tani (Sho Kosugi, Ninja Assassin), code name Black Eagle.

For a film that purports to be action packed, its fairly sparse in that department. Van Damme is in the picture mostly for his martial arts expertise, but he doesnt have that much screen time and little dialogue even though he portrays the movies key villain. Black Eagle was made early in Van Dammes film career, and his acting ability is still a work in progress. Hed improve considerably in subsequent films.

There is a sub-plot about Ken Tanis fatherly responsibilities conflicting with his work, but it simply slows the pace in what is already sluggish movie. The final half hour picks up considerably and includes a well-choreographed fight between Van Damme and Tani, but its very short. The film, shot in Malta, looks as if its trying to be a James Bond film with its super agent-type hero facing off against formidable odds. But it is merely a typical 80s kick flick.

There are 2 versions of Black Eagle on the 2-disc widescreen Blu-ray release, the 93-minute theatrical version, and the 104-minute uncut extended version. Bonus materials include new interviews with Sho Kogugi; deleted scenes; the featurettes The Making of Black Eagle, The Script and the Screenwriters and Tales of Jean-Claude Van Damme, in which cast and crew tell stories about working with Van Damme; original theatrical trailer; and collectible poster.",1519776000,,1782,4.913621262458472

As a masochistic collector and completionist I had to get this film for the simple fact it had Van Dame and Kosugi in decent duels. If you are not a collector and want to simply see these two duke it out, save your money and watch the highlights on YOUTUBE. You'll be glad you did.",1519689600,3,446,4.1976744186046515
