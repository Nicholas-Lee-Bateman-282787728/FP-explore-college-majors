7980264,1,B0000897B0,"This was totally disappointing.  We wanted a dvd that we could put on and have it repeat continuously, this one can't do it.  It is the craziest thing I have ever seen.  Would not buy another Beach Boys DVD for fear it would be the same, unfortunately, we bought two at the same time.  Both are equally bad.",1178928000,4,307,4.241379310344827
7980265,2,B0000897B0,What a nice DVD The sound in DTS was out of this world. I just wish I was alive when the Beach Boys started out. If you like this DVD you will love Pet Sounds on DVD Audio.,1071360000,4,172,3.5526315789473686
