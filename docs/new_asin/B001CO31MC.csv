3515445,5,B001CO31MC,"I consider myself somewhat of a horror movie fanatic.  The problem with today's horror is the lack of real suspense and emotional connection with the story.  All too often its a bunch of ridiculously overused CGI ghosts and ghouls, or a plot that fails to draw the audience in.  Frankly with all the PG-13 teen scream type horror movies as of late I felt horror movies were on the decline.

How wrong I was!  The Devil's Chair is far and away one of the most inventive horror movies to come along in years.  This is true horror in all its glory.  Suspenseful, twisted, and disturbing can only begin to describe this movie.  True the old man may have over-acted a bit, or maybe the narrations were unnecessary, but what the movie represents is a step in the right direction for the horror genre.

I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it has been added to my list of favorite horror films.  Please, keep them coming. If you consider yourself a horror fan buff you MUST watch or better yet OWN this movie.",1225670400,3,994,4.472222222222222
3515446,5,B001CO31MC,"Those looking for cheap thrills this weekend might want to take in the new Saw movie and be bored to death with the rehashed plot. Those looking for something differant this Halloween, look no further. Adam Mason's(Broken) The Devil's Chair delivers not only the gore, which there is aplenty, but also there lies a very interesting story with a unique narritive. Im a huge fan of Haunted Asylum films like Session 9 and the sort so when I heard this was that kind of movie, it was a no brainer. Equal part psychological horror mixed in with monsters and stuff. I don't want to say anymore to give it away so I will just say ""Get it"".Very original;Adam Mason is someone to look out for in the horror genre.",1224892800,4,705,4.4728682170542635
3515447,4,B001CO31MC,"I was really hoping by the end of October that I would have watched more than a handful of great horror movies. Well of course that only happens in your dreams. The reality is that I have only seen two great ones so far. Mother Of Tears and The Devils Chair. The plus side is there are still two weeks to go.

 The guys that brought us Broken have now come out with something far different from their last film, and to be honest extremely better. A guy by the name Nick West brings his girlfriend Sammy to an abandoned asylum, where they start to fool around and pop some acid. They find a room with nothing but a chair that resembles an electric chair. While the acid kicks in the pair began their sexual desires on the chair, something terrifying happens and Sammy ends up dead. With Nick having no recollection of the events that took place but being the only suspect he ends up in an insane asylum. After four years he is placed in the care of a psychiatrist by the name Dr. Willard. Dr. Willard takes Nick and three young students to the old asylum. Nick not wanting to return finds out that the only way he will get out of the insane asylum is to go back and try to remember what exactly happened to Sammy. Upon their arrival the team and Nick began to find out what hell lies in the chair. The only survival is well uhmmm.............

 I had to end the story on that note, mainly because I wouldn't want to spoil the film for anyone. This movie is top notch horror heaven. While I would have loved to give it five stars, the tension in the film was unbelievable and great, but it was missing that extra element ""SCARY"" to make it a perfect five star movie. While some would argue that tension is scary enough for them, to me it's not. However a lot of tension in a movie is enough to make it great to watch. These guys pushed the envelope with the twisted storytelling they did. It leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat and never leaves you unsatisfied. These guys have a fantastic vision for horror, and I hope they keep making many more great movies. While I didn't care for Broken I have the highest respect for the film makers, with a very low budget and only five people to work on it. Now have a seat and enjoy the film, but be careful of the chair your sitting in, it just might be your living hell.",1224288000,22,2320,4.230248306997742
3515448,4,B001CO31MC,"For all my fellow horror fans out there desperately searching for a ""hidden gem"" for the Halloween season-- a film that can provide some shocks or scares, and perhaps even be worth talking about next Fall... well, The Devil's Chair may just be the movie you've(we've!) been looking for. The story follows Nick West, institutionalized for 4 years after the disappearence and presumed murder of his girlfriend while ""investigating"" the abandoned ""Blackwater Asylum,"" now being given the opportunity of freedom-- but only if he's willing to revisit the site of the crime with a college professor and 3 of his understudies to document exactly what happened. And just what did happen that fateful day? Nick vaguely remembers that while searching the asylum he and his girlfriend found a bizarre chair, and that when she sat in it, inexplicably(and gruesomely) she disappeared-- though through therapy and tons of medication he's begun to believe that he must have actually killed her-- but how... and if so, why? Once they arrive at the asylum, memories of dread come flooding back to Nick, and after the ""Devil's Chair"" claims it's first victim it becomes readily apparent that there's a greater evil here then they could have ever imagined... did I mention the big a55 demon?! There's a lot to like about The Devil's Chair, it's stylishly directed, plenty unique, and sports an excellent musical score and cast-- particularly Andrew Howard in the lead role of Nick West. It also takes the approach of having the lead character not only narate the proceedings, but also deliver personal commentary on the people and events that transpire-- in a fourth-wall breaking manor even(aka he speaks to you the viewer directly). A fantastic location filmed in muted colors, plenty of tension, and nasty grue delivered with an unforgiving mean streak(while still not taking intself too seriously)... like I said, there's a lot to like about The Devil's Chair. This is the type of film you could picture Clive Barker making in his prime(with the ""chair"" even acting as a sort of reverse ""puzzle box"" from the Hellraiser films, taking the victim to the demon rather than vice versa). So if you haven't found that ""diamond in the rough"" of horror viewing yet this season(and if you have-- let me know about it please!), give The Devil's Chair a try... it's one hell of a seat(4.5 stars)!",1224288000,17,2370,4.957286432160804

3515462,2,B001CO31MC,"I decided to purchase this after some reviewers compared it to Session 9 which is a solid, creepy, well acted, thought provoking psychological horror film that gets under your skin and sticks with you long after the credits are finished. However, this mess of a movie doesn't hold a candle to Session 9!  The acting here is mostly poor, the narration is like nails on a chalk board, the dialogue ridiculous and the script is convoluted and confusing. The cheesy CGI effects are equlivilant to what you'd see on the syfy channel. The Devil's Chair is also NOT scary or even creepy. If violence is your thing, you may like it, but you'll have to wait until the the last 10-15 minutes. At that point you'll be asking yourself ""wtf?"" as you try to piece this torture porn together.

I think the character of Nick West pretty much sums up the entire film with the following rant he directs at the viewing audience towards the end of the film:

""As you can see it all got a bit silly right here. A girl with her puppies out, a demon, old banana over there in his pajamas. Is this what I promised you? Are we prick teasing you enough? Is this what you came here to see all my brothers? Look at this poorly written, badly acted bulls***! Is there any truth in this b-movie banality? No! No, there is no truth. Believe no one. Believe nothing. You freaks and geeks. You bloodthirsty morons, f--- you! Bring on the red parade. So are there any pulses in the house? You deadbeat, midnight, freak-geek witted torture-porn gore horse! I know what you're looking for, so have it! Take it! and f--- you all very much!

3515464,4,B001CO31MC,"Buying this dvd was easy and it arrived earlier than I expected.  The movie itself was pretty good.  I tend to be a lenient reviewer when it comes to horror movies if the producer, director, and cast make the effort to present a professional product.  After all, when one chooses to experience a horror film one should be prepared to quickly suspend disbelief and take what the picture has to offer at face value.  ""The Devil's Chair"" requires just this type of approach.  It is quite light on story and makes fun of itself, often to the extreme.  While this can be off-putting at times, I appreciate the reason why the device was employed by the writers.  If you're a horror movie buff, I recommend this movie.  If you're a critic, stay away.",1400976000,3,743,4.533834586466165
3515465,4,B001CO31MC,"After experiencing his girlfriend's death at the hands of a demonic relic, Nick West is institutionalized for murder. Four years later, he is released into the care of Dr. Willard, who hopes to have Nick confront his fears and reveal the truth behind Sammy's disappearance with the help of his students. What they discover, instead, is the ""Devil's Chair"" of Nick's nightmares, which serves as a gateway to Hell to anyone who dares touch it. Director Adam Mason defies audience expectations in this chilling tale of demonic possession entitled THE DEVIL'S CHAIR, from 2007. Through Nick's narration, Mason intentionally breaks the fourth wall by addressing the audience directly, mocking their morbid desires with the lure of sex, violence, and gore. What he delivers in their stead is a frightening psychological thriller that places the mystery and suspense of Brad Anderson's SESSION 9 into the context of a traditional monster movie. Mason introduces a unique mythology for the decrepit demon, along with a terrifying new creature design. The suffocating mood of the abandoned asylum makes for the perfect setting, as well. Just as everything seems to be playing out according to the tired old cliches, Mason rips the ground out from underneath us with a shocking twist in the end. Although it certainly raises several questions in terms of logical inconsistencies, it is a welcome change of pace from the usual genre fare. THE DEVIL'S CHAIR comes highly recommended for fans of mind-bending psychological thrillers like SHROOMS or HORROR.

3515466,4,B001CO31MC,"Another beautiful example of over-the-pond horror. The Devil's Chair is one part scary supernatural flick, one part gore flick, one part psychological horror flick and overall a dramatic maze of plot twists that make you say something to the effect WHAT IN THE HELL?! with what a lot of viewers would call a big fat middle finger, and what I would call.... I don't know what I'd call it but it's one hell of an ending. If you're reading this than do yourself a big fat favor, get this movie.",1331596800,,491,4.466666666666667
3515467,5,B001CO31MC,"Nick West (Andrew Howard) does some first person narration including asides reminiscent of ""Clockwork Orange."" He takes a girl to an abandoned asylum for some fun and games. While on acid, they find a chair. While sitting in the chair, the girl gets ""trapped"" by said chair which tortures/kills her. Nick spends 4 years in a mental institution. He is medicated. He is convinced he is crazy and killed the girl, after all there is no other logical explanation, although he can't remember doing it...or is it something else?

Nick is released to Dr. Willard played by David Gant. Nick calls him ""Gandolf"" in the movie. He can best be described as ""Christopher Lee light."" Dr. Willard takes Nick back to the scene of the crime. He believes the chair is a portal to another dimension (Hellraiser puzzle box?). As members of the group sit in the chair things begin to happen.

The ending has a twist which had me laughing. Well done horror-thriller.

3515469,3,B001CO31MC,"I know a lot of people loved this movie and I probably am one of the few who wasn't crazy about it. The beginning starts off great then you have a mind trip throughout the rest of the film. You have to wait till the end to see any gore or action. Throughout the whole film the main character is narrating what he thinks and feels. I'm sorry I hate that. Yes there were some funny parts during the narration. The whole film feels like a psycology session. It felt more like I was supposed to be learning something than to enjoy this film. There is even a part in the film where the main character narrates how he's making fun of the gore whores. I'm sorry, but the joke is on you. The movie moves at a snails pace and you think your watching the ""Transporter"" for a while. The main character would have been a perfect body double for Jason Statham. The acting is good and there are really no effects. The only gore happens with the chair and at the very end. If you can endure the whole film until the end you will see gore at the end. The problem is it is short lived and the film feels very long until it gets there. This is a typical british horror film. A lot of thinking is involved and little to no gore. If you feel like being lectured and thought a lesson for loving gory horror movies, be my guest. I don't want to be lectured.

On top of this ridiculous plot manipulation and confusion, the dialogue used to apparently make the movie rather unique, (if you could call it that), was profane, disgusting and actually is so clearly in your face as to Purposely INSULT the intelligence and motives of the viewer for watching it!

3515475,3,B001CO31MC,"The DEVIL'S CHAIR presents an amalgam of Horror themes that are quite familiar to the seasoned viewer. For example, the mix consists of elements and visuals borrowed from: the HELLRAISER series, ALIEN, SESSION 9, HIGH TENSION and the SAW franchise. Admittedly, the blend is deftly arranged and done so as not to give too much away and spoil the ending. Despite having been produced on a modest budget, DEVIL'S CHAIR has a look and feel that is light years beyond what it cost to produce. It is well filmed and acted, though I never entirely warmed to the main character, (though I suspect that this observation is more subjective in nature). Perhaps had the character of Nick WEST been portrayed as a more vulnerable and sensitive individual, he may have evoked increased pathos. In that event it would certainly have played more with the viewer's mind. Instead, I found this character to be in the Bruce WILLIS vein. Perhaps that is what the film maker wished for, though it did not work as well as it could have, in my opinion. I would develop this theme more, however, I wish not to spoil the film for the uninitiated. DEVIL'S CHAIR should appeal to those who prefer psychological Horror, even though they are not afraid to venture down gore alley. Yes, there is gore here and it is reasonably well done, (though the Director held back in some scenes). There is also a creature, (pay no attention to the lousy keep-case artwork). I was disappointed that the film revealed too much in the way of graphics at the outset as they let the ""cat out of the bag"", to some degree. Also, the use of the so-called fourth wall, where the actor provides a monologue to the audience, was a device used with annoying frequency. As the film was well crafted, one did not need these snippets of dialogue which were thrust at the viewer without warning. All they served to do was spoil the visual & auditory flow of the film. Further, that Director Adam MASON also brought us that highly questionable movie, BROKEN. Nonetheless, the DEVIL'S CHAIR represents a vast improvement and the former may represent a blip in the Director's creative output.

3515478,3,B001CO31MC,"The Devil's Chair (Adam Mason, 2007)

Not a bad little flick, this. Obviously low-budget and done on an amateur scale, but makes up for that with a surprisingly clever script (though it does tend to wear its inspirations on its sleeve) and tons of well-delivered atmosphere.

The story follows Nick (Below's Andrew Howard), who in the opening scene of the movie explores an abandoned asylum with his girlfriend and a pocket full of drugs. Something bad happens--he's not entirely sure what--and she ends up dead. For obvious reasons, he's convicted of her murder and sent to a mental institution. Fast-forward a few years, and his doctor (The Messenger's David Gant) takes Nick and a research crew back to the asylum as a sort of shock-treatment. Only once they get there, and Nick confronts the chair in which his girlfriend was killed, things start happening which get the others wondering if Nick's oft-told tale of innocence may actually be true...

Mason, who co-directed Broken the same year, has taken inspiration from any number of movies and yet come up with something that is itself. There's a fine line between homage and outright stealing, and The Devil's Chair never actually crosses that line, despite everything about it screaming that, eventually, it's going to. That, actually, might be the most impressive thing about this flick. There are so many ways it could have gone wrong where it didn't. Not to say the movie doesn't go wrong in places. As I've mentioned, this was a pretty low-budget affair, and the acting is about as good as one expects when watching movies like this. I believe the movie's atmosphere makes up for that, though; it's quite well done visually, which is a treat at a time when so many people making horror movies are won't to substitute ""so dark you can't see anything"" for atmosphere. And while you probably entertain the idea of the Big Reveal, it's never the option that all the pieces point to, as it is in so many horror movies. This is very well set up, well shot, and, simply put, fun to watch. I liked this one a bunch. ***",1228608000,,2074,4.7555555555555555

Andrew Howard gave an interesting performance but his finale was the real charm. The narration is a bit pornographic hence the donkey punch feeling and that's what I felt this film did not need.
