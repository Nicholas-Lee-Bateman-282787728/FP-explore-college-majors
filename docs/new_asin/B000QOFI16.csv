No one expects her to succeed. I was so impressed with this movie. It explores the politics involved behind the scenes of a controversial move and the intense training involved in becoming a Seal. Demi Moore is perfect in her rolea major badass. There is a lot of action in this film including an actual combat mission. If you enjoy action movies and war movies, you will love this film. Extremely well done.",1487635200,,567,4.514563106796117

This 1946 film seems to use high-speed (and high-contrast) film, which results in a stark effect. It is also a low-budget film, comparable to some 'film noir' of the 1940s. It is about the search for a Nazi war criminal, hiding in plain sight. Franz speaks American without an accent, and shows up as a new teacher in a rural college. He romances and marries the no longer young daughter of an important man (Chief Justice). But another war criminal, who got religion, searches for Franz. Franz realizes that Meineke is being followed, and kills him to keep his secret. Meineke is also a problem since he has got religion; and religion (or personal ideals) is always a threat to any secular system whether Fascism, Communism, or Plutocracy.

Nazi hunter Edward G. Robinson arrives, posing as an antique dealer. His comments on old silver shows he has studied his cover story. There is also a clue to Franz: an obsession with clocks (symbolizing a devotion to man-made mechanical devices, like social systems). Little by little the facts come out to point to Franz. Franz tries to kill his new wife, since she knows too much about him! This symbolizes his self-destructive philosophy, which leads to his fall from the top. Can anyone hide in a small town?

This film was an unheeded warning. It would be over thirty years later before we learned about ""Operation Paper Clip"" and other schemes to harbor Nazis in America. It wasn't just rocket scientists. The film also records a more innocent time, when college students ran through the woods as a pastime.",1374537600,,1579,4.797794117647059
8196726,5,B000QOFI16,"Too much is often made of the fact that Welles helmed this thriller to convince the studios he could make a commercially successful film without the costly overruns associated with his other projects. Getting lost in the debate over whether he should have given in and made it, or whether it falls short of the genius he was capable of, is just what a fantastic film he did make. The Stranger is, in fact, one of the best suspense thrillers made during the 1940's. Set after WWII in a small Connecticut town where everyone knows everyone else, Victor Trivis' story is told with flair by director Welles. Rather than surrounding himself with familiar faces from his Mercury days, beautiful Loretta Young and Edward G. Robinson round out this engrossing and suspenseful tale of wartime evil waiting for its chance to rise again.

Robinson is brilliant as the easygoing Washington agent who allows a Nazi war criminal who has found God, loose, in order to track him to Franz Kindler; one of the most notorious Nazis of all. Wilson (Robinson) loses him in sleepy Harper, Connecticut. He suspects he has been murdered by Kindler, but since no pictures of the mass murderer exist, he must stick around and play detective. Robinson underplays the part of Wilson, giving him humor and determination, his easygoing easygoing manner closer to Harper than Washington. His checker games with the town clerk are fun to watch.

Welles takes his cue from Robinson, portraying Professor Charles Rankin (Kindler) with style, but not the brooding focus he might have otherwise. Rankin is about to marry the beautiful daughter of a Supreme Court Justice on the day Wilson and his old pal arrives in Harper. Loretta Young is at her most stunning as Rankin's wife, Mary. Mary loves her husband, who has her completely fooled. Wilson also nearly dismisses him as a suspect after a grand speech at the dinner table about ridding the world of evil. But  that changes once he realizes Kindler has made a slip! What follows is a tense, escalating game of cat and mouse between two film giants. Richard Long, who would go on to play Jarrod in The Big Valley on television is good as Mary's caring brother, Noah.

Charles spins a web of convincing lies to Mary, but Wilson finally manages to plant the seed of doubt. He knows once Kindler senses weakness, it is only a matter of time until he makes his move. But it is a dangerous plan which could cost Mary her life. An atmospheric score by Bronislaw Kaper and some nice noir touches from cinematographer Russell Metty add up to a fabulous time at the movies. While it may not have been cinematically innovative, this thriller about evil residing in sleepy surroundings while good desperately tried to weed it is grand entertainment. A fine film in the genre.",1269043200,,2782,4.777546777546777
