4117583,4,B003F3B4HC,"For the novice cook, I thought this was a good starting point.  The first CD, Kitchen Essentials, introduced the basic knife skills well and discussed other kitchen equipment and progressed through discussion of common staple items that every kitchen should have.  From there the remaining CD's provide a good introduction to the building blocks of flavor in the creation of stocks and broths, soups and purees and the 5 foundation sauces as well as salad dressings and the proper prep of vegetables via the basics of sauting, blanching, and grilling as well as an intro to brining, braising, roasting, and stewing of meats.

Being a very visual person, I feel I got more from this video series than I would have had I read the same material in a book.",1292803200,5,752,4.769230769230769
4117584,4,B003F3B4HC,"This video is perfect at helping us novices in the kitchen learn the basics and more. The only problem I have with this DVD set is that the companion guide DOESN'T have all of the recipes listed.  This has created a lot of extra work for me because I have to go through and watch the video and then type out the recipe as I watch, and then go get everything at the store and then go watch it again and follow along with her so that I can learn to make it.  ALL recipes written would be so much easier so that I could just spend my time learning to cook rather than writing out recipes first and watching each video twice.",1289001600,11,621,4.040650406504065
4117585,5,B003F3B4HC,"This DVD set took me by surprised.  I was very interested in finding DVDs that taught you how to cook.  And what I got instead was better than what I imagined.  Host Kierstin Buchner whom I never heard of before is such a delight to watch and learn from.  She is extremely skillful and I like the way she explains things and she really keeps my interest.  She definitely got my vote and look forward to more of her!

First of all I know little about the kitchen other than my usual 10 dishes that I make.  Kierstin educated her audience with everything essential in the kitchen DVD 1 (4 total) focuses on knifes, cookware, herbs, etc.  And started to go over DVD 2 stocks and soups.  I welcome what is to follow.  Def worth every penny.",1287532800,6,736,4.306569343065694
4117586,4,B003F3B4HC,"This is soooo great for morons like me who were afraid of cooking!  Nice ""small"" subsections for easy viewing, and Kiersten is constantly encouraging without being condescending.  I actually love cooking now!",1285459200,3,208,5.46875
4117587,5,B003F3B4HC,"This DVD set is great! I'm always on the run and never took the time to learn the basics of cooking, which led to constantly eating take out.
Cooking from A to Zest totally guides you through the steps for cooking and is easy to follow. Can't wait to fill my kitchen with delicious food!",1275523200,4,287,4.236363636363636
4117588,5,B003F3B4HC,I just received the Cooking from A to Zest DVD series and I love it!  I have already watched the entire series straight through.  I just could not put it away.  I am learning amazing tricks to help me in my own kitchen.  The series is great!  It is like attending one of those expensive cooking schools right in your own home.  Great Value!! I would highly recommend this series for yourself or even as a gift for friends.,1274918400,11,422,4.2784810126582276
4117589,5,B003F3B4HC,"I just received this DVD set as a gift and it is FANTASTIC! I'd been telling a friend how I wanted to take cooking classes, but they are so expensive and finding the time to fit them into my schedule is nearly impossible. So she found this cooking course on DVD. It's great! It's very technique focused but easy to follow, and talks about the types of foods I need to buy to stock my cupboards so I can whip up a meal in a moments notice, what herbs to use and how to properly use a knife, etc. Plus demonstrations of tons of cutting techniques. Best of all, I can watch it in my own kitchen and follow along, when I have the time! If you're interested in learning to cook, or just learning more about cooking, I'd highly recommend this DVD set!!!",1274918400,23,747,4.194444444444445
4117590,5,B003F3B4HC,"This is a great DVD collection that teaches all the basic techniques you need to know about cooking - whether you are a novice or a fairly experienced chef.  It starts with the basics that you normally don't see on the cooking shows; how to equip your kitchen, the basic pots, pans, spices, and knives you need (plus how to use the knives); the proper - and healthy - way to shop.  It then expands into all the preparation basics; how to make soups, salad dressings, how to braise meats, the proper way to cook pasta.  For instance, I learned that my habit of putting oil in the boiling water to cook pasta was completely wrong.  It even shows you how to make the perfect omelet.  I was suprised at all the things I thought I knew that I was actually doing wrong.  The DVD sections are clear and easy to follow, and Kierstin the host is terrific.  I'm going to make this my standard wedding gift this year.",1274832000,16,906,4.325443786982248
4117591,5,B003F3B4HC,This was a gift for friend who is wanting to learn how to cook in her retirement. She says it is easy to watch and enjoyable and was very happy to have it.,1364169600,,155,3.727272727272727
4117592,3,B003F3B4HC,"Don't buy if you are an experienced cook and looking for recipes to experiment with. However, if you are now starting out or want to teach your teenage daughter how to cook, go right ahead and buy it.",1362182400,2,200,4.2894736842105265
4117593,5,B003F3B4HC,"coming from the le cordon bleu culinary school, she did a terrific job putting this collection together. Everything said or done is exactly what we are taught at school. So this is like having culinary background at 1% of the cost right at home. I'd definitely recommend this to any food and beverage entrepreneur or home cook.",1360800000,,327,4.754385964912281
4117594,5,B003F3B4HC,"I'm loving this cooking series so far. Miss Buchner keeps a nice pace for the novices, but it's not too slow & definitely not boring. I'm excited about watching the rest of the dvds. This is great for someone who can throw together a few dishes, but has never really learned proper basic food preparation & cooking technique. This will make a great gift for a new college student, a new bride, &/or someone who's intimidated by cooking. I will probably get one for my neice when she's older. I would give it more stars if I could. Also, Miss Buchner doesn't have any weird quirky physical things going on like nervous twitches, hyper activity or an annoying voice.",1359763200,,664,4.588235294117647
4117595,5,B003F3B4HC,Kierstin starts with the basic concepts and skills and builds from there.  Presented in a logical format with helpful demonstrations and tips.  This would be a great resource for new cooks and also for experienced cooks who want to sharpen their culinary skills.,1357257600,2,262,5.069767441860465
4117596,5,B003F3B4HC,"its give you what is expected and as per the ""Editorial Reviews"", I can answer if you have any questions",1355097600,,104,4.25
4117597,5,B003F3B4HC,"I was extremely impressed with, not only the comprehensive content on cooking basics, but also the the high production value. This is a total package of value (to include the fantastic pricing).  The host is knowledgeable and passionate. You'll feel you have a caring friend to guide you through the process of cooking basics. I know I'll keep this as a go-to reference some time. I would easy refer ""Cooking from A to Zest"" to anyone looking for a clear and concise resource on cooking instruction.",1352505600,2,499,4.8023255813953485
4117598,5,B003F3B4HC,"I couldn't be more thrilled w/ this dvd set!  I've watched it so many times & follow along (depending what i'm trying to cook) easily because of how it's catagorized: eggs, sauces, dressings, etc.  I put it on that segment & pause & play as I cook along w/ Kristen and my food actually turns out great!!!  I stocked my kitchen as she suggests & learned how to use a knife & fresh herbs, etc, etc.  I just can't be more greatful that i found this dvd set.  I feel like I got the best of The Cordon Blue training (that's where this chef went to school) in my home.  I PRAY that she'll make a baking dvd set so I can bake like a pro, too.  Thanks Kristen, this was fantastic!!

I also take the little book that comes along w/ it in my purse to the store so I can check items off my list & read tips about getting the right cuts of meat & ingredients for each dish she demontrates in the DVD.",1345334400,4,888,3.977401129943503
4117599,5,B003F3B4HC,"I purchased Cooking from A to Zest for my 20 yr. old granddaughter. I decided to review it first. My 5 yr. old granddaughter just loves it. When I attempted to give it to my older granddaughter, who was leaving to move to another state, the younger one protested. I now will have to buy another copy so that they can both have one. This would be an excellant wedding gift for a new cook. There are a lot of basics, as well as, some excellant advanced cooking techniques in these videos. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the videos. I have spent many years cooking at home and also several as a prep cook in a restaurant. Kierstin Buchner does an excellant job in her presentation and can even hold the attention of some of the youngest cooks.",1310428800,3,739,4.401459854014599
4117600,5,B003F3B4HC,"I got this DVD set for myself because even though I may have TONS of cooking books, I've noticed I need to be able to see what is going on. It is so nice to be able to watch the host cutting ingredients and cooking them. It is truly amazing! I am so happy to have found this DVD set. I've always been very afraid of the kitchen and being afraid of trying something new. This DVD set is the perfect gift for anyone who wants to learn HOW to cook with what you already have in your pantry.",1301184000,2,487,3.9292929292929295

8395845,5,B003F3B4HC,"This is one of the best DVD and how to learn to be a professional cook EVER! And I really like Kierstin Buchner & the way she teaches you how, why and what to use etc. Two thumbs up!!",1496707200,,183,3.717948717948718
8395846,5,B003F3B4HC,"!I'm  retired and enjoy cooking.  Now I have more time on my hands I though I would try new recipes  Like rack of lamb or something.  I jumped on amazon to see what kind of cooking  DVD were out there. I stumbled on this and thought you know I've been cooking for over 35+ years and know the basics, or so I thought,.but I only $35.00 for 4 discs. So I thought what the heck it could be a good starting point of becoming a chef  :) .  on the first disc she is explaining a whisk and what kind of chopping board you should use.  Real basic stuff but as it when on  I learned a few things and remembered other things.  It was great! The narrator  is very easy to watch, she''s  at ease with the camera and not  nervous or in a rush.  I would highly recommend the this for a beginner to a Chef  :0)",1433548800,,795,3.911949685534591
8395847,3,B003F3B4HC,"While this set has a lot of great information, I personally feel that the host is very boring/monotone.  It was a nice afternoon and I was cozy on my couch, so I fell asleep watching.

If you're gonna buy this set, watch it when you're WIDE awake",1410393600,,246,4.212765957446808
8395848,5,B003F3B4HC,This DVD is great for someone that doesn't know how to cook. The chef explains everything from boiling eggs to cooking a roast.,1400889600,,127,4.565217391304348
8395849,5,B003F3B4HC,"I love it, its amazing, she explains everything from scratch and makes it sound so easy. and it really is easy! i wold recommended to everyone, i hope there is also a baking dvd soon!",1383782400,,183,4.257142857142857
8395850,4,B003F3B4HC,I am not new to cooking but I learned a few things. It helps to have visuals such as this dvd when descriptions challenge your imagination. I only watched part of it so far but I like what I see. I plan to gift this to my new sister-in-law who doesn't know much about the kitchen.,1376524800,,280,4.017857142857143
8395851,5,B003F3B4HC,I cook on a regular basis but learned a thing or two from the chef. She shows and explains why and how to cook. I would definitely recommend this DVD.,1369612800,,150,4.033333333333333
8395852,4,B003F3B4HC,"I learned a lot about cooking and different foods by watching the food channel back in the day when it was cooking shows all day  instead of now where it's mostly competitions.  Even so, I did learn several things from this video (like how to make homemade mayonnaise then turn it into different kinds of dressings) and got some great recipes.

The instruction is excellent and continues to build on earlier segments. I found it to be pretty comprehensive.  It is easy to use the  menu where you get even more information and recipes.

This is great for anyone that learned to cook from Mom who had wonderful recipes but wasn't trained to cook like a pro. I would buy this as a gift for anyone who has an interest in cooking.  It is well worth it for anyone who wants to step it up a notch.",1369180800,,790,4.333333333333333
8395853,4,B003F3B4HC,"I really recommend it. A good reference and well presented, enjoyable to watch, truly informative and useful. I am in the process of watching it all the way through for the second time to let everything sink in.",1368748800,,211,4.578947368421052
