It has so much of the swiss and german culture in it. Also stars a famous german actor as Sebastian. But I wouldn't pay 65$ for a VSH besides not sure what region it is. I bought it in region 0, but had a to buy a cheep DVD player for it to get it to work. I payed 30 Euro for it.",1337212800,,441,3.6526315789473682
8327862,5,B001NS2JW0,"This is the second part of the german Heidi movie from 1956/7. It also doesn't stay true
to the books story: Klara already walks,but she had a relapse, but recovered
again and Fr. Rottenmeier is very overprotected, so the wheelchair also comes to the alm and gets pushed down. Klara experiences not only a physical healing ,but also emotional. The spirit of
the original story is even stronger in this one than the first one. It includes the school and the
village in generell. It shows things of swiss and german heritage. This one is
in color. It has a village flooding scene that's not in the book, but adds to the
story. At the end they do a fundraiser for Heidis village. Sebastian is really funny in this one. He is played from a known german actor, who played many funny roles. One of my favorite movies. The only downside is it's hard to find. I have
it in German( I don't think there is a dubbed version in english yet) and got in in region 0 from Germany( Amazon.de), but it cost a lot of money( 29 euro plus shipping, ca 40$ in all).But it is so much worth it.",1315699200,,1071,4.306930693069307
