8556766,5,B00AR5J7RK,"I loved this volume of Charles Hu Anatomy workshop, I own the first and second volume. This one is by far the best of the lot so far. It has lots of great information delivered at a good pace with clear explanations.

It really helped me out with the forearm especially in understanding how pronation and supination work. Its great to get an understanding of how the skeleton works because that is the foundation on which anatomy is built on.",1389484800,,442,4.525
