4259803,4,B00443BJ7W,"This is a great DVD, the girls are really motivating and you really work up a sweat. Its challenging enough too. The only thing that lets it down is the sound at times, sometimes the background music is a little loud over the girls but it doesn't stop me from doing it.",1317772800,,269,4.1923076923076925
4259804,5,B00443BJ7W,Katrina and Karena are awesome trainers! I follow them on Toneitup.com and they are just great. I love their workout routines because they are different and they mix it up. If you want to get bikini ready they are the girls for you!,1310515200,,232,4.4186046511627906
4259805,5,B00443BJ7W,"I really like this DVD, it makes your muscles buuuuuuurn! It took me a while to get through a whole workout.
Definitely worth trying!",1308873600,,133,4.583333333333333
4259806,5,B00443BJ7W,"I have just known these two new fitness trainers and I already love them. I like the way they teach you the exercises, it is a pretty hard workout but if you are an intermediate exerciser you will not have any problem doing it.
I am looking forward a new workout from them!",1299110400,,273,4.169811320754717
4259807,5,B00443BJ7W,I have been using this DVD for almost two months now and I love it. I have seen some great results from doing this video. I am a lot more toned and defined. Katrina and Karina are great.,1293235200,15,186,3.9210526315789473
4259808,4,B00443BJ7W,I thought this was a nice workout. Karina and Katrina are alot of fun and make the workout entertaining. I did find the workout a little on the easy side so if you are intermediate to advance level in fitness this might a little easy. But over all nice workout and nice for those days you want to take it down a notch.,1292198400,8,318,4.063492063492063
4259809,5,B00443BJ7W,"I've been following Tone it up! Since they began and they always have a good workout. When I first tried the DVD it was HARD! Lots of jumping stuff, but the second time I did much better :) It's really good and you'll be sore for days :)",1287532800,10,237,3.9583333333333335
4259810,3,B00443BJ7W,"I love Tone it Up and Karena and Katrina and do their routines daily; however, I did not care for this one.",1433462400,,107,3.909090909090909
4259811,5,B00443BJ7W,Great/ fun video!!,1424044800,,18,5.333333333333333
4259812,5,B00443BJ7W,This workout is a challenge but just the right length of time.,1416528000,,62,4.25
4259813,5,B00443BJ7W,"These are TOUGH, went from Jillian Michaels No More Trouble Zones to this and it is WAY more intense - but also way more fun and friendly. This keeps your heart rate up the entire time with unexpected moves that work your entire body instead of targeted moves. Be ready for lots of jumping around!! You will be DIEING but its great!",1414886400,,332,4.370967741935484
4259814,1,B00443BJ7W,No a fan,1412812800,,8,2.0
4259815,3,B00443BJ7W,This workout is tough and they do not provide breaks between the exercises.,1411344000,,75,4.846153846153846
4259816,3,B00443BJ7W,Definitely not for beginners to strength training.,1410998400,,50,6.285714285714286
4259817,5,B00443BJ7W,We'll it's giving me a workout so 5 stars.,1407110400,,42,3.7777777777777777
4259818,4,B00443BJ7W,"Bubbly, fun and engaging, this fast-paced workout deserves a place on any hard core workout fanatic's shelf. In fact, it was too hard for me so I actually made it 75% of the way through before realizing it was beyond my capabilities. I ended up passing this great DVD on to a friend who uses DVDs at home much more than I do and she loves it! These girls will get you fit in no time...if you let them.",1400025600,,401,4.0886075949367084
4259819,5,B00443BJ7W,"Wow! I really felt it the next day.  So worth it though.  I have not gotten to the second half yet but I am very happy with this dvd so far.  Love Karena and Katrina.  So upbeat, encouraging and their not drill seargents.  Be prepared to sweat and work it out.  Recommended!! :)",1398297600,,278,4.150943396226415
4259820,4,B00443BJ7W,"Excellent workouts , even for a non beginner. The only negative is they are kind of just talking. Could be more energetic w music etc. If I didn't know of them from Tv I may hv rated it lower.",1395100800,,192,3.948717948717949
4259821,5,B00443BJ7W,Absolutely love this workout. Kat and Karena make it so easy to follow. This is not a easy workout so be prepared to work it out. You will be so happy you bought this workout disc as it is seriously great.,1394668800,,205,4.024390243902439
4259822,5,B00443BJ7W,"So, the video seems a bit amateurish & the girls sometimes seem immature.  But by the time I finished  I was drenched.  It was a different type of routine than I was used to.  (I am comfortable doing the tabata style workouts by Amy Dixon & also use other high-impact type workouts).

The warm-up is a bit boring & longer than expected, but thorough.  I was concerned it was a reflection of the whole workout.  They subtly ramp up the workout without you even realizing it.

The DVD has (2) slightly different 30 min workouts  which is nice for variety.

I mentioned that the girls seem immature  the one girl in particular, flips her hair a lot & giggles a lot.  It could be just nervousness, but it comes off wrong.  However, the girls share good knowledge & insight throughout the routines.

I would highly recommend this dvd to anyone.  I will definitely look into purchasing more of their dvds.  I was ultimately impressed.",1394582400,3,928,4.567073170731708
4259823,5,B00443BJ7W,"Worked my whole body in only 35 minutes! These girls are awesome! This workout combines cardio, strength training and stretching!",1394409600,,129,5.5
4259824,5,B00443BJ7W,"I love Katrian and Karena but i think their workouts videos are kind of expensive so i decided to buy this one and also ""Workout Sculpt+Tone"". I love the work outs i do them before i do cardio and i definitely see a difference. I have been doing both of the workout videos for 5 days with cardio and eating healthy and I have lost 3 pounds. I really recommend this if you cant afford the $30 of DVD they offer. This are great and they are very fun and they explain every move they do which i like because i feel like it will benefit me.",1393977600,,536,4.018691588785047
4259825,4,B00443BJ7W,this DVD is a great example of K & K's style and of their favorite moves. It has 2 routines that are quite tough toners with cardio in between.,1393027200,,143,3.9655172413793105
4259826,3,B00443BJ7W,"It is nothing like Jillian Michaels' Body Revolution tapes, but it is still a nice work out. I could feel the burn after just the warm up. I feel the trainers were a little scattered, but it felt more like working out with friends and not a drill sargent. It is a nice tape to mix into my routine.  For ten bucks why not!",1391126400,3,321,4.015625
4259827,4,B00443BJ7W,"I like this dvd! The three reasons why I do is because:

1. It's easy to follow along
2. It's 30 minutes
3. I like the tone it up girls!",1372291200,2,136,3.533333333333333
4259828,4,B00443BJ7W,"These girls keep the workout interesting, and the fact that they both look very good help keep you motivated. Overall, the workout is good. I just did not like all the burpies and some of the floor work in the second workout.",1367798400,2,225,4.380952380952381
4259829,5,B00443BJ7W,"I just looooove it!! Tone it up - thumbs up!!!!!
It's just awesome!! Can't get enough of it!!
Tone it up changed my life!!",1367798400,,122,4.125
4259830,5,B00443BJ7W,"I have a love/hate relationship with this DVD. I love it because it definitely gets results. I felt stronger and tighter while I was doing it, and the girls' bubbly personalities makes the experience more pleasant (as compared to the boot camp severity of Jillian Michaels). I've been doing a mix of cardio and toning workouts 3-4x/wk for the past 6 months and this whooped my behind! There were a few exercises I just flat out could not do. However, they bring the best out of you because there were several other moves that looked intimidating, but I was able to complete (even if it was a lesser number of reps). If you're trying to kick up your routine a notch, rotating in one or both of these workouts will definitely get you results if you stick with it. Warning: Do NOT attempt this DVD if you have not been consistently exercising for at least a few months. Also, there are a lot of squats, lunges and plyometrics in the first workout so it isn't kind to those with knee problems.",1367020800,29,989,4.469613259668508
4259831,4,B00443BJ7W,"This video was my introduction to Karena and Katrina.  They are fun, energetic and encouraging.  There are a lot of moves here that I've never done or seen, which made it fun.  It is also extremely difficult (to me anyway, I am 33 and still relatively new to working out), which I like because it gives me a goal to work towards.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the sound quality, especially in the 2nd workout (abs and glutes).  The music is often louder than the girls so you really have to turn up the volume to hear them.  After a few times, you know the moves so it isn't a huge issue.  I plan on buying their Beach Babe workout when I have this one mastered.",1366934400,2,688,4.12781954887218
4259832,5,B00443BJ7W,I am in love with the TIU girl! They're always so positive and encouraging and this WO DVD doesn't dissapoint!,1365206400,,110,4.55
4259833,4,B00443BJ7W,This is definitely a GREAT workout and you'll feel it the next day!! You are challenged throughout the entire thing but the girls' fun personalities keep you moving and motivated!,1363910400,,179,5.0
4259834,5,B00443BJ7W,"Very good product, came in the condition it was described as, I enjoyed it. Can't wait to get the Summer Beach Babe DVD, hopefully soon.",1359504000,,136,4.48
4259835,3,B00443BJ7W,came on time. I this workout gets the job done. the dvd itself could be bettter. Tone it up girls are happy to you out.,1356048000,,119,3.8
4259836,4,B00443BJ7W,I found this to be a good solid workout with some workouts I've never done before. The only thing that threw  me off was how unprofessional they were. Just how they were chatting and stuff like that. Once I got used to it it no longer bothered me but at first I was very thrown off!,1354924800,,282,4.035714285714286
4259837,5,B00443BJ7W,I love these two girls. They do a fantastic job with the workouts making your body keep guessing what is next. They also have a nutrition program you can follow.,1330214400,,161,4.4
4259838,5,B00443BJ7W,"I absolutely love this DVD! After reading the reviews, I thought the workouts would be way too easy for my intermediate/advanced level - wrong!  Each move is done for 50-60 seconds and completed twice so you WILL feel the burn and you WILL sweat!

Katrina and Karena's instruction is very conversational and their playful banter makes you feel like you're working out with your girlfriends. They each take turns demonstrating the moves while the other one explains form. You can tell Katrina is more comfortable in front of the camera and it shows in her delivery. I thought she was more knowledgeable as far as the specific muscles each exercise was working and her cueing was more on point than Karena's - when Karena was leading I was constantly glancing up at the TV because her instructions weren't clear enough to allow me to just focus on doing the moves.

There are two workouts and they are each about 30 minutes. Workout #1 is a full body interval-based workout - burpees, lunges with and without weights, jump squats, planks, plank jacks, reverse flys. Workout #2 focuses on the abs and glutes and uses no weights - high knees, oblique crunches, backward lunges, tuck jumps, pli curtsy lunges, plank side hops, seated bicycles, bridge with a leg adduction, side plank raises, etc.

Overall this is a very good workout and my new favorite.",1329177600,48,1349,4.801724137931035
4259839,1,B00443BJ7W,"It wasn't upbeat and motivating, there were a lot of pauses as if the girls didn't know what to do next.  I think their youtube videos are better than this dvd.  Hopefully their new upcoming dvd is better.",1327276800,8,205,4.368421052631579
8415682,5,B00443BJ7W,This video was Recommended by a personal trainer for my inability to be able to exercise properly without hurting myself!!! It has helped tremendously!!! Buy here !!!,1519430400,,166,5.185185185185185
8415683,4,B00443BJ7W,The first workout is great really gets you sweaty I absolutely love it..... Second workout on the DVD is muh.,1493596800,,109,4.5
8415684,4,B00443BJ7W,"I really enjoyed this workout. I have a large collection of exercise DVDs and this one was refreshing to do. The banter between the two women was amusing, and I felt like I was working out right along side them. The exercises were fun to do with a variety of easier and tougher moves. This workout varies between doing weights and lunges and then some cardio bursts, which were challenging but not too hard.

I give it 4 stars instead of three just because I wish the workout was a little smoother and kept the intensity up the whole time. It was in parts just a little too easy. But otherwise both workouts on this DVD are a good solid workout and fun to do.",1473120000,,659,4.272
8415685,4,B00443BJ7W,"Bought this DVD when it came out years ago, and to this day I still bust a sweat with their first workout. I think this is their first DVD ever so the girls were a bit unorganized and Karena would always count faster/not in sync with Katrina, so I didn't want to bother with their second workout. It's amazing and it works, though. I consistently come back to this workout even though I own all of their Beach Babe DVDs!",1471910400,2,420,4.2625
8415686,3,B00443BJ7W,"Good work-outs but these girls only actually DO every other work out and they are out of breath, so I'm not sure how they expect someone who is new back into working out to do each work out back to back. if you're just getting back into fitness like I am, this DVD is a bit discouraging.",1464134400,,287,4.052631578947368
8415687,1,B00443BJ7W,"Not challenging enough! I'll stick with cathe friedrich, insanity, etc.",1454371200,,71,6.2
8415688,5,B00443BJ7W,"I love K&K I've been a tone it up girl for idk 3 years now, I must purchase all of their workouts, I like this one because its short but very effective",1445644800,2,151,3.75
8415689,1,B00443BJ7W,"It is extremely boring, not engaging, and the music is almost nonexistent. The moves are very repetitive as well, so i regret buying this one.",1443830400,,142,4.72
8415690,4,B00443BJ7W,I love this workout...but definitely not for beginners. There are definitely some moves I'm going to have to work on mastering. But with that said I don't feel like the brown head (can't remember her name) should not give instructions. Seems very scattered brained but other instructor is great. Wish she would talk the whole time and she definitely has better form. Really felt the workout after done. Would totally recommend this dvd.,1439424000,,436,4.986301369863014
8415691,5,B00443BJ7W,"I have polycystic ovarian syndrome and it caused me to gain a lot of weight very fast. After meeting with an endocrinologist and a nutritionist, both recommended that I need to increase my cardio and other high intensity workouts. This DVD has been great for me. My fat percentage on my waist and my legs have gone significantly in two months. Highly recommend for other women struggling to lose weight and looking for a workout to target certain areas.",1435276800,5,453,4.746835443037975
