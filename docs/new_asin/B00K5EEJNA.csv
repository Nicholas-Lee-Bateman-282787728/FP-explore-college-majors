8655939,1,B00K5EEJNA,"I rented this movie because of Colm Meaney. Unfortunately, it's a one-sided flop. Meaney's character declares pride for having pursued perpetrators of violence on both sides of The Troubles, (IRA or UVF). However all the murders are of former IRA leaders. In the movie's twist, Meaney's character reveals his hypocrisy, ostensibly from a desire for peace. Loyalists are complicit by knowingly ignoring the murderers and obstructing the investigation. The movie perpetuates the myth that only the IRA were killers, and the UVF and loyalists are victims who would stop being violent if the IRA were eradicated. WOW !!!!! Overly simplistic and flagrantly biased ! Furthermore, the identities of the killers are an insidious ruse to try to conceal the bias in the script. What ? ... Suddenly the inspector who prided himself on unbiased pursuit of justice believes that these particular murderers shouldn't face Justice ? The movie purports its message to be a desire for peace. However if peace can be attained by eliminating only one side of the belligerents, then the actual message is that the one side targeted (IRA) is SOLELY responsible for the violence. Complete and utter nonsense.",1521158400,,1186,5.182291666666667
8655940,3,B00K5EEJNA,Intriguing story rather than captivating. I am a fan of Colm Meaney so always happy to see one of his movies. I bought the movie for about $8 in Dublin and that feels about right.,1429401600,,179,4.142857142857143
8655941,3,B00K5EEJNA,"Someone is killing off former IRA operatives. They are doing so with a sense of irony and insider information. The Big Man (Colm Meaney) is called in to solve the crimes. He himself is a loyalist who lost his daughter. He sincerely wants to find the culprits while having mixed feelings over their deaths. His lines are filled with cliches and truisms, ""No one is ever happy until they are grieving again.""

The killings go on for too long without any clues. Indeed, the killers are awkwardly introduced as new characters, although characters I had suspected without knowing- go figure. This lead to a conclusion that appeared to be ill conceived, giving us a theme that was contrary to itself. It was interesting watching Meaney as a detective early on, piecing together the crime from obscure clues and his street knowledge. Indeed, I was expecting more of this type of investigator, but as he grew tired so did the script.

Might work as a crime-drama rental. A feel good Irish unity message attempts to come through, but falls short.
