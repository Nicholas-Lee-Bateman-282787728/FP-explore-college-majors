3475628,5,B001AYX77I,"This is a great indie film.  I also saw it at the Vail Film Festival.  It was my favorite film that I saw there.  It reminds you that you don't need $50 million to make a great, fun, funny and really enjoyable movie. It just takes good writing, acting and directing, which this film has.  Watch it to have some good laughs and watch it to learn how to make a good indie film.",1213833600,,375,4.027027027027027
3475629,5,B001AYX77I,"Outside Sales is a well-written comedy, smart enough to wring outrageous hilarity out of the most mundane settings. This is not a glamorous job for beautiful people. It's a world where poor souls are only as good as their sales figures. Veterans of the sales force will laugh and groan with recognition at the situations and conversations revolving around closing deals. It may be all too familiar territory, but the film handles things extremely well.

The performances are painfully real, the situations are appropriately comedic, and the script moves at a good clip. Tricia O'Kelly and Lucas Fleischer do the lion's share of the work, both making us believe in their relationship which goes from hate to love and back again. The supporting characters fill out their roles nicely too. We get the fat guy, the womanizer, the ditzy girl, and the sleazy boss, but all work beyond cliche.

Outside Sales is a small comedy, but one that somehow makes the commonplace work. The film was a festival favorite, but really didn't receive a huge theatrical release even in the art house world. It's a nice find on DVD, one that seems especially well suited for the small screen.

The DVD looks fine with a crisp transfer, displaying a natural color palette with some shimmer on busy office outfits. The surround mix is centered on the two front speakers, but does the job. There are some truly nice extras including deleted scenes, botched takes, and a very fun director and cast commentary. Sporting more extras than what you'd find on most major releases, this is a good package for an indie feature.

Outside Sales is a testament to what you can do with a small budget, good actors, and a smart script. It takes the world of payroll sales, and blows it up into lunacy. It's the rare romantic comedy that both men and women will appreciate, and a must for anybody who's job description includes a quota or commission. A fun little feature that deserves to be seen, closing the deal and then some. And it's a hell of a lot more fun than Glengarry Glen Ross or Boiler Room.

8280468,1,B001AYX77I,"How anybody can give this joke of a movie more than 1 star is beyond belief, the 5 star reviews are without a doubt planted.

Being a salesman for over 30 years I really was hoping to enjoy it but not with this trash",1407542400,,216,3.909090909090909
8280469,1,B001AYX77I,"I bought this DVD brand new for exactly $1.00, next to the animated Bible cartoon DVDs at the dollar store.  For a dollar, I was willing to gamble.  I lost.  This movie drags on and is completely unfunny from beginning to end.  The funniest line I heard was: ""I'm not stupid, I just have a Southern accent.""  Yep.  I couldn't even finish it.  Clearly, some production company put some money into marketing, packaging, and paying people to write obviously fake reviews on Amazon (and other sites that sell the DVD).  Too bad they couldn't put that into decent writers.",1325980800,,567,4.656565656565657
8280470,1,B001AYX77I,"I am amazed that anyone could say the acting was good, or ANYTHING was good about this crappy movie I wasted a whole $4 on. Don't be fooled by the hype.",1250899200,,152,3.935483870967742
8280471,5,B001AYX77I,"I love this movie. Tricia O'Kelley is a great actress. I love her in ""Old Christine"" and I lover her in this movie. I wish I could see more of her work.",1237593600,,152,3.78125

This movie is awesome.  The writing, directing, and acting are A+.",1221436800,,210,12.0625
8280473,1,B001AYX77I,"I guarantee that every one of the 5-star reviews below are the work of concern-trolls via whichever production house picked up and distributed this awful, awful piece of garbage. They are so generic and banal that they could have been written about anything.
When I read the blurb about the movie on my Netflix envelope I was really excited. I was hoping for a potential Office Space, or something similar. Sadly, this movie came nowhere near Office Space. This movie wouldn't have come near that even if Office Space was written, directed and produced by a toddler.
All the characters were contrived, there was nothing that resembled a plot, even the romantic relationship which tried to be the center of the movie was completely unbelievable. The acting was so poor that I rarely even found myself following the story. It felt more like I was stuck watching a bad improv group at some off-off-Broadway dungeon. The only time I even murmured something that resembled a laugh was at the joke ""It's 2pm! I haven't left work this late since 1996!"" or something to that effect.  I guess that was the only one they could afford.
I apologize to the people involved in this film for such a harsh review, but I feel that it is necessary so that they don't subject anyone to something like this in the future. I guess I'm also mad that I wasted an evening watching this horrid monstrosity. The only redeeming quality was that I watched it with friends and we were able to have a somewhat decent MST3K session. But for anyone who might be considering watching this movie (especially alone!!) I would say STAY AWAY; pull Office Space off your shelf and watch that again. Or go watch a parked car.",1219017600,,1686,4.657718120805369
8280474,1,B001AYX77I,"I rented this movie because it received five 5-star reviews. I love indie films, I love well acted and funny indie films. This film, however, had pretty BAD acting and none of the jokes were funny. From the very beginning, every attempt to be funny by each one of the actors came off as trying too hard and reminded me of the lame jokes not-funny people make. I don't want to come off as a snob, because I usually can find humor in just about anything, but this movie felt like something a bunch of sixth-graders made. I've seen better videos on you-tube. The only positive thing to come out of this movie is that if something like this can be released, there's hope for just about any movie I decide to make with my mini dv cam.",1219017600,,729,4.2898550724637685
8280475,5,B001AYX77I,"Outside Sales is charming, sarcastic, witty, and downright hilarious. I enjoyed the characters and the diversity of the characters. It left me wanting to repeat some of the things the say because it's fun and amusing.  The digital photography was fantastic! It kind of had a modern 50's feel and the music was fun too. I can still hear it in my head. Overall I thought it's a well done indie film. It's worth seeing and owning it!",1218499200,,430,4.512820512820513
8280476,5,B001AYX77I,"Saw this film at a July 2005 screening in LA.  Had a lot of fun watching it from start-to-finish.  The entire cast was great and being a fan of The Office/Office Space genre, this did not disappoint.  Buy the DVD for your collection and watch it whenever you want a good laugh.",1217808000,,277,4.288461538461538
8280477,5,B001AYX77I,"I cannot stop watching this film.  It is hilariously written, acted, and directed.  It is very rare in this day and age to find a film as entertaining as Outside Sales.  You don't want to miss this film!  Buy a DVD for yourself, and buy three more for Christmas gifts!  You friends and family and co-workers in the office will love you for it!",1215993600,,343,4.296875
