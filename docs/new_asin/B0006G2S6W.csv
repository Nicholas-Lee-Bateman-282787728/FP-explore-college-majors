8041461,5,B0006G2S6W,"This is an adorable and inspirational LGBTQ Romantic Comedy... It is fast-paced, it is witty and it does require some critical thinking in order to understand the gift of the motif, freedom alone is cheap and useless, we all need empowerment appended to our freedom so that we can live our hearts instead of surviving our limitations. If you do no speak fluent French of France, then get the Brazilian Portuguese Version ""Os Apuros De Xuxu"", it bears English subtitles. It is indeed a shame that this superb and lovely gem of a GLBTQ Romantic Comedy has never been issued for English Speaking people with optional English dublage plus sub-titles. Cheers!",1412899200,2,654,4.900900900900901

Mix of satire on immigration and gender issues is well peppered with French humour and laughing.",1261094400,2,271,5.4523809523809526
8041463,5,B0006G2S6W,"This movie is awesome! It is hilarious while stoic (if that makes sense). It's probably not a movie for everyone, being that French humor is lost on some people. But it's a feel good movie with extremely interesting characters (trust me!) The only problem I had with the copy I found for W.Hemisphere DVD players is that it has no subtitles in English nor in Spanish which sucks because my non-French speaking friends can't watch it and they are really missing out on this wonderful film!",1126828800,2,488,4.686046511627907
