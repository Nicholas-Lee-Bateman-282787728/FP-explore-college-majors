UPDATE 11/3/10: I had been skipping the previews and going directly to the main menu of this DVD, but I caught a few of the previews recently and I did not think they were appropriate for a Busytown audience. One of the previews was for a vampire cartoon, for example. I stand by my 5 star review since you can bypass the previews and go directly to the main menu, but wanted to include it in my overall review so other buyers are aware.",1287100800,93,2653,5.0364464692482915

4175534,2,B003R20CSI,"We loved watching Busy town Mysteries on Netflix until it was removed. So I ordered this and held onto it until my son's birthday. By that time he was over his Busytown obsession, of course! Still, the DVD case broke within minutes. Just crumbled into a hundred pieces. And the video has a TON of trailers and advertisements that cannot be skipped, even after the initial viewing. We never watch this. Waste of money.",1441411200,2,417,4.648648648648648

4175538,5,B003R20CSI,"I give this 5 stars because my little boy loves it.  Truthfully, it gives me a headache.

However, it does a reasonable job of teaching lessons like observational skills, deduction, etc, all wrapped up in a ""mystery show"" format.  We used to watch this on Netflix, but they dropped it suddenly and my son was heart broken.

Well, at least this collection was here...now my son gets his fix.  And it's a good, clean show.  Perfect for the 4-7 year old crowd.",1437955200,,457,4.512195121951219

4175562,3,B003R20CSI,There is no way what I got was a new item. DVD case was broken on both the top and the bottom and when I opened it the 3rd disc fell out. Two out of the three discs have scratches. My kids love Busytown Mysteries but I am disappointed with the seller.,1405641600,,251,3.8461538461538463
4175563,5,B003R20CSI,A great show for my preschool son that does a great job of bring Richard Scarry's  Busytown to life and teaching about observation and problem solving. With a 26 episode well worth the price.,1386633600,,191,4.617647058823529
4175564,5,B003R20CSI,"My son just loves Busy Town. He has asked for the this DVD repeatedly in the last few weeks. The DVDs play great in our ps3 and portable DVD Player.  Great wholesome cartoons. The series teaches how to critically think about problem solving. I would recommend this series to anyone.

Edit:
I picked up a couple of other DVD's in this series. Upon checking the content of this dvd it appears to be the Second Season of the Busytown Mysteries Series. I could not find a DVD that contained all of the first season.",1385942400,,511,4.425531914893617

4175566,5,B003R20CSI,I wanted to find a DVD with majority of the episodes that Netflix has.  This set of 3 discs was the perfect buy!  Not only that but it continuously plays so I don't have to stop what I am doing to switch to the next show!,1374278400,,221,3.782608695652174
4175567,4,B003R20CSI,"With 2 kids, ages 2 1/2 and 4 1/2, who love Richard Scarry books, we got the Busytown Mysteries DVD.  The kids love watching them and pretending to be Huckle and Sally.  The characters find clues to solve simple mysteries they encounter with each story running about 15 minutes.  There are two stories per episode.  Huckle and Sally are good examples of a brother and sister who treat each other with kindness and respect.

The one major drawback that prevents me from giving this 5 stars are Pig Will and Pill Won't.  They are obnoxious and spend a lot of time arguing with each other.  Unfortunately, their behavior is rarely addressed by the other characters and is often just laughed off.  A few times Sally suggests they stop arguing, which is nice to see.  We talk about the pigs behavior with our kids and ask them who is the better example of the kind of siblings they should be, the Pig Twins or Huckle and Sally, so we try to work around it.

Overall, it is a cute program that encourages kids to solve problems critically.",1371427200,3,1033,4.505376344086022
4175568,5,B003R20CSI,"These are great entertainment for pre school kids. They are 15 min long, enough for a small child to stay with from beginning to end, They teach teamwork and cooperation with objective, logical thinking using non confrontational situations,",1370390400,,240,5.342105263157895
4175569,5,B003R20CSI,The DVD's arrived as promised in the specified time frame.  I love these for long car rides or for when I need 15 minutes to get something done.  The stories are wholesome and help develop critical thinking skills.,1366156800,,214,4.605263157894737
4175570,5,B003R20CSI,"For me it's kinda obvious, but she's 6 and enjoys the little storylines.  It surely gets into the rotation of DVDs.  Product is as described.  I don't know what else to add but if you have any queries I guess send it through a comment.",1361318400,,235,4.177777777777778
4175571,5,B003R20CSI,"My 5 1/2 yr old adores these videos.  Each disc in the 3-disc set is jam-packed with mysteries which Huckle and his friends solve, along with your kid.  Very cute, clean fun.",1356307200,,174,4.40625

4175573,5,B003R20CSI,"When there is so much garbage on TV for kids to watch, I was thrilled to see this DVD.  Every episode teaches the kids how to think in order to solve a new mystery.  It's thoughtful and colorful and not at all annoying for parents.  We keep it in the car and it keeps the kids completely interested while they learn.  This gets my highest recommendation as a parent of triplet 4 year olds.",1331942400,,389,4.216216216216216
4175574,4,B003R20CSI,This show is excellent! The only reason I didn't give it full stars is that it is the same show that is on Netflix instant stream. I thought it was a different batch of Mysteries due to a different cover than the one on Netflix but it has a different order of the shows. I wish they would've kept making the show instead of stopping with the two seasons. My son loves it so much and has really gained some great vocabulary words and looks at things differently due to this show.,1330041600,3,478,4.206521739130435
4175575,3,B003R20CSI,"All of this series are ok, nothing really special.  Depends on whether you compare one to what you would want, whether you compare it to similar ones.",1329868800,,150,4.555555555555555
4175576,5,B003R20CSI,Our son is only 15 months old but he already loves this DVD. He dances whenever the music comes on & I know this is one DVD he will love watching for years to come. I really like the good messages & lessons and how the siblings get along. Great for long car rides!,1308787200,,264,3.9074074074074074
4175577,5,B003R20CSI,"My son LOVES Huckle cat and Lowly worm. He is almost two, and I think this DVD is great for him. Even Thomas, the tank engine has some elements that I don't like for my son (eg: Thomas and Percy disrespecting Salty, or making fun of each other, etc), but Busytown is just simply packed with stuff that is great for a little kid to learn: Voices travel through pipes, if a blue blanket gets in the washer with the yellow T-shirt, the T-shirt will turn green, woodpeckers peck on doors, too, not just trees, there is such a thing as high tide, and SO much more stuff to learn. These cartoons are very cute and age appropriate. Also, you can't beat the price! I highly recommend it.",1306368000,,679,4.3125
4175578,4,B003R20CSI,Got this for my 2 and 6 year old daughters. Well worth the 4.99 I payed for it! Lots of episodes to keep them busy! Nice break from Dora and Diego!,1305590400,,147,3.774193548387097
4175579,5,B003R20CSI,This DVD is a collection of fun mystery stories using Richard Scarry's characters. I loved having this in the car for long trips out of town. I have a 4 year old and he really enjoyed watching the stories (and pretending he was Huckle Cat). I believe the collection is over 200 minutes in length so your child won't get burnt out on watching the same few stories over and over and over. I think this is well worth the money.,1299628800,,424,4.246913580246914
8402994,1,B003R20CSI,"My 4-year-old son LOVE LOVE LOVES Busytown Mysteries. However, these videos have never worked correctly.
