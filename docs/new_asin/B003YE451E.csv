4228673,5,B003YE451E,"Having originally recorded this series on VHS back in the mid 1990s I had tried for years to find a copy on DVD.  When I found it a few years back I had to order it from the U.K. and play it on a PAL DVD Player.  Thankfully it has been finally formatted to Region 1 and repackaged in this new series for US viewers.

This is one of the most comprehensive series for fans of military history and it presents these great battles at both a strategic and tactical level.  It is one of the few programs, especially when it was originally produced 15 years ago, that provided simple, yet clear graphics to explain troop levels and deployments to a great level of detail.  Each episode is self contained providing significant coverage of the events preceding the specific battle and if you watch several episodes you will therefore have a fair amount of overlap.

I appreciate the style of the program which uses only narration, music, archive footage (often edited at a quick pace) and graphics. I especially enjoy the episodes which Tim-Piggot Smith narrated. Unlike other programs there are no interviews or sound bites of either renowned figures (like The World at War) or of average soldiers who participated.  The approach can be summed up in a word as ""academic"", a word that would often make me shy away from a program but in this case I think is very true.

I only hope the episodes from later parts of the series will also be converted and available for purchase.",1300147200,13,1466,4.568702290076335
4228674,4,B003YE451E,"So let me start with the battlefield series being the best ww2 documentary made. I'm not really a fan of the world at war series, but the BBC ww2 series comes in a close second. I purchased all of the available releases that just came out on blu-ray for this series. I haven't gone through all of them yet, but basically this blu-ray version appears to be most likely the exact same as these new releases, but with dvd visual quality wise. The bit-rate shows up at around 7-8 mbps which for reference is about the same as the re-release of metropolis on DVD. Blu-Ray should be somewhere at around 25 mbps. This hasn't been remastered its just basically been rereleased. It is presented in 4:3 aspect ratio with grey bars on the side on an HD monitor. All that saying the series is awesome. It's convenient to get multiple episodes on one disc, not mention how much you save buying the older releases which go for around $15 each. I'm a bit bummed that they didn't remaster or upconvert the video though, and the grey bars are bit distracting (I couldn't find a way to remove them. I believe its part of the movie, not added by my player). Otherwise the battlefield series itself is excellent.",1291766400,36,1192,4.497695852534562
4228675,5,B003YE451E,"The ""Battlefield"" series (all of them) on the second World War are the best that have been produced thus far. Narrated by Tim Pigot-Smith, they contain film from all of the sides that are relevant to the battle being presented. The commanders, weapons, order of battle, tactics, etc. are all presented from a factual point of view so that a better understanding of the specific battle, as well as the politics, logistics and impact on other actions can be much better understood.

The footage used is not the same footage you have seen over and over again in the vast majority of WWII documentary productions. This is not to say that you won't see any footage that you have seen before but you will see quite a bit that you haven't or has not been used in the actual context of the battle in which it was shot.

You will find that you have gained a better understanding after watching any of the Battlefield"" WWII series.",1291766400,50,921,4.542168674698795
4228676,5,B003YE451E,"Whether you're a WWII buff, or just a fan of military history in general, you absolutely have to buy this, along with the other three Battlefield sets.  These are the original documentaries broadcast on PBS back in the mid-90's, they were great then and still hold up today.  Each disk is the story of a different battle, taking you through the prelude, the men in charge, the equipment, the battle itself, and finally the aftermath.  There are no interviews as the purpose is to give you the over all strategic view of the fight.  The film footage is from the actual battles, and not just generic battle footage like so many other documentaries show.  Brilliantly put together, these are hands down the best documentaries on the actual battles of WWII ever made.",1288224000,22,763,4.75

I would say....if you already have the VHS tape of this series....do your own digital copy as you won't have HD with this commercial BluRay copy.",1437436800,,326,4.785714285714286
4228685,2,B003YE451E,"Typical PBS filler.  If you are into newsreel type footage and inexcusable editing, you MIGHT like this one.  I found it a boring compilation of things I have seen over and over.  Belongs in a 1950's archive.",1434672000,,208,4.5675675675675675
4228686,5,B003YE451E,Yet another great video from the makers of Battlefield.  I have not found a single video in this series that isn't fascinating and loaded with information for all who watch it.  One of the better series that deals with WWII.,1431302400,,224,4.575
4228687,5,B003YE451E,"There are 3 or 4 of these and I really like them. They present the information to you clearly and there's much more information than I have usually seen in my WWII collections. They run it down, almost like they're teaching a class. They start at the top, giving info on the country/leader, then the commanders and the army they command, they also describe some of the pertinent and important weapons of each side. They go into details that I've not seen anywhere else.

I'm very happy and have already watched this 3 or 4 times.",1421884800,2,529,4.510416666666667

4228695,5,B003YE451E,"BATTLEFIELD: WW II INVASIONS! is almost certainly one of the best, if not the best, documentaries on World War II I've seen.
This edition and the others in the series are thorough in comparing the prelude, the actual battle and the aftermath. Each segment has informative comparisons between the Allied and Axis forces in the categories of Leaders (Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler, Stalin, et al), Commanders (Patton, Montgomery, Rommel, Nimitz, Yamamoto, et al.), Weapons (M4 Sherman, P-51 Mustang, Panther Mk. V,, ME-109, M1A1 Thompson, Panzerfaust, etc.) and other categories.
This edition covers ""The Battle of Britain"" (the Luftwaffe's campaign to destroy the RAF as the prelude to Operation Sea Lion, the German invasion of England), ""The Battle of France"" (the German Blitzkrieg through France)and ""The Battle of the Rhine"" (this includes Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge and the Allied thrust through the Siegfried Line).
This is highly recommended for anyone seeking a thorough and extremely informative analysis of important battles and campaigns of World War II.",1401062400,3,1086,5.470238095238095

4228708,5,B003YE451E,"I originally watched this show on PBS in the mid-90s. I was fascinated at the time with the high-production values and quality of the show. Only recently were these made available and I was very pleased to be able to watch them again, as my old VHS copies were worn out.  This version contains the Battle of Britain, the Battle of France and the Battle of the Rhine. Narrated by Tim Piggot-Smith, these documentaries are 2-hours long each, roughly six hours of viewing per set. Topics discussed (per episode) include, prelude to Battle, the Leaders, Strategy for Offence, Strategy for Defence, The Commanders, the Opposing Forces, the Eve of Battle, and The Battle. This show does not contain veteran or SME interviews. I still enjoy this show immensely, even though modern graphic production is much better.",1363392000,3,808,4.9411764705882355

4228711,5,B003YE451E,"This film collection might have only 3 battles to view, but the level of detail that goes into each battle makes this a must have DVD collection. Each battle features things like portraits of the commanders, explanation of tactics as well as an overview of the military situation leading up to the battle itself. There is a few more DVD's under the banner Battlefield that might be worth checking out for history enthusiasts out there looking to add a few more DVD's to their collections. I give this one a 5 star rating I really think this DVD collection is that good. Recommend you check it you will not be disappointed.",1358380800,,622,4.612612612612613
4228712,5,B003YE451E,"This is one of the most important television documentaries about the Second World War ever produced. Unlike other series, such as ""The World at War"", there are no interviews with either historians or participants and no descriptions of small-scale engagements, just the hard strategic facts of the engagement as seen by the top leaders. A considerable part of each film describes the run-up to the actual battle, with considerable use of maps, descriptions of the leaders, the commanders, the armies and the weapons that decided the engagement. What is emphasized is the importance of the battle within the whole strategic picture of the war. After this, a detailed presentation of how the battle played itself out is given. Finally, the strategic results of the engagement is described,
showing how the entire course of the war was affected.
This series is designed for someone who has more than just a casual interest in the history of the war, and I highly recommend it for this audience.",1352592000,,991,5.012121212121212
4228713,5,B003YE451E,"There are plenty of WW2 documentary shows and films to choose from.  Some cover the events more broadly or focus on the politics, the inhuman nature of the Axis or the feelings of the common people or soldiers.  This isn't any of those.  Each episode takes one battle and analyzes it for 2 hours.  The first hour is all set up, how and why did the battle come about, what were the leaders thinking, what weapons were available, what the strategy was, etc.  The second hour goes over the battle itself and then the aftermath.  Really focusing mostly on the military side of things.  How the commanders moved towards victory or defeat thru their actions.  How one side found and exploited an advantage.  You'll know every unit involved in the fight, who was in charge of each, how many men & equipment they had at their disposal, etc.  Perhaps almost too much info but I find it fascinating.  Other documentaries cover battles faster and want to cover more ground.  This is the real deal.

I don't know why each 2 hour episode is cut into a part 1 & 2, they were shown on my PBS station as one.  The images aren't always the best quality, this due to the age of the footage but one could have hoped for some cleaning up of the picture.  The first 2 seasons of the show were great, then they did a season on Vietnam and when they returned later, the series wasn't quite up to this level.  Too bad as there were some great battles not gotten to but these are among the most important.  Here we have: the Battle France (why listed second?), the Battle of Britian and the Battle for the Rhine (which is really a whole campaign-combining Market Garden/the Bugle/the Rhine crossing into one ""battle"").",1350604800,4,1693,4.480392156862745
4228714,5,B003YE451E,"This is one of my favorite sets of WWII documentaries.  I watched these on PBS growing up, and they are just as good now as they were then.

4228715,4,B003YE451E,"This collection features three World War II documentaries in the Battlefield series, originally broadcast on PBS.  In chronological order, there is The Battle of France, The Battle of Britain, and The Battle of the Rhine.  Each program has two parts, and runs approximately 116 minutes each.  As you might expect, these documentaries consist mostly of black and white archival footage, shot during the period of the war, often under battle conditions.  While certainly watchable, the archival material is understandably not of the greatest quality.  While Bluray generally provides improved image quality and resolution over DVD, when the original material isn't of high quality, as is the case here, the improvements in image quality possible, may be rather limited.  These same three documentaries are available on DVD, and although the Bluray version may not be worth the additional cost, one advantage of Bluray is that all three programs can fit on one disc, versus the DVD set, which contains three separate discs.

Each of the documentaries seems to be well researched, and the archival material is often supplemented by maps, graphics, and diagrams that help to illustrate the situation or set the stage for the subject at hand.  The focus generally remains on the central topic, although there are asides that provide background information about key factors like commanders, weaponry, or the strength of battling forces.  For those looking for a detailed overview of the events, Battlefield does a pretty comprehensive job.  The productions are not formatted for widescreen presentation, and are narrated by Tim Pigott-Smith, who has a slight British accent, and a rather flat and emotionless tone, that is not irritating to listen to.

As the difference in quality between the Bluray and regular DVD edition probably isn't a major factor, the decision may come down to cost and saving a little space.",1328400000,5,1911,5.253289473684211

These DVD's contain narrations of some of the greatest battles in Europe during WWII and were originaly braoadcasted by PBS.
Each disk goes into the detail of major battles, using actual footage as supporting documentation, some are in great shape, probably restored, some relatively grainy, with a lot of camera shake. You just have to imagine how frightened a soldier can be under such circumstances, the amount of adrenaline going through the veins, and the necessary running for cover to stay alive. Being in the middle of the action, at times, you really wonder how someone could have documented some of the scenes.
The films are telling a story but also are very well documented, getting into the details, and the why's of the conflict, making a very good job explaning the context as well as the Logistical issues that our brave soldiers faced and how the goal was achieved.
Overal a five star and hours of pure history to be shared with younger people who have a tendency to forget or being unaware of what happened back in the days.",1324944000,,1152,4.651960784313726
4228717,5,B003YE451E,"I first saw this series on PBS and have often wanted to see it again. More than any other war documentary, this suite brings forth the awful magnitude of WWII, especially for the Eastern Front. The organization of each segment is designed to bring out every aspect of the key engagements with clarity and power. This includes a critical analysis of political and military strategies as well as the weapons and forces used by each side. The mistakes made by the Nazis and the Allies are told with simplicity and balance. Although the computer animation is from the 90s, it is very effectively combined with combat footage to present a powerful and clear understanding of each engagement. The necessary background conflicts that lead up to each major battle provide a comprehensive view of the war in Europe and Africa. The Pacific War is not extensively covered but the great naval battles of Midway and Leyte Gulf are included in one set. The narration by Tim Piggot Smith is superb and not overly theatrical. I just read ""The Storm of War"" by Andrew Roberts. It makes an excellent compliment to this series.",1312156800,11,1108,4.806282722513089
