8708620,5,B00UXBUQ32,"The movie ""Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" was a big deal when it came out in 1964 as a thoroughly charming French Film quite different from the French-themed musicals to that point, which were set historically rather than a contemporarily. The book includes many classic characters seen in French movies and the story has a parallels with Pagnol's 1930s ""Fanny"" Trilogy. It dealt more realistically with romantce in real life rather than being struck by love in the final moments of the film.

In this case, the story is brought up to the present and all dialog is treated as recitative (melodic speech), with a few songs, the most famous one being ""If it takes forever, I will wait for you.""

It is presented on the stage of the Chatelet, a Parisian theater.
The orchestra is behind the action, with the composer, Michel Legrand on the podium. The scenery is minimal, sketched on white foam board and walked into place by a hidden stagehand.
It is quite appropriate as the story moves quickly and he performers are experienced and able to quickly establish their characters and hold our attention. The story is tight and well told in vignettes that flow well.

I'm reviewing a very reasonably priced Blu-ray with good quality sound and video which I ordered from Europe several months ago. Amazon US holds back on new releases so they can give give out freebie copies to their crony reviewers, whose opinions I discount, given their motives. Since the audio is mainly captured by body mikes, there is less ambience, but that's normal for a Broadway show. The sound is well balanced.

Natalie Dessay and Laurent Naouri are mother and older gentleman; all the performers give top performances.

This is an entertaining and charming way to spend part of an evening. If you are into Blu-ray, it should be available soon - its already in Europe. You can find a trailer that gives the flavor at Presto. This is a musical theater piece, if you are expecting opera, you'll be disappointed - or pleasantly surprised.

If this review has been helpful, I'd appreciate a click on ""yes"".",1437955200,7,2068,4.794943820224719
8708621,5,B00UXBUQ32,"This is a successful stage adaption of the classic 1964 movie soundtrack from The Umbrellas of Cherbourg written by Michel Legrand.  Of course it is sung in French but the DVD does have subtitles in English or French for those who like to read as they watch. In 1964 it was a daring experiment to sing all the dialog in the movie directed by Jacques Demy. It was something like a hybrid of cinema and opera but in a very jazzy, casual way. The emotions of the bittersweet story are thus amplified through the music in a way that mere dialog cannot do. This is a concert performance semi-staged at the Thtre du Chtelet in 2015. Something interesting is that there are no solo arias or soliloquies which one usually finds in operas or broadway musicals. It is all dialog sung between the characters. The melodies are very catchy and memorable tunes which stay with you long after the performance has ended. The cast is excellent and in fact the voices in this performance are better overall than the ones of the actors in the original film. For example, baritone Laurent Naouri who plays Roland Cassard, the jewelry collector who becomes the husband of Genevive, has a richer voice than the rather weak one in the original film. The famous operatic soprano Natalie Dessay sings the part of the mother, Madame Emery. The lovers Genevive and Guy are excellently sung by Marie Oppert and Vincent Niclo who are attractive and believable in their roles. Props which provide some context for the different scenes are carried in and out by the performers. The orchestra is onstage behind the singers and unfortunately does not enhance the theatrical experience in any visual way, but was perhaps a practical choice given the parameters of this concert for a few performances. It would be more effective if the orchestra was in a pit and the scenes could be staged with more stylish backdrops. Some of the original film score has been edited and tightened up for the stage performance and I noticed at least two additional scenes newly composed by Legrand for this adaption which lasts 100 minutes. Overall it is a very enjoyable performance best heard in the original French.",1437868800,8,2166,4.76063829787234
8708622,2,B00UXBUQ32,"I purchased this; it arrived; I started to play it; I returned it

The description on the page STILL says there is an English sound track

There is not

When I tried to alert the powers that be that there was a mistake, I was offered 2 possibilities to confirm that what I was saying was a fact: Either the manufacturer confirmed it, or outside others confirmed it.

I was NOT offered the possibility of having seen and heard it for myself, so the change was not made

The music is lovely; the staging is almost as good as the film

If you don't mind the fact that there is no English soundtrack, by all means, enjoy",1436486400,,616,4.222222222222222
