8674220,5,B00MR9HOPG,"I've been putting off reviewing this one for awhile , not because I didn't like it , but because I was forced to attend many garage sales this summer and after perusing so much Tupperware from 1994 I simply couldn't bring myself to review this Tales From The Crypt-like release, which actually Rules fairly hard.

It's 3 tales , all dark , all twisted, and well done.

Can you imagine an old lady that's so in love with her husband that after she finds him dead on the sofa after yet another night of watching dating shows on regular tv that she simply lets his body decay in the living room and continues to watch tv with him for weeks on end ??? You don't need to, this movie takes care of that problem for you.

It is small town life and some of the dilemma's and insanity contained therein, each tale is from a particular year and a particular small town from within the last 20 years or so.

This one rules. But if you consider horror something watered-down and light like Scream then this one is NOT for you.",1502928000,,1014,4.293193717277487

8674224,5,B00MR9HOPG,"An amazing tour de force into the depravity of the horrors that can happening right next door to you. As a viewer I was enthralled with the way the 3 separate stories of ""Ellie"", ""The Family Rubin"",and ""Elmer & Iris"" all intertwine through the generations with stories involving the lives of a teenager, a 30 something married couple, and an elderly couple. Director Matt Garrett has made a film that is on par with films such as Todd Solondz' ""Happiness"" or Douglas Buck's ""Family Portraits: A Trilogy of America"". A must see for any fan of the type of horror movies that leave you feeling empty inside and a void where the part of your soul this film has taken remains. 5 stars doesn't seem like a high enough rating for a film that sticks with you long after you have seen it as this one does.",1415664000,3,796,4.421768707482993
