1236390,5,B00000JPH0,"I saw this at a film festival years ago, expecting little, and was just awed by it's unembellished view of war. I've since seen it again on video and this has only reinforced the fact that in the years since, having seen many, many other documentaries and war films, this still remains the best. Superb characterisation, pace, and tight directing. Never short of action; it doesn't ever become maudlin, boring, or jingoistic. The Actors are regular people, just like the soldiers who fought in this War; and the desperation and determination of tiny Finland holding back Russia is palpable and made utterly and frighteningly credible.
Many have tried to make the ""definitive"" war movie, but none have succeeded like this Director with this Film!  Peckinpah comes close with ""Cross Of Iron"". Purely and simply a benchmark for War films, and a Masterpiece of filmmaking.",1002153600,12,868,5.027777777777778
1236391,5,B00000JPH0,"It's simply a very realistic movie. Portraying war and individual emotions to the extent that you feel it to the bone. Showing the Finns mentality that they would not give an inch and even would die to rescue their horse from being left behind to be eaten by the Russians.
No Holywood stunts or un-realistic effects that plague most if not all movies originated in the USA.
There is only one war movie I like better and that is the black & white movie Tuntematon Sotilas (Unknown Soldier) and perhaps the color recast that was released a few years ago.",999216000,10,552,4.53
1236392,5,B00000JPH0,"This was one of the best war movies I ever saw. The action was great and I did not even mind the sub-titles. The weapons and equipment were real, I especially got a joy at seeing the Tokarev SVT's. Highly recommended.",998092800,3,217,4.317073170731708
1236393,5,B00000JPH0,"This was a war that the Soviet Union waged on Finland in the winter of 1939 to gain access to a port.  They got quite a shock when they were met by extremely stiff resistance.  This movie chronicles a group of friends who go together to the front to fight.  This is a tough bunch of guys, but they never lose their humanity, like most of the nazi soldiers did.  The Soviet forces were lacking leadership due to the fact that Stalin had decimated their ranks in one of his insane paranoid murderous purges.  This is the war that convinced Hitler that the Soviets would crumble when his army attacked them.  The film does have a kind of washed out, grainy look, a little more than Saving Private Ryan did, but that didn't detract from the movie.  It kind of emphasized the bleakness those men were facing.  This movie has great battle action sequences, and I'll bet if there were environmentalists on the set, they'd have all had heart attacks because of the number of trees that were destroyed by tanks and artillary.  This movie isn't hampered by contrived plots, like SPR, or unnecessary love triangles, like what is in Enemy at the Gates (which is a good movie in every other respect).  The only quibble I have with this movie is that the subtitles were sometimes hard to read and the English wasn't always correct (but that was kind of comical).",985219200,55,1348,4.533057851239669
1236394,4,B00000JPH0,This movie will appear to die-hard war movie fans since it has lots of realistic action.  The Russo-Finish War is not known by many people; this movie does a good job by showing the viewer how lopsided the numbers were between the two armies.  My only gripe with the movie is the quality of the tape.  Quite often it has a grainy look to it that was annoying.  I could tell immediately that this was not a big bucks US production.,981590400,10,430,4.271604938271605
1236395,5,B00000JPH0,"""Winter War"" (Talvisota in Finnish)is the story of the 1939-40  Russo-Finnish War seen through the eyes of a reserve infantry unit.  We see  them leaving their farms on mobilization, to assembly at the border, and  follow them into battle until the armistice some 110 days later.  To most  Americans who know anything about it, the Winter War is visions of Sissi  skiing rings around Russians. True that did happen, but the majority of  Finnish units operated conventionally either in the Mannerheim Line or to  the North/North East of it.  This is what this film describes.  The battle  scenes are as authentic as any in Saving Private Ryan; if memory serves the  ""Soviet"" Forces are Russian extras.  Vehicles, weapons, uniforms  are all entirely accurate.  It's probably fair to consider this movie as  Finland's SPR.  Whereas some have criticized SPR for it's somewhat  contrived plot, this movie has none of that; simply citizen soldiers called  to save their nation.  We watch as more and more of their friends are  killed and wounded, in relentless Red Army assaults.  This sense of loss is  brought home again simply, but elegantly, in the scenes with the ""home  front"".  The final anticlimatic news of the armistice on the troops is  depressing to see, but again entirely accurate. This film is a fitting  tribute to the Finnish ""Greatest Generation"" who also did nothing  less than save their nation- twice in 5 years from Soviet enslavement.",965692800,293,1451,4.9789915966386555
1236396,5,B00000JPH0,"This movie depicts all the crudeness and fierness of the war. It's the story of a group of friends  set in the middle of the Soviet invasion of 1939. Perhaps this story isn't widely known because the Soviets were  ""good guys"" during the WWII and the finnishs seem to be related  with Germany (they all wear german uniforms, helmets and equipment) but the  true is that this movie show us that Findland is victim of a Soviet  aggression and all the men must abandon their lives in order to defend  their families, women and homes (we all know how barbaric the russians  were, they always took the women as a war loot)
Give a chance to the  movie, it begins somewhat boring, but it's because we are introduced to the  surroundings and lives of these young finnishs men, once that the war  begins, it all is the hell on Earth.",956793600,15,823,4.426666666666667

This movie follows a Finnish company from mobilization to  war's end, with plenty of action and some leave in between. The numbers of  people involved, from the Russian wave attacks to the marching soldiers, is  also seldom seen these days. Overall, it's an excellent film.",945561600,29,514,4.4361702127659575
1236399,5,B00000JPH0,"This is a very good movie about Finnish troops trying to repel the massive Soviet invasion of Finland in the early part of World War II.  It has many tense, gut-wrenching battle scenes and some interesting, admirable  characters.  Some parts are almost heart-stopping, including outnumbered  Finnish troops watching huge numbers of Soviets attacking their trenches,  and Finns going out in the open to stop the Soviet tanks. Other scenes of  soldiers visiting their families behind the lines are also effective.",933465600,38,511,5.325

1236425,5,B00000JPH0,"No critique or words can describe the quality or exceptional battlefield scenes that are shown, not in HOLLYWOOD dramatic effect but how REAL SOLDIERS HAD TO FIGHT IT OUT.
The Historical Background introduction is brief and concise prelude to events,, where men receive their orders to report for duty, on maneuvers.
During this process ,  the  diplomatic negotiations between Finland and Stalin are passed along from Officers to the Ranks, as well as rumors, as Finnish troops begin moving up to the borders. Then it begins with  a Finnish Sentry Running to report that  the Russians are moving across the border onto Finnish Land,  as a heavy concentration of Russian Artillery rocks the area, keeping their cool the Finnish Soldiers stay in their foxholes and trenches, losing one or two careless soldiers. From this point on, the ""routine"" business of trench war dealing with each new problem as it happens,  proceeds,  with the tactics and snap decisions and consequences of even minor lapse of vigilance caused.
In this grueling battle that is a 105 day attack, it was surprising to see that the Russians used a combined arms attack of fighters, bombers, Tanks and Artillery to support the advance of their Rifle Divisions. equipped with a surprising amount of firepower, and light machine guns. It was of great interest to finally realize that the Russian Tanks could not depress their guns low enough to sweep the Trenches, and could not traverse the Trenches without getting stuck or tipped over,  once the trenchline was reached and that for this reason, among others the Finnish Troops withstood the hail of gunfire and artillery.
The tactical problems are the random events that happen in war and not the hollywood WW 2 where disgruntled character actors somehow always know what to expect.",1458259200,,1802,5.023489932885906

1236428,5,B00000JPH0,"Raw, numbing, brutal at times. It is an almost forgotten theater of WWII and I think that's an absolute shame. Then again, there aren't names like Montgomery, Patton, Guderian or Rommel to hang your hat on as related to Finland's desperate repelling of Russian hordes in what is known as ""The Winter War.""

This excellent film is shown from the perspective of the sometimes starving, often freezing and always under-supplied Finnish grunts. There is minimal ""flashiness"" to the film in the way of tanks and air support (all of it Russian and all of it from the comparatively-awkward early days of WWII), but don't let this deceive you. ""The Winter War"" will be one the most brutally-honest grunt war films you're likely to ever see. The under-manned Finnish are relegated to trench tactics as they have to dig-in against the Russian troops and smaller early-war tanks as they set themselves against occasional 10-1 manpower disadvantages.

The film honestly and effectively portrays the wide-eyed, young and inexperienced Finnish soldiers during their time traveling to the war offices to receive a ""uniform"" that was later forthcoming and supplies that would have to catch-up with them once they reached the front. As the viewer, you can't shake that uncomfortable feeling, making this an effective build-up to the oncoming conflict. The acting in the film is first-rate as director Pekka Parikka chronicles the brothers Paavo and Martti grimly heading to war against the communist slave-drivers. You can't escape the raw brutality ""The Winter War"" dishes out, but any departure from this would have detracted from the film as well as the reality of the situation. The combat scenes of repeated waves of Russians will leave you feeling quite drained afterwards. This occurred to me when one of the soldiers goes on temporary leave -- there's almost a ringing in your ears compounded by that soldier's grim, outward shell shock.

For me this film was an ""impulse buy,"" because I had simply never heard of it before. And the film was excellent! Despite how terrific this film was, I basically had to product-link-search in order to eventually stumble across it. Not only is it a shame that the actual ""Winter War"" is a historical footnote, but it is also a shame that the film itself isn't more prevalent. If you are looking for a war film that goes beyond the simplistic view that Henry Fonda or Audie Murphy ""won the war,"" then I highly suggest ""The Winter War.""",1451865600,6,2463,4.958837772397095

1236477,5,B00000JPH0,"Very few people have any idea what the winter war film is about. I am a student of history and without reservation encourage those interested in the WW II era to buy or rent this film. It is a true story about a small nation named Finland that was heroic and noble in their cause of going to war against the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has and as Russia is still seeking imperalisrtic designs on any nation that they find vulnerable. The brave and fearless Finns were attached by the Soviets because they would not give them land and water to expand a larger buffer around Leiningrad. The Soviets bullied, threatened, and did everything possible to get the people of Finland to ""hand over"" the land lusted after by the Soviets. It would be like Bristish Columbia wanting lartge portions of Washington State for free. Anyway, the Soviets attacked Finland and thought that they would be a push over. A very grave mistake by the Soviets! The Finns were outnumbered 20 to 1 by the Soviets yet the brave and noble Finns inflicted very heavy casualities on the Soviets. The Finns were much better soldiers and could have beaten the Soviets if they had abundant modern weapons such as artillary, fighter and bomber fleets, tanks, and other equipment. They had the finest submachine gun in the world and it was copied by the Soviets. The war ended, and Finland was forced to give land to the Soviets but the cost in blood for the Soviets was very high. I believe that Hitler moved up his timetable for attack on the Soviets because he thought that if so few could nearly beat so many, then how much more successful would many superior soldiers with the best armament do against the Communist enemy. Bad mistake and filled with faulty planning as the end of the war proved. My admiration for the Finnish people and soldiers is stellar. I have bought Sako rifles and Summno watches and can tell you they are the finest in the world for the price paid. I am very glad that Finland is alive and well today.

This is an episode generally only of interest to historians, but the film is well worth the watching.  Focusing more on the Finns called to duty to contest the Soviet invasion, than on geopolitics, The Winter War is a graphic view of men at war.  Most are patriotic, all have differing levels of training, incentives and reasons vary, but all ultimately fight for friends, comrades, neighbors and even strangers beside them in the trenches.

The privations of a Winter war, the lack of knowledge regarding anything not immediately before them, a determined enemy and leadership ranging from competent to disastrous.

The battles were not that well staged but had some elements of real world fighting. I kept wondering about why the trenches were so shallow and when the guys standing up with half of their body exposed and looking over the trench didn't get shot.  The most disturbing thing about the movie is the English subtitles.  It seemed that the subtitles was a first draft awaited an edit.  Words had ""?"" in the middle of them and even had some words in Korean writing.

The attention to detail would make any combat movie critic happy. While some scenes seem overly long, such as troops marching to the front, they are, in all actuality, ideal for conveing the impression of how armies operated in the early 20th century, and the drudgery of daily operations.  While not an old movie per se, it still has a cast of hundreds, if not thousands. There are no CGI effects in this one. The Russian tanks you see are the real deal.

Since Finland is still, well, FINLAND, you can probably derive the outcome.

This movie is about THAT war.

It starts in the Finn homeland as citizen soldiers are called up, leaving homes and families and loves behind them, and progresses to horrendous and seemingly futile battles as the small and ill-equipped Finn army faces down the Soviet might.

It's hard to define SISU in English -- but maybe ""Cool Spirit versus any ongoing grim odds"" -- will at least do for Talvisota. This fine movie presents a quite grimly realistic story of a group of Finns -- who hold-out against the Russians for about 100 days in their Army unit -- ""They held back the Russian Juggernaut in a frozen Hell!"" -- as per movie DVD case [front cover bottom]. This movie is the most realistic WW II era war presentation I've seen so far. I was amazed by the accurate production material and settings -- cottage interiors, horse drawn sleighs, old trains, tanks, aircraft, weapons, shots, bombs, tension, grim looks, trench warefare and, most especially, grimly bloody combat -- including hand-to-hand via rifle butts, bayonets, knives, boots, fists and throws. Some may find all of this grimness too much -- I appreciate the realism -- even the injury and nudity in exact context. The Russ have not had an easy history either. Northeast Europe is just not an easy setting and seems to nurture stoic folks. The acting and dialog are spot-on -- not under or over done. There is just a bit of humanity and humor to round-out this singular movie about a singular time.

1236583,5,B00000JPH0,"When most people think of the 1939-1940 Winter War between the Soviets and the Finns, they think of outnumbered Finnish troops using guerilla tactics, moving into the forest, cutting off Soviet divisions, splitting them apart, and defeating them in detail.  While this picture is true for the largely undeveloped eastern and northern parts of Finland, in the south, the Finns and Soviets fought a more conventional form of warfare in and near the Mannerheim line.  This movie, ""Winter War"", tells the tale of a fictional platoon of reservists that fought in the south, from their initial call-up until the final Finnish acceptance of Soviet terms and end of the war.

This movie was produced in Finland and had both a 195 minute theatrical release and was a five part, 265 minute, mini-series shown on Finnish TV.  In the US, it was released as a shortened 125 minute feature.  This DVD edition that I'm reviewing restores the 70 minutes that were cut.  While it's a Korean import, it's subtitled in English.  By and large, the subtitling is excellent, except for the occasional Finnish place-name, where you get some jumbled letters/symbols instead of the place-name.

The movie itself is outstanding.  From the use of the tactics from the time, use of actual tanks and aircraft (or replicas) used during the war, and realist depiction of life in the trenches, everything is authentic and believable.  I've seen pictures of the trenches from the Mannerheim line and they look identical to the fighting positions as laid out in the movie.  Most of the action-part of the movie takes place in two locations.  This is a plus, as it affords you the opportunity to become familiar with the fighting positions, and you almost feel that you're there, too, through that familiarity.

This move does not hide the brutality or gruesomeness of war.  Several scenes are truly gory, although that was true of the war and the film makers are correct in their decision to show this level of detail.  War is hell, and it would be wrong to ""pretty it up"".  In the early part of the movie you get to know the various main characters, and you feel a sense of loss as they get picked off, one after the other.

The movie doesn't attempt to give any large lessons about life ... it show the courage (of both sides) and the Finns stubborn pride and willingness to fight for their country, even though they were fighting a country with over 40 times their population.  In the end, they were forced to sign a peace treaty that gave away all in all, 11% of their territory and 30% of the economic assets of pre-war Finland.  But through their efforts, they were able to maintain their independence, unlike the Baltic States who were later forcibly incorporated into Soviet Union.

1236586,4,B00000JPH0,"it is the business of the artist to follow it home to the heart of the individual fighters-not to talk in armies and nations and numbers-but to track it home."" D.H. Lawrence

The Russo-Finnish War, known as ""The Winter War"", began on November 30, 1939 when the Red Army invaded Finland. The war began after the Finns refused demands from Stalin to move its borders 25 kilometers back from Leningrad. The basis for this demand was the fear on the part of Stalin and the Soviet High Command that Hitler could launch an invasion of the USSR directed at Leningrad using Finland as a base for its attack. The Winter War ended by means of a truce signed on March 12, 1940. During this brief three-month war a Finnish army consisting of 180,000 men, most of them reservists waged a defensive battle against an advancing Soviet army of about 450,000 men. Fighting from entrenched positions against full-frontal assaults resulted in the death of close to 23,000 Finnish soldiers. At the same time more than 126,000 Soviet soldiers were killed or missing and another 264,000 were wounded. This short war had a dramatic impact on the future course of the Second World War (the Winter War took place during the `phony war' period between the occupation of Poland and the commencement of Germany's invasion of France). The horrifying losses suffered by the Red Army were a reflection of the chaos caused by purges of the military that practically eliminated every professional officer from the Red Army. This vulnerability could only have encouraged Hitler in making his decision to invade the USSR in June 1941. Finnish film director Pekka Parikka's 1989 film ""The Winter War"" is an exceptionally well made movie about this little-known (at least to me) war. The film is not about armies fighting armies as much as it is about the individual fighters who, collectively, are called upon to wage war against an invading army.

Parikka's film follows the war through the eyes of a small platoon of reservists called up from their village to fight the war. It begins with their mobilization and their trip to the front lines through three months of brutal and bloody fighting. The film appears to be very accurate from a historic perspective. The reservists are shown being issued incomplete, if any, uniforms, and finding gear and supplies when and if they can. The Finns, lacking in anti-tank weaponry invented the Molotov Cocktail to use against Soviet mechanized divisions and the film shows these ad hoc weapons being used to great effect. Particularly well done are the scenes that show the impact of the war on the rather stoic inhabitants of the platoon's village.

The Winter War is a straight-forward narrative of the war and how it was fought. It has a particular emphasis on the ugly reality of war. It is not for the squeamish. The film is not an examination of the souls or characters of the people that fought the war. This is true even of the principal actors. The characters in the film are involved in fighting a war, they are not there to engage in discussions of the meaning of life. However, I thought the film was very well done and certainly worth watching. Those with an interest in war films generally or interested in well made films that cover corners of our history that is not overly familiar to them should find this a rewarding film to watch.",1294358400,10,3357,4.774526678141136

1236588,5,B00000JPH0,"The Winter War lasted from December 1939 into April 1940 and was fought between Finland and Russia. How a small country of some 3,5 million people could withstand for so long massive attacks from the mighty Soviet Union of 180 million inhabitants has been a bit of a mystery ever since, or at least until the acclaimed Finnish writer Antti Tuuri published his excellent novel ""The Winter War"" in the 1980s. It's an extremely tersely written account told in first person by its main character Matti, a member of the Finnish homeguard, who, along with his younger and somewhat more emotional brother, is called up for military service in the weeks leading up to the war. The novel reads like nothing you have ever seen, with hardly any display of emotion except through iron hard irony. The author does nothing to make Matti sympathetic or even remotely politically correct, in fact he is a former sympathiser with the quasi-Fascist Lappo movement, which conducted an armed revolt against the Finnish government in the early 1930s and was squashed by the regular army. However, by the outbreak of the Winter War practically all internal political disagreements among the Finnish population was put aside in favour of the common cause of keeping the Russians out of the country.

By choosing a main character of this particular kind Tuuri enhances his real message. The interesting thing about Matti is not so much himself as the story he has to tell, a story which is so strong it needs no dressing up or emotional outbursts of any kind. (An English translation of the novel exists but beware, there is at least one other novel out there with the same title) Matti's ultra matter-of-fact, almost cynical way of telling his story is reflected perfectly in the film version of the novel, for which Tuuri participated in the adaptation. There isn't an ounce of sentimentality and none is needed, because the horror and tragedy speaks for itself.

This is the kind of situation small nations and little people often end up in when the big ones decide to have a go at each other. Russia's attack on Finland was officially motivated by the ambition to force through a borderline adjustment that would create a buffer zone for the Red Army in case of a German attack that used Finland as a northern flank. But the Finns didn't feel like handing over vast amounts of productive territory, including the town of Viipuri (the second largest in Finland) in the Karelian Isthmus, and they thought that if they resisted a Russian attack they would be supported by, in particular, Britain. The League of Nations condemned the Russian attack and threw the country out of the assembly. Did they care? Not really. The British offered to send in troops through Lapland but this was really just an attempt to plant own forces in that area and thus cut off the supplies of crude iron from Kiruna in Sweden to Nazi-Germany, essential to the German war machine. Also England and, particularly, France were keen to move the seemingly coming and unavoidable war with Germany away from their own territories, in fact Churchill's prediction at the time was that WWII would be fought out in Northern Scandinavia. However, the Swedes refused Allied troops any kind of access into Lapland in order to maintain their own immensely profitable business adventure with Germany. In the middle of this sad mess of everyone doing what suited themselves best we find snow-covered Finnish trench lines thinly manned with young conscripts and recalled reservists, and a people willing to give anything, including their lives, to maintain their independence as a free nation.

This is really not a film for the tank-spotters or the guts-and-gore brigade, though I'm sure they'll be able to enjoy it very much for its realism and attention to detail. It is a fine work of art where the entire first hour or so has no fighting at all, just little humane stories about these civilians that are being put in uniforms (where such are available) and sent out to war. These chaps are not angels or supermen, they are just people. They are not ""proud Marines"" or ""Airborne"" or ""Commandos"", they are a citizen's army and couldn't give a monkey's whether someone sees them as ""heroes"" or not. There is no warrior worshiping or nauseating flag-waving in this film, no talk of making sacrifices and so on. The only relevant thing to these people is to keep the Russians from breaking through their lines and ruining their lives.

Luckily for the Finns, the Soviets completely underestimated the level of motivation among their enemy's troops and threw themselves into hopeless situations abundantly. Their strategy from the start was rigid and vastly miscalculated, and the film makes no attempt to hide this. There was nothing in the attack on Finland in 1939 that can be remotely compared to the kind of force with which Nazi Germany had invaded Poland in September the same year. Particularly, the use of armour and warplanes was comparatively limited, though it didn't exactly feel that way to the Finns, who had practically nothing of the kind themselves and hardly any means to withstand such attacks when they did take place. Hence the invention of the famous ""Molotov Cocktail"", as featured prominently in the movie.

The astonishing thing is that by making the Finnish soldier less mythical, this film and the novel it is based on only makes the Finnish resistance even more astonishing. These everyday chaps carried out a defense of their country which bordered on the impossible. Though the Russians inevitably won the war, they were shown very clearly that any attack on Finland would not be worth the casualties, whatever the outcome. What also happens during the telling of Matti's story is that he gradually becomes more and more sympathetic to the viewer or reader, as his inner ice melts and reveals itself as a simple survival mechanism.

We certainly get a sense of the kind of warfare and weapons involved, as well as the odds against the Finns.  The film is too long, probably due to the fact that, if I understand correctly, it originally aired as a television mini-series over multiple nights.  Perhaps the seemingly endless progression of battles is presented in the name of realism, but this IS a movie, after all, and we get the idea after the 7th or 8th ( or 11th or 12th? ) Russian charge.

The acting is tepid all 'round. No one really stands out as memorable.

Great equipment and lovely footage of the Finnish landscape.  Never could figure, though, why the Russians kept wasting artillery throughout the film chasing the featured character around the countryside.  Whenever a particular Finnish soldier was going toward or away from the front lines, the Russian artillery would magically always hit right around this one lone, poor soul.  Smart shells in 1939?  And Soviet aircraft dropping entire bomb loads trying to hit a soldier on a sleigh?  Not very believable.

Still, the battle scenes seemed well done and the unimaginative and very costly Soviet head-on assaults are true to history.  The vast disparity in men and materiel available to the two sides and the grinding exhaustion to which the Finns were subjected are important factors handled well.

All-in-all, a good movie but certainly not amongst the best of the genre. Most probably the best for the Winter War.",1279497600,10,1642,4.776595744680851

The movie spends the first third of it with the company and we get to know them and then we watch them slowly pay the ultimate price for freedom.
One memorable lines is when a soldier on leave is asked about the heroes of talian and he says"" the heroes of talian are all dead"".  This doesn't have any cgi effects and in spite of that it's still a good war movie. The real war would look much worse than this for sure. But you still get the idea generally of how bad it was.
The fins later went back to war with germany as their allie but it doesn't lesson the struggle for freedom that this movie honors.  The  picture looks good on this dvd and it has english subtitles. This is the longer version and is long enough to run over two discs. So you can watch part one and then go back and watch part 2 later. It's the length of a two part miniseries and it's worth your time if you want to at least get a taste of what the finnish army and people went through.",1276560000,7,1793,4.01123595505618

1236602,5,B00000JPH0,"I'd been putting off purchasing this movie, not really one to appreciate European cinema.  However, I can recommend The Winter War wholeheartedly!  This war story was classical David & Goliath, demonstrating the heroism of the outnumbered Finns and the rigid strategies of the Soviet war machine that resulted in terrible, senseless, slaughter, a universal trademark of the communists.  Weapons buffs will find a splendid buffet of rifles, automatic weapons, anti-tank cannons, armor and aircraft.
  The movie contained more than sufficient gore and dismemberment for anyone with a soul or conscience.  And, while the action was realistic enough to give the viewer a ""you are there"" feeling, the horror factor mercifully remained a notch lower than the screaming, traumatic violence of bloody combat you'll see in the early scenes of Saving Private Ryan.  And, that's okay.
  Thankfully absent were self-damning Hollywood-type anti-war platitudes.  War is never good, but when national survival is at stake, it's preferable to slavery.  No apologies are necessary, especially where the Finns are concerned.
  The Winter War is definitely NOT a B movie.  The characters, good and bad, were made real, as was the combat.  The photography is excellent.  The subtitles aren't a distraction.  I rate it five stars, because it simply is that good!",1264291200,10,1341,5.3701923076923075

First of all, if you must watch this movie, DO NOT get this uncut version.  I'm not sure what the 70 minutes were that got put back into this movie, but the movie is way too slow and long.  The first disc goes over halfway before we see any war action.  There's just lots of scenes of soldiers talking to each other.

The war scenes are ... flawed.  The actors don't act like soldiers, they act like actors, who have never handled weapons before.  Most of the battles are against hoards of Soviet soldiers launching themselves in these ""Hoorah!"" charges, often accompanied by these BT tanks.

The BT tanks do look pretty realistic, so the 2 stars are for the BT tanks.

What I couldn't figure out was how the Soviets lost these battles.  We see the Soviet forces vastly outnumber the Finns, we see them charging in large numbers right to the Finnish trenches, which are manned by only a few brave Finnish soldiers firing one shot at a time with these excruciatingly sluggish bolt action rifles (and the actors seem to struggle with them - surely these bolt actions were not that sticky and slow in real life?), as well as a few submachine guns.  Very little artillery or tripod mounted machine guns and no mortars with which to repel the Soviets.  The Soviet soldiers look like they are going to overwhelm the Finns,  and then miraculously, in a sharp cut to the next scene, the Finns are celebrating a victory.  Huh?  More missing minutes of film?

And it just went on and on like that.  Never could figure out the plot, nor who got killed and who still lived at the end of this film... and I didn't really care either.  Thank goodness for the fast forward button.",1263945600,12,1768,4.4890282131661445

M4 and GIs w/winter cami and the back cover of US troops moving in a rush might make you think you've got the wrong movie BUT it's Winter War, just a much longer version.

I've watched many war movies; some foreign but mostly American.  Many of the films were at best okay with even more simply Hollywood crap.

Winter War though is one of the best I've ever seen.  Any grunt, of any real Army can relate to what is happening in the film.  Military historians can appreciate the effort that went into this film too.  From the basic Swedish Mausers of the Finnish reservists, lack of uniforms, WW1 Chauchat light MGs to the Soviet infantry carrying Mosent Naugants in their peaked Budenney caps and dark greatcoats to the T26 tanks, I17 fighters, and armored cars--serious efforts were made to do justice to a story that Americans should learn.  The extended version adds more to the story, explaining the destinies of several characters who the earlier version left out.  There is also more of the universal bureaucratic mess of any Army, in this case the mess that the call-up was for many Finnish units.  There is also more detail in some of the fighting, much of it adding considerably to the overall movie itself.

The homefront intervals are bittersweet.  The scenes in the Church, the cameras panning across the crowds honoring their dead while praying for victory would not be shot in a Hollywood film, too unabashedly religious and patriotic.  The too fleeting moments together of families before the storm and on leave are well done too, not maudlin but touching.

The fighting scenes are awesome, no other word to describe the human wave attacks and bitter trench fighting.  The taking on of the light Russian armor with Molotov cocktails and tree trunks relate the desperation of the outgunned/numbered Finns.  For the Finns, their fighting abilities and dogged defense is complimented by the Soviet tactical incompetence.

A great movie, perhaps one of the best in gritty realism and storytelling.  I cannot praise it enough.  The Finns are justifiably proud of this period in their military history, it is an inspiring tale for anyone looking at real war.",1199750400,11,2285,4.8604651162790695

1236625,4,B00000JPH0,"Any work of art must address the three aspects of our psyche: Intellect, Appetites, Spirit.  This movie, unlike many others, addresses the entire psyche, and does so by weaving these three aspects through the soundtrack, the dialogue and of course the visual representation.  After the first viewing, the actual historical account is told and the psyche is no longer overburdened with the obvious.  Later viewings allow for a much more meaningful experience.  In this, I believe that the production staff have succeeded in their task.

Finland being the underdog, does successfully thwart the massive Russian attack.  Not being the aggressor and losing the advantage of first attack, Finland must respond to this attack of its country.  But it is not a superior technology, nor numbers that is responsible for this victory of sorts.  It is the spirit of man that allows for this page of World War II history to come alive, and if there is anything good from war, it is the ability for men and women to show the eternal and noble virtues within in each of us.

I was not born in Finland, but my parents were, and did raise me with more of a European background than Canadian.  With some grade school level Finnish fluency, I found the subtitles to be mildly off target, but then again, there might be some disagreement in my interpretation too.  While I would agree with other reviewers that sometimes it is difficult to read all of the subtitles, I am reminded by the fact that this movie was produced a number of years ago.  I think that the movie can hardly be held to critical review for technical issues that were resolved after its production.

There is a word in Finnish, SISU, which has no English counterpart or translation.  This movie while a wonderful rendering of this historic event, does in passing allow the non-Finnish speaking person a chance to understand what Finns mean by it.

An army reserve unit is mobilized to man the fortified Mannerhiem Line, in the early days of World War II. The characters express all the usual concerns about the coming ordeal...and then it happens. The Soviet Union launches a massive armored onslaught against Finland. Despite Finland's lack of manpower, equipment, and supplies, they devasted wave after wave of Russian assaults. Finland had better-trained soldiers, repelling hundreds of thousands of expendable communist conscripts. In the years before, wisely foreseeing the inevitable conflict with the communist power to the east, Finland had a series of fortifications built in advance, and the Finns utilized these to maximum effect!

1236627,4,B00000JPH0,"it is the business of the artist to follow it home to the heart of the individual fighters-not to talk in armies and nations and numbers-but to track it home.  D.H. Lawrence

The Russo-Finnish War, known as ""The Winter War"", began on November 30, 1939 when the Red Army invaded Finland.  The war began after the Finns refused demands from Stalin to move its borders 25 kilometers back from Leningrad.  The basis for this demand was the fear on the part of Stalin and the Soviet High Command that Hitler could launch an invasion of the USSR directed at Leningrad using Finland as a base for its attack.  The Winter War ended by means of a truce signed on March 12, 1940.  During this brief three-month war a Finnish army consisting of 180,000 men, most of them reservists waged a defensive battle against an advancing Soviet army of about 450,000 men.  Fighting from entrenched positions against full-frontal assaults resulted in the death of close to 23,000 Finnish soldiers.  At the same time more than 126,000 Soviet soldiers were killed or missing and another 264,000 were wounded.  This short war had a dramatic impact on the future course of the Second World War (the Winter War took place during the `phony war' period between the occupation of Poland and the commencement of Germany's invasion of France).  The horrifying losses suffered by the Red Army were a reflection of the chaos caused by purges of the military that practically eliminated every professional officer from the Red Army.  This vulnerability could only have encouraged Hitler in making his decision to invade the USSR in June 1941. Finnish film director Pekka Parikka's 1989 film ""The Winter War"" is an exceptionally well made movie about this little-known (at least to me) war. The film is not about armies fighting armies as much as it is about the individual fighters who, collectively, are called upon to wage war against an invading army.

Parikka's film follows the war through the eyes of a small platoon of reservists called up from their village to fight the war.  It begins with their mobilization and their trip to the front lines through three months of brutal and bloody fighting.  The film appears to be very accurate from a historic perspective.  The reservists are shown being issued incomplete, if any, uniforms, and finding gear and supplies when and if they can.  The Finns, lacking in anti-tank weaponry invented the Molotov Cocktail to use against Soviet mechanized divisions and the film shows these ad hoc weapons being used to great effect.  Particularly well done are the scenes that show the impact of the war on the rather stoic inhabitants of the platoon's village.

The Winter War is a straight-forward narrative of the war and how it was fought. It has a particular emphasis on the ugly reality of war.  It is not for the squeamish.  The film is not an examination of the souls or characters of the people that fought the war. This is true even of the principal actors.  The characters in the film are involved in fighting a war, they are not there to engage in discussions of the meaning of life.  However, I thought the film was very well done and certainly worth watching.  Those with an interest in war films generally or interested in well made films that cover corners of our history that is not overly familiar to them should find this a rewarding film to watch.  I've seen plenty of movies about the D-Day landings, the Battle of the Bulge, and the like.  This is the first film I've seen on the Russo-Finnish war.

A word about the price.  This DVD contains no extra features and is not in letterbox format.  Although it is an excellent movie I cannot advise anyone to buy it at the current list price of $45.00.  I purchased a new copy through an Amazon marketplace vendor and paid 1/3 of the list price.  At that price it is a 5-star film.  At the list price I think the viewer may feel that he has paid a bit too much. That is ultimately why I rated this film 4 stars and not 5.

1236648,5,B00000JPH0,"This movie is about as accurate a depiction of a historical event as you are going to find.  Despite what Mr. Kessel has to say, the portrayals of the Soviet soldiers as ""cardboard cutouts"" are authentic.  That is exactly the way the war was fought in Karelia.  The Soviet troops advanced in human waves, utterly indifferent to casualties.  Some Finnish soldiers collapsed from physical and psychological exhaustion after inflicting such horrendous casualties on the Russians in just one day of battle.  There were even instances of Russian soldiers being forced to link arms and set off across mine fields to clear them for the next wave of troops to come through.  As for the Mannerheim Line: Check your facts Sir.  The Mannerheim line did not get breeched until mid-February 1940 after two and a half months of relentless artillery and air bombardment and that with the Finns short of ammunition and anti-tank weapons.

As for the movie itself, a warning to those of you looking for an oscar winning tour de' force (God I hate that term) in the American sense; this movie is not for you.  It is very foreign in its presentation (and music) but that only enhances its authenticity instead of turning it into Enemy at the Gates, e.g.  Its not Englishmen or Yanks playing Russians and Germans but Finns playing Finns and Russians playing Russians.

Pekka Parikka's portrayal of battle was brutal and very believable.  Man against man, man against tank, hand to hand, in trenches, artillery bursts, strafing from the air, this movie has it all.

I am planning on buying and reading the non-fictional book, Talvisota, because the movie does not give much of a strategic view of the 120 day war. The movie is dedicated to the tactical side of the fighting, because that is what the typical Finn solider did (example - ""this is your trench, there is the enemy, NONE SHALL PASS!"") For overall descriptions of troop movements, and the reasons why the Soviet Army was turned away in stalemate at the end of the conflict, one needs to read a pure historical account.
PS If any small country in the World needs inspiration to fight off the military aggressions of a big bully, then this story is it!",1044316800,30,1161,4.668292682926829
1236668,1,B00000JPH0,"To make it short: The picture is very interesting, a must see for every war movie fan. Especially the fighting on the huge-scale sets including vintage russian armour (even a flamethrower tank is roaming the battlefield!) is VERY impressive.
However, the DVD edition from a company or label ""Belle and Blade"" is one of the worst I have ever seen. The picture quality is sub-VHS Standard, the sound in a flat stereo, the english subtitles are totally oversized and not removable, there are no extras at all - in one word, you'll get pure... for your hard-earned Euros (or Dollars). What a pity, the picture has deserved a decent relaese.
So, for the movie itself, I would say 4 out of 5 stars, for the DVD: None at all and a beating for the guys who are responsible for this mess...",1043280000,23,781,4.546099290780142
1236669,5,B00000JPH0,"Finn power to the extreme. Nobody can defeat the Finns not even the Russian Juggernaut. One of the greatest Finnish movies of all time! This is a must buy! Do yourself a favor and buy this film! I love the Finnish spoken in the film! SISU! What the other reveiwers fail to mention is that this is a true story! The Russians started the war and the Finns ended it.

1236670,4,B00000JPH0,"The Soviet Invasion of Finland is a part of World War 2 that most people outside of Finland know very little about. Most history books give little more than one or two paragraphs to the subject and perhaps a photo of white clad ski troops. Although the ski troops fought courageosly, their action took place mainly in the central and northern parts of Finland near the Soviet-Finnish border and involved small units who took on much larger (and much more heavily armed) Soviet units, trapped and then systematically destroyed them.
This film does not deal with the ski troops but rather focuses on actions that took place in the south on the Karelian Isthmus. This is where the bulk of the Finnish Army was deployed and the battles that took place in many cases were reminiscent of World War 1 style massed infantry attacks. The film focuses mainly on the experiences of a small group of Finnish Army reservists. Being part time soldiers from the same geographic region they display an easy and informal familiarity with their officers and senior NCOs. This movie starts out a bit slow but the tension builds as the political situation deteriorates and the reservists (now mobilised) are left to wonder about what is to come, discussing rumours, worried but determined to stand up to the Soviets despite being vastly outnumbered.
The film is in Finnish with English sub titles which sometimes are not totally accurate but are still understandable.
Don't expect a big budget Hollywood production similar to ""Saving Private Ryan"", but watch this movie with an open mind. It's well worth it.",1042416000,5,1588,4.907063197026022
1236671,3,B00000JPH0,"I bought this DVD after stumbling across the glowing reviews of the movie. I'm not Finnish but my wife is of Finnish descent so I thought it would make a nice addition to our DVD collection.
The DVD itself is pretty much barren of any extras. There are no trailers, no commentary, no different sound tracks...no anything but the movie itself and scene selections. The disc is only in Stereo, so if you're looking for Dolby Digital 5.1, you're out of luck with this release. Additionally, the film transfer is fairly grainy. Considering the movie only 13 years old, they could've done a better job.
On to to the movie itself - It's a classic example of a David and Goliath story. A handful of Finnish soldiers defend their country against a horde of tens of thousands (maybe hundreds of thousands - they never really say) of Russian troops.
The disappointing thing about this movie is that the tacticts of how the Finnish defended against such incredible odds are never really shown. It was a simply a matter of holding position as long as possible against the advancing Russian soldiers. I would like to have seen more of what strategy was involved in holding off the Russians. Matter of fact, if I didn't know it was a true story I would have a hard time believing it.  One thing to note, as others have noted - Talvisota is not for the squeamish. The depiction of what can happen to a human body during a war is, I would guess, fairly realistic and might even be a little disturbing to those with a weak stomach.
All-in-all, I give the movie 3 out of 5. It was good...but it wasn't great.",1037836800,3,1590,4.501730103806229
1236672,5,B00000JPH0,"Indeed! When the Soviet juggernaut attacked tiny Finland, democracy itself was under attack. And the United States and Britain stood by and pledged ""moral support""! Shame, shame on us and all the reason to obtain this little known film and watch it with our heads hung low.
Just a correction though. Finnish males between the ages of 17 and 25 are required to serve 6-11 months. Nobody is actually required to keep guns and the gun control laws in Finland are relatively strict. But if guns were ever needed in the hands of law-abiding citizens, that was the time.

Watch especially for the 'good bye' scene at the railway station to get a sense of the undemonstrative Finnish mind-set. This movie is comparable in impact to Saving Private Ryan --  at 1/100th of the production cost.  A real gem!",1023667200,7,344,4.7
1236675,5,B00000JPH0,"The Winter War is the most historically accurate and realistic war film I have seen.  During the film, we follow the lives of a small group of friends as they find themselves in the frontlines facing a soviet invasion.  All aspects of the movie are well conceived and finely filmed.  The best aspect of the Winter War, however, is the fact that there are no underlying subplots.  Unlike Saving Private Ryan (which I must admit I also thought was excellent), the characters do not spend the movie attempting to accomplish an unlikely (albeit intellectually satisfying) objective.  Rather, the characters try to stay alive, protect their friends, and follow orders as real soldiers might.
Another very compelling aspect of the film is it's historical accuracy.  Tactics and equipment all correspond to those employed by Russia and Finland in 1939.  T-26 tanks, I-16 fighters, and human wave attacks fill out the Russian Arsenal, while the Fins remain on the defensive aside from local counter attacks.  Adding to the realism is the fact that much of movie is filmed in a limited geographic area.  This allows the viewer to become familiar with local terrain features in a way that few other films permit.  Hence, the viewer begins to sense the directions from which attacks might come and beings to get a feeling of what constitutes a ""Full-scale Attack,"" a ""Probe,"" etc.
Overall, I would highly recommend the Winter War to anyone who enjoys war films or who is interested in Military History.  Due to the lack of subplots, however, people simply looking for an action film or for a simple diversion are likely to be disappointed.",1013817600,205,1628,4.926739926739927
1236676,5,B00000JPH0,"as far as military movies go, the winter war is as good as it gets. the movie hardley misses a point. the action scenes are great and (imagine this) historically accurate! the combination really develops. the smallarms, vehicles, fighters and bombers were all loaned from a museum in russia and the tactics were re-inacted  from the actual russo-finish war veterans on both sides. be right there in the trenches as you get strafed by fighters, shelled from artillery and fired at by snipers. you hardly want to look down to read the subtitles as you may miss the action (incidentially, there is a finnish-only version approximately 1 hour longer in length). 100% accurately depicted and well acted. highly recomended from a hard sell military buff.don't wait to buy it used, it's worth every cent brand new and if you liked it as much as i did, you'll wear it out anyway.",1011916800,5,871,4.768211920529802
7913177,5,B00000JPH0,"Talvisota , my favorite Finnish war film, exposes many facets of the Winter War that began in 1939 with The Soviets wanting to take for themselves more land from ""The Fighting Finns."" Vastly outmanned and outgunned , The Finnish Soldiers put up a fierce resistance against The Red Army. The director succeeds in allowing the viewer to intimately know several Finnish soldiers; Marti, his brother Paavo, Jussi, the medic and others. Their thoughts and emotions are obvious to the viewer in many scenes. Battle scenes are ferocious and graphic; the attacking Soviets are relentless in their assaults on the Finnish lines. But the Finns prevail. An excellent war film.",1523232000,,665,5.110091743119266

The picture quality left a lot to be desired & there was no extras which i always enjoy watching so i always hoped it would be remastered and released on a Blu-Ray DVD. Well the wait is over & it was worth it! It's incredible! It' been renastered in 24 -K but u don't need a 24-K player to play it.& it plays perfectly on my Samsung Blur-Ray player! The picture details & color are super sharp so now i can see what i've been missing all this time! It's the 3 hour & 7minute full lenght version in all it's glory. Some think the film is too long but i disagree. The battle scenes are intense and very graphic,moreso than PVT.RYAN & extremely realistic. It also has many worthwhile & informative extras which add even more to the film. The subtitles are very easy to read as well. Don't let the higher than usual price keep you you fron purching this disc. It's well worth evey dollar for sure. May i add the acting is very good too.
