866766,5,6304416415,"HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS is one of the better Disney, live-action films out there. It's original and unique - followed by two [HONEY, I BLEW UP THE KID and HONEY, WE SHRUNK OURSELVES] just as good sequels. This film is about a wacky scientist named Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) who knows all about science and nothing about family or the ""real world"". When Wayne creates a shrinking machine, in hopes that it will shrink matter, it actually ends up shrinking his kids, Amy and Nicky (Amy O'Neill and Robert Oliveri), and his next door neighbor's kids, Russell and Ron Thompson (Thomas Wilson Brown and Jared Rushton). They escape from the trash bag and end up entering what appears to be a jungle but is actually the Szalinskis' own backyard! Now, just a few inches tall, the kids must find a way to get to the house and get their parents' attention so they can deshrink them and turn them back to their normal sizes.
This is a very funny comedy, and there are some excellent visual effects, too. Everything from the shrunk kids to riding on a flying bee - there is some truly amazing special effects. The plot is solid and so is the acting. This is one Disney comedy I recommend for every family!",997488000,4,1199,4.529953917050691
866767,5,6304416415,"Honey, I Shrunk The Kids was a very tripped out movie. It had an extremely quriky atmosphere. It is disguised as a family movie, yet below it's packaging is a truly twisted, horror movie. From the excellent yet dark animated opening sequence, to the mad scientist music score, to the subtle oddities (Wayne picking up the phone and telling Quark it's not for him, stepping on the grass and looking at his shoe), this movie has such a Tim Burtonian style, you'd swear it was him directing. A dead-on reflection of midwestern suburbia. One of the eeriest kids movies ever. Highly recommended.",996969600,,590,4.794117647058823
866768,5,6304416415,"Wayne Szalinski is convinced he has figured out a way to shrink the size of matter.  It works great on paper, but he can't make it work in real life.  While he's at a conference presenting his ideas, the machine accidentally shrinks his and his neighbor's kids.  When they get thrown out with the trash, they must journey across the backyard, avoiding bugs, sprinklers, and lawnmowers.  Meanwhile, Wayne and his wife try to fix the machine and find the kids.  Will they find them before it's too late?  Can Wayne figure out how to make the machine work to reverse the process?
This is one of my favorite movies.  It combines a great story and great characters with great special effects.  All the characters grow because of their experiences, even both sets of parents.  The special effects still hold up today, and are there to tell the story, not the other way around.  The story moves effortlessly from comedy to drama and back again.
It's a shame that there aren't more movies like this.  Gather the entire family together and enjoy a great family film.",994377600,15,1057,4.65945945945946
866769,5,6304416415,"Having this video for about twelve years, I hadn't watched it since recently, and I just had to write a review on it. This movie is a intriguing blend of comedy, science fiction, fantasy, and a bit of romance (when Amy falls for Russell). This movie also shows unique views like what the grass and floors are like when you're 1/4 of an inch tall and teamwork between the neighbors and what Moranis does to look for his kids. Entertaining, and I enjoy watching every bit of it. Rated PG for peril and mild violence.",983577600,,514,4.421052631578948

The first one regarding the ""home phone"" with the extra long cord. I don't think she has ever seen a home phone. The second, regarding the record player playing a vinyl... She was wondering what it was.
My wife and I also enjoyed watching it with her. Good times!

Though they are dated, they're some of the best the screen has to offer. I'm surprised Disney hasn't offered up a Blu-Ray release for this one and Honey, I Blew Up the Kid. Both movies deserve to be seen in high definition. The DVD release is okay. The full frame transfer isn't too terrible. Some shots look great. Pretty much all the special effects shots look very grainy and stand out horribly, with the only exception being the sequence with the bee, which looks pretty decent. But still, I'd rather watch that on on Blu-Ray with a big screen TV instead of a choppy full frame image. Come on, Disney. Honey I Shrunk the Kids was at the time your most successful live action movie long before Pirates of the Caribbean and it doesn't get a spectacular Blu-Ray release like the Pirates movies did?! UGH! Please get this one and Honey, I Blew Up the kid out in hi-def!",1453593600,,992,4.367567567567567

869226,1,6304416415,"Honey i shrunk the kids, classic film from 1989
the special effects are Ground breaking for that time period, still before major computer Digital effects were in full effect
alot of the effects were still done optically, meaning the insects in the film full scale Animatronic robotic creatures
and still alot of camera tricks, especially when the kids shrunk to about 1inch in height
the film after all these years deserves a blu-ray release if it ever gets one,
Long overdue for a blu-ray release in widescreen format aswell
this U.S. DVD version is only in 1:33:1 Fullscreen format only & guess what no extras except for theatrical trailer
and the picture quality is average to still lots of grain and dirt in the quality
but what annoys me more is the screen is only 1:33:1, Disgusting effort that's for sure
regions 2 & 4 U.K. & AUS DVD versions are 1:85:1 ratio with 5.1 surround sound
until a new blu-ray reissue comes long
your better to buy the U.K. DVD or AUS DVD which are both in 1:85:1 ratio",1442534400,3,1003,4.5777777777777775

However, this movie might teach your kids the wrong lessons about workplace safety: why did he have the tip of the shrink gun aimed at the door? If this were a shotgun, would he set it up aimed at the door? And shouldn't there have been a lock on the lab door, in addition to the ""Do not enter"" sign (which in childese means ""Hey, cool stuff inside!"")?",1442102400,,491,4.455555555555556

His experiment becomes a successful-failure in that the machine finally works, but it shrunk his kids. The children wind up in the garbage, then eventually outside. Now, at the tiny size they have become, Survival is the name of the game, and of course top priority.

Once the children are a tiny size, the movie turns into an adventure, and you can't wait to find out how it ends. The entire cast gave a Superb acting performance, and there were many funny moments, as well as suspenseful events.

This is a family movie that children love, and enjoy. Very entertaining, and highly recommended!",1421020800,,774,4.725925925925926

The very day we got it we popped it in. The kids LOVED it. They thought it was so cool. Especially when the two boys are riding on the bee. There were a lot of cool spots that I didn't even remember.

I recently watched it just to take a trip down memory lane, and watched it on my 8.9 inch kindle screen. You know what? The movie is immune to time. It is a classic pure and simple. Even now, I was just as enthralled and enchanted by this simple and adventuresome fairytale as I had been as a child when the bridge between fantasy and reality had not yet been absolved by the harshness of life.

871610,4,6304416415,"The only reason my favorite movie from my childhood gets a star less is because this version is represented in full screen and actually cuts off some of the peripheral content because of the transfer from VHS to DVD.  This version is also not in HD or Blu-Ray so your wider screen TVs will more than likely fuzz the details a little.  However, unlike some reviews, this does not ruin the movie which is, by far, a cult classic of the Rick Moranis generation and for kids that grew up during the time.

Rick Moranis plays an inventor with two kids next to the polar opposite family next door, also with two kids.  When a freak baseball accident gets Wayne's (Moranis) shrinking machine to work, it also accidentally fires off and shrinks a chair, a couch, and the four kids.  They get displaced by Wayne cleaning up the area after taking his aggressions on his supposedly not working machine.  This displacement puts them in a trash bag at the other end of the backyard.  The four kids have to depend on each other to cross the equivalent of 3.1 miles where blades of grass are the size of trees, butterflies have a wingspan of over 40 feet, and water droplets become hazards.

This movie was the surprise hit of the summer of 1989, holding its own at the box office against Tim Burton's ""Batman"", a movie with pre-release hype that has yet to be matched, released on the same day. It has gotten almost unanimous positive reviews and has a title memorable even to those who did not see it. Disney milked it for all it was worth with theme park attractions related to it and behind-the-scenes videos on the Disney Channel, yet for some reason the Mouse House has not given ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" a decent DVD or Blu Ray release. The DVD is watchable for the clarity--it's better than what we would have seen on VHS and the same aspect ratio as a TV airing--but we like DVD for better clarity and to see a film in its original aspect ratio, as well as for extras like commentary tracks and retrospectives.  I'm hesitant to rent it through Amazon Instant Video, but with catalog films becoming less likely to get printed on discs, I'm thinking this is the best presentation we will see.",1388275200,,1025,4.452127659574468

I loved this movie as a kid so I decided to buy it at the Black Friday price of $3.99 and while it is probably still a good value for what it is, I was disappointed at how cheep the packaging of the DVD case was where the DVD does not snap in securely and it rattles a bit when you hold it. The DVD also has NO special features and is simply the movie in DVD where you can hit play. My copy was the US version though compared to what some people seem to have said and did play fine in my PS3.

I love the set work they did for the movie, the tall blades of grass, the large cookie and the indoor floor set. The rain drops sequence was pretty awesome as well. The child actors weren't too terribly annoying but the forced love thing in any youth/teen movie always irritated me... still does.

I'm pretty sure we watched them- they were good movies-- but for some reason, we never returned them. We must have simply forgotten. Regardless, for years after, my cousins (usually the eldest, who was my age) would ""joke"" with us/me during family get-to-gethers ""when we were gonna return King Ralph and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"". Finally, after YEARS of this, I got the funny idea in my head that'd it'd be GREAT to get both VHS copies (not DVD, that would ruin the 'joke') and present both to them, wrapped, on X-mas day, when we got together for Chinese food (our annual tradition). But where would I locate VHS copies of both films, you might ask? This is where Amazon came in. Luckily, both Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and King Ralph were available via Amazon. A few days later, I had the tapes. I wrapped them up together, and presented them as a gift for the cousins on Xmas day. Included was a card stating ""Sorry it took so long to return these.

872759,5,6304416415,"In the Summer of 1989, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids(1989) played in movie theaters while I was forced to spend time at a family member's house as my mom worked. Life threw me a bone when my mom's friend rented it on VHS and treated us all to ice cream in 1990. Local TV stations showed the film during Thanksgiving in the late 1990's. I would enjoy the film with a plate of turkey, mashed potatoes, and stuffing. ILM special effects artist Joe Johnston directs Honey, I Shrunk the Kids(1989). This sci-fi-family-comedy is an homage to sci-fi B movies such as The Incredible Shrinking Man and The Amazing Colossal Man. Rick Moranis plays Wayne Szalinski, an eccentric inventor who creates a machine that shrinks ojbects.
Szalinski's children and two boys from next door are accidentally exposed to the shrinking ray and reduced to a 1/4 inch high!
The kids struggle to get back inside the house and restored to their normal size. They're attacked by bees, scorpions, and lawnmowers. They also make friends with a baby ant.
 James Horner(Battle Beyond the Stars, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Krull) composed the music score for the film. Matt Frewer(Supergirl, Max Headroom) is quite good as Wayne's macho neighbor, Russ. The dog who plays Quark gives an earnest performance. The special effects are superb and they were crafted before CGI dominated Hollywood movie making. Marcia Strassman plays Wayne Szalinski's wife, Diane. She's the ""honey"" in the title. Amy O' Neill is lovely and charming as Wayne's daughter...Amy. Robert Oliveri is convincing as Wayne's intelligent son, Nick. He also acted in Edward Scissorhands(1990).
Thomas Wilson Brown and Jared Rushton play Russ' kids. Horner's music score has an homage to Raymond Scott's Powerhouse B tune. The scene where the baby ant is killed by a scorpion is one of the most ""tearjerking"" scenes that I've ever seen in a movie! This film spawned two sequels, a campy TV show, and a theme park attraction called Honey, I Shrunk the Audience. It was spoofed on The Critic(""Honey, I Laminated the Kids""). Honey, I Shrunk the Kids(1989) is fun and it's a Disney movie that kids and adults can enjoy.",1309564800,,2148,4.884931506849315

872761,1,6304416415,"There is one thing you must know. This is a HORROR MOVIE!  Yes, it is a classic. Problem is it is just as scary as it is famous. Oh, sure it might sound funny or cute at first, but there is more to a movie than fame and a funny title. I must be truthful. This movie is very freaky, nightmarish and dull. The special effects are  too high-tech, and there are many scenes that will scare children: 4 kids are accidentally shrunk to 1/4 inch tall thrown out with the garbage. Now in the backyard they face one  terrifying danger after another. people walk trough the yard and almost squash them. one girl falls in to a mud puddle and nearly drowns. one boy almost gets carried away by a bumble bee. Worse of all, they almost get killed by a lawnmower, and when finally back inside, one boy almost gets eaten in a spoonful of Cheerios by his own dad!. These are only a few of the of the horrifying, scary scenes in this movie! I am 20, and this movie freaks me out,so it will certainly freak out young children.
 If you want a science-fiction, action packed triller movie that is funny and child-friendly, try the sequels!
 After all, Some things take more than one try to get  just right, and may not be perfect the first time round. But will get better the 2nd  and 3rd time round!",1298764800,3,1279,4.260330578512397

872763,3,6304416415,"Honey, I Shrunk The Kids doesn't exactly hold up, but it's still pretty fun. The special effects, which are the strongest elements in the film, are stunning to watch and they really help with the story (which is pretty weak at times). There are plenty of silly moments and some impressive sets and effects shots. The music is also good. However, there are two problems I have with this movie. One is that the kid characters are terribly dull. They was nothing distinctive or interesting about them. The other flaw I find in this movie is that the journeys that the kids take when they're tiny aren't very adventurous. I mean, the adventures aren't very imaginative. It's not really exciting to see this kids wandering around in the grass. It would have been better if they had taken a journey outside of the neighborhood.

Still, HISTK is fun, and it has some swell special effects. It's not a great movie, but it certainly isn't a bad one, either.

872806,5,6304416415,"I saw this when it first came into theatres back in the summer of '89 (OMG, has it already been 20 yrs. since it came out??). During a summer of blockbusters (""Batman"", ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"", ""Ghostbusters 2""), I was impressed with the scope & creativity of this seemingly small film (no pun intended) which held its own admirably against the other box office juggernauts. Seeing it now, the special effects seem pretty artificial in comparison to the miracle-working CGI stuff today. No matter; it's the imaginative script & acting talent onscreen that's the real deal. Rick Moranis brings his own goofy comedic charm to the role of inventor Wayne Szalinski, who's created a shrink ray machine; trouble is, he can't quite figure out how to perfect it. That is, until a baseball whacked through the upstairs cellar window somehow solves the laser's problems & activates the machine as it randomly shrinks objects such as the furniture. The focus shifts back & forth between the Szalinski family & their neighbors, the Thompsons, headed by thick-headed matriarch Matt Frewer (yep, Max Headroom himself). The ""baseball"" altercation brings the Szalinski & Thompson kids together in the cellar...conveniently in range for the machine to shrink them. Being the preoccupied inventor that he is, Wayne tidily sweeps the kids up, bags them, and drops them off just outside the back yard. Thus, the film presents its main conflict: the kids need to get back to the house; except now, they face the insurmountable task of crossing the yard which has now become a miles-long jungle of giant blades of grass & giant flowers. It's here where the film really excels on imagination as the kids encounter bees, giant cookies, lawn mowers, toys & even make a lone ant a ""pet"". Finally, Wayne realizes what happened to the kids (and what he's done) & has to break the news to his wife (Marcia Strassman, resurfacing after TV's ""Welcome Back, Kotter""). And so, the Thompson parents watch in dumbfounded awe & comment on ""how weird the Szalinski's are"" as Wayne & wife use bizarre contraptions to search for the kids without treading on the lawn. Eventually, through all kinds of unusual obstacles, the kids do make it back into the house, Wayne restores them back to normal size, and the neighbors, through this strange ordeal, actually become ""good"" neighbors.
I was rather disappointed that Disney didn't bother to create some DVD extras--at least a ""making of"" featurette--considering this was one of its biggest live-action hits. Guess I'll settle on the happiness of actually owning this little gem of a special effects comedy.",1265500800,,2628,5.002283105022831

When the kid next door hits a baseball through the window and it lands in the path of the machine's laser, it begins working. Wayne's two kids plus the two kids next door end up becoming tiny. Wayne accidentally sweeps them up and puts them out with the garbage, so the kids then have to travel through the thick grass back to the house, while braving giant bugs, sprinklers and a lawn mower. This is a fun movie for the entire family. Well, of course, it's ridiculous but the kids will love it and you can laugh right along with them.",1264723200,,653,4.404958677685951

Inventor Wayne is having trouble with his shrinking machien that seems to blow things up until a neighbor boy hits a bseball through the attic wiindow, which lands in an area where the machine's beam pierces it, and suddenly objects become tiny, including both familes' sons and daughters. Thus begins a wild trek across the backyard encountering huge butterflies, bees, an ant and a scorpion. Both sets of parents fantically search for their children, unaware until later what has happened to them. Now Wayne, who had smashed his shrinking machine before knowing what it had accomplished, now has to put it back together so he can return the children to full size. The four kids try out a number of ways to get home, such as trying to hitch a ride on the family dog.

Just the fact that you'd have plenty of obstacles to avoid would make it all the more challenging and adventurous.

That's exactly what happens in the film- the tiny kids have to walk through tall grass and other objects just to make it back to the house.  It's awesome.

Quite the feat, considering it's relatively obscure cast (well, compared to the afforementioned films.)
The movie starts out with a nice animation sequence that looks as good now as it did 13 years ago. The live action starts as a typical Saturday morning in suburbia at the Szalinski's house, except that Wayne (Rick Moranis) is a bumbling inventor who built a shrinking ray in his attic that he can't get to work, his son (Robert Oliveri) is a mirror-image. And the daughter (Amy O'Neill) is pretty much your typical Blond teenager [a good looking one at that ;)] who hopes she gets asked to the dance. The mother, Diane Szalinski, played by Marcia Strassman (of Welcome Back, Kotter fame) does a good job as well. Cork, the family dog also deserves mentioning.
Next door are the All-American Thompsons, who have big plans for a weekend fishing trip. Their oldest son Russ Jr. (Thomas Wilson Brown) is less than enthusiastic about those plans. He's a bit scrawny for his age and Big Russ has expectations to see him excel at High School football, which isn't Little Russ's Niche. Meanwhile younger son Ron Thompson (Jared Rushton) is the apple of Big Russ's eye, and can be quite mischievous at times, setting up a booby trap that his dad walks into.
The underrated Matt Frewer steals the show as Big Russ Thompson, Brash and Sarcastic (in a good way of course). And providing the perfect compliment is his wife, the calmer Mae Thompson (played by Kristine Sutherland).
The backstory is this:Ron Thompson hits a baseball into the Szalinskis attic, in turn setting off the shrinking machine (which hadn't worked until that point) and in their effort to retrieve the ball, Ron and Nick get zapped and are 1/4 inch tall, Amy and Russ Jr., who walk up to the attic wondering what happened to them, meet a similar fate. Wayne returns home from a dismal day at work, having been made a laughing stock because of his lack of proof for the shrinking machine. He takes his frustration out on the machine itself, severely damaging it in the process, he sweeps the broken parts (and the four kids) off the floor and into the trash bag. He then takes it out across the yard, and the kids are, as Nick eloquently says ""We're now a quarter of an inch tall, and sixty four feet from the house. That's an equivalent of three-point-two miles. That's a long way. Even for a man of science."" Even more of a trek considering the extra thick grass they must walk through.
En route the gang faces Swarms of bees and scorpions [among other obstacles that I won't give away;)]. There's decent use of special effects and, even if they may look a bit fake, it's still entertaining nonetheless. I'll end my description here, as anything more would spoil the film.
If this review doesn't entice you to check out ""Honey, I shrunk the kids"", I don't know what will. It's a classic in my opinion.",1051056000,2,3065,4.6464088397790055

Disney's choice of the aspect ratio 1:33:1 release has cheated these films' directors in that the widescreen anamorphic format is how the director intended us to see it.

In summer 1989, this worldly-weird movie bursted onto the screen by Disney, with the audience expecting another blockbuster hit like the previous summer's ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"". Include that with the rave reviews recieved, the great idea and Rick Moranis (very big at the time), and the audience flocked to the theaters announcing ""1 for Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"". Yet, people used to mix it up like, ""I Shrunk the Kids"" or ""Honey, I Shrunk"" or even (I heard this one myself) ""Honey Shrunk Kids"". Soon enough, ""Honey, I..."" was a household phrase. Just because of this movie. What was so good and wonderful, and yet quirky and weird about this movie? Read on...
MOVIE
...continuing on, here's a brief, yet spefic description: When a baseball from the neighbor kid enables Wayne Syzlinski's shrinking machine to work, Amy and Nick Syzlinski and with the neighbor kids. To the kid's unfortune luck, they are stuck in the rear of the backyard, and need to walk about five miles (which is actually not that long, it will only take you about three hours, but it is a backyard full of dangers) to get back home. Throughout, romance blossoms between Russel and Amy, they ride bees (at the time, the response was the same as the door vault scene in 2001's Monsters Inc: Make a Disney ride out of it!), avoid huge water droplets from sprinklers, dangerous scorpions and huge forgotton toys, and don't forget the horrible world under the grass (which A Bug's Life gave us a second helping of nine years later).
REVIEW OF MOVIE
This movie has got to be the greatest display of how trippy the live-action movies of the late 80s were. Watch the first 30 minutes, complete with a completely-80s animated opening sequence (which gave a first look into computer graphics and hand-drawn animation combined). But, later, the very quirky mad scientist score and trippy idea gets on you...until the scorpion and Russel kissing Amy...it gets pretty trippy again. Just until the kids almost get eaten (yes, the Cherrios-ad scene) the movie's a weird experience. If you happen to take a trip to Disney/MGM Studios at Walt Disney World, the HISTK playground gives you exactly what this movie was like. But, this movie is wonderful, a great experience for all...",1034294400,,2254,4.857142857142857
873037,5,6304416415,"The story is about an inventor Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) who is trying to perfect his machine which, when working, will shrink matter. The problem is, nothing he does seems to make it work. But somehow, his kids Amy and Nicky (Amy O'Neill and Robert Oliveri), and his next door neighbor's kids, Russell and Ron Thompson (Thomas Wilson Brown and Jared Rushton) are shrunk! Being only a few inches tall, they end up in the garbage bag and are taken outside. They get out but the only way back to the house is through the Szalinski's front yard. They meet up with a friendly ant, a killer scorpion, the danger of being chopped up by a lawnmower, and being drowned by a water sprinkler. Will they make it home so they can be made back to their normal size?
This movie is just GREAT! Even though it's a kids movie, it's great for adults, too. I love to watch this movie with my parents. I especially love Robert Oliveri and Jared Rushton.
