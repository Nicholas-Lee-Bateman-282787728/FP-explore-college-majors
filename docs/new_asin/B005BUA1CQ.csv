4647769,5,B005BUA1CQ,"I've never seen the Casper the friendly ghost cartoons before. I haven't existed yet when it showed. The most that I've seen was a few seconds of one episode where Wendy used her wand when I was three or four years old and at a barber's place when me and my dad was waiting for a chair by the table where the magazines were and among them was one or two Casper comics where I saw a drawing of Casper in stipple lines as an indication of him being invisible, also when I was about four to six years old and that's all. You can't compare Marvel and DC's superhero comics and cartoons with these cartoons and comics. These cartoons and comics have no violence of anykind and sci-fi stuff like the existence of superpowers and creations of monsters with superpowers and a single big superhero with some kind of secret identity and a ridiculous costume that suddenly appears out of nowhere and comes to the rescue for all the people in an entire city. These Casper shows and books are like all the Disney shorts and Tom and Jerry shorts. It's for all to enjoy. Those were the cartoons that was made by professionals who knew where the line was drawn and none of them even thought once of coming up with those violent above and beyond natural possibilities. I ordered the complete collection of 1945-1963 and I enjoyed them all very much. I'm 33 and I never get tired of such cartoon shows nomatter how many times I watch them. I'll always watch these shows because I enjoy and love them. This is a true 100% 5 star must have product.",1348099200,2,1528,4.402826855123675

4647772,5,B005BUA1CQ,"Ever since I was a kid, I have always liked cartoons, like the ones here. Casper the Friendly Ghost is one those excellent old cartoons that I could not miss! It is an instant hit and classic with me! No, I am not a kid anymore, but I am a sucker for the old cartoons, especially now that they are on DVD Collection Sets!",1335139200,7,321,4.03125
4647773,4,B005BUA1CQ,"I have fond memories of Casper.  These videos look and sound great.  Compared to other cartoons of any era, they hold up as masterpieces, but,

The first episode starts with Casper being sad because he doesn't having any friends, tying a rope attached to a rock around his neck, and throwing the rock and himself off the dock.  In a later episode a skunk also tries to kill himself for similar reasons.  I have only seen about six episodes so far, so I have no idea how many suicide attempts are on these DVDs.

Long story short be careful if you're buying this to show to children.  Watch it yourself first and you can decide if it's appropriate and be ready to answer some questions.",1333324800,9,685,4.432
4647774,5,B005BUA1CQ,I can't believe that it's the complete Casper the ghost series on DVD. Shout Factory did a great job on this little gem and it's well worth the price !,1326758400,13,151,4.066666666666666
4647775,5,B005BUA1CQ,"I was a big fan of Casper growing up and was highly anticipating this release, though I did so with trepidation as it seems there are some child-hood favorites that I re-visited as an adult that lost their magic. Luckily, this was not the case with Casper.

The artwork is absolutely beautiful in the early to mid 50s cartoons and though Casper could be cheesy at times, the cartoons still retain their warmth and happiness. It was fun to see the New Casper Cartoon openings which I remembered from my childhood. I'm really glad the booklet was included chock full of great Casper trivia and history.

I showed my five-year old nephew some of the cartoons and it seems that Casper has found a new fan!

Definitely recommend this to anyone of any age!",1319414400,29,750,4.582089552238806
4647776,5,B005BUA1CQ,"I have been looking for all 26 episodes from the 1963 ""Casper new cartoon show"" for a good 10 years.  I love that all 26 are on one dvd. Thank you so much for releasing this!",1318723200,29,174,3.8333333333333335
4647777,5,B005BUA1CQ,What Mark said....is good enough for me :  Will be happy to see the 1963 opening and close again!  Glad to have all the CASPERS in a nice packaging like this :),1318032000,17,160,3.96875
4647778,5,B005BUA1CQ,"So I received my advanced copy of the ""Casper"" DVD that I did commentaries and interviews for. Overall, I give the set high marks with some minor quibbles that I had no control over.

On the plus side, the set looks good. There are two slimline case clamshells; one featuring the two theatrical discs and the third disc in its own case features all of the ""New Casper Cartoon Show"" episodes.

The 20-page full-color booklet looks fantastic and of course, it was written by yours truly, so it is crammed with tons of information including where every episode appears in comic books, when applicable.

The first three Casper cartoons that are now in the public domain are actually featured as bonus features of disc one. There are 10 commentaries strewn throughout. All feature me with three of them with Edmee Reit (widow of Sy), three of them with Bradley Bolke and three of them with Alison Arngrim (daughter of Norma MacMillan).

I first saw the 15+ minute documentary in Oregon and was upset that I looked so ""zombie-like"", but after re-watching it a second time, it's not too bad, but I still come across as a bit dull in comparison with the animated Alison, who makes the documentary fun!

The commentaries are generally pretty good, considering that I had never done anything like this before, and recorded everything in a marathon 10-hour session in my home.

They DID get the ""New Casper Cartoon Show"" opening and closing in color which I begged them to do, and got MOST of the individual episode openings where Casper and friends zip in to watch a cartoon in a TV cloud.

Now, for the negatives. Even though I begged them to go back to Paramount to get the original cartoons for the original elements and credits, it just wasn't or couldn't be done. As a result, the Harveytoons opening is used and even ""The Harveytoon Show"" opening is used in a couple of cases. And on the public domain cartoons, the Paramount logos are used, but in one case the UM&M openings are used.

HOWEVER, if you use that above criteria to NOT buy the set, you will be missing out, because this is the most comprehensive set of Casper cartoons that has ever been issued and probably ever will be issued. It has the ONLY appearance of ""The Bored Billionaire"" EVER on home video AND is the only set that has all of the Casper cartoons in one place; a feat that will probably not be repeated any time soon.

As a result, you can literally toss out any previous Casper DVD collections, as this definitely takes the place of those sets. The Casper DVD from Shout Factory is due to be released on October 11.",1316563200,112,2588,4.572354211663067

4647829,5,B005BUA1CQ,"Casper the Friendly Ghost was always one of my favorites (along with Ritchie Rich) when I was just a kid.

However - I had never seen his first Toon - his origin story if you will!

It's actually quite cute! I have watched about 75% of this with the picture being pristine and the sound nearly so. It's interesting to watch his personality develop over more than 75 years. He was developed as a character in a book (a 1939 children's storybook). His first Toon was in 1946 in The Friendly Ghost.  In 1945 he made his first appearance in a comic strip and then in 1949 in Harvey Comics. Harvey Comics bought the rights in 1949 and he became of their biggest 'stars'. Then in 1995 he stared in Casper - his first 'live' action film - where he learns his last name is McFadden (although this is disputed by some people). It's never made entirely clear if he was a young child who died or never born.

Picture was great as was the sound!!

I would rate this collection very high 9.25 to 9.75 as it has essentially all of his Toons (that I know of anyways). If you Casper the Friendly Ghost of old Toons in general this is for you!!

VERY Highly recommended!!",1434412800,6,1154,4.2949308755760365

We had bought some Casper videos recently and they were ""new"" ... we wanted the old Casper! Was happy to find this compilations of so many yrs.",1379980800,,388,4.1866666666666665
4647849,3,B005BUA1CQ,"Shout Factory touched upon a sub-licensing deal with Classic Media (now a part of Dreamworks).  Considering that at the time it was close to Halloween, and this cartoon is well-known in the first place, they released this boxed set of Casper cartoons.  Everyone knows who Casper is; he's a friendly ghost who wants to make friends, but because he's a ghost, people are afraid.  Somehow in the end he finds a friend.  The pattern is used pretty frequently on these cartoons, but once in a while you'll find a cartoon that is more unique or one you'll really really like.  I find Casper not to be one of my all time favorites.  Don't get me wrong, they are indeed great cartoons and I enjoyed the later 1994 film with Christina Ricci, but I don't find them as funny or as fun as Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry, some Saturday morning shows, and even some recent animation as well such as Phineas and Ferb.  Maybe they weren't supposed to be funny, but yet Famous Studios who made these cartoons also made Baby Huey, Herman and Katnip, Little Audrey which are fun and or funny, and yes even their Popeye shorts were far superior.  Still, I do enjoy these cartoons for what they are.
  Reviews on here so far has been saying that they love the cartoons and some parents on here are appalled that Casper is seen committing suicide and thus saying don't buy these for your kids.  This review will be talking about honesty, not ranting, not raving, just plain honesty.  So parents: yes, two or three (four maybe) out of 80 or so cartoons do have Casper trying to attempt suicide.  That said, yes you can still buy this for your kids as there are only a spec of cartoons that have that.  You think that's gruesome....the other Famous Studios cartoons out there have huge insane cartoon violence.  Herman and Katnip claims by some to be more violent than Tom and Jerry, but I digress.
  That said, what about the animation fan?  Is this a good collection for classic animation collectors?  We the fans knew what it has been like for these Famous Studios shorts on DVD this past by now..decade.  The Casper DVDs were aimed not even at children..rather babies.  ""Bonus features include hand selected cartoons picked by Casper.""  C'mon!  The worst of them all, The Harveytoons Complete Collection, features the cartoons as they aired on the Harveytoons Show with new messed up titles (on all DVDs, not just this one), incomplete, and no information anywhere as to what's on what disc and where.  Now I tend to find the good in all things, so here, let's start off with the positives:
  You do get all of the Casper cartoons on here including the first three that are in the public domain and all episodes of the Casper Cartoon Show of the 1960s (more on that later).  Therefore, the title on the box is correct, everything Casper from 1945-1963 is on here (unlike that Harveytoons set).  Also unlike that set, it's easier to find the cartoon you have been looking for.  The separate cases in the box, the booklet, and the DVDs themselves tell you what cartoon is on where.  They're all in chronological order, no mess whatsoever (nit picking Harveytoons Collection again).  The bonus features are good.  Mark Arnold was consultant to the set.  He wasn't the best here, but he knows a lot about the comics (which plays a key role in Casper) and he has contacts to great people behind the scenes..perfect match for the future Underdog release from Shout months later.  Therefore, we don't get a lot of from the vault features (save for the first three Caspers), but the interviews, commentaries, and comic book cover slide show will keep you amused.  The peace de resistance of the set is the Casper Cartoon Show.  This was when Saturday morning animation was at it's finest.  Is it the best gift in animation, no, but it is passable, and even enjoyable in a different way than the theatricals.  The stories are always different.  Still a little kiddie type, but not too bad.  All of which come from previous comic book story-lines.  Shout Factory was probably at their best here.  The cartoons for the most part are as they were originally released (though not reconstructed back as half hour programs).  The first cartoon and the end of the last cartoon on this disc has the opening and closing to the show respectfully (I'm the ghost that's known as Casper..) brilliantly remastered and restored.  Nearly all of the cartoons are restored except for a handful that came from The Harveytoons Show.  The ones that are seem as though they came from 16mm transfers.  I can tell sometimes even though they are remastered, they still have a presence of something that was once faded.  Still, you can see the cartoons alright.  The copies themselves were not preserved properly over time.  Even a disclaimer appears on the disc saying that there are still stains on the masters that are hard to get rid of while remastering.  At least the cartoons look better.  The collection talks about one cartoon on a home media release for the first time, but I would think a lot of these 60's Caspers didn't make it on home video until now.  Thank you Shout for that part of the release.
  Now for the negatives which are worthy of your attention.  Yes, 99% of the theatricals are from the Harveytoons Show.  From new titles, to just a single card.  OK, I know Mark Arnold begged Shout to get these cartoons with the original Paramount titles, but Mark still should only have been a partial consultant and have Jerry Beck consult the majority of the set.  He would have directed them to Paramount, who still holds theatrical rights to the cartoons and have the original Paramount titles from original negatives, and I think remastered too.  Just because you got the license does not mean you have to get the stuff from their source.  Shout usually proved it time and time again from Leave It to Beaver to Dennis the Menace and from Underdog to Tennessee Tuxedo.  Alas, Shout played it safe and got copies from Classic Media, but what they didn't know is that Classic Media grabs the quickest copies they could find on these cartoons and sometimes other products too.  Two of the cartoons surprised me though.  Casper's Spree Under the Sea never made it to the Harveytoons Show, so we see it restored with the old Harveytoon logos (something I would've settled for throughout), and Which is Witch even has the end Harvey logo (as a mixed breed from the Harveytoons Show), plus the picture quality looked really really good.  The first three Caspers that are public domain and as bonus features: yep...a mixed bag.  OK, the first Casper cartoon now looks logical sense with the ok title reconstruction, but picture quality didn't improve much.  Picture quality for a Haunting We Will Go looks slightly better, and the Paramount logo was sneaked in, though recreation was slightly poor.  It's mix of it and the UM&M titles.  The soundtrack to the cartoon however has ""enhanced"" sound affects and it sounds awful.  Hold on to old copies of both it and There's Good Boos Tonight.  This time Good Boos is a worse copy.  It still has the NTA logos and cover ups and the soundtrack is also awful.  Whenever lines were spoken, music was dubbed over.  This must have been for foreign countries.  I don't know where these copies came from. I know where Shout's heart is in the right place, but Jerry Beck or any of us would have gladly advise getting copies from the UCLA TV and Film Archive.
  So bottom line, if you want to see these cartoons again or for the first time, then I would recommend it, but please keep in mind the negatives.  My opinion of this set is that I wanted more.  I enjoyed the presentation of the Casper Cartoon Show, but I hoped that would have been carried over to the original theatricals.  Sadly, it didn't exactly happen.  They did learn from their mistakes on later animation releases though some issues still came about, nothing major happened that ruined the sets.  This is, however, a far cry from The Dreaded Harveytoons Set; it is well organized and it has some nice bonus features (though not the best).  And of course, a set that goes great for the Halloween season.",1378771200,7,8160,4.653603918824353

4647851,3,B005BUA1CQ,"UMMMM....I was not expecting Casper to throw a noose around his neck, turn blue and throw himself into the ocean with a ball and chain in the very first episode. I had to try to downplay ""suicide"" and had the ""NEVER put anything around your neck"" discussion with my 4 and 6 year old. However, I guess this is not too far removed from classic Looney Tunes and other great cartoons I watched as a kid....hope it will not be taken too literally by the kids, although it made me quite nervous when I saw that scene.
