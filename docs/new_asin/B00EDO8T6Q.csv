8604268,5,B00EDO8T6Q,Excellent information and excellent cone and line drills. I already had much of the information and these are drills that are performed in my league but it is awesome to have the video on my phone so I can do them anywhere. Bonnie D Stroir is so upbeat and reassuring in person (I met her at several bootcamps) and it's reflected throughout the video. Very positive and I think it should be in every derby players arsenol. My fiance has even watched it with me since he is joining a mens league.,1376870400,3,495,4.391304347826087
