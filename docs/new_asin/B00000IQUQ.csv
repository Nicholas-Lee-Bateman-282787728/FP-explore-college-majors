7911304,5,B00000IQUQ,"As a fan of the Stepford Wives, I looked forward to watching this movie. I was disappointed only because it would have been so much better had the men been replaced by robots, like the original movie and novel, rather than being ""conditioned"" in a clinic. The fact that someone could make a robot exactly like a real human and replace them, is far scarier but anyway..........
The Stepford Husbands, is a very good movie. It could have been a whole lot better, for example casting someone other than Donna Mills as the heroine. But it does still insight the original disturbing thought, of a society that creates partners to perfection. I always said they should do one for the husbands! I'm sure my mum would send my dad to that clinic!
Like the Stepford Children starring Barbara Eden, this movie uses sterotypical marital problems to justify why the men should be changed. It works in some places and not in others, as the story is being rushed along for the discovery of what happens to the men.
The poor blokes get tubes stuck down their throats and tubes put into their navel, painful!:) and worst of all, they have to do yoga! Basically the movie works very well, capturing some of the paranoia from Ira Levin's novel The Stepford Wives, while still adding new enjoyment into a new story. Worthwhile buying, especially if you are a stepford fan!",1006992000,12,1352,4.661087866108787
7911305,3,B00000IQUQ,"There are a lot of cheesy TV movies out there, so I don't know why this one was poorly reviewed. I had even talked to someone at Donna Mills' production company who said that she was very unhappy with this movie.  Donna Mills was NOT, however, involved as a producer of this production.  While some projects have come through her own production company, she was  hired soley as an actress for this one.
I thought that it was very well  done. Donna Mills has her usual glamour, and Michael Ontkean is very good  in this role. It is suspensful and creepy, and at the risk of sounding  pretentious, it is very well edited. I also liked the music. Sure, the  conclusion is a little cheesy, but hey, it's a TV movie! Louise Fletcher is  also in this, who is always wonderful. I enjoyed the ""look"" of  this movie, it's worth the price, and some very good acting. Donna's not a  great actress, but she's just great at playing Donna Mills!",947721600,9,931,4.423529411764706
