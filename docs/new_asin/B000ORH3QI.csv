8186427,4,B000ORH3QI,"I saw Mean Frank and Crazy Tony many many years ago and have always wanted to give it a permanent spot in my film collection.

Mean Frank and Crazy Tony is unique as it takes place in modern times but has the atmosphere of a spaghetti western. There is a good soundtrack, lots of violence, action and a crazy car demolition before the films end.

Lee Van Cleef gives Mean Frank his trademark performance: a cool no-nonsense loner and man-of-few-words, ready to strike like a rattle snake.  This time around Lee is a tough as nails crime boss who breaks out of jail and is out for sweet revenge against the mob who put him there.

My advice to the mob? There are two folks you just don't want to tangle with - Bugs Bunny and Lee Van Cleef.  Remember what happened to the bad guys in Death Rides A Horse? Remember what happened to Elmer Fudd?  This time around Lee has a bit of fun with a power drill!

Crazy Tony played by Tony Lo Bianco is Frank's uneasy tag along - a kind of hit-man-wannabe who idolizes Mean Frank. Crazy Tony is played mostly for comic relief - which isn't a bad thing as this is otherwise a pretty rough violent movie.  Tony takes the edge off a bit.

I recall being highly entertained and feeling that I got my money's worth when the film ended. It was allot of fun, very fast and very cool.

Mean Frank and Crazy Tony needs to be seen and in the film collection of every Spaghetti Western fan, Mobster/hit-man fan and Lee Van Cleef fan. It one of Lee's finest films and best performances next to his very best spaghetti westerns.

I have run into very few people who have seen or know about this film - But I assure you its very worth seeing!

I hope that one of the better DVD companies picks up Mean Frank and Crazy Tony and gives it the Criterian-like polished treatment it deserves.",1393632000,,1809,4.303834808259587
8186428,3,B000ORH3QI,"Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is a likeable lower tier criminal.  When noted crime boss Frankie (Lee Van Cleef) comes to town, Tony wants to meet him. Frankie ignores Tony as he has plans on his own, i.e. get arrested so he has an alibi. Frankie accepts Tony in prison after Tony saves his life. Things go horribly wrong for Frankie as his lawyer and brother gets killed, his empire crumbles, and he is stuck in prison. He must rely on Crazy Tony for help.

The film is not top notch. It has some comedic elements that border on camp. Likewise the tough guy talk is more camp than serious. Because it was foreign, it is difficult to tell what was meant to be funny and what was accidentally funny. The production is not a timeless classic, and will only have a narrow audience.

8186429,3,B000ORH3QI,"Disclaimer: The version of this film that I watched is included on VideoAsia's 'Grindhouse Experience vol. 1'.  As such, I cannot comment on the VHS package offered here on this product page.  My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

Lee Van Cleef is Frank, a syndicate boss trying to stop a violent takeover of his organization, and Tony Lo Bianco is Tony, a local small time hustler who idolizes syndicate heads like some people idolize movie stars.  When Tony follows Frank to an illegal gambling house, he get collared by the police along with Frank during a raid, but it turns out Frank's got a plan -- with the help of a bribed guard, Frank slips out and murders his lieutenent who betrayed the organization.  But when the murder is found out, Frank has the perfect alibi.  Unfortunately for Frank, the man trying to take over, Annunziata, has friends in high places, and Frank's scheme is found out.  It'll be death row for him for sure, unless the small-timer Tony can move up to the big time quick.

This movie seems to suffer from an identity problem - and none of the titles that finally landed on this film seem entirely appropriate.  Released in the USA in 1975, the 'Mean Frank and Crazy Tony' title seems like a rip-off of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Mary-Crazy-Larry/dp/B0007WQGR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Mary Crazy Larry</a>&nbsp;road movie of the previous year, and the re-issue title of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Escape-From-Death-Row/dp/B0000CNY44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Escape From Death Row</a>&nbsp;makes the film sound as if it will be something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Escape-From-Alcatraz/dp/630531036X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Escape From Alcatraz</a>, which is misleading too.  Better, I suppose, than the original Italian, which Google translates as 'God, You're a God Almighty'.  Most of the problem, I'd think, lies in the fact that the movie itself is a bit of a contradiction.  This is one of Van Cleef's better roles I've seen him in - it seems like it plays to all his strengths as an actor, and Tony Lo Bianco does well too, although his role is actually played for laughs.  But it's the mixture of violent mob murder and revenge placed next to Tony's star-struck goofiness that gives the film it's oddball edge.

Tony eventually gets close enough to Frank for the older man to trust him, and together they plan a break-out so that Frank can get back at his enemies.  Frank gets a prison transfer after a fight with veteran actor Nello Pazzafini in an under-utilized role, and with the help of Tony's friend Edwige Fenech (who improves the picture just by standing around - a shame she didn't have a larger role), they help Van Cleef to escape during the transfer.  Frank and Tony make their way to Marseilles where Annunziata has set up his operations, and mixed messages abound as Van Cleef's murdering mob boss character turns into a big brother for small-time Tony.  Yet somehow the film still contrives to muster us toward admiration for Van Cleef as he sails off into the sunset, even after he's killed off his competition - and half of France.

Well, best not to look to deep into this one.  I liked it, despite the fact that the introduction to Tony made it look as though it was going to be pretty lame.  The violence level is subdued in comparison to today's films, but there are still some intense scenes, especially in the very beginning.  Although it won't ever be considered a classic, it is definitely recommended for fans of Eurocrime films - and even non-fans may find it passable.

The version I watched on 'The Grindhouse Experience' actually clocks in at 93 minutes, which almost matches up with the VHS version.  There are also DVD versions of 'Escape from Death Row' floating around, but I believe they are cut down to 85 minutes.  I would say that the VHS version is probably where the great folks at VideoAsia got their source material for the version I saw - tons of artifact show up in the transfer, and the audio has that stretched sound you get from tapes that have been played over and over.  Still, if any of the other flicks on the 'Grindhouse Experience' sounded interesting, it might be worth your time to pick it up, as they are an introduction of sorts to a type of film that is pretty well extinct, no matter who tries to revive it.",1299110400,,4511,5.096467391304348
