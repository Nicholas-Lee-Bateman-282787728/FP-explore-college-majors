What a hilarious, crazy, mesmerising film!  Long live Duke and Dr. Gonzo!  Follows the book faithfully, and man, were some of those scenes realistic  (don't ask me how I know!).  My only complaint: I don't agree with  Thompson's final analysis of the Sixties.  That aside, see this movie!",912556800,2,430,4.565789473684211

Thompson in the club.  The first time I watched this I was cracking up so hard during the entire Bazooko's Circus scene that I could hardly breath.  Johnny Depp was great in this role and he and Del Toro have great chemistry.  Cameos a-plenty.  Good soundtrack.

59301,5,0783229569,"This is a ""story"" from Hunter Thompson's life. As a story from ""Raul Duke's life"", it contains flights of imagination and complete segments of drug induced fantasy.

This was gonzo journalism.

Thompson remains one of my heroes and this book (sure, movie) is one of the reasons. His consistent efforts to twine his paranoid drug induced smugly-superior-while-completely-overwhelmed schizophrenic behavior with the ""real world"", while showing the real world to be an even weirder parody of his reality, is what made him a great writer and keen observer of the human condition.

It is really quite hard to wrap your head around the crazy situations and amount of substances these two consume in this classic film by Terry Gilliam. Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro are are such a sight to see in their roles as Hunter S. Thompson and his Attorney Dr. Gonzo (Z). Depp did some in depth role research with Hunter for weeks, including a period of time in Hunter's basement with only headlamps and necessities (supposedly some LSD too) I've heard. Benicio is everything from a raving lunatic to a cool as a cucumber, soft spoken wise man on a good one. They feed off of each other's energy whether it's for the good, the bad, or the ugly. All in all, it is a hilarious, substance soaked adventure that keeps you guessing ""What are they going to do next?"". Hunter S. Thompson was one of the Great Writers of my Generation (29 yrs. Old). He was raw, descriptive and truthful amongst many other things in life and his work. He was also One Hell of an American who Believed in His Constitutional Rights and Freedom, may he R.I.P. . Check out ""Gonzo"" the Bio Film on him narrated mostly by Mr. Johnny Depp himself to learn about the wild ride he called his life if intrigued.

I was perplexed by the thought of Toby being less than whatever age Toby McGuire currently is. Wandering deep off into my thoughts regarding an alternate reality where people's individual history begins upon them being perceived by someone else.

I understand that several actors were assigned the lead role while the film was in development hell, but the final choice of Depp was a poor one. In this movie he looks like a child--10 to 12 years old--who is playing at being a grownup, which makes his drunken antics even more disturbing.

Our culture has changed, as well, since this mess was made. Regardless of where you stand on gun control, I don't see how anyone could find it funny to watch a completely stoned individual waving guns around. It's hard to believe that such a thing ever WAS funny.

Of course Terry Gilliam's visual style is on display throughout, and that I why I give the movie two stars instead of one. HIs nightmarish visions add some interest to what would otherwise be a complete waste of time.",1454457600,,941,4.562130177514793

60289,5,0783229569,"On the surface, this is a movie about two men who go on a long drug binge on Rolling Stone's dime, while covering a dirt bike race.  This really just becomes a framing device for Hunter S. Thompson's observations on society, and the overall political climate of America at the time.

It's a truly unique movie, and one of the best realized films I have ever seen.  As far as setting a tone for a film, this one stands high above most orher films.  The drug content might seem gratuitous at first glance, but that's more of a byproduct of the narrative.  It serves to help tell the story.

The performances are all excellent.  The main cast of Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Toro are quite frankly the best casting I could think of for their roles.  Johnny Depp nails Hunter S. Thompson's mannerisms, and vocal inflections like no one could.  And in spite of the general absurdity of what occurs in this movie, the cast makes the characters feel real, and gives them some actual heart.

The visual effects still hold up today.  This movie came out in that weird period where cgi and practical effects were at odds.  This film really use both to its advantage.  Both styles are blended together quite well, and nothing truly comes off as dated.

And this is really a movie that should be seen.  Not for the kids, but if you have an open mind, and can appreciate non-traditional storytelling, then I highly recommend checking this one out.",1453161600,13,1433,4.54296875

60350,3,0783229569,"What it is: Psychedelia... I guess.

My wife hates this film and cannot understand why I would ever watch it.

This movie should be seen for it credentials if for nothing else, but you might just hate yourself on the morning: Hunter S. Thompson (the movie is narrated from start to end with his copy,) Alex Cox (of Repo Man (1984) fame,) & Terry Gilliam (who picked it up after Cox.) It does feature some trippy scenes, melting faces and fabrics, lizard people (with what I would guess is a returning, unexplained prop when Johnny Depp shows up with a lizard tail later on,) and lots of general weirdness and bizarre people and behavior, if no other actual genre content.

What story there is: Hunter and his sidekick go Las Vegas to cover a desert race, demolish their hotel room, attempt to leave, then return on a different assignment to cover a D.A. conference and proceed to trash a second hotel room. All the while they mass consume vast quantities of illegal chemicals and appear not to cover anything, really.

Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not so much a story as a drug addled road trip to Vegas and back again. It is hard to see what the intent of filming this other than generating a general feeling of disgust (lots of vomit scenes, for some reason or other*.)  The movie is set five years or so after the height of Haight-Ashbury hippiedom (at least according to Thompson.) The Summer of Love is well over by now, and while it is at this point hard to really identify what Hunter S. had to do really with teenaged hippies in San Francisco, he claims to have been there at the time and he seems to understand that whatever happened there is now dead.

Distorted lenses, tilted cameras and light CG (just before the disastrously incompetent CG of the Brothers Grimm movie and the later explosive, Pythonish CG of Parnassus.) The neon Vegas setting adds to the trippy ambiance, and it may well be that the actual point of the movie is simply to recreate a cinematic drug trip.

I would call if a head movie if not for the fact that there could not possibly be any cosmic significance in any of it.

*But which, frankly, after the Python excesses of Mr. Creosote or the behind the scenes secrets of Crunchy Frog, may very well have only a mild effect.",1446422400,,2264,4.4914841849148415

60431,5,0783229569,"It was once said that the Austrian composer Wolfgang Mozart was ""not a man of this world."" If that was true of Mozart, then Hunter S. Thompson, the original Gonzo journalist, was not a man of this Universe, or any other for that matter. Or maybe, when Thompson came into this universe, he accidentally brought the other one with him. Thompson, the writer of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, was a man whose perspective on life oozed from a pen filled with ink from other dimensions.

Thompson made a following in the 1960's and 1970's with a two-fold avant-garde approach to journalism. Well, ""avant-garde "" is almost too tame a word. His style was the journalistic equivalent to Salvadore Dali or Thomas Pynchon where reality and surrealism become very reluctant bedfellows in a world that seems to have gone mad--or maybe it never really was sane to begin with. The other aspect in addition to Thompson's warped view of the world is his habit of engaging in the lovingly coined term ""Gonzo Journalism"". For those unfamiliar with it, Gonzo Journalism refers to an approach to reporting in which the reporter and/or journalist becomes as important to (or more important than) the story itself, in a kind of self-aggrandizement in which the story and reporter literally become one. And Thompson was, for almost five decades, the quintessential Gonzo journalist. He is sometimes referred to as Dr Gonzo.

As Gonzo journalism is definitely not for all readers, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is definitely not for all movie-goers. If you're shopping for a film to re-affirm certain steadfast precepts of logic, love, ethics, and morality, then your movie-buying dollar needs to be invested elsewhere. But if you're willing to forgo any predetermined expectations about how and what a movie should be, you're in for one hell of a ride. Fear and Loathing is a roller coaster from which you never seem to be able to get off.

The story surrounds a semi-fictional character, Raoul Duke, played brilliantly by Johnny Depp in a role that even the most daring of actors would avoid at all costs. The only other actor brave or foolish enough to step into the twisted world of Thompson was Bill Murray in ""Where the Buffalo Roam"". The difference between Raoul Duke and Hunter Thompson is mainly the spelling. The character is still replete with Thompson's trademark long cigarette, California drawl, and a personality that is at once maddeningly low-key and as deranged as Dracula on speed. The Raoul Duke aka Hunter Thompson character is the type of person you might want to at first avoid by running into the nearest coat closet before peeking your head out to see what this space alien masquerading as a human being will do next. And Raoul Duke goes on this adventure with a side-kick known sometimes as his attorney and also as Dr Gonzo.

The setting for the misadventures of these two interplanetary refugees couldn't be more perfect. Space Alien and his side-kick Godzilla go on a drug-infested trip to the loony-bin surreal capital of the US of A: Las Vegas. Duke is supposed to be covering a motorcycle race for the incomparable Sports Illustrated and gets sidetracked by the amusement park that is the Disneyland for adults. The road trip begins on the infamous two-lane highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in a 1960's convertible that has seen better days--and better owners. Even before they arrive in neon-ville, Depp sees bats all over the sky, but becomes concerned when his partner fails to see them also. He wonders that his partner may be ""losing it"" when he doesn't see the bats that Depp does. During the trip (and the ""trip"") these two maniacs enter Vegas and see strange creatures in and out of hotels, casinos, bars, and even on the race track. And people in particular sometimes show up as reptilian creatures looking to devour Raoul Duke and Dr Gonzo.

The result is a kind of endless romp through an amusement park from Hell that never lets up. At one point the drugs have so twisted all of their perceptions of reality that the world has become somewhat akin to the hideout of the Joker in the old Batman TV series from the 1960's, you know where the floor is always slanted to the side. This is the Hunter Thompson world to a tee faithfully executed by probably the only other entity on the planet twisted enough himself to bring this mayhem to the screen: Terry Guilliam of Monty Python fame. (He was the originator of the mad cartoons that combined European Renaissance art with the Python surrealist sensibility between sketches.) The story is a mosaic of drug-inducements that nearly drive the characters insane. I mean, is Las Vegas only the most inane choice of a location to engage in an intense drug-fest? Some have criticized this movie as advocating and glorifying psychedelic drugs, but I disagree. By movie's end I felt there was a reason I don't personally engage in these kinds of ""trips"". Maybe the world is mad enough as it is without using artificial means to make it seem even more insane.",1430870400,,5027,4.793540945790081

60440,2,0783229569,"The beginning of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (a.k.a. What Its Like to Be Perpetually High in Nevada) is akin to the ending of Psycho: though youve heard its catchphrase before, it feels fresh when you sit down to watch.  When Norman Bates says in his mothers voice that he wouldnt hurt a fly, our skin crawls, whereas in Fear and Loathing, Johnny Depps delivery of We cant stop here; this is bat country is positively hilarious.  Context is key, and we know from the opening credits of Fear and Loathing that were in for a wild ride by literally starting off in one.

I normally don't like films that are one big acid trip (or, in this case, acid, mescaline, weed, ether, etc.), and Fear and Loathing is no exception.  Though, Depps portrayal of late author Hunter S. Thompson is all too entertaining, even if he does become a caricature at times.  I could have watched Depp swat at imaginary bats in that car for hours.

Fear and Loathings plot relies heavily on the audience having a prior understanding of who Hunter S. Thompson was and what he did for a living, else you're left wondering why this middle-aged dude and his lawyer are spending so much time in Vegas, blitzed out of their skulls.

We don't get a grasp on Raoul Dukes (Thompsons alter-ego, as we learn in a great scene involving a parking lot attendant) being a member of the press, covering a race in Vegas, until were about a quarter of the way in, when Duke contemplates via voice-over: What was the meaning of this trip? Was I just roaming around in a drug frenzy of some kind? Or had I really come out here to Las Vegas to work on a story? Your guess is as good as ours, Duke.

I thought Dr. Gonzos (Benicio Del Toro) being an attorney was a joke.  Surely, an attorney would keep more of a level head when he has a client like Duke, but no, the seduction of the drugs was apparently too great.  Scarily enough, when Gonzo is sober, Del Toro is actually somewhat comprehensible.  (I swear, the dude is like a Puerto Rican Marlon Brando.)

Fear and Loathing is as littered with celebrities as the Vegas strip itself, with quick cameos from the likes of Tobey Maguire, Cameron Diaz, Flea, and Gary Busey, Ellen Barkin, Mark Harmon, Harry Dean Stanton, Penn Jillette, Christina Ricci, and even Verne Troyer (remember him?).  And yes, when Duke sees a future version of himself in a tripped-out haze, that is indeed Thompson, making an uncredited cameo appearance as himself.

Whats interesting is that all of these stars are credited with such bland character titles as Hitchhiker (Maguire), Magazine Reporter (Harmon), or Highway Patrolman (Busey)  a character who clearly has a name, as is indicated by his badge.  This suggests to me that when you're as saturated in drugs as Duke is, and for as long as he is, people lack significance.  Unless, of course, other people being insignificant had nothing to do with the drugs at all.

But the drugs, oh, those are referred to by name of course, and often.  Duke explains nearly every drug they take while they're taking it and the experience that each one brings, hallucinating images of blood-soaked floors and stretched out faces.  Fear and Loathing is as much a love letter to drugs as it is to Nevada (though, I must admit, Im sold on that carousel bar).

One thing that can be said about Depp is that the man surely loves his job, so much so that he makes you want to be an actor, too.  Im willing to bet that this is why he tends to veer toward crazier characters.  Despite the fact that he embodies these roles so perfectly, though, you can always tell that its still Depp under the make-up.  He never loses himself so completely as, say, Tim Robbins did in The Shawshank Redemption  save for maybe his portrayal of Sweeney Todd.

I remember reading that during the filming of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Depps daughter came down with a serious E. Coli-related illness, which no doubt influenced his work, allowing him to bring an exceptional brand of darkness to the role in a performance that ultimately earned him an Oscar nod.  So he didn't win  I doubt he minded.  Depp seems like the kind of person thats grateful to be able to wake up every day and do what he does; an Oscar win would probably be nothing more than a cherry atop an already fulfilling cake.

I remember learning in film class once upon a time that the voice-over technique can be frowned upon, as it is often overused as a lazy method of exposition, rather than the showing, not telling that film is supposed to accomplish.  (Thats why they call them moving pictures.)  Voice-over is rarely done well, though I imagine that its easier to execute it properly when adapting the film from a book, since the material basically writes itself.

60576,5,0783229569,"This movie is one of those works of art, kind of like a Tool album, that the casual movie-watcher can dismiss but those of us that get it, treasure it.  The acting is off the charts.  Depp aside, Benecio delivers one of the most powerful, hilarious, intimidating and sickening performances I've ever seen on film.  His scene with Ellen Barkin is as tense as scene as you'd see in any straight-laced drama.  His scene on the rotating bar at Circus Circus is as funny as anything you'd find in a mainstream comedy.  And it goes on and on, scene after scene, a new level of the character acting anywhere from responsible to outright homicidal.  It's something to behold.

The dialogue is wonderful.  It plays like jazz.  On re-watching it I always pick up on a different riff I missed the last time.  An it's infinitely quotable if that's your thing.  ""There he goes -- one of God's own prototypes -- a high powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production.""

The soundtrack is masterful and perfectly complements the material.  The visual effects and camera work are also perfect for the material.  The sets and details from the vomit on the walls to Tobey Maguires t-shirt are all genius.

It's a masterful work.  I'm almost glad it wasn't a hit when it came out and that the critic's didn't like it.  It makes it feel like I generally do about most things, that the majority of people just don't get it.  But if you've never seen it, please give it a couple watches as with any great piece of art be it a book, painting, song or movie, it deserves more than one look.  ""Don't try and fight it, or you'll get brain bubbles.  Strokes, aneurysms.  You'll just wither up and die.""",1414713600,,1697,4.516447368421052

He was appalled by it and we left half way through. Recently I bought the movie and watched it with out the assistance of someone with narrow views and a jaundiced sense of judgment.
I was blown away by all the performances and had not realized first time around what a star studded cast this was !! With Toby McGuire, Christina Ricci and Cameron Diaz supporting Depp and Del Torro this film was pure genius. Shock value, outrageous humor and total extravaganza. Depp as Hunter Thompson was in his element. Anyone with a sense of humor who was alive in the 70's needs to see this film. If you were alive in the 70's and you don't dig this movie, well, then it's unlikely you were really alive in the 70's.",1389744000,5,854,4.181818181818182

60824,4,0783229569,"From the very beginning, Terry Gilliam is able to make you want to squirm in your seat from a mix of feeling uncomfortable, laughter, and fear. This might sound like a criticism, but it's actually not. It is the mark of a very well-made movie that succeeds in its goal. The movie chronicles two 'businessmen' who get wasted out of their minds and destroy their lives in Las Vegas, comically and disgustingly. As a commentary of drug culture gone wrong, it might make you never want to ever go near drugs entirely. The slow decay of their sanity is depicted through an interesting blend of cinematography and content, and Terry Gilliam really pulls out the big guns with his absurdist style and knack for the bizarre (circus performing wolverines and martini-drinking lizard people, anyone?) It's not Depp's best performance, but Del Toro is extremely scary in this film, showcasing a powerful performance. Interesting watch if you're looking for something strange and intellectually stimulating.",1376870400,2,995,5.110429447852761

60988,3,0783229569,"This film depicts an out-of-control drug-induced orgy of destruction and idiocy. That doesn't mean the film is bad, it is just that it is about 150 minutes of chaos that is almost exhausting to observe and virtually impossible to comprehend fully. The film left me with the question: Why would two educated adult men embark upon a drug eating disaster in which their safety is constantly in jeopardy? There are probably many reasons but primarily, the change of human consciousness is positively reinforcing, that the distortion of perception is highly entertaining, and that the bending and melting of reality is a statement of rebellion against the system but also against the futility of trying to live a good productive life in a world of hypocrisy and idiots. The film shows men taking drugs that distort all perception, which they find extremely entertaining, far more than television. This distortion makes them feel good in the wildest, dangerous, hedonistic manner. They lose their humanity. The film actually starts with a quotation from Dr. Samuel Johnson to the effect that men become beasts to escape the pain of being human. This was more than a witty opening to the film, it is actually the meaning of the entire production. The film could be taken at many levels but many folks will be highly entertained by the outlandish foolishness that these drug intoxicated fellows create around them. It is entertaining and I found it kept me absorbed, shaking my head in disbelief, for over 2 hours. But underneath the foolishness, what was being said?  I think it was saying that human existence is not a bed of roses for we are confronted with death, loss, illness, violence, boredom, and a host of other barriers and burdens. We also are fully aware of these pains, for the most part. Yet we have an escape, the escape of changes to our consciousness that makes it all go away and get replaced by another reality and this wild reality is in place until we come back down to our senses and land back into the world of the living. So was this really a film about existentialism?  Only if you are an existentialist. For most of the world it was about 2 wacky guys acting outrageous while out of their minds from drug use.",1351728000,,2228,4.754521963824289

The image is amazing (whether you care for the movie or not, you HAVE to admit that it's a marvel of set design and special effects), and the audio is very good. Some of the dialogue is hard to understand at times (the fact that the actors mumble many of the lines is to blame, though), but the film's awesome rock soundtrack sounds terrific.

The extras are pretty much make this release. Three great commentaries which are ALL worth listening to if you are a fan (the third one, featuring Hunter S. Thompson, is particularly interesting), a collection of deleted scenes, and over two hour's worth of featurettes.

Overall, this release comes highly recommended to fans ONLY. If you have never seen this film, I recommend renting it before you pay 20+ dollars for it.

The monumental discovers made by Thompson on the modern world need to become the new chapters in history books. And most importantly, we must apply Thompson's eye witness documentary of the fall into today's society to learn from America's mistakes.

61048,4,0783229569,"Based on the book and article by the same name, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the movie has been described by the author Hunter S. Thompson as a ""a vile epitaph for the Drug Culture of the Sixties.""
On the surface it may be classified as two individuals on a wild drug trip, but deeper I believe it does delve into the eroding of the American dream.  This venture into what became known as ""Gonzo"" journalism has masterfully been brought to life by actor Johnny Depp who not only transforms into Thompson but also adds his own colorful quirks to relieve this writers journey into the abyss.
Benicio Del Toro as Dr. Gonzo, the affable attorney Oscar Acosta who provides the counter to Raul Duke's character and pushes the envelope to the extreme that event makes Hunter seem sane.
A mix of reality meets fiction, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a cult classic from an age that viewing from today's perception seems a whole lot simpler and saner than today's world.
Cameos by a few other well known stars like Carmen Diaz, Bill Murray, and Gary Busey to name a few,  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a wildly wicked peek into the American psyche.  It reaffirms the old maxim that what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.",1324857600,,1221,4.490990990990991

61062,3,0783229569,"This review is not about the movie, but about the BD release. And just in case there are multiple variants of it, my package has bar code 025192046131. I can't remember where I got my copy (not from amazon, that's for sure), but it has the same cover shown here on amazon, and the issues I have with this release are important enough that I thought it would help to write a review here as well.

With this BD experience, I decided I will stay away from future BD acquisitions and stick to purchasing DVDs. Here's why: after a while, this BD will simply stop working. When I got it, I started playing it in a Visio player and all was great. But I couldn't watch it until the end, so I paused it and I adjourned the viewing. Next day, when I wanted to resume it, it wouldn't work - it basically gets stuck after selecting the English language, but before any preview is shown. Screen goes black, no message is shown, skipping or fast forwarding return the encouraging message that the operation is prohibited at the moment (great choice of words that every customer must want to hear, by the way), I can bring up player menus, but I can't change a thing, other than getting back to the player menu. I also have a Sony player, so I thought this might be a Visio player problem, so let me play it in the player of its makers - worked fine again, stopped it, restarted it and continued fine - alas, this was the last time it worked like this - third time I restarted the movie, it got stuck again like on the Visio. Now it doesn't play in either of them. I checked the disc surface and it's perfect - no scratches, dirt, fingerprints. Movie plays initially without any problems in a player, but then it's like it gets stuck and cannot be replayed. Both players I tried it on have the latest respective updates and they're recent models. Other BDs play just fine, so this is a release issue.

Now, this self proclaimed ""perfect hi def movie experience"" has a ""feature"" called BD Live - I think it tries to connect somewhere maybe to get fresh previews (like that's what I purchased this item for) and I suspect that maybe that is what gets stuck. So I tried stopping my internet connection in the hope that it can achieve something - unfortunately it didn't change anything.

I am now looking on the Internet searching for tips on this issue.

The movie is great. Its subject matter may not be to everyone's taste, but that's another thing. I'll probably get it on DVD if I can't figure out a way to make the BD work again.

[UPDATE 10/02/2011]: After digging through player menus, I found a BDLive category on the Visio player which allowed me to delete BDLive content and prohibit Internet access (feels good to be able to prohibit something for a change). On the Sony player, I had no such BDLive menu, but under BD settings I disabled BD Internet Access - I also erased the USB stick just to be sure. After these changes, the disc finally resumed playing in both players. I've been able to complete seeing the movie.

Updating review score - I'll raise it to three stars. A disc shouldn't require changing default player settings to get it to play properly - for the time wasted to fix that problem I am taking two stars out. The issue, in a nutshell, is that if your player has wireless Internet access set up, the disc will stop playing after a while because of some implementation issue with the BDLive feature. The fix is to prevent Internet access (cutting the connection wasn't sufficient, it looks like it must be prohibited using player settings) and clear up all BDLive information stored by the player. Hopefully, this information will save some time to others that encounter this issue.",1317427200,2,3695,4.474777448071217

61129,3,0783229569,"Having missed the movie when it was in theaters, I recently watched Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas on DVD with much anticipation.  I was sure Johnny Depp would do a knock-out job of impersonating Hunter Thompson, for one thing.  For another, I was looking forward to reliving some of the wilder days of my youth.

Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that Gonzo is really the star of the movie, with Hunter Thompson played as an ever cool but oft bamboozled sidekick who goes along with things no one should go along with, things like terrorizing an innocent waitress in a two-bit diner just for fun.  Worse, Johnny Depp speaks as if he has marbles in his mouth and an iron ring two sizes too small around his vocal chords. He throws off his lines in a monotonic strangled voice that fails to convey anything but disguised up-tightness.  Or perhaps a strangely detached form of insanity.

The depiction of the drug- and alcohol-addled perceptions of these two wild 'n crazy wastrals is masterfully done in many respects.  The camera captures Las Vegas as the lurid reality warp it is, even without the help of consciousness-altering substances. However, there's too much of this not-so-good thing.  It seems like one endless careen through a house of bent mirrors, without any unbent ones to bounce off of.  The viewer needs more touchstones in the non-Gonzo world by which to orient herself in the midst of the madness.  A less relentless onslaught of high jinx would also have been narratively more effective. I wanted to cry out, Enough already!  Take a break from this mother lode of post-adolescent rebellion and let us catch our breath.

As one who did my share of acid trips back in the day, I also beg to differ from the way that this experience is depicted in the film.  As I recall, anyway, there was way more to it than hallucinogenic morphs of party people into their beastly counterparts. The director (and perhaps his subjects as well) have left out the quiet but piercing insights into the nature of the universe, not to mention the molecules dancing in the walls. LSD really did change the consciousness of a whole generation, and for the better too.  This film offers no evidence of why.",1265846400,,2211,4.723958333333333
61130,4,0783229569,"I have been a Hunter Thompson reader and fan for years.  I saw this film when it was released in the local cinema and fell in love with it.  The entire movie is a masterpiece and will not disappoint if you are in any way shape or form a fan of Hunter's writing.  The movie pays an honest and humble homage to the book.  Hunter's writing was extremely visual to begin with and therefore a challenge to put to screen.  And in my opinion it was done near-flawlessly.  Fret not, all the lewd, lascivious, and what is now politically incorrect behavior are present in the movie.  And done so with respect for the book as well as the most scrutinizing fan.  But if you're reading this review then you're most likely familiar with the movie itself and have long since formed your own opinions about it.  That being said, how about this ""new"" BluRay release?

This movie was indeed released on BluRay long before the US release.  And it was not too expensive in online auction sites and was even available here, though not sold by Amazon, for months now.  So, you already own the overseas version and want to know if you should upgrade to the newer official US release?

In short, don't bother.  As far as I can tell they are exactly the same.

The video:  BluRay release of this movie is not by any means a reference quality print.  However, this may well be due to the original film's look and not the fault of a shoddy transfer.  Some of the blacks are a bit washed out, some of the colors are not entirely true...especially noticeable in the flesh tones at some points.  That's not to say that the DVD is lackluster in appearance.  Though there are flaws throughout, they are all minor and none of them will make you regret the price of the DVD.  Actually, compared to the Criterion Edition I own, this transfer stands superior and is the one to watch of the two.

The audio:  The film's audio is a marked improvement over it's standard DVD releases.  However, it's still not quite as ""natural"" as I would have liked it.  I'm not sure how much of this is the way the movie was initially produced and how much of it is the transfer.  My guess is this is as good as it gets and is probably as true to the original soundtrack is you'll get.  And is most likely the way it was meant to be heard in the cinema.

Is it worth upgrading if you had already purchased the BluRay before the Feb 2nd release date?  Not in my opinion.  The packaging is slightly different.  The menu is slightly different.  But short of that it's identical to the earlier BluRay release.

In conclusion, of all the DVD releases this movie has gone through, either of the BluRay releases will be your best choice by far.  It's not an amazing transfer, but best around to date.",1265328000,34,2741,4.383697813121272
61131,5,0783229569,"This is my all time #1 favorite film, I love Hunter S. Thompson's writing, Terry Gilliam's films, and Johnny Depp & Benicio Del Toro are 2 of my favorite actors, but what makes this movie my favorite is the combination of these 4 peoples talents.

""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" for years was considered to be an unfilm-able novel, in part because it's a true story about ungodly amounts of substance abuse, but aside from that, there really isn't any kind of normal story structure to it, and for years no one could figure out a way to fit Thompson's free-form writing style into a typical, 3-act structure, movie screenplay. The brilliant thing a but Gilliam's film though, is that he doesn't even bother with a typical 3 act structure screenplay, but instead uses weird camera moves, lighting and editing to create a kind of ""visual approximation"" of Thompson's free wheeling, start and stop, style of story telling, and Depp and Del Toro tie the whole thing together brilliantly.

But the end result is a truly unique motion picture experience, and in that way ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" my #1 favorite, is like a lot like my #2 favorite ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" because there's only one ""2001"" and there's only one ""Fear and Loathing"", and you should really see them in a movie theater, but if you can't see 'em in the theater? the Blu-rays ain't bad either.",1265068800,13,1370,4.6570247933884295

61144,5,0783229569,"I don't know what prompted Jeff's review? If he knew anything at all about Hunter's book it seems he would have passed this movie over, if what he wrote is really how he feels. In other words if he read even some of the book, he would have had a pretty good idea what he was in for before committing to the movie.
Anyway, this movie is great and a must see if you appreciate, or just wish to look into a small part of Hunter S. Thompson's world.
You must have a sense of humor and be either aware, or wanting to be aware of Hunter's book to ""get it"" in my opinion. It's definitely a must see. Buy it if you like dark comedy and are not afraid to see some ""real"" things. A sense of humor and some intelligence of the subject is required.",1257811200,,736,4.01360544217687
61145,5,0783229569,"I'd read the book - not because I'm interested in drug use or Las Vegas or even Hunter Thompson as person, but because I'm interested in experimental writing and experimental it certainly was.

As stories go, this wasn't really my cup of tea, though I liked the fact/fiction, stream-of-consiousness and the blending of literary symbolism with fact-based events. To me, these were really the only redeeming qualities of the book. Naturally I wondered how a book so heavily reliant on literary devices would translate to film - I had some serious doubts....

...and they were proven to be dubious. The movie was just the same as the book, practically word for word except the actor's interpretations of the characters made them more (IMHO)likable. In the movie I was better able to understand their motivations, their fears and why things that for me fell flat in the book were hilarious on film.

The one and only thing I would have done differently would have been to add the scene where they are asking the woman at the taco stand where to find the American Dream. This part of the book had me cracking up and I was surprised to find it absent from the movie.

Final thoughts: If you get this disc be sure to check out the deleted scenes. Some important elements of the overall subtext wound up on the cutting room floor. Also, if you can only see this film as the story of two drug addled psychos and their shennanigans (and that bothers you), then skip it, but if you can bear in mind that this is really a story about the state of American cultural consciousness in the 70s then you'll probably find quite a few things to like about this film. I'd also recommend reading a little about Hunter Thompson to gain a better perspective of why he wrote it and futher appreciation for how spot-freakin-on Depp's performance is.",1252627200,3,1824,4.637770897832818

61165,5,0783229569,"Similar to Fight Club, Fear and Loathing was unfairly treated by critics. It was labeled ""Worst Movie of 1998"" by lots of critics. It even got the ""Pointless"" label. It's really sad that a masterpiece like this got so much panning, because really, Fear and Loathing was INTENTIONALLY pointless. And anyone who has read the book would know this. In fact, with how many rave reviews the book got and how many negative reviews leads me to think that only idiots become critics.

Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas is not a drug movie. Sure it has lots of trippy parts and the two characters are stoned almost the whole movie. But this movie is about the American dream and how we look at it.

Raoul Duke is a young man with his sidekick Dr. Gonzo on a business trip. Along them is a hot convertible, lots of beer, Raoul's typewriter, and an entire suitcase of hard drugs. With the latter in mind, the word trip becomes a key word, as that's what they do. With time to kill in Vegas, Dr. Gonzo and Raoul go on a disastrous journey that involves misadventure after misadventure, bad trip after bad trip, which leads their lives into a downward spiral.

Fear and Loathing is disturbing, but just so funny all at once. Despite the Canadian ""PG"" rating on the back, this is NOT for the faint-hearted. But if you really look at it, we may never get a movie like this ever again. And the ""White rabbit"" scene is worth it alone... I was in tears by the end of that scene.

So if you can take a good film that's very unconventional you will enjoy this for sure. And remember, ""We can't stop here! This is Bat Country!""",1239321600,4,1602,4.383838383838384

This is by far my all time favorite film for the story, the directing, the acting and the passion surrounding it.

One other thing. For the swine complaining about DVD's purchsed from Amazon that didn't work and began bashing Amazon....do you really think that Amazon is making these DVD's? Think about that for a while and get back to me. Jesus, did I say that? Was I talking? Did they hear me?

Beyond that, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a story about a man trying to find the American dream.  Oh, and another thing, the ""so-called lawyer"" is based entirely on Hunter's real life attorney and friend Oscar Zeta Acosta, who was an important activist and civil rights attorney. Perhaps Mr. Shannon should actually read Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and some more of H.S. Thompson's work. In fact, I think it would serve him well to read more and write less in general.

Bottom line is people will still be talking about this movie 100 years from now when most of the Academy pop favs will be forgotten. I thought I had to clarify what is actually happening and why Depp is in LV to begin with.

""The novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas accounts for two trips to Las Vegas, Nevada, that Hunter S. Thompson and attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta took in March and April of 1971. He was writing an expos for Rolling Stone magazine about the killing of Ruben Salazar, the Mexican-American television journalist whom officers of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department shot in the head, at close range, with a tear gas grenade during the National Chicano Moratorium March against the Vietnam War in 1970.

A source for the story was the attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta, Esq., a prominent Mexican-American political activist. Thompson told Acosta that Sports Illustrated magazine had offered him a job writing photograph captions for the annual Mint 400 desert race in Las Vegas. Finding it difficult for a brown-skinned Mexican to openly talk with a white reporter in the racially tense atmosphere of Los Angeles, Calif., they decided Las Vegas would be the more comfortable place to discuss the story.""",1226448000,3,1289,4.908256880733945
61195,5,0783229569,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, a Terry Gilliam film, is an adaptation of Hunter Thompson's classic autobiographical account about his experience covering a motorcycle race in Nevada in the early 1970's.  The late Thompson's book has become one of the most widely read cult classics in literature and Gilliam stays true to form with his contribution to it, creating a near literal, cinematic translation.  Gilliam lent his adept directorial skills to other memorable films as well, such as The Fisher King, Twelve Monkeys, and Brazil.  Johnny Depp, in one of his most humorous performances, depicts Thompson's alter ego, journalist Raoul Duke.  Duke is dispatched to southern Nevada to cover a motorcycle race in the desert, taking with him an unbalanced lawyer named Dr. Gonzo, who's portrayed by Benicio Del Toro.  The two amble in and around Las Vegas for a couple of days, while consuming massive quantities of drugs and alcohol.  The film encompasses a number of interesting distinctions between the ideologies of the 1960's and the excesses of the 1970's.  It was Andy Warhol who said, ""In the 60's, everybody got interested in everybody else.  Everybody was equal suddenly-dubutantes and chauffeurs, waitresses, and governors.""  Ironically, the 70's were a rupudiation of all that, beginning the very first year of the decade, when four college students were brutally killed by National Guardsmen in the state of Ohio.  Perhaps sensing his own death in 1968, Robert F. Kennedy once said, ""Progress is a nice word.  But change is its motivator.  And change has its enemies.""  More than anything else, Fear and Loathing stands as a tribute to the eccentric, yet brilliant writing of Hunter Thompson.
May he rest in peace!!

Hunter Thompson practiced total immersion journalism.  He called this form reporting gonzo journalism.

Hunter Thompson drove to Las Vegas to report on a motorcycle race and ended up writing a story about himself writing a story about a motorcycle race.  If he would have written a conventional report on motorcycle racing it would have been interesting to motorcycle enthusiasts for a few days.  Since he wrote a gonzo story he had a very wide canvas and he used it well to create a classic.

Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro do justice to the outrageous characters created by Hunter S Thompson.  The reader might be turned off by the obstreperous behavior, extreme self indulgence and offensive inconsiderate language.

With the exception of Thompson's 'Hell's Angels' (which was kickass) the rest of their work left me cold and flat. Even so, I became enamored with their personas. So much so, it became interesting enough to read about them, versus anymore of their work. But it matters not.

61217,1,0783229569,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (Terry Gilliam, 1998)

When you get Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro in the same movie, and then get Terry Gilliam to direct it, you set yourself up for an exceptionally high-quality film. When that film is based on the writings of Hunter S. Thompson, you seen almost predestined for true greatness. Why is it, then, that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas fails on almost every level? Simple: because the insanely convoluted script (the story of the genesis of which is even more insanely convoluted than the script itself) takes Thompson's bitter, crazed, hysterically funny satire of American life and turns it into a generic, intensely stupid drug comedy. Granted, it's one with an incredible cast and a usually brilliant director, but make no mistake, 12 Monkeys or Brazil this ain't.

Depp plays Raoul Duke, Hunter Thompson's alter ego, while del Toro is Dr. Gonzo, Thompson's traveling companion and legal aid. (I had always assumed Dr. Gonzo to be based on cartoonist Ralph Steadman, thanks to Thompson's wonderful Kentucky Derby essay, in which Steadman behaves exactly like, well, Dr. Gonzo; the liner notes inform me that Gonzo is instead based on Oscar Zeta Acosta.) They roll into Vegas to cover the Mint 400, a dirt-bike race, and miss everything but the very start thanks to their heavy ingestion of controlled (and uncontrolled) substances. After losing Gonzo along the way, Duke flees Vegas, only to find out, when he calls Gonzo from a pay phone, that Gonzo has set him up another assignment-- covering a police convention focused on what we now know as the War on Drugs. There's a potential vein of humor here that cannot be overstated. Somehow, Gilliam's (and Tony Girsoni's and Tod Davies' and Alex Cox's) script misses it entirely.

It's impossible to watch Johnny Depp on a screen and not like him, but this is about as close as I've ever come. (Okay, it's tied with Secret Window.) And I've seen del Toro play drugged-out maniacs before and liked it a lot better. Usually, either of them can save even the most wooden script, though I admit even del Toro's remarkable talent couldn't help The Way of the Gun. So what went wrong here? I think a great deal of the problem is that Gilliam, in both the script (though how much of it he's actually responsible for we'll probably never know) and the direction, takes Thompson's source material far too seriously. (It's telling that the funniest line in the movie was actually ad-libbed by Gary Busey.) Fifteen minutes in, the movie has already become repetitive-- take drugs. Attempt to be funny. Take drugs. Attempt to be funny. Repeat ad nauseam, sometimes literally. All the ingredients are here for this to have been a great movie. There's a cast of thousands, many of whom are instantly recognizable (aside from the above, Harry Dean Stanton, Ellen Barkin, Verne Troyer, Tim Thomerson, Christina Ricci, Laraine Newman, Michael Jeter, Penn Jillette, Christopher Meloni, Lyle Lovett, and many others put in small appearances). There's a fantastic book at the heart of this. There's a brilliant director-- or, at least, one who used to be. (It's equally telling that after this, he went silent for a number of years; his next outing was the critical failure The Brothers Grimm, in 2005.) And yet somehow it all went horribly, horribly wrong. Amazon reviewer Jeff Shannon accurately predicted that the movie would ""achieve some modest cult status over the years"", but for the life of me, I can't understand why. *",1206403200,5,3509,4.894117647058824

61235,5,0783229569,"I think the best way to describe this film as ON THE ROAD meets THE NAKED LUNCH on 'shrooms...  Road trip films, of course are a dime a dozen... this one, however, in my book holds its ground -- but its not for everybody.

I feel what's great about it is that it seems to accomplish the near impossible:
In the past films have been made about people messed up on drugs...
In all honesty, watching people tripping on acid is only amusing for so long... virtually anytime you see someone on acid do in a film eventually comes across as an exploitational cliche you've seen millions of times before... the big come down's and bad trips... the flashbacks, a good vomit... then Jack Webb comes out and lectures you on the dangers of reefer and dope...
Or how about when film let the viewer experience the trip by doing funny things with the color and sound of the film, or even suddenly having a reverse negative shot with a guy in a monster mask, and zooming to the horrified druggie screaming, ""My face! My face!  Some one's eaten my face!"" - - that too is only interesting for so long...

But this film does something very different... It is a COHERENT road trip story as told through the eyes of a guy who's - - well very messed up on acid....  We take the trip with him literally - - and yes, the psychedelic imagery is there, but along with it are the people and places and the narrative...  Amidst all the weirdness, the film is a delight to follow...  and classic Gilliam (sick, bizarre and funny.)  And yes, as the acid kicks in and out, things get strange... however, the narrative observations make the special effects more than special effects and guide you through the journey...

Ultimately, let's face it, Vegas may very well be a good symbol of all that is loathsome, cheap and sleazy in America - - and it is a place where often the real does meet the surreal in bad taste, but via the film and novel, the surrealism of ""American Kiche"", and the mundane and ridiculous are taken to an extreme that is well worth the watch...

In conclusion: A film NOT for everybody, but if you're like me, an amateur social anthropologist with a love from ""schlockus americanus"" as well as the 60's and 70's, and both fascination with and disdain for American popular culture, this is a film that is visually as well as intellectually entertaining... dare I even say funny.  - - If however, you don't share this bizarre little fetish of mine and can't appreciate the film's cynical tongue in cheek humor... then I'll be honest: you won't like it very much.

P.S. If you like this film, I strongly suggest getting your hands on Zappa's 200 MOTELS if it ever gets reissued again.  I also dare say if you liked it, you'd probably dig the FIRESIGN THEATRE as well...",1189123200,,2758,4.47011952191235

  Well, I first watched the opening scene and some parts of my Criterion version (which had been a better standard transfer) on my 56 HD-RPTV.  It used to look great on my 32"" tube TV.  It looked terrible on the bigger screen of course, making me scared of another cruddy HD transfer like my Sleepy Hollow or the Game (worst ever so far).

After the first few seconds of the opening scene, let alone the rest of the movie, I loved this transfer (HD-DVD).  Now this is how ""somewhat older"" films should look like on HD-DVD!  Absolutely amazing colors, contrast and sharpness.  The vegas lights look fantastic as do the rest of the colors in this ""trip"".  No annoying digital noise, a few specs of dust on the film which I never mind, and the dust/smoke is rendered beautifully.  The DD+ soundtrack is great and it has a DD True soundtrack even though most of us at this point can't take full advantage of it.

61241,4,0783229569,"I doubt if anyone else could have pulled-off playing Hunter S. THompson as well as Johnny Depp. The actor who portrayed Ichabod Crane and Captain Jack Sparrow to perfection was the best choice - perhaps the ONLY choice - to play the founder of Gonzo Journalism.

Watching the film, you can tell that Duke realizes that his friend, Dr. Gonzo, is dangerous when he is high on drugs and, yet, you have to wonder why he continues his association with him. If I had a friend like that, I would have ended my friendship with him years ago.

To really enjoy this film, you have to try to remember that the two lead characters are high or drunk during the majority of the film. Both only see the world and people around them through an intoxicated haze. Duke tries to keep himself as safe as possible when Gonzo goes off the deep end several times, including the bathroom, elevator and diner scenes. I fully expected Gonzo to actually stab somebody with that knife he carried-around.

Duke and his friend pay for their trips to Vegas with bad checks, trash the rooms they are staying in and fly by the seats of their pants the whole time.

While I enjoyed the film very much, I would certainly not want people like Dr. Gonzo and Raoul Duke in my life.",1182556800,,1243,4.43859649122807
61252,5,0783229569,"Alright its not the book, and the book is better, all his books are extraordinary, outlaw riding shotgun on the 'American Dream', but this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Johnny Depp is extraordinary, (like we don't know that), I would love to know Mr. Depp in real world friendship, he must be extraordinary to be around and have idle chit-chat with while sipping a Starbucks. I have never seen films or documentaries on Hunter S. Thompson, but I am assuming the amount of work and tireless research involved in this must have been endless and extraordinary to say the least, and I cannot stress enough, that everyone I have given this movie to, everyone from a nun, to a liberal Republican have all found it quite entertaining. Is that not what is supposed to happen when you see a film?

Terry Gilliam was a fantastic choice for director, I do not think anyone could have brought Hunter to the screen like Gilliam, unless perhaps Depp was directing this himself. (That would have been interesting)

Each scene is so perfectly percise and its so fluid and fluent, the drug use that is rampid and the reactions in those given situation to the people they are with and the ensuing dialouge are A+ in timing and comedic raw talent.

I am getting goosebumps just reviewing this. Often I will have Fear and Loathing running in the background when I am perusing the net or have friends over for drinks. The countless classic lines that I will say randomly with people when a given situation arises, are just PRICELESS, and again DEPP is so brilliant, I envy his true, pure talent as an artist.

The music is awesome, the scenes at the D.A. convention are so off-beat and satiricly ridiculous, however Del Toro and Depp still maintain their professional compusure. I really felt that I connected with this film, a lonely, star child, cross breaded dreamer, who found this gem along side a discount bin one day in my local towns grocery store.

By far, this line in the opening scenes, just puts the whole movie on pace:  "" We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a saltshaker half-full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, laughers, screamers... Also, a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get into locked a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge, and I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.""

Absolutely amazing, and Johnny's voiceovers throughout the film was such a great decision to make, and I think made the film such a huge hit, because of that voiceover poetry that Hunter S. Thompson had, and that Depp brought to life on the big screen.

Dr. Gonzo, 'one of God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant...' is wonderfully played by Mr. Del Toro, and the chemistry between Gonzo and Depp is sensational. The takes and abundant laughs that must have been part of each and every day on this film, must have been memories that will last a lifetime.

To hell with the purist on this one, buy it and add it to your collection.  Not a five star film in comparison to films like Dead Poet's Society or Empire of the Sun, but certainly a five star in the talent department and entertainment field, and for that in itself, I will give it 4.5.

Terry Gilliam's adaptation of Hunter Thompson's classic account of reckless abandon in the Nevada desert is one of the best book to film transitions I've ever seen.  Gilliam's contribution to the screenplay is impressive because it accurately and consistenly reflects the tone and perspective of Thompson's classic novel.  Johnny Depp gives one of his most commanding performances of all time in portraying the role of journalist Raoul Duke.  The movie explores a number of engrossing distinctions between the ideology of the 60's and the hedonism of the 70's.  A very original and intriguing piece of cinema.,1140825600,5,633,5.227722772277228
61277,5,0783229569,"Having read the semi-autobiographical book before seeing this movie, I really had no idea what to expect. I still don't think one is better than the other, they both have different feels; the book is darker, like reading a seedy, nightmarish lsd trip. The movie is  different, slightly lighter (only slightly) and is an absolute assault on the senses.

I have heard that the original director was fired, before the subsequent director, Terry Gilliam was hired. What a piece of luck for this adaptation. Gilliams brilliant vision makes this an amazing film to watch. Every time I see this, there are scenes that blow my mind in terms of camera work. Gilliam combines the most stunning scenery with crazy angles and cuts to make this a surreal adventure through and through.

Aside from this is the pure attention to detail that gets me every time; there is more in this movie than you could pay attention to with three or four people watching the movie for days. Every time I watch it I see some new character, hear new background dialogue, or notice an effect that had previously gone unnoticed. My favourite is the archangel holding a burning sword outside the restaurant in L.A when Duke first recieves his orders to go to vegas.

In terms of the story, the movie is everything i hoped for. Las vegas is portrayed perfectly as the seedy, tacky, heart of the american dream that is the entire point behind this satirical monologue. The characters within vegas are desperate hopeless people in search of happiness they will never find in a freak circus town such as Gilliam displays. The main characters were picked for perfection. Johnny Depp, being a personal friend of Thompson's, plays a role he must know well. However, the real star of the film is Benicio Del Toro: this man can play a character to a T. Dr. Gonzo transforms from a semi-professional ""attorney"" to a drug-crazed fiend within the space of the lobby of a hotel and the soundproof room the pair occupy. There are scenes featuring Del Toro that make me laugh out loud, and there are scenes that disgust me in how sincerely Del Toro looks like he's just eaten a whole sheet of acid and wants himself to be electrocuted. The multitude of star cameos in the film do their job well; everyone from Penn of Penn & Teller to Thompson himself are in the film, and the high quality cameos keep on coming -  a personal favourite of mine is Flea from the chilli peppers licking lsd off Duke's arm in a public toilet - it really is hilarious.

There is not a minute of this movie i didn't enjoy. It is admittedly a very in your face film, but thats what was intended. This is the clash of two great american dreams, the hippies vs. the norm, so what do you expect? The extended title says it all; a savage journey to the heart of the american dream. It is savage, but it is also hilarious, mind bending, depraved, and amazing, all in the same movie. What more could you want from a great adaptation?",1127952000,3,2955,4.566037735849057

It's the end of a culture, a war we never belonged in, the direction America was headed at that time. And the feelings of HST about it all and sensing that they had pushed too far.

When I watched the movie for the first time, I watched it with the commentary first with Johnny Depp, Benicio Del Toro, and the producer. They explain alot about the movie that I think some people are missing. It takes a certain type of person to understand and enjoy this movie and Hunter S. Thompson. He is

(was) his own person and one of the few that was honest about the destruction of America. He will be deeply missed and one can only pray that we are blessed with another, similar to him; for no one could ever be like him. If you've seen the movie and were not really impressed, I challenge you to rent the Criterion Collection DVD and watch it with the commentaries and the extras. It will enlighten you like no drug ever could. In the words of Hunter, ""Buy the ticket, take the ride."" And what a ride it is!",1119484800,8,1154,4.217194570135747

This is the beauty of the movie mainly because it almost makes the viewer see this drug binge involing Johnny Depp, and Benicio DEl Toro from their own dillusional experience, with ether ,Acid,coke, and a small army of uppers and downers. The film shows the highs and lows from this ample sized portion of drugs ingested by the two main characters. The plot twists constantly when the high stakes became a problem with the law and several hotels. The intent put by Hunter Thompson was to find the american dream but the thought of this isn't very apparent in the movie.

1. Tobey Maguire's character (young kid who looks like and old man) sweating incredibly in the back seat of the convertable as Gonzo and Duke are tripping on acid and practically holding a gun to his head.

2. Gonzo puking out of the car and onto the car next to them and screaming at the old couple next to them while Duke is driving and holding a  gun in the air, within a few seconds the old man next to them leans over across his wife and screams I'll kill you!  I'll kill you! as he is banging his fist on the window.

Bill Murray was good as the great HST in Where the Buffalo Roam too, but Depp just has this style... and Fear and Loathing is just SO FUNNY! Some reviewers mentioned that you don't have to be drugged up to enjoy this movie and they are right, altho I can say from experience that it makes the movie 10x better! This movie almost mirrors the book but witnessing the characters in motion and seeing the scenery and places instead of just reading about them is just AMAZING. Terry Gilliam is briliant and accurately portrayed some of Ralph Steadman's best rederings from the book (HST's fav British illustrator). The movie also has the weirdest cameos by some of the most random A-listers and... pseudo-celebrities; like Penn from Penn and Teller, Cameron Diaz, Christina Ricci, Gary Busey, Flea from Red Hot Chilli Peppers, and even Tobey Maguire as one of the FREAKIEST LOOKING HITCH HIKERS.

It's a collection of musings, observations, and ideaologies written by one of the most controversial, outspoken yet brilliant journalists of all time.

61298,4,0783229569,"The only thing I remember thinking about this movie when it appeared in theaters was ""Why release a film version of this now?"" Who thought Hunter S. Thompson's seminal novel about drug addiction and Las Vegas would play to a savvy 1990's audience? At least the studio did the right thing by hiring Monty Python member and auteur of the bizarre Terry Gilliam to lens the picture. Outside of Luis Bunuel or Salvador Dali, I can't think of any other artist who could pull off such a wacky, unusual project. Thompson's novel, if you're not familiar with it, recorded the exploits of a journalist (Thompson himself) and his lawyer (Thompson's real life legal eagle) as they descended into one bleak bout with narcotics after another, all while supposedly covering the Mint 400 motorcycle race for Rolling Stone magazine. The novel theoretically details the search for the real America--or at least the American Dream--in the early years of the 1970s. Finding allusions to an ephemeral American paradise is difficult in the extreme in a book chock full of crazed drug abuses because the hilarity of two guys tottering on the edge of insanity again and again tends to obscure any meaningful message. But Thompson did pull it off.

Aside from a few scenes, Gilliam's film version largely fails to convey Thompson's fundamental themes. That the movie fails to do so should not surprise the audience. Cinema, after all, must rely on grandiose images and over the top antics to grab attention. Not every film falls prey to bombastic delivery, but ""Fear and Loathing"" cannot help itself. There's simply too much weirdness going on, too many metaphysical oddities popping up every few minutes, to worry about elucidating subtler themes. Within the first few minutes of the film, we know exactly what sorts of strange things will unfold. Hunter Thompson (Johnny Depp) and his lawyer (Benicio Del Toro, nearly unrecognizable under all that hair and sweat) roar down the highway on their way to Las Vegas and the Mint 400. Something's not quite right with these two. Their condition probably has a lot to do with the arsenal of narcotics stashed in the trunk of the car. They've got pills, booze, and a host of other powders and tonics designed to keep a person in the twilight zone for the next thirty years. They've even got a jug of ether, the fools. And they're driving. Fast. No wonder that hitchhiker (Tobey McGuire, by the way) decides to flee from the vehicle.

And that's the movie in a nutshell. Depp and Del Toro move from one wildly implausible scene to another, hallucinating madly and always an inch away from complete mental and physical breakdown. These two yucks stumble around a casino flipping their lids over the lights, sounds, and strange people they encounter. Thompson sees tables full of people morph into evil looking dinosaurs. The lawyer, locked in the bathroom, ponders dropping a tape player blaring Jefferson Airplane's ""White Rabbit"" into the very bathtub in which he sits. This dynamic duo survives many incidents, including car crashes, a day spent at a police officers' convention, and the kidnapping of a local youth. You can imagine what their hotel rooms look like after a few days of such activities-well, you probably can't. Throughout it all, the guys try as hard as they can to maintain appearances. Depp's character provides plenty of voiceovers to help keep the audience afloat in a sea of narcotized blackouts. ""Fear and Loathing"" resembles more a giant stream of consciousness bender than a coherent film. What does it all mean? Good question.

A scene in the film explains part of the mystery. Thompson, in a reflective mood during a rare moment of actual work on his story, undergoes a flashback where he sees himself at a concert in the late 1960s. He waxes morosely on those lost days when the youth of America thought they could change things for the better. As we all know, nothing really changed. America eventually pulled out of Vietnam, but the flower children grew up and sprouted suits and cell phones. At least a few grew up; many perished as their addictions became too much to handle. Thompson and his lawyer represent the latter stages of the 1960's Counterculture. No one would have thought about using ether or going on two week binges during the Summer of Love, but by the time the early to mid 1970s rolled around, the halcyon glow of yesteryear has turned into a nightmare. These two characters are essentially the living, walking hangover of a bygone age. When you look at the movie in this way, the hilarity drains out of the whole thing quite rapidly. Heck, when you see Hunter Thompson today on a talk show, as I did recently, his shambling, incoherent speech doesn't garner a whole lot of chuckles from these quarters. His condition is depressing, and so is ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.""

The movie's good points include the two principal actors' performances and Gilliam's sure handed direction. Johnny Depp has probably never turned in a bad performance, and he continues his winning streak here as the hectic Thompson. He's got the look, mannerisms, and attitude of the gonzo journalist down cold. Del Toro frightens as the surly, monstrous lawyer. Most of the credit for this intriguing film falls on Terry Gilliam's shoulders; he's always at home creating believable scenes of altered reality, and this movie has more than its fair share. While I think ""Brazil"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"" are vastly superior to ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" Gilliam has yet to disappoint me with any of his films. Give this one a shot if you're up to massive weirdness a metatectonic scale. I recommend reading the book first, though.",1092700800,78,5680,4.882901554404145

The film tells us that somehow the adages and directions given in the 60s seem to have misled us somehow.  Not an anti-drug movie, the movie merely points out that there seems to be a step missing in the search for truth.

61316,5,0783229569,"Well, Terry Gilliam did it.  They said that no-one could ever make a movie out of Hunter S. Thompson's sprawling, oozing, rambling, incoherent, gonzo 1972 novel of the same name, but by Jove he did!  Not only that, he has made it wildly entertaining, watchable, hilarious and fun as well - a masterful achievement, given that the end of the novel itself breaks down into transcripts of tape as the good doctor himself gets the Fear.  Much of the credit for this should go to the screenwriter who adapted the book so well, picking the best pieces from the book and managing to thread a vaguely coherent timeline through them, as well as to Hunter S. himself, for writing a book where the monologues can be adapted verbatim and work so well as voice-over in a movie.  The type of ""new journalism"" practiced by Thompson and his alter ego Raoul Duke forswears objective description of vents for a manic subjective stream-of-consciousness retelling of the essence of the story.  Wonderful to read - almost impossible to film.
The true star of the film of course is Johnny Depp, on whose masterful portrayal of Duke the movie hinges.  He flails around frenetically, spitting out his words like a mad man in a fantastically broken style where the words trip over each other excitedly, racing to all get out at the same time lest some vital thought be lost in the overall melee, followed by pauses where he seems unsure of what he was saying in the first place.  What's the deal here?  What happens next?
Depp is ably aided and abetted by a chunky Benicio Del Toro who, despite his racial handicap, manages to portray the vicious and psychotic Samoan attorney that Duke is almost never without.  The two of them then busily careen around Vegas, having fun, breaking the rules and searching for the American Dream.  Don't bother looking for a plot here - there really isn't one. Instead a serious of fast paced, beautifully scripted mini-stories keep one enthralled from start to finish, from ""My Favorite Things"" to ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"".  (Yes, the soundtrack is wonderful too!)
If the film has a downside it is the manic nature of events.  The first time I saw the movie it passed me by in a blur.  I didn't really follow what was going on, beyond a surficial grasp of ""they're wasted and in Vegas"" reality.  Too many jump cuts, monologues and flashbacks to really get a grip of what was happening. However I then went away and read the book, and the second time I saw the film it made much, much more sense and I was able to get to the heart of the thing - to work out what it all meant.  The movies slavish adherence to the original text is heartwarming and while the book is incredibly entertaining and perhaps on the whole superior, watching the movie can be a cheap fix, a highlight reel assembled to remind you enough of the original without having to re-read the whole thing.  Besides, once you see Johnny Depp as Hunter S., you'll never be able to picture him another way, such is the genius of the film!  Perhaps that's why Thompson went to such great lengths to prevent the film from ever being seen.  A little ego can be a terrible thing.
My main gripe with the film concerns the last words of Gary Busey's appearance - ""Could I please have a little kiss? I'm very lonely out here in the desert..."" It's not in the original text, it doesn't make sense and it doesn't add anything to the film.  It shouldn't be there.
So read the book first and then watch the film and keep an eye out for all the celebrity cameos, Penn, Flea, Busey and yes, even the good doctor, Hunter S. Thompson himself...",1071964800,6,3596,4.538699690402477
61317,5,0783229569,"Upon seeing this movie at a friends house a while back, I immediately bought it for myself. While it seems that people either love it or hate it, I suggest that you watch it at least once. Fear and Loathing is full of hilarious situations and some memorable one-liners, such as a stand-off between Raoul Duke (Depp) and a lone highway cop (Busey), or Depp exclaiming, ""We can't stop here; this is bat country!"".
While many critics accuse this movie of being shallow and annoying, it is probably because they are too full of themselves to understand what it's about. On the surface, it's about two rambling, drunk, and drugged crazies roaming the west, but it's full of witty humor (it takes several viewings to catch it all) and fantastic underlying themes that seem to be lost on the majority that can't appreciate this fine work of art.
While it's not excessively graphic (ala Requim for a Dream), Fear and Loathing does contain many scenes of drug use, and constant language. Obscene? Certainly. But if you don't take it at face value, it's a wonderful thrillride aiming to find the true American Dream.

These are the conclusions I gathered from my discussion with them:
1. ""Fear and loathing.."" actually DOES have a plot. The fact that a spectacularly overwhelming majority of the audience failed to see the plot is besides the point. The same amount of people also failed to understand Einstein's theory. Be careful though. This does in no respect mean that ""Fear and loathing..."" is an ingenius film much the same as Einstein couldn't direct a film even though he might've been a genius. Get it? Me neither..
2.""Fear and loathing..."" has as much of a plot as all David Lynch's films do together. To anyone disputing this or needing it to be explained i recommend the highly succesful detox programm called ""Watch Fear and Loathing again. And Again. Part II"".
3. ""Fear and loathing.."" is a state of the art...art film, which actually is filmed real time by a director seriously suspended in between reality scapes and played by actors who are actually beyond tripped out with the purpose of providing us with a complex and therefore difficult to understand map with the limits of the human mind. It could have been French.
4. ""Fear and Loathing..."" is NOT a film. It is actually part of a secret government programm aimed at discouraging our youth in experimenting with a plethora of different drugs simoultaneously. Judging from the reviews here though the programm has failed. Your tax dollars at work once again.
5. ""Fear and Loathing..."" will be undisputably understood when Part Two is released (Fear and Loathing in Modevideo) which is due for release in 50 years time. Those alive till then will be awed at the cosmogonic meaning of this film and will ultimately understand how silly they were when they were young and missed the idea because of their naivity.
6. ""Fear and Loathing"" is actually an alien film recovered during a UFO crash in South Siberia. The original has -of course- been kept from the public eye and this an adaptation providing us with a glipse into the alien mindset. Did you notice the scene at the beginning with the reptiles at the bar. Well, WINK! Do we have to spell it out for ya????
  I do admit that the aforementioned analysis theses are somewhat contradicting. But, I must also admit that i consider myself to be intellectually inadequate to pinpoint which one comes closest to the truth. I think that in reality we all are.

In no other hands would i have left a visual interpretation of the great Hunter S. Thompsons great novel. When I close my eyes after absorbing a sentence of this literary masterpiece and clearly see a vision that is not far removed from Terry's own. this film hit the mark just as much as any other of Terry's visual feasts.

Just because cameron dias was in the movie for like 2 minutes doesnt mean the movie sucks. you should have known that she wasn't a main character. and the movie is basically about a reporter and a lawyer who go on a mission if you will to find the ""american dream"": so johnny depp could write about his experiences... and along the way how drugs pretty much prevented him from doing so. so before you critisize actually think about what your saying other than blurting out stupidity. remember these posts are public.",1061078400,,830,4.577181208053691

I'm not particularly a Johnny Depp fan, but now and again, I see some works of his (Sleepy Hollow, What's Eating Gilbert Grape) that remind me of what a class actor he really is. Having spent a lot of time with Hunter S. Thompson obviously worked a charm with Depp, as his performance shines as drugged out journalist Raoul Duke.
Duke has set off to Vegas with his attorney and a boot-full of the craziest drugs you could ever imagine in one setting. The entire course of the film is basically one enormous trip, and the part I particularly enjoyed about this film is that no matter how bent, there's always Duke talking you through the moment - expressing his terror and euphoria.
I heard something about a lot of parents lobbying against this film because of the high drug intake, but in my opinion, after seeing bats attack you, reptiles in the casino lounge, and your attorney grow breasts on the side of his body, I don't think I'd ever touch the stuff these guys take. Films like Requiem For A Dream, Trainspotting and Fear and Loathing just help emphasise the reality of drug taking, and show the lows as well as the highs.

The outstanding camera work, special effects, and directing make Fear and Loathing a wonderful journey into the mind of Rauol Duke (Thompson) and his sidekick Dr. Gonzo.  The superb acting done by Johnny Depp, one of the best actors of our time, helps to create a character that is easily understood in his complexity but not so one-dimensional that he detracts from the film's overall narrative flow.

I'm not sure exactly if it was the story, or the directing, or both, but the movie seemed pretty pointless, and convoluted. I was able to pull a couple redeeming messages from the film though. The downfalls of searching for salvation in drugs was clear. And the superficial nature of modern American materialism also crept in. But I can think of better ways to convey these messages than two hours of rambling, vomiting, hallucinating, nonsense. Overall the movie gets three out of five stars based simply on the reputations of the cast, and the director.

He succeeds in that direction perfectly by accumulating junk and all other types of objects you may think of in luxurious and maybe luxuriant hotel suites. He also uses a lot of car chasing, car reckless driving, car violence, brutality and speed to get us into an ever-rolling and whirling and tumbling vision of the world. He does not hesitate in running after violence, unjustified most of the time, delirious the rest of the time, that attacks people, objects, buildings, and anything he may comme across. He wants to give us a vision of what he calls acid culture, that extreme psychedelic culture that developped from the mid 60s to the mid 70s last century, with the Vietnam War in the background, with Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew superimposed onto the main pictures, thanks to TV news programs. We are in an ever erupting adventure that really leads nowhere except into the depth of two minds that are no longer themselves but are entirely manipulated by the drugs and other substances they take as their basic food. It is a recent (1998) revival of films of the period itself that had probably more force, i.e. Fritz the Cat, Zabriskie Point, among a few others. But this recent film is also a sign that we are going back to that old period because our own times are out of joint and need some hallucinatary view to cope with a reality that is unthinkably thick and dense.

61384,5,0783229569,"Raoul Duke and Doctor Gonzo are the Laurel and Hardy of hallucinogen abuse.  It is perhaps necessary to have delved into hallucinogen abuse on one's own part to appreciate their behavior.  For the abuser, hallucinogen abuse is pure verve existentialism - an alternate human condition that is self-imposed and completely private, rather than the human condition that is universal and imposed from without.  Hemming and hawing about the Human Condition in the latter sense is pure dreary tedium and the very fount of unoriginality.  Existentialism as an intellectual trend was hackneyed from the word GO.  Especially as the operant word of Existentialism is not GO, it is AGONIZE or INTELLECTUALIZE or basically come on like a tough guy in someone elses loincloth.  Albert Camus wrote The Stranger and it is hailed as an existential masterpiece.  What is not mentioned is that he stole the whole idea from reading James Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice and that book wasn't any good in the first place.  Camus takes it and makes it into something that is pretentious AND no good.

Terry Gilliam is one of filmdom's great directors of anarchy. Unlike his predecessor, though, Gilliam lacked the insight to know that writer Hunter S. Thompson's drug-induced tale of the convergence of a cross-desert road race, a law enforcement convention, and the death of the Sixties was possibly the one truly unfilmable story ever committed to print.
Johnny Depp is one of filmdom's greatest connoisseurs of anarchy. After presiding over the overdose of River Phoenix in his notorious Viper Room, Depp didn't have enough smarts to know that playing a role like Thompson's that personified the drug mania of that day was probably not a great career move.
Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson is one of life's greatest connoisseurs of anarchy. His outlandish personna forever captured in Garry Trudeau's Uncle Duke of Doonesbury fame, Thompson must not have been coherent enough to give a thumbs down to the making of this picture. Possibly too many muscle relaxants.
In short, my dear reader, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" will go down in history with such films as ""Heaven's Gate"", ""Howard the Duck"", and ""Ishtar"" as one of the most poorly thought out exercises in filmmaking ever foisted upon an unsuspecting roll of film.
And this is not to point fingers at the makers for their work. Gilliam probably did capture much of the feel of what it is like to hallucinate one's way through the mirage that is Vegas. Depp may seem eerily like Thompson. The effects, the sense of style, and the ability to project what Thompson endured in those days in which he and his drug pusher lawyer friend, Dr. Gonzo (Benecio del Toro), painted the town puce are faithfully rendered. In all its dexedrine glory, the debauchery is splattered up there on the screen for the masses to eyeball - whether we wish to or not.

Get in!
In this wickedly funny and entertaining dark film, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" Terry Gilliam captures the humor and chaos in Hunter S. Thompson's literary masterpiece.  Not an easy task if you ask me.  If this film were done wrong, it would've been a terrible tragedy.  Fortunately, it was done right.
Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro star as Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo.  When a writing assignment is given to Duke, the two go to Vegas for the ultimate trip.  (Trust me, ""trip"" is the appropriate word.)  With a trunk full of every single kind of drug you can imagine, the two are off to Vegas.  But soon everything spins out of control and the writing assignment is no longer the only things on their minds.
Johnny Depp is hilarious as Raoul Duke.  Why he didn't win an Academy Award for his performance is beyond me.  He even lived with Hunter for a couple of months to get his character down right.  Now, that is some serious research.  And Del Toro is awesome as the Samoan attorney Dr. Gonzo.  (You wouldn't even recognize him if it weren't for his voice.)
Terry Gilliam did an outstanding job at directing this risk-taking film.  We actually feel like we're on drugs while watching.  Forget D.A.R.E.!  Have the kids watch this movie and they'll never want to do drugs!  Gilliam does a remarkable job of capturing Thompson's genius and placing it onto film.  The images we are given are dark and surreal, and are out of this world.
The DVD is not too bad as well.  There's a few extras that you'll find very entertaining.  Not a lot, but there are a few.  Including a behind the scenes feature, the theatrical trailer, deleted scenes, and more.  (Watch the trailer, it's one of the funniest ones I have ever seen.  It'll give you an idea of what you're in for.)  The picture and sound quality are very high quality, although I wish the movie were presented to us in Dolby Digital 5.1 instead of 2.0.  Oh well.
I read the book after the seeing the movie, and it actually helped.  Just picturing Depp and Del Toro enriched the story that much more.  Depp with the cigarette always in his mouth as he narrates always stands out in your mind, and that's why it was that much funnier.  Yes, I thought the book was a little better than the film, but let me say this, the film did a remarkable job of staying true to the book.  The two are very similar.
Here's two things I would like to make clear:  1)  No, you do not have to be a stoner to enjoy this movie.  I have never done drugs, and seeing this movie makes me NEVER want to do drugs.  Ever.  But guess what?  I still enjoyed the film and found it funny as hell.  2)  The reason why there's not much of a plot is because this is all based on a TRUE STORY.  Real life doesn't have plot, I'm sorry to say.  Life can't always have a distinct and notable climax or resolution, now can it?
All in all, I really enjoyed this film, and thought it was very misunderstood by a lot of people.  Yes, this is one of those films you're either going to love it or hate it.  There are no guarantees that you will like it, but then again, isn't that always the case?  I say take the ride.  Take the chance.  Dare to be different.  If you want something that doesn't fall into the category of ""ordinary,"" then this is the film for you.  Extremely hilarious and terribly freaky at times, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is a different kind of film experience you do not want to miss.
I also recommend reading the book as well.  It is quite the experience...",1034294400,12,3804,4.314002828854314
61401,3,0783229569,"The main thought that kept occurring to me while watching ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" was: IS there ANY movie that could translate Hunter S. Thompson's book to the screen in a satisfying way?
And I don't think there is.  It's also just as difficult to re-create an acid trip on film.  And Terry Gilliam tries very hard to accomplish both of these impossible tasks. (is it any wonder that Gilliam's has been trying for YEARS to film ""Don Quixote"" for???).
Gilliam throws EVERYTHING into the mix.  He starts with the kitchen sink and then moves into the basement and the garage.  And as a result, the movie is polarizing: people are either going to love it or hate it.  From scene to scene, my opinion goes up and down.  But the bottom line is -- as long as there are bongs, dormrooms and undergraduates: Pink Floyd will never stop selling albums and this movie will always have an audience.
For a Hunter Thompson fan, there are things to love in this film.  It looks incredible: bright and shiny as a new red shark, with a production design that must've taken an army to assemble.
And Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Toro completely nail their roles.  They BECOME Ralph Steadman's illustrations with performances that go all the way and then some -- at times, watching this movie was literally like seeing the images from the book projected directly on-screen.  Although it's a bit funny that Johnny Depp tries so hard to recreate Thompson's sprawling crab-like walk -- Thompson walks like that because he's 6'4 and long-legged... and Depp is, well, less strapping. That's a quibble, of course; Benecio Del Toro put on 60 pounds for this part, but Depp can't exactly gain height -- he did shave his head, though.
On the other hand, the movie is too all over the place to be completely successful.  The tone changes drastically on a regular basis, plunging from screwball comedy to somber message to disgusting regurgitation to sly social commentary to vicious anger, then moving off in another dozen different directions.  By the time Raoul Duke flashes back to San Francisco in the 60's (and the Youngbloods are hauled out to provide their oft-used historical/musical cue with ""Get Together""), you will believe a movie can have 120 different personalities in just under 2 hours.
Which is not to say I don't like this film.  You can't love it, but it's hard to completely dislike, and I find myself dropping it into my player every six months or so and skipping to favorite scenes (the wild, confusing opening; the Circus Circus fiasco; the elevator stand-off).  Personally, I always thought that, instead of making ""Natural Born Killers,"" Oliver Stone should've tackled Las Vegas (using the same cinematic techniques and Kelsey Grammar as Raoul Duke, but saying that always makes people look at me funny) but Stone didn't do it (and probably would've made an equally problematic movie) so this is the film that was made.  It may leak noxious fluids onto my carpet whenever it's on my TV, but... it has a certain charm, nonetheless.",1033430400,11,3032,4.783524904214559
61402,5,0783229569,"Fear and Loathing is a phenomenal statement of American society and an outstanding glimpse of the early 70's, when ""the acid wave reached it's high water mark"".  More so, Gilliam's masterful cinematic rendition of the book retained Thomson's unique intent.
  Hunter S. Thomson wrote about life and his perspective of America.  Fear and Loathing is indeed a drug-induced romp through Las Vegas, but its underlying theme is much more.  Hunter S. didn't write this story to shock a few readers with the unfathomable antics of two seriously committed addicts, he wrote it as a slightly askew perspective of the United States.
  Thomson (Depp), using his pseudonym of Raul Duke, sets out on an adventure with his mentally unstable ""Lawyer"" (del Torro) to search for the American Dream.  Funded by a sports magazine to cover a motorcycle rally near Las Vegas, the unlikely pair abandons every law, rule, and regulation our country has set to keep the general populous safe.  Swinging from drug to drug in a hazy binge that rivals any other, Hunter attempts to find the pulse of society and see if it's still alive.  His conclusion is that... you'll see.
  Over all, Fear and Loathing accurately captures the extravagant mayhem that a pair can cause in short period of time, all without harming anyone except an unfortunate mental-case (Riche) and the Insurance industry.
  This movie is the extreme drug culture pushed to the limit, but it also reflects the absolute freedom a man can have, if he seriously commits himself to it.
  If you want a detailed movie that takes you on an intellectual journey, this is not it.  If you want to understand Thomson's idealized concept of himself and of the personal liberty we have, then look through the glorified drug use and self-destructive behavior and see what this story was meant to be.

Fear and Loathing is the all american dream. Its not just a ""stoner movie"". Its about the coulture of the 60's coming to an end. The amazing adventures that 2 hippies face while they go on a business trip. Theres a rainbow of pills, coke, acid, ether, weed, and of course, alcohol. All of which they keep in a breifcase. The beginning of the movie is full of snorting, eating, and mindless jabber. Once they get to Vegas, jounerlist Raoul Duke (Depp) and his lawyer Dr. Gonzo (Del Torro) have to go to a motorcyle race to write an article.

The scenes from vietnam, the continuing military allusions, and the despondent overtones are there on purpose to make you think again about vietnam and the aftermath. the vague motives for being in vietnam parallel the search for the american dream since we were supposedly fighting to protect it. and its no mistake that every reference to the american dream is accompanied by some decrepit image is saying that the american dream is just as real as the lizards in the bar. the quote at the beginning also has some bearing on that.

61406,2,0783229569,"Well what can I say? I expected a lot out of this movie, especially when two of my favorite actors Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro are tag-teamed here. Unfourtantley, the movie couldn't deliver the goods. I am not very familiar with Hunter S. Thompson and thus I haven't read his book but it didn't stop me from watching this movie. Ohh what a movie and how long this movie dragged on and on. The movie hooked me in the beginning with Johnny Depp's ""This is bat country"" quote but it laggs from there. There is not much humor left in the movie. It almost seems that Terry Gillian expects you to have a stoner mentality or just be plain stoned to enjoy this movie, but I didn't. It was hard to sit through this.
The reason I give this movie 2 stars is simply because of Johnny Depp's wicked performance. He truly is a great mimick actor whether he is playing Joe Pistone(Donnie Brasco), George Jung(Blow) or Ed Wood(Ed Wood) this guy can imitate real-life figures so well it's scary. But the performance is not enough to save this mess of a movie. Now for Benicio, well his performance wasn't as good. Benny, Benny, Benny when are you going to learn that you should invest your acting talents in more respectable movies like ""Traffic"". Though it's admirable that he gained weight to play the role his character leaves much to be desired. What's worse all these guest apperances Toby Mcguire, Cameron Diaz, and Ellen Burkin(All fine actors in their own right) come out as farces. They do little or nothing to help this lagging script thus wasting their talents. I don't know maybe the script writer hung out with Thompson in his resort and was taking his own voyage in Gonzo journalism 420 style.",1026345600,,1695,4.560655737704918

I will grant that to the uninitiated this movie is probably intimidating and hard to like.  The themes that Thompson so brilliantly examines are not so readily apparent in the movie.  To which my resonse would be, why the hell didn't you read the book first?  Much like The Fellowship of the Ring, this movie was clearly made by and for fans of the book who wanted to see all that gonzo imagery brought to life on the big screen.  In that, I believe Terry Gilliam succeeded admirably.  And Depp and Del Toro are spectacular--Depp basically BECOMES Dr. Gonzo.

Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was an intelligent look at the drug generation by looking at 2 of the most demented souls wandering the most depraved city in the western United States (er, outside of Hollywood, which is in the somewhat prologue of the story).  Director Gilliam and stars Depp and Del-Torro capture that essence finitely from first drug to last.  Truth be told, not everyone will like this movie; the first time I saw it 3 years ago I didn't know what the hell was going on most of the time, as I'm sure many of the critics who saw this movie must've felt.  But, truth be told again, it grows on you in a very surreal and good fashion.  Only minor complaint- the absense of Sympathy for the Devil in the beginning.",1024185600,,750,4.413043478260869
61422,5,0783229569,"Those are the final words of Hunter S. Thompson's masterpiece non-fiction/fiction novel which blew minds when it first hit the presses in the pages of Rolling Stone magazine in 1971, and continues to do so to this very day.  The film version does NOT end with those words, but I feel that those words sum it up quite well.

This film is an amazing adaptation of that indispensable piece of American literature...quite possibly the best book-to-film adaptation I have ever seen.  The events depicted in the film, though sometimes scrambled about for the sake of fluidity (if it can be called that), were all taken directly from the book (except for the CHP trooper asking Thompson for a kiss...that wasn't in the book), and most of the voice-over monologues and character dialogue are taken verbatim.  Of course, several elements from the book were left out, but what can you expect in a two-hour film?  This is a lavish, utterly faithful adaptation of Thompson's book with incredible performances.

Johnny Depp's performance is dead-on to the point of being absolutely frightening.  True, he's a bit too short, but who cares?  In appearance, mannerism, expression, voice, and charisma, Johnny Depp may as well BE Hunter Thompson (or Raoul Duke, if you will).  Depp had met Hunter and spent a night at his ranch prior to being contracted to play the part.  In fact, it was Thompson who suggested that he do the film.  He spent four months at Thompson's ranch, eventually leaving with Hunter's car and his clothes (many of which hadn't been washed in 30 years)...and apparently, he also left with Hunter's mind...or, at least, enough of it to virtually BECOME him onscreen.

Benicio del Toro is also fantastic in this film, having gained some 45 pounds in 10 weeks in order to play Thompson's Chicano lawyer friend, Oscar Acosta.  These two play their parts for everything they're worth and the end result is astounding.

It is my theory that anyone who has seen this film and didn't like it has never read the book.  Why?  Because if you've read the book and loved it, you will love this movie.  And if you've read the book and hated it, you wouldn't bother WATCHING this movie in the first place...would you?

So the bottom line is that if you've read Hunter Thompson's seminal masterwork and adored it, as I did, you will not be disappointed by this film adaptation...it delivers the goods in a way that very few film adaptations can.  Truly, it seems inconceivable that a work like ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" could translate so well to the screen...but somehow, it does.

It's interesting to note that most of the reviews here give the film a 4 or 5 star rating...with a few 1 star ratings here and there. Also interesting to note that almost every person who gave the film 1 star seems to have no idea that it was ever a book, or that it's based on a true story. Out of the 100 or so reviews I read, I found only 1 negative review that mentioned the book. These people don't even know that HST really exists...otherwise, why would they all complain that Johnny Depp's acting is ""horrible,"" or ""the worst acting of his career"" when, in fact, his performance as HST is flawless?

If you haven't read Thompson's book, you might still get something from this film (a few laughs, at the very least), but if you feel lost at the end, you might want to give the book a read and then come back to the film...it will make more sense once you get the full story.  Of course, it will never make complete sense.  I mean, good God, man...what does?",1021334400,3,3544,4.626198083067092

From beginiing to end, it's a non-stop drug-induced completely insane and mind boggling array of dream imagery...and even dreams aren't even this wild, it's as if the characters in your dream got hit by a swift surge of brain vein or something and are spiralling utterly out of control...
As Johnny Depp's character says at the end speaking of Benincio Del Toro's character: ""...He was too weird to live."" I'll let you interpret that one for yourself. Anyway, this is one bad trip of a circus ride where it's hard to pick out any scenes: some include: taking massive doses of ether to the point where walking and all depth perception is dismantled, then going to a circus (which Depp describes as ""What the THird Reich would have done every Saturday night if they had won the war.""); an insane nearly 10 minute situation where Del Toro is in a bathtub and Depp tries to throw a radio in it and...it was too confusing to explain...Infact, the whole movie is completely mad which is why it rocks so much. Like a good Burroguhs novel or something, too ineffable to pick out anything just go along for the ride and enjoy yourself.

Though some people may be confused and bewildered by such a torrent of madness, this movie stands as one of a kind. I personally have read the book before the movie came out and I feel that the movie leaves out many crucial moments. This may be the reason for some confusion in certain scenes.

It plays like a comic strip with unpleasant characters turning mundane situations into vehicles for crime and folly.  Parking a car, entering a bar, watching a motorcycle race, etc. become major ""plot points,"" as our drugged-up drunk heros render themselves incompetent for these simple tasks.  They berate each other, threaten each other with knives and mace, and likewise threaten innocent bystanders.  Meanwhile the narration, laid on with a trowel in homage to the book from which it is taken verbatim, struggles pathetically to impose a higher meaning on these daft proceedings.
Ralph Steadman's grotesque illustrations for the book are accurately realized in the film, and this is the root of the problem.  Steadman drew caricatures of the book's characters; the film brings these caricatures to life as though they are realistic, Rockwell-like portraits of the characters -- and this fatal misrepresentation sinks the film.  Burlesque is diluted with meditation, and as a result the film is neither amusing nor enlightening.
The film is entirely superficial, but even so it veers between hallucinatory distortion and gross caricature, leaving the viewer to wonder at the mental age of the people responsible for this farce.  Alas, some very talented people were involved, not least of whom is Hunter S. Thompson, and they all should hang their heads in shame.
This movie has its share of funny scenes, but five minutes of amusement won't justify two hours of Fear & Loathing.

If this is what being an adult is like, send me back to Jack Lint!
I had no idea who Hunter Thompson was before watching this, and still have trouble believing he's real. (No, he's not the chap who wrote about the Beatles). Even if he is real, did he write himself as he truly is in the book, or some abstract version? Did Gilliam take the book version of Hunter Thompson and twist him into a Gilliamesque character? We may never know. What we do know is the care with which Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro play Thompson and his chum Doctor Gonzo.
There is an intensity to Depp's performance counterbalanced by the languid Toro which demonstrates uppers and downers in all their ghastly glory. Christina Ricci makes a noteworthy appearance, proving that she isn't just a washed up child star.
On the whole, a very interesting and strangely compelling film, but not necessarily a pleasant experience.

When a writing assignment lands journalist Raoul Duke (Depp) and sidekick Dr. Gonzo (Toro) in Las Vegas, they decide to make it the ultimate business trip. But before long, business is long forgotten and trip has become the key word. Fueled by a suitcase full of mind-bending pharmaceuticals, Duke and Gonzo set off on a fast and furious ride through nonstop neon, surreal surroundings and a crew of the craziest characters ever! But no matter where misadventure leads them, Duke and Gonzo discover that sometimes going too far is the only way to go.
My remarks toward this picture
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is simply one of those movies that you'll either love or loathe. It's a pseudo-psychedelic, very colorful and stylized comedy that's-in my opinion-so funny, so excruciatingly funny that the mere thought of it will draw a smirk on your face, and perhaps even have you laugh, then!
While it, to many, seemed as being a painfully long and senseless film, it really defined the counterculture of its day. Needless to say, with characters who'll suppose of such mind-bending pharmaceuticals as daily substances to indulge upon, unnecessary close-ups of vomit and urine, and swooping camera movements at any and every opportunity, this very atypical and repellent film is certainly not for everyone. (""We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half-full of cocaine and a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... Also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls... But the only thing that worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible than a man in the depths of an ether binge,"" Duke narrates to us.)
But for the self-seeking and fans of either Hunter S. Thompson or Terry Gilliam...
Although it was clear that the film had no real plot line to support it, no shape, trajectory, or purpose, that did not matter-to me, anyway-because it regards these two characters, Duke and Gonzo, and if you'll find them appealing to me, if you'll like them, then so will you like this film. Why do people enjoy such innovative television sitcoms as Seinfeld? It has absolutely no plot line to it, no objectives by any means; it's about nothing. So why is it that it has become one of the primary choices in popular culture? -Because we enjoy seeing these four comical characters' every day lives...about nothing; they entertain us, as both Duke and Gonzo had entertained me. It's all about them, you see. It's all about their world, which is frequently seen entirely through their eyes, thereby generating greater sidesplitting and outrageous moments as the images and events they think they're seeing further affects their mental stability. We see these guys rambling fatuously past the eccentric backdrops of Las Vegas while zonked out of their minds. We see them take more drugs, get themselves into new situations, fall about, flounder, wreak havoc, and retreat to their hotel suit, and oftentimes these events will be introduced by Duke himself as the narrator who comments on them. Now, humor relies on behavior. Beyond a particular point, you don't have a behavior, you reside a state, but that was okay, because I, as I have previously said, liked these characters, and although there reached a point when they no longer made me laugh as hard, their lives, somehow, in an awkward way, still managed to entertain me. Also, I enjoyed all of the visuals and computer-generated scenes.
Director Terry Gilliam, a master of complex, bizarre visual imagery, does such an outstanding job in capturing the exact agitated tone, intensity and utter madness of Hunter S. Thompson's classic book, which really came as to no surprise whatsoever, for the book itself was used as their screenplay. For the first time ever, a book was used as a screenplay, and the result is astonishing! Usually after having finished with a book that's based upon a film you've previously seen, you wind up saying to yourself: the film was nowhere near as good, unlike for this title, where both the film and book equally major and have the same fine quality in a twisted kind of way. And, like the book, Gilliam really has you feel for these very dysfunctional individuals who, as you sit there and observe of the many risks they so carelessly make, you form a special care for and don't want anything fatal to happen to.
The performances were just incredulously stunning! In fact, these vivid actors were so persuasive, you'll forget of the fact that they were even acting at all, let alone whom they were portrayed by. The very underrated Johnny Depp clearly proves that he's a worthy actor who'll be willing to do anything for whatever roll that strikes his taste (rather than those that would strike moviegoers'), as this one had following his approbation upon Thompson's inspirational book, which also had an affect upon Benicio Del Toro, who, when gaining that much weight for a roll, you know he's committed. (And did you see Depp's bold scalp? It was amazing!)",1001203200,,5182,4.896473265073948

If you are of above average intelligence and have ever experienced and altered state you will get it. In any case, as your lawyer I would advise you to give it a try.
The film is a great adaptation of Thompsons book of the same title. I had already read the book years prior to when this film came out. I was impressed. It can be mind candy. It can be a critical look at the excess that is America. It can be pointless rambling. In any case, it is pure Thompson - which Depp does a fantastic job portraying.
The one thing about this film is it was quite a journey seeing it on the big screen. When my buddy & I left the theater and walked outside to the car WE felt like we were the ones taking part in ""the trip"". So I must applaud Gilliam for ""really driving it home"".

61482,4,0783229569,"Hunter S. Thompson's seminal Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was a twisted, paranoid composite of two trips he and his attorney made to Vegas in the early seventies while Thompson was working for Rolling Stone. His vain attempt to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race and a District Attorney's conference on drugs tailspins into a mescaline, speed, and alcohol fueled vision quest in search of the American Dream. The movie glosses over most of the deeper parts of the story, but the first half of the movie creates a good illusion of fidelity to the first half of the book. Unfortunately, the second half glosses over more than just the deeper parts of the book and the viewer gets the impression that Gilliam was just trying to get the movie in the can and be done with it. The second half of Fear and Loathing eerily reminds me of the second half of David Lynch's adaptation of Frank Herbert's epic novel, Dune.
Both Depp (Hollywood's most underappreciated actor) and Del Toro (who was all but unrecognizable due to the weight difference) did a superb job with the material they were given. If any filmaker ever has the guts to portray Hunter Thompson again, (e.g. a film version of his semi-fictional ""The Rum Diary"") Depp is the man for the job. Its good to see Del Toro out of his stereotyped criminal role; he is a very versatile actor.
The final score: If you are already an HST freak AND a Monty Python freak, this movie is worth the viewing, just don't expect anything more than a visually lush journey into drug induced decadence.

The story is meaningless as is the plot, just a couple of guys with a lot of drugs and a lot of cash who spend a frenzied weekend in Las Vegas.
One of the successes of this movie, which decidedly is not for everyone, is that it manages to get into the head of the drug takers who just keep going and going and going.  They are true ""garbage heads"", which means they take everything and anything in any and all combinations.  There's lots of LSD, cocaine, uppers, downers, poppers, grass, and a seemingly unlimited supply of pharmaceuticals.  They take these drugs constantly, in every scene, and special visual effects recreate their internal trips.  It's hilariously funny and also disgusting, especially the vomit scenes which I'm especially sensitive to.

Taking along his lawyer Dr.  Gonzo(Recent Oscar winner Benicio Del Toro;  Traffic,  Snatch,  The Usual Suspects),  they embark on a drug-induced farcical journey into Las Vegas where anything can happen and often does.

The film wastes absolutely no time in starting the mind-bending narcotic adventure that is rampant throughout the rest of the film. A lot of the humor and interaction that occurs between the characters in the movie has to be separated in a sense between what is drug-based honesty and introspect to what is drug-based sillyness and misadventure.
The first half of the movie is enjoyable on the lighter side, with the beginning of the binge of binges drawing out some rather interesting behaviors and antics from the two main characters, played to intruiging perfection by Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro. As the movie progresses, however, the mood becomes very dark, the trip less enjoyable, and at some points it was hard to keep my attention to the movie. It was just that hard to watch. In a sense, though, I think that it may have been intentionally captured in a subtle and unique fashion by the film makers...the essence of the drug rampage that starts with euphoria and petty irresponsibility works more and more in a maddening and destructive way as the marathon continues.

There's not really a story, no motive to  propel these characters onward, and there's no moral tied up in a bow at  the end.  However, this is the most literal translation of a novel to film  that I have seen, and it's one hell of a ride.  Johnny Depp is outstanding  as Hunter S. Thompson/Raul Duke, complete with crippling paranoia and hand  gestures.  As usual Benicio Del Toro is great, and the revolving cast of  thousands never tries to steal the show.  The movie slows down during the  second half, but it doesn't diminish the fun that derives from watching  these fictional (?) exploits.

You'll get the most out of this film if you've ever lived it  (know what i mean?) or (most importantly) you have a sense of humour  (preferably a strange one).

You can't really categorize it with ""stoner flicks  (Cheech & Chong, Natural Born Killers)"" or period pieces (Boogie  Nights, The Doors), this movie stands on its own two legs. Sometimes  monologue is drowned in sound effects and noise, sometimes Johnny Depp  talks too fast as someone out of his mind on drugs while balancing a  cigarette between his lips the ENTIRE TIME.
I felt jealous while the  contents of the infamous suitcase were being displayed in an organized yet  aloof game of show-and-tell. Why can't I get those kinds of drugs? Most of  us probably won't get anywhere near this type of decadence, at least on  this type of scale with this type of context. That's why it's a movie.  That's why he's Hunter S. Thompson and we aren't.
Extreme wit. Very  pleased with the narration. Some parts may even raise your eyebrow (walking  into an anti-drug police convention with a cocaine-powedered nostril and a  suitcase full of heavy drugs comes to mind), some parts might cause you to  yawn (the desert race part is where I get up to pee) and others may seem  groundbreaking (I haven't seen a better representation of LSD-induced  paranoia/skittishness and all-around ""weirdness"" in any movie -  ok... so the bar full of humanoid lizards made you wonder what kind of acid  they took back in 1970).
I respect this movie. I respect the actors'  talent. The book was given plenty of justice. You will get the point, as  long as you pay attention.

Fear &  Loathing remains true  to Hunter Thompson's story, for even as it celebrates the  absurdity of life as seen 'with a head full of acid,' Gilliam/Depp/Del  Toro's film is  unafraid to reveal the most unsettling aspects of  the drug journey, many of which lend  the film its most indelible  moments. This is one of those rare movies which is better for the  living room than the cinema, because somehow you've got to keep up with  the guys  onscreen.",960940800,4,616,4.7075471698113205
61536,5,0783229569,"Although this extremely funny and surreal film was not exactly what you'd describe as either a commercial or critical hit on its release, with several reviewers comparing it to Hunter S. Thompson's book (from which it  was adapted) and deciding it was awful, many people (myself included, as  you can see by the five stars above this review) would describe it as a  classic chunk of modern cinema.
Wisely keeping faithful to the masterful  novel, the film cut-and-pastes several pieces of it for Johnny Depp's  voice-over, most memorably in the opening scene, in which he and Benicio  DelToro cruise down a desert highway in a red convertible. Altogether now:  ""We were somewhere around Barstow, on the edge of the desert, when the  drugs began to take hold ...""
Like many of the best films (such as  Withnail & I, Funny Games and Trainspotting), the plot is minimal: a  sports journalist and his overweight, Samoan attorney go to Las Vegas to  report on an off-road race and take copious amounts of drugs. That's it -  but who said movies need even a half-decent plot to be great? Fear &  Loathing does just fine, mainly due to the hilarious script - but let's not  forget Depp and DelToro's incredible potrayals of the fiendishly lovable  (or should that be lovably fiendish?) pair, and massive credit is of course  due to director Terry Gilliam for taking an ""unfilmable"" book and  making an amazing picture. If there is any justice in the world, people  will take another look at this fantastic, drug-addled nightmare and decide  that it wasn't actually so bad after all.
But it's still not as good as  the book ...",960681600,6,1619,4.755395683453237
61537,4,0783229569,"Funny, garish version of the Hunter S. Thompson novel directed by Terry Gilliam with the usual Gilliam brush strokes: cluttered sets, Monty Python remembrances, funky camera angles, relentless energy and a satirical eye.  His ""shoot me if you find a plot,"" and ""torture me first if you find a  subplot"" style is regressed to after the agreeable hiatus of  ""12 Monkeys.""  Of course such a chaotic style goes well with gonzo journalism on a bad  acid trip-a VERY bad acid trip.
Johnny Depp plays Hunter S. Thompson as  Doonesbury's Duke with the FDR cigarette holder and pastel shades.  Benicio  Del Toro is offensively loutish as Dr. Gonzo, a fake Samoan from East L.A.  or thereabouts.  Most of this is pretty ""bad,"" but Depp got the cartoon  character down pat.  The psychedelic and day-glow sets, populated with  lizards and ugly Americans, splashed with glaring reds and pinks, etc.,  captured well not only the ""fear and loathing"" but the seventies Las Vegas  milieu as well.  The voice overs from the novel seemed a bit miraculous in  the movie since at no time is Duke ever coherent or sober enough to write.  Piping Debbie Reynolds's ""Tammy's in Love"" into the Duke/Gonzo hotel room  amid the brain cell mayhem was an inspired cultural juxtaposition.  Ditto  for the Barbra Streisand portraits.
Best scene: Gonzo and Duke watching a  clip from ""Reefer Madness"" at the narc's convention.  Second best scene:  Duke being admired by the highway patrolman who wants a kiss.  Most fun:  trash driving those two big Caddy convertibles.
One of the amazing things  about Gilliam is how he can make fun of people without their seeming to  notice.  Hunter S. Thompson looks like an idiot here, and Gilliam is really  satirizing the sixties/early seventies drug culture just as surely as he  trashes the cops.  His rapier is razor sharp, so sharp you don't feel it  until you look down and see the blood on your hand.",960595200,9,1913,4.841614906832298

He has taken a classic work of American  literature and made a movie that ACTUALLY RESEBLES the source material!!  Unheard of in Hollywood I know, but Gilliam has always been on the fringe.  No, this film isn't for everyone. It's based on the hazy rememberings of an  eccentric on psychadelic drugs. Thats what it feels like, but it is  supposed to feel that way.

In fact this is one of the  realist movies I've ever seen in the way that the plot unfolds and how the  characters react to each situation with a twisted mind.

Depp is good, but his performance is a little forced.  Del Toro plays Dr.  Gonzo the way Hunter S. Thompson intended the part to be played.  He is  fat, loutish, drug addicted, and psychotic.  Best Scene of the movie:  Del  Toro in a filthy bathtub wearing a suit, tripping his brains out while  brandishing a humongous hunting knife, and Depp trying to convince him not  to kill himself by throwing a plugged in tape recorder blasting Jefferson  Airplane's ""white rabbit"" into the bathtub. The book was a  classic, but I think the movie was vastly underrated, mainly due to the  fact that Terry Gilliam is a master at capturing the essence of a work.  Gilliam is a visual master and he truly explores the effects of the  hallucinatory drugs that Depp and Del Toro are consuming mass quanities of.  Obviously, this is not family viewing.  This movie is kind of like taking  acid, it starts off slow, builds to a climax, and then down to a lull.  The  thing is this movie is like taking 50 hits at once.

Depp turns overacting into an art form with his  over-the-top portrayal of Thompson, and del Toro's performance as Dr. Gonzo  is simply spectacular.  The only problem with this movie is that it becomes  readily apparent after about 60 minutes that the production ran short on  money -- the effects in the first half of the movie (especially the hotel  lobby and the cocktail bar) are top-notch, while the effects of the second  half of the movie are not so spectacular (Gonzo's transformation during the  adrenochrome trip, for example).

I feel it looks like it would have been an  interesting time to be alive (although I'm glad I wasn't). This film seemed  to portray it fairly well. I liked Johnny Depp's acting especially his  monologue on the ""high and beautiful wave"" they were riding in  this time.

61546,5,0783229569,"""Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas"" is yet another example of cinematic art from America's most original living filmmaker - Terry Gilliam.  It is admittedly not easy viewing, but that is an accurate  representation of the state of mind of the film's characters.  Gilliam has  always lent his films a flamboyant visual quality and that is perfectly  appropriate for this particular film.  I think that Gilliam has made the  ultimate tripped-out film that Oliver Stone thought that he had made with  ""Natural Born Killers"".  The film is certainly over-the-top  visually and performance-wise and has memorable dialogue.  The film uses  narration in an excitingly original way.  Johnny Depp and Benicio del  Toro's performances are so outstanding that the actors seem lost in their  respective roles.  Anyone who has tripped and/or been on a trip to Las  Vegas will appreciate this film.
This film should be purchased in the DVD  format since it is presented in the original aspect ratio of 2.35-1 and  because the format accurately presents the film's bold colors and sound  better.  The short documentary on the DVD is an interesting addition (it's  fun to see Gilliam dressed as a shiek while directing in the desert).  The  DVD also includes a few deleted scenes including an introduction to the  film that Gilliam would have used if the Writers Guild of America had not  given him a screenwriting credit.

Unfortunately Gilliam shows a dedication to the  source material that verges on reverence, which is understandable but also  counter-productive.  We are hand held through a picture gallery of  Thompson's world but never does Gilliam let loose and let use the material  he is given for all its worth.
Contrary to general opinion there IS a  point to the film, unfortunately it is really only made in the last few  minutes in an exposition speech by Hunter, and the narrative work before it  is only partially relevant.

It's about two guys desperatly searching for the world  they once knew and attempts to tear down alot of the ""hippie""  ideologies that many were stuck with after the summer of love. A real  masterpiece from both Thompson and Gilliam.",924393600,2,767,4.467625899280575

61616,5,0783229569,"I know this movie has caught all sorts of grief for being so bad, but you know what, it's not.  I believe that Johnny Depp should have got a Oscar nomination for his performance.  You really need to watch this movie a few  times to catch all of the things that are said and all the references that  are made.  It is simply a look at two guys view of what the American Dream  is, and I can't knock it, in fact I want to take a trip (pun very much  intended) to where they went to.",922752000,2,479,3.8762886597938144

Unfortunately, the amusing reactions to the various drugs and the  equally amusing narrations by the Duke himself, were replaced with  disgusting, drawn out scenes of vomiting and attempted suicide.  This is  something that needed to be there in some form because of the nature of the  film, but it could have been shortened considerably or just simply alluded  to and replaced with comedy or plot development.  At least I didn't hate it  completely like everyone else I know.",920851200,2,628,4.785046728971962
61648,5,0783229569,"It sure doesn't! For anyone who has ever vowed a drug-free life, but wants to know what they feel like, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is for you! The extreme camera angles, the blurred, intense pace, and the  trippy (and actually, humorous) naration by our ""hero"" Raoul Duke  make this movie an unforgettable experience. Yes, it't true, the plot is a  little hard to follow, and the characters are hard to sympathize with, but  that's what makes the movie such a head rush. You see Raoul Duke and his  lawyer, the frightening Dr. Gonzo, as they inhale, inject, and smoke what  seems like every drug known to man into their bodies.  Probably the  best thing about this movie is how unpredictable it is. You don't know what  these two druggies are going to do next, and that fact has you on the edge  of your seat, frightened more than a person on an acid trip. ""Fear and  Loathing..."" Is one wild ride.",920678400,2,904,4.484662576687117

If you are goning to waist your money on this, you might as well buy some cheap liquor, get hammered, and you would get the same stupid effect,  but then you wouldn't have the tempation to blow your own head off while  suffering through this crap heap.  If I could have, I would have given it  negative 5 stars. Anybody who buys this movie deserves to be hit by a car,  then pumped full of acid, shot in the knee caps, have their genitals blown  off with dynamite, and then have their bloody carcasses fed to starved  alligators.

Being a very big fan of Hunter S.  Thompson I was very pleased when I saw the film and let out a big sigh I  had been holding in ever since I learned that Fear and Loathing was going  to be made into a film.  My thoughts were that they could never do it, a  book as ingenius and twisted as that could never be made into a successful  film.  I was very wrong.  I was blown away with the camera angles and  affects.  I didn't think they could make it happen but with the brilliant  directing, it was almost as funny and twisted as the book.  Oh yeah, one  more thing, Jonny Depp did a brilliant job playing Raol Duke.
p.s. I  wonder what Hunter thought?",918172800,2,830,4.1847133757961785
61653,4,0783229569,"Basically, this films functions best as a companion to the book. After reading the book, you can see the film as a collection of moving illustrations and images that help make the book more real. As a film  alone, this movie is funny and well made, but generally incoherent if you  haven't read the original.  Bottom line: Read the book, then see the movie.  The movie works best after you know what the hell is going on. And since I  did, it worked like a trippy charm.",917827200,,470,4.35632183908046

I'm a diehard Terry Gilliam fan, I'd go see him flush a toilet, then ask for my money  back. Well, that's how I felt about this movie. I waited a long time before  I was able to see it and expected great things from Gilliam, Depp and Del  Toro and got nothing but disappointment. I'd be curious to hear (or read)  Hunter S. Thompson's take on the finished version of this movie. My  impressions of Mr. Thompson are very different from the portrayal by Johnny  Depp. And there are too many reasons to list here. My advice: If you really  like Terry Gilliam's movies, you probably have to see this film  anyway--just don't come looking for me when you want your money back.",916617600,5,800,4.431506849315069
61675,5,0783229569,"I like another reviewer missed this movie in the theatres, and I now kick myself for not being able to experience it larger than life.  Nevertheless, what an awesome portrail of an acid trip.  Tweaking all night, laughing at  sober people as the drug shows you the dramatic scenes of melting carpets  creeping slowly up the walls.  My favorite scene without a doubt is Raul  Duke, slinking up to the hotel check in counter and loudly blurts, ""Hi  there!"" SO TRUE! Your mind even plays trick on our vocal volume  levels...have ya noticed? Grasping the rim of the counter, sinking lower  towards the floor as the hostess' face almost reaches a three-sixty he  mutters ""What's next.....whats the score here?""

If a 0 was a choice, then this  movie deserves a 0.  There is no redeeming value.  Social or otherwise.
The man whose life became immortalized in Doonesbury, here turns into a  cartoon character drawn by a drunken idiot.  Perhaps that was Hunter's  life.  But as a movie it is unwatchable.
Save your money.  Chug a bottle  of booze.  And sit with your head in a toilet.  You'll be more highly  entertained than watching one moment of this film.",914025600,6,627,4.666666666666667

This is as close an adaptation of the book that you could get and it's pretty darn  near perfect. Johnny Depp  is thoroughly convincing as Raoul Duke and  Benicio Del Toro is just plain gonzo as the all-consuming lawyer sidekick.  Their desert hijinks served as nothing more than brain candy and a cult  rite of passage for college kids everywhere. Gilliam does an admirable job  at interpreting and visually representing what can only exist in the  imagination of the warped and depraved. For that he should be praised.
  A definite must see for all Gilliam, Depp and HST fans out there. Don't let  Amazon.com dissuade from a truly uniqie cinematic experience.",913075200,,800,4.773722627737226

Whilst the plot tends to slew a little out of control, so do the characters and the film becomes a series of wonderfully choreographed,  titillating and vibrantly colourful set peices. Certain moments drag, but  these are more than made up for by gilliams rampant style and his never  ending desire to captivate and entrance by showing seemingly all on film  whilst at the same time indulging in heavy symbolism and paradox.",913075200,2,507,5.072289156626506
