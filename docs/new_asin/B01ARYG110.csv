Finding Love
Amos Lassen
Milton and Kendra are two people who can't find someone who understands and loves them. After each has a near death experience, they find each other. Neither had any idea that they are brother and sister by the same father. This doesn't stop them from wanting to be together but the reaction from the outside world is pure unadulterated horror. This is the story of how they try to navigate society and the result is funny, sleazy, raunchy, and surprisingly heart warming in the end.
The film is basically about two people who love each other and continue to do so despite the reaction of those around them and the acting is quite good especially of the two leads, Johnny Sederquest as Milton and Elyssa Baldassarri as Kendra. They deal with  conquering loneliness and finding their match.
Each left their marriage and looked for a more sex-filled life.  They both meet their guardian angels who inform them that they will meet someone and the child between the two will be special.  From their first meeting, they fall in love with each other and they plan to be become life partners.
The two finally meet and fall head over heals for each other plan on becoming life-long partners.  When they discover they are actually brother and sister, it does not stop the love they share  but this gets back to their families back to her family and they kidnap Kendra while he is asleep.  Time passes and Milton becomes the forced lover of a bigger man until he decides to look for Kendra.
While this is about a taboo subject, it is also a lot of fun. There are several very funny moments as well as those that make the viewer scratch his head as he tries to figure out what is really going on.
Lenny Schwartz gives us a consistently funny, beautifully constructed and intelligent screenplay adaptation, one that is alternately meditative and unabashed.  There is audacity in the unconventional manner the story is told and is a movie that is
Not only do we get incest figure into the plot, but also crime and violence, cheating and leather love. It was shot in black and white and this helps to convey the film's bleaker moments.  One critic sums it up like this--- an extremely satisfying film that will make you smile as much as want to take a shower!",1463443200,2,2288,4.6182266009852215

I was very fortunate to catch a screening of this film at Cinema World in RI. This started as an award winning play written by award winning playwright Leonard Xavier Schwartz. Lenny had written 2 screenplays for the director Richard Griffin (Normal and Murder University) and decided when it was time for his baby to be made into a movie there was no other director he trusted more. The film centers on Milton (played by Johnny Sederquest) and Kendra (played by Elyssa Baldassarri). They are both pretty sleazy and debaucherous until they suffer near death experiences and decide to live good lives from now on. They meet up and hook up at the apartment building they both live at. They fall madly in love with each other and then discover to their initial horror that they share the same father. The rest of the film follows the intrepid partners as they navigate through the mine field that awaits them in society as they declare their love for each other and how they could care less for their lineage. The film has some dark moments and a few well placed musical numbers through out. It is surprisingly heart warming as well as provoking a few thoughts about close minded behavior. The film is a tour de force for both Sederquest and Baldassari as well as the multitude of actors and actresses that support them. All amazing performances with standouts Michael Thurber, Jamie Lynn Bagley, Jamie Dufault, Jesse Dufualt, and Aaron Andrade as God. Well worth a look see especially if you are looking for something original and different rather than the latest copycat or sequel. There is strong language and strong sexual content (even though the sex is done for laughs) so if you are easily offended you have been warned.",1454630400,6,1759,4.786184210526316
