It was so sad the way the towns people was so intimidated by the church.

3511969,5,B001CFEBW0,"Ok, I have just finished watching this movie and let me tell you, it was worth the 3 hrs of run time from beginning to end.  The cast was superb and the acting was magnificent.  The well played out plot was as close as a movie can come to dipicting a real life event.  The movie kept much to the real story of the Salem Witch trials, or as close to as the historians have written about.  This movie is worth every cent I sent on it and I recommend it very highly.",1236988800,41,463,3.946236559139785
3511970,3,B001CFEBW0,"This is a well made film - acting, cinephotography, soundtrack is great.  It gives you a fairly good look at how Puritan life affected it's practitioners.  It's a good film to add to your collection, but not something I'd recommend for in depth research as it is partially fictionalized. For educational purposes, I highly recommend the film Three Sovereigns For Sarah, and the book The Salem Witch Trials: A Day-by-Day Chronicle of a Community Under Siege.",1231372800,7,457,5.0
3511971,4,B001CFEBW0,"A good tale and not entirely accurate in it's presentation according to my family's recorded history. Claims of witchcraft fit right in with land and boundary disputes of the period.  A closed mouth and keeping your comments to yourself still did not insured protection against accusations.

 I did enjoy the movie and Kristi Alley did a great job with her character.  The young actress who played the main trouble maker and basis for all the Salem Village terror was the kind of character you love to hate.  I found myself thinking that this psycho kid needed a good old fashioned spanking at the very start of the movie.

It still amazes me that adults could fall for such a sham even to the point of accusing the wives of high officials.  A village so wrapped up in ignorance and an unhealthy fear of God assured itself a black place in American history.",1231286400,5,857,4.598684210526316

I'm sure had I been born in that time period they would have hanged me as soon as I emerged from the womb.",1229904000,2,429,4.443037974683544

3511974,4,B001CFEBW0,"""Salem Witch Trials"" is a compelling 2003 CBS mini-series that featured many familiar and veteran actors and for the most part, stayed true to the historical events that came to be known as the Salem Witch Trials.

The mini-series begins on a rather odd note - it is right in the middle of a trial where the afflicted girls [who are the ones accusing people of witchcraft]go into hysterics and start wailing and screaming, then the accused start transforming into 'demons' [with rather striking make-up and 'flying' special effects]. Thankfully, this only lasts a couple of minutes [the production could have done without it], and viewers are taken back via flashback to six months prior where the events began.

The story focuses on the Puritans residing in the village of Salem, Massachusetts, and the year is 1691.  There is no charter from England and hence, the Puritans basically govern themselves without any written law. Those who commit crimes or sins are publicly humiliated [there is a scene where women deemed guilty of sinful conduct are paraded naked whilst tied to a wagon]. The family that is the focal point in this series is the Putnam family - Ann Putnam [Kirstie Alley] gives birth to a stillborn child and is full of grief. Her husband Thomas Putnam [Jay O Sanders] is a bitter man, having lost a lot of his land and wealth to others who are more entrepreneurial. They have a son and daughter and young Annie Putnam [Katie Boland] senses the tension between her parents and finds herself being neglected, hence her desire to act out as a means of gaining attention.

Things are not helped by the Reverend Parris [Henry Czerny] who in his desperate desire to maintain his standing amongst members of his congregation, convinces them that all the social unrest and calamities befalling villagers are the work of diabolical forces.

Soon, a group of girls, including Parris' own daughter and niece start crying out and acting strangely, convulsing and going into trances, and finally accusing innocent townspeople of witchcraft. Amongst the earliest accused are Sarah Good, a poor woman who begs for a living, and Tituba [Gloria Reuben] who is a slave working in the Parris household. The number of accused increases as the girls find themselves getting more attention and begin to gain a sense of power. The production convincingly portrays the social restrictions of the time and of the harsh living conditions of the Puritans, and posits several plausible theories as to the cause of the 'madness' that beset Salem village at that time - the repressed social lives of the Puritans, the lack of freedom, not much in terms of passing one's time, the desperate need for attention amongst the young, and also the politics of life in a community where villagers frequently argued and even brought lawsuits against one another over property and business.

The storyline is riveting and moves along at a steady but sure pace, building momentum as the horror unfolds - the acting is also solid and credible - Kirstie Alley's Ann Putnam is a conflicted and tortured soul. Her grief over her dead child causes her to turn to a village medicine woman, Bridgitte Bishop who is later accused as a witch, and this in turn causes her immense guilt [for turning 'away' from God]. She is by turns horrified and self-righteous at the situation in Salem. This is one of Alley's best dramatic performances to date. Henry Czerny's Rev Parris is credibly done, acting out the part of a so-called man of God who decries against self-interest whilst shamelessly practising it for self-preservation. Then there is young Katie Boland as Annie Putnam who incites revulsion for her performance as the misguided accuser. Rebecca de Mornay plays Rev Parris' wife who is mortified by the events in Salem and finally leaves her husband.

There are also veteran actors who have done an incredible job with their roles here - Shirley Maclaine plays the ill-fated Rebecca Nurse, one of the accused who also happens to be a pillar in society, a devout mother and elderly woman who maintains her faith and sense of humor in the bleakest of times. Peter Ustinov plays the Magistrate William Stoughton, a man so absorbed in proving the accused guilty that he never once questions his judgements. And there is Alan Bates playing Gvernor Sir William Phips, who initially acts the dandy and seems disinterested but who eventually realises something is seriously wrong in Salem.

The sets and costumes lend an authentic feel to the story, making the Salem of 1691-'92 come alive onscreen. All in all, this is a first-class production and will appeal to history buffs, educators [though with some nudity I'm not sure if it would be appropriate for classroom viewing] and period & historical drama fans. Highly recommended!",1223510400,78,4799,4.930693069306931

Most of the lesser ratings seem to be primarily concerned with the duration of the film, which is 3 hours.  If one is primarily looking for action or light entertainment, it might seem to drag.

3511987,5,B001CFEBW0,"I don't normally do reviews on movies. Salem Witch Trials is a disturbing and sad reenactment of our history. It's very sad that this event happened; humanity was absent, greed and false accusers was rampant. I've never been a fan of Kirstie Alley, but she played her part very well and I've gained a newfound respect for her acting abilities. I never knew that a child... yes, a FOUR YEAR OLD CHILD... had been accused! What a sad part of our history it all is. It is a long movie at 3 hrs and 4 min, but I could not leave my seat. Some might think that the acting is overly dramatic. Perhaps some parts are. But the time and event was dramatic and emotional, and the people were different then in their thoughts, beliefs, and vocabulary. I highly recommend this movie. I don't understand all the one star ratings, but watch it and judge for yourself. I almost turned it off after the first 5-10 minutes.

Put that on top of freezing, starving, and enduring external threats, you have a remedy for driving children mad.  Some of them could then follow with acting out because of the attention they're getting.  These were extreme conditions under which they lived.  I don't know what it is about this movie people don't get, being driven mad by radical doctrine and falling into a catatonic state accompanied with periodic terrors and hallucinations.

3512022,3,B001CFEBW0,"Review of ""Salem Witch Trials""
Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

In this three-hour tv special, the plot is pretty self-explanatory. Its about the Salem Witch Trials. If you're interested in that period of history, this movie is pretty good. If you haven't seen or studied Americas famous witch hunts, it might be better to start with The Crucible and ease your way in. This one is pretty intense, and very long, so you might get overwhelmed.

For the historians out there, this is a good representation of the hysteria of the time. With veteran actors like Alan Bates, Peter Ustinov, and Shirley MacLaine to round out the cast, its a well-acted assault on the senses. Theres lots of screaming, lots of accusations, and lots of fear. But after all, theres nothing more American than fear of different is there?",1498608000,2,807,4.757142857142857
3512023,5,B001CFEBW0,"This is a really cool historical horror movie. The only thing accurate about it was really the setting, the costumes, and the basic idea that generated the plot. If it's entertainment you want, it's entertainment you'll get. I've been a fan of Kirstie Alley since the The Kobayashi Maru, and she hasn't disappointed me since! Shirley MacLaine is also fabulous, to be sure, and steals every scene she is in! The thing that makes the Salem Witch Trials so compelling to modern audiences, is that we can see how it all could happen again wherever ignorance flourishes and rules.",1497916800,3,575,4.818181818181818

3512030,4,B001CFEBW0,"I bought the DVD version of this movie and was left hanging. Perhaps this is just a quirk related to my player (a 3-D Blu-Ray player), but the movie ended with the statement ""To Be Continued"" and would not play any farther. Just today I noticed that this statement appears at the end of chapter 15. But looking at the chapters I can see that there are 30 of them. So, I should be able to select chapter 16 and watch the second half of the movie. I previously thought there might have been a part two video out there, but no...it is all on this disk. I thoroughly enjoyed the first half and intend to watch the second half this evening. The 4 stars are directly related to this quirk and not to the movie which is entirely watchable. I claim the right to reserve judgment on why Shirley MacLaine is burned until I watch the entire flick. Personally, I see no good reason for anyone suffering that way; but that is only one man's opinion. Perhaps witches didn't really exist, at least in America, and we can mostly agree that the burnings were extremely over-the-top; but this is the history of America, a history that must be told lest we find ourselves repeating it again and again. The Bible tells us to 'pay no heed' to familiar spirits, but nowhere does it command us to burn people who are suspected of being witches. Witch burnings are an invention of man, not God. After seeing the whole movie I will be better equipped to review it.",1457740800,,1439,4.393258426966292

Some of the actors in this are superb,but the young girls running aroung squealing did get on my nerves a bit! No wonder Most every person in Salem lost their mind,if the girls did just that! It has one nude scene,only from the back,when a man and woman are tied behind a cart and being stoned. This would be a good movie for maybe Middle school and older children to watch,to learn the history. But I am still partial to The Crucible,which is an excellent movie,based on Arthur Miller's play.

Great acting and a lot of excitement, with some big name performers, but you can't get away from the fact that this witch hunt was politically motivated, based on land and power. If 'The Crucible' left you wondering, get this movie!  An interesting exploration of some of the ridiculous laws that were on the books during this time.  I dare say every American should watch it -- the witch hunt repeats itself within our society in various forms.  Beware bandwagons and puritans.",1391817600,8,642,4.705357142857143

3512072,3,B001CFEBW0,"The acting was very good. The costuming was very good.

The script was - a bit strange. First of all it's assumed that the girls really were seeing things. Most historians now agree that the families were feuding over land and putting the girls up to lying in court. This film has the girls actually hallucinating. So if you are more pragmatic about the events, that will seem a bit silly. It's a bit melodramatic during those scenes, as well.

On the plus side, Kirstie Alley is very good and so are the other actors. And it's still an interesting movie because it will make you think and read more about the events. So in the end I had mixed feelings about it.

One thing I should mention, because this will matter to some families or school rooms: There is a scene in which naked people are driven out of town on a cart. (That must be the scene used for the cover art.) It seems completely gratuitious and it's full nudity (not all frontal but, all but.) Might not be a big deal to most but for some, they'd want to know, so there is the warning. I wish the cover art were not so lurid. Naked people really have nothing to do with Salem Witch Trials. That makes it a bit embarrassing to have on your table top.",1391212800,9,1213,4.265217391304348

I don't watch movies for authenticity. I read non-fiction books or watch documentaries for that.

3512102,3,B001CFEBW0,I got this movie in October of 2011. This is a year later & this is the first time I've watched it since then. That tells you something right away. I got this for a good price {under $8.00} & the reviews didn't seem so bad so I took a chance. It's not a terrible movie but it's not that great either. You probably won't watch it a lot so think twice before ordering. The Blu-Ray wasn't great but wasn't all that bad either. Some parts looked like a dvd to me. I can't say too much about the audio as I listen through external speakers on an old stereo system. Nothing hi-tech. Sounds o.k. this way though. It's also in 1:78:1 aspect ratio which fills your screen. I know a lot of people like this format bit I'm not one of them . I prefer the 2:40:1 ratio so you see more of the actual movie. The three star rating is for everything combined. A so-so movie to me.,1352246400,2,863,4.08235294117647
3512103,4,B001CFEBW0,"It appears this was made for TV, but I can't tell for sure. It's a pretty confusing movie. I have the list of the cast from the closing credits, and I have that from the IMDB, but I'm not sure which is witch. So to speak.

One memorable scene is Shirley MacLaine as Rebecca Nurse. She was brought before the inquisitors (make no mistake; that's exactly what they were) and ordered to strip naked. Now understand, not only was Rebecca Nurse an elderly woman of impeccable reputation, but Shirley MacLaine was also pretty old by this time. Yet she had the courage to stand not only before the inquisitors but before the cameras in all her worn dignity. Sure enough, the examination revealed a mole that could be taken for a ""witch's tit"" where a demon supposedly suckled.

I had always wondered how the hysteria finally died out, and so I'm hoping this movie is historically accurate. I believe it is, since in the closing it includes the fact that the last five accused were officially pardoned by the State of Massachusetts on October 31, 2002.

A very disturbing movie, but well made.",1336694400,2,1085,4.61139896373057
3512104,4,B001CFEBW0,"Filmed in Canada, Salem Witch Trials (2001) is a 3 hour and 11 minute TV movie that I think accurately depicts what happened in Salem, Massachusetts in 1692.  This movie has such stars as Kirstie Alley, Rebecca De Mornay, Shirley MacLaine, Gloria Reuben, Alan Bates, Kristin Booth, and Peter Ustinov.  The musical score is by Jonathan Goldsmith.

For anyone looking for a movie with the subject matter of the Salem Witch Trials, this is one of the best.  The movie is very well shot, quite atmospheric at times, and quite dramatic.

Is this movie a little on the dull side?  Yes, but how much excitement can one expect from a movie that shows Puritan Massachusetts?  Even with its dull moments, the movie frequently picks up steam from time to time, especially during the actual trial scenes and the hangings.  There is some nudity sprinkled throughout the movie.  The acting is good overall.  It's a very talky movie, so there's never a shortage of dialogue.

Overall, I definitely recommend this movie for anyone fascinated with the Salem Witch Trials.  I also recommend it for anyone who doesn't mind movies that are 3 + hours long.  I also recommend it because it's dirt cheap.  I got mine for $1.97 at FYE.",1325721600,6,1211,4.732057416267943

3512116,4,B001CFEBW0,"Two power-mongering blood-lines in 1692 who as founding families of Salem, Massachusetts, crave dominance over each other, using thinly veiled hammers of religion, law, and politics; eventually impacting the children who join in as they discover opportunity for their own fame and influence among the foray.  Puritanism in extreme application plays a powerful part of this drama, where man decides what is and what isn't God's will, as man commands obedience in over-the-top threatening yells, shouts, and hollering, demanding adherence to the one-sided words of men as they thump upon their holy books of ritual, prayer, and hymn.  Made me homesick.  Precious memories, how they linger.  I give this movie 4 stars, the producer gave the movie several stars, among them, Kirstie Alley, Henry Czerny, Gloria Reuben, Jay O. Sanders, Kristin Booth, Katie Boland, Alan Bates, Rebecca De Morney, Peter Ustinov, Shirley MacLaine, Shannon Lawson and several others in this 2-part epic TV production, filmed in Canada.  The original version in USA runs 4 hours, this DVD has been trimmed down to 3 hours and 11 minutes.  Pay no attention to the cover art of this DVD.  The movie is unrated, and was on TV, not meant to be entertainment as a main reason for viewing ""Salem Witch Trials"" - you need to want to see a Hollywood re-enactment loosely based upon sketchy history.

3512118,5,B001CFEBW0,"""Salem Witch Trials"" is a compelling 2003 CBS mini-series that featured many familiar and veteran actors and for the most part, stayed true to the historical events that came to be known as the Salem Witch Trials.

The mini-series begins on a rather odd note - it is right in the middle of a trial where the afflicted girls [who are the ones accusing people of witchcraft]go into hysterics and start wailing and screaming, then the accused start transforming into 'demons' [with rather striking make-up and 'flying' special effects]. Thankfully, this only lasts a couple of minutes [the production could have done without it], and viewers are taken back via flashback to six months prior where the events began.

The story focuses on the Puritans residing in the village of Salem, Massachusetts, and the year is 1691. There is no charter from England and hence, the Puritans basically govern themselves without any written law. Those who commit crimes or sins are publicly humiliated [there is a scene where women deemed guilty of sinful conduct are paraded naked whilst tied to a wagon]. The family that is the focal point in this series is the Putnam family - Ann Putnam [Kirstie Alley] gives birth to a stillborn child and is full of grief. Her husband Thomas Putnam [Jay O Sanders] is a bitter man, having lost a lot of his land and wealth to others who are more entrepreneurial. They have a son and daughter and young Annie Putnam [Katie Boland] senses the tension between her parents and finds herself being neglected, hence her desire to act out as a means of gaining attention.

Things are not helped by the Reverend Parris [Henry Czerny] who in his desperate desire to maintain his standing amongst members of his congregation, convinces them that all the social unrest and calamities befalling villagers are the work of diabolical forces.

Soon, a group of girls, including Parris' own daughter and niece start crying out and acting strangely, convulsing and going into trances, and finally accusing innocent townspeople of witchcraft. Amongst the earliest accused are Sarah Good, a poor woman who begs for a living, and Tituba [Gloria Reuben] who is a slave working in the Parris household. The number of accused increases as the girls find themselves getting more attention and begin to gain a sense of power. The production convincingly portrays the social restrictions of the time and of the harsh living conditions of the Puritans, and posits several plausible theories as to the cause of the 'madness' that beset Salem village at that time - the repressed social lives of the Puritans, the lack of freedom, not much in terms of passing one's time, the desperate need for attention amongst the young, and also the politics of life in a community where villagers frequently argued and even brought lawsuits against one another over property and business.

The storyline is riveting and moves along at a steady but sure pace, building momentum as the horror unfolds - the acting is also solid and credible - Kirstie Alley's Ann Putnam is a conflicted and tortured soul. Her grief over her dead child causes her to turn to a village medicine woman, Bridgitte Bishop who is later accused as a witch, and this in turn causes her immense guilt [for turning 'away' from God]. She is by turns horrified and self-righteous at the situation in Salem. This is one of Alley's best dramatic performances to date. Henry Czerny's Rev Parris is credibly done, acting out the part of a so-called man of God who decries against self-interest whilst shamelessly practising it for self-preservation. Then there is young Katie Boland as Annie Putnam who incites revulsion for her performance as the misguided accuser. Rebecca de Mornay plays Rev Parris' wife who is mortified by the events in Salem and finally leaves her husband.

There are also veteran actors who have done an incredible job with their roles here - Shirley Maclaine plays the ill-fated Rebecca Nurse, one of the accused who also happens to be a pillar in society, a devout mother and elderly woman who maintains her faith and sense of humor in the bleakest of times. Peter Ustinov plays the Magistrate William Stoughton, a man so absorbed in proving the accused guilty that he never once questions his judgements. And there is Alan Bates playing Gvernor Sir William Phips, who initially acts the dandy and seems disinterested but who eventually realises something is seriously wrong in Salem.

The sets and costumes lend an authentic feel to the story, making the Salem of 1691-'92 come alive onscreen. All in all, this is a first-class production and will appeal to history buffs, educators [though with some nudity I'm not sure if it would be appropriate for classroom viewing] and period & historical drama fans. Highly recommended!",1313366400,4,4798,4.930693069306931
3512119,3,B001CFEBW0,"There is something about Puritans that most people do not understand. They were Arminian Christians. They believed one could FALL OUT OF SALVATION. That is why they were so fearful of temptation, ANY temptation, and as a creature of the flesh, we can never rid ourselves of it. Even our dreams will doom us, as one cannot control their dreams.
Some Christians, those of the Calvinistic belief, however believe that ONCE SAVED ALWAYS SAVED. Jesus died for us once, and that is all it took. When we are forgiven our sins, from that point on, they (all sins - past and future) are washed away by the blood. We, as humans, will sin again and when we do we need to acknowledge the sin; see it, feel remorse for letting our Savior down and then try to do better. This does not alter our place in Heaven. We, as a SAVED CHRISTIAN, are assured of it through our faith in Christ Jesus. The Father does not see our sin through the sacrificial blood that Jesus offers.
The Bible states in John 10:29 ""My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand.""
Since they believed they could be snatched away, it gives us a better understanding as to why the Puritans acted as they did. One may want to look up Calvinism vs Arminianism. It is very interesting.",1313366400,2,1296,4.404166666666667
3512120,5,B001CFEBW0,"Wow. I did not know the Salem witch trials were started by a group of frenzied, mischievous, fearful young girls. I have been keenly aware of religious and especially religious men's attitudes toward women for most of my life. This movie draws you in to the world of fundamentalism, fear, loathing, greed and mob mentality.

Worth every cent & moment, this movie should be required viewing in elementary school, again in high school and again in college to remind and educate against these attitudes because unfortunately they are still alive today. While currently not in this extreme, one can see how it wouldn't take much to tip the scales, sadly considering the current fundamental religious world and certain conservative attitudes towards women and their bodies, the planet's ecology and things pro nature.

We say of the Holocaust, ""never again"", yet we still see racism raise it's ugly head today... this movie will hopefully make you say ""never again"" to the craze of fundamentalism and fear (whether religious, governmental or simply our own misguided thoughts). Ruling by fear kills society. Making fear-based decisions can ruin our life or at least take us down a very long detour. The God of all life is truly love & compassion. The god fundamentalism creates is something entirely different.

3512145,2,B001CFEBW0,"Well, the reason I purchased this movie was I believe everybody has heard about the Salem Witch Trials, but I never studied them in high school much beyond maybe a chapter in the history books. Now post-high school I had become interested in the subject, reading books on it and looking for movies weather they were hollywood blockbusters of the subject or not and this movie popped up in my search, it only had one actor I recognized which is Kristen Alley, she did the Pier 1 Imports commercials, and Jenny Craig not too many years back and she was in some movies that were aired on Disney years ago, but I always liked her as an actor, the movie itself is almost 3 hours long and is very very slow a lot of it is just watching the towns people go about their daily hardships like they would have back in that time, and they were just starting  to accuse women of being witches, this goes on for at least an hour.  I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone who is looking for a real entertaniing movie, because it is not, but if you are just interested in the subject it is a good film to watch.  From the prespective of watching it for informational purposes on the history of the Salem Witch Trials it is a good movie to own or watch.  Kristen Alley does do a great job acting in the movie. But the cover of the DVD makes the film seem more luring and exciting than it actually is.  I think they could have cut the movie in half, and left out a lot of the fluff of the town and how the town ran, and scens theat weren't necessary, but it does show how towns ran back in those times, they didn't have a ruling goverment, the church was the so called government of the town. And the church judged the people. It is good that the movie shows that aspect but they didn't need to take over an hour to do it.  Only buy this movie if your truly commited to learning about the subject otherwise you will get bored and probably never finish the movie.",1297296000,4,1947,4.220430107526882
3512146,5,B001CFEBW0,"I was pleasantly surprised by the miniseries which was a mostly a fairly accurate depiction of the events in Salem 1691-1693. It even bought up some possibilities that I don't think have been examined yet in depth as possible reasons for the hysteria such as children witnessing events that they were not ready pyschologically to witness (childbirth, etc..,) post-partum depression and pyschosis, and natural body functions misinterpreted as witchcraft by the dour and fanatic Puritans. Worth watching for a visual overview of the Salem Witch Trials. On a side note, Joseph Putnam and his wife, Elizabeth (Porter) Putnam were never accused of witchcraft.",1290816000,4,654,5.359223300970874
3512147,5,B001CFEBW0,"Exceptionally well-done from all angles!  The acting, script, visuals, costumes, etc. are all something to be proud of.  I have always wanted to have a more thorough understanding of the context for the Salem witch trials, and now I have it.  To acknowledge the political, social, individual, and village dynamics that lead up to the arrests, trials, and executions of these human beings is to face the certainty that not only can this sort of hysterical reaction happen again, it is inevitible.  The culture of politically motivated fear-mongering and greed, the lust for power and control, the pervasive ignorance and envy of the many determines the actions towards those who stand abandoned on the scaffold, sacrificed to mob mentality.  A soothing lollipop to suck, indeed.  This film is heartwrenching, tension-filled, stressful to watch, while at the same time beautifully shot, nicely edited, and offers plenty of detail to soak up.  Conversations are, of course, conjectured unless going by diary/journal entries or other tidbits of facts, but so authentically flavored.  The abandonment of this small enclave of religiously tormented, starving immigrants to their fate by Mother England, their bleak existence full of monumental dangers both real and imagined, must have been sheer torture.  The power of the Church, of the male sex, was total.  Illness, Fear, Poverty, Despair, Starvation, Intrigue, Desire, Jealousy - it's all here for us to absorb.  I hope this is shown and discussed in schools today by teachers with the knowledge and wisdom to due it justice.",1290124800,12,1574,5.256
3512148,5,B001CFEBW0,"SALEM WITCH TRIALS takes hyper-religiosity / pompous, self-righteousness, and mixes it w/ mass hysteria, paranoia, and ignorance. Toss in huge amounts of superstition and gossip, and you've got a lethal combination! This film shows quite vividly how religion, ANY religion, can never be used as a substitute for government. Like the Taliban today, the Salem Puritans utilized ""religious authority"" to enable them to destroy those they considered ""unclean"" or ""wicked"" (or simply didn't like), while calling their own homicidal insanity, ""the will of God"". SWT is an excellent portrayal of religion-gone-mad, using one of America's most shameful events as a template. This is a cautionary tale of historic horror. Though a dramatization about what occurred in the early 1690s, it's message certainly resonates in this or any other age. Watch and learn...",1287014400,15,853,5.46969696969697
3512149,5,B001CFEBW0,"This movie perfectly, and I mean PERFECTLY depicts how religion can brainwash you if taken too far. Throughout the whole movie, those girls were scared to death from the teachings of the church and any little thing they did they got scared and thought they would go to hell. I remember when this movie first came on CBS in 2001. Glad I remembered it and ordered the movie.",1270339200,,372,4.485294117647059
3512150,4,B001CFEBW0,"Just watched the Blu Ray and have to say it was a compelling viewing of almost 3 hours. I am no expert on Blu Ray qualities but would say this was a great transfer. Sound I believe isn't much just a 2.0 but was good enough to absorbe what was taking place. Only on the onset did i detect some weird horizontal shadows when looking 'off-centre' which soon went away not sure if its the transfer or player. I am in Australia with a Region B and this US version is confirmed as region free and played with no problems by me. There are no extras on this copy.

I haven't much to say about the content except to say for the money paid I was well entertained for 3 hours and felt compelled and absorbed by this movie. If anything it shows the dangers of religeous fundementalism which probably assisted in the demise of Puritanism in this case. But alerts us to all forms of fundementalism that humans will create to set themselves apart from others and often with dangerous consequences. This year being 2010 we as a specie are still not freed from this phonomenom.",1265760000,,1060,4.380710659898477
3512151,1,B001CFEBW0,"I watched this movie for all of five minutes.  I purchased this title because I have a better than passing interest in and knowledge of the Salem Witch trials.  One of my ancestors was hanged after confessing to witchcraft and another was on the jury that sentenced him to death by hanging.  I'll guarantee that when he was accused of being a witch my ancestor's eyes did not develop a evil glow that afflicted his accusers.  The accused witches that I saw in the short portion of the movie I watched all appeared (at least the special effects suggested) to be casting a malevolent spell.  So much for historical accuracy.  If you are in to Halloween special effects scary type movies, this is probably for you.  If however, you are looking for dramatization that has a reasonable degree of historical accuracy, you best look elsewhere.  Frankly, if I was an active witch, I would consider suing the authors of this piece for slander given their special effect misrepresentations of the accused.",1261872000,16,995,4.777777777777778
3512152,4,B001CFEBW0,"A good movie about the Witch trials in Salem Mass. The evolution of blame and hysteria into virtual murder for land, pay back for anything real or imagined, and abuse of political power is well depicted. The feeding of the hysteria on itself until no one was safe and until the governor stopped it after his wife was accused  is shown and by analogy has been carried into modern times with the accusers trnsformed into the equivalent of rock stars. The ending is a little weak but overall a good picture.",1259539200,6,504,4.538461538461538

8287436,4,B001CFEBW0,"An excellent warning about the insanity that is a toxic stew of religious fundamentalism, scientific illiteracy and misogyny. Is there bad CGI? Yes, but its pretty clearly meant to be what the women think they're seeing, not what's actually there. The movie basically argues that in a climate of religious terror a foolish dick bag of a minister insists that even little children are innocent of religious crimes, children begin to seemingly go crazy, understandably terrified that the adults around them apparently don't give a damn about protecting them. Anne Bancroft is in the middle of it, but I wouldn't convict her of anything more than cowardice for not speaking up in defense of a woman she knew to be innocent, knowing that it would lead to nothing more but her own conviction and death.",1517270400,,797,4.911111111111111

Fear of losing prominence, fear of losing a crush, fear of being punished, fear of God, fear of Satan, and the fear of being wrong.  Their fears cause the situation to spiral out of control to the point that many who doubt are too fearful to speak out because it is not safe to do so.  If nothing else it leaves one thinking about how this could have happened.",1513900800,,536,4.174757281553398
