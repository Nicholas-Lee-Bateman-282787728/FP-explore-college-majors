8672531,4,B00MIA0IOI,"Being a huge Hong Kong movie fan (particularly of kung-fu/wuxia films) and hearing positive feedback about Jimmy Wang Yus early Golden Harvest features, not to mention my nostalgia for two of the movies on this set, I bought it and hoped for the best.  Glad I did, and Ill tell ya why ~ first, kudos to Fortune Star/Shout Factory for the care they put in cleaning up and releasing G.H. movies.  They are to G.H. what Tokyo Shock/Dragon Dynasty are to Shaw Brothers.  Before I continue and discuss the four films here, a little background on Wang Yu might suffice to put his movies into a proper context.

Wang Yu (Wang Zheng-quan) was a Shanghainese water polo champion before being discovered by Shaw talent scouts.  Bear in mind that a lot of the following occurred before Bruce Lee exploded onto the kung-fu film scene.  Ive read that Wang Yu had a bit of knowledge in martial arts, yet his lack of expertise was apparent in his on-screen fighting skill.  But Still, this was all before Bruce Lee, Lau Kar-leung (sort of), the Venoms & Sammo Hung so it wasn't as apparent in the 1960s I guess.

The Shaw Brothers paired Wang with director Chang Cheh (one of my favorites), and the result was ""Tiger Boy"".  Two years later ""One-Armed Swordsman"" was a game changer for everybody involved.  Wangs last film at S.B., ""The Chinese Boxer"", was a total Wang Yu deal; he starred, wrote & directed.  He must have learned a lot from Chang because his writing & directing was very innovative & assurred.  Also, hes a decent actor.  As a martial artist...welllllll....his ideas make it somehow work.  He shifted the emphasis from swordplay wuxia to unarmed combat before Bruce Lee revolutionized it.  Basically, he established the modern martial arts hero first.

Wang Yu made his G.H. debut in 1971 with ""One-Armed Boxer"" (using elements from his two biggest hits and introducing his stamp - the tournament/one against many angle.)  His 1972 follow-up ""Beach of the War Gods"" was even better, he seemed more at ease swinging a sword instead of his arm(s).  Unfortunately, some things happened that slowly caused Wangs decline; the G.H./Aussie film ""The Man from Hong Kong"" (1974) was not a shining moment, despite Wang getting & keeping his English moniker, Jimmy.  Director Brian Trenchard-Smith stopped at nothing to sully Jimmys reputation.  Next, he got mixed up with director Lo Wei for whatever reason.  Personally, Im not a fan of Lo, besides, who in their right mind would disagree that Bruce Lee was the reason for ""The Big Boss"" & ""Fist of Fury"" success?  Plus, when audiences saw what Bruce Lee and Chang Cheh were doing, Jimmys on-screen fighting skill looked a tad negligible.  Anyway, now onto the films on this nicely packaged set.

Its a two-disc set; disc one has ""One-Armed Boxer"" & ""The Tattooed Dragon"", disc two has ""Beach of the War Gods"" & ""A Man Called Tiger"".  ""One-Armed Boxer"" (1971) is presented in Mandarin only with re-mastered subs & is widescreen.  Its written, directed and starring Jimmy Wang Yu.  Im pretty sure its been remastered; one can see that G.H. movies lacked the polish and gloss of S.B., and G.H. had inferior sound FX.  Enjoyment is up to your own expectations, and its purely subjective.  In my opinion, it never looked better, and I liked this flick.

""Beach of the War Gods"" (1972) is my favorite on this set.  Again Jimmy starred, wrote and directed, and it seemed he was paying homage to Chang Cheh.  At the hour mark, get ready because there is literally a 25 minute non-stop battle, and thats not even the end fight.  Kuan Hong, who was one of the Thai Boxers in ""One-Armed Boxer"", did the choreography, and Jimmy handles himself (and double-swords) really well.  Its presented in widescreen format, and it looks as good as ""...Boxer"".  The audio is in Mandarin with remastered subs, and a decent English dub.  If you decide to watch the dub, a disclaimer comes on warning viewers about how the 70s slang might be politically incorrect in these times.  Example line of dialogue ~ Lets kill those dirty Jap b@stards!

""The Tattooed Dragon"" & ""A Man Called Tiger"" were made in 1973/74, but I don't know which came first.  Both are widescreen, clean prints and presented in Mandarin (with remastered subs) or English.  Also, both are written & directed by Lo Wei, whose canon of work may be large, but most of his films haven't stood the test of time.  The same may be said of these two, but they hold a nostalgic place in my heart.  Among the numerous S.B. movies World Northal had in their Black Belt Theater/Drive-In Movie catalogue, they had roughly ten G.H. films including these two (the only two with Jimmy in them.)  Despite their mediocrity, both movies have their highlights; ""...Dragon"" has a cool opening fight & credit sequence, and a good end fight that includes James Tien.  ""...Tiger"" has choreography & a supporting role by Han Ying Chieh & some stunt coordination by Chien Yueh Sheng a.k.a. Chien Yuet Sun (who cameos.)  Jimmy also shares the screen with some pretty female faces, and he does some admirable stunts.

The bottom line ~ if you think kung-fu movies are chop-socky silliness, and your only knowledge of this genre comes from ""Enter the Dragon""; ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""; and any U.S. re-release of any recent Jackie Chan movie, then steer clear.  On the other hand, if you truly appreciate and enjoy H.K. cinema and want to check out some oldies but goodies from the super-swinging-seventies; click and you're done.",1424822400,13,5497,4.792773645058449

8672533,4,B00MIA0IOI,"DVD Review: In this DVD you'll get 4 Jimmy Wang Yu movies. The transfer quality as well as picture are all excellent. No extras but **** that!

Movie Review: One Armed Boxer and Beach Of The War Gods are the main reason to get this movie. Jimmy Wang Yu is one of my all time favorite Chinese directors and these movies are just wonderful with great action, characterization.....etc. A Man Called Tiger is a fun action movie. The main reason why I liked this movie is because of the Chinese hippy chick. I WANT HER BOOTY!!! And The Tattooed Dragon was a mediocre. I hated that whinny **** who was crying about the gambling. SHUT UP!!!!

In Conclusion: 3 out of four ain't bad. I think they should of put in The Invincible Sword in instead of Tattooed Dragon but eh! 5 stars for the DVD, 5 stars for One Armed Boxer, 4 1/2 stars for Beach Of The War Gods, 3 1/2 stars for A Man Called Tiger and 2 for Tattooed Dragon.",1422835200,,915,4.252873563218391
