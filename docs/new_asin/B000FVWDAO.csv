8127440,4,B000FVWDAO,"I am an adventure racer, competing at national (Romanian) and international level since 2002. Like so many others, I was attracted by this sport after watching Eco-Challenge on TV.
Now I am also involved in promoting this sport in Romania, talking to people about it and so on. I was desperately looking for the recorded Eco everywhere and here I only found the Primal Quest.

For some reasons, I forgot about the particular aspect of this video - presenting one of the (few but big) dramas of this sport. I was watching it captivated like I watched all the Eco's and so the impact was even greater.

I recommend it for all those who are attracted by Adventure Racing. Prima Quest offers you tons of great footages, landscapes and action. However, the way the producers put it all together is (IMHO) 1% more commercial and artificial than the best show I've seen so far - the Eco-Challenge series. These are my 2 cents...",1235692800,3,921,4.644171779141105
8127441,2,B000FVWDAO,"It is more like a compilation of day by day episodes, hastily put together. There is iterview after interview. And very few, precious action. The ropes action, taking place in an impressive bare wall, lasted only minutes. While the get together to mourn a competitor who had an accident and lost his life was repeated over and over. I think is a lost oportunity to show one of the best adventure races, taking place in an wonderful, rugged terrain.",1235088000,9,448,4.6835443037974684
8127442,3,B000FVWDAO,"I expected more from this DVD.  Too many interviews with the athletes, and not as much action as I expected.  I was a fan of the Eco-Challenge adventure race, and this Primal Quest DVD was not as good as the previous Eco-Challenge events.",1234828800,7,238,4.511627906976744
8127443,5,B000FVWDAO,"This movie was alot of fun.  It's really interesting to watch the different teams and all the crazy bushwacking stuff they go through.  Motivated me to do a mountain bike, kayak, trail run triathlon.",1208736000,,199,4.823529411764706
