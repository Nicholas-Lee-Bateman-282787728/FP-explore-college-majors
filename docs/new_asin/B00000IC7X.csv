7909911,3,B00000IC7X,Shirley temple was an amazing actress as a children that has had at best several who come close.  But she was and is unique.  My kids just don't care for ST movies made when their grandma was 16 and I don't know why.,1057104000,3,216,4.0
7909912,4,B00000IC7X,This is a must get for any Shirley Temple fan.  Everyone has seen the Little Princess but it gets better every time you watch it.  The Biggest Lil' Star in Hollywood is a collection of movie she did when she just  learned to talk.  All babies in diapers.  Too Cute!  Although some of the  movies are not in the best shape it is VERY funny to watch.,948499200,7,348,4.104477611940299
