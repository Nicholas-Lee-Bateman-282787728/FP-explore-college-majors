8065401,4,B0009PW3QU,"This is a gripping documentary about half a dozen gay bashers.  The interviewees are diverse in terms of race, sexuality, and sexual experiences/abuse.  Additionally, there is a range of feelings about the crimes.  One person says, ""I regret it.""; one person said, ""At least this created a hate crimes law in my state.""; but one murderer basically says, ""So what?""

This work will make one think deeply about tensions between straight men and gay men.  One man chillingly says, ""Is it better to rob a convenience store for $20 and get caught or to rob a homosexual for hundreds of dollars knowing that he won't go to the police?""  Many of the interviewees purposely targeted gay men.  Some claimed to be harassed, yet using the victims' credit cards would hardly substantiate that claim.  Most important is the theme of misinterpretation.  In many instances here, gay men mistook straight men's chumminess for flirtation and paid for it with their lives.  Bill and Ted can say, ""I love you man!  F*g!"", but men have died taking those comments at face value.

Most viewers that I know point to the biracial, HIV-positive, self-loathing gay, transracial adoptee as the most compelling interviewee.  I wouldn't agree because I fear that his inclusion suggests the ""tragic m*l*att*"" trope that many multiracial individuals find offensive.  I also worry that some would dismay gay bashings as the actions of closeted gays:  Do not sleep that most gay bashings involve majority men violating minority men.  I personally felt most for the black prisoner who killed a gay, Vietnamese immigrant.  You could truly tell that he regretted his crime and felt sorry for his victim.

The film ends by covering each interviewee's sentence and the sentences are long.  I am worried that people may see this and say, ""Okay, justice was done.  There's no need to be concerned about anti-gay crimes if the courts are doing their jobs.""  I would hate for this great work to have the wrong impact.  This documentary was made before the Matthew Shepard murder.  Homophobic crimes are still rampant and often, if not usually, go unpunished or underpunished.

Arthur Dong is one of the most unacknowledged artists and activists in the gay community.  His work here and elsewhere has continually been excellent.  I encourage all people to see this leader's work.",1121212800,4,2336,4.987046632124352
