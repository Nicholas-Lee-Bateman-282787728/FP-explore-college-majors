8276450,4,B001A9FNZW,"I already had the movie Coffy prior to buying the 2 DVD set. I bought the set because I could not find a Foster Friday movie as a single DVD because the Foster Friday movies are hard to come by. I love Pam Grier. She is one of a few female actresses that I am a fan of. But, in spite of the trouble that I went through to find a Foster Friday movie, I did not notice until I got the 2 DVD set that Foster Friday was not nearly as good as Coffy, Foxy Brown, and Sheba Baby, which I can't choose from because I love equally well. Foster Friday got on my nerves because it made Grier look like an idiot. Now that I have two Coffy movies, I'm glad that it did not cost a lot to buy those movies as a 2 DVD set.",1393891200,,706,3.7449664429530203
