4896250,4,B005UZNCB4,"Ruth Chatterton is the name above the title in this 1932 pre-code melodrama. She was the new ""Queen of the Warner Brothers Lot"" having just signed a million dollar contract with Warner's when she Kay Francis and William Powell bolted from Paramount in 1932 for huge paydays. And for all of them the descesion to relocate to Warner's would prove to be an unhappy choice.

Ms. Chatterton was highly regarded as one of the greatest actresses of the early 1930s filmdom, but she and the Brother's Warner could never find the right combination of film roles to keep her stardom intact and by 1935 she had faded and was dropped by Warner's.

This early film is actually one of her better Warner's productions and it benifits from a very strong supporting cast. Chatterton plays the very rich, bored and {ulitimately} betrayed wife of a shady stockbroker {a smooth and supercillious John Miljan} who is carrying on with a younger women {Adrienne Dore} When she finds out she quickly divorces him, he marries his mistress and in retaliation her friends "" enmass "" withdraw their money from his business. Facing financial ruin a drunk Miljan gets in a crash that kills his wife and severely injures him which complicates Chatterton's on-going dalliance with a writer with whom she falls in love - a young George Brent who never looked better and {as usual} beautifully underplays his role.

Plot complication after complication then ensue to prevent them from getting together - some of which in 2013 appear to be very tugid and contrived. But the chief fascination of this film is how a very young, blonde, slim and attractive Bette Davis plays against and almost {but not quite} steals the movie from Ms. Chatterton. Playing a young and feckless society girl, Davis with hormones blazing is also is in love with G. Brent and is ""sizzling"" in her pursuit and he is not entirely impervious to her charms.

Ms. Chatterton gives an outstanding performance showing her mettle as the confident, mature and experinced stage trained actress that she was who knows how to rise above the overwrought storyline. It is fascinating to compare the acting styles of the current {Ms. Chatterton} and future {Ms. Davis} ""Queens of the Lot"" -  Ms. Chatterton poised, quiet with her stage trained voice and facial mannerisms that can portray sexual tension without overacting and Ms. Davis, [who despite a modest amount of actual screen time} appears to advantage as strident, attractive and {seemingly} always in motion playing against Ms Chatterton with a confidence that belie's her age {24} and limited film experience.

I love this cast and their performances as it is a treat {for me} to see Chatterton, Brent and Davis, three of my personnal favorite stars of the 1930's all in the same movie so despite a less than perfect screen play - I give this movie  a rating of between 3 1/2 and 4 stars.",1339891200,8,2876,4.833333333333333

8487195,2,B005UZNCB4,"Ruth Chatterton plays a wealthy heiress whose husband leaves her for another woman. The problem is she's still in love with her husband. George Brent patiently waits for Ruth to come around, while Bette Davis patiently waits for George to come around.

I always like watching Ruth Chatterton and Bette Davis, no matter what they're in. However, I couldn't understand why the story was so interesting or what made them want to make it? Possibly, the point was that the rich, who seem to have everything, have the same problems as everyone else?

The direction by Alfred Green isn't especially imaginative or inventive, just competent. It's a forgettable film with otherwise unforgettable actors, Chatterton and Davis.",1496793600,,716,5.163793103448276

8487203,4,B005UZNCB4,"I have been buying all of the Archive Collection releases with Bette Davis and this was from the ""Remastered Edition"".
The quality of the image is really good, absolutely no complaints there. The sound is ok, I mean, it can't really be bettered unless they spend a fortune on reworking it, it's what it sounded like when it was filmed.

I believe it's my first Chatterton movie I have watched. I wasn't impressed by her. Not by her looks nor by her acting, which to be honest, leaves a lot to be desired. There are shades of silent acting at times, which is weird because she didn't do too many silent roles to pick up these habits and not lose them in three years of speakies. Quite frankly, I don't know what the ""moderate"" fuss about her is.
She plays a character that on paper you'd want to hate, but she is extremely likeable.
As usual, these early movies depict society in a weird way.
Chatterton and Davis are in love with the same man (George Brent, Davis' very frequent co-star), they are best friends (something I caught up with about halfway in the movie) and yet they don't fight about him, have resentment, nothing. Also Chatterton leaves Brent hanging for quite a while, a number of times. He'd love to marry her, but she's still in love with the husband she divorced because he fell in love with blonde snob. He also still loves Chatterton. Why did they get a divorce? Beats me.
Anyway, the sets look great, clothes do too, gowns shine.
What impressed me the most (or, should I say, the only thing that did) was Davis' performance. I have seen about half her movies (despite owning all of them) including several early 30s ones. Considering that this is from 1932 and we have later movies where she didn't fine-tune her mannerism and at times seems really off, I would have thought this movie was made much later, because she is absolutely divine, spot-on, likeable, upbeat, looking beautiful (!) and not overdone with make-up and her acting is really good. I simply loved seeing her on screen. She is on screen for just about 10 minutes in total maybe, but they are worth it. We also have at least one superb one-liner from her towards the end when she needs to talk to Chatterton alone and fences off a man ""Beat it!"". I will most certainly watch this movie again.",1356480000,4,2281,4.523002421307506
