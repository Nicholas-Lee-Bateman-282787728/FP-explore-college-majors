7276116,3,B00ZCIQ3U6,This film had its moments but the overall story lacked reality and the impact could have been greater. I felt that they could have developed the main character more. The relationships also lacked the interplay to make them deeply believable. The racing was cool. The flaws and strengths of the characters were good starting places that could have been explored in a more realistic way. This wasn't a bad movie. It was just an average movie with possibilities.,1447804800,,459,4.897435897435898

7276119,4,B00ZCIQ3U6,"Sometime life takes such a turn we think all is over and it is certainly the case for Joseph when he crashes and finds himself in hospital.
There is however no rain without a rainbow and meeting Elijah is definitively the turnover point in Joseph's life who reluctantly learns to appreciate the older man's humour as he waits patiently for a heart transplant. For Elijah, everything is possible with God by your side, even the strength of living in and out of hospital for the last 40 years.
For Joseph, life without the thrill of racing feels hopeless but his friendly therapist tells him there is always hope and with hard work, nothing is impossible.

This is story that will touch you on many levels even if you are not into drag racing! John Schneider brings us as usual his own brand of faith and the supporting cast showcases well all the emotions each of the characters feels as the story develops.

I give it a 4 stars!

7276120,5,B00ZCIQ3U6,"I am a huge John Schneider fan from way back.

In Adrenaline we meet Joseph Jenkins a hazel eyed cutie who is according to a friend the best street racer around. After a near fatal car wreck (terrible computerized effect and this is my last negative statement about this movie) Joseph shares a hospital room with Elijah Salisbury (like the steak). Elijah has been in and out of hospitals and helps a very angry Joe-Joe find his ""new"" normal.

What I loved most is how all the people in Joseph's circle who changed his life for the better (except for his best friend) came into his life when his life had drastically changed. When he thought he was nothing! When he thought the life he had was over and he was worthless. These people loved him and pushed for him without a history, without a personal agenda, they were there because they wanted to be. Because they believed in Joseph!

I appreciated the religious aspect as well. How none of it was shoved down the viewers throat, there was not radical message about believe in GOD. The message was more about having faith, believing and trusting in yourself and others, and learning to accept your situation because there is a reason for everything. You may not always know the reason. You may never understand it but accepting it allows you to move forward without wasting time suffering and losing out on life.

AND as for John Schneider, in my opinion there wasn't enough of him but I loved him as ""Uncle Paul"".",1442880000,3,1464,4.576335877862595
7276121,5,B00ZCIQ3U6,"I watched the movie this weekend and loved it! It is refreshing to see a great car movie that doesn't have a lot of bad language. And who doesn't love John Schnieder? It was so awesome to see him again in a car movie. Michael Rosander also did an incredible job in the lead role as Joseph Jenkins. I also loved the characters played by Gregory Allen Williams and Charlene Amoia. Great acting, great action, great message. I highly recommend this film.",1442102400,9,451,4.512195121951219
7276122,5,B00ZCIQ3U6,"Thank you Edify Media.
Movie night was a big hit tonight thanks to Word Entertainment's new film Adrenaline starring Michael Rosander and John Schneider.  Our family has many traditions. Some are intentionalsome are not. One of our unintentional traditions is that the girls tend to talk through films until told to hush. ~smile~ This time it was not the girlsit was my husband!

My husband Lowell's thoughts:
""I rate this movie a 9 out of 10. Growing up around racing and cars, I really loved it. The cars were awesome, but the real champion of the movie was Elijah (Gregory Alan Williams). 'You are like a car without a motor.' What powers you? Adrenaline lasts but a moment, but God lasts for an eternity.  This is a great ""guy"" movie. I would highly recommend it.""
My  daughter (18) Emily's thoughts:
""Well made, engaging. The acting was good quality as well as the cinamatography. A good story, wholesome enough for the whole family and engaging enough for adults... meaning my dad.""
 My daughter (14) Amy's thoughts:
""This  was a good movie. I liked it; the only thing I didn't like was that in some parts you had to assume something happened to get the story. Overall, I thought it was pretty good.""
My son (16) Michael's thoughts:
""This was a very good movie. Hot Rods ain't (I'll get him later!) really my thing... more into trucks. But it was a nice change of pace. I think that's the first Christian racing movie I've seen. I thought it was very well made, and the acting was much better quality than some of the stuff I've seen. Loved the cars!""
My puppy (1) Penny's thoughts:
""Why'd they turn out the lights? I want to play! Play ball? Please?  Ah, all they want to do is look at the picture box. Guess I'll just lie down. Zzzzz.""
My thoughts:
I'm not really into racing or cars, but I enjoyed this movie. I adored Elijah. I thought he was an excellent example of sharing the love of God without being pushy. Measured doses to be taken frequently. ~smile~
Truthfully, what I enjoyed most was listening to the excited comments my husband made frequently throughout the movie. He recognized all the types of cars. He commented about growing up around the racetrack, too. That was something new to me. Who would imagine, after being sweethearts since 1981, I'd find out something new? Thank you Edify Media for that little surprise!",1441929600,6,2342,4.642512077294686
