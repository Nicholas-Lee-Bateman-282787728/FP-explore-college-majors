6731717,5,B00OBHYYCS,"Neigong is the practice of breathing, meditation and spiritual practice disciplines which are taught in Asian Martial Arts. This two disc set by Dr. Yang is an invaluable wealth of information for anyone interested in developing internal power so vital in the martial arts.

Dr Yang explains and demonstrates the development of Neigong by explaining the meaning and practice of this art. He explains how Qi is developed continually in all exercises, whether the martial arts or jogging or lifting weights. One should not be satisfied to stay in one discipline to strengthen the Qi but to work both the mind and body in many disciplines to find the balance between mind and body power. In other words, Yin and Yang.

Dr Yang teaches Qi is everything and how it is universal but the mind must be stronger than the body. It is explained that by coordinating exercise and breathing techniques, there are many benefits including long and healthy life. The doctor shows how the mind is more at ease and the body becomes healthier through the techniques learned in the martial arts.

The theory explained by Dr. Yang is very comprehensive and thorough. It cannot be learned through one sitting but should be watched over and over to fully comprehend all that is being discussed. As the enclosed insert guide suggests, the complete DVD should be watched first to understand what is being taught and then viewed in small doses to fully gather in the vast information which the doctor expounds. One chapter at a time would be my suggestion.

This is a most interesting DVD and I found it to be a very informative study of the gathering of internal power via Qigong and other Asian martial arts. Anyone interested in obtaining quantity of Qi, quality of Qi and Qi efficiency should definitely purchase Neigong DVD.",1420934400,16,1803,4.8441558441558445
6731718,5,B00OBHYYCS,"Once again, Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming has been generous with his teachings and methods. You will not encounter hidden secrets when learning from Dr. Yang. He is very specific and scientific in the way he explains the theories he uses in his training.

I like his humble was of admitting that he studied for years before learning how to do a technique correctly. The instruction on how to work with the muscles in and around the pelvic floor are worth their weight in gold. You might spend many years on your own practicing a way that is not correct and does not lead to advancement in your understanding of qi. Some teachers do know how to do this properly, however, because of language differences and poor translation, techniques are sometimes passed on in a less than ideal way. I will let you discover on your own which section this tip shows up in, so that you may fully understand it in the context of the whole.

There are six hours of instruction in this set, so take your time, view it over and over again and practice the sets at the end so you can experience for yourself.

As always, material produced by YMAA is excellent, professional and worth every penny of cost and minute of time. When you cannot attend a class, workshop or private lesson with Dr. Yang just spend some hours with his DVD's and books. It's the next best thing to learning directly from the source.",1420416000,23,1376,4.518072289156627
6731719,5,B00OBHYYCS,"This is a 2 DVD set and packed full of information. Disc 1 has 2 parts and they consist of concept and theory of internal Qi. The charts and diagragms helped me more fully understand the information given. The portion I found fascinating was about what people in general thinks focus is. Disc 2 has 2 parts and they consist of the training foundation and applications of Neigong. All I can say is that I am left absolutely breathless! I thought I was knowledgeable, as an instructor, in my work. But, I now see I have so much more to learn. I liked watching the demonstrations in Brick Root. They were doing this on 4 bricks on top of each other stacked end to end. I can do this on 1 brick. Looks like its time for me to add another brick.

6731720,5,B00OBHYYCS,"This latest offering ""Neigong - Martial Qigong for Internal Power"" is a perfect reason why I am a fan of Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming's dvds and books. In this extensive work, Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming teaches about the driving force and power necessary for successful and effective chi practices and martial arts training of any type - Neigong - and thorougly shows the student via these dvds how to incorporate the concept of Neigong into the student's own training and development.  In these two dvds, excellent training is provided regarding General Concepts, Neigong Theory, Basic Neigong Training Foundation, Applications of Neigong, and specific Neigong exercises.  An excellent work all on its own...along with Dr. Yang's references,  when appropriate, to other works of his that offer the student further theoretical understanding on specific topics.  Highly recommended!",1418947200,10,867,5.496240601503759
6731721,5,B00OBHYYCS,"In western martial arts society, one of the least understood components of Chinese martial arts is internal philosophy, development and training.  In this video production, Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming provides a direct look into the Asian concept of qigong and how it directly applies to martial arts.  Dr. Yang shares over a half-century of his accumulated knowledge with the viewer in this nearly six-hour presentation.  As he says at one point, he teaches you in 15 seconds what it took 50 years to understand.  This alone makes the shared knowledge contained within this DVD nearly priceless.  Dr. Yang comfortably discusses key concepts and teaches very sincerely, allowing the viewer to feel as if they were attending a YMAA seminar in person, or as if the viewer was his private student.

The DVD is organized as follows:  Disk 1 includes two parts.  Part I covers general qigong concepts including definition of qi and qigong, explanation of wai dan vs. nei dan, schools of qigong practice, and history of martial qigong.  Part II offers an in-depth discussion of qigong basics, including discussions of the three dan tiens, qi channels, qi vessels, and qi cavities, the seven gates and two body chambers.  Also, discussion about the Yi Jin Jing theory, qi quantity and quality, small circle circulation, grand circle circulation, and how neigong applies to the martial arts.

Parts III and IV are on Disc 2.  Basic Neigong training methods discussed include increasing qi quantity and quality, and use of grand circulation within martial arts practice and application.  Part IV covers the application of neigong study to hand and wrist conditioning, rooting, jin manifestation, and iron shirt training.  Multiple examples are given for each application.  Finally, fourteen specific exercises discussed by Dr. Yang are demonstrated by his students.  An outtake clip is included for those patient enough to view the DVD to the very end.

I cannot overestimate the value of this DVD to qigong students, tai chi practitioners, as well as other martial artists.  The key concepts and training methods are applicable to any style of martial arts, be it karate, judo, aikido, etc. The video content demonstrates and highlights that qigong is not only for tai chi or the other internal Chinese martial arts.  Rather, it is crucial for success in kung fu training; no style is really complete without internal training.  This DVD provides an overview of this internal training.  Yoga practitioners and those who study eastern philosophies will also likely find parallel concepts and interest as qigong philosophy draws from Buddhism and Daoism philosophy and breathing exercises. I highly recommend this DVD.",1418860800,69,2701,5.206018518518518

6731740,4,B00OBHYYCS,"As always, an excellent review of the theory that forms the foundation of Neigong. It's too bad that western martial arts training doesn't include more information like that presented in this dvd set. However, to be fair, Dr. Yang mentions at one point that he is condensing 50 years of personal experience into 15 minutes. While that is helpful for those of us who don't have 50 years to follow in Dr. Hangs footsteps, don't expect to digest all that he is sharing in this training in one viewing. Also, this DVD set is about 90% theory and 10% application which is actually a good thing because Dr. Yang doesn't attempt to mislead us into believing that you can master an art without being willing to invest significant time internalizing what you are doing. If you are looking for a quick fix guide to Neigong look elsewhere. However, if you are serious about wanting to really understand the ""Why"" more than just the ""How"" this DVD set is for you.",1433635200,3,951,4.6

6731755,3,B00OBHYYCS,"Neigong is a tough subject to tackle, and I think Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming offers a very broad, comprehensive introduction to the subject.  I think this would be an excellent introduction for someone who is new to the subject.

That said, I was really disappointed by the lack of practical exercise instruction.  There are many demonstrations of student's practicing neigong, but there is no instruction for the student to begin their own practice at home.  Dr. Yang mostly just presents theory and gives the students a strong theoretical basis, but doesn't give the student the tools necessary to incorporate that theory into their own practice.

I was a little disappointed, but maybe I had set my expectations too high.  I enjoy the YMAA material and the high quality of instruction they usually contain.",1428883200,23,802,5.037878787878788
6731756,4,B00OBHYYCS,"This is a very solid instructional video. Dr. Yang does an excellent job of giving synopses of what comprises qigong, theories of physical and internal development, and some demonstration and guidance through what I would consider intermediate neigong practices. I thought the demonstration of four gates breathing, small and large circulation practice, etc. by Dr. Yang with slightly more exaggerated body movements and explanation was very good and useful.

What I am most pleased with is Dr. Yangs emphasis on the importance of relaxation and on producing a real, kinesthetic, feeling in the body as a primary method of neigong practice rather than use of simple visualization.  The development of a feeling whether a physical sensation or an awareness of an emotional state is very different from using visualization.  I have heard this core principle repeated numerous times from knowledgeable neigong and qigong practitioners, and I feel it is too often absent from publicly available materials.

In my opinion, the theory and exercises presented in this DVD make it most appropriate for students of wushu kungfu in the Shaolin family of lineage or students of Karate Do wishing to deepen and expand their practice.  The video includes extensive theoretical discussion (i.e. a lot of lecture material) with brief demonstrations of how to apply the concepts in practice. Dr. Yang does an excellent job of offering an accessible and useful synopsis of these ideas. The very last portion of the video gives examples of students at the YMAA retreat center in California demonstrating several different neigong and qigong exercises.

The only criticism I have for this portion of the video is that the examples are given largely as demonstration without any concurrent instruction as to how they are performing the exercises.  I think if you paid careful attention to Dr. Yangs lecture and demonstrations, you can likely catch the trick of what they are practicing (in particular if you are familiar with wushu kungfu or karate do training methods), but I think some detailed instruction would have been helpful.

Of course, the main thrust of this video is to work with neigong exercise so of primary importance would be to apply the demonstrated exercises (or any technique you might already be familiar with) with the proper relaxation and internal feeling.  In that sense, I think this video is very successful in helping students to expand their training in that direction.",1427760000,3,2479,5.192982456140351
6731757,5,B00OBHYYCS,"This NeiGong DVD set is essential for modern martial arts practitioners.

Dr. Yang expertly demystifies the practices of generating internal power through lucid discussion involving both modern science, and ancient Chinese theory.

Many martial teacher will simply show you the methods that you are supposed to practice - and after years you may (or may not) find success.  What makes Dr. Yang Jwing Ming's teaching unique is that he show's you the THEORY behind the practices, so that you can cut off wasted time and get right to the core of the training.

As a martial artist with practices from my own teachers, I find Dr. Yang's insights to help illuminate what I am already doing, and give me new perspectives with which to view my traditions.",1427673600,2,748,4.866141732283465

He has an uncanny ability to use his knowledge of western sciences and adapt the theory and practicum of qigong into a format easily understood by Western society. This video is a continuation of his series on qigong so I would highly suggest reading his prior works beforehand. He is really good about ""reviewing"" previous content in the first part of his books/videos while also delving a little deeper into it each time. Having been lucky enough to visit up at the retreat and practice the exercises in this video I would highly suggest it as it is a wonderful experience.",1426809600,,631,4.592920353982301
