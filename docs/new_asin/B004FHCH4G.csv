8427833,2,B004FHCH4G,"I hate to be negative. What's the purpose if I can't change reality? However, sometimes I feel there's a need. They tried hard, very hard. Too hard, so acting is below standards, and the script is heavy. The best is Salome's dance. The music is very good at that point, her dancing is good too even when she does a lot rolling in the sand if that is dancing. She's not the kind of beauty that will mesmerize a king or a potentate or somebody like you. Her body lacks the voluptuous forms so much loved by Tinto Brass, as an example. Well, she lacks splendor. Oh, just forget it.",1425945600,4,578,4.263636363636364

8427836,2,B004FHCH4G,I expected something explicit. What I got was the age old story of the step-daughter of Herod. It was nice for a T.V. movie but not worth buying.,1391731200,2,145,4.214285714285714
8427837,3,B004FHCH4G,"Born in 1948, writer/director Claudio Sestieri has only eight movie and tv productions (1980-2005) listed on IMDb. The Salome film is a modernization of the Oscar Wilde play. Sestieri is creative but restrained, limiting the impact that prolific composer Luigi Ceccarelli (43 titles on IMDb, 1982-2005) might have added to the film, especially in The Dance.

Herod is a bantam-sized criminal supremo. Herodias is a lanky worn fashion-model type. Salome is thin, unembellished pretty, with a 20-year-old face and the budding chest of a 13-year-old. The combination set is laid out on one sound stage, and is mostly un-ostentatious, except for a swimming pool with colored lights. Notably, the major entrance to this ""club"" complex is spanned by an English name: The Last Emperor. (In the dialog, America is besmirched a few times as a criminal paradise.)

Though the Wilde play, and the Strauss opera therefrom, are usually obligated to be lurid, psychotic, shocking, actually there's considerable text to be traversed to delay climactic segments: (1) Salome seductively torments the maddened John the Baptist. (2) Salome seductively dances for Herod, then asks for the head of John on a silver platter. (3) Salome rapaciously addresses and kisses the mouth of the severed head. (4) Disgusted Herod suddenly orders his forces ""Kill that woman!""

Director Sestieri, however, exercises restraint. John is unkempt and dirty, and shouts like a madman, so he does not convey that he is The Prophet, inspired by God. Salome's dance is NOT danced, but is a tossed salad of rolling and dragging on the ground amidst diaphanous drapes, with many camera angles and double exposures. Considerably better: Salome enters the yellow-green pool and places the head-bearing platter on a float, and up to her neck in the water she taunts the mute prize and, yes, kisses his mouth. But Herod has already fled, and on her back Salome floats calmly in the water and through a rent in the high roof watches the clouds pass over the Moon so darkness descends.

DVDs of Strauss's opera hardly ever achieve full impact. Best is Teresa Stratas, with Karl Bohm and the Vienna Philharmonic, staged by Gotz Friedrich (1975).",1339372800,12,2195,5.105849582172702
8427838,5,B004FHCH4G,"'Call Me Salome' is the latest entry in a substantial list of DVDs that are based on the Biblical story of King Herod, his step daughter Salome (whom he lusts after), and John the Baptist (who Salome lusts after) - and particularly based on the 'notorious' turn of the century play 'Salome' penned by Victorian libertine; Oscar Wilde. For some obscure reason I got real interested in this play and subsequently sought out and purchased a goodly sampling of the different versions that are available on Amazon) to check them out. The oldest version was lensed in 1923 with Russian born silent film actress Nazimova in the lead role and features sets & costumes inspired by the infamous drawings of Art Nouveau master Aubrey Beardsley - it is a decidedly surreal film experience.  There are a bunch of DVDs based on the operatic version of Wilde's play written by Richard Strauss, all of which set the story to music & song to relatively good effect.  Acclaimed British actor Steven Berkoff directed & starred in an imaginative modernized minimalist production that is very faithful to the Wilde script, if a bit slow in its' pacing, and British film maker Ken Russell presented a colourful adaptation in his 'Salome's Last Dance'. Russell's version is pretty sexy and frames the play as if it were viewed by Wilde himself in a production mounted at his favorite bordello, to entertain him during a visit.

'Call Me Salome' was filmed in 2006 by Italian director Claudio Sestieri. As the liner notes describe, it is a 're-imagining' of the Wilde play - shifting it from a historical Judean setting to a modern mafioso milieu.  King Herod becomes a godfather-esque figure surrounded by his family and crime syndicate members as they are all participating in the requisite full moon banquet party.  The plotting is quite faithful to Wilde's play, though the dialogue has been altered & up-dated in parts to suit the contemporary gangster setting.  In tone, Sestieri's vision is probably closest to the Ken Russell film in that it presents a stylized staging and lots of nudity to allude to the decadence of the environment. Generally the device of transposing the action to a Soprano-like setting is successful but (for my money) the main thing that lifts this production to a new level is the casting of Italian beauty Carolina Felline as Salome - definitely the hottest looking actress in all of the 'franchises' (previously noted) incarnations. The character of Salome is a capricious, blossoming, teenage girl whose beauty hypnotizes men and it is the rejection of her lustful advances by the pious John the Baptist that spurs her to her vengeful demand for his head on a platter.  The 'high-light' of any Salome production is the famous 'dance of the seven veils' striptease sequence where Salome uses her youthful charms to extract a promise from Herod to fulfill any wish she makes and Ms Fellene's naked writhings are the most (tastefully) explicit of any of the versions available.  All of the acting is strong and the production values are good - even if this version is not the 'truest' to Wilde's work, it certainly, finally, provides a Salome who visually fulfills the expectations of the role and provides a fresh slant on the classic drama for modern audiences!  The film is in Italian with English sub-titles - the widesceen format apparently chops a little off the edges of the frame (but nothing critical) and there are some production stills & the Italian language trailer for the film as 'extras'... a very enjoyable watch... recommended for any Salome fans out there.",1305676800,30,3584,4.910743801652893
8427839,5,B004FHCH4G,"The legend of Salome and John the Baptist gets a modern day overhaul in this excellent adaptation based on an idea by Oscar Wilde.  Director Claudio Sestieri pulls out all the stops but never goes for the grossout gore and excessive sex like Director Tinto Brass's 'CALIGULA'.  The film takes place in a warehouse atmosphere resembling a Disco nightclub and King Herod is portrayed like a Mafia crime boss who has John held prisoner on site.  Salome is smitten with him(or is she) and manages to seduce everyone into her power.  After her legendary dance, she naturally asks for the token head of John with disastrous results for the realm.  Director Ken Russell attempted the same premise with his 'SALOME'S LAST DANCE'-1988 but it plunged into sheer farce.  Director Sestieri gives his version a serious tone and the production values will remind you of Director Federico Fellini's 'SATYRICON'-1970 and Julie Taymor's Shakesperian adaptations 'TITUS'- 2000 and 'THE TEMPEST'-2009.  The scene between Salome excellently played by Carolina Felline floating in a swimming pool with John's head on a plate is incredible.  This is the type of cinema that they used to make in the seventies and its refreshing in a way to view something like this after all the bloated big budget epics of the modern day cinema will be forgotten.  Mya Communication releases it in a pristine 1.85 transfer with rich colors in Italian with English subtitles with a photo gallery the only extra.  If you approach cinema with an open mind and disgard many of its trappings, you will love this film.  Although released in 2005, it's as fresh now as when it was released and places it in good company in the annals of erotic cinema.",1304899200,30,1706,4.888888888888889
