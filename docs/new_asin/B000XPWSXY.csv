8229207,3,B000XPWSXY,"The ""Bob Rizzo: My First Pointe Shoes-Ballet Dance Shoes"" DVD was just okay, in my opinion.

I wish it would have had a bit more information on exercises that you can do to build strength in the ankles (in general, I think most dancers already know some, but) it would have been a nice addition to the video.

As well, I would have liked to see how a beginner goes from demi-pointe to ""over-the-toe"".... as that kind of balance does not come naturally, to many of us. We can get en pointe, but working on going over the toe properly is sometimes challenging and I wish that had been addressed.

Over all, It was okay. I do, however, think a few additions (and it was a short video, so I think they could have spent more time) would have made all the difference in making this a better DVD.

But I do still use it. I haven't found much better anywhere else.",1406937600,,856,4.265432098765432

8229209,2,B000XPWSXY,"I got this video expecting an introduction to pointe work for a beginner's level, many of the excercises seemed just too dangerous without going over enough details on how to do them properly. Even sewing of the ribbons was glossed over and lacked close ups.

Overall, I felt that it lacked detail that a beginner would seriously need to start pointe properly. The basic techniques of rolling on to pointe were not iterated and some of the barre and center pointe work seemed rather dangerous for a beginner. I would have liked to have seen more disecting of going en pointe itself and more closeups.",1156118400,3,600,4.714285714285714
