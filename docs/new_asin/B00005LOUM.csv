1622871,4,B00005LOUM,"The thing I know about the movie is that according to the Internet Move Database, The person who's the voice of Ping! the Dog is Brian Donovan, the same person who played Digimon Season 2 character Davis Motamiya (remember that show).",1071792000,,234,4.7317073170731705
7944144,5,B00005LOUM,"Ping is a true hero in the ""Home Alone"" tradition. This was very well done. Normally the sort of film which when described I would avoid, this was surprisingly fun. This has got to be the most handsome, most talented chihuahua in the acting talent pool today. I don't normally even like chihuahuas, but this one had the most expressive eyes and projected the sweetest disposition--perfect for contrast with the smart-mouthed but seldom predictable dialog the clever scriptwriter produced for this film. And Shirley Jones was no slouch either! Kudos to whoever set up the stunts and shots.",1518912000,,588,5.010204081632653
7944145,5,B00005LOUM,You will love this sweet and adorable movie. It will crack you up. As you watch Ping get the best of these bumbling burglars! This move will have you wanting to watch it time and time again! It is a five star plus movie!,1511308800,,220,4.0227272727272725

7944148,5,B00005LOUM,"This is the 2nd request to review this move. Ping, the dog is pretty good but I think the cats in it are funny. It's a cute movie and I like it.",1428796800,,144,3.53125
7944149,5,B00005LOUM,"great funny movie,love that dog",1403740800,,31,5.4
7944150,5,B00005LOUM,"I had seen this movie years ago, and in looking for something different  for the grandkids to watch thought of this. It is hilarious and kind of on the same line as Home Alone but instead the dog does all the  things to protect his home instead of the little boy. Good acting by Judge Reinhold also if you are a fan of his .",1374192000,,324,3.9692307692307693
7944151,5,B00005LOUM,"This movie is a great family movie. My 6 and 9 year olds love it. It is very funny story about a dog that just wants a family and a home. He finally gets one, and has to defend it from would be robbers and the IRS. He also has to win the heart of a very sad little girl.",1335744000,,270,3.5166666666666666
7944152,5,B00005LOUM,"i love this movie. i own this movie and its so funny and cute. i watched it over and over and over again. ""Go Ping!""",1328054400,,116,3.68
7944153,5,B00005LOUM,"I'm not going to analyze the plot, the action, or the acting.  The point of the movie is not intended to be serious.  Of course a Chihuahua could not really attach itself to a kite and go hang-gliding from the second floor, but it's funny stuff to a kid.  A Chihuahua plays a lot of funny tricks on two clumsy burglars who just keep coming back for more.  My daughter is 7 years old and has almost worn this movie out.  She wants me to watch it with her, and I don't even mind.  It's a cute movie.  We even have a Chihuahua that looks like Ping.  We had already owned the movie for over a year when we got the dog for my daughter's birthday.  It didn't even occur to us until we got the movie out to watch it again that we had bought a Ping look-alike!",1104019200,4,752,3.9932885906040267
