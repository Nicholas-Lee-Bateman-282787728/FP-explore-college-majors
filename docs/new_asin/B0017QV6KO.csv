3174951,3,B0017QV6KO,"I got this dvd as a bonus for buying MGS4.  The dvd lists the events of the Metal Gear saga in chronological order.  Listing them from the events of MGS 3, to MGS 1, to MGS 2 and ends at the prologue to MGS 4.  Its a good watch for people who are picking up the Metal Gear storyline from the 4th one and want to catch up with the storyline.  It's basically a bunch of in game movie shots with someone narrating about the events in the form of a documentary.  The entire dvd is in subtitles and you can't turn them off.  The dvd also has trailers for MGS 4 from all the different conventions that they were shown.  I haven't watched them all, but so far they are all in Japanese, so the subtitles come in handy there.
Overall, I enjoyed the dvd but would not recommend it to other people to buy.  It was a great bonus with MGS 4, but I sure wouldn't buy it on its own.",1213574400,21,867,3.9710982658959537

8266923,2,B0017QV6KO,"As a long time fan of Metal Gear it pains me to rate a Metal Gear item so low, however Metal Gear Saga Volume 2 leaves me no choice with its lack luster delivery of the MG story arc.  My fianc was curious of the story herself wondering why she can't pull me away from Phantom Pain.  Instead of making her sit through each game or listening to me explain the story and how each character correlate, which both options would literally take hours if not days, I hoped the Metal Gear Saga Volume 2 would of delivered the packed story in full for both of us to enjoy.

The only thing you will take away from this DVD if you have never played or heard of MG before is that it's a big family of snakes, and they all don't play nice with each other.  It gives you a brief description of Big Boss and The Boss.  It gives you the shortened versions of incidents that Solid Snake had participated in from Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake, Metal Gear Solid, and Metal Gear Solid 2.  Zero incite on any characters that participated in the events other than pictures on the screen saying they were involved.  For a game story that was 20 years old at the time trying to fit that in 40 minutes does nobody justice.

This was a preorder item you received for free with the preorder of Metal Gear Solid 4.  I know it wouldn't contain much from MGS4, but give a little incite on the past story at least!  Don't show this to newcomers to the MG series as it will leave them confused and may dismiss the game entirely.  Even at $8 it's too much for a DVD you will watch once and most likely never watch again for how much it doesn't explain.  If you're the diehard fan that has to have it then by all means grab it.  But you'll do be writing a similar review.",1444521600,,1743,4.151785714285714
8266924,4,B0017QV6KO,"This disc contains a 23 min 'documentary' on the events leading up to mgs4  (mostly excluding 3)
But the cool thing about it, it's worded as if it's a documentary straight from the game world,
they state the events in the way the public would see and hear about them not exactly as they are shown in the game.
This keeps it from being just a narration over footage over the first few games. but not enough to make it essential.
if nothing else, it's a nice way to re-experience the story, but I would have preferred a 'making of' style video.
Much like 'Metal Gear Saga Volume 1' (which covered much more content, while only being a few mins longer)

Remember this was a bonus disc that came with the special version of the game, it's not meant to be a stand alone product,
it's made for die-hard fans, (even if it dose not have any new info)

also it has a few different trailers for the game, so that's nice too.

With shipping I paid about $5 for this, and for around that price it's worth it for me.",1442620800,,1003,4.2356020942408374
8266925,4,B0017QV6KO,a little short and small I thought but it shows u the time line on the story and where everybody fit s in it wasn't a bad investment for the price,1406332800,,146,3.7419354838709675
