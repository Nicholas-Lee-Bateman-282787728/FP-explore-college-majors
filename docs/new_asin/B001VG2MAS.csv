8346334,4,B001VG2MAS,"It would be a wonderful movie it they left it alone without all the cuts they did. You are watching a good part and abut to see the best of it, but they cut you short, and they move to a different seen, and so on. But it is full of nudity some are explicit, but no hardcore.",1378684800,,274,3.7413793103448274
8346335,2,B001VG2MAS,"I've seen this film in the very early 80s and all the original sex was cut out and you can tell where it was cut out at!  I'm tired of these companies making decisions on what we as grown adults can't see and we should see and view them , for we are Adults!!!",1336608000,3,259,3.7962962962962963
8346336,2,B001VG2MAS,"I like private eye movies. They seem to have that seedy side to them. They make you want to slide into the depravity of human nature,to crawl through the underbelly of society,a .45 auto clenched in your fist looking to blow the bad guy away. So, I was looking forward to viewing Punk Rock. Man,what a disappointment. Carter Stevens couldn't make up his mind whether he wanted to make a private dick film, a symposium on punk rock music, or a sexploitation flick. So he threw it all into the hopper and made one floppola. The private detective was hired to find a girl. He kept ending up at a punk rock night club(he didn't like punk rock,neither do I).The viewer had to endure complete performances of punk rock songs by various bands which detracted from the story line. There was explicit nudity which got the blood flowing only to be let down. The sex scenes,all two of them, lasted 10 seconds each,and there was some over the top acting by a female band leader which was kinda of funny. There was some gun play which added a little action and there was a twist at the end. But, there was no glue to bring all these different oddities together. The movie brought nothing to the viewer that was worth while.
  The Pleasure Palace was better. It was single themed and much more focused. That's not to say it was a good movie. Two guys buy a cat house,sample the assets,fight to stay ahead of crooked politicians and gangsters,all the while trying to make a honest buck. If you're going to promote sex you have to display alittle. The sex scenes in this movie were more involved. The bad part was that it involved the same girl in each. Guys like variety. A little gun play and a twist at the end couldn't save this one either.
  I'd give Punk Rock one star and Pleasure Palace two stars. If you like punk rock music you might like this package, if not walk away.",1257811200,5,1864,4.425655976676385
