7739199,5,B01ENYOKR2,"I love this movie! The personality differences between the younger ""Max the Wax"" (Isabelle Fuhrman) and ""Ellie"" (Liana Liberato) make for some great on-screen chemistry. I also really enjoyed Luke Wilson's character (Ellie's dad) with his distraught father role. The role Joel Courtney (Billy) played as a friend to the girls was one one of his best performances I have seen since Super 8; I really think Billy was a character Joel played really well.

This film seams very real to me - real emotions, real (beautiful!) landscapes, and a real story that I could just see happening back in the 60s. The historical ties to Eleanor Roosevelt, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and Marilyn Monroe really do make this film a true throwback to when times were much different than today.

The movie includes a lot of really beautiful scenery. But you will have to overlook some of the issues with the sound effects and dialogue consistency  between angles to focus on what the characters are trying to say. The cinematography does a good job of telling the story, without having over-extravagant shots that are only there to flaunt budgets.

I am surprised this film did not get much promotion, I did not see it anywhere until I stumbled upon it in the recommended videos. Will be buying the DVD for my personal collection.

Overall, I enjoyed Dear Eleanor so much that I watched it a second time and picked up on all the nuances I didn't catch before. Tip: Watch where Ellie's brothers go after they get their $5, it explains the bird!",1467763200,10,1521,4.746212121212121

7739204,4,B01ENYOKR2,"Two teenage girls decide to take a road trip to meet former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt--and themselves become independent adventuerous women in the process. It's 1962, so they are really odd for wanting to be interested in public affairs. Practically nobody notices that they've left their homes.

They are so eager to meet Roosevelt that they do not realize when they hook up with a real-life infamous escapee from Alcatraz-- Frank Morris, who was convicted of bank robbery. Since this still supposed to be a somewhat light-hearted film, Morris does not do anything innapropriate to the girls, he only wants an escape car and driver. This however deters their route and timing.

Morris is surprisingly a good sport when the girls (for whatever reason) go into a 'dance club' to pick up another relative. He really wanted to take a look around lol.

The girls are having so much fun with their sidetrips that they make it to Mrs. Roosevelt's home just as her funeral is being held. Whoops. And showing how lax security was back then, they are not arrested for having just walked inside the former first lady's home. They even were able to get inside in the first place.

The one BIG hitch in the movie is the amount of money they have--and how long it lasts. Even accounting for cost adjustment, it might require some additional funds. Still, the screenplay is endearing. This one wasn't a huge hit at the box office, but it's going to be a keeper.",1482796800,,1450,4.719367588932807

7739219,5,B01ENYOKR2,"This is one of those movies that from a pretty average looking DVD cover that looks like something a 12 year old girl would have put together in some computer photo art program, you expect won't be much more than watchable, but actually turns out to be a really good family audience film.  In the style of Forest Gump, we have two teenage girls travelling in one of their dad's cars from California, 3000 miles east across the USA to meet Eleanor Roosevelt who cross paths with a lot of famous significant to American history in the early 60's people along the way. Also events such as The Cuban Missile Crisis are occurring while they are driving.  They are making the journey since one wrote a letter to her after he mother died, which the other posted and a male teen friend decided to send a fake reply to. It's a coming of age, feel good, friends are there for each other 1962 road trip movie.  The father of the girl with the dead mother (Luke Wilson) also sets off in pursuit of the girls but his truck brakes down and he's got to team up with the kid who wrote the fake letter to catch up with them.  They travel in a cool old motorcycle with side car, that looks (apart from being blue) like the one from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade that Indy and his dad used.

The movie obviously wasn't 100% realistic, and although I'm sure the 60's were a less paranoid and trusting time regarding abductions, violent crime and stuff, the two teenagers definitely don't care about stranger danger with their encounters.  Being set a couple of decades before I was born I wasn't sure if all the characters were actually famous people, for example was Daisy played by Jessica Alba someone who would become famous in the years after the road trip or just a relative?

Since the movie doesn't have sex scenes, murders, nudity or anything, perhaps this is a movie that those who were alive in 1962 and are now great grandparents could watch with them and point out and explain who the famous people were and what they did.  Dear Eleanor is definitely a fun film, I highly recommend checking it out!",1474675200,,2096,4.468586387434555

There really is just no other way to put it, and I wish there was. Sound issues, bad pacing, poor script with awkward acting at times. I wish I had something positive to say because I can't imagine how much work went into making this. I feel bad, but that is the truth. Don't watch this movie.",1473033600,,440,4.188235294117647

7739253,3,B01ENYOKR2,"This film is one of those independent features which gets little distribution to theaters but finds a home on home video thanks to distribution deals by major companies like Sony Home Entertainment. Im glad I saw it but I had a number of continuity issues with it. So as not to spoil the enjoyment of those who want to see it, Ill not give any real spoilers though. I hate spoilers .

The plot  no real spoiler here its the basis for the film  - is that a 16 year old girl in rural Southern California in 1962 is prompted by events ( I won't reveal) to make a trip cross country in her mothers car to meet Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. She takes along her 15-year old best girlfriend  a kooky character played by Isabelle Furman. Its a 3,000+ mile trip. She doesnt tell her dad (honestly a loser played by one of the few names In the cast, Luke Wilson)  and he follows in a motor scooter (not a motor cycle, but a scooter that I doubt would travel as fast as a car  even in 1962!).

There are two other name actors with parts that are entertaining, the best of which is Jessica Alba as a dancer.)

The film is 90 minutes long but it feels like parts are missing. The two girls meet dome characters (like Alba) along the way from California to New York but, about 75% through the film the scene moves from Oklahoma to New York City with no stops.

There are lots of continuity issues that bothered me too In at least 2 scenes the girls are driving on the left (wrong side) of the road and, at one point, they pass a car on a 2-lane highway with a double yellow line. I realize that this is 1962 (and gas was well under $1.00/gallon but the girls had only $250 to start and stay in motels, buy gas, and eat.

This is definitely a coming of age film and probably directed to younger viewers who, may learn how important Eleanor Roosevelt was but probably won't understand the actual news clips of President John F. Kennedy talking about the missile crisis (without including the section about Cuba.). The music on the sound track is early 60s rock and roll and is fun and I probably would enjoy the soundtrack album

Parents should know that the 15/16 year old girls smoke (not sure where they are buying their butts) and there is a moral issue when they run into a criminal that is taken way too lightly (IMHO) than it should be.

So, The best I can give this film is tree stars, but thats just me. I was a teenager when the action took place.

For those who streamed the film and love it, I will let you know that there are TWO different full-length commentaries: one by the Director and the other by the Writer. No other bonuses are on the DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
