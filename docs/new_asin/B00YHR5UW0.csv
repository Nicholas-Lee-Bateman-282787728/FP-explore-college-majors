7213325,2,B00YHR5UW0,"Whats it about?

A celebrated military contractor returns to the site of his greatest career triumphs and re-connects with a long-ago love while unexpectedly falling for the hard-charging Air Force watchdog assigned to him.

What did I think?

Despite a very strong cast, Aloha doesnt have any true weight. The film skims on some serious topics like military, love, and marital issues, but so shallowly that you struggle to care or even know why you are supposed to. The Hawaiian setting is used sparingly and is almost a side note. Aside from Emma Stones character repeatedly saying that she is Hawaiian, there is little to remind the audience of what should be a culturally rich location.

Even hard-core Rom Com fans, Bradley fans, or Emma fans may struggle with this one. There are some confusing and unnecessary side plots and a lack of believable chemistry between the characters. Aloha can mean hello or farewell, but I couldn't wait to use it in the goodbye sense for this film.",1434240000,2,986,4.851190476190476
7213326,3,B00YHR5UW0,"""Aloha"" (2015 release; 105 min.) brings the story of Brian Gilcrest (played by Bradley Cooper). As the movie open, we hear Gilcrest in a voice-over tell us about his passion for the sky and the military, and how 2008 changed everything with budget cuts and contractors taking over. Gilcrest works for one such big money contractor, Carson Welsh (played by Bill Murray). Gilcrest arrives in Hawaii in connection with a big, secretive project for Welsh. As it happens, Gilcrest also reconnects with his ex, Tracy (played by Rachel McAdams), who have not seen each other in 13 years. Gilcrest's local Air Force liaison is the fiercely competitive Capt. Allison Ng (played Emma Stone). At this point we're just 10-15 min. into the movie. Will Gilcrest make a love connection with Tracy for the sake of ol' times? will there be sparks between Gilcrest and Ng? and what is that secretive project all about exactly? To tell you mow would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from the erstwhile ""can't do no wrong"" writer-director Cameron Crowe, who previously has given us gems like Jerry Maguire (1996), Almost Famous (2000), and Vanilla Sky (2002). Alas, more recent output has not been nearly as impressive. Cameron's previous film, 2011's ""We Bought A Zoo"" was okay but not  great. With ""Aloha"", Crowe goes rom-com once more, but in reality it's more a sentimental romance and very little comedy.  Yes, there are a couple of chuckles, but mostly we wonder how the relationships will play out from the romantic perspective. Most telling for me is that the Big Reveal (no, I'm not going to spoil) comes only 30 min. before the end of the movie, but that the movie really takes off after that. The acting performances are fine, but they have to make do with the so-so material they are handed. The best of the lot are Alec Baldwin in a short but memorable outburst that almost steals the movie 9it was featured in the movie's trailer), and Emma Stone as Capt. Ng. By all means Stone should've won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for that brilliant performance in ""Birdman"". And to think that she's still only 26! As usual, there is a boatload of great music in the movie, both the incidental score (from Sigur Ros' Jonsi) and the songs that are in the movie (Hall & Oates' I Can't Go For That (No Can Do) plays during a hilarious dancing scene at a Christmas party). Bottom line: I have conflicted feelings about ""Aloha"". In the end, I have to say that I find it to be the least compelling movie from Cameron Crowe to date, but that doesn't make it a ""bad"" movie and it certainly isn't the complete disaster that many film critics have pronounced it to be.

""Aloha"" opened 2 weekends ago, and with all of the negative reviews and buzz, I had held off, but curiosity got the better of me, I mean this is Cameron Crowe, after all! So I finally went to see it. Not surprisingly, the early evening screening where I saw this at was not well attended. This movie has frankly bombed at the box office, and I fully expect it to be gone from the big screen in another week or so. If you are a longtime follower of Cameron Crowe, you'll probably want to check this out, be it in the theaters, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, but don't go in with high expectations.",1434067200,3,3373,4.598006644518272
7213327,2,B00YHR5UW0,"I saw the movie last night and j have absolutely no idea what it was about. I was completely lost. Great actors, terrible movie. Not a single giggle or tear in the theater. It was beyond boring.",1433635200,17,194,4.27027027027027
7213328,1,B00YHR5UW0,"This reminds me of the awful movie, Adore, a flick set in rhe Tropics, where the stars got a nice paid vacation in return fir appearing in a terrible movie. I am shocked Cooper is part of this hot mess of a movie",1433462400,3,212,3.953488372093023
7213329,1,B00YHR5UW0,"It isn't always a good idea to listen to negative buzz surrounding a film, but when it comes from the head of the studio distributing it...well, time to perk up those ears. Cameron Crowe's latest comedy Aloha has had a long production history, and not necessarily a good one. Originally titled Deep Tiki, the film, described as ""Joe vs. The Volcano meets Jerry Maguire"", was put on hold for some serious retooling, and was resurrected after Crowe's success with We Bought a Zoo. But apparently he didn't do nearly enough, as ex-Sony chief Amy Pascal famously ripped thefilm in leaked emails. She ripped Crowe for basically being terrible, ripped the film's entire premise, ripped the story, ripped everything, calling it ""ridiculous"" and that it ""makes no sense"".

Here's the thing: she's right about all of it. Aloha is a misguided effort from the boring (and apparently offensive) title to the nonsensical plot, which turns a Hawaiian paradise into a torture chamber of comic mishaps. Given to wild leaps in logic and overdoses of sentimentality, it's like somebody made a spot-on parody of a terrible Cameron Crowe movie. Awesome, gorgeous stars like Bradley Cooper, Rachel McAdams, Emma Stone, and Bill Murray saying a bunch of long-winded, emotionally-devoid stuff no human being would ever say unless they were characters written by Crowe.

What passes for a plot has Bradley Cooper as Brian Gilcrest, a defense contractor who used to be hot sh*t before flaming out in spectacular fashion. Given one last chance to redeem himself thanks to eccentric billionaire philanthropist Carson Welch (Murray), Brian is sent to Hawaii to oversee the launch of a satellite into orbit. It's a project that has the Air Force all hot 'n bothered, so they stick Brian with a chaperone in Air Force pilot Allison Ng (Stone), and task him with securing the blessing of the island chiefs before the launch. Why does he need their blessing? For good P.R. or something, or maybe it's because actual mystical forces are at play? It's hard to say, and Crowe doesn't seem to know, either.

Actually, it's more like he doesn't really care about the satellite or the island gods or whatever, because none of that stuff makes an ounce of sense. Crowe is more interested in the chemistry-free romance between Brian, Allison, and Brian's ex-girlfriend Tracy (McAdams), who lives on the island with her mute husband (John Krasinski). He's not actually mute; he just doesn't like to talk. Why? No idea. Don't worry about it, it doesn't ultimately matter.

Crowe's tendency to create manic pixie dreamgirls for his damaged male characters to fall for kicks into overdrive as we get two of them this time. That Allison is supposedly a serious-minded, if somewhat odd, military official is immediately undercut by her childish infatuation with Brian. She's not a character we can believe in for a single moment, but at least with Stone in the role she's fun to have around. Tracy, on the other hand, is a complete drag and a total blank slate as a person. She only exists to give Brian someone to angst over and occasionally argue with in vastly overwritten fashion. Their romantic past is one full of disappointments, but when the whole story comes out it's anticlimactic, certainly not enough to hold our attention. Then again, little about this film is except for the gorgeous Hawaiian locale shot beautifully by cinematographer Eric Gautier. And of course the eclectic soundtrack is exceptional, although Crowe seems to be leaning harder on it this time to create the emotional resonance his script simply doesn't.

As tonally misjudged as Elizabethtown and twice as disappointing, Aloha at least gave its cast a sweet paid vacation to Hawaii. And someone remember to send Ms. Pascal a ""thank you"" note for trying to warn us. That lady deserves a promotion.",1433376000,73,3833,4.973478939157566
7213330,4,B00YHR5UW0,"I loved this movie. It was a little cheesy, but it was cute, and funny and well directed. The cast was great, Bradley Cooper was amazing, he has so much charm and Emma Stone and Rachel McAdams were also great.",1433203200,10,209,4.25
7213331,5,B00YHR5UW0,"Aloha

 Oscar winning Writer Cameron Crowe also Directs Aloha as he has directed so successfully in the past with Almost Famous, We Bought a Zoo and Jerry Maguire.  His work fascinates, informs and to some degree enlightens.  He has the touch and it shows never brighter than in the complex, plot heavy triumph that makes up Aloha.
 This is not a simple cute-a-thon between Rachel McAdams and Emma Stone, although fans of these two accomplished and attractive actresses might think of it that way.
 Bradley Cooper plays Brian Gilcrest, an ex-military heavy hitter in the civilian contractor community.  His assignment inolves negotiating with the head of the Hawaiian Native political movement on behalf of Carson Welch, a megalomaniac billionaire defense magnate who has a space rocket launching facility in Hawaii.  Assigned to Gilcrest as a minder we have a hard charging young female fighter pilot.  We also meet his ex-girlfriend, now married to another Air Force Pilot and raising two kids.  Let's see, romance, possible adultery, Hawaiian Native politics, James Bond style super villain and Cooper as the still charismatic but damaged and perhaps broken leading man.  Don't neglect a couple of comic roles by Alec Baldwin and Danny McBride and a richly funny exercise in Man Speak Without Words between Bradley Cooper and John Krasinski (the pilot husband). If you think that is a lot of plot for a one hour and 45 minute movie, you think right.
 But Cameron Crowe has the touch.  It comes out neatly by the end with a totally satisfying conclusion.
 Cooper of course plays his engaging but corrupt contractor with his usual sharply honed ability.  Rachel McAdams has a depth of skill that we admire for her roles in such different films as Mean Girls, Sherlock Holmes and Midnight in Paris.  See her in About Time.  Arizona born Emma Stone, still in her 20s, has her first Oscar, and has starred in Easy A, The Help and supported in last years quadruple Oscar winning Birdman.  I think Aloha has her best performance ever, which is quite a claim.  Watch and see if you agree.
 In one of the best bits in the film, Stone has a dance with the billionaire (Bill Murray) that is one for the books.  This supporting role might be Murray's best ever also.
 Even the two child actors, Jaeden Lieberher the grade school boy and Danielle Rose Russell, the young teen daughter, have wonderful parts written for them, parts that they have no problem filling up with personality.  Truly Cameron Crowe has been able to bring out the very best in his actors.

7213340,5,B00YHR5UW0,"The cinematography in this film, is, as you mighty guess, gorgeous. Beautiful views of Hawaii. The two women in the film are beautiful. The kids are really cute. There is a lot of emotion in this film.

The acting is really great! I was surprised. Yes, Emma Stone is playing yet another perky, humorous, charming character. For me she's more beautiful and fun in this film than in any other I've seen. Just wonderful.

Bradley Cooper is great. He doesn't play a sometimes humorous madman in this film. His character is quite damaged, serious, obviously corrupt in some ways,  but kind. He, Rachel McAdams, and Stone have great chemistry. John Krasinki plays a very quiet man, but conveys a lot of emotion anyway. The two kid actors are excellent.

Supporting cast is great too.. Bill Murray, Danny McBride, and Alec Baldwin.

There is a man in the movie who is a descendant of Hawaii's founder and king, Kamehameha. This man's nickname is Bumpy. Very interesting person. There's even a Nation of Hawaii - sort of like a Native American Reservation in some ways, but in some way not. Part of the story takes place in the territory of the Nation of Hawaii. Bumpy is playing himself in this film.

There's more going on in this movie than in a typical romantic light drama. There's espionage, ethical questions to consider, and even supernatural overtones.

Acting: Mostly great. Interesting characters: Great. Script: Very Good. Music: Also great.

Is the film perfect? No.

The audio is not mixed very well at times, and I had to turn the subtitles on quite a bit. One thing some of the actors did on occasion was mumble too much. I blame the director for this. This is something the director is supposed to be aware of. It is the director's job to make sure the characters are speaking clearly, unless the inaudible words are intentional, like in one part of  ""Lost in Translation,"" which is another beautiful film that Bill Murray is in.

Only one dumb thing. Emma Stone was cast to play a woman whose father is half-Chinese and half-Hawaiian. Her character's last name is Ng. (Pronounced ""ing"").

Does Emma Stone look like she has a father who is half-Chinese and half-Hawaiian? No. She is very pale, and has the widest, hugest eyes I've ever seen.

Once the casting of Stone was decided, why didn't Cameron Crowe, who made the film, choose to do a little re-write? Stone could have played a woman of solely European heritage who was a major enthusiast of Hawaiian culture, and that would have worked.

But, the character was kept as written. And the name Ng. Ok.. I rolled with it. Folks who get especially bothered about whitewashing will not like this aspect of the film.

And yes, the film could not have a more generic title than ""Aloha.""

Overall though, great movie.

PG-13 for a bit of language and mild sexual situations.",1523836800,,2832,4.711967545638945

7213400,4,B00YHR5UW0,"I could offer one qualifiable criticism regarding continuity, but that might be too much of a spoiler.  Suffice it to say, we really enjoyed this film.  It was hardly the atrocity that some fans of the book make it out to be.  For the sake of one's own enjoyment, we should never let expectations bias our own experience, whether they be from being predisposed to the story in another format, or from reading other peoples two-cent, in the form of reviews, be them professional or non.  Furthermore, in terms of equating movies to books, it should almost never be done.  If at all possible I'll always watch the movie first, if I know one is being made.  Reading a book, after seeing a movie I liked, has always proven a satisfying experience, even when it made me think less of the movie.  Such is frequently, almost always, not the case when done in reverse order.  There's plenty of great classics to bide the time with, while waiting for the film.  But if you can't wait, at least read the book long enough before the movie comes out that you've forgotten enough about it to not ruin the film with comparisons that are no more fair to yourself as they are to all the people who devoted a year or two of their lives toward adapting the story to the cinematic format with all the added politics that entails.

Yet another solid film tarnished by unfair, biased, internet gossip, much of which not doubt from a streaming subculture intent on half-watching large venue productions on tiny screens, while on the go or otherwise multitasking.",1493856000,4,1540,4.608058608058608

7213402,5,B00YHR5UW0,"A disarming and surprising film.  All characters thoughtfully cast.  McAdams does a superb job of making it possible to believe she could go either way with a choice between a baffling husband or old love.  Her children are drawn with more care than kids usually are, and we find ourselves paying more attention to what they are thinking.  The privatized space aspect of the drama is sketchy, but believable enough.  What makes it all work, however, is the artfully directed communications between the characters.  The flirtation between Cooper and Stone is offbeat, quirky, sometimes hard to follow, and ultimately convincing.  More than usual is asked of the audience to figure out what these two protagonists are thinking and saying.  Communications between people are not scripted in the usual way.  There is much conveyed with tone and body language.  Much of this resonates with the backstory of the Hawaiian culture and its haunting music and story-telling dance movements.  The silent husband has an eloquence of his own.  But the scene in which the daughter discovers the truth about her real father is the most effective and demonstrates how much can be conveyed to another without words.  This is not a movie for those who want the obvious.  It forces the viewer to partake of a more subtle, more compassionate, version of human life and love.",1493510400,9,1354,4.986607142857143

His character development is top notch, and encourages you genuinely empathise with them, despite their faults. It is this true scope of truly human gifts and flaws that he incorporates into his characters that make his movies relatable on multiple levels. The cinematography is stunning. They take you to locations on the island that are seldom seen by outsiders. The movie is very delicate and respectful of local culture, and serves as an educational experience in addition to entertainment. As with any Crowe project, the soundtrack is amazing. The inclusion of local music, and musicians really adds to the overall experience.

I ALWAYS think of my mom whenever I see anything Hawaii and remember her real grass skirt and Corals she saved from her time in Hawaii. It's a truly spiritual place for me.
I thought the storyline of Bradley Cooper coming back and having his heart broken all over again by his ex(Rachel McAdams) who married his friend (John Krasinski), was very realistic and well played. Then the romance with Captain Ng (Emma Stone) was very romantic and sweet. Just a great all around movie with true chemistry between the actors. This movie is an absolute virtual vacation. As always Bradley Cooper is a dream to watch. I could swim in those blue eyes forever. He probably pretend pukes everytime he hears that though. Not objectifying, just mentioning...

The traditional Hawaiian music is what helps make the movie stand out from a generic rom com. The spiritual Hawaiian gatherings make you want to grab your lei and set sail for the Big Island. And yes, there's a tearful ending. And it's a happy one.",1484092800,,1184,4.747572815533981

7213448,3,B00YHR5UW0,"I'm not sure what the director was going for, but it felt like this movie tried to do a little bit of everything and therefore managed to do none of it well.  It was okay -- reasonably good performances, sometimes even really good performances, but the story was just all over the place.

(1) Why do we care about this guy's past love life?  That part is arguably pretty interesting, as it handles it in a much more mature manner than I'm used to seeing, but I don't see what it has to do with most of the rest of the story...

(2) I'm assuming they really wanted his 'handler' to identify with the Hawaiians, which is why the miracled up the idea that Emma Stone's character was 1/4 Hawaiian and 1/4 Chinese; but seriously folks, just hire an Asian actress or don't make that a part of the story.  And if you want to really convince me that there's this 'connection' to Hawaii, spend more time working on that...

(3) Then there's the privatization of space angle and this sort of warning about the inherent dangers of too much corporate freedom and a lack of governmental oversight.  If you want to go there, spend more time on that and less on Hawaiian 'mana'.

None of these things was overtly bad.  It's just that none of them felt adequately explored and they all came off feeling empty and disjointed.  Maybe too much got cut in editing...  it's not bad, just don't pay much for it if you want your money's worth. (And that pains me to say, because I really love both of the main actresses and I thought Bradley Cooper and John Krasinski did a fine job)

(4) Wait, I forgot the one overtly bad part...  the sound wave thing.  Don't want to spoil it, so I won't say more.  But if you watch this...well, I suspect you'll agree that bit of Deus Ex Machina is pretty painful.",1483920000,,1778,4.361702127659575

Bradley Cooper is a veteran of something(not sure what), he has a non-specific crippling injury caused by something(not sure what), and an unfinished romance with Rachel McAdams. Add a wooden, expressionless John Krasinski, and Emma Stone as a hippy-dippy, high strung, very spiritual romantic interest who's also apparently an F-22 fighter pilot, and that just about rounds out this romantic comedy. Everybody wants to sleep with Bradley Cooper which is pretty standard for any movie he's in, and the rest of the plot line is trite and cliche'. There's no chemistry between anyone in the movie and there's a complete failure to provide the backstory needed to understand the relationships or motivations. Even having two very attractive females in it couldn't make this movie watchable. For a truly cringeworthy moment, witness the scene where Cooper and Krasinski do a Vulcan mind-meld and have a complete conversation with each other without saying a word. I hope they both got paid by the second to shoot that scene because it's painful to watch. Overall, this movie does not belong on anyones bucket list and is in fact an embarrassment to cinema.

7213473,3,B00YHR5UW0,"If you are a romantic comedy person, you will love this movie, I liked it and it was nothing very special for me. Bradly Cooper is a military contractor contracted to do a job for the Navy and has to go to Hawaii to get it done and hooks up with his ex-wife, Rachel McAdams who has remarried to John Krasinski and there is a daughter and son in the mix. Bradley in the meantime has a rep for bad behavior so the Navy assigns Emma Stone to keep an eye on him. Well, as you can imagine there are things that happen and things that should not happen and there is greed, jealousy and a lot of the 7 deadly sins too. I enjoyed the story, there are a couple underlying stories to this and they were good. Bradley? not quite sure what his grumpy face was all about and Emma was so perky and well, we got a bit of everything. It is cute and as I said if you love rom-coms go for it.",1479772800,2,874,3.943502824858757

7213536,4,B00YHR5UW0,"It isn't easy to explain the whole idea of ""aloha"" as it's understood in Hawaii. It's not just, ""Hi, welcome,"" although it's commonly used in that way. It's more about caring... for others, for yourself, for where you come from and what's around you. If you apply that broader idea of aloha to this film, this might help you make more sense of the storyline. Basically, Gilcrest (Bradley Cooper) has to decide between selfishness and selflessness - the plot follows him struggling over that choice and what follows from his decision. If the plot has a fatal flaw, it's over-complication. What was it Gilcrest was trying to get the Hawaiians to agree to? That all goes by so fast that it's no wonder those unfamiliar with Hawaiian sovereignty issues have no idea what's going on or what's at stake. I still can't quite work out that posposed Hawaiian/military/independent contractor agreement, which is a big element in the plot, but thankfully not the only element. That said, I give Cameron Crowe credit for making Brother Bumpy Kanahele and the Nation of Hawaii a part of this movie. You could be a cynic and say Bumpy only agreed to participate to draw attention to his cause, but I think the film's treatment of Hawaiian land issues was done with respect and good taste. For those unfamiliar with Hawaiian sovereignty, within Hawaii itself this has long been a highly controversial, often divisive issue, so it's heartening to see a mainland film production treat the subject with the sympathy shown here. Overall, I can understand how quite a few viewers just didn't get it when trying to make sense of this story. You pay your money to be entertained, not educated, for sure, but once in awhile a film comes along that asks you to do some thinking. As I said in the beginning, if you take this film as a meditation on what ""aloha"" is realy all about, versus what many may think it's about, this might help you make more sense of it. Even this tentative, stylized venture into the realm of cultural politics may have been slightly over-ambitious on Cameron Crowe's part, but I nevertheless applaud his good intentions.",1472860800,,2123,4.771739130434782

I've seen it at least 6 times and love it each time anew. The character and actor choices are amazing. The music is so perfect that I'm amazed how they did that. The story is grand; albeit, not necessarily real life in some ways, but engaging, entertaining, heartfelt, warm, with just enough edge. I love everything about this movie.

I turned it off before it was over, because it was kinder to put it out of it's misery than to let it linger in pain (or perhaps it was my pain I was putting an end to). Please understand, the actors in any movie can't really predict how a movie will turn out while they are making it, so one can't really blame the crew for the captain's bumbling through the ocean without a compass.

I actually watched it TWICE in a row because I thought the problem of not understanding the story was with me and not Cameron Crowe, and I will say, I ended up appreciating the movie much more after watching it the second time.  Oddly, there were a lot of mumbling moments with the actors - unintelligible dialogue - but I paid closer attention the second time and that improved things.  Cameron Crowe could have done SO MUCH more with the lead characters - he had them right in front of him and he blew it. (I did appreciate seeing John Krasinski in a new light - strong, silent, and handsome instead of silly, so that was quite nice.)

7213558,5,B00YHR5UW0,"This movie set in modern-day Hawaii can be labeled a 'feel-good' romantic comedy film--but to just leave it at that is to miss the exceptional depth Aloha has to offer. The mood of this film is funny, deep, warm, embracing, and ultimately uplifting--with just a dash of magic in the mix.

The story line involves Bradley Cooper playing the role of a celebrated military contractor returning to Hawaii and reconnecting with an old flame, played by Rachel McAdams, while accompanied by an Air Force officer pilot played by Emma Stone. John Krasinski (from the Office) plays Rachel McAdams' husband brilliantly as a man of few words who is eloquent with his facial expressions and body movements. Hawaiian native Dennis 'Bumpy' Kanahele plays himself in a brilliant role honoring the indigenous people of Hawaii, and providing the story line with much more connection to the Earth and nature than one typically finds in most rom-com films. I love how the mythical menehune make an appearance in this film, and adore the dance scene with Bill Murray.

Director Cameron Crowe does a spectacular job of combining a visually dazzling feast for the eyes with a deeply satisfying soundtrack. He evokes some of the most emotionally deep acting I've yet seen in movies anywhere--culminating in one of the best scenes in the movies at the end in a dance studio. The emotional depth and spiritual authenticity of Aloha are unmatched by most all other films, with the possible exception of some of Cameron Crowe's other movies.

Movie-goers fixated on fight and chase scenes will do better off with something else, despite Aloha featuring what at first glance seems to be a military-oriented story. This film is a genuine delight, and a movie I look forward to seeing again!",1468108800,,1760,4.959322033898305

It brought back many memories,military and tropical life(mostly good). Anybody that has been in the military and lived in the tropics (in my opinion) couldn't help but like this movie. The characters are all too familiar in a very general sense. I find the conversation about the blonde white girl stating she is part Hawaiian comical,since many whites(or anyone else, for that matter) claim to be part something else. Native American seems to be the most fashionable, followed by any version of any Spanish speaking culture. In any case, each time I watched it I liked it more and more. I thought the conversations between all the players were enjoyable and witty. Good chemistry throughout. But the scenery is the real star here.

Aloha seemed promising; the main actors are, to an extent, fine on their own. Well, to be fair, mostly just McAdams. I was so sad to see that the storyline was going to closely follow the unagreeable coupling of Stone and Cooper. Stone is atrocious in this film. Maybe it's the writing, maybe it's her interpretation of the character, or maybe it's her sheer obnoxious disposition in Aloha. (What happened here Stone?)

7213656,2,B00YHR5UW0,"Now that NASA is old hat the privateers have circled in to create their own space odysseys, for good or evil (old hat after having done yeomans service in giving the world over fifty years of great space adventures and increased our knowledge of the universe I don't know how many-fold). That old hat designation the result of in real life the lack of serious desire by Congress to keep funding governmental efforts. Enter the privateer off-hand billionaires looking for a hobby (billionaire plus being the necessary minimum to even get a look-see at a space project which entails expensive high-tech research and resources). That shift from governmental support to private use is what drives this film under review, Aloha.

Of course, private or public, when you talk about exploring or exploiting space you need scads of high-tech savvy guys and gals to run the operation-and smooth the rails. That is where military contractor Brian Gilcrest, played by Bradley Cooper, comes in. He is the agent for our generic billionaire, played by Bill Murray, who is looking via a private-military combine to launch a crackerjack satellite in Hawaii. Gilcrest is to smooth the rails among the various indigenous leaders on Hawaii who are looking for a pay-off for disturbing their land and their heritage. Of course with a joint enterprise the military needs to provide an escort and does so in the person of Captain Allison Ng, played by super-photogenic Emily Stone.

In the end, actually maybe the beginning as well, this is really a romantic comedy about how Gilcrest and the Captain finally get under the sheets after playing cat and mouse (meaning giving each other endless meaningful glances). There are a number of abstruse side issues like Brians relationship with an Air Force wife ex-girlfriend and with the paternity of her oldest daughter (Brians in the end), the role of nefarious governmental agents in setting up the billionaires nefarious plans and the evil designs of that standard brand billionaire who wants to rule the world via the control of space. Ho-hum. The only not ho-hum is that dance between Brian and Allison but that isn't worth the price of admission here. Thin gruel indeed with talents like Cooper, Stone and the mad monk Bill Murray.",1457827200,,2259,4.989389920424403

Clever non-verbal scenes, gorgeous photography, detailed character perspectives and both the humor and the emotional focii played subtlely... tastefully.  This film has all the elements of a mainstream drama, but avoids the usual cheesy pitfalls with obviously careful craft, especially in the case of the Cooper/Stone dynamic, which plays 'real' with hesitant undertones instead of instant-happy-ever-after.

It's not a 5-star movie.  We saw the film first, and I understand people not getting the plot.  It takes some thought; it's not spelled out for you.  But we followed it as it meandered from character to situation to location to character, and loved it.  The scenes with the President of the Republic of Hawaii (if I got that right--it's been a few weeks since viewing) are GREAT because the man plays himself, with enormous heart and dignity.  Actually, we watched a Netflix copy, and I liked it so much I bought it so I can see it again any time.  All the acting is top-drawer.

It throws off everything else -- most especially the tone, which is confused and uneven and the pace (same problems). Cameron Crowe will rise again, I have no doubt.

You know, those of us who have the patience for long book plots and following a story to its conclusion. It's not without it's flaws. First, the narration exists only briefly at the start of the film and then disappears. I can forgive that. Many films have narrators that come and go. Secondly, the dialog does seem contrived at times, but if you know military and contract employees you'd know they do rattle on like that at times. Lastly, it should have shown more of what the lead, Bryan (Cooper), went through in the Middle East. Why? Because this is the story of a man who's lost his soul, and finds it again, and understanding him more deeply would have made the conclusion clearer. For the average viewer it's too subtle. Yes, to the typical film viewer these days, accustomed to the furious in your face superhero or car chase film, this seems to meander.  But hey, newsflash, life meanders. Four stars for a satisfying ending, minus one for flaws. Not the greatest film made, but by no means deserving of the trashing it received.",1450137600,2,1183,4.580188679245283

Emma Stone was WAY over the top playing an eager military officer who's credentials didn't even make an inkling of sense! Her acting was so terrible that I don't think she's ever actually met a military member. They go on for an hour about Hawaiian rituals and worshiping the land. It was like Avatar all over again...

7213934,1,B00YHR5UW0,Total disappointment. They did not capture the beauty of Hawaii at all and the storytelling was disjointed. I'm not exactly sure what the point of this movie was or what it was supposed to be about.,1447459200,,198,4.527777777777778
7213935,4,B00YHR5UW0,"Forget the nay-sayers. This is one really enjoyable flick. I suspect that most of the poor reviews come from immature viewers. I truly feel sad for their ignorance and lack of feeling. Boy are they missing out on life! This is one of those rare stories that has a powerful and wonderful message, constantly and beautifully reinforced by great metaphors using music and two male/female subplots. The main message involves deep and beautiful cultural concepts that require one to have experienced life a little. The constant metaphors of lines, music, expressions and acting, using each actors best attributes all contribute to the terrific weave of this engulfing story.

Without giving anything away, since experiencing and discovering it for yourself is the joy of this movie, one must realize what certain body movements mean, according to important cultural understanding that underlines how ""mother earth"" speaks to us without actually talking. Again, this is possibly why some people just don't get it. They are too busy focusing on the finger to see what it is pointing to.

I saw this first with my friend, and she said that it was her kind of movie, It was mine too and I'm a red blooded guy. I liked it so much I watched it a week later with my mom, and she enjoyed not only the entire story but the assortment of characterized scenes with Murray and Baldwin among others. I loved the movie even more the second time, and I rarely watch movies twice in several years, let alone in a week.

I strongly suggest you watch this one, especially if you want a break from the typical hollywood slam bang copycat stuff and welcome a well-acted and written (with a terrific and super-apropos soundtrack) combo of heart, soul AND mind. You need all three to truly get a huge kick out of this! A gem of a movie.",1447372800,,1809,4.718354430379747

The only reason I rated this movie with one star was it was interesting watching a movie with big stars in it that was so utterly bad.  It really rates at zero stars but gets the one star for being entertaining solely based on how consistently terrible it was through the entire movie.  Having lived in Hawaii for five years as a kid (Army brat) and four years as an adult (naval officer), at least the scenes on filmed on Hickam Air Base were fun to see (the officer's club in the movie was really the officer's club on Hickam).  If you're looking for a love story (or even a decent story) with beautiful expansive cinematography of Hawaii, then this movie isn't it.

It snuck up and grabbed my heart even though I wasn't expecting it due to the lousy reviews.  The greatest attributes of the movie are the performances by Rachel McAdams and Danielle Russell, both very subtle and affecting.  Everyone else's performances were also spot on though if I had cast the movie I would have cast John Krasinksi as the male lead and given Rachel Mcadams a bit more screen time.  But Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone were also great.  The storyline with Bill Murray was the only sour note, very contrived and unbelievable which detracted from the movie a bit.

There were no characters, but rather strange and slightly irritating caricatures: the colonel who kept fidgeting with his fingers, the husband who doesn't talk, the wife whose emotions change with each scene, the female captain who in one scene is OCD, and in the next is a free spirit. The plot, such as it is, is predictable, and yet the disjointed scene changes cause one to continually ask, ""wait, what just happened?"" I have to assume that whoever wrote this script was a college sophomore whose mother or father is a famous Hollywood producer or director. Otherwise, it could never have been made.",1445990400,,738,4.728682170542636

7214055,2,B00YHR5UW0,"Aloha is a pretty slow and boring film that has put some effort into coming up with an interesting and very likable character played by Emma Stone who certainly is probably every single guys' dream fantasy, she's hot, fun, energetic, nerdy, goofy, smart, caring and for some reason is single and doesn't seem to be interested any other guys. Except for Bradley Cooper's character that is, so many guys would put themselves in his shoes in a second, but that's really the only effort they put into this. That's all Aloha has going for it, Cooper character doesn't have much substance, he's a boring guy who you only realise in the end scenes is apparently some hacker IT wiz. But he's more interested in catching up with his ex who he hasn't seen for 13 years but he was on the same plane as her weird soldier husband who doesn't speak much so his ex can't really have a satisfying conversation with the guy, perhaps giving Bradley's character an in. It's pretty obvious when straight after learning they haven't seen each other for 13 years but hey his my 12 year old daughter what's going on there, but Cooper's character is a bit slow on the uptake. The interaction between the husband and Cooper's character were ridiculously unrealistic.

There's also a no weapons in the sky space rocket sub plot also going on and a native title history lesson theme also going on but really they don't make the movie any more interesting.",1445731200,,1428,4.644268774703558

Emma has gone from the ""ugly"" ghost of Christmas past to a true American Sweetheart, and rightfully so.  Rachel always rocks her roles (no pun intended).  The guys add some depth.  I loved how John's character communicated non verbally.  Never saw it done like that and I own 2,000 movies.  Put it another way: In ""Good Will Hunting"" Robin William's character (R.I.P.) tells young Will that he didn't love his wife less because of her imperfection, he love her more.

Having now taken the plunge, I am of the opinion that most critics simply didn't get what Cameron Crowe was trying to do.  I'm not saying I get all of it, but I like it.  It is not a typical script.  It sounds and feels more like an extended poem.  The dialogue has more in common with lyrics than traditional expository prose.  He may have just invented a new genre: impressionistic rom-com.  If you go into it with the knowledge that it is not trying to be a normal, boring, Hollywood cheese-fest, you might do okay with it.",1444608000,3,614,4.380530973451328

7214170,2,B00YHR5UW0,"Aloha
 My girlfriend often drags me to see horrible chick-flicks that, I am embarrassed to admit, I usually enjoy.  This phenomenon was not the case, however, with Aloha, written and directed by Cameron Crowe.  This film is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Besides the all-star cast, this movie has nothing going for it. It lacks a solid and interesting plot. It has little conflict.  The plot is confusing and nearly impossible to follow. As a producer, Crowe has many good movies under his belt.  This film, however, was a swing and a miss.
 Metacritic, a movie review website, summarizes Aloha:  A celebrated military contractor returns to the site of his greatest career triumphs - the US Space program in Honolulu, Hawaii - and reconnects with a long-ago love while unexpectedly falling for the hard-charging Air Force watchdog assigned to him. While a story set against the backdrop of the space program has the potential to be very interesting, this film lacks a basic plot structure. The film has no scene or moment that I would classify as a climax. The movie plods along from beginning to end without any big moment.
 The storyline is equally messy. Multiple story lines meander through the movie.  Many of these sub-plots are unrelated and irrelevant to the main story. Several of the side stories seem important when they are first introduced, however, they all end up dwindling out without resolving. With all the side stories, it is hard to focus on the main story. Because no plot emerges as important, the movie is uninteresting and boring.
  During an interview conducted during the shooting of Aloha, an entertainment reporter asked Emma Stone what it was like working with Cameron Crowe. She answered by telling about Crowes past as a journalist and described how he could write and write and write. I believe this got Crowe in trouble in this film. He had so many ideas and details in his head he was unable to condense them into an hour and a half movie. I think Aloha would have made a much better TV series; that way the characters could have been developed more thoroughly and the many side stories could have been settled.
 One thing Cameron Crowe did well was casting. The film featured big name actors and actresses in this film including  Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone, Bill Murray, Alex Baldwin, and Danny McBride.  This all-star cast made the film intriguing, even if it was a letdown. Steve Parsall, a New York Times movie critic, commented that the actors and actresses were, a lineup of favored actors wasted in a screenplay unsure of what it wants to be.  This cast of excellent actors and actresses made the characters realistic, even though their story lines were unrelated to the main plot.
 The movie overlooked another story element--conflict. There were so many small, unimportant conflicts that it is nearly impossible to tell which are significant and which are not. Many of the small conflicts were never resolved and just ended. Some conflicts lasted the whole movie and ended with no satisfying resolution; others lasted a scene and were never mentioned again. The conflicts in Aloha were disorganized and uninteresting.
 Despite the abundance of well-known actors and actresses, this movie has little to offer viewers.  The plot is confusing and uninteresting with no meaningful conflict. Overall this movie is awful.  I recommend this film only as a sleep aid.",1444521600,,3412,4.902608695652174

. Also, Bradley Cooper gives a very nuanced performance at times even heartbreaking. Rachel McAdams and John Krasiniski are both excellent. In fact the whole cast is excellent. Buy it, enjoy it and think about it. Especially think about the space part.....",1444435200,,616,5.099009900990099

Nothing feels real.  We jump into things too quickly, and the director/editor assumes we're on board before we actually are.  We're not shown enough.  The kids fall in love with this guy for no reason.  The romance is forced and weird.  They guy is treated like a legend but we the audience are not privy to why (or we barely are, but only in the 2nd half, after being perplexed for the 1st half), so we aren't able to share the emotions of the characters.  And then... more bad editing, I assume... there are characters that appear with no introduction and do plot-critical things, and then they disappear again.

A complete mess. I couldn't figure out what the plot line was. The Hawaiian location seemed only secondary to the premise of the movie. The performances were awful: is Cooper sincere? is Murray sincere? What is McAdams doing in this movie? Why is Stone so hyper and shrill? Couldn't Crowe have told Stone to turn it down a few notches?

Is the movie a love story? An espionage film? A political independence story? A nature vs nuture saga? Unfortunately, it's all of these things. And yet it's none of these things.

I'd give the MVP award to the casting director since that may be the only good thing to come out of this movie... The plot is weak at best: an odd combination of Hawaiian folklore and military jargon combined with a moneybag contractor leads to complete and utter chaos. I found myself wondering, what the hell is going on? Rachel McAdams used to be the lover of Bradley Cooper but is now married and has two kids... One of which is Cooper's? Wait. What? Okay, okay that was weird but I kept watching and low and behold it got weirder- Emma Stone plays an Air Force watchdog to Cooper's character and of course they end up falling in love? No. Then the walking tribes men at night paying tribute to their fallen soldiers... Random. And Cooper's character being a sleazy contractor trying to exploit the natives... Ugh!

I got to the point that I was so bored with the plot and exasperated over the terrible character dynamics that I turned off the movie and have no inclination to finish it.

But I have not even had a slight desire to finish this show. Maybe it's just my wife and I, but this was a very poorly written script. One of the opening camera scenes was as a little kid was filming, just kept spinning around the lead actor. I get what they were trying to accomplish but it was pretty horrible. Multiple times throughout the portion of the movie we watched, we both said outloud, ""what?!"" So many things were really just lame.

7214463,3,B00YHR5UW0,"So here is a film with a terrific director and screenwriter in Cameron Crowe (""Almost Famous"" and ""Jerry Maguire"") and a cast of ""A"" list actors (Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone, Rachel McAdams and Bill Murray).  And it's shot in Hawaii.  How could this not be good or at least fun?  Shunned by audiences and critics alike, often for different reasons, the film lacks a coherent script.  And has lackadaisical direction.  So that's all on you Crowe.  The film was also controversial for its casting, specifically Ms. Stone as a fighter pilot who is one quarter native Hawaiian.  In some critic's eyes, this must be impossible.

Framed as a romantic comedy, the film isn't very funny and the dramatic elements aren't very dramatic.  Brian Gilcrest (Cooper) is a former pilot, nearly killed in our ongoing Middle East conflict.  Discharged, he now is in the employ of a multi-billion dollar company headed by Carson Welch (Murray) who is working with the Air Force to put a super spy-satellite in the sky to be launched from Hawaii.

When Brian arrives in Hawaii, he catches a glimpse of a former flame from his time there years earlier.  In the stupid scene, Tracy (McAdams), now the mother of 2, is awaiting her husband's arrival.  `Woody' (John Krasinski) is the pilot of the transport plane.  For seemingly no reason, she turns around, as if on cue, to meet the eyes of Brian.  Really?  Brian's job is to guide the launch technically and work with the native Hawaiians to gain access to some of their land.  Capt. Allison Ng (Stone) is assigned to Brian as a liaison between the military and Brian acting for Welch's company.  In essence, she is the ""watchdog.""

Eventually, they get friendly - after the compulsory ""falling in love scenes"" -  but then there is that whole Tracy/Brian breakup 13 years earlier that ended with mixed feelings.  Oh, and did I mention that Tracy has a 12-year old daughter named Grace (a very good Danielle Rose Russell, ""A Walk Among The Tombstones"").  Is she or isn't she?  Complications ensue further when it becomes evident that the wily and contemptuous Carson Welch may be launching a weaponized satellite into space.  Certainly against the wishes of the lovely Hawaiian natives who cautioned against that in a significant scene earlier in the film.

So yeah, this film isn't very good.  How many times do you watch a film where none of the characters are likeable?  Well here, all of the characters are likeable, even the villain.  Some thought the final scene between Grace and Brian nearly saves the movie.  I thought it bordered on creepy given the uncertainty of their relationship.  In any case, what nearly saves the film for me is the terrific soundtrack which I just ordered from Amazon.  Cameron Crowe does know a thing or two about music.",1442880000,,2782,4.793684210526316

7214501,4,B00YHR5UW0,"A lot of people panned this movie. If you need everything spelled out for you and nonstop over production it isn't for you. If you like lazy, crass humor, this also isn't for you. This is a Cameron Crow movie. It has subtly and nuance and makes the assumption that viewers can keep up and think beyond the obvious. I, for one, like an intelligent movie. The ""action"" in the subplot is a plot tool. This isn't an action movie. It is a reflective, romantic comedy about facing your past in order to embrace your future. I liked the characters, I liked the dimension and interplay and complexity of his past relationship and his need to reach into the future. Could they have explored that more?

Alec Baldwin was going for an Oscar on this and maybe should have brought it back down about 100%. (Spoiler alert!) Father-daughter story book-end was sweet and a redemptive catalyst to Bradley's character. Wished more focus could have been developed here. Bradley at night, standing on a quiet street watching his new-found daughter rehearsing her native dance lessons through the plate-glass window, is worth the whole movie.

For some reason it never seems to come together. There is an odd feeling of dramatic distance. Granted, one of the themes of the picture is the power of things that go unsaid. Could he have been trying to echo that theme in the odd pacing of the movie? Perhaps.

It is a romantic comedy type of movie but tries too hard to be funny and ends up feeling flat and the romantic chemistry just is lacking.  The story almost seems it went into too many re-writes and no one really decided to do a final read to see if it made any sense at all.

In fact I wouldn't be surprised if the same guy didn't write MANY reviews )). And remember there are a lot of unhappy, unromantics out there, so I have to consider that. )). Many movies get ""low star"" reviews on cable tv and many of these movies are wonderful. It depends who is reviewing them!? It seems some critics only like action, sex  and killing. That's when they rate it high. Some give silly, nonsense flicks high ratings. ?Personally, I like intelligent films; emotional films; comedies--something you can learn from and maybe take away something wonderful to think about/dream about. Maybe they have something that makes you want to improve a facet of yourself--makes you see beauty  Even the hilarious Something About Mary, teaches you things and makes you feel warm when you come away from it.

Hawaii is one of the most socialistic states in the union.  They sure don't mind the handouts from the federal government.  I hate these poorly written political stories from Hollywood.

It's about people involved in the newly emerging private business side of the space program. That being said, Bradley Cooper, as always, gives a great performance. Emma Stone, as a young Air Force lieutenant assigned as liaison to Cooper, is perfect for the part and gives a credible performance. Rachel McAdams does a good job as Cooper's ex-girlfriend, now married with children to an Air Force pilot played by John Krasinski. Bill Murray makes for a convincing entrepreneur, and Alec Baldwin's take on an imperious Air Force General is spot-on. A fun movie.",1441584000,2,728,4.926829268292683

7214794,4,B00YHR5UW0,"Cameron Crowe is obsessed with coming of age stories, though I say that in the broad sense of self-discovery throughout life. Whether it's the realization of what matters in career and relationships in Jerry Maguire, or finding perspective in tough times in Elizabethtown, or accepting your soul mate in Singles, his movies are all about some maturing point in your life.

Aloha is about the need to set things in your life right. Bradley Cooper plays a bit of a screw up, professionally and personally, and he aims to fix them both. To help him out, he hangs out with his ex and her family (Rachel McAdams), and is assigned a military liaison (Emma Stone) while doing some contract work for a former boss on Oahu. Stone plays her role hilariously, while McAdams plays a far more mature character than we're used to seeing. Hawaii itself is a character in the movie, but small roles by Bill Murray and Alec Baldwin almost distract you from the redemption story taking place.

That redemption story, setting things right, is not as focused as it could be. Part of the problem is that Cooper's character doesn't strike you as a much of a screw up, so you have to rely on the stories and flashbacks to understand that. They come too slow and spread out. Fortunately, there are enough laughs and sweet points to carry the movie forward anyway, and it was never obvious to me which of the women would lead Cooper's character to the other. The ending has a nice payoff.",1441584000,4,1463,4.623076923076923

7214890,4,B00YHR5UW0,"Cameron Crowe (Jerry Maguire, Vanilla Sky, Almost Famous, We Bought a Zoo) has been called an idiosyncratic writer and here he not only writes this at times bizarre script but also directs it.  Parts of it work well, other parts bet lost in the transition form the words in a script to the action in the film. And that is most assuredly not because of inadequate actors: the cast is filled with some of the finest actors of the day. But in the end the ideas he places before us - military duty before personal life, greed and corruption in the purchase  of the skies, old flames and new attractions/counter-attractions, environment protection versus technology  are worth of our attention and by films end it all works out just fine. It is the getting there that is a bumpy road.

The story is so complex with sidebars and secondary themes that keeping a synopsis to a minimum works best: A celebrated military contractor Brian Gilchrist (Bradley Cooper) returns to the site of his greatest career triumphs  Honolulu, Hawaii  and reconnects with a long-ago love Tracy Woodside (Rachel McAdams) while unexpectedly falling for the hard-charging Air Force watchdog Allison Ng (Emma Stone) assigned to him. Toss in Tracys current secretive and quiet military husband Wood (John Krasnski), Brians new contractor boss Carson Welch (Bill Murray), the past military buddies of Brian (Danny McBride, and Alec Baldwin) and some complicated Hawaiian figures and the pie is baked.

Bradley Cooper, Rachel McAdams, Emma Stone and John Krasinski are excellent and make the film glow whenever they are on screen. Cameron Crowe deals with a lot of psychological overlay here and while at times it is confusing, it is in retrospect very erudite.

Cooper is cutting up and joking right up until the bugle sounds, he comes to attention, and returns McAdams' ogles.

After living on Oahu and Maui for some time, it mostly seemed incredibly fake. I really couldn't stand Emma Stone's role.

Crowe never disappoints with his choice of actors and all the little subtle intricacies in his movies, this is one of his best I think.  There are so many little nuances that only those who truly enjoy great films will get, it's film making at its best with Crowe and certainly with this film.  There are few films that I can watch over and over and never tire of, and this is one I cannot stop watching, it is that great!  Well done!!

It was painful at times to watch, especially scenes between Bradley and well...just every one.  Even Emma Stone couldn't save it(and I love her work)...matter of fact she was the worst.

7215190,2,B00YHR5UW0,"The trailer is misleading. It promises a traditional/simple romantic comedy. Instead this film tries to fit several genres and doesn't succeed in any of them due to the lack of character development and storyline.

There were 4 different stories going on in the movie and none of them seemed plausible or interesting.

1. Bradley Cooper returns to Hawiia to prove himself/succeed in business. (His reputation is good enough that he is on this job, and everyone trusts him to handle tricky issues at hand. But all the characters in the movie feel entitled to say what a jerk he is...Huh?)

2. Hawiian people are mistreated by the government and conned by Cooper/Murray. (Yeah this storyline really never goes anywhere and seems more a political statement by the writer.)

3. The romantic storyline between Stone and Cooper. She is obnoxious and Uncharming. (She is a female Sheldon Cooper.) He seems more interested in his Ex.

4. McAdams and Cooper resolving the past and accepting the present. Both seem very happy in their present circumstances, so it made no sense why after 13 years they would meet up. (What drove these 2 characters to come together at that moment versus 13 years ago or 20 years from the present?)

And after all the revelations to tie up all 4 plots, everyone is EXTREMELY RELAXED. I would have thought more yard decorations would be decapitated.",1440892800,,1370,4.883620689655173
7215191,5,B00YHR5UW0,"This movie is all about what makes life flat, drab, and one-dimensional and, by contrast, what makes life purpose-filled with complex layers of richness and meaning and beauty. If you're looking for lots of explosions and action scenes, by all means skip this movie - there are countless movies out there you'll like better than this one. If you want predictable romantic comedy formulas, you'll probably be happier with something else. If slapstick comedy and crude jokes are what make you laugh, then pass this one by.

But if you like some genuine surprises sometimes and a little more depth and complexity, then watch this movie and pay attention to how much is said purely through facial expressions. Especially when faces change slowly and show deeper dawning realization as opposed to instantaneous expressions on autopilot. And how different is it when he keeps on delivering a speech when he can't see to notice the reactions on her face? (the episode with the silly hat/sunglasses)

Pay attention to the timing and tone of voice people use when they say things. ""I'm a fighter pilot."" ""A little deeper."" ""I'm ... a fighter ... pilot.""

Keep an eye out for what people's body language tells you. What do people say by the way they position their bodies, what they do with their shoulders? How much do you anticipate just from body language when people walk up to each other and they don't say a word? Notice how different the dances are in the movie. Brian is in a shell and it's hard to break through that shell. The wordless shrugs of his shoulders watching Allison ""dance with the devil"" ARE the dialogue in this movie.

Pay attention to the stories about what ultimately changed people's hearts and minds, when the crux of the moment had nothing to do with the precise words that were said and everything to do with how and when people said them. ""I used to be anti-military until...""

Pay attention to the deeper meanings and rich power of symbolism, traditional stories, and loyalty to people, as opposed to love of power and loyalty to riches. Which people are made to look silly and easier to ridicule in the beginning? Which people are most silly and easy to ridicule in the end?

Pay attention to when people give a pat, automatic answer, and then someone calls them on it. Someone forces them to stop. Think. Feel. And not just go on autopilot. (the ride back from visiting the king) Others always are and always will be on autopilot (fingers). The fingers say something about what's going on between his ears.

I thought it was an interesting story, however if all you pay attention to is the plot then you're missing so many other layers. A lot of confused reviewers probably don't realize how much of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan was fought with highly-paid private sector contractors paid many times what American men and women serving in the military were paid for facing similar risks. I actually had a pretty good idea where the ""conspiracy"" storyline was headed as soon as Captain Ng talked with the king and made him promises that weren't in her power to keep in the first 20-25 minutes of the film. I guess a lot of reviewers who said the plot was confusing didn't pick up on that. That's OK. The same confused ones probably also totally missed the tone of voice and the very direct meaningingful look Tracy gave Brian on the tarmac when his ex-girlfriend mentions the age of her oldest daughter within a few sentences of mentioning how many years since Brian left, watching his face closely for any (nonverbal) reaction or recognition or response from him. Oh yeah, that was in the opening 5-10min of the film. That's OK too. Even if the confused ones missed all these earliest of many big hints and many more to follow, does everything in a movie have to be laid out and totally predictable within the first 20min anyway?

Real life is complex. That's part of why I enjoyed ""Definitely, Maybe"" so much more than so many more predictable and less original romantic comedies out there. Who is he or she going to end up with in the end? It's not always obvious even to the people who are living it, so why should it be totally obvious to all the viewers and onlookers?

I guess some people don't smile or laugh to themselves when Tracy says with her words she doesn't want to see him while her body language and smile says the exact opposite (she immediately approached him on the tarmac). If that's ambiguous, how much is the reviewer missing in real life when people's words say one thing and all their facial expressions and tone of voice and body language all say the exact opposite? Do these people miss a lot of real-life sarcasm? How about the ""silent husband"" who is saying something through body language. I thought the subtitles under his shrugs and looks pretty much hit you over the head with the message this whole movie is about people ""speaking another language."" I thought that was clever and original. Or when always-military, always uniform-wearing Allison (who just told us when asked about her personal status how ""she doesn't get hooked up, she gets redeployed"") after having a few shots still lapses into militaryspeak referring to him as ""sir"" in a moment full of passion and suspense and makes deadpan comments like ""what are all the stickers on your ... unit."" (laptop) ""How many of those stickers wore a dress?"" ""I'm at a crossroads sir.""  ""I could never stand to just be another sticker on there, all flattened out like that ...""  That's OK. To some people that's boring and not everyone has the same sense of humor.

I'd hate to imagine what a lot of negative reviewers would say about the humor watching M*A*S*H reruns. M*A*S*H was controversial and original, among other reasons, because they absolutely refused to layer in a laugh track to tell people when they were supposed to laugh. Not enough obvious slapstick humor. Sometimes the humorous situations could be both sad and funny at the same instant - real life isn't always distilled into just a single emotion at any one time to make it less confusing. Didn't fit neatly in the comedy category making jokes over a surgery table. Ultimately many people enjoyed it far more than all the stock TV comedies out there, but it was genre-bending, it was unfamiliar at first, and it certainly wasn't as predictable. When you get to the bottom of it this movie is about everything that gets lost in a flurry of brief text messages. If you watch people's faces and body language, does the movie still really have to, in effect, say LOL at all the appropriate moments? If so, that's a sad statement all in itself.

Like ""Definitely, Maybe"" I'll definitely buy this movie even though the ending won't be a surprise next time, because I know this is one I'll watch again just to enjoy it unfold. And one of those times, just as an experiment, I may try watching it with the sound off to see how much I can follow even without hearing any of the words.",1440892800,,6957,4.664763458401305

7215193,3,B00YHR5UW0,"While  in agreement  this is not one of Cameron Crowe's strongest efforts, it is far from being a bad film.  I personally believe sometimes when an A-list talent like Mr. Crowe  comes out with a highly anticipated movie, that the bar  for the critics and the audience is already somewhat higher from the outset.  So, I believe the playing field is not quite level from the outset when reviewing the film compared with other films of the same ilk.
 So, what I believe is a film that is worthwhile and enjoyable has been simply knit picked to death, from what was considered questionable casting of the Emma stone character to the pace of the movie etc.  The bottom line is, this film was enjoyable, well acted and worthy of an audience.
 It is simply a fun, lighthearted  well directed romance film that will likely not disappoint 80% of the people that give it a shot. Aloha!",1440892800,2,875,4.551282051282051

By viewing the trailers for this, you would have thought that it was a fairly light, romantic comedy with some drama mixed in, but it turns out that this movie was trying to be too many things at once. Part comedy, part romance, part thriller, part conspiracy, and a bunch of other stuff mixed in, it just doesn't work. I found it hard to follow, and when I did figure out where it was going, it didn't really make sense. Lots of gaps too where you had to jump to conclusions from Point A to Point G.

7215295,1,B00YHR5UW0,"This movie is simply not good. I suppose at some point it may have been more coherent than it is, but Crowe had FOUR YEARS to tweak it and when you have that much time you second guess yourself repeatedly and what you end up with is a disjointed, jumbled mess.
If you still want to see this movie, be forewarned - numerous SPOILERS follow:
The dialog is interesting at times, unfortunately it seems like it's from a half dozen different movies. Some characters hardly use any dialog at all, like John Krasinski in a totally unfunny running bit throughout the movie. I take that back, if the Krasinski silent bit would've been used exclusively throughout the whole movie it probably would've been funnier, but it wasn't. Bill Murray plays a James Bond-ish super villain which sounds hilarious, but he plays it straight! Cooper and Stone are driving a Jeep to a remote area. The road they're on is gated and locked. They could easily drive around the gate with their 4 wheel drive vehicle, but they decide to walk, uphill, what seems to be a few miles, simply because the plot calls for it. This movie also has one of my favorite complaints - the older guy with the younger girl. In this case, the 40 year old Cooper with the 26 year old Stone. Plus, Emma Stone is a 'young' 26, someone who looks like she could still play a high school senior or a college girl where as Cooper is looking all of his 40 years in this movie. Plus, he has zero chemistry with Emma Stone. I was never in the military but it just seems like none of the military personnel in this movie seemed to be acting or behaving the way they should, seeing that they were all high ranking professionals:
 'Colonel' Danny McBride and 'General' Alec Baldwin. Plus, the military is, of course, portrayed as a group of out-of-the-loop idiots. I won't even get into the fact that lily-white, 'I couldn't look any more Caucasian if I tried' Emma Stone is playing a part Chinese, part native Hawaiian.  There are a few tiny good parts to this flick: Rachel McAdams 12 year old daughter Danielle Rose Russell does a lot with very little and makes all of her screen time count and the islands themselves, of course, look great. Aside from that, there's no real reason for you to spend 105 minutes of your life watching this movie.",1440720000,,2287,4.508433734939759

The movie gives clues that things are about to get complicated when Tracy Woodside invites Brian Gilcrest for dinner with her husband John Woody Woodside (John Krasinski) and both of their children present (a big deal because this was shortly after her husband made it safe back from one of his missions).

With the help of his liaison Allison Ng he does his best to try and straighten his life out. Most of the time when I read reviews for movies and its gets blasted by everyone I end up thinking it wasn't as bad as everyone said. This is an exception. I think the reason for the excitement behind this one is due to the cast, which is amazing. I love Cameron Crowe and that was the reason I was looking forward to this. The problem lies in the fact that the movie tried to do way too much and every storyline seemed to not mix with the others. A soldier injured in a war comes back to find his ex girlfriend married to a man who becomes instantly jealous while at the same time starting to fall for the woman who is trying to help him while trying to help a rich guy send up a satellite into space which may contain a nuclear weapon while at the same time wondering if his ex's daughter is his.

7215403,5,B00YHR5UW0,"This movie seems polarizing for people so I'll point out the problems without belaboring the point.

Gilchrist is the main protagonist, played by B. Cooper. He dreams to be an astronaut, his dreams are dashed by economic realities and he becomes a military contractor, he falls into ethical dilemmas as a military contractor, he ruins his relationship with his girlfriend, he loses his sense of self preservation and gets blown up by a missle that he knew was heading for him--he just didn't care. After rehab (including dealing with someone else's toe being sewn onto him) he is brought back, a full year later, to work for the same military contractor on a small gig to negotiate getting land from Hawaiians so the contractor (Carson, played by Bill Murray) can establish a production center for rocket launching, satellites, etc. Upon landing in Hawaii, we realize he knows his ex's husband, his ex has A LOT of unresolved issues that persist since the relationship was cut short prematurely by Gilchrist. He does his best to deal with the emotional turmoil all while trying to complete his work, which is also complicated by a budding relationship with his part-Hawaiian partner and military liason, Ng (played by a stunning Emma Stone). Like so many relationships, Ng has identified Gilchrist as someone who is special and needs to be fixed. He resists Ng's intrusion and over-the-top military professionalism, she's persistent. Ultimately everything comes to a head with Carson, the contractor, whilst Gilchrist fixes things with his ex in easy but emotionally painful yet hopeful fashion, and he simultaneously falls in love with Ng who at the same time has questioned her own interest in Gilchrist. However, this being a love story, the day is saved in the end, the military is ultimately okay with Gilchrist and he must bring Ng around...which is at least a little left up in the air at the end.

Aloha is a love story with a big underlying theme about ownership of the sky and space, and government contractors. It seems like a lot of people have difficulty understanding the underlying theme, or they don't like it for some reason. Ownership of the sky is discussed in view of Hawaiian gods and common ethics of right and wrong. Essentially, the themes can be summed up as, ""Nobody should own the sky"" and ""Contractors are irresponsible and Greedy."" There is no doubt that these are true statements.

The main problem with this movie, for me, is a lack of character development. In particular, there is something strange about the way Gilchrist and Ng get together. It feels like there is a scene missing, maybe two, where they at least get to know each other. It is not a big deal to me because the lives of military and military contractors and contractor consultants includes quick meetings, fast projects that last days or weeks. These project bud relationships, they build lifelong friendships, and it happens in hours. You just feel it.

However, it seems that a lot of people can't get their heads around any of it. They don't understand the clear problems and social commentary in the movie. And they can't get over the speed at which a consulting project like the one depicted can develop. And they can't realize the emotions that are involved amongst the characters.

I feel like this movie tells enough of my own story so that I can identify with it. It's weird and quirky, the dialog is over the top, the acting is over the top sometimes, and it can be awkward. But it hits on the raw emotion of things left unsaid between an ex that you love but can't be with, but can be happy for. It tells the real story of what contracting and military is like, today, which people just seem to not understand. And it tells the story of allowing moral shortcuts to degrade your self-worth as a person--something that people who do contracting must be vigilant of because many are not. I suppose that can apply to any job, not just contracting, so I'm just astonished at the complaints about the movie.

There are some factual issues with the movie, in particular some of Brian Gilchrist's timeline with respect to space exploration was wrong. It doesn't really impact the movie.

For me, there are so many layers to Aloha that are woven together. I'm leaving out the plight of Hawaiians, environmentalism, the annoyance of cell phone service, children of single parents, the colonialism of the United States, and many other issues that are brought up. Sounds ridiculous that there is all this in the movie? I don't know about you, but I want a complex story and frankly Bug's Bunny cartoons also tackle the same issues.

I can tell you that I'm watching the movie for the third time and it gets better each time. That's rare for a movie, for me; and it's not because I didn't get it, but because it just keeps giving me something more.  5-stars.",1439337600,11,4856,4.75771971496437
7215404,5,B00YHR5UW0,"I loved this movie. It's not a romantic comedy. It doesn't really fit into any neat and tidy category (much like life, itself). It's probably not everyone's cup of tea. You need to have an open mind and heart to get it (which are somewhat rare things at the moment), and you probably need to have a particular way of thinking and sense of humor. But I have rarely seen a movie that felt more nourishing and fulfilling to me. I feel sad that so many people are unable to see the beauty, magic and soul in this film, but I know that some will get it and for those people it will be a real gift.

Stone was her typical quirky, likable self, while Cooper did a good job playing a serious, somewhat uncaring character. The Hawaiian setting and soundtrack was hauntingly beautiful.

I find today's standards for critical acclaim, fail to recognize the romantic comedy as a viable genre; and too often the cinemactic community faults a movie for lack of depth.  If you want to see a lovely romantic comedy, with beautiful stars, and an always entertaining Bill Murray this movie is not to be missed (especially his dance scene with Emma Stone).

The parts I did see (maybe twenty-five minutes, total) were disconnected and often extraneous, adding nothing to the next-to-nothing plot. Watch the action that takes place in the space center; it will provide you with all you need to know to understand the plot (what little there is). This film can't decide whether it wants to be a romance or an action thriller. It fails at both. Something akin to telepathy between the protagonist and an airman occurs toward the end of the movie to provide an explanation of the nature of the relationship between the protagonist and the airman's wife, but the explanation, like the relationship, is unnecessary, as is the reference to the volcano god. The protagonist's motive for thwarting the project is as puerile as the protagonist himself and as unbelievable. A lack of believability, of motive, of romantic chemistry, of focus, and of continuity makes this movie an excellent prescription for insomnia.

Rachel McAdam's and Jim K.. Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone were amazing characters, to me. This movie, to me, solidifies the truth that life is messy, people make mistakes. People with far too much money, with no sense to how to use it, make huge and colossal self-centered choices and think they can buy people. Circumstances are not always what they seem. And, oh yeah...trust your eyes and gut and do the right thing. Even if the immediate result is not pleasant, the truth will win out. I loved the body and facial expression communication thing in this movie. Not been done too many times before. The Hawaiian people are represented well here. The fact that the female pilot was a fourth Hawaiian, in my opinion, should not have been an issue. In life there will always be trolls trying to ruin a good thing. Usually patience and an open mind and heart take care of their negative efforts. Loved Alec Baldwins character and Bill Murray. The dancing and music in this movie are great too.

8718294,1,B00YHR5UW0,"well this movie took time out of my life that i can never get back so i need some revenge. The story line was jumped all over the place, seriously more confusing than my bipolar ex gf. The cast of A list actors lures you in and then dashes your dreams and hurts worse than when your parents say ""I'm not mad I'm disappointed"". i would pay another $3.99 to unwatch this and erase it from my memory. if you are one of those adventurous souls that reads reviews and says ""oh, it cant be that bad"" let me save you the time. Punch yourself in the tits and/or balls and keep your $3.99.",1527984000,,580,4.0964912280701755
