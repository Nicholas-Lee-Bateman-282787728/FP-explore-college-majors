2098425,5,B0002H4GUG,The beauty of this movie is beyond belief. Every scene is like a painting.  The loves stories take you deep into the dark heart of love.  The movie follows three love stories that go through the seasons. The stories end-up intertwined.  Just brilliant and beautiful.,1110412800,3,266,4.866666666666666
2098426,5,B0002H4GUG,"A truly great film. Kitano has always been one of the most remarkable of film artists: a moving combination of extreme violence and extreme tenderness -- sort of a Japanese mixture of Peckinpah & Max Ophuls. Who else, other than Nicholas Ray, can claim such a range? ""Dolls"" -- released to empty houses back in 2002, and finally making it to the cinematically barren shores of the USA in '05 -- is Kitano at his most tender. Three stories are interwoven, and the dolls of the title refer, of course, to those among us -- a vanishing breed -- whose depth of love is just too strong for the world. They live in a world beyond ours. Characters such as this once held a prime place in the focus of world art. (Balzac made a career of them.) No more, outside of hearts such as Kitano's. Much, I imagine, in this movie comes from his life. The aging Yakuza(wonderfully played by Tatsuya Mihasi)is Kitano the guilty husband. The lonely celebrity disfigured by car accident leads back to Kitano's near-death in a motorcycle crack-up. Perhaps the lonely woman embodied by Chieko Matsubara and the main character Sawako is the director's dual valentine of apology to his loyal wife. Where it all comes from doesn't really matter. What does matter are some of the most moving moments in modern cinema: the fade out on the groupie madly in love with the pretty pop star, as he rocks out, headphones on, alone in his bedroom; the moment of recognition by Mihasi as he sees Chieko Matsubara still waiting, years later, at their chosen bench; Sawako holding up her angel necklace, as she and her lover gaze back into time, seeing the moment when the necklace was first given to her; the groupie and the pop star ""smelling the roses""; the incomparable moment when Matsumoto, Miho Kanno's betrayer, realizes his fate is forever linked with hers, and he leads her toward the road they must take together. Kitano's films have always been about the struggle to protect love(romantic and fraternal) through violence. ""Hana-bi""(literal translation: ""Fire Flower"") is the greatest of these works. Here, there is no violence. Only the sadness at the end of all roads taken to embody love, at the cost of everything else. The music by Joe Hisaishi and the photography by Katsumi Yanagishima are beyond compare. An absolutely must see film.",1109980800,7,2314,4.7730673316708225
2098427,5,B0002H4GUG,"""Dolls"" is such a tragically beautiful and beautifully tragic movie.  It's just so visually breathtaking...the backgrounds are absolutely amazing.  And the stories are so absorbing and heartbreaking about such incredible, fierce, epic, hopeless loves...I especially liked the one about the yakuza.

2098428,5,B0002H4GUG,"Based on the themes and aesthetics of Bunraku, traditional Japanese puppet theater, ""Dolls"" is a deliberate attempt to blend an ancient Japanese art form with modern technology and sensibilities.

Like ""Double Suicide,"" another Japanese film based on Bunraku, the film begins with the puppets on stage being manipulated by their handlers, then transitions intolive actors. Also in common with ""Double Suicide,"" the film is highly stylistic and modern while retaining the pace and tone of the old-fashioned story telling.

""Dolls"" in all covers three stories: Matsumoto and Sawako, the happy couple who's meddling parents as well as their own poor choices leads to tragedy. Hiro, the stereotypical aging Yakuza gangster, kind to children yet ruthless to his enemies, seeking to find a love that was lost to him long ago. Haruna, the once popular singing idol, who's features were marred in an accident and is now lonely and alone, allowing no one to see her face.

As with most Bunraku stories, each is a tale of the tragedy of love, and how exquisite love is often accompanied by exquisite pain. The agony and the ecstasy. But because this is Japan, these fierce emotions are bottled up inside the characters, who show their outward masks attempting to betray nothing of their true feelings. The true story is only available to those who can read between the lines.

In the end, however, what drives ""Dolls"" is not the story, but the artistry of Kitano's camera. Some of the splendid scenes and colors in ""Fireworks"" find fruition in ""Dolls."" He claims that each shot can be framed as a piece of art. The changing colors reflects the traditional Japanese aesthetic of the four seasons, and of the changeability of nature and life. It is a beautiful film.

Some have difficulty accepting Kitano Takeshi as anything other than a violent action director, and those people might have a hard time with the slow pace and brilliant images of ""Dolls."" It is definitely not going to be everyone's favorite, but it is one of mine.",1109721600,27,2020,4.929411764705883
2098429,1,B0002H4GUG,"I love world cinema, but this must rank as one of the worst films I've ever seen. Beggars in designer clothes? They do indeed totter around the landscape like dolls - endlessly. The film is a tragedy which some have described as a poetic examination of true love - I couldn't agree less, the characters lack insight, simply playing out the roles chosen by themselves and society to the bitter end, leaving this reviewer completely unmoved.

Takeshi Kitano has made a super-aesthetic film, but there is no real content here - just a series of meaningless scenes. This film was panned when it was presented at the Venice Festival - the only reason to watch it is to find out why.",1109030400,18,677,4.595041322314049
2098430,5,B0002H4GUG,"This Japanese film is probably the most disturbing and disquieting film I have seen in many months or even years, and yet also one of the most Japanese films I have ever admired and enjoyed, that naturally came from Japan. The rhythm say some is slow. In fact it is real. Long shots, long sequences of people in real time, in the time of real reality. Nothing virtual about it. Then pictures, landscapes, urbanscapes, moutainscapes that are breathtaking by their beauty, for sure, but also their density and symbolic value. From one sequence to the next, from one scene to the next, symbolical elements are entertwined with the utmost art and delicacy, fineness and minuteness. These symbolical elements that run through the film are extremely difficult to capture, and yet the eye picks them, recognizes them and it is quite a pleasure to shift from one situation to the next without a complete break, with a constant reference from one to the others. The integration of Bunraku  puppets  is a marvellous idea and effect. The puppets become alive into the characters and the characters become dead into the puppets that are alive in spite of the inertia that is theirs, an inertia that can only be moved by three manipulators per puppet, one actor and one musician. That is a lot of people behind the china and cloth actors. And that is not all. The film reveals the deep layers of universal consciousness in front of love, death and life. Love cannot be escaped and if you try to do so, you will have to pay. Death cannot be imposed onto any one, and if one tries to do so on his neighbour, sooner or later, he will meet with this death in his own life. Life cannot be transformed into a game, because it is not a game. If you try to become the slave of such a game, of such a fancy, of such a mania, you will have to face life in the eyes and death will ensue. And the film closes, or nearly on the final image of the main metaphor : love, when betrayed, becomes an enslavement, a mendicant's fate, a couple of lost souls forever tied up and led on the road to the past to their truth, to falling into some an abyss, and dying not in one another's arms but dangling like two mangled pieces of game side to side in midair. And the hunter is that great leveller of our world, that great justice-maker of our world, that life-love-death, the triple goddess of so many mythologies, the trinity of so many religions, the triad of so many imaginations, that looms in the sky of our vanity immense, eternal and unfathomable.

2098431,5,B0002H4GUG,"I've recently been trying out Kitano movies after seeing the excellent Zatoichi. Dolls was thus hired from the local Vid shop. The film began achingly slowly and I had ill feelings-where was the action, the gangsters, the droll and quirky characters? After 20 minutes or so I was absorbed. Then it got better. It doesn't just manage to touch your emotions, it seems to stab them one by one: grief, love, compassion, sympathy. The empathy that is created for the characters is impressive, especially as much of it is attained not by dialogue. expressions seem to convey their thoughts much more powerfully. in the final scenes i had a lump in my throat. Me:  a 6' 2'' bloke who likes beer and footy!  Only watched it yesterday, and typing this crude review (1st attempt-sorry)stirs ups some of the appreciation for the film again. nice one Kitano",1095638400,,845,4.780821917808219

2098433,5,B0002H4GUG,"Throughout Dolls you feel as if you are observing the life of two Banraku dolls on an inner journey to escape the prison of their reality as they tell their story through three couples who seem to be struggling with similar themes and emotional issues.

This almost silent contemplative art is much more poetic than dramatically complex and yet intricately woven so as to mingle the dreams and imaginings of six souls longing for completion.

There is a contrast of serenity with conflict and it feels like the couples in the story are playing out the stories told by the Dolls. In one gorgeous scene the couple bound by a red cord dress like the dolls and that makes the ending highly evocative and memorably poetic in the most intriguing of ways.

While viewing this movie you may feel more inclined to write poetry or phrases and have strange thoughts like: ""I am tied to your heart with a crimson rope. When you fall, I trip so easily over myself."" In a way, you write many of the words of the script in your own mind and in that way make the movie your own. At the moment where they fall down a hill, you also see the puppets and it feels like the puppeteers are controlling the couple's life in reality.

Dolls is an especially serene and visually stunning contemplative moment of art. The trees bursting with autumn grandeur are beautifully filmed and the red rope is strangely interesting as it trails along the ground, picking up leaves or pulling across snow or keeping the couple together even in chaotic dreams. The pacing is especially relaxing and you are left in an almost mysteriously silent mood.

2098434,5,B0002H4GUG,"Wonderful movie! Very emotionally touching and you can really feel for the characters. And yes, at some points, it's quite a tear-jerker.",1142899200,6,137,5.2727272727272725
2098435,5,B0002H4GUG,"With the influx of MTV-style editing and pacing into practically all of today's storytelling mediums, Takeshi Kitano's DOLLS is a remarkably quiet film. It harkens back to a more patient time, and challenges its audience with non-linear storytelling and vague visual metaphor. Equal parts Yasujiro Ozu and Seijun Suzuki, DOLLS is aimed at the patient intelligent filmgoer. The explosive violence of Brother or Zatoichi is no where to be found; comedic moments are few and far between. Kitano chooses to focus on the tragedy of life and love instead of death or revenge, and his deliberate style paints a picture worthy of hanging next to any classic Japanese fable. Fitting, since one such fable sets the film into motion. Meido no Hikyaku (The Courier from Hell), a landmark bunraku-japanese puppet theater-play by Japanese dramatist Monzaemon Chikamatsu, tells the story of a lowly courier who steals public funds to free his lover from her life of prostitution. Betrayed by a friend, Monzaemon and his lover flee to his hometown, hoping to die there together. This tragic pair inspires three interwoven, non-linear modern stories that echo the emotion and tragedy of Chikamatsu's tale; at times, like gods, the puppets watch over or directly influence the `real world' events.

The three stories themselves are, at best, standard. The characters are pulled directly from the shelf. Their relationships are predictable: a woman destroyed by her lover's parents' lust for their son to marry up the social ladder; a yakuza boss and the brief love of his youth, meeting after decades of separation; a pop idol and her most obsessive fan. As the stories progress, paralleling each other in various, sometimes symbolic, manners, we are never intellectually surprised by the proceedings. Yet, through manipulation of this predictability, DOLLS devastates emotionally. Like the best fables, the surroundings are familiar, but the path is jarring. Technically, Kitano effectively experiments with Eisenstein's Soviet Montage Theory. Juxtaposition of images, both for symbolic and practical storytelling purposes, is in large part what makes the film so poetic, haunting, and effective. The seasons, whose colors are captured with staggering beauty by Katsumi Yanagishima (Battle Royale, Go, all of Kitano's films except Violent Cop and Hanabi), are as crucial and focused upon as any of the characters.

Perhaps the film to most appropriately compare with DOLLS is Akira Kurosawa's Dreams. Both films are giant leaps into artistic experimentation by directors most well known for striking realism. Both move slowly, conjoin multiple stories and focus as strongly on symbolism and nature as on any storyline. Dreams is an undisputed masterwork, but Kitano's film takes more risks-almost all of which enhance the film-and achieves a greater sense of whole than Kurosawa's. It is interesting that Kitano followed up his biggest cinematic gamble with his most commercial and, arguably, most entertaining film to date (Zatoichi). This should not be surprising, however, coming from Japan's most consistently unpredictable auteur. DOLLS requires intense viewer patience, but for an audience open to the film's challenges, Kitano's film proves immensely rewarding.",1124409600,5,3251,5.47410358565737

2098437,5,B0002H4GUG,"Master filmmaker Takeshi Kitano returns behind the camera for the first time since his indifferently received English-language effort Brother (2000) with this operatic tale of lost love. Dolls takes puppeteering as its overriding motif - specifically, the kind practiced in Bunraku doll theater performances - opening each section of his film with a story provided by the puppets and their masters, which relates thematically to the action provided by the live characters. Chief among those tales is the story of Matsumoto (Hidetoshi Nishijima) and Sawako (Miho Kanno), a young couple whose relationship is about to be broken apart by the former's parents, who have insisted their son take part in an arranged marriage to his boss' daughter. He initially agrees, causing the unstable Sawako to be committed to a psychiatric hospital. When he leaves his new bride at the altar to save Sawako, however, he realizes that she's so incapable of caring for herself that she needs to be tied to him with a red rope.

2098438,4,B0002H4GUG,"The international trailer for *Dolls* has a voiceover that claims the film is ""a new direction for Takashi Kitano: beautiful and cruel love stories"" - a claim correct on both counts.  The film is simply gorgeous, meticulously framed and bathed in eye-bleeding color; the storytelling is like a knife to the heart.  *Dolls* is also a slow go, requiring patience and contemplation: it's 'arthouse' cinema to the tee, tiptoeing upon the precipice between aesthetic evocation and outright pretension.  In my opinion it lands safely on the substantive side - Kitano knows what he's doing here, and none of his metaphors are forced - but opinions will vary.

In one of the opening scenes, a young couple (Hidetoshi Nishijima and Miho Kanno) stride through a cherry blossom grove, their gait slow, dissolute, hinting at interior damage; a silk red cord bounds the two together.  Onlookers and tourists gape at the pair, dubbed the ""bound beggars,"" and, when the cord hits a snag and halts their progress, several chortle at the absurdity.  The forward momentum of the pair is obstructed by something behind them, that which is 'past.'  It's an effective beginning, for the audience is forced to wonder: Who are these two? What has led them to this spiritual impasse? Kitano then proceeds to answer this through a series of flashbacks, constructing the essence of tragic love with understated dialogue, random memories and long, wordless sections featuring the couple trudging through the Japanese countryside, drifting through the lives of others.  These wandering dolls are juxtaposed by two other stories, one involving fandom for J-pop, the other a 30-year absence between former lovers.  Questions are asked, without words: what is the price one will pay for love?

*Dolls* was savaged upon initial release, the attention-span of critics and audience members alike chaffing under the slow, slow, slow progression of events and the surreal metaphors which can simultaneously inspire admiration and impatience (my own impression).  The ending brings everything together, but Kitano makes no concessions to the Western need for positive resolution - according to the director, ""... the notion of love gone wrong dates back very far in Japanese culture. 'Happy ever after' isn't part of our vocabulary.""  The climax of the film, in which the wandering dolls experience the defining moment of their now-devastated relationship, hammers this home in a powerful, poignant way.

Kitano obviously felt frustration at the rejection of his most arty film - in the interview section for *Zatoichi*, he defiantly proclaims that he will continue to balance his crowd-pleasing cinema with more experimental fare - and to that I say bravo.  Creative exploration pushes the boundaries of both the artist and the medium.

*Dolls* is not for everyone - but I enjoyed it, and recommend it with reservations.  Four stars.",1115683200,5,2897,5.224622030237581

2098440,2,B0002H4GUG,"After this movie was over I needed a nap. I'm sure that it was not intended to be this boring, but I just can't get myself to appreciate these Asians mood pieces. I'm sure the goal here was to be some sort of visual poem, but at times it went so over board with the pretension I just had to laugh (a man get shot, and instead of blood, we see...a red leaf fall into a river). That's not to say some of these shots weren't beautiful, they just weren't necessary.  For example, the shot where some of the characters are walking in front of a wall of pinwheels. Yes, it looks very nice, but it is not needed so it detracts from the shot.  I'm just not sure why the Asians are so set on slow paced movies that glorify mood at the expense of narrative.  I don't think of Asia as an especially calm place, well maybe Tibet. At least when you sit down to watch a Ming-liang Tsai movie you know his pacing habits.  It's slow paced because he'll watch somebody walk up a flight of stairs for 10 minutes, here there was stuff going on screen, but it was not useful to the plot either.  Call me crazy but I like my movies with a story.  This one does have some semblance of a story, but (of course) it is fractured. The theme that overrides this movie is success vs. love.  Characters turn on each other because they are too successful or not successful enough, always destroying their personal relationships. Because of this I believe the only character the director truly liked was the lowly street worker.  Yes he had a very unsuccessful job and his love affair was thin to say the least, but at least that came before directing traffic.  A much better Asian movie that touches on a similar topic is ""Oasis.""  That movie explored its ideas without time out for shots of hats falling off a cliff.

8027960,5,B0002H4GUG,"I bought this item and before I watched it I tried to explain the plot to a couple people and failed miserably. I began to worry about whether or not this film would be interesting at all. I am a fan of Takeshi Kitano but I heard in so many places that it was very different from his other work.

  It started off a little slow, a lot of shots seemed to linger a bit longer than you feel comfortable with. While some people would see this as boring and pointless, I began to realize that this film had something deeper, more innate to it. Just the way the shots were made brought a certain life to the film, something that can't be achieved by words alone.

  The film is not about action, or witty dialogue, however it is a film about emotion. I jest that it has a silent protagonist (Matsumoto) since there are actually so few lines spoken by him. Even though there weren't many lines at all, the film focused on character emotion. This can be seen beautifully in Sawako's plight after the ball toy was crushed. Once again it was a shot that lingered, but each time she tried to use it, you could see the sadness in her face, her constant reminder how everything she loves ends up dying. This theme, though never directly said, was so powerful and it made you really feel the emotions of the character.

  This film almost makes you lose all hope, it is a very depressing, real film that most people probably wouldn't appreciate. This is not a fairy tale where everyone lives happily ever after, it brings harsh reality to situations and leaves you with an almost empty feeling at the end.

  I can safely say that this film has a lot to offer to those willing to take it in. If nothing else appreciate the beauty of the camera shots taken as this is another amazing point of the film. The scenery is nothing short of astounding throughout the film.
  This film needs to be taken in and allowed to swell inside for a good while to really understand it, like I said, approach with an open mind and you will not be disappointed; after all, it is a Takeshi Kitano film, and it doesn't fail to deliver.",1183680000,3,2100,4.337595907928389

I go through all of this history because I want to be clear that I have the highest respect for Takeshi Kitano, and I think this film has a wonderful base to it, but as a whole product I find it rather wanting and even a little redundant, giving me the willies at the thought that Takeshi Kitano might be falling back on previous success to define some of his latest work, and I think that would be an extreme shame for someone who has been so creative and multifaceted.

_Dolls_ revolves on the metaphor of misery--the sadness that people create in their own lives and the prices they pay with that sadness.  The centerpiece is the sad story of Matsumoto and Sawako.  These two youngsters plan to get married, but then Matsumoto caves in to pressure from his parents to marry the daughter of his boss.  On the day of the wedding, Matsumoto finds out that Sawako tried to kill herself.  Matsumoto leaves the wedding to get Sawako out of the hospital, and he leaves everything (his parents, his job, his future) to take Sawako away.

But Sawako is greatly ill from her traumatic experience and is almost child-like, especially in the way she wanders off, so Matsumoto ties them together with a red clothesline, and they become known as the 'bound beggars.'  Their wandering lets them encounter others who have their own pain in their lives--an aging yakuza who regrets leaving behind his first girlfriend, a disfigured pop star and her stalker, etc.  We watch as they struggle with their lives, which have been made nearly unbearable by their mistakes and decisions.  Some may have the capacity to end happily, but all will clearly struggle.  Hidetoshi Nishijima and Miho Kanno are quite wonderful as the young couple, and Takeshi Kitano even throws in some comic relief through a wheelchair-bound moocher and his lackey (and even a pair of salarymen who serve as a kind of chorus).

In all, the ideas and the metaphors are tight in this film, but the execution lessens my interest in this.  It would almost seem that Kitano learned a kind of laundry list of items to throw in for critical appeal (random slow-mo sequences, alinearity, deep-sounding soundtrack but really just inappropriate for the most part and annoying) and runs through the gamut when out to make an arthouse film.  These tricks were already used in films like _Fireworks_ and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kikujiro/dp/B00004Z1FE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kikujiro</a>, and so here they feel a little stale and out of place.  Kitano's meditative leads has also been a little played out by now, and so this film gets dragged down by its forced stylism that comes across more as Kitano trying to make sure that it is indeed Kitano behind the camera, just like Quentin Tarantino has to make sure that you know when he's in the director's chair.

This film may get some critical praise from those who are suckers for this kind of stylization, but I have high hopes that Kitano will find his own way to tell his stories quite uniquely with each film and get him that kind of spot that Kurosawa or Scorsese holds.",1182038400,3,4736,6.094736842105263
8027962,4,B0002H4GUG,"Matsumoto left his job on his wedding day to return to his true love Sawako, who in despair at his decision to marry another girl (the daughter of his boss) for parental approval tried to kill herself. She failed, and her attempt left her speechless, emotionally vacant, and prone to bizarre behavior like shoplifting. But he devotes himself fully to her, and throughout the film the two lovers reconnect not only literally but also metaphorically when, bound by a red cord around their waists, they wander together as ""bound beggars"" throughout the four seasons of the year. In a parallel love story, the old man Hiro reflects on how he left his girl for a job when he was as young (the opposite of Matsumoto's choice). He too reconnects since when he left decades earlier his lover promised to wait for him every Saturday with a box lunch. True to her word, Hiro finds her waiting, in the same dress and in the exact same place. In a third story, a famous pop icon Haruna is disfigured in a car accident, and agrees to meet an infatuated groupie, Nukui, who blinded himself out of devotion to her. Tragedy, tenderness, devotion, and brutal murders characterize all three stories. Dolls was an official selection at film festivals in Toronto, London, New York, and Cannes. The visuals in this film are stunning, but I am sure that the cultural subtleties and symbolism are lost on viewers like me who do not understand Japanese culture well enough.
