8260024,5,B0015V86GS,"I have seen this movie in theater, but watching it in the house in BLU-RAY is amazing. This is a worth buying and owning your own copy. I'm still trying to watch the minute details that Shankar has created in each scenes. Worth a buy.",1314144000,,234,4.222222222222222
8260025,5,B0015V86GS,"This is really an awesome entertainer from beginning to end. Rajnikanth Rocks and there is no words to describe the music and songs and also the picturisation of the same. I really don't understand couple of negative reviews. I guess they are from people who cannot digest rajini's success
This movie was a runaway success with all the indians across the globe and the proof for that is that this is was one of the top grossers of indian cinema.",1281744000,,445,4.575
8260026,5,B0015V86GS,"I watched this film with my wife, who is from Indonesia, and she loves Indian Cinema. We love the films ""Ankahee"" and ""Red The Dark Side"". We are big Esha Deol, Celina Jately and Amisha Patel fans. ""Sivaji"" is almost impossible to explain: part love story, part music videos, part action film, part melodrama and ALL HEART. This 3 hour extravaganza is heart-warming and fun. Rajnikanth's performance in the lead is jaw-dropping. He is in fact ""The Boss"" and takes command of his lead character with wit, talent and skill all rolled into one. His singing and dancing sessions are phenomenal. Must-have film. 10/10.",1279065600,,613,4.903846153846154
8260027,2,B0015V86GS,"A typically overblown Shanker production, with some of the ugliest song sequences in recent Tamil movie history.  The director is out-of-control here, displaying his penchant for excess, for visual kitsch, for colours that are so over-saturated that they might induce nausea. There are whole segments --such as Rajni's efforts at becoming white -- that could have been taken out without hurting the story at all. If the ""Angavai/Sangavai"" joke is what passes for humour and entertainment, then Tamil audiences must be sorely lacking in self-respect. Such ""skin-colour"" scenes made me cringe with shame. How Indian film-makers can get away with such insults in this day and age is beyond me.

As for the blu-ray itself, I was pleasantly surprised by the PQ and AQ, though there seems to be a slight yellowish tint to the whole movie. The colours are overkill, though this is due to the saturation inherent in the cinematography. The transfer is sharp and well-defined. There are no extras. Has novelty value as the first Tamil blu-ray, and up to now one of the very few in the market.",1269043200,,1083,4.945054945054945

8260029,5,B0015V86GS,Sivaji The Boss really boss of all movies..the music scored by a.r.rahman is classy...the movie seems to be in rich environment...super star rajinikanth looks too young in this movie..the clarity of the movie shows the indian cinema to the world class....Kollywood === Hollywood,1260230400,,278,5.488372093023256
