8046921,5,B0002MFG1Y,this is one of those movies you just laugh out loud and don't care who's listening. Well worth the money,1439078400,,104,4.25
8046922,4,B0002MFG1Y,Stil funny even after the passage of time.,1426204800,,42,4.375
8046923,3,B0002MFG1Y,Average British farce  brought up to the then new moral standards of the early 70's with some modest nudity. Leslie Phillips plays his standard lothario role while a number of minor British actors and actresses familiar to British TV audiences have roles. Good nostalgia for us ex-pats.,1416441600,,286,5.085106382978723
8046924,1,B0002MFG1Y,"The version released by the JEZEBEL label is EDITED. All of the nudity has been removed. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE.
Get the one released by WHAM! USA instead. That one has a horrible video transfer, but at least it's not butchered.
The WHAM! USA version is the one with the topless girl facing the other way while people are looking at her through the door, on the DVD artwork.",1305331200,5,375,4.371428571428571
8046925,3,B0002MFG1Y,"I saw the this first as a play by a local group.  Sorry, but I liked the play much better.  The movie was fine, just not as crisp as was the play.  Overall, good british humor.",1227484800,2,176,3.8333333333333335
