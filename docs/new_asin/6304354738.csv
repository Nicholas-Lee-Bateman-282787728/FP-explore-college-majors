At age twenty-one she came into the spotlight as the one chosen to design the Viet Nam Memorial. Since that time she has blossomed and grown as the up and coming premiere architect in this country.
  A Strong Clear Vision is the story of May Lin and her struggles in bringing forth her vision of ""The Wall"" and her ten year career following her achievement. View this young college graduate as she receives the news of the acceptance of her design only to later get embroiled in political controversy surrounding her work. Hear a few embittered Vets denounce her design and disgrace themselves with their prejudice because she is Asian. As a young adult May Lin showed great poise, dignity and courage in defending her design. Such majurity at a young age is a testament to her strength and focused vision.
  Her work moves beyond ""The Wall"" as we are showed her other works notably the Civil Rights Memorial, the Yale Women's Table and the Juniata Peace Chapel. In the former she makes use of the elements of water and circles to evoke messages of timelessness and participation within the events depicted. In the latter, she incorporates the rich natural architecture of Mother Earth to complement the chapel. May Lin's structures are bold, simplistic and hit at your soul in its deepest core. Through her art one finds healing and peace. The story of this remarkable woman is a testament to our new generation of women reconfiguring the meaning of architecture in our culture.",969753600,19,1585,4.8161764705882355
846701,5,6304354738,"This videotape is outstanding. Maya Lin was an architecture student at Yale when she won the anonymous competition to design and build the Viet Nam Veteran's Memorial in Washington D.C. The documentary chronicles the  controversy over Lin's design and over her as an Asian-American female  architect.
The domentary shows Lin facing the challenge of dealing with  many angry veterans. The film reveals the racism and sexism that were  pervasive in this controversy. Happily, Lin went on to build the memorial.  Touching and painful scenes show hundreds of Viet Nam vets visiting the  wall.
The film also chronicles other works of Lin including the Civil  Rights monument in Alabama and the peace circle at Juniata College in  Pennsylvania. This 90 minute documentary takes you into the mind of an  intelligent, sensitve artist. I recommend it for high school and college  classes dealing with race or gender issues, or any American history class.  The film is also excellent viewing for anyone with personal interests in  architecture.",960163200,18,1034,5.237804878048781

A friend of mine suggested that I watch this video. The first half of the video shows how she was selected for the Vietnam War Memorial and her vision for honoring fallen soldiers and visualizing the suffering involved when she was only in her early 20's.  The second half shows her work on the Civil Rights Memorial in Alabama and her more recent works.  This should be a MUST view video for young girls.  It demonstrates courage, hardships, perseverance and belief in one's own vision despite ridicule from others and racial discrimination.  My three children (16, 14, and 11) watched it with me and they really enjoyed learning about her.",1351728000,3,786,4.742647058823529
846819,5,6304354738,"Part of the turbulent 1960s, the war in Vietnam was a brutal experience for not only the soliders who fought it, but for American society as a whole. In the late 1970s a group of Vietnam veterans began seeking to have a monument erected on the Washington Mall. The project was approved and a blue-ribbon panel was chosen to select the winning design from anonymous submissions. When the panel made a final choice, everyone was disconcerted--some even shocked--to find that it had been created by Maya Lin, a twenty year old art student at Yale.

MAYA LIN: A STRONG CLEAR VISION describes how and why that student came to the idea of a black, reflective wall as a monument. The documentary, which won an Academy Award, also takes pains to note that Lin, her design, and even members of the jury that selected it came under tremendous attack from members of congress and many veterans groups. The design was described as ugly, a gash in the earth, a huge boomerang; Lin, a Chinese-American, was frequently the victim of racial slurs. At least one member of the selection jury was attacked as a communist and others were attacked as Vietnam protesters by both conservative congressmen and right-wing columnist Pat Bucchanan. At one point the project was blocked until a congressional panel was able to placate the monument's detractors by inclusion of an American flag and a more traditional sculpture--elements that Lin, although a very young and somewhat inexperienced woman, successfully fought to keep separate from her original design. It is worth pointing out that, although the flag and the sculpture (and another sculpture since added) have been praised, they pale in comparison to Lin's creation, which silenced all critics from the moment it was dedicated in 1982.

Although Lin is most clearly remembered as the creator of the Vietnam memorial in Washington D.C., the documentary explores a number of her other works, including a major monument to the struggle for Civil Rights, placed in Montgomery, Alabama; Open-Air Peace Chapel at Juniata College; and the Women's Table fountain at Yale University. Throughout the documentary, Lin remains a somewhat mysterious figure, and we learn only a few essentials about her as a person: her father was an artist, her mother an English teacher, and her background a creative one that emphasized rightness and importance over financial success. But scenes showing her at work are very telling. She is clearly a highly focused woman immersed in her work. The early works noted in the film were highly successful; her later works were sometimes less so (the notorious ""punch card park"" at Ohio University a case in point.) Even so, she has remained a major artist for three decades, her great gift being an eye for large-scale installations and monuments.

The DVD offers good visual and sound elements; it has little in the way of bonus material. But the documentary does not really require support: like Maya Lin, like her own work, it is what it is--and it is graceful, powerful, and moving. Recommended.

846820,5,6304354738,"I discovered this film several years ago in a public library. I am a middle school teacher who is always looking for relevant ideas and concepts to teach my students. I have used this tape in the past for Women's History Month as well as celebrating the joys of art. It is wonderful! The students enjoyed it and were surprised to learn that such a young woman made a strong impact on our interpretation of the human experience.

design of the Vietnam Memorial. The bulk of this documentary tells
the story of how she came to design it and the controversy that ensued
as a result of her design; this part is well worth the price of admission.

An overall excellent documentary.  Though it concentrates mostly on her
works and her relationship to them, there is a general lack of standard
biographical fare such as personal information and such, I didn't miss
that.

846824,5,6304354738,"After watching the absorbing, subtly moving film `Maya Lin - A Strong Clear Vision' it was easy to see why it won the Academy Award in the category of `Best Documentary Feature' in 1995. Its intent is clearly to convey so much more than just providing the viewing audience with an intimate look at the talented and introspective young Asian college student who designed the controversial Vietnam War Memorial.

As Maya's work and theories of design, architecture, and sculpture are presented to the audience we slowly begin to realize how much her inner world serves as a microcosm and barometer for the turbulent, emotional atmosphere of Post-Vietnam trauma and the ensuing social upheaval which was in the process of drastically altering the collective consciousness of our 20th century landscape. As Maya's personal, artistic journey is examined within the framework of that specific time and place in American culture a broader, holistic understanding comes into focus. Her art and its gifts of remembrance, acceptance and healing becomes our reward for embracing her journey as our own. It's truly a transformative vision which ultimately is what art is all about.

846898,5,6304354738,"When Maya Lin was just a twenty-one year old architecture student at Yale, the committee for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial chose her proposal (a class assignment, it turns out) from a national competition of 1,441 submissions as the winning design. Then the battle began. Congress people and even Vietnam veterans opposed it, the latter caricaturing it as a ""big, black scar in the earth."" Others compared it to a boomerang. Lin was vilified as a communist. And a memorial designed by an Asian, woman, college student? In the end, after congressional hearings at which the young Lin testified, her design was built and then dedicated in 1982. I have taken my family to the memorial when we visited Washington and, along with virtually everyone who has visited, can attest to the incredibly evocative power of this public monument. The first half of this documentary covers the VVM; the last half reviews her other prominent works, namely, the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, the Museum of African Art, the Wexner Center at Ohio State University, a fountain commemorating the contributions of women at Yale, an open air Peace Chapel, and her work with the Presidio project in San Francisco. I am always inspired and encouraged to follow the story of a person whose sense of vocation is so strong and crystal clear.

846900,4,6304354738,"i watched this film after viewing Nathaniel Kahn's more personal depiction of his father. The latter one is an intimate conversation with the dead. This one is asking the viewers to share the growing process of a living person, in parallel to and through events in the recent history of the USA. A leitmotif of time and history running along with personal perception and interpretation of these events.

Maya's architecture, funny to say, is a lot about the sensuality of touch, which goes beyond the visual. Never in any other film about an architect's work does the audience being so moved - by the detail depiction of a hand touching a piece of stone engraved with names; the quiet flow of a thin film of water over a piece of stone being interrupted by the tip of fingers tracing the history of a place....tears....

We see in Kahn's architecture an emptiness of self in order to contain the infinity of the universe in the most cerebral way; while Lin's is an embracement of the past, present and future in the most romantic and sensuous. Sometimes i wonder if it is turning architecture into too much an emotional apparatus?

Anyway, i would recommend such interesting parallel viewing of the two films about these 2 american architects.",1140048000,4,1243,4.772093023255814

The Vietnam Memorial, and the hardships of it's creation, show the young woman's strength.  It's truely a feat worth the history books.  The most striking thing I got out of this film though was the fact that it wasn't a fluke.  The rest of her work is just as incredible, even if not as well known.  I'm so glad that I saw this film.

846903,5,6304354738,"This documentary film is a unique experience for which it is difficult to find a comparison.  On a basic level, the film discusses several projects of artist/architect Maya Lin, a young Chinese-American woman who unexpectedly won the design competition for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial while a Yale student.  Her design, a departure from conventional expectations, is now famous, and is the most visited memorial in Washington D.C.  Some of the strong feelings that the Vietnam War elicits in people, especially its veterans, is touched upon in moving live scenes at the Memorial and in the controversial hearings that were held in the wake of the design's selection.  The experience put Maya Lin in a national spotlight and forced the student to mature very quickly addressing the grievances of veterans and others.  In the end, with some minor site additions, the Memorial stood as designed, with the names of all the soldiers who gave their lives in Vietnam etched in its simple, polished, reflective granite.  Other works of Maya Lin, including the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama; the Yale Women's Table; and others demonstrate a similar simplicity and poetry that is both moving and powerful.  There are moments in the film, as simple as when the artist is working at her drafting table, that suggest something both beautiful and spiritual, providing a deep insight into the creative process of this noted public artist.",1085184000,21,1440,5.15450643776824
846904,3,6304354738,"Narrative and Thematic Summary
 At the age of 20 and still a student at Yale University, Maya Lin won a national design competition for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Mock recounts through interviews with Lin, the veterans who organized the memorial project and the complicated, politically messy process that led to erecting the famously moving piece. After much public protest (mainly from Vietnam War veterans), hearings were held to consider ways to incorporate more traditional images in the monument. Somehow, all the details were worked out. Throughout the entire controversy, Lin stood up to her critics with an intellectual integrity that ultimately aided in the persuasion of the construction of the monument.
Lin's continued growth as an artist and as a human being is the real subject of this film. Mock shows Lin working on other soon-to-be famous designs such as her Civil Rights Memorial in Alabama, another large engraved stone piece. She also shows Lin visiting sites of other sculptures and buildings she would design. It is clear how strongly she relates to the earth and to the ground on which her structures will stand, and how directly her natural surroundings determine the direction of her work.
Overall, the film is a fitting tribute to an artist who has had a wondrous career for someone so young, and has a long great career ahead.
Technical Evaluation
 Cinematography
  The cinematography in ""Maya Lin"" is somewhat unadorned, as it is with most documentary films. It is more on a realistic level that is concerned with content rather than form or technique. Due to this realistic style, however, the film does a decent job in portraying the intense size of the Vietnam Memorial, the political symbolism of the documents against the Memorial and the artistic symbolism behind Lin's design drawings. It also does a good job in displaying what future generations will consist of and how they will be affected by segregation decisions of blacks in the Civil Rights movement.
  Another aspect of the film in which the cinematography comes into play would be the scenes where various documents and designs were scanned by the camera. Throughout the period of the film that involved the Vietnam Memorial controversy, there were numerous shots of various documents related to the issue. One notable document was the one that stated that there should be revisions to the existing design (such as using a white wall instead of black and having a statue if Vietnam soldiers included in the design), otherwise the Fine Arts Committee would stop all further progress in the implementation of the design. The official document that described the above statement was filmed from a high-angled close-up shot to make it look like we, the viewers, were the actual members of the Fine Arts Committee (or some other body) looking down at this document and trying to make a decision as to the continuation or termination of the design. The shot also focuses on certain words within the document (words that described the memorial as being a disgrace, etc) in order to symbolize that protestors did not understand the art of the design and were instead focusing more on political issues dealing with it. By focusing on these political issues within the shot, the film shows that there is somewhat of a ""political smear"" in the Fine Arts Committee in that the committee, as well as other protestors, would rather stress political issues (ie- using a white wall instead of black) instead of appreciating the design for what it truly was.
Sound
 The sound in ""Maya Lin"" does a good job in displaying maturity levels, emotions, and symbolic meanings in terms of the Civil Rights movement. The levels of maturity, for example, are expressed in the different sounds and voices of the players. A good example of this concept would be the way Lin sounds in her younger years opposed to the way she sounds in her adult years. The scene where Lin was standing at the podium (when she found out that she had won the contest for the Vietnam Memorial) revealed her immaturity. At this point in her life she was an undergraduate student of about 22 years of age. Her constant giggling was a way of releasing tension and nervousness because she knew that she had beaten many other famous, well-known architects. Also, the fact that she still did not quite understand that she had won the contest displayed her immaturity. This first step of success for Lin was a certain clash with her success as a mature, successful artist that we see throughout the rest of the film. The mature, successful Maya Lin that we see in many interview clips (possibly ten years after she won the Vietnam Memorial contest) are due to the calm, confident sounds of her voice when she speaks. Her mature sounds present her as an intelligent individual who has learned a lot from her work over the years.
 Lastly, the music in ""Maya Lin"" does a decent job in portraying certain symbolic meanings. A notable scene that would support this concept would be the scene where the blacks saw the completed Civil Rights monument. As the black people (including Rosa Parks) walked toward the monument for the first time, the famous Civil Rights Movement Anthem played in the background. This anthem was titled ""We Shall Overcome."" This song did a great job in describing the endless efforts of the blacks for social equality. The words ""we shall overcome"" alone have powerful meaning in that the blacks would eventually overcome the social and economic oppressions against their race.",1082505600,3,5542,4.9388412017167385

However, the documentary itself was somewhat flat and boring. Granted, I watched this documentary in a classroom setting where every movie shown can cause a college student to fall deep into the depths of sleep, but I still think the documentary could have been more interesting. I have watched documenatries about other artists, such as Chihuly, which were very captivating, but unfortunately this one was not. It's unfortunate because we all can learn so much from Maya Lin's creative processes.

in the film she explains what the concept is and why she designed what she did. maya lin redefined what a war memorial was all about. as she said it was for the living as well as the dead. by being able to touch the names of their lost loved ones the living got more out of this than a statue with a few unknown soldiers.

many veterans opposed the monument but when you hear them praise her and show her interaction with veterans groups you almost cry. a few still wanted the horse or hill and soldiers so she added one near the entrance but far enough away to not detract from the actual memorial.

the film goes onto other memorials she has done and in their own way they tell a story and her concepts for the design are as significant. but none, to my mind, embody such emotion as she put into the vietnam vets memorial.",1385856000,2,1213,4.13135593220339
