2393018,5,B000ASDFI6,I watched all three of these movies. Fantastic. It's your typical shoot'em up movie with a vengeance. Great Price for all three. Does not take away from shelve space. Perfect.,1171152000,3,175,4.866666666666666
2393019,5,B000ASDFI6,"What is there to say... These movies have it all from drama, comedy, action, ect... If you're a dude get it for the action and gun fights, and for you ladies d'uh its got Antonio Banderas for you in there. Anyhoo stop reading this and buy it.",1163030400,8,242,4.170212765957447
2393020,5,B000ASDFI6,This is just a great collector's item. All the extra's on the dvd make it extra special.,1162512000,2,88,4.235294117647059
2393021,5,B000ASDFI6,This is a great deal.  These 3 movies are amazing and the price cant be beat.  El Mariachi is in Spanish with no option for english over dubbing but there are subtitles and it is a great movie.  Desperado is just classic and Once apon a time in Mexico was surprisingly really good as well.,1154304000,25,289,4.218181818181818
2393022,5,B000ASDFI6,"There is some confusion as to the releases in this set, based on the reviews so far and the limited information in the amazon.com description. I hesitated to buy it at first based on the fact that the back of the outer case simply had credits and the typical info box for all three films giving the languages and aspect ratios of the films, but nothing as to the other content of the discs contained.

Here is what is included in the set:

Disc 1:

El Mariachi (Special Edition)

- 1.85:1 Widescreen Anamorphic/81 Minutes

- Director's Commentary

- Robert Rodriguez's Short Film ""Bedhead""

- ""10-Minute Film School""

Disc 2:

Desperado (Special Edition)

- 1.85:1 Widescreen Anamorphic/103 Minutes

- Director's Commentary

- ""10 More Minutes with Robert Rodriguez: Anatomy of a Shootout""

Disc 3:

Once Upon a Time in Mexico

- 1.78:1 Widescreen Anamophic/102 Minutes

- Director's Commentary

- Deleted Scenes

- Film is Dead: An Evening with Robert Rodriguez

- Ten-Minute Flick School

- Ten-Minute Cooking School

- Inside Troublemaker Studios

- The Anti-Hero's Journey

- The Good, the Bad and the Bloody: Inside KNB FX

So this set re-packages the most recent release of each of the titles into a great little package. Little being the key word - this set uses the slim-line DVD cases often used in TV on DVD packaging and most recently seen in the Ghostbusters 1 & 2 Double Feature Gift Pack. Two slim-line cases take up the space of a single standard DVD case, so this set with 3 slim-line cases is nice and compact.

The transfer of El Mariachi here is the newest one (""From the original negatives supervised by Robert Rodriguez"") not the older 1.66:1 transfer from the earlier Director's Double Feature release.

Also worthy of note is that all 3 film are Anamorphic despite the packaging indicating that El Mariachi and Desperado are just ""Widescreen"" while Once Upon a Time in Mexico is listed as ""Anamorphic Widescreen."" Columbia Tri-Star has always had a bad habit of not indicating when releases were anamorphic although most of their early releases were in fact anamorphic.",1130889600,262,2092,4.872159090909091
2393023,4,B000ASDFI6,"To my opinion ""Desperado"" is the best entry in the trilogy. It's very stylish and romantic. Many people consider ""El Mariachi"" to be the best and I won't argue although I don't like the first film. ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" consists of many first-rate stars and therefore is interesting to watch but it lacks the freshness and novelty of the previous both. As I think the whole trilogy sticks to ""Desperado"", this film is like a magnet that attracts the other two.

But that's a question - to buy or not to buy? I wouldn't. Of course the price of the trilogy is impressive but there practically are no bonus features here. I'd rather purchase all three separately. On the other hand all those trilogy boxes look very good. So if you're a really crazy fan of Robert Rodriguez I think you'll prefer to by both the trilogy box and all three editions separately.

4 1/2 for the movies and 3 for the edition.",1128988800,12,906,4.451807228915663
2393024,5,B000ASDFI6,"I am very happy with this collection being offered as a trilogy.  I only have one complaint & that is that I don't understand why they would take the time to dub it in French & not English for the 1st movie "" El Mariachi"".  I would think there would be a lot bigger demand for it in America.  Other than that the movies are great.  I may be wrong but I thought Robert Rodriguez had worked in the film industry for years in stunts & special effects...& if this is true I am not surprised that his debut in the world of Directing was highly successful.  Many people claim to notice a marked improvement in his directing personally I don't,  I just see bigger budgets & more popular actors I feel he had the whole Directing thing down from right out of the gate!!!  P.S.  So Sorry I was thinking about Tom Savini as far as being involved with stunts and special effects for years. I realized my mistake after seeing a picture of Robert Rodriguez.  I think my mistake may have spawned from both men's involvement with Quentin Tarantino.",1498176000,2,1032,4.361256544502618

The story line is simple,  good guy being attacked by bad guys.  I liked the leading man, he returns in the second movie with Antonio Banderas as one of his compadres in battle, I also believe his name is in the credits as a producer.  All of Robert Rodriguez's films are a joy for me to view on my day off, including Spy Kids.",1304294400,,513,4.3125

I have personal reasons why I enjoy Desperado the most however don't discredit the last movie in this series.  Good movies that you should see at least and the extras are your standard trailers, pictures and commentaries.  Geth this set for the movies, not the special features.",1222646400,5,471,4.583333333333333
2393067,4,B000ASDFI6,"*El Mariachi (4 stars out of 5)
For a very low-budget film, this is very well-made.  Even though it has very grainy picture quality, the filming style is very excellent.  It is a simple but great story filled with great action scenes and great characters.  It is entirely in Spanish with English subtitles, and includes a commentary track, a short film, and a making-of featurette.

*Desperado (4 stars out of 5)
With a higher budget, this film surpasses its predessor both in quality and in style.  It has excellent image and sound quality.  There are loads of slick action scenes.  The story is not bad, and has some excellent characters.  It is well-written.  Music was good.  It is mostly in English with subtitles for Spanish-speaking parts, and includes a commentary, a making-of featurette, and I believe it has a free demo for video-editing software.

*Once Upon a Time in Mexico (4 stars out of 5)
This last film has some of the biggest and best action scenes of the trilogy.  It still has great video/sound quality, a good filming style, good writing, good characters, and good music.  The only thing that really suffers is the story, which is convoluted and seems to have too many characters to keep track of.  Again, it is mostly English with subtitled Spanish-speaking parts.  It includes a bunch of featurettes, a commentary, and some deleted scenes.

All of these films are exciting, entertaining, and very well-made.  All discs are special editions, and contain a wealth of extras.  Only the first film seems to have poor image quality, since it is so grainy, but it also accentuates the grittiness of the film and can be considered a benefit.  The other two films have nearly perfect quality.  Overall, this is a great set and is well worth the price.",1219968000,14,1768,4.791390728476821

2393069,4,B000ASDFI6,"I'm a huge Rodriguez fan, and it all started here for him.  The only thing that kept this from being a 5 is I can't reconcile that fact that El Mariachi is dubbed.  Banderas does a fantastic job in Desperado, as does Selma Hayak, and Depp is added to the outstanding performance list in Once Upon a Time",1205452800,4,303,4.206896551724138

2393071,5,B000ASDFI6,"Robert Rodriguez is one of the most talented directors of our time. Starting out with only one video camera and $7000, he produced a film that captured the attention of Hollywood mainstream. In viewing his ""10 minute film school"" and ""10 minute cooking school"" sections, you see that he is a very down to earth artist. He makes his own scores to movies, edits, produces...he's the all in one movie maker.

The Mexico Trilogy epitomizes the start of Rodriguez's career and how he transitions from movie to movie with the knowledge he has gained through experience. It is a must own for any action lover, independent film goer, or fan of the actors (Johnny Depp, Selma Hayek, Antonio Banderez).",1193875200,3,692,4.815126050420168

2393073,5,B000ASDFI6,"Starting with ""Bedhead"", and traveling through the Mexico Trilogy (sprinkled with a little ""Spy Kids"" here and there), you can see him educate himself and develop into a talented film maker.  And he shares what he's learned with his audience along the way, by including his ""Ten Minute Film (and Cooking) Schools"".

You get the feeling, watching the special features included with the DVD packages, that he never sleeps, and that he needs to control all aspects of his creations, so that they are HIS and no one elses.  This is a fine way to be (think Orson Welles); but I hope he can keep a grip on reality.",1174694400,3,608,4.559633027522936

8079706,2,B000ASDFI6,"El Mariachi: sort of legendary and sort of OK, it's like the Evil Dead in that what was learned here would be put to better use elsewhere.

Desperado: The star of this show and just a completely fun movie from the era of senseless violence and witty dialog. Steve Buscemi and Quentin Tarantino show up for goofs, Cheech Marin is the sly townie bartender, Danny Trejo is here (before he became a caricature of himself later) and obvs Banderas is the supercool Mariachi and Salma Hayek his spicy better half. It's a bit of The Man With No Name and a bit of Kill Bill and some quirky Coen Bros kind of banter too. This is the main attraction. You should probably look for this or a combination of the first two.

That said, Once Upon a Time in Mexico is utter garbage: A complete misuse of the cartoonish Johnny Depp and befuddled Willem Dafoe. It is worse than Ewoks, so much worse than Godfather III, worse even than putting forth Richard Pryor in a western suit portraying a computer hacker as a palatable construct in (the amazingly-better-than-this-crapfest) Superman III. The bottom of the second-sequel barrel. Watch this and you will know his name is Robert Rodriguez, for he is truly this trilogy's killer and the Ruiner of Dreams.

Lay your vengeance elsewhere. you can probably get El Mariachi/Desperado for half this price and Desperado on its own for the cost of a fancy coffee. If you really must use the two hours you had scheduled for  ...Mexico, watch Sin City. Thank me later.",1509062400,,1491,4.636363636363637

8079708,5,B000ASDFI6,"If a sequel is done well, it is my tendency to think of the sequel as merely a later part in a single tale. Robert Rodriguez has thrown this principle out the window. While I do think all three are well done, they do not seamlessly tell a single story, as normally I would expect. If we do begin with El Mariachi, the tale of two visitors from out of town who are mistaken as if they are both Azul, the disenfranchised past employee of a drug cartel who returns with vengeance on his mind and guns in a guitar case. The second, carrying a real guitar, is distrusted partly because drug cartel thugs know an enemy with a guitar case is on the way. So, the two are confused with one another and together add up to quite an enemy.
Desperado, which is part two, looks back on that first story, but it's as if the person telling the story remembers it as if through a drunken or drugged stupor. The general pieces are there, but the telling bears very little resemblance to what happened.
On this principal of exaggerated story-telling we see in Desperado, Once Upon a Time in Mexico does more of the same but picks up where Desperado left off. As a Star Trek fan, I see a lot of Star Trek fans who pick apart problems with the incongruent nature of the various stories purportedly connected, and they do have a way of keeping that fiction in line with itself. However, since Mr. Rodriguez has rewritten the nature we otherwise might have expected in sequels, the person who in any respect may be a fan of the work of Rodriguez or these particular movies will have to likewise ignore any problems with incongruent plot.
I bought El Mariachi some years ago and was so impressed that when Desperado came out, I bought that too. I was excited to see Once Upon a Time in Mexico come out and I remember buying that but those three various products were 1 - loaned out; 2 - loaned out; and 3 - burned in a house fire. So, I am very glad to see them again in my collection.",1504137600,2,1961,4.288409703504043
8079709,5,B000ASDFI6,"These three movies were more than I expected. I do not speak the language! Therefore, the first movie, in the series' was sub-titled beautifully so that I HAD to sit and watch to get the true meaning of what was going on in the background.  After the shock of not seeing Antonio Bandares in the first movie, I recovered quickly. If you are familiar with the trauma Mexico has suffered in the past and even now is troubled with, you wish they had heroes like the Son's Of Mexico fighting on the side of justice. I love diverse films and this one is one of the best I have purchased. Lots of violence, lots of drama.
