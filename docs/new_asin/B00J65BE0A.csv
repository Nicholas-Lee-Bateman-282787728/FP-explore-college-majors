8648534,3,B00J65BE0A,"I think the problem with the movie as opposed to the book, is the
difficulty in picturing the way the scenery is depicted in the book
and the way the film version has tried to depict the scenery as
it was in the book.  This difficulty, in my opinion can not be
resolved because  a reader can ""see"" the scenery as shown
and it will not take much time.  The scenery is just a part of what
the character is experiencing; whereas, the movie seems to stop
the free-flow of the story for the reader to just see the scenery.
Also, the subject matter has too much profundity
for a movie.  Fast-moving pictures do not allow for reflection.
This may be one of those times that a movie version is not the
best medium for a book.",1531785600,,717,4.211678832116788

and Spirituality wrapped up in one story. Like the book, the story is told through real life experiences
and each lesson is unfolded in a natural and poignant way. I love the ending-perhaps because I know
the third dimension is moving up into a more harmonious one during our times. And each of us has
a role in helping to raise consciousness. One of my favorites!",1410048000,3,464,4.470588235294118
