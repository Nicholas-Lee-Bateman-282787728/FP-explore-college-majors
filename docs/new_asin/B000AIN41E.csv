It has since become ""our"" movie.

It is unassuming, often tender, somewhat exciting, and suspenseful. I can also see why other reviewers have called it ""slow"". It is, but only because that is what life is like in the community where the story is set; out of the way and idyllic. I have since let other people borrow the DVD, but because I talked it up too much they didn't find it nearly as good. Therein lies the problem: how do I recommend a movie which I found to be a treasure primarily because of my lack of prior expectations?

My advice: watch it when you are in a restive mood and not in a rush. Just enjoy it for what it is.",1368144000,,885,4.224852071005917
8078572,5,B000AIN41E,"This was a great DVD, I purchased it after reading the book. It has never been released in the US, I don't know why. I had difficulty getting it to play on my DVD player so used my computer. A friend said it worked on her DVD. It is worth watching.k",1314921600,,249,3.9019607843137254
8078573,5,B000AIN41E,"I just purchased this DVD being a fan of Richard Dreyfuss and was excited about seeing this movie because I have heard good things about it. I had to first purchase a Region Free DVD player though because it is not released in Region 1 which is crazy! I know all the hang ups about its release in the US and all but come on!!!!

Anyway, this movie is fantastic and Richard Dreyfuss is amazing in it. I won't go through what it is all about because it is reviewed above. It is a bit of a slow mover but in the end you really get that good feeling from it. This is a different pace for Richard Dreyfuss but he can adapt to every character with ease it seems and does a fine job. I definitely would recommend this film to anyone that can get their hands on it. Right now being that it is not availible in Region 1 it feels special to be able to view this movie and have it in my collection. For any Richard Dreyfuss fans, don't pass up this movie!",1225584000,,944,4.048128342245989

8078575,5,B000AIN41E,"The movie is a real 5 star item. Dreyfus plays the main character in true fashion and does the book (which is a 10 star item), a real honor with his performance of Antonio Jose Bolivar Proa&ntilde;o ( The old man). The real sad part is that the author is Chilean, El Idilio, town where the story takes palce is somewhere between Peru ,Bolivia and Brasil's Amazonean region and the movie, is released and available in region 2 format? Spain? Come on.., Dreyfus is american (REGION 1). The author is from South America and the story take place in South America (REGION 4) and it is not available in either region's format? Good marketing focus! I only hope they will sometime make it avilable to the public this side of the world. Everyone who cares about the environment, the future of our world, sustained by the world's green areas and tropical forests will benfit from the message put forward by the book and projected in the movie.",1165881600,,934,4.598802395209581
