2726583,4,B000M7XRGU,I found this movie to be funny since I like National Lampoon's type of humor.  I would recommend the movie at an affordable price.,1355961600,,130,4.416666666666667
2726584,1,B000M7XRGU,This is more of a documentary than a movie. Its like a really really really bad version of Spring Break Videos. remind of of E!'s Wildon episodes with out the fun stuff ha,1273017600,,171,4.212121212121212
2726585,1,B000M7XRGU,"I am flat out ashamed that I have even seen this movie. National Lampoons has really lent their name to so many bad projects recently, scaring a great legacy.  This DVD is just bad. Yes, expectations were low, but Come on, I thought it might have a story or some humor.  Nope, just Nikki Ziering half naked periodically throughout the movie to capture the dumb male viewer (forced to include myself now), and a bunch of film of idiot College kids getting drunk.  After half way, I just hit fast forward, but it didn't make it any better.  And the story they tried with the two loosers in vegas...not funny.  I am left ashamed of seeing this. Avoid at all cost.  Don't even waste the time to rent it.",1175126400,26,699,4.37984496124031
2726586,4,B000M7XRGU,"Wow, I have Spring Break fever after watching this DVD!!  It's a non-stop party in paradise.  Perfect excuse to have your friends over in bikini's, crack a couple beers, and dream about getting out of town.  Cabo seems like the biggest rockin' fiesta of all... that's where my gals and I going!!",1173657600,4,295,4.634615384615385
