5944287,2,B00EUI4XHE,"Paula Malcomson, as Ray's wife, should have been killed off by the writers in the first episode.  Women may enjoy watching her constantly emasculating her husband, but men want that bitch put down.  I'm not saying something over the top, just her car going off a 500 foot cliff with Ray's father at 100mph, with the trunk packed with C4 and ball bearings, and the car exploding in a ball of flames leaving a crater the size of the Arizona meteorite impact.

But we all know the writers would simply re-introduce her character as her evil twin sister, who's even more of a nagging, whining, bitch.

Otherwise, I really like the show and would give it Five Stars.",1394496000,10,661,4.576271186440678
5944288,5,B00EUI4XHE,"I don't understand why this show hasn't recieved has much hype as some other ""binge-worthy"" shows like House of Cards and Homeland.  The acting is superb and the plot lines compelling.  I agree with an earlier reviewer that you need to watch a few episodes before you get where things are going.  Most important, most of characters are likable and sympathetic at times in a gray way.  No black and white here.  In the midst of all the drama the writers inject a little humor making the show more watchable.  Please watch.",1390694400,5,521,4.608695652173913
5944289,3,B00EUI4XHE,"""Ray Donovan"" is sort of the Irish equivalent of ""The Sopranos,"" only much trashier and slimier.  Sleaze, violence and degrading, gratuitous softcore porn are the name of the game here, as Liev Schreiber plays a Hollywood fixer (transplanted from the Irish slums of Boston) whose days are given over to brutally intimidating people with threats of violence in order to get his mainly movie-star clients out of sordid, potentially career-threatening jams.  How this never remotely attracts the attention of the police is never touched upon.  But Ray seems to have blackmail material on everyone in town.  Liev Schreiber has about two facial expressions -- gritty, and confused and gritty.  And a number of his movie star clients seem miscast.  Inexplicably, Jon Voight, portraying Ray's ex-con father, finds himself a participant in this trash.  And Eliot Gould occasionally wanders in and out of the plotline, a glum Jew looking like a deer with his face caught in the headlights. To give you an idea of how debased this series is -- Ray Donovan actually hires someone to kill his own father, and himself kills a priest whom he accuses of having molested him and his brothers when they were growing up in Boston.  The rest of the Donovans are equally low-class sleazy, including his wife and lowlife brothers, who operate out of a seedy gym.  With characters this debauched, repulsive and debased, how are we supposed to care about them?  And many of the machinations and more than a modicum of motivation strain credulity, to put it mildly (in later episodes, Ray blithely strides into the head of the FBI's office and makes threats -- I mean, are we actually supposed to believe this?). The series was apparently created by Ann Biderman, who cut her teeth writing for ""NYPD Blue"" back in the day.  The exposition is weak and confusing, and even after many episodes, it is difficult to discern for instance Eliot Gould's relation to the Ray Donovan character.  If you enjoy wallowing in gratuitous, violent, pornographic sleaze, this series is for you.  If you are not a bottom-feeder, sit this one out.",1390521600,8,2104,4.926345609065156
5944290,5,B00EUI4XHE,"John Voight is amazing in this show. He is a truly bad guy, but he is a good guy also. All of the charcters are great (all of them).  I am addicted to this show, can't wait for season 2.",1387065600,3,186,3.65
5944291,5,B00EUI4XHE,"GREAT new show.  Something for everybody, assuming you enjoy crazy people, stereotypes, boxing, and well written scripts. Jon Voight is just too good as Ray's Dad.  As with all addicting shows, the casting is spot on, the writing good to great, and the end of each episode always leaves you wanting more.  Can't want for season two.",1386979200,10,332,4.7894736842105265

5944293,5,B00EUI4XHE,"Wow, this show blew me away from the first episode and it the plot thickens as it goes. superb acting by John Voight, great Boston accent which makes it believable, great acting by Bunchy which is one of Rays brothers, great soundtrack, found myself singing to "" Natural High"" by Bloodstone anda salsoul classic "" The Beat Goes On""..dont wanna say anything else to spoil it for people that want to purchase , but this series is a winner!!!",1383523200,9,439,4.569620253164557

5944295,1,B00EUI4XHE,"I haven't seen season 2. You take a good premise, a minder to the stars, and turn it in to a lame family drama. The show can not even fake a family of plastic Paddys properly. Are there no Irish American actors out there. Voight - you used to be a star! Dreadful stuff.",1379289600,4,269,4.0
5944296,4,B00EUI4XHE,"Ever find yourself in a mess and wish you had someone to help you out? If you are rich, a celebrity and live in LA you have Ray Donovan. He's a 'Fixer', that's his job, which made me wonder, how do you prepare for this kind of profession?

Liv Schreiber plays Ray, a dark, brooding man who is called at all hours to fix someone's problems. He s employed by Goldman and Drexter, a law firm. This is a tough job, very physical, often employing guns and the like. Fists fly, threats are made. Often the situations are sexual in nature, and Ray knows how to fix everyone's problems. He has a staff who are the best at their work, and the insurance the law firm must have to cover them is probably in the millions.

Ray has a family, wife, Abby,  played by Paula Malcomson, two children, a boy and girl. They are Boston Irish and all came to LA to hide from Ray's father, Mickey, played byJon Voight. The dysfunction in this family is like no other. Mickey is said to be responsible for his daughter's suicide, and has killed a Priest. It sounds like Mickey was part of the Boston Mafia. He went to prison for twenty years, and was let out early, ostensibly to rat on Ray for the FBI.  One happy family, once Mickey journeys to LA to join Ray's brothers at their boxing establishment.

Each episode, and there are 12, opens with a client needing Ray's services. Ray and his wife are always on the 'outs', and he often stays in an apartment in LA. Abby, the wife, seems innocent of what kind of person Ray is, which is difficult to swallow. The biggest complaint I have is of Abby's false Boston accent, drives me crazy, it is so noticeable, and she is the only one who fakes the accent.

The interaction between Ray and his father is often grim and turns personal at times. Liev Schreiber and Jon Voight are superb as father and son. Great acting and believable situations. Top notch writing makes this series one to watch. A second year was picked up recently, so Ray Donovan will be around.

Paul Malcomson, who was awesome in Deadwood, is miscast here.  She just does not fit as Ray's wife, AT ALL.  The ""Bunchy"" character is also awful.  Well acted, but just awful.  The show would be much better if these characters were better and cast properly.

5944323,5,B00EUI4XHE,"It doesn't get any better than this.  Gritty, sexy and powerful.  This breakout series introduces you to Hollywood cleanup guy, Ray Donovan.  He's a nice guy... except when he's cutting up dead bodies and discarding them so that his well heeled clients won't get into any legal trouble.  He fixes all his rich clients' problems- doesn't matter what they are, he's the guy with the skills and connections to make them 'go away'.  ""You're in the solution now,"" he says.  I love it.  He's undeniably violent, but he's rarely the one who kills anyone.  Mostly, it's his clients who do.  He has a family- a loving wife, two kids and two brothers.  Well, actually, that's three when you count the black brother he never knew he had.  Ray's got everything under control- he's rolling in the bucks, buying his wife a mansion in the best part of town and his kids look completely normal.  They don't know what he does for a living.  That is, until his dad comes out of prison and begins to wreck everything he has going.  You will LOVE John Voit as the small time, bumbling criminal, black woman obsessed Mick!  I also loved  Hank Azaria, Liev Schreiber, Paula Malcomson, Eddie Marsan and Dash Mihok.  They are all great.  Be ready for some great cameos from some other favorites too!",1506038400,4,1275,4.616071428571429

5944326,3,B00EUI4XHE,"The show is pretty good, but not great IMHO. Liev is a good actor; I've always liked him. He has that certain ""don't f with me"" look about him and doesn't say more than necessary. Great qualities. But, the show itself has too many ""outrage"" social issues splattered on the show. When the scenes are about the what the description says it's about, (i.e., a fixer who helps the Hollywood elite out of trouble spots), then it's well done. Unfortunately though, after 8 episodes, there's only been a few of these kinds of scenes. In summary (and again, this is just my opinion so don't go off on a rant and get all phony outraged on me) the fixer to social outrage issues ratio is not good enough for me to continue watching...",1503100800,,723,4.443609022556391

The protagonist (no hero,he) deals with more problems in a day than a criminal psychiatrist would face in a year. ""The Sopranos"" is subtle by comparison, and often genuinely touching and funny.

5944384,3,B00EUI4XHE,"The first three episodes were brilliantly written and directed and Voight and Shreiber 's performances were stellar. Suddenly, by Episode 4 it was as if they fired all of the writers and director and replaced them with college film school students. The writing turned to cheese with soap opera level storylines and cliched characters. Watching it required a total suspension of disbelief with hackneyed scenes, fake punches, and painful acting. Donovan's wife turned into an imbecile version of Tony Soprano's wife and it is now apparent that every character is modeled after The Soprano's. By episode 6 I had to stop halfway through because it was more than I could bear. Sometimes Hollywood needs to learn a thing or two about consistency. Too many writers and directors and characters that turn into cartoons. Bummer.",1485302400,,820,5.126865671641791

Just raised the Hollywood standards all the way back to the roof.  Each and every performer in this series goes all the way. Really captures the East Coast Irish ethnic family drama. Like, the Irish Sopranos. But this cast and script is way beyond in scope, really translates the L.A. culture by Beverly Hills and the power brokers there and lays it right on your plate.  This is very real cultures and characters. Whoever is doing Jon Voight's wardrobe should  receive a special award. J.V. could start his own clothing line after this series.",1481500800,,693,4.838983050847458

5944526,5,B00EUI4XHE,Wow ,1476230400,,4,3.0
5944527,5,B00EUI4XHE,"Ray Donovan, is simply one of the best shows on Television. Created and produced by Ann Biderman, who also wrote Primal Fear and Public Enemies and, like Ray Donovan was the producer on Southland, which is currently showing on Itunes and Hulu. Biderman, in keeping with the Paul Schrader tradition of making excellent entertainment out of the seedier side of life brings this idea to cable television.

Completing its fourth season, it stars Liev Schreiber, Paula Malcomson, Eddie Marsan and Jon Voight. The cast also includes some notables in guest appearances as seasonal and recurring characters, Eliot Gould, Lisa Bonet, Frank Walley, James Woods, Hank Azaria, Ian McShane, and a short visit from Ann-Margaret in about two episodes round out a journeyman cast to bring this compelling drama to the small screen.

The show was shot mostly in and around Los Angeles and covers some very familiar sites if you live in that city. Calabasas, North Hollywood, Skid Row downtown, LAX, and Ocean Ave., up on the cliff looking out over the ocean in Santa Monica. Famous landmarks are also used, Sony Studios, Pinks hot dogs, Musso Franks etc. For authenticity, the interiors appear to be shot from inside the locales of these famous exteriors, not on a prefabricated studio lot. I could be wrong about some of that but as someone who does live in L.A. it sure looks like it.

Liev Schreiber, who plays the title role is what is known on the street as a fixer among the rich and famous of L.As elite. Sometimes, but not always they require some muscled violence. He is originally an Irish, Boston south side, hard fighting, hard drinkin tough guy and he brings this skill set to his work.

Shaped by a rather serious and long time molestation of himself and his younger brother by his parish priest growing up , and a criminal father who was never there for him, Rays deep seated issues with his childhood combine with his toughness to form a rather complicated moral code in which he balances his ying and yang in doing the right or wrong thing. This all adds up to a complex character, someone we wish we could be but on the other hand wouldnt want his world for a second.

This continuing paradox in his personality has the viewer testing their own sense of morality. They continually find themselves in support of Rays dalliances with getting it done, even when his vigilantism drives him to the ultimate committing murder. Granted most of the guys he wastes readily deserve it, but if the world were filled with Ray Donovans chaos would ensue, which is why we have laws against this kind of activity in the first place.

As fascinating as Rays character is, his  father, Mickey Donovan played by Jon Voight might be even more so. Mickey is a career criminal and although let out after twenty years in prison for murder he continues his low life ways, planning, scheming and thieving, doing just about anything so he doesnt have to work. And, his actions put him and his family, sons, daughter in law and grandchildren in danger, sometimes with their very lives.

Voight is Brilliant in the role from the way he moves, purses his lips and animates his speech with his dialogue. He is gregarious in a scary sort of way, emulating a past generation Irish thug in the Whitey Bolger vain. A perfect counter to Rays stoicism their relationship acts as a push pull quandary for an underlying tension that exists between the two that is only revealed in small pieces as you move through the four seasons, further complicating Rays already obfuscated life.

He hates his father stemming from something that happened back in Boston. We are only given bits and pieces of the reason, but it has something to do with Rays only sister committing suicide in a drug induce stupor jumping off a building.

An underlying motivation for Rays personality is his secretive nature and total unwillingness to reveal to those close to him his activities, especially his wife who takes a personal offense to it. But, the audience gets the feeling it is not subterfuge or deceit that drives this unwillingness reveal his work, but solely to protect his family from the degenerate condition of the world he travels in.

Each season Ray seems to fall deeper and more careless in his dealings getting himself into predicaments that only his cunning, raw courage, cool head and sense of purpose ride him to victory each time. Of course, this is the tv show talking. A real life Ray Donovan probably would have died long ago, in a shootout, knifed or had his car wired to explode, but since he is central to the story this obviously is a scenario the producers wouldnt like to happen, at least not at this time.

Ray has two extremely competent operatives. One, is Lena Barnum, the token gay on the show, an obvious nod to Hollywoods unwritten law that if you want to be supported by the industry make sure you include gay characters. On other productions this quiet edict is usually overbearing ridiculousness, but what politically correct nonsense isnt? The agenda hurts other productions, but not Ray Donovan.

I would credit the actress, Katherine Moennig, playing the part for the realism she portrays. She is lesbian in real life not some Hollywood do-gooder saying to the public, look at me, Im playing a gay person. Shes had multiple Lesbian roles before Ray Donovan, Shane McCutcheon on The L Word  Jake Pratt on The Young Americans, Jilly in Everybodys Fine to name a few.  She walks and talks like a man and the directors make the most of that showing her in long shots walking in and out of buildings and down halls. She is pretty enough not to be in that mannish lesbian role but clearly she is very comfortable in her own skin. That might be why she comes off so believable.

Lena is fearless and is indispensible to Ray in a number of areas especially for her internet excellence which appears to be a specialty. She is believable as a female bad ass where others try but just cant seem to pull it off.

Rays other operative is Avi Rudin, former IDF soldier and ex-Mossad agent and brings his prowess, courage and sense of duty to his job with Ray. He acts as the voice of reason with the operational and tactical, constantly trying to challenge Ray on decisions Avi thinks are not in their best interests. . Avis loyalty sometimes carries him too far dispensing Rays justice whether he calls for it or not. He protects Rays code even if Ray doesnt.

Avi is a tough, smart, extremely knowledgeable operative on that gray side of street life. He counters the other Jewish whiny, self-absorbed very rich lawyers who Ray does a lot of his work for. But, Avi, is not so simple either. His soft side is that he lives with his mother which gives him a more human quality, a real mamas boy like most Jewish sons. But, unlike most Jewish mamas boys he has no hesitance to commit murder if it falls within the parameters of Rays code.

Along with the very familiar locales that signify the Los Angeles universe both Avi and Lena are an addition on a human level. Where Rays Irish roots, dominate certain other geographical areas of the country he remains somewhat of an anomaly in the L.A. setting. Lena and Avi are a microcosm of the Jewish and gay influence that make up this city and counterbalance Rays existence in the L.A world.

What is pretty cool about the story lines is that at the end of each season you are given a completionno cliffhangers here. Unlike Game of Thrones and some other block busting cable shows, Ray Donovan is content and confident enough that you will return for the following season without leaving the audience wondering.

 Ray Donovan is TV at its best. The complexity of the story contains so many derivatives, angles and sidebars of the characters, situations and the timeframe, its impossible to cover them all in this review.  In a world where network television is constantly trying to shove Hollywoods left wing politically correct agenda down the English speaking worlds throat, Ray Donovan is an island of refuge on that politically charged sea.  It has been renewed for a fifth season which will go into production early in 2017.",1476230400,,8146,4.7003508771929825

He says so little - which is so interesting from this Shakespeare trained actor -but his facial and body language does the job perfectly. He's dangerous but so sensitive at the same time. Love and hate, sadness and pain is so perfectly displayed on his face. It looks like the wall that he so carefully built around him is about to collapse at any time.
I also love the writing; and the soundtruck is right on. I think it is the best show since Breaking Bad, beside Peaky Blinders! I just can't stop watching....",1472169600,,578,4.462264150943396

Anyone who owns one knows that it has mind of its own & especially likes to make spelling corrections where none is needed) since the days of Dueling Banjos.

5944749,4,B00EUI4XHE,"Ray Donvan is a fixer for the rich and would-be famous denizens of Hollywood. Always attired in a black suit with either a crisp white or black open collared shirt, a 36 hour beard growth and a tightly clenched jaw, Ray has a family he is close to. His brothers who hang out at a boxing club are dysfunctional and his father Mickey is a life-long criminal just released from prison. Ray's wife Abby and his teenaged children also have a few quirks, but the working class south Boston Irish American ethos is well-portrayed by all the principles. Liev Schreiber and Jon Voigt are both excellent as Ray and his complicated sociopathic Dad, Mick. This is a very unflattering view of the underbelly of LA, but despite the violent and sexual scenes, or perhaps because of them, Ray Donavan gets high marks.",1469318400,6,801,4.647887323943662

He's basically a hit man but considers himself a person who ""fixes situations"". He's married with two children and co-owns a boxing gym with his two brothers. The storylines focus around the fact that Ray and his brothers were abused by Catholic priests as young boys and how it affects their lives. Jon Voight is excellent as Ray's ex- con Dad who shows up after twenty years in prison. You'll want to binge watch each season because you'll be drawn in from the first episode.

Ray is a fixer. In theory. But everything he touches turns to crap.

But in my view, the best action movies feature characters you actually care about, and you only come to care about them through glimpses of their everyday lives. The plots are completely implausible as well, so forget the willing suspension of disbelief. RD is more after shock value.
