8516306,2,B007GF3ETQ,"This outdated little set is one of a series of film collections released under the AAFES Triple Bill label. Like the others, its selections are unrelated and its production utterly bare bones. There are no special features at all, and not even an option for scene selection (if you try to skip to another scene mid-movie, youll be taken back to the menu). While this is disappointing, the movies themselves don't provide much merit, either. What follows is a quick review of each.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wolverine/dp/B00005RRJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wolverine</a>&nbsp; The title feature sets an unspectacular tone for the collection, and for certain will never be mistaken for the more recent superhero picture of the same name. Contrary to DVD covers claims, this one is not based on a novel by Richard Forsyth, though he did pen its story  a standard action-thriller wherein an ex-Navy SEALs family is kidnapped by organized crime after he intercepts their new super-drug. Star Antonio Sabato, Jr. can in fact deliver innovative action  see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Voltage/dp/B0000A2ZR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Voltage</a>&nbsp; but the adrenaline scenes in here are rather lame. Richard Brooks (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crow-City-of-Angels/dp/B000059XUP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crow - City of Angels</a>) has an utterly thankless co-starring role as an FBI agent.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shadow-Warriors/dp/B0000ADXFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shadow Warriors</a>&nbsp; This film seems to be mislabeled, for its actually the sequel to the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shadow-Warriors/dp/B01M293F31/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shadow Warriors</a>. Its biggest asset is its action ensemble cast, featuring Hulk Hogan, Carl Weathers, Shannon Tweed, and Martin Kove  all of whom play mercenaries trying to stop a terrorist from unleashing a chemical weapon on North America. The movie is a little more intriguing than the previous one on the disc, featuring slightly more engaging action and characters. However, its still far from great and wastes too much time with an unrelated opening scenario before getting to its main story. To date, this is the last picture Hulk Hogan starred inunless you count the top billing he got in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Hercules/dp/B00308BB02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Hercules</a>.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Fight/dp/B004T7O524/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Fight</a>&nbsp; The only genuine martial arts film on the set and also the weirdest one youll find here. A passion project of director/writer/star Ernie Reyes Jr., this is a relentlessly weird story wherein a Filipino martial artist (Shishir Inocalla) moves in with a dysfunctional foster family and takes on a drug gang run by an Adolf Hitler-wannabe (Corin Nemec). This is a low budget mess, clearly on lower economic rung than the other films and struggling to express its ideas coherently. However, what was lost in storytelling is reclaimed in the action realm, for the film features some seriously good fight scenes.

I cant recommend this set. The films are collectively lacking, and the only reason I can think of buying the package is if you're interested in one of them and can purchase it cheaper in this version than as a single release.",1481500800,,3651,6.689873417721519
