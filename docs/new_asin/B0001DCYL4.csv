1989894,2,B0001DCYL4,"I hope there are better Sturgis Videos out there. I bought this

video and was disappointed,I wanted more scenes of the tourist sites and the rides. This video spends too much time with sloppy drunks. I don't like talking to sloppy drunks much less

watching them on video. The few rides shown were OK, but then

you go to another sloppy drunk for an interview. The T&A contest

at Buffalo Chip was OK. Save your money on this one.",1131667200,17,431,4.417721518987341
1989895,5,B0001DCYL4,This is an awesome documentary type film on Sturgis.  It has all kinds of motorcycles and girls.  If you have never been to Sturgis in August and you want to.  I recommend checking out this DVD.  It is a must have for any motorcycle rider!,1109721600,8,239,4.2444444444444445
8010369,3,B0001DCYL4,"It was ok but left out the keys to Bike Week like the rides, bikes and history. It's not all about get s faced or drooling of half dress woman. It could have shown brothers and sisters reuniting after a year long wait for Sturgis and the bond of those that go to Bike Week and so much more. It's GGW labeled for the motorcycle world. It's an ok  just don't expect to learn much about Sturgis or why people go there or any other bike week or rally year after year, as there is so much more than just the booze and woman.",1522108800,,519,3.9903846153846154

8010371,1,B0001DCYL4,Boring re-hash of everything you've see before,1422835200,,46,5.714285714285714
8010372,3,B0001DCYL4,"Sturgis Uncensored was ok, i have been there many times during Bike Week, the tape did not impress me that much, guess it would have been fine for some one who has never been to a bike rally..",1319500800,,192,4.078947368421052
8010373,4,B0001DCYL4,"Sturgis Uncensored does some homage to the various locations and events at the rally, but spends most of its time showing what not to do when you are there... LOL!  Overall, it is worth a watch, and will be a crowd pleaser at any adult party.  You will be amazed...or maybe you won't...at how crazy some folks get when you add a few shots and brewskies.  I think that if I were in the right place financially these days; I'd open a Biker friendly Topless Whiskey Bar, next to a motorcycle tire and repair shop, and have a burn-out pit in between; I'd have enough to retire in style before I knew it...or, then again, I might just loose whats left of my mind hanging with the customers. Hmmmm, either way it sounds like I need to rethink my life choices.",1315008000,,753,4.326241134751773
8010374,2,B0001DCYL4,"This was dissapointing! I was expecting a little more history about Sturgis and how it all came to be, also I would've liked to see alot more motorcycles, makes & models.......",1224460800,,176,4.709677419354839
8010375,1,B0001DCYL4,"this should have been called 'sturgis girls gone wild'.  There was hardly anything on the bikes.  The main focus of the movie was drunkin' retards and trashy women.  I understand that it's called sturgis uncensored, but damn, couldn't they have focused just a few more minutes on the bikes, and less on the retards?  My wife doesn't want to go to sturgis now, after seeing this flick",1213056000,,383,4.6716417910447765
8010376,1,B0001DCYL4,I was hoping for clips of the Harleys in attend... but this is an amateur Z grade movie..... After watching it for 5 minutes and I discarded it in the trash can.,1170720000,,161,4.0625
8010377,3,B0001DCYL4,"I understand the ""uncensored"" part of the DVD, but being a motorcycle enthusiast, I would have liked to see more motorcycle related event activities and less loud drunks.

I really did like the Devil's Tower piece of this DVD. That was the best part for me.",1168214400,5,257,4.586956521739131
8010378,5,B0001DCYL4,"Like the title says...Uncensored. It's not a ride in the country with butterflies & pretty flowers. It's bikes,boobs & beer! I live in Daytona & I'm glad to see it's not just here. The Dragon's Tail can't be far behind. Party On!",1136937600,4,229,4.476190476190476
