4209738,1,B003VOVVXC,"And I'm not talking about the gore. This movie could have been a fun or interesting film. But there are scenes with extremely offensive and racist stereotypes in this movie that might as well be considered the 21st century version of Black face. The movie is already cheesy and awkward enough as it is but the racism in this film really brought it down for me. The depiction of ""African Americans"" in this film is unbelievably disgusting. I'm surprised Funimation a company that usually doesn't back these kind of stereotypes would even decide to license and endorse a movie like this. The offensiveness of these scenes out weighed any entertainment value this movie had (or rather what little it had already). I can only assume when this movie was made the creators probably never thought it would be watched by someone of that Race. Well guess what... they were dead wrong.

The rest of the movie I sat there and stomached. It's your typical... Japanese Gore movie. Horrible Story,Cheesy Effects,Pretty Girls, POINTLESS SCENES, and mindless blood. Not my type of film to begin with but I was trying to give it the benefit of the doubt...and to my dismay what ever benefits this film had were lost.

4209741,1,B003VOVVXC,"I saw, or tried to see, ""Tokyo Gore Police"" by one of the directors responsible for this movie and it was bad to the point I wasn't able to make it through the entire movie. Now I have to ask myself why I bothered with this mess. Yes it has some positive user reviews but those are obviously written by people already predisposed toward this sort of thing. Well.....I did manage to make it through the entire movie and it's really terrible.

Vampire Girl infects a cute guy in her high school because she likes him. A rival girl (who likes the same guy) starts a fight with Vampire Girl and gets killed. Biology teacher dad resurrects his daughter with some of Vampire Girl's blood and voila, here comes Frankenstein Girl to get revenge.

This is strictly for those who enjoy watching Troma films. There is no real film technique here. Just a lot of shock images, garish colors and MTV style editing with an ouzi. In this day and age, seeing fountains of spraying blood after a limb or head has been amputated is no real big deal. When you see it a dozen times in one movie it just gets tedious. There is obviously an audience for this sort of thing because the directors have a fair number of titles under their belts. But some day their audience is going to grow up and realize how lousy this stuff is.

When I first saw ""The Toxic Avenger"", which I believe was the first Troma release, I thought it had a certain something going for it. That wore off real quick. After seeing a few more Troma flicks I realized this simply is garbage. Troma holds itself up as the last bastion of independent film making, but that's no virtue in its own right. Films need to be good. This is not good film making. If you're young, and doing copious amounts of drugs, you'll get a bit of a kick out of it. But you WILL come down and the sun WILL come up and the light will show this for what it is. Don't waste your time. I already did that.",1288310400,11,1926,4.285714285714286
4209742,4,B003VOVVXC,"My first experience with this ""genre"" was back in 2003 with the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stacy/dp/B000096IAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stacy</a>&nbsp;- a fun little zombie movie - followed by the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Riki-Oh-The-Story-of-Ricky/dp/B00004TJM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Riki-Oh - The Story of Ricky</a>&nbsp;but then these seemed to disappear.

For anyone who hasn't seen these or been introduced to the genre, they're usually very low-budget, over-the-top, ridiculous movies that you shouldn't think too deep about. They're usually around the 60-90 minute range and meant to just be fun! Over the top blood and guts, silly stories and often a lot of humor. The closest think I could compare them to would be the Crazy 88 fight scene from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill-Volume-One-Blu-ray/dp/B001BJ690Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill - Volume One [Blu-ray</a>].

The other reviews have gone into the story, so I'll focus on the Blu-Ray itself.

First off, the package is nice - it's a single-disc Blu-Ray disc with an embossed slipcover. The disc is marked as Region A (USA, Canada, Japan).

The movie itself is a lot of fun - these tend to sometimes drag on a bit (even at the 60-90 minute runtime) but this one held my interest from beginning to end with its multiple stories going on. It also had a lot of humor in it, making it fun to watch.. and the characters were enjoyable! A lot of the time these films will try to get an ""adult video"" actress as the main star and shoot it over the course of a day or two and it really shows (bad acting, little to no plot). This one, fortunately, didn't suffer form that.

Video quality on the blu-ray was good. It's a ""shot on video"" movie (opposed to film) so there isn't much grain. The problem here is that it suffers from over-saturation at times (people look orange in some scenes). The brightness levels are also a bit too high (anything black looks like a medium-gray). It also looks like they used a variety of different videocameras as sometimes the look will change from shot-to-shot (even looking like standard-definition at times). Nothing great, but definitely an improvement over standard-dvd.

Audio is available in 2 options: Japanese 2.0 or English 5.1. I'm not sure if Japanese 2.0 is all that was available from the source material, but a 5.1 track would've been very much appreciated. Again, nothing great here (little to no use from the surrounds, from what I heard), but nothing bad. For the audio/video, the important thing to keep in mind is that you're not watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight-BD-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B001GZ6QEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>] - you're watching ""Vampire Girl vs. Frankenstein Girl"" :)

I will say the English Dub is actually very good - rather than just getting ""english speakers"" to read lines, it sounds like Funimation used their Anime voice actors as the track is very enjoyable (much in the way the ""Riki-Oh"" dub is enjoyable). The cast is into the characters and does a very good job.

Extras are also very good - about 90 minutes in length including behind the scenes, trailers and more.

Some more thoughts after watching it..

The title is a bit odd as ""Frankenstein Girl"" isn't even introduced until the 60-minute mark (of the 78-minute + credits movie).

Effects are a bit inconsistent - you see some great blood-effects early on, followed by what appears to be ""painted-on"" blood, and then CGI blood.. the combination is a bit odd. I wish they'd have stuck with 1 effect (preferably the ""real"" effects). Same goes for the props.. as fake as they look, I greatly prefer them to the CGI props.

The CGI is used a number of times (for blood/gore as well as backgrounds) and is very low-budget. I understand it's a low-budget movie, but these things are usually better just leaving out completely if you can't do them right.

With all that said, I greatly enjoyed the film. It's entertaining, short, gory and overall.. fun.

Note: While this is an ""over the top"" gore film, the gore is generally very unrealistic. Gallons of blood spurting from people, fake-toy looking body parts and generally just ridiculousness. It's not ""scary"" or meant to be realistic like you'd find in a film like Saw. With a name like Vampire Girl vs. Frankenstein Girl, you need to just enjoy it without thinking too much about it :)",1287878400,4,5575,6.270588235294118
4209743,4,B003VOVVXC,"Based on a best-selling manga by Shungiku Uchida, this slice of dementia was fabricated for the hardcore audience of  'Tokyo Gore Police', 'Meatball Machine', 'Machine Girl' and 'Robogeisha', and ups the ante considerably when it comes to off-the-chain, over-the-top insanity, audacity and mind-melting hyper-violence.

A non-stop, balls-to-the-wall send-up of all the classic Universal horror flicks, we've got an adorable schoolgirl Vampire chick, a goth-girl gang whose leader becomes the Frankenstein girl after a fatal accident at the hands of the vamp chick, a hunchback dwarf who incinerates corpses left by the vamp, a school principal who's also the resident mad scientist / Dr. Frankenstein with a lab in the school basement, aided by an over-sexed faculty nurse who later becomes an undead killing machine at the hands of the good doctor. Have I got your attention yet?

And we're just scratching the surface of this psychotically-psychedelic celluloid centerpiece of all things absurd, offensive and voraciously violent. Imaginative beyond your wildest dreams, unapologetic in it's insensitive use of stereotypes (there's a group of girls who wear afros, facepaint, big lips, put plates in their lips and gangsta rap, ghetto dance and spew Ebonics about Michael Jackson, Barack Obama, Joyce Joyner and Michael Jordan - remember, these are Asian girls!), this flick has more WTF moments than anything I've ever seen, and that's saying a lot.

Then there's a parody of disturbingly real-life adolescent behavior in Japan, the wrist-cutting kids (who do this out of boredom, rebellion and status-seeking), and here we have a school sanctioned, annual wrist-cutting championship contest that the kids practice for after classes. Needless to say, the arterial blood-spray quotient has never been higher in one of these movies, and I thought that crown went to 'Machine Girl' when I saw it for the first time. Guess again. Noah's Ark couldn't withstand this sanguinary storm.

As the film progresses, the violence gets more vehement, the gore more grandiose, the larger-than-life lunacy now nearing apocalyptic proportions - there are no words that can adequately prepare your senses for this onslaught. It just keeps on building steam until the frenzied finale and a tip-of-the-hat parody of 'Let The Right One In' along with so much more. The only thing missing was nudity, but now I'm just being gluttonous...

For a low-budget film, the special effects work most of the time (even when not so special), and you can't analyze or over-think what's happening on-screen without ruining it for yourself - this is a roller-coaster ride, one of the largest you've ever been on. If you thought about this, you'd probably never get on one, and if you've never ridden one, you won't enjoy this flick. You need to turn your mind off for a spell and get sucked into the bizarre madness on display. It's not for everybody, hell, it's not meant for most folks. But if you've seen the movies referenced above, you're already in the choir and need to check this one out immediately. (By the way, it's much better than 'Robogeisha', which I found to be a let down...).",1282176000,38,3161,5.1640625
4209744,5,B003VOVVXC,"One word for this movie: holysonofajesustapdancingS#!+areyoufreakingkiddingme!? Alright. Let me slow down and collect myself for a moment.  How are you with completely insane asian cinema? Do the letters&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TGP/dp/B00393SG1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TGP</a>&nbsp;make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside? Have you ever enjoyed a film that was deliberately and unapologetically moronic and WRONG? Have you love for the neo-Japanese grindhouse, my friend? If so, welcome to it's masterpiece.  Yoshihiro Nishimura: you complete me. The man known as the Tom Savini of Japan has gotten progressively bolder and more accomplished with his trademark twisted over-the-top sensibilities and has grown in leaps and bounds as an effects artist in a very short time. Leading Japan's underground cinema into the new millennium, he has contributed effects to films such as Suicide Circle and Meatball Machine, and joined up with partner-in-crime Noboru Iguchi for Machine Girl (a personal fave) before becoming a nearly one-man show writing, directing, AND doing special effects for the monstrously bizarre Tokyo Gore Police.  After a quickie gig doing the effects for Samurai Princess, he reteamed with Iguchi-san to co-direct this slice of horror-comedy heaven. Now, if any of these films rings a bell, you know exactly how demented these two are. Ever wonder what their idea of romance is?

 Allow me to recount the events of the opening scene of Vampire Girl vs Frankenstein Girl, if you will. After a needless introduction to Japanese high school Valentines Day traditions a cute girl wearing a hood and her male companion are attacked on the road by three female undead atrocities. She bites the first in the neck and peels the skin off of it's head with her teeth as if it were an apple to reveal a bloody skull (eyes still in sockets, of course). She then head butts the girl, sending the skull flying into the face of the second enemy. The skull gnaws away at the face of it's comrade, sending gallons of the red, red kroovy splashing all over the lens and everything else within a half mile as our heroine spits out the very long strap of flesh she unwrapped from the first undead girl's skull. As the killer skull pulls the second undead's face off, the vampire girl bites her own wrists to utilize the Japanese vampiric ability of forming weapons from her blood (a'la the naime Nightwalker) She then beheads the second girl with her blood swords and the still-staring skulls land as a neat stack of two. Undead girl number three attacks and is relieved of both arms at once in a flurry of arterial spray. She is then slowly impaled through the crotch as J-pop singing begins to overpower the groovy surf music that has served as the soundtrack to this carnage thusfar. At this point, I literally raised my hand in a metal sign and nodded in approval with a mile-wide smile on my face even though I was in the room alone with nobody to note my visible pleasure at the ridiculousness of what i just saw. That's how much I enjoy this kind of garbage. The last would-be killer's skull is lifted out of it's skin from below and the film's title fades into view as our heroine lifts it and smiles from beneath her hood before tossing the final skull perfectly on top of the other two. Frankenstein: 0, Vampire: 3. My friend, we have not yet reached the 5 minute mark of this hyper-offensive gore-fest. Imagine what the other 80 minutes hold. I dare you..... Yeah, it's even crazier than that.

Often have I partaken in the wonderland that is the neo-Japanese grindhouse and seldom have I come away disappointed, but this film just takes the cake for me. It's like a perfect storm of violence, offensive stereotypes,and general insanity. Plus for the first time, the special effects actually look halfway good. TGP and Machine Girl were both brought down a notch by the fakeness of some of the effects (to be fair, with the things they were trying to do in TGP there was no way to not make it look bad). While James Cameron need not live in fear of movies like Vampire Girl vs Frankenstein Girl dominating the special effects scene, for a low-budget flick of this nature they do look mighty fine. But what really put me over the moon for this one was the sheer light-hearted zaniness of it. Sure they are all zany, but this one is practically a musical at times. A musical engineered by a band called Blood-Stained Fellow. I want this soundtrack. There's the aforementioned surf music and J-pop, along with metal, psychobilly, and even a showtune. That's right. Showtune. And it's used in possibly the greatest, bloodiest, and most excessive vampire kill scene ever to awesome effect. Not good awesome, mind you. Bad awesome. As in ""so bad it's awesome"".  Oh, and you know the flying guillotine? Yeah, imagine that was made out of spinal column and a rib cage. Voila!  Bad awesome!

Good god, I don't even know how to describe some of this stuff to you it's so overpoweringly off-the-wall. Well, at the high school where this tale of two girls who love the same boy takes place there are clubs. One such club is dedicated to the art of cutting yourself. These girls are so hardcore that at the school's Wristcutting Rally (whoever gets the most blood in the bucket wins) a chick SAWS THROUGH HER OWN ARM with a razor blade. And she still doesn't win! That's gonna leave a mark.  Another club is dedicated to Japanese girls who wish they were born black. There aren't words to describe to you how completely offensive these scenes are. There just aren't. You have to see it for yourself. Just.......damn, you won't believe it until you see it. There's also a sexy psycho-killer nurse, a hunchback janitor, a Chinese teacher with lungs filled with smog (a sharp jab at China's environmental trangressions) who is prone to going on tangents about certain popular J-horror films (allow me to point out that the director of those films plays the role, which makes it even funnier) in the middle of his lectures. And guess what? All of these things play vital roles in the story. They aren't there just to be retarded even though they fulfill that function nicely. What else do I like? How about an ending that's a raggedly-veiled homage to Sweden's sophisticated vampire film Let the Right One In? How's that for contrast?

 Pretty much every frame of this film is filled with bizarreness. As I said, there really aren't words. This is my favorite film I've seen in 2010 so far. Now, take that with a grain (or pillar) of salt because this film obviously is not for everyone, but if you can appreciate the audacity of a story whose goal is to cram as much off-the-wall nonsense, violence, and absurdist humor into 90 or so minutes then proceed with confidence and prepare to have your jaw dropped. If you cannot enjoy the simple pleasures of insanity for inanity's (not a typo) sake then consider this a pass. But those who enjoy this sort of trash should be better than pleased. Pretty ladies, gallons of blood, a sensibility that makes beyond absurd seem mundane, the most charming vamp you'll ever see, and a hottie with detachable limbs (she uses an electric screwdriver) and screws sticking out of her face; a match made in grindhouse heaven.  I adore it. Vampire Girl vs Frankenstein Girl: place your bets, folks and don't say I didn't warn you.",1281398400,10,7410,4.829787234042553

They weren't being racist, they weren't picking on Black people, they weren't actually doing anything that was offensive. But if you were offended, then that's a personal problem!!! This movie is purely goofy, silly, and crazy beyond so many levels. The characters throughout the series are funny, while the CG and animation is so bad that it's amazing.

Intentionally over-acted like an early Troma film, this movie is about Keiko (Frankenstein Girl; Eri Otoguo) and Monami (Vampire Girl; Yukie Kawamura), clearly the protagonist.  It's Valentine's Day in their high school and both of them like the same guy, Jyugon.  The first half of the movie is really just about Monami pursuing this guy and Keiko figuring out what's going on between the two of them.  Then, when she confronts the lovers, she accidently dies.  Luckily, this happens just as her father discovers how to make Franken-monsters.  And so, two-thirds into the movie, we finally get Frankenstein Girl and a 25-minute fight scene involving the majority of the movie's characters.  The finale closes with a happy ending, a goofy surprise ending, and a cutesy little twist.

When I see trailers for Tokyo Shockers from Sushi Typhoon or Magnet entertainment, I wonder ""just what nonsense is in this flick that I won't want to miss?""  Well...flesh is stripped away in lengthy strands, stretchy faces are peeled off, swords are gorily worked into bodily crevices that I dare not mention, amputations leave behind uber-fake stumpy prostheses which Gallagher-cannon fake blood, sometimes it simply ""rains"" blood a la Broadway as Monami dances and soaks in it to some happy-go-lucky music, an animated intelligent blood droplet, a blood cocoon, a two-footed one-handed one-eyed Franken-thing reminiscent of Jeffrey Comb's creation from Bride of the Re-Animator (1990), living ""screw"" worms, a ""smashed"" face, an arm used as a helicopter propeller screwed into someone's head, bone-shard katanas, projectile fingered eye-nipples, and a hail of blood bullets.

My next thought might be ""well what sort of weird hybridized bad guys are there and what weapons do they use?""  A sword-armed sumo wrestler with a holy helmet gun, buzz-saw ankle-wheels made out of crystallized blood, and after we think she's been defeated Frankenstein Girl returns as an odd, spider-like mechanized menace.

These movies tend to add some other flavor particles as well (e.g., strange commercials in Tokyo Gore Police).  The pale and awkward Wrist-cutters Club girls practice with box-cutters like cheerleaders preparing for the 13th Nationwide High School Student Wrist Cut Rally (which is really nasty).  There is an extremely racist depiction of a clique of black girls--one is actually a spear-toting tribesman, another a fro'd 80s hip-hop black panther mix--it's really inappropriate...and that makes it funny.  Lastly, like any Asian movie, even this slapstick sensation features some informative background, in which Eihi Shiina cameos as Monami's mother during a backstory flashback.
There is some goofy, almost farcically cartoony, CGI.  They even feel like they'd be in a macabre version of Pee-Wee's Playhouse, especially when we see Keiko's Dr. Frankensteiny father (dressed up like Sgt. Kabuki Man) and his assistant (the sexy school nurse) hacking up some poor guy.

It's so wonderful when two great minds can work together to produce something so beautiful.  Director Yoshihiro Nishimura also directed Tokyo Gore Police (2008), Mutant Girl Squad (2010), Helldriver (2010), and the upcoming The ABC's of Death (2012) and The Profane Exhibit (2012), in addition to doing the make up for dozens of Tokyo Shock flicks.  Co-director Naoyuki Tomomatsu directed Zombie Self Defense Force (2006), Maidroid (2008), Maidroid 2 (2010) and Rape Zombie: Lust of the Dead (2012), along with a lot of writing experience in the subgenre.  Eri Otoguo (Frankenstein Girl) and Scream Queen Yukie Kawamura (Vampire Girl) each have some exploitative slaughter movie experience as well.

DVD Special Features:  I have warned before about the lack of bonus content and/or re-release of these films.  The features are nothing special.  Just some footage of ""the making of"" the film.  It's entertaining seeing how cute Yukie Kawamura is in between scenes.  But we don't get any interesting insights about making the film.  These features could have easily fit on to one disc with the movie.  I wonder if they made it a 2-disc unit to fool people into thinking it would be something special.

4209786,3,B003VOVVXC,"I have to give the Japanese a lot of credit. They managed to make outrageous movies that are somewhat easy to follow. I guess because they put more work in the visuals than the actual script. The version that I watched did not have the subtitles turned on and I got most of what is going on in the movie.

The movie 's central plot is about a vampire and a normal girl trying to woo the same guy. The guy is with the Vampire's rival because of some political thing. After a while, the Vampire girl finds a way to kill the rival and does it in the most horrific way possible, but thanks to some magical quality in the rival's blood, she gets resurrected as a monster. Then they fight.

Beyond that, it was a fairly enjoyable sit and I was amused by it. There was enough character development and outrageous moments to keep me entertained. But this movie is not for me. I am not a Japanophile and I had to go look up some of the things in the movie so I could understand it.

4209787,5,B003VOVVXC,"Vampire vs Frankenstein girl, what can I say lol. I like this movie alot probably to much. I haven't been into these gore flicks long. In fact if it wasn't for the AVGN I would not have known about this kind of movie at all. He did a review for Robo Geisha. It was so over the top and weird I checked it out, along with this and others. But before I go on let me cover one sensitive subject about this movie. That would be the gonguro girls aka the girls in black face. I have to state this. I am a black person, I have to state that so people will not lable me a racist for not being offended by it. In fact I was, I almost didn't get this movie because of it. It rubbed me the wrong way and trust me that is very, very hard to do. The title of the movie just made want to buy it so I gave in. The more I saw them the sillier they looked. I am familiar with the whole over tanning thing that some of them do. It just looks cartoony and believe it or not it fits in the context of this movie with everything being over the top. They are on the opposite side with that wrist cutting click. I found the scenes with them funny, they just look stupid. Funimation tried to cover themselves with a line in the dubbed version with one of the girls stating that isn't this kinda racist with what where doing. That isn't the line in the subbed version. This isn't the first time they have done this. In an anime called Shuffle there where various groups of guys that where fans of the main characters in this anime. Well one groups acronym was kkk, which stood for the Knights of Kissy Kiede. Well over there thats cool that group does not exist. But, over here in the states thats a different story. So every time this group would announce themselves they would always state that  they where not the guys in the scary sheets. So I guess Funimation was doing a little damage control. I can't say these girls added a whole lot to the movie. But it did not bother me much when it was all said and done.

Now enough of that, on with what I thought of the movie. This by far is my favorite of this kind of flick. Its like watching a anime. With the whole high school love triangle story. Its alot of fun and lots and lots of blood. The scene where Vampire Girl kills this guy in a park and it rains a shower of blood is the best scene in the movie. This very silly yet catchy song is playing she's dancing underneath a shower of blood. It is ridiculous to say the least. Then you have the wrist cutting girls or as they say it ""wristo cuto"". Those scenes where the only ones that made me cringe a bit. I found them really funny. There a very demented group of young ladies lol. You just have to see them, they need help. You sit and watch this thing and all you say is WTF am I watching. I found this movie to be pretty light hearted. There are things that are disturbing,and it is not for everyone at all. Forget the black face stuff. There is enough in this to turn off alot of people for various reasons. When it was all said and done I really enjoyed this film. I have watched it so many times it doesn't make any sense. I even got the wall scroll for this. Yeah I like it that much. I highly recommend it if you are a fan of this kind of cinema, or if you like anime. If your not into that I don't know if I would suggest the average person look at this. You just have to go with the flow. Don't get bent out of shape by what is happening and enjoy what they are trying to sell. Peace..........",1328486400,7,3486,4.028860028860029

""Vampire Girl vs. Frankenstein Girl"" truly is a movie in search of an identity.  There is easily enough blood in this movie for at least a dozen movies, so it's kind of a horror movie, though it lacks scary moments.  On the other hand, it is kind of a live action anime-style cartoon, which is more of a spoof.  It really is a train wreck that moves along just fast enough to keep your attention: you're really not sure you want to continue watching it, but you want to see what happens next.  It starts off as a boy meets girl movie.  After that, it morphs into something more than bizarre.  There is no logic at all to this movie.  If you told me the screenplay writer was doing hallucinagenic drugs when he wrote the script for this movie, I wouldn't be surprised.

The only way this works for me is if the movie is 3D because you want the blood to jump out so it doesn't have to look realistic. In Saw 4 or 5 not sure, they have a dude getting crushed by 2 moving walls. As soon as he gets it cg blood squirts al over. In the making of they said they built a prostetic arm and crushed. Then why use cg. It doesn't enhance it. Just built fake body parts and use buckets of blood not from a computer.

It is NOT racist and no, I'm not white and my wife and I are 50+ in age. They just exaggerate some things trying to keep you off balanced and entertained and I say this also as someone educated in race relations with the paper on the wall to back it up. My African American friends would not be offended, when I get a chance to show them this, they'll be laughing and will say things like....that is SO bad!!! Oh no they didn't just do THAT! LOL!

Imo, these type of movies are meant strictly to entertain with visual shock and trying to give you something you haven't quite seen before, something different and unusual so you wonder, Ok...what's next?!?!.

This movie accomplished it. The special effects were better than other Tokyo Shock types we've watched. The title is so hokey you're forewarned...but....
yes BUT
This wasn't bad. It was actually pretty good considering others we've seen like Machine Girl etc. My wife and I roared at some of the action scenes. It was worth buying and having and would be fun to watch again in mixed company with friends.

It was exactly what I expected for the genre and a bit more. It was definitely entertaining and my wife didn't complain and we enjoyed it for what it was.
You don't watch a movie like this for its plot, but you can actually appreciate the artistic quality the director is trying to achieve, especially with tossing things out at you that are unpredictable which adds entertainment value. Then you get the added benefit of the movie setting it's own rules as opposed to following the same old Frankenstein & Vampire themes and rules. I'll tell you no more so I don't spoil it.

Plus sometimes I have to wonder at the minds that think up some of this stuff trying to surprise us.  I don't know about you, but we get this stuff because we want to be entertained with something we haven't quite seen before.
If you're laughing and keeping up with the movie...you ARE entertained.

Also, I thought the dubbing was very well done. We like dubbed movies so we aren't distracted from the movie reading the dang subtitles. When the dubbing is well done, it adds to the quality of the movie.

The special effects were pretty darn good as well.

So if you like other Tokyo Shock type stuff, get this, you'll have fun!

So now he's and a wheelchair, time to fastforward a bigfoot attack the black hair girl first in the bathroom then attack the asian girl but she survive, then attacked the blond,but she survive only because the bigfoot went back to killed the asian girl.

4209802,3,B003VOVVXC,"Yoshihiro Nishimura brings to life another absurd gore spectacle in VAMPIRE GIRL VS FRANKENSTEIN GIRL with more of the same mindless murder and mayhem that has made him a cult sensation in Japan. Nishimura had previously served as the special effects supervisor on MACHINE GIRL and MEATBALL MACHINE before directing his own insane splatterfest TOKYO GORE POLICE, and here he applies the same comic book action and over-the-top violence from before. The new girl on campus seduces Mizushima into a steamy romance, but his bitter ex-girlfriend refuses to give him up. What neither of them know is that Monami is a bloodthirsty vampire, and she has infected Mizushima with her curse. Keiko relies on the help of her father, a brilliant but utterly psychotic scientist, who transforms her into the fearsome Frankenstein Girl using a drop of Monami's blood. The two must battle it out atop Tokyo Tower, with Mizushima's love hanging in the balance! This intentionally offensive Horror Comedy is steeped in foul humor and ridiculous gags, earning itself a couple of cheap laughs long the way in an otherwise idiotic plot. The titular battle of the beasts is an unsurprising let down as compared to Nishimura's earlier films, but the geysers of blood and monstrous exploding head sequences that lead up to it will not disappoint. Thankfully, Yuki Kawamura and Eri Otoguro are both cute and campy as the two teen leads in a pair of entertaining performances. As the title implies, VAMPIRE GIRL VS FRANKENSTEIN GIRL can't be watched with even a shred of seriousness, and can only be appreciated for the tasteless bloodbath that it truly is.

It was a good movie from my point i will defiantly be watching it again.",1291939200,,469,3.9680851063829787
8406954,5,B003VOVVXC,"fun movie. I used a sony 3d bluray player to turn the movie into side by side 3d that added a POP to the action scenes. some people might be slightly offended by a certain group in the movie, but im not one of those people. I love wrist cutters! if you are black and sensitive to blackface, don't  watch this movie. you were warned! I personally laughed my butt off.  this movie is Japanese, made in japan, not the states. they even cracked on the Chinese. so don't blast amazon for selling it!!! lots of cheesy gore and not one naked person in the whole movie. that was a refreshing touch! a lot of fake blood!!!",1528502400,,613,4.230769230769231
8406955,4,B003VOVVXC,Bloody. Offensive. Politically incorrect to the extreme. This film left me with brain damage. In a good way.,1525824000,,108,5.055555555555555

8406957,5,B003VOVVXC,A awesome movie if you like gore flicks. A sort of re-telling of two classic monster movies. I would highly recommend this product.,1485129600,,131,4.739130434782608
8406958,3,B003VOVVXC,I was pleasantly surprised that it has the original language and the English dub  the only thing I can see is wrong so far ( watching it now) is there are a few glitches.but nothing major.,1472428800,,188,4.222222222222222

8406960,4,B003VOVVXC,"I watched a few minutes of this movie w/o subtitles in the original language to be sure it was worth the buy, and it does not disappoint. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and think it's worth the buy if you're a fan of Tokyo Gore Police or any of the other movies by (one of) the directors (s), it's directed by two people. There are many ""colorful"" characters within the movie other than the two main ones.  Which is a good thing because Vampire girl is less interesting than I expected, Frankenstein girl's character outshines her on many levels.",1466380800,3,546,4.515151515151516
8406961,5,B003VOVVXC,Really weird and funny movie.  The Frankenstein character in particular with the strongest possible human parts to assemble chose Obama supporters for super strong legs.  That's all I can offer without spoiling the movie.  Very funny.,1466121600,2,234,5.444444444444445
