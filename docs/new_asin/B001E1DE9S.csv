8296105,3,B001E1DE9S,"While this is a great set of interviews with Strat players (and I loved them, especially the one with Mark Knopfler and Rory Gallagher) it is by no means a very complete or full history of the Stratocaster. Indeed there is rare footage and interviews, but the filmmakers fail to give this docummentary the right angle and seamless motion you would want on a restrospective of the most famous guitar in the world (Yes Gibson, take that.)

Instead, after a nice start, the show deviates from its intentions and ends up being just a series of interviews and old clips edited together, with famous players discussing about their instruments and some other topics.

Nice, you get the story of Rory Gallagher's Strat, how Hank Marvin supposedly got the first Start in the UK just to lend it and never get it back. You hear for the 10th time (If you are a fan, like me) about Mark Knopfler watching the window of a music store, in love with the red Strat (who wouldn't be?)

But although that may be the story of some Strats, that is not THE story of the Stratocaster. Either the title is misleaing or the filmakers ran out of money halfway through their project and decided to recicle old interviews, especially on disk 2.

Much better is the account of ""Curves, Contours and Body Horns"" (Not available, but downloadable) and the more recent BBC's ""Imagine: History of the Guitar.""

In short, it is enjoyable if you just can't have enough of the Strat, like me. Pass if you want it for it's documentary production values.",1262131200,3,1515,4.617100371747212
8296106,5,B001E1DE9S,"This 2-disc set is not your fancy Ken Burns type of documentary, but it's a little slice of heaven for electric guitar fans.  It features interviews with Jeff Beck, Robert Cray, Ry Cooder, Mark Knopfler and many lesser-known players, plus smartly-done tours of several Fender factories and customizing shops.

Production values are a bit skimpy, but any electric guitarist will learn a lot from it.  And if you already love a Stratocaster, it's a must-have.",1240358400,4,457,5.066666666666666
