2356593,5,630336571X,"One of favorite movies from the 90's and very sad that I cant find it anywhere on DVD :-( Its 2013, how is this possible? Lol. Kelly Preston did a good job of making me hate her character, shes a good actress. Just watched this on Netflix but am praying to find it on DVD because I MUST PHYSICALLY OWN THIS MOVIE!",1375574400,7,313,4.064516129032258
2356594,1,630336571X,"Helen Hunt was good, but what could her character have liked about Andrew McCarthy's character? At best he was annoying.  And where was the comedy?  Mocking someone for nearly drowning---how is that funny?

The Amanda character was rather creepy.

The best part was Helen Hunt singing Buffalo Gals like Donna Reed in It's a Wonderful Life.  In fact the best parts of the movie were the scenes from It's a Wonderful Life.

Not a movie I would recommend.",1348876800,,452,4.730769230769231
2356595,4,630336571X,"but not Andrew McCarthy's best work.  Still, I enjoy Andrew in just about anything.  If you want a relaxing movie where you don't have to think too much to figure out the plot, this is for you.",1173571200,2,193,4.1891891891891895
