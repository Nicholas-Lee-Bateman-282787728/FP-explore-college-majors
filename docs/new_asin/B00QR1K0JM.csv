8692431,1,B00QR1K0JM,"I knew before I even put this disc in my player that I was in for something awful. The DVD sleeve proclaims that it won a couple awards at some film festivals I never heard of and one internet site says that star ""Michael Thurber...a modern day Vincent Price"" (It's the ""..."" part that worries me. The site could have very well said that ""Michael Thurber is not a modern day Vincent Price"", or ""Michael Thurber works in a wax museum trying to act like a modern day Vincent Price"", either which would be right on the money.). This poorly acted (and I'm being kind here, this horror flick doesn't miss one clich in the Horror 101 Handbook) opens up with a guy named Ryan about to tag the inside walls of the Cushing Wax Museum in Salem, Massachusetts with a paint spray can, when something grabs him by his ankles and pulls him off-camera. We then switch to Detention in a high school where angry teacher Mr. Jefferson (Ryan Hanley, who is simply terrible) begins to go off on all the sterotypical pains-in-the butt students who are in detention: The nerd Katherine (Jamie Lyn Bagley), who is here for passing out missing person flyers of her friend Ryan; slut Ashley (Shannon Hartman) and her boyfriend Colton (Patrick Keeffe); goth chick Zoey (Aurora Grabill) and gay lovers Sam (Johnny Sederquist) and Troy (Aaron Peaslee), who set gay rights back at least 100 years (Colton actually calls Sam a ""c***goblin"" in one of the film's many cringeworthy dialogue scenes). Mr. Jefferson decides rather than spending the detention time in a room, they will all make a trip to Cushing's Wax Museum, where head curator, the eyepatch-wearing Charles Frank (Thurber), begins to explain what movies all the wax figure were from (some are good [such as the two of Christopher Lee] and some are outright terrible; the good ones came from a real local wax museum nearby). Ashley tells Colton this would be the perfect place to make love at night and they should come back tonight to do it, but the stupid idiot says it so loud that everyone (everyone!) hears her say it. That night, Ashley and Colton break into the wax museum, make love in a coffin and are scared half to death by Vermin (Jesse Dufault), a punk rock band member who is a friend of Zoey's. Yes, you guessed it, all the students are there and explore the wax museum, including a secret passage they discover. Charles Frank is actually the Great Great Grandson of Victor Frankenstein and he is using the dead body of Ryan and some new appendages and organs from the teenage cast to make a new Frankenstein monster, while a head in a pan (a really bad effect that is used again for the ""funny"" finale"") named Fritz (Sean Carufel) makes jokes even a vaudeville performer would be ashamed to repeat. While the cast gets offed one-by-one in gory fashion (gory as in a high school play type of way; there are lots of exposed intestines and hearts, but the way it is done is strictly amateurish; even an eye popping out of a skull is nothing but an obvious cheap CGI effect), have intercourse (both straight and gay, but no nudity whatsoever; one of the gay guys actually wears suspender jeans!), run around meeting Charles' failures (more bad make-up jobs), even a zombified Adolph Hitler (Charles worked with the Nazis) and a strange woman behind a tiny door. Charles revives Ryan with a jolt of electricity and his new monster immediately turns against his master, putting Charles' body on a table and jolting him to death with electricity. Katherine and the monster Ryan walk out of the wax museum hand-in-hand and forget that there was just a mass slaughter in the building they just left. Isn't love grand?  The majority of the blame for this piece of crap disguised as a film (besides the lousy actors) lies directly on the shoulders of director/producer/co-writer (with Seth Chitwood) Richard Griffin (THE DISCO EXORCIST - 2011; MURDER UNIVERSITY - 2012; FUTURE JUSTICE - 2014; and too many others that I refuse to mention), who offers the audience nothing but 76 minutes of boredom (not the 85 minutes listed on the DVD sleeve, thank God!) with underwritten characters so unreal, they seem to jump out of a bad comic book (Why is Katherine so determined to find Ryan? It is never discussed in the film, except for a confusing nightmare she is having while Ryan is being dragged away in the beginning of the film.). Originally titled DR. FRANKENSTEIN'S WAX MUSEUM OF THE HUNGRY DEAD, but shortened to the title it is now, we finally do realize the Michael Thurber is no Vincent Price. Hell, he couldn't even hold Mr. Price's water. He overacts to the point of distraction. I guess he is supposed to come off funny, but he is more annoying than anything else. Do yourself a favor and don't get sucked-in by the DVD artwork like I did (That creature never appears in the film) and spend your hard-earned bucks on something more important, like laser hair removal for that mole on your posterior. This is nothing but a giant piece of doggy doo shaped like a DVD. To show how really bad the film is, late director Jess Franco is thanked in the final credits. That is not a ringing endorsement to me. Also starring Nathaniel Sylva, Mary Paolino (who speaks with a thick Bronx accent), Andre Boudreau and Christopher L. Ferreira as the Creature.

8692432,5,B00QR1K0JM,"First off I want to give full disclosure. I did work on and actually had 2 small cameos in this film (if you blink you'll miss them). That being said this film was a fun filled ride from start to finish. I saw this under it's original (and long ) title Frankenstein's Wax Museum of the Hungry Dead. The film revolves around Katherine and a group of misfits who go to a wax museum after hours (Katherine wants to find her friend Ryan and the others want to party) owned and operated by the very strange Charles Frank. To their collective horror they realize that Charles Frank is actually Charles Frankenstein and they are now prey to his bizarre creatures that inhabit the museum. The film stars Jamie Lynn Bagley as Katherine, Jesse Dufualt as Vermin, Johnny Sederquest as Sam, Aaron Peaslee as Troy, Shannon Hartman as Ashley, Patrick Keefe as Colton, Aurora Grabill as Zoey, Ryan Hanley as Mr. Jefferson, Beatriz Lopez as Kendra, Chris Ferreira as Ryan/Perfect Creature, Nat Silva, as Lead Creature, Sean Carufel as Fritz, and the venerable Michael Thurber as Charles Frankenstein. The film is funny and gory at the same time. Written by Seth Chitwood and directed by Richard Griffin, the film has that really bizarre quality to it that screams 70's grindhouse and euro-horror. To add to the Euro quality he had all of the actors dub their lines. While the film has phenomenal acting in it, this is Michael Thurber's film. His portrayal of Frankenstein is both hilarious and repulsive at the same time. He can be both be threatening and extremely funny in the same scene (slight spoiler personal favorite scene was when Frankenstein is lamenting that Hitler kicked him out of Nazi Germany because his methods were to inhumane for Hitler) Funny fact when I saw the first pictures from the set I didn't recognize Mr. Thurber in his eye patch and hair piece. Sean Carufel was a treat as ""Fritzy"" I won't spoil why but he has been a favorite of almost everyone I know who saw the film. Well worth checking out for fans of 70's style euro horror or anyone looking for something fun to watch.",1432339200,,2089,4.663956639566396
