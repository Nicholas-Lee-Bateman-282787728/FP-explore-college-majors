2768342,5,B000NDOZMI,"Stars Look Down is a very good British picture dealing with the daily trials and tribulations of miners in a ""colliery"" in Wales. Excellent acting and a very sad story line. Highly recommended!",1241654400,,193,4.878787878787879
2768343,1,B000NDOZMI,"Printed below the credits on the rear cover of this DVD is ""USA 1957"" - this for a film made in England in 1939, and a clue that what's contained therein is not Carol Reed's original cut.  Most conspicuously, the final scene, a poignant one featuring Nancy Price and Michael Redgrave, is gone, replaced by a shot of storm clouds with some highfalutin narration from Lionel Barrymore.  Also, his portentous narration has been tacked onto the montage of miners gathering for a possible strike, all of this totally foreign to Reed's style.

I love this film and was anxious to see it again, but watching this DVD left me feeling disappointed and angry.  My hope is that Criterion might release this along with other early Reed in an Eclipse edition.",1191024000,28,746,4.7153846153846155
8177470,5,B000NDOZMI,"I found a good quality transfer of The Stars Look Down, but I don't see it here on Amazon. It is produced by Nostalgia Family and the cover art has bright red lettering, angled a bit on a white background, with a color sketch of the two stars in the bottom right corner. At the bottom left in small print is ""Distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The audio and video are great; the contrast may be a little high, but it makes for a sharper image.",1518048000,,444,4.2976190476190474
8177471,4,B000NDOZMI,Very good British coal mining story.  Clear who the bad guys are!,1463184000,,65,4.416666666666667
8177472,5,B000NDOZMI,"Of all the films I've seen this year, both new and old, this ranked close to the top.  You'll hear a bit of hissing and notice a little loss of visual quality, but with the subtitles turned on, it was fine for me.  You'll easily identify with the characters, and the special effects in the mine are impressive--very dramatic and realistic.  The plot is exciting, the acting and direction are expert, and Redgrave is simply magnetic.  The story feels fresh, and the interesting twist at the end between Redgrave and his curmudgeonly mother hits this story clean out of the field.  I couldn't stop watching it.",1446076800,5,608,4.69811320754717
8177473,4,B000NDOZMI,Excellent British movie.  Well done.  Still relevant today.,1424822400,2,59,6.25
8177474,3,B000NDOZMI,This is an heartfelt wonderful film which deserves a Criterion or Kino remastering.... I don't know how much remastering this company did but whatever it was is appreciated but is not nearly enough for this really fine movie.  The picture and sound are just passable.  Still good enough for me to enjoy this movie.,1423699200,6,314,4.796296296296297
8177475,3,B000NDOZMI,"Passable film chronicling the plight of coal miners. Not quite on the level of Germinal, but interesting.",1414886400,,105,5.235294117647059
8177476,3,B000NDOZMI,"quite good, but very old. If you can relate to anything to do with working down the mines then I think  you will enjoy it!",1409961600,2,122,3.88
8177477,5,B000NDOZMI,"At first I thought this would be one of those dreary coal mining stories.  Thankfully, I was proved wrong.  Margaret Lockwood delivers a great performance in a somewhat lesser but very important role.  I have the Mill Creek version which is of rather poor quality. I`m looking forward to the import which I`m sure will have better picture and sound quality.  Well worth a second viewing.",1378512000,2,387,4.818181818181818
8177478,5,B000NDOZMI,Hard to find Glad amazon had it. lost some quality but what can you expect it is a very old movie.,1257033600,3,98,3.7142857142857144
8177479,2,B000NDOZMI,"The actual film is very good, but the transfer on this DVD is rather horrible. The original source appears to have been a somewhat worn 16mm print with scratches and dirt that apparent then was copied onto VHS tape. Was this taped off the air? Visual artifacts are everywhere and there is poor resolution and muffled sound. The actual DVD is a DVD-R and there are no menus or chapter stops of any kind. No copyright notice either, although I do not think this film is in the public domain. The product description is what is printed on the back cover, with the incomplete sentence the same. It simply stops abruptly. Synergy Entertainment seems to be located in someone's bedroom, with this DVD-R produced in small numbers. This is the full 110 minute original release, it has that in its favor as the PAL copy available in the UK is the American cut version.",1241654400,20,859,4.584415584415584
