8720210,5,B00ZGM7FMI,"I never knew about Johnny Cash's background but since being to Memphis Sun studios it was interesting how Johnny interacted with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison & Sam Phillips. Being to Johnny & June Carter Cash home in Hendersonville, TN this movie helped to fill in the gaps about his life. He will always be a American country & western star that will not always be equaled.",1485734400,,381,4.617647058823529
