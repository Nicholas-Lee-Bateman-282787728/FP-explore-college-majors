I have allways been a fan of Corey Haim ,but as I get older I adimt some of his Movies are pretty bad and I only watched them because of him. But here, in one of his last performences he really Works his ass off and the script is pretty good too,with twists and turns all the way to the end. I recomend this for all of his fans,it`s a great way to remember him!!",1381363200,8,400,3.8902439024390243

8592628,2,B00DENJIEY,was not one of Corey Haim's best movies,1439337600,,39,4.0
8592629,1,B00DENJIEY,"Awful, confusing mess of a movie.  The script was all over the place.  And I kind of figured out the ending shortly into it.  Haim wasn't bad, but the direction and script were just awful.  I wouldn't want to watch it again.  And I don't want to remember this as Haim's last movie.  It's such a shame he didn't get to finish The Dead Sea.",1409356800,,338,4.123076923076923
8592630,1,B00DENJIEY,"After 10 minutes I found myself fast forwarding until the ending to see which one of the predictable outcomes it was going to be. Not believable storyline of a supposedly wealthy kidnapped wife with the usual suspects: her husband, family and business associates. The usual plot hooks of cryptic clues and disguised phone calls that were just comical.
Acting was really bad; bad like stare at person, say your line then wait for the single line response and so on. I've seen more realistic acting in a high school drama class.
Characters super stereotyped as alcoholic detective, frantic husband, dumb cops. Extras in the movie were camera shy frozen.
Cinematography and editing were bizarre such as repeated close up shots of a pickup's moving wheels.
Props: Odd overuse of layers of hanging plastic tarp in house to make it look scary. Cheap and pointless unless it's your local Halloween haunted house.
Audio levels and enunciation were poor and with no subtitles it was hard to follow the dialogue. Annoying and pointless sound effects to disguise boring and lifeless action.

A quickly forgettable film. The DVD cover was oversell for this understandably three year late release.",1383264000,,1184,5.0717948717948715
