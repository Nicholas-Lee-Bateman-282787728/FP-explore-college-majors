8212835,5,B000UBWX72,"I wanted to take my swing dance to the next level after watching movies like Swing Kids, but didn't know where to start. This gave me a leap start into the world of aerial dance moves.  Though definitely not for beginners, Daniel and Tiffiny break each move down, address safety concerns and make the execution easy.  This series teaches to many moves, and the instruction is so in depth, I can't believe it doesn't cost more than it does.  I go back from time to time to brush up on moves, or how to make them cleaner and present better. Highly suggest all the videos in this series.",1333411200,,584,4.388888888888889
8212836,5,B000UBWX72,Almost as much fun to watch as they are to try.  I can spend hours watching these moves over and over.  They always facinate me.,1326931200,,128,4.08
8212837,5,B000UBWX72,"I've got four of the ML DVDs taught by Daniel Newsome. He's the master! Seriously, what can't this guy teach?

You should, of course, know some basics before trying these tricks, but I'm not much of an aerialist and I didn't have any problems getting exactly what they were talking about and using it on the dance floor. These tricks are so much fun!!

We've been hitting some clubs and throwing down these moves and others from the other tapes in the series and it's been a blast. Everyone always cheers for us. :)

Make sure you get this one first before moving onto the other tapes. Or just buy the series and save a few bucks. It'll be worth it.",1307577600,,649,4.347107438016529
8212838,5,B000UBWX72,I'm a big fan of Dan Newsome's instructional dvds. He is really good at breaking down the aerials. I would only recommend this dvd to those who have at least danced swing for a few months and who also know side-by-side charleston. If your looking for an aerial dvd you can't do any better i highly recommend this product.,1303344000,,321,4.4576271186440675
8212839,5,B000UBWX72,"This is exactly what I was looking for. I already know swing steps so I only wanted Aerials. The instructors are very good at demonstrating and give plenty of insight and show the moves at several different angles.

If you already have a little experience, this will save lots of money.",1271289600,,286,4.607843137254902
8212840,5,B000UBWX72,"This is a great set of DVDs for anyone interested in learning swing aerials. Many different moves covered at varying degrees of difficulty. All are taught using elaborate step by step instruction, as well as accompanying exercises covering concepts that will help you build the control necessary to execute advanced moves safely. If you think you're ready to take your dancing airborne and want to do so without ripping your partners' limbs off, this is for you. Also cool just to keep around as a reference. I have a fairly large collection of swing and lindy clips, and DVDs. This set is a standout in terms of instruction and overall production quality.",1251417600,,656,4.866071428571429
8212841,5,B000UBWX72,This is an excellent DVD on aerials and flips.  It is very high quality and shot in 16X9 format.  The menus are well organized and it is easy to find any of the particular flips or aerials either via the menu or just by skipping tracks.  There is also a really cool video of people dancing and doing tons of aerials.  I've watched a lot of dancing DVDs and this is by far the best in both quality and content.,1195948800,6,409,4.075
