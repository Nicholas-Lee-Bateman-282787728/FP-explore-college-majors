But since extensive use of computers to monitor collisions which cannot be observed directly, I sometimes wonder if the software isn't written with a bias to find what is expected.  Presumably, peer review ensures that self-fulfilling delusions don't occur.  The more science learns about the universe, the less it appears to make sense; e.g., dark matter and dark energy.  What's next, dark Vader?",1489708800,,426,5.313432835820896

8697059,5,B00S2SYULM,"This episode of Nova deals with the discovery of the Higgs particle (boson) which was accomplished in 2012.  The title refers to the fact that the conditions necessary to make them appear mimic conditions very early in the universe, just a tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang had begun.

The venue was the supercollider at CERN, which had to be upgraded, rebuilt, in order to reach the energies necessary to create a Higgs.  After much trial and tribulation, including a helium leak that damaged a lot of the equipment, they managed to begin the process.

It was not an easy thing to do, nor did it happen all at once.  For the Higgs decays so quickly -- something like a billionth of a trillionth of a second -- that it can't be seen at all, not detected directly -- it won't even leave skid marks.  No, they had to calculate what particles it would decay into and for that they had to know more about it, specifically what it's mass is.  It took a number of experiments to narrow that down to about 125 Gev and then they calculated it should decay into a pair of photons.  And that is what they found.

The story almost ends there, but not quite.  For, as seems to so often be the case, the findings led to more possibilities, more searches, one of them being a search for super-symmetry.  And that is where this episode ends.

This episode explains the how's and why's of particle physics for amateurs like me, in terms that are easily understandable.  Why is the Higgs important?  Because it caused some particles to take on mass to allow them to build atoms and molecules and all the things we see around us, from stars and mud puddles to tigers, little green apples and us too.

Nova interviews many experts, who take us through all these steps so that we might share their excitement and their journey to discovery just a little better.",1433548800,7,1852,4.470238095238095

Watching all those scientist and wow there are so many of them from so many countries, from male to female, regardless of the color of their skin, race, nationality or origin, is a proof that humans can do well on planet earth only if they use their knowledge instead of their greed, working together in achieving solutions even for the most complex issues like the universe at thirteen billion year old rather than spending their time, resources and finances in destroying each other and bringing death, harm and misery to each other as well as to other species on planet earth and the environment. With so many individuals with so much talent for this one single project, I never understood why the Nobel Prize few years ago went to a politician, the President of US of A instead of a scientist or inventor who has sacrificed his/her life in finding a solution important for human advancement. There is so much science in this documentary that it would require a scientist to understand few segments of this documentary but regardless, a well presented documentary and once again, an accomplishment for human race. Bravo.",1424563200,9,1251,4.877934272300469
