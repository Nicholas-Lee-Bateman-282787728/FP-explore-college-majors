1557758,5,B00005JONL,"""Hellbent"" is a fantastic horror film, done with great care, featuring good performances and cute guys, decent scares, a good balance of humor, a great musical score, and is filmed during the actual West Hollywood Halloween festival. Rather than trying to create a back-story for the killer, which I feel too many horror films try to do which sometimes results in an unbelievable explanation, the story lets you simply wonder, and that makes it scary. Not knowing what the deal is with this masked, buff psycho and instead focusing on likeable main characters being relentlessly stalked gives this film a more basic effect that actually works really well. The story revolves around four gay friends, and each character is decently written, and fun. Dylan Fergus is very cute indeed, and is a very capable actor. He plays the lead character with an easy going, boy next door goodness. Hank Harris, as Joey, is supposed to be the ""average"" looking guy, but his natural ease, goofy and naive character makes him very appealing and cute, actually. I have seen Harris in other films as well, and he is a pretty good young actor. I really liked how the writers show these young gay characters as real people, not stereo-types, fleshing out each of the four characters with their own distinct personalities. The gore is just right, and is just about what one expects from this genre of film. ""Hellbent"" isn't overly complicated, has likeable actors, a great location for the action sequences, and directed decently. When I saw this in the theaters, it was sold-out, and the audience was lively and it was obvious everybody had a great time. It will definatly gain a cult following on dvd and hopefully a sequel is in the near future. Kudos to everybody involved for making a great gay orientated horror film, easily worthy of repeat viewings. I really like this movie.",1158019200,8,1861,4.855345911949685
1557759,4,B00005JONL,"Hellbent is certainly not the best horror/slasher flick ever made, but it is entertaining none-the-less.  In fact, I actually wrote about the film after it hit theaters for a graduate class at USC's School of Cinema-Television.  There is an underlying commentary contained within the film regarding gender roles and expectations.  I throughly enjoyed both of my viewings in the theater and I am very happy that I will be receiving it on DVD in a few weeks.  Expect several shocks and one major gross-out/laugh-til-your-side hurts laugh near the end of the flick.  Enjoy!",1156291200,5,570,5.086021505376344
1557760,5,B00005JONL,"I really enjoyed this movie for what it was: a Horror Movie.  The fact that the main chracters are gay is secondary.  What I liked most about this film is it takes a few minutes to set up the characters then it just takes off and doesn't stop until the end.  I love that we see the movie through the victims' point of view; they don't know who this guy is, so why should we? It just makes it that much scarier.  The gore is top notch and overall this movie is an entertaining horror vehicle.",1154563200,16,491,4.083333333333333
1557761,4,B00005JONL,"I was positively surprised to see this movie, it is well made, exciting and with charming characters, and can be easily compared to ""Scream"" or ""I know what you did last summer"" in quality and drive.
This is however pure slash, and no psychology. They should have added 10 minutes to the movie, to give the viewer a killer profile. The movie ended with me wondering who the killer is under his mask and what his motives are to kill the gay guys (and only the masculine ones).
However, apart from the entertaining factor, this movie gives the gay community reason to rejoice. It shows that the gay now feel so confident in themselves as gay, that they can watch a movie about gay men getting slashed without letting it hit their self esteem or make them feel discriminated. Wonderful!",1153180800,13,783,4.6
1557762,4,B00005JONL,"When reviewing a film like HELLBENT, it's important to rate it within the realm of its genre. The Godfather this film isn't, but as a horror movie it's top-notch, except for some minor issues I had.

I disagree with earlier posters who see this as an AIDS allegory and question, ""Haven't we gotten beyond that by now?"" I couldn't disagree more. This film, to me, shows how ""mainstream"" gay culture has become. It follows the formula familiar to anyone who's seen Friday the 13th and any of the sequels or imitators that followed: have sex, get killed; remain chaste, survive (more or less). I view it as a weird compliment that gays can now be killed in a slasher film, as main characters in a ""pointless"" film designed to scare the bejeezus out of you (and succeeding admirably).

So it shouldn't really surprise anyone by who lives and who dies. What is surprising, however, is how the characters -- who should have been mere cardboard -- turn into semi-three-dimensional people.  I was most impressed with the role of guy in drag. There was a real poignancy to some of his scenes; his need for validation through sex.

Speaking of sex, the sexuality is highly erotic but not barrier pushing. The sex in this movie was more like a daytime soap or an episode of the old MTV show ""Undressed"" than a more overt display that's so commonplace in straight movies (of any kind) and that was such a big deal in Brokeback Mountain. To put a positive spin on that, then, this is a gay movie straight people will watch easily.  Attractive, Beverly Hills, 90210-type actors in an effective slasher flick.  No gross-out deaths, as seems to be the trend nowadays, but more of an emphasis on the suspenseful, which I find much ""scarier"" and certainly smarter.

The one issue I have with the film is the lack of motivation for the killer. I was waiting for a motive. The bad guys ALWAYS have a motive. But I can see the genius in NOT giving him a motive: the filmmakers were damned if they did, whichever direction they'd chosen to go. Motive would mean determination of the killer's sexuality, and a straight killer would mean this movie was anti-gay and about gay bashing. A gay killer would indicate to many that gayness leads to dysfunction, self-hatred, etc. (see De Palma's Dressed to Kill). This whole controversy is avoided, smartly, but it gives the ending a lack of something for me: gravitas, maybe, I'm not sure. And the very final image (I won't spoil it here) is SO cliche it made me groan.  But again, this speaks of the mainstreaming of gay culture: gotta leave room for a sequel!",1151539200,6,2582,4.622270742358078

1557923,3,B00005JONL,"HellBent (Paul Etheredge, 2004)

The world's first gay-themed slasher movie is... well, just another slasher movie, really. Which on the one hand was a really good idea; anyone who wanders into this can be certain of what they're getting. On the other hand, if you're going to break the mold by making every character in your movie gay (with the possible exception of the killer), you might as well bend a few other genders, right? Etheredge (Angel of Death) played it safe, instead.

Plot: You've seen slasher movies, right? Four pals--cop-with-a-desk-job Eddie (Come Away with Me's Dylan Fergus), his little brother Joey (Pumpkin's Hank Harris), horndog Chaz (The Box's Andrew Levitas), and drag queen Tobey (Champion's Matt Phillips), are getting ready for the town's big gay Halloween carnival. A killer murdered two gay men in a secluded parking lot just on the other side of the woods from the carnival grounds, and Chaz has the brilliant idea of parking in that same secluded lot and hiking through the woods to get to the carnival... which needless to say attracts said serial killer's attention. When they get there, Eddie, who's smitten with bad-boy biker Jake (The Absent's Bryan Kirkwood), tries to get some in what may be the most awkward, embarrassing attempt at a pickup scene ever filmed, while Jake makes a similarly inept attempt to get to know hunky jock fratboy Jared (Baron Rogers in his first feature appearance), who he's had a longtime crush on. Tobey, getting no action, finds himself sitting with another drag queen at the bar complaining about men, and Chaz, being Chaz, parties it up with anyone and everyone who comes his way. None of them know they're being stalked by a crazed killer--until it's too late...

The things I liked about this movie, I really, really liked. About half the soundtrack is amazing; I had no idea the homocore/queercore movement had produced artists of the caliber of Kent ""Nick Name"" James and Terri Laird, both of whom turn in top-notch tunes. And that pickup scene? So awkward, so awful, so real, and it is helped immensely by Etheredge (who also wrote the script) having Jake react to it so perfectly (and, of course, Fergus and Kirkwood having the acting ability to pull it off). It's the little bits like that that make this movie worth watching. On the flip side of this is the movie's predictability, the kinda-incoherent ending that will satisfy exactly no one, the fact that there's no way in hell Tobey was going to be the one of these guys who was going home alone (I mean, come on, he's hot as a woman)...just a little too much in here I couldn't buy to offset all the stuff I was willing to pay extra for. It's good, but it's not great; if gay-themed movies don't turn you off, this one is worth a shot. ***",1368230400,,2777,4.733471074380165

1557926,5,B00005JONL,"There are almost no LGBT themed horror films in which the protagonists and survivors are LGBT rather than the killer. Hellbent is an excellent effort to change that.

It works the formula of Halloween (in fact, it even takes place on Halloween): there's a masked murderer on the loose, taking down a certain group of young friends one by one. But it also changes up the usual tropes. Since the entire cast of victims is male, and queer at that, the ""slut"" character is the role of Chaz, who is after all more promiscuous than his buddies. He's also the only ostensibly bisexual character, which plays with several social prejudices as well as the usual ""slut"" character trope of slasher films. SPOILER ALERT: the ""young, innocent"" one is the first to get killed, which is usually the exact opposite of the slasher genre. Welcome to the queering of horror.

Considering the relative obscurity of the actors, the production values, and the fact that no one expected a gay horror movie to sell, the film is quite strong.

The more I watch it, the more craft I notice. Eddie, the main protagonist (somewhat virginal, goodie-goodie, gorgeous yet shy and physically disabled), is shown from the very beginning to have an attraction to bad boys. He works for the police, but couldn't make it onto the force due to a serious injury. In his first scene, his sister (an unfortunately underdeveloped character) is teasing him for printing out mug shots of attractive criminals. Needless to say, he meets his dreamboat in Jake, a character homage to Brando in The Wild Ones. Eddie even has a poster of Brando from this film in his locker. The first time he meets Jake, the man is getting a tattoo, and a single drop of inky blood rolls down his spine. That single drop contains everything that this film (and the slasher genre in general) is about: danger and pain, but also youth and sexuality. Their awkward flirtation shows strong writing as well as strong performance (plus they're both total hunks).

All of this to say that Hellbent is, for a slasher film, far more subtle and well crafted than many would give credit. It's a must-see for slash fans, especially those who resist ""gay"" movies.",1359504000,,2186,4.744736842105263
1557996,5,B00005JONL,"I am a big horror movie fan, but I always find the gay image in horror is way stereotypical and a mockery of the community.  This is not only one of my favorite Halloween films, but it is also my favorite gay film.  Stereotyping still takes place in the movie, however its not overplayed and characters are well developed.  A must see for any gay horror fan.",1350345600,,358,4.313432835820896

1557998,4,B00005JONL,"Hellbent was the first completely gay themed Slasher film I have ever seen and I really liked it.
The guys were hot,the story was intriguing and the effects were done well for the budget that was afforded it.
A mysterious masked man is stalking three gay friends as they head out for a night of fun and mischief on Halloween night. The masked man has an amazing body just like most of the other gay men that are congregated at this Mardi Gras like party  so he doesn't seem like a threat because he blends in but his actions become more and more bizarre and then the fun and slashing really begins,although the beginning did start out with a really good decapitation scene as the body count racked up two before the movie really got started..'gotta love that,as a slasher fan'.
I found it to be very progressive and I hope to see more movies that have gay story lines that don't just involve Aids,sex and tragedy.",1317254400,3,913,4.467065868263473
1557999,3,B00005JONL,"This is a good movie in the genre, because it dealt with a horror theme throughout that was very entertaining: the effect of alcohol and drunkenness on your vulnerability. Had the movie been expertly directed, this movie could have been a horror classic due to the confidence the victims started out with when sober -- but little by excruciatingly little -- lost as the partying wore on on Halloween night in West Hollywood. Costumes and actions blended to confusing effect -- unfortunately for the inebriated hunks. The other element that made this movie interesting and very much worth seeing for horror fans, was the loser factor of the hero. He was missing an eye, and the killer pursued him and his friends knowing this, creepily using it to his obsessive advantage. For me as a gay guy, it was a must see, because of the free and loose happy lifestyle of the people involved. To see gay characters in this setting is a total rush from years of exclusively being forced to see girls and their boyfriends since, for me, 1977. A must see to those seeking to break away from robot slasher fare.",1314230400,,1096,4.654639175257732
1558000,3,B00005JONL,"The DVD box cover states Hellbent is from the Co-Creator of Halloween & one of the producers of Nightmare On Elm St. Hmm, that's impressive but somehow I don't recall any of the names on the credits here in those tried-and-true classics.

Supposedly, the first gay horror/slasher film ever, Hellbent is definitely worth a look although I'd highly suggest a rental before purchasing. There are some great moments & overall the film is quite fun but the production value leaves a lot to be desired & the plot is incredibly thin. In fact, the film looks like it was shot on 8mm which is definitely not cool as the Carnival here should've been captured on the highest quality film imaginable. If you are just looking for a straight-forward slasher film though (no pun intended), you could do a lot worse.

Halloween night in West Hollywood must be one of the most entertaining night os the year from the looks in this film. We see good looking guys everywhere partying like it's 1984 but many females will be somewhat let down. Unfortunately, most of them are bisexual or gay. Even so, it's a carnival full of festivities & everybody seems to be having a great time for the most part. Unfortunately, there is a psychopath in a devil's mask on the loose & he's prone to strike at any given moment.

Hellbent does a fairly decent job of remaining humorous & fairly suspenseful throughout the 84 minutes while teasing it's viewer with much innuendo. In the end though, much more is discussed or suggested than actually shown. The gore shots are few & far in between but just enough to satisfy the casual slasher film fan or usual R-rated Horror material fanboys. This would be an entertaining flick for your Halloween party as long as your guests are relatively open minded.

What made Hellbent way too typical in my opinion was the lack of plot & slim characterization. It would have been interesting to know more about the lead characters & perhaps a bit of detail could been shed on their pasts. Also, I was rather disappointed in the end as we never see the killer's face nor do we ever understand why he kills gay men. Worse yet, we don't learn why the killer singled out these five guys at the Halloween party rather than attacking party-goers at random.

What I did like the best about this film is the lesson we learn time & time again. When you go to these events, there is definitely safety in numbers. Don't leave your buddy alone for a booty call.",1309219200,,2452,4.589041095890411

1558002,4,B00005JONL,"I am not a gay movie fan nor a slasher fan, but happened upon this surfing LOGO...the script is OK, soundtrack is good, the acting is passable with the exception of Bryan Kirkwood who brilliantly plays a rough trade leather dude.  He really gives the character and the movie a level of dimension where another actor might have created another cliche.  He really nails the personality type of these guys right down to the aversion to kissing.  Kirkwood creates a very ""butch"" and threatening character... I think that it is worth it just to see him in the few scenes that he has. It reminds me a little of the rough trade character that Richard Gere played in ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"", 1978...Had this been a bigger budget movie, this could have been a star turn for Kirkwood in the same way that it was for Gere.  The director should have made a sequel to this given the way it ends but for whatever reason chose not to.  They could have picked up where Eddie and Jake left off...or better, they could do a remake of ""Cruisin'""(the 1978 Al Pacino thriller), with Kirkwood as the villian.",1267833600,3,1088,4.530612244897959

Instead of cute bimbo girls fleeing a killer, it just happens to be cute himbo boys. The acting was decent if a bit over the top at times, but still better than many indie gay films. The low budget aspect shows through at times but certainly no worse than any number of straight-to-DVD releases. My only gripe is being from West Hollywood, there were some inaccurate settings/locales in the film that really could have used the real name or location instead. For example, instead of pretending that there is some forest separating where the boys park and the West Hollywood Halloween Carnival, there was no reason it could not have been set in the actual West Hollywood Park parking area, as the boys would have still cut through a tree-filled park and the exact same scenes could have applied there.

1558124,3,B00005JONL,"""Hellbent"" is a nifty little thriller with a good personality.  It does what it is supposed to do--chills and thrills--and still manages to make its small cast of characters endearing before subjecting them to the razor sharp sickle of a stalker in a devil costume.  Set amidst the sexually charged, funky glamor of the annual Halloween Carnival in tres gay West Hollywood, the film has been touted as the first gay slasher movie.  I don't know if that's true, or if there has been a general outcry over gays being underrepresented in filmdom's slasher genre, but whatever the case, ""Hellbent"" is here, and it's done with a certain amount of flair.  Director Paul Etheredge-Ouzts knows how to wring a maximum amount of tension from a scene, and he brings a sense of visual excitement to the film, in spite of the occasional clunky dialogue and plot contrivances necessary for any slasher film (i.e., getting characters to go off into dark, isolated areas when they know that there's a murderer on the loose).  To be sure, the killer's targets, four friends out for a Halloween night on the town, are not rocket scientists, but each has his own set of quirks and foibles that separate one character from the other, and each one is likeable.

Dylan Fergus makes a handsome, appealing lead, a wannabe cop with one glass eye and the other eye on heartfelt romance; he's a sweet-natured, virginal dreamer, about as far from a tough guy as you can imagine.  Andrew Levitas is also convincing as the wild, anything-goes, best friend whose motto seems to be ""anyone, anyplace, anytime"".  Whether it's male or female, he's on it, and he's always ready for action.  Hank Harris, playing the naive youngster of the bunch, and Matt Phillips, as a muscular underwear model doing drag for the first time, do nice turns rounding out the group, while Bryan Kirkwood alternates between creepy/sexy and outright annoying as an edgy biker being wooed by our hero.

True, ""Hellbent"" is bloody, although not egregiously so. Compared to any of the films in the ""Saw"" franchise, for instance, it's pretty tame. There's one murder committed on a crowded dance floor that is particularly creative and stylishly filmed--it belies the film's budgetary restrictions.  The climax of ""Hellbent"", which finds one of the friends  handcuffed to a bed (courtesy of edgy biker-boy) while the killer lurks nearby is effective and scary, even if it is predictable.  And the film's final shot is set up so that you don't know whether to laugh or scream.

There have been worse slasher films than ""Hellbent"", and there have been better.  But, there hasn't been a better gay slasher film, so I guess that's saying something.  If you're weary of the endlessly cliched and tired parade of gay coming-of-age films, and those god-awful gay ""comedies"" that have been churned out in recent years (""Slutty Summer"", ""Another Gay Movie""), then you might want to check out ""Hellbent"".",1215907200,3,2934,4.9089068825910935

1558213,4,B00005JONL,"This movie is about a group of superficial party type gay men going out for a bit of partying and cheap slutty anonomous sexual fun and frolics.  They find most of what they want on their outting but the gay men do attract the attention of a stalker \ slasher \ killer who has a definite taste for young gay male flesh.

The HellBent is funny because, the gay men at times camp it up to draw laughs in ways only gay men can do.  The slasher is sort of funny because, he has no meat on his bones as a chacater.  Don't look for a movie that gets you into the mind of the killer because, there is none of that here.  Whatever derailed this slasher dudes trolley is not explored in detail during the film in any remotely imaginable way.  It is as if the gay slasher dropped from space with the single line program, ""Kill Gay Men!"".

The production values are ok but you definitely know this is a truly low budget movie.  The rough crude production values actually help HellBent because it lends a sort of realism that gets drained out when there is enough money to do a pretty boy artsy movie.  The guys in the HellBent are your typical Pretty Gay Party Boy Gym Cute wasp waisted muscle heads whose idea of an intellectual workout is guessing the current temp of the pool water at their current tricks home.

I brought HellBent because, I like slasher movies and a gay slasher movie is such a rare thing it was a must have in my DVD collection.  HellBent is a funny, gay slasher movie with the required lots of blood.  the guys are so one demensional it is obvious they are Class A air heads if not dope addicts.  If you expect too much from HellBent you will be easily disapointed but since I was not expected all that, and took the movie as just a fun way to waste an hour or so I give it four stars.  If I were grading this movie as a mainstream release by a huge production company I'd give it 2 stars if that!

Buy this HellBent because you have time to waste and you just want to see that rare animal ""a camp gay themed slasher movie with of course the obligatory transvestite, tired old queens, bathroom trolls and gay party boys"".  HellBent is a way to go slumming in a gay community without having to leave home!  Watch HellBent when you want to feel dirty without actually getting dirty and laugh the whole time.

1558214,2,B00005JONL,"Just because it has nearly all-gay characters or because the characters are cute doesn't make this film entertaining.

I would like to say what it lacks in polish it makes up for in story, but there isn't one.  A bunch of gay guys get their heads cut off.  By whom and why?  This isn't covered in the movie.  I'm not even sure why this movie was made, and am sorely disappointed if this is the best they can come up with.

It's probably worth a rental for the mindless idiocy of it all and to see the cute guys flirt with each other.  But don't expect much at all.

A few weeks ago I watched a lesbian slasher flick, ""Make A Wish"" and now the gay guys get theirs.  The big difference is the lesbians were boring while the guys had more fun even when getting slaughtered. Vivid and bloody death scenes but not over the top gory as some of these slasher movies can be. And the cast can really act and the film looks good for a low budget.  The movie even has some oddities and a physical flaw on one of the better looking friends that is used as a surprise ending.

This movie is definetly worth a rental and is a surprising novelty watching a slasher film not featuring a bunch of half-clad bimbos running around but a bunch of half-clad himbos running around.",1162684800,8,805,4.382550335570469
1558217,3,B00005JONL,"Don't purchase this planning to be scared. Startled once or twice, perhaps, but that's all; this movie knows it's a slasher flick and plays up most of the genre's cliches without going overboard like ""Scream"" did. It's a gay movie, so there's plenty of requisite shirtless men running around; there's also plenty of blood. In keeping with what probably a limited budget, you don't actually see much killing - it's insinuated, done off camera, and then the camera's back to the ""dead body."" I actually like the approach as it's a bit more subtle than, say, a ""Nightmare"" or ""Friday the 13th"" flick. This movie is a fun watch with friends; don't plan to watch it alone. Not that you'll be too scared to sleep - in fact, the movie might just put you to sleep. It's got more than a few slow spots, but with a few friends you can spend plenty of time ""telling"" the characters what to do (""no, don't go that way"") and making fun of the few production foibles.

Perhaps the toughest thing ""Hellbent"" has going for it is that it's not quite good enough for an ""A"" rated movie (""A"" slasher flicks generally engage more supernatural elements; the bad guy in ""Hellbent"" may just be a twisted mortal), but not bad enough to be a ""B"" movie. That puts it in an uncomfortable middle ground where you're wishing it was either much better, with perhaps a more detailed (if not credulous) plot, or much worse, with all the fun that comes with a bad slasher flick.",1162512000,4,1445,4.515267175572519

They could have easily substituted the gay guys with female co-eds and you'd still have pretty much the same movie. But it was a very nice change of pace seeing a scary movie with all gay characters.  It was nice to finally see the ""hero"" in a slasher movie be a strong gay man.  While the movie was pretty run of the mill as far as the slashing goes, the scenes involving the glass eyeball were original and somewhat creepy.  (I don't want to give too much away!)

It's Halloween in Hollywood (that's a horror in itself!), and Eddie who works for the West Hollywood Police Dept. sees the crime scene photos of two guys that got their heads chopped off while messing in Griffith Park.  ""Cut so clean, not even their tubes were crushed"" - oh, scary!  But, it is Halloween and Eddie (whose sister is a cop - Eddie has a glass eye and can only do paper work-plot trivia), takes his best friends Joey, Chaz and Tobey out for the night.  What could happen?  Okay, so there's the homely, but nice friend.  Then the model that dresses in drag and has low self esteem.  Then the hottie Hispanic, Tobey (who should never have been killed; sorry for the spoiler).  What about Eddie?  Does he get sliced like the rest?  (Sorry for the spoiler).  Regardless, this actually has some tension and scary fun mixed into the party atmosphere.  Sure, the killer is random and is never explained (No, Mommy didn't beat or abuse him and Daddy might have been home for baseball, but who cares?)  Its just scary fun and the ending is fairly inventive.

It is a basic slasher movie with the twist being that the main characters are gay.  Big woof!  Other then the guys' being yummy eye candy it was just a good horror flik.  IF you like the ""dead teenager"" type movies of the 80's and 90's (Jason, Freddie, Michael Myers, Scream, etc..) you will not be disappointed.

Everyone does a good job in throughout.  From the cast and crew on I'm sure was a small budgeted film.  I hope that there will be a sequel the ending is even set's it up for one as with most movies in this genre.  But it seems that there will probably not be one.  This is mainly because the movie hasn't made enough money to grant that.  Interest, Yes.  Box office, No.  It is all about the money sadly.  Remember folks it is called SHOW BUSINESS!!!

Finally, Who plays the Devil?????  He is awesome.  Just the right amount of ""Scary SOB"" and ""Yes, he is hot!""  He is the epitome of the strong silent type.  I can't find out anything on him.  Was it one guy or more?  An actor/stuntman? No mention of him anywhere. Nothing.  No screen credit to be found, anywhere.  Many horror films that have such a character sometimes use several different persons in the role.  But they are usually mentioned at least on fan sites or boards.  But for this movie I haven't found any such thing. Keeping the anonymity of the actor is a novel touch but it would be nice to follow the performer's career also.",1158969600,7,1522,4.35
1558321,4,B00005JONL,"HELLBENT is a tough movie to classify. Yes, it is about a serial killer on one Halloween night in West Hollywood, but it also seems to be a light-hearted takeoff on all the silly teenage massacre horror films. Is it parody or was it meant to be a thriller? No matter, because what we get is an entertaining, well-paced, witty-scripted, full of tension foray through the clubs and alleyways of the very colorful West Hollywood Halloween atmosphere.

Don't search for story motivation: there doesn't seem to be one. A devil-garbed body builder beheads boys, leaving the corpses sans heads to the horror of the community just as Halloween festivities are beginning. Our main characters are four friends who are out for a good time, the leader of whom is costumed as a cop and in reality is a wannabe policeman who failed the course due the loss of an eye. His fellow friends are zippy, tight, and fun loving and along the way many of them fall victim to the 'devil's scythe' (and yes, that is shown in grisly detail!). There is a lot of chase action in dark rooms and darker woods and alleys and the fear quotient is pretty high. The problem is the ending, which doesn't answer any plot motivational questions and unfortunately leaves the door open for future follow-up adventures (or is this merely part of the parody of the multitudinous versions of Freddy, I Know What You Did Last Summer, etc teenie flicks?).

The cast is attractive and seems to be enjoying themselves as actors. The lighting and costuming and musical scoring are on a par with the best production values of films of this genre. In the end it is fun to see a thriller played solely in the gay community without preachy comparisons or strife with the straight folk. It is entertaining for everyone.

1558322,3,B00005JONL,"""Hellbent"" is a good slasher flick. Strip away the fact that it takes place in the gay comunity and you would have a pretty genaric kill-em film... but since it has that extra oomph of controversy, this film also offers a little something more. For one, you get see a dynamic view of the pecking order in the gay culture (apparently, drag queens and leather lovers are near the bottom of the chain) and the kills seems to be driven by some odd perversion.

It starts with two guys ""going at it"" in a cruising area only to be slaughtered at a most inopprotune moment. The first kill is graphic and sets the sights for what is going to happen later. Enter our four friends (scyth fodder to some) as they head out to a carnival to celebrate halloween. They start out with each other and then get split up and it is then when the bloodbath ensues. When the characters are dispatched, it is in a particularly gruesome fashion. It seems that provoking the killer earlier (they mooned him in the woods) was really a bad idea afterall... and he got his revenge for that... and then some.

The acting was pretty decent... although it was a little shady due to shoddy camera work. This film was gritty... kind of in the vain of the Blair Witch Project. Still, it was captivating to watch these happless ""soon-to-be"" victims try to do challenging things throughout the night. In some cases, you feel sorry for the characters... one gets killed because they are sick of being rejected and basically chases the killer to get ""accepted"" only to meet a more gruesome fate.

What I really disliked... was the fact that nothing is really tied up. The killer is never revealed and with that go the motives. Why was he systemmaticly butchering gay guys? Why the particular group of guys in this film? Does he know them? The film started out so random and then became a bit methodical. Also, the kill that takes place in the middle of the club was way to unrealistic. You mean to tell me that a guy can get sliced and diced and then beheaded right in the thick of partiers... without a single person noticing that there is something ""not-right"" with the dancer loosing limbs in their midst? For real. That was a bit dumb.

Still, this film was a cut above average slasher fodder... but as I mentioned, take away the gay factor and it is still jsut another slasher flick. It is entertaining to watch... and at times a little nerve wracking. It isn't great... and it isn't bad. It is simply above-average as it delivers the blood and guts with hints of message story telling thrown in for a little extra flavor.",1158537600,3,2589,4.502127659574468
1558323,4,B00005JONL,"Hellbent was a real surprise for me. It is a well made, high production value, well acted, well scripted, well shot, low budget film. Think Halloween rather than Friday the 13th.

A group of west Hollywood friends who are gay head out to WeHo's famous Halloween parade and then on to bars to drink and see who they can see. (This setup is not too far afield of many other slasher film set ups). Along the way they manage to draw the attention of a serial killer of homosexuals dressed as a devil. The rest of the film is standard slasher film stuff: they run and some die and they run some more, and more die and then a heroic man survives the day to destroy the evil only to realize that evil just ain't gonna lie down and die.

So what's the attraction; why bother? Well, the easy reason is that this film is made by but not necessarily for the homosexual community. The actors are all portraying gay men (though the actors are not necessarily gay - it is, after all, currently avante garde to play gay). Then, the set up works well within the gay genre - gay men being attacked for being gay - wow, that's not only believable but very very real.

What makes this film unique (from most of the gaysploitation films being made) is that the production values are so amazingly high. These men can act. This script is tight. The filming is of a high quality. The editing is top notch. The direction is good. This film is highly watcheable.

My gripe? Why the heck is the killer doing what he's doing? What's up with that?

Is my gripe with Hellbent in particular for this? Nah. It's pretty much part and parcel with the film genre.

Is that good? Yup. I think Hellbent's producers intended to make a good gay horror film to show that a good horror film can exist with gay characters and not necessarily appeal to only homosexuals. I don't know that its theatrical release would have acheived that, but I do believe that word of mouth with spread and that the film may eventually find favor with teenaged boys who want a good scare, regardless of the lack of boob shots.

For the record, there is little man-to-man contact in this film beyond kissing (and that is to a bare minimum). There is ZERO nudity and the four letter word count is quite possibly less than a single episode of NIP/TUCK....in fact, NIP/TUCK is probably far racier than this film. The gore...well that's another story. This is, after all, a slasher film.

Rent this and you won't be disappointed. It's a good slasher film - and not just for the gay community.",1158537600,45,2528,4.433189655172414
1558324,5,B00005JONL,"I like horror movies. I have an affinity for slasher flicks, always have. Why? Well the formula of course; the simple fact that the most infuriating personality types are always represented by the victims who die unmercifully horrific deaths in these films. These are the people who tap dance on my last nerve, the people with that irritating pseudo-superiority that surround me in my everyday life. The slasher film is a cathartic release for me. I'm not one to go out & behead the guy who's in such a hurry to get where's going that he cuts me off in traffic; however, watching a self-important prick of the same caliber get his in one of these films is priceless.

So what does that last paragraph half to do with Hellbent? Well, in addition to being a slasher film fan I also happen to be gay. So if there does happen to be a gay man in a slasher flick he never lives, that is until you have a movie where everyone is gay. It's about time there was a semi-mainstream slasher movie for the modern `mo.

In conclusion, unfortunately the acting isn't the greatest & the story has some serious holes, but for what it is, a slasher movie filled to the brim with exposed man-flesh, it's an enjoyable watch. The cast is rather attractive and you never go too long without some excuse for one or all of the people on screen to be at some level of undress or at least topless.

I'm glad I own it, but like I said I'm a slasher flick fan, it's what I enjoy--so to the fellow fans out there pick this one up, you'll watch it more than once. Regardless of your particular level of slasher fandom it's worth a viewing so if you don't think it merits a place in your collection you should at least rent it or find a fan in your circle of friends and put together a themed viewing party.",1158537600,4,1776,4.311377245508982
1558325,3,B00005JONL,"It sort of brings new meaning to the phrase ""he's looking to get some head."" In this case, ""he"" is a serial slasher who ambuses cute young gay guys, slashes and beheads them with a sickle, and keeps the head as a souvenier.

""Hellbent"" (2004) is billed as the ""first gay slasher film"", and it is mostly a very good effort.  It centers on a group of four gay friends in West Hollywood: Eddie (an employee of the police department, and son of a cop killed in action), his younger brother Joey (a busboy who has a crush on a gay football player from his school), Chaz (the ""class clown"" type, who never turned down a chance to party, and Tobey, a print model.  It's Halloween, and they decide to go together, in costume, to the WeHo Halloween Carnival, which is crowded as ever despite the previous evening's finding of two victims of the slasher in a park nearby.  Dared into it by Chaz, they walk through the park en route to the carnival, and spot a muscular guy in a devil costume, but - in typical Weho ""party boy"" fashion - they assume he is just some old queen who is attracted to them.  At the carnival, Eddie spots Jake, a biker he was cruising earlier in the day, and introduces himself.  Chaz looks after the younger Joey, who is dressed in a leather outfit to attract his football player, but gives them some space so they can hook up.  Unfortunately, the slasher has been following them, and targets them one by one.  Tobey, who is dressed in drag, actually chases after the ""devil man"", and makes a pass at him.  Bad idea.

Executive Producer Joseph Wolf's credits include two of the ""Halloween"" series and the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", so this is a genre in which he is used to excelling.  Unfortunately, the screenplay and small budget fall significantly short of that level, but do a commendable job with what they have.  The young, mostly straight cast provide credible performances, though the roles hardly call for much depth.  The special effects (some of which are explained in the Here! TV ""making of"" featurette, which is the only ""extra"" offered on the DVD) cut some corners, and were effective primarily because the photography (using blurred scenes, strobe and bright lights) made them look more realistic than they were. In watching the film, I found reasons for laughter about as often as fright, which is true for me with the best horror films.  The filmmaker deserves credit for the nonstereotypical, realistic characters, and for having their sexual orientation not the focus of the attacks.  However, this is the only horror film I can think of that gave no explanation whatsoever of the killer's identity, motivation or selection of his victims, and I would have liked to see the film extended to tie up those loose ends. Overall, a fairly good horror flick that breaks some new ground, and recommended for those who are fans of that genre.

1558326,2,B00005JONL,"This movie was down right horrible. No suspense whatsoever. It has absolutely no plot. I'm guessing the killer had something against the main character since he stuffed all the heads in his apartment. Did he have something against his dad? His dad was a cop. Did his dad arrest him once or something? Or were the details of his dad just thrown in there for no reason? Or is the killer just a homophobe? The ending of this movie is just insulting.

Well, ""Hellbent"" is here to remedy that situation. A killer wearing a horned mask and weilding a lethal sword that he uses to cleanly chop the heads off his victims, is on the loose. His focus is four young men (one in drag) who are attending a Halloween party. Not nearly bad as I expected (the acting and production values are actually quite good) but nothing exceptional. The only unique perspective this films brings is the gay angle. If you enjoy a good slasher film that avoids a motive or a viable explanation and is filled with a few good scares and lots of blood (and half nude actors!), it is worth a look.",1158278400,21,780,4.5
1558328,3,B00005JONL,"Queer horror fans, gather round.  We finally have our very first all gay, all hotboy slasher flick.  Promises of blood and gore, scares, hotties in various stages of undress, and one hot psychopath.  It's about time our community was treated exactly the same when it comes to getting butchered on Halloween night.  Unfortunately, that's exactly what happens.

It's the night before Halloween in West Hollywood.  Two young nubile youths are parked near the woods, making out, heating things up when a man wearing a devil mask and not much else shows up wanting head.  Their heads, actually, which he has no problems slicing clean off.

The next day, Eddie, a once wannabe-cop who couldn't make the force because of a medical condition, and his friends Chaz, Joey, and Tobey, gear up for the annual Halloween festival.  For laughs, the guys go to the crime scene and take a walk through the woods where the guys were murdered.  The urge to urinate hits them all at once, so, of course, they split up.  The HotDevilMan lurks in the bushes, watching them.  The boys see him and begin taunting him, thinking he's trying to cruise them.  Here we're given a scene that shows potential.  The misty woods and the silhouette of the HotDevilMan are fairly creepy as he darts in and out from behind trees.  Unfortunately the director ruins the tension by having the boys act out stupidly.  The rest of the night is spent being stalked by the masked man while Eddie tracks down the badboy of his dreams, dorky Joey tries to find the jock of his dreams, bisexual Chaz hunts down anything with two legs, and poor, beautiful Tobey ponders and whines about his decision to dress in drag.  One by one, the boys meet their maker in typical, bloodsoaked fashion.

Unlike most independently produced queer films, the problem here doesn't come from bad acting or poor production values.  The boys do a more than respectable job, and the blood and decapitated bodies look better than some we get in studio produced fare.  It's not even a god-awful script, for that matter, although it isn't that great.  The biggest problem is that the filmmakers seem to believe that the only new twist they need to offer is the ""gay"" element.  While I'm happy to have seen the film, and to see that yes, indeed, gay boys can hold their own against a masked killer without running away like nelly queens, I'm not happy that they were given nothing new to work with.  It was a missed oppurtunity to breathe new life into a genre dying a slow death.  The popularity of the horror film died towards the beginning of the nineties, only to be brought back to rip-roaring life in 1996 with the Scream series.  Since then we've seen a handful of good slasher flicks, but also some of the worst stuff since the myriad of Elm Street and Friday the 13th sequels.  (Okay, I must admit, I love that stuff, but that doesn't mean it isn't retarded.)  Sure, Hellbent is fun to look at; the shirtless boys are a refreshing move from shirtless girls, the camera has an eye for style, and it does contain one or two scares (a glass eye offers the best scene in the movie).

The film wants to revolutionize, or at least help evolve, the genre. It fails for the exact same reasons all the ""straight"" horror films do; poor plotting, no consistent scares or true suspense, characters we don't really care about, a killer without reason, and an unsatisfying ending.
