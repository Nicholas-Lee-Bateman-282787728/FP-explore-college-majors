The English subtitles make the video easy to understand; however, the instructor teaches the first techniques but the skips the next 5. I'm not sure if the instructor just forgot or what. But I did make it through this video and it was a-lot of fun. And by watching the instructor doing the form its easy to pick up the pieces he left out. If you are practicing Northern Shaolin then this form will fall right into place.",1320537600,2,582,4.3
