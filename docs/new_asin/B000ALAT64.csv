2389652,5,B000ALAT64,"When I ordered this title, together with Welles' ""Macbeth"" and ""Falstaff (Chimes at Midnight)"", I was highly suspicious and doubtful about the true quality potential, since I had read that ""Othello"" and ""Macbeth"" were a Korean pressed DVD, and ""Chimes at Midnight"" (as ""Falstaff"" was originally called by Welles himself) a Brazilian one.

Once I did receive the package, not only was I impressed by the excellent condition of the three, but once watched them on my top of the line system, I could not believe my eyes, nor my ears.

The images on all three were crystal clear and finally there were just very unnoticeable scratches and some very tiny specks, but really nothing to be compared with older and shabbier versions, including VHS tapes of yesteryear.

All three were filmed in Black and White and now the contrast and the Grayish shades have been finely restored to their original values as if they had been printed today.

The sound, in particular, and especially in ""Othello"" is in an unbelievable 2.0 Stereo Surround, of course completely reworked and minutely re-sychronized in the 1990s and the dialogues a finally sharp and clear.

On a scale from 1 to 3, I would say that the 1952 ""Othello"" restoration receives a 1 (for being the best one of the lot), followed by 2 ""Chimes at Midnight"" and 3 ""Macbeth"".

Mind you, all three have been fully restored in sound and picture quality and the DVDs honor the memory of a giant such as Orson Welles.
It is just that probably, due to the original sound material used on ""Macbeth"" in 1948, by today standards, although the sound is also very clear and
somewhat rounded up, it still sounds a bit shrill to the ears in some parts of the film.

But believe me, all three, starting with the masterpiece of the lot, ""Othello"", are well worth their price.

Amazing is only the fact, that although the restoration of all three was done in the United States, they never saw the light as regular Studio library DVD releases (perhaps too shy?), and only the Koreans and the Brazilians has the good taste and the guts to transfer them.

Of course, considering the treatment that Orson Welles received from the Studios back in those days, I doubt he would very much mind if some other Nation represents him more honorably than the Nation that owes him so many masterpieces such as ""Citizen Kane"". ""The Magnificent Ambersons"", ""The Lady from Shanghai"" and ""Touch of Evil"".

This only proves one thing, still nowadays.
No one is a prophet in his own homeland.

Pity, since the Studios these days, could really profit from people like Orson Welles or say, Stanley Kubrick.

They badly need such visionaries to work for them.

But alas, their corporate nature makes them blind, deaf and mute to such geniuses.

O for a muse of fire...

Highly recommended for all who love good and great Cinema as it should be done.",1251676800,19,2857,4.708835341365462
2389653,5,B000ALAT64,"Orson Welles worked on and off for four years to complete his remarkable adaptation of OTHELLO, which was filmed in Morocco and Italy. When cash was short, Orson would take acting jobs (""The Third Man,"" for one) in order to fund his pet project.

Winner of the Palm d'Or at Cannes in 1952, THE TRAGEDY OF OTHELLO: THE MOOR OF VENICE was released in America three years later and was briefly shown in only two cities. The movie literally disappeared after that-- the negative assumed lost somewhere in France. Forty years later, Orson's daughter searched and eventually located this one and only silver nitrate master in New Jersey, of all places.

In pristine condition visually, restoration was only needed for the audio track. The Chicago Symphony re-recorded note-for-note the original score and this new track was ""flown in."" The results, picture and sound-wise are superb! Pictorially, OTHELLO is by far Orson's best work-- its beautiful scenery, imaginative edits, angles and lighting make for a movie that visually rivals the greatest works of the silent era, and in fact would stand up well in that genre.

As for the tragedy of the jealous Moor-- those unfamiliar with Renaissance-era English may at times wonder if the actors are speaking a foreign language! Yet, because of strong visuals the storyline isn't hampered by this. Welles's OTHELLO is the epitome of great film making. Along with Anthony Hopkins in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TITUS/dp/B000E6ESKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TITUS</a>&nbsp;(1999), it's by far my favorite screen version of Shakespeare.

2389654,4,B000ALAT64,Excellent acting with Orson Wells as Othello.  The Lawrence Olivier version is impossible to find. There are newer films of Othello such as the Lawrence Fishburn one but I cannot use them in my school classroom because they are rated R and the Orson Wells version is approved by the school district.  My students found the film noir version interesting with the stark  black and white and odd camera angles that increased tension in the viewer to match the tension in the play.,1169164800,6,477,4.72289156626506
2389655,5,B000ALAT64,"Controversial and weird, this eccentric masterpiece adds a dimension to Othello present in no other film version:  the frenzied mindlessness of evil.  Welles' fast cutting, shortening of the play, plus the incredible performance of the legendary Dublin stage actor Michael Macliammor all add to this effect.

Welles himself portrays a stuttering, flubbering and blustery Othello. Yes, it looks a little canned -- see his similar walk through his relatively poor Macbeth.  Here, however, it simply works in context, egged on by the extraordinary Macliammor (who in real life tutored boy Welles when he escaped to Dublin before his Mercury Theatre days).  So Orson here, among a lot else, returns the compliment, resulting in one of the most fascinating stabs at Shakespeare caught on film in century 20.  Some are troubled by Maclaimmor's face as a uniform mask of evil.  But this simply shows how the performance is registering on a subconscious level.  Also, both the performances and direction owe a lot to the silent film era and early German film expressionism, heavy influences on Welles who is too often held up (and then roughly put down) as boy genius gone bad.

No, evil is not very interesting at all, finally.  Those who have yet to face that bald fact out of life itself may balk at this production.  There are also controversies over whether Welles ever really ""finished"" it (the fact is he ""finished"" quite little in his life), and about this restoration by his daughter Beatrice, recently slandered in a new Welles bio.  I vote for Beatrice.  The new soundtrack and music are simply necessary to make this film palatable, and the images are dazzlingly restored.  Truth is, Welles goes in and out of vogue and not even viewable versions (much less scholar-certified definitive versions) of all his works are yet, to this date, available.  Would the naysayers be happier if Beatrice Welles just collected royalties and went on a Paris Hilton ego trip?  What some segments of the public these days seem to expect to be handed to them, duty free, is almost as appalling and parasitic as Macliammor's Iago.

Everything here works up to the horrific finale and the inspired final frames.  This is an Othello you will never forget, even if you only see it once. Sure, one needs to see other great Othellos if you can find them  (Olivier's differently eccentic version is scarce as hen's teeth). But this grand and bold experiment will teach you a lot about both the play and its horrific, eternal subject matter -- what the American writer Louis Auchincloss called ""motiveless malignancy.""  Next to Macliammor's Iago, Olivier's Richard III looks like an upstanding worthy fellow.",1166054400,35,2687,4.982062780269058
2389656,4,B000ALAT64,"Orson Welles spent four years putting together this movie. Always out of money, filming off the land all over Europe and Africa, it's a miracle the thing ever got made. It's a marvel of editing: within a 5-second scene, there may be a difference of two years and a thousand miles shown. He hated the voices of some of the major actors and redubbed them - poorly, so that words and lips aren't synchronized. He employs fast cutting and other Wellesian visual techniques, but he took great liberties with the Bard. In pieces the movie has high points - the Turkish bath scene, for example - but as a whole it's disappointing. Welles spent so much time filming and editing that he forgot it eventually was going to be shown to an audience. It's a movie only Welles could appreciate.

8078767,4,B000ALAT64,"Say what you will about Orson Welles, he had a gift for Shakespeare. All his Shakespearean adaptations are at least worth watching. I admit right off -- I tend to prefer Shakespeare on the page to Shakespeare on the stage, and think of the Bard of Avon more as a poet who used theatre as a scaffold on which to build than as a dramatist who wrote poetic dialogue. (Not about to argue with Bardolators here.) Welles didn't so much stage Shakespeare, though, as use his work as his own scaffold--he was, if you like, a collaborator with Shakespeare, as is clearest in Chimes at Midnight. Although not up to Chimes, the Welles/Shakes Othello is very effective. Sometimes, though, it achieves its effects at the expense of the play.
Welles' best inspiration, of many, is the repeated visual motif of spirals and cages. Of course he had to trim the script, and I'd argue with his choices (how much of this is due to lost footage, though?). I think he over-trimmed to make room for his visuals. If you don't already know the plot, it becomes muddy near the end, so I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as his first experience of Othello. The roles of Emilia and Cassio in particular are too severely cut, to the extent that these characters somewhat recede into the scenery; in particular, Welles omits the witty banter about women in II, 1, among Desdemona, Emilia, Cassio, and Iago, which may seem extraneous but is actually vital, in that it sets up Cassio as sympathetic and intelligent, hardly the effete nincompoop Iago initially describes, and also establishes the relationship between Emilia and Iago which makes her willingness to steal the hanky understandable. In Welles' under-explained version, in which we see her stock-still in shadow after Desdemona loses the handkerchief, she comes across initially as just as sinister as Iago himself - utterly wrong. And you may miss other favourite speeches.
I can't argue with any of the cast. MacLiammoir is probably the most convincing Iago I've seen. Desdemona is appropriately beautiful, if oddly passive; the dialogue cuts take much of the spunk out of her. Combined with the cuts to Cassio and Emilia, this becomes a little too much a two-hander between Iago and Othello. Welles is always Welles, like Othello himself, a force of nature who sucks up all the air in any room.
If, like me, you turn on the closed captions for the hearing impaired (I'm not hearing impaired but I use them), be warned. As is true of most captioning, the solecisms are numerous and laughable. Sometimes the word is just wrong: ""rocks and hills"" = ""rocks and tills""; ""so expert in his drinking"" = ""so exquisite in his drinking""; ""work upon Desdemona"" = ""work from Desdemona""; etc. Sometimes the error actually reverses the meaning: ""some strange indignity"" = ""some strange dignity"". Some make no sense at all: ""portents in my travel's history"" = ""potency in my travels history""; ""he that filches from me"" = ""he that flinches from me""; etc. Some are just weird or even laughable: ""such a fiend as that"" (variorum; in my edition, Brabantio says ""such a thing as thou"")"" = ""such a fierce bat""! What does that even mean?!? Now, you'd think I'd be used to inept captioning. At least it isn't complete gibberish. But especially given the care that went  into the restoration and packaging of the DVD -- and that, excuse me, the script is available! -- there is simply no excuse for this.",1407801600,,3413,4.784745762711864
8078768,5,B000ALAT64,"Sure, Shakespeare is great, one of the finest writers the world has ever known.  Dumas pere said ""After God Shakespeare created most.""  But Orson Welles is also great, one of the best ever American film directors.  So Welles starts his film version of Shx's ""Othello"" with the villain, Iago, already squatting a a cage like the evil ape he is.  And when Iago is spinning lies about Othello's wife, Desdemona, Iago and Othello are walking by over-towering fishermen's nets resembling a spider web with Iago the spider.  And when Iago is controlling Roderigo it's done in a turkish bath with water dripping through the wooden slats of the floor.  But here's the gist of it all---Welles's version is substantially more faithful to Shx, and more true, than any slavish literal filming of the play.  It's daring, it's visually stunning, and if you like movies and if you like Shakespeare and if you like Orson Welles you do not have a single valid excuse not to get this DVD.  It's a cultural touchstone",1399075200,,998,4.761627906976744
