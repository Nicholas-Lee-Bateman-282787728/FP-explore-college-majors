3918917,5,B002EOVWVQ,"After years of waiting, Patricio Guzman's epic documentary ""The Battle Of Chile"" finally makes its DVD debut. This is a rich, astounding chronicle of the Chilean Revolution under Salvador Allende, the cultural battles which sprouted as a result and how it all came to a tragic end in a CIA-sponsored military coup. This is not just a simple documentary on a historical event however, this is a powerful, visually stunning work with a scope that ranks it alongside political films like ""The Battle Of Algiers,"" ""Salvador"" and ""Z."" Guzman here doesn't just give us a great chronicle, but great cinema.

""The Battle Of Chile"" begins midway through the administration of Allende, who made history by becoming the world's first elected Marxist president. Guzman and his crew introduce us to Allende's Chile just as the population prepares to vote in a crucial parliamentary election. Allende is determined to show the world that a socialist transformation can be carried out through democratic, peaceful means and so his project is hampered by a system ruled by an old oligarchy and corporate elites. Guzman and his editors do a great job balancing intimate portraits of Chilean citizens and their concerns, hopes and dreams along with sharp reporting on political developments as right-wing members of congress work hard to derail all of Allende's progressive reforms. The opening of ""Part 1"" is fascinating as Guzman walks around the capital of Santiago interviewing average citizens and asking who they will vote for and why. He shows us both sides of the debate as working class Chileans express their support for Allende and his social reforms and upper class Chileans spew venomous hatred for the government. When Allende's coalition, Unidad Popular, wins the elections, the right-wing takes the battle into the streets and that's where the film truly does justice to its title. Chile turns into a political battleground as the workers become more militant in defense of the Revolution, forming popular committees, educating themselves politically and even engaging in street combat when fascist groups try to provoke strikes and start turning to bombs and plans for a coup when they realize they cannot defeat Allende through elections.

Like many of the best documentaries, ""The Battle Of Chile"" is impressive just in the way it was made. It is amazing to think Guzman had one camera most of the time, or that this was shot by a two, three man team. The images are epic and crisp, cinematic in scope and never boring. There are scenes of street combat where we are taken directly into the action, we never feel like outside observers during this entire film. Guzman takes us inside popular meetings, he lets the workers talk to us, express their ideals and criticisms, nobody feels like an interview subject but like people expressing their minds while experiencing a historical event. This film also never feels small, it is truly grand as Guzman goes everywhere from the copper minds where the right-wing tries to breed descent to towns where revolutionary workers demand arms to gatherings of Chile's US-trained military commanders, as they wait and see how things develop before deciding to move against the Revolution. We get epic vistas of Chile's cities and rural zones, with a brilliant establishment of time and space.

""The Battle Of Chile"" is the best film on the Allende years because you get a true inside view of what it was like. Most documentaries made today which touch on the subject of Allende and the US-backed coup have to depend on surviving witnesses, some who's attitudes may have changed over the years, but this is a film made in the moment. A great bonus DVD added here is Guzman's sequel, ""Chile, Obstinate Memory"" where he returns to his country after 20 years in exile. Here we get to revisit some of the original people featured in ""The Battle Of Chile"" as they reflect on how the country went from a fever of hope to a period of fascist tyranny and death camps under Augusto Pinochet. One truly powerful moment comes when Guzman shows ""Battle Of Chile"" to a group of young Chileans raised under Pinochet's shadow, stunned to see in the film a history blocked from their lives.

In a way ""The Battle Of Chile"" is more important now than at any other time, especially when one looks at the current political changes taking place in Latin America. Many of the class battles and intrigue we see here are no doubt taking place again in countries like Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador. This is not just a powerful document of a revolutionary period in Chile, but a masterful chronicle of a nation and people experiencing a unique moment in history. ""The Battle Of Chile"" is exciting, important and timeless.",1263945600,87,4734,4.943467336683417
3918918,4,B002EOVWVQ,"This a rare and interesting documentary about one of the most controversial military coups in history! It was the first time an elected communist government had been overthrown by force and this alone polarised opinion with much of the factual data being lost in the process. Guzmn was a recently graduated student from Spain and clearly one holding extreme left wing views, (not unusual for students at that time!) This long documentary tells the story from this point of view. There is hardly a word anywhere that makes any attempt to show why the coup took place from the point of view of the right. I have relatives in Chile who were in Santiago at this time and to make my position clear, we were and remain supporters of the coup, despite strongly condemning the many excesses that took place after the event. The dialogue in this film is full of classic left wing propaganda. I spent time in China during and after the Cultural Revolution and such repetitive extreme political comments, against which it is pointless to argue, were daily fare! Disc 3 is particularly bad in this regard and I found it just too much.

Despite this reservation, the factual camera work is very dramatic and the first two discs are excellent value. Disc 4 is a later, (color), documentary about the Battle of Chile. Guzmn has both aged and matured and the views expressed a little more moderate. The sub-titles are very good and the sound and picture quality remarkable considering the conditions under which the filming took place.

Pinochet will always be controversial, but there are those that feel this was the coup that stopped communism in its tracks in latin America and was the first shot that led in due course to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Allende comes across as a rather decent fellow, somewhat nave perhaps, with strong principles but with no ability to control his extreme left wing. He paid the ultimate price for this shortcoming. Not all the facts claimed in the film are correct: After the coup Pinochet published his side of the story in ""El Libro Blanco"". Even if only half of the facts claimed in that book are true, then Allende had to go. All in all this is well worth buying whichever side of the political platform you support. Just be clear that in no way is it a balanced and objective picture of the coup, but bearing in mind the polarisation of feelings at that time and even up to the present day, such a view would be very hard to get and even harder to publish. Better look at the coup from both sides and make up your own mind. This is a good start.",1262304000,19,2572,4.577006507592191
3918955,3,B002EOVWVQ,"Viewing this movie you see a lot of similarities with what is happening in Venezuela. But the similarities are just in the appearance. Chile of 1973 is very different of Venezuela of 2013. First, Allende's coalition was a minority  in the congress. Chavez had an absolute control of the congress. Allende governed Chile for just three years. Chavez/Maduro had been in power for over 12 years. The economic crisis Chile suffered during those years was due to lack of hard currency and the strikes ordered by the opposition: elites and business class. The economic crisis in Venezuela is not due to lack of hard currency. It is mainly due to the mismanagement of the economy. Nevertheless the movie shows how the elites react when they see they no longer have the control.",1368835200,,770,4.833333333333333
3918956,4,B002EOVWVQ,"Objective coverage of period of drastic political change.  Three films made over a period of five years (1975-79) based on footage shot during 1970-73.  Gives the viewer a real sense of ""being there.""
  In the late 1960's and early 1970's there were arguments that if people want to effect change, they should ""use the system"" or ""work within the system"" rather than trying to overthrow ""the system.""  The Allende regime was a test case of trying to build a socialist society using the machinery of parliamentary democracy. Up to that time, Chile had a democratic government for over a century with only one two-year period of military rule. As the working class began to implement change, with increased electoral success, the wealthy engineered a coup, resulting in fifteen years of tyranny, torture, murder, concentration camps.
  This is an important document for students of political science and for others with an interest in the debate over how social change can be effected.  Although Guzman's sympathies were with the Allendists, his film presents facts and events and typical incidents which allow the viewer to come to her own conclusions about what mistakes were made by the people involved.",1366761600,10,1204,5.107142857142857
3918957,5,B002EOVWVQ,I haven't had a chance to watch it all yet. I've wanted this film for a long time.  It was worth the wait.  What a fantastic edition.  Appreciated the rapid delivery and good condition. Thanks for it all.,1362268800,,204,4.315789473684211
3918958,5,B002EOVWVQ,"This 4-disc box set contains the three separate parts of the original feature film made in the immediate years after the events of 1973, and released at different times rather than together, each part to a disc (they are quite lengthy) plus a 4th disc made from footage shot in 1996 when the surviving filmmakers went back to Chile to update what happened after the coup d'etat of 1973 and how events were viewed then, both by some of those who were around at the time and interestingly by some high school-girls who were born 6-7 years afterwards.  Even 23 years after 1973, the filmmakers had to be surrepticious in filming in some places, such as the Presidential Palace.

Director Patricio Guzmn is clearly sympathetic to the cause of the Popular Unity (the left wing alliance 1970-1973) and bias in material presented show, but this is understandable given the nature of the Pinochet junta and its human rights abuses. From a centrist viewpoint, however, there are some things that should be pointed out - Salvador Allende received only 37% of the vote in September 1970, so the claim that he was 'democratically' elected is quite tenuous - constitutionally, sure.  This point is downplayed.  The negative consequences of his economic policies (without consideration of the US sanctions) such as 140% inflation in 1972 and a huge deterioration in the country's trade balance, get ignored.  Allende didn't just nationalize the land holdings of big agriculturalists, all farms above a mere 80 hectares or 200 acres were nationalized.  Experience in countries such as Russia, Ukraine and most recently Zimbabwe show that this is disastrous.  Likewise, experience throughout the Eastern Bloc showed that state owned enterprises in a centrally planned economy can't compete with private enterprise and the market system for efficiency, productivity and innovation.  If Allende had wanted to redistribute wealth, he could have done it best through the tax and welfare systems which is what all western governments do successfully. But Allende was dogmatic, determined and uncompromising to the end - that comes through clearly.

The films clearly show the highly confrontational nature of both sides involved in the 'battle', which was mostly ideological rather than physical, and this is quite important in the understanding of why it all happened, although there are some dramatic 'action' moments too - none less than when a Swedish cameraman is shot dead by the soldier he is filming in the distance, who fires his rifle at him.

It all provides good insight into the nature of superpower politics in the 1970s and much food for thought.",1332720000,16,2640,5.104408352668213

3918960,4,B002EOVWVQ,"Overall, a very good documentary, however the position taken by the director seems to be a little one sided.  I would have liked to have heard the points of view of the more right wing population as well.  Of course in the end it is always the middle class that gets squeezed and the director did a good job voicing their plight and uncertainty. Each CD spends too much time with interviews that be-labour a point.  I think the message could have been conveyed in much less time, and more footage.  However, I got an insight into the events that setup the problem in Chile.  This is something I did not have before.  Excellent in general.",1306713600,4,638,4.456896551724138
3918961,5,B002EOVWVQ,"I ordered this DVD as a birthday present for our daughter in law.

3918962,5,B002EOVWVQ,"When the socialist Salvador Allende was elected President of Chile, a country with a long tradition of free elections, the reactionary elements used a variety of tactics to ruin the country's economy, including closing factories and hoarding food. The workers, who elected Allende, showed up for work and began to manage the factories and distribute food. In the meantime, the Chilean armed forces, under the tutelage of the United States military under Richard Nixon, planned a coup to remove Allende.
On September 11, 1973, the Chilean air force bombed the national palace and the army fired on it, completely destroying the building and killing Allende.
This thorough documentary by Patricio Guzman, banned in Chile until 1997, tells this story and the aftermath, when Augusto Pinochet, the military dictator, began herding up suspected leftists, killed them and buried them in unmarked graves. They were known as ""the disappeared"".
Why were Fidel, Che and the Sandinistas right? Because they all believed that the US would never permit a socialist elected in a free election to hold power.",1282262400,45,1093,5.251428571428572

8368079,5,B002EOVWVQ,"This 4 disc set is an amazing history of the U.S. coup of the democratically elected socialist government of Salvador Allende (the 1st '9/11' in 1973) in Chile.  It's a near continuous year-long record by the filmmaker of the events leading up the the coup with on the ground interviews giving all sides of the events, but with (as the maker admits) a pro-Allende bias.  It helps make clear the crucial role the CIA played in the destabilization of Chile's economy by covertly supporting those disrupting the economy with food & finance so that the majority of of population would suffer while they didn't (Nixon to CIA:  ""Make the economy scream"").  It also shows the heroic grassroots mobilization and determination of the people to support Allende and the socialist revolution (it also serves as a teaching template to understand the same tactics currently being applied to Venezuela, and previously Argentina & Brazil). The last disk is a 'retrospective' from a few years later (still some time ago) which contains some very moving scenes as those who survived recall the past and those who were too young come to grips with the reality of the coup that had been 'erased' from their history by the Pinochet dictatorship.  Although the soundtrack is entirely in Spanish, the English subtitles are above average in readability and, to my limited ability to discern, accurate & complete (happily, pause & rewind allow the viewer to backtrack if the subtitles move too fast - they keep up with the rapid pace of Chilean Spanish). In all, this is a masterpiece of historical documentary film-making and, IMO, essential to understanding the U.S.-promoted, fascist coup of Latin America's first elected socialist government and the death of President Salvador Allende  Presente!",1469404800,2,1775,5.082474226804123
8368080,5,B002EOVWVQ,"Very intense, old school documentary. Chile in the 70's and the military coup. It's very long, and not edited like a hollywood movie. It's simply a very authentic documentation of many events that happened at that time.",1467072000,,219,4.945945945945946

8368082,4,B002EOVWVQ,"""La Battalla de Chile"" is listed no. 19 on BFI's ""Sight and Sound Magazine"" poll of Greatest Documentaries. The images and interviews are fascinating and precise. The situation detailed (the internal political strife fomented in Chile following the election of Salvador Allende which led to a coup d'tat in September 1973) remaings harrowing over 40 years after the unfolding of the events. Despite the pessimistic outcome and the inevitable shock of knowing that many activists seen in the film were imprisoned and tortured or killed under Pinochet's dictatorship, Guzmn highlights the organizational strength of his people, their fearlessness, and their heroic dedication to justice.",1437091200,2,685,5.596153846153846

8368084,5,B002EOVWVQ,Incredibly well done.  This documentary takes you back the tragic events the led to the coup overthrowing the first democratically elected Socialist president in the Americas.  Witness how the poor organized themselves in defense of their president and how the CIA and their business partners in the country orchestrated the coup.,1393286400,,330,5.450980392156863
8368085,5,B002EOVWVQ,"Missed by many reviewers are the facts revealed in the documentary that the Allende government and its Marxist backers never had the support of the majority (the congressional elections gave 56% to the opposition),that the Allende government and the Marxist were confiscating private property (often illegally), that the Marxists were threatening violent revolution and the execution (and even castration) of the ""mummies"" (the majority opposition), that the Marxists were gathering weapons, and that chaos were permeating the nation.  This documentary is brilliant, not for its chest beating for a Marxist revolution (with typical leftist rants about the ""people,"" who presumably did not include the majority who disagreed), but because, despite itself, it underscores just how hollow the whole Marxist weltanschauung was and is.  Especially amusing are the constant attacks on the United States.  When has it not been true in history that strong nations pursue their own  best interests in weaker nations, as the Soviet Union did in Cuba, Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria etc and Russia is doing in Syria?

Ridiculously naive and even silly in its archaic ""gotta revolution"" language and slant, this is still a great documentary.  It makes clear that even in the most democratic of societies the producers will defend themselves by any means ultimately necessary against a ""the working class""  that would take as their own what others have earned",1386547200,,1446,5.4
8368086,5,B002EOVWVQ,This four CD set takes a lot of time but it is time well spent if you want to understand Chile before the Pinochet Coup. My wife and I watched it before going to Chile with a group led by a professor who was in Chile on 9/11/73 the day Allende died. Watching this beforehand really helped us understand more about what happened and gave us an understanding and insights into the people of Chile and their class distinctions.,1383523200,2,424,4.379746835443038
