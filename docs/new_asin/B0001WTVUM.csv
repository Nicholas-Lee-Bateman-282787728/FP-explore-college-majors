8283021,2,B0001WTVUM,This video could be so much better if they just showed the bloopers.  It is filled with so many stupid and pathetic skits that I ended up fast-forwarding through most of the DVD.  When is someone just going to make a plain BLOOPERS video?,1192320000,3,238,4.386363636363637
8283022,5,B0001WTVUM,"I have no idea what the reviewer below is rambling about, but trust me: I've bought many blooper DVDs and most of them are garbage. This is a 2-DVD set, and while some of the content isn't great by any means, the BCI sets are THE BEST blooper compilations on DVD for the money. There are some hilarious *moments* here, some great montages, to go along with the filler. The bottom line is you're getting 2 DVDs with some redundant content, but you won't find a better bargain for the money -- or better bloopers on any other compilation. Hands down the best if you're a blooper buff :)",1101945600,4,584,4.36697247706422
