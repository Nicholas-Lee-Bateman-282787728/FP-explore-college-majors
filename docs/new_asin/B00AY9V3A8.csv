5528249,3,B00AY9V3A8,"""Real Vikings Collection""
(History Channel, 2013)
3.5 stars

This DVD gathers three separate short productions about Viking culture and history, each aimed at a generally younger audience. The first video, narrated by TV actor Richard Karn from ""Home Improvements,"" aims the lowest, with a joking, flippant tone that I guess is meant to appeal to kids who the producers thought wouldn't pay attention unless you dumbed it down enough. I didn't care much for the presentation, but there's still good information presented, so I suppose it might be a good angle to reach some kids.

A lot of the same information is presented in the other two features - the second one is a pretty straightforward, Nova-esque documentary, with a general overview of the Viking role in Norse society and European history, with an emphasis on their organizational and technological skills. The third program is hosted by an ex-Marine who explores the Viking's military prowess, generally with an awestuck, gee-whiz, tough-guy tone. Again, not an approach that resonates with me, but I can see how the more macho-oriented viewers could get into it, and there was some good information here as well, though it also repeats a lot of the information in the other two programs. Overall, I'd say this is a good package, and a decent way to get a basic introduction to Viking history. The first show kind of talks down to kids, but the other two are pretty solid. Worth checking out. (DJ Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain childrens' media reviews)",1364256000,7,1512,4.996031746031746
5528250,5,B00AY9V3A8,This is a pretty good dvd on the vikings. There is some pretty good information on there warfare tactics and day to day life. It also clears up some myths about them.,1364256000,,166,4.21875
5528251,3,B00AY9V3A8,"There are three featurettes included on this DVD.  The first one is just miserable (1 star).  The next two are good (4 stars each).  Thus, the 3 star rating.

The first 45 minute feature is ""Food Soldiers: The Vikings"".  It was made in 1998, and the host is Richard Karn, who was from the TV show Home Improvement.  The presentation is very basic, full of supposed jokes (which were never funny), used the same stock footage over and over again.  The film made it very clear that Vikings never used horned helmets, but the stock footage and drawings they used to illustrate their points almost always had Vikings in horned helmets.  The whole thing was treated as one big joke.  If you buy the DVD, you can safely skip this one.

The second 45 minute feature is ""The Vikings: Lost Worlds"", where archaeologists and historians try to reconstruct some of the buildings, fortifications, ships, etc., of the Vikings based on discovered evidence.  They traveled to several good museums and sites and gave a comprehensive overview of a lot of the Viking building materials, construction, and craftsmanship.

The third 45 minute feature is an episode of Warriors entitled ""Viking Terror"".  The former Green Beret hosts the show, and he explored the different weapons and fighting techniques and strategy and tactics that the Vikings employed.  He interviews some well-known and respected experts in the field, and gives it a go with using the weapons and tactics himself.  Strangely, he completely ignores Viking archery, but his coverage of axes, daneaxes, throwing axes, spears, helmets, and naval combat were full of energy and information.",1363910400,42,1636,5.007407407407407

5528258,1,B00AY9V3A8,I am an avid collector of history documentaries and this three show set is terrible. They basically took three really bad documentaries and put them on one dvd. I could not sit through any of the episodes.,1412467200,,205,4.5675675675675675

5528260,5,B00AY9V3A8,"This is another very good trilogy of Viking documentaries.  My hands-down favorite is the Viking episode from the show ""Warriors"" (listed on the box as ""Foot Soldiers:  Viking Terror"") with Terry Schappert.",1405900800,,206,5.40625
5528261,3,B00AY9V3A8,"Lacked a lot!  I was disappointed in the content of the video.  It had some interesting info on it but, I was hoping for more.",1398643200,,126,4.0
5528262,3,B00AY9V3A8,"The first of 3 features is hosted is Richard Karn, who was from the TV show Home Improvement. The presentation is very basic, full of supposed jokes (which were never funny), and used the same stock footage over and over again. The film made it very clear that Vikings never used horned helmets, but the stock footage and drawings they used to illustrate their points almost always had Vikings in horned helmets. The whole thing was treated as one big joke. If you buy the DVD, you can safely skip this one.

Of the other 2, the second feature does well with the historical view of what Viking life and history was like and is all about..The 3rd deals with a current special forces veteran expressing his views about what Viking militant life was about but is very limited in scope and not extremely useful in getting down to brass tacks about the actual historical militant life with Vikings.

I don't recommend this as advertised and would not purchase it again knowing what it offers.",1398470400,2,987,4.634285714285714
5528263,1,B00AY9V3A8,"Poor production value and very juvenile delivery of information. I was very disappointed in this series from the History Channel. Missed it when it was on TV and thought it would be much better from having viewed previous programs. About the only real information given out in this program was that the Vikings did not have horns on their helmets.
Hate to say it, but if this was given out as Free it would be too much cost. Absolutely worthless.",1389312000,3,446,4.5875
5528264,3,B00AY9V3A8,"I read every article I can find on Viking culture, history and architecture, etc.  I find the Viking time period and the Scandinavian people of that time simply a fascinating.  I have actually been able to legally buy a few authentic Viking relics, so understand I'm trying to be fair in my rating of this DVD.  I am afraid this review is going to sound like a rant and a Richard Karn bash - I don't mean it that way, but beware!  I wanted to like it - I really did, but I just couldn't.  It was the first segment that completely turned me off; it infuriated me.  I know it shouldn't have but it did.  In fact even though I watched it alone my face was burning.  Less than five minutes into the first segment I was already regretting having bought this DVD.  I was hoping for something truly documentary in nature.  Instead, we get a buffoon for a narrator and a bunch of goofy sound effects and on top of that you see a bunch of idiots dressed up like ""Vikings"" in obnoxiously fake battle scenes.  One reviewer hit the nail on the head, when he likened these particular Viking scenes to the Key Stone Kops (or Cops, as you prefer) dressed up like Vikings.  Okay, I liked Richard Karn in ""Home Improvement,"" but he was utterly terrible in the narration of the first segment.  I got so sick of hearing his bad jokes, and the sound effects were annoying, tedious, and stupid.  Concerning the first segment; OMG, it's horrible  The other two segments are pretty good actually and you can learn something of the Vikings, their motivations and their conquests in those last two segments, nothing not previously in print or on another documentary but still good information and presented well. I originally gave the DVD a 2 star rating overall because while the last two segments weren't too bad they could not overcome the absurdity of the first segment.  I have reconsidered and up'd the rating to a 3 star.  The last two segments deserve a 4 or 5 star rating.  Perhaps the first segment might be more appropriate for pre-scholars to maybe elementary age school children who have had no other education on the Vikings.",1373068800,20,2114,4.518421052631579
5528265,4,B00AY9V3A8,"While I'm a fan of Richard Karn, I really wish he hadn't done ""The Foot Soldiers."" It's just silly. And unless you've never even heard of the Vikings, you probably won't learn much.
The other two in the series are better. And while they're not really packed with new info, they are informative enough for the average person wanting to find out about the real Vikings.",1371772800,,367,4.575757575757576
5528266,1,B00AY9V3A8,if you are 5 or 6 years old this DVD might be for you. A comic book on the subject would probably give you time better spent,1370649600,3,124,3.6296296296296298
5528267,1,B00AY9V3A8,"So sorry I wasted my money, while a documentary doesn't need to be stuffy to be informative, this was ridiculously infantile.",1370390400,4,125,5.0
5528268,4,B00AY9V3A8,"It's like getting three shows on oned DVD. The information is good if your interested in viking history.  For what you get, it is a good deal.",1369353600,,142,4.2592592592592595
5528269,2,B00AY9V3A8,Filmed like a key stone cop movie of 1910. Poorly done and comical acting. I had wished the history channel would have actually given a complete history. The fictional series Vikings is much more informative and interesting to watch and learn. This is a waste of money. Pure silly.,1367625600,2,281,4.755102040816326
5528270,4,B00AY9V3A8,"I found the 3 videos to be worth owning for sure.  Some are more lighthearted than others - but that's OK - I have found that in the classroom sometimes students remember the humorous details more than the rest.  If it was the ONLY video material I had on Vikings it would not be enough to get a well rounded view perhaps.  But as I have several others as well as quite a bit of literature about them, I found it was well worth the purchase price.",1367625600,,447,4.114942528735632
5528271,4,B00AY9V3A8,"I think we can all agree: Vikings are cool. However, most people may not really know the truth behind the infamous warrior culture. For example, they didn't wear winged or horned helmets as we so often see in popular culture. This History Channel DVD special gives an in-depth look at the real Vikings and their history in three separate specials. Each one is aimed at uncovering the history, myths, tactics, and other facts about them. The parts include: Foot Soldiers: The Vikings, narrated by Richard Karn (of Home Improvement and Family Feud fame), The Vikings: Lost Worlds, and Viking Terror, which is narrated by Green Beret Terry Schappert. Each part is equally eye opening and interesting in uncovering the many skills, conquests, and lifestyle of the Vikings. The Foot Soldiers segment stood out to me the most, which is perhaps the most family-friendly of the bunch, with sometimes goofy animations and music tracks (even a Viking-theme rap!), but even so it provides excellent facts and information. I have always been interested in the Vikings, and this documentary did an excellent job of separating fact from fiction, and painting a pretty graphic picture of how these people lived (and fought).
