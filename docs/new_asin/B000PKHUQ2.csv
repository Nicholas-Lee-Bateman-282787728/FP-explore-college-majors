8192101,3,B000PKHUQ2,"this was a pretty decent volume episode. I love the time attacks segment but, the rest was garbage.

I wish they put up more info about the cars.",1373846400,,145,4.178571428571429
8192102,5,B000PKHUQ2,"Very cool coverage of the Tsukuba super lap. It is not dubbed in English but I would not like it as much if it was. The cast and crew are very funny and the cars are awsome. The HKS evo, STIs, R34s, etc are all here. I highly recommend it(along with any Video Option volume) to any fan of JDM cars or just awsome driving.",1221436800,,321,3.953846153846154
