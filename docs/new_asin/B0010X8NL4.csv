3053201,4,B0010X8NL4,"I admit it, I'm not a big fan of anime and the sheer stupidity of alot of the One Piece shows have completely annoyed me.  However my 11 year old son loves this series and he's watched this movie atleast once a day since it arrived.  He has however also told me that it's not a seperate movie but rather several episodes that aired on Cartoon Network.  So if you're look.  Even pointed out that it's not continuous but is broken up by what he calls 'paintings'.  I'm guessing that these paintings would be where each episode ended that aired on television.

In short, if you or your kids are a big fan of the series and want to watch the episodes in succession then by all means pick up a copy but if you're just curious and want to see what all the fuss is about then save yourself the money and watch it on Saturday nights on Cartoon Network.",1204848000,,844,4.211180124223603
3053202,5,B0010X8NL4,"Courtesy of Funimation, we have here a retelling of the Alabasta story arc of the TV series, all boiled down to 90 minutes. As something that carries with it even some of the negative connotations of a ""remake"", it shouldn't even come close to the quality of the original telling. But you know what? It succeeds. It really, really does.

This movie was obviously produced with One Piece fans in mind. A lot of subtext, details and explanations are left out (such as why certain people can transform into animals or what exactly ""The Grand Line"" or ""Baroque Works"" are) but the story itself is logically and dramatically preserved. The first 20 minutes or so feel a little rushed as it sets everything up for the big confrontation that dominates most of the movie, throwing facts and names and everything that you NEED to know to understand what's going on. If you're new to One Piece you'll still be able to follow along, and once the action really gets going you'll be following along without a hitch - in fact, you may find yourself caught up with all of the character's struggles.

The best part about the whole movie is that the emotions and the energy that makes One Piece so special is fully at work here. Its not just a run of the mill B-plot servicing the action, most of which is presented with a lot of energy and flair. Admittedly, the story IS pretty basic but it still manages to entertain and engross without having to try too hard. As a bonus, the horrendous 4Kids dub version of the TV series doesn't even cast a shadow here - Funimation's new dub cast performs exceedingly well in delivering most of their lines, giving the drama the appropriate drama and the comedy a nice zing.

Definitely recommended for One Piece fans and to anyone who wants to get a small taste of what One Piece can really offer. For parents: language is generally PG13 and the action doesn't get overly violent, but there is a decent amount of blood seen flying around the screen.",1204675200,,1972,4.564971751412429
3053203,2,B0010X8NL4,"I would not recommend this movie unless you were a Shonen Jump subscriber and followed the ""One Piece"" series.  Too much is left unexplained to immediately jump into this world.

The plot basically follows Luffy, the ""straw hat"" pirate and his band of theives helping Vivi, the Albasta princess. Vivi is trying to stop some nefarious plot by Crocodile, a rival pirate, from inciting a war in her kingdom.

What was so confusing about this movie was that the viewer is immediately thrown into this conflict w/o knowing who the good/bad guys are and what their abilities are. You sort of figure out that much later in the movie that each of the characters have special abilities. i.e. Luffy has some sort of power that makes his body elastic like Reed from Fanstasic Four, and that he has aspirations of becoming the Pirate king. Why they are helping the princess, or what the princess was doing w/ Luffy is not revealed, nor do they explain all the strange super powers. Even seeing walking ducks that look like yellow rubber bath toy ducks running around like horses was extremely strange.

I happen to have Shonen Jump March 2008, which contains Ch:4-6, which contains pre-stories of Luffy's band in Albasta in a plotless trend. Getting the dancing disguises for the women in their group, meeting Luffy's brother (which we learn he and Luffy ate some sort of devil fruit to get powers), and running from the Navy.  Since the American version of the One Piece Manga is still in the early phases, if you watch the movie, it would probably spoil it for those that follow the english version of the manga.  The dvd draws a conclusion to the save the kindgom plot line.

On a technical note, I'm not sure if it will stay like thise in the official release, but the opening credits are still in Japanese and haven't been translated yet. The digital art greatly resembles the manga art work. It's too bad the main character, Luffy, is drawn more attractively, but that's how the manga was drawn.

The quality of the anime was very crisp and clear w/ nice colors. I really the the occasional still pictures that looked like painted pictures interspursed throughout the movie.

Other than the basic setup for subtitles and the various trailers, there didn't seem to be any extras included on the dvd. It would have been nice to have a brief profile or any history on the manga and its characters.",1204675200,2,2388,4.68019093078759
3053204,5,B0010X8NL4,"One Piece has remained one of the most popular shonen mangas in memory. The characters are colorful, the environments are rich, and the fights are varied with whacked-out styles and unique enemies. The series has remained one of the most entertaining shonen animes, for young and old fans alike.

Of course, most who are already familiar with the series are cognizant of this. The real question to be asked is whether or not this anime has recieved a proper treatment from its current U.S. dubber (Funimation), and if this ""recap"" movie is worth the buying. In my opinion, the answer is yes!

It has been many years since the initial One Piece storyline had us visiting the Kingdom of Alabasta. Within this DVD we get to re-experience the story arc within a single movie. All of the dramatic parts, all of the serious undertones, all of the intricate fights, and all of the light-hearted humor are shown, one after the other. Those who haven't really paid much attention to the series in a long while, but can still faintly recall the memories of the Straw Hat Crew's clash with Crocodile, will enjoy a nice buzz of nostalgia while watching this movie. It even had some sort of inner-child-invoking magic to it, the type that can make old adults feel young again.

More importantly, Funimation does a good job of dubbing and packaging this material for western audiences. 4Kid's butchery is now nothing but a distant nightmare, a faded imprint in time never to materialize again. Sanji smokes cigarettes (instead of 4Kid's lolipops), Zoro bleeds during his fight scenes, and all the adult-oriented double entendres remain as originally written. The English voice actors also do a good job within the dub, though I would still recommend the original Japanese audio to anyone.

Overall, this is a fine addition to any One Piece fan's collection. It provides a very enjoyable, fast-paced recap of an entire story arc, which will be pleasent for new and old fans alike of any age.",1204675200,,1976,4.837278106508876
3053205,4,B0010X8NL4,"At long last, One Piece is being brought to America the way it should be, and this movie is the first step to Funimation's successful distribution of the series.

Fans of One Piece who have read the manga or watched fansubs online were very displeased when 4Kids Entertainment gained the license and made several edits to the anime. Blood, swearing, strong plot points and character traits were traded in for cheesy voice acting, a poor script, digitized water and cork guns, and boring fights. The final story arc that 4Kids aired was the beloved Alabasta arc. And this is what this movie is all about.

Pirate Captain Monkey D. Luffy and his crew are escorting Nefeltari Vivi, princess of the desert Alabasta Kingdom, to her home to fight off a rebellion upon her kingdom that was induced by the sinister Crocodile, a cruel-hearted pirate who now serves as protector of the Alabastan citizens, and his small group of conspirators, Baroque Works. Luffy and his crew must now fight to stop a civil war that will destroy the entire country.

All of the One Piece movies before this have been stand-alone stories that happen between certain arcs. This is the 8th One Piece movie made, and it is an hour-and-a-half long retelling of the Alabasta arc. Funimation probably released this one first as it precedes the current episodes they show on Cartoon Network.

The pros of this movie include:
-First and foremost, the new voice cast is vastly improved. Gone are the cheesy accents and lousy acting. The acting quality of the Funimation cast will please you. Not all the new voices are perfect, though. Luffy's voice still sounds strained, but the tone and acting are much better, and Chopper sounds a bit more girly than the previous actress. However, after hearing the Japanese cast so much, I can say that the new cast match each of the characters' personalities almost perfectly.
-Second, the animation is stunning. This is no Miyazaki film, but it takes advantage of a bigger budget and longer deadline to deliver fast action, shiny landscapes, and more detailed character movement.
-Third, the story is still enticing. Despite the fact that several scenes are cut out of the movie from the original story, the melodramatic heroes -vs-villains adventure that made One Piece popular still stands here. You will despise the villain and root for the heroes.
-Forth, the script. This is important to me since I appreciate the hard work of script writers. The script is accurate to the original Japanese dialog and NOT a lame, pun-filled excuse for anime.

The only real con to this film is that several parts of the original story are not put into the film. The entire town sequence where Luffy and crew meet Portgaz D. Ace is gone, the involvement of Capt. Smoker and Tashigi is gone, and the entire Rainbase infiltration and escape sequence is omitted. Fans will probably be disappointed to hear the the battles between the Straw Hat crew and the Number Officers are cut down to the last half of each battle. Also, the second encounter between Luffy and Crocodile where Luffy uses a large barrel of water to fight is omitted. Perhaps the most disappointing omission is that since Smoker and  Tashigi are not in this picture, the message of true, personal justice; a staple point of the arc, is gone.

It is, indeed, a shame that such interesting plot points and character scenes are removed in order to fit the entire arc into an hour-and-a-half. However, despite the omissions, this release is also to show that Funimation has taken One Piece into its capable hands. They will begin to release the episodes in the end of May, uncut and unedited. Until then, this release will have to satisfy us. It is a fun and adventurous movie that can be enjoyed if you don't mind the some of the story omissions.

I should also note that the only extras are the original Japanese audio with subtitles and a handful of trailers for other Funimation releases.

Overall, One Piece- The Desert Princess and the Pirates: Adventures in Alabasta is a great way to bring in the series to America in all its fun, adventurous glory. I await more.",1204416000,,4125,4.790436005625879
3053206,5,B0010X8NL4,"After buying several of the Fox 4 Kids DVD versions of the ""One Piece"" series, I was close to giving up on ever seeing a U.S. release of the show, with both the Japanese AND English soundtracks, and without the EDITED video (where they added 'water guns' and changed parts of some storylines). It had reached a point were I ended up purchasing DVDs with only the Japanese soundtrack, with really bad English translations. However, now Funimation have STARTED to release ""One Piece"" with BOTH Japanese and English soundtracks (Sanji no longer sounds like he has a stuffed nose!), and with the ORIGINAL video/story intact!!! (I say 'started' because the DVD says that the TV series will be released UNCUT starting MAY 2008!!!) I've waited so long for this. While some people may look at this series as just a 'kid's show,' it isn't. It's entertainment for ADULTS as well as children! It's funny. It's heartwarming. It's inspirational. Now, hopefully, people will understand why it's celebrating it's tenth anniversary in Japan!",1203379200,6,1025,5.0

I just saw this movie today with my friends. I've been a fan of One Piece for a good while. I've yet to read the manga, but I plant to read it some day. This movie has everything you could want: action, comedy, drama, intense battles. I don't need to go into the plot since it's mentioned above. The voice cast is outstanding, and it's cool to see it all uncut (I've mainly seen it on tv). If you love One Piece, you'll love this.

3053220,4,B0010X8NL4,"I got this as a gift for Christmas and just now had the time to watch it.

And as a One Piece fan, I can say this was enjoyable to watch. It wasn't like the anime to the exact like everyone says, there are more animated bits in the movie not shown in the Alabasta Arc. And had little funny bits in it that weren't in the anime. Like a scene or two with Sanji *giggle*

I would give this movie 5 stars, because the DVD was nice and the picture was good as well as the quality. And I was glad they didn't just take random scenes from the anime and collaborated them into a mess of a movie. The animators actually took time to make a movie with different animated scenes in it

The only reason I give this 4 stars was under 1 reason
1) most people can watch this after seeing Alabasta, yet has some SPOILER (without warning) in the ENIES LOBBY Arc. Robin referred to her past, not revealed until around ep. 250+ while this movie's anime episodes ended around episode 139/140.
So I recommend watching this after watching or reading Water 7/Enies Lobby. Because it is a big part they added to Robin's past. (It's a small part to the movie, a huge freaken part to Robin and her past)

I've seen Water 7/Enies Lobby, so I know what happened, just a warning for people out there who haven't! XD",1464566400,,1286,4.215447154471545

3053244,2,B0010X8NL4,"Just a rehash of the Alabasta arc in One Piece with slight changes. With some dialog changes, an extra Nico Robin scene (she has a flashback before stowing away on the Going Merry),  and strategies for enemies and allies throw out the window this movie is unnecessary for fans who have read/watched the arc. For newbies,  this is not in any way a replacement for the arc as it leaves out key moments such as Ace/ Smoker appearances and most of the charcter development during the fights while managing to spoil Robin's past.

3053279,5,B0010X8NL4,"Some might say that this movie is just recapping the Alabasta arc and that you shouldn't watch it. The first part is true but you should definately watch it. I don't mind that it's just taking the whole arc and squeezing them into a 90 minute movie. It's One Piece. It's a great movie and it also brings back memories of that arc. If you are a true One Piece fan than you should absolutely check this movie out. Funimation does an excellent job at dubbing One Piece and I'm glad that they acquired it after 4kids because 4kids totally ruined it. I just hope that they acquire the other 7 movies before this one.

Now for some strengths and weaknesses. Strengths: The story is great and the animation is beautiful. There are plenty of action scenes and scenes that warm your heart. The music is top notch and catchy. The movie comes with the japanese audio if you don't like the english voices. And it's also pretty cheap to buy nowadays. Weaknesses: The movie might feel a little bit rushed and skip a couple of important scenes. There's not that much in ways of special features besides trailers.

In all, you should get this movie and add it to your One Piece collection.",1348790400,3,1173,4.4766355140186915
3053280,1,B0010X8NL4,"One Piece is my favourite anime, and I think this story arc is great.

I give this movie 1 star because it is a cheap cop out. If we're watching the 8th One Piece movie then odds are that we've seen the anime and the Alabasta story arc which happens relatively earlier on.

Alabasta isn't even the longest story arc, so why re edit it into this rushed movie?

In the story arc (Episodes 92 - 130) we are given are much more in depth backgrounds about the characters. We see Vivi as she grows with her kingdom, the people who make the kingdom and so forth. It establishes an importance of the kingdom and actually makes you feel for the characters. The film cuts all of that and just gets to the fighting. It's like an abridged youtube version let alone an actual film.

Many memorable moments are cut short as well, Usopp ""trying to get into the mindset of crocodile"" is reduced. Zorro learning to cut steal is almost gone. I swear Luffy escaping the sandtrap is also gone. He just randomly shows up on a bird in this version.

In the arc I liked the bit where Nami asks Usopp to manufacture weapons. They realise their weaknesses, it adds depth to the characters.

Well there's my two cents. The story arc is much much better and it has so many tense moments. This film does not.",1345852800,5,1280,4.334728033472803

3053316,4,B0010X8NL4,"When it comes to animated films, especially for a long running manga and anime series, they're typically stand-alone and filled with mindless action and simple plot.  But with the eighth ""ONE PIECE"" film titled ""THE DESERT PRINCESS AND THE PIRATES - Adventures in Alabasta"", the film focuses on intense battles and dramatic sequences that make this one of the better ""ONE PIECE"" films in years.

The film starts off with the Straw Hat Pirates in the sea, they discover an object or person who needs help and eventually they save the person.

The person happens to be Mr. 2 Bon Clay, a transvestite and a member of Sir Crocodile's organization, Baroque Works.  He has the ability to change to anyone he touches (face and whole body).  He takes all their identities (when demonstrating his abilities) and eventually leaves the group.  This causes great concern to Vivi as she notices that one of the people he changed to was her father and must mean that there is trouble
in Alabasta.

This leads the whole crew to Vivi's desert homeland in which she finds out that Alabasta is in turmoil with a civil war ongoing (courtesy of Crocodile's evil plans).  As the crew, investigate the desert area, Vivi learns from one of her father's assistants that a civil war has turned the country upside down and that Crocodile was using Mr. 2 Bon Clay to impersonate her father with his evil plans.  Thus, the crew are now off to stop Crocodile.

Unbeknownst to the pirates, Crocodile and his gang have been observing them.  This leads to the first battle between Crocodile and Luffy which looks as if Luffy has been killed.

With the Straw Hat Pirates in mourning, they want nothing but to revenge their fallen leader and get their revenge against Crocodile and his gang.  Meanwhile, Vivi tries to think of a way to stop this civil war and bring peace back to Alabasta.

The film is a retelling of episodes 93-130.  So, when you try to condense 37 episodes into a 90 minute film, there are a lot of things that you lose.  But this has been numerous times with plenty of anime series and it's either win or lose depending on the viewer.  But also if there is anything new introduced in the film.

If anything ""THE DESERT PRINCESS AND THE PIRATES - Adventures in Alabasta"" focuses on action sequences and a few dramatic situations from the story arc but the biggest difference is production quality.  Animated films are usually better than their television counterparts and on Blu-ray, this film just looks beautiful.

VIDEO AND AUDIO:

The picture quality of ""THE DESERT PRINCESS AND THE PIRATES - Adventures in Alabasta"" is absolute beautiful.  Many scenes use the amber and blues but most of all, since this film is quite recent (2008), the animation is quite vibrant in colors via  1080p High Definition.

As for audio quality, both English and Japanese dialogue tracks are in Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  This is very important because many animated films on Blu-ray would feature only the English dub track in Dolby TrueHD and the Japanese track in 2.0 stereo.  So, it was great to watch both films in Japanese and English and I was impressed by the FUNimation dub work as opposed to what was on television several years ago.

I definitely enjoyed the use of special effects in the rear channels for this film.  With this film full of action, I'm glad the speaker channels were well utilized.

Also, for those who don't have Dolby TrueHD receivers, you can watch the film in Dolby Digital 2.0 as well.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features but the FUNimation trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

The eighth ""ONE PIECE MOVIE 8: THE DESERT PRINCESS AND THE PIRATES - Adventures in Alabasta"" film features a significant part from the Alabasta storyline from the television series because it introduces several characters such as Nico Robin and Mr. 2 Bon Clay who have a major part to play in animated series of ""ONE PIECE"" and also, it features a major member of the Straw Hat Pirate gang leaving the group.

Unlike many animated films based on a manga or anime series which are storylines simply not-related to the series and sometimes non-canon, one can see ""THE DESERT PRINCESS AND THE PIRATES - Adventures in Alabasta"" as an abridged Alabasta storyline which was part of the anime.

Whereas the anime television series, of course, had 37 episodes dedicated to the Alabasta storyline, you lose a lot of the plot but yet, the film manages to focus on the overall theme of ""ONE PIECE"" which is friendship, loyalty, sacrifice and all out battles.

But because the film is a condensed version of so many episodes, there are hardcore fans who are going to be upset by the fact that an awesome storyline can't be condensed for a 90 minute film but then you have the other side of the fandom who is used to seeing anime films done this way and looking forward to any new footage or anything special that the film can bring.

Of course, with it being a film, the production values are much better.  But is it worth watching if you already invested in the television series?  If you are a hardcore fan, you're probably going to buy it anyway to make sure your collection is not missing any film and if you never watched ""ONE PIECE"" ever, then you're going to be treated to a film that is full of action, cool characters and hard hitting battles.

""THE DESERT PRINCESS AND THE PIRATES - Adventures in Alabasta"" is more of an ode to those who enjoyed the Alabasta storyline and then giving them something new and fun to enjoy. And for those who have never seen ""ONE PIECE"" but have a mild familiarity of its characters, certain parts may not make sense to the viewer but overall, the film becomes an action anime film about friendship and loyalty and can still be enjoyed it on its own.  It's not that difficult to follow.

Again, it's great to have a ""ONE PIECE"" film make its way to Blu-ray, the picture quality brings out the colors of this film and the audio quality has good use of special effects on both front and rear speakers.  I wish there were some sort of special features even if it was just the trailer for the film or a textless ending theme in Japanese and English.

Overall, ""ONE PIECE MOVIE 8: THE DESERT PRINCESS AND THE PIRATES - Adventures in Alabasta"" is a fun, action-packed film and one of the lower priced anime films out there.  Check it out!",1236470400,,6339,4.635631154879141

3053319,2,B0010X8NL4,"The One Piece series is quite famous in Japan.  I'm not a huge anime fan, but I saw some of the earlier films in Japan on television, and I found them enjoyable, if a bit hard to follow.

This film, unfortunately, has none of that enjoyment.  The story seems to have been edited, because it is even more scattered than normal. It's also unwise to start a series with the eighth film. All series develop their own internal code and back stories that won't make any sense to anyone picking up the film for the first time. Most folks won't stop to read the Wikipedia article first, but it would definitely help if you did.

The main characters in the film are the band of the Straw Hat Pirates, headed by their often air-headed leader (Called a ""boke"" in Japanese comedic slang), Monkey Luffy. Monkey is driven by two things in life, his stomach, and his desire to become the pirate king. You can read about the rest of the crew in Wikipedia, but lets just suffice it to say that they are a unique group of teens and young adults, with a token adult android or zombie or two thrown in for good measure.

In this story, the Straw Pirates journey to the island of Alabasta, which is undergoing a civil war. There is a popular figure, Sir Crocodile, who is leading the revolt to overthrow the government and seize power for himself. It is up to the crew to journey to the capital, defeat Crocodile, and return the throne to the rightful heir, Nefertari Vivi, the desert queen. The entire time the country is under attack from a subversive criminal group, the Baroque Works, who like to blow things up.

The story is not the best in the series, and it lacks cohesion in the Japanese version, but this edit and translation only makes it worse. One can only hope that future films, if they are released by Funimation, will be better managed and edited, perhaps with a bit more background information for those who are new to the series.",1227139200,,1927,4.4602272727272725
3053350,3,B0010X8NL4,"For the record, anyone who hasn't seen the goofy pirate anime ""One Piece"" won't have the slightest idea what is going on.

For my part, it took the mighty power of Wikipedia to understand ""One Piece - The Desert Princess and the Pirates."" But once I had the slightest idea who these people were, I found this particular movie to be an entertaining, fluffy little action anime, with plenty of wild powers and overwhelmingly elastic bodies.

After an encounter with a shapeshifting transvestite assassin (I am not making this up), our heroes realize that Vivi's desert homeland of Alabasta is in trouble. Her father King Cobra is being framed for stealing rain by the villainous Crocodile, a power-hungry psychopath who can turn his body into sand. Now a rebel army (run by Vivi's childhood sweetheart) is about to invade the capital city.

So of course our heroes rush in to help, but are stopped along the way by various superpowered Baroque gang of Crocodile's. Vivi desperately charges through the city, hoping to somehow stop the war -- but Crocodile is holding her father hostage, and is ready to destroy the entire city. Can Luffy's rubbery body somehow defeat a man whose body isn't solid enough to strike?

""One Piece - The Desert Princess and the Pirates"" is your basic save-the-locals adventure story, with lots of one-on-one fighting and fantastically violent villains. Each of our heroes has at least one strange, uberpowerful person to defeat, and Luffy dominates the movie with a smash-down battle with Crocodile. Those coinciding climaxes are really quite impressive.

Bespite lots of blood and serious injuries, the bendy-looking characters and ceaseless comic relief don't really let up, such as Nami fueling a giant crab with her cleavage. The movie is at its best when it focuses on comedy and action, but it falters someone when it trots out the friendship-love-peace stuff. Admirable, but it doesn't really gel until late in the movie.

And it's worth noting that since this is a ""middle of the series"" story, several plot threads are left dangling -- we never find out about the Pluton, Robin's nebulous backstory, or how this motley crew came together. Don't start watching this first.

Despite that, the characters are pretty likable -- they bicker, they squabble, and generally prove to be pleasant people despite the fact that only Vivi gets any development. Luffy in particular proves to be an enjoyable hero, with more guts than brain, a rough gluttonous disposition, and a dogged insistence on continuing to fight no matter what the odds.

""One Piece - The Desert Princess and the Pirates"" is not the place to start with this series, but it's an enjoyable fantasy-adventure with lots of sandstorms, crazy fighting and wonky heroes.",1226016000,,2759,4.995642701525054
3053351,4,B0010X8NL4,"Having only a limited knowledge of the series One Piece (seeing only an episode in a local anime cable channel), I experienced confusion on the opening scenes of this One Piece movie. I was wondering what the Japanese characters are for and when I looked up the movie in other websites, I found out that it is essential a collected version of a particular story arc in the One Piece series. It would've been a good idea except the editing leaves much to be desired since the scenes are so disjointed, you'll won't help but notice the seams. Anyway, it's a testament to One Piece that despite those faults (in the opening at that) the charm, energy and quirkiness (two anthromorphic animals as crew members how about that?) of the characters more than make up for it. Now I understand after Naruto, One Piece is the next most popular anime (where I live at least), despite the animation is not as detailed as Naruto. The plot of the movie, while predictable, has enough going for it in terms of action and characters that makes it an enjoyable watch. I'm now hooked to One Piece!",1220227200,,1078,4.561855670103093
3053352,2,B0010X8NL4,"I wasn't familiar with the One Piece story so it was confusing for a while.  Luffy, the rubberband-like leader of the Straw Hat Pirates (a small bunch, indeed), is helping the Princess Vivi to rescue her kingdom from a rival pirate named Crocodile (which apparently was explained in #7).  Crocodile has fomented a civil war somehow by manipulating the king and making the citizens believe they need to attack the king's forces.

I'm not a big fan of anime, but I tried very hard to watch this with an open mind.  I've seen my kids watching Pokemon, but the animation in One Piece seems even cheaper and lower quality.  Scenes where the only action is a single character's mouth twitching while everything else remains static or where background patterns are repeated are common and even lengthy.  The story was a little better, but even then it follows the exact same pattern over and over again: you think the good guy is dead but revives at the last moment to win a battle against overwhelming odds.  Plus, a couple of subplots are left hanging, such as marking their arms so as not to be deceived by a shape-shifting cross-dresser villain.  Even my teenage son, who draws anime-like pictures all the time, grew bored with it and quit watching after 15 minutes.

Parents should know that this is rated PG-13 for violence and sexual situations, although the sexual situations amount to one character flashing another.  There is a bit of foul language, as well.  My biggest complaint is the violence.  We're not talking Buggs Bunny dropping an anvil on Elmer Fudd's head, but rather bone-crunching and blood spattering violence.  It's a little disturbing to see characters who are continually shown with blood running in streams down their faces, but I guess hard-core anime fans will still be pleased with the show.",1215648000,,1816,4.8381877022653725
3053353,2,B0010X8NL4,"Not coming from a background of Manga or Japanese anime, The Movie: One Piece - The Desert Princess, was my baptism into this interesting form of media.
I wasn't totally disappointed with the movie, but I can't say it would be my first choice of entertainment.

The action was fast and cut quickly from scene to scene.  The characters were a little flat. (Although, I haven't had much experience with One Piece...) So, I'm sure looking back on earlier works would give some insight.

I was very much reminded on many video role playing games I've experienced.  The characters moved from place to place... Got into fights...  And moved on...

The story was mostly driven by revenge and the redemption of a people under ruthless tyranny.  If you can wade through the shallow characterizations and manic action you might just find a glimmer of inspiration in the story-line.",1213833600,,871,4.844594594594595
3053354,5,B0010X8NL4,"Having watched this movie in full yesterday, I kept asking myself whether or not I was dreaming. I ask myself that because I am in absolute shock over how well-done the dub for this movie is.

Now, for those of you who don't know, the anime series known as ""One Piece"" was formerly dubbed by a company called 4Kids Entertainment. In Japan, ""One Piece"" is aimed at the mid-to-late teen demographic, but 4Kids decided to turn it into something, well...for kids. And by kids, I mean the ages 4-6 demographic, and there are even moments in the edited version of the show where even that demographic seems too old for the material put on screen.

But that's overwith now. If you want to know more about the horrendous editing that 4Kids did to ""One Piece,"" there are plenty of other places you can find out. It's time to move on and acknowledge how it stands now that it has been acquired by another company called FUNimation. As far as English dubs go, this is quite possibly one of the best I've ever seen, if not THE best.

If you want proof, turn on the subtitles for the Japanese version whilst listening to the English dub--they're identical almost all of the time, and when they're not, they've only been adjusted for technical reasons (i.e. fitting the ""lip flaps"" of the animation) and have virtually the same meaning as the original lines. And that's just the script. The animation is completley uncut, the original (and beautiful) orchestral score is retained, the names are correctly-translated...and to top it all off, it's almost perfectly-acted...as it should be--it was revealed after FUNimation cast their voice actors that Eichiro Oda, the creator of ""One Piece,"" personally approved all of them before they were cast.

Having said that, my only complaint with this movie is that it may not be the best movie to introduce people to ""One Piece"" with or to convert ""One Piece"" haters who dislike the anime based on having seen the horrendously-edited 4Kids version. I say this because this movie is basically a summarized version of a story arc in the TV series that took up many, many episodes. Here, that huge arc has basically been summarized to fit about an hour and thirty minutes. So, some important story moments from the TV-version were not included to save time, and those who aren't already familiar with the characters might be put off by how there's absolutley no backstory explaining their histories or their powers. In essence, this one might be for fans only.

Having said that, if you're looking to introduce someone to ""One Piece,"" I would definitley reccomend ""First Voyage,"" the recent uncut DVD box set released by FUNimation containing the first set of episodes, which recieve the same excellent treatment that this movie does. *After* that, this movie will make a lot more sense to first-timers.

Still, I'm having a hard time thinking of bad things to say about this movie, especially the dub. I never thought an anime would be dubbed this well. I still think I'm dreaming.",1211846400,,3007,4.795366795366795

I watched this movie from the One Piece series without ever having watched or even hearing of One Piece. I didn't know any of the characters, but they were fleshed out enough that I liked them from the start. It wasn't hard to figure out what was going on in the movie. I didn't need to know a ton of back story for it to make sense. If this movie was made to get new viewers interested in the One Piece series, then they did a good job. As soon as I finished watching it, I added the first DVD from the series to the top of my rental queue. I was surprised how much I liked it. All the characters in Luffy's band of pirates were cool making me want to know more about them. The movie had a sense of humor, some goofiness, and a lot of fighting.

Note: The movie was pretty violent. I wouldn't recommend it for viewers under age 13.",1208131200,,917,4.038461538461538

It is a *GOOD* thing that Amazon.com notes in the title that this is the 8th movie created for One Piece *beyond* the numerous manga and anime TV episodes. Thus, this is *not* a good starting point to begin with this series.

That being said, the characters remain both heartwarming and humorous. The emphasis on the friendship and loyalty among the protagonists maintains the sense of strong relationships among the characters. The fight scenes were a bit too drawn out, though given the medium and the source material, this is perhaps to be expected. It would have been nice, though, if a bit more exposition had been included as to who the characters were, though fans of the series should likely already know the backgrounds and motivations.

I give this anime film 3 stars. If it had been a bit more friendly toward new viewers, I'd likely have given it 4.",1208044800,,981,4.6

As other reviewers have said-this film is somewhat confusing for the first time One Piece viewer. The film is made with the assumption that you've seen OP before and are up to date on the storyline. That didn't affect our viewing enjoyment too much-but it did make several scenes a bit ""over the top"" comedy-wise as we may have not ""gotten"" what they were trying to say.

As a fan of comics and fantasy, I did enjoy the Super Power aspect of the story-though some of the fight scene violence may be a bit much for younger viewers. I have an eleven year old son and watched this without him, knowing that some anime can be ""adult"".  After viewing this, I'd let him watch this as you won't see more violence or adult humor than in your average PG film. As to the sexual situations-it's pretty much ""innuendo"" of the slapstick variety and fairly harmless.

While not on par with some anime greats on my list-like Miyazaki's works or another favorite-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tokyo-Godfathers/dp/B0001EFTVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tokyo Godfathers</a>, One Piece was just wacky and sentimentally heartfelt enough to recommend to fans of the series.

The movie was interesting because even when you thought the main character was down for the count he came out the winner. The video didn't really talk about the characters much and it progressed to quickly. But I think since it isn't the only video with those characters they didn't need to but they still should have for people who aren't familiar with it.
I recommend this to people who already have seen some One Piece but people who aren't familiar with it should probably watch the first movie or a different thing altogether. But for people who like anime, One Piece, and a good villain I recommend this to you.",1206316800,,775,4.243243243243243
3053391,1,B0010X8NL4,"I consider myself quite the fan of Japanese anime and manga, and while I have my favorites and my not-so-favorites, I've never found one I truly hated...

until now.  Everything about this rubs me the wrong way.

First I find Eiichiro Oda's artwork ugly.  From what I can tell the animators appear to have reproduced it accurately; unfortunately I simply find it repulsive.

Second, this movie, which is a condensed remake of several TV episodes, cannot truly stand on its own.  A newcomer to the story like myself can eventually figure out much of what is going on, but the story has been so compressed as to squeeze out most of the character development.  The characters keep telling us and showing us how much they are willing to do for their friends, but we really have no idea why.  The villains' motives make a lot more sense.

Third, one could be forgiven for assuming that the only purpose of this movie is to justify staging a bunch of super power and magic assisted martial arts duels between the good guys and the bad guys, all of which follow EXACTLY the same pattern: good guy gets beaten to a pulp but at the last possible moment summons the superhuman will to overcome impossible odds and win because his friends are depending on him (yawn).

Fourth, I found the wildly ridiculous swings from angst-ridden drama to slapstick comedy and back again more than annoying.  Of course I'm aware this is common in Japanese anime and manga, including even in many of my favorites, but I've never seen it overdone this badly.

This is supposed to be one of the most popular anime and manga serials in Japan, and for the life of me I cannot imagine why.

Unusual creatures and powers (apparently often the result of mysterious devil-fruit) abound in this adventure tale that is actually an edit of a story arc from the Anime TV series with new footage added.

""One Piece: The Desert Princess and the Pirates: Adventures in Alabasta"" is the 8th One Piece movie, so perhaps it shouldn't be surprising to find that the newcomer will not have much of a clue what is going on. It's not that hard to follow once you get into it, aside from a few confusing plot points that may be the result of flawed editing, but the problem is that you'll have no clue about these characters or the world in which they live if you aren't already familiar with it. I still don't know what was up with the weird animal creatures or the full spectrum of superpowers held by the cast, and no back story is given except for some moments pertaining to the princess and her story. However, I suppose the One Piece fan would get a lot more out of the experience. It is well paced with some interesting visuals and funny moments, though on the whole the art is weak. Of course, it does have a couple examples of my favorite aspect of Japanese Anime: Really cute females.

According to the internet websites that track box office sales, this was the number 2 highest grossing picture the weekend it was released, and the 26th highest grossing picture of the year.

This series is popular with younger kids and teens as they also read the One piece comic books. This movie in particular, as I learned through internet searches, is actually a retelling/recap of a series of episodes called the Alabasta chronicles, concerning a young princess named Vivi, a friend to the Straw Hat Pirates, attempting to reclaim her desert kingdom, Alabasta, from an evil pirate named Crocodile. The movie pleased my friend's 10 year old son who is a One Piece series fan. But I did not know the series well the narrative and multitude of characters became confusing for me. I  have liked some anime movies in the past but this one could not hold my attention. I also did not like the graphics although technically the movie is sound.

I would definitely recommend checking out at least Wikipedia's article on One Piece before watching this as your introduction to the series.  The visual antics alone were enough to keep me engrossed for the entire 90 minutes and I didn't mind the yelling in the least.  From what I've seen it is a convention of the form.

The voice acting in this series falls prey to the usual overly acted comedic expression but this is contained for the most part and the english dub gets in the way less than most anime.  The animation is also standout as little tricks make it vary throughout without losing its tone.  Fans will want this one and newcomers may want to try earlier ONE PIECE out as introductory anime. The original language track is well translated here if you go the subtitle route and the 16.9 presentation is sharp, there will be a collection so holding off might be wise if you can wait but there is really no reason not to keep sailing the animated waters with this band of rogues just yet.",1205971200,,1014,4.75

I had to watch the movie twice to understand what was going on at the beginning of the movie.  Unfortunately, my lack of understanding also affected my enjoyment regarding the rest of the movie.

I think another problem I had with this movie is the improbability of the plot.  I realize that a lot of anime is improbable, but this movie just seemed to leap from one improbability to the next.  Again, my lack of knowledge of the ""One Piece"" world likely affected by judgment, but the plot and the action just seemed too unlikely.

What is the plot?  Well, Princess Vivi needs to rescue the kingdom from an assortment of baddies with the aid of a group of pirates.  While the plot sounds simple, I had a lot of problems understanding who the good guys were and who the bad guys were.  Sometimes the good guys acted like bad guys, and the bad guys seemed like they were good guys.  Watching the movie twice helped a lot.

As with all movies of this type, the good guys lose for most of the movie.  Just when all seems hopeless, miraculous events take place and you know the rest.  I guess I was expecting more.

I do appreciate good anime.  I loved ""Spirited Away"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" among others.  While this movie was okay, it is just not in the same class as other anime I have watched.  I recommend this movie only to fans of the series and those who feel like they must have every pirate movie ever made.  Otherwise, you may pass this mediocre effort by.

This film is way below-average in terms of typical anime fare. There was a great deal of yelling in many scenes, which would most likely annoy adults viewers, and yet the graphic violence almost certainly makes the movie unsuitable for children. It was very rare that the main character did not deliver his lines in a screaming fashion, making the story more difficult to follow than it already was, and there was blood and death aplenty throughout. Normally, blood and death and pirates go hand-in-hand.  But not with screaming child-like characters whose eyes bug out when they're upset/yelling.

The movie contains no character introductions and almost no backstory to speak of.  It does not stand alone.  I wouldn't recommend it to new viewers, and even those familiar with the series may want to skip this one.  Overall, it is a lot of hype for way too high a price.

However as a mom and high school teacher I know there are a lot of hard core anime fans out there especially in the under thirty set so I was curious to watch this movie from the ONE PIECE series.  Like most anime the storyline is complicated and the visuals are innovative and complex.  Unfortunately the dialogue does not always seem to translate well from Japanese and we get stilted/corny phrases like ""He embodies the word fiend like no one else I ever met."" or the quote from the movie I chose for the title of my review.

  Funimation has put in some of their own edits in there, but basically just calling it ""Alabasta"" instead of ""Arabasta."" Thankfully, for the Japanese One Piece fans, they keep the right names of everyone, instead of using the horrible 4kids edits. Zoro is rightly called Zoro instead of Zolo, Miss All-Sunday(Nico Robin) is not changed to Miss Sunday, Miss Merry Christmas is not changed to Miss Groundhogs Day, etc. The whole movie is just a condensed version of this whole arc, and so it leaves out the full battles of the Mugiwara Kaizokudan (Strawhat Pirates), and even add more blood then the original version in some parts. It doesn't have all the information that would make it understandable to anyone.  Even though it doesn't really work as a movie, it can be great for any One Piece fans. For those who have been watching the 4kids dub, it might reveal things that they cut out. Personally, I think the greatest part about it is that you are able to watch it with the original Japanese voices and English subtitles.

Luffy and his crew are helping Princess Vivi try to save Alabasta, which is undergoing a civil war, caused by the evil Crocodile and his minions.

However, both my children really enjoyed this and had no real criticism even when asked. They said it was a bit hard to follow but they recognized that they had no prior knowledge of the series, except for what they've heard of it.

They said it was ""average"".  To me, average is three stars, so that's what I gave it since that's what they'd give it-- and I think it's geared to teenagers.  Had I just been left viewing it, I would have had trouble even giving it an average rating.",1205452800,3,704,4.2706766917293235

Yes, there are plenty of serious messages here, like the value of friendship, devotion to friends and a worthwhile cause, and world peace. But all this is packaged in a very comicbook(yes, I know they're called manga) style. The animation is attractive and a times visually stimulating. There are two available soundtracks: English and the original Japanese, both with available English subtitles(only English--no other languages are available--not even Japanese subtitles). There is quite a difference in the style of the the English and Japanese soundtracks. The Japanese voices are a bit more serious and less comic-like. I believe this was actually their intention.  This is also the kind of anime that throws more characters at you than a Russian novel. By the end of the DVD you might figure out who is who, or after several viewings, if you are so disposed to watching this several times. It helps if you have been a fan of previous editions. But it is never difficult to tell a hero from a villain.

However,as stated above ""One Piece: Movie 8 consists of recut footage from the ""Alabasta"" story arc of the TV series with some bits of additional animation.""

They also recut it such that I don't think anyone not already familiar with the story could follow it.  The Alabasta episodes (92-130)were pretty long so trying to fit thirty eight 20+ minute episodes in to a ""movie"" is quite a task. Still 4Kids or whomever did this completely butchered it.

View the original Alabasta episodes, not this.",1205193600,2,651,4.675438596491228
3053416,4,B0010X8NL4,"I don't know anything about the Manga upon which this is based and have never had the chance to see any of the episodes of the popular television series featuring the characters from One Piece -- but all that really isn't necessary to enjoy the eye-poppingly enthusiastic animation and delightful story of how a mismatched group of super-powered pirates rally behind a desert princess to save her kingdom from the dangerous fiend Crocodile.

I suppose this ought to be classed under the heading of guilty pleasure (for me) since its target audience seems to be teenage boys and girls -- though I understand that manga and anime have a much larger adult audience in Japan than comics and animation have in the US.  The animated women are all voluptuous and not afraid to use their feminine charms to disarm an enemy, and there is lots of blood and violence -- though it is certainly not to the point of being gory or pornographic, the film does ""earn"" its PG-13 rating.  Still, the film remains playful and inventive in its approach, somewhat like Pirates of the Caribbean, and would be hard to describe as offensive (my wife and I saw this together and both of us smiled through it).

While the characters and story are lots of fun, the real delight in this picture is the animation.  It is endlessly inventive, over-the-top, and gorgeously rendered.  The images strike a very nice balance between the lush style of visuals associated with the most artistic of anime productions, such as the work of Hayao Miyazaki, and a cartoonish  and playful style that is closer to Pokemon, with visual jokes and excess that could have been contributed by Mad Magazine enthusiast (here the limits of my knowledge of anime show themselves, since there has to be a better Japanese analogy for the combination of slapstick, adventure, mild sensuality, martial arts and swashbuckling violence and fantasy that is on display here).  It is really quite exciting to watch, since not only the story but the visual style is unpredictable without overwhelming the cohesiveness of the whole.

All I can say is that I wish we had stuff like this when I was a kid -- though I can't say I'm ready to introduce it to my own kids yet.  It's probably better for them to find it on their own when they are no longer taking my suggestions.  If you end up taking my suggestion to check this out, and find yourself or your kids or your parents becoming hooked on the delightful characters and style, and are impatiently waiting for more of the series to make it overseas, don't blame me.",1205193600,8,2554,4.691275167785235

I knew nothing about the characters, but it does not take long before we see these unique and quirky characters in the thick of things. We have to learn who they are as they progress through their wild adventure. You will be lost at first if this is your only exposure to the group as it was for me. We just have to accept that this is an established group that has spent time together. There has to be a first movie or show out there somewhere with introductions and background.

This odd group goes forward with their need to stop a civil war in the Kingdom of Alabasta. An evil powerful pirate called the Crocodile is orchestrating this civil war. The princess of the kingdom is Princess Vivi and she starts off with the help of Monkey D. Luffy and his Straw Hat pirates. Once the movie gets started it has a complete story arc on this adventure. But there are loose ends in the story line that are never tied up. The fight scenes are definitely something to make the animation team proud. I like the kingdoms protectors arc on the difference between fighting and protection and the final song at the closing credits. This film must be made for the teenage to young adult age group. So if you like Japanese Anime melodrama, this may be for you.",1205107200,,1391,4.412451361867705
3053418,3,B0010X8NL4,"For the record, anyone who hasn't seen the goofy pirate anime ""One Piece"" won't have the slightest idea what is going on.

For my part, it took the mighty power of Wikipedia to understand ""One Piece - The Desert Princess and the Pirates."" But once I had the slightest idea who these people were, I found this particular movie to be an entertaining, fluffy little action anime, with plenty of wild powers and overwhelmingly elastic bodies.

After an encounter with a shapeshifting transvestite assassin (I am not making this up), our heroes realize that Vivi's desert homeland of Alabasta is in trouble. Her father King Cobra is being framed for stealing rain by the villainous Crocodile, a power-hungry psychopath who can turn his body into sand. Now a rebel army (run by Vivi's childhood sweetheart) is about to invade the capital city.

So of course our heroes rush in to help, but are stopped along the way by various superpowered Baroque gang of Crocodile's. Vivi desperately charges through the city, hoping to somehow stop the war -- but Crocodile is holding her father hostage, and is ready to destroy the entire city. Can Luffy's rubbery body somehow defeat a man whose body isn't solid enough to strike?

""One Piece - The Desert Princess and the Pirates"" is your basic save-the-locals adventure story, with lots of one-on-one fighting and fantastically violent villains. Each of our heroes has at least one strange, uberpowerful person to defeat, and Luffy dominates the movie with a smash-down battle with Crocodile. Those coinciding climaxes are really quite impressive.

Bespite lots of blood and serious injuries, the bendy-looking characters and ceaseless comic relief don't really let up, such as Nami fueling a giant crab with her cleavage. The movie is at its best when it focuses on comedy and action, but it falters someone when it trots out the friendship-love-peace stuff. Admirable, but it doesn't really gel until late in the movie.

And it's worth noting that since this is a ""middle of the series"" story, several plot threads are left dangling -- we never find out about the Pluton, Robin's nebulous backstory, or how this motley crew came together. Don't start watching this first.

Despite that, the characters are pretty likable -- they bicker, they squabble, and generally prove to be pleasant people despite the fact that only Vivi gets any development. Luffy in particular proves to be an enjoyable hero, with more guts than brain, a rough gluttonous disposition, and a dogged insistence on continuing to fight no matter what the odds.

""One Piece - The Desert Princess and the Pirates"" is not the place to start with this series, but it's an enjoyable fantasy-adventure with lots of sandstorms, crazy fighting and wonky heroes.",1205107200,4,2759,4.995642701525054
3053419,2,B0010X8NL4,"I'll say right up front that I am not a fan of manga, nor have I watched ""One Piece"" before, so I'm coming into this film with that perspective.  I was not impressed, nor was my 12-year-old, who offers this capsule review: ""I think this movie was too busy, made no sense at certain points, and was extremely perverted.  You have to be a huge fan and geek of the comics and show to know what is going on.""  By ""perverted"", I believe he means not only the sexual content, but also the disturbing characters, though to me they were no more bizarre than some of the villains of ""Batman"".  But he's right about it being ""busy"": there is too much going on at too rapid a pace, and the incessant battling and violence got tiresome after a while. It would help to have some backstory to the characters (via the TV series), but even with that advantage, it might get confusing at times.  Part of the problem, too, is that the patching together of TV episodes into a movie makes for a rather choppy narrative.  I can appreciate that there was a certain level of creativity in the story line and the creation of some unique characters, but the pace and the violence level could be a turn-off for a first-time viewer like me.  I assume that fans of this kind of animation appreciate it for what it is, but it goes without saying that it's not Hayao Miyazaki (the director of such classics as ""Spirited Away"") any more than Hanna-Barbera is Walt Disney.  I would recommend it only to fans of the TV series, as it did nothing to turn me - or my son -  on to the genre.",1205020800,,1554,4.294520547945205

He has however also told me that it's not a seperate movie but rather several episodes that aired on Cartoon Network.  So if you're look.  Even pointed out that it's not continuous but is broken up by what he calls 'paintings'.  I'm guessing that these paintings would be where each episode ended that aired on television.

In short, if you or your kids are a big fan of the series and want to watch the episodes in succession then by all means pick up a copy but if you're just curious and want to see what all the fuss is about then save yourself the money and watch it on Saturday nights on Cartoon Network.",1204848000,,844,4.211180124223603
3287699,5,B0010X8NL4,"Courtesy of Funimation, we have here a retelling of the Alabasta story arc of the TV series, all boiled down to 90 minutes. As something that carries with it even some of the negative connotations of a ""remake"", it shouldn't even come close to the quality of the original telling. But you know what? It succeeds. It really, really does.

This movie was obviously produced with One Piece fans in mind. A lot of subtext, details and explanations are left out (such as why certain people can transform into animals or what exactly ""The Grand Line"" or ""Baroque Works"" are) but the story itself is logically and dramatically preserved. The first 20 minutes or so feel a little rushed as it sets everything up for the big confrontation that dominates most of the movie, throwing facts and names and everything that you NEED to know to understand what's going on. If you're new to One Piece you'll still be able to follow along, and once the action really gets going you'll be following along without a hitch - in fact, you may find yourself caught up with all of the character's struggles.

The best part about the whole movie is that the emotions and the energy that makes One Piece so special is fully at work here. Its not just a run of the mill B-plot servicing the action, most of which is presented with a lot of energy and flair. Admittedly, the story IS pretty basic but it still manages to entertain and engross without having to try too hard. As a bonus, the horrendous 4Kids dub version of the TV series doesn't even cast a shadow here - Funimation's new dub cast performs exceedingly well in delivering most of their lines, giving the drama the appropriate drama and the comedy a nice zing.

Definitely recommended for One Piece fans and to anyone who wants to get a small taste of what One Piece can really offer. For parents: language is generally PG13 and the action doesn't get overly violent, but there is a decent amount of blood seen flying around the screen.",1204675200,,1972,4.564971751412429
3287700,2,B0010X8NL4,"I would not recommend this movie unless you were a Shonen Jump subscriber and followed the ""One Piece"" series.  Too much is left unexplained to immediately jump into this world.

The plot basically follows Luffy, the ""straw hat"" pirate and his band of theives helping Vivi, the Albasta princess. Vivi is trying to stop some nefarious plot by Crocodile, a rival pirate, from inciting a war in her kingdom.

What was so confusing about this movie was that the viewer is immediately thrown into this conflict w/o knowing who the good/bad guys are and what their abilities are. You sort of figure out that much later in the movie that each of the characters have special abilities. i.e. Luffy has some sort of power that makes his body elastic like Reed from Fanstasic Four, and that he has aspirations of becoming the Pirate king. Why they are helping the princess, or what the princess was doing w/ Luffy is not revealed, nor do they explain all the strange super powers. Even seeing walking ducks that look like yellow rubber bath toy ducks running around like horses was extremely strange.

I happen to have Shonen Jump March 2008, which contains Ch:4-6, which contains pre-stories of Luffy's band in Albasta in a plotless trend. Getting the dancing disguises for the women in their group, meeting Luffy's brother (which we learn he and Luffy ate some sort of devil fruit to get powers), and running from the Navy.  Since the American version of the One Piece Manga is still in the early phases, if you watch the movie, it would probably spoil it for those that follow the english version of the manga.  The dvd draws a conclusion to the save the kindgom plot line.

On a technical note, I'm not sure if it will stay like thise in the official release, but the opening credits are still in Japanese and haven't been translated yet. The digital art greatly resembles the manga art work. It's too bad the main character, Luffy, is drawn more attractively, but that's how the manga was drawn.

The quality of the anime was very crisp and clear w/ nice colors. I really the the occasional still pictures that looked like painted pictures interspursed throughout the movie.

Other than the basic setup for subtitles and the various trailers, there didn't seem to be any extras included on the dvd. It would have been nice to have a brief profile or any history on the manga and its characters.",1204675200,2,2388,4.68019093078759
3287701,5,B0010X8NL4,"One Piece has remained one of the most popular shonen mangas in memory. The characters are colorful, the environments are rich, and the fights are varied with whacked-out styles and unique enemies. The series has remained one of the most entertaining shonen animes, for young and old fans alike.

Of course, most who are already familiar with the series are cognizant of this. The real question to be asked is whether or not this anime has recieved a proper treatment from its current U.S. dubber (Funimation), and if this ""recap"" movie is worth the buying. In my opinion, the answer is yes!

It has been many years since the initial One Piece storyline had us visiting the Kingdom of Alabasta. Within this DVD we get to re-experience the story arc within a single movie. All of the dramatic parts, all of the serious undertones, all of the intricate fights, and all of the light-hearted humor are shown, one after the other. Those who haven't really paid much attention to the series in a long while, but can still faintly recall the memories of the Straw Hat Crew's clash with Crocodile, will enjoy a nice buzz of nostalgia while watching this movie. It even had some sort of inner-child-invoking magic to it, the type that can make old adults feel young again.

More importantly, Funimation does a good job of dubbing and packaging this material for western audiences. 4Kid's butchery is now nothing but a distant nightmare, a faded imprint in time never to materialize again. Sanji smokes cigarettes (instead of 4Kid's lolipops), Zoro bleeds during his fight scenes, and all the adult-oriented double entendres remain as originally written. The English voice actors also do a good job within the dub, though I would still recommend the original Japanese audio to anyone.

Overall, this is a fine addition to any One Piece fan's collection. It provides a very enjoyable, fast-paced recap of an entire story arc, which will be pleasent for new and old fans alike of any age.",1204675200,,1976,4.837278106508876
3287702,4,B0010X8NL4,"At long last, One Piece is being brought to America the way it should be, and this movie is the first step to Funimation's successful distribution of the series.

Fans of One Piece who have read the manga or watched fansubs online were very displeased when 4Kids Entertainment gained the license and made several edits to the anime. Blood, swearing, strong plot points and character traits were traded in for cheesy voice acting, a poor script, digitized water and cork guns, and boring fights. The final story arc that 4Kids aired was the beloved Alabasta arc. And this is what this movie is all about.

Pirate Captain Monkey D. Luffy and his crew are escorting Nefeltari Vivi, princess of the desert Alabasta Kingdom, to her home to fight off a rebellion upon her kingdom that was induced by the sinister Crocodile, a cruel-hearted pirate who now serves as protector of the Alabastan citizens, and his small group of conspirators, Baroque Works. Luffy and his crew must now fight to stop a civil war that will destroy the entire country.

All of the One Piece movies before this have been stand-alone stories that happen between certain arcs. This is the 8th One Piece movie made, and it is an hour-and-a-half long retelling of the Alabasta arc. Funimation probably released this one first as it precedes the current episodes they show on Cartoon Network.

The pros of this movie include:
-First and foremost, the new voice cast is vastly improved. Gone are the cheesy accents and lousy acting. The acting quality of the Funimation cast will please you. Not all the new voices are perfect, though. Luffy's voice still sounds strained, but the tone and acting are much better, and Chopper sounds a bit more girly than the previous actress. However, after hearing the Japanese cast so much, I can say that the new cast match each of the characters' personalities almost perfectly.
-Second, the animation is stunning. This is no Miyazaki film, but it takes advantage of a bigger budget and longer deadline to deliver fast action, shiny landscapes, and more detailed character movement.
-Third, the story is still enticing. Despite the fact that several scenes are cut out of the movie from the original story, the melodramatic heroes -vs-villains adventure that made One Piece popular still stands here. You will despise the villain and root for the heroes.
-Forth, the script. This is important to me since I appreciate the hard work of script writers. The script is accurate to the original Japanese dialog and NOT a lame, pun-filled excuse for anime.

The only real con to this film is that several parts of the original story are not put into the film. The entire town sequence where Luffy and crew meet Portgaz D. Ace is gone, the involvement of Capt. Smoker and Tashigi is gone, and the entire Rainbase infiltration and escape sequence is omitted. Fans will probably be disappointed to hear the the battles between the Straw Hat crew and the Number Officers are cut down to the last half of each battle. Also, the second encounter between Luffy and Crocodile where Luffy uses a large barrel of water to fight is omitted. Perhaps the most disappointing omission is that since Smoker and  Tashigi are not in this picture, the message of true, personal justice; a staple point of the arc, is gone.

It is, indeed, a shame that such interesting plot points and character scenes are removed in order to fit the entire arc into an hour-and-a-half. However, despite the omissions, this release is also to show that Funimation has taken One Piece into its capable hands. They will begin to release the episodes in the end of May, uncut and unedited. Until then, this release will have to satisfy us. It is a fun and adventurous movie that can be enjoyed if you don't mind the some of the story omissions.

I should also note that the only extras are the original Japanese audio with subtitles and a handful of trailers for other Funimation releases.

Overall, One Piece- The Desert Princess and the Pirates: Adventures in Alabasta is a great way to bring in the series to America in all its fun, adventurous glory. I await more.",1204416000,,4125,4.790436005625879

And as a One Piece fan, I can say this was enjoyable to watch. It wasn't like the anime to the exact like everyone says, there are more animated bits in the movie not shown in the Alabasta Arc. And had little funny bits in it that weren't in the anime. Like a scene or two with Sanji *giggle*

I would give this movie 5 stars, because the DVD was nice and the picture was good as well as the quality. And I was glad they didn't just take random scenes from the anime and collaborated them into a mess of a movie. The animators actually took time to make a movie with different animated scenes in it

The only reason I give this 4 stars was under 1 reason
1) most people can watch this after seeing Alabasta, yet has some SPOILER (without warning) in the ENIES LOBBY Arc. Robin referred to her past, not revealed until around ep. 250+ while this movie's anime episodes ended around episode 139/140.
So I recommend watching this after watching or reading Water 7/Enies Lobby. Because it is a big part they added to Robin's past. (It's a small part to the movie, a huge freaken part to Robin and her past)

With some dialog changes, an extra Nico Robin scene (she has a flashback before stowing away on the Going Merry),  and strategies for enemies and allies throw out the window this movie is unnecessary for fans who have read/watched the arc. For newbies,  this is not in any way a replacement for the arc as it leaves out key moments such as Ace/ Smoker appearances and most of the charcter development during the fights while managing to spoil Robin's past.

3287776,5,B0010X8NL4,"Some might say that this movie is just recapping the Alabasta arc and that you shouldn't watch it. The first part is true but you should definately watch it. I don't mind that it's just taking the whole arc and squeezing them into a 90 minute movie. It's One Piece. It's a great movie and it also brings back memories of that arc. If you are a true One Piece fan than you should absolutely check this movie out. Funimation does an excellent job at dubbing One Piece and I'm glad that they acquired it after 4kids because 4kids totally ruined it. I just hope that they acquire the other 7 movies before this one.

Now for some strengths and weaknesses. Strengths: The story is great and the animation is beautiful. There are plenty of action scenes and scenes that warm your heart. The music is top notch and catchy. The movie comes with the japanese audio if you don't like the english voices. And it's also pretty cheap to buy nowadays. Weaknesses: The movie might feel a little bit rushed and skip a couple of important scenes. There's not that much in ways of special features besides trailers.

In all, you should get this movie and add it to your One Piece collection.",1348790400,3,1173,4.4766355140186915
3287777,1,B0010X8NL4,"One Piece is my favourite anime, and I think this story arc is great.

I give this movie 1 star because it is a cheap cop out. If we're watching the 8th One Piece movie then odds are that we've seen the anime and the Alabasta story arc which happens relatively earlier on.

Alabasta isn't even the longest story arc, so why re edit it into this rushed movie?

In the story arc (Episodes 92 - 130) we are given are much more in depth backgrounds about the characters. We see Vivi as she grows with her kingdom, the people who make the kingdom and so forth. It establishes an importance of the kingdom and actually makes you feel for the characters. The film cuts all of that and just gets to the fighting. It's like an abridged youtube version let alone an actual film.

Many memorable moments are cut short as well, Usopp ""trying to get into the mindset of crocodile"" is reduced. Zorro learning to cut steal is almost gone. I swear Luffy escaping the sandtrap is also gone. He just randomly shows up on a bird in this version.

In the arc I liked the bit where Nami asks Usopp to manufacture weapons. They realise their weaknesses, it adds depth to the characters.

Well there's my two cents. The story arc is much much better and it has so many tense moments. This film does not.",1345852800,5,1280,4.334728033472803

3287813,4,B0010X8NL4,"When it comes to animated films, especially for a long running manga and anime series, they're typically stand-alone and filled with mindless action and simple plot.  But with the eighth ""ONE PIECE"" film titled ""THE DESERT PRINCESS AND THE PIRATES - Adventures in Alabasta"", the film focuses on intense battles and dramatic sequences that make this one of the better ""ONE PIECE"" films in years.

The film starts off with the Straw Hat Pirates in the sea, they discover an object or person who needs help and eventually they save the person.

The person happens to be Mr. 2 Bon Clay, a transvestite and a member of Sir Crocodile's organization, Baroque Works.  He has the ability to change to anyone he touches (face and whole body).  He takes all their identities (when demonstrating his abilities) and eventually leaves the group.  This causes great concern to Vivi as she notices that one of the people he changed to was her father and must mean that there is trouble
in Alabasta.

This leads the whole crew to Vivi's desert homeland in which she finds out that Alabasta is in turmoil with a civil war ongoing (courtesy of Crocodile's evil plans).  As the crew, investigate the desert area, Vivi learns from one of her father's assistants that a civil war has turned the country upside down and that Crocodile was using Mr. 2 Bon Clay to impersonate her father with his evil plans.  Thus, the crew are now off to stop Crocodile.

Unbeknownst to the pirates, Crocodile and his gang have been observing them.  This leads to the first battle between Crocodile and Luffy which looks as if Luffy has been killed.

With the Straw Hat Pirates in mourning, they want nothing but to revenge their fallen leader and get their revenge against Crocodile and his gang.  Meanwhile, Vivi tries to think of a way to stop this civil war and bring peace back to Alabasta.

The film is a retelling of episodes 93-130.  So, when you try to condense 37 episodes into a 90 minute film, there are a lot of things that you lose.  But this has been numerous times with plenty of anime series and it's either win or lose depending on the viewer.  But also if there is anything new introduced in the film.

If anything ""THE DESERT PRINCESS AND THE PIRATES - Adventures in Alabasta"" focuses on action sequences and a few dramatic situations from the story arc but the biggest difference is production quality.  Animated films are usually better than their television counterparts and on Blu-ray, this film just looks beautiful.

VIDEO AND AUDIO:

The picture quality of ""THE DESERT PRINCESS AND THE PIRATES - Adventures in Alabasta"" is absolute beautiful.  Many scenes use the amber and blues but most of all, since this film is quite recent (2008), the animation is quite vibrant in colors via  1080p High Definition.

As for audio quality, both English and Japanese dialogue tracks are in Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  This is very important because many animated films on Blu-ray would feature only the English dub track in Dolby TrueHD and the Japanese track in 2.0 stereo.  So, it was great to watch both films in Japanese and English and I was impressed by the FUNimation dub work as opposed to what was on television several years ago.

I definitely enjoyed the use of special effects in the rear channels for this film.  With this film full of action, I'm glad the speaker channels were well utilized.

Also, for those who don't have Dolby TrueHD receivers, you can watch the film in Dolby Digital 2.0 as well.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features but the FUNimation trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

The eighth ""ONE PIECE MOVIE 8: THE DESERT PRINCESS AND THE PIRATES - Adventures in Alabasta"" film features a significant part from the Alabasta storyline from the television series because it introduces several characters such as Nico Robin and Mr. 2 Bon Clay who have a major part to play in animated series of ""ONE PIECE"" and also, it features a major member of the Straw Hat Pirate gang leaving the group.

Unlike many animated films based on a manga or anime series which are storylines simply not-related to the series and sometimes non-canon, one can see ""THE DESERT PRINCESS AND THE PIRATES - Adventures in Alabasta"" as an abridged Alabasta storyline which was part of the anime.

Whereas the anime television series, of course, had 37 episodes dedicated to the Alabasta storyline, you lose a lot of the plot but yet, the film manages to focus on the overall theme of ""ONE PIECE"" which is friendship, loyalty, sacrifice and all out battles.

But because the film is a condensed version of so many episodes, there are hardcore fans who are going to be upset by the fact that an awesome storyline can't be condensed for a 90 minute film but then you have the other side of the fandom who is used to seeing anime films done this way and looking forward to any new footage or anything special that the film can bring.

Of course, with it being a film, the production values are much better.  But is it worth watching if you already invested in the television series?  If you are a hardcore fan, you're probably going to buy it anyway to make sure your collection is not missing any film and if you never watched ""ONE PIECE"" ever, then you're going to be treated to a film that is full of action, cool characters and hard hitting battles.

""THE DESERT PRINCESS AND THE PIRATES - Adventures in Alabasta"" is more of an ode to those who enjoyed the Alabasta storyline and then giving them something new and fun to enjoy. And for those who have never seen ""ONE PIECE"" but have a mild familiarity of its characters, certain parts may not make sense to the viewer but overall, the film becomes an action anime film about friendship and loyalty and can still be enjoyed it on its own.  It's not that difficult to follow.

Again, it's great to have a ""ONE PIECE"" film make its way to Blu-ray, the picture quality brings out the colors of this film and the audio quality has good use of special effects on both front and rear speakers.  I wish there were some sort of special features even if it was just the trailer for the film or a textless ending theme in Japanese and English.

Overall, ""ONE PIECE MOVIE 8: THE DESERT PRINCESS AND THE PIRATES - Adventures in Alabasta"" is a fun, action-packed film and one of the lower priced anime films out there.  Check it out!",1236470400,,6339,4.635631154879141

3287816,2,B0010X8NL4,"The One Piece series is quite famous in Japan.  I'm not a huge anime fan, but I saw some of the earlier films in Japan on television, and I found them enjoyable, if a bit hard to follow.

This film, unfortunately, has none of that enjoyment.  The story seems to have been edited, because it is even more scattered than normal. It's also unwise to start a series with the eighth film. All series develop their own internal code and back stories that won't make any sense to anyone picking up the film for the first time. Most folks won't stop to read the Wikipedia article first, but it would definitely help if you did.

The main characters in the film are the band of the Straw Hat Pirates, headed by their often air-headed leader (Called a ""boke"" in Japanese comedic slang), Monkey Luffy. Monkey is driven by two things in life, his stomach, and his desire to become the pirate king. You can read about the rest of the crew in Wikipedia, but lets just suffice it to say that they are a unique group of teens and young adults, with a token adult android or zombie or two thrown in for good measure.

In this story, the Straw Pirates journey to the island of Alabasta, which is undergoing a civil war. There is a popular figure, Sir Crocodile, who is leading the revolt to overthrow the government and seize power for himself. It is up to the crew to journey to the capital, defeat Crocodile, and return the throne to the rightful heir, Nefertari Vivi, the desert queen. The entire time the country is under attack from a subversive criminal group, the Baroque Works, who like to blow things up.

The story is not the best in the series, and it lacks cohesion in the Japanese version, but this edit and translation only makes it worse. One can only hope that future films, if they are released by Funimation, will be better managed and edited, perhaps with a bit more background information for those who are new to the series.",1227139200,,1927,4.4602272727272725
3287847,3,B0010X8NL4,"For the record, anyone who hasn't seen the goofy pirate anime ""One Piece"" won't have the slightest idea what is going on.

For my part, it took the mighty power of Wikipedia to understand ""One Piece - The Desert Princess and the Pirates."" But once I had the slightest idea who these people were, I found this particular movie to be an entertaining, fluffy little action anime, with plenty of wild powers and overwhelmingly elastic bodies.

After an encounter with a shapeshifting transvestite assassin (I am not making this up), our heroes realize that Vivi's desert homeland of Alabasta is in trouble. Her father King Cobra is being framed for stealing rain by the villainous Crocodile, a power-hungry psychopath who can turn his body into sand. Now a rebel army (run by Vivi's childhood sweetheart) is about to invade the capital city.

So of course our heroes rush in to help, but are stopped along the way by various superpowered Baroque gang of Crocodile's. Vivi desperately charges through the city, hoping to somehow stop the war -- but Crocodile is holding her father hostage, and is ready to destroy the entire city. Can Luffy's rubbery body somehow defeat a man whose body isn't solid enough to strike?

""One Piece - The Desert Princess and the Pirates"" is your basic save-the-locals adventure story, with lots of one-on-one fighting and fantastically violent villains. Each of our heroes has at least one strange, uberpowerful person to defeat, and Luffy dominates the movie with a smash-down battle with Crocodile. Those coinciding climaxes are really quite impressive.

Bespite lots of blood and serious injuries, the bendy-looking characters and ceaseless comic relief don't really let up, such as Nami fueling a giant crab with her cleavage. The movie is at its best when it focuses on comedy and action, but it falters someone when it trots out the friendship-love-peace stuff. Admirable, but it doesn't really gel until late in the movie.

And it's worth noting that since this is a ""middle of the series"" story, several plot threads are left dangling -- we never find out about the Pluton, Robin's nebulous backstory, or how this motley crew came together. Don't start watching this first.

Despite that, the characters are pretty likable -- they bicker, they squabble, and generally prove to be pleasant people despite the fact that only Vivi gets any development. Luffy in particular proves to be an enjoyable hero, with more guts than brain, a rough gluttonous disposition, and a dogged insistence on continuing to fight no matter what the odds.

""One Piece - The Desert Princess and the Pirates"" is not the place to start with this series, but it's an enjoyable fantasy-adventure with lots of sandstorms, crazy fighting and wonky heroes.",1226016000,,2759,4.995642701525054
3287848,4,B0010X8NL4,"Having only a limited knowledge of the series One Piece (seeing only an episode in a local anime cable channel), I experienced confusion on the opening scenes of this One Piece movie. I was wondering what the Japanese characters are for and when I looked up the movie in other websites, I found out that it is essential a collected version of a particular story arc in the One Piece series. It would've been a good idea except the editing leaves much to be desired since the scenes are so disjointed, you'll won't help but notice the seams. Anyway, it's a testament to One Piece that despite those faults (in the opening at that) the charm, energy and quirkiness (two anthromorphic animals as crew members how about that?) of the characters more than make up for it. Now I understand after Naruto, One Piece is the next most popular anime (where I live at least), despite the animation is not as detailed as Naruto. The plot of the movie, while predictable, has enough going for it in terms of action and characters that makes it an enjoyable watch. I'm now hooked to One Piece!",1220227200,,1078,4.561855670103093
3287849,2,B0010X8NL4,"I wasn't familiar with the One Piece story so it was confusing for a while.  Luffy, the rubberband-like leader of the Straw Hat Pirates (a small bunch, indeed), is helping the Princess Vivi to rescue her kingdom from a rival pirate named Crocodile (which apparently was explained in #7).  Crocodile has fomented a civil war somehow by manipulating the king and making the citizens believe they need to attack the king's forces.

I'm not a big fan of anime, but I tried very hard to watch this with an open mind.  I've seen my kids watching Pokemon, but the animation in One Piece seems even cheaper and lower quality.  Scenes where the only action is a single character's mouth twitching while everything else remains static or where background patterns are repeated are common and even lengthy.  The story was a little better, but even then it follows the exact same pattern over and over again: you think the good guy is dead but revives at the last moment to win a battle against overwhelming odds.  Plus, a couple of subplots are left hanging, such as marking their arms so as not to be deceived by a shape-shifting cross-dresser villain.  Even my teenage son, who draws anime-like pictures all the time, grew bored with it and quit watching after 15 minutes.

Parents should know that this is rated PG-13 for violence and sexual situations, although the sexual situations amount to one character flashing another.  There is a bit of foul language, as well.  My biggest complaint is the violence.  We're not talking Buggs Bunny dropping an anvil on Elmer Fudd's head, but rather bone-crunching and blood spattering violence.  It's a little disturbing to see characters who are continually shown with blood running in streams down their faces, but I guess hard-core anime fans will still be pleased with the show.",1215648000,,1816,4.8381877022653725
3287850,2,B0010X8NL4,"Not coming from a background of Manga or Japanese anime, The Movie: One Piece - The Desert Princess, was my baptism into this interesting form of media.
I wasn't totally disappointed with the movie, but I can't say it would be my first choice of entertainment.

The action was fast and cut quickly from scene to scene.  The characters were a little flat. (Although, I haven't had much experience with One Piece...) So, I'm sure looking back on earlier works would give some insight.

I was very much reminded on many video role playing games I've experienced.  The characters moved from place to place... Got into fights...  And moved on...

The story was mostly driven by revenge and the redemption of a people under ruthless tyranny.  If you can wade through the shallow characterizations and manic action you might just find a glimmer of inspiration in the story-line.",1213833600,,871,4.844594594594595
3287851,5,B0010X8NL4,"Having watched this movie in full yesterday, I kept asking myself whether or not I was dreaming. I ask myself that because I am in absolute shock over how well-done the dub for this movie is.

Now, for those of you who don't know, the anime series known as ""One Piece"" was formerly dubbed by a company called 4Kids Entertainment. In Japan, ""One Piece"" is aimed at the mid-to-late teen demographic, but 4Kids decided to turn it into something, well...for kids. And by kids, I mean the ages 4-6 demographic, and there are even moments in the edited version of the show where even that demographic seems too old for the material put on screen.

But that's overwith now. If you want to know more about the horrendous editing that 4Kids did to ""One Piece,"" there are plenty of other places you can find out. It's time to move on and acknowledge how it stands now that it has been acquired by another company called FUNimation. As far as English dubs go, this is quite possibly one of the best I've ever seen, if not THE best.

If you want proof, turn on the subtitles for the Japanese version whilst listening to the English dub--they're identical almost all of the time, and when they're not, they've only been adjusted for technical reasons (i.e. fitting the ""lip flaps"" of the animation) and have virtually the same meaning as the original lines. And that's just the script. The animation is completley uncut, the original (and beautiful) orchestral score is retained, the names are correctly-translated...and to top it all off, it's almost perfectly-acted...as it should be--it was revealed after FUNimation cast their voice actors that Eichiro Oda, the creator of ""One Piece,"" personally approved all of them before they were cast.

Having said that, my only complaint with this movie is that it may not be the best movie to introduce people to ""One Piece"" with or to convert ""One Piece"" haters who dislike the anime based on having seen the horrendously-edited 4Kids version. I say this because this movie is basically a summarized version of a story arc in the TV series that took up many, many episodes. Here, that huge arc has basically been summarized to fit about an hour and thirty minutes. So, some important story moments from the TV-version were not included to save time, and those who aren't already familiar with the characters might be put off by how there's absolutley no backstory explaining their histories or their powers. In essence, this one might be for fans only.

Having said that, if you're looking to introduce someone to ""One Piece,"" I would definitley reccomend ""First Voyage,"" the recent uncut DVD box set released by FUNimation containing the first set of episodes, which recieve the same excellent treatment that this movie does. *After* that, this movie will make a lot more sense to first-timers.

Still, I'm having a hard time thinking of bad things to say about this movie, especially the dub. I never thought an anime would be dubbed this well. I still think I'm dreaming.",1211846400,,3007,4.795366795366795

I watched this movie from the One Piece series without ever having watched or even hearing of One Piece. I didn't know any of the characters, but they were fleshed out enough that I liked them from the start. It wasn't hard to figure out what was going on in the movie. I didn't need to know a ton of back story for it to make sense. If this movie was made to get new viewers interested in the One Piece series, then they did a good job. As soon as I finished watching it, I added the first DVD from the series to the top of my rental queue. I was surprised how much I liked it. All the characters in Luffy's band of pirates were cool making me want to know more about them. The movie had a sense of humor, some goofiness, and a lot of fighting.

It is a *GOOD* thing that Amazon.com notes in the title that this is the 8th movie created for One Piece *beyond* the numerous manga and anime TV episodes. Thus, this is *not* a good starting point to begin with this series.

That being said, the characters remain both heartwarming and humorous. The emphasis on the friendship and loyalty among the protagonists maintains the sense of strong relationships among the characters. The fight scenes were a bit too drawn out, though given the medium and the source material, this is perhaps to be expected. It would have been nice, though, if a bit more exposition had been included as to who the characters were, though fans of the series should likely already know the backgrounds and motivations.

As other reviewers have said-this film is somewhat confusing for the first time One Piece viewer. The film is made with the assumption that you've seen OP before and are up to date on the storyline. That didn't affect our viewing enjoyment too much-but it did make several scenes a bit ""over the top"" comedy-wise as we may have not ""gotten"" what they were trying to say.

As a fan of comics and fantasy, I did enjoy the Super Power aspect of the story-though some of the fight scene violence may be a bit much for younger viewers. I have an eleven year old son and watched this without him, knowing that some anime can be ""adult"".  After viewing this, I'd let him watch this as you won't see more violence or adult humor than in your average PG film. As to the sexual situations-it's pretty much ""innuendo"" of the slapstick variety and fairly harmless.

While not on par with some anime greats on my list-like Miyazaki's works or another favorite-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tokyo-Godfathers/dp/B0001EFTVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tokyo Godfathers</a>, One Piece was just wacky and sentimentally heartfelt enough to recommend to fans of the series.

The movie was interesting because even when you thought the main character was down for the count he came out the winner. The video didn't really talk about the characters much and it progressed to quickly. But I think since it isn't the only video with those characters they didn't need to but they still should have for people who aren't familiar with it.
I recommend this to people who already have seen some One Piece but people who aren't familiar with it should probably watch the first movie or a different thing altogether. But for people who like anime, One Piece, and a good villain I recommend this to you.",1206316800,,775,4.243243243243243
3287888,1,B0010X8NL4,"I consider myself quite the fan of Japanese anime and manga, and while I have my favorites and my not-so-favorites, I've never found one I truly hated...

until now.  Everything about this rubs me the wrong way.

First I find Eiichiro Oda's artwork ugly.  From what I can tell the animators appear to have reproduced it accurately; unfortunately I simply find it repulsive.

Second, this movie, which is a condensed remake of several TV episodes, cannot truly stand on its own.  A newcomer to the story like myself can eventually figure out much of what is going on, but the story has been so compressed as to squeeze out most of the character development.  The characters keep telling us and showing us how much they are willing to do for their friends, but we really have no idea why.  The villains' motives make a lot more sense.

Third, one could be forgiven for assuming that the only purpose of this movie is to justify staging a bunch of super power and magic assisted martial arts duels between the good guys and the bad guys, all of which follow EXACTLY the same pattern: good guy gets beaten to a pulp but at the last possible moment summons the superhuman will to overcome impossible odds and win because his friends are depending on him (yawn).

Fourth, I found the wildly ridiculous swings from angst-ridden drama to slapstick comedy and back again more than annoying.  Of course I'm aware this is common in Japanese anime and manga, including even in many of my favorites, but I've never seen it overdone this badly.

This is supposed to be one of the most popular anime and manga serials in Japan, and for the life of me I cannot imagine why.

Luffy and his group of friendly pirates, the Straw Hats, use their strange abilities to assist the beautiful princess Vivi in saving her drought-ridden kingdom from civil war as a result of the scheming pirate-hunter Crocodile and his gang. Unusual creatures and powers (apparently often the result of mysterious devil-fruit) abound in this adventure tale that is actually an edit of a story arc from the Anime TV series with new footage added.

""One Piece: The Desert Princess and the Pirates: Adventures in Alabasta"" is the 8th One Piece movie, so perhaps it shouldn't be surprising to find that the newcomer will not have much of a clue what is going on. It's not that hard to follow once you get into it, aside from a few confusing plot points that may be the result of flawed editing, but the problem is that you'll have no clue about these characters or the world in which they live if you aren't already familiar with it. I still don't know what was up with the weird animal creatures or the full spectrum of superpowers held by the cast, and no back story is given except for some moments pertaining to the princess and her story. However, I suppose the One Piece fan would get a lot more out of the experience. It is well paced with some interesting visuals and funny moments, though on the whole the art is weak. Of course, it does have a couple examples of my favorite aspect of Japanese Anime: Really cute females.

Luffy, who holds aspirations of becoming the king of all pirates. One Piece - The Desert Princess and the Pirates: Adventures in Alabasta is the eighth One Piece movie, which are released yearly in Japan. According to the internet websites that track box office sales, this was the number 2 highest grossing picture the weekend it was released, and the 26th highest grossing picture of the year.

This series is popular with younger kids and teens as they also read the One piece comic books. This movie in particular, as I learned through internet searches, is actually a retelling/recap of a series of episodes called the Alabasta chronicles, concerning a young princess named Vivi, a friend to the Straw Hat Pirates, attempting to reclaim her desert kingdom, Alabasta, from an evil pirate named Crocodile. The movie pleased my friend's 10 year old son who is a One Piece series fan. But I did not know the series well the narrative and multitude of characters became confusing for me. I  have liked some anime movies in the past but this one could not hold my attention. I also did not like the graphics although technically the movie is sound. I think it is targeted at fans who already know the series and have read the comics but it left me bored and still perplexed about the actual storyline.",1205971200,2,1443,4.6328125

This time I had a better understanding of the plot and not having to concentrate so hard on why things were happening, I was able to enjoy it more.  I would definitely recommend checking out at least Wikipedia's article on One Piece before watching this as your introduction to the series.  The visual antics alone were enough to keep me engrossed for the entire 90 minutes and I didn't mind the yelling in the least.  From what I've seen it is a convention of the form.

For one they take hackneyed premises (Princess etc..)and make it their own, the attention to detail in dialogue and storylines is often well thought out with some interesting political undertones and surprising character development.  The voice acting in this series falls prey to the usual overly acted comedic expression but this is contained for the most part and the english dub gets in the way less than most anime.  The animation is also standout as little tricks make it vary throughout without losing its tone.  Fans will want this one and newcomers may want to try earlier ONE PIECE out as introductory anime. The original language track is well translated here if you go the subtitle route and the 16.9 presentation is sharp, there will be a collection so holding off might be wise if you can wait but there is really no reason not to keep sailing the animated waters with this band of rogues just yet.",1205971200,,1014,4.75
3287894,3,B0010X8NL4,"I had problems with this movie almost immediately.  I have never watched any of the ""One Piece"" television episodes, so the story line confused me on the first go round.  I had to watch the movie twice to understand what was going on at the beginning of the movie.  Unfortunately, my lack of understanding also affected my enjoyment regarding the rest of the movie.

I think another problem I had with this movie is the improbability of the plot.  I realize that a lot of anime is improbable, but this movie just seemed to leap from one improbability to the next.  Again, my lack of knowledge of the ""One Piece"" world likely affected by judgment, but the plot and the action just seemed too unlikely.

What is the plot?  Well, Princess Vivi needs to rescue the kingdom from an assortment of baddies with the aid of a group of pirates.  While the plot sounds simple, I had a lot of problems understanding who the good guys were and who the bad guys were.  Sometimes the good guys acted like bad guys, and the bad guys seemed like they were good guys.  Watching the movie twice helped a lot.

As with all movies of this type, the good guys lose for most of the movie.  Just when all seems hopeless, miraculous events take place and you know the rest.  I guess I was expecting more.

I do appreciate good anime.  I loved ""Spirited Away"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" among others.  While this movie was okay, it is just not in the same class as other anime I have watched.  I recommend this movie only to fans of the series and those who feel like they must have every pirate movie ever made.  Otherwise, you may pass this mediocre effort by.

On my second watch I liked it a bit better.  I actually somewhat enjoyed the story although I thought the plot moved illogically at times and I questioned the character motivations.

This film is way below-average in terms of typical anime fare. There was a great deal of yelling in many scenes, which would most likely annoy adults viewers, and yet the graphic violence almost certainly makes the movie unsuitable for children. It was very rare that the main character did not deliver his lines in a screaming fashion, making the story more difficult to follow than it already was, and there was blood and death aplenty throughout. Normally, blood and death and pirates go hand-in-hand.  But not with screaming child-like characters whose eyes bug out when they're upset/yelling.

The movie contains no character introductions and almost no backstory to speak of.  It does not stand alone.  I wouldn't recommend it to new viewers, and even those familiar with the series may want to skip this one.  Overall, it is a lot of hype for way too high a price.

  Funimation has put in some of their own edits in there, but basically just calling it ""Alabasta"" instead of ""Arabasta."" Thankfully, for the Japanese One Piece fans, they keep the right names of everyone, instead of using the horrible 4kids edits. Zoro is rightly called Zoro instead of Zolo, Miss All-Sunday(Nico Robin) is not changed to Miss Sunday, Miss Merry Christmas is not changed to Miss Groundhogs Day, etc. The whole movie is just a condensed version of this whole arc, and so it leaves out the full battles of the Mugiwara Kaizokudan (Strawhat Pirates), and even add more blood then the original version in some parts. It doesn't have all the information that would make it understandable to anyone.  Even though it doesn't really work as a movie, it can be great for any One Piece fans. For those who have been watching the 4kids dub, it might reveal things that they cut out.

Yes, there are plenty of serious messages here, like the value of friendship, devotion to friends and a worthwhile cause, and world peace. But all this is packaged in a very comicbook(yes, I know they're called manga) style. The animation is attractive and a times visually stimulating. There are two available soundtracks: English and the original Japanese, both with available English subtitles(only English--no other languages are available--not even Japanese subtitles). There is quite a difference in the style of the the English and Japanese soundtracks. The Japanese voices are a bit more serious and less comic-like. I believe this was actually their intention.  This is also the kind of anime that throws more characters at you than a Russian novel. By the end of the DVD you might figure out who is who, or after several viewings, if you are so disposed to watching this several times. It helps if you have been a fan of previous editions.

I suppose this ought to be classed under the heading of guilty pleasure (for me) since its target audience seems to be teenage boys and girls -- though I understand that manga and anime have a much larger adult audience in Japan than comics and animation have in the US.  The animated women are all voluptuous and not afraid to use their feminine charms to disarm an enemy, and there is lots of blood and violence -- though it is certainly not to the point of being gory or pornographic, the film does ""earn"" its PG-13 rating.  Still, the film remains playful and inventive in its approach, somewhat like Pirates of the Caribbean, and would be hard to describe as offensive (my wife and I saw this together and both of us smiled through it).

While the characters and story are lots of fun, the real delight in this picture is the animation.  It is endlessly inventive, over-the-top, and gorgeously rendered.  The images strike a very nice balance between the lush style of visuals associated with the most artistic of anime productions, such as the work of Hayao Miyazaki, and a cartoonish  and playful style that is closer to Pokemon, with visual jokes and excess that could have been contributed by Mad Magazine enthusiast (here the limits of my knowledge of anime show themselves, since there has to be a better Japanese analogy for the combination of slapstick, adventure, mild sensuality, martial arts and swashbuckling violence and fantasy that is on display here).  It is really quite exciting to watch, since not only the story but the visual style is unpredictable without overwhelming the cohesiveness of the whole.

All I can say is that I wish we had stuff like this when I was a kid -- though I can't say I'm ready to introduce it to my own kids yet.  It's probably better for them to find it on their own when they are no longer taking my suggestions.

We have to learn who they are as they progress through their wild adventure. You will be lost at first if this is your only exposure to the group as it was for me. We just have to accept that this is an established group that has spent time together. There has to be a first movie or show out there somewhere with introductions and background.

This odd group goes forward with their need to stop a civil war in the Kingdom of Alabasta. An evil powerful pirate called the Crocodile is orchestrating this civil war. The princess of the kingdom is Princess Vivi and she starts off with the help of Monkey D. Luffy and his Straw Hat pirates. Once the movie gets started it has a complete story arc on this adventure. But there are loose ends in the story line that are never tied up. The fight scenes are definitely something to make the animation team proud. I like the kingdoms protectors arc on the difference between fighting and protection and the final song at the closing credits. This film must be made for the teenage to young adult age group.

For my part, it took the mighty power of Wikipedia to understand ""One Piece - The Desert Princess and the Pirates."" But once I had the slightest idea who these people were, I found this particular movie to be an entertaining, fluffy little action anime, with plenty of wild powers and overwhelmingly elastic bodies.

After an encounter with a shapeshifting transvestite assassin (I am not making this up), our heroes realize that Vivi's desert homeland of Alabasta is in trouble. Her father King Cobra is being framed for stealing rain by the villainous Crocodile, a power-hungry psychopath who can turn his body into sand. Now a rebel army (run by Vivi's childhood sweetheart) is about to invade the capital city.

So of course our heroes rush in to help, but are stopped along the way by various superpowered Baroque gang of Crocodile's. Vivi desperately charges through the city, hoping to somehow stop the war -- but Crocodile is holding her father hostage, and is ready to destroy the entire city. Can Luffy's rubbery body somehow defeat a man whose body isn't solid enough to strike?

""One Piece - The Desert Princess and the Pirates"" is your basic save-the-locals adventure story, with lots of one-on-one fighting and fantastically violent villains. Each of our heroes has at least one strange, uberpowerful person to defeat, and Luffy dominates the movie with a smash-down battle with Crocodile. Those coinciding climaxes are really quite impressive.

Bespite lots of blood and serious injuries, the bendy-looking characters and ceaseless comic relief don't really let up, such as Nami fueling a giant crab with her cleavage. The movie is at its best when it focuses on comedy and action, but it falters someone when it trots out the friendship-love-peace stuff. Admirable, but it doesn't really gel until late in the movie.

And it's worth noting that since this is a ""middle of the series"" story, several plot threads are left dangling -- we never find out about the Pluton, Robin's nebulous backstory, or how this motley crew came together. Don't start watching this first.

Despite that, the characters are pretty likable -- they bicker, they squabble, and generally prove to be pleasant people despite the fact that only Vivi gets any development. Luffy in particular proves to be an enjoyable hero, with more guts than brain, a rough gluttonous disposition, and a dogged insistence on continuing to fight no matter what the odds.

""One Piece - The Desert Princess and the Pirates"" is not the place to start with this series, but it's an enjoyable fantasy-adventure with lots of sandstorms, crazy fighting and wonky heroes.",1205107200,4,2759,4.995642701525054

I was not impressed, nor was my 12-year-old, who offers this capsule review: ""I think this movie was too busy, made no sense at certain points, and was extremely perverted.  You have to be a huge fan and geek of the comics and show to know what is going on.""  By ""perverted"", I believe he means not only the sexual content, but also the disturbing characters, though to me they were no more bizarre than some of the villains of ""Batman"".  But he's right about it being ""busy"": there is too much going on at too rapid a pace, and the incessant battling and violence got tiresome after a while. It would help to have some backstory to the characters (via the TV series), but even with that advantage, it might get confusing at times.  Part of the problem, too, is that the patching together of TV episodes into a movie makes for a rather choppy narrative.  I can appreciate that there was a certain level of creativity in the story line and the creation of some unique characters, but the pace and the violence level could be a turn-off for a first-time viewer like me.  I assume that fans of this kind of animation appreciate it for what it is, but it goes without saying that it's not Hayao Miyazaki (the director of such classics as ""Spirited Away"") any more than Hanna-Barbera is Walt Disney.

8238998,1,B0010X8NL4,do not buy this it is a waste of time if you have even spent one second enjoying the series.  it is literally just a recap snap show of allabasta if i spelled that right it is only a collection buy at best!,1501718400,,206,3.7906976744186047
8238999,2,B0010X8NL4,This whole movie is just a montage collection 5. It plays a little bit of each episode starting with the arrival to Alabaster and ending with their departure.,1494892800,,158,4.678571428571429
8239000,3,B0010X8NL4,"This movie is......... eh . Cramming the entire arc into 90 minutes made a lot of parts skipped or just downright rushed. But hey, seeing certain moments with better animation and in movie quality is entertaining enough. I'm curious if people who hadn't seen the Alabasta Arc will dislike it due to how rushed it was.",1494460800,,317,4.678571428571429

8239003,4,B0010X8NL4,"Love the animation. I'm glad I saw this storyline again and with a few small changes from the tv series. Personally, I prefer the way the story is told through the tv anime because the movie is so condensed, but I have no regrets and am glad I own this still.",1488585600,,259,4.098039215686274
