5124770,5,B0083QJV6M,"Many people were hoping to for someone to bring back the series, and thanks to Funimation, we are able to get that.

As for me, I just started watching it not to long ago, so I was unware that that it's as already dub by pioneer already then pick up by Funimation releasing the Viridain Set, and now they are picking up the series.

As for the packaging. I though it was going to come in a tin Container or The cardboard one that was used for many other box sets (Panty and Stocking with Gaterbelt, Fractale, Okami-san, Princess Jellyfish) But I was wrong. It comes with a Paper cover then you case inside, so you can either keep it for throw it away and have the Case by itself.

The case, unlike the ones I had listed is now bigger so instead of 2 Blu ray cause it now one big case contain all the Blu ray and Dvd realse of the series. 4 Dvds that are in Red covers. 3 Blus disk that are in Black covers. So you can tell the difference
between the 2.

No, Cause I do not own a Blu ray, I cannot rate or say what it looks like, so maybe, check with the other 2 or the one 1 review that says it's blurry, but the Dvd release it just good.

As Always from Funimation, they come with English Dub (Geonen Dub Not the new cast by Funimation Which will be feature on Season 2 of Shakugan no Shana) And English Subitile along with the Japanese audio that many fans prefer to watch rather then the dub.

Extras include some shorts called Naze Nani Shana 1-8 Shana-Tan 1 & 2 and Textless songs and trailers.

If you haven't had these in your Viridian Collection or Geonen Collection then I would suggest buying this, but the choice is up to you, cause the cast is the same, you might want to stick with you collection already.
Otherwise, I'm truly happy with this purchase. Can wait for the season series which on Funimation schudle is coming out next month.",1345852800,4,1850,4.194366197183099
5124771,3,B0083QJV6M,"I recently purchased this set because of a good overall star rating and didn't read all of the reviews... shame on me.  Please make sure that the reviewers actually purchased the product (like myself) and don't get suckered into 5 star 'hype' non-reviews.

This is a great series and a good English dub, but I agree with the other user's review that the Blu-Rays are blurry and that the DVD version looks better.  I have checked both versions (Blu-Ray and DVD) in PowerDVD and the other user is right: the Blu-Ray version is such a bad standard definition up-convert (blurry, soft, bright) that the DVDs look a lot better.

I wouldn't mind buying this series on DVD if it were only released on DVD, but I feel like I've been cheated on the Blu-Rays.  If you're still interested in checking out this series, it's definitely worthwhile, but beware of the poor Blu-Ray quality.",1345680000,14,874,4.686274509803922
5124772,3,B0083QJV6M,"Shakugan no Shana is a great series and an all time favorite for many people. Great story, memorable characters, everything you need.

The FUNimation re-release comes in a thick Blu-Ray case, with 4 DVDs containing episodes 1-24 (The OVA episode is NOT included!) and 3 Blu-Rays. The DVDs are alright, however the Blu-Ray version is not true HD this time, it is just a bad upscale. People who wish to own the Blu-Ray version, please note that it has almost every error that can occur during upscaling:

-video noise
-posterization
-color banding
-motion artifacts
-the colors look bland and washed

Even if you own an LCD TV then you should just play the DVD version, but even if you own a Blu-Ray player, it is better to go with the DVD discs, because the DVD has overall better quality then the Blu-Ray (if watched from normal distance).

The series is 5 stars, but I only give 3 stars because of the bad Blu-Ray quality.",1344902400,14,923,4.609756097560975

A love story trapped inside epic battle scenes and strong opponents battling each other.  I like some the names they used like Tiamat, Flame of Heaven, and some other lore creatures from mythology.",1378684800,,373,4.6923076923076925

5124779,5,B0083QJV6M,"Shakugan no Shana never fails to keep me entertained. It's funny in its own way and the story is just fabulous. Of course there is the romance which is portrayed very well and the action is done really well. It's just the right amount of serious for me and my sisters who are aged 12. It is family friendly with the exception of a few scenes but overall something that can be watched with young adults. Shakugan no Shana-tan is probably the most hilarious thing I've seen and something I looked forward to every series.

My personal favourite, I've made everyone in my house watch this and there addicted too, you really must give it a go :)",1377993600,,641,4.432203389830509

Upon receiving my package, it came in the usual dvd cardboard wrap. Unpacked and noticed the top of my blu ray cover had been torn like someone had tried to forcefully push or pull the tab. Not happy :( though the contents inside the sealed blu ray case itself was completely fine, the outside board cover is pretty much trashed.

Evan thinking about it still and re watching i didn't have any problems with the show and never got bored and was able to take back enough good to make this one of my personal favorites. Shakugan no Shana is worth your money. (Keep in mind i have seen the other 2 seasons and did include them as part of this review)",1370476800,,806,4.2064516129032254

Its a little different then the usual fantasy adventure.  One of the main characters discovers he's just a copy of his real self that is already dead for an unknown amount of time and this season focuses on his character development and the female protagonist' as they both learn the lines between being human and being Other and growing up and becoming an adult in dangerous and unforgiving world.

5124787,5,B0083QJV6M,"Okay, first of all, the anime is great and at $30, a complete first season with both BluRay AND DVDs should be a no brainer... But be realistic when you buy this.

I've seen a lot of people complain about the vudeo quality on the BluRays. First of all, this anime did come out in 2006, the artistry is what it is. Recall that was back when BluRays were still new and rather rare. Pretty much all anime at the time was released on DVD because that's what was most common. That being said, don't be a spoiled brat when comsidering this product. It IS an upconvert, meaning they painstakingly took the time and effort to upconvert this to HD. What that means, however, is that in some scenes you will still get the blurs that we used to have with even some anime on DVD. However, I can personally say after watching most of the season that they have done a GREAT job putting this into a BluRay release. The video most often is crisp and the blurs (at least for me) only occur in some of the darker and faster paced scenes.

Anyway, what I am saying is, at $30, this BluRay/DVD combo of season 1 is WELL worth the investment and I am certainly proud to add it to my anime collection!",1365120000,2,1179,4.235555555555556
5124788,4,B0083QJV6M,"I saw this title along with the reviews some people gave it before I gave it a try. I needed new material for my library and wanted to give this a shot. I will admit it starts off kinda rough with the story, but soon develops into a good, entertaining story.

Good balance of action and humor to keep the audience interested, and it doesn't stray far from the story like some anime I have seen.

After watching the first season I definitely want to keep following it into the second and third season.",1364860800,,500,4.308510638297872
5124789,5,B0083QJV6M,"Shakugan no Shana is by far, my favorite anime series.  While it does have some stiff competition from a few others, this series has always knocked it out of the park.

As many others have said, the new voice English actors in S2 can throw you for a loop; but I prefer to not dwell on something so petty.  The series is wonderful regardless and while I know the end of S3 was the appropriate place to stop the series, I am still saddened to see it end.",1363392000,3,452,4.113636363636363
5124790,3,B0083QJV6M,"The show is about a young girl who fights beings from another world to help protect the balance in the living world. Not a bad show in any way.  However the balance between the ""action"" part of the show and the ""slice of life"" part of the show is a bit off.  The title character, Shana, has little or nothing to do with most of the minor characters.  Better or more interaction with them would help her character to be more likable",1363046400,,431,4.2317073170731705

5124793,5,B0083QJV6M,"Shakugan no Shana is a wonderful anime series. Meet the flaming-haired blazing-eyed hunter as she encounters a mysterious torch by the name of Yuji Sakai. I can't really say too much without spoiling any of the story, however Shakugan no Shana, in my opinion, has successfully merged and action based anime with your average love plot. A much better attempt than many of its predecessors. Shakugan no Shana is my all time favorite anime series, followed distantly by Sailor Moon. In only 24 episodes Season 1 captures the attention of the viewer as well as tests their imaginations. Not all of the animations are top-notch, however far exceed that of many anime that I have seen.

Overall, Shakugan no Shana recieves a 4.7 of 5 stars, from me.
The plot is basic, however is interesting. At times it may seem repetitive, but not so blatantly as to lose fervor or attention. For hours upon hours of an excellent anime (as well as special features), I highly recommend Shakugan no Shana.

5124794,5,B0083QJV6M,"I read about this series on TvTropes. It's famous for codifying the 'Shana Clone', in other words, many anime since this one originally came out have been inspired by its hero. Season 2 is on my list.",1360713600,,200,4.4324324324324325
5124795,4,B0083QJV6M,"Shana season one, as it can be named for short (Shana is the name Yuji gives the Flame-hair, blazing eye Flame Haze, and it is then the name she and her mentors see her by) is highly entertaining but hard to pin down. It's almost easier to describe what it is not. It's obviously in the broad supernatural genre. Shana is a Flame Haze (combat spirit) who arrives on what she assumes is a routine ""hit"" in yet another human city. Her job is to wipe out Crimson Denizens (big bads) and their avatars. Humans have a life force the avatars can suck out. Yuji is such a human. ""You're dead already, get over it,"" Shana callously advises him. But there's something different about Yuji, and pretty soon he and Shana form an unlikely partnership.

It's not a magical girl story, it's not a harem story, and it's not a story of redemption. Yuji isn't a loser and he doesn't need to find his true confidence. There are elements of all of those however.

Yuji has a family (unlike many another anime hero) and his mom in particular is the Sage for the various youngsters and even for Shana's mentors.

Yuji has a best friend, and there's a cute girl in his class that really likes Yuji while the best friend likes her. But the love triangle is very gentle.

The real tension in the story comes from defending the city against a succession of Crimson Denizens. Some are ostentatiously evil and some aren't evil at all. Eventually Yuji realizes his very presence is endangering his city. Will he step away from the city he genuinely loves, and all the people he has ties to?

Art: Excellent. Modern crisp, clear and dynamic.
Music: Very good.
Voice cast: important note: Season One English voice cast differs to Season Two, which was picked up quite a lot later. If you dislike changes in voice cast, consider buying the Movie which apparently covers the events of season one. Having said that, I rate the English voice cast as Excellent.
Story: I drop the rating to four stars because it lacks the emotional content of the best anime. Defending a city from big bads is OK but not the strongest line to hang the character stories on.",1359763200,,2121,4.527415143603133

5124797,5,B0083QJV6M,"Enter Yuji Sekai, a young man whose passed on due to a denizen, and became a torch without knowing so to balance society. One day, he witnessed as a denizen's puppet was trying to gain power for the denizen, but was in dire trouble when the puppet noticed he was moving about the sealed area, because he holds a treasure within him. This is where he first meets the Flame haired flamehaze, and latches on to her. because she helped him. He constantly is asking her questions, and they become inseperable. He did name her ""Shana"" due to her sword being called Shakugan No Shana, which she didn't care for at first, but then started warming up to the fact of someone caring for her, and he thinks that everyone should have a name. There are others who pose threats than the denizens though, like the Chanter of Elegies, and others. The animation, and story line are amazing, even though this series does remind me somewhat of Shonen Jump's Bleach, but I found this series to be good in my opinion. I have ordered the 2 parts of Season 2, and preordered the OVA's releasing Jan. 22, 2013 due to the first season being as good as it was. I would recommend this to anime to anyone who enjoys Bleach, supernatural, action, and a bit of comedy.",1358208000,,1237,4.453744493392071
5124798,5,B0083QJV6M,"When watching Anime, there are two big questions, should I buy it, and should I watch the dub or sub version.  I will take these in order.

1)  Should I buy it?  I would place this among the top 3 anime DVD or Blu-ray sets of the year.  Shakugan no Shana is, if not a majorly important anime series, still one of the most influential ones of the last few years.  Season 1 ran in 2005, made a star of Rie Kugimiya, and spawned far too many heroines modeled after Shana(just those voiced by Rie Kugimiya herself include Loise, Taiga, Nagi and Aria), resulted in two more seasons, 1 movie, a series of OVAs...let's just say the series was pretty successful.  And that success was for a reason.

The animation is good, the character designs good to outstanding, the story ok to very good, the fights tend to be a weak area, but not noticeably bad, just not good.  What makes Shakugan no Shana so good is the incredible characters.  Yuji is a great hero for anime.  He is likable, and his positive qualities really shine through.  Howe3ver, he is far from perfect, and he succeeds despite his faults.  Shana is the star of the show, and rightly so.  Her whole life leading up to the series has been in the role of basically a weapon.  No name, little to no humanity, only existing to fight.  It logically follows just how much it might affect some one like this when some one starts to value her for reasons beyond her fighting, and she does not know how to handle this.  Then of course there are the other members of the love triangle(more accurately rectangle), Kazumi and Hayato.  Special mention must also be made of Yuji's mother, Chigusa, who is quite possibly the best mother in all anime.  Watching her gently teach Shana about being human, and trying to push a Yuji/Shana romance, but taking pains to look out for Shana's wellbeing is simply wonderful.  Her phone conversations with Shana's Crimson Lord, Alastor, The Flame of Heaven, is one of the great moments of the series, both hilarious and heartwarming.  And that does not even begin to mention the wonderful villains the series is full of, from the creepy Friagne and the brother/sister duo, He-Who-Loves-Himself (Sorath), She-Who-Loves-Others (Tiriel), to thrre eyes Bel Peol, and a whole host of others.

Also of note for this set is that for once Funimation got it right with the extras.  They are abundant and entertaining, featuring 40 minutes of original animation.  The two Shakugan no Shana-Tan episodes are wonderfully hilarious.

This series has everything, high drama to low humor, romance, violence, and normal high school students.  Even a bit of fan service for those who like lolis.  I would strongly recommend that if you like anime, then prioritize this series.  You will not regret it.

2)  Should I watch it dubbed or with subtitles?  Normally I would only mention this in passing, but for this series it is actually an important consideration.  There is a huge difference in the quality of the voicework between the Japanese and English versions.  I usually will watch with both, frequently flipping back and for the between English and Japanese.  Not so this series.  I tried watching it in English to start, but had to switch to the Japanese version and stay there before I started throwing things at my TV.  Tabitha St Germain is not a bad voice actress, but compared to Rie Kugimiya, she just does not stack up.  This holds true throughout the voice cast.  In every role, the Japanese voice talent was simply better than the English voice.  With Shana, being the title character and the key character the series revolves around, this is most noticable.  Shana's catchphrase is ""shut up, shut up, shut up""(""urusai, urusai, urusai"" in Japanese), and while Ms. Kugimiya brings life to it, it just sounds forced coming from Ms. St Germain.  I should also note that Junichi Suwabe as Friagne is incredible, bringing a wonderful creepiness to that character.",1357776000,,3938,4.7492625368731565
5124799,5,B0083QJV6M,"This is such a good anime, and the product is also very good.
I love that this contains the entire first season, and it is also in both blu-ray as well as dvd. The price was great for so many episodes, in both disc forms. You're really missing out if you don't own it.",1355097600,,268,3.9814814814814814
5124800,4,B0083QJV6M,"In 2002, Yashichiro Takahashi and illustrator Noizi Ito created the Japanese light novel series ""Shana"".

Published by ASCII Media Works from 2002 through 2011, the light novel series would receive two manga adaptations serialized in ""Dengeki Daioh"" and ""Dengeki Maioh"" and in 2005-2006, a PS2 and Nintendo DS video game and would also  receive an anime series adaptation by J.C. Staff.  A second season titled ""Shakugan no Shana Second"" was aired in 2007-2008, followed by a four-episode OVA in 2009-2010 and most recently, a third season titled ""Shakugan no Shana Final"" airing in 2011-2012.

VIDEO:

It's important to note that ""Shakugan no Shana"" season one is an anime series made back in 2005-2006.  So, this is essentially an upconverted anime series.  While watching on DVD, for most people, picture quality would look good but on Blu-ray, while the anime series is colorful and vibrant at times, it's also a bit soft and has banding issues.  It's not the best looking upconverted anime series on Blu-ray but I am glad that ""Shakugan no Shana"" was released on Blu-ray because I want the other newer series to be released on Blu-ray as well.

But animation was good, but not as fully-detailed.  Art backgrounds are good but not great.  If anything, what I did enjoy about the series is the many locations incorporated in this TV series.  A good balance of animation and CG, it's just that for people with high expectations of anime series on Blu-ray, this is not a series to have high hopes for.  It's more or less an upconvert of an entertaining anime series that gets better overtime and will lead to two more seasons which do look better, especially ""Shakugan no Shana Final"" which aired in Japan in 2011-2012.

AUDIO:

Similar to what I mentioned about the series being older, it's a series that is presented in Dolby TrueHD 2.0 (English and Japanese).  There is no difference in the lossless soundtrack and for those wondering why there isn't an English 5.1 lossless track, it's because this is from the original Universal Geneon recording and not a new soundtrack from FUNimation.  Still, voice acting is well-done on both soundtracks and dialogue and effects are clear from the front channels.  But for this older anime TV series, one should not expect a lot out of this soundtrack.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Shakugan no Shana: Season One Box Set"" comes with the following special features:

JUDGMENT CALL:

An anime series with a lot of action but also a lot of heart, ""Shakugan no Shana"" is an anime series I enjoyed for its characters.

There is a typical banality when it comes to human and a being from either another planet, dimension or world but those tend to be comedies (and sometimes those released in the U.S. seem to be perverted comedies), but ""Shakugan no Shana"" is quite intriguing because its protagonist seem so opposite, but yet overtime, these opposites start to become attracted towards each other.

So, in some way, the series is a love story about girl loves boy but is not sure how to understand her emotions because she has never had this feeling before.  But aside from that banal storyline, instead of being overplayed and overdone because other anime series have done that, ""Shaugan no Shana"" brings in this sci-fi and fantasy element as Shana is a fighter, a darn good fighter from another world. the

At first, you wonder why she is so smug, blunt and mean.  But overtime, you start to warm up to her because you learn that she has been taught to think a certain way and act a certain way because of her job and what is expected of her.  But on Earth and staying with humans, she starts to learn about kindness, love and other human emotions that lead to kissing.  And for this warrior, she is not exactly sure what kissing means or what love is but she knows that she gets flustered when Yuji is not near her, especially when she sees another girl who is in love with Yuji and wants to declare her love for him.

And while this series does have a lot of action and Shana engaged in major battles, for those who want fan service, get a little of that through the character of Margery Daw, your typical well-endowed woman.  But suffice to say, this is is one wild character that otaku's will enjoy watching.

As for the Blu-ray, it's an older anime series, so I knew the upconvert was not going to showcase great video quality and the fact that it was original created by Universal Geneon, that FUNimation would not be redubbing it, thus not giving it a 5.1 lossless soundtrack.  So, for those who have high hopes for this series to look or sound incredible on Blu-ray, don't have too high of hopes because it's not all that great when it comes to PQ or AQ. But it does look much better on Blu-ray compared to its DVD counterpart but it does have its fair share of softness and banding.

But once again, I don't mind that this anime series was released in the U.S. because there are two more seasons that will look much better on Blu-ray and glad that FUNimation went back in giving this first season an HD release, in preparation of the release of the next two seasons on Blu-ray and DVD.  There are several special features included as well.

Overall, ""Shakugan no Shana"" was a fun anime series.  And I enjoyed how a love story and action anime series was combined and balanced for those who enjoy either genres.  If you are looking for a not-so-serious sci-fi , action anime series but also a series that has a teenage love story, then definitely give ""Shakugan no Shana: Season One Box Set"" a try.  I'm looking forward to season two and three!",1354320000,13,6294,4.731617647058823
5124801,5,B0083QJV6M,"I love Shakugan no Shana. It is my favorite anime of all time. I will stray away from using opinion until the final verdict. I purchased this from a Funimation booth at Youmacon 2012 in Detroit Michigan.

The anime: The anime itself has a great story. While it can be confusing at times, everything comes together at the end. There are a lot of twists and turns to keep you on your toes, as well as an interesting ""love"" story. The first season ends with you wanting more

The quality: When we are comparing real Blu-ray quality with this Blu-ray version, it doesn't quite live up to expectations. Playing the DVD version is pretty much just as good. Although the smoothing in the Blu-ray version could make it look better for you. While I didn't exactly like the original voice acting of the english dub, this combo pack comes with both English audio and Japanese audio with sub, so if you prefer the original Japanese audio it's bundled together for you. But to be fair, unless you want to spend a ton of money on the originals, this is just as good, and i'm glad Funimation picked up my favorite anime for redistribution.

- Fudgetruck's final verdict: ""I love this anime a lot. I constantly purchase anything and everything that has to do with this anime. The story is deep, and the first season is just a start to seasons 2 and 3, which were very good. The story really tailors to all of the characters development over the course of the seasons, and if you haven't picked this anime up yet, you're missing out. While the Blu-ray version might not be as good as we may have thought, it's still good quality, and worth buying.""",1353369600,,1631,4.503378378378378
5124802,5,B0083QJV6M,"Shakugan no shana is one of the best anime stories i've ever seen. I mean the dialoge is prefect for it along with the action thats in season one and the others also. Here is a young flame haze girl who comes in contact with Yuji and as their relationship developes you see a young girl ""who was once isolated and raised outside of the real world"" struggling with emotions thats she didn't even know she had. Its a wonderfully done series! I am buying season's 2/3, OVA, and the movie when they come out for sure!! The only thing is the DVD blue ray combo pack. I don't really watch the blue ray versions of this on my blue ray so I don't need them but I guess if I decide to I can. Thats a minor thing, I give it and the others 100-100%!! I highly recommend to anyone that likes great anime action, with great dialog and character interaction to get Shakugan no Shana!!",1351814400,,870,4.2155688622754495
5124803,5,B0083QJV6M,It's a really great anime when I saw it I though It would be stupid. But when I finish the second episode I will like dam this anime is good. Can not wait to get the second season.,1351555200,,180,3.763157894736842
5124804,5,B0083QJV6M,"The story line has been done before. High school boy meets a girl with special powers. Even though this theme has been rehashed over and over; this series is surprisingly good. Yuji is a normal guy who happens to run into the flame haze, Shana. Shana fights a never ending battle with beings from a parallel dimension that eat human souls. The story is about the bond of their friendship and their fight to save the world. There are a lot of things about this anime to like. The animation is really good, the voice acting is good and the characters are interesting. Each episode keeps you wanting to keep watching more. As the relationships between the characters grows stronger the show becomes more captivating. I haven't watched the DVD version, but the Blu-ray version is good; not the best Blu-ray quality I've seen; but the picture is clear and the colors are vivid. The worst part about the show is that I have to wait to see the 2nd season. I really liked Shakugan no Shana and I'm looking forward to the 2nd season. It's not a new idea but it's still a really enjoyable anime. Give it a shot why don't ya.",1349222400,5,1114,4.465686274509804
