3659019,1,B001JP64XW,"This is a typical Poverty Row production of the early 1930's.  It has a weak, implausible script, is cheaply made, with direction and photography that is pedestrian or worse, and the surviving print is blurry and dingy.  It does have a few points of interest:

1) The story on which the screenplay is based is credited to Dashiell Hammett at the IMDB and Wikipedia.  However, no surviving print seems to have any writing credits at all (the film is in the public domain, and is available on YouTube and Archive.org).  Perhaps Hammett or his estate was able to get them removed at some point, or at least demand royalties for the use of his name.

2) The only trace of Hammett is the way the character of the protagonist, played by Ralph Bellamy, is written: He is an ex-convict (although apparently an independently wealthy one), and is tough, taciturn, and somewhat bitter.  Bellamy plays him well. In fact, Bellamy is not just the best thing in the film, he is about the only good thing in the film.  This is not saying too much, given the kind of film it is, but he is surprising if you have only seen him in ""The Front Page"" and ""The Awful Truth"".

3) This film seems to have been made before the Hollywood Production Code went into effect, yet released afterward.  The fairly explicit efforts of Melvyn Douglas's character to seduce Fay Wray's would not have been allowed under the Code, nor would Fay Wray's flimsy white evening gown, which nearly falls off her shoulder as she stumbles on her way to Bellamy's ""cabin"" (which, incidentally, appears to be a 15-room Tudor-style mansion).  Nor would the scene where Wray puts on a dress while wearing a low-cut slip - what's worse, in the same room as Bellamy, which he churlishly refuses to leave.  Yet it is said to have been released in late 1934, after the Code was in effect. From the fashions and film technique on display, I would say it could easily have been made as early as 1931, and simply sat on the shelf until point 4 kicked in:

4) The film seems to have been released to capitalize on Fay Wray's stardom after ""King Kong"" hit it big in 1933.  Although Ralph Bellamy is the hero and the star, Wray is given top billing.  In the poster for the movie, seen above, only Wray is seen, looking much as she did in ""Kong"".  In the actual film, her hair is dark, almost black.  She is almost unrecognizable, except for her voice.

5) The indoor scenes were shot at the old Biograph facilities in New York City.  Although Biograph was long gone, it's facilities survived under different ownership, used mainly for shooting short films starring performers based in NYC.  Outdoor scenes seem to have been shot silent and then had some sound dubbed in afterwards, increasing the dated feel.

6) In case you are a big Melvyn Douglas fan, he has relatively little screen time.  Although he is the best actor in the film after Bellamy, he is given little to define his character.  With his natural attractiveness and charm, it becomes hard to understand why Wray's character is repulsed by him and attracted to Bellamy's rough, cranky, ex-con.  (Incidentally, Wray is very pretty in this movie, but not very much of an actress.)

In conclusion, it is difficult to recommend anyone spending 69 minutes their life on this movie, unless they are very curious about Ralph Bellamy or Fay Wray.  As a pre-Code talky, it is a part of film history that lasted less than five years, but there are much better examples of that out there.",1332374400,5,3482,4.593851132686084

The crime drama WOMAN IN THE DARK was adapted from a Dashiell Hammett story. German-born Phil Rosen was a renowned silent screen director who was reduced to working for Poverty Row outfits in the sound era. Typically, this minor programmer was a product of SELECT PICTURES, a struggling company that vanished after one more release.

Filmed at the old BIOGRAPH Studio in NYC, ""Woman in the Dark"" is the story of an ex-con with a bad temper who tries to avoid getting into new trouble by isolating himself in a remote forest cabin. His reverie is disrupted and plans ruined when a young woman suddenly appears and begs for protection from her psycho boyfriend.

Miss Wray, best known to modern audiences as the blonde in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KING-KONG/dp/B000EHQTZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KING KONG</a>&nbsp;(1933), has her natural brunette hair. She's a knockout!

(6.1) Woman in the Dark (1934) - Fay Wray/Ralph Bellamy/Melvyn Douglas/Roscoe Ates/Ruth Gillette/Granville Bates",1312848000,9,1350,5.663366336633663
3659021,4,B001JP64XW,"WOMAN IN THE SHADOWS a.k.a. WOMAN IN THE DARK (RKO, 1934), is a crime-melodrama based on a little known Dashiell Hammet story about a one-time loser out on parole who meets up with a gangster's runaway girlfriend and gets himself in more trouble when he comes to her defense.

Phil Rosen, director of several BLONDIE installments, helmed this well scripted little B product which contains elements of film noir even before the term was coined. Shadowy photography, tainted characters, and misunderstood motives figure in a plot with a few twists. Featured in the leading roles are three of the era's most dependable stars. Ralph Bellamy usually played second leads who lost the girl in classics like THE AWFUL TRUTH (1937) and HIS GIRL FRIDAY (1940), and he gives an engaging performance as the easy going parolee who doesn't want trouble but seems destined for it. Romantic leading man Melvyn Douglas is cast against type as the suave villain who isn't about to let his girl ditch him for Bellamy. Seeing that the girl is Fay Wray, one can understand Douglas' fury. Known primarily for her iconic role as Ann Darrow in the mega-classic KING KONG (1933), Ms. Wray is no less adept at projecting her very pleasing combination of innocence and sensuality as the titular woman of this film. KONG cemented Wray in the public's mind as a blonde, but here she appears with her natural brunette hair and gives a well nuanced performance in another damsel in distress role that the actress always managed to imbue with her own brand of genuine warmth and charm. Blonde or brunette she's hot, and this is one of her best post-KONG efforts.

Filmed at New York's old Biograph Studios just before the enforcement of the Production Code in 1934, WOMAN IN THE SHADOWS contains some racy moments and verbal innuendo which wouldn't have gotten past the censor a few months later. Much of this material involves Fay Wray, and hence the film will have particular appeal for fans of the actress.

If you're expecting something on the order of Hammet's ""The Maltese Falcon"" you probably won't appreciate my four star rating. But for those of you who know where I'm coming from regarding pre-code, tightly paced (this film runs 68 minutes) B-movies with a good cast, WOMAN IN THE SHADOWS is a keeper. Synergy Entertainment's DVD-R looks to have been transferred from a decent, original 16mm print. The soundtrack has the typical background hiss associated with vintage movies, but the dialog is clear throughout. The only complaint I have with the disc is that it starts playing right away and doesn't include any chapter stops. This is a minor issue and in no way detracts from the enjoyment of the film, and although it's not perfect, Synergy's copy is still the best I've seen available on this title.

Don't be misled by overly critical reviews. Kept in proper perspective and reasonable B-movie expectations, WOMAN IN THE SHADOWS rates as one of the better examples of its type and one that I recommend.",1237766400,22,2988,4.852941176470588
3659032,4,B001JP64XW,"Engaging melodrama. Ralph Bellamy is a man whose temper has already put him behind bars and who is disliked by all the right people: the town sheriff and the villainous Lothario (Melvyn Douglas). He's helped/hindered by the sheriff's daughter (pretty Nell O'Day) who still pines for him and a mysterious woman in a slinky dress (the gorgeous Fay Wray) who's trying to escape the aforementioned Lothario who seems little more than a cad and a masher....at first. Roscoe Ates's comic relief plays a key role in the proceedings and is humorous and believable.

Did I mention Fay Wray is in this? She enthralls in every frame.",1456185600,2,622,4.867924528301887

3659037,3,B001JP64XW,"John Bradley (Ralph Bellamy- HIS GIRL FRIDAY, TRADING PLACES) is released from prison after serving a 3-year stretch for manslaughter. Enter the mysterious Louise Loring (Fay Wray- KING KONG, MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM, THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, DOCTOR X, THE VAMPIRE BAT), who staggers into Bradley's life one night. She is followed by the sinister Tony Robson (Melvyn Douglas- BEING THERE, THE CHANGELING, GHOST STORY). Bradley soon finds himself defending Loring from Robson's relentless, creepy advances, while trying to keep himself from going back to prison. This is difficult, since Robson gets the law involved after Bradley seriously injures his henchman. Bradley and Loring hit the road together. While staying w/ one of Bradley's criminal pals, the cops move in, forcing Bradley to take off on his own. Now Louise is in police custody. Naturally, Robson uses this as his opportunity to take advantage of Louise. How could this possibly turn out well? WOMAN IN THE SHADOWS (aka: WOMAN IN THE DARK) is a rather slow-paced crime drama. Thankfully, at just over an hour in length, it doesn't wear out its welcome. Bellamy and Wray are solid in their roles. It's the story that meanders a bit. Still, It's good enough for a watch or two. Plus, the finale is worth the wait!...",1417392000,,1280,4.985981308411215
3659038,4,B001JP64XW,"This is an early talkie, so it's a hybrid of silent and dialog film technology. Considering the age of the print, the restoration was good, even for audio. It still looks and sounds like a film from 1934, but as a friend of mine says ""It ain't THS but it sounds like it should"". There is absolutely no sense of urgency to this film by 2014 standards, but I imagine in 1934 it was pretty gritty, edge of your seat film stuff. The film is worth watching for the absolutely fabulous stark theatrical lighting in places, the late twenties flavored flowing gowns and a braless (obviously often cold) Fay Wray. I give it four stars for being an excellent time capsule piece with enough social flavor of the time to make it an interesting history piece. Movies like this are good to remind us that stories can be told, characters developed, sensuality, strength and vulnerability exposed with minimal technology and a little thought. Nobody got mad enough about the dog, though...but there's that hole in crossover film making where directors often thought the shot was enough for the audience, and at the time, it may well have been.",1414454400,,1127,4.696969696969697
3659039,1,B001JP64XW,"Might have been a spectacular movie to watch, but I'll never know because 1) the contrast is terrible: too dark, too fuzzy; and 2) SOUND IS AWFUL - completely unintelligible at points and lots of snap, crackle and pop noises. I tried three times to watch it, eventually just let it run in the background without trying to strain to understand it.

Sad, sad, sad.  Why bother offering a classic movie like this without ensuring it's watchable or listenable.

CLOSED CAPTIONING WOULD BE AWESOME FOR ALL STREAMING MOVIES.  Seriously, why the big deal? Offer two versions of each movie, one without CC or subtitles and one version with permanent CC or subtitles.",1406246400,3,658,4.848214285714286

Pros:
-Storyline had potential
-Actors were decent

Cons:
-Directing, I am pretty sure it was the main culprit
-Edit made for a disjointed movie
-Almost came across as silly or melodramatic

Overall, if you can take the 1930's (which I typically like) then this movie is watchable.  Overall, it continually fell low on every aspect of what makes a good movie.  I don't think that this is anything to write home about.  To watch or not to watch...good luck.",1460937600,,495,4.6976744186046515
