It can be argued that sexual hang ups are the root of many bigger issues. Therefore, for societies sake watch this and have your 15 year old watch it too.

In an age where pornography has replaced sex education, and virtual reality is blurring the lines between sex and masturbation, this movie daringly gives us nearly a decade of research on the subject matter from studied experts. My hope is that it will pioneer more much needed discussion, scientific study, documentaries, and discourse surrounding this still all too touchy subject.",1467072000,2,559,5.511627906976744

7596787,4,B01A9X9M6A,"This could have been so bad, but it turns out way better than you might expect (I probably wouldn't have given it a chance had it not been free with Prime).

What Sticky is not: interviews with randomly selected people from the sidewalk patched together with goofy interludes.

What Sticky is: A slickly produced documentary, 7 years in the making, featuring segments from dozens of interviews skillfully edited together with humorous or dead serious media clips. We hear from physicians, psychologists, academicians, schoolteachers, clergymen, a famous punk rock singer, and (of course) a porn star, among others. Well, maybe there are a couple of goofy interludes too, but you also get:

1. The Morality of Masturbation
2. Masturbation, Law, and Politics
3. A Brief History of Masturbation
4. The Art of Masturbation [this is referring mostly to masturbation in film (regular films, not porn)]
5. The Business of Masturbation
6. Medicine, Masturbation, and You

The documentary is brimming with brief clips from films throughout the decades (usually cited with title & year), and contrary to what you might suspect, they are much more than just comedies intended for teens / young adults. If you're a film buff, Sticky bears watching for that alone.

Despite tackling some of the more serious aspects of masturbation controversy such as former Surgeon General of the United States Dr. Joycelyn Elders getting canned essentially because she said something sensible that people weren't ready to hear, the surprising (considering we are now in the 21st century) attitude of denial is confronted in Sticky with meaningful lighthearted comments and a good dose of common sense. If you are unfamiliar with the origin of vibrators, you will truly be amazed and maybe even shocked when you learn it here. Recommended for the curious, and especially for the fearful.",1466121600,17,1859,5.183333333333334

7596795,5,B01A9X9M6A,"The concept of masturbation whether as a preventative health aide, foreplay, or sheer self-pleasure, was always a topic to be avoided when I was growing up in the deep south of Louisiana; anyone who admitted to doing it was laughed at and shunned. I was one of 'those' people. Someone that practiced and encouraged exploring one's own body to learn what works for you, if you don't know then how are you gonna let a partner know!

As a self-love advocate, I really appreciated the fun education provided by this film. The wide range of expressed views, the history of the act as well as the tools that can be incorporated into it, these all made for a well rounded documentary experience. This should be included as day 0 learning for any sex education course.

There are those that have reviewed this movie negatively for it's 'graphic' content. I don't feel this documentary ever went 'too far' in its presentation of the subject matter. For those concerned about children having access to this film on Amazon Prime Video; please be aware they are learning far more graphic and misleading information on the schoolyard, on the streets, and most importantly on the internet. It is healthy to have a curiosity about one's own body, and more importantly they need to be getting accurate information about their bodies without the shame and fear that is instilled in them by society (i.e. - I'm talking about you, parents)",1487808000,2,1420,4.791836734693877

Only one thing disgusted me...and that was the fact that Bill Clinton, a documented sexual predator, fired  Jocelyn Elders as Surgeon General due to her wanting to educate students about masturbation.  So, it wasn't the subject matter of the film that made me wince, it was the hypocrisy of a president.  All in all, this is a very enjoyable look at a subject that most of us are very famliar with.

I would recommend it to anyone interested ion the subject -- though, I would probably not consider it a ""first date movie.""  Probably, a second date movie, however!  An easy way to learn about the history of the subject, as well as many unknown facts, all while keeping it viewer friendly.  I watched with a friend, and we both had a great time, often pausing it to make jokes or comments, and a few times because it sparked serious discussion.

7596823,5,B01A9X9M6A,"Good, funny, informative movie.  It covers a taboo topic, but makes a convincing case that the taboo is harmful and that this should be covered in some form in high school health curriculum.  I think with a little bit of editing it could be great for 15 y.o.+, but as it is now parents will probably want to review it before showing it.  A bit of frontal nudity, but nothing beyond what's shown in today's PG-13 movies.

I also think it's notable that a lot of the one-star reviews are just a few words, and tend to focus on moral issues.  I think this movie is getting hit by fundamentalists that are trying to shut this down the same way they succeeded in shutting down a U.S. Surgeon General.",1474848000,9,695,4.3565891472868215
7596824,5,B01A9X9M6A,"I had the privilege of meeting Nicholas Tana in 2009 as he was starting this project because one of my friend's is one of the experts in the documentary.  I, once again, had the privilege of meeting Nicholas at the San Diego premiere of the documentary and I cannot express enough how impressed I am with what he has created.  If you are looking to ""get off"" this is not the movie for you.  But if you are curious about the history of masturbation and how it is talked about (or not!) in our society, in religion, in our educational systems and government, this documentary will definitely take you there.  Of course, with a subject like masturbation, there will be lots of tongue in cheek comments and plenty of laughs.  But there were also poignant and frankly shocking moments, especially the story of a young boy who killed himself after being humiliated and bullied by his classmates around the subject of masturbation.  This documentary is eye-opening, funny, educational, and shocking in what it exposes about our shame and repression around the topic of masturbation but it also is presented with wit and compassion and hope that we can all eventually love ourselves and each other for who we choose to be and how we choose to live our lives.

 Is it a practise? Am I using the right verb here?

Anyhow. Verb nonsense aside. Sticky the documentary covers the subject of masturbation expertly & with enough humor to take the edge off, but not so much where it becomes silly and you loose focus of the films core message. And that message (to me anyway) is: Hey it's ok. you're not a jerk (still not a pun). And no. Jesus doesn't cry when you do it.

7596880,4,B01A9X9M6A,"The film's not bad, and I gave it an extra star because it talks about a taboo topic that really shouldn't be so taboo. So it helps make the topic a little less taboo by talking about it.

The best part of the movie was the revelation that other animals do it in the wild, especially other primates. So how can masturbation possibly be wrong? Are the animals committing a sin by acting on their God-given instincts?

The worst part of the movie was that it did a poor job of being objective. The movie was pro-masturbation, and also pro-sex. And I have no problem with this, because that's pretty close to where I'm coming from, too.

But in an attempt to be objective, the film only explores two negative aspects of masturbation: 1) Serial killers do it, probably accompanied by very sick fantasies, and 2) It's possible to masturbate too much, to the point where it becomes addictive, compulsive, or somewhat harmful to a person's life.

Unfortunately, the author completely omits the worst and most common aspect of male masturbation. As I stated in my review of the excellent book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pornified-How-Pornography-Is-Damaging-Our-Lives-Our-Relationships-and-Our-Families/dp/0805081321/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pornified: How Pornography Is Damaging Our Lives, Our Relationships, and Our Families</a>, the excessive use of Internet pornography not only CAN harm young men's sex lives, it IS harming their sex lives. If more than half of all male masturbation is now done to Internet porn, then when you say, ""Masturbation is fine,"" what you're effectively saying is that ""Internet pornography is fine -- or even beneficial."" And I don't think you can say that -- not at all.

I'm not saying that porn is terrible. Realistically, excessive use of porn is probably less harmful that excessive gambling, drinking, or drugging. But it may be at least as harmful as excessive TV watching, or eating a fast food diet. Porn isn't totally harmless, and the film unfortunately makes it seem that way.",1468972800,,2064,5.338461538461538

This documentary explores all different aspects of how masturbation is stigmatized and made taboo, whether through medicine, religion, historical beliefs, or public shaming. One of the most interesting and fun parts of this documentary is the number of pop culture references, which keeps the movie moving at a fast pace.

It's ridiculous and upsetting that masturbation carries such a heavy stigma and shame, and I think this documentary is so necessary and groundbreaking. We need to be talking about topics like this in a responsible, open, and respectful way, because otherwise we are all held down by fears and judgments (of self and by others) that limit our ability to live a happy, self-expressed, fulfilled, and connected life.

I'm shocked by the number of low reviews and short reviews. I can't imagine those folks actually sat, watched, and thought about this documentary. Or they are using this Amazon comments area to project their own shame and self-judgment on others? Regardless, I think this is an important educational tool that is also quite humorous and fun.",1468800000,3,1206,5.211340206185567

In fact, it's very far from love and selfish, it's actually committing adultery on yourself, which is a sin. There are many ways of self loving, masterbation is not one in anyway shape or form. The quote, ""If God doesn't want us to masterbate, then he would of given us shorter arms"" is horribly incorrect. God has given us the gift of ""free will"" and wants us to constantly choose between right and wrong on our own, it will always be wrong and sinful.

8746847,5,B01A9X9M6A,"Great heart, info, and playful sense of humor earn this documentary a review of two thumbs way up.
It's a fun quick little delving into of the cultural history of masturbation, exploring it's significance in the realms of medicine, religion, fantasy, compulsions and addiction etc. This movie rocks lots of fun little interviews with people like Nina Hartley, Joycelyn Elders and many more, a must see.",1517529600,2,402,5.106060606060606
8746848,5,B01A9X9M6A,"With interviews and movie clips this examines the practice of self love, its impacts and results. Faith leaders and adult actress along with common folk comment. Mentions songs and art as well as occasional cruelty. Also mentions that it led some to violence and the results of the act upon famous people. Insightful, bare skin.",1516147200,,328,4.9818181818181815

8746850,1,B01A9X9M6A,"This movie is very one-sided and frankly a waste of time. It presents the Catholic Church's perennial, true, and infallible teaching that masturbation is  intrinsically evil and morally wrong in every circumstance in a very negative light. All the people interviewed, except Fr. Harvey and a few Eastern mystics say that masturbation is good, healthy, and so forth. If it were a fair documentary it would at least present both sides. In any case, the people interviewed for the most part seem like flakes to me. Most of the movie is spent showing clips of other movies. Be warned: there is a considerable amount of male and female nudity that I would say qualifies as offensive pornography. Of course those who own adult stores and magazines are going to say it is good- that is what sells their products.",1510876800,,805,4.7913669064748206
8746851,4,B01A9X9M6A,"Glad that there is a documentary about this! I grew up in a very conservative home where masturbation wasn't talked about and sex was a very shameful/dangerous thing that brought pregnancy (as a teen) and disease. (What was REALLY needed was knowledge on how to have safe sex rather than remaining ignorant to it to avoid these outcomes.) That oppressive view of sexuality still haunts me a little bit into my mid-20's, but I've been doing a pretty bang up job of replacing it with body-positive experiences and information. Anyway, the movie was a tiny bit dull at certain points, but I was pleased as punch that this was being spoken about even though this doesn't seem to have been a popular documentary nationally. Will be recommending to my friends and boyfriend. ;)",1504828800,2,771,4.804511278195489
8746852,5,B01A9X9M6A,"Incredibly informative and entertaining, while also promoting a positive and strait forward message.
