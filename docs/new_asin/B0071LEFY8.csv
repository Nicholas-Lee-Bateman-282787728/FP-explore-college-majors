5048420,5,B0071LEFY8,This anime is amazing in Japanese AND in English. Funimation casted the characters very well in this series. Totally worth it :D,1335139200,,128,4.863636363636363
5048421,5,B0071LEFY8,"I love the packaging! The texture is smooth,and The detail is fantastic. I love the extras it was fun to watch. It was totally worth it. I recommend this to Black Butler fans!!",1334534400,,176,4.363636363636363
5048422,5,B0071LEFY8,"This was amazing. Perfect condition. So smooth! It felt nice to touch in your hands! The pictures and colors are beautiful and the box you place the cases in is sturdy. The Blue Top that says ""Blu-Ray"" on top of the box set comes off when you open it. It's just cardboard. And if you don't already own Season 1 DVD/Blu-Ray combo pack then  it's okay because until you do there is a cardboard box in there that has Sebastian on one side and Claude on the other to fill its place! :D I highly recommend it. Oh and you might as well order Season 1 with it because it's cheaper because if you don't you'll be like me. It'll arrive: and you'll feel empty without season 1 and just end up paying more! Worth it in the end.

Sebastian is still, one hell of a butler.",1334361600,,759,4.156462585034014
5048423,4,B0071LEFY8,"I have already bought the normal dvds for the first season, and it seems to be that they're only selling the dvd/blu-ray combo version of season 2. I bought the season II anyways because Kuroshitsuji is one HELL of an anime! Sadly, almost everything is perfect except one thing. They gave an extra box to put in the first season, however, my first season doesn't fit in it. They ONLY designed the space for the first season IF you buy the dvd/blu-ray version of the first season which i think i lame because OF COURSE most people HAD ALREADY BOUGHT the first season in the NORMAL dvd version since that came out first already! I think they should've valued the customers more rather than doing things that might make people buy more. So YES, it's a waste of space. =_____= HOWEVER, everything else is fine! It's a beautiful box and everything else is perfect! I just wish they could've gave more care. Also, the USPS service was TERRIBLE! First of all, it took them about 2 weeks for it to arrive when my friend also ordered hers AFTER i ordered mine 3 days. And her's arrived first by a week even though we BOTH got the free super saving shipping and we live close by as well. When the USPS did arrive, I had my mother stay at home the whole day to wait for it to come. When I came back home, I saw those ""We missed you"" papers on my door EVEN THOUGH my mother said she didn't hear the door ring at all! This isn't the first time that has happened because the last time i ordered a Ciel plush, the SAME thing happened and EVEN if you call them to redeliver, they won't ring your bell! So you have to pick it up yourself! >:(",1334016000,2,1625,4.262135922330097
5048424,4,B0071LEFY8,"I love Black Butler and already watched it as a fansub and as an import dvd, so I knew I would love the actual show. I was pleasantly surprised with the OVAs which I absolutely loved and hadn't seen before.

Having said that, I hate the packaging. I don't have a blu-ray so having to pay extra $ for discs I can't use is a really crappy way of jacking up the price by Funimation. Additionally since I have the box set of the dvds not the blu rays I can't take out the filler box and put in season 1 discs because the dvd case is larger than the blu ray case. So basically it's a waste of space, IMO.",1333843200,7,599,3.950413223140496
5048425,5,B0071LEFY8,"I have no regrets buying this item.

5048426,5,B0071LEFY8,"The box set is better than I expected, with one side picturing Sebastian and Ciel and the other side having Claude and Alois. The material of the box is also better than I expected and I am very happy with this product! So if you haven't watched the first season, I would advise you don't watch the second one just yet, but both seasons are so worth it!",1333584000,,353,4.205882352941177
5048427,5,B0071LEFY8,"GORGEOUS packaging!
Full of the entire season on both blu-ray and dvd, and it contains all the OVAs listed!
The box and the series is absolutely stunning!!
WELL worth the 3 month pre order wait if you ask me!! LOL

It's SOOO worth it.",1333411200,12,270,3.8214285714285716

5048443,5,B0071LEFY8,"A set of antagonists with real character and dynamic style. Sebastian truly peaks his finesse and bad-assery while being faced with worthy adversaries and Ciel's stubborn and strong sense of will allow him to push through yet another series of conflict. What's best about this season is that every annoying character only has like 2 episodes of face-time. Far more organized, witty, stylish, and enticing. This season is what made enduring the worst of season 1 worth it.",1440374400,,471,5.051282051282051

No?

5048482,5,B0071LEFY8,I very much Love Black Butler and the interaction between Grell and Sebastian .. good stuff.... I watch the series on Netflix  but  I plan on having a few episodes on the kindle as well..,1387670400,,187,4.314285714285714
5048483,5,B0071LEFY8,"This is an awesome set. Just in case people wonder why this is so much more expensive than the $30, its because this particular set comes with a large box that is capable of holding both season one and season two. It even comes with a decorative cardboard filler to hold the second season in place without the first season.

The series its self is wonderful as always, beautiful picture, sound and amazing storyline. The 'Making of Black Butler II' OVA sums it up: Stunning visuals, amazing battle scenes, combined with the beautiful cruelty of its storyline. It honestly is as amazing as the first season.

It varies from the manga, I promise you that, but then again, so does season one. This, however, is one such beautiful creation that  I believe holds true to the theme of Black Butler, and still is quite researched and detailed on that time in ways that still amaze me. This is one such beautiful gem that you should get and keep in your collection just because it is beautiful and worth watching over and over, no matter how it varies (for those who adore the manga). Most animes that veer from the manga become shoddy and less detailed, losing the feeling the author intended. Both seasons of this, however, are so beautifully detailed that I was shocked that the manga was different.

All-in-all, this is a beautiful series, and if you don't mind that its different from the manga, just as I don't, this is an amazing buy!",1387411200,,1433,4.607843137254902
5048484,4,B0071LEFY8,"This was a birthday present for my fiancee. She loves this series and the loved the gift. This was a great buy. I myself have not really watched any so, I have no comments on the actual anime.",1386892800,,192,4.078947368421052
5048485,5,B0071LEFY8,"There isn't much to say that I didn't cover for season one. Again, beautiful art, and an ever twisting story line that is fantastic. It's a really great series, and now there are so many secrets being revealed, more background on characters we've followed and just loved, and so much more. The secrets, of course, are not just surrounding Ciel, but his ""help"" too. It all culminates in an angels versus demons fight.... and that's all I'm saying on the plot and what happens. It's just a great series, and I recommend it.",1384819200,,521,4.612903225806452
5048486,5,B0071LEFY8,"I find this anime absolutely fascinating. It's unique and different, something you don't see everyday. This is true for both the first and second season. The storyline was amazing, but it was the characters that really drew me in. Each character contrasted from each other, showing different sides of the human mentality and their need to survive. There's a reason I stayed up all night on a school night to watch every single episode of the season, and if you watch it, I'm sure you'll find that reason yourself.",1381622400,,513,4.775280898876405
5048487,1,B0071LEFY8,"I shouldn't have bought this. I'm really not into this sort of Anime. I was really bored for the first one, but WHY the second?!",1380844800,,128,4.16
5048488,5,B0071LEFY8,its came in good condition with no problem it is an excellent anime and it was amazing to watch and see,1379289600,,103,3.9523809523809526

5048501,5,B0071LEFY8,"I know that this season of Kuroshitsuji gets a lot of hate, but I don't understand why.
I think it's a fantastic season.
The only thing that was even a little off-putting was the undertones of sexuality that was just laced throughout the season.
It drudges up the feelings in between Sebastian and Ciel and kind of casts light on the undisclosed feelings in their relationship.
Still, it's amazing and I'd recommend it a thousand times over.
Fantastic show, characters, and just everything.",1375660800,,490,4.9156626506024095
5048502,5,B0071LEFY8,"this was my first anime box purchase, and i love it! the discs were pristine, still in plastic, and was crystal clear on quality",1374019200,,128,4.375
5048503,5,B0071LEFY8,"I enjoyed this season very much. To me, it was much darker than the first season. I laughed so much with the first season...not so much with the second one. I'm giving it five stars because I felt it was good even if I didn't care for the story line very much. I have opted to only download certain episodes on our Kindles. Since I have 12/13 year olds in the house, I felt some of the episodes were inappropriate for them. If your letting your kids watch, make sure you screen it first. And let me say the last episode was THE WORST!! Holy Cow I did not see that coming at all!! I feel like I am missing so much from the shows, I have ordered the mangas hoping they can fill in the gaps. ""I HAVE TO KNOW!"" See why I gave it five stars? It's got me wanting to know more!",1373587200,,770,3.9741935483870967
5048504,5,B0071LEFY8,"This was one of those shows where I literally finished watching it in like two day! It has such an awesome storyline, and the characters are so captivating. I simply loved it, watch it you won't regret it! Though, first watch the first season! Otherwise what the heck  is the point?!",1373328000,,283,4.549019607843137
5048505,5,B0071LEFY8,"Sometimes funny, other times serious, often times entertaining, Black Butler delivers.  One of the creepier child and grown man pairing I've seen in Anime, this series still manages to entertain you all the way to the very end.",1371945600,,227,4.973684210526316
5048506,5,B0071LEFY8,"I bought the first season and loved it. Sabastian followes his master arround like a little puppy. I thought the show was quite funny and dramatic. Season two was not as good as season 1 but It still had it funny parts. Grell is still dying for Sebbys attention and Undertaker is just as creepy as ever. But Alois. I love him. Hes so spoiled

I would recomend this to any Anime fan. 4 stars for me but not as exciting as the first season",1370563200,,437,4.141176470588236

5048510,5,B0071LEFY8,I have really enjoyed the Black Butler series.  It was somewhat of a guilty pleasure...who would have thought I would be rooting for a demonic butler?,1367798400,,150,4.769230769230769
5048511,4,B0071LEFY8,"I absolutely loved the first season! Almost every episode made me laugh and I must say that the second season was not like the first season. While it had some dark humor and the same great characters, I feel the ending was upsetting. I feel the child abuse was disturbing. This was not through out the entire season where you were constantly seeing this abuse, but little comments are made through out the episodes. These comments are important and go along with the story. I felt this season had enjoyable episodes and fun OVAs. I would recommend those who watched the first season to watch the second season.",1367625600,,610,4.657407407407407

5048516,3,B0071LEFY8,"I love that it comes with bluray discs and regular DVDs...and 6 very awesome OVAs.

I did love the ending, very clever, and the extras were very awesome, so all in all it was pretty good, just not first season, 5 stars good!",1362528000,,351,4.176470588235294
5048529,5,B0071LEFY8,"well, all I can say that after watching this complete series is that I'm left thinking ""what the HELL have i just watched?"" it's such an odd mix of feelings. Firstly even after being aware of Japanese culture to a certain degree and being a fan of many aspects of Japanese entertainment I'm still left wondering what the writer of the manga intended. Are people really satanic? or is this just a theme used for entertainment? I find this entertaining but it's quite bizarre and obviously occult and esoterically themed. This second season starts off very enigmatically and left me cold at first since there was seemingly no continuity whatsoever following the end of the first season, but without going into any possible spoilers it all makes sense roughly half way through this second season's episodes.

I've yet to watch all the 'bonus' type fan service episodes but they are great so far. All in all if you loved season one you simply cannot go without watching this second season.",1361836800,,985,4.794117647058823
5048530,4,B0071LEFY8,"I am a huge fan of Black Butler and can't get enough of it. Season 2 is pretty good but like most sequels, it isn't as good as the first season. There's a lot of action and the story is good but the drawing of this season seemed a little lazy to me at some parts and frankly annoyed the crap out of me compared to the quality of the first season. Although, I suppose that could be contributed to the fact that the second season is on bluray. Overall, it's worth buying just be prepared that it isn't as great as season 1, not by a long shot.",1361059200,,541,3.9724770642201834
5048531,4,B0071LEFY8,"This would get five, except for the ending. Don't worry, no spoilers! lol. Still an awsome series, I just feel bad for one of the characters in how it ends....lol. The second season is a bit darker and grittier than the first season, and a bit more blatent in it's sexual inuendo in some respects, which some might take issue with. Otherwise, if you liked season one, you can't go wrong with season two!!!!!",1360972800,,407,4.513513513513513

Claude takes care of Alois Trancy who suffered the vilest form of abuse, Alois is needlessly sadistic cruel and abusive taking his frustrations out on and punishing others often displaying psychotic tendencies as he does with Hanna a beautiful maid in his employ one day in a psychotic rage brutalizes her in a barbaric way. He and Ciel are polar opposites Alois is the dark to Ciel's light

Claude is a greedy demon who hungers for and lusts after Ciels soul and finds Alois's soul tastes sour and thinks Ciel's tastes better wants to claim and devour Ciel's soul instead. We get to see rarely enraged Sebastian who partially lose control after Claude crosses the line. Reaper Grell helps Sebastian get to Claude so he can battle his demon nemises and the two engage in deadly combat. An interesting plot twist leads to an unexpected discovery about Hanna, followed by something very strange and shocking happening to Ciel leading up to a very mind blowing conclusion that will not disappoint die hard fans one of whom is me

Unlike Black butler season 1 this one contains many dark elements some are disturbing but realistic and show the darker side of humans. The last part of the final episode with Ciel is a shocking but good suprise I did not see coming I watched it twice. For those who haven't tried season 1 yet you will love it. This set includes 3 DVD, and 2 Blu Ray discs, the anime, artwork, detail, color, and sound are amazing. I only hope they make a Season 3 then I'll really be in heaven, well enough said hope this helps",1358121600,2,1907,4.602941176470588

5048594,5,B0071LEFY8,"I'm a geek for this. When it came out on Youtube, even without any subtitles, I watched it anyway. Will and Grell are too cute.
But forcing myself to see past that, the story was pretty impressive too! I liked that it was short and sweet, but really said a lot about both the reapers and their job as a whole. I was impressed with how much we got to learn about the shinigami life in such a short time. Definitely worth watching. I re-watch it for multiple reasons: the story is great and I love the characters.

And my one complaint (which doesn't take away from the quality of this) is that Grell used to be so much more assertive, I suppose, than he is now. I really want to know what happened between this OVA and the ""present"" of Kuroshitsuji that turned him from such a hard-shelled guy into... a pile of jelly, basically.",1345766400,,828,4.3076923076923075

I was thinking that since this is season two the story-line, music, artwork, would be less than perfect, but I was 100% wrong! This season is awesome and it goes pecfectly with season one. Unlike other animes that season one was the best than season two. The story-line was excellent, the figthing was perfect,the music was perfect, and the main characters shine. I was surprise the way this season ended, I loved it:) If you are a Black Butler fan and love everything about season one, then this season will blow you away! You will not be disappointed, I really recommend buying this season, PLUS! the OVAs are included! And the are awesome!",1340841600,,705,4.693548387096774

5048601,5,B0071LEFY8,"I honestly thought that the Black Butler anime could not get more monumentally epic than the first season was. They proved me wrong. The second season has turned the once case closed ending of season one into a reawakened new story with many twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat! New characters and new plotlines combine with the past of the sereies to make everything you knew to be true a lie. Beautifully gothic and full of mythical escence Black Butler is in general.....""one hell of a time"" but the second season confirms that to the fullest of its extent! With beautiful animation and richly colored characters *all of the ones from the first series plus some XD* I seriously recommend this series to anyone who has ever had a doubt about their existence in the world and has wondered if it is all worth it in the end.....

Contains some strong hints of shonen-ai/yaoi themes

For mature audiences only",1339718400,,927,4.612121212121212
5048602,4,B0071LEFY8,"The Black Butler franchise is a very artistic but dark series, especially the 2nd season. The 1st season had more of a whimsical side but this is a good season as well. If you loved the first season, you will either love or hate this one as it has a different feel to it. If you are familiar with the manga, then none of the 2nd season is cannon. But that doesn't mean it isn't interesting.

  I don't want to spoil anything about this, but basically you are getting the 2nd season on blu-ray and dvd. That consists of the show's 12 episodes and 6 OVAs (extra stories). There are also some commentaries and extras like outtakes. It has 2 blu-ray discs and 3 dvd discs of the same material. It also has reversible covers. The case is pretty solid as well. One thing to take note is that the box and containers are blu-ray size. So if you were planning on fitting your non-blu-ray, season one dvd set in here, that's not going to happen.

  The reason I put 4 stars is because even though the 2nd season is good, it's not as good as the first to me. Also, some characters don't really get as much screen time in this. But it is worth the watch and buy. The 1st season is definitely worth the watch and buy and is a must own for any anime fan.

  Black Butler is similar to Death Note and xxxHolic so if you happened to like either of those series, then maybe this is your cup of tea. And if you are older then 14, then you should have one heck of a time enjoying this. Get this set and bring out your inner demon. >:p",1339545600,6,1515,4.125850340136054

The 1st season was amazing as well. 2nd season made Black Butler 10 times better. :) I really hope they make another season, but by the ending of the 2nd one I don't think they will.

I had watched this season already once before I bought this, and can say that I liked it because of the return of a lot of my favorite characters --Grell :3-- but I feel like it ended like a bad fan fiction. That's just my opinion though. This season is definitely radically different from the first, which follows the manga to some extent, for those of you familiar with that. However, this one is still wildly entertaining, and includes new characters and another sexy demon butler, so I would suggest it to anyone who's a fan of the series!

The crazy characters we met in the first only make cameo like appearances.  The dark like part of the first was doubled in the second.  I have a hard time with violence against children. The story does a great job of explaining how Ciel lived past the first season.  The last episode of season two made the whole thing worthwhile.  I did not recognize Luci Christian as she usually plays younger boys; she did such a fabulous job.  I will listen to Brina and Michael in any project.",1336089600,8,643,4.213114754098361
5048618,4,B0071LEFY8,"The first series of Black Butler was a fascinating story, involving some very dark comedy, some downright weird historical anachronisms, and some nice interplay between the characters. Little girl Queen Victoria and crazy angels and a ""New London Bridge"" being constructed of human souls. It was just a fun watch from start to finish.

The second series is by no means bad, and I did enjoy it, but the introduction of Alois Trancy (which ended up being the whole storyline) was really uncomfortable. It took all the weird molestation undertones that Sebastian-Ciel's relationship had (buried behind a ""demon devouring a soul"" motif) and brought it really far out into the open. Alois is damaged goods from the ground up, he's literally molested by his adopted father and he's got his own father-figure demon to devour his soul, just like Ciel does. But where Ciel comes off as vulnerable (and desperate to hide it), resigned to relying on Sebastian even with the knowledge that the ""devouring"" is coming sooner or later, Alois is cruel, and seems to relish his fate, and flies off the handle when his own demon decides he'd rather ""devour"" someone else.

Overall the second series is good, and if you're a huge fan of the first you won't be sorry you watched it. Some of the bonus OVAs included are also tremendously fun. Just be prepared, there will be some awkward moments.",1336089600,39,1375,4.846808510638298
