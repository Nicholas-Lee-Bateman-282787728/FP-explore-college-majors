8742372,5,B000GI3KJE,well number one I've only had the CD for about 3 weeks now so that is not enough time to tell but based on what I am feeling I'm more limber and I can see that in the near future that my body will be as firm as I would like for it to be,1425254400,,236,3.309090909090909
8742373,5,B000GI3KJE,"I had trouble finding this & barely knew she had this advanced ""fun challenge series"" dvd.
There are more reviews on her vhs version & this 55 minute dvd suggest you master her 3 dvd beginner ""easy"" & 3 dvd intermediate ""hello fitness"" series first.
From other reviews on her other DVDs, you know she has a soothing voice with an accent that I didn't have trouble understanding, the views are gorgeous & she always tells you great info about body placement, even chinese medicine/martial arts/qi gong terms. She also tells you what organs or parts or systems of the body each pose works on as you do it to keep you going. Her soft speaking never intrudes your concentration. The music is light new age, mostly dominated by piano or string instruments.
The poses done are: extended side laying leg stretch, stretching dog (upward dog w/o torso on ground), locust, bridge w/1 leg up, bow, plough, shoulder stand w/o arms, lying angle pose (plough w/wide legs), half locust fish (fish w/one foot in groin), threaded seated spinal twist (arm under bent knee), side angle, standing forward bend, warrior 3, crane, a short light meditation, 5 step lotus stretch (stretching foot to chest, face, outward, groin & then ends in her signature seated chant song.
Reviewer's only complaint in her other series is too much makeup & colorful outfits. Some had trouble with her accent, but I who usually do, did not.
Her website is under her name wailana com",1181692800,6,1443,4.776

8742375,5,B000GI3KJE,"I have been practicing yoga for a little while but I can't always make it out to a class due to my busy schedule. I find that using videos at home is an excellent way to keep up my yoga practice and I have to say that the Wai Lana yoga videos are the best I've ever used. They are the closest thing to being in an actual class. They are beautifully produced with clear instruction, wonderful music and lovely scenery.
I just did the Wai Lana Firming workout video and found it to be a challenging and very productive workout that employs yoga poses to help firm and strengthen your body. I'm looking forward to doing this workout again and I definitely feel that with regular practice, this Firming workout will really help you firm up and get in shape.
Thanks Wai Lana! You are a great instructor.",1073520000,4,798,4.3624161073825505
