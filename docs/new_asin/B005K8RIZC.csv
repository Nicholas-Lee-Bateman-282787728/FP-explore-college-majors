The voice overs miss some parts but not that bad and you'll have to get used to the dub part though. In my opinion, i don't think it was that good. I'm glad Viz Media got the rights to it and I hope they dub it soon and have it play on Toonami Saturday Night/Sunday Morning. But if you really want to watch this anime then just watch it in japanese w/ subs or wait for the dub cause Media Blasters don't really do that great as Funimation and Viz Media do. Well I Hope This Was Helpful For You. Peace!

4715813,4,B005K8RIZC,"I have been hotly anticipating this release for quite some time now, ever since the Anime was released in Japan. I held off on watching the series for an official release, but you can bet I looked around to see the opinions on the series. First off, Bakuman has become notorious for having issues in the first Season towards pacing and placing heavy emphasis on the romantic sub-plot between our main characters Mashiro and Miho. However, these problems are not even close to present in these first seven episodes. Bakuman: First Issue is a straight adaptation of the first 9 chapters or so of the series. I never found it to be dragging along, and loved that nothing was missing from the chapters. If you are a fan of the ""Manga about Manga"", you will adore this particular volume.

This DVD Release is solid, as it is indeed a dual language release. I have not yet watched with the original Japanese track, but considering my lack of knowledge of the Japanese language, I'm hardly a good person to judge the quality of the acting. However, I can vouch for the English dub, as it is a well produced one that I found to be well acted and directed. I only had issues getting used to Tagaki's voice, as I thought it was a little too stoic at first, but as the episodes go on, the character starts having more explosive sentences, and it's once you hear those that you'll be sold on Kevin T. Collins' performance.

So, one may be asking why I rated this DVD with 4 stars, seeing as I gave it a glowing review so far. Simple, the DVD gives us very little in terms of extra content. Included as ""features"" are textless opening and endings, something that I found to be of no interest to myself, though I can see them being useful to AMV editors. That being said, I would have preferred a little more from this release, be it an extra episode or behind the scenes information on the dub. Realistically, I'm probably asking too much of Media Blasters, as this is the kind of series that qualifies as a gamble (pun not intended). Still, it would have been nice to have that little bit more.

All in all, this is a fantastic release of a series that I love. Do NOT miss this one! I can't wait for the next DVD release!",1322352000,17,2209,4.396088019559902
4715814,5,B005K8RIZC,"Is Great series, English dub Is Great!! coming from mediablaster im really surprised. Has Comedy,drama, you cant go wrong, package is great, im Loving the story, if you like anime,manga alot, consider buying it now ^^, you won't regret it",1321660800,6,238,4.975
4715815,5,B005K8RIZC,"Bakuman is one of my all time favorite animes and mangas and it finally got dubbed.

The dub overall I give a 5/5, all of the voices fit great, just might take a little time to get used to.
The series I give 5/5 because its simply great, a lot of people say its boring or so slow to get on with but I think its awesome, don't care what anyone else says.

And the packaging that Anime Works/Media Blasters put it in is awesome, great front and back cover designs and everything. It exceeded my expectations and I would suggest buying this to anyone who loves manga, seeing 2 teenage boys go on with their lives,futures and dreams while trying to become famous manga writers is just awesome.",1321660800,9,689,4.333333333333333

8476605,3,B005K8RIZC,"The DVDs worked well, but the clasp holding the first disc was damaged and would not hold the disc thus leaving slight scratching.",1517616000,,130,4.695652173913044
8476606,5,B005K8RIZC,"Best series ever!!!!!! I've watched it through three times in a row on animefreak.tv and was waiting and waiting and waiting for this to come in when I ordered it. My only issue was that when it came in, even though brand new, the DVD had popped out of place, but that's not able to be controlled. Sometimes the holders don't hold onto them enough because the disk isn't pressed into completely or the holder breaks enroute. Other than a couple minor scratches on the disk it works great though it does skip, but I'm going to look for a way to repair the disk. Great series, I won't give spoilers though. Though it is about two guys who work their ARSES off literally to become some of the greatest mangaka (manga artists) ever. That's all I'll give. You won't wanna miss out on this series.",1437264000,,791,4.424657534246576
