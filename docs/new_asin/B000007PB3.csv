7905149,4,B000007PB3,"Inspired from the British TV show of the same name, ""Bless This House"" is a fun and humorous 1972 film.  Sid James is full of wit and the brief appearance of Wendy Richard was a nice surprise as well.",1517270400,,200,4.128205128205129
7905150,2,B000007PB3,"As with most spin off movies of British sitcoms, they seem nothing more than over long and extended sketches of a standard episode. By no means is this a bad film as it does hold some laughs and likeable performances from its impressive cast list such as Sid James, Terry Scott, June Whitfield and Patsy Rolands, but it has no real plot as such and the whole thing careers along with no real direction. At best the film can be described as adequate although die hard fans of the series will lap it up. The whole thing seems terribly dated now though!",978998400,,550,4.401960784313726
7905151,4,B000007PB3,"If you loved the TV series (come on, admit it!) then there's no reason not to enjoy this good-time family film. British comedy fans are treated here to the legendary Sid James as well as Patsy Rowlands & Peter  Butterworth (the neighbours), Robin ""Confessions"" Asquith, and  Carry On veterans June Whitfield and Terry Scott. The films simple charm  and mining of everyday life events for laughs is a blessing in an age of  increasing violent banality. These include the making of home-made beer and  wallpaper that refuses to stay up. A must-see for all vintage British  comedy fans.",961286400,,583,4.8979591836734695
