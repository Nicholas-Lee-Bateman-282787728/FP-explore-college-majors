8047985,4,B0007L7LY0,"The 80's were a great decade for television.  Prime time shows like Remington Steele and Scarecrow & Mrs. King rained supreme.  The shows were light hearted - thought provoking and anything but realistic.  I miss the days of Amanda getting herself into hot water and Lee (and ""The Agency"") coming to the rescue.  Of course, like so many - I couldn't wait for Lee and Amanda to come to the realization that they were better together than apart.  There was a plot and a love story unfolding.  Sure beats the overkill reality tv we have today!",1166313600,4,540,4.572916666666667
8047986,5,B0007L7LY0,"""Stemwinder"" has Lee and Amanda running from the Agency while trying to prove that they are not double agents for the Soviets.  This is the long-awaited episode where Lee finally admits his love for Amanda.",1128902400,3,206,4.885714285714286
