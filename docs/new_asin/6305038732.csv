952805,5,6305038732,"""In the World Tonight,"" is an intimate 1997 lesson in studio arts set to the music of Paul McCartney's album Flaming Pie.  The cinema verite camera lends initmacy as Paul speaks, sings, plays, and improvises in his music studios, animation studio, and television studio.  But the television aspect ratio and light editing of the home-movie styled shots leave Paul in the center of the screen almost all of the time--so the cinematography is a little predictable.
In the film you might expect to see the result of Paul having a movie camera follow him around throughout his career.  Paul uses relaxed poses around a campfire in a woods,  boyish facial expressions and charming movements in his home studio, bright reactions in the television studio, and serious looks in the Abbey Road studio.
Voice, song, music, drawing, painting, animation, and architecture all play a part in making this ""home movie"" of a historic artist stay fresh.  But, like a home movie, the loose style of the film leaves a couple of funny shots or shots that could be a little embarassing too.

Musicians and artists should like ""In the World Tonight"" because it gives a close up look at how Paul speaks, sings, plays, composes, draws, or paints in unique home, public, and arena settings.  You can see Paul improvise funny songs and sing in his studio and rehearsing or recording with Ringo at home, and you can see him in formally orchestrated recording sessions at Abbey Road Studio and performing before a historic audience of 180,000 people in an arena in South America.
The cinema verite film is also a news reel of Paul's life in the mid 1990's.  Paul's daughter Mary and her husband Alistaire produced and directed the film.  Wife Linda sings informally with Paul in the recording studio, and rides horseback with him in the woods, but she appears in the film to be a more secondary figure than she has seemed after her death, but her appearance could be a major part in the film.
In the segment that documents Paul's award of knighthood toward the end of the film, Paul says that knighthood gives you a chance to make your girlfriend a Lady, but Linda always was a lady.",1009238400,21,2155,4.740641711229946
952806,3,6305038732,"This DVD is a nice little documentary - but that's about it. I watched it and stored it away, and I probably will not watch it again. Not that it is bad, but it's nothing 'out of this world' either, watching Paul talking about Paul and about his work on Flaming Pie. The highlight is definitely 'Beautiful Night' at the end of this documentary - probably one of Paul's best solo songs ever. If you are a huge McCartney fan, go ahead and get this one - otherwise, I recommend the 'Live at the Cavern Club' DVD which shows him doing what he does best: Being one of the greatest musicians this planet has ever seen....",1005091200,12,615,4.310344827586207
952807,5,6305038732,"As a long time McCartney fan, this is my favorite.  Flaming Pie is certainly Paul getting back to his roots, best music he's done in a long time, a sense of the man again.  The video shares the making of some of  this, as well as the many sides of Paul.  If you like McCartney, you'll  love this!",946425600,2,296,4.0344827586206895
952808,5,6305038732,But I would not have expected less from Paul McCartney.  Sir Paul has set the standard for music composition for this century and richly deserves all the many awards he has received...I just can't wait for his future  releases!!!,936230400,3,229,4.846153846153846
7881190,5,6305038732,This video was great!  Nice to see footage of Paul and Linda and also Paul and Ringo recording together.  I never heard a lot of these songs before so I was excited to hear them and puzzled why they never received enough airplay.  I think this DVD would be a great addition to any McCartney fan's collection!,1405641600,,308,4.368421052631579
7881191,5,6305038732,Very interesting. Paul shows a side of him you do not see in other DVDs. A more personal side. Thanks!,1362700800,,102,4.15
7881192,5,6305038732,"This documentary give us some detail about the making of the excellent Flaming Pie album.
The arrangements and orquestration for Beautiful Night were a very fine work.
I thought you cannot play the guitar and sing at the same time in ""Calico Skies"" but Paul proves in this video, that he can.
Paul explains here that ""Little Willow"" was made after he knew about a friend passing away and wanted something to say to her kids. It's understood the evident sadness in the song.
Perhaps one of the main reasons to get this DVD is that we can see Linda still fighting against cancer and as always, supporting his husband.",1221868800,,615,4.6
7881193,4,6305038732,"Said Jim Gay: "". . . and one of the best things he'd done in 20 years. The songs are laid-back, breezy, and soulful, like Paul has remembered everything he used to be....""

Hmmmm....the same was said about George Harrison's ""Cloud Nine."" What's the common thread here?

As a life-long Beatle addict (and that means from the first time I heard ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" in 1963 -- a very bright child was I), I can say with authority that second only to George Martin (who orchestrated ""Beautiful Night""), NO ONE can pull the Beatles sound out of a Beatle like JEFF LYNNE.  Gay neglected to mention Jeff in his list of Paul's ""friends"". Paul was so impressed with Jeff's producing skills on the Anthology tracks (and we can thank George H. for that - he knew no one was as qualified or as passionate as Jeff to make it work), that he tapped him to co-produce ""Flaming Pie."" Smart move, Paul -- you could really use him NOW, as well.

So . . . we can thank Jeffy for pulling ""All the Best"" from Paulie which gives this DVD its reason for being. Otherwise, what would be the point?",1216512000,,1079,4.326732673267327
7881194,5,6305038732,"I was lucky to find this movie at the Library first and fell in love with it.  I had to buy it for myself.  It shows Paul with Linda and you can see the love there.
I loved all the songs and Paul can be very funny.
Paul is my favorite Beatle and I really like this documentary of the Making of the CD "" Flaming Pie"".",1209340800,,316,3.701492537313433
7881195,5,6305038732,"This DVD is fantastic. As an afterthought..It is heartbreaking. All in one DVD - THE story about Flaming Pie,SFF intro,Ringo & Paul,Linda's last recordings,Paul's last love songs for and about Linda,Song dedicated to Maureen Starkey/Princess Di,Beautiful night,George Martin,Abbey Road studios,snippets about Anthology and don't forget the Juggler!(MPL LOGO) And we owe it all to Lenny Kraddick!!!!!!",1151625600,3,400,6.160714285714286
7881196,5,6305038732,"I have and will probably continue to have a collection of Beatles dvd's, both together and by themselves. This rockumentry is brilliant in the way it portrays Paul at the time of his releases of Flaming Pie, (which in my opinion is the best thing he has done by himself). It gives you an insight into his feelings about his past associations with the fab four and with his family and friends.

At times it can bring feelings of sadness especially seeing him with Linda,

My recomendation for any beatle or McCartney fan would be to purchase this wonderful rockumentary as soon as possible.",1127520000,8,589,4.653846153846154
7881197,4,6305038732,INTERRESTING DOCUMENTARY BUT IT IS PITY THAT THE DVD WAS NOT SUBTITLE IN FRENCH LIKE THE FRENCH TV VERSION !,1122940800,,108,4.45
7881198,5,6305038732,"Sometime ago I bought in Hong Kong the VCD version of this superb artist's work for Flaming Pie, one of his most accomplished album ever.
It's always rewarding watching an artist at work. See the places and people around him. The actual instruments played, etc. I specially enjoyed George Martin's orchestra input and rehearsal for the recording of Beautiful Night. It's really powerful the way it blends with the basic melody and Paul's singing (and Ringo's drumming!).
Images of World Tonight somehow reminded me of The Magical Mistery Tour, which I saw in December 1967 (then a kid) when first shown on British TV...cool! Now, I don't quite see a guy like Paul hanging around the streets listening to his own tunes carrying a radio - he's probably a bit too mature for that",1072569600,6,776,4.798507462686567
7881199,1,6305038732,The thing with Paul is that he gives nothing away. There is nothing new in this doco. It is just egomaniac Paul going on and on about what a suberb bloke he is. There are some very embarrassing moments in this. Definitly one I wouldn't play to my mates!,1021939200,6,253,4.183673469387755
