7955612,5,B00005UWAP,"Excellent TV movie thriller released in November of 2001 which moves at a fast pace.  Lots of suspense for a movie which somewhat mimics ""Crimson Tide.""  Surprisingly good acting from all of the cast members to include Casper Van Dien.  The slim case DVD runs approximately 92 minuets instead of the 75 mentioned in the product details.",1361491200,2,336,4.859649122807017
7955613,4,B00005UWAP,"If you like suspense and Navy movies, this brings it to the screen. Looking forward to seeing this again. Thumbs up!",1328054400,,116,4.571428571428571
7955614,5,B00005UWAP,Of course you can figure out the ending but still this movie I personally thought was worth watching and have seen it several times.,1256083200,2,132,4.541666666666667
7955615,4,B00005UWAP,"While the story is cookie cutter simular to others Navy sub near deaster mutiny story lines, the story has a twist before the LAST MINUTE prevention of nuclear war and the end of the world.  Acting was good, and the underlining story line helped hold your interest. Not a five star but held my interest waiting for the BAD GUY to get his just reward. Recognised three top stars from years past and they helped the story. My wife said the captain coming out of the shower had the best abs she ever saw and was quite a looker. Yuck!!!",1250380800,,532,4.32
7955616,3,B00005UWAP,"Pretty well everything about this movie is standard fare but it is done well enough to make watching it a pleasurable enough experience .All the ingredients you would expect in a submarine movie all are present and correct here. There is the new skipper ,still finding his feet in an operational situation (Casper Van diem);there is the first officer who feels he should have got the job ,a mutinous or potentially mutinous crew and an outside enemy -this time North Korea. The direction by Jon Cassar is tense and tight and the cast do fine in their relatively undemanding roles

This is a good way of spending 90 or so testosterone fuelled minutes and confirms my view that Van Diem is worthy of more prestigious  projects  and bigger budgets",1194739200,4,744,4.751937984496124
7955617,5,B00005UWAP,"Pretty much a rehash of Crimson tide, using todays hotspotsand a reversal of the characters roles (You will see what I mean).  I personally felt this movie's story worked better then Crimson tide though.  Maybe not as much special effects, but was able to carry itself equally as well on it's storyline alone.
I found this movie in the movie store and had never heard of it before, but heck for 13 dollars you can't go wrong",1018828800,6,424,4.4935064935064934
7955618,4,B00005UWAP,"Definetly a guy's flick. If you're into sailors, then you're in for a treat. Casper Van Dien fans will enjoy his performance as well as a sneak peak at his torso during the de-contamination scene. Gerald McRaney's performance is decent as well. There is enough suspense without the gore.",1017446400,3,287,4.877551020408164
