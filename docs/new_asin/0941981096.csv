172264,5,0941981096,Great family movie the kids will love it. The movie delves into the belief that love can overcome anything. My Wife and I loved the stage show so much we named our daughter Alegria. The movie just add's what the stage show  could not...,959472000,3,236,4.363636363636363
172265,4,0941981096,"Cirque du Soleil's Alegria is not a video of the show Alegria but is a love story that has small bits and pieces of the show Alegria and it's characters thoughout.  There are three or four times when mild profanity is  used.  There is implied mistreatement of young children which could also be  upsetting to small kids viewing it. I enjoyed the movie, but it was not  what I hoped it would be - Alegria (the show) I'd seen in Atlanta and at  Beau Rivage.",953164800,5,455,4.294117647058823
7793529,1,0941981096,"I expected it would be the circus Cirque du Soleil performing.  But instead it is a story about shadowy people, all photographed in what appears to be a night setting.  The story line does have some of the people joining Cirque du Soleil.  But it is a weird story which I didn't bother watching in its entirety.  I wish I could get my money back.",1110412800,6,346,4.276923076923077
7793530,1,0941981096,"Upon seeing the show titled Alegria on the Bravo channel, I went to a local audio-video store and purchased what I thought was the same show I had seen on television. It was titled Alegria, and I couldn't wait to get it home and watch it. You can't imagine my disappointment when I fired up my DVD player and started watching. It wasn't the circus acts that I had been so thrilled by. It was a movie about two people who fall in love behind the scenes of the big-top. So be very careful when you go to purchase Alegria. If, like me, you were intrigued by the circus acts, this isn't it.",1032220800,,586,4.1946902654867255
7793531,5,0941981096,"take it from a circus performer, this is an amazing movie. not only is the music magical but the story is moving and lovely. this is a wonderful and uplifting movie that skillfully combines the beauty of Cirque du Soleil with the format of a ""conventional"" movie. this movie made me cry both the first and the second time i saw it. it has a wonderful message that can be appreciated by every one.",1028505600,,396,4.364864864864865
7793532,5,0941981096,"We picked this up used as an ex-rental and did not know what to expect, other than our basic familiarity with Cirque performances.  I can't tell you how pleased we were.  The plot was enough to hold our interests, some darker images more than offset  by the ""alegria"" ending, and the music - WOW!  We can't get the title tune out of our heads and even the younger children run around humming the hauntingly beautiful melody. This is the only movie that everyone has requested to watch more than once (and we've seen it 5 or 6 times at last count, although hubby does think it a bit ""strange"".)  Our 4-year-old now claims she wants to be a clown when she grows up! Hmmmmm...  I guess you could call it inspiring!  (I'm inspired enough to search for the soundtrack CD...)",1013817600,,769,4.45
7793533,5,0941981096,"I was at a friend's home and she had on a movie channel or I would never have known about this movie. But I heard the music and saw some of the acting and I said ""What is this?"" and went out and bought the video. What a fabulous, imaginative, exhiliarating film. Unique and full of emotion. Not ordinary by any means, and not what you'd expect. Cirque du' Soleil is incredible, the music is incredible, and the story fascinating. If you are bored with Hollywood movies, be sure to find this. Also, don't buy the soundtrack, get the CD ""Alegria"". Both are good but the original version (without the girl's picture) is the best. I've made all my friends watch it, too.",996105600,5,666,4.4227642276422765
7793534,1,0941981096,"If the History Channel were to do a documentary on Cirque Du Soleil this would be it.  I'm personally not interested in the life story of a few of the performers (perhaps that's a bit to harse).  I prefer the shows like I would see in Las Vegas.  Give me Quidam, you can keep Alegria.",992995200,,284,4.127272727272727
7793535,5,0941981096,better because of lovely story more acts by all but beautiful  Had to watch again to get all teh nuances,985478400,,104,4.2
7793536,5,0941981096,"What a magnificent movie.  It is a beautiful love story and an intriguing representation of Cirque Du Soleil's message of the actual performance of Alegria.  A marvelous ending that is  very emotional and is so uplifting that it brings you to tears.  It also makes you wish that the world could always work out the way it does in this movie.  The portrayal of innocence is very prevalent.  It also is a perfect representation of the sacred value of Cirque Du Soleil's Alegria.  Please do not go into this movie thinking that you will see a performance of the show, it is not a realistic thing to expect because Cirque Du Soleil has informed me personally that this performance will never be videotaped.  The movie is something more intrinsical than a performance although the performance is very powerful in its own right. The acting was excellent and very underrated in my opinion especially in the case of Frank Langella who always has interesting roles, this one was no exception.  I loved this movie and will always cherish it.  I wish Alegria (happiness) to everyone.",979603200,11,1072,4.7771739130434785
7793537,5,0941981096,I absolutely adored this film.  It takes you away to a world that is not based in reality and doesn't pretend to be so.  If things don't always make sense so be it.  The art and imagery are breathtaking. I would recommend  this film to anyone who is remotely interested in Cirque.,963446400,,280,4.326923076923077
7793538,1,0941981096,"BEWARE!  BEWARE!  This is NOT the Cirque Du Soleil performance of Alegria that has been seen and loved around the world.  It is a ""fable"" with some short glimpses of that performance.  To make  the cover on the jacket look so much like the Alegria show is extremely  deceptive.  Fortunatly, my DVD was bad, so I can send it back for a  refund.
There is a nice moral to the story, and that is that love can  conquer anything.  But the majority of this video is about child kidnapping  and abuse.  If this is what you are wishing to purchase, great, but don't  think you are getting a video like Quidam, which is the actual  performance.
I couldn't figure out how to give it 0 stars.",960249600,8,681,4.301587301587301
