3135325,1,B0014VPFRM,"I am a great fan of BBC videos and I have a good collection of them. I recently saw GANGES on Amazon and i was very much impressed with the price of this disc. It shipped from MILA TECHNOLOGIES and the order was fulfilled by Amazon. The package containing this bluray reached my address intact. When I opened the packet there was a printed material that said this bluray was made in the recent times and hence the player used for this might need a firmware update. I have the latest version of software on my PS3 and I ran this disc in my PS3. With my first run, it paused at about 30th second after starting. I played it from the beginning again and this time it stopped after a minute. I made a couple of attempts and each time it would start and stop at a different point.

3135329,5,B0014VPFRM,"After having viewed quite a few of BBC Earth and BBC Earthish documentary films I have to say that some are definitely better than others. Anything with David Attenborough's fingerprints on it is obviously of high quality. But the others can be lesser achievements and good-but-not-great.

Ganges, however, hits all the right notes and is as good as anything in the BBC Earth lineup. It features not only terrific secenery, but also blends in aspects of people living along the river banks at its various stages, and the wildlife that thrives in the delta near the ocean. All-in-all I's say it's formula is a successful mixture of Planet Earth, Human Planet, with a pinch of Earth: The Biography.

I was sceptical going in, as this is one of the lesser known BBC Earth Productions. But I am happy to say my scepticism was absolutely misplaced.",1364774400,,843,4.8068965517241375

3135343,5,B0014VPFRM,"Having been born and raised in India and also being to a few places that have been shown here, it was more like a trip down the memory lane. This is a very well filmed, covered and illustrated documentary about a river that has been revered as sacred in India for ages, but sadly, relegated through the last few decades to almost a drainage for the hundreds of millions for whom it is everything from a washer to a toilet.

Brilliant documentary.....",1323561600,2,450,4.487804878048781
3135344,4,B0014VPFRM,I enjoyed watching these quite a bit.  The footage is amazing and the information presented is intriguing and mostly relevant.  I found the episode about the delta to be the most interesting.  What detracts from the presentation is the narrator's frequent reverential mention of spirituality and mysticism.  I don't find this quaint or enriching of the content presented.  It's just silly.,1319328000,,389,5.311475409836065
3135345,4,B0014VPFRM,"Well done documentary on history, origins or Ganges. The river has been a witness to thousand years of flourising civilization on its banks.",1308096000,2,140,5.130434782608695
3135346,5,B0014VPFRM,"I had seen this series on television but the blu-ray release is simply stunning. The premise of the story is simple - follow the Ganges from source to delta - and it is the intermingling of people and wildlife that makes the programmes so compelling. Sometimes the interaction can be uplifting - the fisherman feeding the baby otter - and sometimes quite depressing - the tigers that are forced into smaller and smaller spaces to survive. The high definition format brings every whisker and snowflake into sharp relief as well as providing breathtaking views of the mountains and the river valley. Admittedly, some shots - like those of the snow leopard - were not in high definition but, for me, that just reflected the reality of the rareness of these creatures. Up until a few years ago, there was no film of them at all. The extras are interesting (all in normal definition). The montage of deleted extras was mesmerising and the story of filming the emaciated tiger quite heartbreaking. If you like BBC nature then this disc is one you will enjoy - the narrative is compelling, the wildlife fascinating, and the quality of picture superb.",1266969600,9,1143,4.807106598984771
3135347,4,B0014VPFRM,"Typical of BBC nature shows, the cinematography is terrific, especially in Hi-Def.  I don't care for a lot of the ""green"" slant in the commentary but find it easy to ignore because I don't attend at the Church of Gaia",1265414400,,217,4.425
3135348,5,B0014VPFRM,"This is a wonderful visual and sensory delight that not only entertains but also depicts every facet of Ganges and to some extend the people around it.
Documentary is divided into three distinct parts. First part depicts the inception of Ganges, the glaciers that fuel it, the religious believes that surrounds it origins. Second part depicts the 1500 mile run though the Indian plains and the final part explores the delta when Ganges merges into ocean.

Throughout the run the documentary also discusses flora and fauna around the Ganges, people who live around it and how they are dependent on it, perils that animals (who are dependent on river) are facing in the wild. All this knowledge is packed with wonderful cinematography, panoramic shots and an equally potent sound track.

Only thing that I believe missing in the documentary or perhaps could have been added as an extra feature is the dangers that the river (also the life who lives around it) is being exposed to due to over pollution and over consumption.

Nevertheless, this is definitely recommended for all.",1254700800,3,1076,4.966666666666667
3135349,5,B0014VPFRM,This disk not only has beautiful pictures but also a fabulous story line.  It is as much about the people of the area as it is about the nature.  Very nice combination.,1252800000,,168,4.21875
3135350,4,B0014VPFRM,"I recently got a 50"" plasma (panasonic G10) and a blu-ray player (panasonic 60) and I wanted to test out all the blu-rays that supposedly had the best picture quality. These nature docs have been considered some of the best.

GALAPAGOS = 4-Star Blu-Ray Video / 2-Star Nature Doc

The video is good, but not great like a pristine movie transfer like Sin City or Kung-Fu Panda. I found this nature doc particularly boring. It has a few nice bits, but there's lots of repetition of shots, and wildlife just isn't as interesting as the other docs. I would only reccomend this if you're super super super interesting in learning about Galapagos.

GANGES = 4-Star Blu-ray Video / 3-Star Nature Doc

Video quality is about the same as Galapagos, good, but there's a lot better. This nature doc is a lot more interesting than Galapagos, more magic shots, better tid bits, a more emotional experience. This is worth checking out for the content.

PLANET EARTH = 4.5-Star Blu-ray Video / 4-Star Nature Doc

This is a fantastic video transfer, better than Galapagos and Ganges. By better, I mean, richer blacks, deeper colors, sharper detail. All around, a step up. This is a four disc experience. I think they put all their best content on the first disc. Seriously, the first disc was thrilling, the others were a huge step down, in terms of locations and wildlife. Maybe it's a weird personal preference thing, but I watched the first disc three times, but could barely get through the others. I would say disc one is a must see.

BARAKA = 5-Star Blu-ray Video / 5-Star Nature Doc

This wins the Super Shiny Titanium Standard Award for best video and best nature doc. It was shot on 70mm and transfered to, like, quad-HD digital. This is one of the very best blu-rays ever made. It holds up against all new releases, because the source was 70mm. And this nature doc seemed the most magical. If you want to get a good demo disc, to show to any audience, this is the one. And the Baraka experience sticks with you. I can see myself watching this quite a few times in the years ahead, just for the experience.",1250208000,17,2098,4.576
3135351,5,B0014VPFRM,"Excellent work, narration and packed with incredible information.
I learnt more about the Ganges from this film than any other source.

3135362,5,B0014VPFRM,"Excellent program covering the young Ganges (Himalayas) thru mature river and civilization - lots of people it supports in Northern India and up to Bay of Bengal - Via Sunderbans - Bengal Tigers. Photography top notch from BBC, narative also excellent.
Highlty recommend it.",1246665600,,274,5.25
3135363,5,B0014VPFRM,"I have been interested in building my library since I bought Planet Earth a few years ago. I know I may never find anything that will match Planet Earth BBC (it's just that awesome!) but I was pleased with Ganges. I enjoyed seeing the different social groups and how they use the river in their farming and religious communities. If you enjoy seeing nature as it was meant to be seen (with the exception of in-person) then you will enjoy Ganges.

Bottom Line: Well worth the investment and something you will watch more than once as well as invite others to watch.",1242259200,4,564,4.529411764705882
3135364,5,B0014VPFRM,"Very good documentary. Wish they would go in more details about the animals. Overall, great HD pickup.",1242259200,,102,5.0588235294117645
3135365,3,B0014VPFRM,"Iam very disaapointed after watching the DVD.
I bought this DVD expecting that it shows more about the
Ganges and it's religious importance and covers more about
the religios places Badrinath, Rudra Payaga, Rishikesh,
Haridwar, Varanasi and so on. It mentioned little about it
and more towards the species around the Ganges basin.
It skipped fully Patna big city next to Ganges, and coverd full
episode about Sunderban and tigers.
It should have coverd 2 episodes from It's origin to Varansi,
and 1 episode from varanasi thru it's journey towards Patna,
Howrah and Bay of bengal.
That aspect I disappointed, but the production quality wise
it's fantastic and very scenic.

If you are looking for species and animals next to Ganges
basin this DVD is for you. If you are looking at religious
angle this is not for you.",1240185600,21,816,4.870503597122302
3135366,5,B0014VPFRM,"Totally awesome, Journey of Ganges captured from Himalyas to the Sea. Commentary is available in Hindi, English and Bangla which helps.

Having it on BD is a big plus.",1239494400,,167,4.758620689655173
3135367,5,B0014VPFRM,this is a fabulous piece of work as are the majority of bbc documentaries. if you like this sort of entertainment you need to have this one in your collection. the cinamatography is top tier and as you might expect the dialog is full of interesting facts that you will here nowhere else. the blue-ray format is stunning.,1238457600,,320,4.5344827586206895
3135368,5,B0014VPFRM,"We just watched Ganges a few weeks ago and were blown away. We are Indian and the people we invited to see the film were Indian as well, so this was especially relavent to us.

The documentary overall was quite good, it not only focused on the physical aspects of the river (how it effects the environment) but its spiritual significance as well. The photography in this film is amazing.

The Blu-ray presentation was stunning, and the level of detail and color was really heightened. It really made the documentary come to life. And surprisingly for a documentary, the DTS track was quite good, and the narration and music did a good job enhancing the experience. I don't think we would be as involved in the events if we were watching it on DVD.

Anyone interested in India or history in general should check this out!

3135369,4,B0014VPFRM,"I really enjoyed seeing the history and culture of India in high definition, since who knows if I'll ever have the chance to visit? One thing that disappointed me was all the focus on global warming. I understand the importance of keeping a clean environment, but please stop with the green mafia B.S. I can't take it anymore!

These are also the best movies to showcase a really big screen. My daughter is in 4th grade and these titles are all compelling to her (as well as her parents).

The Ganges originates in the Himalayas, so some of the movie takes place in northern India (near Tibet). It travels through the harshest deserts in the world and eventually makes its way to one of the most densly populated regions of the world. The contrasts are amazing.

This is a very well filmed, covered and illustrated documentary about a river that has been revered as sacred in India for ages, but sadly, relegated through the last few decades to almost a drainage for the hundreds of millions for whom it is everything from a washer to a toilet.

Brilliant documentary.....",1323561600,2,450,4.487804878048781
3369841,4,B0014VPFRM,I enjoyed watching these quite a bit.  The footage is amazing and the information presented is intriguing and mostly relevant.  I found the episode about the delta to be the most interesting.  What detracts from the presentation is the narrator's frequent reverential mention of spirituality and mysticism.  I don't find this quaint or enriching of the content presented.  It's just silly.,1319328000,,389,5.311475409836065

3369843,5,B0014VPFRM,"I had seen this series on television but the blu-ray release is simply stunning. The premise of the story is simple - follow the Ganges from source to delta - and it is the intermingling of people and wildlife that makes the programmes so compelling. Sometimes the interaction can be uplifting - the fisherman feeding the baby otter - and sometimes quite depressing - the tigers that are forced into smaller and smaller spaces to survive. The high definition format brings every whisker and snowflake into sharp relief as well as providing breathtaking views of the mountains and the river valley. Admittedly, some shots - like those of the snow leopard - were not in high definition but, for me, that just reflected the reality of the rareness of these creatures. Up until a few years ago, there was no film of them at all. The extras are interesting (all in normal definition). The montage of deleted extras was mesmerising and the story of filming the emaciated tiger quite heartbreaking. If you like BBC nature then this disc is one you will enjoy - the narrative is compelling, the wildlife fascinating, and the quality of picture superb.",1266969600,9,1143,4.807106598984771

3369845,5,B0014VPFRM,"This is a wonderful visual and sensory delight that not only entertains but also depicts every facet of Ganges and to some extend the people around it.
Documentary is divided into three distinct parts. First part depicts the inception of Ganges, the glaciers that fuel it, the religious believes that surrounds it origins. Second part depicts the 1500 mile run though the Indian plains and the final part explores the delta when Ganges merges into ocean.

Throughout the run the documentary also discusses flora and fauna around the Ganges, people who live around it and how they are dependent on it, perils that animals (who are dependent on river) are facing in the wild. All this knowledge is packed with wonderful cinematography, panoramic shots and an equally potent sound track.

Only thing that I believe missing in the documentary or perhaps could have been added as an extra feature is the dangers that the river (also the life who lives around it) is being exposed to due to over pollution and over consumption.

Nevertheless, this is definitely recommended for all.",1254700800,3,1076,4.966666666666667
3369846,5,B0014VPFRM,This disk not only has beautiful pictures but also a fabulous story line.  It is as much about the people of the area as it is about the nature.  Very nice combination.,1252800000,,168,4.21875
3369847,4,B0014VPFRM,"I recently got a 50"" plasma (panasonic G10) and a blu-ray player (panasonic 60) and I wanted to test out all the blu-rays that supposedly had the best picture quality. These nature docs have been considered some of the best.

GALAPAGOS = 4-Star Blu-Ray Video / 2-Star Nature Doc

The video is good, but not great like a pristine movie transfer like Sin City or Kung-Fu Panda. I found this nature doc particularly boring. It has a few nice bits, but there's lots of repetition of shots, and wildlife just isn't as interesting as the other docs. I would only reccomend this if you're super super super interesting in learning about Galapagos.

GANGES = 4-Star Blu-ray Video / 3-Star Nature Doc

Video quality is about the same as Galapagos, good, but there's a lot better. This nature doc is a lot more interesting than Galapagos, more magic shots, better tid bits, a more emotional experience. This is worth checking out for the content.

PLANET EARTH = 4.5-Star Blu-ray Video / 4-Star Nature Doc

This is a fantastic video transfer, better than Galapagos and Ganges. By better, I mean, richer blacks, deeper colors, sharper detail. All around, a step up. This is a four disc experience. I think they put all their best content on the first disc. Seriously, the first disc was thrilling, the others were a huge step down, in terms of locations and wildlife. Maybe it's a weird personal preference thing, but I watched the first disc three times, but could barely get through the others. I would say disc one is a must see.

BARAKA = 5-Star Blu-ray Video / 5-Star Nature Doc

This wins the Super Shiny Titanium Standard Award for best video and best nature doc. It was shot on 70mm and transfered to, like, quad-HD digital. This is one of the very best blu-rays ever made. It holds up against all new releases, because the source was 70mm. And this nature doc seemed the most magical. If you want to get a good demo disc, to show to any audience, this is the one. And the Baraka experience sticks with you. I can see myself watching this quite a few times in the years ahead, just for the experience.",1250208000,17,2098,4.576

I know I may never find anything that will match Planet Earth BBC (it's just that awesome!) but I was pleased with Ganges. I enjoyed seeing the different social groups and how they use the river in their farming and religious communities. If you enjoy seeing nature as it was meant to be seen (with the exception of in-person) then you will enjoy Ganges.

3369862,3,B0014VPFRM,"Iam very disaapointed after watching the DVD.
I bought this DVD expecting that it shows more about the
Ganges and it's religious importance and covers more about
the religios places Badrinath, Rudra Payaga, Rishikesh,
Haridwar, Varanasi and so on. It mentioned little about it
and more towards the species around the Ganges basin.
It skipped fully Patna big city next to Ganges, and coverd full
episode about Sunderban and tigers.
It should have coverd 2 episodes from It's origin to Varansi,
and 1 episode from varanasi thru it's journey towards Patna,
Howrah and Bay of bengal.
That aspect I disappointed, but the production quality wise
it's fantastic and very scenic.

If you are looking for species and animals next to Ganges
basin this DVD is for you. If you are looking at religious
angle this is not for you.",1240185600,21,816,4.870503597122302

3369865,5,B0014VPFRM,"We just watched Ganges a few weeks ago and were blown away. We are Indian and the people we invited to see the film were Indian as well, so this was especially relavent to us.

The documentary overall was quite good, it not only focused on the physical aspects of the river (how it effects the environment) but its spiritual significance as well. The photography in this film is amazing.

The Blu-ray presentation was stunning, and the level of detail and color was really heightened. It really made the documentary come to life. And surprisingly for a documentary, the DTS track was quite good, and the narration and music did a good job enhancing the experience. I don't think we would be as involved in the events if we were watching it on DVD.

Anyone interested in India or history in general should check this out!

These are also the best movies to showcase a really big screen. My daughter is in 4th grade and these titles are all compelling to her (as well as her parents).

The Ganges originates in the Himalayas, so some of the movie takes place in northern India (near Tibet). It travels through the harshest deserts in the world and eventually makes its way to one of the most densly populated regions of the world. The contrasts are amazing.

8256395,2,B0014VPFRM,"Excellent footage and commentary at times. I do not know who is the author of commentary on religion though. The producers (and the narrator seems to be a person with Indian accent) are dishing out utter non-sense regarding Hinduism (Sanatna Dharma). These producers and / or script writers are the ones who do not understand Hindu religion and/or Sanatana Dharma. At one point the narration is like this (quoting verbatim): ""The animist origins of the religion ensures animals a powerful role in Hindu belief""

At one point trying to praise Muslim invasion of Bharat varsha by bloody Moguls, the narrator, compares Hindus to Muslims and claims that Moguls had better scientific know how (and praises the Moguls heritage) ""Their scientific heritage compelled them to understand and master it"".  Now, to be fair, Moguls might have had better weapons and the desert culture of ""kill or conquer"", but certainly not scientific mind or achievement. Here is where the biases of the producer (or script writer) sets a negative tone degrading Hindus. And this is unacceptable, to me, because it not a correct interpretation.

It appears to me that these producers or script writers are totally against Hindu beliefs (at least they come across so naive or completely misinformed). To me they are ultra liberals trying to defame Hindu faith. And they (DVD) show this village where the snakes freely roam about and nobody kills it. What is that got to do with Ganga (Ganges)? I feel, the producers are deliberately putting footage to embarrass the average Hindu.  If there is any faith / religion (way of life) that values life (not just human life), then it is found in India. Rest of the world is always talking ""conquer or kill"" And the animals are food objects, for many, almost all Westerners, Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese.

There is another set of people (more population that India), the other side of Himalayas, who eat anything that moves - do they value animal life? What about some others who eat dogs? Hindus belief/faith is based on shastra knowledge and that knowledge comes from the wisdom of Sages and is based on observation, inference, logical deduction and verification (darshana shastra)

Here are some other counter points (that should educate non-Hindus, so that they do not form negative image of Hindus)

1. Arabs took number system from Bharat Varsha (called India now). It is clear and documented
2. Arabs took lot of scientific knowledge regarding astronomy to their people (clearly documented)
3. Hindu beliefs/faith is based on shastras (knowledge of Sages). Monkey and elephant are really intelligent mammals and they are the only two other mammals (after humans) that use hand to eat food. Others animals directly put their mouth to food. Read Puranas to understand why animals are important and why we Hindus see God's creation in an ant, elephant and humans. And during Ramayana times monkeys played a key role in helping Sri Rama. There are many many reasons why Monkey and Elephants are revered by Hindus in Puranas. Now, whether Hindus treat these animals with respect, in the current time period,  in a different question. There are 1000s of people who abuse animals all over - whale hunting for example.

4. I can give 100s of examples to prove how science (shastra knowledge) of Hindus are their belief system and both are one at the same. Read Vivekachudamani to even understand the scientific definition of God (Brahman). There is no religion or culture that has gone into so much depth to understand ""who am I"" , ""where do I come from""

5. Read Garuda Purana - this is the encyclopedia of Hindu Religion. This is the praise that British professors have said about Hindus. And see the amount of astronomy, science  embedded in the Puranas.",1466985600,,3770,4.958795562599049
