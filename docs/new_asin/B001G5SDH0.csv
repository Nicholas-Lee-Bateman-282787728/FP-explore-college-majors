8303932,1,B001G5SDH0,"I am unsure who the makers of this DVD is but they need to make it clear that this is an 80's video.  The dvd does not seem very professional grade and looks as if this was done somewhere overseas. The cover is updated but the video looks as if someone found this in the archives.

The people are all dressed in what ""was hot"" back in 86 and is not up to date with current excercise.  I was so disappointed that I started it out 20 minutes and simply did not like it.  Excercise has come a long way and you want something current since we have learned a lot about what works, techniques not to do so you don't hurt yourself and something to hold your interest.

I have another one I purchased from this same dvd family and they all look as if they are made the same way.  Do not let the cover fool you into thinking this is something current.

I will not buy anything from this series again.",1263168000,8,891,4.086206896551724
