8371340,5,B002JAHNKY,"This Australian Discovery Channel program follow's Mike Archer's ""Thylacine project,"" an attempt to obtain DNA of the extinct Tasmanian tiger (Thylacine), and use that DNA to clone the species back into existence.  This is one of several efforts in the ""de-extinction"" movement.  Efforts are being made to bring back the passenger pigeon, the Pyrenees Ibex, the wooly mammoth, and the thylacine.  This superb documentary discusses how somatic cell nuclear transplantation may work to bring extinct species back.  It also explains certain challenges that must be overcome.  Of course, such efforts have ethical overtones.  They are also sensitively discussed.

While La Clonacion Del Tigre is in Spanish, but there is an English option on the DVD.  You don't want to miss this program.",1442361600,,784,5.368852459016393
8371341,4,B002JAHNKY,"I didn't see a Spanish language version of this doc; I saw an English language one.  That's fine as I think the original show was in English.
A researcher finds an old tiger fetus in a bottle and wants to know if its DNA can be extracted and it can be cloned.  Before I speak of the program, I'd like to speak about the researcher.  His accent was not a thick Australian one.  It almost sounded American.  I wonder if he's a Mel Gibson type that spent so much time in both countries that he has bits of both.  This researcher was no Crocodile Dundee.
I liked that the show admitted and stressed that it was Australian humans' fault for this animal's extinction.  (Really, they should say ""Western man"" and make clear that it was not the Tasmanian indigenous people that killed this animal off.)  The animal was blamed for sheep killing when there was little proof of that.  The zoo owning the last living example just threw it in the garbage after it died.  The animal existed into the 1930s.  This is not the dodo bird or other animals that colonizers had no way to preserve.
This show seemed a lot like that documentary on the frozen wooly mammoth baby.  People who like the idea of bringing species back may want to see ""Star Trek IV"" and its biodiversity message.
The program uses cheap CGI to show how the tiger may have moved.  That made the show more interesting to watch.  However, I think it could leave the impression that the species is still alive.  There are several zoos out there that give more space to exhibitions with mechanical dinosaurs, rather than focus on resources to protect and display living species.  Yes, the CGI is more user-friendly than black-&-white photos, but there was a cheesiness factor here.
The animal is called tiger due to its stripes.  However, it was a marsupial and resembled a dog mostly.  They bring up the issue of convergence and this may be a reason to show this program in junior high and high school biology classes.  The show said Australia was once connected to Antarctica.  I know about Pangaea, but I had never heard of that fact before.
The program doesn't mention what animal would be the surrogate mother until the end.  The narrator says a Tasmanian devil could carry the cloned animal.  However, maybe the mother would be freaked about giving birth to something not like itself.  Human mothers would not want to gestate a chimpanzee, y'know.  I wondered if a female devil would reject the offspring, rather than warm it in its pouch and provide pap, aka doodoo.
The program mentions Dolly the sheep often.  They speak of other hybrid animals.  They admit that much natural habitat has been destroyed in Tasmania.  The show reveals that drawings of the tiger are everywhere.  To me, this shows the fallacy of how humans don't appreciate other creatures until they are endangered or gone.",1373414400,,2847,4.651302605210421
