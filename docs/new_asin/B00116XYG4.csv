3062679,5,B00116XYG4,"One thing the South Koreans can do, being a very computer oriented society, is remaster dvds.  These ten dvds are as good as available anywhere of these titles.  And you no longer have to go through the bother of choosing the English soundtrack from the menu.  All the dvds are defaulted to English (without any subtitles) so a pre-schooler can use them.  Full length with the original soundtracks - great picture fidelity.  A great value.",1203897600,13,439,4.8
3062680,4,B00116XYG4,"This DVD set is a great deal for people who just want the movies! We don't need the extra features disks, all the paper advertising, or the ""collectible"" platinum editions, etc.  All we wanted was the movies, and that's what we have. These were produced for Korea (and the packaging has Korean print along with English) but they are playable here.  All you have to do is set the language and subtitles to English instead of the default Korean.  They are the genuine Disney movies and soundtracks, just as you would expect.  Another great bonus is the slim case, holding 10 movies in the space of about 3 DVD cases.",1203638400,17,614,4.554545454545455

Wanting to share the unforgettable memory of experiencing the wonderful world of Disney animation for the first time, I bought the Walt Disney Classic Animation Collection for our grand-daughter who is just 2 years old. She loves the tales and the characters. I am very happy with the purchase and glad it was delivered as promised.",1246752000,,928,7.601851851851852
8240831,1,B00116XYG4,"I think that this is horrible. I ordered this DVD set for my daughter's first birthday and i get something i can't understand. The website did not make it clear that it is in Korean. When i order something from America and from an American website i would think that i would be able to understnad the language being spoke. Very untrue. If it said next to the picture that they are selling you, that it was in Korean, this would not have been an issue. My daughter would like to thank Amazon.com for robbing her of a birthday present. Good Job.",1244937600,,543,4.333333333333333
8240832,1,B00116XYG4,"This was HORRIBLE and I'm still trying to get a refund.  I had to select one star to review it, but I'd rather have the option of 5 lemons! The set is dubbed in Korean, and all of the menus are in Korean script as well.  I wanted to show these to my grandchildren (someday) but this is useless.  The picture on Amazon's website definitely showed this to be in english, but it's not!  My advice, save yourself lots of $, time and trouble!",1242086400,2,437,4.166666666666667
8240833,5,B00116XYG4,I bought this for my grand children and they love it.  My son said it is easy to use even thought the default is Korean.  I would recommend this product to others,1236556800,,162,4.03125
8240834,3,B00116XYG4,"NOTE: Primary language in Korean. Option 2 is English.

We bought these for road trips, but half won't play in our factory installed Honda DVD player. I decided not to return them but to keep half in the Honda and the other half at home where they play fine.

The menu is Korean, so rather than search through it for the language options, hit the language button on your remote to toggle between Korean and English. The original track was English and the sound quality is better than the Korean.

If you don't have a language button on your remote, you may want to think twice before buying this set!",1235001600,2,600,4.4363636363636365
8240835,3,B00116XYG4,"I'm not faulting the company for this but someone in a previous review said that the DVD's were set to English by default but this is not the case.  You must choose english each time you put the DVD's in.  Also this is minor but each of the 3 DVD's we watched in entirety Peter Pan, Bambi and Fun and Fancy free had a glitch about 5 or so minutes into each one where it skipped forward about a minute or more.  Not a huge deal but just something I noticed.  I have returned mine because I was under the impression that they were set to default english otherwise they are a great set.",1217980800,10,583,4.087719298245614
8240836,5,B00116XYG4,"This Korean releases  are still a great bargain for all the movies that you get. the picture quality is superb and they still come in a beautiful slim design box set.  If you don't mind using the MENU button on your remote control to change the language and/or subtitles, then you wil not have any problems.  They are still  the original releases, All-regional DVD's.",1215993600,,367,4.6875
8240837,5,B00116XYG4,"This ten-DVD gift box set is an excellent value for the money.  It is disconcerting to open the box because the language on the box is not in English!  However, not to worry; all the cuts are in English, are clean, and the selections include many of the best Disney offerings.",1209427200,,276,4.392156862745098
