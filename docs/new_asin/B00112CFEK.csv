8563299,5,B00112CFEK,"Another excellent release from Tai Seng. With more of a Martial Arts emphasis in this series than is some of their other productions,
this series stands out primarily due to the excellent film direction and superbly cohesive cast assembled for this production.
Highly recommended for fans of the genre!",1254268800,6,302,5.183673469387755
