1862496,3,B00008V2X2,"For learning about West Point, this DVD is most useful, mainly because it seems to be the only video series about the Military Academy.  But the potential viewer should know it has flaws.  The predominanting emphasis on women cadets is inappropriate.  The amount of time given to rants and whining by cadets is excessive--yeah, we know it's tough, but how many times do we have to hear the same complaints?  In one case, I was actually hoping that one young lady would quit her griping and just quit.  Good points include the interviews with graduates, especially recent ones who have gone into dangerous situations, where the West Point experience pays off.  This is a good series that probably is worth your time.",1105056000,22,715,4.819672131147541
1862497,4,B00008V2X2,"Dated, but informative.  This series was filmed in 2001.  We have a kid preparing for West Point.  This step by step guid to the first day is still very much worth seeing.",1454284800,,171,4.28125
1862498,4,B00008V2X2,"It was informative. Outdated, but helped.",1434326400,,41,6.0
1862499,5,B00008V2X2,"Since my daughter is going to West Point, this gave us a good insight of what she will be going through. My younger daughter also enjoys watching it with her! So happy I bought this disc!!!",1432771200,,189,4.277777777777778

1862503,4,B00008V2X2,"This series of one half hour shows gives a very vivid picture of what young first year West Point cadets go through.  I had no idea that the demands on them were that great.  It is admirable to see the determination and dedication of these young people as they strive to be accepted into West Point, and as they struggle to remain there.  It gives you a very real sense of the quality of our Army leaders and why their character is so strong.  I think every young person in High School should see this series and discuss it.  It would help many to appreciate their country and it would give others an idea of what character really means.  It would challenge many to rise above themselves and to achieve their potential.",1412121600,,719,4.409090909090909
1862504,5,B00008V2X2,I enjoyed this immensely. You get to become familiar with several cadets who return throughout the season. Excellent!,1405209600,,117,5.555555555555555
1862505,4,B00008V2X2,"This documentary series follows West Point Candidates from their first day at the Academy until Graduation. I am still watching the series but so far, it appears to cover the details of their daily lives well.",1389398400,,209,4.833333333333333
1862506,5,B00008V2X2,I just watched the first episode and it is very interesting but one episode is just too short. for me.,1388793600,,102,4.15
1862507,5,B00008V2X2,Very informative! Let's you see how things really are at West Point. Those cadets are tough! My  daughter still wants  to attend.,1382659200,,129,4.818181818181818
1862508,5,B00008V2X2,"It appeared to be an honest portrayal, despite the fact that the presence of cameras may alter behavior.  I learned a lot about West Point from this series.  The only thing lacking was an update on how the persons shown fared in the following months/years.",1377820800,,256,4.666666666666667
1862509,5,B00008V2X2,"Although I'm sure some procedures have changed since this was filmed in 2001, I found the leadership training techniques and daily structure informative for a future parent of a cadet.",1369526400,,184,5.166666666666667
1862510,1,B00008V2X2,"WOW!  This DVD really gave me a personal tour of what it takes to become a cadet...  I really enjoyed this although I found myself sometimes very exhausted watching it.  These young men and women went through a lot but to be the best...you have to work at it and give your all.  Good documentary...worth owning.  As a veteran, I am always interested in knowing more about how we train troops and officers and this was worth the watching.",1366329600,,437,4.481012658227848
1862511,4,B00008V2X2,"When my grandson found out that he was selected to attend West Point, we sent this to him. He did watch it but later told me that a lot of the information was dated. He also added that NOTHING can prep a plebe for West Point.",1365120000,,225,3.9130434782608696
1862512,5,B00008V2X2,"Made during 2001 - just before and after 9/11 - this series gives you a sneak peek into the very competitive West Point lifestyle.  Hats off to everyone who has graduated there, I have a new found respect for their accomplishments.  5 stars.",1360886400,,241,4.5813953488372094
1862513,5,B00008V2X2,"My daughter will be attending the USMA and this documentary was an eye opener in what she can expect during her first year.  Anyone interested in West Point should watch this video.  Although it was made over a decade ago, I believe not too much has changed.  At the end of the video, I was rooting for all the cadets they profiled.  Too bad they never did a follow-up story years later.  Highly recommend this purchase to others that are interested in learning about the history of the school and the training the cadets endure.",1360540800,,529,4.526315789473684

1862515,5,B00008V2X2,"It is a must have for those who are interested in attending West Point. It follows class 2005 from beast till graduation. It shows how our leaders are made, and the hope of this country--there are waves of young men and women willing to sacrifice for this country and for the people.",1358812800,,283,4.461538461538462
1862516,5,B00008V2X2,I love this series because I feel as though it gives me a realistic view of West Point.  I think they've paid way too much attention to the female cadet kept complaining about West Point.  I don't even understand why she stayed and she hated it so much I wish they had spent more time focusing on the other cadets in the series who actually wanted to be at West Point.  I do not the ending because  the story is a cliffhanger with no answers. I wish there was a follow-up story to the series telling us or the cadets are now,1356825600,3,524,4.107843137254902
1862517,5,B00008V2X2,This DVD set is an excellent introduction to West Point for prospective cadets.  It provides a glimpse into what awaits the cadet on Reception Day and thereafter.,1343260800,,162,5.0
1862518,5,B00008V2X2,"Our son is entering West Point this Summer.  As parents we are curious about what to expect, what will it be like?  This video series answers many questions.  It is a few years old (2001), but based on discussions with current cadets very accurate.  So many little questions about what to expect on R day and A day are answered, not only about what will happen with the 'new cadets' (pronounced by everyone in the video as one word ""nuca-det""), but you can see what other parents chose to wear for clothing.  That may seem silly but it is a question the parent of an entering freshman has.

The video covers a full year and shows athletics, scholastics and the military training required.  Because the filming happened to be during the 2001/2002 school year there is a full episode about September 11.

I highly recommend this DVD to the familiy of anyone entering or considering the USMA.  In fact I recommend it for grandparents too.",1240012800,11,935,4.618181818181818
1862519,5,B00008V2X2,Good introduction to plebe life at West Point. Only about 10% is shown on what goes on during Beast Barracks. I was a plebe in 1987.,1223942400,2,132,4.115384615384615
1862520,5,B00008V2X2,This is a great thing for people to see before entering the United States Military Academy.,1210550400,,91,4.75
1862521,5,B00008V2X2,I bought this for my 15yo son who wants to go to West Point. He really enjoyed it and it was a good source to show him what is going to be required of him. I think anyone considering this path should get this.,1197763200,2,209,3.772727272727273
1862522,5,B00008V2X2,This DVD is an intense review of the first year of a cadet's life at West Point. I would recommend this to anyone who knows of someone interested in attending this school.,1178928000,,171,4.375

1862524,4,B00008V2X2,"As a confused high school senior, I found the documentary to be very informative on whether or not West Point is for me.  For anybody in a similar position I highly recommend the series.",1154908800,7,186,4.470588235294118
1862525,3,B00008V2X2,"Too many interviews detract from the reality of West Point.  Enough background footages to show what happens at West Point, but the interviews make those background footage less relevant -Any new cadets should be paying attention to those background footages and try to understand what's happening.",1151625600,2,298,5.478260869565218
1862526,5,B00008V2X2,"I was thrilled to follow this series on West Point as I have a son in his ""plebe"" year and I was not from a millitary background. It was excellent to move through the 4 years at WP and know the challenges he will be up against.",1124928000,16,227,3.851063829787234

7987103,5,B00008V2X2,"Having just visited West Point for the first time a couple of weeks ago, I was very interested in this series, and it did not let me down.  I like the way that the series followed the class of 2006 through its Plebe year, but also showed other cadets in various years of their 4-year program.  It was easy to see what would be awaiting the Plebe class as it went on through its West Point education.  I liked the personal interviews as well as the actual training that was taking place.  I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in the military and/or West Point.",1474416000,2,575,4.296296296296297
7987104,5,B00008V2X2,Have only watched parts so far. I bought all the episodes and anticipate watching it often. My father attended West Point in the thirties. I enjoy any touchstones to his experiences.,1473120000,,182,4.903225806451613

7987108,5,B00008V2X2,"I have heard the name West Point all my life. I knew it was a place where wannabe army officers trained, but that's about it. West Point jumps off the page or TV screen in this documentary. This gives a lot more information than what you'd find in a book. You will experience the environment of being there. I get inspired and motivated everytime I watch this. I've always had great respect for our brave men and women in the service, this further deepens it.",1463356800,,459,4.411764705882353
7987109,1,B00008V2X2,Very old - out of date. Not very relevant for today.,1455667200,,52,3.8181818181818183
7987110,5,B00008V2X2,"As a woman nearing fifty, I don't know why I'm so curious about what goes on behind the doors of the military academies but for some reason I am. I've read several books on the subject, and getting to watch this multi-part documentary was interesting and enjoyable. I liked that they made the documentary from the point of view of the cadets within the walls. Very well done!",1455235200,,375,4.529411764705882
