7871492,2,6304462921,"I am a suviver of Camille.  I was stationed in Biloxi, Miss. when it hit the Gulf Coast.  I remember a great deal of the tragidy and hardship the storm brought and the many tornatoes which came from that storm.  I have  never seen any video which did this storm justice.  However, I do realize  that the videos and equipment were not available at this time to collect  this data.  This video is about as good as any for what footage can be  found.  Much more footage is available for later storms which were not as  sever as Camille but did more costly damage due to the massive increase in  populations and realistate of later times.",961718400,,634,4.370689655172414
