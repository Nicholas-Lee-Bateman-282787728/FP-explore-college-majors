8265355,5,B001781JQI,"I love these guys. They take stunts to a whole new level. They set standards. They are extremely entertaining. This DVD is short, but good. I love that Johnny decided to grace us with his usually hilarious presence. Definitely worth buying. I still get wound up even after having already seen it a few times.",1363737600,,308,4.618181818181818

8265358,5,B001781JQI,"My husband loved Evel Knievel, and when he saw this was coming out I just had to get it for him.  He loved it.  He is a huge extreme sport fan, and to see that Mat Hoffman did the tribute was an added plus.  If you are a huge Evel Knievel fan you should have this in your collection.  Great product!!!",1275868800,,301,3.8852459016393444
8265359,5,B001781JQI,"This movie is great! It shows awesome stunts and is a tribute to one of the world's most famous daredevils. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Mat Hoffman, Travis Pastrana, Johnny Knoxville, or other extreme sports athletes.",1268438400,2,231,4.948717948717949
8265360,4,B001781JQI,"This is a great video.  I'm a huge Nitro Circus fan, so this was right up my alley.  When I heard about it, I thought, wow! with that lineup there's no way I'll regret the hefty price tag.  I don't want to spoil it for anybody, but I was a little disappointed at the length of the film.  When I watched it, I enjoyed it so it seemed to go by quickly, but it felt a little too quick, and it was.  Don't make the mistake of expecting this to measure up to the nitro circus series, but you won't be disappointed if you are looking for a close second.  I kinda feel sorry for matt hoffman because his idea was great and his plans were huge, but nothing seemed to go right.  Bad weather, injuries, etc. resulted in a film where nothing spectacular happens.  If they broke the distance record for a motorcycle jump or even if TP landed another backflip it would have been amazing.",1223942400,2,874,4.191616766467066
