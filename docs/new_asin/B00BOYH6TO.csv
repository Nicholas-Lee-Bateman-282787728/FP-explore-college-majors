8572042,5,B00BOYH6TO,"This is a Korean film (subtitled) about a young rocker who is recruited by an entertainment company to train as a Trot singer.  Trot is a popular genre of music in  South Korea.  To compare Trot to something American, it's crooning; the kind of music that Michael Buble sings.  Most of the movie is spent watching this kid resist because he absolutely abhors the genre.  This movie is a comedy.  It's nothing deep or dramatic.  It's just a very fun, sweet, refreshing, feel-good comedy. I'd recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys light fair and just wants to be entertained and laugh.  For Americans, don't be concerned that it's a Korean film, it's easily relatable.",1374883200,,671,4.773913043478261
