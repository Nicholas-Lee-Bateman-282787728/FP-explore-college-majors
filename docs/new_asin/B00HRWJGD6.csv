6201373,4,B00HRWJGD6,"Tommy has been dissected ad nauseaum and any real rock fan will find this fantastic documentary a lot of rehash - nothing revelatory or new here.

Still, this is a very good music documentary that thoroughly explores this wonderful piece of music/pop culture from many angles. Fantastic looking on BluRay as well.",1404777600,,313,5.019230769230769
6201374,4,B00HRWJGD6,"I was not sure if I should get this DVD, there are so many Who documentary's out there on DVD but they are all good. I decided to take the plunge. This is a detailed look at the album with Pete Townshend giving us his deep thoughts into the making and meaning of Tommy. There are also comments from Roger and posthumously from John and Keith Moon.  There are a lot of music footage included and what impressed me is the fact the producers of this DVD were kind enough to include mostly full performances of these classic songs from various concerts. Some of the footage rare and not seen before.
It is an enjoyable show throughout and well paced. Pete's an extraordinary man and his vision of Tommy is well told here.
The bonus footage is a TV special the Who did in Germany in 1969 highlighting the best songs from Tommy like a long music clip in B&W unfortunately. It would be far better in colour.

Overall a worthy DVD if you love the Who.",1401580800,11,943,4.322033898305085
6201375,5,B00HRWJGD6,I have the Multi channel super audio CD of 'Tommy' and this series always expands on the making of an album and in my opinion they did and excellent job of presenting it!,1401235200,,170,4.181818181818182
6201376,5,B00HRWJGD6,"One of the best albums of the Sixties gets an in depth Documentary with interviews from Townsend, Daltrey, and Stamp (along with stock interview footage from Entwistle, Moon and Lambert), all explaining how this record came to be. An act of desperation by Townsend that was one of the few "" Concept "" albums that actually worked. LSD, Pinball and Spirituality in the guise of Meher Baba, sexual abuse at the hands of his grand mother, and the need for an album to actually sell the driving forces behind Townsend's masterpiece. Daltrey adopting the persona of "" Tommy "" and becoming one of Rock and Roll's greatest front men, it's all covered here in great style. Now how about giving "" Beggars Banquet "" or "" Sgt. Pepper's "" the same treatment?",1398124800,,745,4.651515151515151
6201377,5,B00HRWJGD6,"This Blu-ray is required viewing for Who fans. Interviews with Pete, Roger and John are worth the price of admission. As a bonus you get The Who at the Beat Club footage from 1969.",1397779200,2,180,4.323529411764706
6201378,5,B00HRWJGD6,Every Who fan would love this video. Tommy fans must see/hear this video. It has plenty of music and also descriptions of the times when it was made. Pete insight into trying to make hit videos was interesting. He said there top hits were not number one and they were as good as they could make. Something different was needed. Therefore we get Tommy and Quadrophenia. I am very happy with those results.,1397174400,,404,4.5479452054794525
6201379,5,B00HRWJGD6,"This DVD was excellent and far exceeded my expectations. This DVD and the Eagle rock Classic Album DVD ""The making of Who's Next ""are a must have for any die hard WHO fan!!",1396742400,6,172,4.242424242424242
6201380,5,B00HRWJGD6,"Great DVD and a wonderful insight into the making of ""THE"" classic rock opera!!  There's always a story behind the music, and this DVD provides that story.",1396569600,,155,4.7407407407407405
6201381,3,B00HRWJGD6,"This thing has little or nothing about the Music and has very little music at all included ,a classic Lp Tommy would have been better",1394928000,7,133,4.36
6201382,5,B00HRWJGD6,"This is another fine original documentary going direct to DVD and BD from Eagle Rock Entertainment. Though the copyright at the end of the (approx) 90 minute documentary says 2013, it is not being released until March 11, 2014. With an additional 32 minutes of ""Bonus material""  (more on that in a minute) there is nearly two hours of material here to delight any fan of The Who, especially fans of their rock opera ""Tommy"".

Every living person connected with the project is interviewed here, from really lengthy, insightful comments by Pete Townshend, who concieved of the idea and wrote nearly all the songs and Roger Daltrey (the lead singer who admits to life being harder after ""Tommy "" was released and the Who started playing 120,000 seat stadiums). Archival interviews from the late John Entwhisle are here as well. The artist who designed the Lp jacket, the sound  engineer and the group's manager during this period are here also. There comments from Townshend's biographer, critic Anthony Decurtis (who seems to be interviewed in nearly every rock doc I've seen) and Jann Wenner, the cocky founder of Rolling Stone. And there are clips from many performances of the opera. It was truly - as the film's title says - a ""sensation"".

The bonus material consists of eight songs from ""Tommy"" as well interview segments from a 1969 episode of the German TV pop/rock show ""Beat Club"". It's in  black and white and BC always used weird video effects to give things a ""psychedelic"" touch. Still, a nice bonus.

The images and sound on the BD are great. The BC material probably looks just as great on the DVD version.
As I said above, this is something all Who fans will want to see and own.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8635074,5,B00HRWJGD6,"This film gives an account of how Tommy came to be. Many of the interviews are done with Townshend and Daltrey in recent years. However, John  Entwhistle and Keith Moon also share their own perspectives as well. Any Who fan will enjoy this film. The greatest highlight in the film is the rare concert footage and the interviews with the band as the idea of the rock opera was being developed. A must for any true fan of The Who.",1458950400,,428,4.35

8635080,4,B00HRWJGD6,"I would give this 5 stars as a reveiw of the album ""TOMMY"" , but I would liked to have heard more about the band trying to live up to the the album , the Tommy film and the play . This album was the turning point of The Who and this bio does a great job at explaining it .Pete and Roger give recent interveiws , John and Keith archival . The bluray picture and sound quality are fantastic (as expected) . I would have liked to hear more of the music in between interveiws but this is a bio and not a music video . Roger Daltrey is never used enough in these Who documenturies , as he gives the best insights into how the band interpets Pete's songs . He is also able to take a step back and critique The Who as a fan . I would also liked if they covered more on the the movie Tommy , as I have heard conflicting reports that members of the band either hated the movie or loved  Ken Russell's interpretation . Anyway , I would highly recommend this film to any fan of The Who .",1404864000,4,976,3.9045226130653266
