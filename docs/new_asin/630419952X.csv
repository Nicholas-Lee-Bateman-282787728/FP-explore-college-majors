813726,4,630419952X,"Robert Wuhl stars in this pungent comedy which is also scripted and directed by him, and few sacred cows of any shapes or sizes remain safe as he casts himself as Stuart Sain, a somewhat naive tour guide for the Fielding Ratings Service, which tracks the television viewing habits of specially chosen American population segments and where a computer malfunction has caused a cellar-dwelling public broadcasting station to fallaciously leapfrog to the top of the rankings. Wuhl serves up an effective pastiche, rather than satire, of the television industry and its program selection process, as well as of a large grouping of liberal archetypes, including the vocation of drug rehabilitation, pertinent as Stuart's wife Cary, played nicely by Maggie Han, is a rehab counselor, while also relentlessly taking aim at organized religion. Although a fair amount of the humour is rather tasteless, and repeated looks at a targeted subject generally fall flatly, Wuhl's main concern is hypocrisy, and his wit is often enough on the mark to make of the work a pleasing affair; it is well-edited, with an enlivening score by Marvin Hamlisch, and a fine performance is provided by Gailard Sartain as the mandarin of the largest commercial network.",1112572800,,1239,5.169154228855722

But this movie stands amongst his roles because, in addition to being his usual character in this movie, he has writer and director credit as well.  Not bad all in all!  It's got some great jokes and some very memorable characters.  Gailard Sartain (another Hollywood Knights alum) has a great role in the movie.  His character is responsible for some of the better zingers in the film.

Overall, I'd have to say I was VERY, VERY IMPRESSED!!!

7865581,4,630419952X,"Actually, it's a very funny movie. It's over-the-top, and it's meant to be. Thoroughly entertaining.

I was tempted to give it 5 stars just to get the rating up from the abysmal reviews it has received here, thanks to the straight-laced crowd. But then I remembered the spirit of the movie, which emphasizes personal integrity, so I refrain. The movie in fact has minimal nudity and bad language. But apparently there is some confusion about the moral-code ratings (G, PG, R, X) that the film industry has to dance to these days. A hint seems called for: If you are utterly opposed to flashes of nudity and occasional expletives, don't choose an R movie; it's R for a reason. Certainly not violence--that just rates a PG. I paraphrase Jack Nicholson (and I read the quote so long ago that I have to paraphrase): if you kiss a tit, it's X; if you cut it off with a sword, it's PG. You can extrapolate from that to understand the other codes.

No movie this good should be criticized on the grounds that it fits its rating.",1446508800,4,1021,4.513513513513513
7865582,4,630419952X,"The genre is Comedy-Satire.  The numbers game, dangers of ""data-driven"" decision making that now determines not only policies for governance and education but ethics and the work culture are taken on tongue in cheek.  Irreconcilable issues with survey data, collection methods,  validity and authenticity make for a positive ""laugh at  oneself"" and the limitations of feeding off information drawn from the enthroning of statistics derived from the mathematical certainty of  ""convergence to the mean"" (common denominator).

The story was stupid and shallow enough that wading through its deepest parts will leave your feet completely dry.  The acting was awful, just about what you'd expect from big names like Barry Flatman, Gailard Sartain and Helen Shaver.  I got about half-way through the film before I felt compelled to stop it and warn others not to travel this bumpy road to regret.",1415059200,,480,4.901234567901234
