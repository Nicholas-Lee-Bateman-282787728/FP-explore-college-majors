6197683,3,B00HQI72S2,"The anime was wonderful. Great series, very well done. But I think that the prices for the Blu-ray are pretty shockly high (this is common for import anime, but still just because it is common does not mean we should accept it). Since this is considered a niche product, the industry thinks it can charge whatever it wants. If I want the entire collection (2 Blu-Ray sets) I have to shell out over 120.00 USD? No thanks. I'll wait for 1 complete set for around 50-60 USD.

I am willing to pay to support the anime industry and to show what we like here in the US, but there is a limit to the crazy prices I'm willing to pay.",1398902400,4,624,4.2
6197684,5,B00HQI72S2,"DISCLAIMER: This is a review of the actual anime, not the physical product that you will be obtaining. I HAVE NOT purchased this blu-ray yet, but I would like to share my opinion of what the anime itself is like. I cannot comment on the number of episodes in this collection, nor the dubbing (as I enjoy my animes subbed). That is all.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Several people have written this anime off because of the characters' age, because of the ""romance"" labelling, and the general high-school slice of life vibe it supposedly emits. They couldn't be more wrong.

Does it have 12 year olds? Yes. Does it have romance? Yes, even some homosexuality. Does it employ the high school trope? Yes, it does. But, if that's the only thing you like, then contend yourself with looking at the box-art, and don't bother watching the anime.

And if those things are what turn you off about an anime, then hide the box cover and enjoy the anime. It deals with mature topics such as what it means to be human, what values communities and general society holds as most important, and the general relationship between the individual and authority. There will be blood, there will be betrayal, there will be strong stances taken on the relationship between those in power and those who are subjected, and there will be tears. Many, many, tears.

I watched this anime as it was coming out. I believe you can view it legally on Crunchyroll. A few comments I would like to make:

Content things:
- The characters are all familiar. But the relationships between them and between the group and other collectives/factions and characters really fleshes them out and makes them enjoyable.
- Plot is amazing. It's got horror, mystery, action... Definitely not as cutesy as a lot of people make it out to be.
- There are a few time skips. I don't personally mind them, but others absolutely hate them.

Technical things:
- The animation quality seems to ebb between absolutely gorgeous to the absolute bare-minimum  during quick or more action-oriented sequences. That being said, backgrounds are consistently beautiful, and some of the more ""trippy"" episodes have a remarkable and bold style that I absolutely loved.
- The music is absolutely great. The ending theme, ""Wareta Ringo"", accompanied by the ending cinematic, is absolutely wonderful, and probably my favorite ending theme. Then again, I don't bother to listen to most ending themes. But I watched them here. Every single time.",1396742400,15,2467,4.90167865707434
8634339,4,B00HQI72S2,I got this thinking I was getting the entire series. I guess I didn't read the title closely enough or it changed.,1530921600,,114,4.2272727272727275
8634340,5,B00HQI72S2,"Masterpiece presented in dark, gory, and suffocating ways..",1501632000,,59,6.5
8634341,5,B00HQI72S2,I saw the anime before buying the Blu-Ray. It's everything I expected it would be! :),1438646400,,85,4.375
8634342,5,B00HQI72S2,"Everyone's taste differs so here's mine - i like stories with secrets where horrible things happen to characters you care about. In anime that includes Higurashi, Another and Madoka Magika (and maybe Day Break Illusion if it didn't have a cop out happy ending). Include manga and you get Monster, Higabana, Corpse Party, Pita Ten and perhaps Cage of Eden and Kekkaishi. Given that background, i LOVE Shinsekai Yori (which i assume means From the New World).

Based on the plot summary, i wasn't going to watch this but multiple people told me to so i did. i guess i owe them drinks. i don't know why they say it's 1,000 years in the future or a utopia or they find relics from the past or any of that. That gives a totally misleading idea of the movie. Here's what's they should have said:

Set in a small town in Medieval Japan populated by gods, children attend schools and temple services where they learn to harness their god powers. The children at these schools tell stories of cats who snatch children away in the night, monsters that hide in the jungle and demons that are immune to their god powers. One group of children, the five 12 year olds of team 1 at Sage Academy, learn that the stories might not be just stories. Over the course of 14 years and 25 episodes, the survivors of that ill-fated team learn that disappearing children, memory manipulation, karma demons and bug rat wars are the least of their problems.

That's what i would have said. Here's what it's actually about:

People get psychic power. A couple decide to become serial killers. War breaks out. Psychics win. Time passes, all traces of modern society disappear and society (all 60,000 surviving members of it) reverts back to a pre-electric state. Cities are run by an ethics committee and children are taught from an early age to learn to control their abilities (fire, levitation, weather manipulation, egg hatching, bottle repairing, etc.) and not hurt people. Ever. At all. These rules don't apply to a slave species, an evolved form of naked molerat, and even though they grovel a lot, annoyed humans tend to make them explode. So that's your setting. Kids in school are divided into groups of five. We meet our heroes (2 girls, 3 boys) when they're 12. They go on a camping trip (a school ritual), break some rules (a huge no-no in this society) and get in trouble, primarily by learning some of the adults' secrets. Then they get trapped in the middle of a war between two bug rat tribes, which is a couple of episodes of war and survival rather than secrets and conspiracies. They survive, make it home and, quite surprisingly, aren't punished too much. Fast forward two years and they're 14 and gay (well, 4 of the 5 are) and spend most of one episode making out. That episode seemed really unnecessary but it's only one episode. Stuff happens, a few more secrets get learned, a bad decision is made and once again they don't get caught and punished. Fast forward 10 years and the ones still alive by this point finally realize why all those rules exist. Needless to say, lots of people die. Lots and lots and lots of people. It's bad. Just goes to show what happens when you show a little mercy and tell a little white lie. Hopefully you haven't grown too attached to anyone at this point.

Spoiler: If someone dies, they die. There are no miraculous revivals or ""i was just faking death"" or ""that was someone else and you just thought it was me"". As with Game of Thrones, this is one of the things that makes this series unlike most anime - dead is dead.

As far as pacing goes, it's about the same as Higurashi or Another. i'm an impatient person and demand explosions every five seconds but for stories like this i'm OK with the time it takes for the story to unfold. Stories with secrets ought to take a little time.

Best i can remember, there's no nudity or bad words. One episode has 10 seconds of tongue kissing that seemed unnecessary. Yes, he likes him, i get it, move on. A lot of the story is talking and creepy shadows but there are periods of violence. Not super gory (this isn't First of the North Star) but you see non-human creatures get twisted, pulled and burst into indistinct liquids (there might be some red blood-looking blood in it but mostly it's that silhouetted, alluded to blood so common in kid anime).

The series is 25 episodes, equivalent to two seasons in Japan (anime there runs in 3 month blocks). Series wraps up, all loose ends are collected (well, except for one question they never explicitly answer, which bugged me), no reason there should be a sequel.

Despite being only 25 episodes (half the length of a full year anime such as Naruto and no longer than a US series such as Buffy or X-Files), the DVDs are divided into two sets. Right now, the price is 80 bucks for both, making this absurdly expensive. It's normal anime pricing (at least until they make a S.A.V.E. bundle) but it's still gallingly expensive. Still, this is one of the few series that maybe is worth that.",1430524800,,5013,4.561111111111111

8634344,5,B00HQI72S2,"One of the best new anime I have ever seen .it has a new C.G. look ( though I prefer hand drawn) but with the old school anime story plot. mostly for older viewers just because of its complex story line , I highly recommend it . A definite must see for any otaku.",1426809600,,263,3.888888888888889
8634345,5,B00HQI72S2,"So when I first started getting into anime, I didn't think it was something that you should take extremely seriously in the social commentary department. Anime is an art form, don't get me wrong, however I feel like this series made me take anime a lot more seriously and it should be in the collection of every anime fan. Just. Wow.

So in short, this anime is set thousands of years ahead of our time in a future where everyone has a supernatural power and the show is about 5 kids who go to school in such a world then grow into adulthood in this same world. However, the protagonist is Saki, a young girl who graduates last in her class and questions the very world around her all throughout the series and has a habit of remembering things her friends do not. One day, they run across a rumored demon artifact and nothing is the same about their lives again.

This anime deals with a lot of different and vast themes like growing up, love, family, conspiracies, the power of knowledge, war, and what it means to even be human. It's beautifully made but the tone is very dark. So much so that the genre of this anime is primarily horror with hints of suspense and drama. In the end, the whole thing makes sense to suggest that this anime was to open up the eyes to the reality of death and murder towards humankind and beyond.

Very visceral, bloody, sad, funny, metaphysical, and all in all just beautiful. Highly, highly recommended. Matter of fact, I demand that it be watched.",1423785600,3,1484,4.448529411764706
8634346,5,B00HQI72S2,"This was an amazing anime series; one of the best I've seen. Set in a post-apocalyptic future it tells the story of several kids as they mature in society with many hidden secrets. This anime explores some deep theme like the consequence of near-absolute power, the meaning and worth of humanity, and the steps that a people undertake to survive.

And yet it doesn't fall into the trap of heavy exposition. You uncover the secrets and the depths of the story a little at a time, grounded by the view of the children forced to confront some horrific ideas and experiences.",1416182400,,571,4.653465346534653

8634348,3,B00HQI72S2,"It was kind of all over the place and just weird in the way the story is laid out and pacing.  Many adult themes but I felt it was catering to a younger crowd at the same time, I watched the dubbed version however. A lot of the visuals and animation was very well done and the best thing about it imo. Only recommended if you want a mystery and something kind of different but not top notch in many ways. I wish I didn't spend $40 on this, maybe worth half that.",1405123200,2,462,3.967741935483871
