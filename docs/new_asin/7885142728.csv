1145730,2,7885142728,"I agree with another reviewer who said that the first minutes of this film grabbed your interest and attention with some bold, train robbery action but then it went downhill from there and I found myself looking at the clock throughout the movie to see how much longer the film would last. I found the premise and plot ( basically Robin Hood in a western style Chinese film) of this movie silly and after awhile the senseless violence of revenge upon revenge only became tedious and repetitive rather than anything interesting. I guess it's supposed to be a black comedy set in 1920s China but most of it I honestly did not find funny.  I guess for me it boiled down to a shallow, nonsensical, silly, violent movie that had some very good cinematography. I read it was the highest grossing movie ever at the cinema in mainland China but their view of what is terrific must differ a lot from mine. Maybe the star power of the famous Chinese actors in this movie drew in the crowds too. The English subtitles seemed hard to read at times as they went by too quickly. This is not a movie I would ever bother to watch again. I give it 2 stars and I'm probably being generous at that. If you must see it rent but do not buy!!!",1335312000,2,1221,4.355263157894737

When bandit chief ""Pocky"" Zhang comes to a remote Chinese village he says he is the new mayor. After things go too far and someone ends up dead a battle for revenge begins between him and Master Huang (Yun-Fat). This is a movie I was actually really looking forward to. The preview looked really good and action packed. The first 15 minutes was great and full of action. Then it started to gradually slow down. The story was very interesting and kept me watching, but it really lost momentum and by the end I was starting to lose interest. I'm not saying this is a bad movie but it was like coasting down a mountain, the closer you get to flatting out the slower you go. This is worth seeing but don't expect excitement all the way through. Overall, a good movie that could have been better I think. I give it a B-.",1334361600,3,960,4.166666666666667
1145732,4,7885142728,"Fast paced, beautifully choreographed, and downright silly, Jiang Wen's Let the Bullets Fly is what you'd get if combining the action and comedy of John Woo and Stephen Chow. Wen, who also co-stars and co-wrote the script, reportedly agonized over the writing to the point where he went through 30 drafts until he finally got it right. While the multiple characters and multiple double-crossings can get a touch convoluted and hard to follow, Wen's film is frequently hilarious and pays homage to classic Hollywood movies better than many Hollywood productions do.

An old school Western at its core, Let the Bullets Fly has the dusty old look of a John Ford film, with Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo also a clear influence. Don't be confused by seeing so many stylistically different directors referenced, as the film mashes up and switches genres at the drop of a hat, making for a wildly off balance experience that is an absolute blast.

Set in 1920s China, the story begins with an expertly staged train robbery by a bandit leader who claims to be the infamous ""Pocky"" Zhang(Jiang Wen). The only people left alive are Tang(Feng Xiaogang), a jittery con man who has bought the governorship of a place called Goose Town after the guy who was supposed to take over died en route. Along with him is the old governor's treacherous wife, now Tang's mistress. Zhang, who sees a chance to earn some real cash in Goose Town, spares Tang's life but assumes his identity as the governor, bringing the weaselly trickster along as his couselor.

Their arrival in Goose Town is met with drums and much celebration, except there's one who isn't so happy to see them make it safely.  The dusty old town, which despite the Asian architecture looks like it's due for a tumbleweed crossing, is already under the iron grip of local gangster named Master Huang(Chow Yun-Fat).  Huang shows his arrogance and ultimate displeasure by only sending his favorite hat to the introduction party, and from there let's just say neither side will be having each other over for tea.

Well, that's not completely true. Huang, who has killed off all of Goose Town's other governors, immediately sees Zhang as a threat and sets out to undermine his authority immediately. Zhang wants to string Huang up by his neck, but not before taking every last bit of his money. Good luck following their often mystifying schemes, as the story seems to have been developed intentionally to leave you scratching your head. Between Huang's goons and Zhang's seven-man squad, all of whom where the same masks at different stages, it's impossible to keep track of what's going on at times. Throw in some body doubles, a fake ""Pocky"" Zhang, and Tang's consistently inconsistent allegiances, and Let the Bullets Fly is often the height of lunacy. Perhaps as a by product of Wen's struggles perfecting the script, he seems a little confused how to wind down such a roller coaster in a sensible way. At 130 minutes, it's too long by about twenty minutes, and with so many swirling subplots a couple of the less important ones could have been cut without damaging the momentum one bit.

And yet it's undeniably fun, and the characters all memorable. Wen, who is as charismatic an actor as he is one of China's elite directors,is the perfect foil to Chow Yun-Fat's scene chewing villainy. The pace is brisk and never slows down, nor do the many homages to other of Wen's many influences. When you can somehow emulate George C. Scott's Patton and still have it make sense you're doing something right. Already the highest grossing production in Chinese history, Wen has an undeniable hit on his hands, one that would fare well if given a chance here in America.",1334361600,13,3701,4.8280757097791795

1145734,4,7885142728,"'Let The Bullets Fly' is a funny, classy, profane Chinese spaghetti western - with rice noodles and hot sour sauce substituting for spaghetti.

The film's humour goes over the top (with CGI assistance), with one of its funniest and most reference-laden scenes of a train holdup by bandits in 1920 warlord China during the first few minutes leading into the titles. The steam railway engine belches smoke, like any fire chariot... but wait, it's being drawn by horses. All that smoke is from the biggest Sichuan hotpot you've ever seen, that almost fills a luxurious private carriage in which a new provincial governor (Ge You), his wife (Carina Lau), and counselor (Feng Xiaogang) are carousing and banqueting as they journey to their new post, protected by a second carriage full of highly alert Republican guards armed with ancient matchlocks. All are unaware that they are targeted for ambush by bandit leader Zhang (Jiang Wen).

This is the fourth film directed by Jiang Wen, a famous Chinese actor who extends the noodle western metaphor of this film by acting and directing, somewhat in the footprints of Clint Eastwood, but very much in his own style. This is a funny movie with high production values, humour darker and less accessible to non-Chinese audiences than that of Jackie Chan - without the martial arts showmanship and slapstick that Chan brings to his films. The film is not at all in the familiar historical epic/kung fu genre of Chinese movies recently popular in the west.

The script, by Jiang Wen, is adapted from a story by Sichuanese author and satirist Ma Shitu , 'Dao Guan Ji'  ('Tale of the Bandit Official'), from his fictional work published in 1983, 'Ye Tan Shi Ji' ('Ten Night-time Tales').

Jiang Wen's cast is well chosen, with particularly good work by his four very capable lead actors, including himself. The most recognizable member of the cast to western audiences, Chow Yun-Fat, plays against type as a villain, Huang, the mob boss of Goose Town. One of China's favourite cinema clowns, Ge You - a Chinese Cantinflas - shows great comic timing throughout in the role of conman Ma Bangde. Carina Lau has the only standout female role as the much-widowed governor's wife. Jiang Wen himself plays the wily, whimsical bandit leader Zhang.

The Emperor Motion Pictures Blu-ray release available through Amazon resellers has excellent image and sound quality, and a second special features disc. Unfortunately for most of the non-Chinese speaking audience, the sound track options are only Mandarin, and - unusually - Sichuan dialect. The English sub-titles are good, but being necessarily abbreviated cannot carry all nuances of the script, or even its Chinese profanity.",1312761600,,2707,5.0447427293064875

1146000,5,7885142728,"China spent almost a century in great turmoil, from the Taiping Rebellion, the fall of the Qing, a failed republic, a decade of warlords, the second World War, and a brutal civil war, before being unified once again. The years of the warlords was probably the most chaotic politically, with very little clear idea of who controlled what. This time was roughly from 1919 to 1930. It is 1919, a year when people could buy themselves governorships over towns and entire districts, and parts of China resembled the American Wild West, that the story of Jiang Wen's Let the Bullets Fly takes place.

 The premise of the film is how a honorable enough bandit leader can take the control of town away from the human and drug trafficking kingpin who runs it. Jiang Wen plays the bandit leader, Pockmarked Zhang. Zhang robs a train with a man on it named Ma Bangde, played by Ge You, an aspiring politician. Ma Bangde has bought himself a governorship and is on his way to collect. During the robbery Ma's counselor dies and Ma faced with Zhang who is looking for a rich governor. So, Ma lies saying he is the counselor, and that his dead counselor was really the governor to be, hoping Zhang will let him go. With that information, Zhang decides to use Ma's expertise to take on the governorship Ma was supposed to take over for himself. Upon arriving at the city Zhang is immediately pitted against the local crime boss, Master Huang, played by Chow Yun-fat. These two characters interacting is almost like John Wayne meeting Al Capone. They engage in a battle of wits and will for the life of the poor little place called Goose Town.

 The movie moves fast, much like the time period it is set in. It is a witty cross between a gunslinging western and a prohibition era, Chicago gangster flick, all set in southern China. The interplay between Chow's character and Jiang's is amazing. It is similar to watching the Al Pacino and Robert De Niro exchange in Heat, only it lasts through the whole film and is amusingly clever. The characters are large personalities that engage in word play games with each other before, after, and during all the violence. A cord of humor runs through the entire piece that never feels forced or misplaced. A wonderful example of this is the constant referencing of Chinese history and myth in the film. As when Master Huang talks about gathering arrows with straw boats, a reference to a famous Three Kingdoms era strategist, Zhuge Liang. Of course, Huang's servant doesn't get the reference adding a comedic point in the film.

 The film is not without substance however. One of the reasons I have become such a huge fan of Jiang Wen's work as a director is his talent of mixing elements of action, comedy, and drama, all in a very human way without the fake feeling that many films have, and all with a layer of morality holding it all together. While the jokes fire and the bullets fly there is clear message Jiang is pushing at the audience. Maybe Western movie goers might miss it, but the Chinese I am sure didn't. In a conversation between Ma Bangde and Zhang, Ma tells Zhang that a politician has to kowtow to the person with the money, in this case the drug lord Huang. Zhang tells Ma he became a bandit because his knees don't bend well, another reference to Chinese classicalism, namely The Outlaws of the Marsh. This conversation sets the tone of the feeling that many rebellious souls in China at this period felt and can easily be applied to modern politics as well. The May Fourth Movement, a very influential intellectual movement that criticized traditional Chinese culture and the power structure it supported was started in the year 1919, therefore I don't believe the films time setting was a coincidence. Nor is Zhang's past a coincidence either, as a person returning to China to find society in chaos is a theme for many Chinese historical figures. I believe that Jiang Wen is finding a light way to tie in heavy topics of Chinese history to engage modern Chinese. The movie shows people allowing themselves to be pushed around by the rich and powerful, all the while not understanding that they have given those people their wealth and power. Zhang is determined to have the town's people take back all that they have given Huang.

 Much of the cast of this film is part of what is called the Sixth Generation, a group of actors and directors working through the mid-80's to present. These are some of the biggest names in Chinese cinema, making history for the industry and becoming internationally known. For example, Jiang Wen played a role in Zhang Yimou's Red Sorghum next to Gong Li. Ge You was the leading role in Zhang Yimou's To Live and Farewell My Concubine, again staring with Gong Li. While Chow Yun-fat comes from a different group of filmmakers in Hong Kong he is well know for his action movies with director John Woo, and of course, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. With talent to spare the cast makes these characters come to life in a bright, flashy and funny way. There are also surprisingly intense moments as well.

 I have now watched this film a couple of times and have found many aspects to enjoy. I have watched the dinner scene with Jiang Wen, Chow Yun-fat, and Ge You several times and found it moves like a shell game with the innuendo being shuffled between the three actors. The dialogue always seems to have two meanings, like a classic Chinese poem, one side moving, the other questionable. I highly recommend this film to any true movie going fan.

1146149,3,7885142728,"""Let the Bullets Fly"" (""Rang zidan fei"") stars Chow Yun-Fat, but you will soon realize this is no ordinary action movie, the moment he appears on the screen in a double role as a ""villain"" Master Huang and his ""body double"" mimicking him in a farce-like scene. No, bullets may fly, but Chow Yun-Fat's latest movie is not a John Woo-style hyper-intense action film that you might be looking forward to.

In fact, Chow Yun-Fat's role is more like a supporting one, as the film's star is Wen Jiang (who also directs) as a smart bandit Pocky Zhang, who, disguised as a newly appointed mayor, has just arrived at Goose Town, a provincial town relentless Master Huang dominates. It is nearly impossible to summarize what follows, twists and turns resulting from their never-ending conflict. All I can say that ""Let the Bullets Fly"" contains intrigues and double-crossing, but not the ""action"" you have seen in ""Hard Boiled.""

Set in 1920s, China, ""Let the Bullets Fly"" looks like a spaghetti Western with more chaotic and outrageous events. Many characters die in a violent (and sometimes silly) way. Most female characters are relegated to marginal roles (even Carina Lau disappears unceremoniously). Wen Jiang adopts a hodge-podge style of narrative that may remind you of either Tarantino or Kusturica.

With several familiar faces from the Chinese film industry, the film has already become one of the hugest commercial hits in mainland China, but ""Let the Bullets Fly"" may owe its success to what its story suggests in the subtext. It is often pointed out that the film is really a political parable masked as entertainment. Naturally Wen Jiang as director would not admit that, though even non-Chinese audiences would sense the film's satirical jabs at what he thinks constitutes the modern society of China. Sadly, however, most of the references would be lost on non-Chinese speakers like me.

Probably the 132-minute film, of which structure seems bloated, should be watched and appreciated in this context. Even so, however, I couldn't help feeling that the film's quirky charms would be more effective with more restrained direction.",1345420800,,2138,5.065340909090909

1146312,4,7885142728,"""Let the Bullets Fly"" is an action/ parody of Westerns, adapted from a story by Shitu Ma -though it is difficult to imagine how a piece of literature could be so convoluted. Onscreen, the audience can at least identify characters visually, which is helpful. The story takes place in 1920 somewhere in southern China. A gang of bandits intercepts a train carrying Ma Bangde (Ge You), his wife (Lau Carina), and his counselor to his new appointment as governor of Goose Town. Hoping to escape the bandits' wrath when they find that he is carrying no money, Ma poses as his own counselor, who was killed in the ambush. He claims the governor would have access to money in Goose Town. So the wily bandit chief (Jiang Wen) decides to pose as the new governor to see how he might profit from the position.

The new governor, his supposed counselor, and wife are welcomed warmly by the citizens of Goose Town -except for the local crime lord Huang Fox (Chow Yun-Fat), who has made a fortune trafficking people and opium. Huang is reluctant to cede any power to the new governor. And so begins an interminable series of clever deceptions, as each man tries to gain the upper hand. The new governor has promised to bring justice to Goose Town. And Huang will hold him to it. The governor proposes to tax the rich. Huang explains that most of his profits are stolen by the notorious bandit Pocky Zhang. He proposes that he and other wealthy citizens fund a campaign by the governor to bring Pocky to justice. But is he sincere? Who is Pocky? And who is the bandit posing as governor?

There is such a litany of deceptions, double-crosses, complications, and confusion of identities that it becomes difficult to keep track of who is doing what to whom and for what purpose. It is as if the screenwriter kept writing plot until he could think of no more complications to write. But the rapid-fire dialogue is very funny. The humor emanates from a combination of dialogue and comic circumstances that produce sharp political satire. ""Let the Bullets Fly"" doesn't skimp on violence, but dialogue drives the film. I find fault with the last act, which is tedious. And, at 2 hours 10 minutes,  this film is too long for a comedy. It is a difficult piece of material to make intelligible. Jiang Wen both stars and directs. Most of his work is admirable, but the last act needed to be better and shorter.

The movie is dialog-driven, which can be demanding when reading subtitles; but it is worth the effort, as clever dialog is the strongest merit of the film: lots of puns, quotables, double-entendre, farce, and idiomatically entertaining profanity (this is the movie with the ""F you"" scene, where everybody ends up shouting ""F you"" at each other back and forth).  This movie is hilarious, brilliantly acted by the three main stars, and very clever.  Chow Yun Fat is especially outstanding, I never knew he could do comedy; he had me laughing almost every time he was on screen, this is my favorite role that I've seen Chow in.  If this movie doesn't make you smile, then you are probably dead inside.",1341360000,14,1210,4.788461538461538

1146317,4,7885142728,"Negatives:
Not a good flow in part because the final script was contributed by many and often finalized, if at all, the day before or day of shooting.
The English dubbing was not paced with the scenes and often were on the screen for so short a period of time that the viewer had the choice of either reading the dubbing, or watching the scene, or pausing on the dubbing, or rewinding thus seeing each scene twice.

Positives:
Touches of cynicism, spoofing, satire, comedy with emphasis on sardonic. Yet, very moralistic with hints of that moralism reaching into today's politics.
Great location and set design in a modified '20s Kaiping; great props (especially laying all that track and the train design) and costume authenticity; great acting. Creative storytelling and filming technique. I especially liked some of the scenes, dialogue, hooks and allusions throughout the movie relating to our time period.",1338508800,,910,5.066666666666666

Maybe the movie has a satisfactory ending but it's not worth wasting another hour.  So we just switched it off.  Save your time and money.",1338076800,,458,4.524390243902439

7900656,5,7885142728,"I don't see how this movie is so polarizing- it's a good movie. Maybe part of that is that a lot of American viewers don't ""get"" Chinese movies. There are certain quirks here and there that anyone familiar with mainland Chinese film fans will be used to that might seem odd to a Westerner expecting this to be a blockbuster film. The short version is- if you like good movies, this is one. Like many mainland Chinese blockbusters it's equal parts action, drama, romance, and comedy. Watch it today.

First off- what's familiar to a Western audience. There are some big special effects in the movie, and gun battles aplenty. Chow Yun-Fat stars in a double role so we've got out action hero twice- but here he stars as a villain! A rare treat!

What's different:

History and information divide. Lots of Chinese epic films delve quite deep into Chinese history. There are lots of references thrown around to regions of China and dynasties and emperors and lords- whereas American action films usually don't even bother to name what city they're in half the time. This movie is full of references that you don't need to know to follow along, but a lot of Americans are going to feel confused seeing references they don't recognize.

Fables and cultural divide. American audiences probably think it's cumbersome to call a villain ""Pock-marked Zhang"" because pock-marked isn't a common descriptor. Few realize how common this descriptor is in Chinese and especially Chinese lore. Most Americans would turn their noses in disgust to know that their local Chinese eatery serves ""pock-marked grandma bean curd"" (mapo tofu). To anyone familiar with Chinese this is just part of the culture.

Bad effects and the technological divide. Chinese blockbusters tend to use outrageous special effects even though their effects departments aren't quite up to the same speed as in Hollywood. You can end up getting effects that are almost like ""Looney Tunes"" cartoons. The works of Stephen Chow (Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle) are one example. Let The Bullets Fly has some memorable effects in that vein- they're just the flavor of this cinema, but an American audience might be turned off by the ""bad"" graphics.

As for what's here, there's just so much. Chow Yun-Fat is amazing in his double role. Ge You is fantastic as Ma Bangde (""Old Soup""). The story is complex and all-encompassing, it's your basic story of a gang of thieves confronting a rich governor of a corrupt town until a zillion twists and turns take the narrative to ever-larger heights. I'm almost afraid to give much more away- it's hard to explain to people who a bunch of bandits running around with mah-jong tiles strapped to their faces would be funny and intense. You just have to see it to find out.

This was the biggest-ever mainland Chinese movie for a reason. It's ambitious, and it pulls off what it sets out to accomplish. A modern epic, very worth watching.",1494374400,,2922,4.843687374749499
7900657,3,7885142728,"Much more a comedy than an action film, and not a particularly funny one at that.  A lot of Chinese comedies are full of inside cultural jokes that just don't translate well to subtitles.  My Mandarin is okay and it is definitely the case that many of the subtitles are pretty free-form translations that capture neither the precise meaning nor the spirit of the original.  And it just never seemed to end.",1489881600,,406,4.611111111111111

7900660,2,7885142728,"Purchased this film with high expectation.  The film is more a comedy than anything else, and quite difficult to follow as well.  The original Mandarin Chinese would be the preferred audio track if the English subtitles didn't go by so fast.  The English dubbed track would be okay if it sounded more like the original actor's voices, but if you use the English dubbed track with the English subtitles, you will notice a HUGE difference between what is said and what is in the subtitles!!

I would have preferred to view the movie in the Blu-Ray version, but the seller, Francies Fantastic Films, sent the Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack with ONLY the DVD version in the package, and I ordered the combo pack.  The Blu-ray version was MISSING!!  I'm fairly certain the audio on the Blu-Ray version would have been superior to the audio on the DVD version, which was difficult to hear because you have to set the volume level very high to hear the dialogue and then have to turn it down when the shooting occurs.  Had the product been the combo pack I ordered, my rating would likely have been higher.",1473465600,2,1091,4.6217616580310885
