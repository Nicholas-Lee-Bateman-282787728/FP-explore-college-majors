8453559,1,B00525QG9M,"I really wanted to like this trilogy. The story must be good, just look at the ratings here on Amazon. The thing is the research for the movies is bad. If you know absolutely nothing about the subject being covered it might be good. Case in point, in the lost treasure of Ugarit, where they are about to blow up a cave, amount other odd things the ""bad guy"" is handed a .177 pellet gun to make the long range shot. Now that is a sign of low budget!!!! It didn't get better and I lost interest.
So for the price they are asking 1 star is to good for this trilogy.",1467590400,,562,4.026785714285714
8453560,4,B00525QG9M,"Calling it an indie Jones rip off would be mean, as there have been a lot of them since Harrison Ford first put on the hat.  You can tell by the art work on the cover, that we are trying for a younger version of Harrison Ford.

 Plenty of action, romantic tension between the main characters and great settings.  Classic quest story line, characters in search of lost treasure.

Any fans of Wharehouse 13 will recognise the leading lady.",1425168000,,437,4.481012658227848

8453562,5,B00525QG9M,"I had originally ordered this from an outside seller on amazon. It was lost in the mail. I managed to get another copy and these movies are great. It's like Indiana Jones meets The Relic Hunter. Ivan Sergei plays the lead. He never really acts like he wants to be involved with the hunt, but always finds a way out of a tight spot when he's backed into a corner. Like I've said before. If you're not sure about getting a movie, check out the trailers online first. I saw 2 of these movies on the Hallmark channel before i bought the set.",1415750400,,537,4.223300970873787

8453564,5,B00525QG9M,Right now there is only one of the three Jack Hunters in NTSC format and this collection is only in PAL. Hard to understand why this is being provided to the UK and some of Europe only when it is actually produced in Canada with at least one of the stars being Canadian.  Canada like the USA is NTSC not PAL.,1390867200,,308,4.049180327868853
