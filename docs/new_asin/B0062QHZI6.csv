8491409,1,B0062QHZI6,"Attention:  this is not as much a review as it is a WARNING!  Some of us look for and enjoy films that are so bad that are 'good', funny, hysterically awful.  ""OVER THE EDGE"" is not one of these.  This 'film' is so pathetic and dreadful,  it's a sin TLA would be asking anyone to pay money for this dreck.  But if you do make the mistake like I did and order this, then notice the fact that the acting (an insult to the word) is at an all time low (below ""low"", non-existent).  The script in fact does NOT exist.  We just hear 'blah blah' over again and again about nothing of worth or interest.  Maybe this is just a ""test"" for any viewer to see how long one can endure such kaka before one turns this off and only wishes to return this to the sender.  This 'over the edge' is already floating in the toilet.  It just needs a final FLUSH.",1529020800,,839,4.054878048780488
8491410,5,B0062QHZI6,"I've never laughed with a movie so much! I saw dumb and dumber on opening night, then went back the next night for more. If you think you'd enjoy a pair of adorable idiot savants bumbling their way into a relationship and more, you should see this movie. Brilliantly subtle - but brilliant nonetheless - humor, especially the dialogue between the two young men.",1506729600,,361,4.65625
8491411,1,B0062QHZI6,Not worth the time to watch.  I found it tedious and uninspired.,1461801600,,64,4.333333333333333

8491413,1,B0062QHZI6,I should have listened to the reviews. Not worth the time or money. I bailed before the end it was so bad.,1401926400,,106,3.8636363636363638
8491414,1,B0062QHZI6,It's so lame it's funny at times but it's not worth paying for. Only interesting aspect for me was the main character hotness.,1399161600,3,126,4.521739130434782
8491415,3,B0062QHZI6,"very cheaply made, at least i hope it was.  the boys are decent to look at, the neighbor looks like a very old and very bad drag queen and the script was just plain weird.",1358035200,2,171,3.8857142857142857
8491416,4,B0062QHZI6,"Saw this at the 2011 Philadelphia LGBT film festival and loved it.  There are so many blah mainstream *and* indie films out there, but this is not one of them",1330128000,6,158,4.266666666666667
8491417,1,B0062QHZI6,"overacting, non-acting, poor script, just some of the problems with this ""movie"".  i'll probably end up trashing the disc and reusing the case.  it's really bad.",1327363200,5,161,5.153846153846154
