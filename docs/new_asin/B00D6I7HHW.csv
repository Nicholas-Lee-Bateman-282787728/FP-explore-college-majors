8589888,5,B00D6I7HHW,"The DVD is a great buy with easy to follow instructions on how to play these key licks.

As a bonus, the package includes a the ""50 Licks DVD.""",1469923200,,143,3.9310344827586206
8589889,5,B00D6I7HHW,"This is a very rewarding licks video if one commits themselves to it. As a previous reviewer correctly stated, it is NOT for beginners. Even intermediate players without a basis in theory and/or jazz may find it a bit difficult to get going. That said, if you have those things, you can pick these licks up pretty quickly. Also, since they are over common jazz-blues progressions, the licks are immediately useful when soloing in that context. Hamburger is a good teacher and an even better player and many of these licks are derived from his favorite piano and horn players, which takes these licks well beyond much of the materials out there aimed at introducing intermediate rock or blues players to jazz blues.",1430956800,,714,4.813008130081301

8589891,4,B00D6I7HHW,"There is a lot of good and useful information on this DVD, but be warned, it is for at least intermediate and even better for advanced players. There is not much explanation of what they're playing and they make the assumption the viewer already knows and understands a lot about music theory and chord structure. That doesn't make it a bad instructional disc, but it can be very slow and frustrating to figure some of this stuff out. Not for beginners at all! I am not a beginner and I find the exercises to be very tedious to learn, but rewarding when I finally get them.",1409702400,3,573,4.415094339622642
