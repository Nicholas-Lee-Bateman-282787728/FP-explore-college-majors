8131202,4,B000GET19Q,"The content of this video is 5 stars.  I rate it at 4 stars because the video quality is at times quite poor, like it was done with an old VHS recording camera from the seats of a lecture hall.

Dr. Grandin discusses her life with autism, visual thinking, sensory issues, careers for the autistic adult and how to foster career interests in your child, and how to measure the effect of and determine the optimal dose of medications for the autistic individual.

This video is a must-have.  It offers lots of great information and it offers a great deal of hope.  Also, despite the poor video/sound quality, it's a great video to show at meetings and really spurs conversation among the participants, especially with new groups.  This video is an essential part of your autism library.

If there is someone with autism in your life, I wish you strength, laughter, and success as you endeavor toward recovery.",1217376000,2,907,4.7025316455696204
