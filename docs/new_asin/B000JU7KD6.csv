The movie is very fast paced, and you get to know the characters right away.  If you do not watch the extras ahead of time, you will definately get the sense that the movie is from the left.  Later you will find it is an East German film.  But, really, listening to this side can give you some very interesting insights.  Even when those in the union are dissappearing, you get the sense that those left behind had some hope for the future.

The movie is in German and German with English subtitles.  I particularly liked the pace of the movie.  But you have to understand that the movie covers 12 years in about two hours.  You will learn in the extras, the Representative from Standard Oil is a composite character.  We have that a lot in movies, the most recent example was the character played by Mel Gibson in the Patriot.  They do use the book written after Nuremburg entitled IG Farben as a main source.  Speaking of Nuremburg, there is a trial scene toward the end of the movie that is just spectacular.  The tirades, fault finding and redirections are just great.  A lot of emotion packed into very few minutes.

Many of us have heard through the years about various corporations in the US supporting the build up to WWII in Germany as a truth.  This is just one more look from a perspective of those with an agenda, yet, they have eye witness accounts and some very interesting coincidences that need answers.",1284940800,4,1657,4.473333333333334

8152971,4,B000JU7KD6,"This is a 1949 East German film about a chemist working at I.G. Farben from the time of Hitler's rise to power to post-war Germany.  It's a fairly conventional narrative which plays like any typical film of the 40s except that its political assertions are utterly bizarre.

The film purports to be based on the evidence presented at the Nuremberg trials for I.G. Farben and from other ""American"" sources.  According to this movie, I.G. Farben was in cahoots with Standard Oil (of the USA) throughout the course of World War II through regular business dealings in Switzerland and Spain.  As I watched this tale I was continuously amazed at the claims made in the film.  My astonishment may have been enhanced by the fact that I didn't realize until after I watched it that it was produced in the DDR.  Even knowing that, you will be amazed at how the bad guys beat the rap in Nuremberg for having manufactured Zyklon B.

All that being said, it's a well-made and very interesting film.  I was particularly interested in the portrayal of Americans in this film, who speak German with American accents.  The daughter of the Standard Oil executive is an especially unusual film character: a blonde bombshell who speaks German laced with American English.

It's worth seeing just to learn that there was ever a film industry capable of producing such an odd film.",1201392000,10,1359,4.769230769230769
