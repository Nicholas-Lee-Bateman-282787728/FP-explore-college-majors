1937554,5,B0000E6XDU,"What a wonderful way to spend an evening, watching episode after episode of this fabulous British series!  My wife and I first saw As Time Goes By on PBS and were taken with it immediately!
Then, in a programming change it started showing up only sporadically, much to our disappointment!
Our children bought us a DVD player and the 1st/2nd Season set for Christmas last year and since then we have bought all the other DVD's in the series.
The humor of everyday life, the quirkiness of the characters; the witty reparte/  -  a wonderful television show that unfortunately has left the small screen , BUT, we can now watch again and again in the proper sequence thanks to the DVD ollection!",1080864000,12,690,4.639344262295082
1937555,5,B0000E6XDU,"""As Time Goes By"" is one of the best sitcoms that the BBC has ever produced.  The humor is gentle, warm and always completely believable.  It is well written, well directed and perfectly cast.  I have seen every episode a number of times and I never get tired of it.
  The show is consistently a cut above the standard sitcom.  It is always firmly grounded in reality and the characters are all immensely likeable.  Sometimes it seems less like a television show than it does a pleasant visit with friends.
  Don't miss this one!",1075334400,15,529,4.542553191489362
1937556,5,B0000E6XDU,"""As Time Goes By"" is the gentle, funny story of Jean Pargetter and Lionel Hardcastle, two people who used to be in love in the early fifties. When Lionel went off to fight in the Korean War, the two lost touch. They meet again 38 years later, quite by accident, and what is at first an awkward friendship slowly morphs into a warm romance.
In Series 6 of ""As Time Goes By"" (originally aired in 1997), we are treated to some of the best episodes yet. It is a near-perfect season. Some fans have even pontificated that this could very well have been a great way for the show to have ended. I count myself in that crowd. It is true that some of the supporting character's plot lines are still left at loose ends, but the romance of Jean & Lionel -- the true story arc of the series -- pretty much resolves itself in series 6, and in such powerful, sweet, and meaningful ways.
There are 7 episodes in all on this set. Episode 1 is a cute, slightly suspenseful story about someone stalking Sandy (Jean & Lionel's lodger). We get to meet 'Nails', one of Alistair Deacon's associates. And another interesting addition to the ""As Time Goes By"" list of memorable guest characters.
Episode 2 takes up one of the last real threads of the Jean & Lionel story arc: Jean's retirement. Lionel is becoming bored without her home during the day, and the issue is pressed. Jean visits a psychotherapist, because leaving work behind makes her feel somewhat purposeless.
With Jean slightly depressed over becoming ""semi-retired"", and Judith & Sandy dating new, perhaps questionable men, episode 3 centers around a most unwanted visit from Jean's nosy sister-in-law Penny, and her husband Stephen. It features one of the most hilarious evening banter sessions in any sitcom -- ever.
Episode 4 is a cozy little story set at Jean & Lionel's country house. Mrs. Bale, the housekeeper, is grumpy. Lionel gets sick and must be nursed in bed. A grim doctor visits. And Alistair arrives out of the blue from London. It all makes sense in the end. Sort of.
Alistair announces his engagement in episode 5 -- to a woman named 'Mercury', no less! This puts Judith out of sorts, although she tries not to admit it. The scene in the restaurant makes for one of the best of entire series.
Penny & Stephen pop up again in episode 6, this time because they're interested in buying the house next door to Jean & Lionel's. Needless to say, this does not go over well with our star couple, and this entire episode is priceless simply because of the looks on Jean & Lionel's faces.
Episode 7 is truly a classic. Some fans affectionately call it ""The War Museum"" episode. Lionel takes a trip to the War Museum, and makes a startling, wonderful discovery which he shares with Jeans at episode's end. Their romance has truly come full circle at this point, and a more touching moment you'd be hard put to find. This episode also deals with Lionel attempting to plan a surprise get-a-way for he & Jean, with everyone's help, and their efforts are absolutely hilarious.
With Series 6 of ""As Time Goes By"", the show is really running like a well-oiled machine. Chapters begin to close (in the best possible ways) for our main characters: Jean 'semi-retires', and the star couple makes a most welcome discovery. The prime story arcs of the series are completed. Jean & Lionel are married and living comfortably & lovingly with one another, ready to sail into the rest of their life together. Now all that really remains is to see if Judith & Alistair will ever decide to make a go of it, and if Sandy will ever find the right man. Perhaps a certain policeman, first seen in episode 6 of this series, can be of some assistance in that regard?
Series 7, 8 and 9 await...",1069372800,210,3720,4.56203288490284

1937588,5,B0000E6XDU,"We rarely get second chances in life... and the love story of Jean and Lionel is the definitive second-chance at love-story.  Series 6 sees Jean and Lionel comfortably settled into their gentle married life as an older couple.  They have petty fights that ring so true to real life it's as if you are watching an older couple you know.  There are some interesting developments in this series, including one very personal episode revolving around Jean as she comes to the painful decision to retire from the modestly successful secretarial agency she built from the ground up between her first husband's death and her reconnecting with Lionel.  It is a fairly accurate and insightful look at how workaholics like Jean begin to go off the rails slightly as they get older (in Jean's case she micromanages Judy and Sandy to the point of exasperation and begins to pick fights with Lionel over perceived slights to her abilities).  Another episode sees Jean and Lionel reduce her insufferable sister-in-law Penny (from her first marriage) to a flummoxed heap with a non-stop flow of chat on uselessly trivial issues (much to the delight of Stephen) during a dinner party.  And then there's the delightful episode revolving around the eccentric Mrs. Bale, who is behaving ""distinctly"" peculiar... could it have anything to do with a balloonist?  Judy and Alistair's saga has it's ups and downs this series with twists that include a suit of armor, a married man with teenage children, and a surprise engagement!  Sandy starts dating a nice police constable, Harry, in the episode that sees Penny and Stephen try to buy the house next to Jean and Lionel (oh horror of horrors!).
The last episode sees Lionel try to fix a surprise for Jean... and by the end of the episode he pulls off the most touching moment of the entire show's run... unearthing the letter that Jean never got when he was posted to Korea in 1953.  If ""As Time Goes By"" had never made any more episodes after that one it would have been a perfect ending, the love story had come full circle.  But lucky for us, there is more fun to be had with Jean and Lionel and their family for at least three more series!",1414195200,,2171,4.704485488126649

1937602,5,B0000E6XDU,"I only recently discovered this British series on WEDU PBS channel and I am hooked!  I found that I was looking forward to Saturday nights to watch this series rather than going out to dinner so I purchased a complete series 6 and now watch when I wish.

1937605,5,B0000E6XDU,As Time Goes By is a great British comedy.  Dame Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer are so good together - their chemistry shows through.  The supporting cast members are all just great.  I lived in England and loved this series over there.  I am glad I sought out the dvd's for this series.  You cannot go wrong with Dame Judi Dench!,1281744000,,330,4.344262295081967
1937606,4,B0000E6XDU,"I always know that whenever I watch an episode of ""As Time Goes By"" I will feel better afterwards.  If I've had a rough week and want to unwind, those are the people I invite into my home for a nice chat.  Judy Dench and Geoffrey Palmer work so well together - ditto the supporting cast - and I always laugh out loud at least once, usually more during each episode.  The program was recommended to me by good friend who had it recommended to them, and I'm now recomending it to other friends.  It's a program you enjoy enough to share - like good friends.  For me, the hard part of the series is that each season only has 6 or 7 30-minute episodes, which, I've been told, is typical of how the Brits film their series.  They leave you wanting more, and for ""As Time Goes By"" that's definitely true!",1243036800,,798,4.217105263157895

Apparently it is episode seven, which closes Series Six.  I have purchased the series 8+9 (together, and including the You Must Remember This, one hour special, 2000 and 2002) plus I have also purchased the Reunion Specials (two hours, 2005), and am pleased as punch.  Finally knowing which has the War Museum Episode, I will buy the Series 6.  For sure, I'll wear out the DVDs of however many seasons which I do purchase, but I will not be purchasing the whole show.",1142380800,2,623,4.6880733944954125

Episode 1 - Sandy is being stalked and Lionel decides he is going to do something about it.  But Jean is having none of that and goes to Alister.

Episode 2 - Lionel is tired of Jean working (at the office and at home).  Judy and Sandy are tired of Jean duplicating their work. While on the love front, Alister does not get the answer he expects from Judy.

Episode 3 - Lionel is pressuring Jean to retiring.  This is the wrong time for a visit from he ex inlaws, Penny and Stephen.

Episode 4 - Mrs Bale (the country house housekeeper) is acting strange (well stranger than normal).  Jean is determined to find out why.

Episode 5 - Judith's new boyfriend surprises Jean and Lionel on their return home.  Alister has a surprise announcement for the gang, he's getting married!  But Lionel sees that he is still in love with Judith.

Episode 6 - The neighbors are selling the house and Penny wants to buy it.

I don't care what happens in my day, if I can get to the TV remote and click on the video I taped (with several shows on it out of sequence), I know I will mellow out as if I had taken a tranquilizer or something. I just sit there and let the characters bathe my soul.  Really.  Just stroke my soul with a type of humaness we'd all like to gain in our being: i.e., one for understanding and tolerance and laughter.  Jean is an absolute perfect woman: she is not error free, always creating dilemmas and just otherwise adorable.  Bravo Judi Dench.  These characters are highly suitable for me.  I call them ""my peeps.""  I cannot say enough praise about this show and these characters.  I watch one show after the other until I'm energized and filled with hope and desire for such a spirit as this.  My spirit.  The one I have dreamed of all my life.  And lived, when my family was all about here.  (Life happens!) My oldest daughter, 39, and I grew apart as she grew up; we have found something we both like at visit times to rebond our mother-daughter relationship. (I'm buying her a set of her own as a gift. That will go over good for me, I'm sure.)  We both light up with these characters and enjoy that spirit.  I'll shut the VCR off and feel assured that the tape is there for me ""to take"" like a pill to mellow me out the next time.  I swear, if my menopausal state falls in natural hormones I stimulate some new ones from watching this show.  THANKS to all who produced it and allow me to now buy it on DVD.
