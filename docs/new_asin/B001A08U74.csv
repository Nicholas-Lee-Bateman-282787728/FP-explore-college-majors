8275724,5,B001A08U74,The videos in this series are very enlightening and helpful.  Dr Fruchtenbaum is an excellent teacher.  Definitely worth watching.,1407024000,3,130,5.7894736842105265
8275725,5,B001A08U74,"Christians have lost much in ignoring our Messianic Jewish brethren's knowledge of their culture and scripture. This DVD set should be the first bible study taken after one has come to Faith. My disciple is now taking this course with me - my second time, her first. She won't flop around for answers to any questions relating to Yeshua/Jesus from Jew or Gentile which is how it should be. We should know The Jewish Messiah in His context; not what we supposed or hoped it would be.

While not as animated as Dr. J. MacArthur, Dr. Frutchenbaum is just as brilliant but different. They would be a perfect foil for one another, IMO. Now THAT would be a conversation worth listening to.",1293408000,4,683,4.598360655737705
