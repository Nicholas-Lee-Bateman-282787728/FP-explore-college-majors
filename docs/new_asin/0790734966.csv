117790,3,0790734966,"This is a decent movie with some high profile lead actors. However, Barbara Kellerman does not impress as the female lead.  Her acting is wooden, expressionless, and amateurish in my opinion.  I can't believe they couldn't have done better.
One aspect that knocks a star off of my rating is the fact that they didn't bother to give the actors haircuts that were appropriate to the WWII period.  Also, the clothing is not period-accurate as well.  In fact, you have to keep reminding yourself this is supposed to be in the 40's rather than 1980!  This does detract quite a bit, and there are other odds and ends that show the lack of detail given to this picture. Too bad, since the top-name actors and interesting, true-to-life plot make this a worthwhile movie otherwise!",1160265600,,772,4.731343283582089
117791,5,0790734966,"I first saw this film on HBO.  I tuned in because two long-time favourites (Roger Moore & Patrick Macnee) were listed.  I watched it over several times, bought it on VHS, and now own it on DVD.

This is based on a true event in WWII, when the British were losing cargo to a U-Boat pack in the Indian Ocean. Since the problem stemmed from the neutral Portugese port of Goa, nothing 'official' could be done.  The Calcutta Light Horse, a group of retired British military, are recruited to do the impossible, and pulled it off.  The event was declassified in 1980, and the film was made.  Most of the cast is portraying actual persons involved, as shown in the end credits.

To play the 'past prime' Light Horse members, the film recruited major names:  David Niven, Trevor Howard, Kenneth Griffith, Morgan Sheppard, Patrick Allen, Glyn Houston, and a cadre of others you will know.  The ""thin on top, thick in the middle"" troops are led by professional soldiers Gregory Peck, Roger Moore, and Patrick Macnee.  Peck plays Col. Lewis Pugh, a colonel whose family was in Coventry when it was plastered by the Luftwaffe.  Moore plays Capt. Gavin Stewart, a bit of a playboy who falls for local lovely spy Barbara Kellerman.  Macnee plays Major ""Yogi"" Crossley, the explosives expert fond of reading the paper while standing on his head.  All cast members are well up to the task.  Most memorable of the supporting cast is Wilton who is charged with nursing the engines of their rather creaky craft.  When told he has to stay on the ship rather than going aboard the target vessel, Wilton says: ""Request permission to say, 'S--t' sir.""

The fun is watching these men train for the mission; the suspense is watching them perform it.  To a man, the whole Light Horse volunteered for the mission, despite knowing there was no pay, recognition, medals, or any form of compensation.  With only one fatality, despite overwhelming odds and several casualties, they manage.

The only flaw of the film, for me, is Peck's British accent which is overdone when present and tends to fade in and out.  Director Andrew McLaglen should have dispensed with it entirely.  (MacLaglen also directed Moore in 'fflokes,' another offbeat role for The Saint whose name was Bond.)

Action, humour, romance, suspense - all based on a true story - this one has it all, including a title & credit sequences of the actual event.",1128038400,43,2394,4.745762711864407
117792,4,0790734966,"This is by no means an action packed war movie. Instead, it is about a group of retirees from the Calcutta Light Horse, a regiment from India, who are recruited to a covert operation to sink German ships passing information to U boats in violation of neutrality. The regiment is one that had not seen action since the Boer War at the turn of the century; now they are called to the colors again during WWII. The subtitle, ""Last Charge of the Calcutta Lighthorse"", conjures up a mental image for me of a bunch of guys on horses charging ships. That is not what happens. They take the James Bond route instead.

The geriatric commandos are eager to serve and do manage to accomplish their mission. They do encounter setbacks and problems and that is where the movie shines. They are assisted in their mission by Gregory Peck and Roger Moore, two people who are trained in the world of clandestine operations. It sounds silly but it works well.

This is a fun movie and worth subsequent viewings.",1114560000,,993,4.573033707865169
117793,5,0790734966,"I bought this used in a video store today and the tape freezed up on me 2/3 of the way thru the movie. I am now ordering the DVD on Amazon because I opened (read: broke open) the videotape up in a futile attempt to fix the problem and see the end of the film tonight because I was so enthralled by the story. Drat, I couldn't fix it.

Yes, the story builds a bit slow, but this is a really interesting story based on a true WWII attack. Without giving away the plot, it is highly believable that a minor character, an Indian national was working with the Nazis against the British because he saw this as a way to get independence for India - and/or vent his hatred of Britian. What the Nazis would would have done to the dark skinned Indians had they won the war is another story. But even if you don't know that piece of history, you can get the story (ok, you know it now). The story flows. I can't wait to see the ending and how all characters resolve their issues - as well as how the attack goes down.",1112572800,,1006,4.08080808080808
117794,4,0790734966,"This film is, as has been stated previously, a throwback to a lost era in film-making.  The cast is generally superb, although some are underutilized (Patrick McNee in particular).  Interestingly, Barbara Kellerman was not the original choice for the female lead (according to Roger Moore's recent biography); Diana Rigg was.  This is not McLaglen's best film (I think ffolkes is), but it is enjoyable nonetheless.  Strangely, my copy has a very soft soundtrack.  I have to crank the sound or use the subtitles to understand the dialogue.",1067472000,13,538,5.137931034482759
117795,4,0790734966,"This film is a throwback to the classic war films pre-Saving Private Ryan. Since that film, a very good one I might add, Hollywood has attempted to out-blood n' gore itself with each new war movie. Well that's certainly a part of war, possibly THE single most important part at the personal level of conflict, but it's not necessary for a film to entertain. If all you want is to see suffering, spend a Friday night at any inner city ER. No, The Sea Wolves is something more. It tells the tale of a band of aged Boer War veterans enlisted by the British Special Operations Executive to conduct a clandestine raid on a German merchant ship transmitting intelligence to U-boats cruising the Indian Ocean. As is usually the case with Hollywood, the film takes some liberties with the actual event but it is quite entertaining nonetheless. David Niven is superb, as always. Gregory Peck's role was equalling well done, if one can excuse the rather poor English accent that tends to fade in and out. The tongue-in-cheek, very British exchanges between he and Roger Moore are quite enjoyable. I hadn't seen this movie in 20+ years and it is as entertaining as ever. I'm happy to see that lesser known films like The Sea Wolves are making it onto DVD. Just don't expect lots of body parts flying about or language that would make Mike Tyson blush.",1061078400,146,1340,4.6344537815126055
117796,5,0790734966,"This isn't the best Roger Moore non-007 movie (that honor IMO belongs to ""Ffolkes"") but it is close to the top.
An amazing cast including Gregory Peck, Roger Moore and David Niven star in this Hollywood version of an actual event.
A group of retired military men take on a mission for Britain to destroy a ship in a neutral harbor which is alerting a lurking German U-Boat to Allied trade routes in an effort to disrupt commerce.
The DVD is unfortunately a bare-bones release, but in an age when many great movies have yet to even see the light of day (Where Eagles Dare, Ffolkes, High Road to China) its great to have this classic in my DVD collection.",1040256000,4,653,4.45
117797,5,0790734966,"I love such a film. 1st ,it is on protecting Empire root from German U-boot and based on real history. 2nd ,on amature attack to neutral port belonging to Portugese. Isn't it UK style ? 3rd ,many UK stars are in the film.",1027987200,3,221,4.162790697674419
117798,3,0790734966,"This is an interesting film, made with care and respect for the real-life heroes. However, it also is quite flawed, which is probably why it never made as huge an impact as the producers had hoped, either at the time of release or since.
Despite the famous cast on hand, the film feels more like a TV movie at times, while the story plays out like an old-time war/spy action film. There are plenty of cliches from this genre on hand, including the old regiment banding together once more, being trained on weapons and munitions at the last minute, an impossible task only the old fellows can achive, etc.
Another problem is that the exteriors were shot on location, which works some of the time, but leads to everyone except the actors wearing modern dress (complete with those ridiculously big collars left over from the 70's), having modern hairstyles, driving post-WWII automobiles, and the native residents of India staring and waving as they pass by the cameras.
Other than these points, the film is watchable and entertaining, and even sprinkled with decidedly British humor where appropriate. The top-notch cast makes up for any anachronisms, cliches, and lapes in logic. David Niven, Gregory Peck, Roger Moore, Trevor Howard, and others, save the day in what could have been a forgettable film. However, besides the cast, the ideas and much of the execution of the film both have merit, and this is indeed a true story. The facts of the mission were only released by the British government in 1978, and the film made a scant two years later.
For fans of Bond, we see Roger Moore doing something here that the newer Bond actors are now prohibited from doing; appearing during his reign as Bond in a non-Bond film wearing a tux (the tux being a Bond trademark of sorts). Also of note to Bond fans, the famous Maurice Binder created the stylized opening and closing credits.
The film is a bit light on action, but there is just enough dispersed throughout to keep things moving. While the film is no ""Patton"" or ""The Longest Day"" or anything, it is quite a watchable war/action/spy movie that is just perfect for viewing on a rainy Saturday afternoon.",1026604800,7,2156,4.752
117799,4,0790734966,"Gregory Peck, Roger Moore and David Niven are the lead actors in this true story having taken place in WW II in India and Goa.  It is shot on location where it happened, giving great authenicity to the scenes and how they took  place.  I think just about every older English actor who has appeared in  any war films is present here.  This was one of the reasons I liked the  film.  A gathering of ""old"" friends in one place from the other  films gives it credence as you know they are well trained, in a way.  This  is sort of like ""The Wild Geese"", same cast of characters in the  support roles.  The print of the film in 1.85 to 1 letterbox is of great  quality.  The surround sound works well.  While the subject matter of  getting the sinking of ships stopped is serious, there are many very funny  spots as the older men of the Light Horse get geared up for war after 40  some years.  There is one especially tender moment when David Niven is  shaving at 5am and his wife is worried about another woman.  Both Gregory  Peck and Roger Moore play their respective characters believably.  Not sure  why they didn't check one character out............",945561600,89,1152,4.401913875598086

Hot Toasty Rag, August 10, 2017

The Sea Wolves is one of those old guys still got it! movies, so if you prefer your action heroes to be young and fit, you might not like this. Me, I usually prefer men with a little mileage on them, and Ill watch anything with David Nivenat any ageso I was very excited to watch as he, Gregory Peck, Roger Moore, and Trevor Howard took on the Germans in this true WW2 story.

Unfortunately for me, Niven had the second smallest part of the four, but any Niven is better than nothing! Gregory Peck might not have the best British accent in the world, but I don't really think anyone minds, as long as hes full of integrity and leads his troops to do the right and noble thing. And even though I would have preferred Niven to play the romantic lead, Roger Moore was very charming in his pursuit of Barbara Kellerman.

All in all, there are some funny moments, cute music, and a pretty good and safe story. I mean, with Gregory Peck in charge, what could go wrong, right?",1502323200,,1027,4.283505154639175

117814,4,0790734966,"Gregory Peck and David Niven pairing again in a WW2 adventure.  Well, it's not the better known movie.  This is about a real event, the attack by British commandoes on German ships lying interned in the Neutral port of Portuguese Goa along India's west coast.  The action is limited and a character or two are added mainly to add a feminine adversary for Roger Moore.  One aspect of this film is that both Peck (as an English officer) and Niven (as a retired one) were closer in age at time of filming to the real life characters during the raid.  But I would recommend this only for those who enjoy great actors having a good time with a limited story line.",1500076800,3,658,4.404958677685951

This movie isn't an interesting one. Considering the tittle, I was expecting a super production. I Collect war movies dvds and I noted that the dvds cases in general, are made in a sub standard quality. They're not very resistant. It's necessary to improve it.

117897,1,0790734966,"A sad attempt to make a World War II movie in a very post World War II world!  I could go on and on about this film, but the my main peeves are these - unrealistic. The story (which is real) involves merchant ships that have long ago disappeared. Substituting a modern day cargo ship is like substituting a Boeing 707 for a B17!  The movie could have been filmed the old fashioned ""stage set"" way, and been much better. My other gripe is the scene in which Peck (obviously elderly) takes on multiple assailants in unarmed combat, and beats them. I don't know why I didn't like it, but it was probably the now cinematically required karate moves, executed by a very old man, or a very old man trying to convincingly deliver a karate kick!

The book relates the story of a WW2 raid on a German ship anchored in the neutral Portuguese Indian territory of Goa.  The Germans were using the ship as a safe haven from which to broadcast shipping information to German submarines.  This story was sealed under the British Official Secrets Act until the late 1970's.
Of course the movie takes some liberties with the actual history but it is close.  Gregory Peck, Roger Moore and David Niven have great screen chemistry.  The supporting cast led by Trevor Howard and Patrick Macnee is outstanding.  The pace of the action is probably a little slow for those who enjoy the thrill a minute modern action movies.  This is more similar to The Guns of Navarone in its style.

The group steal a decrepit river freighter in Calcutta to keep the operation quiet from local authorities, and hug the coast sailing around India to Goa in a week while they train.  They board one freighter to destroy the hidden radio room, and mine all three with delayed fuses.  Action occurs on location aboard deck instead of process shots.

A German submarine launches a torpedo against a British ship. How did they know its location? In Calcutta Englishmen gather in a building to listen to a radio. What does the SOE do? Special Operations. The Calcutta Light Horse wants to help the war effort. They located a powerful transmitter in Portuguese Goa, a neutral land. Can they pick up information on interned German ships? Two men visit Goa and talk to the owner of a caf. There is gambling on the top floor, roulette. Does Manuel know anything about a German and an Indian? Mrs. Cromwell visits Manuel. Those two men follow a man to Caf Lisbon. He is lured inside and given orders. Another man arrives, he is recognized as a German agent. Mrs. Cromwell arrives. At night two assassins try to kill Lewis but fail. David visits Mrs. Cromwell. An unexpected visitor pays for his bad manners.

Trompheta is taken for a ride, he resists. A bad career move! They return to India. Trompheta was replaced. Lewis has a plan to neutralize that transmitter. They ask for volunteers. No recognition. Germans exercise on the beach, one receives news. [Were you surprised? I suspected it.] The Light Horse acquire an old rust bucket for their mission. Supplies are loaded and it leaves port. [Note that narrow gauge railroad.] Their ship spots something in the water. Gavin uses influence to distract the officers and crew of those three German ships. Lewis talks to the volunteers. Another man has a scheme to attract sailors on a weekend. Gavin meets Mrs. Cromwell in private. Later she visits Gavins room. Will she be found? The volunteers are told of their mission. There is a problem with that old ship engine, but it is fixed.

Mrs. Cromwell invites Gavin to a meeting. Come alone. Can the Phoebe make up the lost time? The volunteers get training in arms and using those magnetic mines (to be placed below the waterline). Gavin Stewart arrives at the reception. One man is surprised! Gavin explains his delay to Mrs. Cromwell, they meet in private for a discussion. There is a celebration in the streets of Goa. Fireworks explode in the sky. The volunteers get their final instructions and they approach their first target. They board the ship in silence. Doors are unlocked, the radio is destroyed, code books are captured. Then they prepare to leave. But there are casualties. Push off! There is a problem with that old engine, but it starts. Poor devils. The damaged German ships sink. After this Light Horse raid in March 1943 only one Allied ship was lost.

This is an interesting movie based on a true event, Boarding Party by James Leasor. It combined both an intelligence operation and an action movie. How was that information obtained? Loose lips sink ships? The leak needed to be plugged. The SOE was negligent in not investigating that friendly widow. Beware of friendly strangers is still good advice.

The cast of characters is impressive, and there is plenty of action.  However, this movie version takes rather wide liberties with the truth; nothing I have ever read about the episode suggests that in reality there was a female German spy involved, or that there was any gunfire aboard the captured ship, or that anyone was killed.  Actually, at leas tin my opinion, the true story is even more fascinating than this film narrative.  A reasonably entertaining bit of escapism.",1422144000,2,839,4.805555555555555

These officers (whose photos are at the end of the movie) are played by Gregory Peck and Roger Moore.  David Niven is the commanding officer of a Territorial Unit which last saw action during the Boer War.  Although the men are too old for regular military service, Niven's men are all that are available when British intelligence makes its move.  This movie was subtitled The Last Charge of the Calcutta Light Horse.  It's an interesting, sometimes humorous, look at the struggle of the British Empire in WWII.

This why this film is so cheap and you don't remember it, because it did suck when it was out in 1980 and now well still sucks.

The idea of a group of leftover soldiers from the previous war, already put out to pasture, going on a commando mission of vital importance, and the fact that it is based more or less on a true story, makes for a very interesting plot.
There's a bit of Bond in it without the high tech gadgets and superhuman prowess as well as some Die Hard but paced for an earlier generation.  Well worth watching for war movie fans.",1389657600,2,718,4.281481481481482

118105,5,0790734966,"During World War II, German submarines were active in the Indian Ocean from mid-1942 and British intelligence in India believed that information relating to commercial ship movements to and from India was being leaked from a shipping office in Bombay to a German spy in Goa - a neutral Portuguese enclave on the western coast of India. The German master spy named Trompeter was resident in Goa and believed to be passing the shipping information to a German merchant ship Ehrenfels interned in Goa harbour. The shipping movements were then passed by a secret radio on the Ehrenfels to German submarines which then proceeded to use that information to locate and sink a large quantity of Allied shipping. Britain could not risk offending neutral Portugal by mounting an attack on Ehrenfels by a conventional British raiding force so the British special forces in India enlisted the support of the Calcutta Light Horse for the raid on Ehrenfels. The Calcutta Light Horse was a territorial unit composed of ageing British expatriates keen to serve their country despite their age and lack of physical fitness. ""The Sea Wolves"" is based on the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boarding-Party/dp/0755101359/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boarding Party</a>&nbsp;by James Leasor which provides an interesting but not exactly riveting account of the unconventional and very successful raid by the Calcutta Light Horse on a German ship in a neutral harbour. The Sea Wolves is a marvellous adventure movie with a fine cast that includes Gregory Peck, David Niven, Trevor Howard, Roger Moore, and Barbara Kellerman who plays the beautiful but deadly German spy Mrs Cromwell in Portuguese Goa. She did not appear in the book but she makes a fine addition to the movie. The tense action is leavened by nice touches of humor and a romance that develops between Barbara Kellerman and British special forces officer Roger Moore. I recommend this film highly.

118118,4,0790734966,"During the first 11 days of March 1943, German U-boats sank 12 Allied ships in the Indian Ocean.  The Germans had 3 ships killing time in the neutral harbor of Goa. As a condition of being allowed to stay in the harbor, the Portugal government removed their radio transmission equipment.  However the Germans managed to have a secret transmitter hidden on one of their ships and they were guiding German U-boats against Allied ships in the Indian Ocean.  Their information on the allied ships was incredibly accurate, and they were incredibly deadly.

Because of Portugal's neutrality the British could not do anything by force, but at the current rate of losing 1 ship a day they had to risk action secretly.  Col. Lewis Pugh and Capt. Gavin Stewart (played by Gregory peck and Roger Moore respectively) went to the area to snoop around and find the spies and determine which German ship was transmitting the information. Once they had information the British government still could not act on it, but they remembered that 1,400 miles away in Calcutta was a source of possible help. A group of civilian bankers, merchants and solicitors were the remains of an old territorial unit called The Calcutta Light Horse. Col. W. H. Grice (played by David Niven) headed up the Light Horse group.

Old and retired they might be but each and every one of these men would eagerly give their all in service of their country in the war and were eager to volunteer for the mission. The only information they were given was that there was a chance they could help their country but would have no support, recognition, or pay for their help - and the danger was great.  To the man, they eagerly volunteered without a second thought. Because of the brave and daring efforts of these men, many ships and lives were saved.

This appears to be a story based on an actual event.  Gregory Peck is fairly old in this movie, but still very handsome.  Roger Moore's character is just like his 007 roles - but in this as in his Bond role I just don't buy him as a ladies man. (I guess I find it hard to believe any woman would find him so appealing, as he seems to be so boring to me).

118125,2,0790734966,"This film is a World War II drama that lacks romance and the action one might expect of a war movie.

Even the isolated attempts to be humorous fail, as a retired group of veterans volunteer to board three German freighters, anchored off the coast of India. One has been transmitting locations of British shipping to a predatory German U-boat.

The story is true and the plot is sound enough. However, the screen writing and direction wastes the acting talents of Gregory Peck, Davin Niven, Roger Moore, Trevor Howard, and Patrick Macnee and reduce the overall film appeal to much less than what is otherwise could have offered had these actors been given a free hand. (And it was clear they did not have that luxury).

Roger Moore has a romantic scene or two with Barbara Kellerman that is non-romantic, dull, and without either purpose or expectation. And so goes the entire movie.

Do not listen to attempts to compare this film with ""The Guns of Navarone"" or ""The Dirty Dozen"". Those were great movies, and although the theme of ""Sea Wolves"" could have offered the same interest, it didn't--it did not.",1339459200,,1106,4.744791666666667
118126,4,0790734966,"Truth really is stranger than fiction. This movie proves it. It took place in 1943, but the documents were not declassified until 1978. I'm not surprised someone grabbed it for a movie: it's an amazing story.

David Niven is a member of the Calcutta Light Horse, a British regiment that has not seen duty since the Boer war. Nonetheless, every single member volunteered for whatever they could do as soon as WWII was declared. As the story opens, most of what they have done is sit around their club house and listen to the radio reports of what's going on in the war, cheering on the chaps that are fighting, and envying them.

Gregory Peck is a secret agent of some sort. When Niven asks him what he does in the war, he says, ""odd jobs."" Niven says that if he should ever get a job so odd that nobody else can or will do it, remember the Calcutta Light Horse.

Roger Moore is also a British secret agent (type-casting, eh?), and he and Peck are told to think up a way to get through a spy ring operating out of ""neutral"" Goa, a Portuguese colony on the Indian west coast. Of course, since it is in neutral territory, they must not be identified as English. In fact, they had better not be identified at all.

Three Nazi ships have been anchored in the harbor for months, nominally impounded by the Portuguese. Problem is, there's also a U-boat prowling the harbor and environs, which has had terribly accurate information about allied ships coming in range, and has sunk at least a dozen in the last month. One of the ships has a radio transmitter on it, and is sending spy information to the U-boat.

Peck remembers that Niven predicted the entire Calcutta Light Horse would want in on the project to sink the Nazi ship with the transmitter on it. He was right. They beg to go along.

Of course, we have to have a beautiful and mysterious woman in the story for Roger Moore to seduce and/or be seduced by. What happens to her, and who she is, I will leave to the movie to disclose.

This is too good a story to ruin by telling you too much. I will say, though, that it never pays to consider any brave soldier too old.",1337040000,,2121,4.3544303797468356

118151,4,0790734966,"This 1980 movie seemed to sit in between two generations of styles of war movie, and as a result seems to have fallen through the cracks of communal memory for many.  It's a shame, as it's a decent movie, fun, doesn't take itself too seriously - but gripping enough to represent the factual story it depicts, and of course has a hugely entertaining cast clearly having a ball.
During WW II, an aging group of ex Boer War veterans, now forming a territorial style home guard in India known as the Calcutta Light Horse, are roped into action in a piece of skullduggery and sabotage on a German vessel in which has become a thorn in the side of the Royal Navy.  Unfortunately, it is in Goa, a neutral Portuguese port, and no regular military mission can be mounted, hence our aging heroes for whom the British government can maintain plausible deniability, spring into action.
Gregory Peck and Roger Moore are the military espionage string pullers who lead the operation, David Niven, Trevor Howard and a host of British character actors play the Calcutta Light Horse, and Patrick Macnee and Barbara Kellerman round out the stellar cast in other roles.
It's old fashioned movie making, Boys Own adventure style, with the pace and script not short on humor, but it's a serious war movie too, which relies more on the build up and background than a climax, which may be disappointing in the action stakes to a modern movie audience.  To be honest, most of the fun is in watching these actors on the screen together for one more time, before the 80's blockbusters thrust a new generation of actors and movie styles into the limelight.
John Glenn, veteran editor of many Bond movies, proficiently pieces together the action scenes to maximize tension, while experienced director Andrew McLaglen tries to walk a tightrope between historical re-enactment and big starring blockbuster... he makes a pretty good stab at it, but perhaps the end result may seem somewhat compromised for trying to keep a foot so firmly in both camps.  Certainly the cinematography is uninspired workmanlike fare, and the costumes say more about 1980 than they do about 1943.
Don't nitpick though, it's good fun, with a cracking cast - I recommend it for an undemanding watch.  Solid proponents of the MTV generation of movie making might want to stay clear.",1238630400,4,2327,4.822055137844612

The first half is some flavorful, if slow moving, cloak-and-dagger spy stuff in wartime India.  Then we get to the Sea Wolves tale of golden oldies doing their part for the war effort, and the tone becomes agreeably rousing.

Peck tries, and he's likable if simply not convincing.  Always lackadaisical Moore isn't helped by his character being so foolish.  For the final scenes you're on the edge of your seat, not just in suspense, but as you worry about frail David Niven taking a fall.

On one hand, we also know that the Portuguese authorities dismantled the ships' radios when they gave them permission to stay there... On the other, if Radio Monitoring is right, and the transmitter is actually in the harbor, it must be on a ship...

Not being able to break the code, the British Intelligence has to find out from where the information to those U-boats originates... To find whoever heads the spy ring, and to get rid of the transmitter without forgetting to violate Portugal's neutrality...

Now if a British Commando cannot violate Goa's neutral status, they might have to turn to amateurs... The Light Horse has not been in action as a unit since the Boer War in 1900... If they were caught, it might be taken as a drunken escapade... We are speaking about ex-soldiers on holiday, stealing a river ferry, sailing it the whole way round India from Calcutta to Cochin... and then heading for the neutral port of Mormugoa, Portuguese colony...

118155,5,0790734966,"Recently, we read Roger Moore's book ""My Word is my Bond"" and thanks to this excellent biography of all the work accomplished by Roger Moore, we became familiar with movies we had never seen by our favorite... Bond, James Bond. So, we are trying to see all his films.

In The Sea Wolves, Roger Moore stars with Gregory Peck, David Niven, Trevor Howard and Barbara Kellerman among many wonderful stars.

The plot revolves around retired British military men who now form part of ""The Calcutta Light Horse,"" a club where they play games, drink, party, and reminisce about the days when they lived the action of war.

Goa, a Portuguese colony, is India's smallest state in terms of area and the fourth smallest in population. Located on the west coast of India, it is located in the region known as the Konkan. To the north we find Maharashtra, to the east and south Karnataka and to the west, the Arabian Sea. In his book, Roger Moore tells us that the film took place close to Christmas and they wanted to have a meal as they did back home, with turkey, stuffing, Christmas pudding and all the trimmings, so they set out to recreate an English meal in Goa... to no avail.

This film is based on a true story. In 1943, German merchant ships used to gather information and sink Allied war vessels. Two British officers, masterfully played by Roger Moore and Gregory Peck are sent to Goa to search for clues as to how the information is relayed and to put a stop to the casualties. Roger Moore meets a woman and falls in love with her without realizing that she is dangerous to say the least.

The design a plan to sink the German ships and they turn for help to the retired military men of The Calcutta Light Horse Club. These men can't wait to get into action and it is quite fun to see the preparation they undergo to get back in shape. Patrick Macnee of the series ""The Avengers"" is part of the team. At first we did not recognize him because he was missing his John Steed umbrella and hat, but the voice gave him away.

As the movie progresses, the men learn that their mission entails destroying German ships and it is quite fun to see how delighted they are to get back into action after over 40 years of rest.

Thanks to Roger Moore's book, we also learn lots about the close relationship the actor had with both Gregory Peck and David Niven and how Niven discovers that he suffered from motor neurone disease because while he walked his daily routine, he could not lift his heel off the ground.

The film is based on a great story and on real facts, the action is superb and the plot, interesting and filled with humor.",1229990400,21,2624,4.429460580912863

118158,4,0790734966,"In the vein of many buddy action movies like The Guns of Navarone, The Magnificent Seven, and The Dirty Dozen, The Sea Wolves takes the basic premise, a group of men working together to perform a mission, and adds a unique factor...what if the men were senior citizens who haven't been in combat for over 40 years?  In early 1943, German U-boats are sinking Allied ships left and right, killing the replacements and destroying badly needed supplies.  British intelligence figures out the Germans are transmitting the location of the ships from a neutral port in Goa on the Indian coast. The only problem is that because of the neutral waters, the British can't send commandos in.  Intelligence turns to the Calcutta Light Horse, veterans of the Boer War at the turn of the century, to stop the transmissions and destroy the German ships.  Part of the fun of the movie is watching these veterans, well into their 60s and 70s by 1943, getting ready and adjusting to a mission they've been waiting years to do.  The movie is patient in its pacing, but that's part of the fun, allowing the storyline to develop along with the cast, but more about that later.  The Sea Wolves blends some good laughs and enough action to appease most fans.  If you're a fan of ""men on a mission"" movies, this is pretty close to a sure thing!

 What sets this movie apart from being an average WWII adventure is the cast, from the leads all the way to the supporting characters. Gregory Peck heads the cast as Col. Lewis Pugh, a British Intelligence officer who must turns to his old comrades-in-arms when the special mission arises.  Peck tries a British accent that goes in and out, but it's Gregory Peck, the performance is good regardless.  Taking a break from the Bond movies, Roger Moore plays Capt. Gavin Stewart, Peck's right hand man who helps organize the mission.  In a way, Moore is playing a toned down Bond here.  Reuniting with Peck after the huge success of The Guns of Navarone 18 years earlier, David Niven is very good in a somewhat small role as Col. W.H. Grice, the leader of the remaining Calcutta Light Horse veterans.  Niven and Peck are perfect in their scenes together.  Trevor Howard in a small cameo-ish type part is Jack Cartwright, a veteran trying to avenge his son's death in Burma with Moore's help.  Barbara Kellerman is perfectly sinister and beautiful as Mrs. Cromwell, a woman Stewart meets who may know more than she's letting on.  The best part of the supporting cast is seeing all the character actors as the members of the CLH including Kenneth Griffith, Patrick Macnee, Allan Cuthbertson, Percy Herbert, Donald Houston, Graham Stark, and Jack Watson among many others.  They aren't given many lines, but just having them in the movie gives it an even bigger sense of credibility.

 And while the DVD looks great in its widescreen presentation (fullscreen is included too, but does anyone actually watch that version?), there's nothing in terms of special features, not even a trailer.  I know much of the cast has passed on, but an interview with Roger Moore would have been great here.  Still, the movie is excellent on its own so don't choose not to buy it just because of the lack of features.  An excellent WWII adventure with a great cast, don't miss The Sea Wolves!

118161,5,0790734966,"I stumbled across ""The Sea Wolves"" in the Bargain Bin at Walmart in VHS before I found it at Amazon on DVD. I had just finished viewing the complete James Bond set, and I noticed that this title starred Roger Moore, in addition to Gregory Peck, David Niven, Patrick Macnee, and Trevor Howard. (And a multitude of great character actors.) So, I picked it up, and I'm glad I did.

The story is, in brief, about a WWII commando mission pulled off by a bunch of Boer War and WWI veterans who were working in British India in ""essential' non-military jobs, keeping chemical plants and factories going to provide war materiel for the Allied effort. Their jobs are important, safe, and frustrating since they feel that they are not 'doing their part' in the war. The mission they accept is critical, dangerous, and very complicated because of the politics of 'Neutrality"" practiced by non-combative countries like Portugal. Three German freighters have been 'interned' in the neutral Portuguese port of Goa, and they are part of a spy network sending information to German U-Boats that then sink Allied cargo ships in the Indian Ocean. That the ""ragtag band of warriors"" will succeed is self evident from the beginning, but HOW they succeed is what makes this a good story. The ""HOW"" involves digging out German spies, bedroom murders, bribery of 'neutral' politicians, and sexual intrigue ending in murder.

Gregory Peck plays the confident, strong leader tasked with making it happen. Roger Moore plays the somewhat 'sleazy' agent who does whatever has to be done to succeed, while managing to bed 'Mata Hari' in the process. And David Niven plays the character he always seems to play, the war weary, highly competent older character who is always comes through in the end. Patrick Macnee plays an enigmatic explosives expert who is tasked with making, or breaking, the mission in the end.

What sets this film apart is that it is based on a true story; a saga that came to light as a result of the British version of the ""Freedom of Information Act"" that released extensive records of World War II missions in the late 60's and early 70's. It combines inspiring heroics, perfectly placed humor, and an exciting plot with believable characters and excellent casting to give us an enjoyable and engaging movie. I loved every minute, as I seem to in every movie I review! (It might be that I don't make it all the way through the 'stinkers'!)

When this movie was made (In 1980), Gregory Peck was relatively late in his career, and he was well cast as the mission commander. Roger Moore, in the middle of his James Bond run, carried the Bond 'charisma' over into this role. David Niven was getting up there in age, and it was evident that he strained to complete the film. (A tribute to his long history of professionalism) However, it is precisely the nature of the cast that made it one of my favorites.

Since the early 90's, we have been inundated with films about various Arab-Isreali conflicts, Kosovo, The Gulf Wars, and even flashbacks of Viet Nam. What differentiates ""The Sea Wolves"" is that this is one of the last of the 'genre' that included actors of the age who not only experienced the reality of war (Having served with distinction in WWII and Korea) but also made no bones about the pride and patriotism that motivated them to serve. The Sea Wolves doesn't showcase 'chicken' actors like George Clooney who put on a uniform and pretend to play soldier and then feel qualified to interject their opinions about war and politics to anybody unfortunate to get in the way of their tirades. The film showcases men who lived through the hell of real war, did their best, and then got on with their lives.

This is not meant to be a political statement, but the movie shows a multitude of the faces of war; some exciting, some horrifying, and some just necessary. Watch it if you can.",1172966400,3,3889,4.711764705882353
