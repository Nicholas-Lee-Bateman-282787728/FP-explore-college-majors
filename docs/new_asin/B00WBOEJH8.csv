8712853,4,B00WBOEJH8,"Never thought I would give any Roberto Carlos DVD or CD less than 5 stars - but I write this review in protest.  The music is great, as always.  And thank you, Maestro Lages for including ""Brazil"" in the concert.  What a lovely surprise.  Eduardo Lages is the master of music arranging.  He is the designer of Roberto's music and what it takes to bring out its best.  He takes songs like ""Cavalgada"" and ""Forca Estranha"" to great heights.  Lages is truly the power behind Roberto's throne.
I must be honest and tell you I found the DVD/CD set on Amazon from a different seller.  There was just one
seller offering that combination, and currently, it is no longer available.  I also purchased from that seller, the ""Duetos 2"" DVD/CD combination here on Amazon, and that set is also off the market.  Roberto's new
releases are being offered by only one or two third party sellers, keeping the price so high, this customer would not have been able to afford both the DVD's and CD's separately.  Why Sony or whoever determines the availability of Roberto's new releases are being so frugal in distribution is a mystery.  I can't see the benefit for anyone in this new system.  I hope Roberto's future releases will be more available to consumers.

The Vegas concert is primarily in Portugese with some songs in Spanish thrown in the last quarter.  It is a most generous concert in length.  Encores unnecessary for that reason.  My complaint is that Roberto pretty much slams the door on Americans who are not of Hispanic or Portugese lineage and can only understand English.  He does sing two songs in English which are lovely, but he talks with his audience much more than I've ever seen him do in the past -  but in Portugese.  For me, I prefer his music in Portugese.  But none of his music nor his conversations with the audience have English subtitles on any of his DVD's.  It's clear Roberto has no interest in English-only speaking America - but there are some like myself who do love him and his music - who fly from their homes to see him.  I've attended two concerts and had no idea what he said to his audience.  Another fan from Washington State sat right behind me in '12, and she like me, missed out on the personal flavor Roberto gives his concerts when he speaks to his fans.  We do not get the benefit of all of Roberto's performance.
Roberto is no way thoughtless.  He loves his audience and people in general - but he forgets the world is a small place these days and he can't escape that folks like myself are finding him.  I've gone from Seattle to Los Angeles twice to see him - met him in 2014.  Perhaps Roberto can't imagine that I and others like me care what he thinks, what he says to his audience.  I for one do care.  At least he should include English subtitles in his DVD's.  He shuts out the fans who are unable to understand a word he is saying to the audience. This latest DVD definitely made this fan feel excluded.  Surely he could find a good translator to tour with him.  At the very least, a translator who can put English subtitles on his DVD's. Sony should pay for translator services as it would only broaden Roberto's fan base - if that's possible!

Roberto jazzed up some of his old favorites and this concert is definitely not the same one I saw in Los Angeles three days later.  I had hoped they would be the same, but he changed the theme - most likely because he always sings primarily in Spanish in LA and as mentioned, sang mostly in Portugese in Vegas.  But both concerts are and were exciting and fresh, even though he stayed with his old favorites.  I would love to see him renew some of his old songs that are equally beautiful.  But Roberto must have his reasons for continuing primarily with his old hits.

No matter what Roberto does, I will remain his most loyal, loving fan forever, accepting that my loyalty may well matter less to him than those who understand/speak Portugese and Spanish.  Roberto is not your average Latin.  He is beloved world wide - and that includes Americans who have lived in our country for generations - born into the English language.  Roberto - please think of us when producing your next DVD.  We want to hear what you have to say.
I give four stars -  to make my point that this is an important facet lacking in Roberto's DVD's, as well as the limited availability for consumers.  But we all know that whatever Roberto writes or sings is always worth 10 stars.",1436832000,,4447,4.469565217391304
