6123441,3,B00GX7WNOA,Cheesy acting. Beautiful actors but cheesy acting. And unrealistic how they would run into each other multiple times in such a large city. I couldn't stand to finish it. Sorry.,1430265600,3,176,4.9

6123444,5,B00GX7WNOA,"This little gem of a movie surprised me a lot. It is exquisitely done! The sweetness of the romance stirred places in my heart that haven't been stirred in quite some time by a movie... and I watch a lot. I had but one complaint about the casting. The guy who plays Michael's boss was a bit wooden in his acting, and overdid it. But, I could forgive the movie this infraction because he wasn't onscreen enough to totally bother me. Mei Mei's character was such a little gold-digger and opportunist that I almost didn't like her. I could see though, how someone like her could be the way she was. My favorite part was the meeting of Anna's grandfather. Sean Farris did a superb job of playing the honorable beau who is caught off guard by a well-meaning family member. Just watch it!",1428624000,5,782,4.4375

its night views of HK are magnificent is . But this alone is not the reason to see this movie.
While an interracial love story movies set in Hong Kong are not uncommon all except Lost For Words
IMHO lack depth. Lost for Words engages the viewer but not overwhelmingly so in some
some thought provoking issues. You will enjoy this love story.",1475452800,2,433,4.493670886075949

6123474,2,B00GX7WNOA,"Unfortunately the stiff dialogue, loose ends and failure to capture the characters fully did not help this movie at all. Like other reviewers, I found the ending to literally drop off and leave you hanging, and not in a good tension kind of way.

For me it was a great movie and I would have liked to see it continue so we know what actually happened to these people instead of trying to figure it out on our own.

6123516,2,B00GX7WNOA,"Sean Faris is way-too stereotypical as a Marine. He comes off terribly arrogant, angry, emotionally-stunted, and very snobbish--not the ""wounded,"" sympathetic character he probably meant to portray. I found myself thinking ""no wonder your wife left you!"" and more superficially, ""please, please wash your hair!""  The lead actress, however, was actually quite good; very believable.  I agree with the other reviewers that this movie lacked substance and flow.  Because there are gaping holes in the story line, there is no emotion resonating between the characters.  The writers could have capitalized on the tension between the lead actress (Anna) and her conniving, money-hungry friend (Mei Mei), but they didn't so that turns out to be unresolved tension between so-called ""best friends.""  When I wasn't looking away from Sean Faris' dirty hair, I kept thinking, ""why is she friends with someone who is so obviously superficial and jealous?""  Ugh!  So, aside from Sean Faris' bad acting, the overall casting was horrid. It's a shame because I really wanted to like this movie.",1462752000,,1078,5.305882352941176

6123518,5,B00GX7WNOA,"I never take time to write reviews of movies. But for this one, I have to make an exception. This was one of the more profoundly moving movies we have watched lately. A quite, slow paced film about people discovering each other across cultures and falling in love. With some of the most realistic dialog and acting I think I have ever seen in a film. This will NOT meet any of your stereotypes for a romantic film. It is not a comedy. It is profoundly moving and satisfying. A revelation of two hearts and minds.

Ultimately the cinematography was good, the characters, while they could have been fleshed out a bit more, were believable and sympathetic.  Definitely worth a watch.  However, the cliffhanger ending was not a good plot move and I would imagine left most viewers (including this one) cold and disappointed.  While not all life is about sunsets and happy endings, this is one movie that actually needed it.  Four stars instead of five for the slight lack of character development and ending.  Good supporting cast.",1445472000,3,616,4.980392156862745

There was a soft and gentle ambiance developed in this story that was undergirded by a tough and thoughtful story line.  This is a movie for thoughtful, perhaps more mature , viewers who can appreciate the subtle nuances and depths of relationships and experiences of life. The expressiveness of the actors, the cinematography  and the delicacy of the love scenes were all welcome reprieves from so many wham bang thank you ma'am, in your face roller coaster rides of so many modern movies.

6123552,3,B00GX7WNOA,"So this is a film about meeting new people and the relationship and
commitment that develops/ensues between the title character and someone
he meets while taking a job internationally (as an ex-patriot).
The director's intentions were good.  The storyline was generally good.
The acting was decent but not great. I really wanted to like this movie, but in
the end, it was difficult. There were definitely some good moments, and also
situations or scenes which were hard to believe. Some were cliche' but not
overly so. All in all, and honestly, the film was slow and a bit boring.
One of the things I didn't like about this movie was the ending, which
was eluded to, but not given away, in the very beginning. It was like there
was no definite ending. It left you guessing, and maybe hoping, but also
doubting that there would be a positive outcome. I actually was hoping for an
ending/outcome that the viewers wouldn't like, AKA, an unhappy ending
where the guy doesn't get the girl (or her ex-boyfriend in her hometown does).
Why? Because that is real life. Life isn't fair, and sometimes things don't go
as planned or desired. Sometimes there is tragedy. This is real life, and it's
more honest, -than the happy ending we always want.
The movie though, left you with neither a happy or an unhappy ending. It left
you hanging. You sort of had to (possibly erroneously) assume that there would be
a happy ending. There is some nice scenery and visuals (cinematography), but it's
ultimately not enough to rescue this film. So all in all, I can't recommend it,
and would rate it 2.5 STARS. There are better films out there.",1439078400,11,1622,4.6912280701754385

6123558,5,B00GX7WNOA,"""Lost for Words"" is a beautiful East meets West love story. The cast is outstanding.  Joman Chiang literally steals the show. The film showcases Hong Kong.  Not to be missed is the scene when Sean Faris and Grace Huang ride the glass bottom cable car to the top of the mountain - a breathtaking and exhilarating experience.

Also available on the DVD are some special features - there is behind the scene documentary, commentaries from the Director and actor Sean Faris and two deleted scenes.  These features are quite interesting.  Well worth getting the DVD instead of just the video on demand.",1433116800,,597,4.813725490196078

6123564,5,B00GX7WNOA,"There are wines that take years to age to perfection. This movie has a slow beautiful pace and grace that I did not at first understand. This isn't a movie that is going to talk to you about how the characters are feeling, it takes you there. Always understated, the actors slowly show you what they are feeling and why. A veteran torn up, closed off, his marriage wrecked, finds his way to a new love in simple slow steps with a cautious Chinese woman. The woman is conservative by her upbringing and inclination yet never really backs off from her growing relationship. The Grandfather is someone that comes close to your heart when you would never expect it. The protagonist and the Grandfather find they have much in common as courage, family, and country, are something both have fought for. This is a film that requires patience from the viewer but is it ever worth it.",1430870400,3,875,4.579617834394904

8628336,2,B00GX7WNOA,"A poorly assembled film.  The plot line goes no where, the ending is abrupt and pointless.  It is supposed to be a love story, and the female lead is certainly an exceptional woman, but it is hard to believe that the male lead falls in love with her when he is so low energy and just kind of vacant.  A subplot is developed about the roommate and her liaison with a member of the board of directors for the ballet company both girls dance in, but the time devoted to this relationship makes no sense, and the roommate 's only purpose seems to be to serve as a foil for the female lead, underscoring her innocence and, for lack of a better term, lack of promiscuity.  On the plus side, there are nicely filmed scenes of Hong Kong,  a glimpse of the countryside, and some nice dance  sequences, and from time to time, little snippets about Chinese culture are shared.  If you are interested in traveling to China, or just learning more about the country, you might find watching this movie worth while.",1503878400,,1000,4.4316939890710385
