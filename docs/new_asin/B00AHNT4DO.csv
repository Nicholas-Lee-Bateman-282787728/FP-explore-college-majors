Forbidden Hollywood (pre-code) collections and MANY other pre-code's. --- Always searching for quality older films and classics I was VERY pleasantly surprised when I was able to view this film.  -- Let's Look at all the makings of great... Frank Borzage was the director.  Spencer Tracy the Male lead And Loretta Young the female lead. -- The story is very well written and feels authentic and non contrived in every aspect.-- When Tracy and Young interact their characters fit like a glove. Tracy and his character bring a great enthusiasm and energy that's a joy to experience. Many precode's have weak and uninteresting plots, the acting is weak or somewhat weak but this film can hold a candle to any A picture. The moral circumstances are dealt with frankness and we don't get the feel that we are being patronized. -- AND I'm not even a Tracy nor Young fan one way or the other -- To me these are some of both actors best performances. ---CRITERION is releasing Borzage's MOONRISE this coming May so I sure hope we see a CRITERION MAN""S CASTLEsoon.  Send your emails and fill your want list (here on Amazon) to the issuing studio, Criterion, Classic Flix, Etc. Etc. as it does need a restoration and really deserves one. ---Hope this info helps you out",1519084800,,1507,4.611940298507463
