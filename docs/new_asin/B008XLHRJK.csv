8532234,3,B008XLHRJK,"I have only watched a couple of the compilation of films thus far, namely ""The Lady Vanishes"" and ""Algiers.""  I liked ""The Lady Vanishes.""  It's a quirky, somewhat claustrophobic kind of movie, but the balance of elements is quite good, and the film's physical quality is good.  I can't say the same for ""Algiers.""  This is a film that needs digital restoration very badly.  I can watch Hedy Lamarr in anything, so although ""Algiers"" has it's flaws (beyond the physical), I still regard it as a must-see classic.  The film was made in 1938, so the technical flaws of watching it in 2013 are outweighed by the performances of Hedy Lamarr and Charles Boyer.",1361836800,4,655,4.701754385964913
