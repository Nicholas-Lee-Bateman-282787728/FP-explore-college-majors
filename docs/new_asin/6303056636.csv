7836597,5,6303056636,"Acorn Media released 15 VHS tapes in the Swiss Rail Journeys series, a railfan's travelogue on the various railroads, public and private, that criss-cross Switzerland. (The programs were originally broadcast on BBC and PBS in the 1990s.) These are all high-quality productions, shot from a variety of viewpoints ranging from trackside, to engineer's cabin, to passenger view, to helicopter shots. ""Arosa"" is IMO the best of the 15. The Raetische Bahn railcars travel from Chur upward to the resort town of Arosa, high in the Alps. Although the actual journey doesn't take much more time than the 50 minutes covered in this tape, there isn't a moment that isn't wonderfully scenic. Original music accompanies much of the video along with narration. Most of the rail equipment pictured in the video series is dated and has now been replaced with more modern rolling stock, but I wish I had been there when the Arosa train included two topless passenger cars as it does in this video. Acorn has never released these on US-format DVDs, and that's a shame.",1451174400,,1051,4.943502824858757

7836599,5,6303056636,"I loved the presentation! Not too much narration. Nice music, and good combination of on board cameras and aerial photography! Just like being there!",1398384000,,149,5.25
7836600,5,6303056636,"These six videos, and the nine that follow, are done the way documentaries should be done. Narration is no more than absolutely necessary, the background music adds to the production and never intrudes, and the image quality is about as good as you can get on VHS tape. Favorite in this set is Arosa Line and Brunig Line parts 1 and 2 -- absolutely breathtaking. There is a good deal of technical and historic railroad information presented, probably for the British trainspotter hobbyists. Following the six videotapes in Swiss Rail Journeys I, there are another six in set II and three more in set III. So far as I can tell, these are still the only ones available in the US from the 24 total programs produced by MITV.  (The full set of 24 is sold on DVD by MITV on its Web site, but only in European PAL format, so unless you own a PAL to NTSC converter, you're out of luck there.)",1256601600,,885,4.396341463414634

7836603,5,6303056636,"These videos are fantastic especially for train buffs. There is a lot of technical narration about locomotive model numbers, gradient information, etc. that will bore most viewers, but Euro-railroad fans and those of you who have travelled by train in Europe should really enjoy it. The scenery is spectacular. Footage comes from inside the cab or from helicopters artfully filming the trains on days of the most spectacular weather (that I can hardly remember over 4 years of Army duty near the Swiss border!). The producers picked the choicest of days to film the trains. A catchy ""sticks in your head"" musical score is used throughout the video series. Anyone who has travelled by train in Switzerland or Germany will love these videos. I watch them over and over.",1178496000,,767,4.953488372093023
7836604,5,6303056636,"I have many, many videos in all types of genre.  This is one of the few box sets that stays close to the VCR for viewing.  I've viewed all the tapes in this box set and they're all high quality railway videos.  The editing of train, landscape and points-of-interest shots merge nicely with a comprehensive, yet non-obsessive narration.  Some of the technical information may seem to be over-the-top for some viewers, but it's not the basis for these videos.  The narration includes historical, technical, tourism and demographical information. In all, a well rounded description of the railway that the viewer is traveling.",1044576000,2,623,5.068627450980392
7836605,5,6303056636,"""Breathtaking Alpine Scenery and rich history of Switzerland are beautifully documented. Each program takes you on a different journey, explaining the history and working of the rail system itself, and stopping  along the way to tour fashionable resort towns, castles, and other  attractions that make Switzerland one of the worlds most popular travel  destinations."" This series of broadcast quality Swiss Rail travel  videos was produced by former BBC producers Sue Knight and Chris Harnett.  The series has been broadcast on PBS so the quality is first rate. The six  tapes include The Albula Line: Chur to St. Moritz. The Davos Line:  Landquart to Davos and Filisur. The Montreaux-Ovberland Bernous Railway  (MOB) Montreaux to Zweisimmen. The Arosa Line: Chur to Arosa. The Bruening  Line, Part 1: Interlaken to Meringen. The Bruening Line, Part 2: Meringen  to Luzern. My wife and I watch these over and over again to plan for a rail  tour of Switxerland. It's almost like being there. VHS Stereo approx. 50  minutes each. Highly recommended.",948067200,9,1047,5.203592814371257
