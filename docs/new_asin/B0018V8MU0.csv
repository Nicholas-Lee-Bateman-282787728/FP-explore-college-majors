8271245,3,B0018V8MU0,"This video shows Christians street witnessing to the lost using the Ten Commandments as an effective Biblical tool to reveal how ""good"" they are in the eyes of God. Even the apostle Paul would not have known sin except by the Law (Romans 7:7). Believers and unbelievers alike break most if not all of the Ten Commandments every day. And when the Holy Spirit open the eyes of an unbeliever, there is a conviction of sin and hope for Salvation. At that point, believers should move to explain to that unbeliever that there is salvation from Hell by acknowledging, confessing, and repenting of sins to God and accepting Jesus into their heart by the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, and to grow by fellowship in a Bible-based church, prayer, and regular reading of the Word of God in preparation for eternity in Heaven. That is The Gospel of Christ.

In the video, the Ten Commandment are presented to unbelievers and they are asked if they have ever lied, stolen, lusted (adultery), hated anyone (murder), used God's name in vain, worshipped idols, etc. The obvious answers lead to a conviction that is seen clearly in their hearts and on their faces. Then, they are told (by believers) that if they die without being saved, God is going to judge them on Judgement Day by the Ten Commandments and send them to Hell. That is 100% pure blasphemy! Nowhere in the Scriptures is there even a hint that anyone will be judged by the Ten Commandments at the Great White Throne Judgement reserved for the lost (Revelation 20:11-15). Their names will not be in the Lamb's Book of Life because they rejected the Lamb of God who took away the sins of the world; Jesus Christ. The lost are going to Hell because they refused God's plan of salvation, not because they refused the Ten Commandments.

In the video, Jesus is presented subtly as a patch to Heaven because of our inability to live obediently by the Ten Commandments. That is NOT what Christ came to earth for. Salvation by faith in Christ alone is eventually preached to the unbeliever but only after the damage has been done. The lost need to hear the Gospel, the whole Gospel, and nothing but the Gospel.

Galatians 3:22-25
""But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed. Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.""

Galatians 5:4
""You have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.""",1260921600,,2693,4.615866388308977
