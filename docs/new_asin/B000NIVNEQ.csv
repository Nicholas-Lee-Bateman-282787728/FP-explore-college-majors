8446359,3,B000NIVNEQ,I wish they did all the workouts on both sides. I buy DVDs to do them along with the instructors. Otherwise I'd look up moves and do them on my own. Also the backround isn't much to look at...and to make it worse the resolution isn't very good at all. I mean it looks like a VHS tape. The other DVDs in the series. Are only $5-$6 here on Amazon this is $15. Id be satified if it were only $7 or so.,1489449600,,398,3.8072289156626504
