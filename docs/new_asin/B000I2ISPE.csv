8143170,3,B000I2ISPE,"This movie is two short films, not quite enough for a proper anthology movie. There isn't even a wrap around story. A man introduces each segment, similar to the twilight zone set up. Its an extremely low budget film and the quality and special effects are lacking. The first story with the students participating in a drug testing and becoming linked with a killer, was interesting. The second story with the aliens dragged quite a bit.

The acting was alright. No one was especially terrible, and seemed confident in front of the camera.",1444521600,,539,4.795698924731183
