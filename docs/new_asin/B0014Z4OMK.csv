In many ways, it can be considered a movie because it fully renacts the events which led up to the most famous sinking of World War I.

To this day, no one can say for sure what caused it; whether it was a coal dust explosion, boilers or even the war supplies rumored to have been aboard near where the torpedo hit. Unfortunatley, the docu-drama does not go into detail as to what may have caused the secondary explosion. The feature does recreate the heart-breaking aftermath of the sinking; the recovery of floating bodies in Queenstown (now Cobh) Southern Ireland; the trial held the month after; and the fate of some of those who survivied.

The story of the Lusitania coincides with her great rival TITANIC; its the story of one of the world's most luxurious, biggest and fastest ships that ever existed. And like the story of Titanic, the richest people in the world traveled aboard her during this final voyage.

3136393,4,B0014Z4OMK,"The ""Lusitania,"" Cunard Line's early twentieth century wonder, is an often overlooked, though very worthy historical subject. ""Sinking of the 'Lusitania'"" is a docu-drama told through the eyes of a surviving Scottish academic, Professor Ian Holbourn (John Hannah.) The plot intertwines World War One tensions, the failure of the British Admiralty to protect the great liner, and life onboard the ""Lusitania"" and the German submarine that sunk her, the U-20. To fill out the running time there is a subplot about the friendship between Holbourn and a young girl, Avis Dolphin (Madeleine Garrood,) which I expected to be cloying but which actually turned out to be very well done. The acting in the film is generally quite good, and a special mention needs to go to Kenneth Cranham as Captain Turner, who was superb.

The film has very good sets, especially the ship and submarine interiors, although the effect of the ship on the water and especially when sinking were less than fully credible. The film also advances some theories as facts, and goes out of its way to paint the English in a light that makes them look as culpable as the Germans in the sinking of the ship. The storyline and narration from Holbourn makes this moral equivalence clear. Certainly nobody is sparing the British Admiralty of the responsibilities and it's unquestionable that tragic mistakes were made at high levels, though this film makes the leaders of the Royal Navy into the real enemies of the ""Lusitania,"" rather than the German submariner who elected to fire his torpedo on the liner full of civilians.

I debated on a three versus four star rating for this docu-drama, but settled on four, as despite its flaws, the film is generally quite well made, is captivating to watch, and is historically important. As an aside the absolutely riveting painting of the ship sinking on the cover is duplicated inside the case in a larger format.

8256711,5,B0014Z4OMK,"This docu-drama, made in the disguise of a movie is the ONLY release I know of about the Lusitania.  It was filmed and shown on the BBC with a slightly different beginning, but otherwise the same content is there.  It was originally shown on the BBC as ""Lusitania - Murder On  The Atlantic.""  With just a few alterations, the Discovery Channel is the same movie, only retitled ""Sinking Of The Lusitania - Terror At Sea.""

It is only lately that a number of books have come out on the Lusitania, along with some documentaries (not TV-movies).  Yet, NO theatrical release of the subject has ever been done.  Add to that, most of the mysterious, critical documents on the ship remain classified, top secret.  WHY, after 102 years is this subject so closely guarded?  What is there to hide?  Even the orders to Captain Turner remain secret.

This TV-Movie is an excellent representation of the event - probably the closest we are ever going to see involving the Lusitania.  Diving to the wreck, in only 300 feet of water, has recently been banned by the British and Irish authorities.  THERE IS SOMETHING to hide, or why would they would be acting so guarded like it threatens national security - I don't understand how an event 102 years old could trigger trouble!

The biggest mystery is what caused the second explosion?  If you study the building of the ship, as I have in such reading as ""Lusitania, an Illustrated Biography by J. Kent Layton and ""The Unseen Lusitania"" by Eric Sauder,  two books serious Lusitania students have been crying out for years - to be fair, both books go into the most minute details on the construction of the ship and have a lot of information to absorb, but hundreds of never-before seen pictures of the great liner are included.

Which brings us back to movie, which is correct in saying such a well constructed ship, way superior to the Titanic, because it was built as an auxiliary reserve warship and the construction of everything was dictated by the British Naval Admiralty, right down to the type of plates and rivets used - how could this ship sink in only 18 minutes, when the Titanic, a far less robust vessel, took over two hours to sink?  Another question to ponder involves THIS release of the movie - I bought mine brand new - it was pulled from the shelves after two weeks when it came out by the government, claiming there is too much classified information inferred - WHAT IS IT?????????  I got my copy right away and found another brand new one as a spare.  Today, this title can go anywhere from $60 to $300, which are collector's prices.  How many of the movies that you have available today go for that price????

It was shown once on The Discovery Channel - don't look for a repeat. If you can find a good copy of this movie for a price that does not ""break the bank,"" GET IT!  It is so well done - you won't be sorry.",1487203200,,2872,4.51257253384913

Believe this movie to be the only drama of the incident, although many documentaries have been made.  It is certainly something fans of Titanic and also war buffs will want to see.

In Britain the title was  Lusitania: Murder on the Atlantic, In the British version, the opening is done with a visual narrative (by John Hannah) that is absent from the American production. Also, the British version has a scene that is unflattering to Vanderbilt and is not in the American version. And most interestingly the German reply to the sinking,(included in the American version) is edited out of the British version.

This movie, or Docu-drama. Doesn't really mess around really, it hits the ground running. And even shows you life not only on the Lusitania, but life on the U-boat. And even lets you see the war through their eyes, not that I would be sympathetic to the Nazis anyways. I highly recommend this movie for your collection.",1327536000,2,612,4.728971962616822
