8227602,5,B00000F0ZN,I don't speak french and cannot understand a word of most of this album and don't think it hurts a bit. She is a native french singer and her voice alone is worth the price. The worst songs on the album are the ones in english. I love this album and don't ordinarily like her singing.,1127692800,,284,4.089285714285714
8227603,5,B00000F0ZN,"This video is mainly in French, with a few wonderful English songs.  This video definately shows why Cline is an international superstar.  Her voice is so amazing.  Not only does this video showcase her amazing voice and  talent, but it shows her wonderful personality as well.  The song  ""Calling You"" from ""Bahgdad Caf"" is absolutely amazing  on this video.  The first time I heard that song was when I saw this video  and I was blown away!  Another AMAZING song on the video is ""Quand On  A Que L'amour"".  The song is great, and her voice is even better!  The  songs on this video are mainly from her ""D'eux"" or ""French  Album"" with a few songs from ""Falling Into You"".  Jean-Jacques Goldman makes an appearance on the video as well, to sing  ""J'irai ou tu Iras""  I very highly recommend this video to any  Celine Dion fan - even if you don't speak french.  It's so wonderful!",950832000,8,879,4.477707006369426
8227604,5,B00000F0ZN,"Although Celine sounds great in any language, she seems to have that little something extra when she sings in French...and I don't speak a word. This is without question her best video to date...I only hope it will be  available in DVD some day! From Rock & Roll to French (& English)  ballads, she covers all of the bases. This is a necessity for any true  Celine fan, even if they don't speak French!",945907200,2,402,4.405405405405405
8227605,5,B00000F0ZN,"This video is amazing! It shows Cline doing what she loves to do best - perform infront of her fans! Her voice is especially strong in this video and songs such as ""The Power Of Love"" and ""J'attendais""  beautifully work together to provide a truly breathtaking show. A must see!",944956800,2,278,4.56
8227606,5,B00000F0ZN,"This video is a true testimony to the power of celine. From the minute she appears and belts her contemporary ballads, you can't help but be captivated. she also shows a side of her that doesn't come with her image,  her fast Rock/Dance side. She displays enough energy in this concert to  make you sweat, just watching! She then brings it all home with a song from  her heart. I belive she is the Best performer of all time. And this Video  is a testiment of her gift,energy, and talent. If you like celine , you  must have this!",944179200,,530,4.313131313131313
