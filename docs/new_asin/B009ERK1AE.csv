5322715,5,B009ERK1AE,"The Young Montalbano has turned out to be a delight for our family.  If we could speak Italian, it would probably be even better!  The Young M., as opposed to the older M series, has taken the time to develop the characters so that you know them.  (In the older M. series, it seems like character development was often sacrificed for the crime information).  Most of the characters have quirky personalities and the humor is really light and funny.  The producers picked actors who really look and sound like the original Montalbano series and, as far as prequels go, this is top notch.  Recommended!",1359158400,4,600,4.721153846153846

5322717,5,B009ERK1AE,Great stories. Great characters. Great scenery. It's almost like being in Italy for a little bit. 3 episodes run about 2 hours each.

5322719,5,B009ERK1AE,"I was frankly prepared to be disappointed by this series, particularly since I loved the original Montalbano.  But I was instead pleasantly surprised.  The new series is as intriguing from a ""mystery"" standpoint, young Montalbano is perhaps even more cerebral than his older self, the scenery doesn't disappoint, Livia is far more simpatica than the older Livia, and the whole thing is still fun, particularly for an Italian-speaker who picks up subtleties in language that no subtitle can ever adequately render.
This review applies to episodes 1-6.  I look forward to more.",1356652800,8,575,5.228260869565218
5322720,5,B009ERK1AE,I watched this on TV in Australia last night. It was a 2 hour episode and i would describe this new series as a drama/comedy. It was very witty. Good writing and acting so based on this first episode i ordered the 2 discs from AMAZON whilst watching it.. I believe it was AMAZON US as it was in dollars. Not freely available from AMAZON UK. It is a entertaining series and worth having in your collection.,1356220800,4,405,4.2727272727272725
5322721,5,B009ERK1AE,"After the jarring experience of seeing Montalbano many years younger and just starting out with his career, I gradually warmed to the performance of this young and extremely talented actor.  Indeed, I soon believe I was watching the ""real"" Montalbano, minus a few years.  And even the plot lines follow the same very general pattern, although the plots themselves are --- as in the original series --- rather different.  Definitely a five-star series.",1355356800,20,451,5.1506849315068495
5322722,5,B009ERK1AE,"The Young Montalbano is a prequel to the very popular Detective Montalbano Italian mystery series. The Montalbano shows were originally aired in the United States on the MegaHert<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Detective-Montalbano-Episodes-1-3/dp/B003OXSRW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Detective Montalbano: Episodes 1-3</a>z Networks in the Washington, D.C. area and quickly built a national cult following. Salvo Montablano is a Sicilian detective who works for the police as opposed to what the Italians call ""the flying squad"" and he is one of the great characters of detective fiction. Each of the Montalbano's is a movie in itself, with movie quality production in every sense. There is so much to love about these shows - acting, comedy, cinematography, script - that it is hard to know where to begin.

Young Montalbano shows the early years of Detective Montalbano. When the actors in Montalbano became too expensive or weary of their roles, RAI could not think of substituting others. Followers of Montalbano  are too attached to the characters. So they came up with the Young Montalbano prequel. This sort of thing never works, and yet this time it does. The same qualities that made the original series so popular are evident here. Even though this is a prequel, the stories stand on their own. The common thread of quality through these shows is that the writer of the Montalbano books, on which the series are based, Andrea Camilleri, has stayed directly involved in the productions. He obviously loves and protects the characters.

As good as the young Montalbano is, I think most viewers will wish that they had started with the original Montalbano series. If you haven't seen the original shows, a lot of the references in the Young Montalbano can not be deciphered. The whole Montalbano experience is wonderfully addictive. I have recommended the Montalbanos to many folks and everyone is hooked. And you will pick up a little Sicilian, which is quite distinct from Italian!",1353628800,24,2029,5.4145569620253164
5322723,5,B009ERK1AE,"The Young Montalbano makes us see why the girls fall for the Old Montalbano--(bullet headed, bowlegged, and utterly charming). In this delightful backstory, set in the imaginary town of Vigata on the sea (I covet his house!!!) we meet the young Commissario, who is still bowlegged and utterly charming, but has a full mop of curly hair, and is heartthrobbingly gorgeous! (Che bellissimo!)

The writers and directors have enhanced the plausibility of the entire story by giving us a real history to the established Montalbano series, introducing us to the younger versions of the denizens of the Questura that keeps a watchful eye on the territory between Vigata and Montelusa: Salvo Montalbano is mentored by Fazio's simpatico father; the younger Catarella is as endearingly misbegotten as the older Caterella; young Fazio, straight out of the police academy, is tack-sharp; and lady-killer Mimi Augello, with a full moustache, is full of himself.

We meet the beautiful and usually absent Livia, a perfect match for young Salvo. We also discover exactly why she is absent most of the time, as Salvo  becomes consumed with investigating local petty crimes as well as spectacular murders. Their chemistry blends so well, that we can also understand why she puts up with him after so many years in the later series. We also learn the history of the estrangement between Salvo and his father; and we discover Salvo's continuing love affair with the characteristic cuisine of Sicily, and how Adellina with her succulent -arrancini-(rice croquettes) comes into his life.

This series has everything: intriguing mysteries; glorious settings (It is shot around Ragusa); endearing characters (and every character, down to the cleaning ladies and shopkeepers, is individual rather than stereotypical), haunting Sicilian melodies, and a quirky sense of humor that is very Italian. It is full of gems that will have resonance for anyone who has lived in Italy and Sicily (e.g., special delivery letters sent from one end of Vigata that take five days to arrive at the other end of this very small town).

I have not read the books, but the series has encouraged me to do so. To me, the only drawback to buying this Italian DVD--the image of which is sharp, the sound clear, the subtitles [expunged of salty language] well done--is the price, but it is definitely worth saving for!

I strongly recommend ""Il Giovane Montalbano"" for anyone who loves Italy--and Sicily, of course.",1351987200,44,2466,5.106699751861042
5322724,3,B009ERK1AE,"Principal character/actor is fine, but the supporting cast leaves me cold.  Stories are interesting.  Series is certainly worth it as a prequel to the original series.",1448668800,,167,5.384615384615385

5322729,5,B009ERK1AE,"The Young Montalbano (""Il giovane Montalbano"") is based on the novels
of Italian writer Andrea Camilleri and a prequel (although made later)
to the incredibly popular Inspector Montalbano series. I'm not lazy,
but much of what I write in my review of Inspector Montalbano applies
here, and I'm not going to be a bore and repeat it. The acting, the
production, everything. It all applies. This is perhaps the world's
greatest prequel. I cannot think of any other prequel that rivals it.
It is the best.

Michele Riondino plays Salvo Montalbano. And I will admit, I was
worried about him. How could anyone become the role that Luca
Zingaretti perfected, and is still playing? But Riondino has done it.
It is almost scary in its brazen effortlessness how good Riondino is in
this role. The transition is immediate. I never for a moment doubted
that he is Montalbano. There is no suspension of disbelief needed. It
is simply breathtaking.

And it is wonderful seeing how beloved characters in Inspector
Montalbano, who we have come to take for granted as our dear friends,
characters like Mimi and Fazio, come to be. How Livia (perhaps the love
of Salvo's life?) comes to be.

And I just need to expand on this a bit because it is why The Young
Montalbano may be the world's greatest prequel: The ""young"" Fazio, the
""young"" Catarella, the ""young"" Mimi they ARE all those characters.
Characters I love in the Inspector Montalbano series, but who
immediately become characters I love here. I honestly don't know how
the producers did it. It's almost miraculous.

There is, of course, sadness here in Montalbano's existence. We see,
clearly, how his job becomes his life. How Livia, no matter how
wonderful she is, can't replace his love for his job. How she will
always take second place (or possibly third if you count food). We see
it happening before our eyes. It is a little disturbing, and miserable,
but we wouldn't have Salvo any other way, would we?

We also see how in the young Salvo there is already that sense of
justice, and that quality of loyalty, that become so important in
Inspector Montalbano. As mentioned, everything else is there: the
fascinating ""bit"" parts played by incredibly talented Sicilian regional
theater actors, the incredible sets, the wonderful, languid scenes that
go on and on. Montalbano's joy of food, taken straight from the books
(oh, how Salvo loves his food!). There is this brilliant scene where
Salvo is in the kitchen of the woman who will eventually become his
housekeeper. Under a towel are some odd, maybe pastry, things (I have
no clue what they are). The look on his face when he peaks under the
towel? Priceless. Does he take one after she leaves the room? Well...
you'll have to watch.

Perhaps my favorite of the first six is ""The Third Secret."" It is
splendidly written and has some great acting by its guest stars. It
also covers the ""Fazio"" transition and so it is especially emotional. I
sometimes get overwhelmed by the multitude of names constantly thrown
out in both series, but this one episode is fairly straightforward and
is a work of art. Add to that while this really isn't an ensemble
series (in both series Montalbano is in nearly every shot), this is a
great Catarella episode!

You can probably easily tell I love this series. I love both Montalbano
series equally. I am so thankful to MHz Worldview International Mystery
for airing it in the United States, and I hope they acquire the second
Young Montalbano season, which seems to be in the planning stages. Let
us hope it is!

One thing that I really adore about The Young Montalbano that doesn't
necessarily translate as readily in its ""sequel"" series for me is the
music. Gosh how I enjoy the music in these shows. All of the music. But
especially the opening and closing credits. Olivia Sellerio sings both,
and you can find them on Youtube. Better yet, buy the DVDs from MHz
Worldview International Mystery and listen to her that way.

Additional info: after writing this I learned the strange conical
""pastry"" things that I mention above are actually arancini -- stuffed
rice balls. They are a Sicilian specialty, and if Wiki is to be
believed, have been brought to international attention due to Salvo's
love of them.

5322742,5,B009ERK1AE,"It does not get any better than this. Fantastic actors, storylines, scenary,music and without the gratutious gory violence and sex and foul language that is so prevalent in American TV shows.

5322743,5,B009ERK1AE,"I first started watching the Montalbano (all-grown-up) series and then found these delightful stories of the detective's youthful rise in the Italian Police, using his gifted insight into the human character to solve murders and other crimes. The ""Young Montalbano"" series gives a deeper understanding of the elder character, introducing Livia (his long time girlfriend) in her youth, and colorful characters in his police station who will stay with him.",1390953600,,454,5.5
5322744,5,B009ERK1AE,"As with so many reviewers, we own all the 'Montalbano' DVDs...and we have read all the novels, too.  The now classic episodes (really each one is worthy of being a feature movie) were just about as perfect as cinema can get:  great locations, crystal-clear photography, casting that could not be better from star to character roles.  Plotting is always excellent.  These things continue in the new series.

I think that many fans will admit that even the great Luca Zingaretti was almost getting too old to be believable in the role of a dedicated chief of detectives who couldn't commit to marriage.  Certainly, the wonderful actor who played Mimi Augello was beyond being the 'Lothario' of Camilleri's novels.  In some of the final episodes, the superb character actor who played the medical examiner and was the frequent foil for many exchanges does not appear to be in good health himself.  How could this franchise continue?

My wife wanted more and bought this new series.  I was a bit skeptical but was almost immediately won over by the total experience.  The cover photo of the 'young Montalbano' does not begin to do justice to this young actor's talent.  He makes the role his own while subtly adopting a little of Luca Zingarelli's speech mannerisms and the script writing also helps him to form a firm connection.  Pacing is as good as ever and the stories have Montalbano still outsmarting the local Mafia families by 'working outside the box' of bureaucratic police procedures.  Character roles are still well-cast.  There are some different locations, too:  I was beginning to recognize a few too many places from story to story in the original series. Viewers can still expect to see some gratuitous female nudity in the episodes...but not so much as in the first series.  Perhaps Italian film conventions are changing?

Best wishes to the current 'Montabano' team!  I hope they can continue the very high quality of this series into the future.",1389052800,2,1962,4.908814589665654

We could clearly see how the young Montalbano would mature into the man we know and love, but found it a little hard to follow at times.  That may because the plots are intricate, and we do not have the familiarity we have with the books to fill in the blanks.

You don't need to have seen the original Montalbano series to understand or enjoy this series.  This can stand completely on its own. The really major difference is that this young Montalbano will just knock the women off their feet.  He is enormously good looking and appealing, The older Montalbano was attractive but nothing like this.

If you know nothing of this fictional policeman: he is a police chief in a small town in Sicily. The cast of characters in this region are eccentric, lovable and downright laugh out loud funny.  but the crimes he solves are genuine. sicilians do murder one another feom time to time. the terrainis just gorgeous and this is a very unique place with a very unique people. Plus this is one set of policemen who would never eat junk food. they eat genuine sicilian food day in and day out and you will be ravenous!!!!!

This is a fun series - a prequel to Commissario Montalbano, which is also excellent.  Great way to listen to Italian (and Sicilian) while looking at the beautiful scenery in Sicily.  This is one to watch again and again.",1462320000,,362,4.790322580645161
