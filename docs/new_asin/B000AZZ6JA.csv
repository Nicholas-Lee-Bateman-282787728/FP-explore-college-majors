8081196,3,B000AZZ6JA,"This is a good workout DVD, I was too unfit to do it at first. Now, years later I've gotten into shape via mini trampoline and stretching I will come back to this. It's good cardio and conditioning. Plus you get some self defense out of it too.",1333670400,,244,4.104166666666667
8081197,4,B000AZZ6JA,"This intro to capoeira is perfect for JUST that. The dvd is definitely for beginners, and I learned a lot of the basic steps. This is a just enough video to take from and learn the next steps in a class (they offer them in my town now, yay!) or to get a good small cardio workout. :)",1288828800,,283,3.896551724137931
8081198,4,B000AZZ6JA,"This is an excellent video for those beginning capoeira!  Portuguese is translated to English, French and Spanish.  The teacher takes you through the basics step by step while keeping you entertained by capoeiristas in between lessons.  Large mirror and having fun recommended.",1245024000,3,277,5.5476190476190474
8081199,1,B000AZZ6JA,This will not play on my DVD player.  It is a toss up if you order it.  It may play it may not.,1204156800,2,95,3.0869565217391304
8081200,5,B000AZZ6JA,"I have studied martial arts all of my life.  The instructions on the DVD are thorough and helpful for beginners who are interested in this art.  Capoeira is an excellent martial arts that I use for strength, flexibility, cardio, and keeping great shape.  In addition to being fun and compelling, this DVD also presents techniques, that once mastered, can be extremely lethal moves.  This video is worth the cost; it also has great extras that make it interesting to watch.  Enjoy!",1186444800,9,480,4.8765432098765435
8081201,4,B000AZZ6JA,"It's hard to learn Capoeira from DVD, and there is no good substitution to a teacher watching you and giving you personal feedback. Moreover, it's hard to take notice of the details when watching this DVD, things like where the leg lands, how the hand moves etc. If you take a class, you'd probably learn most of the movements within weeks anyway - and with the details according to your school (I've noticed there are slight variations). But I did learn few things, so maybe you would too.",1181779200,6,490,4.579545454545454
8081202,5,B000AZZ6JA,"Paulinho Sabia really did a great job on demonstrating step-by-step instructions! A really inspirational dvd and complete with short clips of regional style rodas in Brasil. There is the option of having a voice-over lady translate the portugues into english, but i would recommend just learning basic portugues and you will understand what Mestre is trying to say!

I love this dvd and give major props for it!",1178928000,3,411,5.044117647058823
8081203,5,B000AZZ6JA,"If at all possible find a good teacher of capoeira to learn from, be it a mestre, contra-mestre, professor, imstructor, etc.  But if you can't make it to class regularly, then DVD is great to learn some basic and a few intermediate level moves in regional capoeira.  The instruction comes in multiple languages (English was not the default language on my DVD so I had to change it).  Also, you need an older or cheaper DVD player to play the DVD if you are in the US.  I tried to play my DVD on my newer DVD player (3 yrs old) and it would not play at all, but I tried it on a DVD player that was about [...] and played just fine.  Otherwise, this DVD was great and the bonus feature of the capoiera games was phenominal.  You will see somethings you may not ever be able to do, but is really cool to look at.",1178409600,9,809,4.0886075949367084
8081204,5,B000AZZ6JA,This is a great beginners instructional DVD for those really interested in learning this kind of martial art. It also comes in four languages.,1168473600,9,142,4.958333333333333
