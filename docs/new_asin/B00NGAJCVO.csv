6649092,5,B00NGAJCVO,"I saw this when it ran in the theaters.  It was wonderful.  It had many of the old favorites and some more obscure sketches.  There has been some effort made to do a little updating.  There are also lots of musical numbers that were really great.  (They are all amazing but Eric Idle is a treasure.)

If you are the sort of person who watches things once, it may not appeal to you to see many of the same jokes again.  YMMV.  However, I am a long time fan who began watching as a child in the 70s when we lived in the UK.  I can recite many of the old sketches from memory.  It was still well worth the price of the ticket, which was about the same as the cost of the disc.

There are so many sad and depressing things going on in the world today.  Grab some laughs while you can.",1411862400,44,780,3.9612903225806453

The skit in the tea room about the ""Here come the (bloody) Vikings"", and the discrimination accusations that followed are remarkable sarcastic humor so appropriate for the era in United Kingdom and in America.

6649119,3,B00NGAJCVO,"I am a huge Monty Python fan and have been since I was in my teens; needless to say I was excited to see ""One Down, Five To Go"" from their live reunion show at the O2 Arena in June 2014. In all truth I have mixed feelings about the show and this DVD. While there is much brilliance on display here, the production as a whole seemed glitzy in a way that didn't quite work, and the choice of material and presentation was not what I was expecting, especially in a production lasting about 2 1/2 hours. Many of the most famous Python sketches are here, and that's the good news.

The DVD deserves a place in your collection due to the brilliant Palin and Cleese ""Dead Parrot Sketch"" which here morphs into ""The Cheese Shop"" if for no other reason. Many of the sketches have altered lines, some of which work brilliantly (""Armenian string cheese with cumin seeds...Zimbabwean rhinoceros milk cheese?"") but many of the alterations are far less effective than the originals, which I was pining for by the time the final credits rolled. A lot of the changes are made to facilitate transitions between sketches: the refrigerator transition unexpectedly concluding ""The Spanish Inquisition"" was especially jarring and unpalatable. Far worse was the unannounced guest star brought onstage during a radically altered (and not improved) version of ""Blackmail"". I cannot imagine why anyone thought it was a good idea to interrupt the proceedings by taking a bag off Mike Myers' head and letting him blather on for a couple of minutes in the middle of the show, bringing the pacing to a screeching halt.

Despite lots of glimmers of comedic brilliance, at no time did the production hold a candle to the original pieces, which is a shame because many of their earlier live shows were quite rousing. The five living members took turns stepping into Graham Chapman's impossible to fill shoes, and generally acquitted themselves very well; I was likewise extremely appreciative of the line they worked into the ""Dead Parrot Sketch"" to honor Dr. Chapman. Perhaps most annoying was the extremely extensive array of big musical numbers, some from the series, many from the movies, but all of which sported huge numbers of singers and dancers that were an absolute distraction to the underlying comedy. I grew extremely tired of these musicals, which tended to be quite long and only tangentially involve the Pythons. I didn't check to see what percentage of the running time the musical numbers took, but in combination with the long stretches of archival footage we've seen many, many times before, I think this padding would be a very large portion of the lengthy running time. That's what led to my previously unthinkable three star rating; I did something I have never before done during anything Monty Python has made: I got bored. There. I said it. Believe me, nobody is less happy than I am to say this, but the show dragged on so long I was actually eager for it to be finished. If you, like me, are a Monty Python completest, by all means get ""One Down, Five To Go"", it is a significant moment in present-day Python lore, but if you're a casual fan or someone new to the cult of Python, pass on this one.

Monty Python fans will love it, of course ^_^ I had to take off one star because apparently there was a pre-show thing with Dara O'Briain and Lee Mack did that we didn't get to see in the theater simulcast and they did not include it on the bluray. I love Dara O'Briain and I freaked out when I saw him onstage during the encore bows. I really hoped they would include some more extras like the pre-show and maybe some behind the scenes stuff of some of the other O2 performances where they had other celebs do the cameos.

At a John Cleese book signing years ago in Florida I wanted to just throw money. But I wasn't sure his two blond dates would get my American humor.

It was marvelous, even when the actors forgot their lines and the audience intervened and were told to piss off (not on the video).  If you're a Python fan, see them do it again but in a stage format. They keep the laughs going.  It probably wouldn't make too much sense to Python newbies, but a friend of mine who had never seen them before was in tears of laughter. Even though Graham is now dead (one down), they honored him with segments of featured video.

For the most part, they did not freshen the comedy from the 70's so you have dial phones on the desks and the bits, with just a few notable exceptions, being EXACT replays of the classics. When they did not adhere to a slavish recreation of the entire bit (Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition, for one) they actually made it worse. The big musical numbers (I can only think they were a call back to some British music hall tradition) were flat out bad. Unfunny and dated material. Yes, I know they had to give the cast some time to change into the next costume. They almost ruined ""I'm a lumberjack"" with this approach.

I have been a fan of Monty Python since I first popped in my sister's VHS copy of Monty Python And The Holy Grail. It was such a delight getting to see these guys come together once more. Even though the ravages of old age has slowed them down quite considerably, you can still see a lot of their youthful selves come blasting out from the 1960s and 1970s. You can tell they still have a lot of fun even after 40 years! I strongly recommend this to any Monty Python fan or to anyone who is looking for something different to watch. To respond to some people complaining that there was not enough new material in the show; the Monty Python crew isn't whole anymore. They're missing one crucial member of the group-Graham Chapman. Making completely new material wouldn't be the same without the wild and brilliant mind of Graham Chapman, so why cheapen his comedic genius by creating new material that probably wouldn't be a match for their old material anyway? So stop complaining.

Not everything works, but more of it does than I expected. You never forget that Graham Chapman is missing, but they found a surprising number of old sketches that weren't really affected by his absence.

Definitely not for anyone who doesn't already know the sketches inside and out -- you'd be much better off seeing the original versions.

6649236,5,B00NGAJCVO,"Monty Python's final Flying Circus was a brilliantly staged comedy and musical spectacle, filmed at the huge O2 Arena in London.  John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin all look their age, but still have impeccable comic timing.  According to the booklet included with the DVD, Carol Cleveland was born a mermaid off the coast of Bora Bora, before the kiss of life from a handsome man turned her into a beautiful woman.  Carol, who still looks gorgeous for her age, performed in several sketches, including the grand finale.  Graham Chapman still looks like he did back in Python's prime, because he was only shown on film from back in the day, since he passed away in 1989.  Most of the classic skits were included: ""The Whizzo Chocolate Company,"" ""The Argument Clinic,"" ""Nudge, Nudge, Wink, Wink,"" ""The Spanish Inquisition,"" and ""The Dead Parrot"" sketch, which segued into the ""Cheese Shop"" sketch.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the lesser known ""Anne Elk's Theory On Brontosauruses"" sketch, but a little disappointed that they didn't perform the very well-known ""Travel Agent"" sketch, in which Eric Idle prattles on and on about the trials and tribulations of travel.  Given John Cleese's age, I was not surprised that he didn't perform the silly walk from ""The Minister Of Silly Walks"" sketch.  Several songs were performed, including ""The Bruces' Philosophers Song,"" ""The Lumberjack Song,"" ""Every Sperm Is Sacred,"" and ""I Like Chinese.""  I was surprised that Neil Innes, who appeared on the final few Python TV episodes after John Cleese left, did not make an appearance on stage, to perform one of his songs.  The concert concluded with a rousing rendition of ""Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life.""  Too soon the show was over, leaving this viewer with bittersweet memories of the final performance of the greatest comedy troupe of all time.",1416268800,27,1886,4.993610223642173

No, that's two reasons: Die hard Python fan and hilariously funny and for 12 bucks I couldn't resist. Wait, that's three reasons. I'll start over. Among my many reasons for buying the DVD, well, you know the rest.

I used to tape the Python episodes, movies, and specials whenever they appeared on TV and ended up with a shelf full of Python stuff that I watched over and over. Trouble was, they were all taped on EP resulting in poor quality. When the Megaset came out I bought it and then watched the whole thing from start to finish.

This performance has everything. The classic routines plus some new stuff and the musical numbers were very well done. There were also some surprise celebrities that showed up.

If you're a Python fan from way back when, then get the DVD.

6649240,3,B00NGAJCVO,"The Pythons have been around exactly as long as I have.  They were such a powerful influence on my formative years that to this day I remain a huge Anglophile, British comedy especially.

That being said, it saddens me to say I agree with Theo, the other reviewer, that this was a real disappointment.

I understand the guys are old and tired (that in itself makes me sad enough, but that's life).  That would explain the preponderance of musical numbers that are technically Python material but can be performed by large groups of younger singers and dancers, giving the guys a break.  Less easy to forgive is the egregious overuse of Gilliam's animated interstitials, which seem to make up the majority of the show.  They were cute when used sparingly in the TV show and movies.  They wear out their welcome very quickly here.

Theo is right -- apart from a few very tiny tweaks (some not intentional, Cleese is surprisingly prone to cracking up and interrupting a sketch (this is not a bad thing!)), everything is exactly the same as originally performed.  I have everything they've done on DVD already, this brings nothing new whatsoever.  There are a few celebrity cameos (I won't spoil), but surely they could have managed a few more for such a legendary troupe's farewell performance?  I would have preferred seeing the guys sit back and relax while a parade of stars performed a tribute to them.

Thank you for all you've given us, Python.  You deserve to rest now.",1415664000,4,1473,4.729411764705882
6649241,5,B00NGAJCVO,"I had the pleasure to attend the penultimate performance of Monty Python (almost) Live at the O2 last summer and then saw the final performance in the movie theatre the following week.  If you are a long time Monty Python fan, as I am, its clearly a must see/own.  All the classic bits are here and it was fantastic to see the group having fun with them on stage.  Cleese and Palin recreating Dead Parrot and Cheese shop are worth the price of the DVD.  They do tribute to Graham Chapman (who passed away in 1989) through film clips and by each cast member taking on his most famous parts.  While I fully enjoyed the traditional music numbers (Lumberjack, Philosopher song, Always Look on the Bright Side), I am not a fan of some of the other musical production numbers, mostly from Meaning of Life, that were performed by a talented group of singer/dancers.  I suppose they were needed to bridge gaps between sketches.  They were nicely orchestrated and performed and I will be able to fast forward when I get the DVD, so this is a very minor point.

Reading most of the newspaper reviews of this show and the fact they seemed to dwell on the ages of the Pythons and the nostalgic feel, I was a bit concerned.  Certainly they are not as sprightly as they were some 45 years ago, but the comedic timing and spontaneity of performance is clearly there.  To see the gang performing together again for one last time is a great treat not to be missed!

BTW  For any newbies that might read this, for a real treat, get the Complete Monty Python Flying Circus set.  Its a real steal at its current pricing and you can watch the brilliant Python comedy from beginning to end.",1412208000,85,1668,4.447368421052632

8677930,5,B00NGAJCVO,"It's hard to objectively rate something like this.  One one hand, taken purely as a performance, we've got a bunch of really old men performing really old skits, forgetting their lines occasionally, omitting words here and there, and reading from the occasional cure card while throwing up flashy dance numbers with actors and actresses young enough to be the grandchildren of the principal cast while a couple of 'guest stars' literally come out on stage, acknowledge who they are, babble for a bit, and leave.  On those merits, it would probably be considered a pretty poor production.

On the other hand, I grew up watching the Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes on PBS at 12:00am every night, quietly giggling to myself while realizing that I really did need to go to sleep so I wouldn't be too tired in school the next day.  I had seen all of their movies (wound up building some lasting friendships that started with the realization that we had both seen and loved the Python's work), played all of the PC games, and even sought out the non-Python works that my new heroes had been a part of (Yellowbeard, Eric the Viking, Blazing Dragons, etc.).  When I found out that they had come back together to do a new live show, I was obviously utterly excited.

The truly great thing about this show is that they all still 'have it'.  Not a one of them can be fairly said to have lost that grasp of what truly made them hilarious.  Sure they miss a word or flub a line here and there . . . they're all in their 70's for crying out loud.  Knowing full well that since Monty Python ended, most of them have been involved primarily in very non-Pythonesque projects (many of them not really even in the comedy realm or even very funny at all) the fact that they were able to come back together, get back into the swing of their old material, and perform it with the same gusto, energy and proper timing (or proper enough to get the laugh) that I was used to seeing simply made my day.

I've heard people call this sad and pathetic, comparing it to when Dick Clark used to keep doing his New Years Eve show every year even after it was very clear that he was incredibly unhealthy, but I feel this is very different.  While in the Dick Clark situation, it was rough to watch this cultural icon struggle to do the thing he loved (you really wanted to be happy for him, but it looked so difficult for him to even get words out), the Monty Python Live (Mostly) touris more a celebration of a true team coming together to enjoy what they used to be while they are still capable enough to really enjoy it and still present a good product.

It's a fantastic show for any Python fans out there and, in my opinion, a very heartwarming one at that.  Well, as heartwarming as possible considering some of Eric Idle's song lyrics.",1491523200,,2815,4.442718446601941
