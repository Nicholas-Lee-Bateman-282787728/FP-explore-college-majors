4857972,3,B005QA0CDY,"I was actually surprised by this film. It has a number of fine moments, and the underlying messages throughout are good. It's longer than two hours and, due to the nature of the story, it is rather slow moving. Yet I never lost interest. I wanted to see Becca overcome the damage breast cancer caused in her life, damage that was much more than physical and some of her own doing. The acting throughout the film is solid, although some dialogue seemed a bit forced. I'm always very aware of the music in film, and this was well done in 1 Message. It moved the story along, as the music should, never feeling cheesy or overdone or out of place. (All of those things can spoil a movie for me.)

Go ahead and put this one in your DVD queue. Unless you need car chases and gunfire to make you happy, I think you'll be inspired by this story.

Disclosure: I received a copy of this DVD in exchange for an honest review.",1351209600,,914,4.277456647398844
4857973,5,B005QA0CDY,"When I started this movie--I am not going to lie--I did not like it.  The main character was wearing a skimpy outfit to greet her fiance as he left for work in the morning.  I thought to myself, ""Sigh.  This is going to be one of THOSE boring skanky romantic chic flicks.""  However, as the movie progressed, I really enjoyed it.  And I'll tell you why.  In the movie, the stunning beauty gets breast cancer and has to have a double mastectomy.  In case you don't know what this term means, her chest had to be cut off.  Afterwards, her fiance leaves her for another woman.  The protagonist spirals into depression and doesn't even leave her house for fear embarrassment.  What I like is how the movie flashes back and forth in time between the woman before and after her mastectomy.  Anyway, in her depression, the woman starts to chat online with a mysterious man whom she later falls in love with.  I would get all riled up about the message this sends to people about giving personal information out online.  However, there is a line in the movie where her friend warns her and the woman says she is an adult and knows what she's doing.  So, at least, this film doesn't promote children giving out information online.  Anyway, I won't spoil the ending of the movie, but it will make you cry.  This movie will really make people think.  For women--what value do you have besides your looks?  For men--if a woman lost her looks, would you still stay with her?  This is a great film, and it will hold your attention.  Great flick.",1351123200,,1530,4.47463768115942
4857974,5,B005QA0CDY,"This movie is a first-person journey through the diagnosis of breast cancer and the aftermath of that diagnosis.  For Becca, a young woman who had it all by the world's standards, she finds herself homebound by choice, and a prisoner of her own fears and uncertainties.  Though her family and friends try to reach out to her, it is a stranger that sends her a message via her computer that finally gets through all of her emotional road blocks and allows her to begin the road to healing.  What she discovers on her journey will surprise and amaze everyone!

Although the technology is already old news, (sorry to mention this small detail, but even I know laptops don't notify you of a new message when you close it!) The story told within this film is very realistic and plausible.  The diagnosis of breast cancer effects everyone differently, and it really thrown Becca under the bus emotionally.  However, she does learn to accept her new normal, and  her the things that her newfound friendship reveals to her about relationship and about her own heart will really make you examine your own motives for reaching out to others.

This is a pretty long film, but the time files by.  I can't promise you that you won't shed a few tears along the way - especially at the end - but it's well worth it!! I don't get the chance to review a lot of film, but I'm certainly glad this one made its way across my path!  You will be glad as well!  And, as a bonus, part of the proceeds of the film goes toward the fight against breast cancer!  You can't go wrong with this film!",1351123200,,1569,4.4475524475524475
4857975,4,B005QA0CDY,"With October being breast cancer awareness month, this was a very appropriate movie to review.  Becca is a young woman whose life falls to shreds when she is diagnosed with breast cancer.  It was hard to watch her be so mistreated by her fiance', her mom and others during what was the hardest time of her life.  It was also not difficult to see that she hardened her heart and decided to hide away.

Her brother reaches out to her by buying her a computer to try to reach through her shell.  He encourages her to try to try one of her former loves: genealogy.  When she does she finds a link to hope that she thought was completely lost.

While the plot and ending of this movie were very predictable, it was still an enjoyable movie to watch.

Watching this email made me wonder how many Becca's surround us on a daily basis?

Thank you to Echolight Studios for providing this DVD for review.",1351123200,,894,4.36969696969697
4857976,4,B005QA0CDY,"The one regret I find at the end of ""Christian type"" movies is the fact writers tend to wrap the package in sweet paper and put a bow on it. Everything ends happily ever after. Still I enjoy the movies and walk away with a ""feel good"" attitude but maybe...a little let down. 1 Message broke the trend!

This movie, addressed so much on many levels, and it ended the way life ends...imperfect. By addressing 1)breast cancer 2)where our true beauty lays 3)forgiveness 4) encouragement 5)hope 6) survival 7)the unconditional love of Christ 8)peace 9) kindness 10)strength --I'd say it pretty much covered the gambit. Though I thought the movie would be predictable, I was wrong. Every spot I thought the knight should enter, he didn't. Bravo!

I love that, though it was a little long, it showed healing is a process and so is love. It proved even in growth there are setbacks and happiness is not found in what we have, what we do or even in who we are, but it's a choice - one we can make at any point in our lives.

Dean offers kindness and well-spoken words of wisdom from a perspective few know and Becca is at the perfect point in her life to accept what he offers. It goes to show you cannot force a person to change, you can only nudge them gently in the right direction and pray they follow by choice.

Ashley Kate Adams performs a beautifully balanced role as she walks us through the hurt, anger and devastation of Becca, into her forgiveness and freedom.

A film well-done and 1 Message well spoken.

My only question...what about the yellow dog?

4857977,4,B005QA0CDY,"Just about every person you know or talk to these days will have had someone they know effected by breast cancer. The films creator and star, both had family members who were effected by breast cancer, as did many among the cast and crew. I think that's why this film seemed to have such a personal touch and feel throughout the film.

The movie seems to take a little while to get going at the beginning but they do a wonderful job in allowing you to see the heartbreak, depression, and loneliness that Becca feels after being diagnosed and treated for breast cancer.

It's hard to say that I `enjoyed' watching this film about breast cancer, but it was very inspiring to watch.

I loved how with simple words written through emails one persons life helps to change another's. With words of encouragement and God's love, Becca slowly steps out of the darkness she has allowed to fall on her and starts to find her life again.",1348358400,,926,4.532934131736527
4857978,5,B005QA0CDY,"1 MESSAGE expertly delivers several (messages).
You don't have to be familiar with the heartache of cancer to appreciate a film that deals with the healing of mind and soul, as well as body. Which is exactly what JEFFERSON MOORE accomplishes with this movie.
Being a Christian novelist, I can rejoice in the works of others that both inspire me to improve my life and entertain me to the utmost, like 1 MESSAGE.
Ashley Kate Adams delivers a magnificent performance that brings Mr. Moore's script to fruition. She's on screen most of the film and we never tire of her presence. No small feat for any actor.
The ending is quite surprising but richly gratifying and will remain in your thoughts long after the film has ended.

I have all of his films on dvd and absolutely love,""The perfect gift.""Read my review of it to find out how much i like the film. This film has his usual group of regulars popping up. People that we have seen in his various other films. It is dominated by a tremendous performance by Ashley Kate Adams. In a larger budget,bigger studio picture she would have surely been up for award after award for her performance in this movie. As a cancer victim,she is moving,touching and vulnerable. We feel for her as this disease and it""s effects shatter her life. This is also a film of hope and triumph. It""s central message is that true beauty is on the inside,not the outside and we are presented with people that the world has rejected seen in their true beauty as God sees them>this film is not overtly evangelical,as Moore""s other films are,but that does not detract from it""s message that God loves each one of us and we are important to Him,whether we are healthy or not,disabled or not.loved or hated by the world. This is a fabulous film. It is long,but i didn""t feel i was sitting through a two and a half hour film when i saw it. We share with Ashley on her journey to victory and we learn how one person can literally change the world for somebody else by simply sharing God""s love. This is a triumph for Jefferson and all involved. Buy this film and experience it. As a bonus,money from every copy sold is going to cancer charity.

4857980,5,B005QA0CDY,"I'd read the book and was anxiously awaiting the film. Well, it arrived yesterday, so I sat down and watched it. After going through a half box of Kleenex (and I don't cry easy), I decided to watch it again. My wife was out, so we'll be watching it again tonight and it will probably grab me again. When I saw that it was 2 1/2 hours long, I was a bit concerned, but when the credits rolled, it didn't feel anywhere near that long. This is an excellent film. Low budget, but between the story, acting, and directing, you'd never guess it. I'm really glad I bought two copies, 'cause I'm sure one will never make it back.

He looked much older than the 31 year old he was playing and because of it, it made the last part of the movie harder to believe.

4857993,1,B005QA0CDY,"This movie was HORRIBLE.  The acting was the worst that I have ever seen?  I am wondering why anyone would give this 5 stars?  Were they watching the same movie?  I kept watching it until the end because I was sure there would be something to see and justify watching this.  Sure, the overall message of forgiveness, etc. is a good message.  However, that does not make this a good movie people,  The lead actress was horrible,  She is NOT a good actress and was not believable.  Not to mention the actress playing her ""friend"" or her mother, who couldn't act either.

Where do I begin.....The whole ""You've Got Mail"" scenario has already been done.  And the actor voicing the emails from Dean was just irritating with that ""sickly"" sounding voice as the emails were read by Becca.  Not to mention that he looked about 15 years older than that high school pic that he sent her.  There is a reason that I had never heard of this movie and wish I hadn't watched it,

Just because a movie has a ""good message""  doesn't make it a good movie and doesn't mean that the acting or script are good,",1503446400,,1089,4.402010050251256

4858000,5,B005QA0CDY,Wow! I started watching this on Pure Flix or Feeln last night. Had to go to sleep as it was dragging. But each integral part was there for a reason on Jefferson Moore movies. He knows how to pierce the heart with the redemptive messages of Christ's love and forgiveness. They always bring tears because of the story and this was no different. Yes it us a story dealing with a young woman's struggle with having a mastectomy due to breadt cancer. But there is more to it. It is a love story and the ending although sad is joyous too! You need to watch it and do not stop watching because you think it is moving slow. Watch it through and see the mercies of God entertained through it.

4858038,4,B005QA0CDY,I thought this movie was excellent. Very touching-watch it with a box of kleenex. HOWEVER for a movie that addresses diversity with disabilities I found it contridictory in that message when I found that it is not close captioned!,1360108800,,230,4.923076923076923

4858041,4,B005QA0CDY,"I'm a kind of a movie nut and find nothing more relaxing than giving myself permission to sit and watch a movie. I love this time to just kind of ""check-out"" and be entertained. Besides this is good research for a writer to see how characterization is handled and to get ideas. No, joking. For real and for true. (I did say I have to give myself permission here.) So here is another movie review for you:

1 Message is a story about a young woman named Becca who seems to have it all until she's diagnosed with breast cancer. Her life pretty much does a 180 and where the movie starts is at the end of that turn around and she is not a pretty picture. As the story progresses the story behind her story unfolds in bits and pieces and we slowly get the full picture of what brought Becca to this shut in place in her life. The title, 1 Message, refers to a single email message that is the catalyst to turning her life back around and Becca's journey back to the land of the living.

The movie is really well done and the acting high caliber. Yes, this is a faith based film and in my opinion, one of the best kinds. I love stories like this where God's more in the background putting the pieces in place. Kind of like the book of Esther in the Bible. And the ending is far from predictable. It's a tad bittersweet but definitely full of encouragement and hope.

I definitely recommend this movie if you're looking for something on the more serious side but not too serious and with some great doses of humor. Inspiring, well done and time well spent being entertained with quality material (i.e. not a waste of your time).",1354752000,3,1622,4.294117647058823
4858042,5,B005QA0CDY,"Agape' love is the type of love that God has for us, and He showed it to Becca through Dean.  It brought her healing, courage, hope, and love - after she had lost everything she thought would bring her happiness in her life.  The movie doesn't get ""religious"" at all, because you can't find God through ""religion"". Like St Francis of Assisi said, ""Preach the gospel at all times.  If necessary, use words.""  Dean showed the love Jesus has for us without getting preachy, and the result was beautiful and very inspirational.  I pray I can be just like him!",1353110400,2,555,4.51
4858043,5,B005QA0CDY,1 Message is a movie everyone should watch. I loved that Becca is a strong woman underneath her malady. This movie is awesome and uplifting. A definite must see.,1352851200,,161,4.586206896551724
4858044,4,B005QA0CDY,"I watched ""1 Message"" and all I can say is WOW! The movie is so true to life. I imagine a lot of people who experience sickness deal with depression, relationship break-ups, overbearing parents, etc., just as in the movie. What reached out to me the most was the inspiring, creative, and positive outlook that Dean had on life. I'll stop there for those who haven't seen it yet. It's an amazing movie!",1352851200,,401,4.506849315068493
4858045,4,B005QA0CDY,"I just finished watching ""1 Message"" and all I can say is AMAZING! I had seen the movie ""I am Gabriel"" and loved it so when I saw that this movie was being offered I jumped at the chance. And then I kicked myself in the behind because I thought I had just committed to sitting through an hour and a half of girly drama 101. Boy was I wrong I started the movie and I was a little hesitant at first but about 15 minutes in I realized it was delivering a messages and an answer to many things I have been facing. If you are going to buy any movies this year I recommend ""1 Message"" as one of the top 5 on your list if not #1. It is truly a great and wonderful movie.",1352419200,2,663,3.8115942028985508

One hint, have a box of tissues nearby and get comfy.
Thank you for such a thoughtful and well done movie.",1352332800,2,417,4.097560975609756
4858047,4,B005QA0CDY,"Watched this movie after being laid up with knee surgery. Was pleasantly surprised with the movie. I expected just another sad story about a cancer survivor. What I found was a very heart felt, well put together movie about a survivor and the obstacles she overcame. I could see myself in becca and for that this movie is a winner",1352332800,,330,4.516666666666667
4858048,3,B005QA0CDY,"1 Message is a heartfelt story about one woman's emotional and spiritual journey from being diagnosed with breast cancer to wholeness. In this film by Jefferson Moore (The Stranger Series, The Perfect Gift), we are introduced to Becca a beautiful young woman without a care in the world. When Becca discovers a lump on her breast she finds herself losing hold of her world until she receives 1 (email) Message from a stranger that changes the course of her life.

Let me say the acting in this film is well compared to many Christian films out on the market nowadays and Becca, played by Ashley Kate Adams, displays a great level of range as she carries us on her character's odyssey. Though not every character's acting was outstanding, I think for what the story was aiming to project it was applaud-able. At times the main character would do too much verbal exposition (mainly for the audience to know what the 1 Message said). But eventually ""Voice Over"" is used in order to go around this issue which ends up helping the film tremendously.

As far as pace goes I have to say the story starts out interesting but somewhat slow. I was surprised at this mainly because I am used to Moore's films taking off earlier in Act 1. At times I felt that the turning points were not as compelling as I would have liked them to be, but none the less they kept the story going. This might cause some in the male audience to not give the film a chance to build up. But to that  I would say ""endure it""  because the payoff in my opinion is worth it.

The cinematography in this film was worth noting and well done especially in the hospital room scenes or the house scenes. However, I did feel like there were too many close up shots and not enough wide shots (mostly in the 1st and 2nd Act), which as a person who has studied and done cinematography, had me slightly irritated.

Breast Cancer effects countless women in the US alone everyday and I have never seen a film address this topic with such grace and care. Yes it is a long movie and yes it takes time to pick up...but it is an IMPORTANT movie that is worth a watch, mainly because many in our society may not understand the emotional and psychological weight that it takes on a woman. Yes it has its foibles, but 1 Message has made its message worth hearing.",1352073600,3,2308,4.418823529411765
4858049,4,B005QA0CDY,"As a disclaimer, I admit I've been a huge fan of Jefferson Moore/Kelly's Filmworks ever since the release of ""The Perfect Stranger"" a number of years ago, and have seen/owned a copy of every one of his films since then (and loved every single one of them). I will say that ""1 Message"", while not my personal favorite, is certainly his most ambitious film to date, and definitely most worthwhile, even for those who typically abhor Christian cinema.

Based on a novel by Catholic nun Mary T. Lennox, the film centers on Becca Norris, a seemingly typical 28 year old woman who is living the ""American Dream"": she has a gorgeous figure/looks, fiancee, stable job, home - the whole nine yards. But one day she is diagnosed with breast cancer, her perfect life comes crashing down around her, and she descends into the depths of depression, self-pity, and self-loathing. But out of the midst of the pit, a saintly stranger on the internet reaches out to her and begins to teach her the art of living on and living well in spite of the circumstances.

My reactions to the film itself were largely mixed:

On the positive side, the film is beautifully shot, written, and contains a largely memorable soundtrack. The lead actress (Ashley Kate Adams) gives an excellent and engaging performance, giving the film heart and soul and avoids scenery-chewing (which could easily happen in a role like this). While the film exudes a Christian world-view, it doesn't go overboard and get too preachy, making it accessible to the most fervent believer and the hardened skeptic. Also, while the film treats its subject matter very seriously, doesn't take itself as a film TOO seriously, and has moments of unexpected humor, even in the bleakest of times.

On the negative side, the film is WAY too long. Clocking in at just over Two and a Half hours, the film could've benefited from some chopping down. Also, as is usual with lower-budgeted films, semi and non-professional actors were used which resulted in a mixed bag of supporting performances. Some were good - some not so much, which at times hampered the emotional impact of the film.

I also was not a huge fan of the romantic sub-plot of the film; I think at times it got a little too ""chick flick,"" which to me sort of detracted from the film's main message - but remember this is just this man's perspective. Others may think differently :)

All in all, I enjoyed the film, and definitely think it's worth a watch. It's toughy to get through though, especially if anyone in your life has ever been touched by cancer... and on top of that a portion of the proceeds will go towards breast cancer research. Check it out :)",1351987200,,2663,4.691648822269808
4858050,3,B005QA0CDY,"1 Message is the story of Becca, a young breast cancer survivor.  Through flashbacks, we learn that by worldly standards, Becca seemingly had it all: beauty, a great figure, and a successful fiance. After her cancer diagnosis, and treatment, she loses all of those things, and becomes depressed and agoraphobic. But then she meets a friend on-line.

Through his encouraging emails, Becca learns what truth is. ""We are all of infinite worth."" ""Our bodies are just gift wrapping, the real treasure is inside."" ""Courage is doing what you are afraid to do. There can be no courage unless you are scared."" The biggest truth Becca learns is about forgiveness and Jesus.

The movie has a positive Christian story line, and shares the importance of belief in and encouraging others. It also shares the important message to breast cancer survivors (just in time for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, October) that the real treasure of us is on the inside.

However, at over  2.5 hours, the movie was too long.  Because it was a drama similar to a Hallmark or Lifetime for Women movie, it didn't have the action to warrant that much time investment.  And for me, as someone who likes the end of a movie to be wrapped up with a pretty bow, the ending left me wanting more. (I'll leave it at that, so I don't spoil the ending for you.)

I think the movie was a solid 3 out of 5 stars. As Christians, I believe in supporting Christian films, and this movie would be a nice chick flick to watch on a cold, rainy afternoon when you had the extra time. It is inspiring, encouraging, and honors God. That's a pretty good find, and a rare one at that, for a movie today.",1351728000,4,1649,4.547297297297297

I am glad this movie is now part of my collection! Thanks Jefferson, Echo Light, and Kelly's Filmworks Ltd.",1351641600,2,464,4.458823529411765
4858052,5,B005QA0CDY,"I must say that this was a fabulous movie.  By having a disability that affects my physical body, I was able to relate to the main character, Becca's feelings and isolation.  With the help of a friend she meets online, she is able to overcome her issues and create a new life for herself after her illness.  The movie portrayed her struggles well and it gave glimpses to what her life was like as she was going through her discovery, diagnosis and treatment.  It's theme of loss and renewal is sure to speak to women's hearts and souls. I was a little surprised at the surprising ending and I was not expecting it but the nature of the ending made the moving even more special to me.  It does not matter what we look like on the outside or what physical problems we have, we are all capable of being loving and caring human beings who can be loved by others.  The movie also includes the need for forgiveness in being able to move on from a trauma.  I would highly recommend seeing this movie.  Be sure to keep your tissues close by as the ending is very touching.

8482984,5,B005QA0CDY,A lovely story based on forgiveness. It sometimes is a hard thing to do but in the end you are forgiving for yourself not for the other person. I think this is a wonderful story in that it shows how wonderful life can be when you stop blaming others and not live in your past life.

This in turn could cause people to turn off this remarkable true story of courage, hope and most of all forgiveness.  There are very few movies that I can say I'm glad I watched but this is definitely one of them.  While watching it's easy to think this story as being fictional instead of a true story.

It did not drag, the acting was great, and it shows how superficial love, which her first fiance showed, is no love at all. By losing her first fiance to another woman, he did her a huge favor and she was able to see him for the insensitive shallow person that he was.  Most likely, those guys will only get worse after marriage. That was one of the most critical messages in the movie if you listen to the underlying idea of imagining how horrible it would have been to live out her life with that guy, had she married him. The only thing that seemed implausible to me in the movie is that ordinarily a 28 year old may show not only the eating disorders, but also it would likely be that she would have to struggle to find a job, possibly live with roommates and have other conflicts. The fact that she is able to live so long in her own home with no job and has the opportunity to isolate is not realistic of most average young women. I would like to have seen the struggles and triumphs of someone having to battle realistic challenges that many face .  Overall, it was a superb movie.",1516147200,,1156,4.174887892376682
