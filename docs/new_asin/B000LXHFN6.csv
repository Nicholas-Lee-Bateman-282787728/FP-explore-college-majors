2716960,4,B000LXHFN6,"This is a cute DVD.  My son is a big fan of the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, and I bought this to see some new episodes.  He enjoys it, but it doesn't hold his attention like the TV show does.  I'm not sure why...but he likes the show better.  I, on the other hand, think this DVD is cute and has fun songs.",1177459200,,302,3.8225806451612905
2716961,5,B000LXHFN6,"We first saw this show on the Disney channel.  My son liked it so much we went looking for a DVD of the shows and would recommend this to other Moms wanting to share Mickey Mouse with their kids today.  There's a balance between things us children of the 70's would remember about the Mickey Mouse Club show and this for us to appreciate it, and it also is enjoyable and memorable for my three year old. It has a good amount of repetition that makes it easy for the show to become familiar to him.",1176508800,12,497,4.166666666666667
2716962,5,B000LXHFN6,"My 2 year old LOVES Mickey Mouse Clubhouse but I was leary of buying a movie length version since most of the time it is too different from the show & my son usually won't like it. However, this is is similar enough that he really likes it.  This is one show that teaches while it entertains and the movie is the same way.

Thumbs up!",1176163200,3,334,4.045454545454546
2716963,3,B000LXHFN6,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter is currently watching this video and she is riveted.  She loves the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on tv, so I shouldn't be surprised.

I am really pissed off right now though.  The video was given to my daughter as a gift from her geat-aunt.  The box stated that the video is about a spring party.  Only problem--it's actually an Easter party and we are Jewish!  If I had known this I would never have allowed this video to be a gift for my daughter.  Maybe she will enjoy the Donald hiccups episode, but I will never show her the Easter episode again.",1175990400,3,572,4.289719626168225
2716964,1,B000LXHFN6,"Usually Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is my 3 year-old daughter's FAVORITE show, but NOT this episode. This episode is extremely frightening for her to watch, because of Pete's malicious plan and the scary giant. I'm not sure why the folks at Disney thought this was a good plot premise for a show aimed at pre-schoolers? They had a great opportunity to do a cute Spring-themed show here and all they could come up with is this? The other episode on the disc (Donald's Hiccups) is amusing and she'll ask for that repeatedly. I'd say this DVD is for older Mickey fans (5 yrs +). For the younger fans, wait for the hiccup episode to show on Playhouse Disney and watch it there...save your money.",1175904000,3,686,4.585365853658536
2716965,5,B000LXHFN6,"Once again, Disney has given mom's and dad's around the world an AMAZING Dvd that both entertains and educates our kids! My 2 year old LOVES Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. We put this DVD in for him one afternoon and he sat on the couch with my husband and watched the entire thing without moving (except for doing the actions of course)!

I would recommend it to anyone! I only wish there were more of these DVDs on the Market! (Thank goodness we have recorded other episodes with the DVR!)",1175126400,3,484,4.438202247191011
2716966,5,B000LXHFN6,"My 6 month old son loves Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, so I decided to buy this DVD for him.  I know this story by heart now.  He loves this DVD, and I put it in when I need to take a shower or clean.  I never have to worry about him being bored.  He definitely is a Mickey Mouse addict!",1174867200,4,281,3.711864406779661
2716967,4,B000LXHFN6,"This DVD features two episodes of the computer-animated ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"" television series. The first is an Easter special, Mickey's Great Clubhouse Hunt. In this double-length (49-minute) episode, when Mickey invites his friends over to celebrate the holiday, Pete seeks revenge when he is left out. There's a good song, ""The Best Easter Party Ever."" A second episode, ""Donald Hiccups"", finds the ""duck with all the bad luck"" unable to sing on Clarabelle Cow's TV show when he comes down with the spasms.

Both shows include the typical Playhouse Disney dose of basic arithmetic, decision-making, music and puzzles. Other characters appearing include Ludwig von Drake, Chip 'n Dale (briefly), even Willie the Giant from the classic cartoon ""Mickey and the Beanstalk."" There's nothing ground-breaking here, but if your preschooler likes the TV show this is a nice addition.",1174780800,24,881,5.384057971014493
2716968,1,B000LXHFN6,"I don't normally write reviews, but was disappointed enough with this DVD to let other parents know.  My 4 year old LOVES Mickey and couldn't wait for this new DVD to come out.  We watched it as soon as we got it home, but by the end my daughter was in my lap in tears and really scared. She will usually watch DVD's over and over again, but not this one (even though she did like the episode about Donald's hiccups). I just wish I had known that Mickey's great adventure included him getting locked up by a mean giant and I could have saved some money and some tears.  I'm sure that a lot of kids will be fine with it, but if your kids have any fears of giants I would skip this DVD.",1174521600,9,684,4.014705882352941

The reason I am posting a review is because I saw someone give it one star because the giant scared their kid.  All I have to say is to joke around with your child about the giant being silly.  There are other episodes where the giant is featured as well and it is known that he is a friendly giant.

The elevator requires enough force that an adult has to operate it, and the flag that attaches to the top either doesn't stay in place jamming the elevator...or pops out all together.  The slide barely stays attached for one or two treks down by one of the figures included.  The movable ear falls off if you even look at it wrong.  The lever to rotate Toodles barely works only ever giving 1 to half a rotation.  The searchlight doesn't hold its position and simply flops down if not being held, plus the dim light drains the watch batteries (not included) in a very short time.

I can't believe Disney put their name on this.

One of the ears/balls on top of the clubhouse will not stay on. 2. the elevator will not go up with the flag on - no matter how you position the flag. 3. the silly slide barely attaches - it will surely fall off the 1st time he moves it.  This piece of crap is not worth $20 - little less the $59 retail price.  Too bad - I'm sure he would have loved it.,1292284800,,532,3.7142857142857144

I find it really annoying - and I really don't mind the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse TV shows.  But this one, UGH.  It has the most obnoxious song that they sing throughout the ""movie"" that makes me cringe every time I hear it.

""The Great Clubhouse Hunt"" is a double-length episode set during Spring/Easter.  Pete, jealous and upset that Mickey didn't invite him to his Easter Party, attempts to get rid of Mickey and have the Clubhouse to himself to lead.  Mayhem ensues and the Clubhouse ""floats"" away.  When Mickey returns (as a result of a fake-out from Pete) he must gather the pieces of the Clubhouse to put it back together.  That annoying ""springtime"" song is sung as well.  The episode glosses over Easter too - not really depicting anything that Easter is about, or what makes it fun.  They have decorated eggs, a cake and try to have a party, but that's it.  They don't talk about decorating eggs, the Easter bunny, or anything else that's ""Easter"" if that makes sense.

The other episode is ""Donald's Hiccups"" which is repeated on the Disney Channel often.  My son has seen this one a few times, so he was underwhelmed.  But he still watched it - enraptured, of course.  ;)",1232409600,4,1625,5.232558139534884

She kept pointing to herself and saying ""Me Mickey"" or ""Miska, Mooska, Mickey Mouse!""....a toddler's version of that, anyway. So when the package arrived and I pulled it out she almost cried with excitment. Truly.

We watch it daily, have to have our Mickey fix. She's learned all of the characters names and it's helped her greatly with her counting.

But the big deal is that it keeps my son's attention. He's a typical little one year old and is much too busy to sit in front of the Tv for any length of time until I put this in. It's long enough to entertain them both while I get chores or cooking done, and I love that it's interactive.

2717223,1,B000LXHFN6,"If you like this show and your child is getting something out of it, I don't see why you shouldn't get it. I personally will not get it for two important reasons to me, my child is not getting any use out of it (As far as the educacional content, it has got very little to almost none, I have found blue's clues and sesame street to be far more effective and entertaining) But putting this aside, the show itself is not creative at all, it is reusing the same characters over and over again, I think is a complete fraud and against what Walt Disney stood for, which was originality and creativeness and artistic talent, which I want my children to learn.
I think the Disney company is all about money and no values at all. They take the Disney characters (that they did not create) and use them any old way, just because they have the copyrights to them, after all, the original artists are pretty much dead or retired. Plus, it is not like they have to do much work because it's all computarised. They do the littlest amount of work for the maximun amount of money they can charge, I think it is a mediocre show, which also is against what Walt Disney stood for.

The DVD also has a bonus episode, ""Donald's Hiccups"", which was recently shown for the first time on the Disney Channel.  Since we've already seen that one several times too, it wasn't really a bonus for us, but it is one of the better episodes.

There is an episode about Donald getting the hicups which quickly spreads to everyone else and they have to use home remedies to get rid of the hicups so they can sing on Clarabell's TV show.

It is a lot like the show with a few more songs it seems.  Both the episodes are great but my complaint is that you only get two.  There are some decent extras on this disc but my daughter is 2 and it's more about the show.  I have also had trouble playing this disc on my car DVD player which I'm sure is tied to Disney copy protection as other DVD's work fine.

Disney has something called fast play which seems like a great idea.  My impression of fast play would be put it in and it goes straight to the show.  Well it does that but not without playing several previews from other DVD's that are available.  This should be a selection off of the main menu and not force you to watch them on fast play.

The episodes are a half hour long so they could have easily fit at least two more episodes on the DVD for greater value.  A Doodlebops DVD gets four episodes on one DVD and costs 10 - 12 dollars.  This one puts two episodes on one and costs 15 - 22 dollars.  I can't help but feel like they are bilking me a little bit.  I found it at Target for 15.00 and it looks like you can get it used on Amazon for close to the same price.
