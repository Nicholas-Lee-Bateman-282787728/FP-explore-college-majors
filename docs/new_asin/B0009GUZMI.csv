I paid $19.99 for it and think I can find it for sale for about the same if I search Kitty Show on the net. In case someone looks here though, I wanted to share how much fun our cats had with it! Excellent cat entertainment!",1518912000,,360,3.8133333333333335
8060334,3,B0009GUZMI,"The original Kitty Show with bugs has been wonderful, I think because they had made it easy on cats' eyes.  I really like the white moth on the black screen. The kitten is entranced with that.

Kitty Show - the Birds I would rate as 3 because it is a screen of birds excitedly eating corn against a backdrop of green corn plants. They are very enthusiastic and hop around and chirp.  The older cat just lies down by it. The kitten was initially interested but then not so much. She still, however, likes the older Kitty Show with bugs. We play that every day. I have 3 kitty shows now and alternate them.",1360022400,,604,4.280701754385965
8060335,3,B0009GUZMI,"This video is okay but my cats just didn't get into it like the Cat Sitter videos. It's just the same scene with the same birds over and over. Boring, even for them.",1323043200,,165,4.03030303030303
