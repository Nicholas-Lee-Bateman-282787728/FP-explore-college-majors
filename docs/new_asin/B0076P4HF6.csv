Not even going to bother and request a replacement because it appears similarly useful information is available for free in various Youtube videos. The reason I bought this set I was interested in getting information on pearl stringing materials that don't stretch. The author does not endorse any particular brand though. Instead she suggests that you look for polyester thread offered by upholstery companies. Well, I've contacted several both online and around where I live, and they say anything they have in the sizes suitable for pearl stringing will stretch. Most of it will stretch a whopping 26%! I contacted the author to try and obtain further advice on that but she wasn't helpful. Haven't decided whether I should discard this product right away or have it sit and collect some dust and then discard it.",1409097600,,954,4.823170731707317
