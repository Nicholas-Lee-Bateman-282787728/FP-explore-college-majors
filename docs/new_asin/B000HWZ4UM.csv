2644397,1,B000HWZ4UM,"I mean seriously people, this was one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen in my life. I mean the acting was choppy and it was bad as hell. I couldn't believe that even Allen Payne's acting was horrific in this movie. It was absolutely terrible and I would definitely keep this movie on the Blockbuster shelves and not into anyone's homes. Otherwise you would be very angry that you added it to your collection.",1178409600,3,411,4.493333333333333
2644398,5,B000HWZ4UM,"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie.  Allen Payne and Treach were absolutely great.  Great story, good laughs, really good ending.",1177459200,,154,5.12
2644399,2,B000HWZ4UM,"Allen Payne is a good actor in my opinion but he should avoid poorly directed/scripted films such as this. I enjoy seeing Elise Neal in anything because she also is a fine actor and very easy on the eyes to boot. Her character did represent some semblance of logic in this disorganized film.  I guess any work beats no work at all. I bought the DVD so I earned the right to be critical, two thumbs down from me. Are films about Playas and Hustlers, pimps and Ho's all we want?",1177027200,5,476,4.230769230769231
2644400,5,B000HWZ4UM,this was an excellent movie. all of the actors were believable in their rolls.the script plot was well delivered. the ending will blow your mind. i absolutely enjoyed this movie. a must have in my collection.,1175299200,3,208,4.805555555555555
2644401,5,B000HWZ4UM,"Intriguing and original.  Makes you stop and think.  Sometimes things really aren't what they appear to be.  Greed will make people do some low down, deceitful things...

The acting was excellent and the chemistry between Allen Payne and Elise Neal was beautiful.  Hope to see these two together again in the near future.

I highly recommend this film...",1173916800,3,354,5.017241379310345

2644403,5,B000HWZ4UM,"Playas Ball"" is the story of a young star athlete who -- right after signing a major shoe endorsement deal -- is hit with a paternity suit by a woman with whom he has not been involved. The movie's intent is to show the public that, although often envied, professional athletes are frequently exploited.  This movie will engage the viewer and take them into the oft misunderstood world of professional sports. The script was well written and the production is great.",1172966400,6,466,4.753086419753086
8141802,3,B000HWZ4UM,It was an okay film. Only interested in seeing it because I am an Allen Payne fan. I've seen better.,1440806400,,100,4.05
8141803,5,B000HWZ4UM,Funny and interest movie.,1415577600,,25,5.5
8141804,5,B000HWZ4UM,I would buy this if it was available on DVD.  I saw it on tv an recorded it but would love an original copy.  I enjoyed it and am seeking a legal copy.  Help,1230336000,,157,3.5588235294117645
8141805,1,B000HWZ4UM,"Don't waste your $$ or time. Just caught this on cable.  The underlying love story was the only thing that kept me watching, but it's just extremely disappointing.  Bad plot, bad acting, cheezy, gimicky, and sorry.  This had the potential to be better, but someone dropped the ""ball"" on this one.  I can see why it's not available on DVD. Who would want it?",1191110400,,357,4.53125
8141806,2,B000HWZ4UM,"There were two reasons why I continued to watch this movie.

1. Allen Payne. I love him and think he acts very well when given good material to work with.

2. The Last Scene.  I was curious to see if Allen was going to get with Elise.  I figured they would get together. This was the best scene in the movie.

The movie was a little too ghetto for me and $13.99 was too expensive for this trash!",1188518400,,395,4.012820512820513
8141807,5,B000HWZ4UM,All I can say is WOW!!!!! This movie is rediculous! I could not stop watching and even talked about it for days after I watched it to my girlfriends!! Great movie! Marjel and Kenji will love it!,1181174400,,194,4.27027027027027
8141808,3,B000HWZ4UM,"The movie was good, however the additional characters with the cook and MC Lytes and the cousin should have not been in this film as they took away from the movie.  Elise Neal is such a great actress and Allen Payne acting was surprising not good as he is a good actor also.",1180742400,,274,4.169811320754717
8141809,4,B000HWZ4UM,This was a pretty good movie. They had a few ghetto characters. But I must admit that Treach & Allen Payne are pretty easy on the eyes. It had a great twist at the end which was totally opposite of what I thought was going 2 happen. It was unpredictable which is a plus 2 me.,1180569600,3,275,3.9285714285714284
8141810,2,B000HWZ4UM,"This movie wasn't exactly terrible, the plot was decent at times although it got dumb in the middle.

1.  I think there are a few charachters that were needless and brought down the quality of the movie.  The cooks (the son and dad) kind of made this movie dumb for me, along with the cousin and MC Lytes charachter.  None of these charachters really improved this movie.

2.  Treach was terrible as well.  He's always been a terrible actor to me, ever since Jasons Lyric! In fact, imagine Treach's charachter in Jasons Lyric, well it's the same charachter here just bald!

3.  And this plot twist that every one is talking about was not that big of a suprise.  I figured it out the first time the ""other woman"" came to the house.  If you pay close attention you'll see this plot twist and it is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO dumb.

The only thing anyone has said about this movie that I agreed with is Allen Payne and Elise Neil had good chemistry.  I would love to see them together again.",1179619200,4,991,4.5
8141811,5,B000HWZ4UM,"This is a very well-written movie with a brilliant new plot, well thought out and constructed with entertainment and mystery combined. The characters are complex and realistic. I would highly recommend it, however not to anyone under 12 years old.
